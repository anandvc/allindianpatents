				<td>A 6-AMIN0-2-PHENYL SUBSTITUTED PYRAZINE COMPOUNDS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of inhibitors of protein kinases.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Protein kinases are a family of enzymes that catalyse the phosphorylation of<br>
specific residues in proteins. In general protein kinases fall into several groups; those<br>
which preferentially phosphorylate serine and/or threonine residues, those which<br>
preferentially phosphorylate tyrosine residues and those which phosphorylate both<br>
tyrosine and Ser/Thr residues. Protein kinases are therefore key elements in signal<br>
transduction pathways responsible for transducing extracellular signals/ including the<br>
action of cytokines on their receptors, to the nuclei, triggering various biological<br>
events. The many roles of protein kinases in normal cell physiology include cell cycle<br>
control and cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, cell mobility and mitogenesis.<br>
Protein kinases include members of the Protein Tyrosine Kinase family (PTKs),<br>
which in turn can be divided into the cytoplasmic PTKs (CTKs) and the receptor PTKs<br>
(RTKs). The cytoplasmic PTKs include the SRC family, (including: BLK; FGR; FYN;<br>
HCK; LCK; LYN; SRC;YES and YRK); the BRK Family (including: BRK; FRK, SAD;<br>
and SRM); the CSK family (including: CSK and CTK); the BTK family, (including BTK;<br>
ITK; TEC MKK2 and TXK), the Janus kinase family, (including: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and<br>
Tyk2), the FAK family (including, FAK and PYK2); the Fes family (including FES and<br>
FER), the ZAP70 family (including ZAP70 and SYK); the ACK family (including ACK1<br>
and ACK2); and the Abl family (including ABL and ARG). The RTK family includes<br>
the EGF-Receptor family (including, EGFR,HER2, HER3 and HER4); the Insulin<br>
Receptor family (including INS-R and IGF1-R); the FDGF-Receptor family (including<br>
PDGFRa, PDGFRÃŸ, CSFIR, KIT, FLK2); the VEGF-Receptor family (including; FLT1,<br>
FLK1 and FLT4);the FGF-Receptor family (including FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and<br>
FGFR4); me CCK4 family (including CCK4); the MET family (including MET and<br>
RON); the TRK family (including TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC ); the AXL family .<br>
(including AXL, MER, and SKY); the ITE/TEK family (including TIE and TIE2/TEK);<br>
the EPH family (including EPHA1, EPHA2, EPHA3, EPHA4, EPHA5, EPHA6,<br>
EPHA7, EPHA8, EPHB1, EPHB2, EPHB3, EPHB4, EPHB5, EPHB6); the RYK family<br>
(including RYK); the MCK family (including MCK and TYRO10); the EOS family<br>
(including ROS); the RET family (including RET); the LTK family (including LTK and<br>
ALK); the ROR family (including ROR1 and ROR2); The Musk family (including<br>
Musk); the LMR family including LMR3, LMR2 and LMR3); and the SuKTKlO6 family<br>
(including SuRTK106).<br>
Similarly, the serine /threonine specific kinases comprise a number of distinct<br>
sub-families, including; the extracellular signal regulated kinases, (p42/ERK2 and<br>
p44/ERKI); c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK); cAMP-responsive element-binding<br>
protein kinases (CREBK); the cydin dependent kinases (CDKs); cAMP-dependent<br>
lanase (CAPK); mitogen-acaVatad protein kinase-activated protein kinase (MAPK and<br>
its relatives); stress-activated protein kinase p38/SAPK2; mitogen-and stress-activated<br>
kinase (MSK); protein kinases, PKA, PKB and PKC inter alia.<br>
Additionally, the genomes of a number of pathogenic organisms possess genes<br>
encoding protein kinases. For example, the malarial parasite Flasmodiuzn faldparum<br>
and viruses such as HPV and Hepatitis viruses appear to bear kinase related genes.<br>
Inappropriately high protein kinase activity has been implicated in many<br>
diseases resulting from abnormal cellular function. This might arise either directly or<br>
indirectly, for example by failure of the proper control mechanisms for the kinase,<br>
related for example to mutation, over-expression or inappropriate activation of the<br>
enzyme; or by over- or under-production of cytokines or growth factors also .<br>
participating in the transduction of signals upstream or downstream of the kinase. In<br>
all of these instances, selective inhibition of the action of the kinase might be expected<br>
to have a beneficial effect Diseases where aberrant kinase activity has been implicated<br>
include: diabetes; restenosis; atherosclerosis; fibrosis of the liver and kidney; ocular<br>
diseases; myelo- and lymphoproliferative disorders; cancer such as prostate cancer,<br>
colon cancer, breast cancer, head and neck cancer, leukemia and lymphoma; and,<br>
auto-immune diseases such as Atopic Dermatitis, Asthma, rheumatoid arthritis,.<br>
Crohn's disease, psoriasis, Crouzon syndrome, achondroplasia, and thanatophoric<br>
dysplasia.<br>

The pharmaceutical compositions for the administration of the compounds of<br>
this invention may conveniently be presented in dosage unit form and may be<br>
prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods<br>
include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier<br>
which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active ingredient<br><br>
into association with a liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both/ and then,<br>
if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. In the pharmaceutical<br>
composition the active object compound is included in an amount sufficient to<br>
produce the desired effect upon the process or condition of diseases. As used herein/<br>
the term "composition" is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified<br>
ingredients in the specified amounts/ as well as any product which results, directly or<br>
indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a<br>
form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets/ troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily<br>
suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or<br>
syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to<br>
any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and<br>
such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting<br>
of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order<br>
to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the<br>

which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These exdpients may be for<br>
example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium<br>
phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example,<br>
corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and<br>
lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc The tablets<br>
may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration<br>
and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action<br>
over a longer period. For example/ a time delay material such as glyceryl<br>
monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated to<br>
form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release.<br>
Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules<br>
wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent for example,<br>
calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein<br>
the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil,<br>
liquid paraffin, or olive oil.<br>
Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients<br>
suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending<br>
agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxy-<br>
propylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and<br>
gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide,<br>
for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty adds,<br>
for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide<br>
with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or<br>
condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids<br>
and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products<br>
of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides/<br>
for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also<br>
contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate,<br>
one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more<br>
sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.<br>
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a<br>
vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a<br>
mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening<br>
agent, for example beeswax hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as<br>
those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral<br>
preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant<br>
such as ascorbic add.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous<br>
suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a<br>
dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives.<br>
Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those<br>
already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring<br>
and coloring agents, may also be present.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of<br>
oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or<br>
arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable<br>
emulsifying agents may be naturally- occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gum<br>
tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and<br>
esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example<br>
sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with<br>
ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions<br>
may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents.<br>
Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example<br>
glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a<br>
demulcent a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable<br>
aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to<br>
the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending<br>
agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also<br>
be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable<br>
diluent or solvent for example as a solution in 13-butane diol. Among the acceptable<br>
vehicles and solvents that maybe employed are water, Singer's solution and isotonic<br>
sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed<br>
as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be<br>
employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as<br>
oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be administered in the form<br>
of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be<br>
prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at<br>
ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in<br>
the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene<br>
glycols.<br>

containing the compounds of the present invention are employed. (For purposes of<br>
this application, topical application shall include mouthwashes and gargles.)<br>
The compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form<br>
of liposomes. As is known in the art liposomes are generally derived from<br>
phospholipids or other lipid substances. Liposomes are formed by mono or<br>
multamellar hydrated liquid crystals that are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any<br>
non-toxic, physiologically acceptable and metabolisable lipid capable of forming<br>
liposomes can be used. The .present compositions in iiposome form can contain, in<br>
addition to a compound of the present invention, stabilisers, preservatives, excipients<br>
and the like. The preferred lipids are the phospholipids and phosphatidyl cholines,<br>
both natural and synthetic. Methods to form liposomes are known in the art<br>

following non-limiting Examples.<br>
MATERIALS AND METHODS:<br>
Compound Synthesis<br>
Compounds are generally prepared in a 2-step process starring from 2,6-<br>
dichloropyrazine.<br>
The first step is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution to generate a monoamino-<br>
monohalo intermediate. (Scheme 1).<br><br>
The nucleophilic aromatic substitution is typically carried out by addition of a<br>
primary amine to the di-halogenated heterocyle in a solvent such as ethanol,<br>
isopropanol, tert-butanol, dioxane, THF, DMF, toluene or xylene. The reaction is<br>
typically performed at elevated temperature in the presence of excess amine or a non-<br>
nudeophilic base such as triemylanune or diisopropylethylamme, or an inorganic base<br>
such as potassium carbonate or sodium carbonate.<br>
Alternatively, the amino substituent may be introduced through a transition<br>
metal catalysed amination reactioa Typical catalysts for such transformations include<br>
Pd(OAc)2/P(t-Bu)3, Pd2{dba)3/BINAP and Pd(OAc)2 BINAP. These reactions are<br>
typically out in solvents such as toluene or dioxane, in the presence of bases such as<br>
caesium carbonate or sodium or potassium tert-butoxide at temperatures ranging<br>
from room temperature to reflux.<br>
The amines employed in the first step of the synthesis of these compounds are<br>
obtained commercially or are prepared using methods well known to those skilled in<br>
the art Of particular interest are a-methylbenzylamines which may be prepared<br>
through reduction of oximes (Scheme 2). Typical reductants include lithium<br>
aluminium hydride, hydrogen gas in the presence of palladium on charcoal catalyst,<br>
Zn in the presence of hydrochloric add, sodium borohydride in the presence of a<br>
Lewis acid such as TiCl2, ZrCl4, NiCl2 and MoO3, or sodium borohydride in<br>
conjunction with Amberlyst H15 ion exchange resin and lid.<br><br>
a-Methyl benzylamines of high optical purity may be prepared from chiral de<br>
methyl benzyl alcohols using methods well known to those skilled in the art Such<br>
methods include derivatisation of the hydroxyl as a mesylate or tosylate and<br>
displacement with a nitrogen nucleophile, such as phthalimide or azide which is then<br>
converted to the primary amine using conventional synthetic methods; or,<br>
displacement of the hydroxyl with a suitable nitrogen nucleophile under Mitsunobu<br>
conditions. The chiral a-methyl benzyl alcohols may be obtained through chiral<br>
reduction of the corresponding ketones. Chiral reducing methods are now well<br>
known in organic chemistry and include enzymatic processes, asymmetric<br>
hydrogenation procedures and chiral oxazaborolidines.<br>
The second step of the synthesis typically involves a palladium mediated cross-<br>
coupling of the monoaxnino-manochloro intermediate with a suitably fundionalified<br>
coupling partner. Typical coupling partners are borornic adds (Suzuki coupling: see<br>
for example Miyaura, N. and Suzuki Chem Her. 1995, 952457) or stannanes (Stille<br>
coupling: see for example Stille, J.K., Angew. Chew., Int Ed. Engl., 1986,25,508)<br>
(Scheme 3).<br><br>
The Suzuki coupling is the preferred coupling method and is typically<br>
performed in a solvent such as DME, THF, DMF, ethanol, propanol, toluene, or 1,4-<br>
dioxane in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate, lithium hydroxide,<br>
caesium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium fluoride or potassium phosphate.<br>
The reaction maybe carried out at elevated temperatures and the palladium catalyst<br>
employed may be selected from [Pd(PPh3)4], Pd(OAc)2 [PdCl2(dppf)l. Pd2(dba)3/P(t-<br>
Bu)3.<br>
The products formed from this reaction sequence may be further derivatised<br>
using techniques well-known to those skilled in the art Alternatively, derivatisation<br>
of the mono-amino mono-chloropyrazine may be undertaken prior to displacement of<br>
the 6-chloro subsntuent This derivatisation typically involves functionality originally<br>
present on the amine species and employs methods well known to those skilled in the<br>
art.<br>

cultured in DMEM 10% Tet-System Approved FBS (without WEHI 3B conditioned<br>
medium).<br>
Cellular assays were performed as follows:<br>
Cell suspensions were prepared by harvesting cells from culture. (Cells used in this<br>
test should be in later log phase growth and high viability.) Cells were diluted in correct<br>
growth medium to l.lx final concentration (from 50000 cell/mL to 200,000 cell/mL,<br>
depending on cell line).<br>
Compounds to be tested were added (10ÂµL, 10X final concentration) to a flat bottom<br>
96-we!l plate. The cellular suspension (90ÂµL per well) was added, and the plate incubated<br>
for 40 hr at 37 Â°C, 5% CO2. MTT (20 ÂµL per well, 5mg/mL in PBS) was added and the<br>
plates were returned to the incubator for a further 6 hours. Lysis buffer (100 ÂµL per well,<br>
10% SDS, 0.01N HC1) was added and the plate stored in the incubator overnight. The plate<br>
was then read at 590 nm.<br>
