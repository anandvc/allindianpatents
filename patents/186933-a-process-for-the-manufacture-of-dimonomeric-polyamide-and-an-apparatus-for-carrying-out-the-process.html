This invention relates to a process for the manufacture of dimonomeric<br>
polyamide and more specifically to a continuous process for the preparation of<br>
polyamides, the apparatus in which the polymerization process can be<br>
conducted, and process control methods useful in said polymerization process.<br>
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND<br>
Some commercially important polyamides, referred to<br>
herein as dimonomeric polyamides, require starting<br>
monomers of two kinds, one monomer having a pair of<br>
carboxylic acid functional reactive groups(diacid) and<br>
the other monomer having a pair of amino functional<br>
reactive groups (a diamine) .  This class of polyamide<br>
may incorporate more than one diacid and more than one<br>
diamine and may incorporate a small amount, usually no<br>
more than 10%, of a third kind of starting material<br>
having a carboxylic acid functional group and an amino<br>
functional group or a functional precursor to such a<br>
compound.  In the most common method of preparing<br>
 dimonomeric polyamides, the starting diacid and diamine<br>
 components are mixed in stoichiometric proportions into<br>
 a solution containing a large amount of water, typically<br>
 up to as much weight as the combined weight of the<br>
diacid and diamine components.  This water is<br>
subsequently removed by evaporation which requires a<br>
correspondingly large amount of energy.  The evaporation<br>
of water is usually done at elevated pressure in order<br>
to achieve a high enough boiling temperature to prevent<br>
the formation of solids.  After the evaporation, there<br>
must be a pressure reduction step which requires<br>
excessive heat to prevent the product from solidifying.<br>
The heating is known to cause discoloration and chemical<br>
degradation of the product.<br>
Attempts to produce dimonomeric polyamides without<br>
the use of water or other solvents have usually been<br>
unsuccessful.  If one component is a solid, it is<br>
difficult to accurately proportion the solid component.<br><br>
If both components are supplied as liquids (melt), these<br>
liquids may experience degradation, as a result of the<br>
high temperature supplied to keep the components in melt<br>
form.<br>
United States Patent No. 4,131,712, endeavors to<br>
overcome these difficulties.  This patent teaches a<br>
process for the preparation of a high molecular weight<br>
polyamide, wherein a diacid-rich component and a<br>
diamine-rich component are prepared separately in non-<br>
stoichiometric proportions and then the diacid-rich<br>
component and the diamine-rich component are contacted<br>
in liquid state at a high enough temperature to prevent<br>
solidification, and in proportions such that the total<br>
amounts of diacid and diamine, whether combined or not,<br>
are as much as possible stoichiometric.  The major<br>
utility of the process is in the manufacture of nylon<br>
66.<br>
One difficulty that is encountered as a result of<br>
the process in U.S. 4,131,712, where diamine or diamine<br>
rich feed is added directly to a reactive polymerizing<br>
mixture, is that there is substantial volatilization of<br>
the diamine at the reaction temperature, especially<br>
during the last step of the process where the<br>
proportions of diacid and diamine approach<br>
stoichiometric levels and the temperature is the<br>
highest.  Means are required to prevent the escape of<br>
diamine and retain it in the reaction mixture in order<br>
to avoid loss of yield and to maintain stoichiometric<br>
balance.<br>
U.S. Patents 4,433,146 and 4,438,257, teach the use<br>
rf a partial condenser to condense diamine out of vapor<br>
leaving the reaction mixture so as to return the diamine<br>
to the reaction mixture.  However, the procedure, if<br>
used on a commercial scale, with stepwise addition of<br>
diamine, appears to require extended periods of time to<br>
recycle the diamine.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,155,184 discloses a process for<br>
the control of product composition during the<br><br>
manufacture of a polymer, employing near infrared spectroscopy for detecting<br>
composition and using a process computer. The disclosure relates to<br>
polyolefins; no polyamide polymers are discussed therein.<br>
Accordingly,   there   is   provided   a   process   for   the   manufacture   of<br>
dimonomeric polyamide, said process comprises the steps of :<br>
a)	feeding a process  stream  of monomer  containing carboxylic  acid<br>
functional  group   selected  from  a  molten   diacid   such   as  herein<br>
described and diacid-rich mixture comprising 75 % to 85 % by weight<br>
of dicarboxylic acid and    15 % to 25 % by weight of diamine such as<br>
herein described into the first reaction stage of a multistage reactor to<br>
produce a molten polymerizable reaction mixture;<br>
b)	polymerizing said molten polymerizable reaction mixture by flowing it<br>
through a series of at least first and second reaction stages; and<br>
c)	adding   further   diamine   as   herein   described   to    said   molten<br>
polymerizable reaction mixture in at least second reaction stage to<br>
produce the desired dimonomeric polyamide;<br>
wherein the various reaction stages in the reactor are maintained at a<br>
temperature between 178° C and 276° C by heating to prevent solid<br>
formation therein.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a continuous process<br>
for the preparation of polyamides, of the group made by<br>
joining of one or more diamines with one or more<br>
diacids, for example nylon 66.  This continuous process<br>
has advantages over conventional processes by requiring<br>
lower energy consumption, reduced capital cost of<br>
equipment, reduced environmental emissions and cost<br>
advantages pertaining thereto, and improved product<br>
quality.  In the process, a process stream of diacid or<br>
diacid mixed with diamine is fed, as a molten liquid,<br>
into the first stage of a multi-stage reactor and<br>
additional diamine is fed into the reactor at one or<br>
more of the additional stages-  In a vertical reactor,<br>
where the first stage is at the top, these additional<br>
stages are lower than the first stage of the reactor.<br>
More specifically, this invention provides a<br>
continuous process for the manufacture of dimonomeric<br>
polyamides, essentially without emission of diamine in<br>
the vapor, which process comprises the steps of:<br>
a)	providing to a first reaction stage of a<br>
multistage reactor, operating at a pressure which can<br>
conveniently be essentially atmospheric, a process<br>
stream comprising a molten diacid or a molten acid-rich<br>
mixture comprising a dicarboxylic acid and a diamine;<br>
b)	flowing said process stream through a<br>
series of the first reaction stage and at least one more<br>
reaction stage;<br>
c)	adding to said process stream, in at least<br>
one reaction stage beyond the first reaction stage, an<br>
additional diamine component as either a vapor or a<br>
diamine rich liquid; and<br><br>
d) optionally controlling the balance of acid<br>
and amine functional reactive groups (ends) in the<br>
resulting dimonomeric polyamide by an appropriate<br>
control system.<br>
This invention includes the process above wherein<br>
there is also an optional control to maintain column<br>
stability using an appropriate column stability control<br>
system.<br>
The reaction is conducted in a reaction apparatus<br>
equipped with internals provided to cause effective<br>
contact of countercurrently flowing diamine or diamine-<br>
rich vapor with the molten acid or acid-rich feed stream<br>
so as to achieve rapid, efficient scrubbing of the<br>
diamine from the countercurrently flowing vapor,<br>
providing that the temperature of the first stage and<br>
any further stages is sufficiently high to keep solid<br>
from forming in the reaction apparatus.  It is preferred<br>
if the multistage reactor is vertical, with the top<br>
stage being the first stage.<br>
This invention can be used to manufacture nylon 66<br>
(poly-hexamethylene adipamide) where the starting<br>
materials are molten adipic acid or a molten adipic acid<br>
rich mixture of adipic acid and hexamethylene diamine.<br>
The acid rich mixture is about 75% to 85% by weight<br>
adipic acid and about 15%-25% by weight hexamethylene<br>
diamine.  The acid rich mixture is preferably about 81%<br>
by weight adipic acid and about 19% by weight<br>
hexamethylene diamine.  In a preferred embodiment the<br>
process is carried out in a vertical multistage reactor,<br>
having a first stage and one or more additional stages,<br>
typically six to eight stages.  Hexamethylene diamine is<br>
added either as a vapor or a hexamethylenediamine rich<br>
liquid to at least one of the reaction stages beyond the<br>
first stage.  The balance of acid and amine functional<br>
reactive groups (ends) in the resulting polyamide is<br>
monitored and controlled by an appropriate control<br>
system.<br><br>
In step d) it is preferred that control is<br>
accomplished by a near infrared activated feedback<br>
control system which, on demand, causes the injection of<br>
an appropriately small amount of hexamethylene diamine<br>
vapor into or near the bottom stage of the reaction<br>
system so as to essentially achieve acid-amine ends<br>
balance.<br>
The reaction is conducted in a reaction apparatus<br>
equipped with internals, such as but not limited to<br>
perforated plates, coils and agitators, so as to cause<br>
effective contact of countercurrently flowing diamine or<br>
diamine-rich vapor (e.g., hexamethylene diamine or<br>
hexamethylene diamine-rich vapor) with the molten acid-<br>
rich feed so as to achieve rapid, efficient scrubbing of<br>
the diamine from the countercurrently flowing vapor.<br>
The temperature of the first stage and any further<br>
stages must be sufficiently high to keep solid from<br>
forming in the reaction apparatus.<br>
The invention also concerns a continuous process<br>
for preparing an essentially anhydrous mixture<br>
comprising adipic acid and hexamethylene diamine in a<br>
75-85:15-25, preferably a 81:19, weight ratio comprising<br>
the steps of:<br>
(a)	heating a heat stable liquid to about<br>
80°C,<br>
(b)	adding solid adipic acid,<br>
(c)	agitating at about 80°C, at typically<br>
200 RPM, until a solution is obtained (typically about<br>
two hours),<br>
(d)	adding hexamethylene diamine to reach the<br>
desired weight ratio of weight adipic acid:hexamethylene<br>
diamine,<br>
(e)	heating the mixture to from about 120°C<br>
to about 135°C, with agitation, while allowing any water<br>
present to evaporate to form an essentially anhydrous<br>
molten acid-rich mixture comprising a ratio of<br>
75-85:15-25, preferably 81:19, by weight adipic<br>
acid:hexamethylene diamine, and<br><br>
(f)  feeding adipic acid and hexamethylene<br>
diamine in a 75-85:15-25, preferably 81:19, ratio to the<br>
molten acid rich mixture at the same rate that molten<br>
acid-rich feed is withdrawn.<br>
This method of making an acid rich feed is<br>
applicable to other diacid-diamine combinations in<br>
addition to adipic/hexamethylene diamine.<br>
This invention also provides processing apparatus,<br>
in which the process of the present invention is carried<br>
out, comprising a vertical multistage reactor equipped<br>
with internals, for example perforated plates, coils and<br>
agitators, so as to cause effective contact of<br>
countercurrently flowing vapor and liquid streams.<br>
This invention further provides a method of process<br>
control, by which the process of the present invention<br>
is controlled, which method comprises a near infrared<br>
activated feedback control system which determines acid-<br>
amine ends balance and, where needed, causes the<br>
injection of an appropriately small amount of additional<br>
diamine into or near the bottom or final stage of the<br>
reaction system so as to essentially achieve acid-amine<br>
ends balance.<br>
DETAILS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The process can be used to produce a wide variety<br>
of dimonomeric polyamides and copolyamides depending on<br>
the choice of diacids and diamines.<br>
By "dimonomeric polyamide" herein is meant a<br>
polyamide prepared by the condensation polymerization of<br>
two monomers, a diacid and a diamine, for example,<br>
nylon 66 which is a polyamide prepared from adipic acid<br>
(1,6-hexanedioic acid) and hexamethylene diamine.<br>
The diacid component may be selected from<br>
aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic diacids, with the<br>
proviso that a diacid be capable of being used in melt<br>
form by itself or as a melt or as a dispersion in<br>
combination with other diacids or as an acid-rich feed<br>
with diamine at a temperature that avoids excessive<br>
degradation of the diacid.  Specific examples of such<br><br>
acids include glutaric acid, adipic acid, suberic acid,<br>
sebacic acid, dodecanedioic acid, 1,2- or 1,3-cyclo-<br>
hexane dicarboxylic acid, 1,2- or 1,3-phenylene diacetic<br>
acid, 1,2- or 1,3-cyclohexane diacetic acid, isophthalic<br>
acid, terephthalic acid, 4-4'-oxybis (benzoic acid),<br>
4,4'-benzophenone dicarboxylic acid, 2,6-naphthalene<br>
dicarboxylic acid, and p-t-butyl isophthalic acid.  The<br>
preferred dicarboxylic acid is adipic acid.<br>
The diamine component is selected from the group<br>
consisting of aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic diamines.<br>
Specific examples of such diamines include hexamethylene<br>
diamine, 2-methyl pentamethylenediamine, 2-methyl hexa-<br>
methylene diamine, 3-methyl hexamethylene diamine,<br>
2,5-dimethyl hexamethylene diamine, 2,2-dimethylpenta-<br>
methylene diamine, 5-methylnonane diamine, dodeca-<br>
methylene diamine, 2,2,4- and 2,4,4-trimethyl hexa-<br>
methylene diamine, 2,2,7,7-tetramethyl octamethylene<br>
diamine, meta-xylylene diamine, paraxylylene diamine,<br>
diaminodicyclohexyl methane and C2-C16 aliphatic diamines<br>
which may be substituted with one or more alkyl groups.<br>
The preferred diamine is hexamethylene diamine.<br>
An optional third starting material, having a<br>
carboxylic acid functional group and an ami no functional<br>
group or a functional precursor to such a compound, may<br>
be selected from 6-aminohexanoic acid, caprolactam,<br>
5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid and the<br>
like.<br>
If the diacid does not suffer excess degradation at<br>
a temperature around its melting point, it may be used<br>
directly as the feed stream to the first stage of the<br>
reactor.  If the diacid is combined with one or more<br>
diamines to produce an acid-rich feed stream, this may<br>
be done continuously or batch-wise, so long as a steady<br>
feed stream to the first stage of the reactor is<br>
maintained.<br>
The feed stream for the first stage of the reactor<br>
comprises a flowable molten diacid or a flowable molten<br>
diacid rich mixture comprising the selected diacid and<br><br><br>
diamine.  In the case where the process is used for the<br>
preparation of nylon 66, the feed stream for the process<br>
comprises flowable molten adipic acid or a flowable<br>
molten adipic acid rich mixture comprising adipic acid<br>
and hexamethylene diamine.  In a preferred embodiment<br>
for the preparation of nylon 66, the flowable acid rich<br>
mixture comprises a molten mixture comprising<br>
approximately 81% by weight of adipic acid and<br>
approximately 19% by weight of hexamethylenediamine.<br>
The diamine or diamines that are fed to one or more<br>
stages after the first stage of the reactor may be<br>
supplied in the form of a liquid or vapor.  If fed as a<br>
liquid, they undergo substantial vaporization when they<br>
come in contact with the hot polymerizing reaction<br>
mixture.  Pre-vaporization of the diamine feed system<br>
removes some of the heat requirement from the reactor<br>
and reduces the likelihood of time to time variation in<br>
the amount of diamine vapor flow at various points in<br>
the reactor.<br>
Figure 1, described below, shows the internal<br>
configuration of a multistage reactor.  Standard<br>
distillation columns are suitable devices for this<br>
purpose except that the liquid residence time in ths<br>
stages is increased to give time for chemical reaction.<br>
Mechanical agitation is provided to enhance the exchange<br>
of components between vapor and liquid, to prevent zones<br>
of stagnation in the reaction mixture which could lead<br>
to gel formation, to facilitate heat transfer and to<br>
yield greater time-wise uniformity of product.<br>
The absorption of diamine into a reactive polymeric<br>
liquid is found to be most rapid and complete when the<br>
liquid is highly acid-rich and at a relatively low<br>
temperature.  The rate of transfer of diamine from vapor<br>
into liquid is sufficiently rapid and complete, even<br>
when the liquid is close to a balance of acid and amine<br>
ends, and at a high enough temperature to keep high<br>
molecular weight polymer molten so that a reactor with<br>
six to eight stages is capable of producing balanced<br><br>
polymer and at the same time of retaining in the polymer<br>
essentially all of the diamine fed to the reactor.<br>
In comparison with conventional processes, the<br>
advantages of the process of the present invention<br>
include lower energy consumption, due to the efficient<br>
utilization of the heat of the amidation reaction and<br>
due to avoiding the need to evaporate off large amounts<br>
of water; reduced capital cost of equipment; reduced<br>
environmental emissions, due to the efficient absorption<br>
of diamine vapor by the acid-rich liquid flow in the<br>
reactor; and improved product quality, due to the lower<br>
residence time of the polyamide at elevated temperature<br>
and to lower final processing temperature.  This results<br>
in a lower thermal degradation index and reduces the<br>
extent of discoloration.<br>
In some cases, and in the preferred case where<br>
nylon 66 is the product and adipic acid is the starting<br>
dicarboxylic acid, the diacid must be combined with one<br>
or more diamines into an acid-rich feed stream in order<br>
to secure a feed in which the diacid remains chemically<br>
stable.  This may be done continuously or batch-wise, as<br>
long as a steady feed stream to the first stage of the<br>
reactor is maintained.  One method is provided in U.S.<br>
4,131,712, col. 2, lines 30-39, which patent is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.  A preferred method is<br>
to carry out this process continuously by combining, at<br>
this same rate at which molten acid-rich feed is<br>
withdrawn, with agitation, at approximately 120-135°C,<br>
feed streams of solid, granular adipic acid and liquid<br>
hexamethylene diamine or hexamethylediamine solution<br>
(which is commercially used at 85-100% purity, balance<br>
being water).  Holding time in the agitated reactor is<br>
approximately one to three hours.  Holding for longer<br>
times is not detrimental to the reaction product.<br>
A preferred method for preparing the acid-rich feed<br>
utilized in the preparation of nylon 6,6 in a continuous<br>
fashion comprises the steps of (a) heating a heat stable<br>
liquid to about 80°C, (b) adding solid adipic acid,<br><br>
(c) agitating at about 80°C until a solution is<br>
obtained, (d) adding hexamethylene diamine to reach the<br>
desired 81:19 by weight adipic acid:hexamethylene<br>
diamine ratio, (e) heating the mixture to about 125°C to<br>
135°C, preferably about 130°C, with agitation while<br>
allowing any water present to evaporate to form an<br>
essentially anhydrous molten acid-rich mixture<br>
comprising 81:19 by weight adipic acid:hexamethylene<br>
diamine, and (f) feeding adipic acid and hexamethylene<br>
diamine in a 75-85:15-25 ratio, preferably a 81:19<br>
ratio, to the molten acid rich mixture at the same rate<br>
that molten acid-rich feed is withdrawn.<br>
The heat stable liquid is used to facilitate heat<br>
and mass transfer.  Water or a stable molten diacid, for<br>
example dodecanedioic acid, may be employed.  Water is<br>
preferred.<br>
Solid crystalline adipic acid is employed.<br>
Depending on particle size, time to reach solution state<br>
may vary.  Typically, agitation at this step is 200 RPM<br>
for 2 hours.<br>
Hexamethylene diamine or hexamethylene diamine<br>
solution, which may contain up to about 15% water may be<br>
used.  The amount of water to he evaporated varies.<br>
(For example, in cold weather, the diamine is shipped<br>
with about 20% water.)  If water is employed as the heat<br>
stable liquid and hexamethylene diamine solution is<br>
used, water to be removed is at a maximum.  If a stable<br>
molten diacid, for example, dodecanedioic acid, is<br>
employed as the heat stable liquid, water removal is<br>
minimized.<br>
Essentially anhydrous in the present context means<br>
approximately 2% water or less.  If a heat stable liquid<br>
other than water is used, for example, dodecanedioic<br>
acid, once the continuous feed of adipic acid and<br>
hexamethylene diamine in an 81:19 ratio to the molten<br>
acid rich mixture is commenced, some time will be<br>
required before steady state operation is reached.  That<br>
is, some time will be required before the heat stable<br><br>
liquid other than water is diluted out of the acid-rich<br>
feed mixture.<br>
If continuous operation is suspended after step (f)<br>
of the process is reached, the mixture may be cooled and<br>
reheated and operation recommenced without ill effect<br>
without having to repeat steps (a) though (e).<br>
In a most preferred mode, the exit stream from the<br>
acid rich mixture makeup vessel to the first stage of<br>
the reactor is continuously monitored by near infrared<br>
spectrophotometry.  The near infrared analysis predicts<br>
percent adipic acid.  Measurement is done in line and<br>
continuously, as the material flows through the reactor<br>
feed pipe.  Based on this analysis, changes are made<br>
continuously in the hexamethylene diamine (HMD) feed<br>
rate. A computer causes the HMD injection to respond to<br>
bring the composition closer to the set point.<br>
To produce a product with time-wise uniformity<br>
suitable for commercial end uses, it is necessary to<br>
monitor and control the difference between the<br>
concentration of the carboxylic acid functional end<br>
groups and the concentration of amine functional end<br>
groups in the resulting dimonomeric polyamide by an<br>
appropriate control system.  This requirement is<br>
especially stringent for product that will eventually be<br>
formed into fibers that will be treated with dyes that<br>
attach themselves to one or the other of the two<br>
functional groups.<br>
To achieve this control a measurement is made of<br>
some characteristic in the polymer leaving the final<br>
stage of the reactor which is sufficiently sensitive to<br>
the concentration difference.  The method must be<br>
accurate to within about plus or minus 0.5 units in the<br>
difference in acid and amine ends concentrations (gram<br>
equivalent ends per million grams of polymer).  Any<br>
analytical method of this approximate accuracy, that is<br>
rapid enough to give answers in a timely enough fashion<br>
to effect process control, would be suitable.  In<br>
general, manual titrimetric methods, though sufficiently<br><br>
accurate, are not rapid enough to give meaningful<br>
process control.  A preferred method of monitoring<br>
reactor output is by near-infrared spectrophotometry.<br>
The near-infrared analysis measures the difference<br>
between acid and amine ends to an acceptable degree of<br>
accuracy with a sufficiently timely response.  Based on<br>
this analysis, changes are made in the hexamethylene<br>
diamine feed into or near the bottom stage of the<br>
reactor system.  By "into or near" is meant that this<br>
feed is into the bottom reactor stage, into the stage<br>
immediately above the bottom stage or into the transfer<br>
line leading out of the bottom reactor stage.  Most<br>
preferably, this feed is into the transfer line.<br>
The desired product from the transfer line is<br>
generically described, in the case of nylon 6,6<br>
processing, as intermediate molecular weight nylon.  As<br>
such it is suitable for sale as is, or it can be further<br>
processed to higher molecular weight nylon by methods<br>
known in the art, for example, in an extruder or through<br>
solid phase polymerization.    {\<xqmpa>\&gt;y\M£r<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 describes diagramatically the internal<br>
configuration of a reactor.  The reactor is divided into<br>
discrete stages 1-8 using perforated barriers, 9-15,<br>
between stages, which barriers allow separate passages<br>
for vapor and liquid flows from stage to stage.<br>
Figure 2 describes an eight stage reactor.  Feed<br>
material streams 16 and 17 are fed into mix tank 18 for<br>
diacid rich feed preparation.  The acid rich mixture is<br>
then fed into stage 1.  The column is heated by heat<br>
sources 19-24.  Agitator 30 is located at the bottom of<br>
the reactor.  Hexamethylene diamine vapor is fed into<br>
the acid rich mixture at various stages 2 through 8.<br>
Nylon 66 polymer is removed after bottom stage 8.<br>
Beyond the first stage, each stage is separated from the<br>
stage above and below it by a horizontal perforated<br>
barrier 25 with openings 26 and 27, respectively, for<br>
liquid and vapor to flow through.  Liquid flowing from<br><br>
the bottom stage 8 is continuously removed at the bottom<br>
of the reactor.<br>
Vapor of hexamethylene diamine is supplied<br>
continuously into the upper part of each of three stages<br>
above the bottom stage.  This vapor and any additional<br>
vapor of diamine or steam formed within the reactor<br>
flows from each stage to the stage above through a<br>
multiplicity of small holes in barrier 25, thus bringing<br>
the vapor into intimate contact with the liquid in the<br>
stage above.  Vapor flowing through the top stage is<br>
continuously removed from the top of the reactor.  Heat<br>
may be supplied at each stage by means of heat sources<br>
19-24 to prevent the formation of solid material.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Near-Infrared Monitoring:  Pre-polymer Method I<br>
In monitoring the exit stream from the column, the<br>
goal is to first measure then control the ends balance<br>
and the conversion.  In the case of the preferred<br>
embodiment, the preparation of nylon 66, the ends<br>
balance and the conversion are specified by determining<br>
any two of the following:  amine ends concentration<br>
([A]), carboxyl ends concentration ([C]), difference of<br>
ends (DE or [C]-[A]) and sum of ends (SE or [C]+[A]).<br>
Polymer relative viscosity (RV) can be used in place of<br>
sum of ends.  The analysis and control may be carried<br>
out essentially continuously.<br>
In a demonstration of the preferred process, the<br>
preparation of nylon 66, near-infrared spectra of the<br>
pre-polymer melt were obtained using a UOP/Guided Wave<br>
Model 300P near-infrared spectrometer.  A pair of 5.5" x<br>
0.25" diameter sapphire-windowed optical transmission<br>
probes (UOP/Guided Wave), available from UOP/Guided<br>
Wave, El Dorado Hills, CA, were inserted directly into<br>
the exit stream of the column using a NIR cell located<br>
at the exit of the column.  The NIR cell consisted of a<br>
block of 316 stainless steel through which perpendicular<br>
holes had been drilled; the pre-polymer melt flowed<br>
through a 5 mm diameter channel the length of the cell;<br><br>
the GW probes were inserted perpendicular to the flow<br>
and held in place with Conax® fittings manufactured by<br>
Conax Buffalo Corp., 2300 Walden Avenue, Buffalo, NY<br>
14225 and Kalrez® (DuPont) seals.  The optical<br>
pathlength between the probes was about 5 mm.  Two flat<br>
band-heaters were placed around the block cell.  The<br>
probes were connected to the spectrometer using<br>
20 meters of jacketed 500 micron single fiber optic<br>
cable (UOP/Guided Wave).<br>
During a three day test run, the near-infrared<br>
monitoring system was programmed to automatically scan<br>
and save an absorbance spectrum (the average of 8 scans)<br>
of the pre-polymer melt once every five minutes.  At<br>
roughly fifteen minute intervals, discrete samples were<br>
taken at the "exit of the column (a few inches beyond the<br>
NIR cell).  The samples were analyzed by titration to<br>
determine the acid and amine end concentrations, [C] and<br>
[A].  See Volume 17 of the "Encyclopedia of Industrial<br>
Chemical Analysis" published by John Wiley and Sons<br>
(1973), page 293.  The lab results were reported as acid<br>
and amine ends, in meq ends/kg polymer, to the nearest<br>
0.1 end.<br>
At the conclusion of the test, the NIR spectra<br>
nearest (within 5 minutes) in time to each of the lab<br>
samples collected were extracted from the spectra in the<br>
data set to give a calibration set of 2 6 samples. The<br>
calibration set spanned a range of 100 to 400 amine ends<br>
and 50 to 170 acid ends.  The calibration spectra were<br>
smoothed and baseline corrected using Scanner 300<br>
software supplied with the UOP/Guided Wave spectrometer.<br>
Partial least squares (PLS) models were developed<br>
using the wavelength region between 1000 and 2100 nm.<br>
PLS models were developed using the Unscrambler® (Camo<br>
A/Sr Trondheim, Norway) chemometrics software package<br>
following the directions supplied by the vendor.  The<br>
use of PLS models is widely known and taught in the open<br>
literature.<br><br>
For amine ends, a two-factor PLS model explained<br>
98.01 of the X-variance and 97.2% of the Y-variance in<br>
the calibration set.  It predicted the pre-polymer<br>
composition with an accuracy (SEP) of 15.8 amine ends<br>
and a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.987.<br>
This calibration set did not contain sufficient<br>
variation to independently model acid ends.<br>
Validation was done by predicting composition data<br>
with this model in real time during subsequent unit<br>
operations.  The model predictions were converted using<br>
an empirical linear equation from amine ends ([A]) to<br>
difference of ends (DE) for operator convenience, since<br>
it was found that over the short term, the amine ends<br>
values and the difference of ends values were highly<br>
correlated.  The resulting DE predictions tracked the<br>
lab results (although with an offset that changed<br>
periodically), responded correctly to known process<br>
changes, and had a repeatability (standard deviation of<br>
consecutive predictions) of 1.3 ends over an hour and<br>
0.95 ends over a ten minute period.<br>
The model obtained in this manner was used to<br>
control the composition of the pre-polymer melt.<br>
Depending on the value of DE obtained, and the desired<br>
value, changes in the column operation were made.<br>
Near-Infrared Monitoring:  Pre-polymer Method II<br>
In monitoring the exit stream from the column, the<br>
goal is to first measure then control the ends balance<br>
and the conversion.  In the case of the preferred<br>
embodiment, the preparation of nylon 66, the ends<br>
balance and conversion are specified by determining any<br>

carboxyl ends concentration ([C]), difference of ends<br>
(DE or [C]-[A]) and sum of ends (SE or [C]+[A]).<br>
Polymer reactive viscosity (RV) can be used in place of<br>
ends.  The analysis and control may be carried out<br>
essentially continuously.<br>
In a demonstration of the preferred process, the<br>
preparation of nylon 66, near-infrared spectra of the<br><br>
pre-polymer melt were obtained using a UOP/Guided Wave<br>
Model 300P near-infrared spectrometer.  A pair of 5.5" x<br>
0.25" diameter sapphire-windowed optical transmission<br>
probes (UOP/Guided Wave) were inserted into sapphire-<br>
windowed stainless steel "sleeves" in a NIR cell located<br>
in the transfer line following the column.  The probes<br>
did not directly contact the pre-polymer melt.  The cell<br>
was heated by hot oil.  The optical pathlength between<br>
the probes was 5 mm.  The probes were connected to the<br>
spectrometer using about 100 meters of jacketed<br>
500 micron single fiber optic cable (UOP/Guided Wave).<br>
The near-infrared monitoring system was programmed<br>
to automatically scan and save an absorbance spectrum<br>
(the average of 8 scans) of the pre-polymer melt once<br>
every fifteen minutes.  Once an hour discrete samples<br>
were taken at the pelletizer at the end of the transfer<br>
line.  The samples were analyzed by titration to<br>
determine the difference of ends, DE, and the amine end<br>
concentration, [A].  The lab results were reported in<br>
meq ends/kg polymer or "ends" to the nearest 0.1 end.<br>
Over a four day period, the NIR spectra nearest<br>
(within 5 minutes) in time to each of the lab samples<br>
collected were extracted from the spectra in the data<br>
set to give a calibration set of 67 samples.  The<br>
calibration set spanned a range of -167.0 to +81.0<br>
difference of ends and 33.0 to 221.A amine ends.  The<br>
calibration spectra were smoothed and baseline corrected<br>
using Scanner 300 software supplied with the UOP/Guided<br>
Wave spectrometer.<br>
Partial least squares (PLS) models were developed<br>
using the wavelength region between 1504 nm and 1576 nm.<br>
The PLS model was developed using the Unscrambler® (Camo<br>
A/S, Trondheim, Norway) chemometrics software package<br>
following the directions supplied by the vendor.  The<br>
use of PLS models is widely known and taught in the open<br>
literature.<br>
For difference of ends, a two-factor PLS model<br>
explained 99.1% of the X-variance and 95.2% of the<br><br>
Y-variance in the calibration set.  It predicted the<br>
pre-polymer composition with an accuracy (SEP) of 13.3<br>
ends and a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.977.<br>
This calibration set did not contain sufficient<br>
variation to independently model sum of ends.<br>
Validation was done by predicting composition data<br>
with this model for a different two day period.  The<br>
model predictions tracked the lab results (though with<br>
an offset that changed periodically) and had a<br>
repeatability (standard deviation of consecutive<br>
predictions) of 1.5 ends over an hour and 0.50 ends over<br>
a ten minute period.<br>
A model obtained in a similar manner was used to<br>
control the composition of the pre-polymer melt.<br>
Depending on the value of DE obtained, and the desired<br>
value, changes in the column operation were made.<br>
Near—Infrared Monitoring:  Acid—rich Feed<br>
In monitoring the exit stream from the acid-rich<br>
makeup vessel (also referred to herein as acid-rich feed<br>
ARF), the goal is to first measure then control the<br>
chemical composition (the relative amount of diacid and<br>
diamine components).  In the case of the preferred<br>
embodiment, the preparation of nylon 66, this is<br>
conveniently expressed as weight percent adipic acid.<br>
If the preparation of the acid rich mixture is carried<br>
out in a continuous fashion, the analysis and control<br>
can also be carried out essentially continuously.<br>
In a demonstration of the preferred process, the<br>
preparation of nylon 66, near-infrared spectra of the<br>
ARF were obtained using a UOP/Guided Wave Model 300P<br>
near-infrared spectrometer.  A pair of 5.5" x 0.25"<br>
diameter sapphire-windowed optical transmission probes<br>
(UOP/Guided Wave) were inserted directly into the 0.25"<br>
tubing exit stream of the acid-rich feed unit using a<br>
Swagelok® cross, available from Swagelok Co., Solon, OH<br>
44139 and two Conax® fittings, equipped with Viton®<br>
O-ring seals, both available from Conax Buffalo Corp.,<br>
2300 Walden Avenue, Buffalo, NY 14225.  The optical<br><br>
pathlength between the probes was about 5 mm.  The<br>
probes were connected to the spectrometer using<br>
20 meters of jacketed 500 micron single fiber optic<br>
cable (UOP/Guided Wave).<br>
During a two day test run the ARF composition was<br>
varied stepwise from 77% adipic acid to 85% adipic acid.<br>
The near-infrared monitoring system was programmed to<br>
automatically scan and save an absorbance spectrum (the<br>
average of 8 scans) of the ARF once every five minutes.<br>
At roughly half-hour intervals, discrete samples were<br>
taken at the exit of the ARF unit (a few inches beyond<br>
the NIR probes).  The samples were analyzed by<br>
titration.  Twenty five grams of acid-rich feed were<br>
dissolved in 325 mL of water at 25°C.  The solution was<br>
titrated with a 50% by weight solution of hexamethylene<br>
diamine in water to a potentiometric endpoint of<br>
7.600 pH.  (The calculations assumed a sample moisture<br>
level of 2.0% and no conversion of diacid and diamine to<br>
nylon 66 pre-polymer.)  The lab results were reported as<br>
weight percent adipic acid (dry basis) to the nearest<br>
0.1%.<br>
At the conclusion of the test, the NIR spectra<br>
nearest (within 5 minutes) in time to each of the lab<br>
samples were extracted from the spectra in the data set<br>
to give a calibration set of 57 spectra.  The<br>
calibration spectra were smoothed and baseline corrected<br>
using Scanner 300 software supplied with the UOP/Guided<br>
Wave spectrometer.<br>
Partial least squares (PLS) models were developed<br>
using the wavelength region between 1000 nm and 1670 nm.<br>
The PLS models were developed using the Unscrambler®<br>
(Camo A/S, Trondheim, Norway) chemometrics software<br>
package following the directions supplied by the vendor.<br>
The use of PLS models is widely known and taught in the<br>
open literature.  A two-factor PLS model explained 99.6%<br>
of the X-variance and 97.3% of the Y-variance in the<br>
calibration set.  It predicted the ARF composition with<br><br>
an accuracy <sep of adipic acid and a correlation></sep>
coefficient (R) of 0.989.<br>
Validation was done by predicting composition data<br>
with this model for the other obtained spectra.  The<br>
model predictions tracked the lab results, responded<br>
correctly to known process changes, and had a<br>
repeatability (standard deviation of consecutive<br>
predictions) of 0.03% adipic acid.<br>
Further validation was done by predicting<br>
composition data with this model in real time during a<br>
subsequent test run.  During this run the model<br>
predictions tracked the lab results (although with an<br>
offset of about -0.6% adipic acid), responded correctly<br>
to known process changes, and had a repeatability of<br>
0.02% adipic acid.<br>
The model obtained in this manner was used to<br>
control the composition of the ARF.  Depending on the<br>
value of % adipic acid obtained, and the desired value,<br>
changes in the reactant ratios were made.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A molten acid-rich mixture, consisting of 81% by<br>
weight of adipic acid and 19% by weight of hexamethylene<br>
diamine was supplied continuously to the top of a 4 inch<br>
diameter vertical reactor.  The reactor was divided into<br>
eight stages, each stage separated from the stage above<br>
and below it by a horizontal perforated barrier.<br>
Reactor temperature was controlled so that a temperature<br>
gradient existed, with the top stage held at 178°C and<br>
the bottom stage at 27 6°C.  Liquid flowed from each<br>
stage to the stage below it through an opening in the<br>
barrier that was fitted with a tube leading into and<br>
below the surface of the reaction mixture in the stage<br>
below.  Liquid flowing through the bottom stage was<br>
continuously removed from the bottom of the reactor.<br>
Vapor of hexamethylene diamine was supplied<br>
continuously into the upper part of each of three stages<br>
above the bottom stage.  This vapor and any additional<br>
vapor of diamine or steam formed within the reactor<br><br>
flowed from each stage to the stage above through a<br>
multiplicity of small holes in the barrier, thus<br>
bringing the vapor into intimate contact with the liquid<br>
in the stage above.  Vapor flowing through the top stage<br>
was continuously removed from the top of the reactor.<br>
Heat was supplied at each stage to prevent the formation<br>
of solid material.<br>
The liquid leaving the bottom of the vessel was<br>
analyzed and found to have a carboxyl end content<br>
between 69 and 156 gram equivalents per million grams of<br>
sample, an amine end content of between 38 and 136, and<br>
a Relative Viscosity of between 18 and 28 (as measured<br>
at 25°C as a 8.4% by weight solution in a solvent<br>
consisting of 90% formic acid and 10% water and compared<br>
with the viscosity of the solvent at 25°C).  Based on<br>
the end group content, the number average molecular<br>
weight of the polymer product was 10,500.<br>
The vapor leaving the top of the reactor was<br>
analyzed and found to contain less than 100 parts per<br>
million by weight of hexamethylene diamine.  This means<br>
a loss of diamine of 0.000016 parts by weight per part<br>
of polymer.  Typical commercial processes for making<br>
ny.ion 66 lose between 0.001 and 0.002 parts of diamine<br>
per part of polymer produced.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
A molten acid-rich mixture, consisting of 81% by<br>
weight of adipic acid and 19% by weight of hexamethylene<br>
diamine was supplied continuously to the top of a<br>
vertical reactor at a rate of approximately 200 pounds<br>
per hour.  The reactor was 15.5 inches in internal<br>
diameter and about 17 feet high.  It was divided into<br>
eight stages, each separated from the stage above and<br>
below it by a horizontal perforated barrier.  Liquid<br>
flowed from each stage to the stage below through an<br>
opening in the barrier that was fitted with a tube<br>
leading into and below the surface of the reaction<br>
mixture in the stage below.  Liquid flowing through the<br>
bottom stage was continuously removed from the bottom of<br><br>
the reactor.  Vapor of hexamethylene diamine was<br>
supplied continuously into the upper part of each of the<br>
three stages above the bottom stage.  Total flow of<br>
diamine was approximately 89 pounds per hour.  This<br>
vapor and any additional vapor of diamine or steam<br>
formed within the reactor flowed from each stage to the<br>
stage above through a multiplicity of small holes in the<br>
barrier, thus bringing it into intimate contact with the<br>
liquid in the stage above.  Vapor flowing through the<br>
top stage was continuously removed from the top of the<br>
reactor.  Heat was supplied to each stage as required to<br>
prevent the formation of solid material.  The polymeric<br>
material leaving the bottom of the reactor passed<br>
through a length of pipe before being sampled.  The<br>
average residence time in the pipe was about six<br>
minutes, which provided time for additional reaction in<br>
the liquid.  The liquid leaving the end of the pipe was<br>
analyzed and found to have an average carboxyl end<br>
content of 111.5 (plus or minus 20) gram equivalents per<br>
million grams of sample, an average amine end content of<br>
71 (plus or minus 13), and an average Relative Viscosity<br>
of 25.1 (plus or minus 3); the RV was calculated based<br>
on the sum of the carboxyl and amine ends using a<br>
standard formula.  Based on the end group content, the<br>
number average molecular weight of the polymer product<br>
was 10,960.  These results were obtained during a period<br>
of continuous operation of 31 hours.<br><br>
