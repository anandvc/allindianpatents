				<td>The present invention relates to a colorable or transparent elastomeric composition<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Rubber compositions are used in a variety of applications, including tire components such as treads and sidewalls, '.hoses, belts, solid tires, rollers for graphic arts applications,.footwear components, vibration isolation devices.and bladders. While the particular rubber compositions used in each of these applications vary widely in their physical properties, one attribute remains the same - their color. Most rubber compositions are black. Furthermore, most rubber compositions eventually become discolored due to heat, light, o;:one, etc. This is particularly true for rubbers used in stressful, demanding applications such as tire treads, sidewalls, bladders, belts and hoses.<br>
Practitioners in this field will point to the presence of the; reinforcing filler "carbon black" as a prime reasoa that most rubbers are black. While this is true, carbon black, is not the only factor. In fact, a wide variety of other fillers, curatives, antidegradants, oils and the rubbers themselves can all result in a dark color that is essentially impossible to pigment. This is evident in compositions where carbon black has been replaced with a silica filler and i:he rubber is still discolored. For example, European Patent 0 682 071 Bl, discloses a silica reinforced tire tread which, due to the presence of the aromatic processing oil,<br>
coupling agent, antidegradants and a sulfur curative system, wi.l still be dark in color. Tn fact, it is uncertain how many of the ingredients present in the rubber composition would have to be changed to produce a colorable composition.<br>
Of course, same colorable and transparent elastomeric compositions do exist. For example, clear EPDM elastomers are available. However, these elastomers do not effectively covulcanize with other rubbers. Since many rubber applications involve combining several types of rubber to form a single article (i.e. tires), these EPDM elastomers are limited in their usefulness.<br>
White sidewalls on tires are a form of colorable rubber. The white color is achieved by using fillers such as silica, clay, talc and carbonates :nstead of carbon black and adding titanium dioxide as a whitening pigment. However, the white color comes with a price The fillers are more fragile than carbon black and result in a weak rubber composition that does not reinforce the tire, Therefore, the rubbers used for whi:e sidewalls are also limited in their usefulness.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides improved transparen- and colorable elastomeric compositions. The transparent elastomeric compositions can be covulcanized with aibbers such as polybutadiene, polyisoprene, styrene-butadiene rubber, styrene-isoprene-butadiene rubber, isoprene-butadiene lubber, ethylene-propylene diene rubber or natural aibber The colorable rubber compositions have sufficient properties to function as a reinforcing member in an automobile tire. Preferably, both the transparent and colorable elastomeric compositions include at least one copolymer of a C4 to C7 isoolefm and a para-alkylstyrene, silica and a coupling agent.<br>
The elastomeric compositions of the present invention are useful in a variety of applications, particularly pneumatic tire components, hoses, belts, solid tires, footwear components, rollers for graphic arts applications, vibration isolation devices, pharmaceudcal devices, adhesives, sealants, protective coatings and bladders for fluid retention and curing purposes.<br>
Accordingly,    there    is    provided    a    colorable    or   transparent elastomeric composition comprising:<br>

c)	a paraffinic processing aid as herein described<br>
wherein the colorable or transparent elastomeric composition has a ChromaMeter L value of greater than 55,<br><br><br>
A colorable or transparent elastomeric composition produced by the process of the present invention is neither a product of chemical reaction nor a product obtained by mere admixture resulting only in the aggregation of properties of the components thereof and is in fact a synergistic mixture having improved and unexpected properties.<br>

In another embodiment of the present invention, an elastomer blend is produced which is colorable. The term "colorable", as used herein, is defined as the ability of the base elastomeric composition to be pigmented to afford a variety of colored compositions These compositions typically do net contain carbon black.<br><br>
The colorable: rubber compositions of the present invention have sufficient properties to function as a reinforcing member in an automobile tire. Preferably, they have sufficient properties to function as an automobile tire tread. The colorable rubber compositions of the present invention preferably contain at least one copolymer of a C4 to C7 isoolefm and a para-alkylstyrene. More preferably, the copolymer is a terpolymer of isobutylene, para-methylstyrene and bromo para-methylstyrene,<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the colorable rubber compositions of the present invention contain from 10 to 100 parts, per hundred parts rubber, of a copolymer of a C4 to C7 isoolefin and a para-alkylstyrene; from 10 to 100 parts of silica; and from 0 to 20 weigh: percent of a coupling agent, based on the weight of silica.

The colorable rubber compounds of the present invention are useful in making colored elastomeric products capable of meeting current performance requirements. These colorable compounds were produced by replacing carbon black- filler with a non-staining mineral filler such as, but not lint ted to, fumed or precipitated silicas, clays, talcs, calcium carbonates, aluminum oxides, titanium oxides, silicon oxides and zinc oxides. The mineral filler must reinforce the polymer system and not inhibit pigmentation to be effective. In addition, the remaining coraponents of the colorable compound were selected on the basis that they will not interfere with the colorable nature of the elastomer. The cured, colorable compounds of the present invention still have the same dynamic and physical properties that meet the performance demands of current black-colored tire treads.<br>
As stated above, all components of the transparent and colorable elastomeric compositions must be carefully selected so that they will not interfere with the transparency and/or colorability of the composition. ;.7or example, the elastomers, fillers, processing aids, antidegradants and curatives should not discolor the composition during the formation of the elastomeric composition. Furthermore, the components should not discolor the elastomeric composition as a result of exposure to light (including UV), heat, oxygen, ozone and strain,<br>
The fillers of the present invention may be any size and typically range, e.g., in the tire industry, from about 0.0001 to about 100 microns. As usjd herein, silica is meant to refer to any type or particle size silica or another silicic acid derivative, or silicic acid, processed by solution, pyrogeoic or the like methods and having a surface area, including untreated, precipitated silica, crystalline silica, colloidal silica, aluminum or calcium silicates, fumed silica, and the like.<br>
One or more coupling agents are preferably used in the elastomeric compositions of the present invention. More preferably, the coupling agent is a bifunctional organosilane cross-linking agent. By an "organosilane cross-linking<br>
agent" is meant any silane coupled filler and/or cross linking activator and/or silane reinforcing agent kncwn to those skilled in the art including, but not limited to, vinyl triethoxysilane, vinyl-tris-(beta-methoxyethoxy)silane, gammi-methacryloylpropyltrimethoxysilane, gamma-amino-propyl triethoxysilane (sold commercially as "Al 100" by Witco), gamma-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane and the like, and mixture!: thereof. In a preferred embodiment, bis-(3(lriethoxysily!)-propyl)-tetrasulfane (sold commercially as "Si69" by Degussa) is employed,<br>
The copolymer of a C4 to C7 isoolefin and a para-aikylstyr«:ne of the present invention also encompasses terpolymers of a C4 to C7 isoolefin, para-alkylstyrene and halogenated para-alkylstyrene. The percentages of para-alkylstyrene and halogenation can vary widely. Different applications may require dramatically different formulations. Generally, the copolymer of the present invention will have from 2 wt. % to 20 wt. % para-alkylstyrene (preferably para-msthylstyrene). In addition, the copolymer of the present invention will have from 0 20 mol % to 2.0 mol % of a halogenated compound, such as bromomethylstyrene.<br>
Preferably, lew levels of either bromine and/or para-alkylstyrene are used. In a preferred embodiment, para-alkylstyrene (preferably para-methylstyrene) comprises from 5 wt. % to 10 wt. % of the copolymer. More preferably, it is less than 10 wt. % of the; copolymer. In another preferred embodiment, a halogenated compound, such as bromomethylstyrene comprises from 0.40 mol % to 3.0 mol % of the copolymer More preferably, it comprises from 0,50 mol % to 1.25 mol % of the copolymer. Most preferably, it is about 0.75 mol % of the copolymer.<br>
The compositions produced in accordance with the present invention may also contain other compcnents and additives customarily used in rubbsr mixes, such as effective amounts oi:' nondiscolored and nondiscoloring processing aids, pigments, accelerators, cross-linking and curing materials, antioxidants, antiozonants, fillers and naphthenic, aromatic or paraffinic extender oils if the presence of an extension oil is desired. Processing aids include, but are not limited to, plasticizers, tackifiers, extenders, chemical conditioners, homogenizing agents and peptizers such as mercaptans, petroleum and vulcanized vegetable oils, waxes, resins, rosins, and the like. Accelerators include amines, guanidines, thioureas, thiazoles, thiurams,<br><br>
sulfenamides, sulfisnimides, thiocarbamates, xanthates, and the like. Cross-linking and curing agents include sulfur, zinc oxide, and fatty acids. Pe'oxide cure systems may also be used. Fillers include mineral fillers such as silica and clay.<br>
The present invention provides improved elastomeric compositions comprising a copolymer of a C4 to C7 isoolefin and a para-alkylstyrene, silica and, optionally, one or more coupling agents. These compositions exhibit improved properties including improved abrasion resistance, reduced cul. growth, improved adhesion, reduced heat build-up, and retention of mechanical properties during severe heat build-up conditions such as those experienced in "run-flat" tires and engine mounts for transportation vehicles. The substantially isoolefin (isobutylene) backbone elastomer is a key element in that it imparts a self-liiriting heat build-up. At lower temperatures, these elastomers exhibit high damping behavior which dissipates mechanical energy in the form of heat. However, as the elastomer heats up, the damping behavior diminishes and the behavior of the elastomer in more elastic and less dis<iipative.></iipative.>
Generally, polymer blends, e.g., those used to produce tires, are crosslinked. It is known that the physical properties, performance characteristics, and durability of vulcanized rubber compounds are directly related to the number (crosslink density) and type of crosslinks formed during the vulcanization reaction. (See, e.g., The Post Vulcanization Stabilization for NR, WF Helt, B.H. To &amp; W.W. Paris, Rubber World, August 1991, pp. 18-23 which is incorporated by reference herein.) Generally, polymer blends may be crosslinked by adding curative molecules, for example sulfur, metal oxides (i.e., zinc oxide), organometallic compounds, radical initiators, etc followed by heating. This method may be accelerated and is often used for i;he vulcanization of elastomer blends. The mechanism for accelerated vulcanization of natural rubber involves complex interactions between the curative, accelerator, activators and polymers. Ideally, all of the available curative is consumed in the formation of effective crosslinks wlu'ch join together two polymer chains and enhance the overall strength of the polymer matrix. Numerous curatives are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, the following: zinc oxide, stearic acid, tetramethytthiuram disulfide (TMTD), 4,4-dithjodimorpholine (DTDM), tetrabutyjthiuram disulfide (TBTD),<br>
benzothiazyl disulfide (MBTS), hexamethylene-l,6-bisthiosulfaie disodium salt dihydrate (sold commercially as DURALINK HTS by Flexsys), ;2-(rnorpholinothio) benzothiazole (MBS or MOR), blends of 90% MOR and 10% MBTS (MOR 90), and N-oxydiethylene thiocarbamyl-N-oxydiethylene sulfonamide (OTOS) zinc 2-ethyl hexanoate (ZEH). In addition, various vulcanization systems are known in the art. (For example, see Formulation Design and Curing Characteristics of NBR Mixes for Seals, Rubber Wbrld, September 1993, pp. 25-30 which is incorporated by reference herein)<br>
The materials are mixed by conventional means known 1o those skilled in the art, in a single s:ep or in stages. For example, the elastomers of this invention can be processed in one step. In a preferred embodiment, the silica and silane are added in a different stage from zinc oxide and other cure activators and accelerators In a more preferred embodiment, antioxidants, antiozonants and processing materials are added in a stage after silica and silane have been processed with the rubber, and zinc oxide is added at a final stage to maximize compound modulus. Thus, a two to three (or more) stage processing sequence is preferred. Additional stages may involve incremental additions of filler and processing oils.<br>
INDUSTRIAL UTILITY<br>
The elastorneric compositions of the present invention are not only transparent, but can be covulcanized with other rubbers. This results in a transparent elastomer that can be used in wide variety of applicat ons outside of the uses for known transparent elastomers. For example, the transparent elastorneric compositions of the present invention can be used in tires.<br>
The colorable elastorneric compositions of the present invention exhibit improved hysteretic properties, traction, heat stability and retention of properties upon aging to known colorable elastomers. This results in colorable rubber compositions which have sufficient properties to function, as a reinforcing member in an automobile tire. The colorable rubber will allow a manufacturer to produce a tire with improved product appearance.<br>
The elastorneric compositions of the present invention are useful in a variety of applications, particularly pneumatic tire components, hoses, belts, solid tires, footwear components, rollers for graphic arts applications, vibration isolation devices, pharmaceutical devices, adhesives, sealants, protective coatings and bladders for fluid retention and curing purposes.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example  I<br>
Experiments were conducted to produce transparent elastomers. Master batches of EXXF'RO™ Elastomers (a terpolymer of isobutylene, para-methylstyrene and bromo para-methylstyrene, commercially available from Exxon Chemical Company) of varying bromination level, comononer content, and molecular weight were prepared. The copolymers had the properties listed in Table 1.<br>
Table 1. Properties of the Copolymers<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Test compositions were compounded to blend the master batch, components and the cure additives listed in Table 2. FLEXON 785 is a naphthenic petroleum oil. DIAK #1 is hexamethylene diamine carbonate, available from Du Pont/Dow elastomers. DPG is diphenylguanidine.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
The test compositions (A through F) were tested for cure characteristics, hardness and tensile strength. The results are presented in Table 3.<br>
Table 3. Properties of Test Compositions A-F<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The samples all demonstrated contact transparency.<br>
Example 2.<br>
A Minolta CR-100 ChromaMeter was used to quantitatively determine the lightness (L*), red-green (a*) and yellow-blue (b*) colors of cured compounds in order to maximize tight through-put (a measure of transparency) and to minimize or adjust the color. The ability to read print through these cured rubber compounds v/as also used as a subjective evaluation of the contact transparency of the ingredients in the formulation. Statistically designed experiments varying ingredients, and statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) for effects on compound cure, physical, and color properties were made.<br>
Eight formulations of EXXPRO™ elastomers with statistically varying para-methylstyrene and bromomethylstyrene levels were evaluated in a simple compound prepared only with precipitated silica and a zinc oxids/zinc stearate cure system. It was established that low levels of either bromine and/or para-methylstyrene provided the highest L* values with low, but not negative, a* and b* values, see Table 4 EXXPRO™ S9-1 (5 wt-% pMS, 0.75 mol-% Br) afforded the highest L* and lowest a* and b* values.<br><br>
Table 4. Optical Properties of EXXPROTM  Rubber Compounds<br><br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 3<br>
Ten curative types thought useful in co-curing with the other sulfur-vulcanized tire compounds were screened. Acceptable curatives were zinc oxide/stearic acid; zinc oxide/zinc stearate; Hexamethylene-l:6-bis(thiosulphate) disodium salt dihydrate (sold commercially as DURALINK HTS by Flexsys)/zinc stearate; DURALINK HTS/zinc oxide; and 1.3-Bis(citraconiiridoraethyl)benzene (sold commercially as PERKALINK 900 by Flexsys)/zinc stearate, since their use afforded transparent compounds from nearly colorless to a yellow or beige color. Butyl zimate/zinc stearate afforded a transparent, light brown-colored compound. The use of CBS (N-cycIohexyl-2-ben70thiazole sulfenamide) afforded a beige compound, amylphenyl disulfide polymer (18.5-21% sulfur) (sold commercially as VULTAC 5 by Elf Atochem North America) afforded a grey compound, and Al 100 afforded a brown compound; none were visibly transparent based on the ability to read print.<br>
Example 4<br>
Precipitated silicas made via an aqueous acidification process were screened using EX:£PROlM 89-1 as the elastomer and Duralink HTS/ zinc stearate as the curative system It was observed that for precipitated silicas having approximately the same CTAB surface area (approximately 170 m2/g), use of a precipitated silica having a higher salt content afforded a brown-colored transparent compound (Zeosil 1165MP from Rhone Poulenc) compared to lower salt-content precipitated silicas which afforded yellow-colored transparent compounds. Use of a precipitated silica prepared using CD2/hydrogen chloride as the acids (Hi-Sil 243LD from PPG) is more desirable than cne prepared using sulftiric acid (Zeopol 8745 from J. M. Huber) since the former afforded a fainter-yellow transparent compound. Use of a higher surface area, low salt-containing precipitated silica (Hi-Sil I95G from PPG) is more desirable since it appeared to afford a more contact transparent compound, and improved cured compound physical properties Use of a high surface area famed silica made via a gas phase condensation process, which affords a silica with essentially no silt (Cab-O-Sil MS from Cabot) is desirable for optical properties.<br>
Example 5<br>
Transparent cured EXXPRO™ compounds were prepared in blends with cis-polyisoprene and/or cis-polybutadiene using precipitated and fumed silicas as the fillers, and a sulfur curing system. All cured compounds were contact transparent, but had a yellow to brown color depending upon the specific ingredients, and afforded compounds with physical properties gppropriate for use in a variety of rubber applications. Examples are shown in Table 5.<br>
Table 5.  Formulations and Properties of Transparent Rubber Compounds<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 6<br>
A formulation for a colorable tire tread was prepared, see Table 6. This formulation differs from a standard tire tread formulation in several ways. For example, EXXPRC™ polymers are used instead of an equal weight of solution-<br>
polymerized SBR to improve cured compound dynamic and physical properties. Also, Si69 is used as the silane-coupling agent instead of the more common X50S (which is 50% by weight Si69 carried on N330 carbon black). In addition, no antiozonant is used since this can also stain or discolor the tread composition. Compound colorability can be further improved by using titanium, dioxide as a non-reinforcing, but whitening pigment<br>

Example 7<br>
The viscoelnstic nature of EXXPRO™ elastomers increases the loss modulus (G") or tar.gent delta values of the cured compound measured at 0°C, see Figure 1. This dynamic value is a laboratory test useful in predicting the wet traction performance of tread compounds on tires. A higher value is desirable. The tangent delta value measured at 60°C in lab instruments is reduced when using EXXPRO™ elastomers (see Figure 1) indicating a lower heat build-up value. This is predictive of tire rolling resistance. A lower value is desirable. The complex modulus value (G*) measured at 60°C is used as a lab predictor of the dry handling, or cornering, characteristics of the tread compound on the tire. A higher value is needed whun a higher speed rated tire (i.e. H-, V-, Z-rated) is desirable. The magnitude of these benefits when using EXXPRO™ elastomers is also dependent on the particular polymers used in the blend system. The addition of an<br>
EXXPRO™ elastomer will improve one or more of these dynamic properties, see Table 7.<br><br>
