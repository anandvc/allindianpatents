				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
NON-CONTACT POWER SUPPLY SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a non-contact power supply-<br>
system in which induction lines fed with high-frequency current<br>
of a predetermined frequency are placed along the moving path<br>
of a moving body, a pickup coil is provided in the moving body<br>
to face the induction lines, and power is fed from electromotive<br>
force induced to the pickup coil to a load varying in power<br>
consumption in the moving body.<br>
Background Art<br>
Some conventional non-contact power supply systems have<br>
long induction lines . In such a non-contact power supply system,<br>
since voltage applied to an induction line is limited, the<br>
induction line is divided and each of the divided lines is<br>
connected to a power supply unit.<br>
In such a non-contact power supply system, even when power<br>
supply units supply high-frequency currents at the same<br>
frequency to induction lines, a phase difference occurs between<br>
the high-frequency currents. When the pickup coil of a moving<br>
body is disposed across the induction lines having such a phase<br>
difference, electromotive force induced to the pickup coil<br>
is reduced. Further, when the phase difference reaches 180°,<br>
electromotive force induced to the pickup coil is generated<br>
in opposite directions, power feeding is disabled, and the<br>
outputs of two power supply units are short-circuited through<br>
the pickup coil, resulting in overcurrent or the like.<br>
Thus, as is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.<br>
3266088, waveforms of high-frequency currents fed to two<br>
induction lines are respectively detected and measured by a<br>
current transformer (CT), the phases of the high-frequency<br>
currents of the two induction lines are compared with each<br><br>
other to detect a phase difference therebetween in a PLL/VCO<br>
circuit, and a high-frequency current corrected according to<br>
the phase difference is supplied as a high-frequency current<br>
to one of the induction lines.<br>
However, such a conventional non-contact power supply<br>
system requires a current transformer (CT) for a wide frequency<br>
domain in order to actually measure the waveforms of<br>
high-frequency currents and a PLL/VCO circuit for comparing<br>
the measured waveforms of the high-frequency currents of<br>
induction lines to detect a phase difference and performing<br>
synchronization, resulting in high cost. Further, phase<br>
differences may not be matched when the waveform of the<br>
high-frequency current of one of the induction lines cannot<br>
be measured.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
non-contact power supply system at a low cost, which can match<br>
current phases between induction lines without measuring the<br>
waveform of high-frequency current.<br>
In order to attain the object, the present invention<br>
provides a non-contact power supply system in which a plurality<br>
of induction lines adjusted to the same impedance at a<br>
predetermined frequency are sequentially placed along a moving<br>
path of a moving body, the system comprising a power supply<br>
units each transforming direct current to alternating current<br>
of the predetermined frequency by means of a plurality of<br>
switching devices driven by a rectangular wave signal and<br>
feeding the current as output current to the induction lines,<br>
the moving body including a pickup coil facing the induction<br>
lines, the moving body having a loadof varying power consumption,<br>
the load being fed with power from electromotive force induced<br>
to the pickup coil. The primary characteristic is that the<br>
power supply unit has a command signal of the predetermined<br>
frequency to drive the switching devices, the power supply<br><br>
unit includes a measuring unit for measuring power consumption<br>
and output current fed to the induction lines and a calculation<br>
unit for determining a phase difference between the output<br>
current fed to the induction lines and the rectangular wave<br>
signal based on the output current and power consumption<br>
measured by the measuring unit, and the power supply unit<br>
advances or delays the rectangular wave signal in response<br>
to the command signal according to the phase difference<br>
determined by the calculation unit, and drives the switching<br>
devices.<br>
According to the configuration of the present invention,<br>
the power supply unit determines a phase difference between<br>
the output current fed to the induction lines and the rectangular<br>
wave signal based on the output current and power consumption<br>
measured by the measuring unit, and the rectangular wave signal<br>
for driving transistors is corrected according to the phase<br>
difference relative to the command signal and then outputted,<br>
so that the current phases of the induction lines can be matched.<br>
The current phases are advanced or delayed by the rectangular<br>
wave signal due to a reduction or increase in the power<br>
consumption of the induction lines. Further, the present<br>
invention does not require the current waveform of the other<br>
induction line and it is not necessary to compare waveforms<br>
to detect a phase difference, thereby reducing cost with a<br>
simple configuration.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will be discussed<br>
below in accordance with the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a travel path diagram showing an article transport<br>
apparatus including a non-contact power supply system according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 2 is a principle<br><br>
part structural diagram showing the article transport<br>
apparatus.<br>
In FIGS. 1 and 2, reference numeral 1 denotes a pair of<br>
transport rails arranged on a floor 2 and reference numeral<br>
3 denotes a four-wheel article transport vehicle (an example<br>
of a moving body) which travels by itself and transports an<br>
article R while being guided along the transport rails 1. The<br>
total number of the article transport vehicles 3 is five.<br>
The transport rails 1 make up a transport path (an example<br>
of a moving path) 4 shaped like a loop (ring). A plurality<br>
of (nine in FIG. 9) stations (article receiving units) 5 are<br>
placed along the transport path 4. The article transport<br>
vehicles 3 travel along the transport path and make up a transport<br>
vehicle for transporting articles among the article receiving<br>
units placed along the transport path.<br>
Each of the stations 5 includes, as a unit for transporting<br>
the articles R to and from the article transport vehicles 3,<br>
a transfer conveyor (for example, a roller conveyor, a chain<br>
conveyor, and so on) 6 for carrying in/out the articles R.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the article transport vehicle 3<br>
comprises a body 11, a transfer/loading conveyor 12, two<br>
rotatively suspended wheel devices 13, and two rotary/sliding<br>
driving wheel devices 14.<br>
The transfer/loading conveyor 12 includes a roller<br>
conveyor and a chain conveyor which are placed on the body<br>
11 to transfer and load the articles R. The two rotatively<br>
suspended wheel devices 13 are attached to the bottom of the<br>
body 11 and support the body 11 on one of the transport rails<br>
1. The two rotary/sliding driving wheel devices 14 are attached<br>
to the bottom of the body 11 and support the body 11 on the<br>
other transport rail 1. The rotary/sliding driving wheel<br>
devices 14 can follow the curve of the transport rail 1 and<br>
freely (slidably) move far from and close to the rotatively<br>
suspended wheel devices 13. A transport motor (an example of<br>
a load of varying power consumption) 15 is connected to one<br><br>
of the rotary/sliding driving wheel devices 14. The article<br>
transport vehicle 3 is moved by the driving of the transport<br>
motor 15.<br>
Further, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, pairs of upper and<br>
lower induction lines 19 divided into six are sequentially<br>
laid (placed) over the outer side of one of the transport rails<br>
1 along the traveling direction. A pickup unit 20 where<br>
electromotive force is induced by the induction lines 19 is<br>
placed outside one of the rotatively suspended wheel devices<br>
13. In the pickup unit 20, a Litz wire is wound around a convex<br>
portion at the center of a ferrite, which is shaped like letter<br>
E in cross section, to form a pickup coil (a pickup coil facing<br>
the induction lines 19) 20A (FIG. 4) . The induction lines 19<br>
are adjusted and fixed so as to be centered on the respective<br>
concave portions of the ferrite. The electromotive force<br>
induced to the pickup coil (pickup coil) 20A feeds power to<br>
the transport motor 15. Moreover, power supply units 21 (six<br>
in total) for supplying high-frequency current of a<br>
predetermined frequency f (for example, 10 kHz) are connected<br>
to the induction lines 19, respectively.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, a capacitor 23 is connected in series<br>
with each of the induction lines 19 and a variable inductor<br>
22 is connected in series with each of the induction lines<br>
19. The variable inductor 22 makes it possible to adjust the<br>
impedance of the predetermined frequency f of the overall<br>
induction lines by adjusting an inductance value . The variable<br>
inductor 22 is connected when the length (line length) of the<br>
induction line 19 does not reach a predetermined length, in<br>
other words, when the inductance value of the induction line<br>
19 does not reach a predetermined inductance value.<br>
An inductance L of the variable inductor 22 and a<br>
capacitance C of the capacitor 23 are adjusted (set) such that<br>
the impedance (the impedance of the overall induction lines)<br>
of the induction lines 19, the capacitor 23, and the variable<br>
inductor 22, which are connected in series, is a capacitive<br><br>
reactance at the predetermined frequency f (for example, 10<br>
kHz) .<br>
In FIG. 5(α) , reference character Lu denotes the inductance<br>
of the induction line 19, the inductance being determine by<br>
the length of the induction line 19, reference character rU<br>
denotes a resistance, reference character R denotes a primary<br>
equivalent resistance (hereinafter referred to as a load<br>
resistance) corresponding to the load of the five article<br>
transport vehicles 3, and reference character ω denotes an<br>
angular frequency at the predetermined frequency (for example,<br>
10 kHz) of the induction lines 19. In order that the impedance<br>
of the capacitor 23 can be larger than the impedance of the<br>
variable inductor 22 and the induction lines 19, that is, the<br>
impedance can be a capacitive reactance, an adjustment is made<br>
as follows:<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 5(b), thesetvalue δ is set such that an impedance<br>
M is equal to a predetermined small value (for example, 1 Ω)<br>
when all the article transport vehicles 3 are stopped and the<br>
load resistance R is absent (R = 0). The impedance M is<br>
determined based on the resistance rU of the induction lines<br>
19 and an impedance G determined by subtracting the impedance<br>
of the variable inductor 22 and the induction lines 19 from<br>
the impedance of the capacitor 23. The set value S limits a<br>
difference between the impedance of the capacitor 23 and the<br>
impedance of the variable inductor 22 and the induction lines<br>
19. In this way, the impedance of the overall induction lines<br>
is not set at zero, so that even when the load resistance R<br>
fluctuates, it is possible to reduce fluctuations in current<br>
(output power I) passing through the induction lines 19.<br>
Since the impedance of the capacitor 23 is inversely<br>
proportional to the capacitance C of the capacitor, the<br>
capacitance C of the capacitor is reduced to increase the<br><br>
impedance of the capacitor 23. Thus, it is possible to achieve<br>
a simple adjustment and lower cost as compared with an adjustment<br>
for increasing the inductance L of the variable inductor 22.<br>
In this way, a beneficial effect can be obtained when the<br>
impedance of the capacitor 23 is set larger than the impedance<br>
of the variable inductor 22 and the induction lines 19, that<br>
is, when the impedance of the overall induction lines is set<br>
as a capacitive reactance.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3(α), the power supply units 21 are<br>
connected in series via signal transmission lines 18. A<br>
synchronization signal (an example of a command signal) a of<br>
a rectangular wave (not necessarily a rectangular wave) at<br>
the predetermined frequency (for example, 10 kHz) is<br>
transmitted from a specific power supply unit (hereinafter<br>
referred to as a master power supply unit) 21a to a power supply<br>
unit (hereinafter referred to as a slave power supply unit)<br>
21b connected downstream. And then, the signal is sequentially<br>
transmitted (inputted/transferred) to the power supply units<br>
21b connected in series. In each of the master power supply<br>
unit 21a and the slave power supply units 21b, as shown in<br>
FIG. 3(b), a reference pulse generator circuit 24, a phase<br>
adjustment circuit 29, and a phase difference detection circuit<br>
30 are provided. The phase adjustment circuit 29 compensates<br>
for a delay of the synchronization signal a outputted from<br>
the reference pulse generator circuit 24 and transmits the<br>
signal to the power supply unit 21b connected downstream. The<br>
delay is caused by the line length of the signal transmission<br>
line 18 between the power supply units (21a and 21b) or 21b.<br>
The phase difference detection circuit 30 detects a phase<br>
difference between the synchronization signal a transmitted<br>
from the phase adjustment circuit 29 and a synchronization<br>
signal (return synchronization signal) fed back from the<br>
downstream power supply unit 21b to which the synchronization<br>
signal a has been transmitted. The phase adjustment circuit<br>
29 advances (corrects) the phase of the synchronization signal<br><br>
a, which has been outputted from the reference pulse generator<br>
circuit 24, according to the phase difference detected by the<br>
phase difference detection circuit 30, and transmits the signal<br>
to the downstream power supply unit 21b. The phase adjustment<br>
circuit 29 and the phase difference detection circuit 30<br>
compensate for a phase delay of the synchronization signal<br>
a, the phase delay being caused by the line length of the signal<br>
transmission line 18. And then, the synchronization signal<br>
a is transmitted to the downstream slave power supply unit<br>
21b. Insulating amplifiers 17 are provided on the transmission<br>
end and the reception end of the signal transmission line 18.<br>
The reference pulse generator circuit 24 of the master<br>
power supply unit 21a comprises a synchronization signal<br>
generator circuit 25 for outputting a master synchronization<br>
signal a of a rectangular wave of the predetermined frequency.<br>
The reference pulse generator circuit 24 outputs the master<br>
synchronization signal a of the synchronization signal<br>
generator circuit 25 as a synchronization signal (hereinafter<br>
referred to as a drive synchronization signal) β for driving<br>
a transistor 52 (described later).<br>
The reference pulse generator circuit 24 of the slave power<br>
supply unit 21b comprises an abnormal synchronization signal<br>
detection section 26, a relay 27, and a backup synchronization<br>
signal generator circuit 28. The abnormal synchronization<br>
signal detection section 26 returns the received<br>
synchronization signal a as the return synchronization signal<br>
to the power supply unit 21a or 21b at the destination, and<br>
detects the abnormality of the received synchronization signal<br>
α. The relay 27 is operated (excited) by an abnormality signal<br>
γ outputted when the abnormality of the synchronization signal<br>
a is detected by the abnormal synchronization signal detection<br>
section 26. The backup synchronization signal generator<br>
circuit 28 forms a synchronization signal of the same phase<br>
with reference to the received synchronization signal α. When<br>
the backup synchronization signal generator circuit 28 receives<br><br>
the abnormality signal y of the abnormal synchronization signal<br>
detection section 26, the backup synchronization signal<br>
generator circuit 2 8 outputs the formed synchronization signal.<br>
When the abnormality signal y is off and the relay 27 does not<br>
operate (when a contact b of the relay 27 is off) , the reference<br>
pulse generator circuit 24 allows the passage of the received<br>
synchronization signal α, transmits the signal to the slave<br>
power supply unit 21b connected downstream, and outputs the<br>
synchronization signal α as the drive synchronization signal<br>
β. When the abnormality signal y is on and the relay 27 operates<br>
(when a contact a of the relay 27 is on) , the reference pulse<br>
generator circuit 24 transmits, instead of the received<br>
synchronization signal α, the backup synchronization signal<br>
as the synchronization signal a through the phase adjustment<br>
circuit 29 to the slave power supply unit 21b connected<br>
downstream, the backup synchronization signal having been<br>
outputted from the backup synchronization signal generator<br>
circuit 28. Further, the reference pulse generator circuit<br>
24 outputs, as the drive synchronization signal β, the backup<br>
synchronization signal having been outputted from the backup<br>
synchronization signal generator circuit 28.<br>
In this way, the power supply units 21a and 21b each have<br>
the synchronization signal (drive synchronization signal β<br>
for driving the transistor 52.<br>
FIG. 4 shows the circuit configuration of the power supply<br>
unit 21 and the article transport vehicle 3.<br>
In the article transport vehicle 3, a power receiving unit<br>
31 is connected to the pickup coil 20A of the pickup unit 20,<br>
and the transport motor 15 is connected to the power receiving<br>
unit 31 through an inverter 32.<br>
The power receiving unit 31 is configured as follows: a<br>
capacitor 33 forming, with the pickup coil 20A, a resonance<br>
circuit resonating at the frequency of the induction line 19<br>
is provided in parallel with the pickup coil 20A, a rectifying<br>
diode 34 is connected in parallel with the capacitor 33 of<br><br>
the resonance circuit, a stabilized power supply circuit 35<br>
for controlling output to a predetermined voltage is connected<br>
to the diode 34, and the load is connected to the stabilized<br>
power supply circuit 35. The stabilized power supply circuit<br>
35 comprises a coil 36 for limiting current, a transistor 37<br>
for adjusting output, and a diode 38 and a capacitor 39 which<br>
make up a filter. A transistor control unit is omitted.<br>
The power supply unit 21 comprises an AC power supply 41<br>
of AC200 V3 phase, a converter 42, an inverter 43, and a<br>
transistor 44 and a diode 45 for overcurrent protection. The<br>
converter 42 comprises a full-wave rectifier 46, a coil 47<br>
making up a filter, a capacitor 48, a resistor 49, and a<br>
transistor 50 for short-circuiting the resistor 49. The<br>
inverter 43 comprises a coil 51 for limiting current and the<br>
transistors (an example of a switching device) 52 which are<br>
driven by a rectangular wave signal and configured in full<br>
bridge.<br>
The power supply unit 21 further comprises a controller<br>
61	for driving the transistors 52 of the inverter 43. The<br>
reference pulse generator circuit 24 is provided in the<br>
controller 61.<br>
The controller 61 comprises a current/voltage detection<br>
power calculation section (an example of measuring unit) 62,<br>
a phase difference calculation section (an example of<br>
calculating unit) 64, and a drive pulse output circuit 65 in<br>
addition to the reference pulse generator circuit 24.<br>
The current/voltage detection power calculation section<br>
62	detects the output voltage and output current of the converter<br>
42 and calculates an output power fed from the converter 42<br>
to the inverter 43, in other words, the current/voltage<br>
detection power calculation section 62 measures the power<br>
consumption of the induction lines 19 which are fed with power,<br>
and outputs an output current fed to the induction lines 19<br>
and the power consumption of the induction lines 19.<br><br>
As described above, the impedance of the induction lines<br>
19, the capacitor 23, and the variable inductor 22 (the impedance<br>
of the overall induction lines) which are connected in series<br>
is adjusted as a capacitive reactance at the predetermined<br>
frequency. Thus, in an unloaded state where all the article<br>
transport vehicles 3 are stopped and the load resistance R<br>
is absent (power is consumed with the resistance rU of the<br>
induction lines 19, hereinafter referred to as unloaded power<br>
consumption) , the output current I advances ahead of the output<br>
voltage (in phase with the rectangular wave signal for driving<br>
the transistors 52) V of the induction lines 19 as shown in<br>
FIG. 6(c) . Since the induction line 19 has a different length<br>
in each of the power supply units 21, power consumption is<br>
not strictly constant among the power supply units 21 in a<br>
state in which all the article transport vehicles 3 are stopped.<br>
However, in order to match current phases among the power supply<br>
units 21, an assumed common value of power consumption at no<br>
load, for example, 2 kW is shared by the power supply units<br>
21 as an unloaded power consumption. In this case, as shown<br>
inFIGS. 5(b) and6(c), asthe power consumption (load) increases,<br>
the output current I is delayed (lead time decreases) . Under<br>
conditions that the impedance is adjusted to the predetermined<br>
impedance, as shown in FIG. 6(α), when the output current I<br>
is constant, the lead time of the output current I (corresponding<br>
to a phase difference between the output current I and the<br>
rectangular wave signal (corresponding to an output voltage<br>
signal) synchronized with the drive synchronization signal<br>
(3 (synchronization signal α) ) is always constant at each power<br>
consumption. The lead time can be substantially expressed by<br>
a linear formula as follows:<br>
s = aP + b ... (1)<br>
a = f(I)(a varies with output current)<br>
In the example of FIG. 6 (α) , the following is established:<br>
a = {8 ÷ 10 - (I - 70) ÷ 10 x 0.2} (µs/kW)<br>
(based on I = 70A)<br><br>
b = -26 (µs.)<br>
wherein s (µs) represents a lead time, P(kW) represents a power<br>
consumption, a(µs/kW) represents a primary coefficient, and<br>
b(µs) represents an initial value.<br>
Formula (1) is stored beforehand in the phase difference<br>
calculation section 64, a phase difference s is calculated<br>
based on the output current I and the power consumption P which<br>
are measured by the current/ voltage detection power calculation<br>
section 62, and a calculated lead time s is outputted to the<br>
drive pulse output circuit 65. As the frequency of the<br>
induction lines 19 decreases, as shown in FIG. 6(b), the lead<br>
time s advances (increases). Therefore, when the assigned<br>
frequency of the induction lines 19 is changed, the frequency<br>
may be measured to correct the lead time s according to Formula<br>
(2) below.<br>
s = aP + b + c . . . (2)<br>
c = f(q) = d(q-10){d is a factor of proportionality<br>
(µs/kHz) }<br>
(c varies with the frequency q)<br>
In the example of FIG. 6 (b) , the following is established:<br>
d = 2 (µs/kHz)<br>
wherein q(kHz) represents a frequency.<br>
As a matter of course, the formulas may have higher-order<br>
terms because of the characteristics (for example, the magnetic<br>
property or the like of the core of the pickup coil 20A) of<br>
the circuit on the power receiving side of the article transport<br>
vehicle 3. Arithmetic expressions can be obtained according<br>
to the higher-order terms.<br>
When receiving the lead time s determined by the phase<br>
difference calculation section 64, the drive pulse output<br>
circuit 65 advances (corrects) the rectangular wave signal,<br>
which drives the transistors 52 of the inverter 43, ahead of<br>
the rectangular wave signal (corresponding to the drive<br>
synchronization signal β inputted from the reference pulse<br>
generator circuit 24) of unloaded power consumption according<br><br>
to the lead time s in order to compensate for a delay caused<br>
by increased power consumption, and then the drive pulse output<br>
circuit 65 outputs the signal to the transistors 52.<br>
The following will discuss the operation of the circuit<br>
configuration of the power supply unit 21, the induction lines<br>
19, and the article transport vehicle 3.<br>
First, the alternating current of AC200 V3 phase from the<br>
AC power supply 41 is transformed into direct current by the<br>
converter 42, transformed into a high frequency, for example,<br>
an alternating current of 10 kHz by the inverter 43, and fed<br>
to the induction lines 19. Magnetic fluxes generated on the<br>
two upper and lower induction lines 19 cause large electromotive<br>
force on the pickup coil 20A of the article transport vehicle<br>
3 disposed on the transport rails 1 which resonate at the<br>
frequency of the induction lines 19. Alternating current<br>
generated by the electromotive force is rectified by the diode<br>
34, rectified to a predetermined voltage by the stabilized<br>
power supply circuit 35, and fed to the motor 15 through the<br>
inverter 32. The wheel devices 14 are driven by the motor 15<br>
which has been fed with power, and the article transport vehicle<br>
3 of the moving body is moved while being guided along the<br>
transport rails 1.<br>
In the controller 61, the current/voltage detection power<br>
calculation section 62 measures the output current I and power<br>
consumed by the inverter 43, that is, power consumption P<br>
consumed by the connected induction lines 19, the phase<br>
difference calculation section 64 determines a lead time s<br>
corresponding to a phase difference based on the output current<br>
I and the power consumption P which have been measured in the<br>
current/voltage detection power calculation section 62, and<br>
the drive pulse output circuit 65 advances (corrects) the<br>
rectangular wave signal, which drives the transistors 52, ahead<br>
of the drive synchronization signal β according to the lead<br>
time s having been determined by the phase difference<br>
calculation section 64 and outputs the signal to the transistors<br><br>
52. When power consumption gradually increases and the lead<br>
time s delays (decreases), the rectangular wave signal is<br>
advanced. When power consumption gradually decreases and the<br>
lead time s advances (increases) , the rectangular waves signal<br>
is gradually delayed (FIG. 7).<br>
Thus, the phase of current fed to the induction lines 19<br>
is matched with the phase of output current of unloaded power<br>
consumption. The phase of current fed to the induction lines<br>
19 advances when the power consumption of the induction lines<br>
19 decreases, and the phase delays when the power consumption<br>
increases. Therefore, the phases of current fed to the<br>
induction lines 19 are adjusted according to the<br>
synchronization signal a having been transmitted from the<br>
master power supply unit 21a, and the current phases of all<br>
the induction lines 19 are matched.<br>
In the reference pulse generator circuit 24, it is monitored<br>
whether the master rectangular wave synchronization signal<br>
α is abnormal. When the signal is not abnormal, the phase<br>
adjustment circuit 29 compensates for a phase delay of the<br>
master rectangular wave synchronization signal α. The phase<br>
delay is caused by the line length of the signal transmission<br>
line 18. Then, the signal is transmitted to the subsequent<br>
(downstream) slave power supply unit 21b and supplied as the<br>
drive synchronization signal β to the drive pulse output circuit<br>
65.<br>
Hence, as shown in FIG. 7, the rectangular wave signal<br>
for driving the transistors 52 is advanced relative to the<br>
master rectangular wave synchronization signal a according<br>
to power consumption in the power supply unit 21 and thus the<br>
output currents of the induction lines 19 are matched in phase.<br>
As a result, the output currents of the induction lines 19<br>
are matched in phase without measuring the waveform of<br>
high-frequency current.<br>
In the reference pulse generator circuit 24 of the slave<br>
power supply unit 21b, when the received master rectangular<br><br>
wave synchronization signal α is found to be abnormal, the<br>
backup synchronization signal generator circuit 28 having<br>
referred to the synchronization signal a outputs the backup<br>
synchronization signal. The backup synchronization signal is<br>
transmitted as the master rectangular wave synchronization<br>
signal a to the subsequent downstream slave power supply unit<br>
21b through the phase adjustment circuit 29, and is supplied<br>
as the drive synchronization signal β to the drive pulse output<br>
circuit 65. Thus, the signal can be synchronized with the<br>
output current of the slave power supply unit 21b connected<br>
to the output side (downstream side) and the output currents<br>
of the induction lines 19 are matched in phase.<br>
As described above, according to the present embodiment,<br>
in each of the power supply units 21, a lead time corresponding<br>
to a phase difference is determined by the phase difference<br>
calculation section 64 based on output current and power<br>
consumption which have been measured by the current/voltage<br>
detection power calculation section 62, the rectangular wave<br>
signal for driving the transistors 52 is advanced (corrected<br>
and advanced) according to the lead time which decreases with<br>
power consumption, and then the signal is outputted, so that<br>
the phase of current fed to the induction lines 19 can be matched<br>
with the phase of output current of unloaded power consumption.<br>
The phase of current fed to the induction lines 19 is delayed<br>
by increased power consumption of the induction lines 19. As<br>
a result of the matching, the phase can be adjusted according<br>
to the synchronization signal a transmitted from the master<br>
power supply unit 21a and the current phases of all the induction<br>
lines 19 can be matched. It is thus possible to prevent power<br>
consumption from being excessively consumed due to the current<br>
phases of the adjacent induction lines 19 when the article<br>
transport vehicle 3 moves across the induction lines 19, prevent<br>
the outputs of the two power supply units 21 from being<br>
short-circuited through the pickup coil 20a, eliminate the<br>
need for the waveform of current of another induction line<br><br>
19, and eliminate the need for comparing waveforms to detect<br>
a phase difference. As a result, current phases can be matched<br>
between the induction lines with an inexpensive and simple<br>
configuration without the need for a conventional CT or PLL/VCO<br>
circuit having a wide frequency domain and thus the cost is<br>
reduced.<br>
According to the present embodiment, the synchronization<br>
signal a is transmitted from the master power supply unit 21a<br>
to the downstream slave power supply unit 21b after being<br>
compensated for a phase delay caused by the line length of<br>
the signal transmission line 18 between the master power supply<br>
unit 21a and the slave power supply unit 21b connected downstream.<br>
Then, the synchronization signal a is transmitted from the<br>
slave power supply unit 21b to the downstream slave power supply<br>
unit 21b after being compensated for a phase delay caused by<br>
the line length of the signal transmission line 18 between<br>
the slave power supply unit 21b and the downstream slave power<br>
supply unit 21b. Therefore, the synchronization signal a<br>
having been compensated for a phase delay caused by the line<br>
length of the signal transmission line 18 is transmitted to<br>
each of the slave power supply units 21b, so that the<br>
synchronization signals a of the slave power supply units 21b<br>
can be matched with the synchronization signal a having been<br>
transmitted from the master power supply unit 21a. Further,<br>
each of the slave power supply units 21b outputs a rectangular<br>
wave signal based on the synchronization signal a having been<br>
received from the power supply unit 21a or 21b connected upstream,<br>
so that the phase of current fed to the induction lines 19<br>
can be matched with the synchronization signal a having been<br>
transmitted from the master power supply unit 21a. The phase<br>
of current fed to the induction lines 19 has been delayed from<br>
the rectangular wave signal due to power consumption of the<br>
induction lines 19. With this matching, the current phases<br>
of all the induction lines 19 can be matched.<br><br>
Moreover, according to the present embodiment, when the<br>
synchronization signal a is not received by the master power<br>
supply unit 21a, a rectangular wave signal is outputted based<br>
on the backup synchronization signal of the backup<br>
synchronization signal generator circuit 28, so that the<br>
feeding of current to the induction lines 19 is not stopped<br>
and a displacement of a current phase is minimized between<br>
the adjacent induction lines 19. Hence, it is possible to<br>
prevent the occurrence of problems in the traveling of the<br>
article transport vehicle 3.<br>
The present embodiment does not describe the control of<br>
the pulse width of the rectangular wave signal for driving<br>
the transistors 52. The pulse width may be controlled according<br>
to necessary power.<br>
In the present embodiment, the phases of output current<br>
of the induction lines 19 are matched with the phase of output<br>
current of unloaded power consumption. The phases of output<br>
current of the induction lines 19 may be matched by advancing<br>
(correcting and advancing) or delaying (correcting and<br>
delaying) the rectangular wave signal relative to the phase<br>
of predetermined power consumption and outputting the signal.<br>
In the present embodiment, the transistor 52 is used as<br>
the switching device of the power supply unit 21. The switching<br>
device is not limited to a transistor and a semiconductor device<br>
such as a thyristor may be used.<br>
In the present embodiment, the article transport vehicle<br>
3 guided along the transport rails 1 is a moving body. The<br>
moving body is not limited to the article transport vehicle<br>
3 and any unit may be used as long as the unit moves along<br>
a fixed moving path. In this case, induction lines adjusted<br>
to an equal inductance value are laid along the moving path.<br>
In the present embodiment, the power supply units 21 are<br>
connected in series and the synchronization signal α is<br>
transmitted from the specific master power supply unit 21a<br>
sequentially to the slave power supply units 21b. The<br><br>
synchronization signal a may be directly outputted from the<br>
specific master power supply unit 21a to the slave power supply<br>
units 21b. In this case, in the specific master power supply<br>
unit 21a, the phase adjustment circuit 29 and the phase<br>
difference detection circuit 30 are provided for each of the<br>
slave power supply units 21b to compensate for a delay of the<br>
synchronization signal α, the delay being caused by the line<br>
length of the signal transmission line 18 between the master<br>
power supply unit 21a and the slave power supply unit 21b.<br>
Further, the system of FIG. 8 may be used which comprises,<br>
instead of the specific master power supply unit 21a, an<br>
oscillator (an example of a command device) 68 including the<br>
synchronization signal generator circuit 25 for generating<br>
the rectangular wave synchronization signal a. The<br>
rectangular wave synchronization signal α is directly outputted<br>
from the oscillator 68 to the power supply units 21 on the<br>
induction lines 19 (integrated master system).<br>
In the present embodiment, the impedance of the induction<br>
lines 19, the capacitor 23, and the variable inductor 22<br>
connected in series is adjusted as the capacitive reactance<br>
at the predetermined frequency f. The impedance may be adjusted<br>
so as to form a resonance circuit or an inductive reactance.<br>
During unloaded power consumption, as indicated by a broken<br>
line of FIG. 5 (b) , the output current is delayed from the output<br>
voltage (in phase with the rectangular wave for driving the<br>
transistors 52) V of the induction lines 19. As shown in FIGS.<br>
5(b) and 9, the output current advances (phase difference<br>
decreases) with power consumption (load). Also in this state,<br>
under conditions that the inductance of the induction line<br>
19 is adjusted by the variable inductor 22 and forms, with<br>
the resonant capacitor 23, a resonance circuit resonating at<br>
the predetermined frequency, based on a fact that a phase<br>
difference is always constant at each power consumption when<br>
output voltage is constant, a delay time (decreases with power<br>
consumption) relative to power consumption is measured<br><br>
beforehand as in FIG. 6 (α) and the delay time can be calculated<br>
based on Formula (1).<br>
In the present embodiment, the controller 61 comprises<br>
the phase difference calculation section 64 for determining<br>
a phase difference (lead time) . As shown in FIG. 10, a memory<br>
section (an example of storage means) 71 and a phase difference<br>
detection section 72 may be provided instead of the phase<br>
difference calculation section 64. As shown in FIG. 6(α),<br>
regarding a predetermined output current (for example, 80 A) ,<br>
the impedance (the impedance of the overall induction lines)<br>
of the induction lines 19, the capacitor 23, and the variable<br>
inductor 22 connected in series at the predetermined frequency<br>
is set as the capacitive reactance as described above, so that<br>
the output current advances ahead of the output voltage (in<br>
phase with the rectangular wave signal for driving the<br>
transistors 52) V. Although the output current I delays with<br>
power consumption, under conditions that the impedance is<br>
adjusted to a predetermined impedance, a phase difference is<br>
always constant at each power consumption. The memory section<br>
71 stores, at each predetermined output current (for example,<br>
70 A) , correction values based on a lead time measured beforehand<br>
at each power consumption while a lead time is set at "0" for<br>
the output current of unloaded power consumption (for example,<br>
2 kW) and the rectangular wave signal (corresponding to an<br>
output voltage signal) synchronized with the drive<br>
synchronization signal β (synchronization signal α). For<br>
example, the memory section 71 stores a phase difference (e.g.,<br>
+ 3. 1 µS) for compensating for a delay of the power consumption<br>
of 6 kW from 2 kW and a phase difference (e.g., 5.5 µs) for<br>
compensating for a further delay of the power consumption of<br>
10 kW. Moreover, the phase difference detection section 72<br>
searches the memory section 71 based on power consumption<br>
measured by the current/voltage detection power calculation<br>
section 62 and determines a corrected lead time. At this point,<br>
the drive pulse output circuit 65 advances (corrects) the<br><br>
rectangular wave signal, which drives the transistors 52, ahead<br>
of the drive synchronization signal β (synchronization signal<br>
α) according to the corrected lead time, and outputs the signal.<br>
The phases of the output current of the induction lines 19<br>
are matched with the phase of output current in unloaded power<br>
consumption. A correction value based on a lead time measured<br>
at each power consumption may be stored relative to the phase<br>
of the predetermined power consumption (for example, 6kW).<br>
For example, the memory section 71 stores a phase difference<br>
(for example, -3.1 µs) for compensating for an advance of the<br>
power consumption of 2 kW from 6 kW and a phase difference<br>
(for example, +2.4 µs) for compensating for a delay of the<br>
power consumption of 10 kW. In this case, the rectangular wave<br>
signal for driving the transistors 52 is delayed from or advanced<br>
ahead of (corrected) the drive synchronization signal β<br>
(synchronization signal α) , and then the signal is outputted.<br>
