				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a novel method for preparing<br>
toothpaste.<br>
More precisely, the invention concerns a method for<br>
preparing toothpaste comprising a specific sorbitol<br>
syrup as main humectant.<br>
Toothpastes are products well known in the state of the<br>
art. They generally comprise an abrasive agent and a<br>
gelling agent in a liquid medium consisting of a<br>
humectant and various ingredients such as flavors,<br>
colorants, preservatives, detergents, anti-tartar<br>
agents, antibacterial agents, and the like. These<br>
products are provided in the form of pastes, gels or<br>
liquids, which are opaque, translucent or transparent,<br>
and are used for cosmetic or therapeutic purposes.<br>
The humectant most often consists of a polyol syrup<br>
such as sorbitol, glycerin, xylitol, mannitol and<br>
mixtures thereof. It is used to avoid hardening of<br>
toothpastes during storage and can also serve as<br>
sweetener.<br>
Sorbitol is widely used in this application in the form<br>
of a noncrystallizable syrup, having a sorbitol content<br>
of about 7 0% on a dry basis, which is found on the<br>
market at 70% dry matter content, as in particular<br>
NEOSORB® 70/70 marketed by the applicant. In general,<br>
it is used in proportions of about 20 to 70% by weight<br>
of the toothpaste.<br>
Numerous formulas comprising sorbitol containing 70%<br>
dry matter, content have been described in particular in<br>
the documents US-A-5,252,313, WO-A-95/22958,<br>
WO --A - 96/38123.<br>
One of the critical points in the preparation of a<br>
toothpaste relates to the dispersion of the gelling<br>
agent in the humectant. The gelling agent generally<br>
consists of polysaccharides such as celluloses or their<br>
derivatives,, pectins, gelatins, agar, plant gums such<br>
as alginates, carrageenans, xanthans or inorganic<br>
gelling compounds such as thickening silicas, or<br>
polyacrylat.es. Although hydrophilic, the gelling agent<br>
tends to form lumps and to agglomerate. Sortie<br>
manufacturers circumvent the problem by being equipped<br>
with very high-shear mixers, but this equipment is very<br>
expensive. A solution to this problem was proposed in<br>
patent application EP-A-1,004,354 of which the<br>
applicant is proprietor, which describes polyol<br>
compositions whose dry matter content, of between 83<br>
and 90%, was selected to ensure good dispersion of the<br>
gelling agents.<br>
Toothpaste manufacturers are interested in the easy<br>
-dispersion of gelling agents in these compositions and<br>
in the possibility of having more free water in order<br>
to be able to dissolve the active agents and the other<br>
ingredients of the toothpaste. However, they are<br>
hampered by the need to heat all the storage, handling<br>
and production materials in order to avoid risks of<br>
crystallization. Furthermore, during the preparation of<br>
toothpastes, the high viscosity of such compositions<br>
which results from the excellent dispersion of the<br>
gelling agent can prove too high for the stirring<br>
equipment in place.<br>
Seeking to improve the state of the art, the applicant<br>
then observed that, within a specifically selected,<br>
very particular range of dry matter content, a sorbitol<br>
syrup offered the possibility of substantially<br>
improving the dispersion of abrasive agents in<br>
toothpaste. and of advantageously reducing the<br>
production time of toothpastes, without exhibiting the<br>
disadvantages of sorbitol syrups of the prior art. The<br>
expression abrasive agents for the purposes of the<br>
present invention means compounds such as, for example,<br>
silicas or silica derivatives, calcium phosphates and<br>
calcium carbonate.<br>
The present, invention thus concerns a method for<br>
preparing toothpaste comprising a sorbitol syrup as<br>
main humectant, at least one abrasive agent and at<br>
least one gelling agent, characterized in that said <br>
sorbitol syrup has a dry matter content of between 73 (<br>
and 82.9%, preferably between 74 and'"80%.<br>
The use of such a syrup for the preparation of<br>
toothpastes is novel. Its use in a method in accordance<br>
with "the invention allows, surprisingly and<br>
unexpectedly, markedly improved dispersion of the<br>
abrasive agents, bringing about an advantageous gain in<br>
production time, and leads to stable and perfectly<br>
homogeneous products. Very good results in terms of<br>
.. gain in mixing time have been observed when silicas are<br>
for example used as abrasive agent. According to the<br>
invention, the toothpaste therefore preferably<br>
comprises, as abrasive agent, a compound chosen from<br>
the group consisting of silicas or silica derivatives,<br>
calcium carbonate and calcium phosphates. Still more<br>
preferably, said abrasive agent is a silica or a silica<br>
derivative.<br>
Moreover, the use of the sorbitol syrup in accordance<br>
with the invention makes it possible, for the same<br>
final sorbitol concentration, in the toothpaste, to have<br>
a larger quantity of free water to dissolve all the<br>
ingredients which it is desired to include in the<br>
paste. This results in a better homogeneity. The total<br>
water content of a toothpaste prepared according to the<br>
method in accordance with the invention is generally<br>
between 15 and 60% by weight, depending on the paste<br>
texture desired in the end.<br>
A sorbitol syrup corresponding to the European<br>
Pharmacopoeia (2001 edition, 0437), namely a syrup<br>
comprising 72 to 92% dry weight of D-sorbitol, is<br>
preferably used in a method according to the invention.<br>
Advantageously, the sorbitol syrup in accordance with<br>
the invention is noncrystallizable.<br>
In the present invention, said sorbitol syrup<br>
advantageously has a reducing sugar content of less<br>
than or equal to 500 ppm, preferably of less than<br>
300 ppm, which makes it possible to use it in<br>
particular in toothpastes containing compounds of basic<br>
pH such as, for example, those which contain sodium<br>
bicarbonate, in which the syrup has excellent<br>
stability, that is to say an absence of coloration over<br>
time. This reducing sugar content may be determined by<br>
any technique known to persons skilled in the art and<br>
whose sensitivity is suited to relatively low contents.<br>
Advantageously, the test S, as described by the<br>
applicant in the documents EP-B1-0,711,743 or<br>
 EP-A1-1,095,925, will be used.<br>
To prepare the sorbitol syrup in accordance with the<br>
invention, it is possible to prepare a syrup from<br>
sorbitol powder by bringing it to the desired richness<br>
and dry matter content, or a commercial sorbitol may be<br>
directly concentrated to the desired dry matter<br>
content. This concentration is carried out using<br>
conventional evaporating devices.<br>
It will be possible advantageously to use the sorbitol<br>
syrups as described in patent EP-B1-0,711,743 or<br>
obtained according to the method described in patent<br>
application EP-A1-1,095,925, which will be concentrated<br>
to the desired dry matter content.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the<br>
toothpaste may comprise an additional humectant such<br>
as, for example, glycerin, xylitol, propylene glycol,<br>
and polyethylene glycol. Preferably,, the toothpaste<br>
comprises up to 20% by weight of said additional<br>
humectant.<br>
As regards the preparation of the toothpaste, equipment<br>
and formulas known to persons skilled in the art will<br>
be used. According to a general embodiment of the<br>
method according to the invention, the humectant is<br>
first mixed with the gelling agent. This gelling agent<br>
is generally cellulose or a cellulose derivative such<br>
as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose. The various<br>
ingredients, such as flavors, sweeteners, colorants,<br>
fluorine salts, anti-tartar agents, antibacterial<br>
agents, whitening agents, detergents and preservatives<br>
are then added after homogenization.<br>
The invention also concerns a sorbitol syrup,<br>
characterized in that it has a D-sorbitol content of<br>
between 7 2 and 92%, a dry matter content of between 73<br>
and 82.9%, preferably between 74 and 80%, and a<br>
reducing sugar content of less than 500 ppm, preferably<br>
of less than 300 ppm. Preferably, said syrup has a<br>
total sugar content, after total hydrolysis according<br>
to the Bertrand method, of between 3.5 and 98%,<br>
preferably between 6 and 92%, and still more preferably<br>
between 3 and 90%. It may comprise, in addition, from<br>
0.01 to 95% of hydrogenated mono- and/or disaccharides,<br>
the balance for 100 consisting of oligo- and<br>
polysaccharides. Still more preferably, said syrup is<br>
noncrystallizable.<br>
The applicant has indeed observed that these syrups,<br>
which are particularly suited to good dispersion of the<br>
abrasive agents and other ingredients in a toothpaste,<br>
could be advantageously concentrated to the selected<br>
dry matter content without causing undesirable<br>
coloration, odors or tastes in the application<br>
targeted. Only the particular selection of such syrups<br>
leads to products wnich are stable, colorless and free<br>
of unpleasant tastes and odors, while the concentration<br>
of conventional sorbitol syrups is a delicate operation<br>
to perform because of the precautions to be taken in<br>
particular in terms of temperature.<br>
The invention will be understood more clearly on<br>
reading the examples which follow,, which are not<br>
intended to be limiting and which are only advantageous<br>
embodiments of the method in accordance with the<br>
invention.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of toothpastes according to the<br>
invention and comparison with the prior art<br>
Various sorbitol syrups are prepared, as humectant,<br>
which have dry matter contents (DM) of 70% and 86.8%<br>
(prior art) and 74% and 78% (invention), by<br>
concentrating a sorbitol syrup (NEOSORB® 70/70).<br>
Various toothpastes, all containing the same sorbitol<br>
content, are prepared using these syrups.<br>
The formula for each toothpaste is the following<br>
(percentages expressed by weight):<br>
Silica (TIXOSIL 73): 14%<br>
Silica (TIXOSIL 43): 9%<br>
Detergent (SIPON LCSV95, 30% DM): 4.16%<br>
Silesia mint flavor: 0.80%<br>
Sodium monofluorophosphate: 0.7 6%<br>
Carboxymethylcellulose (BLANOSE 7MXF): 0.7%<br>
Green colorant (0.5% DM): 0.5%<br>
Sodium saccharinate: 0.2%<br>
Preservative (methylparaben): 0.18%<br>
Preservative (propylparaben): 0.02%<br>
Paste 1: NEOSORB 70/70 containing 70% DM: 64%<br>
Water: 5.68%<br>
Paste 2: NEOSORB containing 74% DM: 60.54%<br>
Water: 9.14%<br>
Paste 3: NEOSORB containing 78% DM: 57.44%<br>
Water: 12.2 4%<br>
Paste 4: NEOSORB containing 86.8% DM: 51.61%<br>
Water: 18.07%<br>
procedure:<br>
Dissolve the parabens in water at 92°C (solution S) in<br>
a beaker.<br>
Mix the sorbitol syrup and the carboxymethylcellulose<br>
for 1 minute in a stainless steel bowl.<br>
Add solution S, mix for 2 min.<br>
Homogenize for 3 min.<br>
Transfer into a GUEDU homogenizer (type 4.5NO) at 20°C.<br>
Add the saccharinate, the monofluorophosphate, the<br>
• colorant and the flavor, mix for 1 min 30 s under<br>
vacuum.<br>
Add half of the silicas, mix for 3 min under vacuum.<br>
Add the second half of the silicas, mix for 3 min under<br>
vacuum.<br>
Mix for a time T until homogenization is obtained.<br>
Add the SIPON, mix for 1 min 30 s under vacuum.<br>
The total manufacturing time, the time T necessary for<br>
the dispersion of the silicas, the viscosity after<br>
manufacture and the viscosity after 24 hours (HELIPATH<br>
apparatus, viscosity in centipoises) are measured for<br>
each paste prepared.<br>
Observations: The sorbitol syrups in accordance with<br>
the invention considerably reduce the time necessary<br>
for a perfectly homogeneous dispersion of the silicas.<br>
It is observed, according to the formulas according to<br>
the invention, that the quantity of available water is<br>
increased (up to 12% of water), which improves the<br>
dispersion and/or solubilization of the other<br>
ingredients. The viscosities are better, which causes<br>
an improved, paste texture and a shorter silica mixing<br>
time.<br>
In the case of paste 4, which is prepared with a<br>
sorbitol syrup containing 86.8% dry matter content, the<br>
dispersion of the silicas is insufficient.<br>
The use of sorbitol syrups in accordance with the<br>
invention for the preparation of toothpastes is<br>
therefore technically and economically completely<br>
advantageous (large gain in time, improved paste<br>
quality). Such syrups are furthermore completely<br>
advantageous in terms of economics of cost of<br>
transportation, reduction in the volumes to be stored,<br>
and ease of use.<br>
Example 2: Formulation of toothpastes with calcium<br>
carbonate<br>
Toothpastes are prepared in accordance with example 1,<br>
replacing the abrasive silicas with calcium carbonate.<br>
Sorbitol syrups (NEOSORB® 70/70) containing 70, 75 and<br>
80% dry matter content (pastes 1, 2 and 3) are<br>
prepared. The sorbitol contents of each paste are<br>
identical.<br>
The formula is the following:<br>
Calcium carbonate (SOCAL 90A): 4 5%<br>
Sipon LCSV95 (30% DM): 5.66%<br>
Blanose 7MXF: 1.2%<br>
Silesia mint flavor: 1%<br>
Sodium monofluorophosphate: 0.8%<br>
Sodium saccharinate: 0.2%<br>
Methylparaben: 0.18%<br>
Propylparaben; 0.02%<br>
Paste 1: NEOSORB 70/70 containing 70% DM: 35.7%<br>
Water: 10.29%<br>
Paste 2: NEOSORB containing 75% DM: 33.32%<br>
Water: 12.67%<br>
Paste 3: NEOSORB containing 80% DM: 31.24%<br>
Water: 14.7 5%<br>
Procedure:<br>
Dissolve the parabens in water at 72°C (solution S) in<br>
a beaker.<br>
Mix the sorbitol syrup and the carboxymethylcellulose<br>
for 1 minute in a stainless steel bowl.<br>
Add solution S, mix for 2 min.<br>
Homogenize for 3 min.<br>
Transfer into the. GUEDU homogenizer at 20°C<br>
Add the saccharinate, the monofluorophosphate and the<br>
flavor, mix for 1 min 30 s under vacuum.<br>
Add the carbonate, mix for 3 min under vacuum.<br>
Add the Sipon, mix for 1 min 30 s under vacuum.<br>
The total manufacturing time, and the time T necessary<br>
for the dispersion of the carbonate are measured for<br>
each paste prepared.<br>
The results are presented in the following table:<br>
These results demonstrate that the abrasive mixing<br>
times are markedly improved when the sorbitol syrups in<br>
accordance with the invention are used.<br>
The total toothpaste manufacturing time is thereby<br>
advantageously shortened.<br>
Example 3: Formulation of toothpastes with sodium<br>
bicarbonate<br>
Various sorbitol syrups are prepared, as humectant,<br>
which have dry matter contents (DM) of 70% (prior art)<br>
and 74%, 78% and 81.6% (invention), by concentrating a<br>
noncrystallizable sorbitol syrup having a reducing sugar<br>
content of less chan 500 ppm, and a total sugar content<br>
of 7% after total hydrolysis according to the Bertrand<br>
method, and comprising 88% of hydrogenated mono- and/or<br>
disaccharides, the balance for 100 consisting of oligo-<br>
and polysaccharides (NEOSORB 70/70 SB).<br>
Various sodium bicarbonate toothpastes all containing<br>
the sane dry sorbitoi content (31.5%) were prepared<br>
using these syrups.<br>
The formula for each toothpaste is the following<br>
(percentages expressed by weight):<br>
NEOSORB® 70/70 SB: 4 5.00%<br>
Water: 16.94%<br>
Sodium bicarbonate: 10.00%<br>
Thickening silica Tixosil 43: 10.00%<br>
Abrasive silica Tixosil 73: 9.00%<br>
Sodium lauryl sulfate Sipon LCSV95 (30% DM): 5.66%<br>
Mint flavor: 1,00%<br>
Sodium monofluorophosphate: 0.8%<br>
Sodium carboxymethylcellulose Blanose 7MXF: 0.7%<br>
Titanium dioxide: 0.7%<br>
Sodium saccharinate: 0.2%<br>
The procedure for each paste differs only in the<br>
application of an additional mixing time or not. This<br>
additional mixing time is intended for the possible<br>
removal of residual grains from the paste.<br>
Procedure:<br>
~ dissolve the monofluorophosphate and saccharinate in<br>
water in order to obtain a solution S, in a beaker;<br>
- mix the NEOSORB® and the CMC for 1 min (motor +<br>
turbine), in a stainless steel bowl;<br>
add solution S and the titanium oxide, mix for<br>
2 min;<br>
homogenize for 3 min;<br>
transfer to a GUEDU mixer;<br>
add the. flavor and mix under vacuum for<br>
i min 30 sec;<br>
add the thickening silica and mix under vacuum for<br>
3 min;<br>
add the abrasive silica and mix under vacuum for<br>
3 min;<br>
add the bicarbonate and mix under vacuum for 3 min;<br>
mix for an additional T min (according to the<br>
sorbitol syrup used);<br>
add the Sipon and mix under-vacuum for 1 min 30 sec.<br>
The total manufacturing time, the additional time T<br>
necessary for the dispersion of the silicas, the<br>
viscosity after manufacture and the viscosity after<br>
cooling (HELIPATH apparatus, viscosity in centipoises),<br>
are measured for each paste prepared.<br>
Comments: These results demonstrate, as in the<br>
preceding examples, that the sorbitol syrups in<br>
accordance with the invention advantageously allow a<br>
mixing time which is shorter, the higher the dry matter<br>
content, and allow better dispersion of the silicas,<br>
and perfect hydration of the carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
which results in a higher paste viscosity after<br>
manufacture.<br>
