				<td>INSTALLATION AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING ACTIVE CARBON<br>
The present invention relates to the technical field of<br>
producing activated carbon.<br>
The present invention relates more particularly to an<br>
apparatus and also a process for producing activated<br>
carbon, in particular by carbonization and subsequent<br>
activation of suitable polymeric starting materials,<br>
such as sulphonated polymers.<br>
Activated carbon has highly non-specific adsorption<br>
properties and for this reason is the most widely used<br>
adsorbant. Statutory requirements as well increasing<br>
environmental awareness are leading to an increasing<br>
demand for activated carbon.<br>
Activated carbon is generally produced by carbonization<br>
and subsequent activation of suitable carbonaceous<br>
starting materials. Starting materials which lead to<br>
economically viable yields are generally preferred,<br>
since the weight losses caused by detachment of vola-<br>
tile constituents during carbonization and by burn-out<br>
during activation are appreciable. For further details<br>
concerning the production of activated carbon, see for<br>
example H. v. Kienle and E. Bader, Aktivkohle und ihre<br>
industrielle Anwendung, Enke Verlag Stuttgart, 1980.<br>
Carbonization, also known as pyrolysis, describes the<br>
conversion of the carbonaceous starting material into<br>
carbon. The process of carbonizing the aforementioned<br>
polymeric, in particular sulphonated, organic starting<br>
materials has the effect of detaching volatile con-<br>
stituents such as SO2 in particular to destroy the func-<br>
tional chemical groups, sulphonic acid groups in par-<br>
ticular, to form free radicals which effect the pro-<br>
nounced crosslinking without which there would be no<br>
pyrolysis residue (= carbon).<br>
Carbonization is followed by activation. The basic<br>
principle of activation consists in some of the carbon<br>
generated by carbonization being selectively and delib-<br>
erately broken down under suitable conditions. This<br>
gives rise to a large number of pores, cracks and fis-<br>
sures, and the surface area per unit mass increases ap-<br>
preciably. Activation thus involves a deliberate burn-<br>
out of the previously carbonized material. Since carbon<br>
is broken down during activation, this operation leads<br>
to a loss of substance which is appreciable in some in-<br>
stances and which under optimum conditions equates to<br>
an increase in the porosity and an increase in the in-<br>
ternal surface area and of the pore volume. Activation<br>
is therefore effected under selective/controlled, gen-<br>
erally oxidizing, conditions.<br>
The condition or constitution of the activated carbon<br>
produced - finely or coarsely porous, firm or brittle -<br>
is also dependent on the starting material. Customary<br>
starting materials are coconut shells, wood wastes,<br>
peat, bituminous coal, pitches, but also particular<br>
plastics, which play a certain part in the production<br>
of woven activated carbon fabrics inter alia.<br>
Various forms of activated carbon are used: carbon pow-<br>
der, splint coal, granulocarbon, moulded carbon and<br>
also, since the end of the 1970s, activated carbon in<br>
spherical form ("spherocarbon"). Spherical activated<br>
carbon has a number of advantages over other forms of<br>
activated carbon such as carbon powder, splint coal,<br>
granulocarbon and the like, making it valuable or even<br>
indispensable for certain applications: it is free-<br>
flowing, hugely abrasion-resistant (i.e. dustless) and<br>
very hard. Owing to its high price, however, its use is<br>
essentially limited to protective suits and high-<br>
performance filters for noxiants in air streams.<br>
Spherocarbon is in great demand on account of its spe-<br>
cific shape, but also on account of its extremely high<br>
abrasion resistance for particular fields of use for<br>
example, examples being sheet filters for protective<br>
suits against chemical poisons and filters for low<br>
noxiant concentrations in large volumes of air. For in-<br>
stance, when reticulated, large-cell polyurethane foams<br>
are loaded with activated carbon as described in<br>
DE 38 13 563 Al, only a very free-flowing carbon can be<br>
used if optimal coverage of the inner layers of the<br>
foam material as well as the outer layers is to be<br>
achieved. The manufacture of protective suits against<br>
chemical poisons on the lines of DE 33 04 349 C3 for<br>
example can likewise utilize only a highly abrasion-<br>
resistant carbon, and only spherocarbon fits this de-<br>
scription.<br>
Spherocarbon is currently still being mostly produced<br>
by multistage processes which are very costly and in-<br>
convenient. The best-known process consists in spher-<br>
ules being produced from coal tar pitch and suitable<br>
asphaltic residues from the petrochemical industry and<br>
oxidized (to render them unmeltable), carbonized and<br>
activated. For example, spherocarbon can be produced<br>
from bitumen in a multistage process. These multistage<br>
processes are very cost-intensive and the associated<br>
high price of this spherocarbon prevents many applica-<br>
tions wherein spherocarbon ought to be preferable by<br>
virtue of its properties.<br>
There have consequently been various attempts to pro-<br>
duce high-grade spherocarbon in some other way. It is<br>
prior art to produce spherocarbon by carbonization and<br>
subsequent activation of new or used ion exchangers<br>
containing sulphonic acid groups, or by carbonizing ion<br>
exchanger precursors in the presence of sulphuric acid<br>
and subsequent activation, wherein the sulphonic acid<br>
groups and the sulphuric acid respectively have the<br>
function of a crosslinker, and the yields obtained,<br>
which do not depend on whether ready-produced cation<br>
exchangers or unsulphonated ion exchanger precursors<br>
are used as starting materials, being about 30% to 50%,<br>
based on organic/polymeric starting material. Such<br>
processes are described for example in DE 43 28 219 Al<br>
and in DE 43 04 026 Al and also in DE 196 00 237 Al,<br>
including the German patent-of-addition application DE<br>
196 25 069 Al. But these processes are disadvantageous<br>
and problematic particularly because of the large<br>
amounts of sulphur dioxide released (about 1 kg of SO2<br>
per kg of end product) and also because of the (partly)<br>
associated corrosion problems in the manufacturing<br>
equipment. When used ion exchanger resins, in particu-<br>
lar used cation exchanger resins, are used as starting<br>
materials, there is also the problem that these, al-<br>
though they have been washed with acid, are contami-<br>
nated with cations which then accumulate in the end<br>
product, so that the production of major amounts of<br>
spherocarbon in consistent quality is consequently very<br>
difficult. When ion exchanger precursors, i.e. polymer<br>
spherules without exchanger groups like sulphonic acid<br>
groups, are used, it is additionally necessary to use<br>
large amounts of sulphuric acid and/or oleum for the<br>
crosslinking during the carbonization.<br>
WO 98/07655 Al describes a process for producing spher-<br>
ules of activated carbon wherein a mixture comprising a<br>
distillation residue from diisocyanate production and a<br>
carbonaceous processing assistant with or without one<br>
or more further added substances is processed into<br>
free-flowing spherules which are subsequently carbon-<br>
ized and then activated. This process likewise re-<br>
leases, in the course of the carbonizing step, large<br>
pulses of decomposition products, which is associated<br>
with the problems described above.<br>
Commonly assigned WO 01/83368 Al relates to an improved<br>
process for producing activated carbon wherein the req-<br>
uisite process steps of carbonization on the one hand<br>
and activation on the other are carried out separately<br>
from each other in that the carbonization is carried<br>
out as a continuous operation while the postcarboniza-<br>
tion and activation is carried out as a batch opera-<br>
tion. This process is mainly based on the separation of<br>
the corrosive phase (i.e. precarbonization, associated<br>
with SO2 emissions) from the high-temperature phase (ac-<br>
tivation) . This is because precarbonized starting mate-<br>
rial is no longer corrosive; i.e. corrosive materi-<br>
als/gases are no longer formed when the temperature is<br>
raised any further.<br>
Furthermore, the commonly assigned printed publications<br>
DE 10 2004 036 109 Al, DE 10 2005 036 607 Al and also<br>
WO 2005/016819 Al disclose apparatuses for producing<br>
activated carbon.<br>
However, the processes and apparatuses for producing<br>
activated carbon which are known from the prior art are<br>
usually concerned with improving partial aspects only<br>
and do not provide a holistic approach which takes ac-<br>
count of all problems arising in activated carbon pro-<br>
duction, particularly the high energy requirements, the<br>
use of cost-intensive starting materials and chemicals,<br>
the emission of offgases, the loss of energy in the in-<br>
dividual processing stages, and the like.<br>
The problem underlying the present invention therefore<br>
consists in providing a novel apparatus and process for<br>
producing activated carbon wherein the previously de-<br>
scribed disadvantages associated with the prior art<br>
shall be at least partly avoided or at least amelio-<br>
rated.<br>
The apparatus and process shall make it possible to<br>
produce activated carbon in a less inconvenient, ide-<br>
ally less cost-intensive and also ecologically as well<br>
as economically improved or more efficient manner.<br>
To solve the problem described above, the present in-<br>
vention therefore proposes an apparatus for producing<br>
activated carbon as per Claim 1, a process for produc-<br>
ing activated carbon as per Claim 33 and the use of the<br>
inventive apparatus as per Claim 65; further, advanta-<br>
geous developments each form subject matter of respec-<br>
tive subclaims.<br>
It will be readily understood that particular develop-<br>
ments and embodiments which have been described only in<br>
connection with one aspect of the present invention<br>
also apply mutatis mutandis in relation to the other<br>
aspects of the present invention without this being ex-<br>
pressly stated.<br>
As for the rest, a person skilled in the art may, for a<br>
particular application or on a one-off basis, depart<br>
from the hereinbelow recited numbers, values and ranges<br>
without thereby going outside the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The present invention accordingly provides - in accor-<br>
dance with a first aspect of the present invention - an<br>
apparatus for producing activated carbon, in particular<br>
by carbonization and subsequent activation of polymeric<br>
organic, preferably sulphonated, starting materials,<br>
the apparatus including<br>
- optionally a drying means for drying the starting<br>
materials,<br>
- optionally a sulphonating means for sulphonating<br>
and/or peptizing the optionally previously dried<br>
starting materials, in particular downstream of<br>
the optional drying means,<br>
- a carbonizing means for carbonizing the optionally<br>
previously dried and/or sulphonated and/or pep-<br>
tized starting materials, in particular downstream<br>
of the optional drying means and/or the optional<br>
sulphonating means,<br>
- downstream of the carbonizing means, an activating<br>
means for activating the starting materials previ-<br>
ously carbonized in the carbonizing means,<br>
wherein the apparatus also comprises at least one<br>
offgas-treating means for treating the offgases formed<br>
in operation in the carbonizing means and/or in the ac-<br>
tivating means.<br>
In general, the offgas-treating means comprises at<br>
least one thermal afterburning (TAB) stage.<br>
Thermal afterburning (TAB) herein is to be understood<br>
as referring to an operation wherein the offgases<br>
formed in the carbonization and/or activation are<br>
burned at temperatures above 900°C. This operation con-<br>
verts gases in the offgases, in particular hydrocar-<br>
bons, carbon monoxide and elemental hydrogen, into wa-<br>
ter and carbon dioxide generally and essentially com-<br>
pletely. The remaining offgases are thus less inconven-<br>
iently and consequently less costly to clean/purify and<br>
the resulting heat can be fed back to the carbonization<br>
and/or activation process, saving energy.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
apparatus of the present invention comprises at least<br>
one offgas-treating means for treating the offgases<br>
formed in operation in the carbonizing means on the one<br>
hand and at least one offgas-treating means for treat-<br>
ing the offgases formed in operation in the activating<br>
means, on the other.<br>
The carbonizing means in the apparatus of the present<br>
invention can customarily be constructed as follows:<br>
In general, the carbonizing means comprises at least<br>
one rotary tube, in particular at least one rotary tube<br>
oven.<br>
It will be found advantageous for the carbonizing means<br>
to form a closed system and/or be operable under inert<br>
conditions.<br>
A closed system for the purposes of the present inven-<br>
tion is, in particular, a system which exchanges very<br>
little energy with the environment. Similarly, an ex-<br>
change of matter with the environment, except for the<br>
supplied process gases (for example water vapour, car-<br>
bon dioxide, etc.) and the removed offgases, shall ide-<br>
ally be avoided or at least minimized; thus, any ex-<br>
change of matter only takes place under precisely de-<br>
fined and policed conditions.<br>
By "inert conditions" herein it is meant, in particu-<br>
lar, that the apparatus of the present invention is op-<br>
erated with an inert gas atmosphere and that the proc-<br>
ess of the present invention is conducted under an in-<br>
ert gas atmosphere, said inert gas atmosphere prefera-<br>
bly comprising a noble gas and/or nitrogen atmosphere,<br>
more preferably a nitrogen atmosphere. The inert gas<br>
atmosphere prevents any unintended excessive oxidation<br>
or a burn-out of the material used.<br>
According to the present invention, the carbonizing<br>
means may be operable continuously or quasi-<br>
continuously. Furthermore, the temperature of the car-<br>
bonizing means may be continuously or steppedly vari-<br>
able in operation.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
temperature of the carbonizing means is adjustable in<br>
operation such that two or more, in particular at least<br>
two, preferably four to eight, temperature zones having<br>
temperatures which each differ from the others, pref-<br>
erably having the temperature of the individual tem-<br>
perature stages each rising in the upstream direction,<br>
are present. Alternatively, however, a temperature gra-<br>
dient may also be present, preferably having a tempera-<br>
ture profile which rises in the upstream direction.<br>
A temperature zone for the purposes of the present in-<br>
vention is a heating zone or a region of at least es-<br>
sentially constant temperature. The rise in temperature<br>
in the process flow direction via two or more tempera-<br>
ture zones occasions a relatively constant emission of<br>
sulphur oxides SOX from the starting material to be car-<br>
bonized. More particularly, no spikes in sulphur oxide<br>
emission, in particular in sulphur dioxide emission,<br>
are obtained, so that the means for capturing and<br>
treating the offgases can be made smaller than would be<br>
possible in the event of spikes occurring in the emis-<br>
sion of sulphur oxides. In addition, it is only the<br>
continuous and constant release of sulphur oxides, in<br>
particular sulphur dioxide, that permits a hereinbelow<br>
recycling operation for the sulphur oxides, which would<br>
otherwise be impossible to carry out.<br>
The temperature of the carbonizing means in operation<br>
can vary between wide limits in the realm of the pre-<br>
sent invention. The range in which the temperature of<br>
the carbonizing means is variable is generally from<br>
20°C to 1200°C, in particular from 30°C to 1100°C,<br>
preferably 50°C to 1000°C. It will be found particu-<br>
larly advantageous when a first temperature zone, pref-<br>
erably situated at the inlet or in the process flow di-<br>
rection at the upstream end of the carbonizing means is<br>
adjustable in operation in the range from 50°C to<br>
500°C, in particular 200°C to 450°C. It may addition-<br>
ally be contemplated that a further temperature zone,<br>
preferably situated at the outlet or downstream end of<br>
the carbonizing means, be adjustable in operation in<br>
the range from 800°C to 1200°C, in particular 850°C to<br>
950°C. However, for a particular application or on a<br>
one-off basis, it is possible to depart from the afore-<br>
mentioned values without thereby going outside the<br>
scope of the present invention. A decision to do so is<br>
within the ability or discretion of a person skilled in<br>
this field to decide.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the carbonizing means is subdivided into at<br>
least two sections. A first section, preferably dis-<br>
posed upstream, may be formed by a heatable vibrating<br>
chute and a second section, preferably disposed down-<br>
stream of the first section, may be formed by a rotary<br>
tube, preferably a rotary tube oven, in particular hav-<br>
ing a rising temperature profile or temperature gradi-<br>
ent in the process flow direction in the operating<br>
state.<br>
Vibrating chute herein is to be understood as meaning a<br>
chute or some other conveying means, such as a conveyor<br>
belt for example, which ensures good commixing and uni-<br>
form heating of the material to be carbonized, by sys-<br>
tematic vibration.<br>
In one particular embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the first section of the carbonizing means may be con-<br>
structed to be settable to a constant temperature or<br>
may be constructed to be adjustable to a rising tem-<br>
perature profile or temperature gradient in the process<br>
flow direction, while the second section may be con-<br>
structed to be adjustable to a rising temperature pro-<br>
file or temperature gradient in the process flow direc-<br>
tion. It will be found advantageous in the realm of the<br>
present invention for the temperature in the first sec-<br>
tion of the carbonizing means in the process flow di-<br>
rection to be continuously or steppedly adjustable.<br>
The temperature in the first section of the carbonizing<br>
means in the process flow direction may vary within<br>
wide limits. The range in which the temperature in the<br>
first section of the carbonizing means in the process<br>
flow direction is variable generally extends from 50°C<br>
to 500°C, preferably from 200°C to 450°C. Nonetheless,<br>
for a particular application or on a one-off basis, it<br>
is possible to depart from the aforementioned values<br>
without thereby going outside the scope of the present<br>
invention. A decision to do so is within the ability or<br>
discretion of a person skilled in this field to decide.<br>
In an embodiment which is preferred according to the<br>
present invention, the temperature in the second sec-<br>
tion of the carbonizing means in the process flow di-<br>
rection is adjustable to rise, in particular steppedly<br>
or steplessly, in the process flow direction. More par-<br>
ticularly, the temperature in the second section of the<br>
carbonizing means in the process flow direction is ad-<br>
justable to rise in two or more temperature zones or<br>
with a temperature gradient in the process flow direc-<br>
tion. The temperature in the second section of the car-<br>
bonizing means in the process flow direction may vary<br>
within wide limits. In general, the temperature in the<br>
second section of the carbonizing means in the process<br>
flow direction is settable to rise in the range from<br>
300°C to 1200°C, preferably from 350°C to 950°C, in the<br>
process flow direction. Nonetheless, for a particular<br>
application or on a one-off basis, it is possible to<br>
depart from the aforementioned values without thereby<br>
going outside the scope of the present invention. A de-<br>
cision to do so is within the ability or discretion of<br>
a person skilled in this field to decide.<br>
In an again particularly preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the carbonizing means includes,<br>
preferably at the inlet or in the process flow direc-<br>
tion at the upstream end of the carbonizing means, in<br>
particular at the inlet or in the process flow direc-<br>
tion at the upstream end of the second section of the<br>
carbonizing means, an injective spraying or jetting<br>
means for injective spraying or jetting of water va-<br>
pour, in particular in the form of a water vapour-inert<br>
gas mixture. The proportion of water vapour in the wa-<br>
ter vapour-inert gas mixture may vary within wide lim-<br>
its. In general, the proportion of water vapour in the<br>
water vapour-inert gas mixture is adjustable in the<br>
range from 1% to 30% by volume, in particular 2% to 20%<br>
by volume, preferably 5% to 15% by volume. Nonetheless,<br>
for a particular application or on a one-off basis, it<br>
is possible to depart from the aforementioned values<br>
without thereby going outside the scope of the present<br>
invention. A decision to do so is within the ability or<br>
discretion of a person skilled in this field to decide.<br>
It is preferable in the realm of the present invention<br>
when the injective spraying or jetting means for injec-<br>
tive spraying or jetting of water vapour, in particular<br>
in the form of a water vapour-inert gas mixture, is<br>
situated in the first third, preferably in the first<br>
quarter, of the carbonizing means.<br>
It will further be found to be advantageous in the<br>
realm of the present invention when the carbonizing<br>
means includes, preferably at the outlet or in the<br>
process flow direction at the downstream end of the<br>
carbonizing means, an injective jetting means for in-<br>
troducing oxygen, in particular in the form of an oxy-<br>
gen mixture with at least one further gas, preferably<br>
in the form of air. The volume stream of the introduced<br>
oxygen into the carbonizing means may vary within wide<br>
limits. In general, the injected volume stream of oxy-<br>
gen, in particular in the form of an oxygen mixture<br>
with at least one further gas, preferably in the form<br>
of air, is adjustable in the range from 10 to 500<br>
l/min, in particular 25 to 250 l/min, preferably 50 to<br>
100 l/min. Nonetheless, for a particular application or<br>
on a one-off basis, it is possible to depart from the<br>
aforementioned values without thereby going outside the<br>
scope of the present invention. A decision to do so is<br>
within the ability or discretion of a person skilled in<br>
this field to decide. It will be found to be particu-<br>
larly advantageous when the injective jetting means for<br>
introducing oxygen is situated in the last third, pref-<br>
erably in the last quarter of the reaction sector in<br>
the carbonizing means.<br>
The injective jetting or spraying of water vapour<br>
and/or oxygen substantially prevents, by oxida-<br>
tion/burning of the pyrolysis gases, any condensing of<br>
pyrolysis gases in the base pore system of the acti-<br>
vated carbon being formed; secondly, the heat released<br>
can be used for heating the carbonizing means, saving<br>
the corresponding amount of heating energy. However,<br>
when adding oxygen or an oxygen mixture, care must be<br>
taken to ensure that it comes into contact with the py-<br>
rolysis gases only and not with the carbonizate in or-<br>
der to prevent burn-out thereof.<br>
In general, the carbonizing means has an offgas-<br>
treating means for treating the offgases formed in op-<br>
eration in the carbonizing means connected<br>
to/positioned downstream of it.<br>
It may be contemplated here in particular that the<br>
offgas-treating means comprises at least one thermal<br>
afterburning stage.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the offgas-treating means includes, in par-<br>
ticular upstream of the thermal afterburning stage, at<br>
least one heat exchanger for cooling the offgases re-<br>
sulting from thermal afterburning.<br>
The heat released can be used either for heating the<br>
carbonizing means and/or for heating the hereinbelow<br>
described oxidizing means for sulphur oxides.<br>
Optionally, a drying means for drying the cooled<br>
offgases is positioned downstream of the thermal after-<br>
burning stage and the heat exchanger. The drying means<br>
in turn has a heating means for heating the dried<br>
offgases optionally positioned downstream of it. The<br>
drying of the cooled offgases can be effected either<br>
physically, for example by adsorption, or chemically,<br>
for example by reaction with concentrated sulphuric<br>
acid or phosphorous pentoxide, in which case drying the<br>
offgases chemically is preferred in the realm of the<br>
present invention.<br>
It will be found particularly advantageous in the realm<br>
of the present invention when the offgas-treating means<br>
comprises an oxidizing means for preferably catalyti-<br>
cally oxidizing the sulphur oxides, in particular sul-<br>
phur dioxide, present in the offgases formed in opera-<br>
tion in the carbonizing means, to form sulphur triox-<br>
ide, preferably downstream of the thermal afterburning<br>
stage and the optional heat exchanger, drying means<br>
and/or heating means. It may be contemplated that the<br>
oxidizing means includes at least one oxidation cata-<br>
lyst, preferably vanadium and/or platinum based. It may<br>
further be contemplated that the oxidizing means in-<br>
cludes a returning means for returning the sulphur tri-<br>
oxide into the sulphonating means. The returning of the<br>
sulphur trioxide into the sulphonating means is option-<br>
ally effected via an interposed producing means for the<br>
sulphonating agent.<br>
The sulphur trioxide formed can therefore be returned<br>
into the sulphonating means either directly or indi-<br>
rectly. Directly here is to be understood as meaning<br>
that gaseous sulphur trioxide is returned into the sul-<br>
phonating means without intervening space or time. In-<br>
directly in relation to the mode of returning the sul-<br>
phur trioxide into the sulphonating means, however, is<br>
to be understood as meaning that the sulphur trioxide<br>
is first washed out of the gas stream, in particular<br>
with water or concentrated sulphuric acid in an inter-<br>
posed means, and that the sulphur trioxide is therefore<br>
returned into the sulphonating means in the form of<br>
thus generated concentrated sulphuric acid or oleum.<br>
In one particular embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the oxidizing means includes a separating means for<br>
separating the sulphur trioxide from the other con-<br>
stituents of the offgases, in particular carbon oxides<br>
and/or water vapour and/or nitrogen oxides.<br>
It may be contemplated here that downstream of the<br>
separating means for separating the sulphur trioxide<br>
from the other constituents of the offgases there is<br>
optionally provided a washer for washing the separated-<br>
off other constituents of the offgases.<br>
The activating means downstream of the carbonization<br>
may generally be constructed as follows:<br>
In general, the activating means is operable batchwise.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
activating means forms a closed system; more particu-<br>
larly, the activating means is operable under inert<br>
conditions, in particular at the start of the activat-<br>
ing and/or the start of the heating-up phase. Concern-<br>
ing the terms "closed system" and "inert conditions",<br>
reference can be made to the above observations.<br>
The temperature of the activating means in operation<br>
can vary within wide limits. In general, the tempera-<br>
ture of the activating means is variable in operation<br>
in the range from 300°C to 1800°C, in particular 400°C<br>
to 1500°C, preferably 500°C to 1250°C. Nonetheless, for<br>
a particular application or on a one-off basis, it is<br>
possible to depart from the aforementioned values with-<br>
out thereby going outside the scope of the present in-<br>
vention. A decision to do so is within the ability or<br>
discretion of a person skilled in this field to decide.<br>
More particularly, the temperature of the activating<br>
means in operation is steplessly and/or continuously<br>
variable. It may be contemplated that the activating<br>
means includes at least one heating means, in particu-<br>
lar an electrically operated heating system.<br>
In general, the activating means includes at least one<br>
feeding means for introducing, in particular by jetting<br>
and/or blowing, at least one activating gas, in par-<br>
ticular water vapour and/or carbon dioxide and/or oxy-<br>
gen and/or ammonia. It may be contemplated in the con-<br>
text of the present invention that the feeding means<br>
includes at least one temperature control means for ad-<br>
justing the activating gas (for example water vapour)<br>
to be introduced into the activating means.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the feeding means includes at least one feeding means<br>
for introducing, in particular by jetting, spraying<br>
and/or blowing, water vapour, in particular in the form<br>
of a water vapour-inert gas mixture. The proportion of<br>
water vapour in the water vapour-inert gas mixture can<br>
vary within wide limits. In general, the proportion of<br>
water vapour in the water vapour-inert gas mixture is<br>
adjustable in the range from 5% to 70% by volume, in<br>
particular 10% to 50% by volume, preferably 15% to 40%<br>
by volume. Inert gases for the purposes of the present<br>
invention comprise gases or gaseous mixtures which have<br>
little if any reactivity under the conditions prevail-<br>
ing in the activating step, and/or the reactions of<br>
which have no or at least no negative influence on the<br>
processes taking place in activated carbon production;<br>
the inert gases used for the purposes of the present<br>
invention comprise in particular nitrogen and/or noble<br>
gases (for example argon), preferably nitrogen. None-<br>
theless, for a particular application or on a one-off<br>
basis, it is possible to depart from the aforementioned<br>
values without thereby going outside the scope of the<br>
present invention. A decision to do so is within the<br>
ability or discretion of a person skilled in this field<br>
to decide. It may be contemplated that the water vapour<br>
is introducible at temperatures of from 500°C by jet-<br>
ting, spraying and/or blowing.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the feeding means includes at least one<br>
feeding means for introducing, in particular by jet-<br>
ting, spraying and/or blowing, carbon dioxide, in par-<br>
ticular in the form of a carbon dioxide-inert gas mix-<br>
ture. With regard to the inert gases used, reference<br>
can be made to the above observations. It may be con-<br>
templated in this case that the carbon dioxide is in-<br>
troducible at temperatures of from 800°C by jetting,<br>
spraying and/or blowing.<br>
The burn-out behaviour of the crude activated carbon<br>
and thus its later porosity is chiefly influenced by<br>
the temperature during the activating step and, where<br>
appropriate, the CO2 content in the activating means<br>
during the activating step.<br>
In another particularly preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the feeding means for introducing<br>
the activating gases is supplied by and/or connected to<br>
at least one stockkeeping receptacle which contains the<br>
at least one activating gas.<br>
In general, the activating means has an offgas-treating<br>
means for treating the offgases formed in operation in<br>
the activating means connected to and/or positioned<br>
downstream of it. It will prove to be particularly ad-<br>
vantageous when the offgas-treating means comprises at<br>
least one thermal afterburning stage. The offgases from<br>
the activating means vary with the activating gases<br>
used and comprise in general and at least essentially<br>
hydrogen and carbon oxides, in particular carbon monox-<br>
ide .<br>
It may be provided according to the present invention<br>
that the offgas-treating means includes, in particular<br>
upstream of the thermal afterburning stage, at least<br>
one washer for washing the offgases coming from the<br>
thermal afterburning stage.<br>
After passing through the optional washer, the offgases<br>
which, owing to the thermal afterburning, consist over-<br>
whelmingly of carbon dioxide and water vapour are emit-<br>
ted. However, any excess offgases are supplied to the<br>
washer, i.e. offgases which cannot be further utilized<br>
in the operation. The overwhelming proportion of the<br>
offgases from the activating step is - as described<br>
hereinbelow - utilized as energy supplier in the indi-<br>
vidual operating stages of activated carbon manufac-<br>
ture.<br>
In a very particularly preferred embodiment of the pre-<br>
sent invention, the offgases coming from the offgas-<br>
treating means, in particular from the thermal after-<br>
burning stage, downstream of the activating means are<br>
used for indirect, in particular, heating of the acti-<br>
vating means and/or via a supply line for heating the<br>
stockkeeping receptacle containing the at least one ac-<br>
tivating gas, or the at least one activating gas and/or<br>
for heating the drying means, in particular for creat-<br>
ing a fluidized bed.<br>
For this purpose, the apparatus can be designed in par-<br>
ticular such that the hot offgases at about 1000°C com-<br>
ing from the thermal afterburning (TAB) of the offgases<br>
from the activating means are led on the outside along<br>
the activating means and heat the latter indirectly, so<br>
that at least about 10% to 20% of the activation energy<br>
requirements can be covered in this way. The hot<br>
offgases, which are then still at about 800°C, can sub-<br>
sequently be used for heating the activating gases, in<br>
particular the water vapour. Alternatively, the<br>
offgases of the thermal afterburning stage can also be<br>
used directly, i.e. without prior conducting along the<br>
activating means, for heating the activating gases. It<br>
is particularly preferred according to the present in-<br>
vention when the offgases, optionally after passing<br>
through the stockkeeping receptacle for the activating<br>
gases and/or the heating of the activating gases, are<br>
used for drying the starting materials needed for acti-<br>
vated carbon production, in particular for creating a<br>
fluidized bed, in particular after they have been<br>
cooled down to about 150°C by dilution with air. The<br>
cooled-down offgas can then be emitted via a washer, in<br>
which case - as already indicated above - excess, un-<br>
used offgas can at any time be removed via a washer and<br>
subsequently emitted.<br>
The drying stage upstream of the optional sulphonating<br>
means can be embodied in particular as follows:<br>
In general, the drying means is operable in a fluidized<br>
bed. In particular, the drying means, in particular the<br>
fluidized bed thereof, is operable and/or heatable by<br>
means of offgases from the offgas-treating means, in<br>
particular from the thermal afterburning stage, in par-<br>
ticular by means of offgases from the offgas-treating<br>
means for the activating means.<br>
It can be contemplated in the realm of the present in-<br>
vention that the drying means is operable batchwise.<br>
The temperatures at which the drying means is operable<br>
can vary within wide limits. In general, the drying<br>
means is operable at temperatures in the range from<br>
100°C to 400°C, in particular 100°C to 200°C. Nonethe-<br>
less, for a particular application or on a one-off ba-<br>
sis, it is possible to depart from the aforementioned<br>
values without thereby going outside the scope of the<br>
present invention. A decision to do so is within the<br>
ability or discretion of a person skilled in this field<br>
to decide.<br>
The sulphonating means placed downstream of the op-<br>
tional drying means can be constructed in particular as<br>
follows:<br>
It can be contemplated in the realm of the present in-<br>
vention in particular that the optional sulphonating<br>
means is operable batchwise.<br>
The temperatures at which the sulphonating means is op-<br>
erable can vary within wide limits. In general, the<br>
sulphonating means is operable at temperatures in the<br>
range from 25°C to 400°C, in particular 50°C to 300°C.<br>
Nonetheless, for a particular application or on a one-<br>
off basis, it is possible to depart from the aforemen-<br>
tioned values without thereby going outside the scope<br>
of the present invention. A decision to do so is within<br>
the ability or discretion of a person skilled in this<br>
field to decide.<br>
It will prove advantageous in the realm of the present<br>
invention when a classifying means for classifying the<br>
carbonizate coming from the carbonizing means is pro-<br>
vided between the carbonizing means and the activating<br>
means. This permits classification of the resulting ac-<br>
tivated carbon according to particle size and hence ac-<br>
cording to use properties. Subsequent, purposive mixing<br>
of the individual classes can be used to conform the<br>
resulting activated carbon specifically to the require-<br>
ments needed. This ensures that only carbonizate which<br>
is desired with regard to its particle size passes into<br>
the activating step.<br>
The present invention further provides - in accordance<br>
with a second aspect of the present invention - a proc-<br>
ess for producing activated carbon, in particular by<br>
carbonization and subsequent activation of polymeric<br>
organic, preferably sulphonated, starting materials,<br>
the process comprising the following process steps:<br>
(a) providing polymeric organic starting materials;<br>
then<br>
(b) drying the starting materials if appropriate (i.e.<br>
in the case of undried or moist starting materi-<br>
als) ; then<br>
(c) sulphonating and/or peptizing the possibly previ-<br>
ously dried starting materials if appropriate<br>
(i.e. in the case of unsulphonated starting mate-<br>
rials) ; then<br>
(d) carbonizing the possibly previously dried and/or<br>
sulphonated and/or peptized starting materials;<br>
then<br>
(e) activating the previously carbonized starting ma-<br>
terials;<br>
wherein the offgases from the carbonizing (d) and/or<br>
from the activating (e) are subjected to an offgas<br>
treatment.<br>
It will be found to be advantageous in particular in<br>
the realm of the present invention for the polymeric<br>
organic starting material to be used to be in particu-<br>
lar ion exchanger resins and their precursors, for ex-<br>
ample sulphonated ion exchanger resins and also their<br>
unsulphonated precursors and/or divinylbenzene-<br>
crosslinked polystyrenes, for example styrene-divinyl-<br>
benzene copolymers, in sulphonated or unsulphonated<br>
form, preferably having a divinylbenzene content of for<br>
example 1% to 10% by weight of divinylbenzene, based on<br>
the copolymer.<br>
The offgas treatment generally comprises at least one<br>
thermal afterburning stage.<br>
It will be found advantageous in the realm of the pre-<br>
sent invention when the offgases from the carbonizing<br>
and the offgases from the activating are each subjected<br>
to an offgas treatment.<br>
The offgases from the carbonizing and the offgases from<br>
the activating are preferably each subjected to a sepa-<br>
rate offgas treatment since they have different compo-<br>
sitions and therefore the requirements for their treat-<br>
ment are different; for example, the offgases from the<br>
carbonizing have to be freed of sulphur oxides.<br>
In general, the carbonizing is conducted in at least<br>
one rotary tube, in particular in at least one rotary<br>
tube oven. It will further be found advantageous in the<br>
realm of the present invention when the carbonizing is<br>
conducted in a closed system and/or the carbonizing is<br>
conducted under inert conditions. According to the pre-<br>
sent invention, the carbonizing may be operated con-<br>
tinuously or quasi-continuously and/or the temperature<br>
during the carbonizing may be closed and/or open loop<br>
controlled continuously or steppedly. In one preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the temperature<br>
during the carbonizing is closed and/or open loop con-<br>
trolled such that the carbonizing is conducted in two<br>
or more, in particular in at least two, preferably in<br>
four to eight, temperature zones having temperatures<br>
which each differ from the others, preferably having<br>
the temperature of the individual temperature stages<br>
each rising in the upstream direction. Alternatively,<br>
in the realm of the present invention, the carbonizing<br>
may be conducted in a temperature gradient, preferably<br>
having a rising temperature profile in the upstream di-<br>
rection .<br>
The temperature during the carbonizing can vary within<br>
wide limits. In general, the temperature during the<br>
carbonizing is closed and/or open loop controlled in<br>
the range from 20°C to 1200°C, in particular 30°C to<br>
1100°C, preferably 50°C to 1000°C. Nonetheless, for a<br>
particular application or on a one-off basis, it is<br>
possible to depart from the aforementioned values with-<br>
out thereby going outside the scope of the present in-<br>
vention. A decision to do so is within the ability or<br>
discretion of a person skilled in this field to decide.<br>
It may be contemplated in the realm of the present in-<br>
vention that a first temperature zone, preferably situ-<br>
ated at the inlet or in the process flow direction at<br>
the upstream end of the carbonizing (means) , is ad-<br>
justed in the range from 50°C to 500°C, in particular<br>
200°C to 450°C. It may further be contemplated that a<br>
further temperature zone, preferably situated at the<br>
outlet or downstream end of the carbonizing (means), is<br>
adjusted in the range from 800°C to 1200°C, in particu-<br>
lar 850°C to 950°C. In these cases too the recited val-<br>
ues only mark the customary ranges hitherto preferred.<br>
However, for a particular application or on a one-off<br>
basis, it is readily possible to depart from the afore-<br>
mentioned values without thereby going outside the<br>
scope of the present invention. A decision to do so is<br>
within the ability or discretion of a person skilled in<br>
this field to decide.<br>
The carbonizing is generally subdivided into at least<br>
two part-steps. It may be contemplated that a first,<br>
preferably upstream, part-step is conducted in a heated<br>
vibrating chute and a second part-step, preferably con-<br>
ducted downstream of the first section, is conducted in<br>
a rotary tube, preferably in a rotary tube oven, in<br>
particular having a rising temperature profile or tem-<br>
perature gradient in the process flow direction.<br>
According to the present invention, the first part-step<br>
may be conducted with a constant temperature or with a<br>
temperature profile or temperature gradient rising in<br>
the process flow direction and/or the second part-step<br>
may be conducted with a temperature profile or tempera-<br>
ture gradient rising in the process flow direction.<br>
Furthermore, in the realm of the present invention, the<br>
temperature in the first carbonizing part-step in the<br>
process flow direction may be closed loop controlled<br>
continuously or steppedly. The temperatures in the<br>
first carbonizing part-step in the process flow direc-<br>
tion may vary within wide limits. In general, the tem-<br>
perature in the first carbonizing part-step in the<br>
process flow direction is closed loop controlled con-<br>
tinuously or steppedly in the range from 50°C to 500°C,<br>
preferably 200°C to 450°C. Nonetheless, for a particu-<br>
lar application or on a one-off basis, it is possible<br>
to depart from the aforementioned values without<br>
thereby going outside the scope of the present inven-<br>
tion. A decision to do so is within the ability or dis-<br>
cretion of a person skilled in this field to decide.<br>
Furthermore, in the realm of the present invention, the<br>
temperature in the second carbonizing part-step in the<br>
process flow direction may be closed loop controlled to<br>
be rising, in particular steppedly or steplessly, in<br>
particular in two or more temperature zones or with a<br>
temperature gradient, in the process flow direction.<br>
The temperature in the second carbonizing part-step in<br>
the process flow direction may vary within wide limits.<br>
In general, the temperature in the second carbonizing<br>
part-step in the process flow direction is closed loop<br>
controlled to rise in the process flow direction in the<br>
range from 300°C to 1200°C, preferably from 350°C to<br>
950°C. Nonetheless, for a particular application or on<br>
a one-off basis, it is possible to depart from the<br>
aforementioned values without thereby going outside the<br>
scope of the present invention. A decision to do so is<br>
within the ability or discretion of a person skilled in<br>
this field to decide.<br>
In one particular embodiment of the present invention,<br>
water vapour, in particular in the form of a water va-<br>
pour-inert gas mixture, is injected by spraying or jet-<br>
ting during the carbonizing, preferably at the inlet or<br>
in the process flow direction at the upstream end of<br>
the carbonizing (means), in particular at the inlet or<br>
in the process flow direction at the upstream end of<br>
the second section of the carbonizing means. The pro-<br>
portion of water vapour in the water vapour-inert gas<br>
mixture can vary within wide limits. Generally, the<br>
proportion of water vapour in the water vapour-inert<br>
gas mixture is adjusted in the range from 1% to 30% by<br>
volume, in particular 2% to 20% by volume, preferably<br>
5% to 15% by volume. Nonetheless, for a particular ap-<br>
plication or on a one-off basis, it is possible to de-<br>
part from the aforementioned values without thereby go-<br>
ing outside the scope of the present invention. A deci-<br>
sion to do so is within the ability or discretion of a<br>
person skilled in this field to decide.<br>
It will further be found advantageous in the realm of<br>
the present invention when oxygen, in particular in the<br>
form of an oxygen mixture with at least one further<br>
gas, preferably in the form of air, is introduced or<br>
injected during the carbonizing, preferably at the out-<br>
let or in the process flow direction at the downstream<br>
end of the carbonizing (means) . The introduced or in-<br>
jected volume stream of oxygen or of an oxygen mixture<br>
can vary within wide limits. In general, the introduced<br>
or injected volume stream of oxygen, in particular in<br>
the form of an oxygen mixture with at least one further<br>
gas, preferably in the form of air, is adjusted in the<br>
range from 10 to 500 l/min, in particular 25 to<br>
250 l/min, preferably 50 to 100 l/min. Nonetheless, for<br>
a particular application or on a one-off basis, it is<br>
possible to depart from the aforementioned values with-<br>
out thereby going outside the scope of the present in-<br>
vention. A decision to do so is within the ability or<br>
discretion of a person skilled in this field to decide.<br>
In general, the carbonizing is followed by treating the<br>
offgases formed in the carbonizing. It may be contem-<br>
plated here that the offgas treatment comprises at<br>
least one thermal afterburning stage. In a particularly<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
offgas treatment is followed, in particular at a point<br>
upstream of the thermal afterburning stage, by the<br>
offgases resulting from the thermal afterburning stage<br>
being cooled, in particular by means of a heat ex-<br>
changer. Optionally, the cooling of the offgases is<br>
followed by drying of the cooled offgases. In turn, the<br>
drying of the offgases may optionally be followed by<br>
heating of the dried offgases.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the offgas treatment comprises an oxidation,<br>
preferably a catalytic oxidation, of the sulphur ox-<br>
ides, in particular sulphur dioxide, present in the<br>
offgases formed in the carbonizing, to form sulphur<br>
trioxide, preferably downstream of the thermal after-<br>
burning stage and the optional cooling, drying and/or<br>
heating. It may be contemplated that the oxidation is<br>
conducted by means and/or in the presence of at least<br>
one oxidation catalyst, preferably vanadium and/or<br>
platinum based. It may be further contemplated that the<br>
sulphur trioxide generated in the oxidation is returned<br>
into the sulphonation and/or peptization. Optionally<br>
the sulphur trioxide generated in the oxidation is re-<br>
turned into the sulphonation and/or peptization after<br>
an interposed process step for producing the sulphonat-<br>
ing agent.<br>
It will further prove particularly advantageous in the<br>
realm of the present invention when the sulphur triox-<br>
ide generated in the oxidation is separated from the<br>
other constituents of the offgases, in particular car-<br>
bon oxides and/or water vapour and/or nitrogen oxides.<br>
It may be contemplated here that the separating is op-<br>
tionally followed by washing of the separated-off other<br>
constituents of the offgases.<br>
The carbonizing is then followed, optionally after an<br>
interposed classifying step for the carbonizate, by ac-<br>
tivating the previously produced carbonizate. In gen-<br>
eral, the activating is conducted batchwise.<br>
It will further be found to be advantageous according<br>
to the present invention when the activating is con-<br>
ducted in a closed system and/or when the activating is<br>
conducted under inert conditions, in particular at the<br>
start of the activating and/or at the start of the<br>
heating-up phase.<br>
The temperature during activating can vary within wide<br>
limits. In general, the temperature during activating<br>
is set in the range from 300°C to 1800°C, in particular<br>
400°C to 1500°C, preferably 500°C to 1250°C. Nonethe-<br>
less, for a particular application or on a one-off ba-<br>
sis, it is possible to depart from the aforementioned<br>
values without thereby going outside the scope of the<br>
present invention. A decision to do so is within the<br>
ability or discretion of a person skilled in this field<br>
to decide.<br>
It may be contemplated in this connection that the tem-<br>
perature during activating is set steplessly and/or<br>
continuously, preferably by means of a heating means,<br>
in particular an electrically operated heating system.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the activating comprises introducing, in<br>
particular by jetting and/or blowing, at least one ac-<br>
tivating gas, in particular water vapour and/or carbon<br>
dioxide and/or oxygen and/or ammonia.<br>
It may be contemplated in the realm of the present in-<br>
vention that the activating gas introduced into the ac-<br>
tivating step is heated to a defined temperature.<br>
When two or more different activating gases are used,<br>
these may be introduced into the activating step at the<br>
same time or at different times, in which case intro-<br>
ducing at different times is preferable in the realm of<br>
the present invention. Similarly, the activating gases<br>
can be introduced at like or different temperatures.<br>
According to the present invention, the activating com-<br>
prises introducing, in particular by jetting, spraying<br>
and blowing, at least water vapour, in particular in<br>
the form of a water vapour-inert gas mixture, as acti-<br>
vating gas.<br>
The proportion of water vapour in the water vapour-<br>
inert gas mixture can vary within wide limits. In gen-<br>
eral, the proportion of water vapour in the water va-<br>
pour-inert gas mixture is set in the range from 5% to<br>
70% by volume, in particular 10% to 50% by volume,<br>
preferably 15% to 40% by volume. Nonetheless, for a<br>
particular application or on a one-off basis, it is<br>
possible to depart from the aforementioned values with-<br>
out thereby going outside the scope of the present in-<br>
vention. A decision to do so is within the ability or<br>
discretion of a person skilled in this field to decide.<br>
It may be contemplated in this connection that the wa-<br>
ter vapour is introduced at temperatures from 500°C by<br>
jetting, spraying and/or blowing during the activating.<br>
It will likewise prove advantageous in the realm of the<br>
present invention when the activating comprises intro-<br>
ducing carbon dioxide, particularly in the form of a<br>
carbon dioxide-inert gas mixture, as an activating gas,<br>
in particular in addition to water vapour being used as<br>
activating gas, in particular by jetting, spraying<br>
and/or blowing. It may be contemplated that the carbon<br>
dioxide is introduced at temperatures from 800°C by<br>
jetting, spraying and/or blowing.<br>
As already noted in the observations concerning the ap-<br>
paratus of the present invention, the temperatures and<br>
the carbon dioxide content during the activating influ-<br>
ence the burn-out behaviour of the material to be acti-<br>
vated and thus the material properties of the resulting<br>
activated carbon.<br>
In one particular embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the at least one activating gas is fed into the acti-<br>
vating step from a stockkeeping receptacle via a feed-<br>
ing means.<br>
In general, the activating is followed by a treatment<br>
being conducted on the offgases formed in the activat-<br>
ing. It may be contemplated in this connection that the<br>
offgas treatment comprises at least one thermal after-<br>
burning stage.<br>
According to the present invention, the thermal after-<br>
burning stage may be followed by a wash being conducted<br>
of the offgases from the thermal afterburning stage.<br>
After passing through the washer, the offgases which,<br>
owing to the thermal afterburning, consist overwhelm-<br>
ingly of carbon dioxide and water vapour, are emitted.<br>
However, only excess offgases are routed to the wash<br>
directly, the overwhelming portion being utilized as an<br>
energy supplier in the various operations of activated<br>
carbon manufacture.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the offgases coming from the offgas treat-<br>
ment (i.e. offgas treatment of the offgases coming from<br>
the activating), in particular from the thermal after-<br>
burning, are used for indirect, in particular, heating<br>
for the activating (means) and/or for heating the at<br>
least one activating gas and/or for drying, in particu-<br>
lar for creating a fluidized bed. For further details<br>
concerning using the offgases from the activating, in<br>
particular after passing through the thermal afterburn-<br>
ing, reference can be made to the above elucidations<br>
concerning the apparatus of the present invention.<br>
As observed above, a drying step (a) is conducted in<br>
the case of undried/moist starting materials before the<br>
actual production of activated carbon. According to the<br>
present invention, the drying can be conducted in a<br>
fluidized bed; preferably, the drying, in particular<br>
the fluidized bed thereof, can be operated by means of<br>
offgases coming from the offgas treatment (i.e. the<br>
offgas treatment of the offgases from the activating),<br>
in particular from the thermal afterburning. In par-<br>
ticular, in the realm of the present invention, the<br>
drying can be operated batchwise. The temperatures in<br>
relation to the drying step can vary within wide lim-<br>
its. In general, the drying is operated at temperatures<br>
in the range from 100°C to 400°C, in particular 100°C<br>
to 200°C. Nonetheless, for a particular application or<br>
on a one-off basis, it is possible to depart from the<br>
aforementioned values without thereby going outside the<br>
scope of the present invention. A decision to do so is<br>
within the ability or discretion of a person skilled in<br>
this field to decide.<br>
As observed above, a process step of sulphonating<br>
and/or peptizing is conducted before the carbonizing in<br>
the case of unsulphonated starting materials. This<br>
process step of sulphonating and/or peptizing comprises<br>
the actual sulphonation (i.e. the introduction of sul-<br>
phonic acid groups) and also, optionally, the peptiza-<br>
tion (i.e. the dissolving out of monomeric, dimeric and<br>
oligomeric units remaining in the starting material and<br>
the deposition of said units on the outer surface of<br>
the particles of the starting material). In particular,<br>
in the realm of the present invention, the sulphonating<br>
and/or peptizing can be operated batchwise.<br>
The sulphonating/peptizing temperature can vary within<br>
wide limits. In general, the sulphonating/peptizing is<br>
operated at temperatures in the range from 25°C to<br>
400°C, in particular 50°C to 300°C. Nonetheless, for a<br>
particular application or on a one-off basis, it is<br>
possible to depart from the aforementioned values with-<br>
out thereby going outside the scope of the present in-<br>
vention. A decision to do so is within the ability or<br>
discretion of a person skilled in this field to decide.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a process step of classifying the carboni-<br>
zate coming from the carbonizing can also be conducted<br>
between the carbonizing step and the activating step.<br>
For further details concerning the process of the pre-<br>
sent invention, reference can be made to the above ob-<br>
servations concerning the apparatus of the present in-<br>
vention, which hold mutatis mutandis in relation to the<br>
process of the present invention.<br>
The apparatus of the present invention and also the<br>
process of the present invention have a number of ad-<br>
vantages over the prior art:<br>
The oxidation of the sulphur-containing compounds to<br>
sulphur trioxide and the sulphur trioxide being re-<br>
turned into the sulphonation substantially avoids the<br>
emission of sulphur-containing offgases which would<br>
otherwise have to be inconveniently and cost-<br>
intensively cleaned/purified.<br>
A large proportion of the sulphonating agent used can<br>
be recovered, so that only a small proportion of the<br>
sulphonating agent is actually consumed and has to be<br>
replaced.<br>
Recovering the sulphonating agent also dramatically re-<br>
duces the total amount of all offgases generated, in<br>
particular the corrosive acidic offgases.<br>
Thermal afterburning of the offgases formed in the car-<br>
bonizing/activating ensures that the offgases, after<br>
removal of the sulphur-containing compounds, consist<br>
almost exclusively of the innocuous combustion residues<br>
carbon dioxide and water vapour.<br>
Afterburning generates heat whereby the energy require-<br>
ments of the activated carbon production process can be<br>
distinctly reduced; for instance, the energy require-<br>
ments of the activating step can be reduced by at least<br>
10% to 20% by the thermal afterburning of the offgases<br>
formed.<br>
Hot offgases from the thermal afterburning, moreover,<br>
can also be used for heating the activating gases<br>
and/or for drying the starting materials used for the<br>
activated carbon production.<br>
Classifying the crude activated carbon before activa-<br>
tion makes it possible to separate or else to specifi-<br>
cally mix the individual classes, so that the resulting<br>
activated carbon can be optimally conformed to the in-<br>
tended end-use.<br>
The apparatus of the present invention and the process<br>
of the present invention make it possible to maintain<br>
the SO2 emission during carbonization at such a constant<br>
level as to allow a sulphur trioxide production process<br>
to be carried out and hence for the sulphonating agent<br>
to be recovered.<br>
The sole figure is a schematic and exemplary depiction<br>
of a typical, preferred embodiment of the inventive ap-<br>
paratus _1 and of the inventive process sequence:<br>
As the figure shows, when nondried/moist starting mate-<br>
rial is used, a drying operation, preferably in a flu-<br>
idized bed, is optionally initially carried out in 2,<br>
which in the case of unsulphonated starting materials<br>
is then followed optionally at 3 by a sulphonation<br>
and/or peptization. The dried and sulphonated/peptized<br>
starting material, for example based on sulphonated<br>
styrene-divinylbenzene polymers, for example in the<br>
form of so-called sulphonated ion exchanger resins of<br>
the gel type or of the macroporous type, is then subse-<br>
quently subjected to carbonization at 4, whereafter the<br>
carbonizate resulting from this stage is subjected to<br>
activation at 5, resulting in the desired end product<br>
(i.e. activated carbon). As the figure further shows,<br>
the acidic, in particular, offgases, coming from the<br>
carbonization 4 are initially subjected, at 4A, to<br>
thermal afterburning (TAB) and thereafter - optionally<br>
after cooling, drying and renewed heating of these<br>
gases - at 4B to a catalytic oxidation, in particular<br>
in the presence of vanadium pentoxide as oxidation<br>
catalyst, so that sulphur dioxide SO2 present in the<br>
offgas is converted to sulphur trioxide SO3, which can<br>
be returned, via 4C, back into the sulphonation 3, in<br>
particular in the form of concentrated sulphuric<br>
acid/oleum. The remaining offgases from the catalytic<br>
oxidation 4B, however, are then emitted, optionally af-<br>
ter a further downstream wash 4D, these offgases com-<br>
prising essentially carbon dioxide CO2, water vapour H2O<br>
and only very minor amounts of nitrogen oxides NOX and<br>
sulphur oxides SOX.<br>
The offgases from the activation 5, in particular hy-<br>
drogen H2 and carbon monoxide CO, are similarly sub-<br>
jected to thermal afterburning (TAB) 5C, and the still<br>
hot offgases coming from the thermal afterburning can<br>
be used firstly to co-heat the activating means 5, sec-<br>
ondly to heat up the activating gases, or the relevant<br>
receptacle for the activating gases, in particular wa-<br>
ter vapour, at 5B, in which case the heated activating<br>
gases, in particular water vapour, are then supplied to<br>
the activating step via 5A, and finally also to supply<br>
the requisite heat and the fluidized bed for the drying<br>
stage 2. Any unused offgases from thermal afterburning<br>
(TAB) 5C can then be emitted, optionally after a washer<br>
5D, as offgases, in particular consisting mainly of<br>
carbon dioxide CO2 and water vapour H2O etc.<br>
In a typical embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
apparatus of the present invention or the process of<br>
the present invention can be executed as follows:<br>
The starting material, for example styrene-divinyl-<br>
benzene copolymers, in particular ion exchangers of the<br>
gel type or of the macroporous type, are - if present<br>
in nondried/moist form - subjected to drying in a first<br>
stage, said drying of the starting material being pref-<br>
erably effected in a fluidized bed, preferably by util-<br>
izing rejected heat from the activating step. The dry-<br>
ing is typically carried out batchwise/discontinuously<br>
(for example 1 m3 of starting material per batch).<br>
Unsulphonated starting materials are subjected in a<br>
second stage, downstream of the drying stage, to a sul-<br>
phonation/peptization. For this purpose, the starting<br>
polymers or to be more precise ion exchangers are con-<br>
tacted with a suitable sulphonating agent, in particu-<br>
lar concentrated sulphuric acid/oleum (for example 15%<br>
oleum), in particular at temperatures of 100°C to<br>
400°C, preferably 150 to 250°C. Depending on the de-<br>
sired pore system, different quantitative ratios of<br>
sulphonating agent can be used and, for example, re-<br>
acted according to a temperature characteristic, se-<br>
lectable by a person skilled in the art, until the<br>
starting material has been sulphonated and is present<br>
in free-flowing form. This stage provides not just a<br>
sulphonation but generally also a so-called peptiza-<br>
tion, i.e. monomer, dimer and oligomer residues are<br>
dissolved out of the starting materials and subse-<br>
quently redeposited on the surface of the particles,<br>
these redepositions resulting in the course of the sub-<br>
sequent carbonization in a very hard and hence abra-<br>
sion-resistant pseudographite layer being formed on the<br>
surface of the particles.<br>
A subsequent, third, stage of the process then involves<br>
the dry and sulphonated starting material being carbon-<br>
ized/pyrolyzed, preferably continuously or quasi-<br>
continuously, in particular in a closed system. Car-<br>
bonization is typically carried out under inert reac-<br>
tion conditions. The material can typically be dis-<br>
charged onto a heatable vibrating chute, customarily<br>
under inert gas atmosphere, in which case the material<br>
can be heated to 350°C, for example, in the course of<br>
60 minutes for example. This vibrating chute then feeds<br>
into a likewise continuously or quasi-continuously op-<br>
erated rotary tube oven having a temperature of typi-<br>
cally 400°C at the inlet side. In the course of trans-<br>
port in the rotary tube, the material is then typically<br>
heated to, for example, 900°C via six to eight heating<br>
zones. Preference is given to the simultaneous addition<br>
of water vapour, preferably of a corresponding nitro-<br>
gen-water vapour mixture (for example 10% to 30% by<br>
volume of water vapour) , from the oven inlet side and<br>
the addition of air/oxygen (for example 50 to<br>
100 l/min) from the oven outlet side in order that the<br>
combustion of resulting pyrolysis gases in the reaction<br>
tube may be made possible. This can be used to achieve<br>
several positive effects. First, condensing of pyroly-<br>
sis gases in the base pore system of the starting mate-<br>
rial is substantially prevented, and secondly the com-<br>
bustion in the reaction tube can be used to utilize the<br>
heat content and the input of electric power into the<br>
oven-heating system can be minimized. After carboniza-<br>
tion/pyrolysis is concluded, the material is typically<br>
accessible and has an internal surface area (BET) of<br>
for example 400 to 800 m2/g. It is preferable when the<br>
particle shape is spherical, in accordance with the<br>
starting materials.<br>
A downstream, fourth stage then involves the initially<br>
produced carbonizate being activated. In the activating<br>
step, the material, preferably after prior classifica-<br>
tion, is filled in narrow particle size fractions into<br>
a rotary tube oven having internals and is heated under<br>
an inert atmosphere to about 960°C for example, while<br>
the atmosphere can have water vapour added to it (for<br>
example 20% to 30% by volume) , preferably in the form<br>
of a nitrogen/water vapour mixture, from about 600°C<br>
for example. Depending on the degree of activation de-<br>
sired and depending on the pore system desired, the at-<br>
mosphere can be admixed with carbon dioxide CO2 from<br>
about 900°C for example, and/or the temperature can be<br>
varied, for example to influence the burn-out behav-<br>
iour. The gases, in particular hydrogen H2 and carbon<br>
monoxide CO, formed in the activating step can advanta-<br>
geously be used for indirect heating of the activating<br>
pipe. As a result, about 20% of the total energy re-<br>
quirements of the apparatus can be coupled out of the<br>
process.<br>
As far as the offgas treatment is concerned, the<br>
offgases coming from the carbonization/pyrolysis can<br>
initially be afterburned in a thermal afterburning<br>
stage (TAB), in particular via excess air, to oxidize<br>
all organic constituents; subsequently, the SC&gt;2-rich<br>
offgas is advantageously directed into a heat exchanger<br>
and cooled, in order that it may be dehumidified in a<br>
gas-drying stage, by means of sulphuric acid, and after<br>
subsequent heating, for example to temperatures of<br>
about 480°C, the gas can be led via a plurality of<br>
stages to an oxidation catalyst (for example vanadium-<br>
based oxidation catalyst, for example vanadium pentox-<br>
ide) until the sulphur dioxide SO2 has been oxidized to<br>
sulphur trioxide SO3. After all the SO2 has been oxi-<br>
dized to SO3, the SO3-containing offgas is typically<br>
cooled again and the SO3 is washed out by means of con-<br>
centrated sulphuric acid, so that the SO3 can be re-<br>
turned into the sulphonating step. Thus, a complete re-<br>
cycling circuit is provided for sulphonating agents and<br>
there is no need for costly and inconvenient disposal.<br>
In order that the design may be economically and ecol-<br>
ogically realizable, it is of advantage when the quan-<br>
tities of offgas generated are relatively constant,<br>
which can be achieved by the SO2-relevant process steps,<br>
in particular the carbonization/pyrolysis, being made<br>
continuous/quasicontinuous and the SO2 emission being<br>
maintained approximately constant, i.e. without spikes<br>
in the SO2 emission.<br>
The treatment of the offgases from the activating step<br>
can be carried out in the manner previously described<br>
(i.e. thermal afterburning and use of the offgases com-<br>
ing from the thermal afterburning for heating the acti-<br>
vating gas, in particular water vapour, and/or for in-<br>
direct heating of the activating oven and/or for use in<br>
fluidized bed drying).<br>
The present invention finally also provides - in accor-<br>
dance with a third aspect of the present invention -<br>
for the use of the apparatus of the present invention,<br>
as previously described, for producing activated car-<br>
bon. As previously described, the production of acti-<br>
vated carbon in the course of the use according to the<br>
present invention is effected by carbonization and sub-<br>
sequent activation of polymeric organic, preferably<br>
sulphonated, starting materials. For further details<br>
concerning the use according to the present invention,<br>
reference can be made to the above observations con-<br>
cerning the apparatus of the present invention and the<br>
process of the present invention, which apply mutatis<br>
mutandis to the use according to the present invention.<br>
Further refinements, modifications, variations and also<br>
advantages of the present invention will become readily<br>
apparent to and realizable by the ordinarily skilled<br>
after reading the description without their having to<br>
depart from the realm of the present invention.<br>
