Tina invention reflates to aproceas for fte production of vitamin B« from l-deoxy-D-threo-pentulose (referred to hereinafter as DTP) and 4-hydroxy-L-threonine (HT). T1~— expressioo 'Mtamin B1" as used in the present invention includes pyridoxol, pyridoxal and pyridoxamine.<br>
Vitamin Be, is one of the essential vitamins for the nutrition ot animals, plants ana microorganisms, and is also very important as a medicine or food additive for humans. The object of the present invention is to provide a highly efficient process for the enzymatic production of vitamin B1 from DTP and HT.<br>
There are many studies on the fermentative production of vitamin B6. Various<br>
microorganisms belonging to the genera Saccharomyces [G. H. Scherr and M. E.<br>
Rafelson. J. Appl. Bactenol. 25, 187-194 (1962)], Pichia [N. Nishino, K. Fujii. and T.<br>
Kamikubo, Agric. Bioi. Chem. 37, 553-559 (1973)], Klebsiella [R. Suzue and Y.<br>
Haruna. J. Vitaminol. 16, 154-159 {1910)], Aclvomobacter [M. Ishida and K. Shimura,<br>
Agric. Biol. Chem. 34. 327-334 (1970)], Bacillus [W. Pflug and F. Lingens, Hoppe-<br>
Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 359, 559-570 (1978)] and Flavobacterium [Y. Tani, T.<br>
Nakamatsu, T. Izumi and K. Ogata, Agric. Bioi.'Chem. 36, 189-197 (1972)] are known<br>
to produce vitamin Be. But no commercially attractive fermentation process for the<br>
production of vitamin B1 has become known so far. More recently, there has been	,<br>
described in the European Patent Publication 0 765 938 A2 a process for the	■<br>
i fermentative production of vitamin Be by cultivating a microorganism<br>
belonging to the genus Rhizobium capable of producing said vitamin in a<br>
culture medium under aerobic conditions; the culture medium may contain,<br>
apart from assimilable carbon and digestible nitrogen sources, inorganic<br>
salts and other nutrients, further substances which improve the vitamin Be<br>
titer, such as DTP and HT. Although this more recently known process<br>
produces vitamin Be in high }ield, there is room for improvement of its<br>
efficiency.<br>
The present invention makes it possible to produce vitamin B« from DTP and HT in higher efficiency than hitherto. It has been found that the cell-free extract prepared<br><br>
from the cells of a microorganism such as of the genus Rhizobium, Sinorhizobium, Flavobacterium, Chryseobacterium, Lactobacillus, Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Klebsiella, Escherichia, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Enterobacter, Serratia, Corynebacterium, Brevibacterium, Exiguobacterium, Saccharomyces, Yamadazma, Pichia or Candida is capable of producing vitamin Be from DTP and HT in the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP"1), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD"1) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP).<br>
The present invention is thus concerned with a process for the enzymatic production of vitamin Bs from DTP and HT which comprises contacting DTP and HT with an enzyme reaction system prepared from cells of a microorganism capable of producing vitamin BG from DTP and HT, said contacting occurring in the presence of NADP"1, NAD"1 and ATP. The present invention is further concerned with a process for the enzymatic production of vitamin Be which comprises contacting DTP and HT with an enzyme reaction system containing the cell-free extract derived from a microorganism capable of producing vitamin Bg, such as one belonging to the genus Rhizobium, Sinorhizobium, Flavobacterium, Chryseobacterium, Lactobacillus, Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Klebsiella, Escherichia, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Enterobacter, Serratia, Corynebacterium, Brevibacterium,Exiguobacterium, Saccharomyces, Yamadazma, Pichia or Candida, in the presence of NADP"1, NAD"1 and ATP.<br>
The content of vitamin B1 in a reaction mixture can be determined by a bioassay with Saccharomyces carlsbergensis ATCC 9080 according to the method of D. R. Osborne and P. Voogt. [The Analysis of Nutrients in Foods, Academic Press, London, 224-227 (1978)].<br>
For can-ying out the process of the present invention, cells of the microorganism, e.g. one belonging to the genus Rhizobium, Sinorhizobium, Flavobacterium, Chryseobacterium, Lactobacillus, Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Klebsiella, Escherichia, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Enterobacter, Serratia, Corynebacterium, Brevibacterium,Exiguobacterium, Saccharomyces, Yamadazma, Pichia ox Candida, cdin be produced by cultivating said microorganism in a medium containing assimilable carbon sources, digestible nitrogen sources, inorganic salts and other nutrients necessary for the growth of the microorganism. As the carbon sources, for example, glucose, fructose, lactose, galactose, sucrose, maltose, starch, dextrin and glycerol may be<br><br>
employed. As the nitrogen sources, for example, peptone, yeast extract, soybean powder, com steep liquor, meat extract, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, urea, and mixtures thereof may be employed. Further, as the inorganic salts sulfates, hydrochlorides or phosphates of calcium, magnesium, zinc, manganese, cobalt and iron may be employed. And, if necessary, conventional nutrient factors or an antifoaming agent, such as animal oil, vegetable oil or mineral oil, can also be included in the culture medium. The pH of the culture medium may be from about 5 to about 9, preferably from about 6 to about 8. The temperature range for the cultivation is suitably from about 10°C to about 45°C, preferably from about 25°C to about 40°C. The cultivation time is normally from about 1 to about 5 days, preferably from about 1 to about 3 days. Aeration and agitation during the cultivation usually give favorable results.<br>
The microorganisms which can be used in the process of the present invention include all the strains belonging to the genera Rhizobium, Sinorhizobium, Flavobacterium, Chryseobacterium, Lactobacillus, Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Klebsiella, Escherichia, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Enterobacter, Serratia, Corynebacterium, Brevibacterium, Exiguobacterium, Saccharomyces, Yamadazma, Pichia and Candida. Such microorganisms are available from a public depository (culture collection) to anyone upon request, such as the Institute of Fermentation, Osaka, Japan (IFO); examples of such deposited strains are Rhizobium meliloti (also known as Sinorhizobium meliloti) IFO 14782 (DSM No. 10226), Flavobacterium indologenes (also known as Chryseobacterium indologenes) IFO 14944, Lactobacillus brevis IFO 13110, Arthrobacter nicotianae IFO 14234, Bacillus subtilis IFO 3007, Klebsiella planticola EFO 3317, Escherichia coli EFO 13168, Pseudomonasputida IFO 3738, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (also known as Pseudomonas maltophilia or Xanthomonas maltophilia) IFO 12692, Enterobacter cloacae IFO 3320, Serratia marcescens IFO 12648, Corynebacterium ammoniagenes (also known as Brevibacterium ammoniagenes) IFO 12612, Corynebacterium glutamicum (also known as Brevibacterium glutamicum) IFO 12168, Exiguobacterium acetylicum (also known as Brevibacterium acetylicum) IFO 12146, Pichia guilliermondii (also known as Yamadazyma guilliermondii) IFO 10106, Saccharomyces cerevisiae IFO 0304 and IFO 0306 and Candida tropicalis IFO 0199 and EFO 0587. Among these microorganisms, the following are preferably used in the present invention: Rhizobium meliloti IFO 14782 (DSM No. 10226), Flavobacterium indologenes IFO 14944, Bacillus subtilis IFO 3007,<br><br>
Escherichia coli IFO 13168, Serratia marcescens IFO 12648, Corynebacterium ammoniagenes IFO 12612, Corynebacterium glutamicum EFO 12168, Pichia guilliermondii IFO 10106 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae IFO 0306.<br>
For preparation of the cell-free extract from the cells obtained by cultivation, general methods such as sonication and cell breakage in the presence of glass beads or by the French press homogenizer can be applied. If desired, treatment with a lytic enzyme such as lysozyme or zymolase at 15°C to 45°C, preferably at 20°C to 40°C for 1 to 3 hours can be also applied before the disruption in the above-mentioned way. For example, after centrifugation of the culture broth, the resulting cells are washed with saline and suspended in a buffer such as Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing sucrose, dithiothreitol (DTT) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) as general stabilizers of enzymes.   After cell breakage, the resulting solution is centrifuged to separate the cell debris, and its supernatant can be used as the cell-free extract.<br>
The enzyme reaction system contains the cell-free extract as prepared above or those partially purified by general methods for purification of enzymes such as ammonium sulfate precipitation or gel filtration chromatography. Alternatively, the resting cells or the growing cells of the microorganism can also be used. In addition to the cell-free extract, DTP and HT as substrates and also NADP*, NAD"*' and ATP as cofactors are added to the reaction system. The amount of DTP, HT, NADP"", NAD* and ATP to be added to the system can be varied depending on the reaction system employed. But, in general, the concentrations of DTP, HT, NADP*, NAD"1 and ATP in the enzyme reaction system are O.lmM or more, preferably from ImM to lOmM for DTP and HT, preferably from 0.05 mM to 5 mM, more preferably from 0.2 mM to 0.4 mM, for NADP"1 and NAD*, and preferably from 1 mM to 20 mM, more preferably from 3 mM to 7 mM, for ATP. The addition of manganese ions or magnesium ions to the enzyme reaction system stimulates the reaction, and the addition of both such ions produces even more preferable results. As salts giving rise to such ions, for example, the hydrochlorides, sulfates, nitrates or phosphates of manganese and magnesium can be employed. The amount of manganese ions and magnesium ions to be added can also be varied depending on the reaction system employed. But, in general, the concentrations of manganese ions and magnesium ions are in the case of manganese ions from 0.1 mM to 100 mM, preferably from 5 mM to 10 mM, and in the case of magnesium ions from 3 mM to 300 mM, preferably from 20 mM to 50 mM.<br><br>
For initiating the enzyme reaction, a buffer solution, which has no influence on vitamin B6 production from DTP and HT, can be used. Tris-HCI buffer is preferably used for this purpose. The enzyme reaction is suitably effected in a pH range from 6.0 to 8.5, more preferably in the range from 7.0 to 8.0, The reaction temperature is suitably from IS1C to 45'C, preferably from 20°C to 40°C. The mcubation period may be varied depending on the reaction conditions, but is generally from 30 minutes to 5 hours, more preferably from 2 hours to 4 hours.<br>
Vitamin B1 produced from DTP and HT under the conditions as described above can easily be recovered as follows. For example, after the reaction, proteins in the reaction mixture are precipitated by denaturation with heat, acid, alkali or organic solvent and removed by centrifugation. For this purpose a process generally used for extracting a certain product from the above supernatant may be employed which is 1plicable to the various properties of vitamin B(. Thus, for example, vitamin Ba in the supernatant is purified with an ion exchange resin. The desired product is further recrystallized from a mixture of alcohol and water.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention therefore provides a process for the production of vitamin Be from l-deoxy-D-threo-pentulose (DTP) and 4-hydroxy-L-threonine (HT), which process comprises contacting DTP and HT with an enzyme reaction system prepared from cells of a microorganism capable of producing vitamin Bsfrom DTP and HT, whereby said contacting occurs in the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP1), nicotinamide adenine dmucleotide (NAD1) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP).<br><br>
The present invention will be illustrated in more detail by the following Examples; however, it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to these particular Examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
)    Preparation of cell-free extract<br>
Rhizobium meliloti EFO 14782 (DSM No. 10226) was cultured in a seed medium containing 1% glucose, 0.5% polypeptone (Nippon Seiyaku Co., Japan), 0.2% yeast<br>
extract (Difco), 0.05% MgS04-7H20, 0.001% MnS04-5H20, and 0.001% FeS04-7H,0 at 28°C for 17 hours. The seed culture was transferred into a 500 ml flask containing 200 ml of a fermentation medium comprising 4% glucose, 2% polypeptone, 0.2% yeast extract,<br>
0.05.% MgS04-7H20, 0.05% MnS04-5H20,0.001% FeS04-7H20, and one drop of antifoam CA-115 (Nippon Yushi Co., Japan) and then the flask was shaken on a flask shaker at 28°C. After cultivation for 72 hours, cells were harvested from 400 ml of the culture broth by centrifugation at 10,400 x g for 10 minutes and washed twice with 0.85% NaCl solution and washed once with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 15%<br><br>
sucrose, 0.1 mM PMSF and 1 mM DTT and stored at -30°C until use for preparation of the cell-free extract.<br>
The following operation was all performed in ice water or at 4°C. The cells stored at -30°C were thawed and suspended in 5 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 15% sucrose, 0.1 mM PMSF and 1 mM DTT. The cell suspension was passed through a French press homogenizer (Ohtake Works Co,. Ltd.) at 200 kg/cm1. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 34,800 x g for 30 minutes to remove cell debris. Ten milliliters of the supernatant were dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of 80% ammonium sulfate solution containing 15% sucrose, 0.1 mM PMSF and 1 mM DTT, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 34,800 x g for 30 minutes. The precipitate was dissolved in 10 milliliters of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 15% sucrose and 0.1 mM PMSF, dialyzed overnight against the same buffer, the dialyzed solution was stored at -30°C until use for the enzyme reaction. The protein content in the cell-free extract was determined by the Lowry method [Lowry et al., J. Biol. Chem. 193, 265 (1951)]tobell.4mg/ml.<br>
Example 2<br>
Enzymatic production of vitamin B6 from DTP and HT<br>
The enzyme reaction was carried out by incubating tubes containing 500 |J.l of the reaction mixture listed in Table 1 at 28°C. A complete reaction system contained 2.5 mM DTP, 2.5 mM HT, 0.38 mM NADP1 0.38 mM NAD1 5 mM ATP, 193.25 11 of the cell-free extract and 80 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.50. After incubation for 2 hours, the reaction was stopped by heating in a boiling water bath for 3 minutes, centrifuged at 10,000 X g for 10 minutes and then the supernatant was treated with phosphatase by incubating a tube containing 15 |il of the supernatant, 10 1il of 1 mg/ml acid phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Germany) and 10 |xl of 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 5.0) at 37°C for 30 minutes. After incubation, 1,800 11 of water were added to the tube and deteiTnined by the microbiological method using Saccharomyces carlsbergensis ATCC 9080 as described bellow. The standard solutions of pyridoxol (0-2 |.ig per milliliter) were<br>
-2<br>
diluted 1.21 X 10   in distilled water. One hundred |il of the diluted standard solution or sample and 3 ml of the assay medium for vitamin Eg (Nissui Co., Japan) containing Saccharomyces carlsbergensis ATCC 9080 were added to tubes in this order and<br><br>
incubated with an angle of 30° at 28°C. After incubation for 17 hours, the cell growth was stopped by adding 5 ml of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid, and then the absorbance of the samples was measured at 660 nm. The amount of vitamin Be in a sample was determined by comparing the turbidity of the sample with the standard growth curve of Saccharomyces carsbergensis ATCC 9080. As a result, 97 ng of vitamin Bj/ml/mg protein/hour were produced in the complete reaction system. On the other hand, no vitamin B1 was produced in the reaction systems omitting one factor from the complete system. Furthermore, 119, 123 or 587 ng of vitamin BJvnMvng protein/hour were produced in the system supplemented by 8.4 mM MnCl2, 32 mM MgCU or both, respectively, to the complete system (Table 1). The results indicate that cell-free extract, NADP"1, NAD"1 and ATP are essential for the vitamin Eg production from DTP and HT, and that MnClz and MgCl2 stimulate the production.<br>
