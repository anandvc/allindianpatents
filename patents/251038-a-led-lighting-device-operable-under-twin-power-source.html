				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to energy saving lighting devices. The invention in<br>
particular relates to an LED (Light Emitting Diode) based energy saving solar<br>
lighting device, which is also adaptable to conventional power source. More<br>
particularly, the invention relates to a twin power source adaptable LED lighting<br>
device outputting controlled lumens. It can be used in homes, schools, streets<br>
and for industrial use both in rural and urban societies.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The existing lighting devices which are generally available in the market<br>
comprises incandescent lamp arrangements, fluorescent lighting arrangements<br>
and other high capacity sodium vapour, mercury vapour and metal halides.<br>
These are inefficient in energy consumption and in addition causes a cost burden<br>
to the consumer. For example, in a 100 watt incandescent lamp only about 15%<br>
of available electrical energy is converted to light energy and the rest 85% is<br>
converted into heat energy. Similarly, in the case of fluorescent lighting, about<br>
60% of the electrical energy is converted into light energy and the rest 40% is<br>
needed to keep the required temperature of the gas of the lamp.<br>
Further, the prior art lighting devices also includes solid state lighting<br>
arrangement with directional emission LEDs. However, the LED-based lighting<br>
devices have found extensive use in traffic lighting system, eventhough they are<br>
limitedly being used in decorative lighting too.<br><br><br>
Nikhil Ramesh Taskar, et al disclosed a light emitting device containing an array<br>
of directional emission LEDs. The directional emission LEDs in the form of array<br>
may be substrate emitting, lateral current injection, resonant cavity LEDs<br>
mounted in a flip-chip configuration. Each LED may emit a different color light,<br>
such that the output of the array appears white to an observer. The LED array<br>
cluster may contain micro optical elements, such as a defraction grating or<br>
microprisms, integrated into the light emitting surface of the package. The<br>
microoptical elements are used to mix the light beams by individual LEDs in the<br>
array.<br>
Barbara Harrison et al describes an improved decorative lighting device which<br>
uses a plurality of optical fibres formed of flexible,<br>
transparent/translucent/opaque/ monofilament nylon. The device is configured to<br>
have a central column containing atleast one light-source, a rigid member lying<br>
in a plane substantially perpendicular to the axis of said column, wherein said<br>
plurality of optical fibres extending from a point adjacent the top of said column<br>
about said rigid member to a point adjacent the bottom of said column.<br>
Such decorative device is generally used as a decorative light and not suitable for<br>
house-hold or industrial use. Further, these are costly and eliminates the<br>
application of LEDs.<br>
Irving Schaffer et al discloses an LED signal module having individual LED<br>
reflectors as opposed to a common single reflector. The module includes a<br>
casing defining a cavity. Within the cavity is an array of LEDs Individual reflectors<br>
are placed around individual Leds of the array. The individual reflectors are<br>
structured to receive direct light from their associated individual LEDs and<br><br><br>
substantially to prevent direct light from their associated individual LEDs from<br>
impinging upon the individual reflectors of other LEDs of the array of LEDs. A<br>
lens covering the cavity is disposed which lens is shaped to direct the output<br>
luminance of the LEDs below the horizontal axis of the module.<br>
Guy Dessureault et al disclosed traffic light electronic controller which stabilizes<br>
the total output light intensity of the traffic light in order to ensure a constant<br>
light intensity of each traffic light color. The controller detects the output light<br>
intensity of a first color, and then automatically adjust the power input for the<br>
LEDs in order to increase the light intensity when needed. The controller<br>
operates in a closed loop cycle in order to perform real-time control of the light<br>
intensity output. Thus, at each moment of the traffic light lifetime, the output<br>
light intensity is constant and equivalent to a predetermined standard. The<br>
intensity is further controlled by detecting ambient light condition.<br>
Tooshiji Kishimura et al, discloses a white LED lighting device having a light<br>
source for white LED lighting that enables an energy-saving, maintenance-free<br>
operation while ensuring ample illuminance. The device comprising a lamp body<br>
having a mounting base, a lamp casing, a colorless transparent globe fixed to the<br>
lamp casing, a light source for emitting white LED lighting, and a light source<br>
controller, a lamp support for supporting said lamp body, a power source device<br>
for supplying electric power to said light source for emitting white LED lighting.<br>
The light source for emitting white LED lighting comprising a reflective plate<br>
having holes, a plurality of white LED elements within said holes, a base plate<br>
attached to the positive and negative terminals of the LED-elements, and a<br>
series parallel electrical network connected to said positive and negative<br>
terminals of the LED elements.<br><br><br>
The introduction of LED in the lighting arrangement for commercial use however<br>
entails many practical problems. First of all, the LEDs are very sensitive to certain<br>
input power and it is not possible to handle more than 10% of maximum forward<br>
voltage. Besides, a very precise input power source is necessary for the LEDs<br>
which controls both voltage and current, thereby drive LED Luminaire efficiently.<br>
Further, the LEDs available in the market do not emit wide beam, which is<br>
generally required in light design for practical use.<br>
The prior art LED luminaires in the market are either directly connected to the<br>
battery or sometimes through a prehistoric current limiting device like a resistor<br>
which possess its own power loss and moreover there is no control over the<br>
current input.<br>
Further, the prior art Led lighting devices generally use a conventional power<br>
source with a battery back-up. However, the LED lighting devices adaptable to<br>
twin energy source for example, conventional and solar energy fail to provide the<br>
advantage of consistently uniform lumens output.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore, an object of the present invention to propose a twin power-source<br>
adaptable LED lighting device which eliminates the disadvantages of prior art.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a twin power-source<br>
adaptable LED lighting device which can be operated by both conventional<br>
energy and non-conventional energy.<br><br><br>
A still another object of the present invention is to propose a twin power-source<br>
adaptable LED lighting device which substantially reduces consumption of input<br>
energy and is economic to the customer because of very long life^of the LEEDS.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to propose a twin power-source<br>
adaptable LED lighting device which provides a wide range of power rating<br>
illumination outputs and can also be used for several consecutive days in cloudy<br>
weather when used in a solar system.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose a twin power-source<br>
adaptable LED lighting device which is compact and handy.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to propose a twin power-source<br>
adaptable LED lighting device which can be adapted in homes, schools, streets<br>
and for industrial use both in rural and urban societies.<br>
A still another object of the present invention is to propose a twin power-source<br>
adaptable LED lighting device which is eco-friendly.<br>
An yet further object of the present invention is to propose a twin power-source<br>
adaptable LED lighting device which can effectively contribute in promoting social<br>
causes for example, education for children and adults in areas without electricity<br>
including more efficient household work and home based industry.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The concept of utilization of solar energy for human benefit has been under<br>
research for the last few decades. Simultaneously development work is being<br><br>
conducted on different types of electrical lighting appliances to run on this solar<br>
energy input. On considering the above, an improved solar lighting arrangement<br>

visible lumens for the human eye.<br>
The new technology has been developed where the LEDs are arranged in a<br>
combination with the help of a state-of-the-art frequency controlled device which<br>
performs harmonious switching. The repetitive switching takes place within a<br>
periocTof a Traction of a second and is not .distinguishable to the human eye. The<br>
amount of lumens output from one set of LED can be controlled as per desired<br>
requirement of end user by varying the frequency.<br>
The energy saving light device comprises an unbreakable housing having a clear<br>
or frosted front of acrylic/toughened/glass/polycarbonate affixed to the housing<br>
with a frame. Inside the housing there is reflecting means around a central three<br>
dimensional LED matrix made of PCB (Printed circuit Board) on which desired<br>
number of LEDs are fixed up. The LEDs are connected to an Electronic Circuitory<br>
means which is molded in resin and housed in a separate enclosure mounted<br>
outside the housing the luminaire for easy accessibility.<br>
This electronic circuitory means consists of PCB, an assembly of ICs, resistors,<br>
capacitors, variable resistor and a multi-pin jack. A micro-controller architecture<br>
configured as a fast switching means formed on the electronic circuitory means.<br>
The micro-controller detects output light intensity of a matrix and automatically<br>
adjust the total output intensity to provide a consistently desired output of the<br>
device.<br><br>
The LED lighting device is capable of producing in the range of 50-1000 lumens<br>
illumination.<br>
The LED lighting Device is capable of producing in the range of 1.5 to 20w.<br>
The LED lighting Device is capable of generating and applicable in the frequency<br>
range of 1.5 - 5 mega Harz.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF<br>
THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
As shown in Figure 1 the lighting device comprises a housing (6) made of<br>
unbreakable materials having a frame (1) to hold a clear or frosted front cover<br>
(2)	of acrylic/toughened glass/polycarbonate. A multi-facated parabolic reflector<br>
(8) centrally disposed around a three dimensional operably matrix (5) to which a<br>
cluster of plurality LEDs (4) are connected through an electronic circuitory means<br>
(3)	which is attached to the housing (6). The housing is also provided with a<br>
power input socket (7).<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the electronic circuitory means (3) comprises an input<br>
power point (7). The input current passes through a diode (10) which acts as a<br><br>
polarity protection. A frequency control (11) preset determines the charge rate of<br>
a capacitor (13) and a resistor (12), enabling the resistor-capacitor network (12,<br>
13) to work in harmony to determine the mother frequency. To get train of<br>
pulses, a first chip (IC1) is very close to input (V.D.D.). Thus, a feed-in (14) is<br>
disposed between a pair of switching chips (IC2, IC3) to reduce the base<br>
saturation of a pair of switching chip (IC2 and IC3). Since the shape of the<br>
frequency thus generated has a base-line delay so the switching interval is fixed.<br>
This helps to protect the junction of LEDs even without a current limiting<br>
resistor. Output of the switching chips (IC2 and IC3) is sent to the LEDs (4).<br><br>
