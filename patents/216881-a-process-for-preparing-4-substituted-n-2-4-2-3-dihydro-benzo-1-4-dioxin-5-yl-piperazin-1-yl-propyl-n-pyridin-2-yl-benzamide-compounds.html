WO 97/03982 discloses compounds of the general formula (II):<br><br>
including enantiomers and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof.<br>
The compounds of formula (II) fall within the disclosure of U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,127,357 but are not specifically disclosed therein. Compounds of Formula II were<br>
taught to have potent 5-HT-1A antagonist activity in vivo when administered by the oral<br>
route.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Novel compounds of the invention have the structural formula (III):<br><br>
wherein R1 is cyano, nitro, trifluoromethyl or halogen, or pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
acid addition salts thereof.<br>
Halogen, as used herein, refers to chlorine, fluorine, bromine and iodine.<br>
The compounds of Formula III contain an asymmetric carbon atom.<br>
Accordingly, they may exist in different stereoispmeric forms or mixtures thereof<br>
including racemates. In some preferred embodiments the R stereoisomer (Formula<br>
IlIa) is preferred. <br>
In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, the (R) stereoisomer<br>
is in enantiorneric excess of the (S) stereoisomer. Preferably the compound is made<br>
up of a significantly greater proportion of its (R) stereoisomer than the (S)<br>
stereoisomer. In preferred embodiments the compound is made up of at least about<br>
90% by weight of its (R) stereoisomer and about 10% by weight or less of its (S)<br>
stereoisomer. In other embodiments of the invention, the compound is made up of at<br>
least about 99% by weight of its (R) stereoisomer and about 1% by weight or less of<br>
the (S) stereoisomer, e.g. substantially free from (S)-stereoisomer, most preferably<br>
substantially pure or pure (R) stereoisomer. Preferred stereoisomers may be isolated<br>
from racemic mixtures by any method known to those skilled in the art, including high<br>
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the formation and crystallization of<br>
chiral salts. See, for example, Jacques, et al., Enantiomers, Racemates and<br>
Resolutions (Wiley Interscience, New York, 1981); Wilen, S.H., et al., Tetrahedron<br>
33:2725 (1977); Eliel, E.L. Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds (McGraw-Hill, NY,<br>
1962); Wilen, S.H. Tables of Resolving Agents and Optical Resolutions p. 268 (E.L.<br>
Eliel, Ed., Univ. of Notre Dame Press, Notre Dame, IN 1972).<br>
The most preferred compounds of the invention are (R)-4-Cyano-N-{2-[4-(2,3-<br>
dihydro-benzo[1,4]dioxin-5-yl)-piperazin-1-yl]propyl}-N-pyridin-2-yl-benzamide; and<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts are the acid addition salts which can be<br>
formed from a compound of the above general formula and a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable acid such as, for example, benzoic, phosphoric, sulfuric, hydrochloric,<br>
hydrobromic, citric, maleic, malic, mandelic, mucic, nitric, fumaric, succinic, tartaric,<br>
acetic, lactic, pamoic, pantothenic, benzenesulfonic, or methanesulfonic acid. In<br>
some embodiments of the invention the preferred acid addition salt is hydrochloric<br>
acid.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by known methods<br>
from known starting materials which are available by conventional methods. For<br>
example the compounds may be prepared by the general methods disclosed in EP-A-<br>
0512755 and WO 97/03982. Accordingly this invention provides a process for<br>
preparing a compound of formula (III) which comprises one of the following:<br>
a) acyiating a compound of formula (IV):<br><br>
using an acyiating agent containing the moiety<br><br>
wherein R1 is as defined herein;<br>
or<br>
b) alkylating an amide or thioamide of formula (VI)<br><br>
(where R1 is defined above) with an alkylating agent (e.g halide or tosylate)<br>
providing the group of formula (VII)<br>
or <br>
c) alkylating a compound of formula (VIII<br><br>
with a compound of formula (IX)<br><br>
(where R1, is as defined above and X is a leaving group)<br>
or<br>
d) heteroarylating a compound of formula (X)<br><br>
(where R1 is as defined above) with a compound providing the 2-pyridyl group;<br>
or<br>
e) reacting a piperazine compound of formula<br><br>
(where R1 is as defined above) with a fluoro compound of formula<br><br>
or<br>
f) converting a basic compound of formula (III) as defined herein to a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof or vice versa;<br>
or<br>
g) resolving a racemic compound of formula (III) to give an enantiomeric excess<br>
of the R form over the S form, or vice versa.<br>
Such disclosed methods include acylating an amine of formula (IV) with a<br>
known benzoyl chloride (V) or an alternative acylating derivative thereof. Examples of<br>
acylating derivatives include the acid anhydride, imidazolides (e.g. obtained form<br>
carbonyldiimidazole), or activated esters.<br><br>
wherein R1 is cyano, halogen, trifluoromethyi or nitro.<br>
Novel compounds of the present invention are potent 5-HT-1A binding agents<br>
which selectively bind to the 5-HT-1A receptor. Furthermore, the novel compounds of<br>
the invention are 5-HT-1A receptor antagonists when tested by standard<br>
pharmacological procedures.<br>
In addition, the novel compounds of formula (III) are unique from previously<br>
disclosed 5-HT-1A receptor antagonists in that they possess a superior duration of<br>
action as a 5-HT-1A receptor antagonist when administered in vivo.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The present invention is illustrated by reference to the following example.<br>
Those skilled in the art of organic synthesis may be aware of still other synthetic<br>
routes to the invention compound. The reagents and intermediates used herein are<br>
either commercially available or prepared according to standard literature procedures.<br>

A solution of {(R)-2-[4-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[1,4]dioxin-5-yl)piperazin-1-yl]propyl}-pyridin-<br>
2-ylamine (0.846 g, 2.38 mmol) in dichloromethane (20 mL) was treated at 0°C with<br>
the dropwise addition of a dichloromethane solution of 4-cyanobenzoyl chloride (1.1<br>
equivalents, 2.63 mmol in 5 mL). After stirring for 16 hours the mixture was poured<br>
onto hexane (100 mL) to precipitate the titled compound as its mono- hydrochloride<br>
salt (white solid, 1.2 g, 97% yield), which was recrystallized from dichloromethane/-<br>
hexane.<br>

In order to demonstrate the superior duration of action of the compounds of<br>
formula (III), Example 1 was compared to representative compounds of U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,127,357 and WO 97/03892.<br>
Representative compounds of U.S. Patent No. 6,127,357 possess a cyclo-<br>
hexylamide moiety and a 2-methoxyphenylpiperazine grouping. The most potent<br>
example of this general structure (and the most potent compound taught in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,127,357) is compound A, described as "example 3" in U.S. 6,127,357.<br>
The only other class of compounds in U.S. 6,127,357 for which data are given is that<br>
which possess a cyclohexylamide moiety and a benzodioxinylpiperazine grouping<br>
("Example 17" in U.S. 6,127,357). A small subset of this class of compounds is<br>
specifically claimed in WO97/03892, with the preferred compound being compound B<br>
("example A1" in WO97/03892). Therefore, these two preferred examples from<br>
EP-A-0512755 and WO 97/03892 have been chosen as representatives for<br>
comparison to the compounds of formula (III).<br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
BINDING PROFILE<br>
Compounds were tested for binding to cloned human 5-HT-1A receptors stably<br>
transfected into CHO cells using [3H]8-OH-DPAT as the 5-HT-1A radioligand<br>
(according to general procedure described in J. Dunlop et al., J. Pharmacol. Tox.<br>
Methods, 40, 47-55 (1998)). As shown in Table 1, compounds of the present invention<br>
display high affinity for the 5HT1A receptor.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
IN VITRO FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY<br>
A clonal cell line stably transfected with the human 5-HT-1A receptor was<br>
utilized to determine the intrinsic activity of compounds (according to the general<br>
procedure described in J. Dunlop et al., J. Pharmacol. Tox. Methods, 40, 47-55<br>
(1998)). Data are provided in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, compounds of the<br>
present invention antagonized the ability of 10 nM 8-OH-DPAT to inhibit forskolin-<br>
stimulated cAMP production in a concentration-related fashion.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
IN VIVO FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY<br>
The ability of the compounds to function in vivo as 5-HT-1A antagonists was assessed<br>
in rats using a Fixed Responding Model (D. Blackman, in "Operant Conditioning: An<br>
Experimental Analysis of Behavior", J. Butcher, ed., Methuen and Co., Ltd., London).<br>
In this model rats are trained to respond (lever pressing) under a fixed-ratio 30<br>
schedule of food presentation in order to receive a food pellet reinforcer.<br>
Administration of the 5-HT-1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT reduces the control response rate<br>
(assessed by administration of vehicle placebo). The 5-HT-1A antagonist activity of a<br>
test compound is determined by measuring its ability to antagonize this agonist-<br>
induced decrease in response rate. A full antagonist effect is considered one in which<br>
the test compound completely reverses the agonist-induced response rate, returning it<br>
to control levels. The data given in Table 2 demonstrate that a 1 mg/kg dose of the<br>
compound of Example 1 completely reverses the decrease in response rate induced<br>
by administration of a 0.3 mg/kg dose of 8-OH-DPAT. Thus, compounds of the<br>
present invention function as 5-HT-1A antagonists in vivo.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
DURATION OF ACTION IN VIVO<br>
The duration of action in the Fixed Responding Model was assessed by pre-<br>
treating animals with test compound and then challenging with a 0.3 mg/kg dose of<br>
the 5-HT-1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT at various time intervals after the administration of<br>
test compound. All drug and vehicle administrations were made by the subcutaneous<br>
route. Doses of the test compounds selected for comparison were those which<br>
caused a ten-fold shift in the 8-OH-DPAT dose-response curve when administered 30<br>
minutes prior to agonist. The doses selected for the duration of action comparison<br>
are listed in Table 3.<br><br>
Data are presented for pre-treatment of the animals with test compound at 0.5<br>
hours, 2 hours, and 4 hours prior to administration of a 0.3 mg/kg dose of 8-OH-<br>
DPAT. Results are normalized to control values, with 100% being the control<br>
response rate observed when vehicle is administered rather than the agonist 8-OH-<br>
DPAT.<br><br>
As can be seen from Table 4, all three test compounds (Compound A, B and<br>
Example 1) completely antagonize the agonist-induced decrease in responding 30<br>
minutes after their administration, returning the response rate to control levels.<br>
However, when agonist is given 2 hours following test drug administration (Column 3),<br>
the 5-HT-1A antagonist effects of compounds A and B no longer return the response<br>
rate to control levels while Example 1 still displays complete 5-HT-1A antagonist<br>
effects. By four hours post-administration (Column 4), the 5-HT-1A antagonist effects<br>
of Compounds A and B are completely iost, while Example 1 continues to provide<br>
complete antagonism of the agonist-induced decrease in response rate. Thus, the<br>
duration of action of Example 1 is longer than 4 hours, while those of Compounds A<br>
and B are somewhere between 30 minutes and 2 hours.<br>
The increased duration of action of the novel compounds of the present<br>
invention, compared to that of the classes of compounds disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,127,357 and WO 97/03892 is particularly advantageous in that a smaller number of<br>
doses of the compound can be administered to produce a similar therapeutic effect.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be used to treat a subject suffering<br>
from CNS disorders such as schizophrenia, (and other psychotic disorders such as<br>
paranoia and mano-depressive illness), Parkinson"s disease and other motor<br>
disorders, anxiety (e.g. generalized anxiety disorders, panic attacks, and obsessive<br>
compulsive disorders), depression (such as by the potentiation of serotonin reuptake<br>
inhibitors and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), Tourette"s syndrome,<br>
migraine, autism, attention deficit disorders and hyperactivity disorders. Compounds<br>
of the present invention may also be useful for the treatment of sleep disorders, social<br>
phobias, pain, thermoregulatory disorders, endocrine disorders, urinary incontinence,<br>
vasospasm, stroke, eating disorders such as for example obesity, anorexia and<br>
bulimia, sexual dysfunction, and the treatment of alcohol, drug and nicotine<br>
withdrawal.<br>
Compounds of the present invention are also useful for the treatment of<br>
cognitive dysfunction. Thus, compounds of the present invention may be useful for<br>
the treatment of cognitive dysfunction associated with mild cognitive impairment<br>
(MCI)) Alzheimer"s disease and other dementias including Lewy Body, vascular, and<br>
post stroke dementias. Cognitive dysfunction associated with surgical procedures,<br>
traumatic brain injury or stroke may also be treated in accordance with the present<br>
invention. Further, compounds of the present invention may be useful for the<br>
treatment of diseases in which cognitive dysfunction is a co-morbidity such as, for<br>
example, Parkinson"s disease, autism and attention deficit disorders.<br>
"Provided", as used herein with respect to providing a compound or substance<br>
covered by this invention, means either directly administering such a compound or<br>
substance, or administering a prodrug, derivative, or analog which will form an effective<br>
amount of the compound or substance within the body. Prodrugs can be prepared<br>
such as described in Design of Prodrugs, Bundgaard, H. ed., (Elsevier, New York<br>
1985); Prodrugs as Novel Drug Delivery Systems, Higuchi, T and Stella, V. eds,<br>
(American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C. 1975); Design of Biopharmaceutical<br>

The compounds of the present invention may be administered orally or<br>
parentally, neat or in combination with conventional pharmaceutical carriers.<br>
Applicable solid carriers can include one or more substances which may also act as<br>
flavoring agents, lubricants, solubilizers, suspending agents, fillers, glidants,<br>
compression aids, binders, tablet-disintegrating agents or encapsulating materials. In<br>
powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in admixture with the finely<br>
divided active ingredient. In tablets, the active ingredient is mixed with a carrier<br>
having the necessary compression properties in suitable proportions and compacted<br>
in the shape and size desired. The powders and tablets may contain up to 99% of the<br>
active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers include, for example, calcium phosphate,<br>
magnesium stearate, taic, sugars, lactose, dextrin, starch, gelatin, cellulose, methyl<br>
cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidine, low melting waxes and<br>
ion exchange resins. Liquid carriers may be used in preparing solutions,<br>
suspensions, emulsions, syrups and elixirs. The active ingredient of this invention can<br>
be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier such as<br>
water, an organic solvent, a mixture of both or pharmaceutically acceptable oils or fat.<br>
The liquid carrier can contain other suitable pharmaceutical additives such as<br>
solubilizers, emulsifiers, buffers, preservatives, sweeteners, flavoring agents,<br>
suspending agents, thickening agents, colors, viscosity regulators, stabilizers or<br>
osmo-regulators. Suitable examples of liquid carriers for oral and parenteral<br>
administration include water (particularly containing additives as above, e.g., cellulose<br>
derivatives, preferably sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution), alcohols (including<br>
monohydric alcohols and polyhydric alcohols, e.g., glycols) and their derivatives, and<br>
oils (e.g., fractionated coconut oil and arachis oil). For parenteral administration the<br>
carrier can also be an oily ester such as ethyl oleate and isopropyi myristate. Sterile<br>
liquid carriers are used in sterile liquid form compositions for parenteral<br>
administration. Liquid pharmaceutical compositions which are sterile solutions or<br>
suspensions can be utilized by, for example, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or<br>
subcutaneous injection. Sterile solutions can also be administered intravenously.<br>
Oral administration may be either in liquid or solid composition form. Preferably, the<br>
pharmaceutical compositions containing the present compounds are in unit dosage<br>
form, e.g., as tablets or capsules. In such form, the composition is sub-divided in unit<br>
dosages containing appropriate quantities of the active ingredients. The unit dosage<br>
forms can be packaged compositions, for example, packaged powders, vials,<br>
ampoules, prefilled syringes or sachets containing liquids. Alternatively, the unit<br>
dosage form can be, for example, a capsule or tablet itself, or it can be the<br>
appropriate number of any such compositions in package form. The therapeutically<br>
effective dosage to be used may be varied or adjusted by the physician and generally<br>
ranges from 0.5 mg to 750 mg, according to the specific condition(s) being treated<br>
and the size, age and response pattern of the patient.<br>
The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without<br>
departing from the spirit and essential attributes thereof and accordingly, reference<br>
should be made to the appended claims, rather than to the foregoing specification, as<br>
indicating the scope of the invention.<br>
