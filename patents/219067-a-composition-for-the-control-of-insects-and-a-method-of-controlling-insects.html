				<td>A COMPOSITION FOR THE CONTROL OF INSECTS AND A METHOD<br>
OF CONTROLLING INSECTS<br>
This invention relates to a composition for the control of<br>
insects and a method of controlling insects. This application is<br>
divided out of Indian Patent Application No. 688/CAL/95.<br>
In particular the invention relates to the<br>
control of infestations by insects of animals or plants,<br>
and to the prophylaxis of infections of animals or plants<br>
which are transmitted by insects. The invention is also<br>
applicable to the amelioration of infections which are<br>
consequential upon infestation by insects.<br>
More particularly the invention relates to the<br>
use of compositions comprising peptidase inhibitors for the<br>
control of insects, and to the use of insect-resistant<br>
transgenic organisms which express peptidase inhibitors.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Insects cause significant pest problems in a wide<br>
variety of animals and plants worldwide, with estimates of<br>
13% of crop production lost each year despite current<br>
control measures. Insect species of the orders<br>
Lepidoptera, Hemiptera, Orthoptera, Coleoptera, Psocoptera,<br>
Isoptera, Thysanoptera and Homoptera cause massive losses<br>
to many horticultural and broadacre crops and stored and<br>
manufactured grain products. Diptera, Anaplura, Malophaga<br>
and Siphonaptera cause parasitic infections in animals and<br>
man. Other orders (Hymenoptera, Dictyoptera, Isoptera)<br>
include important domestic and industrial pests.<br>
Many of the known control measures for insects<br>
depend on the use of chemical insecticides, for example<br>
chlorinated hydrocarbons (DDT, endosulfan etc),<br>
organophosphates (chlorpyrifos, diazinon, malathion,<br>
parathion), organocarbamates (carbaryl, methomyl, proxypur)<br>
and synthetic pyrethroids (cypermethrin, deltamethrin).<br>
Problems associated with the use of chemical<br>
insecticides include the development of resistance by<br>
target insects (organophosphates, synthetic pyrethroids),<br>
the persistence of the chemicals in the environment and in<br>
plant and animal tissues, and the harmful effects on<br>
non-target organisms (organochlorines, insect growth<br>
regulators).<br>
Boron compounds (borax, polybor) have also been<br>
used for insecticidal purposes. Boron compounds are<br>
stable, kill insects relatively slowly at practical doses<br>
(Mullens and Rodriguez, 1992), and ingestion of large doses<br>
by humans can be lethal (Anon, 1991)<br>
Other categories of insecticide include insect<br>
growth regulators (IGRs) and insecticidal bacterial toxins<br>
(eg. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins). IGRs are<br>
compounds that interfere in some way with chitin synthesis.<br>
They include juvenile hormone analogues (methoprene),<br>
chitin synthesis inhibitors (fenoxycarb, diflubenzuron,<br>
flurazuron) and tria2ine derivatives (cyroma2ine).<br>
Resistance has been noted to many classes of IGR.<br>
Resistance is also developing in certain lepidoterans to Bt<br>
toxins. It is technically difficult with both IGRs and Bt<br>
toxins to ensure adequate insect kill at an appropriate<br>
stage in its life cycle. Some IGRs are stable and may pose<br>
environmental hazards.<br>
The most useful groups of insecticides are those<br>
having high insecticidal activity and low environmental<br>
persistence (organophosphates, synthetic pyrethroids). The<br>
greatest problem associated with these, however, is the<br>
development of resistance by target insects. It is<br>
believed that 90% of insecticide use is still based on<br>
classical neurotoxic insecticides. The search for<br>
alternative low-residual insecticides which are effective<br>
on insects resistant to existing insecticides is thus<br>
particularly urgent.<br>
Agents referred to as synergists may be used to<br>
maximise effectiveness of particular insecticides.<br>
Synergists may or may not be insecticidal in their own<br>
right. Blood and Studdert (1988) define a synergist as an<br>
agent that acts with or enhances the action of another. as<br>
an example, it may be noted that piperonyl butoxide is a<br>
synergist for synthetic pyrethroids. Synergists which are<br>
effective in combination with a particular insecticide may<br>
not be effective in combination with other insecticides.<br>
Synergists can be used to overcome problems of insect<br>
resistance, although insect resistance to synergists can<br>
also occur. The role of synergists in insecticidal<br>
formulations can be vital for achieving a commercially<br>
viable result, and for insecticide resistance management.<br>
The search for effective synergising combinations is as<br>
urgent as the search for effective insecticides per se<br>
(Forrester et al, 1993).<br>
Recently attention has focused on insect<br>
peptidases, inhibition of which may provide a possible<br>
means of insect control. Peptidases are ubiquitous enzymes<br>
which break down proteins and peptides, and thus assist<br>
with digestion both in the gut and in cells. They are<br>
involved in tissue reorganisation during embryo<br>
development, moulting and pupation in insects. They are<br>
also involved with defence against invading organisms and<br>
with protein regulation.<br>
Peptidases are a widely variable group of<br>
enzymes. Currently they are classified according to:<br>
(1) the reaction catalysed<br>
(2) the chemical nature of the catalytic site,<br>
and<br>
(3) the evolutionary relationship as revealed by<br>
structure (Barrett, 1994)<br>
The International Union of Biochemistry and<br>
Molecular Biology (IUBMC), In:Enzyme Nomenclature (1992),<br>
classifies peptidases by enzyme class (EC) categories.<br>
These categories are EC 3.4.11 to 3.4.19 for exopeptidases<br>
(those enzymes that only act near the ends of peptide<br>
chains) and EC 3.4.21 to 3.4.99 for enzymes that<br>
preferentially act on the inner regions of peptides. Group<br>
EC 3.4.99 is a group of peptidases for which the catalytic<br>
mechanism is unrecognised or uncharacterised.<br>
An overview of the peptidase classes and their<br>
relationship to insect biochemistry is outlined below.<br>
1. Serine Peptidases<br>
This group includes serine-type carboxypeptidases<br>
EC 3.4.16, and serine endopeptidases EC 3.4.21.<br>
Serine peptidases are typically recognised by a<br>
catalytically active serine amino acid at their active<br>
site, and by their sensitivity to an enzyme inhibitor,<br>
3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (3,4-DCI). The preferred pH range<br>
for activity of mammalian serine peptidases is 2-8; however<br>
insect serine peptidases are commonly adapted to alkaline<br>
conditions (pH 9 to over 11 in some lepidopteran larvae).<br>
The activity of serine peptidases in insects is<br>
also commonly defined by reaction of the enzymes with<br>
synthetic substrates. The three common categories of<br>
insect serine peptidases (trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like<br>
and elastin-like) can be identified in this way.<br>
Trypsin-like serine peptidases react with synthetic<br>
substrates P-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (TAME),<br>
a-N-benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester (BAEE),<br>
a-N-benzoyl-DL-arginine-p-nitroanilide (BAPNA) and<br>
benzoyl-DL-arginine naphthylamine (BANA) .<br>
Chymotrypsin-like peptidases may be identified by<br>
their reaction with:<br>
N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine ester (APNE)<br>
N-acetyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester (ATEE)<br>
N-benzoyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester (BTEE)<br>
N-benzoyl-L-tyrosine-p-nitroanilide (BTPNA)<br>
L-glutaryl-L-phenylalanine-p-nitroanilide (GPPNA)<br>
N-succinyl-L-phenyalanine-p-nitroanilide (SPAPNA)<br>
L-glutaryl-L-phenylalanine naphthylanide (GPNA).<br>
Elastase-like serine peptidase inhibitors may be<br>
identified by their reaction with synthetic substrates such<br>
as N-succinyl-ala-ala-pro-leu p-nitroanilide (SAAPLpNA)<br>
The activity of serine peptidases may also be<br>
described in terms of their reaction with enzyme<br>
inhibitors. Serine-group peptidases are generally<br>
inhibited by Di-isopropyl-fluro-phosphate (DipF/DFP), and<br>
paraphenyl methyl sulphonyl fluoride (PMSF). Trypsin-like<br>
peptidases are inhibited by tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl<br>
ketone (TLCK). Chromotrypsin-like peptidases are inhibited<br>
by tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK).<br>
Elastase-like peptidases are inhibited by Eglin-C.<br>
A number of naturally occurring proteins have<br>
been found to be able to inhibit serine peptidases. These<br>
include the crystalline soybean trypsin inhibitor of Kunitz<br>
(SBTI) and the soybean trypsin inhibitor of Bowman-Birk<br>
(BBTI). Various other legume seeds contain peptidase<br>
inhibitor at 1-4% of total protein, for example chickpea<br>
trypsin/chymotrypsin inhibitor (CI), Lima bean trypsin<br>
inhibitor (LBTI) and cowpea trypsin inhibitor (CPTI)<br>
(Macintosh et al, 1990). Animal-derived serine peptidase<br>
inhibitors include bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor<br>
(BPTI, Aprotinin), egg-derived ovomucoid and<br>
alpha-1-antitrypsin from blood.<br>
Serine peptidases having alkaline pH optima are<br>
recognised to be of primary importance as soluble enzymes<br>
in the digestive fluids of insects. Examples include<br>
sphingidae (Miller et al, 1974), noctuidae (Ahmed et al,<br>
1976, 1980? Ishaaya et al, 1971; Prichet et al, 1981;<br>
Teo et al, 1990; Broadway and Duffy, 1986), bombycidae<br>
(Sasaki and Suzuki, 1982; Euguchi and Iwanito, 1976;<br>
Euguchi and Kuriyama, 1985), pieridae (Lecadet and<br>
Dedonder, 1966; Broadway et al, 1989) pyralidae (Larocque<br>
and Houseman, 1990; Houseman et al, 1989; Mohammed and<br>
Altias, 1987) and diptera (Bowles et al, 1990).<br>
Christeller et al (1992) showed that serine peptidases were<br>
implicated in the (casein) digestive activity of twelve<br>
phytophagous lepidopterans. In this article Christeller<br>
found that no other type of peptidase showed significant<br>
evidence of digestive activity. serine peptidases have<br>
also been found to exhibit a dominant role in<br>
keratin-digesting lepidopterans (Christeller et al, 1994;<br>
Prowning and Irzykiewicz 1962; Ward, 1975 a, b).<br>
Furthermore, they have an important role in the digestive<br>
activity of some coleopterans (McGhie et al, 1995,<br>
Dymock et al, 1992), some orthopterans (Sakal et al, 1989;<br>
Christeller et al, 1990), some heteropterans (Cohen, 1993)<br>
and in some dipterans (Bowles et al, 1990).<br>
The digestive serine peptidases vary considerably<br>
both in number and in catalytic properties within and<br>
between species (Applebaum, 1985). In some instances<br>
inhibitors of serine peptidases in insect diets have been<br>
recognised to cause feeding deterrence as well as digestive<br>
inhibition (Dymock et al, 1992).<br>
Trypsin-like serine peptidases have been<br>
recognised to be involved in the key growth regulatory area<br>
of moulting. They exhibit several roles including process<br>
control, exposure of chitin fibrils to chitinase enzymes<br>
and in recycling of cuticular material (Samuels and<br>
Paterson, 1991).<br>
Because of their dominant metabolic roles, their<br>
common natural occurrence, and the occurrence of many<br>
natural inhibitors in plants and animals, serine peptidases<br>
have received the most attention as agents for insect<br>
control. It is important to note that the context for use<br>
of serine peptidases in insect control has almost entirely<br>
been in the area of transgenic plants.<br>
2. Cysteine (Thiol) Peptidases<br>
This group includes cysteine-type<br>
carboxypeptidases (EC 3.4.18) and cysteine endopeptidases<br>
(EC 3.4.22).<br>
These enzymes are characterised by possession of<br>
a catalytically active cysteine residue at their active<br>
site and by their sensitivity to certain inhibitors.<br>
Cysteine peptidases are characteristically activated under<br>
reducing conditions (added cysteine, dithiothreitol or<br>
other reducing agents). Cysteine peptidases are soluble<br>
enzymes generally found in midgut contents of insects.<br>
Mammalian cysteine peptidases commonly function in low pH<br>
conditions, although in insects, near neutral or mildly<br>
acidic pH values are favoured (Wolfson and Murdock, 1987).<br>
The activity of cysteine peptidases is<br>
exemplified by their reaction with synthetic substrates<br>
n-cc-benzoyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide (BAPNA) or benzoyloxy<br>
carbonyl-phe-arg-7-(4 methyl) coumaryl amide<br>
(Z-Phe-Arg-MCA). The activity of cysteine peptidases may<br>
also be described in terms of their reaction with enzyme<br>
inhibitors such as iodoacetamide, iodoacetate, heavy<br>
metals, p-chloromercuribenzoate, cystine cyanide, N-ethyl<br>
maleisdde and characteristically, E-64. E-64 is a small<br>
peptide (L-trans-epoxy-succinyl-leucylamido-(4-guanidino-<br>
butane) obtained from a strain of Aspergillus japonicus.<br>
Naturally occurring cysteine peptidase inhibitors have been<br>
identified in microbes (E-64), plants (oryzacystatins I and<br>
II from rice grains and potato multicystatin (PMC) from<br>
potato tubers), and animals (hen-egg cystatin, HEC).<br>
Antipain is another well-known cysteine peptidase<br>
inhibitor.<br>
Cysteine peptidases play a major role as soluble<br>
digestive enzymes of the gut of some insects, notably<br>
coleopterans (Orr et al, 1994; Thie and Houseman, 1990;<br>
Liang et al, 1991). The use of cysteine peptidase<br>
inhibitors for the control of insects has been largely<br>
explored in the context of transgenic plants (Orr et al,<br>
1994; Wolfson and Murdock, 1987).<br>
3. Aspartic Peptidases (EC 3.4.23)<br>
These enzymes are typically recognised as<br>
possessing two aspartyl residues at the active site. Many<br>
aspartic peptidases are most active at low-pH values.<br>
Synthetic substrates for these enzymes include<br>
N-carbobenzoxy glutamyl-L-tyrosine and N-acetyl-L-phenanyl<br>
diiodotyrosine. Characteristic inhibitors for aspartic<br>
peptidases include pepstatin and diphenyl diazomethane<br>
(McDonald, 1985). Pepstatin is a naturally occurring<br>
inhibitor from a microbial source.<br>
Applebaum (1985) has suggested some significance<br>
of aspartic peptidases to dipterans. Wolfson and Murdock<br>
(1987) have demonstrated some growth inhibition of a<br>
coleopteran (Colorado potato beetle larvae) by pepstatin;<br>
however, greater inhibition of growth was obtained by<br>
targeting cysteine peptidases.<br>
An extensive search of the literature on<br>
peptidases has shown that only a limited amount of research<br>
has been conducted on insect aspartyl peptidases for insect<br>
control, either by transgenic modification of plants or by<br>
topical application. Christeller et al (1992) found that<br>
aspartic peptidase activity is apparently not evident in<br>
phytophagous lepidopteran gut material.<br>
4. Metallopeptidases<br>
These enzymes are typically recognised as<br>
possessing a catalytically active metal ion (commonly zinc)<br>
at the active site, and by their sensitivity to chelating<br>
agents. The metallopeptidase category includes some<br>
endopeptidases (enzymes that cleave within the peptide<br>
chain) and exopeptidases (enzymes that cleave amino acid(s)<br>
from the termini of peptides). Exopeptidases can further<br>
be categorised as carboxypeptidases (which cleave amino<br>
acid(s) from the C terminus) or aminopeptidases (which<br>
cleave amino acids from the N terminus).<br>
Metallo endopeptidases (EC 3.4.22)<br>
These enzymes have not been implicated in insect<br>
biochemistry except for a possible role in wool digestion<br>
by keratinophagous lepidopterans (prowning and Irykiewicz,<br>
1962; Ward, 1975 a and b; Christeller et al, 1990, 1994).<br>
Hetallo carboxypeptidases (EC 3.4.17)<br>
Metallo carboxypeptidases require a bivalent<br>
cation (usually Zn2+) for activity. They exist in both<br>
free and membrane-bound forms and favour activity at high<br>
(8-10) pH. Synthetic substrates for carboxypeptidases<br>
include hippuryl-DL-phenyl-lactic acid and<br>
hippuryl-L-arginine, for carboxypeptidase type A and B,<br>
respectively. Carboxypeptidase A-like enzymes appear to be<br>
more common in insects, and have been found in<br>
orthopterans, coleopterans, dipterans and lepidopterans.<br>
Synthetic inhibitors for metallo<br>
carboxypeptidases include 1,10-phenanthroline, ethylene<br>
diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), (3-hydroxyguinoline and<br>
phosphoramidon. A naturally occurring inhibitor for<br>
metallo carboxypeptidase is potato-derived carboxypeptidase<br>
inhibitor (PCPI).<br>
Carboxypeptidase enzymes in both free and<br>
membrane-bound forms have been recognised in mid-gut<br>
material from lepidopteran larvae (Ferreira et al, 1994;<br>
Christeller, 1990). Christeller et al (1992) described<br>
these enzymes as expected components of the protein<br>
digestion system. Prior to the priority date of this<br>
application these enzymes were not apparently recognised as<br>
targets for transgenic modification of plants, let alone as<br>
components of topical control agents.<br>
Aminopeptidases (EC 3.4.11 - 3.4.13)<br>
Aminopeptidases bydrolyse amino acids from the<br>
N-terminus of peptide chains, and are generally classified<br>
according to their dependence on metal ions (Zn2+ or Mg2+) .<br>
The best studied aminopeptidases are found in the digestive<br>
tracts of mammals in both membrane bound and soluble forms.<br>
Aminopeptidases are commonly named with a suffix letter<br>
designating their pH optima, acidic (A) basic (B) or<br>
neutral (N), or by their membrane bound (M) state or by the<br>
number and type of amino acids cleaved from peptide<br>
substrates. These names are not exclusive; thus a leucine<br>
aminopeptidase M or N is an enzyme that preferentially but<br>
not exclusively removes leucine from a peptide, is membrane<br>
bound and whose activity is optimal at neutral pH.<br>
Aminopeptidases show preferential hydrolysis of leucyl,<br>
arginyl, methionyl, aspartyl, alanyl, glutamyl, prolyl,<br>
valyl and cysteinyl residues; however, substrate<br>
specificity is usually broad, and also depends on the other<br>
residues in the peptide chain (Taylor, 1993 a and b). Most<br>
aminopeptidases are metallopeptidases, although a few<br>
bacterial enzymes are known not to require metal ions for<br>
activity (Taylor, 1993 a and b). There are apparently no<br>
natural inhibitors of aminopeptidase.<br>
Insect aminopeptidases usually have alkaline pH<br>
optima and are generally inhibited by bestatin (Taylor,<br>
1993) and phenanthroline (Barrett, 1994).<br>
Substrate specificities are broad, as stated<br>
above, but typical substrates include leu-pNA, arg-pNA,<br>
met-pNA and pro-pNA.<br>
Metallo aminopeptidases are inhibited by<br>
chelating agents (such as EDTA), which can either remove<br>
the metal ion from the peptidase or form an inactive<br>
complex with the enzyme (Terra &amp; Ferriera, 1994). The<br>
action of a particular chelator will vary with the type of<br>
aminopeptidase as well as with the chelator"s own<br>
structure.<br>
Aminopeptidases have been also recognised as part<br>
of the insect complement of digestive peptides, and are<br>
thought to be involved in the terminal stages of protein<br>
digestion (Terra &amp; Ferriera, 1994). Christeller et al<br>
(1990, 1992) has asserted that exopeptidases (including<br>
aminopeptidases) will be of little use for insect control<br>
because of the minor role of these enzymes in the digestion<br>
of dietary protein relative to serine and cysteine<br>
peptidases.<br>
Insect larval growth retardation following<br>
exposure to specific leucine aminopeptidase (LAP)<br>
inhibitors has not been reported. Christeller et al (1990)<br>
have shown with crude field cricket gut extracts that<br>
although exopeptidase levels, particularly LAP, are<br>
significant in this insect, exopeptidases contributed only<br>
16-20% of protein digestion. In Christeller"s study, it<br>
was further found that in the presence of two effective<br>
serine peptidase inhibitors, the contribution of<br>
exopeptidases to protein digestion was greatly reduced.<br>
This was attributed to lack of oligopeptide chain ends to<br>
act as substrates for exopeptidases. This further<br>
indicated a minor role for aminopeptidases in insect<br>
control.<br>
The above findings teach strongly away from the<br>
use of exopeptidase inhibitors (principally aminopeptidase<br>
inhibitors) as insect control agents, and teach<br>
particularly strongly away from the combined use of serine<br>
peptidase inhibitors and aminopeptidase inhibitors as<br>
insect control agents.<br>
Apart from a digestive role, aminopeptidase<br>
activity has been demonstrated in the moulting fluid of the<br>
lepidopteran Manduca sexta (Jungries, 1979). However,<br>
again the role of aminopeptidases appears to be secondary<br>
to the role of serine (trypsin-like) peptidases. No<br>
naturally occurring inhibitors of aminopeptidases or<br>
metallopeptidases important in insect development have been<br>
reported as effective in retardation of moulting. None<br>
have been used to provide insect-resistant transgenic<br>
plants.<br>
Theoretically there appears to be a high<br>
potential for using peptidase inhibitors to control insects<br>
which are resistant to chemical insecticides. Firstly, the<br>
mechanism of action of peptidase inhibition is different<br>
from the mechanism of action of organophosphates and<br>
synthetic pyrethroids. Secondly, the amino acid sequence<br>
of the active sites of peptidase enzymes appears to be<br>
highly conserved (Taylor, 1993), thus indicating a low<br>
potential for mutation without consequent loss of activity.<br>
Finally, in the event that insect resistance to a<br>
particular peptidase inhibitor occurs, this resistance<br>
should not carry over to other peptidase mediated metabolic<br>
events.<br>
However, there are significant problems<br>
associated with the use of peptidase inhibitors for the<br>
control of insects. High use rates may be required,<br>
leading to a product which is not cost-effective.<br>
Furthermore, whilst the peptidase inhibitor may limit<br>
larval growth, it is possible that a plateau is reached in<br>
the dose-response curve, even at elevated use rates.<br>
Peptide-based or protein-based peptidase inhibitors, while<br>
presumably non-residual in the environment, may be<br>
difficult to store over extended periods, and may lose<br>
efficacy when delivered in hard water. Subtle issues<br>
involving the source of a particular enzyme inhibitor may<br>
need to be addressed. For example, anomalous responses<br>
involving growth inhibition of Costelytra zealandica by<br>
soybean, potato and cowpea trypsin inhibitor and growth<br>
stimulation by lima bean trypsin inhibitor have been noted<br>
(Dymock et al, 1992).<br>
Considerable research has centred on biochemical<br>
investigations of insect protein metabolism, principally<br>
digestive metabolism, using insect tissues, gut extracts,<br>
semi-purified or purified enzymes in vitro.<br>
Much of this work has been directed toward the<br>
selection of enzyme inhibitors for the transgenic<br>
modification of plants by investigating the relationship of<br>
digestive enzymes with protein or peptide based inhibitors<br>
(Applebaum, 1985; Christeller et al, 1989, 1990, 1992; Lenz<br>
et al, 1991; Teo et al, 1990; Pritchett et al, 1981, Santos<br>
and Terra, 1984; Dow, 1986; Sakal et al, 1984, 1989).<br>
Relatively fewer studies demonstrate a direct<br>
adverse influence of peptidase inhibitors on insect growth<br>
and/or reproduction. Serine and cysteine peptidase<br>
inhibitors have been shown to reduce the larval growth<br>
and/or survival of various insects, including<br>
Callosobruchus maculatus, Leptinotarsa decemlineata,<br>
Heliothie spp, Spodoptera exiqxxa, Costelytra zealandica,<br>
Teleogryllus commodus, Diabrotica sp, Manduca sexta, red<br>
flour beetle and bean weevil (Gatehouse and Boulter, 1983;<br>
Shukle and Murdock, 1983; Shade et al, 1986; Wolfson and<br>
Murdock, 1987; Broadway and Duffey, 1986; Hilder et al,<br>
1987; Dymock et al. 1992; Orr et al, 1994; Burgess et al,<br>
1994; Hines et al, 1990).<br>
Generally insect growth inhibition has been<br>
achieved with inhibitors of principal digestive enzymes of<br>
the gut, and a method for selection of appropriate<br>
insecticidal inhibitors based on these enzymes has been<br>
described by Christeller et al (1992).<br>
None of the above studies appears to be directly<br>
aimed at the production of topical insect control agents<br>
through interference with protein metabolism. In<br>
International Patent Application No. W094/16565 by Czapla,<br>
however, a minor claim cites the topical use of aprotinin<br>
or another serine peptidase inhibitor with 90% bomology to<br>
aprotinin for control of the European corn borer (ECB) and<br>
Southern corn rootworm (SCR). It was claimed that<br>
aprotinin could be used alone or in combination with an<br>
insecticidal lectin. Czapla found that incorporation of<br>
aprotinin at 20 mg/ml of diet killed 100% of neonatal ECB<br>
larvae in a laboratory assay, and killed 60% of neonatal<br>
SCR. Ingestion rates as high as these would be difficult<br>
to achieve by topical application, and treatment costs<br>
would be unlikely to be competitive with chemical<br>
insecticides. Czapla found that the serine peptidase<br>
inhibitor SBTI (Kunitz and Bowman-Birk) and the cysteine<br>
peptidase inhibitor cystatin were less effective than<br>
aprotinin.<br>
Direct feeding of SBTI to blood sucking insects<br>
has been investigated by Deloach and Spates (1980). They<br>
found raised mortality and suppressed egg hatch when SBTI<br>
was encapsulated in bovine erythrocytes and used as a bait<br>
for horn-fly. Various natural peptidase inhibitors<br>
(principally of serine peptidases) are known in blood.<br>
However, they have limited efficacy in protecting the<br>
animal from insect attack (Sandeman et al, 1990).<br>
Wolfson and Murdock (1987) observed that whilst<br>
there is extensive documentation on the presence and<br>
distribution of peptidase inhibitors in plants, and these<br>
inhibitors are presumed to be targeted at insect digestive<br>
peptidases, there is little direct evidence to support<br>
their efficient action in inhibiting insect growth and<br>
development. These authors demonstrated that larval growth<br>
reduction in Colorado potato beetle could be obtained by<br>
feeding E-64 (a cysteine peptidase inhibitor) at threshold<br>
levels of 50mg/ml on potato leaves. However at a much<br>
higher application level (1000 mg/ml) a plateau in<br>
mortality of 74-85% was found, which is insufficient for<br>
practical use. SBTIs (Kunitz and Bowman-Birk) were<br>
ineffective as growth retardants, and there was only a<br>
small response to pepstatin.<br>
A research paper by Dymock et al (1992) has<br>
discussed the inhibition of growth of a larval coleopteran<br>
(New Zealand native grass grub) by peptidase inhibitors.<br>
The research was focussed on the genetic transformation of<br>
important pasture species, as the grubs feed on roots.<br>
Bioassays showed growth inhibition using serine peptidase<br>
inhibitors. Some anomalous responses to particular<br>
inhibitors were noted (inhibition by SBTI, POT I, POT II,<br>
CpTI, stimulation by LBTI). Christeller et al (1989) had<br>
previously identified trypsin. as the principal gut<br>
peptidase in the above grub, despite the fact that normally<br>
coleopteran gut peptidases are predominantly of the<br>
cysteine category. Generally the use rate of peptidase<br>
inhibitors required to achieve mortality was too high to be<br>
cost effective in topical use.<br>
Compositions that function by inhibition of<br>
metallopeptidases (including aminopeptidase or LAP) have<br>
not been commercially developed for the control of insects.<br>
In fact, the prior art teaches away from the use of<br>
peptide-based aminopeptidase inhibitors or metallopeptidase<br>
inhibitors for insect control, because:<br>
(a) effective inhibitors of the above category<br>
suitable for the genetic transformation of plants have not<br>
been identified,<br>
(b) the apparent role of these enzymes is minor<br>
relative to the dominant cysteine and/or serine peptidase<br>
activities in the gut of insects.<br>
Shenvi (1993) has discussed the use of a-amino<br>
boronic acid derivatives as effective inhibitors of<br>
mammalian aminopeptidases. Shenvi notes that certain<br>
intermediates in the synthesis of a-amino boronic acid<br>
derivatives have insecticidal properties; however these<br>
intermediates did not. have an amino group, and are not<br>
suggested to act either as aminopeptidase inhibitors or<br>
peptidase inhibitors of any sort.<br>
The hexadentate metal chelating agent EDTA has<br>
been recognised by Samuels and Paterson (1995) and Ferreira<br>
and Terra (1986) to be an inhibitor of an aminopeptidase<br>
derived from the moulting fluid and digestive membranes.<br>
There is no recognition of any insecticidal effect of EDTA;<br>
however general claims for the insecticidal action of metal<br>
chelating agents have been made by Tomalia and Wilson<br>
(1985, 1986). No supporting evidence was presented. The<br>
use of metal chelating agents for insect control would be<br>
expected to be adversely influenced by the use of hard<br>
water for spray application, or if there was mineral or<br>
soil contamination of the materials to be treated.<br>
We have now surprisingly found that compositions<br>
comprising an aminopeptidase inhibitor or metallopeptidase<br>
inhibitor and further comprising a non-strongly-cbelating<br>
peptidase inhibitor are able to prevent the hatching of<br>
insect eggs and/or the development of insect larvae. The<br>
person skilled in the art will recognise that the vast<br>
majority of aminopeptidase inhibitors are in fact<br>
non-strongly-ehelating, as this term is defined herein.<br>
It will be clearly understood that the invention<br>
is applicable to the control of insects via a variety of<br>
mechanisms. The methods of the invention pay, for example,<br>
result in the actual killing of insects, or in the<br>
interruption of insect growth and development so that<br>
maturation is slowed or prevented. Prevention of hatching<br>
of insect eggs is particularly desirable, since many<br>
economically important insects cause damage as a result of<br>
the feeding activities of their larvae.<br>
It will be also understood that because of the<br>
wide variation of individual biochemical capacities within<br>
members of the class Xnsecta, responses to particular<br>
inhibitors and/or combinations of inhibitors will vary<br>
between species. Thus it is possible that some<br>
compositions within the scope of this invention will be<br>
poorly effective or even ineffective against some insects,<br>
while being highly effective against others. Variations in<br>
responses may also be seen at subspecies level or at<br>
different stages in the life cycle for particular insects,<br>
or even with the diet of the insects. Those skilled in the<br>
art will be able to match relevant inhibitors to insect<br>
targets by application of normal trial and error laboratory<br>
and field experimentation.<br>
It will also be apparent to the person skilled in<br>
the art that the invention may be utilised in variety of<br>
ways, including but not limited to :<br>
(a) control of insect infestation by direct<br>
application to a plant or animal vulnerable to such<br>
infestation;<br>
(b) reduction of insect numbers by application<br>
of the agents of the invention to insect habitat or<br>
breeding sites;<br>
(c) control, either by way of prophylaxis or<br>
reduction in severity, of infections in plants or animals<br>
which are transmitted by insects; and<br>
(d) control, by way of prophylaxis or reduction<br>
in severity, of infections in plants or animals which are<br>
consequential upon insect infestation.<br>
For the purpose of this specification, the term<br>
"peptidase inhibitor" is to be understood to be any<br>
compound able to inhibit any peptidase.<br>
In practical terms a peptidase inhibitor can be<br>
identified by the following process.<br>
1. Select representative active peptidases,<br>
which may be purified or in compositions<br>
comprising the active enzyme.<br>
2. Select an enzyme activity assay for each of<br>
the representative peptidases by selecting<br>
an appropriates substrate for the enzyme and<br>
conditions for the reaction so as to yield<br>
an appropriate quantifiable endpoint in a<br>
convenient time.<br>
3. The test compound is considered to be a<br>
peptidase inhibitor if a reaction inhibition<br>
of 50% or greater is found in any of the<br>
above enzyme activity assays.<br>
Specifically/ a metallopeptidase inhibitor or an<br>
aminopeptidase inhibitor may be identified in this way.<br>
The term "non-strongly-chelating peptidase<br>
inhibitor" is to be understood to mean a peptidase<br>
inhibitor that cnelates Zn2+ ions less strongly than EDTA<br>
in a competitive binding assessment. Both EDTA and the<br>
inhibitor should be at the same concentration in the<br>
reaction mixture, which may conveniently be 0.1 mM.<br>
The parson skilled in the art will be able to choose<br>
appropriate reaction conditions and methods for determining<br>
Zn2+ distribution (eg. using multinuclear nuclear magnetic<br>
resonance (NMK), UV spectroscopy, voltametric techniques<br>
and soft ionization mass spectroscopy).<br>

intended to include analogues of these inhibitors,<br>
ie. inhibitors with similar structure and/or inhibitory<br>
characteristics (interactions with the target enzyme active<br>
site(s)) to the commonly recognised substance(s).<br>
Appropriate analogues may be portions of the<br>

The aminopeptidase inhibitor or metallopeptidase<br>

In a second aspect, the invention provides a<br>
method for controlling insects, comprising the step of<br>
exposing said insects to a composition according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Preferably the insects are controlled by<br>
inhibiting the hatching of insect eggs and/or inhibiting<br>
the development of insect larvae by exposing said insect<br>

Preferably the insect is a species of an order<br>
selected from the group consisting of Lepidoptera,<br>
Hemiptera, Orthoptera, Coleoptera, Psocoptera, Hymenoptera,<br>
Dictyoptera, Isoptera, Thysanoptera, Homoptera, Diptera,<br>
Anaplura, Halophaga and Siphonaptera. More preferably the<br>
insect is selected from the group consisting of myiasis<br>
flies, Budworms, fleas, field crickets, cockroaches, light<br>
brown apple moth and grain and flour storage insects.<br>
According to the method of the invention, the<br>
target insect may be exposed to the enzyme inhibitor by any<br>
suitable means. A person skilled in the art will<br>
appreciate that these means may vary widely, depending upon<br>
whether the inhibitor is to be applied to a plant or<br>
animal, and depending on the nature of the target insect<br>
and of the plant or animal. The means suitable for<br>
applying enzyme inhibitors directly to a plant or animal<br>
which is attacked by the insect may differ considerably<br>
from means suitable for applying the enzyme inhibitor to<br>
insect habitat or breeding sites.<br>
Suitable means of application of enzyme<br>
inhibitors to animals include but are not limited to direct<br>
topical application, such as by dipping or spraying, or<br>
internal application such as oral drenching, implants,<br>
delayed release bolus formulations or devices adapted for<br>
retention in the rumen and insect baits and tablets. Where<br>
the agents of the invention are to be applied to humans,<br>
formulations suitable for topical application include but<br>
are not limited to sprays, aerosols, creams and lotions,<br>
and formulations suitable for internal application include<br>
but are not limited to tablets, capsules or liquid<br>
formulations. In some situations parenteral administration<br>
by injection may be the most suitable means of treatment<br>
for humans or animals.<br>
Where the enzyme inhibitor is to be applied to<br>
plants, suitable means include but are not limited to<br>
sprays, dusts, pellets, or aerosols. The method of the<br>
invention also encompasses the concurrent or successive use<br>
of two or more metallopeptidase inhibitors, or the use of<br>
one or more metallopeptidase or aminopeptidase inhibitors<br>
in conjunction concurrently or successively with one or<br>
more inhibitors of other types of enzymes, one or more<br>
inhibitors of other insect physiological processes, or one<br>
or more other insecticidal agents whether these other<br>
inhibitors are delivered topically, internally or through<br>
transgenic modification.<br>
Some inhibitors useful for the purposes of the<br>
invention are peptide, polypeptide or protein in nature.<br>
Where this is the case, either or both of the<br>
aminopeptidase or metallopeptidase inhibitors and the<br>
non-strongly-chelating peptidase inhibitor may be suppled<br>
by transgenic expression in or in association with the<br>
target plant or non-human animal to be treated. Where only<br>
one of these inhibitors is expressed transgenically, the<br>
other may be supplied by topical application.<br>
The transgenic organism is preferably a plant or<br>
non-human animal vulnerable to attack by an insect, but may<br>
also be an organism which is resident in or on an animal or<br>
plant which is vulnerable to such attack. In the latter<br>
case, the organism is preferably symbiotic or commensal<br>
with the plant or animal. Suitable resident organisms<br>
include, but are not limited to Bacillus species or<br>
Pseudomonas species, or Mycobacterium species. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the organisms are Bacillus<br>
thuringriensis or Mycobacterium phlei. Methods for<br>
producing transgenic organisms are well known in the art,<br>
and plants which express Bacillus thuringiensis crystal<br>
protein show some resistance to insect attack.<br>
In preferred non-limiting embodiments of the<br>
invention :<br>
(a) The animals treated by the methods of the<br>
invention are selected from the group consisting of humans,<br>
sheep, cattle, horses, pigs, poultry, dogs and cats.<br>
(b) The plants treated by the methods of the<br>
invention are selected from the group consisting of cotton,<br>
oil seed crops, ornamental plants, flowers, fruit trees,<br>
cereal crops, vine crops, root crops, pasture plants and<br>
vegetables.<br>
(c) The insects to be controlled in the case of<br>
horticultural and broadacre applications of the invention<br>
are Lepidoptera, Hemiptera, Orthoptera, Coleoptera,<br>
Isoptera, Thysanoptera or Homoptera, ixx the case of insect<br>
infections in animals are Diptera, Anaplura, Malophaga or<br>
Siphonaptera, or in the case of domestic or industrial<br>
pests are Isoptera, Dictyoptera and Hymenoptera.<br>
(d) The transgenic plants are selected from the<br>
group consisting of cotton, oil seed crops, ornamental<br>
plants, flowers, fruit trees, cereal crops, vine crops,<br>
root crops, pasture plants, and vegetables, and<br>
(e) The transgenic organisms to be resident in<br>
or on an animal or plant are Bacillus sp or Pseudomonas sp<br>
or Mycobacteria sp.<br>
The transgenic plants or organisms may be<br>
prepared in accordance with techniques known to persons<br>
skilled in the art. For example, a non-human animal or<br>
plant or organism may be modified by the steps of:<br>
Preparing a suitable vector comprising a<br>
nucleotide sequence that codes for a peptide<br>
agent that inhibits an aminopeptidase or<br>
"non-strongly-chelating" peptidase and a<br>
promotor wherein the nucleotide sequence is<br>
capable of being expressed by a host<br>
containing the vector.<br>
Incorporating the vector into the host; and<br>
Maintaining the host containing the vector<br>
under conditions suitable for transcription<br>
and translation of the nucleotide sequence<br>
into said peptide agent.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention will now be described in detail by-way<br>
of reference only to the following non-limiting<br>
examples.<br>
The following examples demonstrate insect growth<br>
inhibition or insecticidal activities obtained by use of<br>
the invention, it will be understood however that other<br>
methods and applications can also be employed. Effects of<br>
inhibitors of serine and cysteine peptidases alone (not<br>
within the field of this invention) are included to<br>
illustrate variability in responses to inhibitors between<br>
species, or to exemplify additive or synergistic benefits<br>
subsequently obtained through use of the invention.<br>
Example 1 Influence of Individual Inhibitors on Growth<br>
and Survival of Larvae of sheep Blowfly<br>
(Lucilia cuprina; Diptera)<br>
Method<br>
Larvae were hatched from eggs that had been<br>
surface sterilised with 0.5% sodium hypochlorite and<br>
incubated overnight at 27°C The first instar larvae were<br>
collected and placed onto 1 ml of an autoclaved culture<br>
medium with or without added inhibitor(s), as designated.<br>
The culture medium consisted of 2% agar, 10% casein,<br>
2% yeast and 0.5% glucose in distilled water in a sterile<br>
vial or bottle. Five to fifty larvae, depending on the<br>
intended duration of the culture, were placed in each<br>
bottle, which was then capped using a lid with a fine<br>
plastic mesh insert. This cap allowed free exchange of air<br>
into the bottle.<br>
The bottles were then placed inside a large<br>
sterile container which was sealed to prevent contact with<br>
the environment. The container included inlet and outlet<br>
tubes connected to a source of sterile warmed humidified<br>
air and a vacuum pump, respectively. The apparatus,<br>
including culture bottles, was kept at 35°C for 24 to<br>
72 hours. This allowed growth of the larvae to required<br>
development stages.<br>
Cultures were set up in a sterile air flow hood<br>
and incubated in a sterile environment to minimise<br>
likelihood of contamination by bacteria that may assist or<br>
hinder larval growth thereby invalidating results. After<br>
the intended culture period, the bottles were removed and<br>
the larvae killed by freezing. They were then dried and<br>
weighed, either collectively or individually.<br>
The weight of insect larvae in control cultures<br>
(larvae grown concurrently, under the same environmental<br>
conditions and food - except without inhibitors) were then<br>
compared to those which included inhibitors and the percent<br>
inhibition (1) calculated according to the formulat<br>
where<br>
a = the weight of larvae in the presence of the<br>
inhibitor and<br>
c = the weight of control larvae.<br>
A large number of inhibitors has been tested in<br>
this culture system, and a selection of these is listed in<br>
Table 1.1. The effects of inhibitors on first instar<br>
larval growth and survival are shoyn in Table 1.2<br>
* unless otherwise stated/ enzyme inhibitors are soluble<br>
in sterile phosphate buffered saline or water. Those<br>
which are only soluble in DMSO/H20 or MeOH/H20 were<br>
compared to control treatments which included the same<br>
amounts of DMSO or MeOH.<br>
Table 1.2<br>
The effects of various inhibitors on first ixistar<br>
larval growth and survival.<br>
Our results indicated that inhibitors which<br>
affect trypain-like enzymes are effective in slowing larval<br>
growth., or in the case of TLCK, killing the larvae at the<br>
highest concentrations tested. E64, a cysteine peptidase<br>
inhibitor, was ineffective; however, the effects of calpain<br>
inhibitor on growth and the intermediate inhibition by<br>
leupeptin and APMS (not cysteine specific inhibitors)<br>
suggest that there may be some essential role for cysteine<br>
peptidases.<br>
The ineffectiveness of inhibition of aspartyl<br>
peptidase(s) by pepstatin is consistent with prior<br>
literature.<br>
The surprising result of this experiment was the<br>
dominant influence of some aminopeptidase inhibitors on<br>
larval growth. These results indicated that inhibition of<br>
larval aminopeptidase(s) was effective. L-leucinethiol,<br>
EDTA, 1,10-phenanthroline, bestatin, amastatin, leuhistin,<br>
and actinouin were effective growth inhibitors, inhibitors<br>
of dipeptidylamino peptidase (Diprotin A) and methionine<br>
aminopeptidase (Ebalactone) were ineffective.<br>
Example 2 Influence of combined peptidase inhibitors<br>
on growth and survival of larvae of sheep<br>
blowfly (L. cuprina; Diptera)<br>
(a) Use of combined serine and serine:aminopeptidase<br>
inhibitor combinations.<br>
The data from tests outlined in Example 1<br>
suggested that combinations of inhibitors which affected<br>
trypsin-like and/or aminopeptidase enzymes might have<br>
additive or Bynergistic effects. Further experiments were<br>
carried out to examine this possibility using methods<br>
previously described. The results are shown in Table 2.1.<br>
Table 2.1<br>
Inhibitor combinations and their effects on first<br>
instar larval growth and survival in vitro<br>
Little effect was apparent from combining SBTI<br>
and leupeptin or Pefabloc. A moderate effect was obtained<br>
with SBTI and EDTA. Greater inhibition occurred when SBTI<br>
was tested with TLCK or L-leucinethiol. The results<br>
suggested that multiple inhibition of trypsin-like<br>
peptidases and aminopeptidases has a useful inhibitory<br>
effect on the larvae.<br>
(b) Investigation of the effect of combining a serine<br>
peptidase inhibitor (SBTI) with an aminopeptidase<br>
inhibitor (L-leucinethiol) on growth inhibition<br>
of larval L. cuprina<br>
The effect on larval growth of combined SBTI and<br>
L-leucinethiol inhibitors was investigated over a range of<br>
concentrations to investigate the possibility of a<br>
synergistic inhibition occurring. This experiment was<br>
terminated prior to significant mortality. The results are<br>
shown in Table 2.2.<br>

(L. cuprina; Diptera) and Meliothic<br>
punctigens<br>
The following experiments were conducted to<br>
assess whether the compositions of invention could fulfil<br>
an insecticidal role through an inhibition of egg hatching.<br>
L. cuprina eggs were placed on pieces of liver<br>
(0.9 g) which were then placed in individual wells of a<br>
24-vwell tissue culture plate. Phosphate buffered saline<br>
(PBS, 0.1 ml) containing inhibitors at set concentrations<br>
were added to each well with 30 freshly laid and sterilised<br>
eggs of L. cuprina. The culture plate was then maintained<br>
in a sterile environment at 35°c for 24 hours, after which<br>
time the percentage hatch was assessed.<br>
Heliothis eggs were cultured on a defined medium<br>
(casein 3 g, wheatgerm 3 g, sucrose 5 g, agar 2.25 g,<br>
multivitamin B tablets 5 mg, dissolved in 80 ml PBS with<br>
penicillin and streptomycin) in 24-well tissue culture<br>
plates (2 eggs/well). Egg hatch was assessed after 3 days<br>
incubation at 27°C. The results are shown in Table 3.1<br>

An artificial diet was prepared as follows :<br>
Haricot Beans 468 gram (g)<br>
Wheat Germ 100 g<br>
Yeast 70 g<br>
Ascorbic Acid 70 g<br>
Paraben 44 g<br>
Sorbic Acid 2.2 g<br>
Agar 28 g<br>
H20 800 ml<br>
* Phosphoric and propionic 4 ml<br>
Acid<br>
* Stock solution of phosphoric and propionic acid contained<br>
29 ml Propionic Acid<br>
21 ml Orthophosphoric Acid<br>
s 270 ml dH20<br>
Total vol. 500 ml<br>
1. The Haricot beans were cooked in a microwave for<br>
40 minutes.<br>
2. Agar was added to the hot water and stirred on a<br>
hot plate until almost boiling.<br>
3. The haricot beans, agar mix, yeast and wheat germ<br>
was blended in an electric mixer for 3 minutes.<br>
4. When the temperature had dropped to 60°C, the<br>
acids were added and mixed with the media.<br>
5. Inhibitor solutions or an equal volume of water<br>
were placed into sterilized glass tubes at designated<br>
concentrations. The artificial media was added to each<br>
tube (1.5 ml) using a sterile 10 ml syringe. First instar<br>
Heliothis punctigsns larvae (1 larvae per tube) were added<br>
to the glass tubes and the tubes were capped. The tubes<br>
were incubated for 10 days at 25°C. The larvae were killed<br>
by placing the glass tubes at -70°C for 24 hours, and then<br>
individually weighed. Percentage inhibition was calculated<br>
by comparison to control larvae.<br>
The results are shown in Table 4.1<br>

Example 5 Influence of Peptidase Inhibitors on Growth<br>
and Survival of Cat Fleas (Ctenocephalides<br>
felis; Siphonaptera)<br>
Blood was collected from the jugular vein of a<br>
five year old merino sheep that had not been treated with<br>
an ectoparasitic agent for 18 months. The blood was<br>
collected into a 100 ml plastic bottle containing 0.8 ml of<br>
heparin and was maintained at 4°C. Inhibitors were pre-<br>
weighed into sterile 5 ml plastic vials and 4.5 ml of blood<br>
added. The samples were mixed, placed at -70°C for<br>
24 hours, then freeze-dried. The freeze-dried samples were<br>
sieved through a stainless steel 63 micron sieve, and<br>
placed into sterile 5 ml plastic vials (0.15 g/per tube).<br>
Four flea eggs were placed into each vial, and a sheet of<br>
tissue paper fastened by an elastic band was fitted to the<br>
top of each vial. The vials were incubated at 25°C and<br>
70-80% R H for 6 days. Vermiculite was then added to each<br>
vial to provide a supporting medium for the fleas to pupate<br>
and the tubes incubated at 25°C and 70-80% R H, for a<br>
further 10 days. Ten control vials and three vials of each<br>
treatment were tested.<br>
At the conclusion of the incubation period the<br>
vials were placed at -20°C for 24 hours to kill the fleas.<br>
The number of eggs hatched and the life-cycle stage was<br>
recorded. The results are shown in Table 5.1.<br>

(i) Stock solutions of inhibitors and control<br>
solutions were prepared as aqueous solutions or<br>
suspensions as outlined in Table 6.1.<br>
(ii) Mortality was assessed by commencing the study<br>
with 1st instar nymphs.<br>
(iii) Cabbage leaf disks (5 x 8 mm diameter<br>
disks/treatment) were smeared with 100 m1 of<br>
inhibitor or control stock solutions and allowed<br>
to dry. Disks were placed singly in 40mm petri<br>
dishes, together with a moist cotton wool pad as<br>
water supply and a piece of fluted plastic for<br>
shelter.<br>
(iv) Ten nymphs were placed on each disc and the dishes<br>
incubated at 25°C.<br>
(v) Mortality was assessed daily and any dead<br>
individuals removed.<br>
The results are shown in Table 6.1<br>

Example 7 influence of Peptidase Inhibitors on Growth<br>
and Survival of Sheep Lice (Bovicola ovis;<br>
Anoplura)<br>
Sheep lice are a major agricultural insect pest<br>
in Australia and many other countries. Some strains of the<br>
insects are developing high levels of resistance to<br>
organophosphates and synthetic pyrethroids. This trial was<br>
conducted to:<br>
(i) broaden the assessment of growth inhibition<br>
or insecticidal activity of the inhibitors<br>
useful in the inveniton; and<br>
(ii) to assess the growth inhibition or<br>
insecticidal activity of the invention on a<br>
strain of insect with a known high level of<br>
insecticide resistance.<br>
The strain of lice chosen was a reference strain<br>
known as Hartley. It is highly resistant to synthetic<br>
pyrethroids {Table 7.1, Levot G.W., Aust. Vet. J., 1992 69<br>
120).<br>
(i) Lice were collected by clipping a small area<br>
of wool from a heavily infected sheep and<br>
covering the shorn area for 1 minute with<br>
cotton cloth. Lice were brushed from the<br>
cloth into a container.<br>
(ii) Aqueous stock solutions or suspensions of<br>
inhibitors were applied to tufts of wool<br>
taken from the 40 mm of fleece closest to<br>
the skin. The donor sheep was known not to<br>
have been treated with insecticide for 2<br>
years, and its wool had a staple length of<br>
100mm at shearing.<br>
(iii) Taking care to avoid cross contamination,<br>
(quadruplicate wool samples were treated by<br>
immersion in aqueous solutions or<br>
suspensions of inhibitors, drained and air<br>
dried for 24 h.<br>
(v) The wool samples were added to labelled,<br>
capped plastic tubes.<br>
(v) Lice were allowed to crawl across paper away<br>
from a light source (as a viability test)<br>
and 10 lice from each of adult, 3rd, 2nd<br>
and 1st instar added to each tube of wool.<br>
(vi) Tubes were incubated at 35oc and 60 - 80% RH<br>
and inspected daily.<br>
(vii) viability assessments were made by assuming<br>
lice unable to move when touched were dead.<br>
The results are shown in Table 7.1<br>
Example 8 Influence of Peptidaae Inhibitors on Growth<br>
and Survival of the Bracnid (Tribolium<br>
castaneum; Coleoptera)<br>
Insects were cultured in cleaned, ground and<br>
sieved wholemeal flour made from organic wheat. Inhibitors<br>
from bottles of pre-weighed material were dry-mixed with<br>
the flour and residual inhibitor rinsed from bottles with a<br>
small volume of water. Rinse water waa added to the flour<br>
and the mixture re-ground. The impregnated flour was<br>
transferred to a 20 mL vial and mixed thoroughly by shaking<br>
and inverting.<br>
Adults of T. castaneum were allowed to oviposit<br>
on flour, eggs were sifted from the flour and transferred<br>
one by one with a single hair to microwell tubes containing<br>
a small amount, of flour. Each level of treatment was<br>
Performed in triplicate using 32 wells/replicate.<br>
Assays were performed in triplicate. Cultures were<br>
incubatded, at 30°C and 55% R H.<br>
After 6 days each replicate of 32 wells was<br>
combined, the larvae counted and the numbers compared with<br>
numbers in the control (no inhibitor) treatment. Larvae<br>
were classified as "small" if appreciably smaller than<br>
reference larvae, or abnormal if unusual behaviour or<br>
formation were observed (eg. twisting or twisted larvae).<br>
Test inhibitors and dose rates were the same as<br>
those used in Example 4.<br>
Results<br>
(Day 6) - Egg hatch was not consistently affected at day 5<br>
- larvae were classed as "small" at all dose<br>
levels of actinonin and EDTA, but were normal in<br>
1,10-phenanthroline and other treatments<br>
Example 9 Influence of Peptidase Inhibitors on Growth<br>
and Survival of the Grain Storage Pest<br>
Oryzaevphylus surinamensis; Coleoptera)<br>
The bioassay for this insect was as outlined for<br>
T. castaneum, except incubations were conducted at 32.5°C<br>
and 70% R H. After 8 days the insects were sieved from the<br>
flour and weighed.<br>
These results are shown in Table 9.1.<br>
Table 9.1<br>
Percentage Reduction in Weight of O. surinamensis Larvae<br>
Relative to growth in untreated larvae.<br>
The response to individual aminopeptidase<br>
inhibitors was variable. 1,10-phenanthroline was a highly<br>
effective growth inhibitor, EDTA was moderately effective<br>
and bestatin was ineffective.<br>
It will be apparent to the person skilled in the<br>
