PHASE-CHANGE RECORDING MATERIAL AND INFORMATION RECORDING<br>
MEDIUM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a phase-change<br>
recording material and an information recording medium<br>
employing it.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As a recording method utilizing the phase change, a<br>
method has been known wherein the crystal structure of a<br>
metal or a semiconductor is reversibly changed by<br>
affecting energy beams or an energy flow such as light or<br>
electric current (Joule heat) (Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 18<br>
(1971), pp. 254-257, U.S. Patent 3,530,441).<br>
Used practically at present as a means for recording<br>
on an information recording medium employing a phase-<br>
change recording material, is a means to utilize a<br>
reversible change between the crystalline phase and the<br>
amorphous phase. Specifically, it is a means to let the<br>
crystalline state in a non-recorded/erased state and to<br>
form amorphous marks at the time of recording. Usually,<br>
a recording layer is locally heated to a temperature<br>
higher than the melting point and then rapidly cooled to<br>
form amorphous marks. On the other hand, the recording<br>
layer is heated at a temperature of approximately at most<br>
the melting point and at least the crystallization<br>
temperature, and slowly cooled so that the recording<br>
layer is kept at a temperature of at least the<br>
crystallization temperature for a certain retention time<br>
to carry out recrystallization. Namely, in general, a<br>
reversible change between the stable crystalline phase<br>
and the amorphous phase is utilized, and the information<br>
is recorded or retrieved by detecting the difference in<br>
physical parameters such as refractive index, electric<br>
resistance, volume and change in density, between the<br>
crystalline state and the amorphous state.<br>
On the optical information recording medium among<br>
information recording mediums, recording/retrieving is<br>
carried out by utilizing a change in the reflectivity<br>
accompanying the reversible change between the<br>
crystalline state and the amorphous state caused locally<br>
by irradiation with a focused light beam. Such an<br>
optical information recording medium having a phase-<br>
change recording layer is being developed and used<br>
practically as a low cost large capacity recording medium<br>
excellent in portability, weather resistance, impact<br>
resistance, etc. For example, a rewritable phase-change<br>
type optical information recording medium (hereinafter "a<br>
rewritable phase-change type optical information<br>
recording medium" may sometimes be referred to as phase-<br>
change type optical disk, optical disk or disk) such as<br>
CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW and DVD-RAM is widely used.<br>
Further, it has been developed to achieve a high density<br>
by the use of blue laser or by an increase in NA of an<br>
objective lens, or to make high speed recording possible<br>
by improvement of the recording pulse waveform.<br>
As a material for such a phase-change recording<br>
layer, a chalcogenide alloy is used in many cases. As<br>
such a chalcogenide alloy, a Ge-Sb-Te type, In-Sb-Te<br>
type, Ge-Sn-Te type or Ag-In-Sb-Te type alloy may, for<br>
example, be mentioned. Such an alloy is usually an<br>
overwritable material also.<br>
Overwriting is a means wherein when recording is<br>
carried out again on a once-recorded optical information<br>
recording medium, writing is carried out without erasing<br>
before the recording, that is, a means of recording while<br>
erasing. On an optical information recording medium<br>
having a phase-change recording layer, recording is<br>
carried out usually by overwriting, and accordingly<br>
recording while erasing (i.e. overwriting) may sometimes<br>
be referred to simply as recording.<br>
It is possible to obtain an optical information<br>
recording medium on which high velocity recording at 10-<br>
times velocity is possible by increasing the<br>
crystallization speed, by employing for the recording<br>
layer a composition which comprises as a matrix a Sb70Te30<br>
alloy comprising a Sb70Te3o eutectic composition as the<br>
base and containing gb in large excess, among the above<br>
chalcogenide alloys. Particularly, preferred for the<br>
recording layer is a composition which comprises a<br>
Sb70Te3o eutectic composition containing Sb in large<br>
excess and contains Ge (JP-A-2001-229537 (paragraph<br>
0031)).<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In recent years, along with increase in the amount<br>
of information, it has been desired to develop an optical<br>
information recording medium on which recording, erasing<br>
and retrieving at a higher velocity are possible.<br>
Namely, it is necessary to employ for the recording layer<br>
a phase-change recording material capable of being<br>
crystallized at a higher speed. However, if the above<br>
phase-change recording material has a composition with<br>
which an adequately high crystallization speed is<br>
obtained, it tends to be difficult to satisfy both<br>
characteristics of excellent jitter characteristics<br>
(recording signal quality) and the storage stability of<br>
amorphous marks, from such a reason that noises of the<br>
signal of the optical information recording medium become<br>
significant. This problem is particularly remarkable<br>
with an optical information recording medium on which<br>
high velocity recording/erasing of information signals is<br>
carried out at a reference clock period of at most 15 ns.<br>
For example, when the above composition which<br>
comprises a Sb7oTe3o eutectic composition containing Sb in<br>
large excess and contains Ge is represented by<br>
(SbcTe1-c)1-dGed, it is possible to increase the<br>
crystallization speed by decreasing the ratio of the Te<br>
content relative to Sb by increasing the value c and<br>
bringing it to be close to 0.9. However, the noises of<br>
the optical information recording medium tend to be<br>
significant, and no favorable jitter characteristics will<br>
be obtained. Further, when the Ge content is reduced,<br>
although the noise increase tends to be suppressed, the<br>
storage stability of the amorphous marks will decrease.<br>
The present invention has been made to overcome the<br>
above problems, and its object is to provide a phase-<br>
change recording material on which high velocity<br>
recording/erasing is possible, which provides excellent<br>
recording signal characteristics such as the reflectivity<br>
and the signal amplitude or the jitter characteristics,<br>
and which provides a high storage stability of the<br>
recording signals, and an information recording medium<br>
employing the above material. Further, it is to provide<br>
a phase-change recording material with which the change<br>
of e.g. the reflectivity of the recorded signals is small<br>
even when the information recording medium is stored for<br>
a long time, and which provides excellent recording<br>
signal characteristics when the information recording<br>
medium on which signals are recorded is stored for a long<br>
time and then overwriting is carried out again, and an<br>
information recording medium employing the above<br>
material. Particularly, it is to provide an optical<br>
information recording medium which is one mode of the<br>
applications of the information recording medium.<br>
Under the above circumstances, the present inventors<br>
have conducted extensive studies and as a result, have<br>
found that when the Sb, In, Sn, Te and Ge compositions<br>
satisfy predetermined relational formulae, both recording<br>
signal quality such as the jitter characteristics and the<br>
stability of amorphous marks can be satisfied even if<br>
recording/erasing is carried out at a high velocity, and<br>
excellent recording signal characteristics can be<br>
maintained even when overwriting is carried out again<br>
after long term storage, and they have achieved the<br>
present invention.<br>

invention, by containing the composition represented by<br>
the formula (1) as the main component, is excellent in<br>
the recording signal characteristics even when<br>
recording/erasing is carried out at a high velocity,<br>
provides a high storage stability of the recording<br>
signals, provides a small decrease in the reflectivity of<br>
the recorded signals even after long term storage, and<br>
provides excellent recording signal characteristics even<br>
when overwriting is carried out again.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Now, the embodiments of the present invention will<br>
be explained in detail below. However, the present<br>
invention is by no means restricted to the following<br>
embodiments, and various modifications are possible<br>
within the a range of the gists.<br>
[1] Phase-change recording material<br>
[1-1] General explanation<br>
The phase-change recording material of the present<br>
invention is characterized by containing a composition<br>
represented by the following formula (1) as the main<br>
component:<br>
Gex(InwSn1-w)yTezSb1-x-y-z (1)<br>
(wherein the Sb content is higher than any one of the Ge<br>
content, the In content, the Sn content and the Te<br>
content, and x, y, z and w representing atomic ratios,<br>
predetermined composition as the main component" means<br>
that the content of the predetermined composition is at<br>
least 50 atomic% based on the entire materials or the<br>
entire layer in which the predetermined composition is<br>
contained. In order to effectively obtain the effect of<br>
the present invention, the composition represented by the<br>
above formula (1) is contained in an amount of preferably<br>
at least 80 atomic%, more preferably at least 90 atomic%,<br>
particularly preferably at least 95 atomic%, based on the<br>
entire phase-change recording material.<br>
In the present invention, in order to increase the<br>
crystallization speed so that high velocity<br>
recording/erasing is possible, a composition containing<br>
mainly Sb is employed for the above phase-change<br>
recording material. Accordingly, the Sb content is<br>
higher than any of the contents of the other atoms. The<br>
reason why Sb is mainly contained is that the amorphous<br>
phase of Sb can be crystallized at a very high speed,<br>
whereby it becomes possible to crystallize the amorphous<br>
marks in a short time. Namely, the amorphous state<br>
recording marks will be easily erased when Sb is mainly<br>
contained.<br>
Further, in the present invention, an additional<br>
element to facilitate formation of an amorphous phase and<br>
to increase the archival stability of the amorphous state<br>
is used together with Sb, rather than using Sb alone.<br>
Accordingly, Ge is employed together with Sb. Namely,<br>
when the Ge content is high, the amorphous phase<br>
formation tends to be easy, and the archival stability of<br>
the amorphous state tends to increase. Further,<br>
according to the studies by the present inventors, it was<br>
found that the recording signal characteristics when<br>
overwriting is carried out after the recorded medium is<br>
stored for a long time is also related to the Ge content.<br>
Further, in the present invention, of the phase-<br>
change recording material containing mainly Sb, the total<br>
amount of In and/or Sn and the total amount of Te are in<br>
a predetermined relation.<br>
Here, as the phase-change recording material<br>
containing Sb as the main body, the above-described<br>
composition comprising a Sb70Te30 eutectic composition and<br>
containing Sb in large excess, and further containing Ge<br>
in an amount of about 10 atomic%, has been known. It can<br>
be considered that the material of the present invention<br>
is a material having a large amount of In and/or Sn added<br>
to the above conventional composition (hereinafter<br>
sometimes referred to as a conventional SbTe eutectic<br>
type composition) so as to satisfy the predetermined<br>
relation. With the conventional SbTe eutectic type<br>
composition having In or Sn added thereto, deterioration<br>
of e.g. the jitter due to the crystal grain boundary<br>
noise tends to be somewhat suppressed, however, the<br>
reflectivity at the crystalline state tends to be low,<br>
whereby the difference in the reflectivity (signal<br>
amplitude) between the crystalline and amorphous states<br>
tends to be small. Particularly when the In content is<br>
high, such a phenomenon that the reflectivity at the<br>
crystalline state decreases with time is observed. This<br>
is considered to indicate a possibility that when the In<br>
content is high, the crystalline state which is<br>
originally supposed to be stable is formed into an<br>
unstable quasi-stable phase.<br>
Further, with respect to the conventional SbTe<br>
eutectic type composition containing In and Sn, along<br>
with increase in the number of repeated overwriting, the<br>
performance of formation of an amorphous state (easiness<br>
of formation of an amorphous state, storage stability of<br>
the formed amorphous state, etc.) and the crystallization<br>
speed tend to change (hereinafter sometimes referred to<br>
as the change in the phase-change performance). The<br>
reason is supposed that In or Sn and Te are in a repeated<br>
melted/cooled state in the process of the repeated<br>
overwriting, whereby an intermetallic compound<br>
(telluride) is formed to cause segregation, and the<br>
properties as an alloy change. This change in the phase-<br>
change performance is a more serious problem when<br>
recording by overwriting at a higher density and at a<br>
higher recording linear velocity is to be realized.<br>
Accordingly, it has been considered that In or Sb can be<br>
added in only a slight amount (at most about 10 atomic%)<br>
to the conventional SbTe eutectic type composition.<br>
Particularly, it has been considered that In or Sn can be<br>
added in an amount of at most about half the amount of<br>
Te. Practically, as disclosed in Examples of JP-A-10-<br>
326436 and JP-A-2002-79757, the addition amount of In or<br>
Sn in the conventional SbTe eutectic type composition is<br>
smaller than 10 atomic%. Further, the content of In or<br>
Sn is considerably lower than Te.<br>
As mentioned above, the purpose of addition of In,<br>
Sn or the like to the conventional SbTe eutectic type<br>
composition is to provide an additional improving effect<br>
to the SbTe eutectic type composition as the main<br>
component, and according to these circumstances, their<br>
addition has been studied with a small addition amount.<br>
Accordingly, the contents of In and Sn have been studied<br>
below a level where various adverse effects have been<br>
confirmed when their contents are close to the same as<br>
the Te content, and it has been considered that it is not<br>
necessary to positively incorporate In or Sn exceeding<br>
the Te content.<br>
However, according to the studies by the present<br>
inventors, it has been found that when the content of In<br>
and/or Sn is considerably increased relative to Te, the<br>
reflectivity at the crystalline state increases on the<br>
contrary, and the difference in the reflectivity between<br>
the crystalline and amorphous states (signal amplitude)<br>
increases again. Further, it has been found that when<br>
the content of In and/or Sn is considerably increased<br>
relative to Te, the archival change of the reflectivity<br>
is small. Still further, it has been found that in such<br>
a case, it is possible to satisfy both recording signal<br>
characteristics at a high velocity and stability of the<br>
amorphous state.<br>
Namely, when the Sb/Te ratio is increased<br>
(particularly the Sb/Te ratio exceeds 4) for the purpose<br>
of increasing the crystallization speed so as to realize<br>
high velocity overwriting, such a tendency that the<br>
crystal grain boundary noise becomes significant and the<br>
signal quality such as the jitter deteriorates, and a<br>
decrease in the archival stability of the amorphous state<br>
(the amorphous state is crystallized during a long term<br>
storage at room temperature), are observed. However,<br>
there is a prospect of resolution of all the above<br>
problems when the content of In and/or Sn is considerably<br>
increased relative to Te. For example, with respect to<br>
the stability of the amorphous state, it was found that<br>
the stability of the amorphous state is extremely high<br>
under usual storage conditions in the vicinity of room<br>
temperature.<br>
Further, the change in the phase-change performance<br>
occurred when the repeated overwriting is carried out is<br>
supposed to be due to the segregation of the Te compound<br>
occurred when the repeated overwriting is carried out.<br>
Accordingly, it is usually considered that addition of In<br>
or Sn in a large amount further deteriorates the above<br>
problem of the segregation of the Te compound. However,<br>
according to the studies by the present inventors,<br>
contrary to such a concept, it was found that when the<br>
content of In and/or Sn is considerably increased<br>
relative to Te, the change in the phase-change<br>
performance due to the repeated overwriting is<br>
suppressed.<br>
The phase-change recording material of the present<br>
invention wherein In, Sn, Sb, Te and further Ge satisfy<br>
the respective predetermined relations cannot be<br>
considered as one having a SbTe eutectic composition and<br>
having additional elements merely added thereto. This is<br>
because the phase state of the above phase-change<br>
recording material is expected to be very complicated,<br>
and the presence or absence of the above segregation due<br>
to the repeated overwriting is not clear also. However,<br>
stabilization of the crystallization speed (suppression<br>
of the change in the crystallization speed) when the<br>
repeated overwriting is carried out on the phase-change<br>
recording material of the present invention is thought to<br>
be achieved by either of the following two mechanisms.<br>
That is, the first mechanism is that in the phase-change<br>
recording material of the present invention, a relatively<br>
stable solid-solution state, even if it is quasi-stable,<br>
is formed within a specific composition range, and thus<br>
the segregation itself of the phase-change recording<br>
material is less likely to occur, and accordingly the<br>
change in the phase-change performance is suppressed.<br>
Further, the second mechanism is that even if the<br>
segregation occurs, the phase which undergoes the<br>
segregation is limited to a phase having a specific<br>
compositional ratio, and this phase having a specific<br>
compositional ratio does not have bad influences over the<br>
crystallization speed etc., and accordingly the change in<br>
the phase-change performance is suppressed.<br>
Accordingly, in the present invention, it is<br>
important to control the Te content and the In and/or Sn<br>
content in predetermined ranges.<br>
In the present invention, there is one more reason<br>
why it is important to control the Te content and the In<br>
and/or Sn content. That is, the elemental composition of<br>
the present invention may be considered as a material<br>
which comprises a GeSbSn type material or GeInSb type<br>
material containing mainly Sb and has Te added. In and<br>
Te are elements which facilitate the amorphous mark<br>
formation and reduce the fluctuation at the edge of the<br>
formed amorphous mark shape. Accordingly, by employing<br>
such elements, the jitter in the mark length recording<br>
when the present invention is applied to an optical<br>
information recording medium can be decreased. Further,<br>
Te increases the repeated recording durability. However,<br>
by addition of Te also, the reflectivity of the<br>
crystalline state tends to be low and the difference in<br>
the reflectivity between the crystalline and amorphous<br>
states (signal amplitude) tends to be small, and<br>
accordingly it is important to control the Te addition<br>
amount. According to the studies by the present<br>
inventors, it was found that by setting the relation<br>
between the Te content and the total amount of the In<br>
content and the Sn content to be within a predetermined<br>
range, decrease in the reflectivity of the crystalline<br>
state and the signal amplitude due to Te addition can be<br>
suppressed. Further, by setting the relation between the<br>
Te content and the total amount of the In content and the<br>
Sn content to be within a predetermined range, it becomes<br>
possible to satisfy both erasure of the amorphous marks<br>
(recording signals) by recrystallization in a short time<br>
in a case of high velocity recording and stability of the<br>
amorphous marks (recording signals) during storage.<br>
Further, by setting the relation between the Te content<br>
and the total amount of the In content and the Sn content<br>
to be within a predetermined range, it becomes possible<br>
to form amorphous marks with small noises (the jitter in<br>
the mark length recording when the present invention is<br>
applied to an optical information recording medium) due<br>
to the fluctuation in the mark shape.<br>
Further, when the In content is high, the<br>
reflectivity of the crystalline state of a phase-change<br>
type disk tends to decrease by a long term storage. This<br>
is considered to be because the quasi-stable crystalline<br>
state is formed, and the crystal structure subtlely<br>
changes. The amount of decrease in the reflectivity may<br>
exceed 10% of the reflectivity of the initial crystalline<br>
state in some cases. Such an archival change of the<br>
crystalline state is considered to cause changes in not<br>
only optical characteristics but also other physical<br>
characteristics such as electrical characteristics.<br>
Accordingly, the above archival change of the crystalline<br>
state is a cause of a decrease in the storage stability<br>
of the recorded information.<br>
However, according to the studies by the present<br>
inventors, it was found that even when the In content is<br>
high to a certain extent, by defining the relation of the<br>
In and Te contents, the decrease in the reflectivity due<br>
to a long term storage can be reduced.<br>
Namely, by adjusting the recording layer<br>
composition, an information recording medium excellent in<br>
recording signal characteristics at a high velocity and<br>
excellent in stability of the crystalline state and the<br>
amorphous state can be obtained. Accordingly, an<br>
information recording medium excellent in stability of<br>
the optical characteristics, the electrical<br>
characteristics etc. derived from the difference in the<br>
physical characteristics between both states and also<br>
excellent in recording signal characteristics when the<br>
recorded medium is stored for a long time and then<br>
overwriting is carried out, can be obtained.<br>
Further, in the present invention, it is preferred<br>
that of the phase-change recording material, the<br>
crystalline state corresponds to a non-recorded state,<br>
and the amorphous state corresponds to a recorded state.<br>
This is because it is supposed that not many crystal<br>
nuclei are present in the amorphous state of the phase-<br>
change recording material of the present invention. That<br>
is, in a case where the amorphous state corresponds to a<br>
non-recorded state and crystalline state marks are formed<br>
in this amorphous state, it is preferred to use a phase-<br>
change recording material in which many crystal nuclei<br>
are present. This is because when many crystal nuclei<br>
are present in the phase-change recording material, the<br>
shape of the crystalline state marks is less likely to be<br>
influenced by the position of the crystal nuclei. On the<br>
other hand, as described above, not many crystal nuclei<br>
are present in the phase-change recording material of the<br>
present invention, and accordingly favorable recording is<br>
likely to be carried out when the crystal state<br>
corresponds to a non-recorded state and amorphous state<br>
recording marks are formed in the crystalline state,<br>
rather than when the amorphous state corresponds to a<br>
non-recorded state and crystalline state recording marks<br>
are formed in the amorphous state.<br>
Now, the relation between the contents of the<br>
respective elements and the characteristics are explained<br>
in detail below.<br>
In the following explanation, the effect of addition<br>
of the respective elements (particularly In and Sn) is<br>
described mainly in view of the optical characteristics.<br>
However, the difference in the reflectivity between the<br>
crystalline state and the amorphous state observed as the<br>
optical characteristics, and the archival stability of<br>
the difference in the reflectivity, are considered to<br>
have influences over the difference in the<br>
characteristics between the crystalline state and the<br>
amorphous state and the stability (accordingly, the<br>
amplitude of the recording signals, the degree of the SN<br>
ratio and its stability) observed in view of e.g. the<br>
electrical characteristics also. Further, the noises due<br>
to the scattering at crystal grain boundaries which are<br>
understood as the optical characteristics, are considered<br>
to be observed electrically also as noises due to the<br>
scattering of electron at crystal grain boundaries.<br>
Accordingly, the following explanation in view of the<br>
optical characteristics can be considered to be similarly<br>
applicable to the electrical characteristics also.<br>
(Sb, Formula (vi))<br>
The Sb content is higher than any of the Ge content,<br>
the In content, the Sn content and the Te content.<br>
Namely, the recording material of the present invention<br>
contains mainly Sb. Sb itself is effective to<br>
crystallize the amorphous state in a short time, but its<br>
amorphous state formation ability is low, and the<br>
resulting amorphous state tends to be unstable, and<br>
accordingly it is necessary to use it together with an<br>
additional element as described hereinafter. The<br>
crystallization speed is high when the Sb content is<br>
high. Particularly in the high velocity recording for<br>
which crystallization in a short time is required, the Sb<br>
content is relatively increased. Specifically, the Sb<br>
content is at least 3 5 atomic% and is higher than the<br>
content of any other element contained. In order to<br>
adequately obtain the effect of the present invention,<br>
the Sb content is preferably at least 40 atomic%, more<br>
preferably at least 45 atomic%.<br>
Further, in the present invention, it is also<br>
important to control the Sb/Te ratio. With a view to<br>
carrying out the high velocity recording, the Sb/Te ratio<br>
is usually at least 2.3, preferably at least 3, more<br>
preferably at least 4. On the other hand, in view of the<br>
balance between the high velocity recording<br>
characteristics and the characteristics other than the<br>
high velocity recording characteristics, the Sb/Te ratio<br>
is usually at most 9.5, preferably at most 9.<br>
(Sn, Formulae (ii) and (v))<br>
The influence of the Sn content over the<br>
reflectivity of the crystalline state and the difference<br>
in the reflectivity between the crystalline and amorphous<br>
states (signal amplitude) and the influence of the In<br>
content over the reflectivity of the crystalline state<br>
and the difference in the reflectivity between the<br>
crystalline and amorphous states (signal amplitude) are<br>
substantially the same. Accordingly, to the phase-change<br>
recording material, one of Sn and In is contained.<br>
Further, the reflectivity of the crystalline state and<br>
the signal amplitude can be increased by making the total<br>
amount of the Sn content and the In content be larger<br>
than the Te amount within a certain range. On the other<br>
hand, when the Te content is high, the reflectivity of<br>
the crystalline state and the signal amplitude decrease.<br>
Accordingly, in order to obtain the desired reflectivity<br>
of the crystalline state and signal amplitude, it is<br>
important to control the relation between the Sn and/or<br>
In content and the Te content.<br>
Accordingly, the value (y-z) in the above formula<br>
(1) is at least 0.07, and preferably at least 0.1, more<br>
preferably at least 0.13, particularly preferably at<br>
least 0.15. When the value y is high, the optimum power<br>
will be low, such being favorable.<br>
Further, if the Sn amount is too large, the boundary<br>
shape of the amorphous mark tends to fluctuate<br>
particularly when the present invention is applied to an<br>
optical information recording medium, or the jitter<br>
characteristics which are considered to be due to the<br>
crystal grain boundaries tend to deteriorate.<br>
Accordingly, the value (l-w)xy in the above formula (1)<br>
is at most 0.35, and preferably at most 0.3.<br>
Accordingly, when Te is contained in a large amount, it<br>
is necessary to make the total amount of the In content<br>
and the Sn content large with a view to controlling the<br>
signal amplitude. However, the Sn amount cannot be so<br>
large taking the jitter characteristics into<br>
consideration. Accordingly, when the Te content is high,<br>
it is preferred to incorporate In in addition to Sn.<br>
Specifically, in a case where the Te content is so high<br>
that the decrease in the reflectivity of the crystalline<br>
state and the signal amplitude due to Te cannot be<br>
suppressed unless Sn is contained in an amount exceeding<br>
3 5 atomic%, In may be contained.<br>
(In, Formula (iii))<br>
By using In, the reflectivity of the crystalline<br>
state and the difference in the reflectivity between the<br>
crystalline and amorphous states (signal amplitude) can<br>
be increased, and accordingly in the present invention,<br>
it is preferred to use In as an element to be contained<br>
in the recording layer.<br>
By using In, the reflectivity of the crystalline<br>
state and the difference in the reflectivity between the<br>
crystalline and amorphous states (signal amplitude) can<br>
be increased, and in addition, there is such an advantage<br>
that the influence over the jitter characteristics can be<br>
reduced as compared with Sn. In is supposed to have a<br>
function to decrease the crystal grain boundary noise as<br>
compared with Sn and Te. On the other hand, In causes<br>
decrease in the reflectivity due to the long term storage<br>
which is supposed to be attributable to the quasi-stable<br>
crystalline state. On the contrary, Te tends to suppress<br>
the decrease in the reflectivity due to the long term<br>
storage. Accordingly, with a view to suppressing the<br>
decrease in the reflectivity of the optical information<br>
recording medium due to the long term storage, it is<br>
important that the In content and the Te content are in a<br>
predetermined relation. The present inventors have<br>
prepared and studied optical information recording<br>
mediums having various recording layer compositions and<br>
as a result, found that a decrease in the reflectivity<br>
due to the long term storage occurs when the In content<br>
is too high relative to the Te content. Namely, the<br>
decrease in the reflectivity due to the long term storage<br>
can be suppressed by making the value {(In content) - (Te<br>
content)} within a predetermined range in the above<br>
formula (1) . Specifically, when the value wxy-z in the<br>
above formula (1) is low, the rate of decrease in the<br>
reflectivity due to the long term storage tends to be<br>
low. Accordingly, the value wxy-z is preferably at most<br>
0.1, more preferably at most 0.05, furthermore preferably<br>
at most 0. Here, wxy-z=0 means that the In content and<br>
the Te content are the same. Accordingly, it is further<br>
preferred in the present invention that the In content is<br>
the same as the Te content or the In content is lower<br>
than the Te content.<br>
Accordingly, when the decrease in the reflectivity<br>
due to the long term storage is to be made as small as<br>
possible, In cannot be contained in an excessively large<br>
amount relative to Te, and accordingly in order to<br>
satisfy the above-described relational formula 0.07=y-z,<br>
it is preferred that the phase-change recording material<br>
of the present invention contains Sn in addition to In.<br>
Specifically, in a case where wxy-z
be satisfied unless Sn is contained in addition to In.<br>
Further, it is preferred that both In and Sn are<br>
contained from such a viewpoint also that the<br>
crystallization speed suitable for the high velocity<br>
recording is less likely to be obtained when the In and<br>
Te contents are high while Sn is not contained. Namely,<br>
it is preferred that 0<w></w>
If the In amount is excessively large, the signal<br>
quality during the long term storage of the information<br>
recording medium tends to deteriorate (for example, the<br>
reflectivity tends to decrease during the long term<br>
storage when the information recording medium is used as<br>
an optical information recording medium). Further, if<br>
the In amount is large while Sn is not contained, a<br>
stable crystal layer with a low reflectivity as observed<br>
in the In-Sb system may appear in some cases.<br>
Accordingly, the In content i.e. the value wxy is<br>
preferably at most 0.35.<br>
(Te, Formula (iv))<br>
The phase-change recording material of the present<br>
invention contains Te.<br>
The phase-change material of the present invention<br>
comprises a SbTe eutectic type containing Sb in large<br>
excess over Sb70Te30 as the base and provides its phase<br>
change performance, and thus Te is an essential element.<br>
Te bonded to Sb stabilizes the phase-change<br>
performance in the repeated recording and improves the<br>
repeated recording durability. Further, Te has an effect<br>
to maintain the erasing performance (to maintain the<br>
crystallization speed) and resultingly to improve the<br>
rebeated recording durability, after an information<br>
recording medium employing the phase-change recording<br>
material of the present invention is stored for a long<br>
time.<br>
In a case where Te is contained, if In, Sn or the<br>
like is added for the purpose of improving other<br>
characteristics, there is a possibility that In or Sn<br>
forms a compound with Te to cause segregation. However,<br>
in order to maintain basic phase-change performance, Te<br>
together with Sb is an essential element. Namely, even<br>
in a case where In or Sn is employed for the phase-change<br>
recording material of the present invention, Te cannot be<br>
excluded, and in order to further improve the<br>
characteristics with the SbTe binary composition, In or<br>
Sn has to be contained. Accordingly, one of the<br>
important significances of the present invention is that<br>
the In or Sn is contained in a predetermined range<br>
relative to Te so as to suppress the bad influence of the<br>
segregation to a negligible level.<br>
Accordingly, although the Te amount is preferably<br>
high to a certain extent, it is necessary to control the<br>
relation between In and/or Sn and Te and the relation<br>
between In and Te in predetermined ranges. Specifically,<br>
z indicating the Te content in the above formula (1) is<br>
0<z and it is preferably o.ol="z," more></z>
furthermore preferably 0.08=cz, particularly preferably<br>
0.l=z, most preferably 0.1<z.></z.>
z indicating the Te content is usually less than<br>
0.29, which is a value necessarily determined by other<br>
relational formulae defined for the above formula (1).<br>
As described above, it is preferred that the In and Te<br>
contents are high to a certain extent, however,<br>
particularly Te has a function to lower the<br>
crystallization speed, and accordingly in order to obtain<br>
the crystallization speed suitable for the high velocity<br>
recording, z indicating the Te content is preferably at<br>
most 0.25, more preferably at most 0.20.<br>
(Ge, Formula (i))<br>
In the present invention, Ge may be used so as to<br>
adjust the crystallization speed. Namely, Ge is not so<br>
largely related to the characteristics such as the<br>
reflectivity, the signal amplitude (the difference in the<br>
reflectivity between the crystalline and amorphous<br>
states) and the decrease in the reflectivity due to the<br>
long term storage of the medium. Accordingly, Ge may be<br>
used so as to obtain the crystallization speed suitable<br>
for the recording conditions which are to be employed.<br>
When the Ge amount is large, the crystallization speed<br>
tends to be low, and accordingly for an information<br>
recording medium for higher velocity recording for<br>
example, the Ge content may be reduced to adjust the<br>
crystallization speed. However, the crystallization<br>
speed relates to the other element contents also, and<br>
when the Sb or Sn amount is large, the crystallization<br>
speed tends to be high, and the In or Te amount is large,<br>
the crystallization speed tends to be low. Accordingly,<br>
it is preferred to adjust the Ge content after the ratio<br>
of the contents of the elements other than Ge is<br>
determined taking the above described various<br>
characteristics into consideration, thereby to adjust the<br>
crystallization speed in accordance with the recording<br>
conditions. If the Ge content is too high, the<br>
crystallization speed tends to be too low, and<br>
accordingly x in the above formula (1) is at most 0.3,<br>
and preferably at most 0.25, more preferably at most 0.2.<br>
Here, the Ge and Te contents have particularly<br>
significant influence over the crystallization speed.<br>
Further, if the Ge content is high, when the<br>
recorded amorphous marks are stored for a long term, they<br>
tend to be hardly crystallized as compared with<br>
immediately after the recording before the storage. If<br>
this phenomenon is remarkable, the signal quality of the<br>
overwritten recording signals tends to be insufficient<br>
when the overwriting is carried out after the recorded<br>
information recording medium is stored for a long term.<br>
Namely, the signal quality of the new recording marks is<br>
deteriorated since the old marks after the long term<br>
storage are not adequately erased. This phenomenon that<br>
the crystallization is less likely to take place is<br>
problematic only at the first recording after the long<br>
term storage, and the amorphous marks which are newly<br>
recorded after the long term storage have normal<br>
crystallization speed. At any rate, this phenomenon is<br>
reduced by decreasing the Ge content. In this view, the<br>
Ge content is preferably small, and the value x in the<br>
above formula (1) is particularly preferably at most 0.1,<br>
most preferably at most 0.07. In the present invention,<br>
the above various characteristics are satisfied, and in<br>
addition, reduction of the phenomenon was successful.<br>
As described above, Te and In have an effect to<br>
lower the crystallization speed, and the Ge content can<br>
be reduced when the Te or In content is high, in order to<br>
obtain the same crystallization speed when the<br>
crystallization speed is made low. In this view, the Te<br>
content i.e. the value z is preferably at least 0.05,<br>
more preferably at least 0.08, most preferably at least<br>
0.1. Still further, the In content i.e. the value wxy is<br>
preferably at least 0.05, more preferably at least 0.08.<br>
Further, if the Te content is high, it is preferred that<br>
both In and Sn are contained as mentioned above. Namely,<br>
in the most preferred composition, all of Ge, In, Sb, Sn<br>
and Te are contained.<br>
On the other hand, if the Ge content is too low, the<br>
storage stability of the amorphous marks tends to<br>
deteriorate, and the amorphous marks tend to be<br>
crystallized by the long term storage. The storage<br>
stability of the amorphous marks tends to be improved<br>
also by increasing the In amount, but the influence of Ge<br>
tends to be more significant. On the other hand, the<br>
storage stability of the amorphous marks may be<br>
relatively favorable in some cases even if the Ge content<br>
is zero, by influences of other elements. Accordingly,<br>
the value x in the above formula (1) is at least 0,<br>
preferably higher than 0, more preferably at least 0.01,<br>
furthermore preferably at least 0.02.<br>
[1-2] The contents of Ge, In, Sn, Te and Sb in the<br>
phase-change recording material of the present invention<br>
In the present invention, the possible maximum and<br>
minimum contents of the respective elements Ge, In, Sn,<br>
Te and Sb constituting the phase change recoding material<br>
of the present invention are necessarily determined from<br>
the conditions in the above formula (1) i.e. seven<br>
conditions (a) the Sb content is higher than any one of<br>
the Ge content, the In content, the Sn content and the Te<br>
content, (b) 0=x=0.3, (c) 0.07=y-z, (d) wxy-z=0.1,<br>
(e)0=z, (f) (l-w)xy=0.35 and (g) 0.35=l-x-y-z.<br>
Specifically, a computer program to judge whether or<br>
not the above seven conditions are satisfied when the<br>
values x, y, z and w are independently changed from 0 to<br>
1 by 0.001 each time is prepared and executed to obtain<br>
the possible maximum and minimum contents of Ge, In, Sn,<br>
Te and Sb. Needless to say, the total of the atomicity<br>
ratios of Ge, In, Sn, Te and Sb is 1. Further, by<br>
reducing the degree of the changes of the value to e.g.<br>
by 0.0001 or by 0.00001, more detailed ranges of the<br>
respective atoms Ge, In, Sn, Te and Sb can be obtained.<br>
In Table 1, an example of the above computer program<br>
prepared by means of Visual Basic is shown.<br>
TABLE 1<br>
Example of a program to obtain the minimum value and<br>
the maximum value regarding each element content by<br>
numerical calculation (prepared by Visual Basic)<br>
minGe=l 'minimum value of x<br>
Further, according to the above program, the<br>
possible range of y-z which is the difference between the<br>
total of the In content and/or the Sn content and the Te<br>
content is from 0.070 to 0.449, and the possible range of<br>
wxy-z which is the difference between the In content and<br>
the Te content is from -0.279 to 0.100.<br>
The numbers indicating the ranges of the contents of<br>
the respective elements according to the above program<br>
somewhat change depending upon the significant digit at<br>
the time of the program execution.<br>
Further, the above conditions (a) to (g) may change<br>
in accordance with the changes of the conditions of the<br>
preferred range, the more preferred range etc., as<br>
explained in the above [1-1], and when the conditions are<br>
changed, the above computer program is executed again<br>
employing the new conditions to obtain the upper limit<br>
and the lower limit of the respective elements Ge, In,<br>
Sn, Te and Sb.<br>
Here, the composition cannot freely be changed<br>
independently within the range of the composition of each<br>
element alone, and needless to say, priority is given to<br>
the conditions of the formulae (a) to (g).<br>

characteristics. In order to obtain the effect of<br>
improving the characteristics, the addition amount is<br>
preferably at least 0.1 at.% (atomic%) of the entire<br>
composition of the alloy. However, it is preferably at<br>
most 10 at.% in order not to impair the preferred<br>

the present invention. Particularly preferred is<br>
addition of N (nitrogen), and an addition of at least 0.1<br>

the crystallization temperature or the crystallization<br>
speed.<br>

[2] Information recording medium<br>
Now, the information recording medium of the present<br>
invention will be explained below.<br>
The information recording medium of the present<br>
invention is an information recording medium having a<br>
recording layer, characterized in that the above<br>
recording layer contains a composition represented by the<br>
following formula (1) as the main component:<br>
Gex(InwSni-w)yTezSb1-x-y-z (1)<br>
(wherein the Sb content is higher than any one of the Ge<br>
content, the In content, the Sn content and the Te<br>
content, and x, y, z and w representing atomic ratios,<br>
satisfy the following (i) to (vi):<br>
In the present invention, it is preferred that of<br>
the information recording medium, the crystalline state<br>
corresponds to a non-recorded state, and the amorphous<br>
state corresponds to a recorded state. This is because<br>
it is estimated that not many crystal nuclei are present<br>
in the recording layer composition of the present<br>
invention. That is, in a case where the amorphous states<br>
corresponds to a non-recorded state and crystalline state<br>
marks are formed in the amorphous state, it is preferred<br>
to use a recording layer composition in which many<br>
crystal nuclei are present. This is because when a large<br>
number of crystal nuclei are present in the recording<br>
layer, the shape of the crystalline state marks is less<br>
likely to be influenced by the position of the crystal<br>
nuclei. On the other hand, as described above, not many<br>
crystal nuclei are present in the recording layer<br>
composition of the present invention, and accordingly<br>
favorable recording is likely to be carried out when the<br>
crystalline state corresponds to a non-recorded state and<br>
amorphous state recording marks are formed in the<br>
crystalline state, rather than when the amorphous state<br>
corresponds to a non-recorded state and crystalline state<br>
recording marks are formed in the amorphous state.<br>
By using the composition represented by the above<br>
formula (1) for the recording layer, excellent recording<br>
signal characteristics such as the reflectivity, the<br>
signal amplitude and the jitter characteristics can be<br>
obtained even when recording/erasing is carried out at a<br>
high velocity, and it is possible to obtain favorable<br>
storage stability of the amorphous marks (recording<br>
signals). Further, when the information recording medium<br>
of the present invention is stored for a long term also,<br>
the change in the reflectivity of the recorded signals is<br>
small, and excellent recording signal characteristics can<br>
be maintained even when overwriting is carried out again.<br>
Further, the information recording medium of the present<br>
invention, by employing the above composition, can<br>
provide excellent repeated recording durability. The<br>
explanation regarding the formula (1) is the same as in<br>
the above [1], and explanation is omitted here.<br>
Such an information recording medium is not<br>
particularly limited so long as recording and retrieving<br>
of the information are carried out by detecting the<br>
difference in physical parameters between the crystalline<br>
state and the amorphous state, and an information<br>
recording medium detecting the difference in the<br>
refractivity, the electrical resistance, the volume, the<br>
change in density, etc. may, for example, be mentioned.<br>
Particularly, the information recording medium employing<br>
the phase-change recording material of the present,<br>
invention is suitable for an application to an optical<br>
information recording medium on which recording is<br>
carried out by means of a laser beam. Particularly, it<br>
is suitable for an application to a phase-change type<br>
optical information recording medium utilizing the change<br>
in the reflectivity accompanying a reversible change of<br>
the crystalline state caused by irradiation with a laser<br>
beam.<br>
Now, the specific structure of the optical<br>
information recording medium of the present invention,<br>
the recording and retrieving method, etc. will be<br>
explained below.<br>
[2-1] Optical information recording medium<br>
(Layer structure)<br>
As the optical information recording medium, usually<br>
one having a multilayer structure as shown in Fig. l(a)<br>
or Fig. 1(b) is employed. Namely, it is preferred that<br>
on a substrate, a recording layer containing a<br>
composition represented by the above formula (1) as the<br>
main component is formed, and a protective layer is<br>
further formed, as evident from Fig. 1(a) and Fig. l(b).<br>
The more preferred layer structure of the optical<br>
information recording medium is such a structure that a<br>
first protective layer, a recording layer, a second<br>
protective layer and a reflective layer are formed in<br>
this order along the incident direction of the retrieving<br>
laser beam. Namely, in a case where the retrieving laser<br>
beam enters from the substrate side, preferred is a layer<br>
structure of a substrate, a first protective layer (lower<br>
protective layer), a recording layer, a second protective<br>
layer (upper protective layer) and a reflective layer<br>
(Fig. l(a)), and in a case where the retrieving laser<br>
beam enters from the recording layer side, preferred is a<br>
layer structure of a substrate, a reflective layer, a<br>
second protective layer (lower protective layer), a<br>
recording layer, a first protective layer (upper<br>
protective layer) and a covering layer (Fig. l(b)).<br>
Needless to say, each layer may consist of more than<br>
two layers, and an interlayer may be formed between the<br>
respective layers. For example, between the substrate<br>
and the protective layer when the retrieving laser beam<br>
enters from the substrate side, or on the protective<br>
layer when the retrieving laser beam enters from the side<br>
opposite to the substrate, a transparent and extremely<br>
thin metal, semiconductor or dielectric layer having<br>
absorption, etc. may be formed so as to control the<br>
amount of the laser energy which enters the recording<br>
layer.<br>
Further, a reflective layer is formed on the side<br>
opposite to the incident side of the recording/retrieving<br>
laser beam in many cases as mentioned above, but this<br>
reflective layer is not essential. Further, the<br>
protective layer which is preferably formed on at least<br>
one side of the recording layer may be made to have a<br>
multilayer structure with materials having different<br>
characteristics.<br>
Now, the respective layers will be explained in<br>
detail.<br>
(A) Recording layer<br>
(A-l) Materials contained in recording layer and their<br>
amount<br>
The materials contained in the recording layer<br>
comprise a composition represented by the above formula<br>
(1) as the main component. This composition was already<br>
explained in detail, and the explanation is omitted here.<br>
In order to effectively obtain the effect of the present<br>
invention, the composition represented by the above<br>
formula (1) is contained usually in an amount of at least<br>
50 atomic%, preferably at least 80 atomic%, more<br>
preferably at least 90 atomic%, particularly preferably<br>
at least 95 atomic%, based on the entire recording layer.<br>
The higher the content is, the more remarkably the effect<br>
of the present invention can be obtained. However, even<br>
if another component such as O or N is contained at the<br>
time of film formation of the recording layer, the<br>
effects of the present invention such as high speed<br>
recording/erasing can be securely obtained when the<br>
content is within a range of from several atomic% to 20<br>
atomic%.<br>
(A-2) Film thickness of recording layer<br>
The thickness of the recording layer is usually at<br>
least 1 nm, preferably at least 5 nm. With such a<br>
thickness, the difference in the reflectivity (contrast)<br>
between the crystalline state and the amorphous state<br>
will be adequate, and the crystallization speed will be<br>
adequate, whereby it will be possible to erase the record<br>
in a short time. Further, the reflectivity itself will<br>
be adequate. On the other hand, the thickness of the<br>
recording layer is usually at most 30 nm, preferably at<br>
most 25 nm, more preferably at most 20 nm, particularly<br>
preferably at most 15 nm. With such a thickness, an<br>
adequate optical contrast will be obtained, and cracks<br>
are less likely to form on the recording layer. Further,<br>
deterioration of the recording sensitivity due to<br>
increase in the thermal capacity is less likely to occur.<br>
Further, within the above film thickness range, the<br>
volume change due to the phase change can be moderately<br>
suppressed, and microscopic and irreversible deformation<br>
of the recording layer itself or the protective layer to<br>
be formed on or below the recording layer, which may<br>
cause noises when recording is repeatedly carried out, is<br>
less likely to be accumulated. Such accumulation of the<br>
deformation tends to decrease the repeated recording<br>
durability, and by bringing the film thickness of the<br>
recording layer to be within the above range, this<br>
tendency can be suppressed.<br>
In a case of an optical information recording medium<br>
for high density recording on which recording/retrieving<br>
is carried out by means of a focused laser beam of an<br>
object lens having a numerical aperture of from about 0.6<br>
to about 0.65 from a LD (laser diode) having a wavelength<br>
of about 650 nm, such as rewritable DVD, or an optical<br>
information recording medium for high, density recording<br>
on which recording/retrieving is carried out by means of<br>
a focused laser beam of an object lens having a numerical<br>
aperture of from about 0.7 to about 0.85 from a blue LD<br>
having a wavelength of about 400 nm, the requirement<br>
against noises is more strict. Accordingly, in such a<br>
case, the more preferred thickness of the recording layer<br>
is at most 25 nm.<br>
(A-3) More preferred embodiment regarding recording<br>
layer film thickness<br>
In the present invention, it is considered that with<br>
respect to an optical information recording medium having<br>
a recording layer containing the predetermined Ge-In-Sb-<br>
Sn-Te type composition as the main component, on which<br>
high velocity recording/erasing is possible, by making<br>
the film thickness of the recording layer extremely thin,<br>
the recording characteristics at the second recording<br>
after the optical information recording medium is stored<br>
for a long time can be made good, and decrease in the<br>
reflectivity after the long term storage can be reduced.<br>
Specifically, it seems that by making the film thickness<br>
of the recording layer preferably at most 11 nm, of the<br>
optical information recording medium employing the<br>
recording layer of the above predetermined Ge-In-Sb-Sn-Te<br>
type composition, the recording characteristics at the<br>
second recording after the long term storage tend to be<br>
improved, and the decrease in the reflectivity after the<br>
long term storage tend to be reduced.<br>
Regarding the optical information recording medium<br>
employing the recording layer of the above predetermined<br>
Ge-In-Sb-Sn-Te type composition, the jitter at the second<br>
recording after the long term storage (preservation) is<br>
somewhat poor in some cases.<br>
The recording characteristics at the second<br>
recording after the long term storage (preservation) mean<br>
the characteristics in the following two cases (shelf<br>
second recording, archival second recording).<br>
First, to carry out recording on a medium which is<br>
stored for a long time after the initial crystallization<br>
in a non-recorded state, for the first time after the<br>
preservation, is referred to as shelf first recording,<br>
and to successively carry out overwriting thereon is<br>
referred to as shelf second recording. In a case where<br>
the preservation period is relatively short,<br>
substantially no increase in the jitters is observed when<br>
the shelf second recording is carried out. However, in a<br>
case where the preservation period is long, the increase<br>
in the jitters may be remarkable at the shelf second<br>
recording in some cases. The increased jitters decrease<br>
when the overwriting is carried out repeatedly several<br>
times, and the overwriting recording characteristics<br>
before the preservation recovers. The reason is not<br>
necessarily clear, but is supposed to be related to such<br>
a tendency that the signal intensity at the shelf first<br>
recording after the long term storage is low. Namely,<br>
when recording is carried out after an optical<br>
information recording medium is stored for a long term,<br>
the signal amplitude at the shelf first recording tends<br>
to be low. The signal amplitude recovers by further<br>
recording several times, and accordingly, the decrease in<br>
the signal amplitude at the shelf first recording is<br>
supposed to be caused by that the recording mark is less<br>
likely to be large when the crystalline portion after the<br>
long term storage is formed into an amorphous phase for<br>
the first time. Further, the reason why the jitter is<br>
likely to deteriorate at the shelf second recording after<br>
the long term storage is supposed to be because a portion<br>
which is formed into an amorphous phase for the first<br>
time (a portion which is not irradiated with the<br>
recording laser beam at the shelf first recording) and a<br>
portion which is formed into an amorphous phase again<br>
(for a second time) are both present. Namely, it is<br>
considered that there is a dispersion of the size of the<br>
amorphous marks due to the above presence of two portions<br>
in the shelf second recording.<br>
Further, the cause of such a tendency that the<br>
amorphous marks are less likely to be large at the shelf<br>
first recording after the long term storage is not clear,<br>
but it is supposed that a certain change occurs at the<br>
crystalline portion of the recording layer by the long<br>
term storage, since the characteristics recover after<br>
recording several times. By making the recording layer<br>
extremely thin (preferably at most 11 nm), the<br>
characteristics at the shelf second recording after the<br>
long term storage are improved, and this is considered to<br>
be because the above change at the recording layer<br>
crystalline portion tends to be suppressed.<br>
On the other hand, the other second recording after<br>
the long term storage (preservation) on an overwritable<br>
information recording medium on which amorphous marks are<br>
formed, is a recording in a case where a once recorded<br>
information (a state where amorphous marks are formed) is<br>
preserved for a long term, and overwriting is carried out<br>
again to rewrite the information.<br>
Recording which is carried out on an information<br>
recording medium on which recording is carried out before<br>
the preservation, for the first time after the long term<br>
preservation, will be referred to as the archival second<br>
recording. In this case, in a case where the<br>
preservation period is relatively short, substantially no<br>
increase in the jitters is observed when the archival<br>
second recording is carried out. However, at the<br>
archival second recording in a case where the<br>
preservation period is long, such a phenomenon that the<br>
increase in the jitters is remarkable may be observed in<br>
some cases. The increased jitters decrease when the<br>
overwriting is repeatedly carried out several times.<br>
Further, the overwriting recording characteristics before<br>
the preservation recovers.<br>
It is supposed that the above phenomenon occurs<br>
because the amorphous marks recorded before the storage<br>
are changed into a more stable amorphous state by the<br>
long term storage, and erasure by the recrystallization<br>
will be insufficient even if recording (overwriting) is<br>
further carried out. Since the amorphous state is in a<br>
quasi-stable state, it is possible that the amorphous<br>
state is changed into a more stable amorphous state by<br>
the long term storage. Stable amorphous marks tend to be<br>
less likely to be erased in general, and noises due to<br>
unerased amorphous marks occur.<br>
From the above point of view, the fact that the<br>
jitter decreases when overwriting is successively carried<br>
out after the archival second recording is carried out is<br>
explainable. Namely, when the archival second recording<br>
is carried out, the formed amorphous marks are in "newly<br>
formed" amorphous state, and recover to the initial<br>
amorphous state which is relatively easily erased.<br>
When the recording layer is made to be extremely<br>
thin, it is likely to be influenced by the interface of<br>
another layer which is in contact with the recording<br>
layer. Accordingly, the improvement in the stability of<br>
the amorphous state may be considered to be brought about<br>
by the amorphous state being maintained in a certain<br>
quasi-stable state due to the above effect of the<br>
interface.<br>
Here, regarding the above two second recordings<br>
(shelf second recording, archival second recording), it<br>
is not clear whether either one mainly has influences,<br>
and there is a possibility that both have influences at<br>
the same time.<br>
At any rate, the long term storage stability of<br>
recorded amorphous marks itself is considered to depend<br>
on the above-described subtle change of the crystalline<br>
state and/or the amorphous state of the recording layer.<br>
Further, the first recording on the; non-recorded state<br>
which is stored for a long term is also considered to<br>
depend on the above-described subtle change of the<br>
crystalline state and/or the amorphous state of the<br>
recoding layer. Further, the storage stability of the<br>
recording medium including the shelf and archival second<br>
recordings on a medium which is preserved for a long term<br>
after the recording is also considered to depend on the<br>
above-described subtle change of the crystalline state<br>
and/or the amorphous state of the recording layer.<br>
The above phenomenon is particularly remarkable when<br>
the phase-change recording material of the present<br>
invention is employed particularly for high velocity<br>
recording (approximately, a linear velocity of at least<br>
20 m/s at recording). Heretofore, the above phenomenon<br>
is hardly problematic with respect to an information<br>
recording medium employed for low linear velocity<br>
recording. This is because the recording linear velocity-<br>
has conventionally been low. It is considered that the<br>
above phenomenon is a newly found problem since the<br>
phase-change recording material of the present invention<br>
is applicable for high velocity recording.<br>
With respect to the phase-change recording material<br>
of the present invention, the increase in the jitter at<br>
the shelf second recording and the archival second<br>
recording in high linear velocity recording can be<br>
suppressed low as compared with a conventional eutectic<br>
type material in the vicinity of Sb70Te3O or eutectic type<br>
material in the vicinity of Sb85Ge15. Further, by making<br>
the recording layer thin, the above increase in the<br>
jitter can be suppressed more effectively.<br>
Further, by making the recording layer extremely<br>
thin (preferably at most 11 nm), the decrease in the<br>
reflectivity due to the long term storage tends to be<br>
suppressed. The reason is not clear also, but is<br>
considered that the change of the recording layer at the<br>
long term storage is suppressed in the same manner as in<br>
the case of improvement in the recording characteristics<br>
at the second recording after the long term storage.<br>
With respect to the recording layer having the above<br>
predetermined Ge-In-Sb-Sn-Te type composition, if the In<br>
content is high and the Te content is low, the<br>
reflectivity may decrease after the optical information<br>
recording medium is subjected to an environment<br>
resistance test (in a state similar to the state after<br>
the optical information recording medium is stored for a<br>
long term) in some cases. Accordingly, it is preferred<br>
that the In content and the Te content are in a specific<br>
relation (wxy-z=0.1 in the above formula (1)). However,<br>
the decrease in the reflectivity after the above<br>
environment resistance test (after the long term storage)<br>
tends to be suppressed by making the recording layer<br>
extremely thin, and thus there is a possibility that In<br>
and Te may not be in the above predetermined relation.<br>
This means that the possible recording layer composition<br>
range widens by making the recording layer extremely<br>
thin. From this viewpoint also, it is preferred to make<br>
the recording layer thin.<br>
However, the recording characteristics such as the<br>
signal amplitude may be impaired in some cases if the<br>
recording layer is extremely thin. Regarding this point,<br>
the recording characteristics such as the signal<br>
amplitude can be at an adequately satisfactory level by<br>
adjusting the layer structure and the film thicknesses of<br>
the optical information recording medium.<br>
Namely, in a case of an optical information<br>
recording medium in which on a substrate, a protective<br>
layer, a Ge-In-Sb-Sn-Te type recording layer having a<br>
predetermined composition, a protective layer and a<br>
reflective layer are formed in this order or in the<br>
opposite order, the signal intensity tends to be low when<br>
the recording layer is made extremely thin (thinner than<br>
about 12 nm for example). Accordingly, a device is<br>
required to obtain a high signal intensity, in a case<br>
where the recording layer is made extremely thin (at most<br>
11 nm for example).<br>
For example, one method is to change the film<br>
thickness of the protective layer located on the side<br>
from which the laser beam enters the recording layer.<br>
Namely, the film thickness of the protective layer is<br>
made thinner than the film thickness of the protective<br>
layer with which the reflectivity of the optical<br>
information recording medium reaches the minimum value.<br>
The film thickness with which the reflectivity reaches<br>
the minimum value various depending upon the laser<br>
wavelength to be employed, however, it is in the vicinity<br>
of 50 nm at the film thickness in the vicinity of 650 nm<br>
in DVD. By employing such a film thickness, the signal<br>
intensity becomes optically high.<br>
However, it is known that when the film thickness of<br>
the protective layer on the laser beam incident side<br>
becomes thin, the thermal influence over e.g. the<br>
substrate tends to be significant, and the repeated<br>
recording durability tends to deteriorate in general.<br>
Accordingly, the above method of making the film<br>
thickness of the protective layer thin (in the vicinity<br>
of 50 nm for example) can be hardly employed. It is<br>
considered that a favorable repeated recording durability<br>
of an optical information recording medium can be<br>
obtained by employing a protective layer A (a protective<br>
layer containing a metal oxysulfide and/or a metal<br>
nitride) as described hereinafter for the entire<br>
protective layer or by employing the protective layer A<br>
as described hereinafter for the protective layer region<br>
of the protective layer which is in contact with the<br>
recording layer, even if the film thickness of the<br>
protective layer on the side from which the laser beam<br>
enters relative to the recording layer is made thin (at<br>
most 50 nm for example), against the above tendency. The<br>
details about the protective layer A will be explained<br>
below.<br>
Under the above situation, the film thickness of the<br>
recording layer of the present embodiment is preferably<br>
at most 15 nm, more preferably at most 14 nm, furthermore<br>
preferably at most 13 nm, particularly preferably at most<br>
12 nm, most preferably at most 11 nm.<br>
On the other hand, as mentioned above, also in a<br>
case where the film thickness of the recording layer is<br>
made extremely thin in order to improve the recording<br>
characteristics after the long term storage, no adequate<br>
signal intensity can be obtained even by adjusting the<br>
layers other than the recording layer if the film<br>
thickness of the recording layer is excessively thin.<br>
The lower limit of the signal intensity depends on the<br>
performance of the retrieving apparatus, and in a case of<br>
rewritable DVD, the signal intensity tends to be low and<br>
the use tends to be difficult if the recording layer film<br>
thickness is less than 3 run. Accordingly, the recording<br>
layer film thickness is at least 3 run in rewritable DVD<br>
for example. Usually preferred is a recording layer film,<br>
thickness of at least 5 run.<br>
(A-4) Method for producing recording layer<br>
The above recording layer can be obtained by DC or<br>
RF sputtering of a predetermined alloy target in an inert<br>
gas, particularly in an Ar gas.<br>
Further, the density of the recording layer is<br>
usually at least 80%, preferably at least 90% of the bulk<br>
density. As the bulk density p, an approximate value<br>
from the following mathematical formula (2) is usually<br>
employed, but it may be actually measured by preparing a<br>
mass having an alloy composition constituting the<br>
recording layer:<br>
 (2)<br>
wherein mi is the molar concentration of each element i,<br>
and pi is the atomic weight of the element i.<br>
In the sputtering deposition method, the high energy<br>
Ar amount to be irradiated on the recording layer is<br>
increased by lowering the pressure of the sputtering gas<br>
(usually rare gas such as Ar, hereinafter explanation<br>
will be made with reference to the case of Ar) at the<br>
time of deposition, or by disposing the substrate in the<br>
vicinity of the front of the target, thereby to increase<br>
the density of the recording layer. The high energy Ar<br>
is usually either part of Ar ions to be irradiated on the<br>
target for sputtering which are bounced off and reach the<br>
substrate side, or the Ar ions in the plasma which are<br>
accelerated by the sheath voltage of the entire substrate<br>
face and reach the substrate.<br>
Such an irradiation effect of the high energy rare<br>
gas is referred to as an atomic peening effect, and in<br>
the sputtering by an Ar gas which is commonly employed,<br>
Ar is incorporated into the sputtering film by the atomic<br>
peening effect. Accordingly, the atomic peening effect<br>
can be appraised by the Ar amount in the film. Namely,<br>
the small Ar amount indicates a small high energy Ar<br>
irradiation effect, and a film with a low density is<br>
likely to form.<br>
On the other hand, if the Ar amount is large,<br>
irradiation of the high energy Ar tends to be intense,<br>
and the density of the film tends to be high. However,<br>
Ar incorporated in the film is likely to precipitate as a<br>
void at the time of repeated recording, and is likely to<br>
deteriorate the repeated recording durability.<br>
Accordingly, the discharge is carried out under an<br>
appropriate pressure, usually between the order of from<br>
10-2 to 10-1 Pa.<br>
Now, other constituting elements in the structure of<br>
the optical information recording medium which is the<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
explained below.<br>
(B) Substrate<br>
As the substrate to be used in the present<br>
invention, a resin such as a polycarbonate, an acrylic<br>
resin or a polyolefin, or glass, or a metal such as<br>
aluminum may be employed. Usually guide grooves with a<br>
depth of a level of from 20 to 80 ran are formed on the<br>
substrate, and thus preferred is a substrate made of a<br>
resin on which the guide grooves can be formed by<br>
molding. Further, in the case of a so-called substrate<br>
face incidence (Fig. l(a)) wherein the focused laser beam<br>
for erasing/retrieving the record enters from the<br>
substrate side, the substrate is preferably transparent.<br>
The thickness of the substrate is usually at least<br>
0.05 mm and at most 1.5 mm, however, one of about 1.2 mm<br>
for CD or one of about 0.6 mm for DVD is employed.<br>
Further, in a case where the optical head of the laser<br>
has a high NA and a short wavelength is employed to<br>
achieve a high density, a thin substrate of about 0.1 mm<br>
may also be used.<br>
(C) Protective layer<br>
(C-l) General explanation regarding protective layer used<br>
in the present invention<br>
In order to prevent evaporation and deformation due<br>
to the phase change of the recording layer, thereby to<br>
control the thermal diffusion at that time, usually a<br>
protective layer is formed on one or both sides of the<br>
recording layer, preferably on both sides. The material<br>
of the protective layer is determined taking into<br>
consideration the refractive index, the thermal<br>
conductivity, the chemical stability, the mechanical<br>
strength, the adhesive properties, etc. Usually, a<br>
dielectric such as an oxide, sulfide, nitride or carbide<br>
of a metal or semiconductor, having high transparency and<br>
high melting point, or a fluoride of Ca, Mg, Li or the<br>
like may be employed.<br>
In this case, such an oxide, sulfide, nitride,<br>
carbide or fluoride may not necessarily take a<br>
stoichiometrical composition, and the composition may be<br>
controlled to adjust the refractive index, etc., and it<br>
is effective to use them as a mixture. When repeated<br>
recording characteristics are taken into consideration, a<br>
mixture of dielectrics is preferred. More specifically,<br>
a mixture of ZnS or a chalcogen compound such as a rare<br>
earth sulfide with a heat resistant compound such as an<br>
oxide, nitride, carbide or fluoride may be mentioned.<br>
For example, a mixture of heat resistant compounds<br>
containing ZnS as the main component, or a mixture of<br>
heat resistant compounds containing an oxysulfide of the<br>
rare earth, particularly Y2O2S as the main component is<br>
one example of the preferred protective layer<br>
composition.<br>
As the material to form the protective layer,<br>
usually a dielectric material may be mentioned. The<br>
dielectric material may, for example, be an oxide of e.g.<br>
Sc, Y, Ce, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Zn, Al, Cr, In, Si<br>
or Ge, a nitride of e.g. Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo,<br>
W, Zn, B, Al, Si, Ge or Sn, a carbide of e.g. Ti, Zr, Hf,<br>
V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W or Si, or a mixture thereof.<br>
Further, as the dielectric material, a sulfide, selenide<br>
or telluride of e.g. Zn, Y, Cd, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb,<br>
Sb or Bi, an oxysulfide of e.g. Y or Ce, a fluoride of<br>
e.g. Mg or Ca, or a mixture thereof, may be mentioned.<br>
Further, as a specific example of the dielectric<br>
material, ZnS-SiO2, SiN, SiO2, TiO2, CrN, TaS2 or Y2O2S<br>
may, for example, be mentioned. Among these materials,<br>
ZnS-SiO2 is widely used in view of the high film<br>
deposition rate, the small film stress, the low rate of<br>
change of the volume due to the change in the temperature<br>
and the excellent weather resistance. In a case where<br>
ZnS-SiO2 is used, the compositional ratio of ZnS to SiO2<br>
i.e. ZnS:SiO2 is usually from 0:1 to 1:0, preferably from<br>
0.5:0.5 to 0.95:0.05, more preferably from 0.7:0.3 to<br>
0.9:0.1. Most preferably ZnS:SiO2 is 0.8:0.2.<br>
Taking the repeated recording characteristics into<br>
consideration, the film density of the protective layer<br>
is preferably at least 80% of the bulk state in view of<br>
the mechanical strength. In a case where a mixture of<br>
dielectrics is used, the theoretical density of the<br>
above-described mathematical formula (2) is employed as<br>
the bulk density.<br>
The thickness of the protective layer is usually at<br>
least 1 nm and at most 500 nm in general. When it is at<br>
least 1 nm, the effect of preventing the deformation of<br>
the substrate or the recording layer can be secured, and<br>
a role as the protective layer can be fulfilled.<br>
Further, when it is at most 50 0 nm, while the role as the<br>
protective layer can be fulfilled, such a phenomenon can<br>
be prevented that the internal stress of the protective<br>
layer itself, the difference in the elastic<br>
characteristics with the substrate or the like will be<br>
remarkable, and thus cracks are formed.<br>
Particularly when a first protective layer is<br>
formed, the first protective layer is required to<br>
suppress e.g. deformation of the substrate (deformation<br>
of the covering layer) due to heat, and thus its<br>
thickness is usually at least 1 nm, preferably at least 5<br>
nm, particularly preferably at least 10 nm. With such a<br>
thickness, accumulation of the microscopic deformation of<br>
the substrate during the repeated recording can be<br>
suppressed, and no remarkable noise increase by<br>
scattering of the retrieving laser beam will occur.<br>
On the other hand, the thickness of the first<br>
protective layer is preferably at most 200 nm, more<br>
preferably at most 150 nm, furthermore preferably at most<br>
100 nm, with relation to the time required for film<br>
formation. With such a thickness, e.g. the change of the<br>
groove shape of the substrate as viewed on the recording<br>
layer plane is less likely to occur. For example, such a<br>
phenomenon that the depth or width of the grooves is<br>
smaller than the intended shape on the substrate surface<br>
is less likely to take place.<br>
On the other hand, in a case where a second<br>
protective layer is formed, the thickness of the second<br>
protective layer is usually at least 1 nm, preferably at<br>
least 5 nm, particularly preferably at least 10 nm so as<br>
to suppress the deformation of the recording layer.<br>
Further, it is preferably at most 200 nm, more preferably<br>
at most 150 nm, furthermore preferably at most 100 nm,<br>
particularly preferably at most 50 nm, so as to prevent<br>
accumulation of the microscopic plastic deformation in<br>
the interior of the second protective layer which occurs<br>
due to the repeated recording and to suppress the noise<br>
increase due to the scattering of the retrieving laser<br>
beam.<br>
The thicknesses of the recording layer and the<br>
protective layers are selected taking into consideration<br>
the interference effects attributable to the multilayer<br>
structure in addition to the restrictions from the<br>
viewpoint of the mechanical strength and reliability, so<br>
that the efficiency for absorption of the laser beam will<br>
be good, and the amplitude of recording signals, i.e. the<br>
contrast between the recorded state and the non-recorded<br>
state, will be large.<br>
The protective layer is produced usually by a known<br>
sputtering method.<br>
The protective layer may be constituted by a<br>
plurality of layers made of different materials as<br>
described above. Particularly, it is preferred to form<br>
an interfacial layer containing no sulfur or having a low<br>
sulfur content at the interface on the side which is in<br>
contact with the recording layer and/or at the interface<br>
on the side which is in contact with the reflective layer<br>
containing Ag as the main component.<br>
The interfacial layer to be formed on the interface<br>
on the side which is in contact with the recording layer<br>
containing Ag as the main component is usually used to<br>
suppress the reaction of Ag with sulfur (corrosion of Ag)<br>
in a case where the protective layer contains sulfur.<br>
The material of the interfacial layer may be Ta, Nb<br>
or Mo. Among these materials, preferred is Nb or Mo.<br>
The atomic weight of Nb or Mo is relatively close to that<br>
of Ag contained in the reflective layer, and the exit<br>
angle of each element from the target will be<br>
substantially the same as that of Ag at the time of<br>
deposition by means of a sputtering method, and thus<br>
there is such an advantage that the film thickness<br>
distribution on the substrate which faces the target can<br>
be secured, and uniformity is easily secured. Further,<br>
the cost of Nb or Mo per 1 kg of the raw material is 1/10<br>
to 1/100 and is very low, and the target can be produced<br>
at a low cost, such being favorable.<br>
The content of the material in the interfacial layer<br>
is preferably at least 80 atomic%, more preferably at<br>
least 90 atomic%, particularly preferably at least 95<br>
atomic%, and it is most preferably 100 atomic% (that is,<br>
the interfacial layer is made of pure Nb in an example of<br>
using Nb for the interfacial layer).<br>
The interfacial layer may contain other elements to<br>
such an extent that the characteristics of the layer are<br>
not impaired, as the case requires. In a case where<br>
other elements are contained, the content of the above<br>
elements is preferably at most 2 0 atomic%, more<br>
preferably at most 10 atomic%, particularly preferably at<br>
most 5 atomic%, most preferably at most 2 atomic%.<br>
Further, the above elements may, for example, be Ni, Pd,<br>
Pt, Si, O, Se, V, Ti or Ta.<br>
The interfacial layer may be made of a dielectric<br>
material containing no sulfur, other than the above.<br>
Specifically, an oxide, nitride or carbide of a metal or<br>
semiconductor, such as SiC, Si3N4, SiC, GeN, Ta2O5,<br>
ZrO2AlN or Al2O3 may, for example, be employed. They may<br>
not necessarily take a stoichiometrical composition, and<br>
a mixture may also be used.<br>
The film thickness of the interfacial layer is<br>
preferably at least 1 nm, more preferably at least 2 nm.<br>
The reaction between the protective layer and the<br>
reflective layer may not effectively suppressed in some<br>
cases if the interfacial layer is excessively thin.<br>
However, within the above range, the reliability of the<br>
optical information recording medium will be favorably<br>
secured even in a reliability test in a severe<br>
environment at a high temperature in high humidity<br>
(80°C/85%RH for example).<br>
On the other hand, the film thickness of the<br>
interfacial layer is preferably at most 10 run, more<br>
preferably at most 8 nm, furthermore preferably at most 6<br>
nm. Within the above range, the reaction between Ag in<br>
the reflective layer and S in the protective layer can be<br>
suppressed while the transmittance of the interfacial<br>
layer is favorably secured.<br>
The interfacial layer is formed usually by a<br>
sputtering method.<br>
(C-2) Preferred embodiment of protective layer<br>
It is preferred that the information recording<br>
medium used in the present invention has a protective<br>
layer A in contact with the recording layer employing the<br>
predetermined Ge-In-Sb-Sn-Te type material, and the<br>
protective layer A contains a metal oxysulfide and/or a<br>
metal nitride.<br>
In a case where the information recording medium of<br>
the present invention is used as a phase-change type<br>
optical information recording medium, as the material of<br>
the protective layer, usually (ZnS)80(SiO2)20 is used.<br>
This is because this material is excellent in<br>
transparency, the adhesive properties to a conventional<br>
recording layer, the sputtering rate, the cost, etc.<br>
However, when the protective layer of the above<br>
(ZnS)80(SiO2) 20 is used for the recording layer having the<br>
predetermined Ge-In-Sb-Sn-Te type composition on which<br>
high speed recording/erasing is possible, an object to<br>
further improve the repeated recording durability arises<br>
in some cases. It is considered that one cause is that a<br>
quick change in temperature is brought about in erasing<br>
the record of an optical information recording medium for<br>
high speed recording, as compared with an optical<br>
information recording medium for low speed recording.<br>
For example, in a case where the recording linear<br>
velocity doubles, the time to increase the temperature of<br>
the recording layer by irradiation with the laser beam<br>
will be 1/2, and further, the cooling rate tends to be<br>
high also. This is because the temperature distribution<br>
of the melted region of the recording layer is gentle<br>
when the recording is carried out at a low linear<br>
velocity, whereas it tends to be sharp when the recording<br>
is carried out at a high linear velocity. Further, the<br>
distance between the melted region and the laser beam<br>
tends to be relatively long in the recording at a high<br>
linear velocity as compared with the recording at a low<br>
linear velocity. Of course, as the cause of the above<br>
repeated recording durability not being adequate, a cause<br>
resulting from the recording layer material itself, such<br>
as a difference in properties regarding the material flow<br>
due to the melting and solidification, or such a cause<br>
that the atomic diffusion of e.g. sulfur which is<br>
reported in the case of the combination with a<br>
conventional recording material is more likely to occur,<br>
may also be considered.<br>
In the present invention, by forming a protective<br>
layer A containing GeN for example as the metal nitride<br>
or Y2O2S for example as the metal oxysulfide in contact<br>
with the recording layer containing a Ge-In-Sb-Sn-Te type<br>
recording layer material, further improvement of the<br>
repeated recording durability of the information<br>
recording medium can be expected. The reason why the<br>
improvement of the repeated recording durability can be<br>
expected by forming a protective layer A containing a<br>
metal nitride such as GeN or a metal oxysulfide such as<br>
Y2O2S is not necessarily clear, but is supposed to be<br>
because effects to suppress the deformation of the<br>
recording layer due to the quick change in the<br>
temperature by carrying out the high speed recording as<br>
compared with a conventional one, the material flow in<br>
the recording layer, the atomic diffusion between the<br>
layers, can be obtained.<br>
As mentioned above, when the protective layer A in<br>
contact with the recording layer contains a metal<br>
oxysulfide or a metal nitride, the repeated recording<br>
characteristics (repeated overwriting characteristics)<br>
tend to improve. Accordingly, it is considered that the<br>
above protective layer A has a high affinity with Sb, Ge,<br>
In and Sn constituting the phase-change recording<br>
material of the present invention.<br>
(1) Protective layer A<br>
In the present invention, it is preferred to<br>
incorporate a metal oxidesulfide and/or a metal nitride<br>
into the protective layer A in contact with the recording<br>
layer. Of course, a metal oxysulfide and a metal nitride<br>
may be used together. Now, explanation will be made in<br>
further detail.<br>
(1-1) Protective layer A containing metal oxysulfide<br>
In the present invention, it is preferred to use the<br>
protective layer A containing a metal oxysulfide.<br>
Containing a metal oxysulfide means that the constituting<br>
element is present while maintaining the form of the<br>
metal oxysulfide.<br>
In the present invention, it is expected that the<br>
durability when recording is carried out repeatedly on<br>
the information recording medium further improves by<br>
forming the protective layer A containing a metal<br>
oxysulfide in contact with the recording layer having a<br>
specific composition. The reason is not clearly<br>
understood yet, but is supposed to be related with high<br>
thermal conductivity and hardness of the protective layer<br>
A containing a metal oxysulfide and high uniformity of<br>
the distribution of the constituting element. Namely,<br>
the protective layer A in the present invention has high<br>
thermal conductivity and hardness as compared with a<br>
protective layer employing a composite dielectric<br>
containing ZnS as the main component, as represented by a<br>
ZnS-SiO2 film which has conventionally been commonly<br>
used. On the other hand, the refractive index of the<br>
protective layer A is usually from about 1.7 to about<br>
2.4 although it depends on the compositional ratio, and<br>
is substantially the same as that of a protective layer<br>
employing a composite dielectric containing ZnS as the<br>
main component.<br>
Further, it is supposed that deformation of the<br>
recording layer due to thermal expansion tends to be<br>
small since the thermal conductivity of the protective<br>
layer A containing a metal oxysulfide is high. Namely,<br>
since the thermal conductivity of the protective layer A<br>
is high, the heat of the recording layer which is heated<br>
when the recording marks are formed by the laser can be<br>
let loose quickly. Accordingly, the difference in<br>
temperature between the interfacial region which is in<br>
contact with the recording layer of the protective layer<br>
A and the region of the protective layer A which is apart<br>
from the recording layer, or the difference in<br>
temperature between the mark-formed region and the<br>
peripheral region can be instantaneously dissolved. As a<br>
result, peeling of the film or occurrence of the cracks<br>
resulting from the difference in temperature can be<br>
suppressed. In other words, it is thought that the<br>
overwriting deterioration can be delayed. The thermal<br>
conductivity can be indirectly known from the value of<br>
the laser power when amorphous marks are formed on the<br>
prepared disk. Namely, the higher the thermal<br>
conductivity, the higher the laser power required to heat<br>
the recording layer tends to be high. For example, in a<br>
case where a protective layer A containing a metal<br>
oxysulfide is used, the power required for mark formation<br>
tends to be high as compared with a case where a<br>
protective layer of ZnS:SiO2=80:20 (mol%) is used. This<br>
is because the function of the protective layer A as a<br>
heat dissipation layer is increased due to a high thermal<br>
conductivity.<br>
Further, the JIS Knoop hardness of the protective<br>
layer using ZnS:SiO2=80:20 (mol%) is 280, whereas the JIS<br>
Knoop hardness of the protective layer A using Y2O2S for<br>
example as the metal oxysulfide is 520. The protective<br>
layer A having a high hardness is important with a view<br>
to preventing the deformation of the recording layer. If<br>
the hardness is low, it is difficult to appropriately<br>
suppress the change in the volume of the recording layer<br>
due to recording/erasing, i.e. the deformation resulting<br>
from the difference in the volume between the amorphous<br>
state and the crystalline state, and the deformation is<br>
accumulated along with the increase in the number of the<br>
overwriting, thus causing decrease in the signal<br>
intensity.<br>
Further, in the protective layer A containing a<br>
metal oxysulfide, the metal atom is bonded to both sulfur<br>
and oxygen, and accordingly the mixing properties of<br>
sulfur with oxygen are incomparably high in comparison<br>
with a protective layer employing a mixture of a sulfide<br>
and an oxide such as ZnS-SiO2 or ZnS-Y2O3. Accordingly,<br>
it is supposed that the protective layer A has stably<br>
high performance since the dispersibility of sulfur and<br>
oxygen with metal atoms such as selenium atoms is higher<br>
than conventional ZnS-SiO2- Accordingly, it is thought<br>
that such a phenomenon that sulfur diffusion from the<br>
protective layer to the recording layer during the<br>
repeated overwriting to cause a decrease in the<br>
reflectivity or a change in the crystallization speed is<br>
suppressed.<br>
Further, in a case where the protective layer A<br>
containing a metal oxysulfide such as Y2O2S is formed in<br>
contact with the predetermined Ge-In-Sb-Sn-Te type<br>
recording layer to be used in the present invention, the<br>
signal amplitude of the information recording medium<br>
tends to be high as compared with a case where the<br>
protective layer A contains a metal nitride such as GeN.<br>
The reason is not clear, but such a reason that the<br>
properties of the crystal growth of the recording layer<br>
are slightly changed by the protective layer A in contact<br>
with the recording layer, and the size of the amorphous<br>
marks to be formed varies, may be considered. Such<br>
properties are considered to be determined by the<br>
combination of the recording layer material and the<br>
material of the protective layer A, and with respect to<br>
the conventional recording layer material, the change of<br>
the signal intensity by the material of the protective<br>
layer A has not attracted an attention.<br>
As the metal element used for the metal oxysulfide,<br>
a rare earth metal element such as Sc, yttrium or a<br>
lanthanoid element such as La or Ce; or a transition<br>
metal element such as Ti may, for example, be mentioned.<br>
Among them, a rare earth metal element is preferred, a<br>
rare earth metal element selected from the group<br>
consisting of yttrium and La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb and<br>
Dy is particularly preferred, and most preferred is<br>
yttrium or Ce. The oxysulfide of yttrium (Y2O2S) is<br>
thermochemically more stable than Y2O3 or Y2S3 up to about<br>
1000°C, and accordingly the most preferred element is<br>
yttrium.<br>
The content of the metal oxysulfide in the<br>
protective layer A is preferably at least 5 mol%, more<br>
preferably at least 10 mol%, most preferably at least 15<br>
mol%. If the content of the metal oxysulfide is too low,<br>
the overwriting characteristics may be insufficient in<br>
some cases. On the other hand, in view of the repeated<br>
overwriting characteristics etc., the content of the<br>
metal oxysulfide in the protective layer A is preferably<br>
as high as possible, and the content of the metal<br>
oxysulfide in the protective layer A may be at most 100<br>
mol%.<br>
Further, the content of the metal element<br>
constituting the metal oxysulfide in the protective layer<br>
A is usually at least 10 atomic%, preferably at least 20<br>
atomic%, more preferably at least 2 5 atomic%. The<br>
content of the metal element constituting the metal<br>
oxysulfide is an index indicating the content of the<br>
metal oxysulfide in the protective layer A, and if the<br>
metal element is too small, the effect for further<br>
improving the overwriting characteristics may not be<br>
adequate in some cases. On the other hand, in view of<br>
the repeated overwriting characteristics, the content of<br>
the metal oxysulfide in the protective layer A is<br>
preferably as high as possible, and thus the upper limit<br>
of the content of the metal element constituting the<br>
metal oxysulfide is the content of the metal element when<br>
the protective layer A consists entirely of the metal<br>
oxysulfide.<br>
Further, for the protective layer A, a metal<br>
oxysulfide and another material may be used together.<br>
Said another material is not particularly limited so long<br>
as it is a material which is commonly used for the<br>
protective layer. For example, a material exemplified in<br>
the above "General explanation regarding protective layer<br>
used in the present invention" may optionally be used.<br>
More specifically as another material, an oxide,<br>
sulfide, nitride, carbide or fluoride of a metal or<br>
semiconductor, as represented by zinc sulfide, zinc<br>
oxide, silicon oxide, silicon nitride, aluminum nitride,<br>
aluminum oxide, a rare earth oxide, a rare earth sulfide,<br>
a rare earth fluoride, magnesium fluoride, etc. may, for<br>
example, be mentioned. Among them, particularly<br>
preferred is a zinc compound such as zinc sulfide or zinc<br>
oxide, which is excellent in the adhesive properties to<br>
the recording layer. As a result, a more stable and<br>
higher durability can be obtained.<br>
In a case where another material is contained in the<br>
protective layer A other than the metal oxysulfide, the<br>
content of the material is usually at most 99 mol%,<br>
preferably at most 90 mol%. On the other hand, it is<br>
usually at least 1 mol%, preferably at least 5 mol%.<br>
However, the appropriate content varies depending<br>
upon the type of the material to be mixed. For example,<br>
in a case where zinc sulfide is used as the above<br>
material, its amount may be high, and it is usually at<br>
least 20 mol%, preferably at least 30 mol%, furthermore<br>
preferably at least 50 mol%, most preferably at least 60<br>
mol%.<br>
On the other hand, in a case where zinc oxide is<br>
used as the above material, a too high content tends to<br>
be unfavorable, and the content is usually at most 30<br>
mol%, preferably at most 20 mol%, furthermore preferably<br>
at most 10 mol%. Further, the molar content of zinc<br>
oxide is more preferably at most half the molar content<br>
of the metal oxysulfide.<br>
As the particularly preferred composition of the<br>
protective layer A, a mixed composition containing Y2O2S<br>
and ZnS may be mentioned. In this case, particularly<br>
excellent overwriting characteristics can be obtained.<br>
In this case, the molar ratio of ZnS to Y2O2S is usually<br>
at least 1%, preferably at least 5%, more preferably at<br>
least 10%, and usually at most 1000%, preferably at most<br>
700%, furthermore preferably at most 500%.<br>
Further, it is possible to let zinc in the metal<br>
form be present in the protective layer A. However, it<br>
is contained preferably in the form of a zinc compound<br>
such as zinc oxide or zinc sulfide as described above.<br>
In the present invention, the purity of the<br>
protective layer A (the content of the metal oxysulfide<br>
or the content of a mixture of the metal oxysulfide with<br>
another material in the protective layer A) is preferably<br>
at least 90 mol%. The purity is preferably as high as<br>
possible, however, the influence of impurities in an<br>
amount less than 10 mol% over the characteristics of the<br>
protective layer A is negligible. Particularly when the<br>
impurities are stable compounds, the bad influence tends<br>
to be small, however, if the amount of the impurities<br>
exceeds 10 mol%, there is high possibility that the<br>
physical property values such as the hardness or the<br>
stress of the film change, and the characteristics of the<br>
protective layer A may deteriorate.<br>
The protective layer A containing a metal oxysulfide<br>
can be formed by deposition by means of a sputtering<br>
method using a target containing a metal oxysulfide.<br>
Usually, a target having a composition within, a range<br>
substantially the same as the preferred composition of<br>
the protective layer A is used.<br>
Namely, it is preferred to use one containing a<br>
metal oxysulfide as the target for sputtering. The type<br>
of the metal element of the metal oxysulfide to be used<br>
for the target is optionally selected according to the<br>
composition of the protective layer A.<br>
Further, in a case where the protective layer A<br>
contains a metal oxysulfide and another protective layer<br>
material, a target of a mixture of the metal oxysulfide<br>
and the another material may be used in accordance with<br>
the composition of the another material to be used.<br>
Further, a target of the metal oxysulfide and a target of<br>
the above another material may be separately prepared,<br>
and they are subjected to sputtering at the same time.<br>
The content of the metal oxysulfide in the target is<br>
usually at least 10 mol%, preferably at least 30 mol%,<br>
more preferably at least 50 mol%. If the content of the<br>
metal oxysulfide in the target is excessively low, the<br>
metal oxysulfide may be decomposed in the target, whereby<br>
the metal oxysulfide cannot be incorporated in the<br>
protective layer A in some cases. On the other hand, the<br>
content of the metal oxysulfide in the target varies<br>
depending upon the content of the above another material<br>
used. However, in a case where a target comprising only<br>
metal oxysulfide is used, the content of the metal<br>
oxysulfide in the target is usually 100 mol%.<br>
Whether or not the metal oxysulfide is contained in<br>
the target can be confirmed by measuring the X-ray<br>
diffraction of the target.<br>
Further, the target containing a metal oxysulfide is<br>
produced usually by using a powder of the metal<br>
oxysulfide or a mixed powder of an oxide and a sulfide of<br>
the same metal, by using a known method such as hot<br>
pressing method. Preferred as the metal element to be<br>
used is a rare earth metal element.<br>
As the conditions for sputtering, known conditions<br>
may be employed.<br>
For the analysis of the composition of the<br>
protective layer A, usually the composition may be<br>
identified by combination of e.g. Auger electron<br>
spectroscopy (AES), Rutherford back scattering (RBS),<br>
inductively-coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP) etc.<br>
(1-2) Protective layer A containing metal nitride<br>
In the present invention, it is preferred to use a<br>
protective layer A containing a metal nitride.<br>
A metal nitride tends to have a high thermal<br>
conductivity similar to the metal oxysulfide.<br>
Accordingly, it is considered that the high thermal<br>
conductivity of the protective layer A suppresses peeling<br>
of the film or occurrence of the cracks resulting from<br>
the difference in temperature, and can delay<br>
deterioration during the overwriting, similar to the<br>
above case of one containing a metal oxysulfi.de as<br>
mentioned above.<br>
As the metal to be used for the metal nitride, at<br>
least one element selected from the group consisting of<br>
Si, Ge, Al, Ti, Ta, Cr, Mo, Sb, Sn, Nb, Y, Zr and Hf may,<br>
for example, be mentioned. The nitride of such an<br>
element is stable, and thus the storage stability of the<br>
optical information recording medium tends to improve.<br>
Preferred as the above element is Si, Ge, Al or Cr which<br>
provides higher transparency and excellent adhesion<br>
properties. A plurality of the above elements may be<br>
used. In a case of a nitride of an alloy comprising a<br>
plurality of the above elements, it is preferred to use a<br>
nitride of an alloy containing Ge as the main component.<br>
"Containing Ge as the main component" means that the Ge<br>
content in the alloy is usually at least 50 atomic%,<br>
preferably at least 70 atomic%, more preferably at least<br>
80 atomic%, particularly preferably at least 90 atomic%,<br>
most preferably at least 95 atomic%.<br>
In a case where one type of the above elements is<br>
used, as the material formed by the above element and<br>
nitrogen, nitride of the above element simple substance<br>
may be mentioned. More specifically, a composition in<br>
the vicinity of e.g. Si-N, Ge-N, Cr-N or Al-N may be<br>
mentioned. Among them, in view of higher effect for<br>
preventing diffusion against the recording layer, it is<br>
preferred to use Si-N (nitride of silicon) , Ge-N (nitride<br>
of germanium) or Al-N (nitride of aluminum), and it is<br>
more preferred to use Ge-N (nitride of germanium). In<br>
this case, an nitride of an alloy containing Ge as the<br>
main component, having part of Ge substituted by e.g. Cr<br>
may also be used. However, the amount substituted is<br>
preferably at most 50%, more preferably at most 3 0% of Ge<br>
by the atomicity ratio.<br>
In a case where at least two of the above elements<br>
are used, as the material formed by the above elements<br>
and nitrogen, a composite nitride of the above elements<br>
may be mentioned. As such a compound, as representative<br>
examples using Ge-N, one containing, together with Ge,<br>
e.g. Al, B, Ba, Bi, C, Ca, Ce, Cr, Dy, Eu, Ga, In, K, La,<br>
Mo, Nb, Ni, Pb, Pd, Si, Sb, Sn, Ta, Te, Ti, V, W, Yb, Zn<br>
or Zr, such as Ge-Si-N, Ge-Sb-N, Ge-Cr-N, Ge-Al-N, Ge-Mo-<br>
N or Ge-Ti-N may be mentioned.<br>
The content of the metal nitride in the protective<br>
layer A is preferably at least 5 mol%, more preferably at<br>
least 10 mol%, most preferably at least 15 mol%. If the<br>
content of the metal nitride is too low, the overwriting<br>
characteristics may decrease in some cases. On the other<br>
hand, in view of the repeated overwriting characteristics<br>
etc., the content of the metal nitride in the protective<br>
layer A is preferably as high as possible, and the<br>
content of the metal nitride in the protective layer A<br>
may be at most 100 mol%.<br>
Further, the content of the metal element<br>
constituting the metal nitride in the protective layer A<br>
is usually at least 10 atomic%, preferably at least 20<br>
atomic%, more preferably at least 25 atomic%. If the<br>
content of the metal oxysulfide is too low, the effect<br>
for further improving the overwriting characteristics may<br>
not be adequate in some cases. On the other hand, in<br>
view of the repeated overwriting characteristics etc.,<br>
the content of the metal nitride in the protective layer<br>
A is preferably as high as possible, and thus the upper<br>
limit of the content of the metal element constituting<br>
the metal nitride is the content of the metal element<br>
when the protective layer A consists entirely of the<br>
metal nitride.<br>
Further, for the protective layer A, a metal nitride<br>
and another material may be used together. As the<br>
another material and its content, the same ones as<br>
explained for the protective layer A containing a metal<br>
oxysulfide may be employed.<br>
In the present invention, the purity of the<br>
protective layer A (the content of the metal nitride or<br>
the content of a mixture of the metal nitride and another<br>
material in the protective layer A) is preferably at<br>
least 90 mol%. The purity is preferably as high as<br>
possible, however, the influence of impurities in an<br>
amount less than 10 mol% over the characteristics of the<br>
protective layer A is negligible. Particularly when the<br>
impurities are stable compounds, the bad influence tends<br>
to be small, however, if the amount of the impurities<br>
exceeds 10 mol%, there is high possibility that the<br>
physical property values such as the hardness or the<br>
stress of the film change, and the characteristics of the<br>
protective layer A may deteriorate.<br>
The protective layer A containing a metal nitride<br>
can be formed by means of a sputtering method using a<br>
target containing a metal nitride. Further, the<br>
protective layer A may be formed also by a reactive<br>
sputtering method in which a slight amount of a mixed gas<br>
of Ar and N2 is flown in a vacuum chamber, and under a<br>
predetermined vacuum pressure, a voltage is applied to a<br>
target comprising a predetermined metal (a single metal<br>
element or a metal element composite in the metal nitride<br>
contained in the protective layer A) for discharge, and<br>
the ejected single metal element or metal element<br>
composite is reacted with N2 to convert it into a nitride<br>
for deposition. Here, it has to be noted that the<br>
transparency of the protective layer A is hardly secured<br>
if the nitrogen content in the protective layer A is<br>
excessively low, and the improvement of the repeated<br>
recording durability of the optical information recording<br>
medium tends to be insufficient if the nitrogen content<br>
is excessively high. Accordingly, in a case where the<br>
above reactive sputtering method is employed, it is<br>
important to adjust the nitrogen flow amount. Further,<br>
the pressure at the time of sputtering also has an<br>
influence over the film properties. Usually, by<br>
decreasing the pressure, the protective layer A can be<br>
formed densely.<br>
For the analysis of the composition of the<br>
protective layer A, the composition can be identified<br>
usually by combination of Auger electron spectroscopy<br>
(AES), Rutherford back scattering (RBS), inductively-<br>
coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP) etc.<br>
(1-3) Film thickness of protective layer A<br>
The preferred range of the film thickness of the<br>
protective layer A varies depending upon the position at<br>
which the protective layer A is used.<br>
Namely, in a case where the protective layer A is<br>
formed as the first protective layer, the first<br>
protective layer is required to suppress e.g. the<br>
deformation of the substrate due to heat, and its<br>
thickness is usually at least 1 nm, preferably at least 5<br>
ran, particularly preferably at least 10 nm. With such a<br>
thickness, accumulation of the microscopic deformation of<br>
the substrate during the repeated recording can be<br>
suppressed, and no remarkable noise increase by<br>
scattering of the retrieving laser beam will occur.<br>
On the other hand, the thickness of the first<br>
protective layer is preferably at most 200 nm, more<br>
preferably at most 150 nm, furthermore preferably at most<br>
10 0 nm, with relation to the time required for film<br>
formation. With such a thickness, e.g. a change in the<br>
groove shape of the substrate as viewed on the recording<br>
layer plane is less likely to occur. For example, such a<br>
phenomenon that the depth or width of the grooves is<br>
smaller than the intended shape on the substrate surface<br>
is less likely to take place.<br>
In a case where the protective layer A is formed as<br>
the second protective layer, the thickness of the second<br>
protective layer is usually at least 1 nm, preferably at<br>
least 5 nm, particularly preferably at least 10 nm so as<br>
to suppress deformation of the recording layer. Further,<br>
in order to prevent accumulation of microscopic plastic<br>
deformation in the interior of the second protective<br>
layer which occurs along with the repeated recording,<br>
thereby to suppress the noise increase by scattering of<br>
the retrieving laser beam, it is preferably at most 200<br>
nm, more preferably at most 150 nm, furthermore<br>
preferably at most 100 nm, particularly preferably at<br>
most 50 nm.<br>
However, in the present invention, usually the<br>
protective layer A having a high thermal conductivity and<br>
having a high hardness is formed in contact with the<br>
recording layer, and accordingly the film thickness of<br>
the protective layer A located on the side from which the<br>
laser beam enters relative to the recording layer can be<br>
made thin, as explained above. Namely, in a case where<br>
the protective layer A is formed in contact with the<br>
recording layer face on the side from which the laser<br>
beam enters, the film thickness of the protective layer A<br>
is preferably at most 50 nm.<br>
The sputtering rate of the material containing a<br>
metal oxysulfide such as Y2O2S as the main component,<br>
tends to be lower than the sputtering rate of a material<br>
such as (ZnS)80(SiO2)20 which has conventionally been<br>
employed. Accordingly, with a view to increasing the<br>
productivity of the information recording medium, the<br>
protective layer A containing a metal oxysulfide may be<br>
formed relatively thinly in contact with the recording<br>
layer and a protective layer B may be formed in contact<br>
with the protective layer A. Further, a material which<br>
has conventionally been employed (e.g. (ZnS)80(SiO2) 20)<br>
may be used for the protective layer B. The details of<br>
the specific embodiment of such an information recording<br>
medium will be described hereinafter.<br>
As mentioned above, in a case where the protective<br>
layer has a multilayer structure by using the protective<br>
layer A and the protective layer B, the film thickness of<br>
the protective layer A in the present invention is<br>
usually at least 0.1 nm, preferably at least 1 nm, more<br>
preferably at least 5 nm. On the other hand, the film<br>
thickness of the protective layer A is usually at most<br>
100 run, preferably at most 50 nm, more preferably at most<br>
2 5 nm, furthermore preferably at most 10 nm.<br>
(1-4) Position of protective layer A and recording layer<br>
In the present invention, it is preferred that the<br>
protective layer A containing a metal oxysulfide and/or a<br>
metal nitride is formed in contact with the recording<br>
layer. More preferably, the above predetermined<br>
protective layer A is formed on both sides of the<br>
recording layer. It is because the repeated overwriting<br>
characteristics can be further improved by forming the<br>
above predetermined protective layer A on both sides of<br>
the recording layer. In general, by forming the above<br>
predetermined protective layer A on both sides of the<br>
recording layer, the recording layer and the protective<br>
layer A tend to peel off, however, it is considered that<br>
the above problem of peeling is less likely to occur in<br>
the recording layer employing the predetermined Ge-In-Sb-<br>
Sn-Te type composition of the present invention.<br>
For example, if the protective layer A containing a<br>
metal oxysulfide such as Y2O2S is formed in contact with<br>
a conventional recording layer of SbTe eutectic<br>
composition, film peeling in an environment resistance<br>
test tends to occur. This tendency becomes more<br>
remarkable if the above protective layer A is formed on<br>
both sides of the recording layer. For example, with<br>
respect to a conventional recording layer employing a<br>
SbTe eutectic type composition, if the protective layer A<br>
containing a metal oxysulfide such as Y2O2S is formed in<br>
contact with both sides of the recording layer, film<br>
peeling occurs in an environment resistance test with<br>
high humidity, and the adhesive properties and the<br>
weather resistance of the film tend to be not necessarily<br>
sufficient.<br>
On the other hand, in a case where the protective<br>
layer A containing a metal oxysulfide such as Y2O2S is<br>
formed in contact with a recording layer employing the<br>
predetermined Ge-In-Sb-Sn-Te type composition of the<br>
present invention, film peeling hardly occurs in an<br>
environment resistance test even when the protective<br>
layer A is formed on both sides of the recording layer,<br>
and repeated recording durability does not substantially<br>
change as before and after the environment resistance<br>
test.<br>
Further, when the protective layer A containing a<br>
metal oxysulfide such as Y2O2S is formed in contact with<br>
the recording layer employing a conventional SbTe<br>
eutectic type composition, the stability of the amorphous<br>
marks tends to deteriorate. On the other hand, with the<br>
predetermined Ge-In-Sb-Sn-Te type composition used in the<br>
present invention, the stability of the amorphous marks<br>
can be increased by adjusting the composition.<br>
Accordingly, deterioration of the stability of the<br>
amorphous marks can be suppressed even when the<br>
protective layer A containing a metal oxysulfide such as<br>
Y2O2S is formed in contact with the recording layer.<br>
(2) Protective layer B<br>
Another example of the preferred layer structure of<br>
the optical information recording medium is to make one<br>
or both of the first and second protective layers have a<br>
two-layer structure comprising the protective layer A and<br>
the protective layer B. In view of e.g. the repeated<br>
overwriting, it is preferred to make the first protective<br>
layer located on the laser beam incident side have a two-<br>
layer structure (Figs. 5(a), 5(b)), and it is more<br>
preferred to make both the first and the second<br>
protective layers have a two-layer structure comprising<br>
the protective layer A and the protective layer B (Figs.<br>
6(a), 6(b)).<br>
In the above preferred layer structure, the first<br>
protective layer or the second protective layer has a<br>
two-layer structure comprising the protective layer A and<br>
the protective layer B, however, the layer structure is<br>
not limited to such an embodiment so long as the<br>
protective layer A is formed in contact with the<br>
recording layer. For example, it may be optionally<br>
carried out to make the first protective layer or the<br>
second protective layer have a multilayer structure of at<br>
least three layers, by further forming a protective layer<br>
formed by another material in contact with the protective<br>
layer B.<br>
(2-1) Material, production method etc. of protective<br>
layer B<br>
As the material of the protective layer B, a<br>
material commonly used for the protective layer may<br>
optionally be used. Such a material has already been<br>
explained, and the explanation is omitted here. The<br>
protective layers A and B may be two layers comprising<br>
different materials, or they may have a gradient<br>
composition in which the respective components gradually<br>
change.<br>
Further, as the method for producing the protective<br>
layer, a production method commonly used for the<br>
protective layer may be used.<br>
(2-2) Film thickness of protective layer B<br>
The protective layer B is in contact with the<br>
protective layer A, and plays a role as the protective<br>
layer in a two-layer structure of the protective layer A<br>
and the protective layer B. Accordingly, the film<br>
thickness of the protective layer B is a film thickness<br>
obtained by subtracting the film thickness of the<br>
protective layer A from the film thickness which is<br>
usually required for a protective layer.<br>
However, in the present invention, the protective<br>
layer A usually having a high thermal conductivity and a<br>
high hardness is formed in contact with the recording<br>
layer, and accordingly the film thickness of the<br>
protective layer located on the side from which the laser<br>
beam enters relative to the recording layer (for example,<br>
the film thickness of the protective layer A in a case<br>
where the protective layer is formed only by the<br>
protective layer A, or the total film thickness of the<br>
protective layer A and the protective layer B in a case<br>
where the protective layer A and the protective layer B<br>
are laminated to form the protective layer) can be made<br>
thin, as explained above.<br>
Namely, the total of the film thickness of the<br>
protective layer A and the film thickness of the<br>
protective layer B is preferably at most 50 nm, in a case<br>
where the protective layer A is formed in contact with<br>
the recording layer face on the side from which the laser<br>
beam enters, and the protective layer B is further formed<br>
in contact with the protective layer A.<br>
As mentioned above, in a case where the protective<br>
layer has a multilayer structure by using the protective<br>
layer A and the protective layer B, the film thickness of<br>
the protective layer A in the present invention is<br>
usually at least 0.1 nm, preferably at least 1 nm, more<br>
preferably at least 2 nm, furthermore preferably at least<br>
3 ran, particularly preferably at least 5 nm. On the<br>
other hand, the film thickness of the protective layer A<br>
is usually at most 100 nm, preferably at most 50 nm, more<br>
preferably at most 25 nm, furthermore preferably at most<br>
10 nm. Accordingly, the film thickness of the protective<br>
layer B is the rest obtained by subtracting the film<br>
thickness of the protective layer A from the total film<br>
thickness of the protective layer.<br>
The thicknesses of the recording layer and the<br>
protective layers are selected taking into consideration<br>
the interference effects attributable to the multilayer<br>
structure in addition to restrictions from the viewpoint<br>
of the mechanical strength and reliability, so that the<br>
efficiency for absorption of the laser beam will be good,<br>
and the amplitude of recording signals, i.e. the contrast<br>
between the recorded state and the non-recorded state,<br>
will be large.<br>
(D) Reflective layer<br>
In the optical information recording medium, a<br>
reflective layer may further be formed. In the present<br>
invention, it is preferred that the optical information<br>
recording medium further has a reflective layer with a<br>
view to increasing the heat dissipation properties of the<br>
recoding layer.<br>
The position at which the reflective layer is formed<br>
usually depends at the incident direction of the<br>
retrieving laser beam, and it is formed on the opposite<br>
side of the recording layer from the incident side.<br>
Namely, in a case where the retrieving laser beam enters<br>
from the substrate side, the reflective layer is formed<br>
usually on the opposite side of the recording layer from<br>
the substrate, and in a case where the retrieving laser<br>
beam enters from the recording layer side, the reflective<br>
layer is formed usually between the recording layer and<br>
the substrate (Figs. l(a), l(b)).<br>
Here, in addition to the reflective layer which<br>
completely reflects laser beam, an extremely thin<br>
reflective layer material layer which transmits at least<br>
half of the laser beam may be formed on the incident side<br>
of the recording layer in some cases, and this is used as<br>
a transparent reflective layer and distinguished from the<br>
reflective layer. The purpose of forming the transparent<br>
reflective layer is usually to adjust the phase of the<br>
incident laser beam or the reflective laser beam, or to<br>
accelerate heat dissipation from the protective layer on<br>
the incident laser beam side.<br>
As the material to be used for the reflective layer,<br>
a substance having a high reflectivity is preferred, and<br>
particularly preferred is a metal such as Au, Ag or Al<br>
which can be expected to have a heat dissipation effect<br>
also. The heat dissipation properties are determined by<br>
the film thickness and the thermal conductivity, and<br>
since the thermal conductivity is substantially in<br>
proportion to the volume resistivity in the case of such<br>
a metal, the heat dissipation performance may be<br>
represented by the sheet resistivity. The sheet<br>
resistivity is usually at least 0.05 O/?, preferably at<br>
least 0.1 O/?, and on the other hand, it is usually at<br>
most 0.6 O/?, preferably at most 0.5 O/?, more preferably<br>
at most 0.4 O/?, furthermore preferably at most 0.2 O/?.<br>
This is to guarantee particularly high heat<br>
dissipation properties, and is necessary to suppress<br>
recrystallization to a certain extent in a case where<br>
competition between the formation of an amorphous phase<br>
and the recrystallization is remarkable in the formation<br>
of amorphous marks, as in the recording layer to be used<br>
for the optical information recording medium. In order<br>
to control the thermal conductivity of the reflective<br>
layer itself or to improve the corrosion resistance, e.g.<br>
Ta, Ti, Cr, Mo, Mg, V, Nb, Zr or Si may be added in a<br>
small amount to the above metal. The addition amount is<br>
usually at least 0.01 atomic% and at most 20 atomic%. An<br>
aluminum alloy containing at least one of Ta and Ti in an<br>
amount of at most 15 atomic%, particularly an alloy of<br>
AlaTa1-a (O=a=O.15) is excellent in corrosion resistance,<br>
and is a particularly preferred reflective layer material<br>
with a view to improving the reliability of the optical<br>
information recording medium.<br>
Particularly in a case where the film thickness of<br>
the second protective layer is at least 40 nm and at most<br>
50 nm, the amount of the added element contained is<br>
preferably at most 2 atomic% so as to make the reflective<br>
layer have a high thermal conductivity.<br>
Particularly preferred as the material of the<br>
reflective layer is one containing Ag as the main<br>
component. "Containing Ag as the main component" means<br>
that Ag is contained in an amount of at least 50 atomic%<br>
based on the entire reflective layer. The content of Ag<br>
based on the entire reflective layer is preferably at<br>
least 70 atomic%, more preferably at least 80 atomic%,<br>
furthermore preferably at least 90 atomic%, particularly<br>
preferably at least 95 atomic%. Most preferred with a<br>
view to increasing the heat dissipation properties is to<br>
employ pure Ag as the material of the reflective layer.<br>
The reason why it is preferred that Ag is contained<br>
as the main component is as follows. Namely, recording<br>
is carried out again on recording marks which are stored<br>
for a long time, such a phenomenon may take place in some<br>
cases that the recrystallization speed of the phase-<br>
change recording layer is high only at the first<br>
recording immediately after the storage. The reason why<br>
such a phenomenon takes place is not clear, but is<br>
supposed to be because the size of the amorphous marks<br>
formed by the first recording immediately after the<br>
storage is smaller than the desired size of the marks due<br>
to increase in the recrystallization speed of the<br>
recording layer immediately after the storage.<br>
Accordingly, in a case where such a phenomenon takes<br>
place, Ag having extremely high heat dissipation<br>
properties may be used for the reflective layer to<br>
increase the cooling rate of the recording layer, whereby<br>
recrystallization of the recording layer at the first<br>
recording immediately after the storage can be suppressed<br>
and the size of the amorphous marks can be maintained to<br>
the desired size.<br>
A Ag alloy containing one member of Mg, Ti, Au, Cu,<br>
Pd, Pt, Zn, Cr, Si, Ge, Bi and a rare earth element in an<br>
amount of at least 0.01 atomic% and at most 10 atomic% in<br>
Ag also has a high reflectivity and a high thermal<br>
conductivity, is excellent in heat resistance and is<br>
preferred.<br>
The film thickness of the reflective layer is<br>
usually at least 10 nm so that the incident laser beam is<br>
completely reflected so that there is no transmitted<br>
light, and it is preferably at least 20 nm, more<br>
preferably at least 40 nm. Further, when it is too<br>
thick, there is no change in the heat dissipation effect,<br>
the productivity is unnecessarily deteriorated, and the<br>
cracks are likely to occur, and accordingly it is usually<br>
at most 500 nm. However, it is preferably at most 400<br>
nm, more preferably at most 300 nm.<br>
The recording layer, the protective layer and the<br>
reflective layer are formed usually by e.g. a sputtering<br>
method.<br>
It is preferred to carry out deposition in an in-<br>
line apparatus having a recording layer target, a<br>
protective layer target and, if necessary, a reflective<br>
layer material target provided in the same vacuum<br>
chamber, with a view to preventing oxidation or<br>
contamination among the respective layers. Further, it<br>
is excellent in view of the productivity also.<br>
(E) Protective coating layer (covering layer)<br>
It is preferred to form a protective coating layer<br>
comprising a ultraviolet-curing resin or a thermosetting<br>
resin on the outermost surface side of the optical<br>
information recording medium, so as to prevent direct<br>
contact with the air or to prevent scars by the contact<br>
with foreign materials. The protective coating layer has<br>
a thickness of usually from 1 urn to several hundred urn.<br>
Further, a dielectric protective layer having high<br>
hardness may further be formed, or a resin layer may<br>
further be formed thereon.<br>
(Initial crystallization method of optical information<br>
recording medium)<br>
The recording layer is formed usually by a physical<br>
vapor deposition method in vacuum such as a sputtering<br>
method. However, in a state immediately after the<br>
deposition (as-deposited state), the recording layer is<br>
usually amorphous, and therefore, it is preferred to<br>
crystallize the recording layer to form a non-recorded or<br>
erased state. This operation is referred to as<br>
initialization (or initial crystallization). As the<br>
initial crystallization operation, a method such as oven<br>
annealing in a solid phase at a temperature of at least<br>
the crystallization temperature (usually from 150 to<br>
3 00°C) and at most the melting point, annealing under<br>
irradiation with a light energy of e.g. a laser beam or a<br>
flash lamp beam or melt initialization may, for example,<br>
be mentioned. In the present invention, among the above<br>
initial crystallization operations, it is preferred to<br>
employ melt initialization, since a phase-change<br>
recording material with a small formation of crystal<br>
nuclei is employed.<br>
In the melt initialization, if the recrystallization<br>
speed is too slow, there will be a time until the thermal<br>
equilibrium is reached, whereby other crystalline phases<br>
may be formed in some cases. Accordingly, it is<br>
preferred to increase the cooling rate to some extent.<br>
Further, if the recording layer is held in a melted state<br>
for a long time, the recording layer may flow, a thin<br>
film such as the protective layer may peel off by the<br>
stress, or e.g. the resin substrate may deform, thus<br>
leading to destruction of the medium, such being<br>
unfavorable.<br>
For example, the time for maintaining the<br>
temperature at a level of at least the melting point is<br>
preferably usually at most 10 us, preferably at most 1<br>
US.<br>
Further, for the melt initialization, it is<br>
preferred to employ a laser beam. It is particularly<br>
preferred to carry out initial crystallization by using<br>
an oval laser beam having its minor axis substantially in<br>
parallel with the scanning direction (hereinafter, this<br>
initialization method may sometimes be referred to as<br>
"bulk erasing"). In such a case, the length of the major<br>
axis is usually from 10 to 1000 µm, and the length of the<br>
minor axis is usually from 0.1 to 5 urn.<br>
Here, the lengths of the major axis and the minor<br>
axis of the beam are defined from the half value width in<br>
a case where the light energy intensity distribution<br>
within the beam is measured. With respect to the beam<br>
shape also, the minor axis length is preferably at most 5<br>
urn, more preferably at most 2 -µm so as to easily realize<br>
local heating and rapid cooling in the minor axis<br>
direction.<br>
As the laser beam source, various types may be used<br>
including, for example, a semiconductor laser and a gas<br>
laser. The power of the laser beam is usually from about<br>
10 0 mW to about 10 W. Further, another light source may<br>
be used so long as a power density and a beam shape at<br>
the same level can be obtained. Specifically, a Xe lamp<br>
laser beam may, for example, be mentioned.<br>
In the initialization by bulk erasing, when a disk-<br>
form optical information recording medium is used for<br>
example, the minor axis direction of an oval beam is<br>
brought substantially into line with the circumferential<br>
direction, and by rotating the disk, scanning is carried<br>
out in the minor axis direction, while moving the beam in<br>
the major axis (radial) direction every full circle (one<br>
rotation), whereby initialization can be carried out over<br>
the entire surface. By doing this, a polycrystalline<br>
structure aligned in a specific direction relative to the<br>
focused laser beam for recording/retrieving scanned along<br>
the track in the circumferential direction can be<br>
realized.<br>
The moving distance in the radial direction per one<br>
revolution is preferably set to be shorter than the major<br>
axis of the beam, so that the irradiated regions overlap,<br>
and the same radial position will be irradiated a<br>
plurality of times with the laser beam. As a result,<br>
initialization can certainly be carried out, and at the<br>
same time, it is possible to avoid non-uniformity of the<br>
initial crystallization state attributable to the energy<br>
distribution (usually from 10 to 2 0%) in the radial<br>
direction of the beam. On the other hand, if the moving<br>
distance is too short, undesirable crystalline phases<br>
tend to be formed. Accordingly, the moving distance in<br>
the radial direction is usually set to be at least 1/2 of<br>
the major axis of the beam. Further, the scanning speed<br>
of the initialization energy beam is usually within a<br>
range of from 3 to 20 m/s.<br>
Whether or not at least the optical information<br>
recording medium of the present invention can be obtained<br>
by melt initialization can be judged by determining<br>
whether or not the reflectivity Rl in the non-recorded<br>
state after initialization is substantially equal to the<br>
reflectivity R2 in the erased state by recrystallization<br>
after recording of amorphous marks is carried out by a<br>
practical focused laser beam for recording (for example,<br>
a focused laser beam having a diameter of the beam of<br>
about 1 µm) . Here, R2 is the reflectivity at the erased<br>
portion after recording 10 times.<br>
Accordingly, the optical information recording<br>
medium of the present invention preferably satisfies the<br>
following relational expression (3) where the<br>
reflectivity at the non-recorded portion after initial<br>
crystallization is Rl and the reflectivity at the erased<br>
portion after recording 10 times is R2:<br>
AR=2|Rl-R2|/(Rl+R2)xl00(%)=10 (3)<br>
The reason why the reflectivity R2 at the erased<br>
portion after recording 10 times is taken as the judgment<br>
index is that when recording is carried out 10 times, the<br>
influence of the reflectivity in a crystalline state<br>
which may remain in a non-recorded state if recording is<br>
carried out only once, can be removed, and the entire<br>
surface of the optical information recording medium can<br>
be made to be in a state where it is recrystallized by<br>
recording and erasing at least once. On the other hand,<br>
if the number of recording is excessively higher than 10<br>
times, factors other than the change in the crystalline<br>
structure of the recording layer, such as microscopic<br>
deformation of the recording layer due to the repeated<br>
recording or diffusion of a foreign element from the<br>
protective layer to the recording layer may cause a<br>
change in the reflectivity, and accordingly it tends to<br>
be difficult to judge whether or not the desired<br>
crystalline state can be obtained.<br>
In the above relational expression (3), AR is at<br>
most 10%, and it is preferably at most 5%. When it is at<br>
most 5%, an optical information recording medium having<br>
lower signal noises can be obtained.<br>
For example, of an optical information recording<br>
medium with Rl of about 17%, R2 may be substantially<br>
within a range of from 16 to 18%.<br>
The above erased state may also be obtained by<br>
irradiation with the writing power in a direct current<br>
fashion to melt the recording layer, followed by<br>
resolidification, without necessarily modulating the<br>
focused recording laser beam in accordance with a<br>
practical recording pulse-generating method.<br>
In order to obtain the desired initial crystalline<br>
state of the phase-change recording material to be used<br>
for the recording layer in the present invention, it is<br>
particularly important to set the scanning speed of the<br>
initialization energy beam relative to the recording<br>
layer plane. Basically, it is important that the<br>
crystalline state after initial crystallization is<br>
similar to the crystalline state at the erased portion<br>
after recording, and accordingly, the scanning speed is<br>
preferably in the vicinity of the relative scanning<br>
linear velocity of the focused laser beam to the<br>
recording layer face when practical recording is carried<br>
out by using a focused laser beam. Specifically, the<br>
initialization energy beam is scanned at a linear<br>
velocity of from about 2 0 to about 80% of the maximum<br>
linear velocity when recording is carried out on the<br>
optical information recording medium.<br>
The maximum linear velocity for recording is, for<br>
example, a linear velocity when the erase ratio becomes<br>
at least 2 0 dB at the time of irradiation with an erasing<br>
power Pe in a direct current fashion at that linear<br>
velocity.<br>
The erase ratio is defined as the difference between<br>
the carrier level of signals of the amorphous marks<br>
recorded substantially at a single frequency and the<br>
carrier level after erasing by direct current irradiation<br>
of Pe. Measurement of the erase ratio is carried out as<br>
follows for example. Firstly, under recording conditions<br>
under which adequate signal characteristics (i.e. such<br>
characteristics that e.g. the reflectivity and the signal<br>
amplitude or the jitter satisfy specified values) are<br>
obtained, a condition with a high frequency is selected<br>
among modified signals to be recorded, recording is<br>
carried out 10 times at a single frequency to form<br>
amorphous marks, and the carrier level (C.L. at<br>
recording) is measured. Then, the direct current<br>
irradiation is carried out once on the amorphous marks<br>
while changing the erasing power Pe, and the carrier<br>
level at this time (C.L. after erasing) is measured, to<br>
calculate the difference between C.L. at recording and<br>
C.L. after erasing, i.e. the erase ratio. When the power<br>
Pe of the direct current irradiation is changed, the<br>
erase ratio tends to increase once, decrease and then<br>
increase again in general. Here, the first peak value of<br>
the erase ratio observed when the power Pe starts being<br>
increased is taken as the erase ratio of the sample in<br>
this case.<br>
With respect to the scanning speed of the<br>
initialization energy beam, if the initialization energy<br>
beam is scanned at a speed lower than about 2 0% of the<br>
above defined maximum linear velocity, phase separation<br>
may occur and a single phase is less likely to be<br>
obtained, or even if a single phase is obtained,<br>
crystallites may grow particularly in the initialization<br>
beam scanning direction and become giant, or aligned in<br>
an unfavorable direction. Preferably, the initialization<br>
energy beam is scanned at a speed of at least 30% of the<br>
recordable maximum linear velocity.<br>
On the other hand, if the initialization energy beam<br>
is scanned in a speed equal to the recordable maximum<br>
linear velocity i.e. at a rate higher than about 80% of<br>
that, a region once melted by the initial scanning tends<br>
to be formed into an amorphous state again, such being<br>
unfavorable. This is because when the scanning linear<br>
velocity is high, the cooling rate of the melted portion<br>
tends to be high, and the time for resolidification tends<br>
to be short. With a focused recording laser beam having<br>
a diameter of about 1 micron, recrystallization by<br>
crystal growth from the crystalline region at the<br>
periphery of the melted region can be completed in a<br>
short time. However, in a case where scanning is carried<br>
out with an initialization oval laser beam, the melted<br>
region area in the major axis direction tends to be<br>
large, and accordingly it is necessary that<br>
recrystallization during resolidification is carried out<br>
over the entire melted region by lowering the scanning<br>
linear velocity than that at the time of practical<br>
recording. From such a viewpoint, the scanning linear<br>
velocity of the initial energy beam is preferably at most<br>
70% of the recording maximum linear velocity, more<br>
preferably at most 60%, most preferably lower than 50%.<br>
The optical information recording medium of the<br>
present invention has such characteristics that when<br>
initial crystallization is carried out by irradiation<br>
with a laser beam, it is possible to increase the moving<br>
speed of the medium relative to the laser beam. This<br>
makes it possible to carry out initial crystallization in<br>
a short time, and is preferred in view of improvement of<br>
the productivity and the cost reduction.<br>
(Recording and retrieving method of optical information<br>
recording medium)<br>
The recording/retrieving laser beam to be used for<br>
the optical information recording medium of the present<br>
invention is usually a laser beam such as a semiconductor<br>
laser or a gas laser, and its wavelength is usually from<br>
3 00 to 800 nm, preferably from about 3 50 to about 800 run.<br>
Particularly, in order to achieve a high areal density of<br>
at least 1 Gbit/inch2, the focused laser beam diameter is<br>
required to be small, and it is desirable to obtain a<br>
focused laser beam by using a blue to red laser beam<br>
having a wavelength of from 350 to 680 nm and an object<br>
lens having a numerical aperture NA of at least 0.5.<br>
In the present invention, as mentioned above, it is<br>
preferred that the amorphous state corresponds to<br>
recording marks. Further, in the present invention, it<br>
is effective to record information by the mark length<br>
modulation system. This is particularly remarkable at<br>
the time of the mark length recording with a shortest<br>
mark length of at most 4 µm, particularly at most 1 µm.<br>
When the recording mark is formed, recording may be<br>
carried out by a conventional system of modulating the<br>
writing power into two levels of a high level (writing<br>
power) and a low level (erasing power), however, in the<br>
present invention, it is particularly preferred to employ<br>
a recording method by a system of modulating the writing<br>
power into at least three levels, e.g. by providing an<br>
off-pulse, the power in which is adequately lower than<br>
the erasing power when the recording mark is formed as<br>
follows.<br>
Fig. 2 is schematic views illustrating the power<br>
pattern of the recording laser beam in the recording<br>
method of an optical information recording medium. When<br>
an amorphous mark which is mark length-modulated into a<br>
length nT (wherein T is the reference clock period, and n<br>
is the mark length possible in the mark length modulation<br>
recording and is an integer), the amorphous mark is<br>
divided into m=n-k (provided that k is an integer of at<br>
least 0) recording pulses, each recording pulse width is<br>
aiT (l=i=m), and an off-pulse (cooling pulse) section<br>
with a time of biT (l=i=m) accompanies each recording<br>
pulse. With respect to the divided recording pulse in<br>
Fig. 2, description of the reference clock period T is<br>
omitted in view of understandability of the figure.<br>
Namely, in Fig. 2, a part which should be described as<br>
aiT is described simply as ai for example. Here, it is<br>
preferred that ai=bi, or ai=bi-1 (2=i=m or m-1). åai+åbi is<br>
usually n, but it may be åai+åbi=n+j (j is a constant<br>
which satisfies -2=j=2) so as to obtain an accurate nT<br>
mark.<br>
At the time of recording, irradiation with a<br>
recording laser beam with an erasing power Pe which may<br>
crystallize the amorphous state is carried out between<br>
marks. Further, at aiT (i=l to m) , irradiation with a<br>
recording laser beam with a writing power Pw sufficient<br>
to melt the recording layer is carried out, and at a time<br>
biT (l=i=m-l) , irradiation with the recording laser beam<br>
with a bias power (cooling power, off-pulse power) Pb<br>
which satisfies Pb<pe preferably pb is carried></pe>
out.<br>
The power Pb of the recording laser beam irradiated<br>
in a time with a period bmT is usually Pb<pe preferably></pe>
Pb=l/2Pe, similar to the period biT (l=i=m-l), but it may<br>
be Pb<pe.></pe.>
By employing the above recording method, the power<br>
margin or the recording linear velocity margin can be<br>
widened. This effect is particularly remarkable when the<br>
bias power Pb is set to be adequately low so that<br>
Pb=l/2Pe.<br>
In Fig. 2, the switching period (ai + bi)T or (bi-1+ai)T<br>
of the recording pulse (section aiT) and the off-pulse<br>
(section ßiT) is set to be substantially the same as T,<br>
that is, (ai+ßi) or (bi-1+ai) is set to be substantially 1.<br>
However, it is possible to set the switching period to be<br>
larger than IT, and particularly, it is possible to set<br>
it to be 2T or 3T.<br>
The above recording system is a system particularly<br>
suitable for an optical information recording medium<br>
wherein the phase-change recording material of the<br>
present invention is used for the recording layer. In<br>
the phase-change recording material of the present<br>
invention, as described above, the number of crystal<br>
nuclei in the amorphous marks is small, and<br>
recrystallization (erasure of the amorphous marks) is<br>
carried out mainly by the crystal growth from the<br>
crystalline region at the periphery of the amorphous<br>
marks. Accordingly, in high linear velocity recording,<br>
the crystallization speed is increased by increasing the<br>
crystal growth rate. This is one of the characteristics<br>
of the phase-change recording material of the present<br>
invention containing Sb as the main component, and<br>
particularly, the crystal growth rate can be selectively<br>
increased by increasing the Sb amount and decreasing Ge<br>
and Te. Such a composition adjustment promotes<br>
recrystallization of the amorphous marks from the<br>
peripheral crystalline portion and at the same time,<br>
increases the crystal growth rate at the time of melting<br>
and resolidification. If the recrystallization speed<br>
from the periphery of the amorphous mark is increased<br>
above a certain level, recrystallization from the<br>
peripheral portion of the melted region proceeds at the<br>
time of resolidification of the melted region formed for<br>
amorphous mark recording. Accordingly, the region which<br>
is originally to be formed into an amorphous phase tends<br>
to be recrystallized without being formed into an<br>
amorphous phase. Accordingly, it is important to set the<br>
bias power Pb to be adequately low, or to adequately<br>
secure the cooling section by making ai=bi or ai=bi-1<br>
(2=i=m or m-1) .<br>
Further, if the linear velocity at the time of<br>
recording increases, the clock period is shortened,<br>
whereby the off-pulse section is shortened, and the<br>
cooling effect tends to be impaired. In such a case, it<br>
is effective to divide the recording pulse at the time of<br>
nT mark recording, to set the cooling section by the off-<br>
pulse to be at least 1 nsec, more preferably at least 5<br>
nsec by the real time.<br>
[2-2] Application of information recording medium of the<br>
present invention other than optical information<br>
recording medium<br>
The information recording medium of the present<br>
invention can be used as an optical information recording<br>
mediµm, since reversible phase-change recording at least<br>
by irradiation with laser beam is possible, as described<br>
above. However, the rewritable information recording<br>
medium used in the present invention can be applied, for<br>
example, to phase-change recording by applying an<br>
electric current to a microscopic region. Explanation<br>
will be made below with respect to this point.<br>
Fig. 3 is a schematic view illustrating the<br>
temperature history (curve a) at the time of amorphous<br>
mark recording, and the temperature history (curve b) at<br>
the time of erasing by recrystallization. At the time of<br>
recording, the temperature of the recording layer is<br>
increased to at least the melting point Tm in a short<br>
time by heating with an electric current at a high<br>
voltage and with a short pulse or a high power level<br>
laser beam, and after the electric current pulse or laser<br>
beam irradiation is turned off, the recording layer is<br>
rapidly cooled by heat dissipation to the periphery, and<br>
formed into an amorphous phase. When the cooling rate of<br>
the temperature at the time t0 from the melting point Tm<br>
to the crystallization temperature Tg is higher than the<br>
critical cooling rate for formation of an amorphous<br>
phase, the recording layer is formed into an amorphous<br>
phase. On the other hand, at the time of erasing, the<br>
recording layer is heated to at least the crystallization<br>
temperature Tg and at most about the melting point Tm, by<br>
application of a relatively low voltage or irradiation<br>
with a laser energy at a low power level, and maintained<br>
for at least a certain time, whereby recrystallization of<br>
the amorphous marks proceeds in a substantially solid<br>
phase state. Namely, if the holding time T1 is adequate,<br>
the crystallization will be completed.<br>
Here, regardless of the state of the recording layer<br>
before application of the energy for recording or<br>
erasing, the recording layer is formed into an amorphous<br>
phase when the temperature history of the curve a is<br>
imparted to the recording layer, and the recording layer<br>
is crystallized when the temperature history of the curve<br>
b is imparted to the recording layer.<br>
The reason why the rewritable information recording<br>
medium of the present invention may be used for phase-<br>
change recording by applying an electric current to the<br>
microscopic region, not only as an optical information<br>
recording mediµm, is as follows. Namely, it is the<br>
temperature history as shown in Fig. 3 that causes a<br>
reversible phase change, and the energy source which<br>
causes such a temperature history may be either a focused<br>
laser beam or an electric current heating (Joule heat by<br>
conducting).<br>
The change in the resistivity accompanying the phase<br>
change between the crystalline phase and the amorphous<br>
phase of the phase-change recording material used in the<br>
present invention, is adequately equal to the change in<br>
the resistivity by at least two orders of magnitude, as<br>
obtained by a GeTe-Sb2Te3 pseudo binary alloy which is<br>
being developed as a non-volatile memory at present,<br>
particularly a Ge2Sb2Te5 stoichiometrical composition<br>
alloy (J. Appl. Phys., vol. 87, pages 4130 to 4133,<br>
2000) . In fact, when the resistivity in an amorphous<br>
state in an as-deposited state, and the resistivity after<br>
crystallization by annealing, of a rewritable information<br>
recording medium using a phase-change recording material<br>
containing a composition represented by the above formula<br>
(1) as the main component, were respectively measured,<br>
whereupon changes by at least three orders of magnitude<br>
were confirmed. It is considered that the amorphous and<br>
crystalline states obtained by formation into an<br>
amorphous phase and the crystallization by current pulses<br>
are slightly different from the above amorphous state in<br>
an as-deposited state and the above crystalline state by<br>
annealing, respectively. However, it is expected that<br>
also in a case where the phase-change recording material<br>
used in the present invention is subjected to phase<br>
change by current pulses, a large change in the<br>
resistivity by a level of two orders of magnitude can<br>
adequately occur, since the above change in the<br>
resistivity by at least three orders of magnitude can be<br>
obtained.<br>
Fig. 4 is a cross-sectional view illustrating the<br>
structure of one cell of such a non-volatile memory. In<br>
Fig. 4, a voltage is applied between an upper electrode 1<br>
and a lower electrode 2, and an electric current is<br>
applied to a phase-change recording layer 3 containing a<br>
phase-change recording material (hereinafter sometimes<br>
referred to simply as a phase-change recording layer 3)<br>
and a heater portion 4. The phase-change recording layer<br>
3 is covered with an insulant 10 such as SiO2. Further,<br>
the phase-change recording layer 3 is crystallized in the<br>
initial state. In this case, initial crystallization is<br>
carried out by heating the entire system of Fig. 4 to the<br>
crystallization temperature (usually from about 100 to<br>
about 300°C) of the recording layer. In formation of an<br>
integrated circuit, the temperature increase to such an<br>
extent is commonly carried out.<br>
In Fig. 4, a particularly narrow portion 4 (heater<br>
portion) functions as a local heater, since heat is<br>
likely to generate by the Joule heat by application of an<br>
electric current between the upper electrode 1 and the<br>
lower electrode 2. A reversibly changeable portion 5<br>
adjacent thereto is locally heated and formed into an<br>
amorphous phase via the temperature history as shown by<br>
the curve a in Fig. 3, and recrystallized via the<br>
temperature history as shown by the curve b in Fig. 3.<br>
As the reading, a low electric current is applied to<br>
such an extent that the heat generation at the heater<br>
portion 4 can be ignored, and the voltage difference<br>
between the upper and lower electrodes is read. Here,<br>
there is also a difference in the electric capacity<br>
between the crystalline and amorphous states, and<br>
accordingly the difference in the electric capacity may<br>
be detected.<br>
Practically, a further integrated memory has been<br>
proposed by employing a semiconductor integrated circuit<br>
formation technology (U.S. Patent 6,314,014), however,<br>
its basic structure is as shown in Fig. 4, and when the<br>
phase-change recording material used in the present<br>
invention is incorporated in the phase-change recording<br>
layer 3, the same function can be realized.<br>
Here, as the energy source which causes the<br>
temperature change as shown in Fig. 3, an electron beam<br>
may also be mentioned. As an example of a recording<br>
device employing an electron beam, a method wherein a<br>
phase-change recording material is locally irradiated<br>
with an electron beam radiated by a field emitter to<br>
cause a phase change, as disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
5,557,59 6 may be mentioned.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above<br>
embodiments. The above embodiments are examples, and any<br>
one having substantially the same structure as the<br>
technical idea as disclosed in the scope of the present<br>
invention and having the same effects is included in the<br>
present invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Now, the present invention will be explained with<br>
reference to Examples wherein the phase-change recording<br>
material to be used in the present invention is applied<br>
to an optical information recording medium. However, the<br>
present invention is by no means restricted to the<br>
application to an optical information recording medium<br>
within a range not to exceed the gist of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In the following Examples, an optical information<br>
recording medium may be referred to simply as "a disk",<br>
"an optical disk", "a phase-change type optical disk"<br>
etc. in some cases.<br>
EXAMPLES 1 to 6 and COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 1 to 4<br>
For measurement of the composition of the phase-<br>
change recording material used for the recording layer of<br>
an optical information recording mediµm, an acid<br>
dissolution ICP-AES (Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic<br>
Emission Spectrometry) and a fluorescent X-ray analyzer<br>
were used. With respect to the acid dissolution ICP-AES,<br>
JY 38 S manufactured by JOBIN YVON was used as an<br>
analyzer, and the recording layer was dissolved in dil-<br>
HNO3 and quantitative determination was carried out by a<br>
matrix matching calibration method. As the fluorescent<br>
X-ray analyzer, RIX3001 manufactured by Rigaku Denki<br>
Kogyo K.K. was used.<br>
Measurement of the disk characteristics was carried<br>
out by means of DDU1000 manufactured by Pulstec.<br>
Industrial Co., Ltd., by applying focusing servo and<br>
tracking servo to the groove at a retrieving power of 0.8<br>
mW. This apparatus is an optical disk tester having a<br>
pickup with NA of 0.5 and a laser wavelength of 780 nm.<br>
On a disk-shape polycarbonate substrate having a<br>
diameter of 120 mm and a thickness of 1.2 mm, having<br>
guide grooves with a groove width of 0.5 µm, a groove<br>
depth of 40 nm and a groove ßiTch of 1.6 µm, first to<br>
fifth layers were formed in order by a sputtering method<br>
as follows. The first layer is a (ZnS)80(SiO2)20<br>
protective layer, the second layer is a Ge-In-Sb-Sn-Te<br>
recording layer, the third layer is a (ZnS)80(SiO2)20<br>
protective layer, the fourth layer is a Ta or GeN<br>
interfacial layer, and the fifth layer is a Ag reflective<br>
layer (200 nm) . The fourth layer is a thin interfacial<br>
layer to prevent diffusion of S into the Ag reflective<br>
layer, and there is substantially no difference in the<br>
disk characteristics whether Ta or GeN is employed. A<br>
protective layer comprising an ultraviolet-curing resin<br>
was further formed on these layers to prepare a phase-<br>
change type optical disk. The film thicknesses of the<br>
respective layers and the values x, y, z and w when the<br>
recording layer composition is represented by<br>
Gex(InwSn1-w)yTe2Sb1-x-y-z are shown in Table 2. For the<br>
fourth layer, GeN was employed only for the disks of<br>
Comparative Examples 2 and 3, and Ta was employed for the<br>
other disks. The respective disks have slightly<br>
different film thicknesses of the respective layers since<br>
the reflectivity, the signal amplitude, the recording<br>
sensitivity, the repeated recording durability etc. were<br>
adjusted, however, it is considered that the differences<br>
do not have significant influences over the experimental<br>
results. Further, other than the disks of Comparative<br>
Examples 1 and 4 on which the initial crystallization or<br>
erasure of the recording could not favorably be carried<br>
out, the recording layer composition was adjusted to<br>
obtain a crystallization speed suitable for the recording<br>
conditions as mentioned hereinafter.<br>
Initial crystallization was tried on each of these<br>
disks as follows.<br>
As a laser beam for initial crystallization, a laser<br>
beam having a wavelength of 810 nm and a power of 800 mW<br>
and having a shape with a width of about 1 mm and a<br>
length of about 7 5 mm was employed. While rotating the<br>
disk at 12 m/s, the disk was irradiated with the above<br>
laser beam so that the major axis of the laser beam was<br>
perpendicular to the guide grooves formed on the above<br>
substrate. Further, the laser beam was continuously<br>
moved in a radius direction of the disk with a feed<br>
amount of 50 mm per rotation of the disk to try initial<br>
crystallization.<br>
Uniform initial crystallization could be achieved on<br>
the disks other than the disk of Comparative Example 4.<br>
However, crystallization could not be achieved on the<br>
disk of Comparative Example 4 under the above conditions.<br>
Initial crystallization was tried similarly at a linear<br>
velocity of 2 m/s at a laser power of from 400 mW to 1000<br>
mW, however, no uniform crystalline state could be<br>
obtained. It is considered to be because the<br>
crystallization speed was too slow. Accordingly, it is<br>
considered that use of the disk of Comparative Example 4<br>
as a phase-change optical disk is substantially<br>
difficult.<br>
Although initial crystallization could be achieved<br>
on the disk of Comparative Example 1, the reflectivity<br>
was so low as about 11%. There was no change in the<br>
reflectivity even after recording and erasing were<br>
carried out about 10 times. When the value of y-z is<br>
small, the reflectivity and the signal amplitude are<br>
small, and the use as the phase-change optical disk is<br>
difficult. Also in a case where a part of or the entire<br>
Sn is replaced by In, the relation between the value y-z<br>
and the reflectivity shows the similar tendency.<br>
Each disk was subjected to an environment resistance<br>
test (accelerated test) of holding it in an environment<br>
of 105°C for 3 hours, and the crystalline state<br>
reflectivity was measured before and after the test. The<br>
accelerated test is considered to correspond to a long<br>
term storage of the medium. The results are shown in<br>
Table 2. The reflectivity tends to decrease by the<br>
accelerated test with respect to every disk, however, the<br>
degree of the decrease varies depend on the disks. It is<br>
found that the degree of the decrease in the reflectivity<br>
by the accelerated test is correlated with ((In content)<br>
-(Te content)) i.e. the value wxy-z. The rate of<br>
decrease in the reflectivity by the accelerated test<br>
(shown in the section "rate of decrease in reflectivity<br>
after accelerated test" in Table 2) is defined by<br>
((reflectivity before the accelerated test)-(reflectivity<br>
after the accelerated test))/(reflectivity before the<br>
accelerated test), and wxy-z is required to be at most<br>
about 0.1 if the rate of decrease is to be suppressed<br>
lower than about 0.15. Needless to say, the rate of<br>
decrease is preferably as low as possible.<br>
On each of the disks of Examples 1 to 6, before the<br>
above accelerated test was carried out, EFM random<br>
signals were recorded at a linear velocity of 28.8 m/s as<br>
mentioned hereinafter by means of the above optical disk<br>
tester, and then the above accelerated test was carried<br>
out, to measure the disk characteristics as mentioned<br>
hereinafter before and after the accelerated test. The<br>
pulse strategy, and the writing power Pw and the erasing<br>
power Pe were selected so that the jitter characteristics<br>
would be as good as possible on each disk.<br>
On each of the disks of Examples 1 to 5, recording<br>
was carried out as follows. Marks with lengths of from<br>

irradiation with an erasing power Pe was carried out, and<br>
Pb=0.8 mW. The writing power Pw and the erasing power Pe<br>
are shown in Table 2. Overwriting was carried out ten<br>
times.<br>
On the disk of Example 6, recording was carried out<br>
as follows. Marks with lengths of from 3T to 1it (T is a<br>
reference clock period and is 9.6 nsec) contained in the<br>

length 1.45T, a pulse with a power Pw and a length 1.4T,<br>
a pulse with a power Pb and a length 0.4T.<br>
Between the pulse rows for mark formation,<br>
irradiation with an erasing power Pe was carried out, and<br>
Pb=0.8 mW. The writing power Pw and the erasing power Pe<br>
are shown in Table 2. Further, the position of the<br>
irradiation with 3T mark formation pulses was shifted<br>
forward (the irradiation time was adversed from the<br>
original) by 0.2T from the original starting position of<br>
the 3T mark length signal in the EFM random signal, and<br>
the position of irradiation with 4T mark formation pulses<br>
was shifted forward by 0.05T from the original starting<br>
position of the 4T mark length signal in the EFM random<br>
signal. By doing this, the marks to be formed are close<br>
to the original random signals. Overwriting was carried<br>
out ten times.<br>
The recorded portion of each disk was retrieved at a<br>
linear velocity of 1.2 m/s to evaluate the<br>
characteristics of the recording signals. The evaluated<br>
items were the jitter of 3T spaces and the crystalline<br>
state reflectivity. The results are shown in Table 2.<br>
As the jitter of 3T spaces, a value of at most 40 ns<br>
could be obtained, and this characteristic is good enough<br>
for practical application. Particularly, with the disks<br>
of Examples 1 to 5, a value of at most 3 0 ns could be<br>
obtained, such being favorable. The disk of Example 6 is<br>
slightly poor in the jitter characteristics, and this is<br>
considered to be because the Sn content is high.<br>
Each of the disks was subjected to the above<br>
accelerated test, and then the portion recorded before<br>
the accelerated test was retrieved to measure the jitter<br>
of 3T spaces again. The results are shown in Table 2.<br>
On every disk, as the jitter of 3T spaces, a value of at<br>
most 40 ns could be obtained, and this characteristic is<br>
good enough for practical application. Particularly, on<br>
the disks of Examples 1, 2, 4 and 5, a value of at most<br>
3 0 ns could be obtained, such being favorable. On these<br>
disks, the amorphous marks are adequately stable. On the<br>
disk of Example 3, deterioration of the jitter value by<br>
the accelerated test was slightly observed. In the<br>
waveform observation by an oscilloscope, it is considered<br>
that crystallization of the 3T mark was in progress. The<br>
amorphous marks are particularly stable when Ge is<br>
contained.<br>
Then, an operation to erase the signals recorded<br>
before the accelerated test, was carried out after the<br>
accelerated test, and whether or not insufficiently<br>
erased marks are present, was confirmed by observation by<br>
oscilloscope. In a case where unerased marks are shown,<br>
there is a fear that the signal quality when overwriting<br>
is carried out after the recorded medium is stored for a<br>
long term, may not be adequately excellent. The erasure<br>
operation is to irradiate each disk with a DC light with<br>
an erasing power Pe as shown in Table 2 once. As a<br>
result, on the disks of Examples 4 and 5, unerased marks<br>
were observed, whereas on the disks of Examples 1, 2 and<br>
3, favorable erasure condition was observed. it is<br>
considered that the excellent erasure is achieved since<br>
the Ge content is low.<br>
The recorded portion of a disk substantially the<br>
same as that of Example 4 was observed by a transmission<br>
electron microscope (TEM), whereupon it was confirmed<br>
that amorphous state marks were recorded in the<br>
crystalline state. Accordingly, it is thought that<br>
amorphous state marks are recorded in the crystalline<br>
state on the disks of all Examples on which recording was<br>
carried out.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 5<br>
A disk of Comparative Example 5 was prepared as<br>
follows.<br>
On a disk-shape polycarbonate substrate having a<br>
diameter of 120 mm and a thickness of 1.2 mm and having<br>
guide grooves with a groove width of 0.5 µm, a groove<br>
depth of 40 nm and a groove ßitch of 1.6 µm, first to<br>
fifth layers were formed in order by a sputtering method<br>
as follows. The first layer is a (ZnS)80(SiO2)20<br>
protective layer, the second layer is a recording layer,<br>
the third layer is a (ZnS)80(SiO2)20 protective layer, the<br>
fourth layer is a GeN interfacial layer, and the fifth<br>
layer is a Ag reflective layer. A protective layer<br>
comprising an ultraviolet-curing resin was further formed<br>
on these layers to prepare a phase-change type optical<br>
disk. The film thicknesses of the respective layers and<br>
the values x, y, z and w when the recording layer<br>
composition is represented by Gex(InwSn1-w)yTezSb1-x-y-z are<br>
shown in Table 2. Then, initial crystallization under<br>
the same conditions as in Example 1 was carried out.<br>
By means of a disk tester having a pickup with NA of<br>
0.5 and a laser wavelength of 780 ran, of the disk of<br>
Example 1 and the disk of Comparative Example: 5, the<br>
repeated overwriting durability was measured.<br>
The conditions for evaluation of the repeated<br>
overwriting durability are as follows.<br>
Namely, EFM random signals were recorded on each<br>
disk at a recording linear velocity of 28.8 m/s. The<br>
recording pulses employed for recording were the same as<br>
in Example 1, the writing power Pw was 33 mW, and the<br>
erasing power Pe was 9 mW.<br>
Retrieving was carried out at a linear velocity of<br>
1.2 m/s. The jitter of 3T spaces after overwriting ten<br>
times was 25.6 ns with respect to the disk of Example 1<br>
and 27.1 ns with respect to the disk of Comparative<br>
Example 5. The jitter of 3T spaces after overwriting<br>
2000 times was 32.1 ns with respect to the disk of<br>
Example 1 and 58.4 ns with respect to the disk of<br>
Comparative Example 5, and the disk of Comparative<br>
Example 5 was poor in the repeated recording durability.<br>
The main cause of the jitter deterioration of the<br>
disk of Comparative Example 5 is considered to be a<br>
decrease in the crystallization speed due to the repeated<br>
overwriting, thus leading to incomplete erasure of the<br>
marks. On the other hand, of the disk of Example 1<br>
containing Te, the decrease in the crystallization speed<br>
due to the repeated recording was suppressed.<br>
REFERENCE EXAMPLE 1<br>
A disk of Reference Example 1 was prepared as<br>
follows.<br>
On a disk-shape polycarbonate substrate having a<br>
diameter of 120 mm and a thickness of 1.2 mm and having<br>
guide grooves with a groove width of 0.5 µm, a groove<br>
depth of 40 nm and a groove pitch of 1.6 µm, first to<br>
fifth layers were formed in order by a sputtering method<br>
as follows. The first layer is a (ZnS)80(SiO2)20<br>
protective layer, the second layer is a recording layer,<br>
the third layer is a (ZnS) 80 (SiO2)20 protective layer, the<br>
fourth layer is a Ta interfacial layer, and the fifth<br>
layer is a Ag reflective layer. A protective layer<br>
comprising an ultraviolet-curing resin was further formed<br>
on these layers to prepare a phase-change type optical<br>
disk. The film thicknesses of the respective layers and<br>
the values x, y, z and w when the recording layer<br>
composition is represented by Gex(InwSn1-w)yTezSb1-x-y-z are<br>
shown in Table 2. Then, initial crystallization was<br>
carried out under the same conditions as in Example 1.<br>
The disk of Reference Example 1 was subjected to an<br>
environment resistance test (accelerated test) of holding<br>
it in an environment of 10 5°C for 3 hours, and the<br>
crystalline state reflectivity was measured before and<br>
after the test. The crystalline state reflectivities<br>
before and after the accelerated test were 27.8% and<br>
23.4%, respectively. When the rate of decrease in the<br>
reflectivity by the accelerated test is defined as<br>
((reflectivity before the accelerated test)-(reflectivity<br>
after the accelerated test))/(reflectivity before the<br>
accelerated test), the rate of decrease was 0.158.<br>
A graph obtained by plotting the rate of decrease in<br>
the reflectivity after the accelerated test (a value<br>
defined by ((reflectivity before the accelerated test)-<br>
(reflectivity after the accelerated test))/(reflectivity<br>
before the accelerated test) and is a data shown in "rate<br>
of decrease in reflectivity after accelerated test" in<br>
Table 2) relative to the (In-Te) amount of the disks of<br>
Examples 1 to 6, Comparative Examples 2 and 3 and<br>
Reference Example 1, is shown in Fig. 7. it can be seen<br>
from Fig. 7 that the decrease in the reflectivity when<br>
accelerated is suppressed to be within 0.15 (15%) when<br>
In-Te
EXAMPLES 7 to 12 and COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 6<br>
A polycarbonate resin substrate having a thickness<br>
of 0.6 mm and a track pitch of 0.74 mm was formed by<br>
injection molding and employed for the following<br>
experimental examples. Of the grooves formed on the<br>
substrate, the groove width was about 0.31 mm and the<br>
groove depth was about 28 nm. The groove shape was<br>
obtained by an optical diffraction method of U-groove<br>
approximation by means of a He-Cd laser beam having a<br>
wavelength of 441.6 nm.<br>
Then, on the substrate, a (ZnS)80(SiO2)20 protective<br>
layer of 65 nm, a Y2O2S layer of 2 nm, a Ge7In6Sb56Sn24Te7<br>
recording layer of 12 nm, a Y2O2S layer of 2 nm, a<br>
(ZnS)80(Si02)20 protective layer of 12 nm, a Ta<br>
interfacial layer of 2 nm, a Ag reflective layer of 200<br>
nm and an ultraviolet-curing resin layer of about 4 nm<br>
were formed in this order. The Ta layer is an<br>
interfacial layer to prevent diffusion of S into the Ag<br>
reflective layer.<br>
Formation of the respective layers was carried out<br>
by sequential deposition by a sputtering method on the<br>
above substrate without breaking the vacuum. However,<br>
the ultraviolet-curing resin layer was coated by a spin<br>
coating method. Then, a similar substrate having a<br>
thickness of 0.6 mm on which no film was formed was<br>
bonded by means of an adhesive so that the above<br>
recording layer side faced the inside (Example 7).<br>
Similarly, on the above substrate, a (ZnS)80(SiO2)20<br>
protective layer of 60 nm, a Y2O2S layer of 2 nm, a<br>
Ge7ln6Sb56Sn24Te7 recording layer of 12 nm, a Y2O2S layer of<br>
14 nm, a Ta interfacial layer of 2 nm, a Ag reflective<br>
layer of 200 nm and an ultraviolet-curing resin layer of<br>
about 4 mm were formed in this order. The Ta layer is an<br>
interfacial layer to prevent diffusion of S into the Ag<br>
reflective layer.<br>
Formation of the respective layers was carried out<br>
by sequential deposition by a sputtering method on the<br>
above substrate without breaking the vacuum. However,<br>
the ultraviolet-curing resin layer was coated by a spin<br>
coating method. Then, a similar substrate having a<br>
thickness of 0.6 mm on which no film was formed was<br>
bonded by means of an adhesive so that the above<br>
recording layer side faced inside (Example 8).<br>
Similarly, on the above substrate, a (ZnS) 8o (SiO2) 20<br>
protective layer of 7 0 nm, a Ge7In6Sb56Sn24Te7 recording<br>
layer of 13 nm, a (ZnS)80(SiO2) 20 protective layer of 14<br>
nm, a Ta interfacial layer of 2 nm, a Ag reflective layer<br>
of 200 nm and an ultraviolet-curing resin layer of about<br>
4 mm were formed in this order. The Ta layer is an<br>
interfacial layer to prevent diffusion of S into the Ag<br>
reflective layer.<br>
Formation of the respective layers was carried out<br>
by sequential deposition by a sputtering method on the<br>
above substrate without breaking the vacuum. However,<br>
the ultraviolet-curing resin layer was coated by a spin<br>
coating method. Then, a similar substrate having a<br>
thickness of 0.6 mm on which no film was formed was<br>
bonded by means of an adhesive so that the above<br>
recording layer side faced inside (Example 9).<br>
Similarly, a disk employing a GeN layer instead of<br>
the Y2O2S layer in Example 7 was prepared (Example 10).<br>
Similarly, a disk employing a ZnO layer instead of<br>
the Y2O2S layer in Example 7 was prepared (Example 11).<br>
Similarly, a disk employing a (ZnS)80 (CeC)20 layer<br>
instead of the Y2O2S layer in Example 7 was prepared<br>
(Example 12).<br>
Similarly, a disk employing a Ge5Sb72Te23 layer<br>
instead of the Ge7In6Sb56Sn24Te7 layer in Example 7 was<br>
prepared (Comparative Example 6).<br>
With respect to the thickness of each layer, the<br>
deposition rate was estimated, and then the thickness was<br>
controlled by the sputtering time. The composition of<br>
the recording layer was determined by correcting the<br>
fluorescent intensities of the respective elements<br>
obtained by a fluorescent X-ray analysis by the absolute<br>
composition separately obtained by a chemical analysis<br>
(atomic absorption spectrometry).<br>
Then, initial crystallization was carried out. As<br>
the laser beam for the initial crystallization, a laser<br>
beam having a wavelength of 810 ran and focused into an<br>
oval shape having a major axis of about 7 5 urn and a minor<br>
axis of about 1 mm was employed. While rotating the<br>
disk, the disk was irradiated with the above laser beam<br>
so that the major axis of the laser beam would be<br>
perpendicular to the guide grooves formed on the above<br>
substrate, and the above laser beam was continuously<br>
moved in a radius direction of the disk with a feed<br>
amount of 50 mm per rotation of the disk to carry out<br>
initial crystallization.<br>
For the disks of Examples 7 and 9 to 12, the linear<br>
velocity was 30 m/s and the laser power was 1500 mW, for<br>
the disk of Example 8, the linear velocity was 30 m/s and<br>
the laser power was 1800 mW, and for the disk of<br>
Comparative Example 6, the linear velocity was 3 m/s and<br>
the laser power was 500 mW.<br>
Recording/retrieving evaluation was carried out by<br>
means of DDU1000 tester manufactured by Pulstec.<br>
Industrial Co., Ltd. (wavelength: about 650 nm, NA=0.65,<br>
spot shape: a circular of about 0.86 mm with an<br>
intensity of 1/e2) . On the basis of the reference linear<br>
velocity of 3.49 m/s of DVD being 1-time velocity,<br>
recording characteristics at 10-times velocity were<br>
evaluated.<br>
The reference clock period of data at each linear<br>
velocity was one inversely proportionated at each linear<br>
velocity against the reference clock period of 3 8.2 nsec<br>
of data at 1-time velocity.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, retrieving was carried<br>
out at 1-time velocity. The output signal from DDU1000<br>
was passed through a high frequency-passing filter having<br>
a cutoff lies between 5 and 20 kHz, whereupon the jitter<br>
was measured by a time interval analyzer (manufactured by<br>
Yokogawa Electric Corporation). The retrieving power Pr<br>
was 0.6 mW.<br>
Formation of a logic level to control the recording<br>
pulse division method was carried out by means of an<br>
optional signal generator (AWG710, manufactured by Sony<br>
Tektronix Co.). From the above signal generator, logic<br>
signals at ECL level were input as gate signals against a<br>
laser driver of the above tester.<br>
EFM+ random data were overwritten 2000 times at a<br>
linear velocity of 10-times velocity on each of the disks<br>
of Examples 7 to 12, and the data to clock jitter<br>
(hereinafter one normalized by the reference clock period<br>
T and represented by a % value will be simply referred to<br>
as jitter) of the recorded data was measured.<br>
The pulse rows for the respective mark length<br>
recording were set as follows. The laser irradiation<br>
time for recording a nT mark was divided in the order of<br>
a1T, ß1T, a2T, (a2T, ..., aiT, ßiT,..., amT bmT(m is the<br>
pulse division number and T is the reference clock<br>
period), and in the time at ait(l=i=m), irradiation with<br>
a recording laser beam with a writing power Pw was<br>
carried out, and in the time at biT (l=i=m), irradiation<br>
with a recording laser beam with a bias power Pb was<br>
carried out. These values were selected so that<br>
favorable jitter value would be obtained on each disk,<br>
and they were as shown in Table 3 on the disks of<br>
Examples 7 and 9 to 12, and they were as shown in Table 4<br>
on the disk of Example 8. for marks of some lengths, the<br>
timing of irradiation with the pulse row was delayed for<br>
a certain time from the original starting time of said<br>
mark length in the EFM+ signal, and this time was shown<br>
in the section "delay time". A case where the<br>
irradiation timing was delayed was represented by + and a<br>
case where it was advanced was represented by -. The<br>
value was normalized by the clock period T. The mark<br>
formed by providing the delay time is close to the ideal<br>
EFM+ random signal, and the jitter is excellent. At the<br>
space between marks (the portion other than the portion<br>
as disclosed in Table), irradiation with an erasing power<br>
Pe was carried out. For the disks of Examples 7 and 10<br>
to 12, Pw was 23 mW, Pb was 0.5 mW and Pe was 6.6 mW.<br>
For the disk of Example 8, Pw was 28 mW, Pb was 0.5 mW<br>
and Pe was 8 mW. For the disk of Example 9, Pw was 23<br>
mW, Pb was 0.5 mW and Pe was 6.2 mW. As the laser power,<br>
values which were considered to be optimum for the<br>
respective disks were selected.<br>
The results of the repeated durability test of the<br>
disks of Examples 7 to 10 are shown in Fig. 8. In Fig.<br>
8, the horizontal axis illustrates the number of<br>
overwriting cycle. Actually, the first recording is<br>
recording on a disk in a non-recorded initial crystalline<br>
state, and the second and the subsequent recordings are<br>
overwriting (hereinafter the same applies in Figs. 9, 10<br>
and 12) . In each Example, deterioration of the jitter is<br>
at most about 2% up to 1000 times, such being excellent.<br>
Of the disk of Example 9, the jitter value increased to<br>
12.5% by overwriting 2000 times, however, of the disks of<br>
Examples 7 and 8, the jitter value was at most 10%, and<br>
deterioration by repeated recording was slight. Namely,<br>
when Y2O2S is provided in contact with the Ge-In-Sb-Sn-Te<br>
type recording layer, the repeated recording durability<br>
tends to be significantly improved. Of the disk of<br>
Example 10 also, the jitter value after overwriting 2 0 00<br>
times was at most 10%, and the repeated recording<br>
durability was improved. On the other hand, the disks of<br>
Examples 11 and 12, which are not shown in Fig. 8, were<br>
inferior in the repeated recording durability to the disk<br>
of Example 9, however, they are stable during overwriting<br>
at least about several hundred times and are adequately<br>
practical. Further, it is possible to stabilize the<br>
jitter at least 1000 times by further optimizing the<br>
protective layer or the layer structure on these disks.<br>
Then, the signal amplitude after overwriting 10<br>
times of each of the disks of Examples 7 and 10 was<br>
measured. In either case, Pw was 23 mW, Pb was 0.5 mW<br>
and Pe was 6.6 mW. When the signal amplitude was defined<br>
as ((reflectivity at the space between marks)-<br>
(reflectivity at the 14T mark portion)), the values of<br>
the signal amplitude were 0.151 and 0.144 in Examples 7<br>
and 10, respectively, and there was a difference.<br>
Namely, it is found that the signal amplitude is high and<br>
is excellent when Y2O2S is employed than when GeN is<br>
employed, for the Ge-In-Sb-Sn-Te type recording layer.<br>
These values are obtained as a result of<br>
recording/retrieving with an optimum angle between the<br>
laser head and the disk. it is considered that the<br>
difference in the signal amplitude has a significant<br>
influence over the signal quality e.g. at the time of<br>
recording under severer conditions.<br>
Then, each of the disks of Examples 7 and 8 was<br>
subjected to an environment resistance test of holding it<br>
in an environment of 100°C for 1 hour (hereinafter<br>
referred to as environment resistance test 1). The<br>
results of measurement of the repeated recording<br>
durability before and after the environment resistance<br>
test 1 are shown in Figs. 9 and 10. "Archival" in Figs.<br>
9 and 10 represents the result when signals repeatedly<br>
 recorded predetermined times in a repeated recording<br>
durability test before the environment resistance test 1,<br>
were only retrieved after the environment resistance test<br>
1. it can be seen in the disks of Examples 7 and 8, that<br>
there was no problem in the stability of the amorphous<br>
mark and the archival change of the repeated recording<br>
durability.<br>
The disks of Examples 7 and 8 and Comparative<br>
Example 6 were subjected to an environment resistance<br>
test of holding them in an environment at a temperature<br>
of 80°C at a humidity of 85%RH for 90 hours (hereinafter<br>
referred to as environment resistance test 2). No film<br>
peeling occurred on the disks of Examples 7 and 8,<br>
however, film peeling was observed on the disk of<br>
Comparative Example 6. With respect to the disk of<br>
Comparative Example 6, particularly when the portion<br>
irradiated with the laser beam was observed by an<br>
oscilloscope after the environment resistance test 2,<br>
there observed a large number of portions where the<br>
reflectivity decreased, the cause of which was considered<br>
to be due to film peeling. Specifically, when<br>
irradiation with a DC laser beam of 8 mW was carried out<br>
at a linear velocity of 4-times velocity, a large number<br>
of portions at which the reflectivity decreased appeared.<br>
Such did not occur on the disks of Examples 7 and 8 at<br>
all. Namely, in a case where Y2O2S was provided in<br>
contact with a conventional SbTe eutectic type<br>
composition material, there is a problem in the adhesion<br>
properties between layers in some cases, however, in a<br>
case where Y2O2S is provided in contact with the Ge-In-<br>
Sb-Sn-Te type material, there is no problem in the<br>
adhesion properties between the layers. The disk of<br>
Example 8 was subjected to an environment resistance test<br>
at the same temperature and humidity as the environment<br>
resistance test 2 up to 250 hours, and no problem such as<br>
film peeling occurred. Then, the same measurement as in<br>
the above environment resistance test 1 was carried out<br>
with respect to the disk of Example 8, whereupon there<br>
was substantially no difference as compared with the case<br>
of the environment resistance test 1.<br>
EXAMPLES 13 and 14<br>
A polycarbonate resin substrate having a thickness<br>
of 0.6 mm and a track pitch of 0.74 mm was formed by<br>
injection molding and employed for the following<br>
experimental examples. Of the groove formed on the<br>
substrate, the groove width was about 0.31 µm, and the<br>
groove depth was about 2 8 nm. The groove shape was<br>
obtained by an optical diffraction method by U-groove<br>
approximation by means of a He-Cd laser beam having a<br>
wavelength of 441.6 nm.<br>
Then, on the substrate, a (ZnS)80(SiO2)20 protective<br>
layer of 40 nm, a (Y2O2S)90(ZnO) 10 layer of 2 nm, a<br>
Ge7In6Sb56Sn24Te7 recording layer of 10 nm, a<br>
(Y2O2S)90(ZnO)10 layer of 14 nm, a Ta interfacial layer of<br>
2 nm, a Ag reflective layer of 200 nm and an ultraviolet-<br>
curing resin layer of about 4 mm were formed in this<br>
order. The Ta layer is an interfacial layer to prevent<br>
diffusion of S into the Ag reflective layer.<br>
Formation of the respective layers was carried out<br>
by sequential deposition by a sputtering method on the<br>
substrate without breaking the vacuum. However, the<br>
ultraviolet-curing resin layer was coated by a spin<br>
coating method. Then, a similar substrate having a<br>
thickness of 0.6 mm on which no film was formed was<br>
bonded by means of an adhesive so that the above<br>
recording layer side faced inside (Example 13).<br>
Similarly, on the above substrate, a (ZnS)80(SiO2)20<br>
protective layer of 60 nm, a (Y2O2S)90(ZnO)10 layer of 2<br>
nm, a Ge7In6Sb56Sn24Te7 recording layer of 12 nm, a<br>
(Y2O2S)90(ZnO)10 layer of 14 nm, a Ta interfacial layer of<br>
2 nm, a Ag reflective layer of 200 nm and an ultraviolet-<br>
curing resin layer of about 4 mm were formed in this<br>
order. Then, a similar substrate having a thickness of<br>
0.6 mm on which no film was formed was bonded by means of<br>
an adhesive so that the recording layer side faced inside<br>
(Example 14).<br>
With respect to the film thickness of each layer,<br>
the deposition rate was measured, and then the thickness<br>
was controlled by the sputtering time. The composition<br>
of the recording layer was determined by correcting the<br>
fluorescent intensities of the respective elements<br>
obtained by a fluorescent X-ray analysis by the absolute<br>
composition separately obtained by a chemical analysis<br>
(atomic absorption spectrometry).<br>
Then, initial crystallization was carried out. As<br>
the laser beam for the initial crystallization, a laser<br>
beam having a wavelength of 810 nm and a power of 1800 mW<br>
and focused into an oval shape having a major axis of<br>
about 7 5 urn and a minor axis of about 1 mm was employed.<br>
While rotating the disk at 30 m/s, the disk was<br>
irradiated with the above laser beam so that the major<br>
axis of the laser beam would be perpendicular to the<br>
guide grooves formed on the above substrate, and the<br>
above laser beam was continuously moved in a radius<br>
direction of the disk with a feed amount of 50 mm per<br>
rotation of the disk to carry out initial<br>
crystallization.<br>
Recording/retrieving evaluation was carried out by<br>
means of DDU1000 tester manufactured by Pulstec.<br>
Industrial Co., Ltd. (wavelength: about 650 nm, NA=0.65,<br>
spot shape: a circular of 0.86 mm with an intensity of<br>
1/e2) . On the basis of the reference linear velocity of<br>
3.49 m/s of DVD being 1-time velocity, recording<br>
characteristics at 10-times velocity were evaluated.<br>
The reference clock period of data at each linear<br>
velocity was one inversely proportionated at each linear<br>
velocity to the reference clock period of 38.2 nsec of<br>
data at 1-time velocity.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, retrieving was carried<br>
out at 1-time velocity. The output signal from DDU1000<br>
was passed through a high frequency-passing filter having<br>
a cutoff lies between 5 and 20 kHz, whereupon the jitter<br>
was measured by a time interval analyzer (manufactured by<br>
Yokogawa Electric Corporation). The retrieving power Pr<br>
was 0.6 mW.<br>
Formation of a logic level to control the recording<br>
pulse division method was carried out by means of an<br>
optional signal generator (AWG710, manufactured by Sony<br>
Tektronix Co.). From the above signal generator, logic<br>
signals at ECL level were input as gate signals against a<br>
laser driver of the above tester.<br>
Each of the disks of Examples 13 and 14 was<br>
subjected to an environment resistance test 1 of holding<br>
it in an environment of 100°C for 1 hour to measure the<br>
recording characteristics before and after the<br>
environment resistance test 1. EFM+ random data were<br>
recorded at a linear velocity of 10-times velocity, and<br>
the jitter etc. of the recorded data was measured.<br>
The pulse rows for the respective mark length<br>
recording were set as follows. The light irradiation<br>
time to record the nT mark was divided in order of a1T,<br>
ß1T, a2T, b2T,..., a1T, b1T, ..., amT, bmT (m is the pulse<br>
division number and T is the reference clock period),<br>
irradiation with a recording laser beam with a writing<br>
power Pw was carried out at the time of ait (1=i=m), and<br>
irradiation with a recording laser beam with a bias power<br>
Pb was carried out at the time of biT (1=i=m) . These<br>
values were set as shown in Table 5. For marks of some<br>
lengths, the timing of irradiation with the pulse row was<br>
delayed for a certain time from the original starting<br>
time of said mark length in the EFM+ signal, and this<br>
time is shown in the section "delay time". A case where<br>
the irradiation timing was delayed was represented by +,<br>
and a case where it was advanced was represented by -.<br>
The value was normalized by the clock period T. The mark<br>
formed by providing the delay time is close to the ideal<br>
EFM+ random signal, and the jitter is excellent. At the<br>
space between marks (the portion other than the portion<br>
shown in Table), irradiation with an erasing power Pe was<br>
carried out.<br>
The jitter characteristics when overwriting was<br>
carried out twice after the above environment resistant<br>
test 1, were measured by changing the writing power Pw.<br>
Pb was set to 0.5 mW, and Pe was set to 8 mW. The<br>
results are shown in Fig. 11. On the disk of Example 13,<br>
there is a power with which the jitter was at most 10%,<br>
however, on the disk of Example 14, the jitter would not<br>
be at most 10%. By overwriting up to about 1000 times<br>
before and after the environment resistance test 1, the<br>
jitter most deteriorates at the second recording (shelf<br>
second recording) in the repeated overwriting test after<br>
the environment resistance test 1, and the jitter once<br>
decreases when the overwriting is carried out repeatedly<br>
(Fig. 12 as disclosed hereinafter), and accordingly it is<br>
preferred that the jitter after the second recording is<br>
suppressed low. Accordingly, it can be said that the<br>
disk of Example 13 has a further higher performance than<br>
the disk of Example 14.<br>
Further, with respect to the disk of Example 13,<br>
when overwriting was carried out after the environment<br>
resistance test 1 on the signals recorded before the<br>
environment resistance test 1, the deterioration of the<br>
jitter at the first overwriting (archival second<br>
recording) was similarly suppressed low. it can be said<br>
j that such a disk has a high reliability particularly for<br>
long term use.<br>
Further, the signal intensities of the disks of<br>
Examples 13 and 14 after overwriting ten times before the<br>
environment resistance test 1 were compared. At Pw of 28<br>
mW, Pe of 8 mW and Pb of 0.5 mW, the signal amplitudes<br>
i.e. ((reflectivity between marks)-(reflectivity at mark<br>
portion)) were 0.161 in Example 13 and 0.161 in Example<br>
14, and were the same. The signal intensity becomes low<br>
only by making the recording layer thin, however, by<br>
making the recording layer thin at the same time by<br>
making the incident side protective layer thin, the<br>
recording characteristics after the environment<br>
resistance test 1 could be improved without reducing the<br>
signal intensity.<br>
Further, the repeated recording durability up to<br>
2000 times of the disk of Example 13 at Pw of 28 mW, Pe<br>
of 8 mW and Pb of 0.5 mW is shown in Fig. 12. The jitter<br>
is at most 10% at every overwriting cycle, and it is<br>
found that high reliability in the repeated overwriting<br>
in a long term use can be obtained. Further, the portion<br>
once recorded before the environment resistance test 1<br>
was retrieved after the environment resistance test 1,<br>
whereupon the jitter was 7% and was not deteriorated at<br>
all. Namely, the storage stability of the amorphous mark<br>
is also sufficient.<br>
Then, the reflectivity at a portion on which<br>
overwriting was carried out ten times before the above<br>
environment resistance test 1 was measured before and<br>
after the environment resistance test 1. As a result,<br>
with respect to the disk of Example 13, the<br>
reflectivities were 0.234 and 0.229, respectively. On<br>
the other hand, with respect to the disk of Example 14,<br>
the reflectivities were 0.246 and 0.234, respectively.<br>
When the rate of decrease in the reflectivity by the<br>
environment resistance test 1 is defined as<br>
((reflectivity before the environment resistance test 1)-<br>
(reflectivity after the environment resistance test<br>
1))/(reflectivity before the environment resistance test<br>
1), the rate of decrease in the reflectivity was about<br>
0.021 in Example 13 or about 0.049 in Example 14, and the<br>
rate of decrease in the reflectivity was lower in Example<br>
13. Namely, it is found that the rate of decrease in the<br>
reflectivity by the environment resistance test 1 becomes<br>
low by making the recording layer thin.<br>
EXAMPLE 15<br>
The following experiment was carried out to show<br>
possibility of recording by a change in the electric<br>
resistance on the phase-change recording material used in<br>
the present invention.<br>
Namely, on a polycarbonate substrate having a<br>
diameter of 120 mm, an amorphous film of Ge-In-Sn-Te-Sb<br>
(Gex(InwSn1-w)yTezSb1-x-y-z wherein w=0.189, x=0.056, y=0.301<br>
and z=0.073) having a film thickness of 50 nm was<br>
prepared by sputtering.<br>
The resistivity of the above amorphous film was<br>
measured, and the amorphous film was crystallized to<br>
measure the resistivity of the film after the<br>
crystallization.<br>
For initial crystallization, a laser beam having a<br>
wavelength of 810 nm and a power of 1040 mW and having a<br>
shape with a width of about 1 mm and a length of about 75<br>
mm was employed. While rotating the Ge-In-Sn-Te-Sb<br>
amorphous film formed on the above substrate at a linear<br>
velocity of 12 m/s, the above amorphous film was<br>
irradiated with the above laser beam so that the major<br>
axis of the above laser beam would be perpendicular to<br>
the guide grooves formed on the above substrate.<br>
Further, the above laser beam was continuously moved in a<br>
radius direction with a feed amount of 50 mm per one<br>
rotation to carry out initial crystallization.<br>
For measurement of the resistivity, a resistivity<br>
measurement device Loresta MP (MCP-T3 50) manufactured by<br>
Dia Instruments Co., Ltd. was used.<br>
The resistivity before the crystallization was<br>
1.36X10-1 ?cm. The resistivity after the crystallization<br>
was 0.95xl0~4 Qcm. From this result, it was found that<br>
there is a change in the resistivity by almost three<br>
orders of magnitude between the amorphous state and the<br>
crystalline state. Accordingly, it was found that the<br>
phase-change recording material used in the present<br>
invention provides a large difference in the resistivity<br>
by phase change between the amorphous state and the<br>
crystalline state, and is applicable to a rewritable type<br>
information recording medium on which recording is<br>
carried out by the change in the electric resistance.<br>
EXAMPLE 16<br>
A polycarbonate resin substrate having a thickness<br>
of 0.6 mm and a track pitch of 0.74 urn was formed by<br>
injection molding and employed for the following<br>
experiment example. Of the grooves formed on the<br>
substrate, the groove width was about 0.31 mm and the<br>
groove depth was about 28 nm. The groove shape was<br>
obtained by an optical diffraction method by U-groove<br>
approximation by means of a He-Cd laser beam having a<br>
wavelength of 441.6 nm.<br>
Then, on the substrate, a (ZnS)80(SiO2)20 protective<br>
layer of 65 nm, a Y2O2S layer of 2 nm, a<br>
Ge5In8.5Sb52Sn24Te10.5 recording layer of 15 nm, a Y2O2S<br>
layer of 17 nm, a Mo interfacial layer of 2 nm, a Ag<br>
reflective layer of 200 nm and an ultraviolet-curing<br>
resin layer of about 4 pa were formed in this order. The<br>
Mo layer is an interfacial layer to prevent diffusion of<br>
S into the Ag reflective layer.<br>
Formation of the respective layers was carried out<br>
by sequential deposition by a sputtering method without<br>
breaking the vacuum. However, the ultraviolet-curing<br>
resin layer was coated by a spin coating method. Then, a<br>
similar substrate having a thickness of 0.6 mm on which<br>
no film was deposited was bonded by means of an adhesive<br>
so that the above recording layer side faced inside.<br>
With respect to the thickness of each layer, the<br>
deposition rate was measured, and then the thickness was<br>
controlled by the sputtering time. The recording layer<br>
composition was the composition of the sputtering target.<br>
Then, initial crystallization was carried out. As<br>
the laser beam for the initial crystallization, a laser<br>
beam having a wavelength of 810 nm and a power of 1200 mW<br>
and focused into an oval shape having a major axis of<br>
about 75 mm and a minor axis of about 1 urn was employed.<br>
While rotating the disk at 16 m/s, the disk was<br>
irradiated with the above laser beam so that the major<br>
axis of the laser beam would be perpendicular to the<br>
guide grooves formed on the above substrate:, and the<br>
above laser beam was continuously moved in a radius<br>
direction of the disk with a feed amount of 50 mm per one<br>
rotation of the disk to carry out the initial<br>
crystallization.<br>
Recording/retrieving evaluation was carried out by<br>
means of ODU-1000 tester manufactured by Pulstec.<br>
Industrial Co., Ltd. (wavelength: about 650 nm, NA=0.65,<br>
spot shape: a circular of 0.86 mm with an intensity of<br>
1/e2) . On the basis of the reference linear velocity of<br>
3.49 m/s of DVD being 1-time velocity, recording<br>
characteristics at 8-times velocity were evaluated.<br>
The reference clock period of data at each linear<br>
velocity was one inversely proportionated at each linear<br>
velocity to the reference clock period of 38.2 nsec of<br>
data at 1-time velocity.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, retrieving was carried<br>
out at 1-time velocity. The output signal from ODU-1000<br>
was passed through a high frequency-passing filter having<br>
a cutoff lies between 5 to 2 0 kHz, whereupon the jitter<br>
was measured by a time interval analyzer (manufactured by<br>
Yokogawa Electric Corporation). The retrieving power Pr<br>
was 0.6 mW.<br>
Formation of a logic level to control the recording<br>
pulse division method was carried out by means of an<br>
optional signal generator (AWG710, manufactured by Sony<br>
Tektronix Co.). From the above signal generator, logic<br>
signals at ECL level were input as gate signals against a<br>
laser driver of the above tester.<br>
On the disk of Example 16, EFM+ random data was<br>
overwritten 10 times at a linear velocity of 8-times<br>
velocity, and the jitter of said recording data was<br>
measured.<br>
The pulse rows for the respective mark, length<br>
recording were set as follows. The light irradiation<br>
time to record the nT mark was divided in order of a1T,<br>
ß1T, a2T, b2T, ..., aiT, biT, ..., amT, bmT (m is the pulse<br>
division number and T is the reference clock period),<br>
irradiation with a recording laser beam with a writing<br>
power Pw was carried out at the time of ait (1=i=m) , and<br>
irradiation with a recording laser beam with a bias power<br>
Pb was carried out at the time of bit (l=i=m) . These<br>
values were set as shown in Table 6. For marks of some<br>
lengths, the timing of irradiation with the pulse row was<br>
delayed for a certain time from the original starting<br>
time of said mark length in the EFM+ signal, and this<br>
time is shown in the section "delay time". A case where<br>
the irradiation timing was delayed was represented by +,<br>
and a case where it was advanced was represented by -.<br>
The value was normalized by the clock period T. The mark<br>
formed by providing the delay time is close: to the ideal<br>
EFM+ random signal, and the jitter is excellent. At the<br>
space between marks (portion other than the portion<br>
disclosed in Table), irradiation with an erasing power Pe<br>
was carried out. Pe was 7.6 mW, and Pb was 0 mW.<br>
The results are shown in Fig. 13. A power range in<br>
which the jitter is at most 10% is present, and with such<br>
characteristics, the disk can be practically applied.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILitY<br>
