Herbicidal composition<br>
The present invention relates to a herbicidal composition in the form of an aqueous emulsion which comprises, as herbicidally effective compound. 2-(4-(3-chloro-5-fluoro-2-pyridyloxy)-phenoxy-propionic acid propargyl ester, and to the use of that composition in controlling weeds in crops of useful plants.<br>
2-(4-(3-Chloro-5-fluoro-2-pyridyloxy)-phenoxy-propionic acid propargyl ester has herbicidal activity, especially in crops of cereals, rice and soybeans; it is known by the name clodinafop-propargyl and is described, for example, in US-A-4 713 109.<br>
Clodinafop-propargyl is preferably used together with the safener 2-(5-chloroquinolin-8-yloxy)-1-methylhexyl ester, which is known by the name cloquintocet-mexyl and is described, for example, in US-A-4 881 966. Both compounds are commercially available in the form of an emulsifiable concentrate (EC).<br>
Aqueous emulsions for the formulation of pesticides are known per se and are described, for example, in US-A-5 674 514. The problem solved in US-A-5 674 514 was to provide an aqueous emulsion for the purpose of improving the storage stability of certain pesticides. US-A-5 674 514 contains no reference whatsoever to changes in the biological activity of pesticides fomiulated in that manner.<br>
It has now been found, surprisingly, that the herbicidal activity of clodinafop-propargyl can be considerably increased when that compound is applied in the form of a particular aqueous emulsion.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates to a herbicidal composition in the form of an<br>
aqueous emulsion which comprises<br>
a), as organic phase, a solution of a herbicidally effective amount of the compound 2-(4-(3-<br>
chloro-5-fluoro-2-pyridyloxy)-phenoxy-propionic acid propargyl ester in a hydrophobic solvent<br>
and a substantially water-insoluble and hydrolysis-stable oil phase stabiliser and<br>
b), as aqueous phase, a solution of a pH buffer and at least one surface-active compound<br>
and/or dispersing agent in water.<br><br>
Preferred compositions according to the invention additionally comprise an amount, effective for antagonism of the herbicide, of 2-(5-chloroquinoIin-8-yloxy)-1-methylhexyl ester, its free acid or a salt thereof of formula<br><br>
wherein M is a mono-, bi- or tri-valent metal, ammonium, N(R)4 or HN(R)3, wherein the substituents R are identical to or different from one another and are C1-C16alkyI or C1-C16-hydroxyalkyl, or M is S(Ri)3 or P(Ri)4, wherein the substituents R, are identical to or different from one another and are C1-C20alkyI, C2-C20aikenyl. C2-C20alkynyl, aryl substituted by C1-C20alkyi. C2-C2oalkenyl or by C2-C20alkynyl or heteroaryl substituted by C1-C20alkyl. C2-C20-alkenyl or by C2-C2oalkynyl, or 2 substituents R, together with the sulfur or phosphorus atom to which they are bonded form a 5- or 6-membered ring.<br>
The metal atoms M that may be present in formula I are preferably those of alkali and alkaline earth metals, especially sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and also, especially, aluminium and iron as preferred representatives of trivalent metals. Among the alkyl and hydroxyalkyl sutjstituents R, preference is given to those having from 12 to 16 carbon atoms and also to those ha&gt;nTTg from 1 to 4 cart&gt;on atoms. The groups N(R)4 and HN(R)3 especially contain one long-chain and 2 or 3 short-chain alkyl group(s). for example hexadecyl-triethylammonium, tetradecyl-triethylammonium. dodecyltriethyl-ammonium and dodecyl-ethyl-dimethylammonrum, and also tetradodecylammonium. Preferred alkyl groups R, contain from 1 to 12. especially from 1 to 6, carbon atoms. The alkyl groups R and R, may be further substituted, for example by halogen, alkoxy or by haloalkoxy, in both cases preferably containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Preferred alkenyl and alkynyl groups R, contain from 2 to 12 carbon atoms. They may contain more than one unsaturated bond and may be substituted by halogen, alkoxy or by haloalkoxy, in both cases preferably containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Suitable examples of aryl groups R, include phenyl, naphthyl. tetrahydronaphthyl, indanyl and indenyl, phenyl being preferred. Those groups may be substituted by the afore-mentioned alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl groups. As<br><br>
heteroaryl groups R, there may be mentioned preferably 5- and 6-membered rings containing especially nitrogen and/or oxygen atoms, for example pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, triazinyl, thienyl, thiazolyl, pyrazolyl, imidazolyl, piperidyi, dioxolanyl, morpholinyl and tetrahydrofuryl. Those heterocycles may also be further substituted by the afore-mentioned alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl groups. In each case, 2 substituents R, together with the sulfur or phosphorus atom to which they are bonded may form a ring, in which case preference is given to 5- or 6-membered rings that are saturated. Sulfonium and phosphonium cations suitable for use according to the invention are described, for example, in WO 00/44227.<br>
Preferred salts of 2-(5-chloroquinoiin-8-yloxy)-1-methylhexyl ester comprise a compound of formula I wherein M is sodium, potassium ortri{hydroxyethylene)ammonium.<br>

Suitable pH buffer systems in the context of the present invention are those mixtures of acids and salts that are capable of stabilising a pH of from 4 to 6. especially acetic acid/sodium acetate, phosphoric acid/sodium phosphate or citric acid/citrate, preferably phosphoric acid/sodium phosphate or citric acid/citrate. The aqueous phase of the compositions according to the invention are preferably adjusted to a pH of 4 with phosphoric acid/sodium phosphate or citric acid/citrate.<br>
The pH buffer is used in an amount of from 0.1 to 1 mol, preferably from 0.2 to 0.7 mol, especially 0.5 mol. based on the aqueous phase.<br>
In the context of the present invention, any solvent that is substantially insoluble in water is suitable as the hydrophobic solvent, for example aromatic solvents selected from the classes of the toluenes, xylenes, alkylbenzenes and alkylnaphthalenes, and also saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, aryl-alkyi ketones, esters, fatty acid methyl esters, rapeseed oil C1-C16alkyi esters, especially rapeseed oil methyl ester and rapeseed oil ethyl ester, esters of acetic acid or benzoic acid, amides of alkanecarboxylic acids, linear or cyclic acetates, alkylpyrrolidones. alkylcaprolactones and also alkyl carbonates or mixtures of those solvents. The solvent is preferably used in an amount of from 10 to 60 % by weight, based on the complete formulation of the aqueous emulsion.<br>
It has been found, moreover, that the chemical stability of the compositions according to the invention can be further increased when a hydrophobic solvent preferably of especially high<br><br>
polarity is used in the organic phase. In the context of the present invention, solvents of high polarity are to be understood as solvents having a dipole moment of at least 4 x 10"^° Cm (coulomb X m).

The molecular weight of the polymer of the oil phase stabilisers that are suitable for the composition according to the invention, determined, for example, by light-scattering measurements or by measurement of the osmotic pressure, can be up to 1 000 000 and is usually from 1000 to 1 000 000 daltons, preferably from 1000 to 100 000 daltons. In the case of compounds that are extremely hydrophobic and therefore of extremely low solubility in water, for example alkanes and fatty acid alkyl esters, the MW can also be less than 1000.<br>
The oil phase stabilisers are used in the composition according to the invention in a concentration of from 0.5 to 10 % by weight, preferably from 1 to 5 % by weight, based on the complete formulation. In the case of compounds that are extremely hydrophobic and<br><br>
therefore of extremely low solubility in water, for example alkanes and fatty acid alkyl esters, and that have a low molecular weight, the concentration of the oil phase stabilisers can be up to 25%.<br>
Surface-active substances and dispersing agents that are suitable for the present composition according to the invention include tristyrylphenol ethoxylates, for example Soprophor TS-10 (Rhone Poulenc S.A.) or BSU (Rhodia Geronazzo Spa), EO/PO/EO block copolymers, for example Pluronic F-108, Pluronic F-38, Pluronic P-105 (BASF Wyandotte Corp.) and/or sodium salts of sulfonated naphthalenesulfonic acid-formaldehyde condensation products, for example Morwet D-425 (Witco Chem.

The dispersing agents are preferably used in an amount of from 0.5 to 5 % by weight, especially from 1 to 2 % by weight, based on the complete formulation.<br>
The formulations in accordance with the invention may additionally comprise thickeners for the continuous aqueous phase. Any thickener generally customary in formulation technology and capable of increasing the viscosity of the aqueous emulsions according to the invention is suitable, for example xanthan gum, clays or polyethylene glycols. The thickeners are preferably used in a concentration of from 0.03 to 1 %, based on the complete formulation of the aqueous emulsion.<br>
In addition, there may also be added to the formulations according to the invention substances that lower the melting point of the emulsions, that is to say that prevent the formulation from freezing at low temperatures (anti-freezing agents). Such substances are usually water-soluble salts that are suitable for lowering the freezing point of the aqueous phase of the emulsion according to the invention, for example sodium chloride, potassium chloride, ammonium chloride, ammonium nitrate and sodium nitrate and mixtures thereof. Also suitable are water-soluble glycols, for example ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, glycerol and mixtures thereof. The salts and the glycols are, in each case.<br><br>
preferably used in a concentration of from 0.5 to 10 % by weight, based on the complete formulation of the emulsion.<br>
The emulsions according to the invention may additionally comprise, as adjuvants, preservatives that inhibit the growth of micro-organisms such as bacteria and fungi, for example Proxel GXL (benzisothiazolin-3-one, Avecia Inc.) or formaldehyde. Such adjuvants can be used in an amount of from 0.1 to 0.5 % by weight of the complete formulation.<br>
Preparation of the emulsions according to the invention is substantially carried out using the methods described in US-A-5 674 514. The organic phase can be prepared, for example, by dissolving clodinafop-propargyl, optionally together with cloquintocet-mexyl, in a hydrophobic solvent, subsequently adding the water-insoluble oil phase stabiliser and then, where appropriate, heating.<br>
The aqueous phase is prepared by dissolving a surface-active substance and/or a dispersing agent in water, where appropriate adding substances that lower the freezing point.<br>
The organic phase is then emulsified in the aqueous phase by means of a suitable stirrer, for example a YSTRAL® X 40/32 emulsifier. having stirring speeds of from 3000 to 6000 rpm. Depending on the formulation used and the speed, an emulsion is obtained having particle sizes in the preferred range of 1 - 10 micrometres. Thickeners and/or preservatives may. where appropriate, be added to the formulation before or after the emulsification step.<br>
Whereas commercial products will preferably be formulated as concentrates, the end user will normally employ formulations diluted with water.<br><br><br><br>

The mixture is ground to a particle size of from 2 to 4 micrometres (for example, using a Dino mill apparatus).<br>
e)	Preparation of the aqueous suspoemulsion:<br>
As described in Example PI e).<br>
Bioloqical Examples:<br>
Clodinafop-propargyl is generally used on the plant or the locus thereof in rates of application of from 5 to 200 g/ha, especially from 10 to 50 g/ha, more especially from 20 to 30 g/ha.<br>
The rates of application of cloquintocet-mexyl are generally from 2 to 100 g/ha, preferably from 2 to 50 g/ha. especially from 5 to 7.5 g/ha.<br>
The concentration required to achieve the desired action can be determined by experimentation. It will depend on the type of action, the development stage of the cultivated<br><br>
plant and of the weed, as well as on the application (place, time, method), and in dependence on those parameters can vary over a wide range.<br>
The amount of safener to be applied in relation to the herbicide is largely dependent upon the type of application. In the case of field treatment, which is effected either using a tank mixture with a combination of the safener and the herbicide or by the separate application of the safener and the herbicide, the ratio of herbicide to safener is generally from 1:1 to 10:1, preferably 4:1.<br>
The herbicidal activity of the aqueous emulsions according to the invention is demonstrated in the following biological Examples:<br>
Example B1: Herbicidal action after emergence of the plants (post-emergence action): Monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds are grown under greenhouse conditions in standard soil in plastic pots. Application of the test substances is carried out when the plants are at the 3- to 6-leaf stage. Application is carried out in the form of an aqueous emulsion of the test substances in 400 litres of water per hectare. The rates of application depend on the optimum doses ascertained under field conditions and greenhouse conditions. The tests are evaluated after 20 days (% action, 100 % = plant has died. 0 % = no phytotoxic action).<br>
Test plants: Alopecurus. Lolium rigidum. Lolium multiflorum. Agrostis.<br><br>
Compositions of the formulations used;<br>
Compositidn po. C9 according to the present invention:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Table B1 shows that, in this test, the compositions according to the invention have surprisingly improved herbicidal action on the tested weeds compared to the known emulsifiable concentrate (EC 100). Especially in the case of Alopecurus and Lolium, it wa: possible for the herbicidal action to be increased almost to complete destruction of the we (95 % herbicidal action).<br>
In addition to the surprisingly improved herbicidal activity of clodinafop-propargyl, the compositions according to the invention have the following advantageous properties:<br>
stable emulsion droplets are formed which, even when stored for a relatively long<br>
period, exhibit no appreciable particle size growth and no phase separation;<br>
the clodinafop-propargyl and the cloquintocet-mexyl, which is optionally present in<br>
addition, have a high degree of chemical stability, resulting from appropriate selectio<br>
of the solvent and pH buffer system;<br>
a high degree of stability in the cold, and therefore good suitability for storage even 2<br>
low temperatures;<br>
no crystallisation of the herbicide or safener occurs in the event of temperature<br>
changes; and<br>
no phase separation occurs in the event of freeze/thaw cycles.<br><br><br><br>
What is claimed is:<br>
1.	A herbicidal composition in the form of an aqueous emulsion which comprises<br>
a), as organic phase, a solution of a herbicidally effective amount of the compound 2-(4-(3-chloro-5-fluoro-2-pyridyloxy)-phenoxy-propionic acid propargyl ester in a hydrophobic solvent and a substantially water-insoluble and hydrolysis-stable oil phase stabiliser and b), as aqueous phase, a solution of a pH buffer and at least one surface-active compound and/or dispersing agent in water.<br>
2.	A composition according to claim 1, which comprises an amount, effective for antagonism<br>
of the herbicide, of 2-(5-chloroquinolin-8-yloxy)-1-methylhexyl ester, its free acid or a salt<br>
thereof of formula <br>
