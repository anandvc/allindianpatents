DETAILED DESCRIPTION OP PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[29] The XML-based electronic documents aie often managed in a clint/server structure that stores the documents in the server and provides desired electronic documents according to the user's request. Such a client/server structure is illustrated in FIG. 1.<br>
[30] FIG. 1 is a schematic view of the client/server structure that requests/supplies a general XML-based electronic document, As shown in FIG. 1, the client is a document requester/user side, and the server is a document provider side. Accordingly, if a system requesting and using a document has functions of storing and providing the document at the same time, the system can simultaneously act as the client and the server according to its role.<br>
[31] A language for searching these XML documents includes XML query language (XQL) and .XQucty. These search languages are widely used to.search XML documents stored in an electronic document repository of the server and provide a result in a form of XML document desired by the requester.<br>
[32] As an example, the XQL will be described below. The XQL is a means for searching and selecting positions of data fields arid texts existing within die XML document. The XML files'are used to transmit data collection between computers on the web, The XQL provides a tool for searclung or selecting a specific item in the data collection within the XML files. This is based on a format syntax that is used in an extensible style, sheet language (XSL). The XQL is proposed as an extended version of the XSL,<br>
[33] For processing, the XSL format language uses a simple directory notation to indicate a specific element name. For example, "books/authois" icpicsents "a searching of all author components within nil book components in a specific context such as an XML<br>
file". The XQL adds a capacity of using Boolean logic, selecting components and indexing component collections to the duectojy format notation. The XQL makes it possible to produce programs capable of searching the electronic document repository, which stores the XML files, and providing hyperlinks linked to specific components.<br>
[34] As described above, in a related art method for requesting a supply of the electronic documents using these search languages, a user requesting the electronic document should learn an additional search language and designate a structure of the XML document to be supplied as the search result. Accordingly, the related art XQL method is ineffective to the -user who wants to request and receive the electronic document created based on the previously designated syntax.<br>
[35] '; Pieferred embodiments, of XML-based electronic,document request methods<br>
using a prescribed syntax according to the present invention will now be described. XML-<br>
based electronic documents can use a document type definition (DTD) or an XML schema<br>
language to define syntaxes. These syntaxes define a structure of an entire electronic<br>
document and restrict, name and occurrence liequeucy of each clement, otder, whether it is a<br>
required element or an optional element, attribute of each element, etc. The electronic<br>
documents become valid documents with respect to the syntaxes .provided by these<br>
languages.	â€¢	â€¢<br>
[36] Preferred embodiments of the present invention can constitute a request document requesting desired information by using a prescribed syntax, and can request supply of information from an electronic document repository by using the request document. In other words, a requester requests the supply of the iuformation to the<br>
electronic document repository by transmitting the request document or the lita with the .   desk-eel inf onnation recorded based on the prescribed syntax.<br>
1.3 71 A request document isprefeiably consituted with only nn rlrm^nl: name/attribute narne without detailed information values of element iiamcs/atuibute names based on the syntax. Additionally, if there is an information that can limit the to-be-supplied information, an identifier or nn clement name/attribute name based on the syntax can be recorded in the request document together with specific values.<br>
[38] Accordingly, when the requester sends the request document to the electronic document repository for the purpose of requesting the supply of the electronic document, the .syntax of a required .element or a required attribute among the limitations of. the â€¢ â€¢ prescribed syntaxes may not be observed. In. other words, because -the. supply of the electronic document is requested to the repository after inserting only the desired element or die attribute values, the required element or the required attribute can. be omitted if there is not the desired information value.<br>
[39]    In   the   element   namc/attiibutc   name   lepiescuting   the   to-be supplied<br>
information and having an identifier value or specific value for limiting the information, the<br>
,   electronic document described according to a hierarchy structure of the prescribed syntax.is<br>
preferably used as the request document.   The electronic document can be supplied that<br>
includes the value of the desired element name/attribute name and satisfies the value of the<br>
' element name/attribute name used as the identification value or the conditions.<br>
[40] In other.words, according to embodiments of the XML basecl electronic document request/supply method of the present invention, a supply of the electronic<br><br>
document having the corresponding information is requested by using a request document iu -which the-, identification Value; of the to-bc-icqucstecl electronic document and i:h<: to-be-supplied clement are described according to die heraichy.structure of the prescribed .syntax.></:>
[41] Additionally, according to embodiments of the XML-based electronic document request/supply method of the present invention, an attribute value is added at the provider side to notify an invalidity of the contents to be deleted if contents of the supplied document ate deleted or not valid any more. Further, according to embodiments of the XML-based electronic document request/supply rnedhod of the present invention, if predetermined contents of die supplied document ate deleted or not valid any moie, the invalidity of the document is preferably notified by inserting only the to-be-deleted contents â€¢<br>
'.. into the element ntunei<br>
[42] The embodiments of a electronic document request/supply method according to the present invention can be applied, for example, to the requester requesting the supply of the electronic document, the provider supplying the requested electronic document, and a system configured with a network connecting .the requester and the provider. Also, the electronic document request/supply method can be. applied to a system that provides, only<br>
: basic information under an environment such, as a broadcasting program providing system' and then receives an additional information via a network according to the user's request.<br>
[43]    For example, a syntax of the electronic document of the broadcasting program<br>
â€¢ can be defined as follows, and an electronic document request/supply method -will be<br>
. described with reference to FIG, 2. FIG. 2 is an exemplary view showing a syntax structure :<br>
of a broadcasting program produced by a related art method of creating an XML-based electronic document.<br>
[44] As shown in FIG. 2, it is assumed that the broadcasting program, has a title and program identifier (ID) information uniquely indicating the program, an information on a broadcast such as broadcasting service, time and duration, and information on contents sucli as synopsis, review and casting. Herein, the case where the title, the progiam identifier, the time and the duration are defined as the required elements will be described. Accordingly, as shown in FIG. 2, a solid line can represent a required element and a dotted line can represent an optional clement.<br>
[45] As shown in FIGs. 3 and 4, these programs can be illustrated Using a DTD and an XML schema. FIG. 3 is an exemplary view ol the DTD, showing syntax ol the broadcasting program produced by a related art method of creating the XML-based electronic document, and FIG. 4 is an exemplary view of the XML schema showing syntax of the broadcasting program created by a related method of cieating the XML-based electronic document.<br>
[46] . The DTD is regulations for applying XML in. order to markup a specific .' document type and. determined by its application. A definition of the document type can include an element type that can be expressed by the markup, an clement relationship and attribute, and a regulation related to a reference.<br>
[47] In FIGs. 5 and 6, there are shown broadcasting piogiams actually created based on the syntax. FIGs. 5 and 6 are views of exemplary broadcasting program electronic documents created by a related art method of creating the XML-based electronic document.<br>
Here, the title that is the required clement is all contained, but the optional elements may not bo contained.<br>
[48] HG. 7 is a diagram that shows an exemplary view of a request document requesting a supply of an electronic document created by the XML-based electronic document request method according to an embodiment of the present invention. It Is assumed that the requestor requests the review of a specific piogiam t.o thft Innndrn.ttiug station. At this time, the requester can create the request document as shown in PIG. 7.<br>
[49]    As shown in FIG. 7, the request document can use the same syntax of FlGs. 5<br>
and 6. Although the present invention is not intended to be so limited. However, the tide<br>
element that is the required element is omitted, and die supply of the electroiiic document is<br>
â€¢requested to the repository after inserting "the identifier" element of the desired piogram<br>
and "the review" element.<br>
[50] Accordingly, the request document can be supplied to the electronic document repository by the request of the user or the like who produces the request document shown in FIG. 7. FIG. 8 is a diagram that shows an exemplary view of the requested electronic document supplied according to the request document of FIG. 7, . â€¢ Further, as- shown in FIG! 8, the electronic document including the requested information .-can be supplied to the electronic document application system utilized by the users according to the prescribed syntax.<br>
)	.      [51]    As a further example, it is assumed that the requester requests programsi in<br>
which a specific actor or actress performs. At this time, the requester can create the request document as shown in FIG. 9. As shown in FIG. 9, the request document can use the same<br>
syntax of PIGs. 5 and 6. However, the title element that is the required element is omitted, .and the supply of the electronic document is requested to the repository after inserting only "the casting" element of the desired program, Here, since the "tide" element and the information on "the broadcast" ate the icquircd elements, this infonnation is automatically provided even if they are not marked in the request document.<br>
[52] Accordingly, as shown in FIG. 10, the clccuonie document repository supplies die electronic document application system utilized by the users with the electronic document including the requested information according to the prescribed syntax in response to the user's request.<br>
. . [53] Acc.ordinp;, to "the embodiments' of XML-based electronic document; request/supply methods of the pxesent invention, the requester can 'request a, Supply of the, electronic document stored in the electronic document repository by using the prescribed syntax (e.g., without learning a .syntax of the additional language for the search request). Additionally, embodiments of methods of the present invention can be.performed more effectively since the electronic document supplied from the electronic document repository is processed by using only the system, which processes the prescribed syntax based on the .<br>
. XML. ,<br>
[54] At this time, the element name/attribute name of the request document is selectively recorded among the required/optional elements and/or the required/optional<br>
â€¢ attributes for the syntax defining the constructed electronic document structure. The element name/attribute name selectively recorded in the request document can represent the clement name/attribute name of information that should.be provided to the to-be-supplied<br>
electronic document. Further, if corresponding values are recorded in the elemeni/aiuibute selectively recorded in the request document, the recorded values of the clement name/attribute name represents the conditions of the element name/attribute' name that should be satisfied by the electronic document provided in response to the user's request.<br>
[55] Further, if there arc the contents to be deleted due to a change in the contents of the document, for example, if a prearranged broadcasting program is cancelled, the processes can. be performed as shown in FIGs. 11 and/or FIG. 12. In other words, as shown in FIGs. 11 and 12, cancellation of the prearranged broadcasting program, for example, can be notified by adding an invalid or deletion element name or attribute name or the like.<br>
[56] HG. 11 is.a diagram that shows an exemplary view.of an emuuuuneiu<br>
providing information on a deleted document by supplying a document with an element<br>
notifying that die document is invalid according to an embodiment of an XML-based<br>
electronic document supply method of the present invention. FIG. 12 is an exemplary view<br>
of providing information on a deleted document by supplying a document with an attribute<br>
notifying that the document is invalid according to another embodiment of. an XML-basedelectronic document supply metho'd of the present invention. â€¢â€¢	. â€¢ .,<br>
[57] In more detail, information on the cancellation of a prearranged broadcasting program, for example "Larry King," can be provided by adding the invalid clement as shown in FIG. 11. At this time, the to-be-deleted contents contained as the invalid contents within the supplied document can.be dctemiined by an identifier .clement that can identify the document. If the identifier element is supplied as the contents of the invalid element, the<br>
corresponding entire document can be deleted. If the identifier (e.g., identifier element) that can identify the coiresponding document within the supplied document is contained' and only the to-be: deleted contents of the corresponding document are contained as the invalid element name, only the corresponding contents contained within the invalid element name are preferably deleted.<br>
[58] Furthcr, the information on the cancellation of the prescribed broadcasting<br>
program, for example "Larry King," can be provided simply by adding the attribute name<br><program invalid="true"> as exemplarily shown in FIG. 12. At this time, the attribute<br>
name notifying the invalidity of the supplied document can be au attribute of the identifier<br>
clement 'name that can. identify the to-be-deleted document. In case of providing the<br>
attribute name-notifying that the attribute of the identifier eleipent name becomes invalidj<br>
the corresponding entire document that can be identified by the corresponding document<br>
identifier is deleted.	. .<br>
[59] Additionally, if the identifier that can identify the corresponding document â€¢within die supplied document is contained and.only the to-be-deleted contents of the corresponding document are provided as an attribute notifying the invalidity, only the corresponding contents among, the documents identified by the. document identifier are preferably deleted.<br>
[60] According to embodiments of XML-based electronic document - supply methods of the present invention, it is possible to gradually upgrade die document by deleting the contents, that are deleted or not valid any more because of a change in the<br><br>
contents qf the document, without having to newly supply the document, or by supplying billy the invalid contents.<br>
[61] As described above, preferred embodiments of methods for document lequest and/or supply have various advantages. Accoiding lo preferred embodiments of the present invention, XMI-based electjonic documents cau be effectively supplied using the previously prescribed syntax without learning the syntax of additional languages to request the electronic, document. Further, an electronic document application system utilized by the requester can request the search of the electronic document and process the electronic document supplied from the electronic document repository using only an apparatus and/or algorithm for processing the prescribed syntax. In addition, if some or the entire contents of . the supplied document arc deleted or become invalid, the use of the invalid document or its contents can be reduced or prevented by simply notifying the deleted contents.<br>
[62] The foregoing embodiments and advantages are merely exemplary and are not to be construed as limiting the present invention. The present teaching can be readily applied to odier types of apparatuses. The description of the preesent. invention is intended to be illustrative, and not to limit the scope of the claims. Many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in "the .art. In the. claims, means-plus-function clauses are intended to cover the structures described herein as performing the recited function and not only structural equivalents but also equivalent structures.<br><br><br><br>
