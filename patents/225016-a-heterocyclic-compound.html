TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel heterocyclic compound being useful as a medicament, especially exhibiting a human neutrophilic elastase inhibitory activity, intermediates thereof, and a human neutrophilic elastase inhibitor containing as the active ingredient said heterocyclic compound.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Human neutrophilic elastase (hereinafter, occasionally simply referred to as elastase) is a kind of serine proteases being massively released from the granules of neutrophile, which appear in the cases of infections or inflammatory diseases.    Elastase is an enzyme hydrolyzing proteins such as elastin, collagen, proteoglycan, fibronectin, etc. which constitute the interstitum of intravital connective tissues such as lung, cartilage, vascular weill, skin, etc.     In addition, it has been clarified that elastase acts on other proteins or cells as well.<br>
In the living body, elastase keeps the homeostasis of the living body while the activities thereof are controlled by endogenous inhibitor proteins such as a1-protease inhibitor, a2-niacrogloblin, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, etc.     However, when a balance between elastase and the endogenous inhibitors is lost by the excessive release<br><br>
of elastase in the inflammation site or by the lowering in the inhibitor level, the control of elastase activities cannot be kept, by which tissues are injured.<br>
Diseases in which elastase may participate are, for example, pulmonary emphysema, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP), cystic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic interstitial pneumonia, chronic bronchitis, chronic sinopulmonary infection, diffuse panbronchiolitis, bronchiectasis, asthma, pancreatitis, nephritis, hepatic failure, chronic rheumatoid arthritis, joint scleroma, osteoarthritis, psoriasis, periodontitis, atherosclerosis, rejection against organ transplant, premature amniorrhexis, bullous dermatosis, shock, sepsis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Crohn's disease, disseminated intracapillary coagulation (DIC), tissue injury after ischemia-reperfusion, formation of cornea cicatricial tissue, myelitis, etc.<br>
Therefore, an elastase inhibitor can be expected to be useful in the prophylaxis or treatment of these diseases.   Under these expectations, various elastase inhibitors have been reported.<br>
For example, European Patent Publication No. 189305 (hereinafter, occasionally referred to as Ref. 1) discloses a compound of the following formula (A-1), and it discloses that said compound (A-1) is useful as an elastase inhibitor.<br><br>
wherein R^ is a lower alkyl having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, R^ is a lower<br><br>
alkyl having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, etc., R'* is a hydrogen atom, etc., A is -CO-, etc., and n is 0, 1 or 2.<br>
Within the above formula, the compound of the following formula is included.<br><br>
R^ of the above formula (A-2) represents various substituents, but it does not mean the specific substituents included within the present compounds as mentioned below.<br>
In addition, European Patent Publication No. 291234 (hereinafter, occasionally referred to as Ref. 2) discloses a compound of the following formula (B-1), and it also discloses that said compound (B-1) exhibits a leukocyte elastase inhibitory activity.<br><br>
wherein Q is an orthophenylene group optionally having a substituent such as a halogen, etc., X is an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom, A is -CO-, etc., L is a phenylene, a (Ci-Ce) alkanediyl, etc., and R"* is an acylsulfon-amide, etc.<br>
Moreover, the following compound (a) is disclosed in Example 2(63) of USP 5,017,610 (hereinafter, occasionally referred to as Ref. 3). The chemical structure of said compound (a) is completely different from the chemical structure Of the present compounds.   However, said compound (a) should be noted because it has been most developed and studied as a water-soluble elastase inhibitor.<br><br><br>

The present invention also relates to a human neutrophilic elastase inhibitor containing as the active ingredient a water-soluble compound of the present invention.    By the following Experiments, the inhibitory activity of the present compound against human neutrophilic elastase is illustrated below.<br>
EXPERIMENT 1: Human neutrophilic elastase inhibitory activity<br>
In the present experiment, the inhibitory activity of the present invention against human neutrophilic elastase was studied in vitro.<br>
Human neutrophilic elastase (Sigma) was dissolved in a HEPES Buffer (133 mM, pH 7.5) containing 1.9 M sodium chloride, 0.38 % polyethylene glycol 6000 and 0.0019 % Bri j-35 at a final concentration of 1.9 mil/ml.   The resulting solution (210 pi) was mixed with a 10'^ - 10"^ M solution of the present compound (40 pi), and the mixture was pre-incubated at SyC for 6 minutes.   To this solution, 4 mM succinyl-alanyl-prolyl-alanine 4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (substrate<br>
solution, Peptide Institute Inc.) (50 pi) and distilled water (100 pi) were added, and the mixture was further reacted at 37°C for 20 minutes. The concentration of the 7'amino-4-methylcoumarine thus obtained was measured fluorimetrically by monitoring at an excitation wave length of 380 nm and a fluorescent wave length of 460 nm.<br><br>
The above "Brij-35" means polyoxyethylene (23) lauryl ether, and the "HEPES" means N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N'-(2-ethane-sulfonic acid).<br>
The elastase inhibitory activity (inhibitory rate) was calculated according to the following equation, and the 50 % inhibitory concentration (ICJQ value) was obtained from the concentration-inhibitory rate curve of the present compound.   The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
In the following equation, A means the intensity of fluorescence when a present compound is added, and B means the intensity of fluorescence when a present compound is not added.<br>
INHIBITORY RATE {%) = (1 - A/B) X 100<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
As is shown in Table 1, the concentration of the present invention to be required to achieve 50 % human neutrophihc elastase inhibition (i.e., IC^Q] is not more than 0.082 yM, and some of the present compounds showed an ICgo almost equal to that of the control compound (a).   As mentioned before, the control compound (a) is disclosed in USP 5,017,610, Example 2 (63), and it is a human neutrophilic elastase inhibitor being under development, of which compound code has been known as ONO-5046.<br>
In addition, the inhibitory activities of the present invention against human neutrophilic elastase {IC^Q] are much more potent than that of the control compound (b) as disclosed in Table 1.   The control compound (b) is a novel compound, but it does not have a group of the<br><br>
formula: HOOC-A-, and hence, it cannot be included within the scope of the formula (I-a).<br>
EXPERIMENT 2: Inhibitory activity on pulmonary hemorrhage induced by human neutrophilic elastase<br>
When human neutrophilic elastase is administered intratracheally to a hamster, the hemorrhage is induced in the lung. Hemoglobin is detected in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid, which is obtained by washing the lung via bronchi at a fixed period after the elastase administration.   In order to examine how much this hemorrhage can be inhibited by the present compound, this experiment was carried out by measuring the concentration of this hemoglobin.<br>
Hamsters (made Syrian streiin, 8-10 weeks old) were grouped into the following three groups (5 animals per group), and the following treatment was carried out on each group. (Al   Vehicle-treated control group (non-treatment group):<br>
Physiological saline solution (0.2 ml) was administered intratracheally to the hamsters, and one hour thereafter, the alveolus was bronchially washed five times with physiological saline solutions (each 2.5 ml), and then, the concentration of hemoglobin in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (12.5 ml) was measured by the absorbance at 414 nm.   The result of the measurement was counted as A. (B)   Human neutrophilic elastase-treated group (without the present compound):<br>
Human neutrophilc elastase (25 units, manufactured by Elastin Products, Inc.) was dissolved in physiological saline solution (0.2 ml), and the solution thus obtained was administered to the hamsters at the<br><br>
bronchial tube to induce the pulmonary hemorrhage.    One hour after the administration of elastase, the concentration of hemoglobin in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid was measured in the same manner as in Group (A).   The result of the measurement was counted as B. fC)    Human neutrophilic elastase-treated group (with the present com^pound):<br>
A fixed amount of the present compound was administered to the hamsters in the form of a phosphate-buffered saline solution (pH 7.4) in the manner as described below.   Then, human neutrophilic elastase was administered to the hamsters in the same manner as the above.    One hour after the administration of elastase, the concentration of hemoglobin in the washing of the broncho-alveolar lavage was measured in the same manner as in Group (A).   The result of the measurement was counted as C. Administration method of the present compound:<br>
The administration of the present compound to the hamsters was carried out by two kinds of methods.   One of them is a method of intravenous bolus-administration of the solution containing the present compound 5 minutes prior to the elastase administration.   Another method is a method of intravenous infusion of the solution containing the present compound for a period of 70 minutes beginning at 10 minutes prior to the elastase administration.<br>
Hemorrhage inhibitory rate (%) was calculated according to the following equation (average among 5 cases).   In the equation, each A, B and C means the above meaning respectively, and the experiment data are shown in Table 2.<br><br>
HEMORRHAGE INHIBITORY RATE (%) = [1 - (C-A)/(B-A)] X 100<br><br>
The figures in Table indicate hemorrhage inhibitory rates (%). However, the figures in parentheses indicate dosages.<br>
As is shown in Table 2, the human neutrophilic elastase-induced pulmonary hemorrhage inhibitory activity of the present compounds is far higher than that of the control compound (a).<br><br>
EXPERIMENT 3: Acute toxicity test in mice<br>
The present compound was dissolved in phosphate buffered physiological saline solution (pH 7.4), and the solution was injected to 7-weeks old male Std:ddy mice (6 animals per group) at the tail vein. Twenty-four hours after the administration, the animals were observed if dead or alive.   The results thereof are shown in Table 3.<br><br>

The solubility in an aqueous solvent of the present compound was measured, and the results as shown in Table 4 were obtained. The pH value in Table 4 is a pH value of a solution of the present compound in distilled water.<br><br><br>
present compounds are more than 100 mg/ml, which are more than that of the control compound (a).<br>
From the results of the above Experiments, the present compound is an excellent water-soluble elastase inhibitor, and is useful in the treatment of various diseases, especially acute pulmonary diseases.<br>
The dosage of the present compounds varies according to the routes of the administration, conditions and ages of the patients, but it is usually in the range of about 2 to 5000 mg/60 kg of body weight/day, preferably in the range of about 10 to 2000 mg/60 kg of body weight/day, especially preferably in the range of 30 to 1500 mg/60 kg of body weight/day.   The present compounds may be administered orally, but preferably administered parentally, especially intravenously.<br>
The present compound may be administered in the form of a conventional pharmaceutical preparation, and these preparations may be prepared by mixing the present compound with a conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.    For example, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent for a liquid preparation for parental administration includes essentially vehicles such as water, physiological saline solution, and in addition thereto, includes optionally other auxiliary agents such as isotonic agents, anesthetic agents, pH adjusting agents, buffering agents, preservatives, etc.<br>
Liquid preparation such as injection may be prepared by dissolving the present compound in a vehicle such as a physiological saline solution for injection, and if necessary, followed by mixing other<br><br>
auxiliary agents before or after the dissolution of the present compound.   Lyophilized preparations may be prepared by lyophilizing such a liquid preparation, and it is re-dissolved when used.<br>
In addition, the present invention relates to the compound of the formula (II) or a salt thereof.<br><br>
wherein A, B, D\ D^ and D^ are as defined above, R is a protecting group for carboxyl group, W is a hydrojcy group, a halogen atom or an active carboxylic acid ester such as a lower alkylcarbonyloxy group, provided that one of A, B, D', D^ and D^ is a group being substituted by an 0X0 group, and that both D^ and D^ should not simultaneously be a vinylene group being optionally substituted by a lower alkyl group.<br>
The processes for preparing the present compounds (I-a) and (II) are explained below.<br>
The structure of the present compound (I-a) is a tripeptide derivative wherein two amino acids bond to one proline at each end thereof.    Therefore, the present compound (I-a) may be prepared mainly by amidation reaction.<br>
For example, the present compounds (I-a) and (II) may be prepared by the following reaction scheme (Reaction Scheme 1) as mentioned below.<br>
The protecting group R for carboxyl group in Reaction Scheme 1 may be any one that does not disturb the desired main reaction and can be easily removed without breaking the other partial structure when desired.   The protecting group R for carboxyl group can be classified<br><br>
into two categories in terms of the methods for removal thereof.   One of the methods for removal thereof is acid-base decomposition, and the other one is hydrogenolysis.    The protecting group for carbo3^1 group being able to be removed by acid-base decomposition is, for example, methyl, ethyl, tert-butyl, trityl, methoxymethyl, benzyl, phenyl, phenacyl, etc., and the protecting group for carboxyl group being able to be removed by hydrogenolysis is, for example, benzyl, trityl, ben^loxy-methyl, etc.<br>
Although W in Reaction Scheme 1 is as explained above, W is preferably a hydroxy group or a halogen atom, X^ is a halogen atom, and other symbols are as defined above.<br><br><br>
In the above Reaction Scheme 1, Step 1 is a step of reacting the known compounds (III) and (IV) to give the compound (V).    This step is carried out by mixing with stirring two starting compounds in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride, lithium tert-butoxide, etc.,<br><br>
in a solvent such as anhydrous dimethylformamide.   This step is carried out at a temperature of from 0 to 45°C for 0.5 to 20 hours.<br>
Step 2 is a step of reacting the compound (V) obtained in Step 1 with the compound (VI} to give the compound (VII).   This reaction is carried out in the same manner as in Step 1.    In this step, the protecting group R for carboxyl group in the compound (VI) may be the same ones as that in the compound (IV), but preferably different ones. For example, when one of the protecting groups is one to be decomposed with acid-base such as tert-butyl group, then the other should be one to be decomposed by hydrogenolysis such as benzyl group.<br>
The compound (VII) thus obtained can be used as a starting compound in Step 3.    Step 3 is carried out by removing the protecting group R for carboxyl group binding to B in the compound (VII) to give the compound (II') wherein W is a hydros group, and then if necessary, followed by converting it into a halogen atom, etc.<br>
The acid-base decomposition, which is one of the methods for removing a protecting group R for carboxyl group, is carried out by contacting the above compound (VII) with an acid or a base at -30 to lOCC, preferably at a temperature of from CC to room temperature in a solvent.   The acid includes, for example, trifluoroacetic acid, hydro¬chloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, etc., and the base includes, for example, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, etc.      The solvent may be water, ethanol, methylene chloride, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, benzene, toluene, or a mixture of these solvents.<br><br>
triethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, preferably N-methylmorpholine, and then further reacting the resultant with the compound (VIII).<br>
Most of the compounds (VIII) are known compounds, and a compound (VIII) which is not known may be prepared by the m,ethod disclosed in Example 6 or 7 as described below or a modified method thereof.<br>
The present compound (I-d) (OH-compound) thus obtained is a novel compound, and can be used as a direct starting compound in the preparation of the present compound (I-b) (ketone compound) which is useful as an elastase inhibitor.    Step 5 is a step of oxidizing the hydroxy group of the compound (I-d), and then if necessary removing the protecting group for carboxyl group by a method as explained above.   The oxidation reaction of this step is carried out by treating the compound (I-d) with an oxidizing agent in a solvent such as methylene chloride, dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, toluene, etc.<br>
The oxidizing agent includes a Dess-Martin reagent, which is a iodobenzene derivative.    Besides, oxidation with phosphorus pentoxide in the presence of dimethylsulfoxide, oxidation with l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide-Cl2CHCOOH in the presence of dimethylsulfoxide, and oxidation with a combination of oxalyl chloride and triethylamine (Swern oxidation) are also applicable.<br>
Throughout all of the steps, when a free amino group or carboxyl group exists in the D-moiety, it is preferable to protect these groups with a conventional protecting group, if necessary, and then to remove said protecting group at an appropriate step.<br><br>
When the present compound thus obtained is an ester compound, it can be converted into a carbojcylic acid compound, or when the present compound is a carboxylic acid compound, then it can be converted into an ester compound, or can be converted into a salt thereof.   In addition, when the present compound is in the form of various isomers, then these isomers can be separated by a conventional method.<br>
