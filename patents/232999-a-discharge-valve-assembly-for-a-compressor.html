				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to refrigerator compressor. More particularly, the<br>
present invention relates to a discharge valve assembly for a compressor which<br>
incorporates a unique design for the discharge valve retainers which improve the<br>
reliability and the performance of the refrigeration compressor<br>
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
{0002} Reciprocating piston type compressors typically employ suction and<br>
discharge pressure actuated valve assemblies mounted onto a valve plate assembly which<br>
is located at end of a cylinder defined by a compressor body. The valve plate assembly is<br>
typically sandwiched between a compressor head and the body of the compressor. A<br>
valve plate gasket is located between the valve plate assembly and the compressor body<br>
to seal this interface and a head gasket is located between the valve plate assembly and<br>
the compressor head to seal this interface.<br>
[0003] The discharge valve assembly typically includes a discharge valve member<br>
which engages a valve seat defined by the valve plate assembly, a discharge valve<br>
retainer to attach the discharge valve member to the valve plate assembly and a discharge<br>
cpring which is. disposed between the discharge valve member and the discharge valve<br>
 to bias the discharge valve..............................................................<br>
member into engagement with the valve seat defined by the valve plate<br>
assembly.<br>
[0004] An important design objective for the reciprocating compressor<br>
is to minimize the re-expansion or clearance volume in the cylinder when the<br>
piston reaches top dead center. The minimizing of this re-expansion or<br>
clearance volume helps to maximize the capacity and efficiency of the<br>
reciprocating compressor. In order to minimize this re-expansion or clearance<br>
volume, the valving system and the cylinder top end wall should have a shape<br>
which is complimentary with the shape of the piston to enable the piston to<br>
reduce the volume of the compression chamber to a minimum when the piston is<br>
at top dead center of its stroke without restricting gas flow. While it may be<br>
possible to accomplish this objective by designing a complex piston head shape,<br>
manufacturing of this complex shape becomes excessively expensive, the<br>
assembly becomes more difficult and throttling losses generally occur as the<br>
piston approaches top dead center.<br>
[0005] Prior art suction valve assemblies and discharge valve<br>
assemblies have been developed to meet the above defined design criteria<br>
relating to re-expansion or clearance volume and these valve assemblies have<br>
performed satisfactory in the prior art compressors.<br>
[0006] One area that can provide additional benefits to the<br>
reciprocating piston type compressors is in the area of compressed gas flow. As<br>
the piston begins its compression stroke, the gas within the compression<br>
chamber is compressed and eventually the discharge valve assembly opens to<br>
allow the compressed gas to flow into the discharge chamber. The compressed<br>
gas must flow past all of the components of the discharge valve assembly and<br>
thus the design of these components are critical to ensure that the flow of<br>
compressed gas is not restricted and therefore any throttling losses are reduced<br>
or eliminated.<br>
[0007] The present invention provides the art with a unique design for<br>
the discharge valve retainer which improves gas flow to minimize and/or<br>
eliminate throttling losses associated with the compressed gas flow. The<br>
discharge valve retainer of the present invention is manufactured using a powder<br>
metal process utilizing a retainer material and density that define and optimize<br>
the retainer's structural, reliability and performance. In addition, the geometry of<br>
the discharge valve retainer has been optimized to deliver the best performance.<br>
[0008] Further areas of applicability of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be<br>
understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating<br>
the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of<br>
illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0019] The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses. There is shown in Figures 1-8 and compressor assembly 10<br>
which incorporates the unique discharge valve retainer in accordance with the<br>
present invention. Compressor assembly 10 comprises a compressor body 12, a<br>
compressor head 14 a head gasket 16, a valve plate assembly 18 and a valve<br>
plate gasket 20.<br>
[0020] Compressor body 12 defines a pair of compression cylinders 22<br>
within which a piston 24 is slidably disposed. Each compression cylinder 22 is in<br>
communication with both a discharge chamber and a suction chamber through<br>
valve plate assembly 18.<br>
[0021] Valve plate assembly 18 comprises an upper valve plate 26, a<br>
lower valve plate 28, and an annular spacer 30. Valve plate assembly 18 defines<br>
a pair of suction passages 32 which is in communication with the suction<br>
chamber of compression assembly 10 and a pair of discharge passages 34<br>
which are in communication with the discharge chamber of compressor assembly<br>
10. Each discharge passage 34 is defined by a radially inclined or beveled<br>
sidewall 36 extending between an upper surface 38 and a lower surface 40 of<br>
valve plate assembly 18. Beveled sidewall 36 is formed from upper valve plate<br>
26. A surface 42 of side wall 36 provides a valve seat for a discharge valve<br>
member 44 which is urged into sealing engagement therewith by discharge gas<br>
pressure and a spring 46 extending between discharge valve member 44 and a<br>
bridge-like retainer 48.<br>
[0022] As shown, discharge valve member 44 is of a size and a shape<br>
relative to discharge passage 34 so as to place a lower surface 50 thereof in<br>
substantially coplanar relationship to lower surface 40 of valve plate assembly<br>
18. Spring 46 is located in a recess 52 provided in retainer 48. Discharge valve<br>
member 44 is essentially pressure actuated and spring 46 is chosen primarily to<br>
provide stability and also to provide an initial closing bias or preload to establish<br>
an initial seal. Other types of springs, other than that illustrated may of course be<br>
used for this purpose. Retainer 48, which also serves as a stop to limit the<br>
opening movement of valve member 44 is secured to valve plate assembly 18 by<br>
a pair of suitable fasteners 54. <br>
[0023] Annular spacer 30 is disposed between upper valve plate 26<br>
and lower valve plate 28 and annular spacer 30 forms suction passage 32 with<br>
upper valve plate 26 and lower valve plate 28. Valve plate assembly 18 is<br>
secured to compressor body 12 when compressor head 14 is secured to<br>
compressor body 12. Valve plate assembly 18 is sandwiched between<br>
compressor head 14 and compressor body 12 with valve plate gasket 20 being<br>
sandwiched between valve plate assembly 18 and compressor body 12 and<br>
head gasket 16 being sandwiched between valve plate assembly 18 and<br>
compressor head 14.<br>
[0024] A plurality of bolts 60 extend through compressor head 14,<br>
head gasket 16, upper valve plate 26 of valve plate assembly 18, annular spacer<br>
30 of valve plate assembly 18, lower valve plate 28 of valve plate assembly 18,<br>
valve plate gasket 20 and are threadingly received by compressor body 12. The<br>
tightening of bolts 60 compresses valve plate gasket 20 to provide a sealing<br>
relationship between valve plate assembly 18 and compressor body 12 and<br>
compresses head gasket 16 to provide a sealing relationship between valve plate<br>
assembly 18 and compressor head 14.<br>
[0025] Valve plate assembly 18 defines an annular valve seat 70 and<br>
sidewall 36 defines an annular valve seat 72 located at its terminal end.<br>
Disposed between valve seat 70 and valve seat 72 is suction passage 32.<br>
[0026] Valve seat 72 of sidewall 36 is positioned in coplanar<br>
relationship with valve seat 70 of valve plate assembly 18. A suction reed valve<br>
member 76 jn the form of an annular ring sealingly engages, in its closed<br>
position, valve seat 72 of sidewall 36 and valve seat 70 of valve plate assembly<br>
18 to prevent passage of fluid from compression cylinder 22 into suction passage<br>
32. A central opening 78 is provided in suction reed valve member 76 and is<br>
arranged coaxially with discharge passage 34 so as to allow direct gas flow<br>
communication between compression cylinder 22 and lower surface 50 of<br>
discharge valve member 44. Suction reed valve member 76 also includes a pair<br>
of diametrically opposed radially outwardly extending tabs 80. One tab 80 is<br>
used to secure reed valve member 76 to valve plate assembly 18 using a pair of<br>
drive studs 82.<br>
[0027] As piston 24 within compression cylinder 22 moves away<br>
from valve plate assembly 18 during a suction stroke, the pressure differential<br>
between compression cylinder 22 and suction passage 32 will cause suction<br>
reed valve member 76 to deflect inwardly with respect to compression cylinder<br>
22, to its open position (shown in dashed lines in Figure 3), thereby enabling gas<br>
flow from suction passage 32 into compression cylinder 22 between valve seats<br>
70 and 72. Because only tabs 80 of suction reed valve member 76 extend<br>
outwardly beyond the sidewalls of compression cylinder 22, suction gas flow will<br>
readily flow into compression cylinder 22 around substantially the entire inner<br>
and outer peripheries of suction reed valve member 76. As a compression<br>
stroke of piston 24 begins, suction reed valve member 76 will be forced into<br>
sealing engagement with valve seat 70 and valve seat 72. Discharge valve<br>
member 44 will begin to open due to the pressure within compression cylinder 22<br>
exceeding the pressure within discharge passage 34 and the force exerted by<br>
spring 46. The compressed gas will be forced through central opening 78, past<br>
discharge valve member 44 and into discharge passage 34. The concentric<br>
arrangement of valve plate assembly 18 and reed valve member 76,allow<br>
substantially the entire available surface area overlying compression cylinder 22<br>
to be utilized for suction and discharge valving and porting, thereby allowing<br>
maximum gas flow both into and out of compression cylinder 22.<br>
[0028] The continuous stroking of piston 24 within compression<br>
cylinder 22 continuously causes suction reed valve member 76 and discharge<br>
valve member 44 to move between their open and closed positions. Compressor<br>
body 12 includes an angled or curved portion 84 at the outer edge of<br>
compression cylinder 22 adjacent the free end of suction reed valve member 16<br>
to provide a friendly surface for suction reed valve member 76 to bend against,<br>
thereby significantly reducing the bending stresses generated within the free end<br>
tab 80.<br>
[0029] Referring now to Figures the present invention is<br>
directed towards the unique design for discharge valve retainer 48. Discharge<br>
valve retainer 48 comprises a circular central body 100 and a pair of radially<br>
outward extending flanges 102.<br>
[0030] Each flange 102 defines a bore 104 which is utilized to<br>
secure discharge valve retainer 48 to valve plate assembly 18 using a respective<br>
fastener 54.<br>
[0031] Circular central body 100 defines recess 52 within which<br>
spring 46 is located. A plurality of bores 106 located within recess 52 extend<br>
through circular central body 100. Bores 106 allow for flow of compressed<br>
discharge gas to facilitate the movement of discharge valve member 44 and<br>
spring 46 as well as to direct the pressurized gas to the back side of discharge<br>
valve member 44 to bias discharge valve member 44 against the valve seat<br>
defined by surface 42 of sidewall 36.<br>
[0032] An annular recess 110 extends into circular central body<br>
opposite to the side which defines recess 52. Recess 110 provides for a more<br>
consistent wall thickness for discharge valve retainer which helps to achieve<br>
uniform part density, particularly in the top edge, which is a critical requirement<br>
for the functionality of the retainer.<br>
[0033] Referring now specifically to Figure 7, the exterior<br>
configuration of circular central body 100 is illustrated. The exterior configuration<br>
of circular central body 100 is designed to provide better discharge gas flow<br>
which translates into less turbulence and thus better compressor performance.<br>
Starting at the top of recess 52, the exterior configuration of central body 100<br>
comprises a first contoured surface in the form of a first frusto-conical wall 112, a<br>
blending portion 114 and a second contoured surface in the form of a second<br>
frusto-conical wall 116. In the preferred embodiment, first frusto-conical wall 112<br>
forms a 45Â° angle with the axial direction of discharge valve retainer 48 and the<br>
second frusto-conical wall 116 forms a 15Â° angle with the axial direction. The<br>
preferred blending portion 114 is a 0.250 inch radius. The axial direction of<br>
discharge valve retainer 48 is the axial direction of bores 106.<br>
[0034] The preferred material for producing discharge valve<br>
retainer 48 from powder metal is a low alloy steel powder pre alloyed with 1.5<br>
weight percent molybdenum and 0.2 weight percent carbon in the matrix<br>
(obtained by prealloying or admixing graphite). This material is available form<br>
Hoeganaes Corporation under the tradename Ancorsteel Â® 150 HP or from<br>
 HÃ¶ganÃ¤s AB, under tradename Astaloy Mo. which provides optimal structural<br>
properties with a preferred part density of approximately 6.8 to 7.6 gm/cc and<br>
more preferably with a part density of approximate While the above<br>
described material is preferred material, alternate materials that may be used for<br>
discharge valve retainer 48 include but are not limited to FLC4608, FL4405,<br>
FC0205 and FC0208.<br>
[0035] Because surface hardness and functional strength are<br>
critical to the reliability and performance of discharge valve retainer 48,<br>
carbonitriding, quenching and tempering of discharge valve retainer 48 is<br>
preferred to provide a surface hardness to Rockwell 15N 89-93.<br>
[0036] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in<br>
nature and, thus, variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are<br>
intended to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be<br>
regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
