				<td>A Lever-Type Connector And Connector Assembly<br>
The present invention relates to a lever-type connector and connector<br>
assembly.<br>
A lever-type connector is known from Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Publication No. 2003-36932. This connector is assembled in a state where a<br>
lever for connecting a male and a female connector housings is accommodated<br>
in a pocket-shaped lever accommodating chamber formed in a side surface of<br>
one connector housing. The lever accommodating chamber has a double wall<br>
structure comprised of an inner and an outer walls. The lever is rotatably<br>
assembled by being pushed into the lever accommodating chamber from an<br>
end surface side and fitting a supporting shaft projecting into the lever<br>
accommodating chamber into a mount hole penetrating the lever.<br>
In order to fit the supporting shaft into the mount hole of the lever, the<br>
supporting shaft has to be pushed up in a direction opposite to a projecting<br>
direction thereof to provide a clearance (corresponding to the thickness of the<br>
lever) necessary to assemble the lever. For this, a large operation force is<br>
necessary to assemble the lever because of a reaction force resulting from this<br>
deformation to widen the clearance. The clearance may be simply set to have a<br>
large width in order to reduce the operation force, but it leads to a likelihood<br>
that the lever easily comes out of the accommodating chamber. Accordingly, it<br>
has not been conventionally easy to reduce the operation force during the<br>
assembling while preventing the lever from coming out.<br>
The present invention was developed in view of the above situation, and<br>
an object thereof is to provide a lever-type connector and connector assembyl<br>
capable of reducing an operator's burden during the assembling while<br>
preventing a lever from coming out.<br>
This object is solved according to the invention by the features of the<br>
independent claims, preferred embodiments of the invention are subject of the<br>
dependent claims.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a lever-type<br>
connector, comprising:<br>
a housing connectabie with a mating housing,<br>
a lever rotatably or pivotably provided in or on the housing and having a<br>
cam member formed in or on at least one side surface thereof, the cam<br>
member being engageable with a mating cam member provided in or on the<br>
mating housing to display a cam action to perform or assist a connection of the<br>
housing with the mating housing,<br>
wherein the housing is formed with at least one rotation supporting<br>
portion having a clearance that can be widened as the lever is assembled and<br>
is narrowed after the lever is assembled, so that the rotation supporting portion<br>
rotatably or pivotably supports a central part of rotation or pivotal movement of<br>
the lever by holding the lever substantially in thickness direction, and the<br>
clearance is formed to be gradually narrowed from an entrance side toward an<br>
exit side with respect to an assembling direction of the lever.<br>
Accordingly, a peripheral edge portion of the lever is pushed into the<br>
clearance of the rotation supporting portion upon at least partly assembling the<br>
lever into the housing. At this time, the clearance is resiliently deformed to be<br>
widened, thereby permitting the assembling of the lever and is resiliency at<br>
least partly restored to be narrowed thereafter, so that the rotation supporting<br>
portion rotatably or pivotably supports the lever by holding the substantially<br>
central part of rotation or pivotal movement of the lever. With the lever<br>
completely assembled, the clearance of the rotation supporting portion is<br>
narrower at the exit side than at the entrance side with respect to the<br>
assembling direction. This is effective in preventing the detachment of the lever.<br>
Conversely, since the clearance is wider at the entrance side, resistance during<br>
the assembling of the lever can be suppressed low.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, there is further<br>
provided a lever-type connector assembly, comprising:<br>
a first housing,<br>
a lever rotatably provided in a first housing and having a cam groove<br>
formed in a side surface thereof,<br>
a second hQusing connectable with the first housing, and<br>
a cam pin formed on the second housing and guidable along the cam<br>
groove as the lever is rotated, thereby connecting the first and second<br>
housings,<br>
wherein the first housing is formed with a rotation supporting portion<br>
having a clearance that can be widened as the lever is assembled and is<br>
narrowed after the lever is assembled, so that the rotation supporting portion<br>
rotatably supports a central part of rotation of the lever by holding the lever in<br>
thickness direction, and the clearance is formed to be gradually narrowed from<br>
an entrance side toward an exit side with respect to an assembling direction of<br>
the lever.<br>
Accordingly, a peripheral edge portion of the lever is pushed into the<br>
clearance of the rotation supporting portion upon assembling the lever into the<br>
first housing. At this time, the clearance is resiliency deformed to be widened,<br>
thereby permitting the assembling of the lever and is resiliency restored to be<br>
narrowed thereafter, so that the rotation supporting portion rotatably supports<br>
the lever by holding the central part of rotation of the lever. With the lever<br>
completely assembled, the clearance of the rotation supporting portion is<br>
narrower at the exit side than at the entrance side with respect to the<br>
assembling direction. This is effective in preventing the detachment of the lever.<br>
Conversely, since the clearance is wider at the entrance side, resistance during<br>
the assembling of the lever can be suppressed low.<br>
Preferbly, the cam member is arranged before the central part of rotation<br>
with respect to the assembling direction.<br>
Further preferably, a specified (predetermined or predeterminable)<br>
lengthwise area of the cam member is formed to extend substantially along the<br>
assembling direction of the lever when the lever is assembled into the housing.<br>
Most preferably, the cam groove is arranged before the central part of<br>
rotation with respect to the assembling direction, and a specified lengthwise<br>
area is formed to extend along the assembling direction of the lever when the<br>
lever is assembled into the first housing.<br>
Upon being assembled, the lever is gradually moved from the peripheral<br>
edge portion toward the central part of rotation relative to the clearance.<br>
According to the above, an operator's burden during the lever assembling<br>
operation can be reduced since the bored or thinned part (specified lengthwise<br>
area of the cam groove) of the lever is arranged substantially on an assembling<br>
line of the lever to shorten the length of the thick part passing the clearance as<br>
much as possible.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the lever is<br>
recessed substantially at the central part of rotation to form a mount hole.<br>
Preferably, the rotation supporting portion includes at least one pair of<br>
projections substantially opposed to each other in the thickness direction of the<br>
lever in the housing and at least partly fittable into the mount hole while defining<br>
the clearance therebetween.<br>
Further preferably, the rotation supporting portion, preferably the<br>
projections, is/are formed with one or more detachment preventing surfaces<br>
that come substantially into contact with the wall of the mount hole when a<br>
force is exerted from the mating cam member to the cam member to push back<br>
the lever in a direction opposite to the assembling direction as the lever is<br>
rotated.<br>
Still further preferably, the lever is recessed at the central part of rotation<br>
to form a mount hole,<br>
the rotation supporting portion includes a pair of projections opposed to<br>
each other in the thickness direction of the lever in the first housing and fittable<br>
into the mount hole while defining the clearance therebetween, and<br>
the projections are formed with detachment preventing surfaces that<br>
come into contact with the wall of the mount hole when a force is exerted from<br>
the cam pin to the cam groove to push back the lever in a direction opposite to<br>
the assembling direction as the lever is rotated.<br>
A force trying to displace the lever in a detaching direction may be<br>
exerted from the cam pin to the wall of the cam groove upon connecting or<br>
5<br>
separating the first and second housings by rotating the lever. According to the<br>
above, the detachment preventing surfaces formed on the projections come<br>
into contact with the wall of the mount hole of the lever. This can avoid such a<br>
movement of the lever as to come out of the first housing during the rotating<br>
operation, thereby ensuring a smooth lever operation.<br>
Further preferably, the cam member comprises a cam groove, wherein<br>
the entrance of the cam groove preferably is located on the axis of symmetry<br>
passing the mount hole of the lever with the lever located at the standby<br>
position.<br>
Still further preferably, one or more resilient locking pieces are provided<br>
for holding the lever at the standby position, wherein the resilient locking pieces<br>
are arranged preferably at a position of the lever adjacent to the entrance of the<br>
cam groove.<br>
Most preferably, one or more disengagement ribs project at the<br>
(preferably substantially opposite) widthwise side(s) of the mating cam member,<br>
wherein the disengagement rib(s) function(s) to free the lever partly locked in its<br>
standby state, and preferably extend substantially in a connecting direction of<br>
the connector housing with the mating connector housing.<br>
According to the invention, there is further provided a lever-type<br>
connector assembly comprising a lever-type connector according to the<br>
invention or a preferred embodiment thereof and a mating connector housing<br>
connectable therewith.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method<br>
of assembling lever-type connector assembly, in particular according to the<br>
invention or a preferred embodiment thereof, comprising the following steps:<br>
providing a first housing,<br>
assembling a lever rotatably in or on the first housing, the lever having a<br>
cam groove formed in a side surface thereof,<br>
providing a second housing connectable with the first housing having a<br>
cam pin formed thereon,<br>
rotating or pivoting the lever, thereby guiding the cam pin along the cam<br>
groove and connecting the first and second housings or assisting their<br>
connection,<br>
wherein in the assembling step a clearance of a rotation supporting<br>
portion of the first housing is widened and is narrowed after the lever is<br>
assembled, so that the rotation supporting portion rotatably supports a central<br>
part of rotation of the lever by holding the lever in thickness direction, wherein<br>
the clearance is formed to be gradually narrowed from an entrance side toward<br>
an exit side with respect to an assembling direction of the lever.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present<br>
invention will become more apparent upon reading of the following detailed<br>
description of preferred embodiments and accompanying drawings. It should be<br>
understood that even though embodiments are separately described, single<br>
features thereof may be combined to additional embodiments.<br>

FIG. 9 is a plan view of the lever, and<br>
FIG. 10 is a side view of the lever.<br>
One preferred embodiment of the present invention is described with<br>
reference to FIGS. 1 to 10. A lever-type connector according to this<br>
embodiment is such that a female connector housing 1 (corresponding to %<br>
preferred first housing) and a male connector housing 2 (corresponding to a<br>
preferred second housing) are connected and separated (or their connection<br>
and separation is assisted) along a connecting direction GD by means of a<br>
lever 3 (as a preferred operable member) provided in the female connector<br>
housing 1.<br>
First, the male connector housing 2 is described with reference to FIGS.<br>
6 to 8. The male connector housing 2 is integrally or unitarily made e.g. of a<br>
synthetic resin material and, a receptacle 6 preferably substantially in the form<br>
of a rectangular tube having an open front side is formed before a terminal<br>
accommodating portion 5 for at least partly accommodating one or more male<br>
terminal fittings 4. One or more, preferably a multitude of cavities 7 are formed<br>
to penetrate the terminal accommodating portion 5 substantially in forward and<br>
backward directions, and the one or more respective male terminal fittings 4<br>
can be at least partly accommodated thereinto from an insertion side,<br>
preferably substantially from behind. Preferably, a plurality of kinds of cavities 7<br>
are set because a plurality of kinds of male terminal fittings 4 are mounted<br>
thereinto in this embodiment. In each cavity 7, a locking portion 8 is resiliency<br>
deformably provided to be engaged with the corresponding male terminal fitting<br>
4 to retain it. The male terminal fitting 4 preferably is connected, preferably<br>
crimped into connection, with a waterproof rubber plug 9 (as a preferred<br>
fluidproof resilient plug) mounted on a wire, and sealing is provided between<br>
the wire and the wall surface of the cavity 7 by the close contact of the<br>
waterproof rubber plug 9 with the inner wall surface of each cavity 7.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, a retainer 10 preferably is mounted into (preferably a<br>
front end side of) the terminal accommodating portion 5 (preferably from front)<br>
to at least partly enter deformation spaces for the locking portions 8, thereby<br>
preventing the locking portions 8 from being resiliency deformed in a<br>
disengaging direction from the male terminal fittings 4. It should be understood<br>
that the retainer may be also of the side-insertion type e.g. in case of a nonwaterproof<br>
connector or may be omitted completely e.g. if no fluid-tightness is<br>
necessary.<br>
A cam pin 11 projects at a widthwise intermediate position (preferably<br>
substantially at a widthwise center position) of the lateral (upper) surface of the<br>
receptacle 6 preferably near or at the front end. The cam pin 11 preferably is<br>
substantially cylindrical, and a flange edge 11A bulges out along at least part of<br>
the circumference, preferably the substantially entire circumference at or near<br>
the leading end thereof. The flange edge 11A is engaged with the substantially<br>
opposite edges of a cam groove 12 while the cam pin 11 is displaced in the<br>
cam groove 12 to be described later. Further, one or more, preferably a pair of<br>
disengagement ribs 13 project at the (preferably substantially opposite)<br>
widthwise side(s) of the cam pin 11. The (preferably both) disengagement rib(s)<br>
13 function to free the lever 3 partly locked in its standby state, and extend<br>
substantially in a connecting direction CD of the two connector housings 1, 2.<br>
The female connector housing 1 is integrally or unitarily made e.g. of a<br>
synthetic resin material and includes an inner tubular portion 15 formed with<br>
one or more, preferably a multitude of cavities 14 penetrating the inner tubular<br>
portion 15 substantially in forward and backward directions. There are as many<br>
kinds of the cavities 14 of the inner tubular portion 15 as the cavities 7 of the<br>
male connector housing 2, wherein each cavity 14 has a locking portion 16<br>
resiliency deforrnable at least partly into the cavity 14 to be engaged with a<br>
female terminal fitting 17. Each female terminal fitting 17 is comprised of a<br>
(preferably substantially rectangular) tube portion 17A for the connection with<br>
the male terminal fitting 4 and a wire connecting portion (preferably comprising<br>
a barrel portion 17B) continuously provided behind the (rectangular) tube<br>
portion 17A to connected (preferably be crimped or bent or folded into<br>
connection) with a wire. A waterproof rubber plug 18 (as a preferred fluid-proof<br>
resilient plug) is to be mounted on an insulation coating of the wire behind or<br>
adjacent to the barrel portion 17B, and sealing is provided between the wire<br>
and the inner surface of the cavity 14 by the substantially close contact of the<br>
outer circumferential surface of the waterproof rubber plug 18 with the inner<br>
circumferential surface of the cavity 14. A (preferably substantially cap-shaped)<br>
retainer 19 is mountable on or to a front end portion of the inner tubular portion<br>
15 preferably substantially from front, and the resilient deformations of the<br>
locking portions 16 can be prevented by the at least partial entrance of leading<br>
end portions of this retainer 19 into deformation spaces for the locking portions<br>
The receptacle 6 of the male connector housing 2 is at least partly<br>
insertable into a clearance between the above described inner tubular portion<br>
15 and an outer tubular portion 20. A (preferably substantially tubular) seal ring<br>
22 made of rubber or resilient material is mounted on or to the outer<br>
circumferential surface of the inner tubular portion 15 preferably at an<br>
intermediate position (preferably near a substantially middle part) of the inner<br>
tubular portion 15 with respect to forward and backward directions. In a shown<br>
example, one or more, preferably three lips are formed on the outer<br>
circumferential surface of the seal ring 22 to be brought substantially into close<br>
contact with the inner circumferential surface of the receptacle 6, thereby<br>
providing sealing between the female and male connector housings 1, 2.<br>
A lever accommodating space 21 for at least partly accommodating the<br>
lever 3 is formed at a lateral (preferably upper) side of the outer tubular portion<br>
20. This lever accommodating space 21 penetrates substantially in forward and<br>
backward directions, and a (preferably substantially rectangular) cutout 23 is<br>
formed at or near a front side of the inner (preferably lower) surface of the lever<br>
accommodating space 21 of the outer tubular portion 20 to substantially<br>
communicate the lever accommodating space 21 with an inner space of the<br>
outer tubular portion 20. At the time of connecting the female and male<br>
connector housings 1, 2, both the cam pin 11 and the two disengagement ribs<br>
13 are displaceable at least partly in this cutout 23. Further, a rotation<br>
supporting portion 24 for rotatably or pivotably supporting the lever 3 is provided<br>
in or at the lever accommodating space 21. The rotation supporting portion 24<br>
is described in detail later.<br>
First, the lever 3 is described. The lever 3 is made e.g. of a synthetic<br>
resin material and preferably includes a main plate 25 having an arcuate<br>
peripheral edge, for example, as shown in FIGS. 9 and 10. An operable portion<br>
26 slightly bulging out backward and/or radially outward is provided at or near<br>
one corner portion at or near the rear edge of the main plate 25. In this<br>
embodiment, the lever 3 preferably substantially is vertically symmetrically<br>
shaped so as to be mountable into the lever accommodating space 21 even if<br>
being turned upside down. Thus, a rotating direction of the lever 3 can be<br>
selected depending on an installed state and the like of the connector.<br>
Regardless of its mounting posture, the lever 3 is rotatably mountable between<br>
a standby position SP and a connecting position CP in the lever<br>
accommodating space 21. Here, the standby position SP is a position of the<br>
lever 3 where the cam pin 11 can be received substantially straight into the cam<br>
groove 12 of the lever 3 as the female and male connector housings 1, 2 are<br>
initially connected as shown in FIG. 1, and the connecting position CP is a<br>
position of the lever 3 where the two connector housings" 1, 2 are substantially<br>
completely connected as shown in FIG. 2.<br>
A (preferably substantially round) mount hole 27 is formed to recess or<br>
penetrate the main plate 25 preferably substantially in the center. The cam<br>
groove 12 is formed before (closer to the arcuate peripheral edge) the mount<br>
hole 27 in the main plate 25. The cam groove 12 has an open end at the<br>
arcuate peripheral edge of the main plate 25. An introducing path 12A extends<br>
preferably substantially straight from this open end toward the mount hole 27<br>
and then a cam action path 12B follows substantially in parallel with a straight<br>
section of the peripheral edge of the main plate 25 while being at an angle<br>
different from 0° or 180° to the introducing path 12A. The back end of the cam<br>
action path 12B is located at a position slightly beyond the mount hole 27. One<br>
or more resilient locking pieces 28 for holding or positioning the lever 3 at the<br>
standby position SP are arranged preferably at a position of the main plate 25<br>
adjacent to the entrance of the cam groove 12. The resilient locking pieces 28<br>
preferably are in the form of cantilevers projecting in substantially opposite<br>
directions along the thickness direction TD of the main plate 25, wherein one<br>
end of each resilient locking piece 28 is coupled and the other end thereof is a<br>
free end, and are resiliency deformable substantially along vertical direction<br>
(thickness direction TD). The free end of one resilient locking piece 28 is<br>
engaged or engageable with a part of the inner wall surface of the lever<br>
accommodating space 21 to prevent the lever 3 from rotating or pivoting or<br>
moving toward the connecting position CP when the lever 3 i§ at the standby<br>
position SP. Further, the resilient locking piece 28 preferably is located on the<br>
entrance path of the corresponding disengagement rib 13 of the male<br>
connector housing 2 when the lever 3 is at the standby position SP, and is<br>
automatically disengaged from the inner wall surface of the lever<br>
accommodating space 21 by the disengagement rib 13 when the female and<br>
male connector housings 1, 2 are lightly fitted to each other.<br>
A lock piece 29 is arranged at a position of the main plate 25 adjacent to<br>
the operable portion 26. This lock piece 29 preferably is in the form of a<br>
cantilever extending substantially toward the operable portion 26, and is<br>
resiliency deformable along vertical direction (thickness direction TD of the<br>
13<br>
main plate 25). One or more lock projections 30 project upward and downward<br>
in an intermediate part (preferably substantially in the longitudinal middle part)<br>
of the lock piece 29. When the lever 3 is at the connecting position CP, one<br>
lock projection 30 is engaged with one of a pair of return preventing portions 31<br>
formed at substantially symmetrical positions in the lever accommodating space<br>
21, whereby the lever 3 can be held or positioned at the connecting position<br>
CP.<br>
One or both upper and lower surfaces of the main plate 25 are recessed<br>
inwardly with respect to the thickness direction TD of the main plate 25 in areas<br>
where a front end portion of the lock piece 29 are formed, thereby forming one<br>
or more holding step portions 32. When the lever 3 is at the standby position<br>
SP, one holding step portion 32 is engaged with the corresponding return<br>
preventing portion 31 so that the lever 3 can be held or positioned at the<br>
standby position SP.<br>
Further, one or both upper and lower surfaces of the main plate 25 are<br>
recessed from an intermediate position of the cam action path 12B of the cam<br>
groove 12 toward the mount hole 27, i.e. on an axial line substantially<br>
connecting the introducing path 12A of the cam groove 12 and the mount hole<br>
27, thereby forming escaping grooves 33. These one or more escaping grooves<br>
33 are provided for letting supporting shafts 34 to be described later at least<br>
partly escape before reaching the mount hole 27 upon mounting the lever 3 into<br>
the lever accommodating space 21. Further, a slant 35 having an upward or<br>
downward inclination preferably is formed at an end of each escaping groove<br>
33 toward the mount hole 27, so that the supporting shaft 34 can smoothly<br>
move onto the main plate 25. Furthermore, one or more escaping grooves 36<br>
14'<br>
for letting the return preventing portions 31 at least partly escape upon at least<br>
partly mounting the lever 3 into the lever accommodating space 21 are formed<br>
at positions of the upper and/or lower surfaces of the main plate 25 slightly<br>
before the holding step portions 32. These escaping grooves 36 are formed<br>
substantially in an assembling direction AD of the lever 3 by recessing, and one<br>
or more slants 37 for smoothing movements of the return preventing portions<br>
31 onto the main plate 25 are formed at or near ends of the escaping grooves<br>
36 near the holding step portions 32. On the other hand, one or more recesses<br>
38 are formed at a side of the rear edge of the lever 3 substantially opposite to<br>
the operable portion 26. These recesses 38 function to let the corresponding<br>
return preventing portions 31 at least partly escape when the lever 3 is mounted<br>
into the lever accommodating space 21. Further, one recess 38 is engaged with<br>
the corresponding return preventing portion 31 when the lever 3 is at the<br>
connecting position CP, whereby the lever 3 can be held or positioned at the<br>
connecting position,<br>
The rotation supporting portion 24 arranged in or at the leve/<br>
accommodating space 21 preferably is at a relatively back position on the<br>
widthwise center line of the female connector housing 1. The lever<br>
accommodating space 21 preferably is substantially transversely symmetrically<br>
formed with respect to this widthwise center line. The rotation supporting<br>
portion 24 is formed by one or more (substantially cylindrical) supporting shafts<br>
34 coaxially projecting from the upper and/or lower surfaces of the lever<br>
accommodating space 21 preferably so as to be substantially opposed to each<br>
other. Both supporting shafts 34 are at least partly fitted into the mount hole 27<br>
to make the entire lever 3 rotatable or pivotable about the supporting shafts 34.<br>
Upon being mounted into the lever accommodating space 21, the lever 3 is<br>
inserted from a lever insertion side, preferably substantially from behind, such<br>
that the plate surfaces thereof substantially are vertically opposed to each other<br>
while forcibly deforming the lever accommodating space 21 to widen the<br>
clearance between the supporting shafts 34. When the supporting shafts 34<br>
come to be substantially aligned with the mount hole 27, the supporting shafts<br>
34 at least partly return and the lever 3 is at least partly accommodated into the<br>
lever accommodating space 21. As shown in FIG. 5, one or more slants 39<br>
preferably having the substantially same inclination are formed at end surfaces<br>
of both supporting shafts 34 so that the clearance between the tips of the<br>
supporting shafts 34 becomes gradually narrower from the entrance side<br>
toward the exit side along the assembling direction AD (direction of an arrow in<br>
FIG. 5). The clearance between the supporting shafts 34 at the entrance side<br>
preferably is set such that an operation force exerted to the lever 3 is about the<br>
same as before, and the clearance therebetween at the exit side is set<br>
maximally narrow while ensuring the sufficient strength of a mold pin of a mold<br>
in view of the operation force during the assembling. With the (preferably both)<br>
upper and/or lower supporting shafts 34 at least partly fitted in the mount hole<br>
27, the outer circumferential surfaces of the supporting shafts 34 are<br>
substantially in close contact with the hole wall of the mount hole 27.<br>
Particularly, parts of the supporting shafts 34 that are substantially in contact<br>
with the wall of the mount hole 27 and resist the detachment of the lever 3<br>
function as detachment preventing surfaces 40.<br>
Next, functions and effects of this embodiment constructed as above are<br>
specifically described. When the receptacle 6 of the male connector housing 2<br>
16<br>
is initially lightly fitted into the female connector housing 1 with the lever 3 held<br>
or positioned at the standby position SP, the cam pin 11 at least partly enters<br>
the entrance of the introducing path 12A of the cam groove 12. At this time, one<br>
disengagement rib 13 comes substantially into contact with the corresponding<br>
resilient locking piece 28, which is resiliency deformed by moving onto the<br>
disengagement rib 13 to disengage the resilient locking piece 28 and the inner<br>
wall surface of the lever accommodating space 21. Thus, the lever 3 can rotate<br>
or pivot in a rotation direction RD (in counterclockwise direction in FIG. 1). If the<br>
operable portion 26 is pushed to rotate or pivot the lever 3 about the supporting<br>
shafts 34 in this state, the lever 3 reaches the connecting position CP shown in<br>
FIG. 2. In the meantime, the cam pin 11 is guided by the cam groove 12,<br>
whereby the connecting operation of the two connector housings 1, 2<br>
progresses or is assisted. When the lever 3 substantially reaches the<br>
connecting position CP, the two connector housings 1, 2 are substantially<br>
completely connected and one lock projection 30 of the lock piece 29 is<br>
engaged with the corresponding return preventing portion 31 to lock the lever 3.<br>
Converse to the above, in the case of separating the two connector<br>
housings 1, 2, the operable portion 26 is gripped to rotate or pivot the lever 3 in<br>
a direction substantially opposite to the rotation direction RD (clockwise) while<br>
the lock piece 29 is pushed down to be disengaged from the return preventing<br>
portion 31. In this way, the cam pin 11 is guided by the cam groove 12 to<br>
separate (or assist the separation of) the two connector housings 1, 2.<br>
Upon assembling the lever 3 into the female connector housing 1, the<br>
lever 3 is located at an insertion side of, preferably substantially behind, the<br>
lever accommodating space 21. More specifically, the lever 3 is at least partly<br>
inserted into the lever accommodating space 21 while being oriented such that<br>
the entrance of the cam groove 12 is located substantially in the widthwise<br>
center of the female connector housing 1 and the introducing path 12A of the<br>
cam groove 12 extend substantially along the connecting direction CD of the<br>
two connector housings 1, 2. Then, both supporting shafts 34 relatively move<br>
along the introducing path 12A of the cam groove 12 to come substantially into<br>
contact with the starting point of the ascent of the escaping groove 33. If the<br>
lever 3 is strongly pushed in this state, a part of the lever 3 between the bottom<br>
surfaces of the escaping grooves 33 in the upper and/or lower surfaces of the<br>
lever 3 thrusts itself between the two supporting shafts 34 while resiliency and<br>
vertically widening the clearance between the supporting shafts 34. When the<br>
facing surfaces of the supporting shafts 34 pass the bottom surfaces of the<br>
escaping grooves 33 and come to be substantially aligned with the mount hole<br>
27, the supporting shafts 34 resiliency at least partly return. As a result, the<br>
supporting shafts 34 are at least partly fitted into the mount hole 27 to rotatably<br>
or pivotably mount the entire lever 3.<br>
As described above, the clearance between the supporting shafts 34<br>
preferably is formed to become narrower from the entrance side toward the exit<br>
side with respect to the assembling direction AD of the lever 3. Specifically, the<br>
entrance side of the clearance is set wide to such a degree as not to burden an<br>
operator's pushing operation, whereas the exit side thereof is set narrow to<br>
such a degree as to ensure the minimum strength of the mold pin. Thus, a<br>
function of preventing the detachment of the lever 3 can be improved without<br>
increasing the burden on the assembling operation of the lever 3. Further, in<br>
this embodiment, the operator's burden is also mitigated by maximally<br>
shortening a moving distance of the supporting shafts 34 to the mount hole 27<br>
by locating the introducing path 12A of the cam groove 12 along an assembling<br>
path of the lever 3.<br>
On the other hand, when the lever 3 is rotated or pivoted in a direction to<br>
separate the two connector housings 1, 2 as described above, the cam pin 11<br>
is pulled toward the inner one of the inner and outer edges of the cam groove<br>
12 that is closer to the supporting shafts 34, thereby exerting a pushing force on<br>
this groove edge. This pushing force acts to detach the lever 3 from the<br>
supporting shafts 34. However, in this embodiment, the detachment of the lever<br>
3 that might occur during the separating operation can be securely avoided<br>
since the detachment preventing surfaces 40 of the supporting shafts 34 and<br>
the cam pin 11 are in surface contact in a direction at an angle different from 0°<br>
or 180°, preferably substantially normal to a detaching direction of the lever 3.<br>
Although the lever 3 is so assembled into the female connector housing<br>
1 as to rotate or pivot counterclockwise from the standby position SP toward the<br>
connecting position CP in the above description, the lever 3 may be assembled<br>
in a transversely reversed posture in this embodiment. To this end, the lever 3<br>
preferably substantially is vertically symmetrically shaped, the entrance of the<br>
cam groove 12 is located on the axis of symmetry passing the mount hole 27 of<br>
the lever 3 with the lever 3 located at the standby position SP, and/or the<br>
constructions of the housings such as the return preventing portions 31 and the<br>
disengagement ribs 13 are also substantially symmetrically arranged. By<br>
enabling the lever 3 to be assembled in a transversely reversed posture, an<br>
operating direction of the lever 3 can be selected in consideration of operational<br>
convenience according to an installation environment of the connector.<br>
Accordingly, to facilitate the assembling of a lever while improving a<br>
function of preventing the detachment of the lever, a female connector housing<br>
1 is formed with a lever accommodating space 21, One or more, preferably a<br>
pair of supporting shafts 34 substantially coaxially project from the upper and/or<br>
lower inner surfaces of the lever accommodating space 21 to substantially face<br>
each other while defining a clearance therebetween, and a lever 3 is formed<br>
with at least one mount hole 27. Upon assembling the lever 3, the supporting<br>
shaft(s) 34 is/are at least partly fitted into the mount hole 27 while forcibly<br>
widening the clearance between the supporting shafts 34, whereby the lever 3<br>
is rotatably or pivotably held. Since the clearance between the supporting<br>
shafts 34 preferably is formed to be wider at an entrance side and narrower at<br>
an exit side with respect to an assembling direction, the detachment of the lever<br>
can be strongly resisted while resistance during an assembling operation is<br>
maximally suppressed.<br>
Other EmbodimentsThe present invention is not limited to the above described and<br>
illustrated embodiment. For example, the following embodiments are also<br>
embraced by the technical scope of the present invention as defined by the<br>
claims. Beside the following embodiments, various changes can be made<br>
without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention as defined<br>
by the claims.<br>
(1) Although the lever 3 is formed with the mount hole 27 and the<br>
supporting shafts 34 project in the lever accommodating space 21 to rotatably<br>
or pivotably support the lever 3 in the foregoing embodiment, a projectionrecess<br>
relationship may be reversed, i.e. the supporting shafts 34 may project<br>
20<br>
from the lever 3 and recesses for receiving the supporting shafts 34 may be<br>
formed in the wall surfaces of the lever accommodating space 21. In such a<br>
case, a clearance between the wall surfaces where the recesses are formed is<br>
made wider at an entrance side.<br>
(2) The lever 3 is not limited to the form of a single plate, and may be<br>
U-shaped as a whole by coupling a pair of plate members each formed with the<br>
cam groove 12 by an operable portion.<br>
(3) Although a pair of supporting shafts are formed on the upper and<br>
lower inner surfaces of the lever accommodating space in the foregoing<br>
embodiment, one supporting shaft may be formed on either one of the upper<br>
and lower surfaces.<br>
