				<td>A Intelligent Data Scheduling Method of Short Message System<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to all kinds of short-message systems in the telecommunication field, particularly, relates to a data scheduling method in the short<br>
message system.<br>
Background Art<br>
Being the most important value-added service in the telecommunication industry, the short-message service is playing an increasingly important role. The short-message system or similar products are set in all of the existing networks of CDMA, GSM and fixed telephone. While bringing convenient services for subscribers and rich profits for operators, the short-message system are facing with increasingly strict requirements from all aspects. Nowadays the security and robustness of short-message system have already leveled up with chief equipments such as exchangers. It becomes a basic requirement to ensure the short-message system operate smoothly under any conditions.<br>
Currently, the basic structure and data-processing mode of short-message system determine that the short-message system has many limitations in resisting traffic shock and preventing faults of database server, and has only few means to solve the problems. The commonly employed method for resisting traffic shock in case of heavy traffic service is to refuse or postpone the sending of a large quantity of normal messages, which leads to a low transmitting rate and responding rate of the short-message system. When the messages postponed sending accumulate to a certain amount under a long time of heavy traffic shock, the messages will overflow and be lost, and eventually the whole system will collapse because of overloading.<br>
For instance, the Chinese patent application 02123903.7 with publication date<br><br>
January 14,2004, discloses a method for resisting heavy traffic shock in short-message system, in which, the strategic approach for the increasing traffic service is buffer-storage and delaying transmission, which, however, will cause a low responding rate of the system; and the method also modifies the temporary mistakes into eternal mistakes, thereby discarding the short-messages failed to be transmitted. However, the heavier the traffic service is, the more the failed transmission will be, if the failed messages are discarded directly without re-sending, the success rate of transmission of the system will be largely decreased.<br>
The database sever is an essential component of the short-message system, its default will bring about fatal impact on the short-message system, thus the security of database sever also needs to be improved. In the existing techniques, the technology of system redundancy and disaster recovery is normally employed to backup the whole system, thereby effectively decreasing the failure rate of the whole system, but its realization is complicated and also needs a high costs.<br>
Consequently, there is an urgent need for an intelligent data scheduling method with high-efficiency and easy-application for the current short-message system, in order to improve the robustness and security of the system, and also ensure a high responding rate and a high success rate of the message transmission.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is set forth to solve the above problems of the existing techniques. The present invention aims to provide an intelligent data scheduling method of short-message system, wherein, the short-message system is able to adopt corresponding operation mode according to the changes of the traffic amount so as to intelligently schedule the data, thereby improving the system capability of resisting traffic shock and ensuring a high transmitting rate and a high responding rate of the short-message system.<br><br>
The present invention provides an intelligent data scheduling method of short-message system, choosing the operating mode of the system according to the traffic load indication of the short-message system, and scheduling the short-message traffic data based on the selected operating mode.<br>
Preferably, the intelligent data scheduling method of short-message system of the present invention includes the following steps of:<br>
dividing the operation mode of short message system into a normal mode and a strategic mode in the case of heavy traffic service, configuring the switching manner and switching condition between the operation modes, and the data scheduling strategy corresponding to each mode, in the strategic mode, selectively discarding the data generating in processing short message traffic;<br>
detecting the traffic load indication of the short-message system;<br>
comparing the traffic load indication with the switching condition, when it satisfies the switching condition, carrying out the switching between the operation modes of the short message system according to the configured switching manner; and<br>
in the case of generating data in processing short message traffic, scheduling the data according to the data scheduling strategy corresponding to the current operation mode.<br>
Preferably, said intelligent data scheduling method of short-message system further includes the steps of: dividing the short-message service processing procedure into two individual processing procedures: a short message service message original (SMS MO) procedure of short-message and a short message service message terminal (SMS MT) procedure of short-message, and setting a traffic load threshold for stopping SMS MT temporarily; in which<br>
before the step of comparing the traffic load index with the switching condition, the following steps are further included: in the normal operation mode, if the traffic load index exceeds the traffic load threshold for stopping SMS MT temporarily, then stopping the SMS MT procedure of the short-message; if the traffic load index is lower than the<br><br>
traffic load threshold for stopping SMS MT temporarily, then proceeding with the SMS MT procedure.<br>
It can be concluded from the above that the present invention provides multiple operation modes of the short-message system, each mode corresponds to different data scheduling strategies and can be mutually switched freely, thus the short-message system can select corresponding operation mode according to the changes of the service traffic flow, consequently the system capability of resisting traffic shock is enhanced, and the robustness, stability and adaptability of the system are improved, and since the existing send-out strategy is not changed, the responding rate of the system is also guaranteed. On the other hand, the present invention divides the short-message service process into two independent procedures, i.e. the SMS MO procedure and the SMS MT procedure, and provides system de-load approaches for suspending SMS MT procedure, which can exploit the potentiality of the system and reduce the impact of wavelet traffic shock on the short-message system. Further, by taking precedence to saving the short message data which affect the transmission success rate of the system, the present invention preferentially guarantees the successful transmission of short message in the case of heavy traffic service. In addition, the present invention employs the disaster recovery mode so that the disastrous effects resulted from the failure of database server in the short-message system can be avoided, and the disaster recovery is realized easily which saves the system cost.<br>

Preferred Embodiments of the Invention<br>
The following detailed descriptions on the preferred embodiments of the present invention in combination with the appended drawings will be helpful for a clear understanding on the above as well as other purposes, features and merits of this invention.<br>
The basic spirit of this invention is: setting multiple operation modes for the short-message system, selecting the operation mode of the system based on the current traffic load index of the short-message system, and scheduling the short-message service data according to the operation mode selected.<br>
According to one embodiment of this invention, firstly, dividing the operation mode of the short-message system into a normal mode and a load-resisting mode, in which, the normal mode is the basic operation mode of the current technology, and the load-resisting mode is defined as an operation mode employed by the short-message system in the case of heavy traffic load; secondly, configuring the switching mode and switching conditions between the operation modes, and the data scheduling strategy corresponding to each operation mode, in which, when in the load-resisting mode, selectively discarding the data that generating in processing short message traffic; detecting the traffic load index of the short message system, and comparing the traffic load index with the switching<br><br>
condition; if the traffic load index satisfies the switching condition, carrying out the switching between the operation modes according to the configured switching manner; for the data generated in processing the short message traffic, scheduling the data according to the data scheduling strategy corresponding to the current operation mode of the short message system.<br>
Fig. 1 is the functional module diagram of the short-message system employing the intelligent data scheduling method of one embodiment of the present invention. The short-message system mainly includes a traffic processor 101, an operation-maintaining center 102 connecting with said traffic processor 101, and a chief database 103, in which, the traffic processor 101 is the key component for processing the short-message traffic, and all the operation modes are realized on the traffic processor 101; the operation-maintaining center 102 is the man-computer interface, being used for providing the man-computer interface for configuring the operation mode; the chief database 103 is the main data-storage equipment, being used for storing the major data of the short-message system, such as the subscriber information required by the traffic processing, and the short-message data generated during the traffic processing.<br>
Next, the operation modes of the short-message system will be explained. As mentioned above, all the operation modes are realized in the traffic processor 101.<br>
normal mode: the normal mode is an operation mode employed when the short-message system runs normally. Under this mode, the traffic processor 101 connects to the chief database 103, and the processing of the traffic and data follows the existing standard procedures; the system reads the subscriber information required by the traffic processing in the regular way, and saves the data generated during the traffic processing (such as short messages); in addition, the short-message system stores the data completely.<br>
load-resisting mode: the load-resisting mode is an operation mode employed in the case of heavy traffic load. Underthismode, the traffic processor 101 connects to the chief<br><br>
database 103, and selectively discards the data generated in processing short-message traffic; and the short-message system only partially stores the data or does not store any data at all. Preferably, in order to guarantee a high success rate of transmitting short-message, the data which has no effect on the success rate of transmitting short-message is discarded preferably when discarding the data.<br>
The configuration of the operation mode of the short-message system is accomplished mainly by the operation-maintaining center 102, the relevant configuration mainly includes:<br>
1) Configuration of the switching manner: the switching manner between the operation modes can be switched manually or self-adaptively or the combination of the two. If switching manually, it is operated according to the live environment index of the short-message system (including the real-time performance statistics, traffic flux, system alarm types and so on); if switching self-adaptively, it is operated by the traffic processor 101 automatically according to the system traffic load index (such as the traffic load and the availability of the database service) and the configured switching strategy, the switching of the operation modes goes into effect immediately, and the system do not need to be reset. Preferably, the traffic load index of the short-message system employs one or any combination of the CPU utilization ratio, the IO wait ratio and the buffer utilization ratio; the real-time acquisition of the system load index can employ the commonly used API functions which is used to detect the CPU utilization ratio and the IO wait ratio. For instance, when the self-adaptive switching manner is employed, if the short message system is in the normal mode, the traffic processor 101 detects the load index of the system, when detecting that the load index satisfies the switching condition, the traffic processor 101 switches the self-adaptive switching manner into the load-resisting mode automatically, and when the load index of the system satisfies the switching condition for switching the load-resisting mode to the normal mode, the traffic processor 101 switches the load-resisting mode to the normal mode.<br><br>
2) Configuration of the switching condition: take the self-adaptive switching mode for example, the configuration employs the switching of detecting time and detecting frequency etc. Preferably, the switching condition in the self-adaptive mode is: in the normal mode, if the traffic load index exceeds the load threshold of the load-resisting, and this status lasts for a set period of time, the system will be switched to the load-resisting mode automatically; in the load-resisting mode, if the traffic load index is less than the load threshold of the load-resisting, and this status lasts for a set period of time, the system will be switched to the normal mode automatically. For example, the short-message system is running in the normal mode, and the traffic load index of the traffic processor 101 exceeds the normal level lasting for 10 minutes due to the traffic storm etc., then the system switches from the normal mode to the load-resisting mode automatically; after the traffic storm gone, the short message system detects that the traffic load index returns back to the normal level and the status lasts for 10 minutes, then the system switches from the load-resisting mode to the normal mode.<br>
It can be concluded from the above descriptions that by employing the present invention, the short message system is able to select the appropriate operation mode and corresponding data scheduling strategy according to the indexes like the traffic pressure and the availability condition of the database server so as to process the data generated during processing the short message traffic, thereby improving the capability of the system in resisting the traffic shock.<br>
In order to make full use of the system hardware resources and improve the performance of the application program, in aspect of implementation of traffic processing, the short message traffic can be divided into two independent processing procedures: the SMS MO procedure and SMS MT procedure of the short message, in which, the SMS MO procedure refers to a procedure that the calling subscriber sends short messages to the short message system; the SMS MT procedure refers to a procedure that the short message system delivers the messages to the target subscriber. Fig. 2 shows the schematic<br><br>
diagram of the short message traffic processing procedure: after the SMS MO procedure (thread) 210 receives and handles the SMS MO request, on one hand, it stores the complete short message into the chief database 103, on the other hand, it inserts the brief information of the short message (including the short message ID, the phone-number of the target subscriber, etc.) into the short message buffer queue 220, then it sends a response for the successful SMS MO to the calling subscriber, after the above operation being finished, the SMS MO procedure 210 receives and handles the next SMS MO request, The SMS MO procedure 210 accepts and handles the SMS MO requests unconditionally under any circumstances. The SMS MT procedure (thread) 230 reads out brief information of the short message from the short message buffer queue 220 based on the first-in-and-first-out principle, upon which, it searches the corresponding short message in the chief database 103, and executes the SMS MT procedure on it, after finishing the SMS MT procedure, the modified message is saved again into the chief database 103. The next message SMS MT procedure will be followed after each SMS MT procedure is finished.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the short message system operation mode is divided into normal mode and load-resisting mode, and at the same time, the procedure of short message processing is divided into two independent procedures, i.e. the short message SMS MO procedure and the short message SMS MT procedure, and the traffic threshold of suspending SMS MT is also configured, thus, the SMS MT procedure thread 230 is able to determine whether to execute the SMS MT procedure according to the comparing result of the system load index detected real-time by the short message system with the configured load threshold of suspending SMS MT, thereby decreasing the load of the system. If the current system load index exceeds the load threshold of suspending SMS MT, then stop the SMS MT procedure temporarily; if the current system load index is lower than the load threshold of suspending SMS MT, then proceed with the SMS MT procedure. Surely, the SMS MT thread can also execute the<br><br>
SMS MT procedure unconditionally. After finishing the above operations, compare the system load index with the switching condition again, then carry out the consequent steps.<br>
In the above embodiment, the operation-maintaining centre 102 needs to configure the following items: if it is unconditional SMS MT procedure; the load threshold of suspending SMS MT when it is not the unconditional SMS MT procedure. Preferably, the load threshold of suspending SMS MT is lower than or same with the load threshold of the load-resisting mode.<br>
From the above description, it can be concluded that by employing this embodiment, the temporary overload of the system (i.e. the system index exceeds the normal level but has not satisfied the switching condition yet) can be reduced, thereby on the one hand, the potentiality of the system is explored and the attacking-influence of the traffic wave-strike is weakened; on the other hand, by combining with the load-resisting mode, the short message system is provided with different data scheduling strategies for different traffic load, and the system capability of processing traffic and resisting shock is improved substantially.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, the operation mode of the short message system further includes the disaster recovery mode in order to avoid disastrous affects on the short message system resulted from the failure of database. The disaster recovery mode is an operation mode employed in the case that the chief database of the short message system fails to provide services (such as in the condition of system interruption, software update and so on). The switching condition between the disaster recovery mode and the above two operation modes is: whether the chief database of the short message system runs out of order: if in the normal mode or the load-resisting mode, the chief database occurs failure, then switching to the disaster recovery mode; if in the disaster recovery mode, the chief database recoveries to normal, then switching to the operation mode of the short message system which is employed before the chief database occurs<br><br>
default. In the disaster recovery mode, the traffic processor of the short-message system connects to the spare database, and acquires the information needed for traffic processing from spare database. Jn Fig.l, the spare database 104 is the spare data storage equipment, and is the backup of the chief database. When in the disaster recovery mode, the service processor 10! connects to the spare database 104 for short-message service processing, when the chief database 103 comes back to the normal state, the service processor 101 disconnects the spare database 104, resumes the connection to the chief database 103, and switches the operation mode of the short-message system back to the operation mode which the chief database 103 employed before failure occurs.<br>
In this embodiment, the follow configurations need to be configured by the operation-maintaining center! 02: the spare database type and the node location etc. in the disaster recovery mode, as well as the data dispatching strategy in the disaster recovery mode. In this embodiment, the data dispatching strategy in the disaster recovery mode is only to save the short-message needing to be re-sent. But of course, the data dispatching strategy can be configured to not saving any short-message.<br>
Preferably, the spare database only saves the data required for service processing; for the data generated during the service processing, it only saves the short-message needing to be re-sent, or it doesn't save any short-message; the spare database synchronizes data with the key data of the chief database by the way of time-loading.<br>
To sum up, by this embodiment, the normal operation of the short-message system can be ensured even when the chief database breakdowns, the robust of system is enhanced, and the equipment cost of the spare database is greatly reduced.<br>
Fig.3 is a schematic view showing the relation between the operation modes of the short message system according to the intelligent data scheduling method of an embodiment of the present invention, in which, the switching between the normal mode, load-resisting mode and disaster recovery mode can use either manual switching manner or self-adaptive switching manner.<br><br>
Fig.4 is a flowchart of service processing in the load-resisting mode according to the intelligent data scheduling method of an embodiment of the present invention. When the short message system switches to the load-resisting mode, if the preceding mode of the system is the disaster recovery mode, then step 410 is performed, in which, the short message system disconnects the spare database and connects to the chief database. In step 420, the short message system performs the normal service processing. When the computer sent out data operation request during service processing, then step 430 is performed to judge the data operation mode. If it is data-reading request, then step 440 is performed to conduct the normal data-reading operation, then return to step 420 to proceed with the next service processing. If it is data-writing request, then step 450 is performed to save or discard the data according to the current selected data scheduling strategy, then return to step 420 to proceed with the next service processing.<br>
Next, how to choose the data scheduling strategy used in step 450 will be described. In the load-resisting mode, the load can be further divided into several levels, each level is configured with corresponding load index threshold and data scheduling strategy. When the short message system switches to load-resisting mode, the service processor needs to real-time monitor the status of CPU, I/O interface, buffer etc. of short-message system, thereby determining the load level of the traffic to the short-message system, then choosing corresponding data scheduling strategy according to the load level. Fig.5 shows a flowchart of choosing the data scheduling strategy in load-resisting mode according to the data intelligent scheduling method of an embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, supposing that there are three load levels in the load-resisting mode: less-high, high and super-high, with the threshold value of load indexes being: for the less-high level, the CPU use ratio =60%, ratio of IOwait=30%; for the high level, the CPU use ratio =70%. IOwait=40%; for the super-high level, the CPU use ratio =80%, 10wait=50%. In step 510, detecting the current load index of the short-message system, supposing the current load index detected is: the CPU use ratio =70%, IOwait=45%. In<br><br>
step 520, comparing the current load index detected with the load index threshold of each load level, then deciding the current load level of the short-message system. In this embodiment, the current load level can be determined to be high level through comparison. After the load level is determined, step 530 is performed to choose the data scheduling strategy corresponding to the load level, and the data scheduling strategies corresponding to each load level are: for the less high level, only discarding (i.e. not saving) the short-message sent successfully; for the high level, further discarding the outdated short-message, the permanent failed short-message (those failed for more than three times) and the return receipt of short-message; for the super high level, further discarding the short-message finished procession completely, such as the short-message waiting for re-sending. Therefore, in this embodiment, the data scheduling strategy should employ "discarding the short-message sent successfully, the outdated short-message, the permanent failed short-message and the return receipt of short-message."<br>
Of course, in the load-resisting mode, the number of the load levels and the corresponding data scheduling strategy can be set flexibly. It needs to be pointed out that, if the current load index of the short-message system is lower than the load index threshold of the less high level, and the short-message system is in the load-resisting mode, then the data scheduling strategy corresponding to the less high level is to be employed.<br>
The above load levels, the data scheduling strategies corresponding to each load level and the load index threshold of each load level in the load-resisting mode all have to be configured by the operation maintenance center 102 of the short-message system.<br>
Moreover, the load-resisting mode can be further divided into several sub modes according to different traffic pressures, and the switching condition and data scheduling strategy of these sub modes are to be configured.<br>
From the above, it can be concluded that in this embodiment, different load levels<br><br>
are farther divided in load-resisting mode, and different data scheduling strategies are applied corresponding to different load levels so as to relieve the pressure of the short-message system, the strategy is to discard the short message sent successful, the outdated short-message, the permanent failed short-message, the return receipt of short-message and until all the short-message finished procession successively with the increasing load levels of the system. This embodiment ensures a high responding ratio of message transmission by not temporary storing and buffer transmitting the short-message, and when choosing the data type to be discarded, the success ratio of message transmission are ensured preferentially at anytime.<br>
Fig.6 is a flowchart of service processing in disaster recovery mode according to the intelligent data scheduling method of an embodiment of the present invention. When the short message system switches to the disaster recovery mode, in step 610, the service processor disconnects the chief database and connects with the spare database. Then in step 620, the normal service processing is performed. In the service processing procedure, if the computer sent out data operation request, in step 630, determining the data operation mode, if it is data-reading request (such as reading subscriber information for authentication), then perform step 640, reading the information needed by service processing from the spare database, then returning to step 620, and proceeding with the next service processing; if it is data-writing request (such as saving the processed message), then in step 650, saving or discarding the data according to the data scheduling strategy of disaster recovery mode, in this embodiment, only saving the message waiting to be re-sent, then returning to step 620, and proceeding with the next service processing.<br>
From the above, it can be concluded that by employing the disaster recovery mode, this embodiment is able to prevent the disastrous affect resulted from the database service failure of short-message system, enhances the robust, stability and flexibility of the system, and the method for realizing disaster recovery is simple and cost saving.<br>
It should be understood that, all the operation modes in the embodiments of the<br><br>
present invention can be combined and changed freely as application required, for example, the combination ofthe normal mode and the load-resisting mode can be employed only; or the load-resisting mode can be further divided into normal traffic pressure mode and high danger traffic pressure mode, for which switching condition and data dispatching strategy are also to be configured; moreover, the load index of short-message system can also use other indexes, such as the buffer use ratio, the weighted arithmetic etc. can be used for multiple indexes; in aspect of data scheduling strategy, if the load increases continuously, all the unnecessary short-message can be further discard, such as the timing short-message.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

of short message system in a telecommunication network, wherein said intelligent data scheduling system coordinates with the traffic processor (101), the operation-maintaining center (102), chief database (103) and a spare database (104);<br>
and wherein the said intelligent data scheduling method is characterized by selecting operation mode of the system according to current load index of the short-message system, and scheduling short message traffic data according to the selected operation mode, wherein, the operation mode is configured by an operation-maintaining center (102) of the short message system and is realized on a traffic processor (101) of the short message system; and wherein the said intelligent data scheduling method of short message system is further characterized by following steps:<br>
(i) dividing the operation mode of the short message system into a normal mode and a strategic load-resisting mode in the case of heavy traffic load, configuring switching manner and switching condition between the modes and data scheduling strategy corresponding to each mode, selectively discarding the data generated by the short message service processing in the load-resisting mode; (ii) detecting the load index of the short message system; and (iii) comparing the load index with the switching condition, when satisfying the switching condition, completing the switch between the operation modes of the short message system according to the configured switching modes; and when data is generated during the<br><br>
short message service processing, scheduling the data according to the data scheduling strategy corresponding to the current operation mode.<br>
2.	An intelligent data scheduling system and the method thereof, as claimed in claim 1 wherein said intelligent data scheduling method involves the step of dividing the short message service processing procedure into two independent procedures: a short messages service message original (SMS MO) procedure and a short messages service message terminal (SMS MT) procedure, and setting a SMS MT load threshold in which, before the step of comparing the load index with the switching condition, the method further includes the step of: in the normal mode, if the load index exceeds the SMS MT load threshold, then suspending the short message SMS MT procedure; if the load index is lower than the SMS MT load threshold, then performing the SMS MT procedure.<br>
3.	An intelligent data scheduling system and the method thereof, as claimed in claims 1, wherein switching manner and switching condition is configured to be either manual switching or self-adaptive switching or the combination of the two.<br>
4.	An intelligent data scheduling system and the method thereof, as claimed in claim 1 or 3, wherein, the switching condition in the self-adaptive switching mode is characterized as:<br>
(i) in the normal mode, if the load index exceeds the load threshold of load-resisting mode and this state lasts for a predetermined period of time, then switching to the load-resisting mode automatically;<br><br>
(ii) in the load-resisting mode, if the load index is lower than the load threshold of load-resisting mode and this state lasts for a predetermined period of time, then switching to the normal mode automatically.<br>
5.	An intelligent data scheduling system and the method thereof, as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein in the load-resisting mode, the data having no influence on the success ratio of sending short message is selectively discarded preferentially.<br>
6.	An intelligent data scheduling system and the method thereof, as claimed in claims 1, 4 or 5, wherein, said load-resisting mode in the telecommunication network is further characterized by dividing it into several load levels, each load level is configured with corresponding load index threshold value and corresponding data scheduling strategy; wherein said method further includes the steps of (i) comparing the current load index detected with the load index threshold value of each load level, (ii) determining the current load level of the short-message system therein, and (iii) then choosing the corresponding data scheduling strategy therein.<br>
7.	An intelligent data scheduling system and the method thereof, as claimed in claim 1, wherein, the data scheduling strategy corresponding to each load level in the telecommunication network should satisfy with the increase of the load level and scheduling the data with the following sequence: discarding the short message transmitted successfully; discarding the outdated short-message; discarding the permanent failed short-message; discarding the return receipt of short-message; and discarding all the short message finished procession.<br><br>
8.	An intelligent data scheduling system and the method thereof, as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein, said load index uses any of CPU use ratio, IO wait ratio, and buffer use ratio, or random combination of them.<br>
9.	An intelligent data scheduling system and the method thereof, as claimed in claims 1, 3 or 4, wherein, said operation mode of the system includes disaster recovery mode in the telecommunication network, which is characterized by connecting to a spare database (104) for service processing in the condition of breakdown of the chief database (103), and after the recovery of the chief database to normal, the operation mode switches back to the operation mode, the short message system gets re-connected to the chief database, disconnecting the spare database.<br>
10.	An intelligent data scheduling system and the method thereof, as claimed in claims 1 and 9, wherein, said spare database only saves the data needed for service processing; for the data generated in service processing, said spare database only saves the short message waiting for re-sending, or saves nothing; said spare database synchronizes data with the key data of the chief database by the way of time-loading.<br>
11.	An intelligent data scheduling system and the method thereof, as substantially herein described and illustrated in the figures of the accompanying drawings.<br></td>
