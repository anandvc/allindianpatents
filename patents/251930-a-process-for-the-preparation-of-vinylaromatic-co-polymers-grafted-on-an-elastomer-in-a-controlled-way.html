 A  PROCESS   FOR  THE  PREPARATION  OF  VINYL AROMATIC (CO) POLYMERS GRAFTED ON AN ELASTOMER IN A CONTROLLED WAY<br>
The present invention refers to a process for the preparation of vinyl aromatic (co)polymers grafted on an elastomer in a controlled way.<br>
In detail, the present invention refers to a process for the preparation of (co)polymers of styrene grafted on an elastomer in presence of a living radi-calic polymerization system.<br>
The term "living radicalic polymerization", as used in the present description and in the claims, means a conventional radicalic polymerization carried in also in the presence of a chemical substance capable to react in a reversible way with the radical of the growing polymer chain. Such substance consists, for instance, of stable nitroxides or alkoxy-amines. More details on the radicalic polymerization can be found in the U.S.  patent  4,581,429,  in  the European  Patent<br><br>
869,137 or in "Living Free Radical Polymerization",<br>
TPoint 2-2002, Notiziario di EniTecnologie (San Donato<br>
Milanese), available on the web at:<br>
www, enitecnologie. it/tpoint/articoli/FT_petrolchimica/L<br>
ivingFree2_2002.pdf.<br>
Various processes for the preparation of vinylaro-matic (co)polymers grafted on elastomer in a controlled way are known in literature. For instance, in US Patent 6,262,179 a process to prepare a rubber reinforced vi-nylaronvatic polymer is described, characterized by a mono- or bimodal morphology that comprises the polymerization of a vinyl aromatic monomer solution containing rubber, by means of an initiator system that comprises a stable generator of radicals. At the end of the polymerization a product is obtained, consisting of a rigid polymer matrix, in which the rubber particles are dispersed, whose morphology, however, is still linked to the type of - rubber used as in the traditional processes that use the non stable polymerization initiators .<br>
US Patent 6,255,402 describes a process for the preparation of a composition consisting of a vinylaro-matic matrix polymer, in which particles of rubber are dispersed with morphology different from the one known as "salami", but instead being of the "labyrinth", "on-<br><br>
ion" or, better, " capsule" type, so as to supply a crash resistant end product with improved gloss. The same US patent gives indications about meaning of the terms identifying the above cited morphologic forms.<br>
The present process is characterized in that of being successful in obtaining the morphologic diversity using the homopolymer of the butadiene as rubber which, traditionally, substantially gives the morphology to salami .<br>
According to said US patent the polybutadienic rubber is dissolved in a solvent in absolute absence of monomer and functionalized with an initiator system consisting of a traditional radical initiator; for instance a peroxide, and a stable radical initiator, for instance 2,2,6, 6-tetramethyl-l-pyperidinyloxyl (commonly known as TEMPO) operating at a temperature comprised between 50 and 150°C, which was stirred for some hours. Finally, the vinylaromatic monomer is added and then its polymerization is started until the desired conversion is obtained.<br>
The polymerization system of US Patent 6,255,402 permits on one hand to obtain an end product of variable morphology with a low cost rubber and on the other hand introduces a second disadvantage which reduces, or even runs the risk of canceling, the associate economic ad-<br><br>
vantage of using the polybutadienic rubber. Indeed, in the solution processes, there is the provision for a stage of devolatilization under vacuum to retrieve at the end of the polymerization the solvent and the non reacted monomer which, for economic reasons, must be recycled. The above implies, for the processes of the current art, one' stage to separate the solvent, recycled at the rubber functionalization, from the monomer recycled at the polymerization reactor, with an increase of the production costs.<br>
The Applicant has now found a process for the preparation of vinylaromatic (co)polymers grafted on an elastomer in a controlled way, by means of a catalytic system comprising a stable initiator of radicals, which permits to obtain an end product in which the morphology of the dispersed elastomeric phase does not necessarily depend on the type of the used elastomer, as the latter could even consist of simple polybutadiene, and in which the not reacted end product, recovered after devolatilization, does not have to be separated in its single constituents (solvent and monomer) but can be used and recycled as such.<br>
Therefore, the scope of the present invention is a<br>
process   for   the   preparation   of   vinylaromatic<br>
(co)polymers grafted on elastomer in a controlled way<br><br>
which comprises:<br>
a) dissolving an elastomer in a liquid phase consisting of a vinyl aromatic monomer/polymerization solvent mixture with a weight ratio comprised between 60/4 0 and 100/0, preferably between 60/40 and 90/10;<br>
b) adding to the•solution a catalytic system of polymerization consisting of a free radical initiator (G) , having F functionality, capable of withdrawing a proton from the polymeric chain of the elastomer and a stable initiator of free radicals comprising the group<br>
= N-0'  (I),  with molar ratios  I/G'F  lower  than 4, preferably between 1 and 2, being F equal to the number<br>
of functional groups per molecule of the initiator which, by decomposition, produces two free radicals ;<br>
c)	heating, while stirring, the mixture obtained in<br>
stage (b) at a temperature comprised between 80 and<br>
110°C, for a time sufficient to obtain the complete<br>
functionalization of the elastomer;<br>
d)	feeding the vinylaromatic monomer to the mixture,<br>
containing in solution the functionalized elastomer,<br>
polymerizing the thus obtained mixture at a tempera<br>
ture greater than or equal to 120°C/ preferably between<br>
120 and 200°C;<br>
e)	recovering the obtained vinylaromatic polymer ob<br>
tained at the end of the polymerization, submitting it<br><br>
also to devolatilization under vacuum, to recover the solvent and the unreacted monomer; and f) recycling the solvent/monomer mixture to stage (a) .<br>
According to the present invention, the process of preparation of the vinylaromatic polymer can be realized via batch processing or via continuous processing. In the first case, the functionalization of the elastomer and the polymerization of the monomer occur in a single container, for instance in an 'agitated mixer equipped with heating systems from which the polymerization mixture is collected to recover the final polymer to be submitted to the phase of devolatilization when the solid content has reached a level comprised between 60 and 80% in weight. In the second case, instead, the functionalization of the elastomer takes place in the stirred mixer, continuously feeding products and additives, while the polymerization takes place in one or more stirred reactors, chosen among the stirred containers, such as the CSTR (Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor) , and/or the tubular reactors (Plug Flow) , continuously fed with the functionalized solution. Also, in this second case, the recovery of the final polymer takes place through the phase of devolatilization after the solid content reaches the above mentioned levels. The preferred process accord-<br><br>
ing to the present invention is the continuous process described, for instance, in the European Patent EP 400.479.<br>
The term "vinylaromatic (co)polymer" , as used in the present description and in the claims, means essentially a (co) polymer obtained from the (co)polymerization of at least one monomer that corresponds to following general formula (II):<br><br>
in which R is a hydrogen or a methyl group, n is zero or an integer comprised between 1 and 5 and Y is a halogen, like chlorine or bromine, or an alkylic or alkoxy radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
Examples of vinylaromatic monomers having the above identified general formula are: styrene, a-methylstyrene, methyl styrene, ethyl styrene, butyl styrene, dimethyl styrene, mono -, di -, tri -, tetra- and penta-clorostyrene, bromo-styrene, metoxystyrene, ace-toxystyrene, etc. The preferred vinylaromatic monomers are styrene and/or a-methylstyrene.<br>
The vinylaromatic monomers of general formula (I) can be used alone or in a mixture up to 50% in weight with other monomers that can be copolymerizable. Exam-<br><br>
pies of such monomers are the (meth) acrylic acid, the alkyl esters C3.-C4 of {me th) acrylic acid like methyl acrylate, methylmethacrylate, ethyl acrylate, ethyl-methacrylate, isopropyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, the amides and the nitriles of the (meth) acrylic acid like acrylamide, me thacryl amide, acrylonitrile, methacry-lonitrile, butadiene, ethylene, divinylbenzene, maleic anhydride, etc. The preferred copolymerizable monomers are acrylonitrile and methylmethacrylate.<br>
Any elastomer that can be used as a reinforcing product in a vinylaromatic (co)polyiner can be used in the process object of the present invention. However, the preferred product, for its economic convenience, is the hornopolymer polybutadiene with a numerical medium molecular weight  (Mn)  comprised between  50'000  and 350'000 and a medium ponderal molecular weight  (Mw) comprised between 100'000 and 500'000.<br>
Other elastomers that can be used in place of polybutadiene or in a mixture with it can be chosen among the homopolymers and the copolymers of 1,3-alkadienes containing 40-100% in weight of the 1,3-alkadiene monomer, for instance butadiene, isoprene or pentadiene, and 0-60% in weight of one or more mono-ethylenically unsaturated monomers chosen among sty-rene, acrylonitrile, a-methylstyrene, methylmetacrylate<br><br>
and ethylacrylate.<br>
Co-polymer examples of 1,3-alkadienes are the block co-polymers styrene-butadiene like the bi-block linear elastomers of the S-B type where S represents a poly-styrenic block of medium molecular weight Mw comprised between 5'000 and 80'000 while B represents a polybu-tadienic block of medium molecular weight Mw comprised between 2'000 and 250'000. In these elastomers the amount of block S is comprised between 10 and 50% in weight with respect to the total of' the rubber S-B. The preferred product is the styrene-butadiene copoly-mer block having a styrene content equal to 40% in weight and a viscosity in solution, measured at 23 °C in a 5% solution in weight of styrene, comprised between 35 and 5 0 CPS.<br>
Other elastomer examples that can be used in the process object of the present invention are those described in the European Patent 606.931.<br>
The previously described elastomers are dissolved in the liquid phase containing the monomer and a polymerization solvent. The preferred solvent, according to the present invention, is ethyl benzene, but other aromatic solvents can be used, like toluene or xylenes, or the aliphatic solvents, such as hexan or cyclohexan.<br>
The catalytic system of polymerization is added to<br><br>
the solution prepared in said manner, in an amount comprised between 0.02 and 0.5% in weight with respect to the total. This system consists of a free radical initiator and of a stable initiator of free radicals with the previously indicated ratios. Surprisingly, there is not a substantial formation of polymer which, if formed, does not exceed 2% in weight, and no reticulation of the elastomer is observed during the functionalization phas e.<br>
The free radical initiators capable of withdrawing one proton from the polymer chain of the elastomer are chosen among the azo-derivates, such as the 4,4' -bis-(diisobutirronitryle) , 4,4■-bis(4-cianopentanoic acid), 2 , 2'-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride , etc, or among the peroxides, the hydroperoxides, the percarbon-ates, the peresters and the persalts, for instance the persulphates such as the potassium persulphate or the ammonium persulphate. In general, the preferred free radicals initiators are the peroxides chosen among t-butil isopropyl monoperoxycarbonate, t-butil 2-ethylesil monoperoxycarbonate, dicumil peroxide, of-t-butil peroxide, 1,1-di(t-butilperoxy) cyclohexan, 1,1-di (tbutilperoxy) -3,3, 5-trimethylcyclohexan, t-butilperoxyacetate, cumil t-butil peroxide, t-butil per-oxybenzoate and t-butil peroxy-2-ethylhexanate.<br><br>
The stable initiator of free radicals characterized by the group =N-0 is chosen among those of general formula (III) :<br><br>
where the groups Ri, R2, R5 and Re, equal or different from each other, are straight or branched alkyl radicals, substituted or unsubstituted, containing from 1 to 20 atoms of carbon or alkylaromatic radicals, in which the alkyl group contains from 1 to 4 carbon atoms while the R3 and R4 groups, equal or different from each other, are equal to Rl, R2, R5 and R6, or R3-CNC-R4 is part of a cyclic structure, for instance with 4 or 5 carbon atoms, possibly fused with an aromatic ring or with a saturated ring containing from 3 to 2 0 carbon atoms in which at least a hydrogen atom of the cyclic structure can be replaced by a hydroxyl group.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the present invention, the t group =N-O* is replaced by the group group =N-O-R' wherein R' is a Ci-C8 alkyl or C7-Ca2 arylalkyl radical, possibly containing at least one<br><br>
heteroatom. Examples of radical R' are 2-phenylethyl or 2-methyl-2-cyanopropyl radical.<br>
Initiators of general formula (III) and their preparation are described in US Patent 4,581,429. Examples of particularly preferred initiators of general formula (III) that can be used in the process object of the present invention are the 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-l-pyrrolidinyloxyl, known with the trade name  PROXYL, the 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-l-pyperinedinyloxyl, known with the trade name TEMPO, and the 4-hydroxy- 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-pyperinediniloxyl, known with the trade name 40H-TEMPO. Other examples of stable initiators that can be used in the process object of the present invention and that are comprised in the general formula (III) are described in the above mentioned US Patent 4.581.429.<br>
At the end of the functionalization of the elastomer, the process of polymerization of vinylaromatic (co)polymers grafted on elastomer proceeds like the traditional process of the known technique, by feeding the monomer and starting the polymerization reaction by increasing the temperature in one or more stages. At the end of the polymerization, the polymer is submitted to a devolatilization process to recover the not reacted monomer and the solvent, which are found to be in<br><br>
such a ratio as to allow their recycling to the mixer without having to separate one from the other. If a co-monomer is present, it can be recovered, e.g. by distillation, before the recycling.<br>
To better understand the present invention and to put it in practical use some non limitative examples are illustrated below.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 (SALAMI)<br>
In a 1 liter flat bottom autoclave, complete with a temperature recorder and a stirring system consisting of an anchor and of a turbine with six slanted blades (the distance between the walls of the autoclaves and the anchor being 5.5 millimeters), at ambient temperature, 60 g of ethylbenzene (ET) , 160 g of styrene monomer (S) (ratio S/ET = 73/27) and 50 g of polybutadiene INTENE 60 (Mw = 308'600, polydispersivity 2.13) are introduced. The stirring speed is set at 100 rpm. The temperature of the system is raised to 9 0°C in an hour and maintained constant for another hour. After that, 0.4840 g of benzoil peroxide (BPO) and 0-5160 g of 4-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-l-pyperidinyloxyl (40H-TEMPO) are added. The temperature is raised to 105°C in three hours and maintained constant for another two hours.<br>
550 g of styrene monomer are added to the reaction mixture and the mixture is then heated to 12 5°C in 45<br><br>
minutes. The temperature is maintained at this value for six hours. After that, the reaction mixture is transferred into an appropriate container and the polymerization is completed by heating the mixture to 150°C for four hours. Finally, the obtained polymer is devola-tilized at 230°C under vacuum to eliminate the ethylben-zene and the not reacted styrene. The ethylbenzene and the styrene in an S/ET weight ratio equal to 73/27 are recycled to the 1 liter autoclave without having to be separated.<br>
The properties of the obtained polymer are indicated in Table 1. EXAMPLE 2 (LABYRINTH)<br>
