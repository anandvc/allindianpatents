				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a table top wet grinder.<br>
Indian cooking demands wet grinding of cereals, pulses, masalas of different kinds and coconut. Labour and time saving devices replaced manual grinding methods. Mixies and liquidizers are not found satisfactory for Indian cooking as the high speed of the rotating blades generates^ Considerable heat thereby partially cooking the ground mass. Food cooked using such semi cooked batter or dough is found to be inferior in taste, tinctures and flavour.<br>
Electrically operated stone wet grinders avoid certain draw backs of Mixies grinding. Excessive heating of dough is avoided due to the low speed of rotation of the stone grinding surfaces. However, grinders of this type are deficit to handle, clean and they occupy large floor space. Tilting wet grinders pioneered by the applicants" company avoided handling problems to a great extend.<br>
Table top wet grinders were then developed to meet consumer"s demand for compact and easily detachable models. Table top wet grinders commercially available now consists of a rotatable drum or container mounted on a base frame. The base of the container is made of stone and has a centrally located shaft for transmission of a rotary motion from a drive means. The shaft is provided with a roller assembly held in position from an arm located on the mouth of the drum. The roller assembly has two rollers made of stone which are held in close contact with<br><br>
the base of the drum.   The roller assembly is detachably mounted on tiie arm.<br>
The lid of the existing table top grinder has two parts, one on either side of the centrally located arm which holds the roller assembly. Assembling, the existing table top wet grinder for grinding and detaching tiie parts thereafter are cumbersome operations involving removing the two parts lid, detaching the arm from its pressed position and thereafter removing the roller assembly from the drum or cylinder.<br>
The table top wet grinder developed by us has a simple construction and is easy to operate. The detachable arm assembly holding the rolling stone and the two piece lid assembly are replaced with a simple easily detachable lid. It consists of a drive pully and a base plate drivably and detachably connected thereto. The base plate is provided with downwardly projecting lugs which align with corresponding slots provided on the base plate. A cylindrical drum or container with a stone base is located on the base plate and is capable of being driven by the drive pully and the base plate assembly. A centrally located shaft extends from the base of the drive pulley through the drum. A roller assembly consisting of at least two stone rollers is positioned horizontal to the stone base of the container. The roller assembly is detachably mounted on the central shaft and is held in position by means of holding means. The container is provided with a lid which has an outwardly projecting knob on its exterior and a downwardly projecting adaptor which sits on the holding means that houses the central shaft.<br><br>
The cylinder is rotatable by the drive pulley while the rollers of the roller assembly rotate due to friction developed thereby. The adaptor and the holding means tor housing the shaft and the roller assembly simplifies the operation of this table top wet grinder.<br>
This invention relates to a table top wet grinder which comprises a container with a stone base mounted on a base plate detachably and drivably disposed on a drive pulley, said base plate having downwardly extending lugs that align with the corresponding slots on said drive pulley, a centrally located shaft extending from said drive pulley through said container, a roller assembly consisting of at least two rollers horizontally disposed to said stone base being detachably mounted on said central shaft, holding means for holding said central shaft and said roller assembly in position, lid means for said container having a centrally located adaptor means downwardly extending therefrom to align with said holder means of said shaft and roller assembly.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the two figures in the accompanying drawings:<br>
Fig. I is a sectional view of the assembled table top grinder.<br>
Fig. II is an exploded view of the components of the table top grinder.<br><br>
The table top wet grinder may be mounted on a pedestal (19). The drive pulley is indicated by reference numeral 17 and the base plate is shown by reference numeral 13. Reference numerals 14 and 15 indicate ball bearing and locking bush assembly which aligns the base plate. Reference numeral 12 shows the container with a stone base while numerals 09, 09, 10 and 11 represent washer, sealing member, bush means and O ring which hold in shaft 07 in position. Shaft 07 is centally disposed on the drive pulley and extends through the base plate (13) and the container (12). The base plate has an upward projection through which the central shaft passes. The roller assembly is represented by numeral 06 and extends to a holder means 04 which is detachable. This is held in position by means of a spring 05 provided inside the holder means 04. The lid is indicated by numeral 02. It has an adaptor 03 extending downwardly and aligning with the holder means. The lid also has a knob 01 mounted externally for easy removal thereof The base plate has an upward tapered projection which houses the central shaft.<br>
The roller assembly and the shaft can be dismantled by removing the lid and detaching the holder means. The container may be lifted along with the base plate for cleaning and storage. The lugs may function as a stand for placing the container on any surface. The central shaft rests on a bearing sleeve provided on the drive pulley and may be detached therefrom.<br>
Obvious modifications and alterations known to persons skilled in the art are within the scope of this invention and appended claims.<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A table top wet grinder comprising a container with a stone base mounted on a base plate detachably and drivably disposed on a drive pulley, said base plate having downwardly extending lugs that align with corresponding slots on said drive pulley, a centrally located shaft extending from said drive pulley through said container, a roller assembly consisting of at least two rollers horizontally disposed to   said stone base being detachably mounted on said central shaft, holding means for holding said central shaft and said roller assembly in position, lid means for said container having a centrally located adaptor means downwardly extending therefrom to align with said holder means of said shaft and roller assembly.<br>
2.	The table top wet grinder as claimed in claim 1, wherein said roller assembly is spring loaded and housed within said holder means.<br>
3.	The table top wet grinder as claimed in claims I and 2 wherein said central shaft terminates within a bearing sleeve provided on said drive pulley.<br>
4.	The table top wet grinder as claimed in claims 1-3 wherein said base plate has an upward projection through which the central shaft passes.<br><br>
5.	The table top wet grinder as claimed in claims 1-4 wherein said holder means is detachable to enable dismantling of said roller assembly and said central shaft.<br>
6.	The table top wet grinder as claimed in claims 1 to 5  wherein said lid is provided with an external knob.<br>
7.	A table top wet grinder substantially as herein described particularly with reference to the accompanying drawings.</td>
