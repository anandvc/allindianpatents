STORAGE STABLE AQUEOUS ORGANIC PEROXIDE EMULSIONS<br>
The present invention relates to an aqueous organic peroxide emulsion comprising an anti-freeze agent, a protective colloid, and a plasticizer.<br>
As is well known, organic peroxides are thermally labile compounds. Because the decomposition of these peroxides is exothermic, it is hazardous when the heat of decomposition cannot be dissipated, e.g.. by heat loss to the surrounding area. When heat accumulates, the decomposition reaction may run out of control. To avoid such undesired situation, the peroxide typically is formulated with one or more phlegmatising agents including water.<br>
Aqueous organic peroxide emulsions are generally considered safe products because the peroxide is dispersed - fining small droplets - In the water phase, which water phase is well-suited for the removal of the heat of decomposition of peroxide molecules, e.g., by convection and/or evaporation.<br>
However, it was observed that many aqueous organic peroxide emulsions are not sufficiently stable upon storage. Most aqueous organic peroxide emulsions used commercially are stored at low temperatures, typically -25Â°C to 0 . Although emulsion fondle ones are well optimised with   viscosity and droplet size, droplet growth remains a problem, resulting in a short emulsion shelf life time. The growth of droplets may (eventually) result in layer separation of the emulsion, causing a formulation which was thought to be safe to become unsafe. Moreover, in a number of applications, for instance In the manufacture of PVC, the number offish eyes increases with emulsion age.<br>
JP-A-62086005 relates to an aqueous organic peroxide emulsion comprising a partially specified polyvinyl acetate with a saponification degree of 5 to 70 mole% as an emulsification stabiliser. By using the partially specified polyvinyl acetate, layer separation of the emulsion - which is the worst fume of emulsion instability - could be prevented. It is described that the stability of the emulsion<br><br>
could be improved further by adding a hydrocarbon-based solvent such as n-hexane, toluene, xylene or IP (iso-paraffin) solvent, a plasticiser such as DBP (dibutyl phthalate). DOR (dioctyl phthalate), and DOA (dioctyl adipate). or a chlorine-based solvent such as methylene chloride, carbon tetrachloride, and tetrachloroethylene. Examples are given using DOR and carbon tetrachloride. A relatively large amount of DOR and cartoon tetrachloride (i.e. 10 wt%) appears to have been used in order to obtain the improved emulsion stability.<br>
We found, however, that aqueous organic peroxide emulsions comprising a plasticiser in accordance with the prior art, e.g. DOR, still suffer from instability, i.e. droplet growth upon storage. Accordingly, there is a need for more stable aqueous organic peroxide emulsions, i.e. emulsions which show a reduced droplet growth during storage as compared to those of the state of the art. Preferably, the emulsion stabilising agent should work when used in small amounts.<br>
Inddentally, Applicant's WO 99/31194 discloses aqueous organic peroxide emulsions comprising at least one organic peroxide, water, at least one antifreeze agent at least one chlorinated paraffin, optionally at least one non-ionic surface-active agent, and optionally one or more protective colloids. These emulsions have a low viscosity and excellent storage stability for long periods of time. It is mentioned that the organic peroxide may be diluted with a plasticiser such as toluene, aliphatic hydrocarbons or dioctyl phthalate. This document does not disclose or suggest the emulsion in accordance waft the present invention.<br>
We found that droplet growth in aqueous organic peroxide emulsions can be reduced by including a specific plasticiser.<br>
The invention is characterised in that tiie plasticiser is an ester having a ratio of the number of carbon atoms present in the plastids molecule (excluding<br><br>
aromatic carbon atoms) to the number of ester groups in the molecule of higher than 8.<br>
Aqueous organic peroxide emulsions comprising such plasticisers were found to be more stable upon storage than known emulsions. In addition, the plasticiser can be used in relatively small amounts.<br>
The present invention relates to aqueous organic peroxide emulsions comprising an organic peroxide which is a liquid at storage and handling temperatures. Hence, other types of organic peroxide dispersions such as suspensions are excluded from the claims of this patent application. Typically, the aqueous organic peroxide emulsions in accordance with the present invention are fluids. As the skilled man will know, emulsions are defined as a mixture of two or more immiscible liquids, one being present in the other in the form of droplets.<br>
The ratio of the number of carbon atoms present in the plasticiser molecule (excluding aromatic carbon atoms) to the number of ester groups in the molecule Is represented by Ap/Po. Preferably, the Ap/Po ratio is 9 to 40, more preferably, 9 to 30, even more preferably, 9 to 20, and most preferably, 10 to<br>
The Ap/Po ratio is a generally accepted expression to characterise ester plastidsers. See A.S, Wilson, Plasticisers: Principles and Practice, The Institute of Materials, Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 12.<br>
The plasticisers to be used in the emulsions according to the present invention. I.e. esters having an Ap/Po ratio higher than 8 are known compounds. See A.S. Wilson, Plasticisers: Principles and Practice, The Institute of Materials. Cambridge University Press, 1996, pp. 145-179 (Chapter 5) and 279-280 (Appendix 1). A person of ordinary skill in the art of application of the emulsions in accordance with the present invention,  in  particular their use  in the<br><br>
manufacture of PVC, will have no difficulty in selecting a suitable plasticiser for use in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Suitable ester plasticisers include phthalates, terephthalates, benzoates. ad pÃ¢tÃ©s, citrates, sebacates, trimellitates, sulphonates. phosphates, fatty aced esters, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the ester plasticiser is selected from the group consisting of phthaiates and adipates and mixtures thereof-More specific examples of ester plasticisers useful in the emulsions of the present invention are dinonyl phthalate, disannul phthalate, didecyl phthalate, diisodecyl phthalate, diundecyl phthalate, diisoundecyl phthalate, didodecyl phthalate, ditridecyl phthalate, diisotridecyl phthalate, ditetradecyl phthalate, dipentadecyl phthalate, dihexadecyl phthalate, dioctadecyl phthalate, dinonyl adipate, didecyl adipate, diisodecyl adipate, didodecyl adipate, ditetradecyl adipate, dipentadecyl adipate, dihexadecyl adipate, dioctadecyl adipate, propyl decanoate, propyl laurate, isopropyl laurate. propyl myristate, propyl pegmatite, propyl stearate, butyl decanoate, butyl laurate, butyl myristate, butyl paimrtate, faulty stearate, and mixtures thereof.<br>

In the context of the present invention, when we speak of emulsions which are stabilised against droplet growth, what is meant is that 99 percentile of the droplet volume distribution (d99) of the organic peroxide In the emulsion does not exceed 15, preferably 10, more preferably 8, most preferably 6 \im during 12 weeks of storage at -20**C. Changes in droplet volume distribution influence tiie viscosity and storage stability of the emulsion, while also the polymerisation process can be adversely influenced when an emulsion with larger organic<br><br>
peroxide droplets is used, e.g., by having an increased number offish eyes in the case of the production of PVC. The droplet volume distribution is determined in a conventional way by means of a light scattering technique, measured, for example, by using a Malvern type 2600 apparatus.<br>
The amount of plasticiser required to optimize the storage stability of the aqueous organic peroxide emulsion according to this invention will depend on the type and amount of organic peroxide and the type of plasticiser used in the emulsion. Typically, an amount of 0.1 to 10, preferably 0.5 to 5, more preferably, 0.5 to 3. most preferably 0.5 to 2 wt%, based on the total weight of the emulsion, is used.<br>

Most preferably, the organic peroxide to be used in accordance with the present Invention is selected from the group consisting of cumuli peroxyneodecanoate, tert-butyl peroxyneodecanoate, tert-butyl peroxyneoheptanoate, and 1-(2-ethylhexyl-peroxy)-1,3-dimethylbutyl peroxypivalate.<br>
The aqueous organic peroxide emulsions in accordance with the present invention typically contain 30-70 wt% of organic peroxide, based on the total weight of the emulsion. Preferably, the amount of organic peroxide in the emulsion is 35-65, more preferably 40-60, most preferably 50-60 wt%.<br>

Preferably, use is made of methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, (ethylene) glycol, propanediols, glycerol, and mixtures thereof, more preferably, methanol, ethanol, and mixtures thereof. These agents are known to have hardly any effect on polymerisation processes, A skilled person will have no difficulties in balancing the ratio of water to antifreeze agent(s).

General procedures<br>
In the following Examples, the aqueous organic peroxide emulsions were made by the following general procedure: to a cooled vessel at -10Â°C were added in succession organic peroxide (final content Is 50 wt%, based on the total weight of tied emulsion), PVA (see Tables), plasticiser ester (see Tables), the remainder being a mixture of water/methanol in the ratio indicated in the Examples below. The organic peroxide was dispersed using an UttraTurrax type S25N-25GM (4 minutes/kg of emulsion) at full power, during which the temperature of the emulsion was kept below 15 *"C.<br>
The droplet volume distribution was determined by means of a light scattering<br>
technique, using a Malvern type 2600 apparatus. In the Tables, d99 (expressed<br>
in ^im) is 99 percentile of the droplet volume distribution of the organic peroxide in<br>
the emulsion (reproducibility approx. 0,5 )im). The emulsion samples were stored<br>
at -20"C and the data were collected at room temperature.<br>
All ottier numbers are expressed as wt%, based on the total weight of the<br>
emulsion.<br><br>
Example 1 and Comparative Examples A and B<br>
Organic peroxide: cumuli peroxyneodecanoate, 80%. Protective colloid: PVA, degree of hydrolysis 62.5-67.5% Water/methanol = 72/28<br><br>
These data show that DOR (Ap/Po=8) inhibits the   of droplets to some extent, but that DIDA (Ap/Po=12) is far superior to DOR.<br>
Examples 2 and 3 and Comparative Example C<br>
Organic peroxide: Cumyi peroxyneodecanoate, 77%. Protective colloid: PVA, degree of hydrolysis 62.5-67.5% Water/methanol=75/25<br><br><br>
These data illustrate that DIDP (Ap/Po=10) and DNP (Ap/Po=9) inhibit the growth of droplets in the emulsion more effectively than DOP.<br>
