Tectthical field<br>
The present invention relates to a safety cap system with an external locking cum unlocking<br>
means for an automotive cooling device, to prevent premature unlocking of the safety cap under abnormal pressure and temperature conditions. The present invention further relates to a safety cap system with a torque overriding means and a pressure and temperature controlled element to provide an external locking cum unlocking means for the safety cap and a method thereof<br>
Background and prior art<br>
With the advent of engines with increased horsepower, smaller radiators and higher<br>
thermostat opening temperatures; much more heat is accumulated in the engines of cars and other vehicles of today. These vehicles include trucks, LCVs, MCVs, vans, cars, snowmobiles, marine engines, ofF-road vehicles and sport utility vehicles. These vehicles have less engine surface to dissipate the heat into the atmosphere than older type of engines. To contain the excess heat build-up problem, the pressurized cooling system was developed. The radiator or any other safety-caps in these pressurized systems function to provide a safe opening so that liquid or any other suitable medium can be vented out and to maintain the desired system pressure.<br>
Pressurized vessels are often provided with a closure cap or a valve which, when removed, allows the tank to release pressure and be filled with refilling coolant. However, the premature removal of the closure cap subsequent to the pressurized vessel involves a sudden release of pressure when the cap is removed. This sudden release of pressure creates a dangerous situation resulting in expulsion of some liquid and steam from within the tank.<br>
During operation, when an engine becomes very hot, the engine cooling fluid can reach a temperature as high as 118 to 129 Â° C and pressure levels as high as 110-117 kPa. (USA-NHTSA- Federal Register Vol 66 No. 108 June 1, 2001/Proposed rules). Under such high temperature and pressure conditions, the sudden release of pressure upon removal of closure cap, subsequent to the pressurization of the reservoir is also dangerous to the effect that it may result in the cap of the cooling device getting blown off. In effect, the cap may become a dangerous projectile or a missile, thereby exposing the persons in the vicinity to the threat of serious bodily injuries, should the cap blow off the cooling device during<br><br>
unscrewing operation and also spraying the persons close to the cooling device with the hot fluid or steam that is ejected.<br>
Some of the conventional pressure cap units are so designed that once the pressure increases in the system it is capable of being removed when the cooling device is in hot condition. Under this condition the user is exposed to the risk of being injured by the highly pressurized cap and getting scalded from the steam jet that emerges out of the cooling device.<br>
There have been numerous instances where the high-pressure steam or hot liquid is ejected out from the engine cooling system during cap removal process, thereby causing serious bodily injuries.<br>
US 4927049 teaches an internal thermally locking radiator cap for fitting on the filler neck flange of an automotive radiator, which prevents the radiator cap from becoming detached from the filler neck flange when the radiator is hot. The cap uses a bi-metallic strip captured on the top surface of the radiator cap and having an end that goes through the opening of the radiator cap and engages the filler neck flange to lock the cap in place. US 5042677 discloses a radiator cap with a safety plate or wire made of memory alloy. The safety plate or wire bends downward under ambient temperature. High temperature water in the radiator causes the safety plate to extend out due to the memory characteristic of the alloy and the safety plate thus presses against the neck of the filling hole. One such provision to remove the excess pressure conditions before the cap is removed completely was disclosed in US Patent No 5603425, wherein a radiator cap with sealing members is disclosed. However, the product covered under the above said patent has the following limitation that a user of this cap, while closing the cap, does not seem to receive any feedback to indicate that the cap has reached its desired torque limit; as result the cap can be tightened below the desired limits resulting in high installation torque and high removal of torque further leading to inconvenience to the operator using the cap. The tightening of the cap may result in improper seating of the small o-ring, which further leads to ineffective sealing thereby leading to pressure and coolant loss.<br>
US 6378717 discloses a closure cap without a ratcheting with an internal locking means with a temperature controlled element to prevent unscrewing of the cap when the heat in the reservoir is in excess levels. Further, an exclusive and special reservoir is required for the closure cap of this design. In addition, the instant design may not be adaptable to radiator application because of lack of controlled vent path and also due to loss of coolant.<br><br>
In addition, closure caps of an engine cooling device, functioning on the basis of temperature sensing can fail to actuate the sensor if an end user tries to locally cool the cap by pouring cold water on the heated cap or the cap may fail to cooperate if a snow falls on the cap when the bonnet is kept opened for cooling.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
In order to overcome the above-mentioned hazards of an engine cooling system, the<br>
primary object of the present invention is to provide a system with a highly safe and<br>
pressure sensitive cap, which obviates the aforesaid drawbacks of the conventional ones.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a system, which is so designed that the<br>
safety-cap cannot be removed before the internal pressure of the associated cooling device<br>
has been completely released, whereby the danger of scald caused by a jet of steam or a<br>
bodily injury due to the ejection of safety cap is completely eliminated.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a means for relieving the pressure in<br>
the cooling device, in a systematic manner by locking the safety cap beyond a certain<br>
pressure and temperature levels.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a system for safety caps used in<br>
pressurized environments, more particularly to an improved safety cap on the cooling<br>
system of internal combustion engines.<br>
Further object of the invention is to provide a system that can cater to the needs of<br>
automatic lock and release mechanism of a safety cap of a cooling device, subject to<br>
pressure and temperature factors.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a safety cap with a torque<br>
overriding action to provide correct installation and removal torque.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a safety cap system with a pressure and temperature<br>
sensitive external locking cum unlocking means for an automotive cooling device, to prevent premature unlocking of the safety cap. The present invention further provides a pressure and temperature controlled means to provide an external locking cum unlocking means for the safety cap along with an overriding torque mechanism to provide and indicate exact installation and removal torque for the safety cap and a method thereof.

Referring initially to Figures 1 and 2, a removable safety cap (6) with a flange (3) is<br>
coupled with the neck (19) of the reservoir container (1), with a torque overriding means<br>
(13) for an effective installation and removal torque. An inlet (2) as a means to circulate the<br>
coolant into the reservoir container. A plunger device (4), as locking cum unlocking means<br>
for the safety cap is disposed and sealed to the reservoir wall (5) with one end projected<br>
towards the flange (3) of the safety cap (6) and other end extending into the reservoir<br>
container (1).  The plunger device (4) effects the locking cum unlocking of the safety cap<br>
under abnormal and normal conditions respectively. A vent path is provided between the<br>
neck (19) and the safety cap (6) for a steady release of residual levels of pressure and<br>
temperature during the removal of the safety cap.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, as represented by Figure 3 of<br>
the accompanied drawings, which is same as described in Figures 1 and 2, but differing in<br>
the area where a pair of plunger devices (4 and 4a) are disposed on either side of the safety<br>
cap (6) of the wall of the reservoir container for an effective locking cum unlocking of the<br>
safety cap.<br>
Now, referring to Figures 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 of Figure 4 of the accompanied drawings,<br>
wherein the working of the plunger device is depicted to clearly show the three stages viz.,<br>
normal, locking cum unlocking means of the safety cap of the plunger device. When the<br><br>
safety cap (6) with grooves (20) is coupled to the neck (19) of the reservoir container (1),<br>
the movable shaft (7) that is disposed in the outer sleeve (8) of the plunger device is rested<br>
below the flange (3) of the safety cap (6) under normal pressure and temperature<br>
conditions. However, in the event of an increase in pressure, say for instance pressure<br>
levels more than 2psi and/or temperature levels more than about 50Â° C in the reservoir<br>
container (1) during the running of a vehicle, the movable shaft (7) is projected towards the<br>
flange (3) and passes through the grooves (20) and locks the flange (3) of the safety cap (6)<br>
to effectively arrest the rotary motion of the safety cap (6), thereby preventing the user from<br>
opening the cap.  The movable shaft (7) will return to the normal position (Fig 4.1) when<br>
the pressure and temperature conditions of the reservoir container (1) return to normal state<br>
to enable the user to remove the cap.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment of the present invention as represented in Figures 4.5<br>
and 4.6, wherein the movable shaft (7) locks the flange (3) of the safety cap having blind<br>
cavities (21), whenever the pressure and temperature levels (as stated above) of the<br>
reservoir are above the normal. Further, the movable shaft returns to the normal state as<br>
shown in Figure 4.4 whenever the pressure and temperature conditions of the reservoir (1)<br>
return to normal state.<br>
In yet another exemplary embodiment of the present invention as represented in Figure 5, a<br>
removable metallic safety cap (6) with a flange (3) having grooves is mounted on the neck<br>
(19) of the reservoir (1) (in the instant case, the reservoir is a radiator), to control the<br>
installation and removal torque of the safety cap (6). A plunger device (4) is disposed and<br>
sealed to the reservoir wall (5) with one end projected towards the safety cap (6) and other<br>
end extending into the reservoir (1).<br>
Figure 5a provides an upper view of the metallic cap with plunger locking the cap.<br>
The working methodology of the metallic cap as shown in Figure 5 is same as that of the<br>
plastic cap.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, as represented by Figure 6 of<br>
the accompanied drawings, which is same as described in Figures 1 and 2, but differing in<br>
the area where a pair of plunger devices (4 and 4a) are disposed on either side of the safety<br>
cap (6) of the wall of the reservoir container (1) for an effective locking cum unlocking of<br>
the safety cap.<br>
Figure 6(a) of the accompanied diagram depicts an upper view of the metallic cap with a<br>
pair of plunger locking devices.<br><br>
In yet another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, as represented by Figure 7 the functional aspects the plunger device for a metallic cap is shown. The functional aspects of the plunger device for the metallic caps are similar to the description as provided under Figure 4.<br>
Now, referring to Figure 8, where a cross section of the plunger device is provided having a movable shaft (7) housed in the outer sleeve (8) of the plunger device that engages/disengages the flange (3) means (not represented in this Figure) of the safety cap at a predetermined pressure and temperature levels. Further, said outer sleeve (8) having threaded, push type or snap fit configuration, preferably a threaded, to firmly dispose the plunger device to the reservoir container. Movable shaft (7) that is housed in the outer sleeve (8) supported at the lower end by a bottom pin (9) to provide a dead end stop the shaft (7). A top sealing means (16 &amp; 17) are disposed to prevent leakage of cooling material through the plunger device. Another aspect of the sealing means (16 &amp; 17) is that it prevents the inlet of air during the cooling cycle of the reservoir container. A shaft neck seal (12) is disposed at the neck of the plunger unit to have an effective sealing between the neck and the plunger unit, both during installation and operation of the plunger device. Shaft cylinder seal (11) and shaft inner seal (15) are located on the shaft (7) near the metallic strip sensor (10) to provide effective sealing to avoid the loss of coolant and air during operating conditions. Yet another sleeve seal (18) is provided on the outer periphery of the plunger device (4) to act as a sealing means to avoid the coolant and air loss between the reservoir container and the plunger device.<br>
Now by referring to Figure 9, wherein the working of the plunger device is shown in various stages of operation, a pressure and temperature sensing means in the form of metallic strip sensor (10) is disposed in the free space between the bottom pin (9) and the shaft (7) to provide linear motion to the shaft during pre determined conditions of pressure and temperature levels of the reservoir container. The metallic strip sensor (10) can either be in conical or helical forms which are thermally and physically sensitive to react. When pressure and temperature conditions within the reservoir container are at certain predetermined levels due to the running of an engine, the resultant temperature/pressure is transmitted to the plunger unit, which is sensed by the metallic strip sensor (10), which expands and projects movable shaft (7) towards the flange (3) of the safety cap (not shown in this diagram) and locking the safety cap.   Once the temperature/pressure conditions<br><br>
return to less than the predetermined conditions the shaft (7) retracts as a result of retraction<br>
of the metallic strip sensor and releases the lock of the safety cap.<br>
The selected metallic sensor material of the present invention can sense pressure variations<br>
from about 2 psi and temperature variations from about SO^C.<br>
The safety cap system of the present invention can be adapted to safety caps selected from<br>
O ring caps, coolant caps, radiator caps and other conventional caps for coolant devices,<br>
both made of plastic and metal.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a safety cap system for engine cooling devices,<br>

16.	The method as claimed in claim 14, wherein the movable shaft is disposed to unlock the safety cap by retracting the shaft from the flange under normal pressure and temperature conditions, to facilitate the rotary movement of the safety cap.<br>
17.	The method as claimed in claim 14, wherein the plunger unit is disposed for activation when the pressure in the reservoir container exceeds a pressure level of above 2psi and thereby engaging the locking mechanism of the safety cap.<br>
18.	The method as claimed in claim 14, wherein the plunger unit disengages the locking mechanism of the safety cap when the pressure in the reservoir container is less than 2psi.<br>
19.	The method as claimed in claim 14, wherein the proper seating of the safety cap is due to torque overriding means of the safety cap, leads to an effective sealing of pressure and heat of the reservoir container.<br><br>
20.	The safety cap system for engine cooling devices substantially as here in described and<br>
illustrated with reference to accompanying drawings.<br>
21.	The method of providing fail-proof safety cap system for engine cooling devices<br>
substantially as here in described with reference to accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
