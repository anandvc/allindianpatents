Complete Specification:<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
CONFIDENTIAL<br><br>
PA/043/SPECIFICATION V-l<br><br>
I9.09.2007<br><br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
                            The present invention generally relates to the field of optical fiber<br>
preform manufacture. Particularly, the present invention relates to a method  for  manufacture  of  soot  porous  body  and  soot  porous   body  produced therefrom. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for  increasing the utilization of soot deposition machine, increasing soot  deposition rate and thereby increasing the production capacity of the soot  deposition machines for manufacturing the soot porous body without  modification of the existing machines. The present invention also relates to optical fiber preform and optical fiber prepared from the soot porous body.<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
	Optical fiber serves as the backbone of networks for audio, video &amp;<br>
data transmission, thus plays a significant role in the field of communications. The utilization of optical fiber has increased remarkably. Further, it is anticipated that the use of optical fibers in local loop telephone and cable TV service will increase in order to deliver greater amount of<br>
	information in the form of data, audio, and video signals.<br>
Optical fiber comprises a core and a cladding surrounding the core. The refractive index of the core is higher as compared with the refractive index of the cladding in order to achieve light transmission inside the optical<br>
	fiber, by the phenomena known as total internal reflection. Generally, either<br>
the refractive index of the core is substantially uniform across its diameter (also called step index optical fiber) or the refractive index of the core has a maximum at the center and decrease in parabolic fashion near the periphery (also called graded index optical fiber). Any other geometric shape and profile<br>
	of the refractive index of the core is possible catering to a particular need.<br>
In  the view of the  ever-increasing demand  of optical  fibers  it  is<br>
necessary to increase production of optical fiber but on other hand it is also<br>
essential to reduce the manufacturing cost, meaning thereby, it is necessary<br>
	to increase the efficiency of the manufacturing process. One way of achieving<br>
this is by reducing the manufacturing time at each step of the optical fiber<br><br>

manufacture without modification of existing machines or within the same infrastructure.<br>
Usually,     the    optical    fiber    is    manufactured     by    batch     type<br>
	manufacturing process, wherein the optical fiber is obtained by drawing an optical fiber preform. The optical fiber preform is a magnified image of optical fiber, which resembles the optical fiber and comprises a central core portion and an outer cladding but at least several hundred times magnified as compared to optical fiber dimensions. The core portion of the optical fiber preform can be prepared by any known conventional methods, for example  by Atmospheric Chemical Vapor Deposition (ACVD) method, while the cladding portion can be prepared by ACVD method or any other method like clad tube jacketing.<br>
	Figure   1   illustrates   an   ACVD   soot   deposition   machine   101   for<br>
deposition of soot, resulting in the formation of soot porous body. In accordance with the conventional ACVD method the soot 107 is deposited during the deposition process step on the cylindrical member 104 (also referred as target rod or mandrel) with a hollow glass handle 105 attached to one end of the cylindrical member 104, wherein the hollow glass handle 105 facilitates handling of the soot porous body 121. The opposite ends of the cylindrical member 104 are held by chucks 118, the chucks 118 being mounted on the stands 119. The chucks 118 are capable of rotation (electromechanical device is used to rotate the chucks 118 [not shown in the figure]),  wherein  the  cylindrical  member   104  is  rotated  (rotation  of the cylindrical member 104 and hence of the soot porous body 121 is indicated by the arrow 106) while the burners 108 traverses the cylindrical member 104 longitudinally (the longitudinal traverse direction of the burners 108 is shown by arrows  109) or vice-versa. The burners  108 are supplied with 	silicon  tetrachloride vapors   112   (or vapors  of any  other  silicon  contain material capable of forming silica), wherein silicon tetrachloride vapors 112 are obtained by vaporizing the liquid silicon tetrachloride 111 contained in a chamber 110. The temperature of the liquid silicon tetrachloride 111 is increased  above  its boiling point by means of heater  117,  resulting in formation   of  silicon   tetrachloride   vapors   112,   wherein   a   pipe   113   is connected between the chamber 110 and burners 108, to feed the burners<br><br>

PA/043/SPECIFICATION V-l<br><br>

with the vapors of silicon tetrachloride 112 continuously. A self-generated<br>
vapor pressure forces the silicon tetrachloride vapors 112 towards the<br>
burners 108 through the pipe 113. The amount of liquid silicon tetrachloride<br>
vaporized is replenished with more liquid silicon tetrachloride from a tank<br>
	(not shown in the figure), wherein mass flow controller controls the flow rate<br>
of liquid silicon tetrachloride 111.<br>
In accordance with the conventional ACVD method, gases supporting oxidation  of silicon  containing  material,   for  example  oxygen,   and  heat<br>
	producing gases, for example hydrogen, methane etc., along with oxygen (for<br>
combustion) are supplied to the burners 108. The oxidation of silicon tetrachloride vapors 112 takes place resulting in the formation of silicon dioxide (SiO2), which is generally referred to as soot 107, wherein, the soot 107 formed is deposited onto the cylindrical member 104 and the part of the soot 107 that is not deposited onto the cylindrical member 104 is exhausted through the suction port 120 of the deposition machine 101.<br>
In accordance with the conventional ACVD method, controlling the flow rates of oxidation-supporting gas (oxygen) and heat-producing gases (hydrogen or methane)  controls the temperature of soot deposition.  The temperature of the soot deposition in-turn controls the density of the soot being deposited. As the temperature of the deposition is increased, by increasing the flow of oxygen and hydrogen, the density of the soot deposited is   increased   and   vice   versa,   meaning   thereby,   the   soot   density   is proportional to temperature of soot deposition or soot density is proportional to hydrogen-oxygen flow.<br>
In accordance with the conventional ACVD method, the initial deposition   of   soot    107   comprises   dopant   chemicals   like   germanium tetrachloride, wherein germanium tetrachloride vapors 115a is obtained by vaporizing the liquid germanium tetrachloride 115 contained in the chamber 114, wherein the heater(s) 117 heats the liquid germanium tetrachloride to a temperature above its boiling point. The vapors of germanium tetrachloride 115a are then carried over to the burners 108 through the pipe  116. The	germanium tetrachloride vapors  115a move towards the burners  108 via pipe 116 under self-generated vapor pressure. The role of the dopant, that is,<br><br>

CONFIDENTIAL<br><br>
PA/043/SPECIFICATION V-l<br><br>
19.09.2007<br><br>
germanium tetrachloride, is to increase index of refraction of soot, resulting<br>
in formation of the core region. The germanium tetrachloride vapor flow is<br>
terminated after desired core diameter is obtained. Any other dopant<br>
suitable for increasing the index of refraction of the core can be used in<br>
	place of germanium tetrachloride. (In figure 1, the core soot is indicated by<br>
numeral 103 and the partial clad soot is indicated by numeral 102).<br>
In accordance with the conventional ACVD method the process of soot deposition continues until the required dimension of the soot porous body<br>
	121 is attained necessary for meeting desired core diameter in the optical<br>
fiber preform and the desired core-clad diameter ratio in the fiber. The pure soot deprived of any dopant or soot with a dopant, wherein the dopant is characterized by the property of decreasing the index of refraction of soot, is deposited   as   clad   onto   the   core,   after   terminating   the   germanium tetrachloride vapor flow, resulting in a soot porous body with core and a part of clad.<br>
In an optical fiber about 90 % of the light travels through the core region. If the core region gets contaminated, the attenuation loss of the optical fiber increases. In accordance with the conventional ACVD method, a part of the cladding soot is deposited onto the core soot (soot with dopant), immediately after core deposition, wherein the contamination of the core region is prevented due to direct contact of core soot with the environment. It is observed that if the core part of the optical fiber preform is deposited without deposition of cladding and the core deposited soot porous body is taken out of the soot deposition machine, the core deposited soot porous body may acquire moisture from the surrounding atmosphere, wherein the moisture is observed to increase the attenuation in the wavelength region from about 1360 nm to about 1420 nm, in the optical fiber drawn therefrom; it  also  an  observation   that   the  core   deposited   soot   porous   body  gets contaminated from the surrounding atmosphere (that is dust, metal parts etc.), there is increase in the attenuation loss in the wavelength region from about 1300 nm to about 1625 nm, rendering the optical fiber drawn therefrom unusable for desired applications. Thus, it is desirable to deposit a  part of cladding onto the core, immediately after the core soot (that soot with dopant)   is  deposited.   Accordingly,   a  particular  ratio  of clad  to  core  is<br><br>

maintained to mitigate the above-mentioned problems, wherein this ratio is generally maintained in the range 2 to 5, preferably in the range 2.5 to 3.5 and more preferably in the range 2.7 to 3.4.<br>
	Subsequent to completion of soot deposition, the cylindrical member<br>
             104 is removed from the soot porous body 121, to form hollow cylindrical<br>
soot porous body 201 defining a capillary 204 at the center [herein after<br>
referred to as hollow soot porous body] (figure 2A and figure 2B). The hollow<br>
soot porous body 201 comprises a core region 203, a cladding region 202<br>
	and the capillary 204.<br>
Now referring to figure 2A, figure 2B and figure 3, the hollow soot porous body 201 so formed in accordance with the conventional ACVD method, described above, contains large amount of hydroxyl ion or water or<br>
	moisture as generally referred to. In order to remove the hydroxyl ion content<br>
of the hollow soot porous body 201, it is treated with gases, which chemically reacts with the hydroxyl ions. Halogens or compounds of halogen are generally used for such purpose. This step of removing the hydroxyl content from the hollow soot porous body 201 is known as dehydration or drying, wherein, in this step of dehydration or drying firstly a glass plug 308 is inserted into the end remote from the handle 205 of the hollow soot porous body 201 to close the mouth of the capillary 204, thereafter, the hollow soot porous body 201 is moved into a dehydration and sintering furnace 301.<br><br>
Figure 3 illustrates a dehydration and sintering furnace in accordance with the conventional ACVD method, wherein the dehydration and sintering furnace 301 comprises a high temperature resistant quartz glass body 305. The quartz glass body 305 has three openings, 302 for introducing the gases<br>
	necessary for dehydration and sintering, opening 303 connected to suction<br>
unit (not shown in the figure) to remove the unreacted chemicals and reaction products formed during the dehydration and sintering processes and a mouth 311 to allow the hollow soot porous body to be inserted into the sintering furnace 301. The mouth 311 is covered with plate 306 during the dehydration   and   sintering   processes.   The   temperature   needed   for   the<br><br><br>

dehydration and sintering process is attained by using one or more heaters 304.<br>
Accordingly, the hollow soot porous body 201 is suspended with the help of the suspending device 307 and the hollow handle 205, wherein the capillary 204 of hollow soot porous body 201 is connect to vacuum pump (not shown in figure) via the hollow handle 205 and a pipe 309. One end of the capillary 204 is thus connected to vacuum pump and the other end of the capillary 204 is closed with a glass plug 308. The hollow soot porous body 201 is rotated about the vertical axis of symmetry, in the direction as indicated by the arrow 310, wherein the hollow soot porous body 201 is evenly heated.<br>
In   accordance   with   the   ACVD   method   during   the   process   of<br>
	dehydration   of  the   hollow   soot   porous   body   201,   it   is   heated   to   a<br>
temperature of about 1050°C in an atmosphere of halogens or compounds<br>
thereof to remove the hydroxyl content for a predetermined duration of time.<br>
Thereafter the dehydrated hollow soot porous body 201 is sintered to form a<br>
glass preform in an atmosphere of gases of halogens or compounds thereof<br>
at a temperature of about  1500°C. The step of sintering the hollow soot<br>
porous body 201 into glass is also known as vitrification or consolidation. In accordance with the conventional ACVD method preferably both the dehydration and sintering are carried out in same furnace.<br>
	In accordance with the conventional ACVD method, the capillary 204<br>
in the hollow soot porous body 201 is collapsed either during the sintering step or after the sintering step. After removal of the sintered glass preform (also called as mother preform) from the dehydration and sintering furnace, it is subjected to a process step of rod draw to form a plurality of core rods<br>
	having a predetermined diameter. Optical fiber can also be drawn from the<br>
mother preform at this stage.<br>
                       Figure 4 illustrates a soot deposition machine 401 for deposition of over-cladding or  extra-cladding of the optical fiber preform, wherein the core rod drawn is subjected to a step of soot deposition,  resulting in a soot porous body containing core rod. This step of depositing soot 407 over the<br><br>

CONFIDENTIAL<br><br>
PA/043/SPECIFICATION V-l<br><br>
19.09.2007<br><br>
core rod 403 is called over-cladding or extra-cladding. In accordance with<br>
the conventional ACVD method only a part of cladding is added during the<br>
core deposition process for the reasons discussed above. It is necessary to<br>
add more cladding [referred to as over-cladding hereinafter] to achieve the<br>
desired core-clad ratio in the final optical fiber, meaning thereby, the desired<br>
optical parameters like cutoff wavelength, dispersion etc., are attained in the optical fiber drawn therefrom. Before depositing soot onto the core rod 403, solid glass handles 404 are attached to both ends of the core rod 403, resulting in core rod assembly, wherein the solid glass handles 404 aids in<br>
	handling the optical fiber preform and the soot porous body. The core rod<br>
assembly is transferred to a deposition machine 401 for deposition of cladding portion of the optical fiber preform. The core rod assembly is fixed in the soot deposition machine 401 with the help of chuck 418. The chucks 418, supported on the stands 419, hold the core rod assembly. The chucks<br>
	418 and hence the core rod assembly can be rotated in the direction shown<br>
by arrow 406, while depositing soot 407 onto the core rod assembly, using the burners 408. The burners 408 traverse the core rod assembly (indicated in figure by the arrows 409) or vice versa while depositing the soot 407 onto the core rod assembly.<br><br>
The soot deposition machine 401 differs from the soot deposition machine 101 in that it comprises burners 408 with larger diameter (size) and only one vaporizer 410 for vaporizing liquid silicon tetrachloride 411, wherein the silicon tetrachloride vapors 412 are supplied to the burners 408<br>
	in addition to oxygen (gas supporting combustion) and hydrogen or methane<br>
(gas producing heat). It is known that the soot delivering capacity of the burner is proportional to the diameter of the burner, meaning thereby, larger the burner diameter larger is soot-delivering capacity. The liquid silicon tetrachloride 411 is vaporized by means of heaters 417, wherein the liquid<br>
	silicon tetrachloride is heated to a temperature above its  boiling point,<br>
wherein the silicon tetrachloride vapor 412 is supplied to the burners 408 via pipe 413. Combustion of silicon tetrachloride vapor 412 in presence of hydrogen and oxygen produces the soot (SiO2) 407. The soot that is not deposited  onto  the  core  rod  assembly and  other  reaction  products  are<br>
	exhausted  through   the   port   420  in   the   soot   deposition   machine  401.<br>
Thereafter, the soot porous body 421 so formed with the core rod 403, the<br><br>
8<br><br>
CONFIDENTIAL<br><br>
PA/043/SPECIFICATION V-l<br><br>
19.09.2007<br><br>
soot 402 and the handles 404 intact, is removed from the soot deposition<br>
machine 401 and is transferred to a dehydration and sintering furnace<br>
similar to that for dehydration and sintering of the hollow soot porous body<br>
201. The soot porous body 421 is dehydrated and sintered in the<br>
	dehydration and  sintering furnace resulting in  solid glass  preform,  also<br>
called as the daughter preform. The process of dehydration and sintering is<br>
similar as that for hollow soot porous body 201. The daughter preform is<br>
thereafter removed from the dehydration and sintering furnace and<br>
transferred to optical fiber drawing furnace, wherein optical fiber is drawn<br>
	from the daughter preform.<br>
In accordance with the conventional ACVD method, it is known that the diameter of the cylindrical member 104 used for deposition is critical for two reasons; Firstly, if the diameter of cylindrical member 104 is larger, it is<br>
	observed that the capillary 204 formed in the hollow soot porous body 201,<br>
after removal of cylindrical member 104 is larger, wherein the capillary 204 is found to be difficult to collapse and results in formation of seeds or bubbles in the centerline of the sintered preform. Secondly, if the diameter of the cylindrical member 104 is small, it is observed that more soot cannot be<br>
	deposited,  as  there  is  always  possibility  of breaking  of the  cylindrical<br>
member 104 during the deposition owing to the weight of the deposited soot. Thus, it is necessary to have an optimized diameter of the cylindrical member 104, such that both the problems of formation of bubbles or seeds during the collapsing of large capillary 204 and possibility of breaking of the<br>
	cylindrical   member   during   the   deposition   owing   to   the   weight   of  the<br>
deposited soot are mitigated. It is known in art to use the cylindrical member 104 of diameter in the range 5 mm to 9 mm, wherein the cylindrical member 104 is made up of alumina or quartz or any other material that has low thermal expansion coefficient so that the problems mentioned above are<br>
             mitigated.<br>
It is also known that the soot deposition rate or the weight of soot deposited onto the cylindrical member 104 per unit time, at the beginning of soot   deposition   onto   the   cylindrical   member   104   is   low.   As   the   soot accumulates  on   the  cylindrical  member   104,   the  diameter  of the   soot deposited on the cylindrical member increases and so the soot deposition<br><br>
9<br><br>
CONFIDENTIAL<br><br>
PA/043/SPECIFICATION V-l<br><br>
19.09.2007<br><br>
rate increases, wherein at the start of soot deposition the cross-sectional<br>
area of the cylindrical member 104 as encountered by the soot is small,<br>
thereby the soot deposition rate is low. As the diameter of soot deposited<br>
cylindrical member increases the cross-sectional area of the cylindrical<br>
	member as encountered by the soot increases, thereby the soot deposition<br>
rate increases. In general the rate of soot deposition is proportional to the diameter of the cylindrical member 104, greater the diameter greater the soot deposition rate.<br>
	It is  observed  that the  soot deposition rate can  be  increased  by<br>
increasing the delivery of the soot from the burner, keeping the cylindrical member size in the range 5 mm to 9 mm. But, the soot that is not deposited onto the cylindrical member 104 in this case is more as the cross-sectional area of the cylindrical member as encountered by the soot is less. This<br>
	results in wastage of soot, in particular, since at the initial deposition stage<br>
dopant is used; there is wastage of dopant. This leads to increase in the cost of manufacture.<br>
In accordance with the conventional ACVD method, it is essential to<br>
	deposit a part of cladding onto the core. This constraint of depositing a part<br>
of cladding onto the core limits the increase of soot deposition rate. This<br>
limitation is due to the fact that the burners 108 used for deposition of soot<br>
are having a certain capacity of soot delivery, beyond which the soot<br>
deposition rate cannot be increased. In order to further increase the soot<br>
deposition  rate it is  necessary to  increase  the  burner   108 capacity for<br>
delivering soot, meaning thereby, it is necessary to use burners with large size for soot deposition.<br>
The Japanese patent laid open JP 07-242434 [herein after referred to<br>
	as JP '434] attempts to increase the soot deposition rate (referred to as rate<br>
of sedimentation in JP '434). In accordance with JP '434, the soot deposition<br>
rate is increased by providing multiple burners of two or more kind of<br>
different diameters, wherein the burners are arranged alternately and<br>
traverse along the longitudinal direction of the cylindrical member while<br>
rotating the cylindrical member. When the cylindrical member is thin (at the<br>
start of soot deposition), only the burners with small diameter are used to<br><br>

deposit the soot and when the diameter of soot deposited cylindrical member increases, burners having large diameter are switched-on to deposit the soot.<br>
However, it is observed that in order to provide multiple burners of<br>
	two or more kind of different diameters, in accordance with the invention of<br>
JP '434, it is necessary to modify existing deposition machine and also inevitable to invest capital.<br>
It is observed by the inventors of the present invention that though JP<br>
	'434 does indeed increase the soot deposition rate, but after completion of<br>
the dopant deposition, the apparatus for deposition of the dopant, that is,<br>
the vaporizer 114 for dopant, remains idle, meaning thereby the vaporizer<br>
cannot be utilized for any other deposition. It is an observation of the<br>
inventors of the present invention that about 20 % to about 40 % of the total<br>
deposition time is needed to deposit the core part and remaining about 60 %<br>
to about 80 % of time the clad part is deposited. Thus, about 60 % to about 80 % of the time, the vaporizer for the dopant remains idle.<br>
It is also an observation that the burners with smaller diameter used in the JP '434 remains idle during the deposition of soot with burner of larger  diameter  and  burners  of larger  diameter  remains   unused  when depositing soot with smaller burners.<br>
Further, it is known that the soot density of the deposited soot has to<br>
	follow a  specific  profile,  wherein  the  soot  density  decreases  in  radially<br>
outward direction from the center of the core. The inventors of the present<br>
invention have observed that if there is mismatch in the density of the soot<br>
deposited from the given profile problems like splitting of deposited soot in<br>
the soot porous body formed and further problems like slippage, bubbles<br>
           etc., may occur in the sintered glass preform. It is observed that if the soot<br>
deposited has density mismatch, the presence of hydroxyl ions or moisture<br>
results in increase of attenuation in the wavelength region from about 1360<br>
nm to about 1420 nm in the optical fiber drawn therefrom.     The Japanese<br>
patent JP '434 teaches how to increase the soot deposition rate, but does not<br>
	provides any means or method for matching the  soot density when the<br><br>

CONFIDENTIAL<br><br>
PA/043/SPECIFICATION V-l<br><br>
19.09.2007<br><br>
burners with small diameter stops and burners with large diameter starts soot deposition.<br>
Accordingly,  it is understood that the    JP '434 though capable of<br>
	increasing the rate of soot deposition rate, the modification of the existing<br>
deposition machine and the investment of the capital is inevitable in order to<br>
provide multiple burners of two or more kind of different diameters,  in<br>
accordance with the invention of JP '434.<br>
	The JP '434 fails to utilize the vaporizer for about 60 % to about 80 %<br>
of total time, meaning thereby, the vaporizer 114 for dopant, remains idle, and the vaporizer cannot be utilized for any other deposition, when the cladding portion is being deposited.<br>
	Another  shortcoming of the JP  '434  that when  the  burners with<br>
smaller diameter are used for soot deposition the burners with larger diameter remain idle and when the burners with larger diameter are used for soot deposition the burners of smaller diameter remains unused.<br>
	Still another shortcoming of the   JP '434 is that it fails to disclose<br>
means or method for matching the soot density when the burners with small diameter stops and burners with large diameter starts soot deposition, which is responsible for problems like splitting of deposited soot in the soot porous body   formed   and   further   problems   like   slippage,    bubbles,   interface<br>
	irregularities,   hydroxyl   ions   (and   hence   increased   attenuation   in   the<br>
wavelength region from about 1360 nm to about 1420 nm ) etc., in the sintered glass preform.<br>
Yet another shortcoming of the JP '434 is that about 60 % to 80 % of<br>
	the production capacity of the soot deposition machine is not utilized due to<br>
dopant vaporizer remaining idle.<br>
Accordingly, it is understood from the foregoing description that the<br>
utilization of soot deposition machine, increasing soot deposition rate of soot<br>
	and  thereby  increasing  the   production  capacity  of  the   soot  deposition<br><br>

the scope of the present invention, but incorporated merely for illustrating<br>

Brief Description of the Invention:<br>
It  is  understood  from  the  foregoing  description  that  the  known<br>
	methods for producing the soot porous body (which is further processed to<br>
form optical fiber preform)  suffers from various  shortcomings  as herein described.<br>
The prior art method for producing the soot porous body has been<br>
observed  to have  shortcomings  of not  being suitable  for increasing the<br>
utilization of the  soot deposition machine,  the  soot deposition  rate and<br>
thereby not  suitable  for increasing the  production  capacity  of the  soot<br>
deposition machine for manufacturing the soot porous body.<br>

Still further, the inventors of the present invention have observed that if the conventional methods described above are used for producing optical fiber preform, then about 10 % to 30 % of time is wasted, the production is hampered, that leads to increase in manufacturing cost<br><br>

Accordingly, it is observed that by transferring the intermediate soot<br>
porous body to a second soot deposition machine, the first soot deposition<br>
machine is available for deposition of another intermediate soot porous body.<br>
Since the diameter of the intermediate soot porous body is greater than the<br>
diameter of the cylindrical member and the diameter of the second burners<br>
provided in the second soot deposition machine are is greater than that in<br>
the first soot deposition machine, the soot deposition rate increases in the<br>
step (k) of depositing soot on the intermediate soot porous body, resulting in<br>
formation of final soot porous body in reduced time. Thus, the production<br>
capacity of the first soot deposition machine is increased.<br>
Referring to figure 5, in accordance with the first preferred embodiment of the present invention the soot porous body is manufactured by providing a first soot deposition machine 501 with a plurality of first<br>
	burners 508, having diameter di, for depositing soot, wherein a cylindrical<br>
member 504 is provided over the plurality of first burners 508 while rotating and traversing the cylindrical member 504 (rotation indicated by arrow 506 and traverse movement indicated by arrows 509) over the plurality of first burners 508 or vice-versa, soot 507 is deposited on said cylindrical member<br>
	504 to form intermediate soot porous body 521 having a diameter Di.<br>
In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention the intermediate soot porous body 521 is cooled to room temperature in an atmosphere of nitrogen (or other inert gas like helium, neon, argon etc.).   In<br>
	accordance with  the present invention,  preferably,  the  cooling is  forced<br>
cooling, wherein the intermediate soot porous body 521 is place in a chamber with inert atmosphere and the intermediate soot porous body 521 is cooled in a controlled manner. Forced cooling helps in reducing the time needed for cooling the intermediate soot porous body 521. The provision of<br>
	inert atmosphere prevents contamination of the intermediate soot porous<br>
body 521. It is an observation of the inventors of the present invention that the cooling of the intermediate soot porous body 521 is essential to prevent the splitting of the soot deposited onto it in the subsequent step of deposition.<br><br><br>

The   rest   of  the   steps   are   similar   to   that   followed   in   the   first<br>
	embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Further, in accordance with the present invention the after formation of the final soot porous body, it is cooled to room temperature and the cylindrical member is removed, resulting in formation of the hollow soot<br>
	porous body with capillary at the center. The hollow soot porous body is<br>
dehydrated, sintered and the capillary is collapsed in accordance with the conventional method, to result in formation of a glass preform called mother preform. Either the mother preform is directly drawn into optical fiber or it is drawn into core rods. These core rods are over-cladded to result in formation<br>

In accordance with one preferred embodiment of the present invention the first deposition machine 501 is provided with one or more vaporizers for vaporizing one or more dopant 514, used to increase the refractive index of<br>
	the core region, in addition to the silicon tetrachloride vaporizer 510, that is,<br>
core region (soot with dopant) is deposited, wherein the dopant supply is terminated after a predetermined diameter of soot with dopant is obtained, wherein, only soot is deposited onto the core region to form a part of cladding.<br>
In accordance with other preferred embodiment of the present invention core and a portion of cladding is deposited in the first deposition machine while the remaining part of the cladding is deposited in the second and  third  soot deposition  machines,  wherein  deposition  of a portion  of<br>
	cladding in the first deposition machine immediately after core deposition,<br>
prevents contamination of the core region due to direct contact of core soot with the environment, meaning thereby, the problems of increase in the attenuation in the wavelength region from about 1360 nm to about 1420 nm, in the optical fiber drawn therefrom due to absorption of moisture from<br>
	the  surrounding  atmosphere  and  increase  the   attenuation   loss  in   the<br>

optical fiber drawn therefrom becomes unusable for desired applications due to contamination of deposited soot porous body, in particular the core region, from the surrounding atmosphere are mitigated.<br>
	In  accordance  with  another preferred  embodiment  of the  present<br>
invention the intermediate soot porous body (both first and second) is forced<br>
cooled to room temperature in an inert atmosphere before transferring it to<br>
second or third deposition machine. It is an observation of the inventors of<br>
the present invention that if soot is deposited onto the hot intermediate soot<br>
	porous body (both first and second) splitting of soot deposited occurs.<br>
In accordance with still another preferred embodiment of the present invention static charge generated on the intermediate soot porous body (both first and second) due to heat and rotation is discharged by using ionized<br>
	inert gases for example nitrogen, helium, argon, neon etc, before transferring<br>
it to second or third deposition machine, wherein the step of discharging the static charge assures that the surface of the intermediate soot porous body does not get contaminated due to the possibility of attraction of dust or any other  form  of contamination     due  to   presence  of static  charge  while<br>
	transferring or handling of the intermediate soot porous body.<br>
In accordance with yet another preferred embodiment of the present invention the soot density of the intermediate soot porous body and the soot to be deposited in the subsequent steps has to be matched. It is observed<br>
	that if there is a variation in the soot density, that is, if the density of the<br>
soot deposited onto the intermediate soot porous body (both first and second) is less than the density of the soot of the intermediate soot porous body (both first and second) then there is splitting of soot and if the density of the soot being deposited is greater than the intermediate soot porous body<br>
	(both first and second)  then the hydroxyl ions in the soot porous body<br>
cannot be completely removed, in the subsequent step of dehydration, as the hydroxyl ions are locked in the soot porous body in-addition to the problems of bubbles, slippage etc. The hydroxyl ions in the soot porous body results in increase in attenuation in the resulting optical fiber in the wavelength region<br>
	from about 1360 nm to about 1420 nm. Thus, it is necessary to match the<br><br>

density of the soot to be deposited onto the intermediate soot porous body (both first and second) in order to mitigate the above-mentioned problems.<br>
In   accordance   with   this   embodiment,   the   soot   density   of   the<br>
	intermediate   soot   porous   body   and   the   soot   to   be   deposited   in   the<br>
subsequent steps is matched, wherein the hydrogen (H2) flow (and oxygen (O2) flow) for deposition of soot, in subsequent step, onto the intermediate soot porous body is determined based on the diameter of the intermediate soot porous bodies. 10<br>
Accordingly, the soot density of the intermediate soot porous body and the soot to be deposited in the subsequent steps is matched, wherein the hydrogen  (H2)  flow (and oxygen  (O2)  flow)  are determined  using the formula: <br>
X = 8.73 + (0.624*Di)	(1)<br>
Wherein,<br>
X   is   the   hydrogen   flow   (standard   liters   per   minute)   to   be<br>
	determined,<br>
Di (mm) is the diameter of the intermediate soot porous bodies, and<br>
i = 1 to n, where n is the number of stages involved in preparing a<br>
final soot porous body. The oxygen flow is kept based on the 02/H2 ratio<br>
	and the ratio is kept in between 0.35 to 0.5.<br>
Accordingly, the soot density of the intermediate soot porous body<br>
and the soot to be deposited in the subsequent steps is matched such that<br>
the  soot density follows the  formula  1,  meaning thereby,  the  difference<br>
between   the   soot   density   of   the   soot   layer   being   deposited   on   the<br>
intermediate soot porous body and the density of the soot of the soot porous body is less than or equal to 0.05.<br>
In accordance with the present invention it is observed that it is not<br>
necessary to  provide  multiple  burners  of two  or more  kind  of different<br>

In  accordance  with  the  present  invention  after  completion  of the<br>
dopant deposition, the apparatus for deposition of the dopant, that is, the<br>
vaporizer   114   for  dopant,   does  not  remain  idle,   meaning  thereby  the<br>
vaporizer can be utilized for any other deposition. Thus, about 75 % of the<br>
total deposition time needed to deposit the clad part is saved.<br>
	In accordance with the present invention the burners with smaller<br>
diameter are in separate soot deposition machine and the burners with large diameter are in another soot deposition machine, thus there is no issue of burners remaining idle as in the case of JP '434, wherein during the deposition  of soot  with  burner  of larger  diameter,   burners  with   small<br>
	diameter remain idle and burners of larger diameter remain unused when<br>
depositing soot with smaller burners.<br>
In  accordance  with  the  present  invention  the  soot  density  while depositing the soot onto the intermediate soot porous body is matched by using the formula:<br>
X = 8.73 + (0.624*D;)	(1)<br>
Wherein,<br>
	X  is  the   hydrogen   (H2)   flow   (standard  liters  per  minute)   to   be<br>

	and the ratio is kept in between 0.35 to 0.5.<br>
herein the inventors of the present invention have observed that there is no<br>
mismatch in the density of the soot deposited from the given profile and the<br>
problems like splitting of deposited soot in the soot porous body formed and<br>
further problems like slippage, bubbles, interface irregularities etc., do not<br>

Accordingly, it is understood that the present invention is capable of increasing the  rate  of soot  deposition  rate,   without  modification  of the existing deposition machine and the investment of the capital is inevitable in accordance with the invention of JP '434. <br>
In accordance with the present invention the vaporizer for dopant is utilized to its full extent and does not remains idle as in the case of the Japanese patent JP '434, wherein JP '434 fails to utilize the vaporizer for about 60 % to about 80 % of the total. 10<br>
In accordance with the present invention since the burners with small<br>
diameter and the burners with large diameter are provided in separate soot<br>
deposition machine the shortcoming of the Japanese patent JP '434 that<br>
when the burners with smaller diameter are used for soot deposition the<br>
	burners with larger diameter remain idle and when the burners with larger<br>
diameter  are  used  for  soot  deposition  the  burners  of smaller  diameter remains unused, is eliminated.<br>
In accordance with the present invention the production capacity of<br>
	the first soot deposition machine is increased by about 60 % to 80 %.<br>
It is an advantage of the present that the utilization of soot deposition machine is increased, thereby decreasing the manufacturing time and cost of the soot porous body and hence that of the optical fiber. <br>
It is another advantage of the present invention that rate of soot deposition is increased soot and thereby the production capacity of the soot deposition machine for manufacturing the soot porous body is increased.<br>
	It is still another advantage of the present invention that it is not<br>
necessary to modify existing deposition machine and also not inevitable to invest capital.<br>
It  is  yet  another  advantage   of the  present   invention   that   after<br>
	completion of the dopant deposition, the apparatus for deposition of the<br>
dopant, that is, the vaporizer for dopant, does not remain idle.<br><br>

This is a further advantage of the present invention that the burners with smaller diameter do not remain idle during the deposition of soot with burner of larger diameter and burners of larger diameter do not remain unused when depositing soot with smaller burners. <br>
This   is   still  further  advantage  of the   present   invention   that  the<br>
problem of mismatch  in  the  soot density when  the  burners  with   small<br>
diameter stops and burners with large diameter starts soot deposition, is<br>
mitigated and thereby the problems like splitting of deposited soot in the<br>
soot porous body formed and further problems like slippage, bubbles etc.,<br>
that may occur in the sintered glass preform are also mitigated.<br>
This  is yet  another  advantage  of the  present  invention   that  the<br>
preparation time of the final soot porous body is reduced by about 10 % to<br>
about 30 %.<br>
It  has  been  observed  that  the  optical  fiber  preform  produced  in accordance with the present invention do not have bubbles and/or interface irregularities. <br>
It is an observation that the optical fiber produced in accordance with<br>
the present invention has an attenuation at about 1310 nm of less than or<br>

It may also be noted that the presently disclosed method has been described with reference to ACVD method. However, the present invention method is suitable even for other alternative methods known for producing soot porous body and hence the optical fiber preforms. <br>
It may also be noted that the presently disclosed method is suitable for producing soot porous body, wherein only the extra-cladding is deposited onto the core rod assembly.<br>
	The present invention is now elaborated with the help of following<br>
examples, which are not intended to limit its scope.<br>
Example 1 (Prior art - Conventional ACVD method):<br>
A  cylindrical  member  with  a  hollow  handle  was  fixed  in  a  soot<br>
	deposition machine. The soot deposition machine was provided with two<br>
vaporizers one for formation of silicon tetrachloride vapors and other for the dopant vapors. The soot deposition machine was also provided with a pair of burners with diameter of 65 mm. The soot was deposited onto the cylindrical member while rotating and traversing the cylindrical member in accordance<br>
	with the conventional ACVD  method,  to form core  and clad of the soot<br>
porous body. During the soot deposition process, the dopant germanium tetrachloride vapors were mixed with the soot to form the core portion of the soot porous body and later the supply of the germanium tetrachloride was terminated. Approximately, 900 g of soot with the dopant was deposited onto<br>
	the cylindrical member as core soot, wherein the deposition of 900 g of soot<br>
with the dopant took 180 minutes. Thereafter, 8100 g of soot deprived of any dopant was deposited as clad onto the core soot, wherein deposition of pure 8100 g of soot as cladding took 540 minutes. After formation of the final soot porous body with core and cladding with diameter of 170 mm, the cylindrical<br>
	member was removed from the soot porous body to form hollow soot porous<br>
body with capillary therein. The hollow soot porous body was dehydrated at a temperature of 1050°C in an atmosphere of chlorine and helium gas. The dehydrated hollow soot porous body was sintered at a temperature of 1500°C  in   a  sintering  furnace  wherein  chlorine   and   helium   gases  for<br>
	sintering were  provided,  resulting in  formation  of mother  preform.  The<br>
mother preform was drawn into plurality of core rods. Solid handles were<br><br>

attached to one of the core rods and extra-cladding was deposited onto the<br>
core rod assembly. The soot porous body so formed was dehydrated and<br>
sintered in accordance with the conventional method to form mother<br>
preform. The mother preform was drawn into plurality of core rods. Handles<br>
were attached to one of the core rod and extra-cladding was deposited onto<br>
it. The extra-cladded soot porous body was dehydrated and sintered to form daughter preform, which was drawn into fiber. The fiber characteristics, that is, the cutoff wavelength, the attenuation etc., were found to be the desired ones. It was observed that the deposition of 900 g of soot with dopant takes<br>
	only 180 minutes while deposition of 8100 g of cladding took 540 minutes.<br>
Thus, about 25 % of time was needed to deposit the core portion while 75 % was needed to deposit cladding portion. Thus, for about 75 % of the time the vaporizer for dopant remained unused during the complete deposition process. The burner pair with the diameter 65 mm were used to deposit both<br>
	the core and cladding. The average soot deposition rate was observed to be<br>
12.5 g/min.<br>
Example 2 (Prior art - JP '434):<br>
A  cylindrical  member  with  a  hollow  handle  was  fixed  in  a  soot<br>
	deposition machine. The soot deposition machine was provided with two<br>
vaporizers one for formation of silicon tetrachloride vapors and other for the dopant vapors. The soot deposition machine was also provided with a pair of two kind burners with diameters of 65 mm and 95 mm arranged alternately in accordance with the JP '434. Using the burner pair with the diameter of<br>
	65 mm the soot was with dopant germanium tetrachloride was deposited<br>
onto the cylindrical member while rotating and traversing the cylindrical member over the burners, in accordance with the Japanese patent JP '434 to form core and clad of the soot porous body. Later the supply of the dopant was terminated. Approximately, 900 g of soot with the dopant was deposited<br>
	onto the cylindrical member as core soot, wherein the deposition of 900 g of<br>
soot with the dopant took 180 minutes. Further, the cladding was deposited onto the core soot using the burner pair with diameter of 95 mm. About 8100 g of soot deprived of cladding was deposited as clad onto the core soot, wherein deposition of pure 8100 g of soot as cladding took 480 minutes. The<br>
	hydrogen flow was kept 38 slpm (standard liters per minute) while depositing<br>
with the 95 mm burner. After formation of the final soot porous body with<br><br>

core and cladding with a diameter of 172 mm, the cylindrical member was<br>
removed from the soot porous body to form hollow soot porous body with<br>
capillary therein. The hollow soot porous body was dehydrated at a<br>
temperature of 1050°C in an atmosphere of chlorine and helium gas. The<br>
	dehydrated   hollow  soot  porous  body  was   sintered   at  a   temperature   of<br>
1500°C in a sintering furnace wherein chlorine and helium gases for sintering were provided, resulting in formation of mother preform. The mother preform was drawn into plurality of core rods. Solid handles were attached to one of the core rods and extra cladding was deposited onto the<br>
	core rod assembly. The soot porous body so formed was dehydrated and<br>
sintered in accordance with the conventional method to form mother preform, which was drawn into 100 km of fiber. It was observed that the deposition of 900 g of soot with dopant takes only 180 minutes while deposition of 8100 g of cladding took 480 minutes. Thus, 27 % of time was<br>
	needed  to  deposit the  core  portion  while  73  % was  needed  to  deposit<br>
cladding portion. In comparison with example 1, the total time needed for complete deposition, that is, core and cladding is less by 60 minutes. Thus, for 73 % of the time the vaporizer for dopant and the burners with diameter 65 mm remained unused during the complete deposition process, while the<br>
	burners with diameter 95 mm remained unused for 27 % of the time. The<br>
average soot deposition rate was observed to be 13.6 g/min, which was better than the conventional ACVD method. Further, it was observed that since the density of the soot deposited by the burner pair with diameter of 95 mm was not matched with the density of soot on the cylindrical member,<br>
	deposited with the burner pair of 65 mm, bubbles were observed at the place<br>
on the soot preform where the changeover was taken from 65 mm burner to 95 mm burner.<br>
Example 3 (Present invention - First embodiment):<br>
	A cylindrical member with a hollow handle was fixed in a first soot<br>
deposition machine, wherein the soot first deposition machine was provided with two vaporizers one for formation of silicon tetrachloride vapors and other for the dopant vapors. The first soot deposition machine was also provided with a pair of first burners with diameter of 65 mm. The soot was<br>
	deposited onto the cylindrical member while rotating and traversing the<br>
cylindrical member, to form a core and a portion of clad of the soot porous<br><br>

body. During the soot deposition process, the dopant germanium<br>
tetrachloride vapor was mixed with the soot to form the core portion of the<br>
soot porous body and later the supply of the dopant was terminated.<br>
Approximately, 900 g of soot with the dopant was deposited onto the<br>
	cylindrical member as core soot, wherein the deposition of 900 g of soot with<br>
the dopant took 180 minutes. Thereafter, 1000 g of soot deprived of dopant was deposited as a portion of clad onto the core soot, wherein deposition of pure 1000 g of soot as cladding took 120 minutes. Thus, an intermediate soot porous body with weight of 1900 g and diameter of 72 mm was formed<br>
	with core and a portion of clad. The static charge on the intermediate soot<br>
porous body was discharged with ionized nitrogen gas. Further, the intermediate soot porous body was removed from the first soot deposition machine and transferred to a chamber with nitrogen gas (inert gas) atmosphere, wherein the intermediate soot porous body was forced cooled to<br>
	room temperature. After force cooling of the intermediate soot porous body,<br>
the static charge on the intermediate soot porous body was discharged with ionized nitrogen gas, thereafter the intermediate soot porous body was transferred to a second soot deposition machine provided with a pair of second of burners having diameters 95 mm, greater than the pair of first<br>
	burners.  The  remaining  part  of cladding,  that  is,   7100  g  of soot  was<br>
deposited onto the intermediate soot porous body using the pair of second burners to form final soot porous body with diameter 174 mm. The hydrogen flow for deposition of the soot onto the intermediate soot porous body of diameter 72 mm was determined using the equation (1) to match the density<br>
	of soot to be deposited with the density of intermediate soot porous body.<br>
X = 8.73 + (0.624*D,)	(1)<br>
In this case D1 = 72 mm. The hydrogen flow determined in accordance with the equation (1) is<br>
X = 8.73 + (0.642*72) = 53.7 slpm.<br>
	The soot deposition was started onto the intermediate soot porous body by<br>
keeping the hydrogen flow 53.7 slpm and oxygen flow 22 slpm. The deposition of 7100 g of soot took 250 minutes. The cylindrical member was removed from the final soot porous body to form hollow soot porous body with capillary therein. The hollow soot porous body was dehydrated at a<br>
	temperature of 1050°C in an atmosphere of chlorine and helium gas. The<br>
dehydrated  hollow soot porous  body was  sintered  at a temperature  of<br><br>

sintering were provided, resulting in formation of mother preform. The<br>
mother preform was drawn into plurality of core rods. Solid handles were<br>
attached to one of the core rods and extra cladding was deposited onto the<br>
core rod assembly. The soot porous body so formed was dehydrated and<br>
sintered in accordance with the conventional method similar to daughter<br>
preform. It was observed that the deposition of 900 g of soot with dopant<br>
takes only 180 minutes while deposition of 1000 g of cladding took 120<br>
minutes. Thus, about 180 minutes were needed to deposit the core portion<br>
while 370 minutes were needed to deposit cladding portion. The average soot<br>
deposition rate was observed to be 16.4 g/min. It was further observed that there were no bubbles or interface irregularities formed in the resulting sintered mother preform.<br>

A cylindrical member with a hollow handle was fixed in a first deposition machine, wherein the first deposition machine was provided with two vaporizers one for formation of silicon tetrachloride vapors and other for the dopant vapors. The first deposition machine was also provided with a<br>
	pair of first burners with diameter of 65 mm. The soot was deposited onto<br>
the cylindrical member while rotating and traversing the cylindrical member, to form a core and a portion of clad of the soot porous body. During the soot deposition process, the dopant germanium tetrachloride vapor was mixed with the soot to form the core portion of the soot porous body and later the<br>
	supply of the dopant was terminated. Approximately, 900 g of soot with the<br>
dopant was deposited onto the cylindrical member as core soot, wherein the deposition of 900 g of soot with the dopant took 180 minutes. Thereafter, 1000 g of soot deprived of cladding was deposited as a portion of clad onto the core soot, wherein deposition of pure 1000 g of soot as cladding took 120<br>
	minutes. Thus, first intermediate soot porous body with weight of 1900 g<br>
and diameter of 73 mm was formed with core and a portion of clad. The static charge on the first intermediate soot porous body was discharged with ionized nitrogen gas. Further, the first intermediate soot porous body was removed from the first soot deposition machine and transferred to a chamber<br>
	with nitrogen gas (inert gas) atmosphere, wherein the first intermediate soot<br>
porous body was forced cooled to room temperature. After cooling of the first<br><br>

intermediate soot porous body, the static charge on the first intermediate<br>
soot porous body was discharged with ionized nitrogen gas, thereafter the<br>
first intermediate soot porous body was transferred to a second soot<br>
deposition machine provided with a pair of second of burners having<br>
diameters 95 mm, greater than the pair of first burners. A soot of 3000 g<br>
was deposited onto the first intermediate soot porous body using the pair of second burners to form a second intermediate soot porous body with diameter 140 mm. The deposition of 3000 g of soot took 100 minutes for deposition using the burners with 95 mm diameter. The hydrogen flow for<br>
	deposition  of the  soot onto  the  first intermediate  soot  porous  body of<br>
diameter 73 mm was determined using the equation (1) to match the density of soot to be deposited with the density of first intermediate soot porous body.<br>
X = 8.73 + (0.624*Di)	(1)<br>
	In this case Dl = 72 mm. The hydrogen flow determined in accordance with<br>
the equation (1) is<br>
X = 8.73 + (0.642*73) = 54.3 slpm. The soot deposition was started onto the first intermediate soot porous body by keeping the  hydrogen  flow  54.3  slpm  and  oxygen  flow  21.72  slpm.<br>
 Further, the second intermediate soot porous body with diameter of 140 mm was removed from the second soot deposition machine and transferred to a chamber with nitrogen gas (inert gas) atmosphere, wherein the second intermediate soot porous body was forced cooled to room temperature. After cooling of the second intermediate soot porous body, the static charge on the<br>
	second intermediate soot porous body was discharged with ionized nitrogen<br>
gas, thereafter the second intermediate soot porous body was transferred to a third soot deposition machine provided with a pair of third of burners having diameters 105 mm, the diameter being greater than the pair of first burners and second burners. The remaining part of cladding, that is, 4100 g<br>
	of soot was deposited onto the second intermediate soot porous body using<br>
the pair of third burners to form a final soot porous body with diameter 171 mm. The hydrogen flow for deposition of the soot onto the intermediate soot porous body of diameter 140 mm was determined using the equation (1) to match  the  density  of soot  to  be  deposited  with  the  density  of second<br>
	intermediate soot porous body.<br>
X = 8.73 + (0.624*D.)	(1)<br><br>

In this case Dl = 72 mm. The hydrogen flow determined in accordance with the equation (1) is<br>
X = 8.73 + (0.642* 140) = 96.1 slpm.<br>
The soot deposition was started onto the second intermediate soot porous<br>
body by keeping the hydrogen flow 96.1 slpm and oxygen flow 38.44 slpm.<br>
The cylindrical member was removed from the final soot porous body to form hollow soot porous body with capillary therein. The hollow soot porous body was dehydrated at a temperature of 1050°C in an atmosphere of chlorine and helium gas. The dehydrated hollow soot porous body was sintered at a<br>
	temperature of 1500°C in a sintering furnace wherein chlorine and helium<br>
gases for sintering were provided, resulting in formation of mother preform. The mother preform was drawn into plurality of core rods. Solid handles were attached to one of the core rods and extra cladding was deposited onto the core rod assembly. The soot porous body so formed was dehydrated and<br>
	sintered  in  accordance with  the  conventional  method  to  form  daughter<br>
preform. It was observed that the deposition of 900 g of soot with dopant takes only 180 minutes while deposition of 1000 g of cladding took 120 minutes. Thus, about 180 minutes were needed to deposit the core portion while 340 minutes were needed to deposit cladding portion. The average soot<br>
	deposition rate was observed to be    17.3 g/min. It was further observed that<br>
there were no bubbles or interface irregularities formed in the resulting sintered mother preform.<br>
It is clear from the foregoing examples [ 1 to 4] that the soot deposition<br>
	rate does increase. Similarly, it is also clear that the production capacity of<br>
the first soot deposition machine also increases, as it is not engaged for<br>
deposition of cladding as it was in the case of conventional ACVD method or<br>
 the Japanese patent JP'434.<br><br>
