				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a synergistic herbal insecticidal formulation. More particularly, the present invention relates to a formulation against mosquito larvae. The formulation of the present invention comprises essential oil of medicinal plant Foeniculum vulgare along with the essential oils from other plants useful as insecticide against mosquito larvae. The formulation of the present invention has toxic action against larval stages of malarial vector Anopheles stephensi. This property is attributed to the synergistic combination of essential oil of plant genus Foeniculum vulgare and other essential oils derived from medicinal plants.<br>
Background and prior art references<br>
Mosquitoes are the single largest group of insects, which transmit many diseases like malaria, filaria, Japanese encephalitis and dengue throughout the world. For the management of vector mosquito population, use of chemical insecticides is now being seriously questioned due to various factors like multiple resistance to insecticides, environmental pollution, and high cost.<br>
Anopheles stephensi Liston type form is a major vector of urban malaria in India (Sharma, 1996). This species essentially breeds in contained water habitats such as overhead tanks, water storage at construction sites, piped water leakages in sluice valve chambers, ornamental fountain tanks, cemented pools, wells etc (Kalra and Sharma, 1987). Outbreaks of malaria in urban areas due to A. stephensi at the construction sites have been reported (Kumar et al., 1991; Adak et al., 1994). In India, control of urban malaria is carried out under urban malaria scheme (UMS) which is based on anti-larval methods. At present about 46 million population living in 29 cities is under high risk requiring accelerated urban malaria control program.<br>
Every year, there are an estimated 300 million, cases of malaria throughout the world. Mortality associated with malaria is estimated at 1.1 million deaths per year (WHO 1999) and is rising in tandem with drug resistance (WHO, 1999; Trapc, et al., 1998).<br><br>
Approaches to reducing the incidence of malaria have focused largely on controlling mosquito populations with chemical insecticides and by physical barrier methods (impregnated nets), or by using drugs to prevent infection with malarial parasites (Plasmodium spp).<br>
The continued use of chemical insecticides results in the gradual building up of resistance in mosquitoes as well as in environmental pollution. Chemical insecticides are toxic to the non-target natural predators of mosquitoes, which co-exist with the mosquito larvae. Alternatively, biological control agents, such as larvivorous fish, have been successfully used under bioenvironmental methods for the persistent control of mosquito breeding (Sharma 1986).<br>
The problems presented and created by the spraying of chemical insecticides in malaria control has made it imperative to develop alternate methods of vector control. Biocides offer many advantages over chemicals i.e., high specificity, biodegradability, safety to environment, low cost and in some cases recycling^ properties, these characteristics make the biocide an important and useful tool in integrated vector control program.<br>
Most mosquito control programs aim at larval stages as a target in their breeding sites with larvicides, because adulticides may only reduce adult populations temporarily allowing for rapid upsurges within a few days. Kettle (1995) pointed out that control of immature stages of mosquitoes has traditionally been effected by the application of insecticides as solution in oils, as an emulsion, wettable powders or dusts. However, these have been achieved with the inherent risk of contamination of water used for domestic purposes especially in rural areas where this water provides excellent breeding conditions for mosquitoes. Due to the dramatic increase in resistance of mosquitoes to familiar chemicals in the absence of new compounds, better alternative means of control are sought. The urge for this has increased, especially after recent public awareness of potential hazards emanating from the widespread use of insecticides (Busvine and Pal, 1969; Curtis and Pasteur, 1981; WHO, 1987). One alternative is the use of plant extracts as botanical insecticides (Arnason et al., 1989). A considerable number of plant derivatives have been shown to be effective against a wide array of insect species (Schumutterer, 1990; Elhag et al., 1996; Wilps, 1995; Amorose, 1995), but very few have been reported for larvicidal action against mosquitoes e.g. dichloromethane extract of Abuta grandifolia and Minthostachys setosa against larvae of Aedes aegypti, a mosquito vector of dengu<br><br>
fever (Ciccia et al., 2000) and seed extract of Atriplex canescens against larvae of another mosquito species, Culex quinquefasciatus (Ouda et al., 1998).<br>
There is no record of resistance to whole-plant extracts, possibly due to the synergistic action of many constituents: isolation and administration of a single active agent greatly facilitates the evolution of resistance in parasites (Chawira, et al., 1986) and mosquitoes. It is possible that phytotherapy produces fewer adverse effects than chemotherapy, because there are many active agents, each at a smaller dose than that required when a single agent is administered.<br>
Foeniculum vulgare Mill syn. F. capillaceum Grilib is a aromatic herbaceous plant known locally (in India) as fennel and used as culinary spice. The fruits are aromatic, stimulant and carminative. Official pharmacopoeias of various countries throughout the world list this plant for use in diseases of the chest, spleen and kidney. Fennel is a constituent of liquorice powder and preparation for allaying gripping. F. vulgare has been reported to exhibit many pharmacological effects including antibacterial activity (Ruberto et al., 2000) and toxicity towards stored grain insects (Kim and Ahn, 2001). It is useful in infantile colic and flatulence (Purthi, 1976). In spite of considerable pharmacological studies carried out world wide on F. vulgare fruits survey of scientific literature showed that the essential oil of F. vulgare has not been evaluated against insect vectors of public health like mosquitoes. The applicants have carried out preliminary experiments on essential oil of the fennel fruit (Foeniculum vulgare) to explore whether it posses any toxic and/or behavior modifying effects towards malarial vector, A. stephensi (Liston).<br>
Hitherto known insecticides to control of malarial vector at larval stage are malariol oil, temephos and fenthion, and are being commonly used in anti-larval operations but all these compounds are also toxic to co-existing beneficial organisms.<br>
Hitherto known some plant products have been demonstrated to be effective against mosquitoes (Wilps, 1995; Elhag, 1996). Example include Syzygium aromaticum (L.) (Hassanali et al., 1990), Curcuma raktakanda (Latha and Ammini, 2000), Hydrocotyle jaranica Thunb. (Venkatachalam and Jebanesan, 2001), and Azardirachta indica A. Juss. (Elhag et al., 2001; Prasad, et al., 2001).<br>
During course of our research, in an attempt for preparing insecticides from natural products, the applicants have found that the essential oil of a medicinal plant, Foeniculum vulgare and other plant either singly or in combination can be employed for controlling mosquito, Anopheles stephensi.<br>
The technical ingredient used in the present invention, essential oil of F. vulgare is reported in the literature for toxicity towards insect-pest but not towards A. staphensi. Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of present invention is therefore to provide a composition of essential oils as an herbal larvicide useful in killing mosquito larvae and obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a composition of the plant essential oils as an herbal formulation useful as larvicide for the control of mosquito larvae, which is safe, cheap, biodegradable, environmentally friendly, without any residual effect and commercially viable.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a composition, which is miscible with water enabling it to be compatible with other microorganism present in water.<br>

Essential oils obtained from plant genus Foeniculum vuigare (0.033 ml), Mentha spicata var. viridis (0.021 ml) and Zingiber officinale (0.046 ml) were first mixed with Tween-80 (0.1 ml) of 0.001% concentration and then the mixture was dissolved<br><br>
in water to make the solution of 0.01% concentration. This solution was tested against<br>
mosquito (Anopheles Stephens!) larvae in the laboratory.<br>
Standard WHO test (WHO, 1981) was employed with slight modification in the test<br>
procedure. A single fourth-stage larva was put into each of fifty vials containing 5 ml<br>
of the test solution of each concentration. Single vial with one larva was used in one<br>
replication. Thus a total of 50 insects were used in fifty replications. Mortality data for<br>
mosquito larvae were recorded after 24 hours.<br>
It was observed that combination of essential oils obtained from plant genus<br>
Foeniculum vulgare (0.033 ml), Mentha spicata var. viridis (0.021 ml) and Zingiber<br>
officinale (0.046 ml) (5:3:7) caused 82.0 % mortality at 0.01% concentration under<br>
laboratory conditions.<br>

It was observed that combination of essential oils obtained from plant genus Foeniculum vulgare (0.046 ml), Mentha spicata var. viridis (0.033 ml) and Zingiber officinale (0.021 ml) (7:5:3) caused 86.0 % mortality at 0.01% concentration under laboratory conditions.<br>
EXAMPLE-14<br><br>
This example demonstrate the efficacy of a synthetic chemical, P-Asarone purchased from M/s SIGMA,  USA and taken as standard.  It was tested at 0.0016 % concentration against mosquito (Anopheles Stephens!) larvae in the laboratory. Standard WHO test (WHO, 1981) was employed with slight modification in the test procedure. A single fourth-stage larva was put into each of fifty vials containing 5 ml of the test solution of each concentration. Single vial with one larva was used in one replication. Thus a total of 50 insects were used in fifty replications. Mortality data for mosquito larvae were recorded after 24 hours. It was observed that P-Asarone caused 100.0 % mortality under laboratory conditions.<br>
The summary of results of above examples (1-14) is given in Table-1. Table-1: Killing effect of essential oils or their mixtures against mosquito<br>
Anopheles stephensi larvae (Table Remove)<br>
 It is observed from the above Table-1 that essential oil ofFoeniculum vulgare when mixed with essential oils of other plants like Mentha spicata var. viridis and Zingiber officinale at varying degree of ratio, resulted into varying degree of killing effect towards mosquito larvae. ADVANTAGES<br>
Accordingly, it can be observed that the composition of the present invention is not a<br>
mere admixture having the aggregate properties of all the ingredients but act as a<br>
synergistic mixture resulting in enhanced activity with sustained effect.<br>
The advantage of present invention is that being plant based formulation, it is Eco-<br>
friendly, non-toxic to organisms co-existing with mosquito larvae under natural<br>
habitats and sustainable.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is that, the composition is cheaper and<br>
more effective than other plant products reported like leaf extracts of Ricinus<br>
communis and Azadirachta indica, and due to its water miscibility as an additional<br>
property of the formulation, thereby reducing the harmful effect on other mosquito<br>
larvae co-inhabiting loving organisms.<br>
