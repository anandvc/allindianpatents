				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates generally to a method for preparing a catalyst component for ethylene polymerization and copolymerization. The present invention also relates generally to a catalyst or catalytic system comprising catalyst components prepared by the method of the present invention and an organometallic compound.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION <br>
In recent years, many research projects have been conducted in the field to develop various methods and catalysts for improving the physical properties of polyolefin polymers. <br>
In particular, researchers are interested in finding techniques for reducing the amount of fine particles of polyolefin polymer. Reduction of the amount of fine particles is desirable for a number of reasons. Exemplary reasons include inhibiting the formation of deposits during the polymerization and preventing scattering of fine particles of polymer outside of the system. Furthermore, separation and filtration of the polymer slurry is easier due to a narrower particle size distribution. In addition, the drying efficiency is enhanced due to the improvement in polymer fluidity.  <br>
Japanese application 59-118120 discloses the production of polymer having a low amount of fine particles by utilizing a catalyst system that includes a mixture of an ingredient obtained from the reaction of magnesium, titanium, organoaluminum, silicon and halogenated aluminum compounds in sequence and a catalyst ingredient which is an organometallic compound. WO92/07008 discloses a method of manufacturing a polyolefin using a catalyst system of an ingredient (A) and an ingredient (B) wherein the ingredient (A) is prepared from a metallic magnesium or an oxygen-containing organic compound of magnesium, a mixture of a monohydroxylated organic compound and a polyhydroxylated organic compound, oxygen-containing organic compounds of titanium, halogenated aluminum compound, silicon compound and ingredient B is an organometallic compound of metals from Group Ia, IIa, IIIa or IVa of the Periodic Table. Although the method disclosed by the above-mentioned patent applications may produce polymer with small amount of fine particles, these methods are complicated. <br>
Therefore, there is a demand for catalyst for polymerization and copolymerization of ethylene which can be prepared by a simple process, with high polymerization activity and an ability to facilitate production of polymers with narrow particle size distribution and small amount of fine particles.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is a method for preparing a catalyst component for at least one of polymerization and copolymerization of ethylene comprising the following steps of (i) reacting a magnesium solution with a liquid titanium compound having at least one alkoxy group to form a slurry product, (ii) contacting the slurry product with a liquid titanium halide compound to produce a contact product, (iii) elevating the temperature of the contact product to a temperature of 110°C to 130° C, (iv) maintaining the contact product at this temperature until a solid catalyst component is formed, and (v) washing the solid catalyst component with a halogenated hydrocarbon solution, wherein the solid catalyst component comprises at least one of titanium, magnesium and silicon.<br><br>

Example 1<br>
Preparation of a solid particle catalyst<br>
(1) Preparation of a magnesium solution /homogenous solution<br>
Reactants, namely 10 g (0.105 mol) of MgCl2, 100 ml of decane, 12 ml of 1,2-dichloroethane, and 51 ml (0.325 mol) of 2-ethylhexyl alcohol were introduced into a volumetric flask of 1 Liter. The volumetric flask comprised  a magnetic stirrer therewithin and was blanked with a nitrogen atmosphere. The reactants were mixed by the magnetic stirrer at a stirring speed of 300 rpm, and heated to 130°C, for 3 hours to produce a homogeneous solution or a magnesium solution. The homogenous solution was then cooled to a temperature of 50°C. After the homogenous solution was cooled to 50°C, 12.5 ml (0.037mol) of titanium butoxide was added into the homogenous solution. Mixture of the homogenous solution and titanium butoxide was then stirred at 50°C for 2 hours to produce or obtain a slurry product.<br>
(2) 51 ml (0.47mol) of TiCl4 was dripped into the above slurry product, which was cooled down to 0°C over a time period of 1 hour with stirring. After the addition of TiCl4 into the slurry product was completed, the temperature was maintained at 0°C for a further 1 hour to form a solid product. The solid product is also known as the catalytic component. <br>
(3) The temperature of the above reactants in (1) and (2) was then elevated from 0°C to 50°C over a period of 1 hour. 3 ml (0.27 mol) of tetraethylorthosilicate was added to the above reactants to form a mixture. The temperature of the mixture was then raised to 110°C over a period of 1 hour. The temperature of the mixture was then maintained at 110°C for 2 hours with stirring.<br>
(4) After completion of the steps (1) to (3), the solid product was separated by hot decanter. The solid product is then treated with 200 ml of 1,2-dichloroethane. The decanted solid product was also sufficiently washed with hexane and decane at 100°C until no trace of titanium component in the supernatant was found. <br>
The atomic molar-ratio of titanium to magnesium in the obtained catalyst component was 0.21.<br><br>
Ethylene Polymerization<br>
A 2 liter stainless steel reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer and an advanced temperature controller system was purged with nitrogen atmosphere. 500 ml of hexane was introduced into the reactor. 3 atm of hydrogen was then added after an introduction of 1 mmol of triethylaluminum and the solid catalyst component comprising 0.003 mol of titanium atom.  The temperature of the reactor was increased to 80°C. Stirring speed of the mechanical stirrer was set at 500 rpm. Ethylene was added into the reactor and the pressure of ethylene within the reactor was set at 8 atm. The polymerization of ethylene (i.e. polymerization reaction) was performed for 2 hours. After the polymerization reaction, the temperature of the reactor was reduced to room temperature, and the pressure within the reactor was released. A predetermined amount of ethanol was introduced into the reactor to stop the polymerization reaction.

Existing Method<br>
Preparation of a solid particle catalyst<br>
In a 1 liter glass reactor, 10 g (0.105 mol) of MgCl2 was suspended in 300 ml of hexane. To the suspension of MgCl2 and hexane, 42 ml (0.714 mol) of ethanol was introduced over a period of 1 hour. Temperature of the suspension of MgCl2 and hexane is controlled at 20°C with stirring. Reaction between the MgCl2 and hexane occurs during the stirring for another 1 hour at 20°C. 85 gram (0.315 mol) of diethylaluminum chloride was then dropped or introduced into the suspension of MgCl2 and hexane to form a mixture, which is maintained at a temperature of at 20°C for one more hour with stirring. Next, 40.3 ml (0.368) of TiCl4 was slowly added into the mixture at 30°C with stirring. The temperature was raised to 80°C over a period of 2 hours and  a catalyst is produced.<br>
After the reaction was completed, a solid catalyst was separated from the mixture, which is at a liquid phase, at room temperature. The solid product was sufficiently washed with hexane until no titanium component in the supernatant was found. The final solid catalyst was obtained in the form of a suspended solid catalyst in a hexane solvent. The atomic molar-ratio of titanium to magnesium in the obtained catalyst was 0.13.<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
Method for Preparing a Catalyst Component for Ethylene Polymerization and Copolymerization<br><br>
	The present invention discloses a method for preparing a catalyst component for polymerization and copolymerization of ethylene. The method comprises a step of reacting a magnesium solution with a liquid titanium compound having at least one alkoxy group to form a slurry product. The method further comprises contacting the slurry product with a liquid titanium halide compound to produce a contact product, elevating  temperature of the contact product to a temperature between and including 110°C and 130°C, and maintaining the contact product at this temperature until a solid catalyst component is formed. During elevation of the temperature of the contact product, an organosilicon compound having no active hydrogen is added to the contact product. The solid catalyst component is washed with a halogenated hydrocarbon solution. Furthermore, the solid catalyst component can be treated at least once with an additional liquid titanium compound having at least one halogen ligand before washing with the halogenated hydrocarbon solution.<br>
	The catalyst component prepared by the method of the present invention shows enhanced catalytic activity and it also results in decreasing quantities of fine particles or low polymers produced. Furthermore, polymers produced using the catalyst component of the present invention have a narrow particle size distribution, which results in improvement of polymer flowability during the polymerization process.</td>
