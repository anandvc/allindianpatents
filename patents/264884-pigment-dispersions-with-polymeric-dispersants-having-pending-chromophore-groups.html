Description<br>
PIGMENT DISPERSIONS WITH POLYMERIC DISPERSANTS HAVING<br>
PENDING CHROMOPHORE GROUPS<br>
Technical field<br>
[0001]  The present invention relates to stable pigment dispersions and pigmented Inkjet inks comprising colour pigments that are stabilized by polymeric dispersants having pending chromophore groups which exhibit a structural similarity with the colour pigment.<br>
Background art<br>
[0002]  Pigment dispersions are made using a dispersant. A dispersant is a<br>
substance for promoting the fonnation and stabilization of a dispersion of pigment particles in a dispersion medium. Dispersants are generally surface-active materials having an anionic, cationic or non-ionic structure. The presence of a dispersant substantially reduces the dispersing energy required. Dispersed pigment particles may have a tendency to re-agglomerate after the dispersing operation, due to mutual attraction forces. The use of dispersants also counteracts this re-agglomeration tendency of the pigment particles.<br>
[0003]  The dispersant has to meet particulariy high requirements when used for inkjet inks. Inadequate dispersing manifests itself as increased viscosity in liquid systems, loss of brilliance and/or hue shifts. Moreover, particulariy good dispersion of the pigment particles is required to ensure unimpeded passage of the pigment particles through the nozzles of the print head, which are usually only a few micrometers in diameter. In addition, pigment particle agglomeration and the associated blockage of the printer nozzles has to be avoided in the standby periods of the printer.<br>
[0004]   Polymeric dispersants contain in one part of the molecule so-called anchor groups, which adsorb onto the pigments to be dispersed. In a spatially separate part of the molecule, polymeric dispersants have polymer chains sticking out and whereby pigment particles are made compatible with the dispersion medium, i.e. stabilized.<br>
[0005]  The properties of polymeric dispersants depend on both the nature of the monomers and their distribution in the polymer. Polymeric dispersants<br><br>
obtained by randomly polymerizing monomers (e.g. monomers A and B polymerized into ABBAABAB) or by polymerizing altemating monomers (e.g. monomers A and B polymerized into ABABABAB) generally result in a poor dispersion stability. Improvements in dispersion stability were obtained using graft copolymer and block copolymer dispersants.<br>
[0006]  Graft copolymer dispersants consist of a polymeric backbone with side chains attached to the backbone.<br>
CA 2157361 (DU PONT) discloses pigment dispersions made by using a graft copolymer dispersant with a hydrophobic polymeric backbone and hydrophilic side chains.<br>
[0007]   Block copolymer dispersants containing hydrophobic and hydrophilic blocks have been disclosed in numerous Inkjet ink patents. US 5859113 (DU PONT) discloses an AB block copolymer dispersant with a polymeric A segment of polymerized glycidyl (meth)acrylate monomers reacted with an aromatic or aliphatic carboxylic acid, and a polymeric B segment of polymerized alkyl (meth)acrylate monomers having 1-12 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, hydroxy alky! (meth)acrylate monomers.<br>
[0008]   In the design of polymeric dispersants for aqueous Inkjet inks, the above mentioned anchor groups, which adsorb onto the pigments to be dispersed, are generally hydrophobic groups exhibiting an affinity for the pigment surface.<br>
[0009]    EP 0763580 A (TOYO INK) discloses an aqueous type pigment<br>
dispersing agent having a portion which has a high affinity with a pigment and which has at least one type selected from the group consisting of an organic dye, anthraquinone and acridone only at a temiinal end or at both terminal ends of at least one aqueous polymer selected from the group consisting of an aqueous linear urethanic polymer and an aqueous linear acrylic polymer. EP 0763378 A (TOYO INK) discloses similar pigment dispersing agents for non-gqueous pigment dispersions.<br>
[0010]    US 5420187 (TOYO INK) discloses a pigment-dispersing agent obtained by polymerizing an addition-polymerizable monomer having an acidic functional group and other addition-polymerizable monomer in the<br><br>
presence of a polymerization initiator, the polymerization initiator being a diazotization product prepared by diazotizing at least one compound selected from the group consisting of an anthraquinone derivative having an aromatic amino group, an acridone derivative having an aromatic amino group and an organic dyestuff having an aromatic amino group. In this pigment-dispersing agent, the colorant is located in the polymeric backbone itself.<br>
[0011]    US 2003044707 (TOYO INK) discloses a dispersing agent for a pigment, comprising a specific compound having a structure wherein a phthalocyanine type molecular skeleton which is adsorptive on the pigment and an oligomer unit or polymer unit which prevents re-agglomeration of the pigment to bring out the effect of dispersion are covalently bonded, and having affinity for a medium or a solvent.<br>
[0012]  Current practice is that the exact or almost the exact chemical structure of the colour pigment is incorporated as the anchor group in the polymeric dispersing agent to assure maximum affinity with the colour pigment. As a consequence, each pigment has its own tailor made polymeric dispersant. In practice, this requires the holding of an inventory of different polymeric dispersants for producing a complete range of colour Inkjet ink sets. The cyan ink with copper phthalocyanine as pigment is a rare exception in that all desired properties are combined in the same pigment But yellow pigments have to be selected based on the properties that are the most important in their application of Inkjet ink. For example, some yellow pigments are selected for their light stability, while others are selected to obtain images having high colour strength. The holding of such an inventory of different types of polymeric dispersants incurs financial penalties due to additional storage and logistical requirements as well as increasing the possibility of using the "wrong" polymeric dispersant for the production of a particular Inkjet ink. Another disadvantage is that the low solubility of the pigment generally complicates the synthesis of such polymeric dispersants.<br>
[0013]   US 2004194665 (BASF) relates to pigment dispersions comprising for a pigment dispersant a substituted perylene derivatives in which the<br><br>
substituent has a sterically stabilizing and/or electrostatically stabilizing effect. The perylene derivatives are used to disperse pigments with a quite different chemical structure such as quinacridone pigments. No other pigment derivatives are disclosed.<br>
[0014]   WO 2005056692 (SUN CHEMICAL) discloses highly concentrated<br>
colorant dispersions comprising: (a) at least about 45 wt. % of a pigment; and (b) a polymeric colored dispersant having the structure A- (B-X)n, wherein: A is an organic chromophore; B is a covalently bonded linking moiety; X is a branched or linear C50"C2oo polymeric covalently linked hydrocarbon; and n is an integer from 1 to 4. The chromophore group A is present in the polymeric dispersant either as an end group or in the polymeric backbone. The polymeric dispersants are used for dispersing pigments with quite different chemical structure compared to frie chromophore group A.<br>
[0015]    US 4664709 (HOECHST) discloses pigment compositions comprising azoacylacetamide dispersing agents for azo pigments bearing some resemblance to the chromophore group of the dispersing agent. The chromophore group is present in the polymeric dispersant as an end group.<br>
[0016]   GB 1343606 (ICI) discloses pigment dispersions containing a dyestuff of the formula D-(Z-O.OCR)n in which D is the radical of a dyestuff which is attached to Z through a carbon atom of an aromatic ring present in D, Z is a divalent bridging group, n is an integer of 1-8 and R is the residue of a carboxy ended polyester RCOOH derived from a hydroxycarboxylic acid of the fomnula HO-X-COOH in which X is a divalent saturated or unsaturated aliphatic radical containing at least 8 carbon atoms and in which there are at least 4 carbon atoms between the hydroxy and carboxy acid groups, or from a mixture of such a hydroxycarboxylic acid and a carboxylic acid free from hydroxy groups. In the examples the pigments are dispersed with dyestuffs having a radical D of approximately the same or higher molecular weight compared to the pigment. The radical of a dyestuff D is present in the polymeric dispersant either as an end group or in the polymeric backbone.<br><br>
[0017]   GB 1424517 (ICI) discloses dispersions of an organic pigment in a solvent medium which contains dissolved therein a dispersing agent of the formula D"(Z-R)n wherein D is the radical of a dyestuff which is attached to Z through a carbon atom of an aromatic ring present in D; Z is a divalent bridging group; n is a positive integer having a value of from 1 to 8; and R is the residue of an optionally substituted addition polymer chain. In the examples the p-form copper phthalocyanine pigment is dispersed by dispersing agents having a radical D of a higher molecular weight compared to the pigment. The radical of a dyestuff D is present in the polymeric dispersant either as an end group or in the polymeric backbone.<br>
[0018]  Polymeric nanoparticles with at least one chromophore group are<br>
disclosed as new colorants by EP 1245644 A (ROHM &amp; HAAS), but they are not disclosed as polymeric dispersants for colour pigments,<br>
[0019]   JP 2003-096191 A (RICOH) discloses quinacridone derivatives, indigo derivatives, diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives and isoindolinone derivatives as a colorant in electrophoretic image displays. It is not disclosed if these dye derivatives can be used as a polymeric dispersant for a colour pigment.<br>
[0020]   JP 2004-002529 A (KONICA MINOLTA) discloses aqueous dispersions of colored microparticles which are prepared by polymerizing monomers comprising a chromophore group. The suitability of these colored microparticles as polymeric dispersants is not addressed.<br>
[0021]  For consistent image quality, the Inkjet ink requires a dispersion stability capable of dealing with high temperatures (above 60°C) during transport of the ink to a customer and changes in the dispersion medium of the Inkjet ink during use, for example, evaporation of solvent and increasing concentrations of humectants, penetrants and other additives.<br>
[0022] Therefore, it is highly desirable to be able to manufacture a range of stable pigmented Inkjet inks using a single polymeric dispersant obtained by simple synthesis.<br>

polymeric dispersant obtainable by uncomplicated synthesis and suitable for different colour pigments.<br>

[0025]   It is a further object of the present invention to provide inkjet inks producing images of high image quality with a high optical density.<br>
[0026]  Further objects of the invention will become apparent from the description hereinafter.<br>

[0065] The polymeric dispersant is used in the pigmented Inkjet ink in an amount of 5 to 600 wt%. preferably 10 to 100 wt% based on the weight of the pigment.<br>
Polymeric backbones<br><br>
[0066]  The polymeric backbone of the polymeric dispersant used in the<br>
pigmented inkjet ink according to the present invention is required for the compatibility between polymeric dispersant and dispersion medium.<br>
[0067]  It is not required that the polymeric backbone has an affinity for the pigment. For example, the polymeric backbone of a dispersant for aqueous inkjet inks can be a homopolymer of acrylic acid monomers. A homopolymer is generally incapable of dispersing pigments, but the presence of a pending chromophore group exhibiting a similarity with the pigment ensures an adequate affinity between polymeric dispersant and pigment surface.<br>
[0068]  The polymeric backbone can also be a statistical copolymer, a block copolymer, a graft copolymer, a comb polymer or an alternating copolymer. Also suitable as polymeric backbone is a gradient copolymer as disclosed by MATYJASZEWSKI, K., et al. Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization. Chem. Reviews 2001. vol.101, p.2921-2990. Sometimes it can be useful to include a number of monomers with a high affinity for the pigment surface to enhance certain properties of the inks, e.g. dispersion stability. For example, the polymeric backbone of a dispersant for aqueous inkjet inks may contain hydrophobic monomers to increase the affinity of the polymeric dispersant for the pigment surface. However in enhancing this affinity for the pigment surface, care should be taken that enough of the polymeric backbone sticks out to make the pigment particles compatible with the dispersion medium.<br>
[0069]   In graft copolymers the use of grafted chains of methoxypolyethyleneglycol (MPEG) has been found to be very advantageous in aqueous inkjet inks. For solvent-based inkjet inks the use of grafted chains of polyester were found to be very advantageous. A preferred MPEG macromonomer is BISOMER™ MPEG 350MA (methoxypolyethyleneglycol methacrylate) from LAPORTE INDUSTRIES LTD.<br>
[0070]  For radiation curable inks with the dispersion medium comprising or<br>
consisting of monomers and/or oligomers, many (co)polymers having good solubility in the dispersion medium were found to be suitable for the polymer backbone of the polymeric dispersant;<br><br>
[0071]  The copolymeric backbone consists preferably of no more than 2 or 3 monomer species.<br>
[0072]  The monomers and/or oligomers used to prepare the polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention can be any monomer and/or oligomer found in the Polymer Handbook, Vol. 1+2. 4th edition. Edited by J. BRANDRUP, et al. Wiley-lnterscience . 1999.<br>
[0073]  Suitable examples of monomers include: acrylic acid, methacrylic acid,<br>
maleic acid, acryloyloxybenzoic acid and methacryloyloxybenzoic acid (or their salts), maleic anhydride; alkyl(meth)acrylates (linear, branched and cycloalkyl) such as methyl(meth)acrylate, n-butyl(meth)acrylate, tert-butyl(meth)acrylate, cyclohexyl(meth)acrytate and 2-ethylhexyl(meth)acrylate; aryl(meth)acrylates such as benzyl(meth)acrylate and phenyl(meth)acrylate; hydroxyalkyl(meth)acrylates such as hydroxyethyl(meth)acrylate and hydroxypropyl(meth)acrylate; (meth)acrylates with other types of functionalities (e.g. oxirane, amino, fluoro, polyethylene oxide, phosphate-substituted) such as glycidyl (meth)acrylate, dimethylaminoethyl(meth)acrylate, trifluoroethyl acrylate, methoxypolyethyleneglycol (meth)acrylate and<br>
tripropyleneglycol(meth)acrylate phosphate; allyl derivatives such as allyl glycidyl ether; styrenics such as styrene, 4-methylstyrene, 4-hydroxystyrene, and 4-acetoxystyrene; (meth)acrylonitrile; (meth)acrylamides (including N-mono and N,N-disubstituted) such as N-benzyl (meth)acrylamide; maleimides such as N-phenyl maleimide, N-benzyl maleimide and N-ethyl maleimide; vinyl derivatives such as vinylcaprolactam, vinylpyrrolidone, vinylimidazole, vinylnaphthalene and vinyl halldes; vinylethers such as vinylmethyl ether; and vinylesters of carboxylic acids such as vinylacetate and vinylbutyrate.<br>
Linking groups<br>
[0074]  The pending chromophore group is linked by a linking group to the<br>
polymeric backbone. The linking group contains at least one carbon atom, one nitrogen atom, one oxygen atom, one phosphorous atom, one silicon atom, one sulphur atom, one selenium atom or one tellurium atom.<br><br>
[0075]  The linking group consists of all atoms between the polymeric backbone and the first atom of the aromatic group by which the pending chromophore group is linked to the polymeric backbone.<br>
[0076]   In one embodiment, the linking group is the result of modification of a<br>
(co)polymer with a chromophore having a reactive group. Suitable reactive groups on the chromophore include thiol groups, primary or secondary amino groups, carboxylic acid groups or salts thereof, hydroxyl groups, isocyanate groups and epoxy groups. Typical covalent bonds formed by reaction of the chromophore with the polymeric backbone include an amide, an ester, a urethane, an ether and a thioether.<br>
[0077]   In another embodiment, the polymeric dispersant is prepared by<br>
copolymerizing monomers of the polymeric backbone and monomers containing a chromophore group. In this case the linking group is already present in the monomer. This polymerization method offers the advantage of well-controlled design of polymeric dispersants for a wide variety of dispersion media. Due to its low solubility, a monomer containing the complete colour pigment as a chromophore group poses problems both in the synthesis of the polymeric dispersants, as well as the suitability of the polymeric dispersant for a wide variety of dispersion media and pigments.<br>
[0078]  The linking group has preferably a molecular weight smaller than the<br>
molecular weight of the pending chromophore group, more preferably the linking group has a molecular weight smaller than 80% than the molecular weight of the pending chromophore group, and most preferably the linking group has a molecular weight smaller than 50% than the molecular weight of the pending chromophore group.<br>
Pending chromophore groups<br>
[0079]  The pending chromophore group of the polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention exhibits a similarity with the colour pigment of the pigmented Inkjet ink, and has a molecular weight which is smaller than 93%, preferably smaller than 85%, more preferably smaller than 75% and most preferably smaller than 65% of the molecular weight of the colour pigment.<br><br>
[0080]  The pending chromophore group is a derivative from a colour pigment selected from the group consisting of monoazo pigments, disazo pigments, p-naphtol pigments, naphtol AS pigments, azo pigment lakes, benzimidazolone pigments, disazo condensation pigments, metal complex pigments, isoindoiinone pigments, isoindolinine pigments, phthalocyanine pigments, quinacrldone pigments, diketopyrrolo-pyrrole pigments, thioindigo pigments, anthraquinone pigments, anthrapyrimidine pigments, indanthrone pigments, flavanthrone pigments, pyranthrone pigments, anthanthrone pigments, isoviolanthrone pigments, aluminium pigment lakes, dioxazine pigments, triarylcarbonium pigments and quinophthalone pigments<br>
[0081] At most 30 % of the monomer units of the polymeric backbone of the polymeric dispersant used In the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention have a pending chromophore group.<br>
[0082] At least 2 % of the monomer units of said polymeric backbone of the polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention have a pending chromophore group.<br>
[0083] Preferably between 5 and 30 % of the monomer units of the polymeric backbone of the polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention have a pending chromophore group.<br>
[0084]  More preferably between 10 and 30 % of the monomer units of the<br>
polymeric backbone of the polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention have a pending chromophore group.<br>
[0085]  Polymeric dispersants having a homopolymer or statistical copolymer as polymeric backbone with more than 45 percent of the monomeric units of the polymeric backbone having pending chromophore groups exhibit problems of solubility of the polymeric dispersant in the dispersion medium and deterioration of the dispersing properties due to the fact that the dispersant would go flat on the pigment surface. However, in the case of a well-defined block-copolymer a good dispersion can be obtained with 50 percent of the monomeric units of the polymeric backbone having pending<br><br>
chromophore groups. This well-defined block-copoiymer preferably has at least one block containing no pending chron^iophore groups.<br>
[0086]   In some cases, the dispersion stability of the pigment according to the present invention can be further improved by increasing the number of pending chromophore groups in the polymeric dispersant. In a preferred embodiment, two, three or more pending chromophore groups are located in close proximity of each other on the polymeric backbone. Close proximity means preferably less than 50 monomeric units, more preferably less than 20 monomeric units and most preferably less than 10 monomeric units between two pending chromophore groups. It is believed that the dispersion stability improvement by more pending chromophore groups is due to the dynamic character of the attaching and detaching of the pending chromophore group to the pigment surface. By increasing the number of pending chromophore groups, the probability that all pending chromophore groups will be in a "detached state" at the same time is. expected to decrease.<br>
[0087]   In one embodiment the pending chromophore group of the polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention is represented by Formula (I)<br><br>
wherein,<br>
L is a linking group forming a covalent bond with the polymeric backbone;<br>
and<br>
R1 to R8 are independently selected from the group consisting of<br>
hydrogen, an alkyl group and a halogen. Preferably the linking group<br>
contains at least one atom selected from the group consisting of an<br>
oxygen atom, a nitrogen atom and a sulphur atom.<br><br>
[00S8]  In another embodiment the pending chromophore group of the polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented inl^jet ink according to the present invention is represented by formula (II):<br><br>

one of L1, L2 or L3 is said linking group and is selected from the group consisting of an aliphatic group, a substituted aliphatic group, an unsaturated aliphatic group and a substituted unsaturated aliphatic group; LI, L2 and/or L3, if not representing said linking group, are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, an alkyl group, an alkenyl group, an alkoxy group, a carboxylic acid group, an ester group, an acyl group, a nitro group and a halogen; AR1 and AR2 represent an aromatic group; and n represents the integer 0 or 1. [0089]   In a preferred embodiment the pending chromophore group of the polymeric dispersant may be represented by fonnula (111):<br><br><br>
wherein,<br>
one of R1 to R11 is said linking group forming a covalent bond with said<br>
polynneric backbone;<br>
R1 to R11, if not representing said linking group, are independently<br>
selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, an alky! group, an alkenyl<br>
group, an alkoxy group, an alcohol group, a carboxyiic acid group, an ester'<br>
group, an acyl group, a nitro group and a halogen; or<br>
R7 and R8 may together form a heterocyclic ring. Preferably the<br>
heterocyclic ring fomied by R7 and R8 is imidazolone or<br>
2,3-dihydroxypyrazine, so that a benzimidazolone ring and a<br>
2,3-dihydroxyquinoxaline ring respectively are formed in Formula (III).<br>
Synthesis<br>
[0090] The polymerization process may be a condensation polymerization, in<br>
which the chain growth is accompanied by elimination of small molecules such as water or methanol or an addition polymerization, in which the polymer is fomied without the loss of other materials. Polymerization of the monomers can be conducted according to any conventional method such as bulk polymerization and semi-continuous polymerization.<br>
[0091]  The synthesis is preferably perfomed by a controlled radical<br>
polymerization (CRP) technique. Suitable polymerization techniques include ATRP (atom transfer radical polymerization), RAFT (reversible<br><br>
addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization), MADIX (reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer process, using a transfer active xanthate), catalytic chain transfer (e.g. using cobalt complexes), GTP (group transfer polymerization), or nitroxide (e.g. TEMPO) mediated polymerizations.<br>
[0092]  In one embodiment the polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention is prepared by a post-polymerization modification with a chromophore. The chromophore is covalently linked to the polymer backbone of the polymeric dispersant. The post-polymerization modification can be any suitable reaction, e.g. an esterification reaction.<br>
[0093]  An esterification reaction suitable for post-polymerization modification can be performed using N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole (GDI). In a first step, the carboxylic moieties of the polymer are activated with GDI to form an intermediate imidazole, which is then esterified with the chromophore having a reactive hydroxyl group. The completion of the first step can be observed when the GO2 degassing stops. Synthesis scheme with R representing the chromophore group:<br><br>
Side products of the reaction can be removed by acidifying the aqueous medium used for precipitation of the polymer (hydrolysis of remaining activated esters and protonation of imidazole that remains in water, in this way achieving the separation from the polymer). If the final modified polymer is water-soluble (e.g. modified homopolymer of acrylic acid), a dialysis can be performed to purify the polymer. [0094]   In another embodiment the polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention is prepared by a<br><br>
copolymerization with a monomer containing a ciiromophore group. It was observed that the pigment-based monomers containing a chromophore group were stable in the presence of radicals. Classical free radical polymerization (FRP) techniques for preparing statistical copolymers in a one reactor polymerization and ATRP for preparing block copoFymers were possible to prepare the polymeric dispersant used in the present invention.<br>

[0099]   In another embodiment AR2 of Formula (GEN-I) is replaced by an aliphatic substituent with a poiymerisable functional group, preferably an ethylenically unsatured poiymerisable functional group. Preferably this aliphatic ethylenically unsatured poiymerisable functional group is<br><br>

Sometimes, it can be advantageous to add a small amount of an organic solvent to improve the dissolution of the dispersant.

[0124]  Suitable organic solvents include alcohols, aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones, esters, aliphatic hydrocarbons, higher fatty acids, carbitols. cellosolves, higher fatty acid esters.

Also glycol, glycoiethers, N-methylpyrroIidone, N,N-dimethylacetamid, N, N-dimethylformamid may be used,<br>
[0125]  Suitable monomers and oligomers can be found in Polymer Handbook, Vol. 1 + 2. 4thth edition. Edited by J. BRANDRUP, et al. Wiley-Interscience , 1999.<br>

Suitable pH adjusters include NaOH, KOH, NEts, NH3, HCI, HNO3, H2S04and (poly)alkanolamines such as triethanolamine and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanoL Preferred pH adjusters are NaOH and H2SO4.<br>
Humectants/Penetrants<br>
[0134]  Suitable humectants include triacetin, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, glycerol, urea, thiourea, ethylene urea, alkyl urea, alkyl thiourea, dialkyi urea and dialkyi thiourea, diols, including ethanediols, propanediols, propanetriols, butanediols, pentanediols, and hexanediols; glycols, including propylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, and mixtures and derivatives thereof.

Preparation of a pigmented Inkjet ink<br><br>
[0135]  The pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention may be<br>
prepared by precipitating or milling the pigment in the dispersion medium in the presence of the polymeric dispersant.<br>
[0136]   Mixing apparatuses may include a pressure kneader, an open kneader, a planetary mixer, a dissolver, and a Dalton Universal Mixer. Suitable milling and dispersion apparatuses are a ball mill, a pearl mill, a colloid mill, a high-speed disperser, double rollers, a bead mill, a paint conditioner, and triple rollers. The dispersions may also be prepared using ultrasonic energy.<br>
[0137]  Many different types of materials may be used as milling media, such as glasses, ceramics, metals, and plastics. In a preferred embodiment, the grinding media can comprise particles, preferably substantially spherical in shape, e.g. beads consisting essentially of a polymeric resin or yttrium stabilized zirconium beads.<br>
[0138]  In the process of mixing, milling and dispersion, each process is preferably performed with cooling to prevent build up of heat.<br>
[0139]   In the process of mixing, milling and dispersion, each process is performed with cooling to prevent build up of heat, and for radiation curable Inkjet inks as much as possible under light conditions in which actinic radiation has been substantially excluded.<br>
[0140]  The Inkjet ink according to the present invention may contain more than<br>
one pigment, the Inkjet ink may be prepared using separate dispersions for each pigment, or alternatively several pigments may be mixed and co-milled in preparing the dispersion.<br>
[0141]  The dispersion process can be carried out in a continuous, batch or semi-batch mode.<br>
[0142]  The preferred amounts and ratios of the ingredients of the mill grind will vary widely depending upon the specific materials and the intended applications. The contents of the milling mixture comprise the mill grind and the milling media. The mill grind comprises pigment, polymeric dispersant and a liquid carrier such as water. For Inkjet inks, the pigment is usually present in the mill grind at 1 to 50 wt%, excluding the milling<br><br>
media. The weight ratio of pigment over polymeric dispersant is 20:1 to 1:2.<br>
0143]  The milling time can vary widely and depends upon the pigment,<br>
mechanical means and residence conditions selected, the initial and desired final particle size, etc. In the present invention pigment dispersions with an average particle size of less than 100 nm may be prepared.<br>
0144]  After milling is completed, the milling media is separated from the milled particulate product (in either a dry or liquid dispersion form) using conventional separation techniques, such as by filtration, sieving through a mesh screen, and the like. Often the sieve is built into the mill, e.g. for a bead mill. The milled pigment concentrate is preferably separated from the milling media by filtration.<br>
0145]   In general it is desirable to make the Inkjet inks in the form of a<br>
concentrated mill grind, which is subsequently diluted to the appropriate concentration for use in the Inkjet printing system. This technique permits preparation of a greater quantity of pigmented ink from the equipment. By dilution, the Inkjet ink is adjusted to the desired viscosity, surface tension, colour, hue, saturation density, and print area coverage for the particular application.<br>
Spectral Separation Factor<br>
0146]  The spectral separation factor SSF was found to be an excellent measure to characterize a pigmented Inkjet ink, as it takes into account properties related to light-absorption (e.g. wavelength of maximum absorbance Amax, shape of the absorption spectrum and absorbance-value at Amax) as well as properties related to the dispersion quality and stability.<br>
0147]  A measurement of the absorbance at a higher wavelength gives an<br>
indication on the shape of the absorption spectrum. The dispersion quality can be evaluated based on the phenomenon of light scattering induced by solid particles in solutions. When measured in transmission, light scattering in pigment inks may be detected as an increased absorbance at higher wavelengths than the absorbance peak of the actual pigment. The dispersion stability can be evaluated by comparing the SSF before and after a heat treatment of e.g. a week at 800C.<br><br>
[0148]  The spectral separation factor SSF of the ink is calculated by using the data of the recorded spectrum of an ink solution or a jetted image on a substrate and comparing the maximum absorbance to the absorbance at a higher reference wavelength Aref .The spectral separation factor is calculated as the ratio of the maximum absorbance Amax over the absorbance Aref at a reference wavelength.<br><br>
[0149]  The SSF is an excellent tool to design inkjet ink sets with large colour<br>
gamut. Often inkjet ink sets are now commercialized, wherein the different inks are not sufficiently matched with each other. For example, the combined absorption of all inks does not give a complete absorption over the whole visible spectrum, e.g. "gaps" exist between the absorption spectra of the colorants. Another problem is that one Ink might be absorbing in the range of another ink. The resulting colour gamut of these inkjet ink sets is low or mediocre.<br>

[0156]  The dispersion stability was evaluated by comparing the SSF before and after a heat treatment of one week at SO^'C. Pigmented inkjet inks exhibiting good dispersion stability have a SSF after heat treatment still larger than 30.<br>
3.	Polymer analysis<br>
[0157]   Unless othen/vise specified all polymers have been characterized with gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) using the following methods. Random or block copolymers were analyzed with NMR by dissolving them in a deuterated<br><br>
solvent. For 'H-NMR ± 20 mg polymer was dissolved in 0.8 mL CDCI3 or DMS0-d6 or acetonltrile-d3 or D2O (with or without NaOD addition). Spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova 400 MHz instrument equipped with an ID-probe. For i^C-NMR ± 200 mg polymer was dissolved in 0.8 mL CDCis or DMS0-d6 or acetonitrile-d3 or D2O (with or without NaOD addition). Spectra were recorded on a Varian Gemini2000 300 MHz equipped with a SW-probe.<br>
[0158]  Mn, Mwand polydispersity (PD) values were determined using gel<br>
permeation chromatography. For polymers dissolvable in organic solvents PL-mixed B columns (Polymer Laboratories Ltd) were used with THF+5% acetic acid as mobile phase using polystyrene with known molecular weights as calibration standards. These polymers were dissolved in the mobile phase at a concentration of 1mg/mL. For polymers dissolvable in water PL Aquagel OH-60, OH-50, OH-40 and/or OH-30 (Polymer Laboratories Ltd) column combinations were used depending on the molecular weight region of the polymers under investigation. As mobile phase water/methanol mixtures adjusted to pH 9.2 with e.g. disodiumhydrogen phosphate were used with or without the addition of neutral salts e.g. sodium nitrate. As calibration standards polyacrylic acids with known molecular weights were used. The polymers were dissolved in either water or water made basic with ammonium hydroxide at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Refractive index detection was used.<br>
[0159]  An example is now given to illustrate the calculation of the average composition of a random (= statistical) copolymer P(MAA-c-EHA). The Mn of the copolymer was determined with GPC to be 5000. The molar percentage of each monomer type by NMR was determined to be: 45 mole% MAA and 55 mole% EHA. Calculation:<br>
(0.45 X MMAA) + (0.55 x MEHA) = 140.09<br>
5000 /140.09 = total number of monomeric units in average polymer chain = 36<br><br>
Average number of MAA units = 0.45 x (5000/140.09) = 16 units Average number of EHA units = 0.55 x (5000/140.09) = 20 units Thus, the average composition is P(MAAi6-c-EHA2o).<br>
4.	Particle size<br>
[0160]  The particle size of pigment particles in pigmented Inkjet ink was<br>
determined by photon correlation spectroscopy at a wavelength of 633 nm with a 4mW HeNe laser on a diluted sample of the pigmented Inkjet ink. The particle size analyzer used was a Malvern™ nano-S available from Goffin-Meyvis.<br>
[0161] The sample was prepared by addition of one drop of ink to a cuvet containing 1.5 mL water and mixed until a homogenous sample was obtained.

Then the same procedure is repeated on the filtrate. After the second filtration the ink is ready for evaluation.<br>
[0221]   Using the above method, the comparative inkjet ink COMP-6 and the inventive inkjet ink INV-12 were prepared according to Table 14.<br><br><br>
Results and evaluation<br>
[0222]  The spectral separation factor (SSF) was determined for each sample<br>
directly after preparation. The degree of modification with the chromophore MAG-1 could not be determined due to poor solubility. The results are listed in Table 15 together with the calculated values for the %MW.<br><br>
[0223]  From Table 15 it is clear that, although an homopolymer was used as the polymeric backbone for the dispersant, in the inventive pigmented inkjet ink INV-12 the pigment PR122 was dispersed exhibiting a high dispersion quality and stability. The SSF of the inventive magenta Inkjet ink INV-12 was larger than 30 and therefore can be used to compose inkjet ink sets with high colour gamut.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
