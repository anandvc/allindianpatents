TITLE OF THE INVENTION <br>
FILTER MATERIAL FOR LIQUIDS AND PROCESS OF USING THE SAME<br>
APPLICANT Dr Sachin A Mandavgane<br>
 <br>
FILTER MATERIAL FOR LIQUIDS AND PROCESS OF USING THE SAME<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of filter materials for filtering liquids and process for using the same, and, more particularly, to the field of filters containing activated carbon particles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Water may contain many different kinds of contaminants including particulates, harmful chemicals, and microbiological organisms, such as bacteria, parasites, protozoa and viruses. Water-borne diseases are the greatest threat to global health, with diarrhea, jaundice, typhoid, cholera, polio, and gastroenteritis spread by contaminated water. Around 37.7 million Indians are affected by waterborne diseases annually, 1.5 million children are estimated to die of diarrhea alone and 73 million working days are lost due to waterborne disease each year. The resulting economic burden is estimated at $600 million a year.<br>
Rural India has more than 700 million people residing in about 1.42 million habitations spread over 15 diverse ecological regions. Meeting the drinking water needs of such a large population can be a daunting task. The non-uniformity in level of awareness, socio-economic development, education, poverty, malpractices, rituals and water availability add to the complexity of the task. In such case, providing pure water to such a high population is almost impossible.<br>
Another water-borne health hazard is due to chemical contaminants such as chlorine, taste, odor, lead, arsenic, volatile organic compounds (VOC), trihalomethanes (THM), chromium, heavy metals, fluorides, arsenic, selenium, etc. It is estimated that about 70 million people in 20 states are at risk due to excess fluoride and around 10 million people are at risk due to excess arsenic in<br>
 <br>
ground water. Apart from this, increase in the concentration of chloride, Total Dissolve Solids, nitrate, iron in ground water is of great concern for a sustainable drinking water program.<br>
Treated water from the municipal supply may contain fewer amounts of bacteria but there is no provision for removal of metal contaminants from this water. About 85 % of rural population in India is solely depended on ground water, which is depleting at a fast rate. While 'traditional diseases' such as diarrhea continue to take a heavy toll, 66 million Indians are at risk due to excess fluoride and 10 million due to excess arsenic in groundwater. In all, 1, 95,813 habitations in the country are affected by poor water quality.<br>
Industrial development has also added to the unsafe quality of water, including ground water. Excessive release of toxic metals into the environment due to industrialization has created a great global concern. In many countries, there are deadly consequences associated with exposure to contaminated water, especially metal contaminants. Heavy metals such as cadmium, nickel, and zinc ions in aqueous solutions are toxic.<br>
Therefore the main objective of the present invention is to develop modern water purification technology especially useful to rural area, which is simple, easy to use and can be operated without much technical know-how. The price factor is also important as technologies with high operational and recurring costs might not be useful in country like India. There is also the objective of the present invention to develop a cost effective method for water purification, using easily available and cheaper materials.<br>
Rice husk is an agricultural waste, obtained from the rice mills. Rice husk is mostly used as a fuel in the boiler furnaces of various industries to produce steam. The Rice Husk Ash (RHA) is collected from the particulate collection equipment attached upstream to the stack of the rice husk-fired boilers.<br>
 <br>
Since RHA is available in plenty and it has very high potential as an adsorbent, the present invention deals with the mesoporous characteristics of carbon embedded RHA and its adsorption characteristics for Cd(li), Ni(ll) and Zn(ll) ions from aqueous solutions.<br>
Adsorption in Rice Husk Ash is due to the surface complex formation between the metal ions and the acidic surface function group of activated carbon. Removal efficiency is influenced by various factors such as solution concentration, solution pH, ionic strength, nature of adsorbate, adsorbent modification procedure, physical properties (surface area, porosity), and chemical nature of the activated carbon. Removal of heavy metal ions by adsorption using activated carbon can be increased by impregnation of activated carbon with suitable chemicals which is based on simple chemical reactions that are common in chemistry such as acid-base or neutralization, complex formation, precipitation, hydrolysis and catalytic reactions. For example, if activated carbon is impregnated by molecules, ions and chelating agents that can combine with transition metal ions to form precipitation, complex or chelates, they can improve adsorption of metal cations significantly. Precipitated amorphous silica obtained from RHA has very high surface area and pore diameter. The silica as such and with deposited activated carbon is a well known adsorbent.<br>
Extensive work has been done on use of RHA as an adsorbent. Various studies address RHA as an adsorbent for metal tons like copper, nickel, zinc, lead, arsenic, mercury, cadmium and gold from aqueous solution. RHA has good adsorptive properties to remove dyes like Brilliant Green (BG) dye and Indigo Carmine dye from aqueous medium.<br>

US patent 7,712,613 describes a filter and filter material for providing or treating potable water, using a filter material formed from a mixture of mesoporous and microporous activated carbon particles, coated with silver. US patent 7,413,663 describes a water treatment apparatus containing activated carbon and resins. US patent 7,413,653 describes a portable filtered drinking water system for removing undesirable tastes, odors, and contaminants from potable water.<br>

US patent 7,510,652 describes an apparatus for removing sulfur-containing compounds from liquid fuels.<br>
US patent 7,491,337 describes a method and apparatus for the purification of water, in particular to the removal of surfactants and optionally organic, inorganic and/or biological contaminants from water using adsorption filtration techniques. US patent 7,332,082 describes a system and method for biological purification of water, in particular from swimming facilities. US patent 6,475,386 describes a filter for purifying domestic drinking water using oxidized activated carbon along with other adsorbents. US patent 6,800,111 describes a method for recovering catalytic metals where resins are used for metal removal.<br>
US patent 6,375,735 discloses amorphous precipitated silica, silica gels, and amorphous carbons derived from biomass and methods of producing them with and without adhered or deposited amorphous carbons, produced by acidifying a caustic silicate solution for using in polishing silicon wafers in the manufacture of computer chips and other electronic devices.<br>
Thus there is a need to develop a modern water purification technology especially useful to rural area, which is cost effective, simple, easy to use, can be<br>
 <br>
operated without much technical know-how, has least operational and recurring costs and is made using easily available and cheaper materials.<br>
