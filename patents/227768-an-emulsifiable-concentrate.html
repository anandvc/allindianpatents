				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Emulsifiable concentrate (EC) formulations conventionally contain<br>
an active ingredient, one or more surfactants which act as emulsifiers<br>
upon dilution with water and a water immiscible solvent. Typical solvents<br>
for conventional EC formulations are aromatic hydrocarbons as for<br>
example xylene, Shellsol A or Solvesso 200. These solvents have very<br>
low solubilities in water and a high capability of dissolving a wide range of<br>
active ingredients.<br>
Due to the presence of the solvent, many pesticides formulated as<br>
EC formulations have advantages such a higher degree of systemicity and<br>
overall activity compared to the same pesticide formulated as a wettable<br>
powder (WP), water dispersible granule (WG) or suspension concentrate<br>
(SC). However, the solvents used in the conventional EC formulations can<br>
damage the environment or may cause toxicity problems.<br>
The International Patent Application WO 96/01047 discloses ECs<br>
containing pyrethroids, esters of plant oils, a water-immiscible cosolvent<br>
and emulsifying surfactants. However, there is no disclosure of EC<br>
formulations containing water-miscible cosolvents.<br>
Example 3 of the International Patent Application WO 98/00008<br>
discloses an EC consisting of a fungicide, three different kinds of non-ionic<br>
strfactants, a cosolvent and an ester of a plant oil. However, this example<br>
cannot enable the skilled worker to produce such a formulation since its<br>
components do not add up to 100 percent.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a novel emulsifiable concentrate<br>
(EC) formulation containing at least one pesticidal active ingredient,<br>
a solvent which essentially consists of one or more esters of plant oils,<br>
a cosolvent selected from the class of water-miscible, polar aprotic<br>
solvents, and an emulsifying surfactant system forming an oil in water<br>
emulsion when the formulation is added to water, which comprises one or<br>
more anionic surfactants and one or more non-ionic surfactants.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an emulsifiable concentrate<br>
containing :<br>
- 10 to 500 g/1 of at least one fungicide<br>
wherein said fungicide is a fused pyrimidine of the formula I:<br><br>
in which<br>
R1 and R2 each independently represent hydrogen or an optionally<br>
substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkadienyl, haloalkyl, aryl,<br>
heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, bicycloalkyl or heterocyclyl group, or<br>
R1 and R2 together with the adjacent nitrogen atom represent an<br>
optionally substituted heterocyclic ring,<br>
R3 represents a halogen atom or an alkyl or alkoxy group,<br>
n represents an integer from 0 to 5, and<br>
Hal represents a halogen atom<br>
- 200 to 800 g/1 of the solvent which consists of one or more methylesters<br>
of plant oils,<br><br>
-	10 to 400 g/1 of the cosolvent selected from the group consisting of N-<br>
methylpyrrolidone, -butyrolactone, cyclohexanone and benzylalcohol<br>
-	50 to 300 g/1 of the emulsifying surfactant system, which consists<br>
essentially of<br>
-10 to 150 g/1 of one or more anionic surfactants and<br>
- 10 to 150 g/1 of one or two non-ionic surfactants.<br>
The new EC shows an excellent selective pesticidal activity in various<br>
crops.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide novel, pesticidal<br>
ECs.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to provide methods for<br>
controlling fungus by contacting plants with a pesticidally effective amount<br>
of the new EC.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide selective pesticidal<br>
compositions obtainable by emulsifying the new ECs in water.<br>
These and other objects and features of the invention will be more<br>
apparent from the detailed description set forth hereinbelow, and from the<br>
appended claims.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
It has surprisingly been found that improved stable EC formulations<br>
of pesticidal active ingredients can be produced using<br>
•	a solvent which essentially consists of one or more esters of plant oils,<br>
•	a cosolvent selected from the class of water-miscible polar aprotic<br>
solvents, and<br>
•	an emulsifying surfactant system capable of forming an oil in water<br>
emulsion when the formulation is added to water, which comprises one<br>
or more anionic surfactants and one or more non-ionic surfactants.<br>
The use of the water-miscible polar aprotic solvent, in particular<br>
Duiyroiacione, is essential 10 incorporate sunicient amounts OT tne<br>
pesticidal active ingredient in the EC.<br>
In the definitions of the new EC formulations, a pesticide is a<br>
synthetic or natural compound which has the capability of inhibiting the<br>
growth of phytopathogenic fungi or of controlling a plant disease or has<br>
the capability to control undesired weeds or insects on crops.<br>
The new ECs contain at least one pesticide, preferably one, two or<br>
three pesticides, in particular fungicides or herbicides.<br>
The fungicidal compounds can be, for example, those which are<br>
capable of combating ear diseases of cereals (e.g. wheat) such as<br>
Septoria, Gibberella and Helminthosporium spp., seed and soil borne<br>
diseases, downy and powdery mildews on vines, and powdery mildew and<br>
scab on apples, etc. Mixtures of fungicidal compounds can have a broader<br>
spectrum of activity than a single compound alone. Furthermore, the<br>
mixtures of fungicides can exhibit a synergistic effect compared with the<br>
single active ingredients.<br>

Esters of plant oils, which are used as nonpolar, water immiscible<br>
solvents according to the present invention, are as a rule alkyl esters<br>
obtainable from medium chained fatty acids by esterification with alkanols<br>
or by transesterification of the corresponding plant oils preferably in the<br>
presence of a lipase. Preferred fatty acids of these plant oils have 5 to 20,<br>
in particular 6 to 15 carbon atoms. As a rule they are mixtures of fatty<br>
acids having different chain lengths, mixtures in which the main<br>
component, i.e. more than 50 percent of said mixture, has 8 or 10 carbon<br>
atoms are particularly preferred. In a preferred embodiment the methyl<br>
ester of the plant oil used is the methyl ester of caprylic / capric ester or of<br>
capric ester having less than 5 percent of fatty acids having chain lengths<br>
different from 8 or 10.<br>
Particularly preferred methyl esters of plant oils are Witconol® 1095<br>
and Witconol® 2309 which are commercially available from the Witco<br>
Corporation, Houston, Texas, USA.<br><br>
The water-miscible polar aprotic solvents used as cosolvents are<br>
necessary to increase the amount of the active ingredient. Without these<br>
cosolvents relatively small amounts of the active ingredient are soluble in<br>
the EC and the resulting formulation may show phytotoxicity due to the<br>
increased amount of solvent applied to the plant. Preferred polar solvents<br>
are compounds which exhibit a dielectric constant of 2.5 or more at 25 °C,<br>
in particular from 2.7 to 4.0 at 25 °C. Preferred are alcohols such as<br>
benzyl alcohol, ketones, alkylene carbonates such as ethylene carbonate<br>
and propylene carbonate, amides, in particular cyclic amides and lactones<br>
as for example N-methylpyrrolidone, y-butyrolactone, N-cyclohexyl-<br>
pyrrolidone, and cyclohexanone. Most preferred is y-butyrolactone.<br>
The emulsifying surfactant system forming an oil in water emulsion<br>
when the formulation is added to water is as a rule a mixture of two or<br>
more surfactants. Suitable surface-active substances may be nonionic,<br>
anionic or cationic surfactants with good dispersing, emulsifying and<br>
wetting properties depending on the nature of the pesticidal compound to<br>
be formulated. Surfactants may also mean mixtures of surfactants.<br>
Suitable surfactants may be so-called water-soluble soaps as well as<br>
synthetic surface-active compounds. Soaps usually are alkali, earth alkali<br>
or optionally substituted ammonium salts of higher fatty acids (C10-C20)-<br>
e.g. the sodium or potassium salts of oleic or stearic acid or of mixtures of<br>
natural fatty acids which are prepared, for example, from coconut or tallow<br>
oil. Furthermore, methyl-taurine salts of fatty acids may be used.<br>
However, so-called synthetic surfactants are preferably used, especially<br>
fatty sulfonates, fatty sulfates, sulfonated benzimidazole derivatives or<br>
alkyl aryl sulfonates. The fatty sulfates or fatty sulfonates are normally<br>
used as alkali, earth alkali or optionally substituted ammonium salts and<br>
have an alkyl moiety of 8 to 22 carbon atoms, whereby alkyl also means<br>
the alkyl moiety of acyl residues, such as the sodium or calcium salt of<br>
lignin sulfonic acid, of sulfuric acid dodecylate or of a mixture of fatty<br>
alcohols prepared from natural fatty acids. This also includes the salts of<br>
sulfuric acid esters, sulfonic acids and adducts of fatty alcohols and<br><br>
ethylene oxide. The sulfonated benzimidazole derivatives preferably<br>
contain 2 sulfonic acid residues and a fatty acid residue with 8 to 22<br>
carbon atoms. Alkyl aryl sulfonates are, for example, the sodium, calcium<br>
or triethyl ammonium salts of dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid, dibutyl<br>
naphthalene sulfonic acid or of a condensate of naphthalene sulfonic acid<br>
and formaldehyde. Furthermore, phosphates, such as the salts of the<br>
phosphoric acid ester of a p-nonylphenol-(4-14)-ethylene oxide adduct or<br>
phospholipids, may be used. Most preferred anionic surfactants are the<br>
sodium, calcium or triethyl ammonium salts of dodecyl benzene sulfonic<br>
acid, in particular Sponto® AD11-1A (a mixture of dodecyl benzene<br>
sulfonate, an alkyl ethoxylate and isobutanol) of Witco SA, Saint-Pierre les<br>
Elbeuf, France Rhodocal® 70/B (70 % linear dodecyl benzene sulfonate in<br>
n-butanol) of Rhodia GmbH (former Rhone-Poulenc), Phenylsulfonat CA<br>
100 (40 % branched calcium linear dodecyl benzene sulfonate in Solvesso<br>
200) of Clariant GmbH (former Hoechst AG) or Nansa® EVM 70/2E (57 %<br>
linear dodecyl benzene sulfonate in 2-ethylhexanol) of Albright &amp; Wilson.<br>
Non-ionic surfactants are preferably polyglycolether derivatives of<br>
aliphatic or cycloaliphatic alcohols, saturated or non-saturated fatty acids<br>
and alkylphenols, which have 3 to 10 glycol ether groups and 8 to 20<br>
carbon atoms in the (aliphatic) hydrocarbon residue and 6 to 18 carbon<br>
atoms in the alkyl residue of the alkyl phenols. Other suitable non-ionic<br>
surfactants are the water-soluble, 20 to 250 ethylene glycol ether groups<br>
containing polyadducts of ethylene oxide and polypropylene glycol,<br>
ethylene diamino polypropylene glycol and alkyl polypropylene glycol with<br>
1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety, the substances normally contain<br>
1 to 5 ethylene glycol units per propylene glycol unit. Examples of non-<br>
ionic surfactants are nonylphenol polyethoxy ethanols, castor oil polyglycol<br>
ethers, polyadducts of ethylene oxide and polypropylene, tributyl phenoxy<br>
polyethoxy ethanol, octyl phenoxy polyethoxy ethanol. Preferred are fatty<br>
acid esters of polyoxy ethylene sorbitan, such as polyoxy ethylene<br>

The solubility of the active ingredients in the formulation according to<br>
the invention depends not only on the structure of the active ingredient but<br>
also on the amount of the cosolvent. The relative amount of active<br>
ingredient increases by about 40 to 60 % when 10 to 15 % cosolvent is<br>
incorporated into the formulation.<br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to a method of combating pests at<br>
a locus which comprises treating the locus with a composition obtained<br>
from emulsifying an EC according to the invention in water.<br>
Moreover, the invention relates to the use of an EC according to the<br>
invention as a pesticide.<br>
As commodities, the inventive pesticidal ECs may preferably be in a<br>
concentrated form whereas the end-user generally employs diluted<br><br>
compositions. Said compositions may be diluted to concentrations down to<br>
0.001% of active ingredient (a.i.). The doses usually are in the range of<br>
about 0 01 to 10kga.i./ha.<br>
The said compositions may also comprise other auxiliaries such as<br>
stabilizers, defoamers, viscosity controlling agents, thickeners, adhesives,<br>
fertilizers or other active pesticide ingredients to obtain special effects.<br>
For a clearer understanding of the invention, specific examples are<br>
set forth below. These examples are merely illustrations and are not to be<br>
understood as limiting the scope and underlying principles of the invention<br>
in any way. Indeed, various modifications of the invention in addition to<br>
those shown and described herein will become apparent to those skilled in<br>
the art from the following examples and foregoing description. Such<br>
modifications are also intended to fall within the scope of the appended<br>
claims.<br>
The recipes of the formulations of the following examples represent<br>
the maximum amount of active ingredient that can be dissolved in the<br>
formulation with and without cosolvent (at +10 °C).<br>
Example 1<br>
An EC formulation is prepared containing:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Greenhouse tests have shown that the EC formulations as above<br>
based on methyl caprylate as solvent are as active as EC's containing<br>
Solvesso 200, a conventional, commercially available solvent for EC<br>
formulations.<br>
In addition, the efficacy of the inventive EC formulations is typically<br>
higher than that of conventional WP's or SC's in both residual and<br>
curative tests. Phytotoxicity has been negligible at typical application<br>
rates.<br>
Moreover, the inventive EC formulations are more environmentally<br>
friendly and have improved toxicity profiles which renders the handling of<br>
these formulation safer.<br><br>
