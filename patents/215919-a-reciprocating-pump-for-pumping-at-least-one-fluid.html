				<td>The invention relates to a reciprocating pump for pumping at least one fluid.<br>
The invention generally relates to mechanical pumps and more particularly to a pump that can be used to pump a fluid that may be a liquid, a gas, or a combination of both, and is particularly useful for pumping cryogenic fluids.<br>
Cryogenic fluids, such as liquified hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, argon or liquified air, and liquified hydrocarbons, such as liquified methane, butane, propane or natural gas, are typically stored and transported in pressurized containers. The containers are typically well-insulated and refrigerated to very low temperatures. Pumps are used to transfer such fluids between containers or from one container to a point of use. While many types of pumps have been designed for these uses, mechanical pumps of the reciprocating type have been preferred for many applications.<br>
Reciprocating pumps generally are required to have a net positive suction head (NPSH), i.e., a suction head above zero, to prevent the loss of prime of the pump and/or to prevent or reduce any tendency to cavitation within the pump. NPSH is the required additional pressure above the saturation vapor pressure of a liquid at any given temperature. Cavitation is the formation of vapor-filled cavities within the liquid caused in areas of the pump where the pressure of the moving liquid drops below the saturation vapor pressure. During compression the collapsing cavities may cause shock, vibration, noise, and erosion of metal surfaces, all of which can damage the pump.<br>
The cryogenic pump disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,188,519 (Splugis) includes a cylinder having a liquid inlet and a liquid outlet, and a piston reciprocally movable within the cylinder and generally intermediate the liquid inlet and the liquid outlet. The piston has a liquid flow conduit therethrough generally co-axial with the cylinder, the liquid flow conduit having an inlet end in liquid communication with the cylinder<br><br>
liquid inlet and an outlet end in liquid communication with the cylinder liquid outlet. A piston rod is attached to the piston for reciprocally moving the piston within the cylinder in a direction toward the cylinder liquid outlet. A valve operatively associated with and intermediate the piston rod and the piston liquid flow conduit inlet end alternately opens and closes the inlet to liquid flow, the valve being closed when the piston rod and piston are moved in the direction toward the cylinder liquid outlet and being open when the piston rod and piston are moved in the reciprocal direction.<br>
The reciprocating cryogenic pump disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,239,460 (Golz) is designed to operate with a very low NPSH. This pump uses a reciprocating piston which divides a cylindrical housing into a low pressure chamber and a smaller high pressure chamber. A gas inlet port extends through the side of the housing for channeling liquified gas into the low pressure chamber. A fixed piston extends from an outlet end of the housing into the high pressure chamber. The fixed piston slides within a cylindrical skirt carried by the reciprocating piston. Pressurized liquified gas is supplied to an outlet through a passageway within the fixed piston. One-way valves control the flow of liquified gas though the inlet, the several chambers and the outlet. During operation, the inlet fluid is compressed in the low pressure chamber in an effort to condense any gas that may come into the pump so that the resulting liquid can be forced into the high pressure chamber. If there is insufficient gas to be compressed, holes in the low pressure chamber allow excess liquid to return to a storage tank so that this chamber remains at relatively low pressure.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,447,195 (Schuck) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,559,786 (Schuck) disclose a two-stage pump, which essentially is made of two separate pumps connected by piping, having two chambers. Pumped fluid must pass through both chambers, having no intermediate way of returning to a storage tank. If the pumping results in unacceptably high pressure between the two stages of this two-stage pump, the excess pressure is vented by a relief valve.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,639,197 (Tomare, et al.) discloses a pump for cryogenic fluids that has two pistons connected by a common rod. The first piston is slightly larger in<br><br>
diameter than the second piston such that the second compression chamber is slightly small in volume than the first compression chamber. If there is excess liquid in the first stage of this two-stage pump, the excess liquid passes back to suction around the unsealed perimeter of the first stage piston.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,575,626 (Brown, et al.) discloses a two-stage cryogenic pump similar to the pump disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,239,460 (Golz). The major difference is that this pump has an added feature, the capability to draw liquid from the bottom of a container, rather than being mounted extemal to a container.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,884,488 (Graham, et al.) discloses a single-stage pump intended to pump liquid only (not a two-stage pump designed for pumping two-phase fluids). Although this pump has two chambers, the second chamber within the pump is not intended to be a compression chamber. The volume of the second chamber is very large, such that the compression ratio is extremely slight. One embodiment of the pump has a first chamber and a second chamber communicating with the first chamber, a third chamber communicating with the second chamber, and a reciprocating piston separating the first, second, and third chambers from one another, and for drawing and compressing gas and liquid in any one of the chambers.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,511,955 (Brown, et al.) discloses a cryogenic pump which includes a reciprocating piston positioned in a first cylindrical housing for dividing the interior of the housing into a supercharger chamber and an evacuation chamber on opposite sides of the piston. At least one supercharger chamber inlet port extends through the cylindrical housing directly behind the reciprocating piston for channeling liquified gas from a liquified gas inlet into the supercharger chamber. A fixed piston is mounted in the housing and extends into the evacuation chamber. The fixed piston engages a skirt carried by the moveable piston to form a high pressure chamber between the movable and fixed pistons. A liquified gas outlet extends through the fixed piston from the high pressure chamber to the ultimate outlet.<br>
There are various problems with the prior art pumps used to pump cryogenic liquids. For example, the prior art two-stage pumps do not necessarily allow all of the<br><br>
fluid pumped by the first stage to carry on through the pump to the discharge, the extra fluid having to be returned to a tank. Also, some of the prior art pumps require either oversized motors to allow for extra power required during the compression stroke or large flywheels to store energy during the suction stroke.<br>
It is desired to have a two-stage pump which operates as a single-stage pump when proper fluid conditions exist at the inlet, such that all of the fluid pumped passes through to the discharge.<br>
It is further desired to have a two-stage pump within a single housing whereby the size and cost of the pump are relatively less than the size and cost of prior art pumps.<br>
It is still further desired to have a two-stage pump that does not require a flj/wheel or oversized motor to store energy, but rather stores energy as pressure inside the pump during the suction stroke.<br>
It also is desired to have an improved reciprocating pump for pumping cryogenic fluids which overcomes the difficulties and disadvantages of the prior art to provide better and more advantageous results.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a reciprocating pump for pumping at least one fluid, comprising: a housing; a piston slideably mounted within the housing for a reciprocating movement substantially parallel with the longitudinal axis of the housing and dividing the housing into a first chamber adjacent a housing inlet and a second chamber adjacent a housing discharge, the volumes of said chambers varying inversely with the reciprocating movement of the piston in a suction stroke increasing the volume of the first chamber and a compression stroke increasing the volume of the second chamber; a shaft having a forward end connected to the rear end of the piston for reciprocating movement concurrently with the piston, at least part of the shaft being disposed in the second chamber; inlet valve to control fluid flow through the inlet to the first chamber; discharge valve to control fluid flow from the second chamber through the discharge; and interstage valve means in fluid communication with the first chamber and the second chamber to control fluid flow<br><br>
from the first chamber to the second chamber, characterized in that the interstage valve means is closed during a suction stroke and is open during a compression stroke.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
FIG. 1 is a partial cross-sectional view of the present invention; and<br>
FIG. 2 is a schematic representation illustrating the pump of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is a two-stage pump that is particularly useful for pumping cryogenic fluids. However, the pump also may be used with other types of fluids that may be liquids, gases, or combinations of liquid and gas. The pump is capable of pumping two-phase fluids as well as single phase fluids. It has many uses, including but not limited to use in the system and method discussed in a patent application being filed concurrently with this application and which is entitled "Pumping System and<br><br>
Method   for   Pumping   Fluids"   (Air   Products   and   Chemicals,   Inc."s   Ser.   No. 09/825,784), which patent application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a specific arrangement of one embodiment of the pump. FIG. 2 shows a simplified version of the pump to aid in understanding the operation of the pump.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the reciprocating pump 10 includes a housing 12, a reciprocating piston 14 within the housing, a shaft 16 connected to the reciprocating piston, an inlet valve 18, a discharge valve 20, and an interstage valve 22. Fluid enters the inlet 24 of the pump at a lower pressure and leaves the discharge 40 of the pump at a higher pressure. Sealing means between the inner walls 26 of the housing and the outer surface of the piston is provided by piston rings 28 mounted on the piston. Sealing means between the inner walls of the housing and the outer surface of the shaft includes high pressure shaft seals 30 and low pressure shaft seals 32. An outlet 34 in the housing adjacent the shaft 16 provides a means for vapor return to a storage tank (not shown) for the cryogenic fluid. In the preferred embodiment, the housing is cylindrical. However, persons skilled in the art will recognize that the housing may have other shapes.<br>
The inlet valve 18, similar to a one-way check valve, allows fluid into the first-stage compression chamber 36 (or first stage or first chamber) as the piston 14 moves back to the left in FIGS. 1 and 2. At the same time, fluid is expelled from the second-stage compression chamber 38 (or second stage or second chamber) through the discharge valve 20, which also is similar to a one-way check valve. The interstage valve 22 is closed during the suction stroke. As the piston begins the compression stroke, moving to the right in FIGS. 1 and 2, the inlet valve closes, and the interstage valve opens. Fluid then passes through the center of the piston into the second stage of the pump. Depending on the compressibility of the fluid and system pressures, the fluid also may be expelled from the discharge valve. Since the volume of the second stage is less than the volume of the first stage, an incompressible fluid will pass through the pump and out the discharge 40. If the fluid is compressible, the fluid will be compressed to a higher density dependant on system pressures and fluid conditions.<br><br>
In the preferred embodiment, spring-loaded valves are used for the inlet valve 18, interstage valve 22, and discharge valve 20, as shown in FIG. 2. (See for example, spring 42 of inlet valve 18 in FIG. 1.) However, persons skilled in the art will recognize that other types of valves may be used, such as valves having other types of biasing means and/or operating means.<br>
The structure and operation of the piston rings 28 are discussed in greater detail in a patent application being filed concurrently with this application and which is entitled "Directional, Low-Leakage Seal Assembly" (Air Products and Chemicals, Inc."s docket number 06116USA), which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Heat is developed by the piston rings 28 due to friction. The amount of heat generated is significant, and can affect performance of the pump 10 if this heat enters the fluid prior to being pumped. Heat is generated when the piston rings are forced against the inner walls 26 when there is a high differential pressure across the piston rings, and the frictional loads are high. For this two-stage pump, that time is when the piston 14 is on the suction stroke, i.e., the piston is moving to the left in FIGS. 1 and 2, and fluid is being drawn in through the inlet 24. At the same time, some fluid leaks past the piston rings and into the first-stage compression chamber 36, picking up heat from the inner walls and the piston rings in the process. When a cryogenic fluid is being pumped, this heat will cause some of the fluid being drawn into the compression chamber to boil. To minimize the effect of this heating cycle, the piston rings have been designed to be cooled by the discharge fluid during the compression stroke.<br>
During the compression stroke, i.e., the piston 14 is moving to the right in FIGS. 1 and 2, and fluid is being discharged through the discharge 40 via the discharge valve 20, the pressure differential in the pump 10 is such that fluid flows from the higher pressure first-stage compression chamber 36 to the slightly lower pressure discharge. There is a slight pressure drop across the discharge valve as fluid flows through the discharge valve and out the discharge. This pressure drop, and the slight friction of the piston rings 28 against the inner walls 26 also allows this<br><br>
discharge fluid to pass around the piston rings and along the inner walls 26, thus cooling the inner walls of the housing.<br>
The piston rings 28 are designed to seal in one direction only, which allows a significant amount of the cold discharge fluid to pass around the piston rings and across the inner walls 26 of the housing 12, removing heat generated on the suction stroke when the piston rings are forced against the inner walls by the large pressure differential. Because the fluid being pumped is liquid, there is little temperature rise during compression. The liquid being pumped is cold, and this cold fluid then passes around the piston rings during the discharge stroke, cooling the piston rings and inner walls and preventing the inner walls and piston rings from increasing temperature.<br>
Since the pump 10 uses energy stored as pressure, there is no need for a flywheel. In the preferred embodiment, the cross-sectional area of the piston 14 is exactly twice that of the shaft 16. For the case where the maximum amount of power is required by the pump, which is the case where an incompressible fluid is being pumped, the pressure on the back side of the piston is always nearly equal to the discharge pressure. The pressure on the back side of the piston is not some lower interstage pressure when an incompressible fluid is being pumped. On the suction stroke, the amount of force is 1/2 the area of the piston times the difference in pressure across the piston. For the compression stroke, the amount of force is again 1/2 the area of the piston times the discharge pressure. For each case, the amount of load is roughly equal, resulting in the amount of energy required during each stroke to be roughly equal. The maximum amount of energy required by the pump for any given inlet pressure and discharge pressure is dictated by an incompressible fluid.<br>
In operation, the following actions occur during the forward travel or stroke of the reciprocating piston 14 (i.e., toward the inlet 24):<br>
1) The inlet valve 18 closes due to spring force on the inlet valve plus differential pressure across the inlet valve tending to close the inlet valve. The differential pressure is created as the volume in the first-stage compression chamber 36 decreases, increasing first stage pressure.<br><br>
2)	The fluid in the first-stage compression chamber 36 rises in pressure as the piston 14 moves toward the right. If gas exists, the increase in pressure will condense the gas into a liquid or a supercritical fluid (i.e., the fluid pressure increase is approximated by an isentropic process).<br>
3)	The fluid in the second-stage compression chamber 38 decreases in pressure as the piston 14 moves toward the right. Depending on the thermodynamic state of the fluid, some of the fluid may change state into a gas and expand as a gas (i.e., the fluid pressure decrease is approximated by an isentropic process).<br>
4)	When the pressure in the first-stage compression chamber 36 has increased above the pressure in the second-stage compression chamber 38, the interstage valve 22 will be forced open against its spring load. At the same time, the piston rings 28 will be forced off their respective seats by their spring load. Flow of fluid will occur though the interstage valve and also around each of the piston rings. The flow of fluid around the piston rings helps to remove heat generated by friction of the piston rings against the inner walls 26.<br>
5)	If and when the pressure in the second-stage compression chamber 38 has increased above the pressure on the outlet of the pump 10, the discharge valve 20 will be forced open against its spring load. Note that the total volume of the first and second stages decreases during the forward travel of the piston 14. This decrease in volume is equal to the cross sectional area of the shaft 16 times the length of stroke.<br>
Given a perfectly incompressible fluid, step 3 above will not occur, and a volume of fluid equal to the total reduction in volume of the first and second stages (36 and 38) will be discharged through the discharge valve 20 during the forward travel or stroke of the piston 14.<br>
In operation, the following actions occur during the rearward travel or stroke of the reciprocating piston 14 (i.e., away from the inlet 24):<br>
1) The inlet valve 18 opens due to differential pressure across the inlet valve, compressing the valve spring 42. At the same time, the interstage valve 22 closes due<br><br>
to spring force on the interstage valve plus differential pressure across the interstage valve tending to close the interstage valve. The differential pressure is created as the volume in the first-stage compression chamber 36 increases, decreasing first stage pressure. During this rearward stroke, fluid is drawn into this first-stage compression chamber through the intake valve 18.<br>
2) When the pressure in the second-stage compression chamber 38 has increased above the pressure on the outlet of the pump 10, the discharge valve 20 will be forced open against its spring load and fluid will be forced out of the pump.<br>
The above description of the invention has focused on the preferred embodiment. However, persons skilled in the art will recognize that other embodiments and variations of the invention are possible. For example, although in the preferred embodiment, the shaft 16 has a cross-sectional area substantially equal to about 1/2 the cross-sectional area of the piston 14, that ratio of those cross-sectional areas may be varied.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the piston 14 is movable relative to the housing 12 and the housing has a fixed position. However, persons skilled in the art will recognize that the pump 12 may be designed so that the piston has a fixed position and the housing is movable relative to the piston.<br>
Variations in the interstage valve means 22 also provide for alternate embodiments. In the preferred embodiment, the interstage valve means is a valve mounted on the piston 14, and the valve controls fluid flowing from the first-stage compression chamber 36 to the second-stage compression chamber 38. In an alternate embodiment, the interstage valve means is not mounted on the piston. In this case, there is an inlet port (not shown) in the inner wall 26 of the housing 12 adjacent the first-stage compression chamber, and a discharge port (not shown) in the inner wall of the housing adjacent the second-stage compression chamber. Transfer means (not shown), such as a conduit, transfers the fluid from the inlet port to the discharge port.<br><br>
The inlet port is in fluid communication with the first-stage compression chamber and the discharge port is in communication with the second-stage compression chamber.<br>
The pump 10 uses a two-stage approach to compressing a single phase or a two phase cryogenic fluid. The way the pump handles this two stage design is unique. The pump uses a single housing 12 with a single piston 14 to create the two-stage aflect. By combining the two stages into one housing, the overall design is much more simplified and cost effective than prior art pumps. It also reduces the amount of energy required during each half of the stroke, regardless of the condition of the fluid being pumped. This reduction in energy reduces the need for a flywheel or an oversized motor.<br>
The two-stage design allows all of the fluid to pass through both stages when a pure liquid is being pumped. None of the fluid is returned to the tank or vented. Energy is stored during what is conventionally known as a suction stroke for use during a compression stroke.<br>
Although illustrated and described herein with reference to certain specific embodiments, the present invention is nevertheless not intended to be limited to the details shown. Rather, various modifications may be made in the details within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims and without departing from the spirit of the invention.<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1.	A reciprocating pump (10) for pumping at least one fluid, comprising:<br>
a housing (12);<br>
a piston (14) slideably mounted within the housing (12) for a reciprocating movement substantially parallel with the longitudinal axis of the housing (12) and dividing the housing (12) into a first chamber (36) adjacent a housing inlet (24) and a second chamber (38) adjacent a housing discharge (40), the volumes of said chambers (36, 38) varying inversely with the reciprocating movement of the piston (14) in a suction stroke increasing the volume of the first chamber and a compression stroke increasing the volume of the second chamber;<br>
a shaft (16) having a forward end connected to the rear end of the piston (14) for reciprocating movement concurrently with the piston (14), at least part of the shaft (16) being disposed in the second chamber (38);<br>
inlet valve (18) to control fluid flow through the inlet to the first chamber (36);<br>
discharge valve (20) to control fluid flow from the second chamber (38) through the discharge (40); and<br>
interstage valve means (22) in fluid communication with the first chamber (36) and the second chamber (38) to control fluid flow from the first chamber (36) to the second chamber (38), characterized in that the interstage valve means (22) is closed during a suction stroke and is open during a compression stroke.<br>
2.	The reciprocating pump as claimed in claim 1, wherein each of said inlet,<br>
discharge and interstage valve comprise a respective valve biased to its closed<br>
position.<br>
3.	The reciprocating pump as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the part of the shaft<br>
(16) disposed in the second chamber (38) has a cross sectional area equal to about one<br>
half the cross sectional area of the piston (14).<br>
4.	The reciprocating pump as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,<br><br>
comprising sealing means (28) to provide at least one seal between the housing (12) and the piston (14) in an alternating manner during the reciprocating movement.<br>
5.	The reciprocating pump as claimed in claim 4, wherein the seal is provided during the<br>
suction stroke.<br>
6.	The reciprocating pump as claimed in claim 4 or 5, wherein the sealing means<br>
comprises at least one piston ring (28) mounted peripherally on the piston (14).<br>
7.	The reciprocating pump as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein at least part of the interstage valve means (22) is mounted on the piston (14).<br>
8.	The reciprocating pump as claimed in any one of claim 1 to 6, wherein the interstage valve means (22) comprises an inlet port in the housing (12) adjacent the first chamber (36), a discharge port in the housing (12) adjacent the second chamber (38), and transfer means adapted to transfer at least part of the fluid from the inlet port to the discharge port, the inlet port being in fluid communication with the first chamber (36) and the discharge port being in fluid communication with the second chamber (38).<br>
9.	The reciprocating pump as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the<br>
housing (12) has a fixed position.<br>
10.	The reciprocating pump as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein the piston (14)<br>
has a fixed position.<br>
11.	A reciprocating pump for pumping at least one fluid, substantially as hereinabove<br>
described and illustrated with reference to the accompanying drawings.</td>
