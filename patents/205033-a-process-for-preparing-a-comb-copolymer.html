[See Section 10]<br><br><br>
             "A PROCESS FOR PREPARING A COMB COPOLYMER"<br>
HERCULES INCORPORATED, a Corporation of the State of Delaware., 1313 North Market Street, Hercules Plaza, Wilmington, Delaware  19894-0001, United States of America<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a comb copolymer.<br>
The present invention relates to hydrophobically modified polymers and more particularly it relates to hydrophobically modified water soluble comb copolymers suitable for thickening water-borne systems.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
Water soluble polymers (also commonly referred to as "thickeners" or "rheology modifiers") are widely used in many industrial water-borne systems as additives to modify their flow behavior. One such highly filled aqueous system is the latex paint, which is composed of a dispersion of a polymeric latex, pigment and clays and other additives in water.<br>
Typically, a small amount (0.1-5 wt%) of water soluble polymer is added to latex paints to achieve the following performance characteristics during manufacturing, storage, and applications:<br>
a)	Ease of formulation and ability to manufacture at a fast rate,<br>
b)	Prevention of settling of the suspended particles (latex, pigment, etc.) during storage,<br>
c)	Good film build during applications to achieve efficient hiding without excessive brush or roller drag,<br>
d)	Good roller spatter resistance,<br>
c)       No excessive sagging after application on a vertical surface, and<br>
e)	Good flow and leveling for the formation of a smooth and continuous<br>
film with good appearance.<br>
Various water soluble polymers currently being used in latex paints are: i) natural polysaccharides, ii) chemically modified polysaccharides, and iii) synthetic<br><br>
 polymers. Examples of polysaccharide based thickeners include xanthan gum, locust bean gum, and cellulosics such as hydroxyethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylrhethylcellulose and ethylhydroxyethylcellulose. Synthetic thickeners are polyacrylates, polyalkylene oxides and polyacrylamides which could be 5     homopolymers or copolymers. Their hydrolytic stability and performance properties are, however, pH dependent.<br>
The above mentioned natural and synthetic thickeners provide different degrees of thickening efficiency and application properties.   However, they 10     invariably fail to provide key performance properties in gloss paints. These include good film build, flow and leveling, and gloss which are generally offered by solvent based alkyd paints. Another drawback of these thickeners is that they have poor compatibility with the various paint ingredients.<br>
15	To eliminate some of the performance deficiencies of conventional thickeners,<br>
a new class of thickeners, commonly referred to as "associative thickeners", has recently been designed and commercialized (See E. J. Schaller and P. R. Sperry, in "Handbook of Coatings Additives", Ed. L. J. Calbo, Vol. 2, p. 105,1992; Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York). These thickeners are hydrophobically modified water<br>
20    soluble polymers. They undergo intermolecular association in aqueous solution and thereby exhibit enhanced solution viscosity. They can also adsorb onto the dispersed phase particles of an aqueous dispersion and thereby form a three dimensional network. Since they provide improved paint properties not offered by conventional thickeners, they have gained commercial importance.<br>
25<br>
Polysaccharide based associative thickeners are made by chemically grafting a small amount of a hydrophobic group (C10-C24 alkyl) onto the polysaccharide backbone and they are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,228,277; 4,243,802 and EP 281,360.<br>
30<br>
Among commercial nonionic synthetic associative thickeners, hydrophobically modified ethylene oxide urethane (HEUR) block copolymers constitute an important class. They are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4.079,028,4,155,892. and 5,281,654.<br><br>
  These are low molecular weight polyurethanes made by condensing relatively low ' molecular weight polyethylene glycol (molecular weight - 10,000) with hydrophobic diisocyanates and end-capping with hydrophobic alcohols or amines. They are characterized by having three or more hydrophobes - two of which are terminal and 5     the remainder are internal. The hydrophobic groups are connected to the hydrophilic polyethylene oxide blocks through urethane linkages.<br>
The preparation of water dispersible HEURs is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,499,233 and 5,023,309. These HEURs are claimed to provide superior 10     viscosifying properties and improved leveling in aqueous systems.<br>
Processes for the production of HEURs with pendant hydrophobes in bunches are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,426,485 and 4,496,708. These HEURs are believed to provide enhanced thickening to aqueous systems through micelle-like 15     association.<br>
HEURs with branched structure and terminal hydrophobes are disclosed in U. S. Pat. No. 4,327,008. They are made by reacting polyalkylene oxides with a polyfunctional material, a diisocyanate and water and end-capping the resulting 20    product with a hydrophobic monofunctional active hydrogen-containing compound or a monoisocyanate.<br>
Silicon-containing HEURs having particular utility in paints and coatings are disclosed in European Patent Application No. 0498,442 A1. These are reaction 25     products of isocyanate functional material, a polyether polyol, a monofunctional active hydrogen containing hydrophobic compound, a silane-functional material, and water.<br>
One of the drawbacks of HEUR thickeners is that they are hydrolytically 30     unstable under strongly acidic or alkaline conditions, particularly at elevated temperatures. Hence, they cannot be processed or used in such situations.<br><br>
From applications and economic point of view, the major drawbacks of HEUR tnickeners are their high cost, difficulty in handling, and tendency to destabilize the paint (separation of dispersed particles from the aqueous phase) (G. D. Shay and A. F. Rich, J. of Coatings Technology. Vol. 58, No. 7, p.43, 1986).<br>
Random copolymers of ethylene oxide and long chain alkyl epoxides are disclosed in U. S. Pat. No. 4,304,902. These copolymers provide enhanced aqueous viscosity, but do not provide good flow and leveling in latex paints.<br>
U. S. Pat. No. 4,411,819 describes the preparation of polyethers which have branched chain structure and are characterized by having terminal hydrophobes. They are made by reacting a low molecular weight polyol with a mixture of ethylene oxide and at least one lower alkylene oxide having 3-4 carbon atoms. The polyethers are then end-capped with a mixture of C12-C18 alpha-olefin oxides.<br>
Low molecular weight (-9,000) hydrophobically end-capped polyether is disclosed in PCT Int. Appl. WO 92 08753. These are made by coupling low molecular weight (-4,500) surfactant with m-dichloromethylbenzene. Preparation of low molecular weight (- 9,000) hydrophobe end-capped polyethers is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,045,23. These are made by reacting C8-C22 aliphatic alcohols with a mixture of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide and subsequently coupling the alkoxylated alcohols with a diepoxide to form a polyether (MW - 9,000). Since these hydrophobically end-capped polyethers are of low molecular weight, they do not efficiently viscosity aqueous systems including latex paints.<br>
USP 5,574,127 discloses associative thickeners which are water soluble polymer compositions that have a backbone of poly(acetal- or ketal-polyether) with ends that are capped with hydrophobic groups. They are prepared by copolymerizing an alpha, omega-diol, -dithiol or -diamino polyether with a gem-dihalide compound in the presence of a base to form an alpha, omega-diol, -dithiol or -diamino poly(acetal- or ketal-polyether) which in turn is reacted with hydrophobic reagents to form the final product. These associative thickeners are used in film forming coating compositions, such as latex paints.<br><br>
An alternative strategy to achieve better Theological properties for various water-borne systems is to rely on the properties of associative thickeners with a comb architecture. Comb type polyurethane thickeners are described in U. S. Pat. 5     No. 5,496,908. These polymers have moderate viscosities in aqueous solution and are useful as thickeners for alkyd- or latex-based paints. Also reported are synthesis and viscoelastic properties of comb type polyurethane thickeners (Xu, B. et al, Langmuir, 1997,13, 6896; Xu, B. et al, Langmuir, 1997,13, 6903).<br>
LO	It is known in the art that currently there is no single thickener that provides all<br>
the desired performance characteristics required in water-borne coatings. Hence, very often, attempts are made to use blends of two or more different thickeners to achieve the targeted coating rheology. While this approach works in a limited way, blending of thickeners is often cumbersome and depending on mutual interactions<br>
15     between the individual thickener, the stability and performance of the coatings could be in jeopardy.<br>
Despite the continued activity in the art, there has not been produced a hydrophobically modified synthetic water soluble polymer which is hydrolytically &gt;o    stable over a wide pH range and at elevated temperatures and useful for viscosifying aqueous compositions in a cost-effective manner.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a comb copolymer is    comprising a backbone comprising (a) hydrophilic units, (b) at least one<br>
residue of a dihalogeno compound after the removal of halogen atoms and (c) at least one moiety containing pendant hydrophobe. In addition, the chain ends of such comb copolymers may bear hydrophobes.<br>
30	Further provided according to the present invention is a process for preparing<br>
a comb copolymer comprising a backbone comprising (a) hydrophilic units, (b) at least one residue of a dihalogeno compound after the removal of halogen atoms and (c) at least one moiety containing pendant hydrophobe comprising:<br><br>
(1)	copolymerizing water soluble polymer bearing alpha, omega-active hydrogen,<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A comb copolymer comprising a backbone comprising: (a) hydrophilic units, (b) at least one residue of a dihalogeno compound after the removal of halogen atoms, and (c) at least one moiety containing pendant hydrophobe have been found 15    to efficiently thicken various water-borne systems including latex paints and provide the best combination of paint properties (flow and leveling, film build, spatter resistance, and sag resistance) in an efficient manner. The dihalogeno compound providing residue (b) may or may not contain pendant hydrophobes. Depending on their chemical composition, the comb copolymer can be nonionic, cationic or anionic.<br>
20<br>
"Flow and leveling" as used in this invention refers to the degree to which a coating flows out after application so as to obliterate any surface irregularities such as, brush marks, an "orange peel" appearance, peaks or craters, which are produced 25     by the mechanical process of applying a coating.<br>
"Film build" means the formation of a continuous film to uniformly cover the surface of the substrate that is being coated.<br>
30	"Spatter resistance" means the ability of the coating formulation to resist the<br>
formation of flying tiny droplets during application of the coating.<br><br><br>
"Stability" means the ability to maintain the viscosity upon aging and to prevent phase separation.<br>
"Sag resistance", as used herein, refers to the downward movement 5     resistance of the coating on a vertical surface between the time of application and setting. Sagging leads to uneven coating having a thick bottom edge. The resulting sag is usually restricted to a local area of a vertical surface and may have the characteristics of a draped curtain. Sagging is aesthetically undesirable. In addition, coatings with good sag resistance will not easily drip off a paint brush or paint roller 10     and will not easily drip off a horizontal surface such as for example, a ceiling after it is applied.<br>
The water soluble hydrophilic polymers from which the hydrophilic units can be derived are selected from the group consisting of polyalkylene oxide, copolymer 15    of polyalkylene oxide, poly(acrylic acid), poly(acrylic acid-co-methacrylic acid), poly(acrylamide), poly(dialkyldiallylammonium salts), polyamidopolyamine, poly(ethyleneimine), poly(methyl vinyl ether-co-maleic anhydride), polyvinylpyrrolidone, poly(2-ethyloxazoline) and polypeptides.<br>

30	The residue of dihalogeno species can be any hydrocarbyl radical, preferably<br>
hydrocarbyl radical having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms.<br><br>
he residues of dihalogeno species can be derived from dihalogeno compounds and their derivatives.

Most preferably the dihalogeno compounds are dibromo- and dichloro- methane and their<br>
derivatives, a.a'-dichloro- and dibromoxylene and their derivatives and gem-dichloro<br>
10     and dibromoogranosilanes and organophosphorous compounds and their derivatives.<br>
The residue of dihalogeno compound can be an alkylene radical, such as methylene, ethylene, etc. radical, a xylenylene radical, or an organometallic radical, 15     such as organosilyl radical and/or organophosphoryl radical.<br>
In the context of the present application, the term "derivatives" as it refers to dihalogeno compounds and their derivatives means that such compounds are substituted with alkyl, aryl, and/or aralkyl groups.<br>
20<br>
The moiety containing pendant hydrophobes groups is derived from hydrophobic compounds having alpha, omega-active hydrogen atoms and their alkoxylated derivatives, preferably from alkylene oxide modified fatty amines, and ethoxylated organosilicon or organophosphorous compounds having hydrophobes 25     attached thereto and from fullerene compounds (carbon cage compounds containing 60-90 carbon atoms) and most preferably from ethoxylated fatty amine.

    groups, preferably it is alkyl group. Generally the hydrophobe has at least one carbon atom, preferably at least six carbon atoms. Generally the hydrophobe has up to ninety carbon atoms, preferably up to twenty-two carbon atoms.<br>
Generally, the hydrophobes in the hydrophobic compounds have a molecular weight of at least about 15, preferably at least about 115. Generally, the hydrophobes have a molecular weight of up to about 1,100 preferably up to about 250.<br>

15<br>
In addition to the pendant hydrophobes, the comb copolymers of the present invention may optionally have hydrophobes at the chain ends of the comb copolymers as well.<br>
20	The comb type hydrophobically modified copolymers of the present invention<br>
are made by copolymerizing:<br>
(1)     water soluble (hydrophilic) polymer bearing alpha, omega-active<br>
hydrogen atoms such as polyalkylene oxide, copolymer of polyalkylene<br>
oxide, poly(acrylic acid), poly(acrylic acid-co-methacrylic acid),<br>

10<br>
In the context of the present application the term "hydrophobic compounds having alpha, omega- active hydrogen atoms" means hydrophobic compounds bearing more than one active hydrogen and the term "their alkoxylated derivatives" means such compounds modified with alkylene oxide.<br>
15<br>
The comb type copolymer thus formed in turn can be reacted with a hydrophobic compound capable of reacting with active hydrogen atoms to form a hydrophobically end capped comb copolymer. The hydrophobe can be hydrocarbyl, alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, arylalkyl, arylalkenyl, cycloaliphatic, perfluoroalkyl, carbosilyl, 20    fullerenyl, polycyclic and complex dendritic groups, preferably it is alkyl group.<br>
The process can be carried out in any solvent or solvent mixtures devoid of active hydrogens and stable to bases. However, preferred solvents are oxygenated solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran and alkyl ethers of alkylene glycols or hydrocarbon 25     solvents. For running the process in a solvent, the base can be any strong base, preferably the base is sodium hydride.<br>
In addition, the process can also be carried out in the absence of a solvent. In this case, the preferred base is an alkali metal hydroxide and the most preferred is 30     sodium hydroxide.<br><br><br>
The reaction scheme to form the comb copolymers of the present invention can be illustrated by the following:<br>
5 10 <br>
I	= Comb copolymer with pendant hydrophobes<br>
II	= Comb copolymer with pendant and terminal hydrophobes<br>
15<br>
where H-A-H = a hydrophilic polymer bearing alpha, omega-active hydrogen atoms,<br>
H-B(Ri)-H = a compound comprising a chemical entity "B", which can be an atom or<br>
io	a group of atoms, having a valence of at least three and having<br>
attached to "B" alpha, omega-active hydrogen atoms and a pendant hydrophobe group "Ri" or a mixture thereof;<br>
Ri	= hydrocarbyl, alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, arylalkyl, arylalkenyl, cycloaliphatic,<br>
is	perfluoroalkyl, carbosilyl, fullerenyl, polycyclic and complex dendritic<br>
groups;<br>
X-D(R'i)-X    = a dihalogeno compound wherein D is a hydrocarbon moiety,<br>
preferably having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, or organometallic<br>
30	radical, such as organosilyl radical or organophosphoryl radical or a<br>
mixture thereof;<br>
R'i	= H or a hydrophobe radical or organometallic radical;<br>
35     X	= halogen, such as Br, CI, etc.;<br><br>
*2-Y	= hydrophobic compound capable of reacting with terminal active<br>
hydrogens of comb copolymer (I) through its functional group Y;<br>
     R2	= hydrocarbyl, alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, arylalkyl, arylalkenyl, cycloaliphatic,<br>
perfluoroalkyl, carbosilyl, fullerenyl, polycyclic and complex dendritic groups;<br>
m, n and p represent the number of units of -A-, -B(R1)- and -D(R'i)- in comb<br>
10	copolymer (I) and comb copolymer (II), preferably    m = 1-50;     n =<br>
1-20;      p = 1-10.<br>
Note that if X-D(R'i)-X is a geminal dihalogeno compound, then A and B blocks in<br>
comb copolymer (I) and comb copolymer (II) are connected through<br>
is	acetal or ketal linkages which are stable in alkaline environments.<br>
The active hydrogens in H-A-H and H-B(Ri)-H can be part of functional groups such as -OH, -SH and -NH2.<br>
20	As far as the type of hydrophobes are concerned, the pendant and terminal<br>
hydrophobes could be the same or different. Similarly, the terminal hydrophobes could be the same or different.<br>
As one skilled in the art would appreciate, a wide variety of comb type 25     hydrophobically modified polyacetal- or polyketal-polyethers could be made by appropriately selecting various reaction conditions and manipulating the stoichiometry and structure of the reactants H-A-H, H-B (Ri)-H, X-D(R'i)-X and R2-Y.<br>
The preferred procedure of making comb copolymers of the present invention 30     comprises suspending or dissolving H-A-H and H-B (Ri)-H in an inert solvent and copolymerizing them with X-D(R'i)-X in the presence of a suitable base or catalyst at elevated temperatures. The end-capped hydrophobically modified comb copolymer can be made in turn by reacting this comb copolymer with a hydrophobic<br><br>
reagent. Suitable solvents include toluene, xylene, aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents, tetrahydrofuran, dialkyl ethers of alkylene glycol, diethoxymethane and the like. Suitable bases-include finely divided sodium hydride, alkali metal hydroxides, and alkali metal carbonates. Organic bases also could be used. It is critical that the 5     reaction solvent and reactants used in the process should be anhydrous or substantially free of moisture.<br>
The scope of this invention as claimed is not intended to be limited by the following examples, which are given merely by way of illustration. All parts are by 10    weight unless otherwise indicated.<br>
The hydrophobically modified comb copolymers of the present invention are suitable for use as rheology modifiers in paints, paper coatings, personal care products, textiles, adhesives, inks, oil well drillings, etc.<br>
15<br>
Procedure for determining the weight average molecular weight of hydrophobically modified comb copolymers<br>
The weight average molecular weight of various hydrophobically modified 20    comb copolymers was measured by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The SEC measurements were performed in a 0.20M lithium acetate buffer (pH 4.8) plus 1.0% randomly substituted methylated beta-cyclodextrin plus 0.1% N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) mobile phase with both the columns and the refractive index detector thermostated at 40°C. The polymers were chromatographed through a set 25     of four SHODEX PROTEIN® Columns (KW804 + KW804 + KW803 + KW803) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. A sample concentration of 0.15% was used with an injection volume of 200 microliter. The molecular weight distribution data are based on polethylene oxide/polyethylene glycol standards with narrow molecular weight distributions and are not absolute.<br><br><br>
