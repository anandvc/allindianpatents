COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10; rule 13)<br>
Title of the invention<br>
COMPOSITION COMPRISING POLYMER AND LIQUID OR SOFT SOLID DERIVATIVE OF CYCLIC POLYOL OR REDUCE SACCHARIDE<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai-400 020, State of Maharashtra, India<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
FABRIC   CARE. COMPOSITION<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to the use of certain polymers to enhance the feeling of comfort when a garment is worn and to the use of the same polymers to increase the rate of 	moisture transport through a fabric. The invention also relates to fabric care compositions comprising the polymers : and to methods of treating fabric with the compositions.<br>
Background and Prior Art<br><br>
 It is clearly desirable for garments to feel as comfortable<br>
as possible when they are worn. The feeling of comfort,<br>
 which the wearer of a garment experiences, is a function of<br>
 a whole host of different properties of the garment.  For<br>
example, the softness of the garment, which can be increased<br>
by applying fabric softening and/or conditioning compounds<br>
to the fabric during the rinse cycle of a domestic<br>
laundering process, is one property that is important to the<br>
overall feeling of comfort.<br>
Another measurable property of fabric, which is associated with comfort when a garment comprising the fabric is worn, is the rate of diffusion of water vapour through the fabric. It is normally desirable for water vapour, which evaporates from the skin to be able to diffuse through a garment as quickly as possible.  High races cf diffusion through the fabric prevent the garrr.ent from feeling hot, vet and/or sticky.  Similarly, it is desirable fcr a fabric to be able<br><br>
to absorb liquid moisture in order thac the moisture can be transported away from the skin of the wearer of the fabric. If moisture is allowed co remain in contact: with the skin, the fabric can again feel wet and, therefore, uncomfortable.<br>
A number of documents, such as US 4807303, refer to improving the comfort of fabrics, although most of them rely  on pre-treatments, which waiter the physical and/or chemical construction of the fibres, which make up the fabric.<br>
It is known that fluoropolymers can be applied to fabric and technology of this type is disclosed in WO 93/25279, US 5043209 and US 4805240.  Treatment with fluoropolymers increases the hydrophobicity of the fabric, thus decreasing the tendency for it to feel wet, whilst still permitting water vapour to diffuse through the fabric.<br>
Physical treatments of fabric can allow water vapour to pass through the fabric at an increased rate.  For example, WO 92/17335 describes making pores in an impermeable laminate.<br>
WO 95/33007 refers to adding particles of cress-linked polyacrylic acid salts to laminates to increase their ability to transmit water vapour.<br>
The application to synthetic fabric of a combination of ester-acid or ester salt and amidic acid or amidic salt is disclosed in WO 93/07328.  The polymers which are used in this treatment are non-cross-linked and they do not have the capability of self-cross-linking cr of reacting with<br><br>
cellulose.  The treatment is claimed to improve wetting/wicking characteristics of the fabric.<br>
US 4910069 mentions the treatment of fabric forming trouser pockets with a polyurethane, acrylic or silicone resin.  The resins, when cured, are said to open up the fabric pores to allow transmission of water vapour.<br>
The present invention aims to provide a system for enhancing the comfort of fabrics which does not require a physical or chemical treatment of the fabrics of the types described above.<br>
It is a further aim of the present invention to provide a system for increasing the rate of diffusion of water vapour through fabrics.<br>
The present invention also aims to provide a system for treating fabric to enhance comfort and/or increase the rate of moisture transport through the fabric which can be applied to fabric as part of a laundering process.<br>
Definition of the invention<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided the use of a polymer which is capable of self-cross-linking and/or of reacting with cellulose in the treatment of fabric comprising cellulosic fibres to enhance the feeling of comfort when a garment comprising the fabric is worn.<br><br>
Also provided by the invention is the use of a polymer which is capable of self -cross -linking and/or of reacting with cellulose in the treatment of fabric comprising cellulosic<br>
 fibres to increase the rate of moisture transport through<br>
 the fabric.<br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to a fabric care composition comprising a polymer which is capable of self- cross-linking and/or of reacting with cellulose and a liquid  or soft solid derivative of a cyclic polyoi (CPE) or of a reduced saccharide (RS2) resulting from 35 to 100% of the hydroxyl groups in the polyoi or saccharide bering esterified or etherified.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is a method of treating a<br>
 fabric, which comprises applying to the fabric a composition of the invention aS part of a laundering process.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The., present ..invention, uses polymers which, are. capable, of self-cross-linking and/or of reacting with cellulose, to treat fabric, in order to enhance the feeling of comfort when a garment comprising the fabric is worn and/or to increase the rate of moisture transport through the fabric. It will be appreciated rhat increasing the rate of moisture transport through the fabric is one of the changes in the properties of the fabric which contribute -o enhancing the feeling of-comfort when a garment comprising the fabric is worn.<br><br>
It was unexpected that polymers which are capable of self-cross- linking and/or of reacting with cellulose could increase the rate of moisture transport through a fabric. . Even more surprising was the fact that the fabric can be treated with the polymer as part of a laundering process.<br>
It will be appreciated that the term "moisture transport", as used herein, refers to the transport of water in the<br>
	 gaseous and/or liquid state (ie, water vapour and/or liquid<br>
	   water).<br>
	 Polymers which may be used in the invention include any<br><br>
	 oolymer which is capable of self-cross-linking and/or of<br><br>
	 reacting with cellulose.  Suitable polymers include non-	 ionic, amphoteric, cationic and anionic polymers.<br>
Polymers which are suitable for use in the present invention 	 are preferably capable of increasing the wet strength of 	 paper by at least 200% compared to untreated paper when<br>
applied to paper having a weight of 30 g/ma at a level of 1%<br>
solids by weight based on weight of paper, according to the<br>
test method described hereinafter.<br>
Anionic polymers which are suitable for use in the present invention include carbamoyl sulphonate terminated poly(ether)urethane resins, bunte salt terminated polymers and mixtures thereof.  Examples of these types of polymers include those having the formula (Z) ■.<br><br>

[CH-0 [CH2CH3) -0]n-Y-S03-M+]m<br><br>
CH2-0[GH2CH(CH3)-0]n-Y-S03'M+<br>
(I)<br>
wherein:<br>
y	is	a divalent radical selected from -CH2-CH(OH) -CH2-S- and<br>
		-C0-NH-(CH2)p-NH-C0-;<br>
	m	is	an integer frem 0 to 4 ;<br>
	n	is	an integer frctn 5 to 20;<br>
	M	is	an alkali metal; and<br>
	p	is	an integer from 2 to 12.<br>
i<br>
Preferably, m is ecjual to 1.<br>
Conveniently, Y is -CO-NH- (CH2)P-NH-C0-<br>
and, preferably, p is from 4 to 8, such as about S.<br>
It is also preferred that n is 10 to 15, such as about 13, for example.<br>
M is advantageously sodium or potassium, mora preferably sodiun.<br>
Polymers in which Y is -CO-NH-(CH2)p-NH-C0- are commercially available ur.der -he Trade Mark SYNTKAPPR2T 3A? (Bayer) . Polymers in which Y is -CH2-CH (OH)-CH2-S- are available ur.der the Trade Mark NOPCCLAN SHR3 (Henkel .<br><br>
Cationic polymers, which are suitable for use in the present invention, include amine- or amide- epichlorohydrin resins or derivatives -thereof.  In. the context of the present invention, these resins are polymeric, or at least oligomeric, in nature.  Preferably, they have a weight average mean molecular weight of from 300 to 1,000,000 daltons.  The resins of the invention are sometimes referred to below as amine-epichlorohydrin resins and polyamine-epichlorohydrin (PAE) resins (the two terms being used synonymously) although these terms encompass both the amine and amide resins of the invention. The resins may also have a mixture of amine and amide groups.<br>
The amine or amide-epichlorohydrin resins may have one or more functional groups capable of forming azetidinium groups and/or one or more azetidinium functional groups.<br><br>
Alternatively, or additionally, the resins may have one or more functional groups that contain epoxide groups or derivatives thereof e.g. Kymene 450™ (ex Hercules).<br>
Suitable polyarr.ine-epichlorohydrin (PAS) resins include those described in 'Wez Strengih Resins and Their Application', pp 15-36, ed. L.L.Chan, Tappi Press,  Atlanta, 1954.  Suitable PAE resins can be identified by selecting<br><br>
those resins which impart increased wet strength to paper, after treatment, in a relatively simple test.  Suitable PAE resins include Xenores 1440 (ex Akzo Nobel) .<br>
Any amine or amide-epichlorohydrin resin having an epoxide functional group or derivative thereof is suitable for use according to the invention.<br>
A particularly preferred class of amine or amide-epichlorohydrir. resins for use in the invention are secondary amine or amide-based azetidinium resins, for example, those resins derived from a polyalkylene polyanine e.g. diethylenetriamine (DETA) , a polycarboxylic acid e.g. adipic acid or other dicarboxylic acids, and epichlorohydrin. Other polyamines or polyamides can also be advantageously used in the preparation of suitable PAE resins.<br>
Another preferred class of amine-epichlorohydrin resins for use in the invention are those having an epoxide functional group or derivative thereof, e.g.. chlorohydrin.<br>
The resins may be PDAA-epichlorohydrin resins or PMDAA-epichlorohydrin resins. PDAA is poly(diallylamine) and P.MEAA is poly (methyidiailyl (amine) ) .<br>
Other cationic polymers which can be used in the present invention include the polymers or prepolymers derived from pclyoxyalkylene=~ines that are described in US 5571285, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Methods for preparing the poiyners are described in US<br><br>
5571286.  Hence the polymers can be, for example, the reaction product of a diamine or triamine polyoxyalkylene prepolymer having a polymerisation degree of from 4 to 50 or a. mixture thereof with epichlorohydrin in a ratio of epichlorohydrin to amino nitrogen of from 1:1 to 3:1.  The amino groups in these polymers may be wholly or partly in the form of derivatives of amino groups.  Derivatives include, for example, adducts formed by alkylation or hydroxyalkylation at the nitrogen atom or by the formation of an amide group at the nitrogen atom.  The derivatives may be formed by the reaction of the amino groups with a bifunctional bridging agent or with a cross-linking agent. Preferably, the polymers are obtainable by the reaction of a prepolymer of formula B(R)n/ wherein n is from 1 to 20, B is a backbone group to which each R is covalently bonded and R is a group comprising a poly(oxyalkylene) chain, which chain comprises an amino end group, the polymer being optionally reacted with a bridging compound, with a cross-linking agent.  It will thus be appreciated that the polymer may be a relatively .complex mixture comprising a number of different compounds, some or all of, which may be cross-linked.<br>
The poly(oxyalkylene) chain which forms a part of the R group may be, for example a poly(oxyethylene) or poly(oxyprop-l,2-yier.e) chair..  The length of the chain can vary from 2 to 100 repeat units.<br>
Conveniently, n is 2 cr 3 .  I" will be appreciated that r. may-no t be = whole number where the polymer is formed from a mixture of different polymers of formula 3(R)r_.<br><br>
In some of the polymers which may be used in the invention,<br>
B is<br>
-0-CH2   (CH) m-CH2-0-   (ie,   3 is the residue of glycerol)<br>
I<br>
0<br>
I and m is  equal  to n-2.<br>
However, B can also represent other values such as, for example, the residue of other triols or the residue of a di-, tetra-, penta- or hexa- hydroxy compound.  Alternatively, B can represent the residue of a di-, tri- or poly- amine.<br>
j Preferably, at least oris R group has the formula -(CH2CH(R')0) p-A-NHR1', wherein R1 is H or CH3 , p is an integer from 5 to 30, A is an alkylene group and R1' is H or alkyl.  More preferably, p is from 10 to 25.<br>
The term 'alkyl", as used herein, includes Ci to Cs  alkyl, optionally substituted on the alkyl chain, which may be branched, or. unbrajiched. and, for C* to. C« .alkyl,, ..may. be cyclic.  The term "alkylene" is defined, similarly but refers to a divalent radical.<br>
It will be appreciated that the term "end group" refers to the group at or near to the end of the poly(oxyalkylene) chain, which end, when the prepolymer is of formula B(R)n, is at the other end of the prepolymer chair, from the end which is attached to 3.<br><br>
Suitable prepolyraers of formula B(R)3 include those having the following structure:<br>
H2C-0 (CKaCH (R ') 0) P-A-^H2<br>
I HC-0 (CKaCH (R') 0) q-A-NH2<br>
I H;C-0 (CH2CH (R ' ) 0) r-A-NH2<br>
wherein R' is as defined hereinbefore, p, q and r are integers which may be the same or different and may be from 5 to 3 0 and A is branched or unbranched lower alkylene.<br>
The cross-linking agent which is used to form the polymer by reaction with the prepolymer, or the prepolymer after prior reaction with the bridging compound, preferably comprises an epihalohydrin.  Epichlorohydrin is a suitable epihalohydrin.<br>
Preferably the molar ratio of cross-linking agent to prepolymer of formula B (R) n is from 0.5:1 to 4:1.  Other amounts of cross-linking agent may be used to form the polymers.<br>
Suitable, bridging, compounds comprise two, epoxide..cr carboxylic acid groups.  The epoxide or carboxylic acid groups may be linked by a linker comprising alkylene, aryiene, poly(cxyalkylene) or siloxane groups or combinations thereof.  Examples of bridging compounds therefore include benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid, hexane-1,5-dicarboxylic acid and poly(oxyethylene) compounds terminated at both ends of the molecule by an epoxide group. Other suitable bridging compounds are disclosed in US 5571236.<br><br>
Polymers which are suitable for use in the present invention are available from Precision Processes Textiles (Ambergate, Derbyshire, UK) under the trade marks POLYMER AM and POLYMER MRSM.  The polymers are preferably in the form of aqueous solutions.<br>
The treatment of fabric with a polymer according to the invention is preferably carried out as part of a laundering process.  When the treatment is carried out as part of a laundering process, the polymer may be used in the form of a composition comprising the polymer and one or more textile compatible carriers. The composition may be a fabric care composition of the invention, which comprises a CPE or RSE, as described herein, or a composition which comprises one or more other textile compatible carriers.<br>
The nature of the textile compatible carrier will be dictated to a large extent by the stage at which the composition is used in a laundering process, the compositions being capable of being used, in principle, at any stage of the process.  For example, where the compositions are for use as main wash detergent compositions, the one or more textile compatible carriers comprise a detergent active compound. Where the compositions are for use in the rinsing step (or cycle) of a laundering process, which is preferred, the one or more textile compatible carriers may comprise a fabric softening ar.d/cr conditioning compound.<br>
The compositions of the invention preferably comprise a perfume, such as of the type v/hich is conventionally used ir.<br><br>
fabric care compositions.  The compositions may be packaged and labelled for use in a domestic laundering process.<br>
The polymer is preferably present used in a sufficient quantity to give an amount of 0.0005% to 5% by weight on the fabric based on the weight of the fabric (owf) , more preferably 0.001% to 2% by weight on fabric.  The amount of the polymer in the composition required to achieve the above % by weight on fabric will typically be in the range 0.01% to 35% by weight, preferably 0.1 to 13.5% by weight.<br>
The polymers of the invention, when applied to a fabric, can impart benefits to the fabric when uncured.  However, they may be cured by a domestic curing step including ironing and/or domestic tumble drying, preferably tumble-drying. The curing is preferably carried out at a temperature in the range of from 50 to 100°C, more preferably from SO to 100°C.<br>
In the context of the present invention the term "textile compatible carrier" is a component which can assist in the interaction of the first component with the fabric. The<br>
carrier can also provide benefits in addition to those provided by the first compcner.t e.g. softening, cleaning etc.  The carrier nay be water, in'which case the cc-positicn of the invention may contain another additive, such as perfume, for example, cr the carrier may be a detergent-active compound cr a fabric softener cr conditioning compound or other suitable detergent or fabric treatment agenr.<br><br>
If the polymer is to be used according to the invention in a laundry process as part of a conventional fabric treatment product, such as a detergent composition, the textile-compatible carrier will typically be a detergent-active compound.  Whereas, if the fabric treatment product is a rinse conditioner, the textile-compatible carrier will be a fabric softening and/or conditioning compound.<br>
If the invention is to be carried out before, or after, the laundry process the polymer may be contained in a composition which is in the form of a spray or foaming product.<br>
The fabrics, which may be treated in the present invention, include those which comprise cellulosic fibres, preferably from 1% to 100% cellulosic fibres (more preferably 5% to 100% cellulosic fibres, most preferably 40% tc 100%).  The fabric may be in the form of a garment, in which case the method of the invention may represent a method of laundering a garment. When the fabric contains less than 100% cellulosic. fibres,, the balance. comprises other fibres or blends of fibres suitable for use in garments such as polyester, for example.  Preferably, the cellulosic fibres are of cotton or regenerated cellulose such as viscose.<br>
The laundering processes of the present invention include the large scale and small scale (eg domestic) cleaning of fabrics.  Preferably, the processes are dcmesiic.<br>
In the invention, the polymer or the composition of the invention may be used at any stage of the laur.dering<br><br>
process.  Preferably, the composition or the polymer is used to treat the fabric in the rinse cycle of a laundering process.  The rinse cycle preferably follows the treatment<br>
of the fabric with a detergent composition.<br>
i<br>
Detergent Active Compounds<br>
If the present invention is carried out using the polymer in the form of a detergent composition, the textile-compatible carrier may be chosen from soap and non-soap anionic, cationic, nonionic, amphoteric and zwitterionic detergent active compounds, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Many suitable detergent active compounds are available and are fully described in the literature, for example, in "Surface-Active Agents and Detergents", Volumes I and II, by Schwartz, Perry and Berch.<br>
The preferred textile-compatible carriers that can be used are soaps and synthetic non-soap anionic and nonionic compounds.<br>
Anionic surfactants are well-known to those skilled in the art.  Examples include alkylbenzene sulphonates, particularly linear alkylbenzene sulphonates having an alkyl chair, length cf Ce-C15; primary and secondary alkylsulphates, particularly C8-Ci5 primary alkyl sulphates; alkyl ether sulphates; olefin sulphonates; alkyl xylene sulphonates; dialkyl sulphosuccir.a-es; and fatty acid ester sulphonates. Sodium aalt3 are generally preferred.<br><br>
Nonionic surfactants that may be used include the primary and secondary alcohol ethoxylates, especially the C8-C2 aliphatic alcohols ethcxylated with an average of from 1 to 20 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol, and mere especially the C10-C15 primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols ethoxylated with an average of from l to 10 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol. Non-ethoxylated nonionic surfactants include alkylpolyglycosides, glycerol monoethers, and polyhydroxyamides (glucamide) .<br>
Cationic surfactants that may be used include quaternary ammonium salts of the general formula R1R2R3R4N+ X" wherein the R groups are independently hydrocarbyl chains of C2-G22 length, typically alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or ethoxylated alkyl groups, and X is a solubilising cation (for example, compounds in which R1 is a Ca-C22 alkyl group, preferably a Ca-C1o or C12-C14 alkyl group, R2 is a methyl group, and R3 and R4, which may be the same or different, are methyl or hydroxyethyl groups) ; and cationic esters (for example, choline esters) and pyridinium salts.<br>
The total quantity of detergent surfactant in the composition is suitably from 0.1 to SO wt% e.g. 0.5-53 wt%, such as 5-50wt%.<br>
Preferably, the quantity of anionic surfactant (when present) is in the range cf from 1 to 50% by weight cf the total composition.  Mere preferably, the quantity cf anionic surfactant is in  the range cf from 3 to 3 5% by weigh-. e.g. 5 to 30% by weight.<br><br>
Preferably, the quantity of ncnionic surfactant when present is in the range of from 2 to 25% by weight, more preferably from 5 to 2 0% by weight.<br>
Amphoteric surfactants may also be used, for example amine oxides or betaines.<br>
The detergent compositions may suitably contain from 10 to 70%, preferably from 15 to 70% by weight, of detergency builder.  Preferably, the quantity of builder is in the range of from 15 to 50% by weight.<br>

where M is a monovalent cation, preferably sodium.  These materials contain seme bound water and are required to have a calcium ion exchange capacity of at least 50 mg CaO/g. The preferred sodium aluminosilicates contain 1.5-3.5 SiC2 units in the formula above.  They can be prepared readily by-reaction between sodium silicate and sodium aiurrunate, as amply described in: the  literature.<br><br>
Fabric Softening and/or Conditioner Compounds<br>
If the polymer is used in the present invention in the form of a fabric conditioner composition, the textile-compatible carrier will be a fabric softening and/or conditioning compound {hereinafter referred to as "fabric softening compound"), which may be a cationic or nonionic compound.<br>
The softening and/or conditioning compounds may be water insoluble quaternary ammonium compounds.  The compounds may be present in amounts of u? to 8% by weight (based on the total amount of the composition) in which case the compositions are considered dilute, or at levels from 3% to about 50% by weight, in which case the compositions are considered concentrates.<br>
Compositions suitable for delivery during the rir.se cycle may also be delivered to the fabric in the tumble dryer if used in a suitable form.  Thus, another product form is a composition (for example, a paste) suitable for coating onto, and delivery from, a substrate e.g. a flexible sheet or- sponge or a . suitable' dispenses during •a tumble dryer-cycle .<br>
Suitable cationic fabric softening compounds are substantially water-insoluble quaternary ammonium materials comprising a single alkyl cr alkenyl long chain having an average chain length greater than or equal to C23 or, more preferably, compounds comprising a polar head group ar.d two alkyl or alkenyl chains having an average chain length greater than or equal to C16.  Preferably the fabric<br><br>
softening compounds have two long chain alkyl or aikenyl chains each having an average chain length greater than or equal to C16.  Most preferably at least 50% of the long chain alkyl or alkenyl groups have a chain length of C18 or above. It is preferred if the long chain alkyl or aikenyl groups of the fabric softening compound are predominantly linear.<br>
Quaternary ammonium compounds having two long-chain aliphatic groups, for example, distearyldimethyl ammonium chloride and di(hardened tallow alkyl) dimethyl ammonium chloride, are widely used in commercially available rinse conditioner compositions. Other examples of these cationic compounds are to be found in "Surface-Active Agents and Detergents", Volumes I and II, by Schwartz, Perry and Berch. Any of the conventional types of such compounds may be used in the compositions of the present invention.<br>
The fabric softening compounds are preferably compounds that provide excellent softening, and are characterised by a chain melting LB to La transition temperature greater than 25°C, preferably greater than 35°C, most preferably greater than 45°C.  This LB to La transition can be measured by DSC as defined in "Handbook of Lipid Bilayers", D Marsh, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida, 1990 {pages 137 and 337).<br>
Substantially water-insoluble fabric softening compounds are defined as fabric softening compounds having a solubility of less than 1 x 1C"3 wt % in dernir.eralised water at 20°C. Preferably the fabric softening compounds have a solubility of less than 1 x ID"1 wc%, mere preferably less than 1 x 10"8 to 1 x 10'6 WtS<br><br>
Especially preferred are cationic fabric softening compounds that are water-insoluble quaternary ammonium materials having two C12-22 alkyl or alkenyl groups connected to the molecule via at least one ester link, preferably two ester links.  An especially preferred ester-linked quaternary ammonium material can be represented by the formula II:<br><br>
wherein each Ri group is independently selected from Cj..4 alkyl or hydroxyalkyl groups or C2-4 alkenyl groups; each R2 group is independently selected from C8-26 alkyl or alkenyl groups; and wherein R3 is a linear or branched alkylene group of 1 to 5 carbon atoms, T is<br><br>
and p is 0 or is an integer from 1 to 5.<br>
Di(tallowoxyloxyethyl) dimethyl ammonium chloride and/or its hardened tallcw analogue is especially preferred cf the compounds- of"formula (II) .<br><br>
A second preferred type of quaternary ammonium material can be represented by the formula (III):<br><br>
wherein Ri, p and R2 are as defined above.<br>
It is advantageous if the quaternary ammonium material is biologically biodegradable.<br>
Preferred materials of this class such as 1,2-bis(hardened tallowoyloxy)-3-trimethylammonium propane chloride and their methods of preparation are, for example, described in US 4 137 180 (Lever Brothers Co).  Preferably these materials comprise small amounts of the corresponding monoester as described in US 4 137 160, for example, 1-hardened tallowoyloxy-2-hydroxy-3-trimethylanmonium propane chloride.<br>
Other useful cationic softening agents are alkyl pyridinium salts and substituted imidazoline species. Also useful are primary, secondary and tertiary amines and the condensation products of fatty acids with alkylpoiyamines.<br><br>

Nonionic softeners include LP phase forming sugar esters (as described in M Hato et al Langmuir 12, 1659, 1666, (1996)) and related materials such as glycerol mcr.ostearate or sorbitan esters. Often these materials are used in conjunction with cationic materials to assist deposition (see, for example, GB 2 202 244) .  Silicones are used in a similar way as a co-softener with a cationic softener in rinse treatments (see, for example, GB I 5'49 1'8'0)'.<br>
The compositions may also suitably' contain a nonior.ic stabilising agent.  Suitable nonionic stabilising agents are linear C8 to CJ2 alcohols alkoxylated with 10 to 2 0 moles of alkylene oxide, C10to C20 alcohols, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Advantageously the nonionic stabilising agenz is a linear Ca to C22 alcohol alkoxylated with 10to 20 r.oles of alkylene oxide.   Preferably, the level of nonionic stabiliser is<br><br>
within the range from 0.1 to 10% by weight', more preferably from 0.5 to 5% by weight, most preferably from 1 to 4% by weight.  The mole ratio of the quaternary ammonium compound and/or other cationic softening agent to the nonionic stabilising agent is suitably within the range from 40:1 to about 1:1, preferably within the range from 18:1 to about 3:1.<br>
The composition can also contain fatty acids, for example Cs to C24 alkyl or aikenyl monocarboxylic acids or polymers thereof.  Preferably saturated fatty acids are used, in particular, hardened tallow C16to C18 fatty acids. Preferably the fatty acid is non-saponified, more preferably the fatty acid is free, for example oleic acid, lauric acid or tallow fatty acid.

Fabric Care Compositions of The Invention<br>
The fabric care compositions cf the invention are fabric softening and/or conditioner compounds, of the type described hereinabove, which comprise a liquid or soft solid<br><br>
derivative of a cyclic polyol (CPE) or of a reduced saccharide (RSE) resulting from 35 to 100% of the hydroxyl groups in the polyol or saccharide being esterified or etherified.  The CPEs or RSEs have 2 or more ester or ether groups independently attached to a C8-C22 alkyl or alkenyl chain, wherein at least one of the chains attached to the ester or ether groups has at least one saturated bond.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the use of one. or more CPEs or RSEs (such as sucrose esters) together with a polymer which is capable of self-cross-linking and/or of reacting with cellulose can give greater benefits than the polymer alone in enhancing the feeling of comfort when a garment comprising the fabric is worn.<br>
The CPE or RSE used according to the invention does not have any substantial crystalline character at 20CC.  Instead it is preferably in a liquid or soft solid state as herein defined at 20°C.<br>
The liquid or soft solid (as hereinafter defined) CPEs or RSSs of the present; invention.-results from.' 35 to: 100a%- of the, hydroxyl groups of the starting cyclic.polyol or reduced saccharide being esterified or etherified with groups such that the CPEs or RSEs are in the required liquid or soft solid state.  These groups typically contain unsaturation, branching or mixed chair, lengths.<br>
Typically the CPE's or RSE's have 3 or more ester cr ether groups cr mixtures thereof, for example 3 to 8, eg 3 to 5. It is preferred if two or more of the ester or ether groups<br><br>
of the CPE or RSE are independently of one another attached to a C8 to C22 alkyl or alkenyl chain.  The C8 to C22 alkyl or aikenyl groups may be branched or linear carbon chains.<br>
Preferably 35 to 85% of the hydroxyl groups, most preferably 40-80%, even more preferably 45-75%, such as 45-70% are esterified or etherified.<br>
 Preferably the CPE or RSE contains at least 3 5% tri or higher esters, eg, at least 40%.<br>
 The CPE or RSE has at least one of the chains independently<br>
 attached to the ester or ether groups having at least one<br>
 unsaturated bond.  This provides a cost effective way of<br>
 making the CPE or RSE a liquid or a soft solid.  It is<br>
 preferred if predominantly unsaturated fatty chains are<br>
 attached to the ester/ether groups, e.g. those attached are<br><br>
 defined from rape oil,   cctcon seed oil,   soybean oil,   oleic,<br><br>
 tallow, palmitoleic, linoleic, erucic or other sources of<br>
 unsaturated vegetable fatty acids.<br>
These chains are referred :o below as the ester or ether chain3 (of the CPE or RSE) .<br>
The ester or ether chains cf the CPE or RSE are preferably predominantly unsaturated.  The most, preferred CPEs or RSSs are those with monosaturated fatty acid chains, i.e. where any polyunsaturation has been removed by partial hydrcgenation.  Preferred CPEs or RSEs include sucrose tetratallowate, sucrose tecrarapeate, sucrose tetraoleate, sucrose tetraestars of soybean oil cr cotton seed oil, cellobiose tezraoleate, sucrose trioleate, sucrose<br><br>
triapeate, sucrose pentaoleate, sucrose pentarapeate, sucrose hexaoleate, sucrose hexarapeate, sucrose triesters, pentaes~ers ar.d hexaesters of soybean oil or cotton seed oil, glucose tiroleate, glucose tetraoleate, xylose trioleate, or sucrose tetra-,tri-, petita- or hexa- esters with any mixture of predominantly unsaturated fatty acid chains.  However some CPSs or RSEs based on polyunsaturated fatty acid chains, eg sucrose tetralinoleate, may be used provided most of the polyunsaturation has been removed by partial hydrogenation.<br>
The most highly preferred liquid CPEs or RSEs are any of the above but where the polyunsaturation has been removed through partial hydrogenation.<br>
Preferably 4 0% or	more of the fatty acid chains contain an<br>
unsaturated bond,	more preferably 50% or more, most<br>
preferably 60% or	more.  In most cases 65% to 100%, eg 65%<br>
to 95% contain an	unsaturated bond.<br>
CPEs are preferred for. use with the.present.invention. Inositol is a preferred example of a cyclic polyol. Inositol derivatives are especially preferred.<br>
In the context of the present invention the term cyclic polyol encompasses all forms of saccharides.  Indeed saccharides are especially preferred for use with this invention.  Examples of preferred saccharides for the CPE's or RSE.' s to be derived from are monosaccharides and disaccharides.<br><br>
Examples cf monosaccharides include xylose, arabinose, galactose, fructose, sorbose and glucose.  Glucose is especially preferred.  An example of a reduced saccharide is sorbitan.  Examples of disaccharides include maltose, laczose, cellobiose and sucrose.  Sucrose is especially preferred.<br>
The liquid or soft solid CPE's can be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art. These include acylation of the cyclic polyol or reduced saccharide with an acid chloride; trans-esterification of the cyclic polyol or reduced saccharide fatty acid esters using a variety of catalysts; acylation of the cyclic polyol or reduced saccharide with an acid anhydride and acylation of the cyclic polyol or reduced saccharide with a fatty acid.  See for instance US 4 38S 213 and AU 14416/88 (Procter and Gamble).<br>
It is preferred if the CPE or RSE has 3 cr more, preferably 4 cr more ester or ether groups.  If the cyclic CPE is a disaceharide it is preferred if the disaccharide has 3 or more ester or ether groups. Particularly preferred CPE's are esters with a degree of esterificaticn of 3 to 5, for example, sucrose tri, tetra and panta esters.<br>
Where uhe cyclic polyol is a reducing sugar it is advantageous if each ring of the CPE has cr.e ether group, preferably at the Ci position.  Suitable examples of such compounds include methyl glucose derivatives.<br><br>
Examples of suitable CPEs include esters of<br>
alkyl (poly)glucosides, in particular alkyl glucoside esters<br>
having a degree of polymerisation from 1 to 2.<br>
The length of the unsaturated (and saturated if present) chains in the CPE or RSE is C3-C22, preferably C12-C22.  It is possible to include one or more chains of C1-C3, however these are less preferred.<br>
The liquid or soft solid CPE's or RSE's of the present invention are characterised as materials having a solid:liquid ratio of between 50:50 and 0:100 at 20°C as determined by T2 relaxation time NMR, preferably between 43:57 and 0:100, most preferably between 40:60 and 0:100, such as, 20:80 and 0:100.  The T2  NMR relaxation time is commonly used for characterising solid:liquid ratios in soft solid products such as fats and margarines. For the purpose of the present invention, any component of the signal with a T2 of less than 100 us is considered to be a solid component and any component with T2 &gt; 100 us is considered to be a liquid component.<br>
For the CPE's and RSE's the tetra, penta etc prefixes only indicate the average degrees of esterification.  The compounds exist as a mixture of materials ranging from the monoester to the fully esterified ester.  It is the average degree of esterification which is used herein to define the CPE's and RSE's.<br><br>
The HLB of the CPE or R3E is typically between 1 and 3.<br>
The CPE or RSE is preferably present in the composition in an amount of 0.5-50% by weight based upon the total weigh:: of the composition, more preferably 1-30% by weight, such as 2-25%, eg 2-20%.<br>
The CPEs and RSEs for use in the compositions include those recited in the following examples, including, sucrose pentaoleate, sucrose tetraoleate, sucrose pentaerucate, sucrose tetraerucate and sucrose pentaoleate.<br>
Fabric Treatment Products<br>
The composition of the invention may be in the form of a liquid, solid (e.g. powder or tablet), a gel or paste, spray, stick or a foam or mousse.  Examples including a soaking product, a rinse treatment (e.g. conditioner or finisher) or a mainwash product. The composition may also be applied to a substrate e.g. a flexible sheet or used in a dispenser which can be used in the wash cycle, rinse cycle or during "the dryer cycle-.<br>
The invention will now be described by way of example only and with reference to the following nor.-limiting examples.<br><br>
EXAMPLES Examples 1 to 3 	 General Procedure<br>
(a)	Preparation of Fabric<br>
Knitted cotton (Pheonix Calico, Macclesfield, UK) was cut into sheets approximately lm x 1.7m.  The sheets (10 sheets/load) were washed once with detergent (Persil Non-Biological (trade mark) 90g) in a top loading washing machine (9605 Hotpoint (trade mark) using a 60°C cotton wash cycle).  They were washed a further three times using a 40°C woollen cycle in the absence of detergent.  The sheets were dried in a tumble drier (Novotronic T430 (trade mark) Miele, Germany) at approximately 65°C and stored under ambient conditions prior to treatment with polymers.<br>
(b)	Treatment of fabric<br>
Fabric .samples . (approximately 50cm x 85cm ,55g}. were cut, from the sheets. The samples were treated with the following polymers:<br>
Example 1 - catior.ic polyamide-epichlorohydrin azetidinium functional polymer (PAE), Kenores 1440 (trade mark) ex Akzo Nobel;<br>
Example 2   -   adduce of an isocyanate-terminatsd pclyurethane !S3A?), Synthappret 3AP (trade mark) ex Bayer;<br><br>
Example 3 - cationic polyoxyalkylene-based azetidium functional polymer (AM), Polymer AM (trade mark) ex Precision Processes Textiles Ltd, Ambergate, UK.<br>
The polymers were pad applied to the fabric samples (20°C, 100 wet pick-up) to a yield a final concentration of 2% on weight of fabric (owf).  Samples padded with demineralised water acted as controls.  Treated samples were cured in an oven (Plus II Oven, Gallenkamp, Germany) at 110°C for 45 min before being ironed lightly (cool cotton setting).. Samples..were conditioned in a humidity room (20°C, 65% relative humidity (RH)) for a minimum of 24 hours prior to testing for moisture transport properties.<br>
(c)  Fabric Testing<br>
Three tests were used to measure the moisture transport properties of the fabric; wicking, spreading drop and upright cup. All tests were performed in a humidity room at 20°C, 65% RH.<br>
Wicking test<br>
Fabric strips (20cm x 3cm) were held longitudinally in a clamp.  The free end of each strip was weighted with a paper clip (C.2g).  The strips were lowered into a trough containing demineralised water (11) so that the betton C.Sen of zhe  fabric was submerged.  The wicking height was measured as the maximum distance travelled by the water up the strip after 15 minutes.<br><br>
Spreading drop test<br>
Fabric circles (9cm diameter) were placed on a glass plate. Denineralised water (0.2ml) was pipetted drop-wise onto the centre of the fabric circle.  The wetted area was measured at its widest point after 3 min.<br>
Upright cup test<br>
Fabric circles (9cm diameter) were placed over the top of a polyethylene cup containing demineralised water (170ml). The fabric was held firmly in place with a polyethylene ring which formed a tight seal between the fabric and the cup. The cups were placed on a turntable which was rotated at 3 3 revolutions per minute (rpm) and air was blown over the surface of the fabric (2,5 m/s) using a fan.  Moisture vapour transport through the fabric was measured by calculating the weight of water lost from the cup after 24h.<br>
The wicking and spreading drop tests were performed in triplicate- for. each" sample. The-upright.'cup test. was. performed in duplicate for each sample.. The entire procedure was carried out on three_separate occasions.<br><br>

Thus, treatment of the fabric according to Examples 1 to 3 had the effect of increasing water vapour, transport through the fabric.  The hydrophilicity of the fabric was also generally increased, as demonstrated by the results for the wicking test and the spreading drop test.<br><br>
Examples 4 to 6<br>
Delivery of Compositions During the Rinse Cycle<br>
Fabric preparation and treatment<br>
Fabric {69k  cotton, 31% polyester) was cut into sheets approximately lm x 1m and overlooked.  Three sheets were weighted and placed in a Miele (trade mark) European front-loading washing machine.  Ballast (strips of surplus fabric) was added to bring the total load weight up to 1.5 kg. Detergent (Persil Non-Biological (trade mark), 55g) was poured into the main-wash compartment of the dispensing drawer and the wash cycle initiated.  The machines were filled with 12.11 of water and the fabric was washed for 30 min at 40°C.  A further 3.71 of water was added before the wash load was drained. The fabric was rinsed three times (10.51 water/rinse) and drained. The wash cycle was paused and appropriate quantities of rinse treatment (polymar AM (AM), Hamburg Ester Quaternary ie, 1,2,-bis [hardened tallowoyloxy]-3-trimethylammonium-propane chloride (HEQ) + AM,, or: sucrose; polyerucate. (SPE.).+AM,were/ pouced. into, the main-wash compartment of the dispensing drawee.  The wash cycle was initiated once more. Water (10.71) was introduced, and the wash load agitated for 5 rr.in.  The water was drained and the fabric spin-dried.<br>
Fabric was removed from the washing machine sr.d dried in a tumble drier (Novotronic T43 0 (trade mark), Miele (trade mark)) at -approximately 65 °C.<br><br>
The procedure was repeated or. twelve separate occasions f each load of fabric.<br>
FaEric'was conditioned in a humidity room (20°C, 65% relative humidity) for a minimum of 24 h prior to testing for moisture transport properties.<br>
