				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for preparation of a bio-pesticide containing a plant extract or fractions of Callistemon and to a bio-pesticide.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
With rapid emergence of resistance of insect pests to commercially available chemical insecticides/pesticides, bio-pesticides are gaining increasing importance for integrated pest management. Plants produce compounds that may repel pests or may alter then-feeding behavior, growth, development, moulting process, or may disrupt their mating and oviposition that can be well utilized for pest management programs. The bio-pesticides are thus effective in disrupting the behavior and physiology of pest and at the same time preserve the cleanliness and balance of agro eco systems.<br>
The most commonly used plants as insecticide/pesticide are pyrethrums from Chtymnthenmm cmemriaefotimn, rotenoids from the genera Denis, Lonchocarpus, Tephrmia and Munchiela, nocotinoids from Nicotiana species, triterpenoids from Azadirachta indica and alkaloids from sabadilla. All of them particularly Neem (Azadirachta indica) based formulations have been found to be effective against several pests which include rice cut worm, diamond back moth, rice brown plant hopper, rice green leafhopper, tobacco caterpiller and several species of aphids and mites. Several commercial formulation of neem as 'Green Insecticide' have been registered in India and other countrite. Several plant derived steroids have been reported to prevent insect molting. There are number of others plant based compounds like N-lsobutylamides, limonoids, clerodanes cpolyhydroxyalkaloids etc which have been identified for their pest control properties.<br>
The members of genus Catlistemon are subject of great interest owing to the presence of essential oils which are utilized for various industrial purposes. Beside this, the biological activity of the plant against insect pest-species has drawn considerable attention, particularly for the control of stored grain pests.<br>
Sharma and Co-workers conducted the study of the insecticidal, antifeeant and growth inhibitory activities of the leaf essential oils Callistemon lanceilatus against third instar spodoptera htura larvae collected from Haryana, India. For antifeedant bioassays, essential oil was at 2.5 and 10.0% concentration and for insect development assay concentrations were reduced to 2.0, 1.0. 0.5 and 0.25% level. At 10.0%, C. lanceolatus caused 100% deterrence of feeding, though no mortality was recorded.<br>
Two novel epimeric compounds, viminadiones A and B, were isolated by Khambay and associates from the leaves and stems of C.viminalis following bioassay-guided fractionation. Vimidione A exhibited moderate insecticidal activity when compared with natural pyrethrum extract while viminadione B was found less active.<br>

Statement of Invention<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for the preparation of a biopesticide containing a plant extract or fractions of Caliistemon comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	extraction of dried ground plant leaves of Caliistemon,<br>
b)	concentrating the polar extract,<br>
c)	dissolving the concentrated extract in a non polar solvent, followed by filtration and coscentration<br>
d)	dissolving the concentrated residual in aqueous acetone, subjecting the mixture to filtration to obtain a semi brown solid (fraction),<br>
e)	adding 10 to 50% (w/v) of fraction to 1-5 parts by weight of an emulsifier and 45 to 94 parts by weight of solvent.<br>
Further according to this invention there is provided a biopesticide containing 10 to 50% (w/v) of plant extract of Callistemon, 1 to 5% of emuisifier and 45 to 94% of solvent. Description of Process<br>
in accordance with this invention, the process for preparation of a bio-pesticide formulation based oa the piant extract or fractions of Callistemon comprises steps of :-<br>
a)	air drying the leaves of callistemon leaves for 2-3 days till the moisture content in the leaves is less than 10%. This is followed by grinding to fine particles and sieving.<br>
b)	Solvent extraction by an organic polar solvent selected form alcohols such as ethanol, methanol, butanol, propanol, ketones such as acetone, butane, water or combination of two or more solvants at a temperature upto 50°C, taking the powder of the plant leaves and the solvent in the ratio varying from 1:5 to 1:10 (W/V). The said solvent extraction being carried at least three times.<br>
c)	Concentrating the polar extract thus obtained by step (b) by evaporation under vacuum in a rotary evaporator so that the volume is reduced by 90%.<br>
d)	dissolving the concentrated extract in a non-polar solvent such as hexane, dichioromethane and ethyl acetate. The concentrated extract and non-polar solvent are taken in the ratio varying from 1:5 to 1:10 (v/v). This is followed by filtration and residue thus obtained is subjected to concentration in a rotary evaporator.<br>
e) dissolving the concentrated residue obtained as above, in 70% aqueous acetone taking the concentrated residue and acetone in the ratio of 1:5 to 1.10. The mixture thus obtained is filtered to collect the filtrate. The acetone form the filtrate is evaporated off. The mixture thus obtained is filtered to separate out semi brown solid to obtain a fraction I.<br>
f)	dissolving the traction I obtained as above in an organic solvent and adding an emulsifier to get a stable formulation which can be used at field level. Emulsifier is selected so as to get the desired hydrophilie and lipophilic balance (HLB), winch is required to get a stable formulation. For this purpose organic solvent is such as polyethylene glycol, ethanol, butanol, acetone and any combination of two or more solvents. The organic solvent is taken in quantiy of 45 to 94% by weight. The emulsifier is such as DMA-NE Tween-80, Span-80 or any combination thereof and is taken in quantity (1 to 5%) by weight preferably polyethylene glycol is used as an organic solvent and DMA-NE is used as an emulsifier:<br>
g)	Optionally, adding an additional stabilizer in quantity 0 to 1% to enhance the solubility and stability of the compositiott. The said additional stabilizer is such as wetting agent, acidifying agent, or an anti-oxidant.<br>
The composition of the bio-pesticide formulation in liquid form contains 5-50% (w/v) preferably 20% (w/v) plant extract, 1-5% of emulsifier and 45-94% of solvent. The composition may also include antioxidants agents and stabilizers.<br>
The emulsifier comprise as non-ionic or anionic emulsifier or surfactant to enhance the solubility and stability of the composition. Examples of non-ionic surfactants include, but not limited to polyoxyethylated alkylphenols, polyoxyethylated sorbitan monoesters, polyoxyethylated fatty or aryl-alkyl alcohols, fatty acids and esters.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated with a working example which is just an example to illustrate the working of the invention and is not intended to be taken restrictively to imply any limitation on the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example<br>
100 g of ground fine powder of air dried leaves of Callistemon, having moisture less than 10%, were solvent extracted with 1 litre of ethanol at a temperature of 45°C. The extraction was repeated three times. The extract thus obtained was concentrated in a rotary evaporator so that the volume is reduced by 90%. After concentration, 22g of concentrate was obtained. This was dissolved in 220ml of hexane. The mixture was filtered. The filtrate was rejected and the residue obtained was subjected to rotary evaporation for solvent removal, obtaining Fraction-1. 15g of residue thus obtained was dissolved in 150ml of 70% aqueous solution of acetone. The mixture was filtered. The filtrate thus obtained was concentrated in a rotary evaporator. The contents thus obtained were filtered to obtain a semi brown colour solid fraction.<br>
Test of pesticidal activity of the fractions and formulattens<br>
The fractions and formulations were tested for their bioefficacy against Helicoverpa armigera larva for their growth inhibitory property. The insect diet treated with concentration ranging from 0.01-1% (w/w) of the formulation of callistemon extract, were offered to 24 hr old larva of H.armigera. The experiments were conducted using 15 larva per treatment. The growth inhibition was observed on 7* and 10* day after treatment by weighing the larva and the mean weight of each treatment group were expressed as percentage of controls. The fraction 1 and 2 when fed to Helicomrpa armigera larva stew enhanced growth inhibitory activity as compared to the crude extracts (Table 1,2) The formulations of the present invention were found to be far more active than the crude and fractions (Table 3).<br>
