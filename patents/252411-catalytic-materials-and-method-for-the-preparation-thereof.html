Field of the Invention <br>
The invention is related to mesoporous catalysts and particularly to novel mesoporous<br>
molecular sieves embedded with a zeolite, having high thermal stability, and to a<br>
method for the preparation of the catalytic materials. Said catalytic materials are<br>
suitable for applications in the field of hydrocarbon processing.<br>
State of the Art<br>
Mesoporous molecular sieves as catalytic materials have attracted the attention of<br>
scientists because of their unique properties, such as large uniform pores having a<br>
very high surface area, the size of which can be varied from 2 to 50 nm. However,<br>
mesoporous molecular sieves known in the art are often thermally and<br>
hydrothermally not very stable, the pore walls are amorphous and they have mild<br>
acidic properties. Further more, during the regeneration of the spent catalyst after<br>
hydrocarbon processing, the mesoporous molecular sieve structure may collapse.<br>
Crystalline materials having pore size in the microporous area (d 
catalysts and as carriers of catalysts on an industrial scale. Zeolites are well-known<br>
examples of such materials. Zeolites are widely used because of their special<br>
properties, such as large surface area, high capacity of adsorption and possibility to<br>
regulate adsorption capacity. It is possible to create active sites in the zeolite<br>
structure, build up active sites and to regulate the strength and amount of the acid<br>
sites. The pore size of zeolites is typically in the range of 0.4 - 1.2 nm and both the<br><br>
thermal and chemical stability of zeolites are high. However, the ability of zeolites to<br>
process molecules having larger molecular size than the pore size of the zeolites is<br>
limited and further, zeolites are deactivated relatively rapidly in several reactions.<br>
US 5,198,203 discloses a family of ordered, mesoporous molecular sieves, designated<br>
as M41S and developed in the beginning of 90's. M41S is a group of mesoporous<br>
molecular sieve materials formed in an aqueous solution with silica and alumina<br>
precursors with CiH2i(CH3)N+- cations (i &gt; 7) at hydrothermal conditions. The most<br>
well known members of this group are hexagonal MCM-41, cubic MCM-48 and<br>
plate-like structure MCM-50. The pore size of the mesoporous molecular sieve can be<br>
regulated between 2 and 10 run and the composition may contain pure silica or<br>
metallosilica (e.g. A1-, V- and Ti-substituted silica). The mesoporous molecular sieve materials of the M4IS group are amgrophous by nature and their pore system is<br>
ordered.<br>
A synthetic composition of a material comprising ultra-large pore crystalline phase is<br>
disclosed in US 5,246,689 and US 5,334,368. This material is inorganic, porous and<br>
non-layered having pore dimensions between 1.3 and 20 nm. The pore size<br>
distribution within a single phase is to some extent regular. At least one peak in the<br>
X-ray diffraction pattern at d-spacing is greater than 1.8 nm.<br>
EP 0 748 652 discloses a group of mesoporous materials (MSA) having a narrow<br>
pore size distribution. This material was amorphous and totally disordered. The BET<br>
surface area of the material was in the range of672-837m2/g.<br>
Synthetically produced mesoporous materials are not acidic or their acidity is limited.<br>
The amount of acid sites in mesoporous materials has been increased by<br>
incorporation of aluminium in the silica structure of the mesoporous material. The<br><br>
strength of the acidity of the mesoporous materials described above is, however, less<br>
than the strength of the acidity of the zeolites.<br>
Various methods for the manufacture of mesoporous materials are known in the art.<br>
have been made to increase thermal and hydrothermal stability and acidity<br>
of mesoporous molecular sieves, for example by introducing catalytically active<br>
species in the mesoporous structures. In principal, the methods of synthesis comprise<br>
preparation of a silicon source solution with an organic agent or agents, adjusting the<br>
pH of the solution to a value where precipitation occurs, followed by recovering and<br>
calcination of the precipitate. An aluminium source is added to the solution in any<br>
step prior to the starting of the synthesis at elevated temperature. Several surfactants<br>
and templates (organic agents), compositions, solvents and reaction conditions have<br>
been suggested,<br>
US 5,942,208 describes a method for the preparation of mesoporous material having<br>
improved hydrothermal stability when compared to MCM-41. Various salts were<br>
used in the method and the pH of the solution was adjusted with mild acids.<br>
EP 0 795 517 provides a method for the synthesis of mesoporous materials wherein a<br>
mixture of a silicon source and organic template containing fluorine was used.<br>
US 5,942,208 describes the preparation of a mesoporous molecular sieve having<br>
thermal and hydrothermal stability superior to the ones of traditional mesoporous<br>
molecular sieves. The material could be boiled in water for 12 hours without essential<br>
changes in the structure.<br>
An alternative approach for the manufacture of stable and active mesoporous<br>
materials is to introduce zeolites into the walls of the mesopores. US 09/764,686<br><br>
discloses the synthesis of mesoporous materials using Y-zeolite seed, MFT zeolite<br>
seed and beta-zeolite seed.<br>
CN 1349929 teaches the preparation of MSA-3 and MAS-8 using L-zeolite precursor<br>
solutions.<br>
Kloetstra et al Micropor. Mesopor. Mater. 6 (1996) 287 have reported in situ<br>
formation of faujasite and MCM-41. Their approach was based on sequential<br>
synthesis of zeolites and MCM-41.<br>
Karlsson et al,. Micropor. Mesopor Mater. 27 (1999) 181 disclose the use of mixed<br>
template approach for the simultaneous synthesis of zeolite/MCM-41 phases.<br>
The materials may be mixtures of two or more phases, or loosely bonded zeolite and<br>
mesoporous material in the case the synthesis approach is to grow and deposit MCM-<br>
41 over zeolite, or zeolite seeds may be added to the gel.<br>
Two different types of templates have been used in the synthesis of mesoporous<br>
materials. The reproducibility of such manufacturing methods may be difficult.<br>
Furthermore, in the absence of chemical interaction between the zeolite and<br>
mesoporous molecular sieve, thermal and hydrothermal stability of the resulting<br>
materials is likely to be low.<br>
According to the state of the art, mesoporous molecular sieves have a wide range of<br>
applications in catalysis as active phases or as supports. Several hydrocarbon<br>
conversion reactions are acid catalysed. Based on their acid catalysed function,<br>
zeolites are know to be active in double-bond and skeletal isomerization of olefins,<br>
isomerization of paraffins, cracking, dimerization of olefins, oligomerization of<br>
olefins, ring opening of naphthenes, alkylation, transalkylation of aromatics,<br><br>
aromatization etc. Bifunctional catalyst having metal or metal-oxide or sulfide phases<br>
are applicable in reactions such as reforming, isomerization of paraffins,<br>
hydrocracking, catalytic dewaxing, dehydrosulfurization, dehydrooxygenation,<br>
dehydronitrogenation and several hydrogenation reactions. The major drawbacks in<br>
the use of the zeolites are their relative high ability for deactivation and limited<br>
capacity of handling of bulky molecules.<br>
Based on the above it can be seen that there exists a need for thermally and<br>
hydrothermally stable catalytic materials based on mesoporous molecular sieves and<br>
for a method for the preparation of such thermally and hydrotherrnally stable catalytic<br>
materials. It is also obvious that there is a need for a catalyst having zeolite type<br>
active site but also high accessibility of the active sites for reactants, short diffusion<br>
path length of reactants and products limiting secondary reactions and coking.<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a novel and active catalytic material having<br>
mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with a zeolite structure, particularly for<br>
hydrocarbon conversion reactions.<br>
A further object of the invention is a mechanically, thermally and hydrotherrnally<br>
stable mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with a zeolite, having zeolite type<br>
acidity.<br>
A still further object of the invention is a method for the manufacture of said catalytic<br>
material having mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with a zeolite structure.<br><br>
A still farther object of the invention is the use of said catalytic material having<br>
mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with a zeolite structure in hydrocarbon<br>
conversion reactions.<br>
The characteristic features of the mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with a<br>
zeolite, of the method for the manufacture thereof and of the use of the mesoporous<br>
molecular sieve embedded with a zeolite are stated in the claims.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Without wishing to be restricted by the following explanations and theoretical<br>
considerations regarding the synthesis of the novel catalytic material having<br>
mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with a zeolite structure,which is particularly <br>
suitable for hydrocarbon conversion reactions, the essential features of the invention<br>
are discussed as follows.<br>
The present invention relates to a novel and active catalytic material having a<br>
mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with a zeolite structure. The invention relates<br>
also to a method for the preparation of the mesoporous molecular sieve embedded<br>
with a zeolite whereby the synthesis is facilitated and reproducible and the product<br>
exhibits high catalytic activity.<br>
The catalytic material having mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with zeolite<br>
structure is suitable for hydrocarbon conversion reactions and particularly for<br>
processing of high molecular weight hydrocarbons. This novel catalytic material can<br>
be used as a component of a catalyst in cracking, hydrocracking, ring opening,<br>
hydrogenation of aromatics and especially multiaromatics, dimerization of olefins,<br>
oligomerization, isomerization of olefins and paraffins, alkylation of aromatics,<br><br>
etherification, hydrodesulphurization and reforming, or as such or with modifications<br>
known from the state of art.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
It has now been found that the problems relating to zeolite catalysts and mesoporous<br>
catalysts according to the state of the art can be avoided or at least significantly<br>
decreased by the novel catalytic material according to the invention, which is a<br>
mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with zeolite, having high mechanical, thermal<br>
and hydrothermal stability. The novel mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with a<br>
zeolite is thermally stable at temperatures of at least 900 °C in the presence of air.<br>
 The present invention pxovidgs a group of novel mesoporous molecular sieves<br>
embedded with zeolites, which are mechanically, thermally and hydrothermally<br>
stable. The materials are very well reproducible as can be seen in the examples, and<br>
they exhibit superior properties in several hydrocarbon conversion reactions. The<br>
group of the novel mesoporous molecular sieves embedded with zeolites are named<br>
mesoporous materials (MM). Mesoporous means here materials having pores of 2 -<br>
15 nm and their pore system is regular.<br>
The mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with a zeolite comprises a mesoporous<br>
molecular sieve selected from M41S group, which is defined on page 2 and<br>
comprises mesoporous materials with ordered pore system. Preferably the<br>
mesoporous molecular sieve is selected from mesoporous alurnino-silicates known as<br>
the MCM-41 group.<br>
The mesoporous molecular sieve is embedded with a zeolite selected from medium<br>
pore zeolites, which are 10-member ring zeolites like MFI, MTT, TON, AEF, MWW<br>
and FER structures, and large pore zeolites, which are 12-member ring zeolites like<br><br>
BEA, FAU and MOR structures. Examples of said zeolite groups are ZSM-5, ZSM-<br>
23, ZSM-22, SAPO-11, MCM-22, ferrierite, beta, Y-and X-zeolites and mordenite.<br>
Preferably the zeolite is MFI, MTT, AEF, MWW, MOR or BEA zeolite.<br>
The catalytic material contains 0.01 - 10 wt-% of aluminium (Al).<br>
A catalyst, which is particularly suitable for industrial and commercial use, comprises<br>
the mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with a zeolite according to the invention<br>
and also a carrier selected from alumina, silica, clay and any other carrier according<br>
to the state of the art, and combinations thereof. Preferably the carrier comprises<br>
alumina or silica. The amount of the carrier varies between 10-90 wt-%, calculated<br>
on the total weight of the catalyst.<br>
The novel group of catalytic materials having a mesoporous molecular sieve<br>
embedded with a zeolite structure according to the invention exhibits high specific<br>
surface area (BET) in the range of 1400 - 500 m2/g, preferably 1200-600 m2/g.<br>
The X-ray powder diffraction pattern of the catalytic material according to the<br>
invention demonstrates the mesoporous molecular sieve and zeolite structures. The<br>
unit cell dimension of the zeolite varies with amount of Al in the catalytic material.<br>
The unit cell size decreases with the amount of Al, from 1.982 nm in a catalytic<br>
material containing 0.2 wt% of Al to 1.972 nm in a catalytic material containing 3.9<br>
wt% of Al, when the zeolite type was MFI (the code of the material is MM5). The<br>
change in the unit cell size is opposite to the changes observed in zeolites in general.<br>
The unit cell sizes were 1.428 nm and 1.430 nm, when the zeolite type was BEA (the<br>
code of the material is MMBE), the unit cell sizes were 1.406 nm and 1.436 nm,<br>
when the zeolite type was MWW (the code of the material is MMMW22) and the unit<br><br>
cell sizes were 1.800 ran and 1.806 run, when the zeolite type was MOR (the code of<br>
the material is MMMO).<br>
The d100 spacing in the mesoporous molecular sieve MCM-41 decreases with<br>
increasing zeolite content. The d100 varies from 4.4 nm to 3.8 nm in MM5 and the d100<br>
varies from 4.1 nm to 4.0 nm in MMBE and MMMO, and from 4.0 to 4.2 in<br>
MMMW.<br>
The unit cell dimension and the d100 values are the same in pure zeolite and MCM-41<br>
phases as in their mechanical mixtures.<br>
The changes in the d100 spacing and the unit cell dimension are a clear evidence of a<br>
true chemical bonding between the mesoporous molecular sieve and the embedded<br>
zeolite in the catalytic material according to the invention.<br>
The characteristic features of the catalytic material according to the invention, the<br>
mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with a zeolite, were measured by X-ray<br>
powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy,<br>
specific surface area measurement using nitrogen absorption (BET) and acidity<br>
measurements using ammonia-TPD and pyridine-FTIR..<br>
The total number of acid sites can be measured by the capacity of the catalytic<br>
material to bind strong base molecules, such as ammonia or pyridine. The total<br>
acidity was measured by ammonia-temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and<br>
Bronsted and Lewis acidity by pyridine-infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).<br><br>

The acidity of the catalytic material can be tailored by the amount of A1 introduced in<br>
the structure and modifying the aluminium (Al) content in the zeolite, MCM-41 and<br>
MM phases. In Figures la and lb the correlation between the acidity and aluminium<br><br>
content in the catalytic materials according to the invention is presented. Figure la<br>
shows the linearity of total acidity as a function of Al-content in the various MM<br>
catalytic materials and Figure 1 b shows how the zeolitic and the MCM-41 catalytic<br>
materials deviate in total acidity from the MM catalytic materials. The zeolites exhibit<br>
larger amount of acid sites as a function of Al content than MM5, MMBE and<br>
MMMW samples, MCM-41 is less acidic with similar aluminium content.<br>
Since there are no international standard methods available for acidity determination,<br>
the methods used here are described below.<br>
Acidity determination was performed by NH3-TPD. The total acidity of catalytic<br>
materials was measured by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-<br>
 TPD)using an Altamira AMI 100 instrument Sample size was 40 mg The total<br>
acidity was measured by desorption of NH3 as a function of temperature. The acidity<br>
of the samples was calculated from the amount of NH3 adsorbed at 200 °C and<br>
desorbed between 100 °C and 500 °C. The NH3-TPD instrument was equipped with a<br>
thermal conductivity detector (TCD) manufactured by company Gow Mac. A ramp<br>
rate of 20 °C/min was applied and the temperature was linearly raised to 500 °C<br>
where it was held for 30 min. The quantification was made using pulses of known<br>
volume of 10 % NH3 in He.<br>
Acidity determination was determined also by pyridine-FTIR. The acidity of samples<br>
was measured by infrared spectroscopy (ATI Mattson FTIR.) by using pyridine (≥<br>
99.5 %, a.r.) as a probe molecule for qualitative and quantitative determination of<br>
both Bronsted and Lewis acid sites. The samples were pressed into thin self-<br>
supported wafers (10-12 mg/cm2). Pyridine was first adsorbed for 30 min at 100 °C<br>
and then desorbed by evacuation at different temperatures (250. 300, and 450 °C) to<br>
obtain a distribution of acid site strengths. All spectra were recorded at 100 °C with a<br>
spectral resolution equal to 2 cm-1. Spectral bands at 1545 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1,<br><br>
respectively, were used for identifying Bronsted (BAS) and Lewis acid sites (LAS).<br>
The amounts of BAS and LAS were calculated from the intensities of corresponding<br>
spectral bands by using the molar extinction coefficients.<br>
The acid sites are situated on the surface of the catalytic material. The total surface<br>
area and pore volume were evaluated using N2-adsorption and desorption. The<br>
average mesopore surface area and mesopore diameter were evaluated from the N2-<br>
desorption utilizing the BJH (Barrer-Joyner-Halenda) equation. The pore diameter<br>
has a size-limiting effect both on reactants and products. The size of micropores<br>
depends on the structure of the zeolite. Pores with a diameter less than 2 nm are<br>
defined as micropores and pores with a diameter between 2 and 50 nm are defined as<br>
mesopores according to IUPAC.<br>
The N2-absorption desorption isotherms of MMBE are shown in Figure 2. The<br>
mesopore diameter remains similar, 2.4 - 2.7 nm, in the embedded material compared<br>
to 2.6 nm in the mesoporous molecular sieve.<br>
BJH desorption illustrating mesopore diameter distribution in MMBE is shown in<br>
attached Figure 3.<br>
The surface area and total pore volume decrease when the zeolite is embedded in the<br>
mesoporous molecular sieve as can be seen from table 1 below, presenting surface<br>
area, pore volume and pore diameter values for MM5, MMBE and MMMW, and for<br>
comparison MCM-41, MFI and BEA data are enclosed.<br><br><br>
The zeolite is identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD). From the XRD patterns the unit<br>
cell dimensions of the zeolite as well as of the MCM-41 phase can be measured when<br>
suitable internal standards are used. α-Al2O3 or TiO2 (rutile) was used as the internal<br>
standard.<br>
 The unit cell size of MFI was measured by ASTMD 3942-97 method,.using α-Al2O3 <br>
as internal standard.<br><br><br>
The unit cell of BEA was measured by a modified ASTM D 3942-97 method, using<br>
TiO2 as internal standard and the [302] reflection at 22°2 theta.<br>
The unit cell of MWW was measured by a modified ASTM D 3942-97 method, using<br>
α-Al2O3 as internal standard and the [100] reflection at 7.2°2 theta.<br>
The unit cell size of MMMO was estimated from the peak positions without internal<br>
standard. The estimation was ao=2 * d[100]/V3.<br>
The unit cell size of the mesoporous molecular sieve (MCM-41) was estimated by a<br>
method described by IS. Becker etal, /. Am, Chem. Soc. 114 (1992) 10834.<br>
The unit cell size of zeolites corresponds to the amount of A1 incorporated in the<br>
zeolite framework. The A1 atom is larger than the Si atom, thus the unit cell size<br>
typically increases with increasing amount of Al in most zeolites. On the contrary, in<br>
the embedded zeolite the unit cell dimension decreases with increasing amount of Al<br>
in the MM5 catalytic material, as can be seen from table 2 (MFI, BEA, MWW and<br>
MOR a0 values). The change in unit cell dimension (UCD) of MCM-41 does not<br>
correlate with the amount of Al, it rather decreases with increasing intensity of the<br>
MFI phase. The changes in unit cell dimensions are clear evidences of true chemical<br>
bonding between the mesoporous molecular sieve and the embedded zeolite.<br>
Aluminium content and unit cell dimensions of MCM-41, as well as of MFI, BEA,<br>
MWW and MOR zeolites embedded in mesoporous molecular sieve (MCM-41) are<br>
presented in the following table 2.<br><br><br>
Thermal stability of the catalytic material according to the invention was tested by<br>
exposing the embedded material to a temperature of 1000°C in air. The XRD<br>
diffraction pattern of calcined MM5 is shown in Figure 4. After thermal treatment at<br><br>
1000 °C the same pattern is obtained, as shown in Figure 5. This observation provides<br>
evidence that this catalytic material according to the invention is thermally stable to a<br>
temperature of at least 1000°C.<br>
The nanostructure of the catalytic materials according to the invention was studied by<br>
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy using (HRTEM) (Philips CM-<br>
200FEG transmission electron microscope with point resolution of 0.24 nm). The<br>
composition was measured with EDS (NORAN Voyager energy dispersive X-ray<br>
spectrometer). In Fig. 6a a HRTEM picture of the mesoporous material embedded<br>
with beta zeolite according to the invention is illustrated. For comparison, in Fig 6b,<br>

 The method for the manufacture of the mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with a<br>
zeolite is described in more detail in the following.<br>
The method for the manufacture of the mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with a<br>
zeolite comprises the steps:<br>
a)	preparing of zeolite nuclei from a silicon source and an aluminium source and<br>
structure directing agent (template R), or a silicate or aluminosilicate<br>
precursor for the zeolite nuclei, and optionally removing the template with a<br>
step calcination procedure;<br>
b)	preparing of mesoporous molecular sieve gel mixture from a silicon source,<br>
an optional aluminium source, and surfactant (S);<br>
c)	introducing the zeolite nuclei or the silicate or aluminosilicate precursor,<br>
prepared in step a) as reagents to the mesoporous molecular sieve gel mixture<br>
obtained in step b), and the zeolite nuclei or the silicate or aluminosilicate<br>
precursor are homogenised and dispersed in the molecular sieve gel;.<br>
d)	performing gel ripening of the mixture of step c) under stirring;<br><br>
e)	carrying out hydrothermal synthesis of the mixture of step c) by maintaining<br>
the mixture under sufficient conditions including a temperature of from about<br>
100 °C to about 200 °C under static or dynamic mode of stirring until crystals<br>
are formed;<br>
f)	recovering the crystals;<br>
g)	washing of the solid product;<br>
h) drying of the solid product, and<br>
i) removing the surfactant (S) partly or totally with a step calcination procedure<br>
and optionally the template (R) if it was not removed in step a), whereby a<br>
mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with a zeolite catalyst is obtained.<br>
In step a) the zeolite nuclei are prepared from a silicon source and an aluminium<br>
source and structure directing agent (template R). The silicon source is selected from<br>
silicon oxides, preferably from colloidal silica, solid silica and fumed silica.<br>
The aluminium source is selected from aluminium sulphate (Al2(SO4)3.18H2O),<br>
hydrated aluminium hydroxides, aluminates, aluminium isoproxide and alumina.<br>
A suitable template is selected in order to obtain the desired zeolite structure.<br>
Examples of typically used templates are alkyl ammonium hydroxides, alkyl<br>
ammonium halogenides, alkyl amine hydroxide and alkyl amine halogenides like<br>
tetrapropylammonium bromide, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, tetramethyl-<br>
ammonium bromide, tetraethylammonium bromide, tetraethylammonium hydroxide,<br>
piperidine, pyrrolidine, octylamine, ethylenediamine, 1,6-diaminohexane and<br>
hexamethyleneimine.<br>
The temperature in step a) is between 40 - 200 °C and the preparation can take place<br>
in static or in dynamic mode. Finally, in step a) the template is optionally removed by<br>
a thermal treatment procedure known as step calcination procedure. The temperature<br><br>
of the treatment is in the range of 350 - 900 °C removed. The template may<br>
alternatively be removed in step i) if it was not removed in step a) but preferably the<br>
template is removed in step a).<br>
in step b) the mesoporous molecular sieve gel is prepared from silicon sources,<br>
optional aluminium sources, and surfactant (S). The silicon sources are selected from<br>
silicon compounds having an organic group and from inorganic silicon sources.<br>
Those silicon sources having an organic group are tetraethoxy silane (TEOS),<br>
tetramethylarnmonium silicate, tetraethylammonium silicate etc. The inorganic<br>
silicon sources are sodium silicate, water glass, colloidial silica, solid silica and<br>
fumed silica. The aluminium source is selected from aluminium sulphate<br>
(Al2(SO4)3.18H2O), hydrated aluminium hydroxides, aluminates, aluminium<br>
isoproxide and alumina. The surfactant is selected in order to obtain the desired<br>
mesoporous phases. Suitable surfactants used are alkyltrimethyl ammonium halide<br>
compounds with the general formula CnH2n+1 (CH3)3NX, where n = 12 to 18, X= CI,<br>
Br. Preferably the surfactant is selected from the group consisting of n-<br>
hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide, n-hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium chloride,<br>
cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide and cetyltriethylammonium bromide. The<br>
temperature in step b) ranges between 20 and 100 °C and the preparation takes place<br>
under stirring.<br>
In step c) the zeolite nuclei or the silicate or aluminosilicate precursor prepared in<br>
step a) are introduced to the molecular sieve gel under stirring. The formed mixture is<br>
homogenised and the zeolite nuclei or the silicate or aluminosilicate precursor are<br>
dispersed. For adjusting the acidity of the product, additional aluminium source may<br>
be added. This additional aluminium source is an aluminium source having an<br>
organic ligand selected from aluminium alkoxides, preferably aluminium<br>
isopropoxide. The stirring rate in step c) ranges between 50 and 1000 rpm. The<br>
treatment time is between 10 - 500 minutes.<br><br>
In step d) the gel is ripened under stirring. The stirring rate is 200 - 1000 rpm and the<br>
time of the gel ripening is between 30 - 1800 minutes.<br>
In step e) the hydrothermal synthesis is performed at a temperature between 100-200<br>
°C. The time for the hydrothermal synthesis can vary between 10 h - 300 h depending<br>
the material desired. The hydrothermal synthesis is performed in dynamic mode<br>
under continuous stirring of the mixture until crystals are formed.<br>
In step f) the crystals from step e) are recovered, for example by filtration or by<br>
another method known to be state of the art. If necessary, the pH of the mixture is<br>
adjusted to 6 - 8 before the recovery, such as filtration.<br>
-In-step-g.)-the-solid-product obtained in step f) is thoroughly washed using for<br>
example water as the washing liquid. The temperature 'of the water is from room<br>
temperature to 60 °C. The washing is finished when all undesired, soluble materials<br>
are removed from the solid product.<br>
In step h) the solid product is dried for removal of solvent by the methods known to<br>
be state of art.<br>
In step i) the surfactant (S) is partly or totally removed by a thermal treatment<br>
procedure known as step calcination procedure. The templetate (R) may optionally be<br>
removed in step i) simultaneously with the removal of the surfactant. The temperature<br>
of the treatment is in the range of 350 - 900 °C. The heating rate ranges between 0.2<br>
and 10 °C/min. The atmosphere in the treatment is oxidising and in the final step the<br>
material is typically treated in air. A mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with a<br>
zeolite catalyst is obtained.<br><br>
In the manufacturing method a gel solution is prepared of the mesoporous molecular<br>
sieve, then the zeolite nucleating agent is added at suitable synthesis conditions and<br>
an aluminium source is substituted with zeolite nucleating agent. Suitably the<br>
aluminium source is an aluminium alkoxide and preferably aluminium isopropoxide.<br>
Preferably the surfactant is n-hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, n-<br>
hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium chloride, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide or<br>
cetyltriethylammonium bromide.<br>
Preferably distilled water or deionized water is used as a solvent and in washing of<br>
the material.<br>
Zeolite nuclei are aluminosilicate precursors free of structure directing agents, and<br>
they may be partially or fully crystalline. Because of the variation in crystal size they<br>
may be or may not be detected by XRD. However, their morphology can be observed<br>
by scanning electron microscopy. The zeolite nuclei have a meta-stable phase, which<br>
in the presence of a surfactant, during the synthesis of the catalytic material according<br>
to the invention accomplishes chemical bonding with the walls of the mesoporous<br>
molecular sieve.<br>
After the intensive dispersion of the aluminosilicate nuclei to the mesoporous<br>
molecular sieve gel solution, in the presence of a surfactant and during the gel<br>
ripening period, a nuclei-surfactant mesophase complex is formed, which strengthens<br>
and enhances the chemical bonding and crystallinity of the walls of the mesoporous<br>
material.<br>
The aluminosilicate precursor for the zeolite nuclei can be prepared for zeolite<br>
structure types such as MFI, BEA, TON, MOR, MWW, AEF and FAU from known<br>
state of the art (EP 23089, US Patent 3308069, EP 102716, EP 23089). Two<br><br>
examples of the preparation of aluminosilicate precursors for zeolite nuclei of<br>
structures MFI and BEA are given here. It is however obvious that the other<br>
mentioned zeolites are equally suitable.<br>
The zeolite nuclei, prepared from an aluminosilicate precursor, are suitably used in<br>
the gel preparation. During the gel ripening period chemical interactions and bonding<br>
via process of nucleation take place. Gel ripening accelerates the nucleation process<br>
and secondary nucleation may also occur on the zeolite nuclei forming thereby a<br>
complex "zeolite nuclei-surfactant mesophase", which enhances the chemical nature<br>
of bonding between the micro and mesophases. Microphases are responsible for the<br>
formation of the zeolite structure, and mesophases for the formation of the<br>
mesoporous structure.<br>
Formation of "zeolite nuclei-surfactant mesophase" is favoured when the zeolite<br>
nuclei is introduced after the addition of the surfactant in alkaline media or soaking<br>
the zeolite nuclei in an aqueous solution of the surfactant prior to its addition,<br>
followed by gel ripening period.<br>
The order of introducing the reagents, specially the surfactant and zeolite nuclei, pre-<br>
treatment of the zeolite nuclei and gel ripening process are important for the creation<br>
of the chemical nature of bonding between the microporous and mesoporous<br>
molecular sieve material. In order to obtain the high acidity novel mesoporous<br>
molecular sieve embedded with a zeolite materials, an aluminium source is<br>
introduced after the addition of zeolite nuclei but prior to gel ripening period.<br>
Vigorous stirring after introducing of the zeolite nuclei during the gel preparation is<br>
significant in order to increase the homogenity and dispersion of zeolite nuclei in the<br>
gel solution.<br><br>
The obtained catalytic materials may optionally be transformed to the corresponding<br>
proton forms via ammonium ion-exchange and calcination. A suitable source material<br>
for ammonium ion-exchange is an ammonium salt like ammonium nitrate or<br>
ammmonium chloride. The catalytic materials are treated in an aqueous solution of<br>
the ammonium salt at temperatures between 25 - 80 °C for a suitable time interval<br>
like 1 to 6 hours. The ammonium cations replace the alkali or alkaline cations of the<br>
materials during the treatment. The degree of the ion-exchange can be varied by<br>
changing the time of the treatment, concentration of ammonium solution and<br>
temperature. After the ion-exchange treatment, the obtained material is dried and<br>
calcined for decomposing the ammonium ions to proton and ammonia.<br>
Modifications of catalytic material according to the invention, the novel mesoporous<br>
molecular sieve embedded with a zeolite, can be carrier out by methods selected from<br>
a group consisting of precipitation, deposition, encapsulation, and selective removal.<br>
Both impregnation and ion exchange are deposition methods. In impregnation, the<br>
deposition is carried out from liquid phase and adsorption, ion exchange and selective<br>
reaction may take place on or with the surface of the support. During the removal of<br>
the liquid, crystallites rather than monolayers are formed on the surfaces. In ion<br>
exchange diluted solutions are used, and the desired metal cation is exchanged from<br>
the solution to the material replacing the cation or proton of the solid material. The<br>
procedures and choice of method for modification depend on the target reactions.<br>
Generally, ion exchange method is preferred when lower loading and higher<br>
dispersion of metal is needed.<br>
The removal of surfactant after the completion of the synthesis is necessary to obtain<br>
the mesoprous molecular sieves embedded with a zeolite with high surface area and<br>
acidity. The calcination temperature, heating rate and duration may influence the<br>
surface area, pore size distribution and location of aluminium in the framework. Very<br>
large surface area, determined by nitrogen adsorption and varying strong acidity,<br><br>
determined by TPD of ammonia, of the synthesized novel mesoporous molecular<br>
sieve embedded with a zeolite confirms that the step calcination procedure is a very<br>
suitable method for surfactant removal.<br>
The removal of template from the mesoporous molecular sieves embedded with a<br>
zeolite is also performed by step calcination procedure.<br>
The synthesis of the mesoporous material may be carried out with or without<br>
additional aluminium sources. Only one template is needed in the synthesis of the<br>
catalytic material.<br>
The catalytic material may be incorporated in or on a carrier using any methods<br>
known in the art.<br>
The method of synthesis results in increased crystallinity of the pore walls by<br>
chemically bonding the zeolite material in the mesoporous material and thereby<br>
introducing the desired zeolite properties and simultaneously maintaining the<br>
mesoporous structure intact. In this method only one type of template in the gel<br>
solution for the synthesis of the product is needed.<br>
Small crystals of a zeolite are used as "nuclei" in the synthesis of the mesoporous<br>
material and it is possible to vary the concentration of the "nuclei" and the size of the<br>
zeolite crystals. This results in the increase of the concentration of zeolite nuclei and<br>
in embedding of large amount of the microporous structure in the mesoporous<br>
molecular sieve and increased crystallinity of the mesoporous wall. It also influences<br>
the thermal and hydrothermal stability and acidic properties of the material. Variation<br>
in the size of the zeolite nuclei may influence the shape selective property of the<br>
material.<br><br>
The X-ray powder diffraction patterns, scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen<br>
adsorption characterization results confirm the high thermal and hydrothermal<br>
stability of the mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with a zeolite according to the<br>
invention, such as MFI, BEA, MWW and MOR. structures.<br>
Further, the complete or almost complete regeneration of the used catalysts from<br>
different hydrocarbon conversion reactions, like n-butane and 1 -butene isomerization<br>
and 1-decene oligomerization, and retaining of the catalytic activities also indicates<br>
the stability of catalytic material.<br>
The manufacturing method makes it possible to design intrinsic acidic properties in<br>
the mesoporous molecular sieve. The intrinsic acidic properties of the mesoporous<br>
molecular sieve materials can be designed using a source of aluminium and varying<br>
the Si/Al ratio of the gel solution and different zeolite nuclei. Characterization results<br>
of H-MM5, H-MMBE and H-MMMW catalysts by TPD of ammonia and different<br>
test reactions like n-butane isomerization confirm the success in designing these<br>
materials exhibiting varying acidities.<br>
The pore walls of the mesoporous material are amorphous in MCM-41, but with the<br>
introduction of zeolite they exhibit increased crystallinity. The zeolite unit cell in the<br>
product according to the invention is different from the one in a mechanical mixture<br>
of a zeolite and a mesoporous molecular sieve, and the mesoporous molecular sieve<br>
unit cell is larger than that in a mechanical mixture.<br>
A further essential feature of the product is that the majority of the zeolite phase is<br>
chemically bonded to the mesoporous molecular sieve. The product is thermally<br>
stable at a temperature of at least 900°C in the presence of air.<br><br>
The mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with a zeolite according to the invention<br>
and the method for the manufacture of such material are significantly different from<br>
the ones disclosed in the state of the art and exhibit several advantages.<br>
The new MM5 mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with MFI structure is<br>
thermally stable up to at least 1000 °C and MMBE to at least 900 °C, as can be seen<br>
from XRD and SEM figures and surface area measurements.<br>
The transformation of the cationic forms of MM5, MMBE, MMMW and MMMO,<br>
such as the Na-forms presented in the examples, to the corresponding proton forms of<br>
MM5, MMBE, MMMW and MMMO by ion-exchange with aqueous solution of<br>
ammonium nitrate, followed by drying at 100 °C and calcination at 500 °C did not change the structure as was. shown by XRD patterns, indicating the hydrothermal<br>
stability of the novel material. It is known that the structure of MCM-41 collapses<br>
after bringing it in contact with water at high temperatures.<br>
Metal modifications of MM5, MMBE, MMMW and MMMO, such as noble metal<br>
modifications and particularly platinum modifications of the examples, manufactured<br>
using aqueous solutions of hexachloroplatinic acid at 80 °C for 24 hours, followed by<br>
drying at 100 °C and calcination at 450 °C did not influence the structures of MM5<br>
and MMBE as shown by XRD patterns. This indicates that the material is stable in an<br>
acidic medium.<br>
The proton form of the mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with MFI structure<br>
showed very high activity in n-butane and 1-butene isomerization reactions. The H-<br>
MM5 catalysts showed an increase in n-butane conversion with an increase in the<br>
acidity.<br><br>
The proton forms of the mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with MFI and BEA<br>
structures showed very high activity in the dimerization of 1-olefins. The H-MM5<br>
and H-MMBE catalysts showed an increase in 1-decene conversion, with an increase<br>
in the acidity. The proton form of the mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with<br>
MFI structure showed very high activity in the dimerization of isobutene and the<br>
catalyst was not deactivated.<br>
The H-MM5 and H-MMBE catalytic materials were fully regenerated in presence of<br>
air. The regenerated materials showed almost the same catalytic activity in n-butane<br>
and 1-butene isomerization and 1-decene oligomerization as the fresh catalyst. It is<br>
well known that one of the major problems of MCM-41 catalyst is the regeneration<br>
i.e. the mesoporous structure collapses after regeneration. The retaining of the<br>
 catalytic activity in the new mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with a zeolite<br>
materials in both the reactions unequivocally shows that the structure after the<br>
regeneration is stable.<br>
Pt-MM5 showed very high conversion in n-butane isomerization and the catalytic<br>
material after regeneration retained its catalytic activity.<br>
Pt-MMBE showed a high selectivity to ring opening products.<br>
Thus post-synthesis modification is not needed for the MM5 and MMBE mesoporous<br>
materials to increase the thermal and hydrothermal stability. The high thermal and<br>
hydrothermal stability of the novel materials are attributed to embedding of the<br>
 zeolite, such as MFI and BEA structure to the walls of mesoporous molecular sieves<br>
by using method as described above.<br>
This new group of mesoporous materials can be applied as catalysts in dimerization<br>
of olefins, oligomerization of olefins, isomerization of olefins, cracking of<br><br>
hydrocarbons, alkylation of aromatics, aromatization of light hydrocarbons,<br>
etherification, dehydration and ring opening reactions without further modifications<br>
of the active material. The metal modified material showed a high activity in the<br>
isomerization of light paraffins. Similarly, the metal modified materials may also be<br>
active in the isomorization of long chain paraffins, hydrogenation, hydrocracking,<br>
hydrodesulfurization, hydrodeoxygenation, hydrodenitrogenation, dehydrogenarion,<br>
reforming, Fisher-Tropsch and oxidation reactions when modified using the manners<br>
known to be state of art. The metal in the catalyst can be in metallic, oxide or in<br>
sulfide form or in any other form when modified with the manner known to be state<br>
of art.<br>
The material according to the invention can also be utilised in various separation<br>
techniques like in adsorption, absorption or in selective removal.<br>
The following illustrative examples provide better understanding of the invention and<br>
its practical embodiments, however it is evident to a man skilled in the art that the<br>
scope of the invention is not limited to these examples in any way.<br>

nature of the interaction in the mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with MFI<br>
structure according to the inveation, formation of strong Branstod acid sites and<br>
hydrothermal stability of novel material. n-Butane isomerization was used as a test<br>
reaction for the evaluation of acidity of catalysts. n-Butane isomerization was carried<br>
out over the proton form of the novel mesoporous molecular sieve catalysts to<br>
evaluate the acidic properties. It was observed that the H-form (H-MM5-96h~4ZS-<br>
2AI-35) catalyst with lowest Si/Al ratio showed highest conversion of n-butane,<br>
clearly indicating the formation of strong Bronstedt acid sites and formation of a<br>

The regeneration of the H-form and Pt-H-MM5 catalysts was carried out in presence<br>
of air at 450 °C for two hours. The purpose of the regeneration was to evaluate<br>
whether it was possible to regain the catalytic activity, further more also to evaluate<br>
" the" hy drothermal" stability of the catalyst during the regeneration of the-catalyst-since<br>
water is produced during the regeneration process. It was verified that both the H-<br>
form and Pt modified catalysts almost completely retained their catalytic activity,<br>
confirming hydrothermal stability of the structure.<br><br>

1-butene isomerization was also used as a test reaction for the investigation of<br>
isomerization of 1-butene to iso-butene. Further more the aim was to study the<br><br>
possibilityof regeneration of used catalyst, and to evaluate if the catalyst retains its<br>
catalytic activity after regeneration. It was found that the used catalyst, after the 1-<br>
butene isomerization could be regenerated. Further more the regenerated catalyst<br>
exhibited almost the same conversion (97.2 mol %) of 1-butene as the corresponding<br>
fresh catalyst (97 mol %), indicating also the hydrothermal stability of the catalyst.<br>
The isomerization of 1-butene to isobutene was investigated over proton form H-<br>
MM5-96h-4ZS-2AI catalyst in a fixed-bed micro-reactor made of quartz. The<br>
experiments were carried out near atmospheric pressure at a temperature of 350 °C<br>
with WHSV 10 h-1. The reactant 1-butene was fed into the reactor using nitrogen as a<br>
carrier gas with a ratio 1:1. The product analysis was carried out on-line using a gas<br>
chromatograph equipped with a FT detector and a capillary column. A condenser was<br>
placed after the GC in order to facilitate liquid product sampling of the heavier<br>
compounds. The first sample was taken after 10 minutes on stream (TOS). The first<br>
10 samples were taken at 1 h intervals and the subsequent samples every 3 h.<br>
