protecting groups for an amino, alkylamino or imino group may be a formyl, acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, ethoxycarbonyl, tert.-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, benzyl, methoxybenzyl or 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl group and additionally, for the amino group, a phthalyl group.<br>
Any protecting group used is optionally subsequently cleaved for example by hydrolysis in an aqueous solvent, e.g. in water, isopropanol/water, acetic acid/water, tetrahydrofuran/water or dioxan/water, in the presence of an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid or in the presence of an alkali metal base such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide or aprotically, e.g. in the presence of iodotrimethylsilane, at temperatures between 0 and 120°C, preferably at temperatures between 10 and 100°C.<br><br>
However, a benzyl, methoxybenzyl or benzyloxycarbonyl group is cleaved, for example hydrogenolytically, e.g. with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium/charcoal in a suitable solvent such as methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate or glacial acetic acid, optionally with the addition of an acid such as hydrochloric acid at temperatures between 0 and 100°C, but preferably at temperatures between 20 and 60°C, and at a hydrogen pressure of 1 to 7 bar, but preferably 3 to 5 bar. A 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl group, however, is preferably cleaved in trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of anisole.<br>
A tert.butyl or tert.butyloxycarbonyl group is preferably cleaved by treating with an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid or hydrochloric acid or by treating with iodotrimethylsilane optionally using a solvent such as methylene chloride, dioxan, methanol or diethyl ether.<br>
A trifluoroacetyl group is preferably cleaved by treating with an acid such as hydrochloric acid, optionally in the presence of a solvent such as acetic acid at temperatures between 50 and 120°C or by treating with sodium hydroxide solution optionally in the presence of a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at tempe¬ratures between 0 and 50°C.<br>
A phthalyl group is preferably cleaved in the presence of hydrazine or a primary amine such as methylamine, ethylamine or n-butylamine in a solvent such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, toluene/water or dioxan at temperatures between 2 0 and 50°C.<br>
A single alkyl group may be cleaved from an O,O'-dialkylphos-phono group with sodium iodide, for example, in a solvent such as acetone, methylethylketone, acetonitrile or dimethylform-amide at temperatures between 40 and 150°C, but preferably at temperatures between 60 and 100°C.<br><br>
Both alkyl groups may be cleaved from an 0,0'-dialkyl-phos-phono group with iodotrimethylsilane, bromotrimethylsilane or chlorotrimethylsilane/sodium iodide, for example, in a solvent such as methyl chloride, chloroform or acetonitrile at tempe¬ratures between 0°C and the boiling temperature of the reac¬tion mixture, but preferably at temperatures between 20 and 60°C.<br>
Moreover, the compounds of general formula I obtained may be resolved into their, enantiomers and/or diastereomers, as mentioned hereinbefore. Thus, for example, cis/trans mixtures may be resolved into their cis and trans isomers, and compounds with at least one optically active carbon atom may be separated into their enantiomers.<br>
Thus, for example, the cis/trans mixtures may be resolved by chromatography into the cis and trans isomers thereof, the compounds of general formula I obtained which occur as racemates may be separated by methods known per se (cf.<br>
Allinger N. L. and Eliel E. L. in "Topics in Stereochemistry", Vol. 6, Wiley Interscience, 1971) into their optical antipodes and compounds of general formula I with at least 2 asymmetric carbon atoms may be resolved into their diastereomers on the basis of their physical-chemical differences using methods known per se,   e.g. by chromatography and/or fractional<br>
crystallisation, and, if these compounds are obtained in racemic form, they may subsequently be resolved into the enantiomers as mentioned above.<br>
The enantiomers are preferably separated by column separation on chiral phases or by recrystallisation from an optically active solvent or by reacting with an optically active substance which forms salts or derivatives such as e.g. esters or amides with the racemic compound, particularly acids and the activated derivatives or alcohols thereof, and separating the diastereomeric mixture of salts or derivatives thus obtained, e.g. on the basis of their differences in solubility, whilst<br><br><br>
the free antipodes may be released from the pure diastereomeric salts or derivatives by the action of suitable agents. Optically active acids in common use are e.g. the D- and L-forms of tartaric acid or dibenzoyltartaric acid, di-o-tolyltartaric acid, malic acid, mandelic acid, camphorsulphonic acid, glutamic acid, aspartic acid or quinic acid. An optically active alcohol may be for example (+) or (-)-menthol and an optically active acyl group in amides, for example, may be a (+)-or (-)-menthyloxycarbonyl.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of formula I may be converted into the salts thereof, particularly for pharmaceutical use into the physiologically acceptable salts with inorganic or organic acids. Acids which may be used for this purpose include for example hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid or maleic acid.<br>
Moreover, if the new compounds of formula I thus obtained con¬tain a carboxy, hydroxyphosphoryl, sulpho or 5-tetrazolyl group, they may subsequently, if desired, be converted into the salts thereof with inorganic or organic bases, particularly for pharmaceutical use into the physiologically acceptable salts thereof. Suitable bases for this purpose include for example sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, arginine, cyclohexyl-amine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine and triethanolamine.<br>
The compounds of general formulae II to V used as starting materials are known from the literature in some cases or may be obtained by methods known from the literature (cf. Examples I to VII).<br>
For example, a starting compound of general formula I is ob¬tained by reacting a 7-fluoro-6-nitro compound correspondingly substituted in the 4 position with a corresponding alkoxide and subsequently reducing the nitro compound thus obtained or<br><br><br>
a starting compound of general formula IV is obtained by reac¬ting a 7-fluoro-6-nitro compound correspondingly substituted in the 4 position with a corresponding alkoxide, subsequently reducing the nitro compound thus obtained and then acylating with a corresponding compound.<br>
As already mentioned hereinbefore, the compounds of general formula I according to the invention and the physiologically acceptable salts thereof have valuable pharmacological pro¬perties, particularly an inhibiting effect on signal trans¬duction mediated by the Epidermal Growth Factor receptor (EGF-R), whilst this may be achieved for example by inhibiting ligand bonding, receptor dimerisation or tyrosine kinase it¬self. It is also possible to block the transmission of signals to components located further down.<br>
The biological properties of the new compounds were investi¬gated as follows:<br>
The inhibition of the EGF-R-mediated signal transmission can be demonstrated e.g. with cells which express human EGF-R and whose survival and proliferation depend on stimulation by EGF or TGF-alpha.  A cell line of murine origin dependent on in-terleukin-3-(IL-3) which was genetically modified to express functional human EGF-R was used here. The proliferation of these cells known as F/L-HERc can therefore be stimulated either by murine IL-3 or by EGF (cf. von Riiden, T. et al. in EMBO J. 2, 2749-2756 (1988) and Pierce, J. H. et al. in Scien¬ce 23d, 628-631 (1988)).<br>
The starting material used for the F/L-HERc cells was the cell line FDC-P1, the production of which has been described by Dexter, T. M. et al. in J. Exp. Med. 152 1036-1047 (1980). Alternatively, however, other growth-factor-dependent cells may also be used (cf. for example Pierce, J. H. et al. in Science 219, 628-631 (1988), Shibuya, H. et al. in Cell 70, 57-67 (1992) and Alexander, W. S. et al. in EMBO J. 1SX,   3683-<br><br><br>
3691 (1991)). For expressing the human EGF-R cDNA (cf. Ull¬rich, A. et al. in Nature 309-, 418-425 (1984)) recombinant retroviruses were used as described by von Riiden, T. et al. , EMBO J. 1,   2749-2756 (1988), except that the retroviral vector LXSN (cf. Miller, A. D. et al. in BioTechniques 1,   980-990 (1989)) was used for the expression of the EGF-R cDNA and the line GP+E86 (cf. Markowitz, D. et al. in J. Virol. £2, 1120-1124 (1988)) was used as the packaging cell.<br>
The test was performed as follows:<br>
F/L-HERc cells were cultivated in RPMl/1640 medium (Bio¬Whittaker) , supplemented with 10 % foetal calf serum (FCS, Boehringer Mannheim), 2 mM glutamine  (BioWhittaker), standard antibiotics and 20 ng/ml of human EGF (Promega), at 37°C and 5% CO2. In order to investigate the inhibitory activity of the<br>
compounds according to the invention, 1.5 x 104 cells per well were cultivated in triplicate in 96-well dishes in the above medium (200 /zl) , the cell proliferation being stimulated with either EGF (20 ng/ml) or murine IL-3. The IL-3 used was obtai¬ned from culture supernatants of the cell line X63/0 mIL-3 (cf. Karasuyama, H. et al. in Eur. J. Immunol. 18., 97-104 (1988)). The compounds according to the invention were dis¬solved in 100% dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and added to the cul¬tures in various dilutions, the maximum DMSO concentration being 1%. The cultures were incubated for 48 hours at 37°C.<br>
In order to determine the inhibitory activity of the compounds according to the invention the relative cell number was mea¬sured in O.D. units using the Cell Titer 96™ AQueous Non-Ra¬dioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega). The relative cell number was calculated as a percentage of the control (F/LHERc cells without inhibitor) and the concentration of active substance which inhibits the proliferation of the cells by 50% (IC50) was derived therefrom. The following results were obtained:<br><br><br><br><br>

The compounds of general formula I according to the invention thus inhibit signal transduction by tyrosine kinases, as de¬monstrated by the example of the human EGF receptor, and are therefore useful for treating pathophysiological processes caused by hyperfunction of tyrosine kinases. These are e.g. benign or malignant tumours, particularly tumours of epithe¬lial and neuroepithelial origin, metastasisation and the ab¬normal proliferation of vascular endothelial cells (neoangio-genesis).<br>
The compounds according to the invention are also useful for preventing and treating diseases of the airways and lungs which are accompanied by increased or altered production of mucus caused by stimulation by tyrosine kinases, e.g. in inflammatory diseases of the airways such as chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive bronchitis, asthma, bronchiectasis, allergic or non-allergic rhinitis or<br>
sinusitis, cystic fibrosis, άl-antitrypsin deficiency, or coughs, pulmonary emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis and hyperreactive airways.<br>
The compounds are also suitable for treating diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and bile duct and gall bladder which are associated with disrupted activity of the tyrosine kinases, such as may be found e.g. in chronic inflammatory changes such as cholecystitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative<br><br><br><br>
colitis, and ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract or such as may occur in diseases of the gastrointestinal tract which are associated with increased secretions, such as Menetrier's disease, secreting adenomas and protein loss syndrome.<br>
In addition, the compounds of general formula I and the physiologically acceptable salts thereof may be used to treat other diseases caused by abnormal function of tyrosine kinases, such as e.g. epidermal hyperproliferation (psoriasis), inflammatory processes, diseases of the immune system, hyperproliferation of haematopoietic cells, etc.<br>
By reason of their biological properties the compounds according to the invention may be used on their own or in conjunction with other pharmacologically active compounds, for example in tumour therapy, in monotherapy or in conjunction with other anti-tumour therapeutic agents, for example in combination with topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g. etoposide), mitosis inhibitors (e.g. vinblastine), compounds which interact with nucleic acids (e.g. cis-platin, cyclophosphamide, adriamycin), hormone antagonists (e.g. tamoxifen), inhibitors of metabolic processes (e.g. 5-FU etc.), cytokines (e.g. interferons), antibodies, etc. For treating respiratory tract diseases, these compounds may be used on their own or in conjunction with other therapeutic agents for the airways, such as substances with a secretolytic, broncholytic and/or antiinflammatory activity. For treating diseases in the region of the gastrointestinal tract, these compounds may also be administered on their own or in conjunction with substances having an effect on motility or secretion. These combinations may be administered either simultaneously or sequentially.<br>
These compounds may be administered either on their own or in conjunction with other active substances by intravenous, sub¬cutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or intranasal route, by inhalation or transdermally or orally, whilst aerosol for¬mulations are particularly suitable for inhalation.<br><br><br>
For pharmaceutical use the compounds according to the invention are generally used for warm-blooded vertebrates, particularly humans, in doses of 0.01-100 mg/kg of body weight, preferably 0.1-15 mg/kg. For administration they are formulated with one or more conventional inert carriers and/or diluents, e.g. with corn starch, lactose, glucose, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, citric acid, tartaric acid, water, water/ethanol, water/glycerol, water/sorbitol, water/polyethylene -glycol, propylene glycol, stearyl alcohol, carboxymethylcellulose or fatty substances such as hard fat or suitable mixtures thereof in conventional galenic preparations such as plain or coated tablets, capsules, powders, suspen¬sions, solutions, sprays or suppositories.<br>
