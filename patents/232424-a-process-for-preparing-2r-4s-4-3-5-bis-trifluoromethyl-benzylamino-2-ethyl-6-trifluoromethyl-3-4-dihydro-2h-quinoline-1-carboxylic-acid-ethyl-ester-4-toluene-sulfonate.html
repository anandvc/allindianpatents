				<td>This invention relates to a process for preparing (-)-(2R,4S)-4-(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-benzylamino)-2-ethyl-6-trifluoromethyl-3, -4-dihydro-2H-quinoline-l-carboxylic acid ethyl ester, 4-toluene-sulfonate which are cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors.<br>
Atherosclerosis and its associated coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of mortality in the industrialized world. Despite attempts to modify secondary risk factors (smoking, obesity, lack of exercise) and treatment of dyslipidemia with dietary modification and drug therapy, coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the most common cause of death in the U.S., where cardiovascular disease accounts for 44% of all deaths, with 53% of these associated with atherosclerotic coronary heart disease.<br>
Risk for development of this condition has been shown to be strongly correlated with certain plasma lipid levels. While elevated LDL-cholesterol may be the most recognized form of dyslipidemia, it is by no means the only significant lipid associated contributor to CHD. Low HDL-C is also a known risk factor for CHD (Gordon, D.J., et al.,: "High density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Cardiovascular Disease", Circulation, (1989), 79: 8-15.<br>
High LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels are positively correlated, while high levels of HDL-cholesterol are negatively correlated with the risk for developing cardiovascular diseases. Thus, dyslipidemia is not a unitary risk profile for CHD but may be comprised of one or more lipid aberrations.<br>
Among the many factors controlling plasma levels of these disease dependent principles, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity affects all three. The role of this 70,000 dalton plasma glycoprotein found in a number of animal species, including humans, is to transfer cholesteryl ester and triglyceride between lipoprotein particles, including high density lipoproteins (HDL), low density lipoproteins (LDL), very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and chylomicrons. The net result of CETP activity is a lowering of HDL cholesterol and an increase in LDL cholesterol. This effect on lipoprotein profile is believed to be pro-atherogenic, especially in subjects whose lipid profile constitutes an increased risk for CHD.<br>
No wholly satisfactory HDL-elevating therapies exist. Niacin can significantly increase HDL, but has serious toleration issues which reduce compliance. Fibrates and the HMG    CoA    reductase     inhibitors    raise    HDL-C    only   modestly.  As    a    result,   there<br>
is a significant unmet medical need for a well-tolerated agent which can significantly elevate plasma HDL levels, thereby reversing or slowing the progression of atherosclerosis.<br>
Commonly assigned U.S. application ser. No. 09/391,152 filed September 7, .1999 entitled 4-CARBOXYAMINO-2-SUBSTITUTED-1,2,3,4-TETRAHYDROQUINOLINES, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, is directed to compounds of the following general formula:<br>

Specifically, the compound [2R.4S] 4-[(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-benzyl)-methoxycarbonyl-amino]-2-ethyi-6-trifluoromethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-quinoline-1-carboxylic acid ethyl ester is described. A process for making this compound is also described in Example 7.<br>
Thus, although there are a variety of anti-atherosclerosis therapies, there is a continuing need and a continuing search in this field of art for compounds for the treatment of atherosclerosis, and accordingly methods for making such compounds.<br>

In contrast to the process described in Example 7 of U.S. application No. 09/391,152, the four intermediates II, V, VI and VII are easily isolated and purified as crystalline material. The formation of III produces a purer product since the reaction is performed with pure starting material II. The resolution via a classical diastereomeric salt formation is much easier to scale than the use of chiral chromatography. Further crystallization of final products (e.g., the anhydrous form, the ethanolate form) is facilitated by the high purity of the formula VII compound.<br>
As used herein the term mammals is meant to refer to all mammals which contain CETP in their plasma, for example, rabbits and primates such as monkeys and humans. Certain other mammals e.g., dogs, cats, cattle, goats, sheep and horses do not contain CETP in their plasma and so are not included herein.<br>
The term ethanolate refers to an ethanol of solvation.<br>
By "pharmaceutically acceptable" it is meant the carrier, vehicle, diluent, excipients, and/or salt must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation, and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.<br>
As used herein, the expressions "reaction-inert solvent" and "inert solvent" refers to a solvent or mixture of solvents which does not interact with starting materials, reagents, intermediates or products in a manner which adversely affects the yield of the desired product.<br>

Certain processes for the manufacture of the compound of this invention are provided as further features of the invention and are described below including in the experimental section.<br>
SCHEME<br>
(Scheme Removed)  <br>
According to the above Scheme, the formula II amine may be prepared by combining benzotriazole, 4-(trifluoromethyl)aniline (I) and propionaldehyde in a nonpolar solvent such as toluene at ambient temperature (about 20 °C to about 30°C for about 0.5 to about 3 hours.<br>
The formula III ester may be prepared by combining vinyl-carbamic acid R1 ester (wherein R1 is benzyl, t-butyl or (C1-C4)alkyl), the formula II amine and p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate in an inert solvent such as toluene at elevated temperature (about 50 °C to about 90°C) for about 0 5 to about 3 hours   Preferably, R1 is benzyl<br>
The formula IV compound may be prepared by combining the formula III ester, ethyl chloroformate and an amine base such as pyridine in an inert, nonnucleophihc solvent such as dry dichloromethane resulting in an exothermic reaction.<br>
The formula V compound may be prepared by treating the product of the preceding reaction with ammonium formate, palladium on carbon in a polar, protic solvent such as methanol at a temperature of about 35°C to about 60°C for about 0 5 hour to about 3 hours<br>
The reaction sequence proceeds via preparation of a classical diastereomenc salt formation by combining 4-amino-2:ethyl-6-tnfluoromethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-quinoline-1-carboxylic acid ethyl ester and (-) dibenzoyl-L-tartanc acid (anhydrous) followed by the addition of an alcoholic solvent such as ethanol at a temperature of ambient (e.g., about 20°C to about 30°C) for about 1 to about 24 hours to form the (-)dibenzoyl-L-tartaric acid salt thereof. Alternatively, (-) di-p-toluoyl-L-tartanc acid may be used in place of the (-)dibenzoyl-L-tartanc acid.<br>
The formula VII compound may be prepared by treating the formula VI salt, 1,2-dichloroethane and an aqueous base such as sodium hydroxide with 3,5-bis(tnfluoromethyl)benzaldehyde followed by the addition of sodium tnacetoxyborohydndeat ambient temperature (e.g., about 20°C to about 30°C) for aboui 1 hour to about 24 hours.   Subsequently 4-toiuenesulfonic acid monohydrate is added at ambient temperature (e.g., about 20°C to about 30°C)<br>
The formula VIII compound may be prepared by combining (-)-(2R,4S)-4-(3,5-bis-tnfluoromethyl-benzylamino)-2-ethyl-6-trifluoromethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-quinoline-1-carboxylic acid ethyl ester and sodium carbonate in tetrahydrofuran at<br>
ambient temperature (e.g., about 20°C to about 25°C) in the presence of methyl chloroformate. An ethanolate crystalline form of the above compound may be prepared from the amorphous compound by recrystallization from ethanol/water at a temperature of about 20°C to about 25°C, preferably ambient temperature for about 0.5 hour to about 18 hours.. Typically the range is about 3% to about 10% ethanol and about 90% to about 97% water. Preferably the ratio is about 10% to about 90% ethanol/water.<br>
Alternatively, the ethanolate crystalline form may be prepared utilizing procedures analogous to those described above but using ethanol alone. The filtered materials are typically granulated for about 2 hours to about 24 hours followed by air drying.<br>
The amorphous form of the compound [2R.4S] 4-[(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-benzyl)-methoxycarbonyl-amino]-2-ethyl-6-trifluoromethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-quinoline-1-carboxylic acid ethyl ester is prepared as described in Example 10 herein below.<br>
An anhydrous crystalline form of the above compound may be prepared from the amorphous compound by recrystallization from hexanes (solvent comprised of hexane isomers (e.g., n-hexane, cyclohexane, methyl pentane, etc.)) at a temperature of about 40°C to about 80°C, preferably 60° followed typically by granulating the filtered material for about 2 to about 24 hours and subsequent air drying.<br>
Alternatively, the anhydrous crystal may be prepared from the ethanolate crystalline form (described below) utilizing analogous procedures to the immediately preceding procedure. In addition, the yield in this procedure may be enhanced by azeotroping the ethanol from the hexanes.<br>
It is noted that as the anhydrous and ethanolate crystals are of different energy levels seeding with either anhydrous or ethanolate may determine the resulting isolated crystalline form. As is known in the art the presence of seed crystals in the air in a lab may be sufficient "seeding." In one embodiment anhydrous crystals may be obtained using hexanes and the resulting anhydrous crystals may be used to seed the production of further anhydrous crystals from ethanol.<br>
A preferred dosage is about 0.1 to 100 mg/kg/day of the compound prepared by the process of this invention, preferably the anhydrous crystals.   An especially preferred dosage is about 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day.<br>
The compound of this invention may be used for the treatment of atherosclerosis, peripheral vascular disease, dyslipidemia, hyperbetalipoproteinemia, hypoalphalipoproteinemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, familial-hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular disorders, angina, ischemia, cardiac ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, reperfusion injury, angioplastic restenosis, hypertension, vascular complications of diabetes, obesity or endotoxemia in a mammal (including a human being either male or female).<br>
The compound of this invention may also be used in combination with a second compound. The second compound may be an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP)/Apo B secretion inhibitor, a PPAR activator, a bile acid reuptake inhibitor, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, a fibrate, niacin, an ion-exchange resin, an antioxidant, an ACAT inhibitor or a bile acid sequestrant.<br>
The dosage of the compound of the instant invention which is administered will generally be varied according to principles well known in the art taking into account the severity of the condition being treated and the route of administration.  In general, the compound will be administered to a warm blooded animal (such as a human, livestock or pet) so that an effective dose, usually a daily dose administered in unitary or divided portions, is received, for example a dose in the range of about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg/day body weight, preferably about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg/day body weight. The above dosages are exemplary of the average case; there can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower doasge ranges are merited, and such deviations are within the scope of this invention.<br>
The compound of the instant invention is orally administrable and is accordingly used in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, vehicle or diluent suitable to oral dosage forms. Suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers include inert solid fillers or diluents and sterile aqueous or organic solutions. The active compound will be present in such pharmaceutical compositions in amounts sufficient to provide the desired dosage amount in the range described herein. Thus, for oral administration the compound may be combined with a suitable solid or liquid carrier, vehicle or diluent to form capsules, tablets, powders, syrups, solutions, suspensions and the like. The pharmaceutical compositions may, if desired, contain additional components such as flavorants, sweeteners, excipients and the like.<br>
The tablets, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin, excipients such as dicalcium phosphate, a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid, a lubricant such as magnesium stearate, and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin    When a dosage unit form is a capsule, for example a gel capsule, it may contain, in addition to or instead of materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty glycende or mixtures of fatty glycendes, such as olive oil, or Migloyl™ or Capmul™ glycendes<br>
Various other materials may be present as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit   For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor<br>
The compound of the instant invention may also be administered parenterally For parenteral administration the compound may be combined with sterile aqueous or organic media to form injectable solutions or suspensions   The injectable solutions prepared in this manner can then be administered intravenously, intrapentoneally subcutaneously, or intramuscularly.<br>
The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy synngability exists   It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi They may be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, by incorporating sterilizing agents into the compositions, or by irradiating or heating the compositions where such irradiating or heating is both appropriate and compatible with the drug formulation<br>
Additional pharmaceutical formulations may include, inter alia, suppositories, sublingual tablets, topical dosage forms and the like and these may be prepared according to methods which are commonly accepted in the art<br>
