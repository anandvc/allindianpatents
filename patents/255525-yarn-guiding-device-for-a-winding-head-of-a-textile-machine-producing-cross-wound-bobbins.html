The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
ENGLISH TRANSLATION VARIFICATION<br>
CERTIFICATE u/r. 20(3)(b)<br>
I, Mr. HIRAL CHANDRAKANT JOSHI, an authorized agent for the applicant, OERLIKON TEXTILE GMBH &amp; CO. KG do hereby verify that the content of English translated complete specification filed in pursuance of PCT International application No. PCT/EP2006/006227 thereof is correct and complete.<br><br><br><br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a winding head of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
It has been known for a long time in conjunction with automatic cross-winding machines to arrange, in the region of the winding heads of these textile machines, devices which improve the drawing off of the thread from the spinning cops. Numerous patents describe devices, for example, which are arranged above a spinning cop positioned in the spinning position and which assist the detachment of the thread from the spinning cop; in other words, devices, which also ensure that the thread tension is kept at a level which is not damaging to the thread during the rewinding process.<br>
A device of this type, also called a thread draw-off accelerator, is described, for example, in DE 44 18 312 Al. This known thread draw-off accelerator has a guide face for the thread, which has the shape of a truncated cone shell, the large diameter facing the spinning cop. The truncated cone shell is penetrated by a truncated pyramid shell such that the edges of the truncated pyramid shell pierce the' truncated cone shell and thus form indentations.<br>
Compared to other known thread draw-off accelerators, these devices have the advantage that the thread balloon which forms when the thread is drawn off overhead from the spinning cop is not destroyed or suppressed but only shaped.<br>
Furthermore, textile machines producing cross-wound bobbins are described in DE 44 06 076 Al and/or DE 42 21 559 Al and in each case have a multi-part, tubular auxiliary unwinding device in the region of their winding heads.<br><br><br>
According to DE 44 06 076 Al, each of these auxiliary unwinding devices consists of three tubular thread guide elements inserted into one another. In other words, a lower guide element which can be lowered over the spinning cop is height-adjustably guided on a central thread guide tube, which is in turn fixed by a clamping means to a further tubular component which is stationarily arranged on an. assembly plate of the winding head. The first tubular thread guide element which is configured in a cone-like manner in the region of its lower edge, is lowered in a defined manner over the spinning cop during the rewinding process by means of an associated drive in such a way that the cone is always positioned in the region of the so-called cops cone of the spinning cop. The central thread guide tube, which is fixed to the upper tubular component by a clamping device, remains during the rewinding process in its installation position which is, for example, matched at the beginning of a new batch to the respective length of the spinning cop to be processed and, on the input side, has a narrow position. A multiple thread balloon is divided by this narrow position, arranged on the input side, of the central thread guide tube,  which is positioned closely above the tube tip of the spinning cop to be rewound.<br>
DE 42 21 559 Al relates to a winding head with a comparable auxiliary unwinding device.<br>
This known auxiliary unwinding device has a first thread guide element which is height-adjustable in a defined manner, can be lowered over the spinning cop and on which a thread guide bell which is also height-adjustably mounted is supported. The thread guide bell is guided on a slide rod between two stops, which determine the maximum adjustment range of the end position, and has, viewed in the thread running direction, a narrow position on the output side. The length of a thread balloon, which, as described above, is adjusted overhead in a spinning cop during the thread draw-off, is also limited in this known device by the situation of the narrow position of the thread guide bell.<br><br><br>
As the end positions of the above-described thread guide elements are continuously in contact with the running thread during the rewinding process because of the rotating thread balloon, these regions are subject to a high degree of wear. In other words, the thread guide elements have to be constantly checked for wear, in particular in the region of their narrow positions, and, if necessary, the thread guide elements have to be exchanged.<br>
Winding machines are known from US-PS 5,494,231, in which a special pneumatically loadable thread receiving device is installed in the region of the winding heads. The thread receiving device is arranged here upstream of the unwinding position of the winding head and has a bell which can be loaded with compressed air and can be lowered over a spinning cop. The bell is in turn connected to an adapter to which a reduced pressure-loadable gripper tube can be connected.<br>
Moreover, an annular balloon breaker is fastened to the bell in the region of a slot which is open toward the unwinding position by stud bolts in such a way that both the spinning cop and also the thread received from the spinning cop can be transferred into the unwinding position of the winding head without problems.<br>
Furthermore, annular balloon rings are known inter alia in conjunction with twisting<br>
machines, which during the production of twist bobbins assist the unwinding of the<br>
feed thread from so-called flanged bobbins. The diameter of these annular balloon<br>
rings fixed on a ring bank of the twisting machine and described, for example, in DE<br>
37 34 467 Al is clearly above the diameter of the flanged bobbins here. As these'<br>
balloon rings are subjected to a not inconsiderable loading by the thread during<br>
operation, the balloon ring has an exchangeable inner ring which is configured as a<br>
wearing part. This means, if necessary, the inner rings of the balloon rings can be<br>
exchanged without the balloon rings having to be laboriously unscrewed from the<br>
ring bank of the twisting machine.<br><br><br>
Proceeding from the winding heads of the type described above, the invention is based on the object of improving winding heads of this type to the effect that, on the * one hand, high winding speeds can be produced, but, on the other hand, worn parts can be replaced without problems and economically.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a winding head as described in claim 1.<br>
Advantageous configurations of the invention are the subject of the sub-claims.<br>
The configuration according to the invention of the winding head in particular has the advantage that not only is there the possibility, owing to the use of a thread guide device with an exchangeable thread guide insert, of operating the winding head at a high winding speed, but, if necessary, there is also the possibility of renewing without problems the component of this thread guide device which is most strongly stressed during the winding operation. In other words, with corresponding wear of the thread guide insert, the latter can easily and very rapidly be exchanged for a corresponding new component.<br>
As described in claim 2, it is provided in an advantageous embodiment that the thread guide insert is non-positively and easily detachably fixed on the thread guide device by means of a magnetic holder. A magnetic holder of this type which, as described in claim 3, preferably has ferromagnetic extensions and permanent magnets arranged in receiving bores, allows a rapid change of the thread guide insert without the use of a tool being necessary here.<br>
According to claims 4 and 5, the thread guide insert in a preferred embodiment is at<br>
least partially produced from a highly wear-resistant material, preferably from a<br>
technical ceramic material. In other words, the thread guide insert consists of a base<br>
body, which is produced economically, for example, by the diecasting or injection<br><br><br>
moulding method from a metal or a plastics material and on which ferromagnetic extensions are arranged for the magnetic holder as well as a highly wear-resistant thread inlet part. This thread inlet part which, as already mentioned above, is preferably manufactured from a technical ceramic material, is non-detachably fastened here to the base body, for example by means of adhesion. A thread guide insert constructed in this manner cannot only be manufactured relatively economically, but is also distinguished by a long service life.<br>
In a first embodiment, described in claim 6, the thread guide insert has an inner width, which corresponds to the inner width of the tubular thread guide device. However, the embodiment shown in claim 10 has proven to be more advantageous, in which the inner width of an eyelet-like opening of the thread guide insert is below the inner width of the thread guide device. In an embodiment of this type, the possibility exists of purposely influencing the shape of the thread balloon by. corresponding shaping of the opening, for example as a function of the present yarn material or the thread thickness. The eyelet-opening of the thread guide insert may, as described in claim 11, for example, have a round cross-section or, as shown in claim 13, have a polygonal cross-section.<br>
The thread inlet region of the thread guide insert is preferably configured in a funnel-like manner, the inlet face of the thread guide insert, viewed in longitudinal section, either running linearly (claim 8) or being convexly arched (claim 9). It is ensured in the two embodiments that the thread can, on the one hand, can be blown or sucked upwardly without problems through the eyelet-like opening at the" beginning of the winding process and that, on the other hand, the rotating thread is not damaged during the winding process when it revolves in the opening.<br>
In a further embodiment described in claim 13, the convexly arched inlet face of the<br>
thread guide insert additionally has notches. On the revolving thread, these notches<br>
initiate vibrations, which also have a positive effect on the thread balloon.<br><br><br>
Further details of the invention will be described below with the aid of an embodiment shown in the drawings, in which:<br>

Fig. 11 shows a view of the thread guide insert, according to arrow F of Fig. 8,<br>
Fig. 12 shows a view of the thread guide insert, according to arrow F of Fig. 7.<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows a side view of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins, in the embodiment, a so-called automatic cross-winding machine 1. Automatic cross-winding machines 1 of this type have, between their end frames (not shown) a large number of similar workstations or winding heads 2. As known and therefore not explained in more detail, the spinning cops 9 produced on a ring spinning machine (not shown) and only having relatively little yarn material are rewound to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins 11 on these winding heads 2.<br>
The finished cross-wound bobbins 11 are then transferred by means of an automatically operating service unit, for example a cross-wound bobbin changer, to a cross-wound bobbin transporting device 21 along the length of the machine and transported to a bobbin loading station (not shown) or the like arranged at the end of the machine.<br>
Automatic cross-winding machines 1 of this type, as indicated in Fig. 1, either have a. logistics device in the form of a bobbin and tube transporting system 3 or a bobbin magazine particular to the workstation, preferably a so-called round magazine, is arranged in each case in the region of the numerous workstations 2.<br><br><br>
Spinning cops 9 or empty tubes 34 revolve in a bobbin and tube transporting system 3, secured on transporting plates 8 in vertical orientation. Of this bobbin and tube transporting system, Fig. 1 only shows the cop supply section 4, the reversibly drivable storage section 5, one of the transverse transporting sections 6 leading to the winding heads 2 and the tube return section 7. As indicated, the supplied spinning cops 9 are firstly positioned and rewound here in an unwinding position 10, which is located in the region of the transverse transporting sections 6 at the winding heads 2.<br>
The individual winding heads 2 for this purpose, as known and therefore only indicated, have various thread treatment and thread handling devices, which not' only ensure that the spinning cops 9 can be rewound to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins 11, but also ensure that the thread can be monitored during the rewinding process and thread defects detected can be cleared out.<br>
One of these devices known per se is the winding device 24, which has a creel 18, which is movably mounted about a pivot pin 19, a bobbin drive device 26 and a thread traversing device 28. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, the cross-wound bobbin 11 rests, during the winding process, for example with its surface on a drive drum 26 which can be driven by a single motor and is entrained thereby by means of frictional engagement.<br>
The thread is traversed when running onto the cross-wound bobbin 11 by means of a tread traversing device 28, which in the present embodiment has a finger thread guide 29. Such treat traversing devices are known and described in detail for example in DE198 58 548 Al.<br>
As already indicated at the outset of the introduction to the description, such<br>
winding heads 2 generally also in each case have a thread connection device 13,<br>
preferably a pneumatically operating splicing device, a reduced pressure-loadable,<br>
suction tube 12 and a likewise reduced pressure-loadable gripper tube 25. The<br><br><br>
suction tube 12 and the gripper tube 25 are connected here to a reduced pressure cross-beam 32 particular to the machine, which cross-beam is in turn connected to a reduced pressure source 33.<br>
Such workstations 2 generally also have a lower thread sensor 22, a thread tensioner 14, a thread clearer 15 with a thread cutting device 17, a thread tensile force sensor 20 and a waxing device 16. Furthermore, the workstations 2 are equipped with an auxiliary unwinding device 23, which is used both for the pneumatic transfer of a lower thread lying ready at the spinning cop 9 to a reduced pressure-loaded gripper • tube 25 and also ensures during the winding process that the thread balloon, which is produced when the thread runs off the spinning cop 9, is positively influenced in the sense of reducing the thread tension.<br>
This auxiliary unwinding device 23 consists, as indicated in Fig. 2 in a perspective view, substantially of a vertically displaceably mounted balloon limiter 27, a tubular thread guide device 36 and an adapter 40. In other words, the balloon limiter 27 can be adjusted in a defined manner by a drive 30 in the vertical direction R in such a way that the balloon limiter 27, following the unwinding process of the spinning cop 9, can be moved downwardly during the winding process. The lower edge 50 of the element 27 is advantageously positioned here approximately at the level of the cop cone 51 of the spinning cop 9.<br>
As indicated in Figs. 1 and 2, the thread guide device 36 is preferably configured so as to be multi-part. In other words, the thread guide device 36 consists of an upper tube 37 fixed to a stationarily arranged adapter 40 as well as a lower tube 38 which is arranged to be displaceable with respect to the upper tube 37 and can be adjusted with regard to its installation height. In the installed state, the lower tube 38 is constantly fixed at a height on the upper tube 37 such that a thread guide insert 39 arranged on the lower tube 38 of the thread guide device 36 is arranged just above the tube tip of a spinning cop 9 positioned in the unwinding position 10.<br><br><br>
According to the invention, this thread guide insert 39, the individual embodiments of which are shown in Figs. 3 to 12 in detail, is easily exchangeably arranged on the lower tube 38 of the thread guide device 36.<br>
As can be seen from the various drawings, the inlet region 45 of the thread guide insert 39 is configured in a funnel shape. The inlet face 46 is either, as shown in Figs. 3,5 and 7, viewed in longitudinal section, configured linearly here or the inlet face 46 is, as shown in Figs. 4, 6, 8 and 13 and 14, convexly arched. In the embodiments according to Figs. 3 and 4, the inner width d of the thread guide insert 39 corresponds to the inner width D of the lower tube 38 of the thread guide device 36.' Figs. 5 to 8 show thread guide inserts 39 with an eyelet-like end position 47. In other words, an opening 47 adjoins the inlet region 45, the inner width d of which opening is significantly smaller than the inner width D of the thread guide device 36. The thread guide insert 39 is, for example, as indicated in Figs. 3 to 6, manufactured directly of a wear-resistant material, preferably steel and then has, on its rear opposing the inlet side 5, ferromagnetic extensions 35, which correspond with permanent magnets 42, which are fixed in receiving bores 41 in the thread guide device 36. In other words, the ferromagnetic extensions 35 on the thread guide insert 39, with permanent magnets 42 on the thread guide device 36, form a magnetic holder 31.<br>
According to Figs. 7, 8, the thread guide insert 39 consists of a base body 43 and a thread inlet part 44 non-detachably fixed to the base body 43. The base body 43 is configured here, for example, as an injection-moulded or diecast part and consists, for example, of aluminium or a plastics material, while the thread inlet part 44 is manufactured from a highly wear-resistant material, for example of a technical ceramic material. In this case, the thread guide insert 39 is also fixed to the thread guide device 36 by means of a magnetic holder 31.<br><br><br>
As indicated in Figs. 11 and 12, the eyelet-like opening 47 in the thread guide insert 39 may have both a circular and a polygonal form. In addition, as indicated in Fig.' 11, notches or the like, which influence the thread during its rotation, may be provided in the region of the inlet face 46.<br>
It can be ensured by the auxiliary unwinding device 23 according to the invention with an exchangeable thread guide insert 39 on the input side of a thread guide device 36 that the winding process can be implemented in a manner which is gentle to the thread and at a high winding speed.<br><br><br>
