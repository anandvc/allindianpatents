NON-AQUEOUS PIGMENTED INKJET INKS Description Technical field<br>
[0001]   The present invention relates to stable Inkjet inks comprising a yellow pigment in a non-aqueous medium.<br>
Background art<br>
[0002]   Pigment dispersions are made using a dispersant. A dispersant is a<br>
substance for promoting the formation and stabilization of a dispersion of pigment particles in a dispersion medium. Dispersants are generally surface-active materials having an anionic, cationic or non-ionic structure. The presence of a dispersant substantially reduces the dispersing energy required. Dispersed pigment particles may have a tendency to re-agglomerate after the dispersing operation, due to mutual attraction forces. The use of dispersants also counteracts this re-agglomeration tendency of the pigment particles.<br>
[0003]   The dispersant has to meet particularly high requirements when used for Inkjet inks. Inadequate dispersing manifests itself as increased viscosity in liquid systems, loss of brilliance and/or hue shifts. Moreover, particularty good dispersion of the pigment particles is required to ensure unimpeded passage of the pigment particles through the nozzles of the print head in an Inkjet printer, which are usually only a few micrometers in diameter. In addition, pigment particle agglomeration and the associated blockage of the printer nozzles has to be avoided in the standby periods of the printer.<br>
[0004]   Many polymeric dispersants contain in one part of the molecule so-called anchor groups, which adsorb onto the pigments to be dispersed. In a spatially separate part of the molecule, polymeric dispersants have polymer chains sticking out whereby pigment particles are made compatible with the dispersion medium, i.e. stabilized.<br>
[0005]   The properties of polymeric dispersants depend on both the nature of the monomers and their distribution in the polymer. Polymeric dispersants obtained by statistically polymerizing monomers (e.g. monomers A and B polymerized into ABBAABAB) or by polymerizing alternating monomers (e.g. monomers A and B polymerized into ABABABAB) generally result in<br>
 <br>
poor dispersion stability. Improvements in dispersion stability were obtained using graft copolymer and block copolymer dispersants.<br>
[0006]   In the design of polymeric dispersants for pigment dispersions, dispersants which contain a polyester chain moiety derived from one or more hydroxycarboxylic acids or lactones thereof have been known for a long time. Early examples of such dispersants are disclosed in EP 0158406 A (ICI) for dispersing finely divided particles of a magnetic material in an organic liquid.<br>
[0007]   These are generally of two distinct chemical types. In the first type, the hydroxycarboxylic acid or lactone is polymerized in the presence of an alkylcarboxyllc acid as polymerization terminating group to give a polyester chain having a free carboxylic acid which is then reacted with an amine such as polyethyleneimine.<br>
[0008]   In the second type of dispersant, the hydroxycarboxylic acid or lactone is polymerized in the presence of an aliphatic alcohol as polymerization terminating group to give a polyester chain having a free hydroxyl group which is subsequently converted to a phosphate ester. Early examples of such dispersants are disclosed in EP 0164617 A (ICI).<br>
[0009]   More recently, the properties of such dispersants have been improved by branching the alkylene group of the polyester chain as disclosed in US 6197877 (ZENECA) or by using polymerization terminating groups containing a branched aliphatic chain as disclosed in US 2003181544 (AVECIA) .<br>
[0010]   Generally pigments have a non-polar surface. In aqueous Inkjet inks, the polymeric dispersants generally contain hydrophobic anchor groups exhibiting a high affinity for the pigment surface and hydrophilic polymer chains for stabilizing the pigments in the aqueous dispersion medium. The preparation of thermally stable dispersions with submicron particles is often more difficult in the case of non-aqueous Inkjet inks where both the pigment surface and the dispersion medium are non-polar. Especially quinacridone pigments and yellow pigments, such as C.I. Pigment Yellow 120, C.I. Pigment Yellow 213 and C.I. Pigment Yellow 150, pose difficulties.<br>
 <br>
[0011]   For consistent image quality, the inkjet ink should be capable of dealing with elevated temperatures during transport of the ink to a customer and also during inkjet printing where the inkjet ink is generally heated to a temperature above 40°C.<br>
[0012]   The consistency of image quality also depends on the consistent quality of the raw materials used to prepare the pigment dispersions. For a number of pigments, the quality changes so drastically from batch to batch in production that some batches become unsuitable for producing inkjet inks. One method used by ink manufacturers to handle this raw material inconsistency is to order samples of different new production batches and to evaluate if they are suitable for preparing inkjet inks. This evaluation is not only a time consuming and costly activity but also restricts the flexibility in ink manufacturing requiring the availability of larger stocks to guarantee deliverability of ink.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
Technical problem<br>
[0013]   Due to their insoluble character, the quality of colour pigments tends to<br>
change from batch to batch in production. Differences in production batch quality are particularly often observed in producing non-aqueous yellow pigmented inkjet inks. This can lead to inconsistent image quality and even to malfunction of inkjet printers.<br>
[0014]   It is an object of the present invention to provide non-aqueous inkjet inks having a consistent quality and which are less sensitive to variations in the batch quality of the pigments.<br>
[0015]   It is another object of the present invention to provide non-aqueous inkjet inks and ink set s improved for dispersion quality and stability.<br>
[0016]   Further objects of the invention will become apparent from the description hereinafter.<br>
Technical solution<br>
[0017]   It has been surprisingly found that the pigment C.I. Pigment Yellow 120 could be dispersed in non-aqueous inkjet inks exhibiting high dispersion stability using a specific polymeric dispersant independently of the batch of pigment used.<br>
 <br>
[0018]   Objects of the present invention have been realized with a non-aqueous Inkjet ink comprising a benzimidazolone pigment and a polymeric dispersant according to Formula (I):<br>
wherein, <br>
T represents hydrogen or a polymerization terminating group;<br>
Z represents the residue of polyethyleneimine having a number-average<br>
molecular weight of at least 100;<br>
A represents an oxyalkylene carbonyl group;<br>
T-C(0)An- represents a TPOAC-chain which is bound to Z through an<br>
amide bond; and<br>
n and m are integers wherein m is at least 2 and n is from 2 to 100;<br>
characterized in that the polymeric dispersant fulfills the conditions of:<br>
WTPOAC &gt; 57 and N Amide<br>
§ 65 mol%<br>
with<br>
WTPOAC representing the ratio of the weight percentage of TPOAC-chains<br>
over the weight percentage of amide bonds in the polymeric dispersant;<br>
NAmide representing the mol% of amide bonds based on the total nitrogen<br>
content of the polymeric dispersant; and<br>
wherein the values of WTPOAC and NAmide are calculated from the total<br>
nitrogen content determined by dry combustion of the polymeric<br>
dispersant and from the amine content determined through potentiometric<br>
titration in a mixture of CH3C00H:THF (14.5:0.5) with 0.1 N aqueous<br>
perchloric acid.<br>
[0019]   It is another object of the present invention to provide a non-aqueous Inkjet ink set comprising a stable yellow non-aqueous Inkjet ink.<br>
[0020]   These and other objects of the invention will become apparent from the description hereinafter.<br>
Advantageous effects<br>
5<br>
 <br>
[0021]   It was found that not only benzimidazolone pigments, but also other<br>
organic colour pigments could be dispersed into stable non-aqueous Inkjet inks using the same polymeric dispersant and liquid carrier. A uniform composition of the different inks in an Inkjet ink set is often advantageous since no printing artefacts are to be expected due to incompatibilities between the different components of the inks.<br>

characterized in that the polymeric dispersant fulfills the conditions of:<br>
WTPOAC &gt; 57 and NAmide^ 65 mol% with<br>
WTPOAC representing the ratio of the weight percentage of TPOAC-chains over the weight percentage of amide bonds in the polymeric dispersant; NAmide representing the mol% of amide bonds based on the total nitrogen content of the polymeric dispersant; and<br>
wherein the values WTPOAC and NAmide are calculated from the total nitrogen content determined by dry combustion of the polymeric dispersant and from the amine content determined through potentiometric titration in a mixture of CH3C00H:THF (14.5:0.5) with 0.1N aqueous perchloric acid. [0038]   The polymerization terminating group or endgroup T may be derived from a mono-carboxylic acid T-COOH selected from the group consisting of an aliphatic acid, an aromatic acid, a hetero-aromatic acid, a heterocyclic acid and an alicyclic acid. In a preferred embodiment, the aliphatic acid is a Ci.<br>
8<br>
 <br>
25 aliphatic carboxylic acid optionally substituted by hydroxyl, C1-4 alkyl or halogen.<br>
[0039]   Examples of T-COOH are 2-ethylbutyric, 2-ethylhexanoic, 2-butyloctanoic, 2-hexyldecanoic, 2-octyldodecanoic and 2-decyltetradecanoic acids. Branched aliphatic acids of this type are available under the trade mark Isocarb (ex Condea GmbH) and specific examples are Isocarb 12, 16, 20, 28, 32, 34T and 36. T-COOH may be a single carboxylic acid or may be a mixture of such acids.<br>
[0040]   The compound formed by the (co) polymerisation of a hydroxycarboxylic<br>
acid or lactone thereof in the presence of T-COOH can be represented by<br>
the formula:	T-CO(0-V-CO)nOH<br>
wherein V represents Ci-30-aikylene and/or Ci-30-alkenylene and is referred to hereinafter as a TPOAC-acid.<br>
[0041]   Examples of hydroxycarboxylic acids are glycolic acid, lactic acid,<br>
hydroxyvaleric acid, hydroxycaproic acid, ricinoleic acid, 12-hydroxystearic acid, 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid, 5-hydroxydodecanoic acid, 5-hydroxydecanoic acid and 4-hydroxydecanoic acid.<br>
[0042]   Examples of suitable lactones are p-propiolactone, y-butyrolactone,<br>
optionally alkyl substituted e-caprolactone and optionally alkyl substituted 6-valerolactone. The alkyi substituent in E-caprolactone and 6-valerolactone is preferably Ci-e-alkyI and especially Ci-4-alkyl and may be linear or branched. The alkyl substituted e-caprolactone may be obtained by the oxidation of alkyl substituted cyclohexanone as described in WO 98/19784 and some are obtained as mixtures. Examples of alkyl substituted £-caprolactone are 7-methyl, 3-methyl, 5-methyl, 6-methyl, 4-methyl, 5-tert-butyl, 4,6,6-trimethyl and 4,4,6-trimethyl E-caprolactone. An example of alkyl substituted 6-valerolactone is p-methyl-6-valerolactone. Preferred lactones are E-caprolactone and 5-valerolactone.<br>
[0043]   In a preferred embodiment, the TPOAC-acid comprises a mixture of oxyalkylene carbonyl groups derivable from 6-valerolactone and E-caprolactone, more preferably this mixture comprises more than 75 mol% E-caprolactone.<br>
 <br>
[0044]   The polymeric dispersants can be obtained by reacting PEI with a TPOAC-acid or lactone precursor(s) thereof at a temperature between 50 and 250°C, preferably in an inert atmosphere and optionally in the presence of an amidation catalyst. Preferably, the temperature is not less than SOX and especially not less than 100°C. In order to minimize charring of the dispersant the temperature is preferably not greater than 150°C.<br>
[0045]   The inert atmosphere may be any gas which does not react with the final product or starting materials and includes the inert gases of the Periodic Table and especially nitrogen.<br>
[0046]   When the dispersant is prepared in a single stage by reacting PEI,<br>
polymerisation terminating agent T-COOH and lactone(s) it is preferable to include an esterification catalyst such as tetra-alkyi titanate, for example tetrabutyl titanate, zinc salt of an organic acid, for example, zinc acetate, zirconium salt of an aliphatic alcohol, for example zirconium isopropoxide, toluene sulphonic acid or a strong organic acid such as haloacetic acid, for example trifluoroacetic acid. Zirconium isopropoxide is preferred. When the dispersant of the first aspect of the invention is prepared by a single stage process, higher temperature may be required and these are typically from 150-1 SOX.<br>
[0047]   However, a two-stage process is preferred wherein the TPOAC-acid is prepared separately, prior to reacting it with PEI. In this case, the lactone(s) and polymerisation terminating agent are reacted together in an inert atmosphere at 150-1 SOX in the presence of an esterification catalyst. The subsequent reaction of the TPOAC-acid with PEI may then be carried out at temperatures of 100-150X.<br>
[004S]   An example of the synthesis of the polymeric dispersant having a<br>
polyethylenimine core grafted by polyester chains can be represented by the following condensation reaction of polyethyleneimine with a TPOAC-acid in the presence of a Zr(IV+)isopropoxide catalyst. For the sake of simplicity, polyethylene imine is represented as a linear polymer chain In the reaction schemes below, although the polyethyleneimine in accordance with the present invention is hyperbranched and contains a mixture of primary, secondary and tertiary amines.<br>
10<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0049]   Although the reaction seems fairly simple, the synthesis is not that straightforward due to the occurrence of side reactions.<br>
[0050]   A first side reaction which occurs is the PEI (base) catalyzed hydrolyzis of the ester bond in the TPOAC-acid by water:<br>
 <br>
(R=e.g. C11H25) As a result a TPOAC-acid and an alcohol terminated POAC-acid having a shorter polyester chain length than the original TPOAC-acid are formed, which can both react with the PEI to form a polymeric dispersant. The reaction may also occur after the TPOAC-acid has already reacted with the PEI, again resulting in a shorter chain length for the polyester graft, as shown below:<br>
11<br>
 <br>
 <br>
*<br>
[0051]   A second side reaction is a transamidation reaction of the polyester<br>
chains, again leading to shorter chain lengths of the polyester grafts on the PEI . The side reaction can occur with free TPOAC chains or with already condensed TPOAC.<br>
 <br>
[0052]   The resulting polymeric dispersant has a hyperbranched polymer<br>
architecture having a broad distribution of polyester chain lengths, which makes the polymer characterization very difficult. An optimized schematic representation of part of a polymeric dispersant wherein T-COOH was lauric acid is given by the following formula:<br>
12<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0053]   There exist many parameters for designing polymeric dispersants<br>
comprising a polyall<yleneimine core grafted by polyester chains these parameters include the type of n-containing types polyalkyleneimine polyallylamine polyvinylamine ... size number length endgroups composition etc></yleneimine>
[0054]   In spite of the synthetic problems and the many parameters for designing the polymeric dispersants, it was surprisingly found that there are only three crucial parameters;<br>
1.	The type of the polyalkyleneimine should be polyethyleneimine (PEI);<br>
2.	The polyester chains should be long enough; and<br>
3.	The number of polyester chains should be high enough relative to the<br>
size of the PEI.<br>
[0055]   Parameter 2 (polyester chain length) and parameter 3 (number of polyester chains) could be adequately characterized by WTPOAC respectively NAmide. WTPOAC represents the ratio of the weight percentage of<br>
13<br>
 <br>
TPOAC-chains over the weight percentage of amide bonds in the polymeric dispersant.<br>
NAmide represents the mol% of amide bonds based on tlie total nitrogen content of the polymeric dispersant.<br>
[0056]   The values of WTPOAC and NAmide can be determined by two simple analysis methods. The amine content Namine of the polymeric dispersant, expressed as mole amine/100 g of polymeric dispersant, can be determined through potentiometric titration in a mixture of CHaCOOHiTHF (14.5:0.5) with 0.1 N aqueous perchloric acid.<br>
[0057]   The nitrogen content Wtot N of the polymeric dispersant, expressed in grams nitrogen/100 g polymeric dispersant, can be determined by dry combustion according to DIN IS013878 (Bodenbeschaffenheit, Bestimmung des Gesamt-Stickstoffs durch trockene Verbrennung).<br>
[0058]   Calculation of NAmide:<br>
The mole% nitrogen present as an amide bond NAmide based upon the total nitrogen content Wtot N of the polymeric dispersant is found by the following formula:<br>
NAmide = 100 X [ (Wtot N/14) - Namine ] / [ Wtot N/14 ]<br>
Note: 14 = the weight of nitrogen in g/mol.<br>
[0059]   Calculation of WTPOAC :<br>
The weight percentage of PEI present in the polymeric dispersant is found by the formula (WtotN x 43)/14 , wherein 43 represents the molecular weight of ethyleneimine in g/mol. The weight percentage of all TPOAC-chains present in the polymeric dispersant is then found by the formula 100-(WtotNx43)/14.<br>
The weight percentage of amide bonds in the polymeric dispersant is obtained by WtotN- (Namine x 14). Hence, WTPOAC = [100 - (WtotN x 43)/14 ] / [WtotN - (Namine x 14)] .<br>
[0060]   The polymeric dispersant according to the present invention must have: WTPOAC &gt; 57 and NAmide § 65 mol%.<br>
Colour pigments<br>
[0061]   The colour pigment in the non-aqueous Inkjet ink according to present invention is a benzimidazolone pigment.<br>
14<br>
 <br>
[0062]   In a preferred embodiment, the benzimidazolone pigment contains a chromophore according to Formula (II):<br>
 <br>
wherein,<br>
R1 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, a halogen atom, a<br>
methyl group, an ethyl group, a methoxy group, an ethoxy group,-CF3, -<br>
C00H,-C00CH3and<br>
 <br>
R2, R4 and R5 are independently selected from the group consisting of<br>
hydrogen, a halogen atom, a methyl group, an ethyl group, a methoxy<br>

 <br>
[0065]   Pigment particles in inkjet ink should be sufficiently small to permit free flow of the ink through the Inkjet-printing device, especially at the ejecting nozzles. It is also desirable to use small particles for maximum colour strength and to slow down sedimentation.<br>
[0066]   The average particle size of the pigment in an inkjet ink should be between 0.005 and 15 pm. The numeric average pigment particle size is preferably between 0.005 and 5 pm, more preferably between 0.005 and 1 pm, particularly preferably between 0.005 and 0.3 pm and most preferably between 0.040 and 0.150 pm.<br>
[0067]   The non-aqueous inkjet ink comprising a benzimidazolone pigment is<br>
generally used in combination with inkjet inks of different colours to form an inkjet ink set. These other inkjet inks may be black, cyan, magenta, yellow, red, orange, violet, blue, green, brown, mixtures thereof, and the like.<br>
[0068]   In a preferred embodiment the inkjet ink set comprises at least a cyan ink, a magenta ink, a yellow ink and a black ink. The CMYK ink set may also be extended with extra inks such as red, green, blue, and/or orange to enlarge the colour gamut of the ink set. The CMYK ink set may also be extended by the combination of full density and light density inks of both color inks and/or black inks to improve the image quality by lowered graininess.<br>
[0069]   The pigment is preferably used in the non-aqueous pigment inkjet ink in an amount of 0.1 to 20 wt%, preferably 1 to 10 wt% based on the total weight of the non-aqueous inkjet ink. In multi-density inkjet ink set s, a light density inkjet ink preferably comprises the pigment in an amount between 0.1 to 3 wt% and a full density inkjet ink preferably comprises the pigment in an amount between 1 to 10 wt% of pigment.<br>
[0070]   The colour pigment for the other inkjet inks may be chosen from those disclosed by HERBST, Willy, et al. Industrial Organic Pigments, Production, Properties, Applications. 3rd edition. Wiley - VCH , 2004. ISBN 3527305769.<br>

[0076]   Particular preferred pigments are C.I. Pigment Brown 6 and 7.<br>
[0077]   Suitable pigments include mixed crystals of the above particular preferred pigments. A commercially available example is Cinquasia Magenta RT-355-D from Ciba Specialty Chemicals. Mixed crystals are also referred to as solid solutions. Under certain conditions different colorants mix with each other to form solid solutions, which are quite different from both physical mixtures of the compounds and from the compounds themselves. In a solid solution, the molecules of the components enter into the same crystal lattice, usually, but not always, that of one of the components. The x-ray diffraction pattern of the resulting crystalline solid is characteristic of that solid and can be clearly differentiated froQi the pattern of a physical mixture of the same components in the same proportion. In such physical mixtures, the x-ray pattern of each of the components can be distinguished, and the disappearance of many of these lines is one of the criteria of the formation of solid solutions.<br>
[0078]   Carbon black is preferred as a pigment for the non-aqueous black Inkjet ink. Suitable black pigment materials include carbon blacks such as Pigment Black 7 (e.g. Carbon Black MA8™ from MITSUBISHI CHEMICAL), Regal™ 400R, Mogul™ L, Elftex™ 320 from CABOT Co., or Carbon Black FW18, Special Black 250, Special Black 350, Special Black 550, Printex™ 25, Printex™ 35, Printex™ 55, PrintexTM 90, PrintexTM 150T from DEGUSSA. Additional examples of suitable pigments are disclosed in US 5389133 (XEROX).<br>
17<br>
 <br>
[0079]   It is also possible to make mixtures of pigments in a non-aqueous Inkjet ink. For example, carbon black generally exhibits a warm brownish black tone, while a neutral black tone is generally preferred. A neutral black Inkjet ink can be obtained, for example, by mixing carbon black with a cyan, a magenta or a cyan and magenta pigment into the ink, as for example described in pending European patent application EP 1593718 A (AGFA) . The Inkjet application may also require one or more spot colours, for example for packaging Inkjet printing or textile inkjet printing. Silver and gold are often desired colours for inkjet poster printing and point-of-sales displays. Particular preferred pigments are C.I. Pigment Metal 1, 2 and 3. Illustrative examples of the inorganic pigments include titanium oxide, barium sulfate, calcium carbonate, zinc oxide, lead sulfate, yellow lead, zinc yellow, red iron oxide (III), cadmium red, ultramarine blue, prussian blue, chromium oxide green, cobalt green, amber, titanium black and synthetic iron black.<br>

[0080]   The non-aqueous inkjet ink according to the present invention may contain at least one dispersion synergist. A mixture of dispersion synergists may be used to further improve dispersion stability<br>
[0081]   The dispersion synergist usually consists of an anionic part and a cationic part. The anionic part of the dispersion synergist exhibiting a certain molecular similarity with the colour pigment and the cationic part of the dispersion synergist consists of one or more protons and/or cations to compensate the charge of the anionic part of the dispersion synergist.<br>
[0082]   The synergist is preferably added in an amount between 0.1 and 20 wt% based upon the weight of the pigment.<br>
[0083]   The synergist should be additional to the amount of polymeric<br>
dispersant(s). The ratio of polymeric dispersant/dispersion synergist depends upon the pigment and should be determined experimentally. Typically the ratio wt% polymeric dispersant/wt% dispersion synergist is selected between 2:1 to 1000:1, preferably between 2:1 and 100:1.<br>
[0084]   Suitable dispersion synergists that are commercially available include Solsperse™ 5000 and Solsperse™ 22000 from NOVEON.<br>

[0150]  A curable Inkjet ink usually contains an initiator. The initiator typically<br>
initiates the polymerization reaction. The initiator can be a thermal initiator, but is preferably a photo-initiator. The photo-initiator requires less energy to activate than the monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers to form the polymer. The photo-initiator suitable for use in the curable liquids may be a Norrish type I initiator, a Norrish type II initiator or a photo-acid generator.<br>
[0151]   Thermal initiator(s) suitable for use in the curable Inkjet ink include tert-amyl peroxybenzoate, 4,4-azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid), 1,1'-azobis(cyclohexanecarbonitrile), 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), benzoyl peroxide, 2,2-bis( tert-butylperoxy)butane, 1,1-bis( tert-butylperoxy)cyclohexane,1,1-Bis( tert-butylperoxy)cyclohexane, 2,5-bis( tert-butylperoxy)-2,5-dimethylhexane, 2,5-bis( tert-butylperoxy)-2,5-dimethyl-3-hexyne, bis(1-( tert-butylperoxy)-1-methylethyl)benzene, 1,1-bis{ tert-butylperoxy)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, tert-butyl peracetate, tert-butyl peroxide, tert-butyl peroxybenzoate, tert-butylperoxy isopropyl carbonate, cumene hydroperoxide, cyclohexanone peroxide, dicumyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, 2,4- pentanedione peroxide, peracetic acid and potassium persulfate.<br>
[0152]   The photo-initiator or photo-initiator system absorbs light and is<br>
responsible for the production of initiating species, such as free radicals and cations. Free radicals and cations are high-energy species that induce polymerization of monomers, oligomers and polymers and with polyfunctional monomers and oligomers thereby also induce cross-linking.<br>
[0153]   Irradiation with actinic radiation may be realized in two steps by changing wavelength or intensity. In such cases it is preferred to use 2 types of photo-initiator together.<br>
[0154]   A combination of different types of initiator, for example, a photo-initiator and a thermal initiator can also be used.<br>
[0155]   A preferred Norrish type l-initiator is selected from the group consisting of benzoinethers, benzil ketals, a,a-dialkoxyacetophenones,<br>
30<br>
 <br>
a-hydroxyalkylphenones, a-aminoalkylphenones, acylphosphine oxides, acylphosphine sulphides, a-haloketones, a-halosulfones and a-halophenylglyoxalates.<br>
[0156]   A preferred Norrish type ll-initiator is selected from the group consisting of benzophenones, thioxanthones, 1,2-diketones and anthraquinones. A preferred co-initiator is selected from the group consisting of an aliphatic amine, an aromatic amine and a thiol. Tertiary amines, heterocyclic thiols and 4-dialkylamino-benzoic acid are particularly preferred as co-initiator.<br>
[0157]   Suitable photo-initiators are disclosed in CRiVELLO, J.V., et aL VOLUME III: Photoinitiators for Free Radical Cationic. 2nd edition. Edited by BRADLEY, G.. London,UK: John Wiley and Sons Ltd, 1998. p.287-294.<br>
[0158]   Specific examples of photo-initiators may include, but are not limited to, the following compounds or combinations thereof: benzophenone and substituted benzophenones, 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone, thioxanthones such as isopropylthioxanthone, 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenylpropan-1-one, 2-benzyl-2-dtmethylamino- (4-morpholinophenyl) butan-1-one, benzil dimethylketal, bis (2,6- dimethylbenzoyi) -2,4, 4-trimethylpentylphosphine oxide, 2,4,6trimethylbenzoyldiphenylphosphine oxide, 2-methyl-1- [4- (methylthio) phenyl] -2-morphonnopropan-1-one, 2,2-dimethoxy-1, 2-diphenylethan-1-one or 5,7-diiodo-3- butoxy-6-fluorone, diphenyliodonium fluoride and triphenylsulfonium hexafluophosphate.<br>

[0160] Suitable cationic photo-initiators include compounds, which form aprotic acids or Bronstead acids upon exposure to ultraviolet and/or visible light sufficient to initiate polymerization. The photo-initiator used may be a<br>
31<br>
 <br>
single compound, a mixture of two or more active compounds, or a combination of two or more different compounds, i.e. co-initiators. Non-limiting examples of suitable cationic photo-initiators are aryldiazonium salts, diaryliodonium salts, triarylsulphonium salts, triarylselenonium salts and the like.<br>
[0161]   The curable Inkjet ink may contain a photo-initiator system containing photo-initiator(s) and one or more sensitizers that transfer energy to the photo-initiator(s). Suitable sensitizers include photoreducible xanthene, fluorene, benzoxanthene, benzothioxanthene, thiazine, oxazine, coumarin, pyronine, porphyrin, acridine, azo, diazo, cyanine, merocyanine, diarylmethyl, triarylmethyl, anthraquinone, phenylenediamine, benzimidazole, fluorochrome, quinoline, tetrazole, naphthol, benzidine, rhodamine, indigo and/or indanthrene dyes. The amount of the sensitizer is in general from 0.01 to 15 wt%, preferably from 0.05 to 5 wt%, based in each case on the total weight of the curable pigmented Inkjet ink.<br>
[0162]   In order to increase the photosensitivity further, the curable pigmented Inkjet inks may additionally contain co-initiators. For example, the combination of titanocenes and trichloromethyl-s-triazines, of titanocenes and ketoxime ethers and of acridines and trichloromethyl-s-triazines is known. A further increase in sensitivity can be achieved by adding dibenzalacetone or amino acid derivatives. The amount of co-initiator or co-initiators is in general from 0.01 to 20 wt%, preferably from 0.05 to 10 wt%, based in each case on the total weight of the curable pigmented Inkjet ink.<br>
[0163]   A preferred initiator system is 2,2'-bis(o-chlorophenyl)-4,4',5,5'-tetraphenyl-(7CI,8CI) 4,4'-Bi-4H-imidazole corresponding to the chemical formula:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
in the presence of a co-initiator such as 2-mercapto benzoxazole. [0164]   Another preferred type of initiator is an oxime ester. A suitable example has as chemical formula:<br>
 <br>
[0165]   A preferred amount of initiator is 0.3 - 50 wt% of the total weight of the curable pigmented Inkjet ink, and more preferably 1 -15 wt% of the total weight of the curable pigmented Inkjet ink.<br>
Inhibitors<br>
[0166]   Radiation curable Inkjet inks according to the present invention may contain a polymerization inhibitor. Suitable polymerization inhibitors include phenol type antioxidants, hindered amine light stabilizers, phosphor type antioxidants, hydroquinone monomethyl ether commonly used in (meth)acrylate monomers, and hydroquinone, t-butylcatechol, pyrogallol may also be used.<br>
[0167]   Suitable commercial inhibitors are, for example, Sumilizer™ GA-80,<br>
Sumilizer™ GM and Sumilizer™ OS produced by Sumitomo Chemical Co. Ltd.; Genorad™ 16, Genorad™ 18 and Genorad™ 20 from Rahn AG; IrgastabTM UV10 and Irgastab™ UV22, Tinuvin™ 460 and CGS20 from Ciba Specialty Chemicals; Floorstab™ UV range (UV-1, UV-2, UV-5 and UV-8) from Kromachem Ltd, Additol™ S range (SI00, S110, SI20 and SI30) from Cytec Surface Specialties.<br>
[0168]   Since excessive addition of these polymerization inhibitors will lower the ink sensitivity to curing, it is preferred that the amount capable of preventing polymerization is determined prior to blending. The amount of a polymerization inhibitor is preferably lower than 2 wt% of the total ink.<br>
Surfactants<br>
33<br>
 <br>
[0169]   The pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention may contain at least one surfactant. The surfactant(s) can be anionic, catlonic, non-ionic, or zwitter-lonic and are usually added In a total quantity less than 20 wt% based on the total weight of the pigmented Inkjet ink and particularly in a total less than 10 wt% based on the total weight of the pigmented Inkjet ink.<br>
[0170]   Suitable surfactants for the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention include fatty acid salts, ester salts of a higher alcohol, alkylbenzene sulphonate salts, sulphosuccinate ester salts and phosphate ester salts of a higher alcohol (for example, sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate and sodium dioctylsulphosuccinate), ethylene oxide adducts of a higher alcohol, ethylene oxide adducts of an alkylphenol, ethylene oxide adducts of a polyhydric alcohol fatty acid ester, and acetylene glycol and ethylene oxide adducts thereof (for example, polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether, and SURFYNOL™ 104, 104H, 440, 465 and TG available from AIR PRODUCTS &amp; CHEMICALS INC.).<br>
[0171]   For non-aqueous inkjet inks preferred surfactants are selected from fluoro surfactants (such as fluorinated hydrocarbons), silicones and siloxanes. The silicones may be polyether modified, polyether modified hydroxy functional, amine modified, epoxy modified and other modifications or combinations thereof. The siloxanes may be alkoxylated. Preferred silicones and siloxanes are polymeric, for example polydimethylsilicones and polydimethylsiloxanes.<br>
[0172]   When the pigmented inkjet ink is a radiation curable inkjet ink a fluorinated or silicone compound may be used as a surfactant, preferably a cross-linkable surfactant is used. Polymerizable monomers having surface-active effects include silicone modified acrylates, silicone modified methacrylates, acrylated siloxanes, polyether modified acrylic modified siloxanes, fluorinated acrylates, and fluorinated methacrylates. Polymerizable monomers having surface-active effects can be mono-, di-, tri- or higher functional (meth)acrylates or mixtures thereof.<br>
Other additives<br>
34<br>
 <br>
[0173]   In addition to the constituents, described above, the pigmented Inkjet inks may, if necessary, further contain following additives to have desired performance: UV-absorbers, evaporation accelerators, rust inhibitors, crosslinking agents, soluble electrolytes as conductivity aid, sequestering agents and chelating agents, compounds to introduce security features,...<br>
[0174]   Compounds to introduce security features include a fluorescent<br>
compound, a phosphorescent compound, a thermochromic compound, an iridescent compound and a magnetic particle. Suitable UV-fluorescent and phosphorescent compounds include LUMILUX™ luminescent pigments from HONEYWELL, UVITEX™ OB from CIBA-GEIGY, KEYFLUOR™ dyes and pigments from KEYSTONE and fluorescent dyes from SYNTHEGEN.<br>
Preparation of Inkjet inks<br>
[0175]  The Inkjet ink may be prepared by precipitating or milling the pigment in the dispersion medium in the presence of the dispersant.<br>
[0176]   Mixing apparatuses may include a pressure kneader, an open kneader, a planetary mixer, a dissolver, and a Dalton Universal Mixer. Suitable milling and dispersion apparatuses are a ball mill, a pearl mill, a colloid mill, a high-speed disperser, double rollers, a bead mill, a paint conditioner, and triple rollers. The dispersions may also be prepared using ultrasonic energy. A combination of these techniques may be used.<br>
[0177]   Many different types of materials may be used as milling media, such as glasses, ceramics, metals, and plastics. In a preferred embodiment, the grinding media can comprise particles, preferably substantially spherical in shape, e.g. beads consisting essentially of a polymeric resin or yttrium stabilized zirconium oxide beads.<br>
[0178]   In the process of mixing, milling and dispersion, each process is performed with cooling to prevent build up of heat, and for radiation curable Inkjet inks as much as possible under light conditions in which actinic radiation has been substantially excluded.<br>
[0179]   The Inkjet ink according to the present invention may contain more than<br>
one pigment, the Inkjet ink may be prepared using separate dispersions for each pigment, or alternatively several pigments may be mixed and co-milled in preparing the dispersion.<br>
35<br>
 <br>
[0180]   The dispersion process can be carried out in a continuous, batch or semi-batch mode.<br>
[0181]   The preferred amounts and ratios of the ingredients of the mill grind will vary widely depending upon the specific materials and the intended applications. The contents of the milling mixture comprise the mill grind and the milling media. The mill grind comprises pigment, polymeric dispersant and a liquid carrier. For inl<jet inks the pigment is usually present in mill grind at to wt excluding milling media. weight ratio of over polymeric dispersant></jet>
[0182]   The milling time can vary widely and depends upon the pigment,<br>
mechanical means and residence conditions selected, the initial and desired final particle size, etc. In the present invention pigment dispersions with an average particle size of less than 100 nm may be prepared.<br>
[0183]   After milling is completed, the milling media is separated from the milled particulate product (in either a dry or liquid dispersion form) using conventional separation techniques, such as by filtration, sieving through a mesh screen, and the like. Often the sieve is built into the mill, e.g. for a bead mill. The milled pigment concentrate is preferably separated from the milling media by filtration.<br>
[0184]   In general it is desirable to make the Inkjet inks in the form of a<br>
concentrated mill grind, which is subsequently diluted to the appropriate concentration for use in the Inkjet printing system. This technique permits preparation of a greater quantity of pigment ink from the equipment. By dilution, the Inkjet ink is adjusted to the desired viscosity, surface tension, colour, hue, saturation density, and print area coverage for the particular application.<br>
Inkjet printers<br>
[0185]  The non-aqueous Inkjet ink according to the present invention may be jetted by one or more printing heads ejecting small droplets of liquid in a controlled manner through nozzles onto an ink-receiver surface, which is moving relative to the printing head(s).<br>
[0186]   A preferred printing head for the Inkjet printing system is a piezoelectric head. Piezoelectric Inkjet printing is based on the movement of a<br>
36<br>
 <br>
piezoelectric ceramic transducer when a voltage is applied thereto. The application of a voltage changes the shape of the piezoelectric ceramic transducer in the printing head creating a void, which is then filled with ink. When the voltage is again removed, the ceramic expands to its original shape, ejecting a drop of ink from the print head. However the Inkjet printing method is not restricted to piezoelectric Inkjet printing. Other Inkjet printing heads can be used and include various types, such as a continuous type and thermal, electrostatic and acoustic drop on demand type.<br>
[0187]  At high printing speeds, the inks must be ejected readily from the printing heads, which puts a number of constraints on the physical properties of the ink, e.g. a low viscosity at the jetting temperature, which may vary from 25°C to 110°C, a surface energy such that the printing head nozzle can form the necessary small droplets, a homogenous liquid capable of rapid conversion to a dry printed area,...<br>
[0188]   The viscosity of the Inkjet ink used in the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention is preferably lower than 30 mPa.s, more preferably lower than 15 mPa.s, and most preferably between 2 and 10 mPas at a shear rate of 100 s-' and a jetting temperature between 10 and 70°C.<br>
[0189]   The Inkjet printing head normally scans back and forth in a transversal direction across the moving ink-receiver surface. Often the Inkjet print head does not print on the way back. Bi-directional printing is preferred for obtaining a high area! throughput. Another preferred print mode is printing in a "single pass printing process", which can be performed by using page wide Inkjet printing heads or multiple staggered Inkjet printing heads which cover the entire width of the ink-receiver surface. In a single pass printing process the Inkjet printing heads usually remain stationary and the ink-receiver surface is transported under the Inkjet printing heads.<br>
Spectral Separation Factor<br>
[0190]   The spectral separation factor SSF was found to be an excellent measure to characterize a pigmented Inkjet ink, as it takes into account properties related to light-absorption (e.g. wavelength of maximum absorbance Amax,<br>
37<br>
 <br>
shape of the absorption spectrum and absorbance-value at Amax) as well as properties related to the dispersion quality and stability.<br>
[0191]  A measurement of the absorbance at a higher wavelength gives an<br>
indication on the shape of the absorption spectrum. The dispersion quality can be evaluated based on the phenomenon of light scattering induced by solid particles in solutions. When measured in transmission, light scattering in pigment inks may be detected as an increased absorbance at higher wavelengths than the absorbance peak of the actual pigment. The dispersion stability can be evaluated by comparing the SSF before and after a heat treatment of e.g. a week at 80°C.<br>
[0192]  The spectral separation factor SSF of the ink is calculated by using the data of the recorded spectrum of an ink solution or a jetted image on a substrate and comparing the maximum absorbance to the absorbance at a higher reference wavelength Aref. The spectral separation factor is calculated as the ratio of the maximum absorbance Amax over the absorbance Aref at a reference wavelength.<br>
 <br>
[0193]   The SSF is an excellent tool to design inkjet ink set s with large colour<br>
gamut. Often inkjet ink set s are now commercialized, wherein the different inks are not sufficiently matched with each other. For example, the combined absorption of all inks does not give a complete absorption over the whole visible spectrum, e.g. "gaps" exist between the absorption spectra of the colorants. Another problem is that one ink might be absorbing in the range of another ink. The resulting colour gamut of these inkjet ink set s is low or mediocre.<br>

Measurement methods<br>
1. Measurement of SSF<br>
42<br>
 <br>
[0201]   The spectral separation factor SSF of an ink was calculated by using the data of the recorded spectrum of an ink solution and comparing the maximum absorbance to the absorbance at a reference wavelength. The choice of this reference wavelength is dependent on the pigment(s) used:<br>
•	if the colour ink has a maximum absorbance Amax between 400 and 500 nm then the absorbance Aref must be determined at a reference wavelength of 600 nm,<br>
•	If the colour ink has a maximum absorbance Amax between 500 and 600 nm then the absorbance Aref must be determined at a reference wavelength of 650 nm,<br>
•	If the colour ink has a maximum absorbance Amax between 600 and 700 nm then the absorbance Aref must be determined at a reference wavelength of 830 nm.<br>
[0202]   The absorbance was determined in transmission with a Shimadzu<br>
UV-2101 PC double beam-spectrophotometer. The Inkjet inks were diluted with ethyl acetate to have a pigment concentration according to Table 1.<br>

[0203]   A spectrophotometric measurement of the UV-VIS-NIR absorption<br>
spectrum of the diluted ink was performed in transmission-mode with a double beam-spectrophotometer using the settings of Table 2. Quartz cells with a path length of 10 mm were used and ethyl acetate was chosen as a blank.<br>

[0204]   Efficient pigment inkjet inks exhibiting a narrow absorption spectrum and a<br>
high maximum absorbance have a value for SSF of at least 30. 2. Average particle size (BI90)<br>
[0205]  The average particle size diameter was determined with a Brookhaven instruments Particle Sizer BIQOplus based upon the principle of dynamic light scattering. The ink or dispersion was diluted with ethyl acetate to a pigment concentration of 0.002 wt%. The measurement settings of the BI90plus were: 5 runs at 23°C, angle of 90°, wavelength of 635 nm and graphics = correction function.<br>
2.	Average particle size (Malvern)<br>
[0206]  The particle size of pigment particles in pigment inkjet ink was determined by photon correlation spectroscopy at a wavelength of 633 nm with a 4mW HeNe laser on a diluted sample of the pigment inkjet ink. The particle size analyzer used was a Malvern™ nano-S available from Goffin-Meyvis.<br>
[0207]  The sample was prepared by addition of one drop of ink to a cuvet<br>
containing 1.5 mL ethyl acetate and mixed until a homogenous sample was obtained. The measured particle size is the average value of 3 consecutive measurements consisting of 6 runs of 20 seconds. For good ink jet characteristics (jetting characteristics and print quality) the average particle size of the dispersed particles is below 200 nm, preferably about 100 nm. The pigment inkjet ink is considered to be a stable pigment dispersion if the particle size remained below 200 nm after a heat treatment of 7 days at 80°C.<br>
3.	Viscosity<br>
[0208]  The viscosity of the inkjet inks was measured using a Brookfield DV-II+ viscometer at 25°C and shear rate of 15 RPM.<br>
4.	Pigment dispersion stability<br>
[0209]  The dispersion stability was evaluated by comparing the SSF before and after a heat treatment of one week at 80°C. The decrease of SSF of pigmented inkjet inks exhibiting good dispersion stability should preferably be less than 15%.<br>
5. WtotN<br>
44<br>
 <br>
[0210]   The nitrogen content of a polymer was determined according to DIN<br>
IS013878 (Bodenbeschaffenheit, Bestimmung des Gesamt-Stickstoffs durch trockene Verbrennung).<br>
6.	NAmide<br>
[0211]  The amine content Namine of the polymeric dispersant, expressed as mol amine/100 g of polymeric dispersant, can be determined through potentiometric titration in a mixture of CHsCOOHTHF (14.5:0.5) with 0.1N aqueous perchloric acid. The mole% nitrogen present as an amide bond NAmide based upon the total nitrogen content WtotN of the polymeric dispersant is found by the following formula:<br>
NAmide = 100 X [ (WtotN/14) - Namine ] / [ WtotN/14 ]<br>
7.	WTPOAC<br>
[0212]  The WTPOAC is calculated by the formula:<br>
WTPOAC = [100 - (WtotN x 43)/14 ] / [WtotN - (Namine X 14)] .<br>

Synthesis of the TPQAC-acid PE1<br>
[0214]  The TPOAC-acid PE1 (LAi-eCapi2.4-co-dVal6.2) was prepared according to the following procedure: a mixture of 30.0 g Laurie acid (0.15 mol, Acres Organics), 205.4 g epsilon Caprolactone (1.800 mol, Acros Organics) and 90.1 g delta Valerolactone (0.90 mol, Acros Organics) is heated to 100"C and degassed with N2 during 30 min. 1.35 g Zirconium IV isopropoxide isopropanol complex (3.5 mmol, Aldrich) is added and the mixture is heated to 170°C. After 6 hours stirring at 170°C the mixture is cooled.<br>
[0215]   Other TPOAC-acids were prepared according to the same procedure, but<br>
using the amounts (in g) as indicated in Table 3.<br>

[0216]   Polymeric dispersant PD4 was prepared according to the following procedure: a mixture of 108.0 g TPOAC-acid PE1 and 18.0 g polyethyleneimine (PEI) Epomin SP200 (Nippon Shokubai, molecular weight 10000 g/mol on the label) is heated to 120°C. It is stirred for 6 hours under a constant N2 flow. After 6 hours stirring at 120°C the mixture is cooled. [0217]  The other polymeric dispersants PD1 to PD9 were prepared according to the same procedure, but using amounts (in g) as indicated in Table 4.<br>

Polymeric dispersant S35Q00<br>
[0218]   SOLSPERSE™ 35100 is a hyperdispersant used in highly concentrated paints. This hyperdispersant is only available as a 40 wt% solution in butyl acetate. [0219]   The polymeric dispersant S35000 was obtained by a specific request to the manufacturer NOVEON , to deliver a batch of the same polymeric dispersant SOLSPERSE™ 35100 but without addition of butyl acetate or other solvents.

 <br>
[0220]   For each polymeric dispersant, the values were determined for Wtot N and NAmine and subsequently the WTPGAG and NAmidewere calculated. The results are given by Tabje 5.<br>

[0221]  The difference between the polymeric dispersants S35000 and S35100, although it is the same polymer, can be understood by taking into account that polymeric dispersant S35100 had to be heated for removing the butyl acetate. This heating leads to extra hydrolyzis and transamidation decreasing the polyester chain length (smaller WTPGAG) and increasing the number of polyester chains (NAmide).<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0222]  This example illustrates that non-aqueous inkjet inks in accordance to the present invention can be prepared with consistent quality using batches of C.I. Pigment Yellow 120 exhibiting differences in production batch quality.<br>
Preparation of inkjet inks<br>
[0223]   All inkjet inks were prepared in the same manner to obtain a composition as described in Table 6, except that different batches of PY120 or a different polymeric dispersant were used.<br>

[0224]   A milling mixture with 15 wt% pigment and 15 wt% polymeric dispersant was prepared by adding the pigment PY120 and the polymeric dispersant to the dispersion solvent DEGDEE. The milling mixture was then milled under cooling by a NETZSCH™ LABSTAR1 at a 50 %volume filling with yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide-beads of 0.4 mm diameter ("high wear resistant zirconia grinding media" from TOSOH Co.) and a residence time of 45 minutes.<br>
[0225]  The comparative non-aqueous Inkjet inks COMP-1 to C0MP-7and the inventive non-aqueous Inkjet inks INV-1 and INV-7 were then prepared according to Table 7 by adding 65 parts by weight of DEGDEE to 35 parts by weight of the milling mixture under stirring at room temperature.<br>
Evaluation of ink-jet inks<br>
[0226]   The average particle size (BI90) and the viscosity of the comparative non¬aqueous Inkjet inks COMP-1 to COMP-7 and the inventive non-aqueous Inkjet inks INV-1 to IN\/-7 was determined.<br>

[0227]   From Table 7, it should be clear that a consistent production of an Inkjet ink comprising C.I. Pigment Yellow 120 was only possible with the polymeric dispersant S35100 which has a WTPOAC of 58 and a NAmioe of 73 mol%.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
[0228]  This example illustrates the effects of the design of the polymeric<br>
dispersant on the quality and dispersion stability of Inkjet inks comprising PY120.<br>
Preparation of Inkjet inks<br>
[0229]  All Inkjet inks were prepared in the same manner to obtain a composition as described in Table 8, except that different polymeric dispersants were used according to Table 9. All inks were prepared from the same batch of PY120.<br>

[0230]   An ink composition was made by mixing the pigment, the polymeric dispersant and the organic solvent DEGDEE with a dissolver and subsequently treating this mixture with a roller mill procedure using yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide-beads of 0.4 mm diameter ("high wear resistant zirconia grinding media" from TOSOH Co.). A polyethylene flask of 60mL was filled to half its volume with grinding beads and 20 mL of the mixture. The flask was closed with a lit and put on the roller mill for three days. The speed was set at 150 rpm. After milling the dispersion was separated from the beads using a filter cloth.<br>

[0232]   FromTable 9 , it should be clear that a stable non-aqueous inkjet ink comprising PY120 could only be prepared using polymeric dispersants having WTPOAC &gt; 57 and NAmide= 65 mol%. The comparative non-aqueous inkjet inks COMP-8 to COMP-16 using a polymeric dispersants fulfilling either only one or none of the conditions were found to be unstable.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
[0233]  This example illustrates the preparation of a non-aqueous inkjet ink set using PY180 as the benzimidazolone pigment.<br>
Preparation and evaluation of inkjet inks<br>
[0234]   All inkjet inks were prepared in the same manner as in EXAMPLE 2, except that different pigments were used in combination with the same polymeric dispersant S35000 to obtain inks for making a CMYK inkjet ink set. For preparing the concentrated pigment dispersion of PV19/PR202 a combination of 13.5 wt% of the pigment PV19/PR202 and 1.5 wt% of the<br>
50<br>
 <br>
dispersion synergist QAD-3 was used instead of 15 wt% of the pigment PY120inTable_6.<br>

[0236]  Although all the magenta pigments comprise a quinacridone structure, it was observed that only a pigment comprising the unsubsituted quinacridone structure of C.I. Pigment Violet 19 could be dispersed with a suitable viscosity for a magenta Inkjet ink.<br>
[0237]   The viscosity and average particle size (BI90) of the Inkjet inks Magenta-1 and Magenta-2 were measured again after 1 day and 28 days storage at roomtemperature.<br>

[0238]   Table 11 shows that the non-aqueous Inkjet ink Magenta-1 comprising a di-methyl substituted quinacridone exhibited poor dispersion stability.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
[0239]   This example illustrates that non-aqueous inkjet inks comprising yellow<br>
pigments of the benzimidazolone class exhibit superior dispersion stability and quality compared to other type of yellow pigments.<br>

[0240]  All inkjet inks were prepared in the same manner as in EXAMPLE 2,<br>
except that different yellow pigments were used in combination with the<br>

same polymeric dispersant S35000. The average particle size (Malvern) and the viscosity was determined.<br>

[0241]   From Table 12, it is surprising to see that only the benzimidazolone pigments could be dispersed into a non-aqueous Inkjet ink using the polymeric dispersant S35000.<br>
[0242]   Even the pigment PY213 bearing a large similarity in chemical structure with PY120, the major difference being the replacement of the benzimidazolone group of PY120 by a dioxo-quinoxaline group in PY213, could not be adequately dispersed into an ink.<br>
