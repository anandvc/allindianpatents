The present invention relates to compounds having the general formula (I) with the definitions of A, X, Ri -R4 given below, and/or a salt or ester thereof. <br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to the use of said compounds for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and their use for the modulation of y-secrelase activity.<br>
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by loss of memory, cognition, and behavioral stability. AD afflicts 6-10% of the population over age 65 and up to 50% over age 85. It is the leading cause of dementia and the third leading cause of death after cardiovascular disease and cancer. There is currently no effective treatment for AD. The total net cost related to AD in the U.S. exceeds $100 billion annually.<br>
AD does not have a simple etiology, however, it has been associated with certain risk factors including (1) age, (2) family history (3) and head trauma; other factors include environmental toxins and low level of education. Specific neuropathological lesions in the limbic and cerebral cortices include intracellular neurofibrillary tangles consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau protein and the extracellular deposition of fibrillar aggregates of amyloid beta peptides (amyloid plaques). The major component of amyloid plaques are the amyloid beta (A-beta, Abeta or AB) peptides of various lengths. A variant thereof, which is the ABl-42-peptide (Abeta-42). is believed to be the major causative agent for amyloid formation. Another variant is the ABl-40-peptide (Abeta-40). Amyloid beta is the proteolytic product of a precursor protein, beta amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP or APP).<br>
Familial, early onset autosomal dominant forms of AD have been linked to missense mutations in the P-amyloid precursor protein (p-APP or APP) and in the presenilin proteins 1 and 2. In some patients, late onset forms of AD have been correlated with a specific allele of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene, and, more recently, the finding of a mutation in alpha2-macroglobulin, which may be linked to at least 30% of the AD population. Despite this heterogeneity, all forms of AD exhibit similar pathological findings.  Genetic analysis has provided the best clues for a logical therapeutic approach<br>
 <br>
to AD. All muiations. found lo date, affect the quantitative or qualitative production of the aniyloidogenic peptides known as Abeta-peptides (Ap), specifically Ap42, and have given strong support to the "amyloid cascade hypothesis" of AD (Tanzi and Bertram. 2005, Cell 120. 545). The likely link between Ap peptide generation and AD pathology emphasizes the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms of Ap production and strongly warrants a therapeutic approach at modulating Ap levels. The release of Ap peptides is modulated by at least two proteolytic activities referred to as p- and y- secretase cleaving at the N-terminus (Met-Asp bond) and the C-terminus (residues 37-42) of the Ap peptide, respectively. In the secretory pathway, there is evidence that p-secretase cleaves first, leading to the secretion of s-APPp (sp) and the retention of a I ( kDa membrane-bound carboxy terminal fragment (CTF). The latter is believed to give rise to Ap peptides following cleavage by y-secretase. The amount of the longer isoform, AM2, is selectively increased in patients carrying certain mutations in a particular protein (presenilJn), and these muiations have been correlated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, Ali42 is believed by many researchers to be the main culprit of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
It has now become clear that the y-secretase activity cannot be ascribed to a single particular protein, but is in fact associated with an assembly of different proteins. The gamma-secretase activity resides within a multiprotein complex containing at least four components: the presenilin (PS) heterodjmer, nicastrin, aph-1 and pen-2. The PS heterodimer consists of the amino- and carboxyterminal PS fragments generated by endoproteolysis of the precursor protein. The two aspartates of the catalytic site are at the interface of this heterodimer. It has recently been suggested that nicastrin serves as a gamma-secreiase-substrate receptor. The functions of the other members of gamma-secretase are unknown, but they are all required for activity (Steiner, 2004. Curr. Alzheimer Research 1(3): 175-181).<br>
Thus, although the molecular mechanism of the second cleavage-step has remained elusive until present, the y-secretase-complex has become one of the prime targets in the search for compounds for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
 <br>
Various strategies have been proposed for targeting gamma-secretase in Alzheimer's disease, ranging from targeting the catalytic site directly, developing substrate-specific inhibitors and modulators of gamma-secretase activity (Marjaux et a!., 2004. Drug Discovery Today: Therapeutic Strategies. Volume I, !-6). Accordingly, a variety of compounds were described that have secretases as targets {Lamer, 2004. Secretases as therapeutics targets in Alzheimer's disease; patents 2000 - 2004. Expert Opin. Ther. Patents 14, 1403-1420.)<br>
Indeed, this finding was recently supported by biochemical studies in which an effect of certain NSAIDs on y-secrelase was shown (Weggen et al (2001) Nature 414, 6860, 212 and WO 01/7872! and US 2002/0128319; Morihara et al (2002) J. Neurochem. 83, 1009; Eriksen (2003) .1. Clin. Invest. 112 , 440). Potential limitations for the use of NSAIDs to prevent or treat AD are their inhibition activity of Cox enzymes, which can lead to unwanted side effects, and their low CNS penetration (Peretto et al., 2005, J, Med. Chem. 48, 5705-5720).<br>
Thus, there is a strong need for novel compounds which modulate y-secretase activity thereby opening new avenues for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide such compounds. The object is achieved by a compound having the general Formula (i)<br>

The structure of the metabolites of the compounds according to the invention will be obvious to any person skilled in the art, using the various appropriate methods.<br>
The compounds according to general formula (I) can be prepared according to methods published in the literature or by analogous methods.<br>
Depending on the circumstances of the individual case, in order to avoid side reactions during the synthesis of a compound of the general formula (I), it can be necessary or advantageous to temporarily block functional groups by introducing protective groups and to deprotect them in a later stage of the synthesis, or to introduce functional groups in the form of precursor groups and at a later stage to convert them into the desired functional groups. Suitable synthetic strategies, protective groups and precursor groups are known to the person skilled in tlie art.<br>
If desired, the compounds of the formula (1) can be purified by customary purification procedures, for example by recrystallization or chromatography. The starting materials for the preparation of the compounds of the formula (I) are commercially available or can be prepared according to or analogously to literature procedures.<br>
These can serve as a basis for the preparation of the other compounds according to the invention by several methods well known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
The invention also relates to a compound of the invention for use as a medicament. The compounds are as defined above, furthermore with respect to the medicament the embodiments as desn'bed below with respect to the use of the invention, e.g. formulation, application and combination, also apply to this aspect of the invention.<br>
In particular the compounds according to the invention are suitable for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Details relating to said use are further disclosed below.<br>
The compounds can be used for modulation of y-secretase activity.<br>
 <br>
As used herein, the term "modulation of y-secretase activity" refers to an effect on the processing of APP by the y-secretase-comp!ex. Preferably it refers to an effect in which the overall rate of processing of APP remains essentially as without the application of said compounds, but in which the relative quantities of the processed products are changed, more preferably in such a way that the amount of the AB42-peplide produced is reduced. For example a different Abeta species can be produced (e.g. Abeta-38 or other Abeta peptide species of shorter amino acid sequence instead of Abeta-42) or the relative quantities of the products are different (e.g. the ratio of Abeta-40 to Abeta-42 is changed, preferably increased).<br>
Gamma secretase activity can e.g. be measured by determining APP processing, e.g. by determining the levels of Abeta petide species produced, most importantly levels of<br>
It has been previously shown that the y-secretase complex is also involved in the processing of the Notch-protein. Notch is a signaling protein which plays a crucial role in developmental processes (e.g. reviewed in SchweisguthF (2004) Curr. Biol. 14, RI29).<br>
With respect to the use of said compounds for the modulation of y-secretase activity in therapy, it seems particularly advantageous not to interfere with the Notch-processing activity of the y-secretase activity in order to avoid putative undesired side-effects.<br>
Thus, compounds are preferred u'hich do not show an effect on the Notch-processing activity of the y-secretase-comp!ex.<br>
Within the meaning of the invention, "eifeci on the Notch processing activity" includes both an inhibition or an activation of the Notch-processing activity by a certain factor.<br>
A compound is defined as not having an effect on the Notch processing activity, if said factor is smaller than 20, preferably smaller than 10, more preferably smaller than 5, most preferably smaller than 2 in the respective assay as described in Shimizu et al (2000) Mol. Cell. Biol, 20: 6913 at a concentration of 30 |iM.<br>
Such a y-secretase modulation can be carried out, e.g. in animals such as mammals. Exemplary mammals are mice, rats, guinea pigs, monkeys, dogs, cats. The modulation can also be carried out in humans. In a particular embodiment of the invention, said<br>
 <br>
modulation is performed in vitro or in cell culture. As known to the person skilled in the art, several in vitro and cell culture assays are available.<br>
Exemplary assays useful for measuring the prodction of C-terminal APP fragments in cell lines or transgenic animals by Western blot analysis include but are not limited to those described in Yan et al., 1999, Nature 402, 533-537.<br>
An example of an in vitro y-secretase assay is described in WO-03/008635. In this assay a suitable peptide substrate is contacted with a y-secrelase preparation and the ability to cleave the substrate is measured.<br>
Concentrations of the various products of the y-secretase cleavage (the A6-peptides) can be determined by various methods known to a person skilled in the art. Examples for such inethods include determination of the peptides by mass-spectrometry or detection by antibodies.<br>
Exemplary assays useful for the characterization of the profile of soluble Abeta peptides in cultured cell media and biological fluids include but are not limited to those described by Wang et al., 1996, J. Biol. Chem. 271, 31894-31902. In this assay a combination of immunoprecipitation of Abeta-peptides with specific antibodies and detection and quantification of the peptide species with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-fiight mass spectrometr&gt;' is used.<br>
Exemplary assays usefUl for measuring the production of .Abeta-40 and Abeta-42 peptides by ELISA include but are not limited to those described in Vassar et al, 1999, Science 286, 735-741. Further information is disclosed for example in N. Ida et al. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 22908, and M. Jensen et al. (2000) Mol. Med. 6, 291. Suitable antibodies are available for example from The Genetics Company, Inc., Switzerland. Antibody-based kits are also available from Innogenetics, Belgium.<br>
Cells which can be employed in such assays include cells which endogenously express the y-secretase complex and transfected cells which transiently or stably express some or all interactors of the y-secretase complex. Numerous available cell lines suitable for such assays are known to the skilled person. Cells and cell lines of neuronal or glial origin are<br>
 <br>
particularly suitable. Furthermore, cells and tissues of the brain as well as iiomogenates and membrane preparations thereof may be used (Xia et al.. 1998, Biochemistry 37. 16465-16471).<br>
Such assays might be carried out for example to study Che effect of the compounds according to the invention in different experimental conditions and configurations.<br>
Furthermore, such assays might be carried out as part of functional studies on the y-secretase complex.<br>
For example, either one or more interactors (either in their wild-type form or carrying certain mutations and/or modifications) of the y-secretase complex of an animal, preferably a mammal, more preferably humans, might be expressed in certain cell lines and the effect of the compounds according to the invention might be studied.<br>
Mutated forms of the interactor(s) used can either be mutated forms which have been described in certain animals, preferably mammals, more preferably humans or mutated forms which have not previously been described in said animals.<br>
Modifications of the interactors of the y-secretase complex include both any physiological modification of said interactors and other modifications which have been described as modifications of proteins in a biological system.<br>
Examples of such modifications include, but are noi limited to, glycosyJation. phosphorylation, prenylation, myristylation and famesylation.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds according to the invention can be used for the preparation of a medicament for the modulation of y-secretase activity.<br>
The invention further relates to the use of said compounds for the preparation of a medicament for the modulation of y-secretase activity.<br>
The activity of the y-secretase can be modulated in different ways, i.e. resulting in different profiles of the various AB-peptides.<br>
 <br>
Uses of a compound for the modulation of 7-secretase activity resulting in a decrease in the relative amount of AB42-peptides produced are preferred.<br>
Respective dosages, routes of administration, formulations etc are disclosed further below.<br>
The invention further relates to the use of the compounds according to the invention for the treatment of a disease associated with an elevated level of AM2-production. The disease with elevated levels of Abeta peptide production and deposition in the brain is typically Alzheimer's disease (AD), cerebral amyloid angiopathy, multi-infarct dementia, dementia pugilistica or Down syndrome, preferably AD.<br>
As used herein, the term "treatment" is intended to refer to all processes, wherein there may be a slowing, interrupting, arresting, or stopping of the progression of a disease, but does not necessarily indicate a total elimination of all symptoms.<br>
As used herein, the term "elevated level of A642-production" refers to a condition in which the rate of production of AB42-peptide is increased due to an overall increase in the processing of APP or, preferably, it refers to a condition in which the production of the AB42 peptide is increased due to a modification of the APP-processing profile in comparison to the wild-type APP and non-pathological situation.<br>
As outlined above, such an elevated A642-]evel is a haJimark of patients developing or suffering from Alzheimer's disease.<br>
One advantage of the compounds or a part of the compounds of the present invention may lie in their enhanced CNS-penetration.<br>

Ap42 lowering agents of the invention can be used to treat AD in mammals such as humans or alternatively in a validated animal model such as the mouse, rat, or guinea pig. The mammal may not be diagnosed with AD, or may not have a genetic predisposition for AD, but may be transgenic such that it overproduces and eventually deposits Ap in a manner similar to that seen in humans afflicted with AD..<br>
Ap42 lowering agents can be administered in any standard form using any standard method. For example, but not limited to, Ap42 lowering agents can be in the form of liquid, tablets or capsules that are taken orally or by injection. A|342 lowering agents can be administered at any dose that is sufficient to significantly reduce levels of Ap42 in the blood, blood plasma, serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or brain.<br>
To determine whether acute administration of an Ap42 lowering agent would reduce AP42 levels in vivo, non-transgenic rodents, e.g. mice or rats can be used. Alternatively, two to three month old Tg2576 mice expressing APP695 containing the "Swedish" variant can be used or a transgenic mouse mode! developed by Dr. Fred Van Leuven (K..U.Leuven, Belgium) and co-workers, with neuron-specific expression of a clinical mutant of the human amyloid precursor protein [V717I] (Moechars et ah, 1999 J. Biol. Chem. 274, 6483). The single transgenic mouse displays spontaneous, progressive accumulation of p-amyloid (Ap) in the brain, eventually resulting in amyloid plaques within subicuium, hippocampus and cortex. Animals of this age have high levels of AP in the brain but no detectable Ap deposition. Mice treated with the Ap42 lowering agent will be examined and compared to those untreated or treated with vehicle and brain levels of soluble Ap42 and total Ap would be quantitated by standard techniques, for example, using ELISA. Treatment periods may vary from hours to days and will be adjusted based on the results of the Ap42 lowering once a time course of onset of effect can be established.<br>
A typical protocol for measuring Ap42 lowering in vivo is shown but il is only one of many variations that could be used to optimize the levels of detectable Ap. For example, aliquots of compounds can be dissolved in DMSO (volume equal to 1/10th of the final<br>
 <br>
formulation volume), vortexed and further diluted (!.)0) with a 10 % (w/v) hydroxypropyl p cyclodextrin (HBC. Aldrich, Ref N° 33,260-7) solution in PBS, where after they are sonicated for 20 seconds.<br>
AP42 lowering agents may be administered as a single oral dose given three to four hours before sacrifice and analysis or allematively could be given over a course of days and the animals sacrificed three to four hours after the final dose is given.<br>
Blood is collected at sacrifice. The blood collection is performed via a heart puncture during anesthesia with a mixture of Ketaiar (Ketamin), Rompun (Xylazin 2%) and Atropin (2:1:1) and collected in EDTA treated collection tubes. Blood is centrifuged at 4000 g for 5 minutes at 4°C and the plasma recovered for analysis.<br>
The mice are anaesthetized with a mixture of Ketalar (Ketamin), Rompun (Xylazin 2%) and AtFopin (2:1:1) and flushed trans-cardialiy with physiological serum at 4°C.<br>
The brain is removed from the cranium and hindbrain and forebrain are separated with a cut in the coronal/frontal plane. The cerebellum is removed. The forebrain is divided evenly into left and right hemisphere by using a midline sagitai cut.<br>
One hemisphere is immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C until homogenization for biochemical assays.<br>
Brains are homogenized using a Potter, a glass tube (detergent free 2 cm ) and a mechanical homogenizer (650 rpm). A volume of 6,5 x '/s brain weight of freshly prepared 20 mM Tris/HCI buffer (pH 8,5) with Proteinase Inhibitors (I tablet per 50 ml Tris/HCI buffer, CompleteTM, Roche, Mannheim, Germany) is used as homogenization buffer.<br>
Samples are transferred from -70°C into a sample holder with liquid nitrogen and each individual sample is pre-warmed by incubation on the bench for a few seconds prior to homogenization. The homogenates are collected in Beckman centrifuge tubes TLX and collected on ice prior to centrifugation. Between two samples, the Potter and the glass<br>
 <br>
tube are rinsed carefully with distilled water without determents and dried with absorption paper.<br>
Samples are centrifuged in a pre-cooied ultracentrifuge (Beckman, Mannheim, Germany) for 1 hour and 20 minutes at 48000 rpm (135.000 x g) at 4°C, The supernatant (soluble fraction containing secreted APP and amyloid peptides) is separated from the pellet (membrane fraction containing membrane-bound APP-fragments and plaque-associated amyloid peptides in case of aged mice).<br>
Small reversed phase columns (CI8-Sep-Paclc Vac 3cc cartridges. Waters, Massachusetts, MA) are mounted on a vacuum system and washed with 80% acetonitrile in 0,1% Trifluoroacetic acid (A-TFA) followed with 0,1% TFA twice. Then the samples are applied and the columns are washed successively with 5% and 25% A-TFA. Amyloid peptides are eluted with 75% A-TFA and the eluates are collected in 2 ml tubes on ice. Eluates are freeze-dried in a speedvac concentrator (Savant, Farmlngdale, NY) overnight and resolved in 240 ji! of the sample diluent furnished with the ELISA kits.<br>
To quantify the amount of human A|3-42 in the soluble fraction of the brain homogenaies. commercially available Enzyme-Linked-lmmunosorbent-Assay (ELISA) kits are used (h Amyloid |342 ELISA high sensitive. The Genetics Company, Zurich, Switzerland). The ELISA is performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the standard (a dilution of synthetic A|31-42) and samples are prepared in a 96-well polypropylene plate without protein binding capacity (Greiner bio-one, Frickenhausen, Germany). The standard dilutions with final concentrations of 1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.3 and 15.6 pg/ml and the samples are prepared in the sample diluent, furnished with the ELISA kit, to a final volume of 60 \x\. Samples, standards and blancs (50 fil) are added to the anti-Ap-coated polystyro! plate (capture antibody selectively recognizes the C-terminal end of the antigen) in addition with a selective anti-AP-antibody conjugate (biotinylated detection antibody) and incubated overnight at 4°C in order to allow formation of the antibody-Amyloid-antibody-complex. The following day, a Streptavidine-Peroxidase-Conjugale is added, followed 30 minutes later by an addition of TMB/peroxide mixture, resulting in the conversion of the substrate into a colored product. This reaction is<br>
 <br>
stopped by the addition of sulfuric acid (IM) and the color intensity is measured by means of photometry with an ELISA-reader with a 450 nm filter. Quantification of the Abeta content of the samples is obtained by comparing absorbance to a standard curve made with synthetic Api-42.<br>
In such a model at least 20% A642 lowering compared to untreated animals would be advantageous.<br>
