Root for strip<br>
The invention relates to a reel for strip for the winding of hot-rolled or cold-rolled strip Into a coil with pressure rollers, deflection shells and an intake shaft.<br>
With such reels for strip, the pressure rollers are driven and are located with the deflection shells on swivel systems which are moved by hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders and are mounted swlvellably round a pivot in such a way that they can be swivelled towards the reel mandrel or away from it. The pressure rollers and deflection shells serve to guide the first windings of the strip to be wound round the reel mandrel and. In conjunction with the retro-expansion of the reel mandrel, to produce the friction lock between strip and reel mandrel in order subsequently to wind the strip under tension with swlvelled-out pressure rollers and deflection shells. The pressure rollers have moreover the task of holding the outer winding at the end of the winding procedure.<br>
The strip to be deflected by the deflection shells is pressed as a result of centrifugal forces and bending forces Into the curved contour of the deflection shell. A friction force occurs thereby which sets a resistance counter to the transport motion of the strip. This friction force can. in particular with thin strips on account of their low buckling strength, lead to the strip buckling, being caught between reel mandrel and deflection shells In the reel and the winding procedure having to be disconlinued.<br><br>
The invention is based on the technical problem of configuring a reel for strip in such a way that hot-rolled or cold-rolled strip can be wound securely on the reel mandrel even at higher speeds and with lesser thicknesses.<br>
For this purpose it is proposed that the deflection shells have channels whose outlet openings are located In the shell area and that the channels are connected to a medium-supply system.<br>
The emerging medium provides during the deflection of the strip for a reduction of the friction force between strip and shell. It exerts. In particular when the characteristic of claim 2 Is realized, forces onto the strip, the components of which forces are directed Into the running direction of the strip as well as onto the reel mandrel. By this means the strip is led onto the expanding reel mandrel. The strip is moreover transported forwards by the driven pressure rollers which it contacts through frlctlonal locking, so that break-out of the strip is prevented. At the end of the winding procedure, the outer winding of the coil is pressed onto the coll by the pressure rollers, whereby the pressure rollers are driven at a slightly lower speed than the strip speed and thus prevent the strip end from flapping round the coll.<br>
As a medium with which the channels of the deflection shells are supplied, water or compressed air respectively has stood the test. If a medium-supply line is provided for more than one channel, it is sufficient to lay to them a flexible line which is able to counterbalance the swinging motion of the shells.<br>
It has also proved advantageous if the pressure rollers are configured as comb rollers, the outlet openings of the channels are directed onto the comb gaps of the comb rollers following in the running direction of the<br>
strip and pressure medium Is supplied via the comb gaps to the deflection shells following in the running direction of the strip.<br><br>
The complete following deflection shell Is thus flooded with pressure medium so that the strip start driven by centrifugal forces against the shells is carried along by medium and the strip start is thus held away from the deflection shells,<br>
In order to guarantee the secure transport of the strip running into the reel. It is moreover proposed to connect the shaft flap and possibly also other parts of the reel Intake shaft to the medium-supply system and to make the medium flow through openings In the guide surfaces onto the incoming strip in order to reduce the friction and to guarantee secure transport.<br>
The invention Is explained In further detail by means of a drawing In which<br>
Figure 1	in      diagrammatic      form      and      in      cross-sectional<br>
representation a reel for strip according to the invention, and<br>
Figure 2	shows a reel for strip according to the invention with comb<br>
rollers.<br>
Figure 1 shows a reel 1 which consists of a reel mandrel 2 to which pressure rollers 6, 7. 8 held on brackets 3, 4. 5 are allocated, whereby the brackets 3, 4, 5 moreover support deflection shells 9, 10, 11. The brackets 3,4,5 are drivable swivellably round pivots by means of piston-cylinder units 12, 13, 14 towards the reel mandrel 2 or away from it respectively.<br>
The brackets 3, 4. 5 are hollow In their configuration and have pressure chambers 15, 16, 17 for the medium, e.g. water or compressed air. From the pressure chambers 15,16, 17, channels 18 extend Into the deflection shells 9, 10, 11 and end at the surface of the deflection shells 9, 10, 11 facing the reel mandrel 2 In outlet openings 19 which are directed on<br><br>
the one hand In the running direction of the strip and on the other hand against the reel mandrel 7. Through the pressurizing of the deflection shells 9, 10. 11 with medium, the strip (not shown) transported between the reel mandrel 2 and the pressure rollers 6,7,8 can be pressed away from the deflection shells 9, 10, 11 against the reel mandrel 2.<br>
In the intake shaft 20, via which the strip (not shown) is fed to the reel 1, the shaft flap 21 has a pressure compartment 22 from which channels<br>
23 lead to outlet openings 24 via which the medium can be pressed against the Incoming strip for guide purposes.<br>
Figure 2 shows a reel V with which the pressure rollers 6'. 7', 8' are configured as comb rollers. The medium is sprayed from the outlet openings 19' of the deflection shells 9', 10', 11' or from the outlet opening 24' of the shaft flap 21' respectively through the gaps of the comb rollers onto the next deflection shell 9', 10', 11' in the running direction of the strip so that the deflection shells 9', 10', IT are completely pressurized by medium and the strip 25 running Into the reel V is thus kept optimally away from the deflection shells 9'. 10', 1 V,<br><br>
