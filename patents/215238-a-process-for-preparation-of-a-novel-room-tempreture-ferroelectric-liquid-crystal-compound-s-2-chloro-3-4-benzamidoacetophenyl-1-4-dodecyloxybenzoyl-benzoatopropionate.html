ADVANTAGES<br>
The room temperature ferroelectric liquid crystal compound .prepared by the process of this -invention )thich shows characteristic ferroelectric properties in an around room temperatures which is a rare phenomena, as the most of the reported ferroelectric compounds used for the applirational purposes are the mixtures of more than one component.<br>
The room temperature ferroelectric liquid crystal compound prepared by the process of this invention i» therefore useful for both fundamental as well  applied research aspects including for the non-linear optical applications. The room temperature ferroelectric liquid crystal compound can further be used as hat materials for the preparation of other FLC mixtures.<br>
The need for this type of room temperature ferroelectric materials aw strongly felt because the preparation and characterization of FLC mixtures is time consuming as well as expensive. These compound* prepared as .per the process of this invention can be 'directly used in the<br>
-i<br>
applinational  aspects such  as polarization  controller<br>
switching attenuators, vdisplay devices etc.<br>
The study of the fundamental ferroelectric properties viz, spontaneous polarization, tilt angle, time response etc., of the present invented compound reveals that<br>
the magnitude of these parameters are found to be of in good agreement with those of commercially available compounds. In fact some of the above properties envisage that this compound showed better physical characteristic than the commercially available compound.<br><br><br><br><br>

The reaction mixture was stirred for 16 h. The solution was then extracted with 40 ml of diethylether and the etherial layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate for 12 h. (S)-2-chloro-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid obtained as an yellow product on removing the excess solvent by distillation under reduced pressure was washed repeatedly with cold benzene, seperated by chromatography through a silica gel column using a mixture of diethylether : acetone (5:1 v/v) as eluent. The product was recrystallized from hot dichloromethane and dried over P2O5 for 12 h. to get an yield of 3.2 gram (53.2%).<br>
Step 2<br>
