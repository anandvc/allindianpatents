OPTICALLY ACTIVE BISOXAZOLINE COMPOUNDS, PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION OF THE SAME AND USE THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to optically active bisoxazoline compounds, process for production of the same and use thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
Methods for producing optically active cyclopropane compounds, which are very important compounds as synthesis intermediates of agricultural chemicals such as synthesized pyrethroid type insecticides, pharmaceuticals, etc., and whose representative example is (+)-2,2-dimethyl-3-(2-methyl-1-propenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylic acid, from prochiral olefins have been known as an asymmetric reaction using an optically active bisoxazoline compound as a ligand (e.g. JP 11-171874 A, Tetrahedron Lett., !32_, 7373 (1991)). These methods are relatively good in the<br>
diastereoselectivity (trans-isomer/cis-isomer ratio) and enantioselectivity.  However, from an industrial viewpoint, it is desired to further improve the yield of the desired optically active cyclopropane compounds.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br><br>
According to the present invention, an optically active bisoxazoline compound having naphthyl group as an asymmetric synthesis catalyst component can be easily obtained, and an optically active compound can be obtained at a high yield by using an industrially advantageous asymmetric catalyst comprising the optically active bisoxazoline compound and a copper compound.<br>
That is, the present invention provides an optically active bisoxazoline compound represented by the formula<br>
(1) :<br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are the same, and each represents a Ci~6 alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted aralkyl group, or a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl group, or R1 and R2 are bonded each other together with the carbon atom of the oxazoline ring to which they are bonded to form a ring; R3 represents a substituted or unsubstituted naphthyl group (preferably a 1-naphthyl group or a 2-naphthyl group); R4 and R5 are the same, and each represents a hydrogen atom or a Ci-6 alkyl group, or R4 and R5 are bonded each other together with the carbon atom to which they are bonded to form a cycloalkyl ring having 3 to 6 carbon atoms; and *<br><br>
represents an' asymmetric center; a process for production of the same and use thereof.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the present invention<br>
First, the optically active bisoxazoline compound represented by the formula (1) (hereinafter, simply referred to as the optically active bisoxazoline compound (1)), which is a novel compound, will be illustrated.<br>
Examples of the Ci-e alkyl group represented by R1 and R2 include straight chain or branched alkyl groups such as a methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, n-pentyl, and n~hexyl group, and as the ring formed by bonding R1 and R2 each other together with the carbon atom of the oxazoline ring to which they are bonded, cycloalkyl rings having 3 to 7 carbon atoms can be exemplified. Examples of the cycloalkyl ring include a cyclopropane ring, a cyclobutane ring, a cyclopentane ring, a cyclohexane ring, and a cycloheptane ring.<br>
Examples of the substituted or unsubstituted phenyl group represented by R1 and R2 include an unsubstituted phenyl group; a phenyl group substituted with a Ci-6 alkyl such as a 3-methylphenyl and 4-methylphenyl group; and a phenyl group substituted with a Ci-6 alkoxy group(e.g. a methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy, pentyloxy, and hexyloxy group) such as a 2-methoxyphenyl, 3-methoxyphenyl, and 4-<br><br>
methoxyphenyl group.<br>
As the substituted or unsubstituted aralkyl group, there is, for example, a Ci-6 alkyl group substituted with the above substituted or unsubstituted aryl group. Examples thereof include a benzyl, 2-methylbenzyl, 3-methylbenzyl, 4-methylbenzyl, 2-methoxybenzyl, 3-methoxybenzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl, 1-naphthylmethyl, and 2-naphthylmethyl group.<br>
In the formula representing the optically active bisoxazoline compound (1), as the substituted or unsubstituted naphthyl group represented by R3, in addition to an unsubstituted 1-naphthyl or 2-naphtyl group, there are, for example, a 1-naphthyl or 2-naphtyl group substituted with at least one Ci-6 alkyl or Ci~6 alkoxy group. Examples of the Ci-6 alkyl or Ci-6 alkoxy group include those exemplified with respect to the substituent R1 or R2. Specifically, there are, for example, a 4-fluoro-1-naphthyl, 2-methy1-1-naphthyl, 4-methyl-1-naphthyl, 2-methoxy-l-naphthyl, 2-ethoxy-l-naphthyl, 4-methoxy-l-naphthyl, 2,4-dimethoxy-1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, 7-methy1-2-naphthyl, 1-n-propyl-2-naphthyl, 6-methoxy-2-naphthyl, and 3,8-dimethoxy-2-naphthyl group.  Among them, 1-naphthyl and 2-naphthyl group are preferable.<br>
Examples of the Ci-6 alkyl group represented by R4 and R5 include a C1-3 alkyl group such as a methyl, ethyl, n-<br><br>
propyl, and isopropyl group, and a butyl, pentyl, and hexyl group.  As the ring formed by bonding R4 and R5 each other together with the carbon atom of the oxazoline ring to which they are bonded , cycloalkyl rings having 3 to 6 carbon atoms can be exemplified.  Examples of the cycloalkyl ring include a cyclopropane ring, a cyclobutane ring, a cyclopentane ring, and a cyclohexane ring. Preferably, R4 and R5 represent a hydrogen atom, a C1-3 alkyl group or  a cycloalkyl ring having 3 to 6 carbon atoms formed by bonding R4 and R5 each other together with the carbon atom of the oxazoline ring to which they are bonded, and more preferably, they represent a Ci_3 alkyl group.<br>
In the bisoxazoline compounds represented by the formula (1), there are two asymmetric carbon atoms represented by * and the compounds wherein both asymmetric carbon atoms are  (S), or (R) configurations are preferably used.<br>

The diastereomeric salt thus obtained can easily be converted into the optically active amino alcohol (30) as such or after purification by washing, recrystallization etc., followed by alkali treatment.<br>
The alkali treatment can be carried out usually by mixing the diastereomeric salt and an alkali and the mixing<br>
temperature is usually in a range of 0 to 100°C.  Examples of the alkali to be used include alkali metal hydroxides such as potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide and, usually, an aqueous solution thereof is used.  When an aqueous alkali solution is used, the concentration of the alkali is usually 1 to 50% by weight, preferably 3 to 20% by weight.  The amount of the alkali to be used is usually about 1 to 5 moles relative to 1 mole of the diastereomeric salt.<br><br>
When the diastereomeric salt is subjected to the alkali treatment, usually, the optically active amino alcohol (30) is separated as an oil layer or precipitated in the form of solids from the alkali-treated mass and the optically active amino alcohol (30) can be isolated as such, or the optically active amino alcohol (30) can be isolated by adding a water-insoluble organic solvent to the alkali-treated mass for extraction and distilling away the organic solvent from the organic layer obtained.  Examples of the water-insoluble organic solvent include ether solvents such as diethyl ether and methyl tert-butyl ether; ether solvents such as ethyl acetate; aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as toluene, xylene, and chlorobenzene; halogenated hydrocarbon solvents such as dichloromethane and chloroform, and the amount thereof to be used is usually in a range of 0.5 to 50 parts by weight relative to 1 part by weight of the diastereomeric salt used.  The water-insoluble organic solvent can be added previously at the time of alkali treatment of the diastereomeric salt.<br>
The optically active amino alcohol (30) can also be isolated by previously treating the diastereomeric salt with an acid and then subjecting to the alkali treatment. When the diastereomeric salt is previously treated with an acid, the optically active N-formylphenylalanine is released.  Then, preferably, the alkali treatment is<br><br>
carried out after separating the optically active N-formylphenylalanine released.<br>
The acid treatment is usually carried out by mixing the diastereomeric salt and an aqueous solution of an acid,<br>
and the mixing temperature is usually 0 to 100°C.  As the acid to be used, usually, there are an aqueous solution of a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid and the concentration is usually 1 to 50% by weight, preferably 5 to 40% by weight.  The amount of the acid to be used is usually 1 to 5 moles, preferably 1 to 2 moles relative to 1 mole of the diastereomeric salt.<br>
As the separation method of the optically active N-formylphenylalanine released, there is, for example, a method for extracting it by adding a water-insoluble organic solvent to the mass in which the diastereomeric salt is previously subjected to the acid treatment.  As the water-insoluble organic solvent, there are, for example, the same solvents as described above, and the amount thereof to be used is usually 0.5 to 20 part by weight to 1 part by weight of the diastereomeric salt used.  The water-insoluble organic solvent causes no problem even when it is previously added at the time of acid treatment of the diastereomeric salt.<br>
When a part or all of the released optically active N-formylphenylalanine is precipitated in the acid-treated<br><br>
mass, the mass can also be filtered as such or, if necessary, after further cooling, to separate the released optically active N-formylphenylalanine.<br>
In the alkali treatment to be carried out successively to the acid treatment, an aqueous solution of an alkali metal hydroxide such as potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide is used and the concentration of the solution is usually 1 to 50% by weight, preferably 5 to 20% by weight. The alkali is used in such an amount that pH of the mass to be treated becomes 10 or higher, and the treatment<br>
temperature is usually 0 to 100°C.<br>
When the alkali treatment of the diastereomeric salt is carried out after the previous acid treatment, the optically active amino alcohol (30) is usually separated as an oil layer or precipitated in the form of solids in the alkali-treated mass, and the oil layer or the solids can be isolated as such.  Alternatively, the optically active amino alcohol (30) can be isolated by adding a water-insoluble organic solvent to the alkali-treated mass for extraction and distilling away the organic solvent from the organic layer obtained.  As the water-insoluble organic solvent, there are, for example, the same solvents as described, and the amount thereof to be used is usually 0.5 to 50 parts by weight relative to 1 part by weight of the diastereomer salt used in the treatment.  The water-<br><br>
insoluble organic solvent can previously be added at the time of the alkali treatment.<br>
The optically active N-formylphenylalanine used can easily be recovered and the recovered optically active N-formylphenylalanine can be reused for the reaction of the amino alcohol (40) and the optically active N-formylphenylalanine.  When the diastereomeric salt is alkali-treated without being previously treated with an acid, the optically active N-formylphenylalanine can be recovered by acid treatment of the treated mass obtained after recovering the optically active amino alcohol (30). When the diastereomeric salt is alkali-treated after previous treatment with an acid, a part or all of the optically active N-formylphenylalanine is usually precipitated in the acid-treated mass obtained by the acid treatment and the mass is filtered as such or, if necessary, after further cooled to recover the optically active N-formylphenylalanine.  Alternatively, a water-insoluble organic solvent is added to the acid-treated mass for extraction and the organic solvent is distilled away from the organic layer obtained to recovery the optically active N-formylphenylalanine.  As the water-insoluble organic solvent, there are, for example, the same solvents as described above.  The water-insoluble organic solvent can be added previously at the time of acid treatment.<br><br>
