				<td>AN ELEVATOR<br>
The present invention relates to an elevator, preferably a machineroomless elevator.<br>
One of the objectives in elevator development work is to achieve an efficient and economical<br>
utilization of building space. In recent years, this development work has produced various elevator<br>
solutions without machine room, among other things. Good examples of elevators without machine<br>
room are disclosed in specifications EP 0 631 967 (A1) and EP 0 631 968. The elevators described in<br>
these specifications are fairly efficient in respect of space utilization as they have made it possible to<br>
eliminate the space required by the elevator machine room in the building without a need to enlarge<br>
the elevator shaft. In the elevators disclosed in these specifications, the machine is compact at least in<br>
one direction, but in other directions it may have much larger dimensions than a conventional<br>
elevator machine.<br>
In these basically good elevator solutions, the space required by the hoisting machine<br>
limits the freedom of choice in elevator lay-out solutions. Some space is needed to provide for<br>
the passage of the hoisting ropes. It is difficult to reduce the space required by the elevator car<br>
itself on its track and likewise the space required by the counterweight, at least at a reasonable<br>
cost and without impairing elevator performance and operational quality. In a traction sheave<br>
elevator without machine room, mounting the hoisting machine in the elevator shaft is difficult,<br>
especially in a solution with machine above, because the hoisting machine is a sizeable body of<br>
considerable weight. Especially in the case of larger loads, speeds and/or hoisting heights, the<br>
size and weight of the machine are a problem regarding installation, even so much so<br>
that the required machine size and weight have in<br>
practice limited the sphere of application of the con-<br>
cept of elevator without machine room or at least re-<br>
tarded the introduction of said concept in larger ele-<br>
vators. If the size of the machine and the traction<br>
sheave of the elevator is reduced, then a further<br>
problem is often the question of how to ensure a suf-<br>
ficient grip between the hoisting ropes and the trac-<br>
tion sheave.<br>
Specification WO 99/43589 discloses an elevator sus-<br>
pended using flat belts in which relatively small di-<br>
version diameters on the traction sheave and diverting<br>
pulleys are achieved. However, the problem with this<br>
solution is the limitations regarding lay-out solu-<br>
tions, the disposition of components in the elevator<br>
shaft and the alignment of diverting pulleys. Also,<br>
the alignment of polyurethane-coated belts having a<br>
load-bearing steel component inside is problematic<br>
e.g. in a situation where the car is tilted. To avoid<br>
undesirable vibrations, an elevator so implemented<br>
needs to be rather robustly constructed at least as<br>
regards the machine and/or the structures supporting<br>
it. The massive construction of other parts of the<br>
elevator needed to maintain alignment between the<br>
traction sheave and diverting pulleys also increases<br>
the weight and cost of the elevator. In addition, in-<br>
stalling and adjusting such a system is a difficult<br>
task requiring great precision. In this case, too,<br>
there is the problem of how to ensure sufficient grip<br>
between the traction sheave and the hoisting ropes.<br>
On the other hand, to achieve a small rope diversion<br>
diameter, rope structures have been used in which the<br>
load-bearing part is made of artificial fiber. Such a<br>
solution is exotic and the ropes thus achieved are<br>
lighter than steel wire ropes, but at least in the<br>
case of elevators designed for the commonest hoisting heights, artificial-fiber ropes do not provide<br>
any substantial advantage, particularly because they are remarkably expensive as compared with steel<br>
wire ropes.<br>
The object of the invention is to achieve at least one of the following objectives. On the one<br>
hand, it is an aim of the invention to develop the elevator without machine room further so as to<br>
allow more effective space utilization in the building and elevator shaft than before. This means that<br>
the elevator must be so constructed that it can be installed in a fairly narrow elevator shaft if<br>
necessary. On the other hand, it is an aim of the invention to reduce the size and / or weight of the<br>
elevator or at least those of its machine. A third objective is to achieve an elevator with a thin<br>
hoisting rope and / or small traction sheave in which the hoisting rope has a good grip / contact on<br>
the traction sheave.<br>
The object of the invention should be achieved without impairing the possibility of varying<br>
the basic elevator layout.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an elevator comprising a hoisting machine<br>
engaging a set of hoisting ropes by means of a traction sheave, said set of hoisting ropes comprising<br>
hoisting ropes of substantially circular cross-section, and in which elevator the set of hoisting ropes<br>
supports a counterweight and an elevator car moving on their respective tracks, wherein the said<br>
substantially round hoisting rope has a thickness below 8 mm and / or the diameter of the traction<br>
sheave is smaller than 320 mm and the overall contact between the traction sheave and a hoisting<br>
rope exceed a contact angle of 180°, and the weight of the hoisting machine of the elevator is at most<br>
1/5 of the weight of the nominal load of the elevator and / or the weight of the hoisting machine of<br>
the elevator is at most 100 kg.<br>
Some inventive embodiments are also discussed in the description section of the present<br>
application. The inventive content may also consist of several separate inventions, especially if<br>
the invention is considered in the light of explicitly expressed or implicit sub-tasks or from the<br>
point of view of advantages or categories of advantages achieved. In this case, some of<br>
the definitions contained in the specification may be superfluous from the point of view of separate<br>
inventive concepts.<br>
By applying the invention, one or more of the following advantages, among others, can be<br>
achieved:<br>
- Due to a small traction sheave, a compact elevator and elevator machine are achieved<br>
- By using a small coated traction sheave, the weight of the machine can easily be<br>
reduced even to about half of the weight of the machines now generally used in<br>
elevators without machine room. For example, in the case of elevators designed for a<br>
nominal load below 1000 kg, this means machines weighing 100-150 kg or even less.<br>
Via appropriate motor solutions and choices of materials, it is even possible to achieve<br>
machines weighing less than 100 kg.<br>
- A good traction traction sheave grip and light components allow the weight of the<br>
elevator car to be considerably reduced, and correspondingly the counterweight can<br>
also be made lighter than in current elevator solutions.<br>
- A compact machine size and thin, substantially round ropes permit the elevator<br>
machine to be relatively freely placed in the shaft. Thus, the elevator solution can be<br>
implemented in a fairly wide variety of ways in the case of both elevators with<br>
machine above and elevators with machine below.<br>
- The elevator machine can be advantageously placed between the car and a shaft wall.<br>
- All or at least part of the weight of the elevator car and counterweight can be carried<br>
by the elevator guide rails.<br>
- In elevators applying the invention, an arrangement of centric suspension of the<br>
elevator car and counterweight can readily be achieved, thereby reducing<br>
the lateral supporting forces applied to the guide<br>
rails.<br>
- Applying the invention allows effective utilization<br>
of the cross-sectional area of the shaft.<br>
- The invention reduces the installation time and to-<br>
tal installation costs of the elevator.<br>
- The elevator is economical to manufacture and in-<br>
stall because many of its components are smaller and<br>
lighter than those used before.<br>
- The speed governor rope and the hoisting rope are<br>
usually different in respect of their properties and<br>
they can be easily distinguished from each other<br>
during installation if the speed governor rope is<br>
thicker than the hoisting ropes; on the other hand,<br>
the speed governor rope and the hoisting ropes may<br>
also be of identical structure, which will reduce<br>
ambiguities regarding these matters in elevator de-<br>
livery logistics and installation.<br>
- The light, thin ropes are easy to handle, allowing<br>
considerably faster installation.<br>
- E.g. in elevators for a nominal load below 1000 kg<br>
and a speed below 2 m/s, the thin and strong steel<br>
wire ropes of the invention have a diameter of the<br>
order of only 3-5 mm.<br>
- With rope diameters of about 6 mm or 8 mm, fairly<br>
large and fast elevators according to the invention<br>
can be achieved.<br>
- The traction sheave and the rope pulleys are small<br>
and light as compared with those used in conven-<br>
tional elevators.<br>
- The small traction sheave allows the use of smaller<br>
operating brakes.<br>
- The small traction sheave reduces the torque re-<br>
quirement, thus allowing the use of a smaller motor<br>
with smaller operating brakes.<br>
- Because of the smaller traction sheave, a higher ro-<br>
tational speed is needed to achieve a given car<br>
speed, which means that the same motor output power<br>
can be reached by a smaller motor.<br>
- Either coated or uncoated ropes can be used.<br>
- It is possible to implement the traction sheave and<br>
the rope pulleys in such a way that, after the coat-<br>
ing on the pulley has been worn out, the rope will<br>
bite firmly on the pulley and thus a sufficient grip<br>
between rope and pulley in this emergency is main-<br>
tained.<br>
- The use of a small traction sheave makes it possible<br>
to use a smaller elevator drive motor, which means a<br>
reduction in drive motor acquisition/manufacturing<br>
costs.<br>
- The invention can be applied in gearless and geared<br>
elevator motor solutions.<br>
- Although the invention is primarily intended for use<br>
in elevators without machine room, it can also be<br>
applied in elevators with machine room.<br>
- In the invention a better grip and a better contact<br>
between the hoisting ropes and the traction sheave<br>
are achieved by increasing the contact angle between<br>
them.<br>
- Due to the improved grip, the size and weight of the<br>
car and counterweight can be reduced.<br>
- The space saving potential of the elevator of the<br>
invention is increased.<br>
- The weight of elevator car in relation to the weight<br>
of the counterweight can be reduced.<br>
- The acceleration power required by the elevator is<br>
reduced and the torque required is also reduced.<br>
- The elevator of the invention can be implemented us-<br>
ing a lighter and smaller machine and/or motor.<br>
- As a result of using a lighter and smaller elevator<br>
system, energy savings and at the same time cost<br>
savings are achieved.<br>
- It is possible to place the machine in the free<br>
space above the counterweight, thus increasing the<br>
space saving potential of the elevator.<br>
- By mounting at least the elevator hoisting machine,<br>
the traction sheave and a diverting pulley in a com-<br>
plete unit, which is fitted as a part of the eleva-<br>
tor of the invention, considerable savings in in-<br>
stallation time and costs will be achieved.<br>
The primary area of application of the invention is<br>
elevators designed for transporting people and/or<br>
freight. In addition, the invention is primarily in-<br>
tended for use in elevators whose speed range, in the<br>
case of passenger elevators, is normally about or<br>
above 1.0 m/s but may also be e.g. only about 0.5 m/s.<br>
In the case of freight elevators, too, the speed is<br>
preferably at least about 0.5 m/s, although slower<br>
speeds can also be used with large loads.<br>
In both passenger and freight elevators, many of the<br>
advantages achieved through the invention are pro-<br>
nouncedly brought out even in elevators for only 3-4<br>
people, and distinctly already in elevators for 6-8<br>
people (500 - 630 kg).<br>
The elevator of the invention can be provided with<br>
elevator hoisting ropes twisted e.g. from round and<br>
strong wires. From round wires, the rope can be<br>
twisted in many ways using wires of different or equal<br>
thickness. In ropes applicable with the invention, the<br>
wire thickness is below 0.4 mm on an average. Well ap-<br>
plicable ropes made from strong wires are those in<br>
which the average wire thickness is below 0.3 mm or<br>
even below 0.2 mm. For instance, thin-wired and strong<br>
4 mm ropes can be twisted relatively economically from<br>
wires such that the mean wire thickness in the fin-<br>
ished rope is in the range of 0.15 ... 0.25 mm, while<br>
the thinnest wires may have a thickness as small as only about 0.1mm. Thin rope wires can easily be<br>
made very strong. The invention employs rope wires having a strength of over 2000 N/mm2. A<br>
suitable range of rope wire strength is 2300-2700 N/mm2. In principle, it is possible to use rope wires<br>
as strong as about 3000 N/mm2 or even more.<br>
By increasing the contact angle using a diverting pulley, the grip between the traction sheave<br>
and the hoisting ropes can be improved. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the weight of the car and<br>
counterweight and their size can be reduced as well, thus increasing the space saving potential of the<br>
elevator. Alternatively or at the same time, it is possible to reduce the weight of the elevator car in<br>
relation to the weight of the counterweight. A contact angle of over 180° between the traction sheave<br>
and the hoisting rope is achieved by using one or more auxiliary diverting pulleys.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the elevator of the invention is an elevator with machine above<br>
without machine room, the drive machine of which comprises a coated traction sheave and which<br>
uses thin hoisting ropes of substantially round cross-section. The contact angle between the hoisting<br>
ropes of the elevator and the traction sheave is larger than 180°. The elevator comprises a unit<br>
comprising a drive machine, a traction sheave and a diverting pulley fitted at a correct angle relative<br>
to the traction sheave, all this equipment being fitted on a mounting base. The unit is secured to the<br>
elevator guide rails.<br>

Fig. 11 presents an embodiment according to the in-<br>
vention .<br>
Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic representation of the struc-<br>
ture of an elevator. The elevator is preferably an<br>
elevator without machine room, with a drive machine 6<br>
placed in the elevator shaft. The elevator shown in<br>
the figure is a traction sheave elevator with machine<br>
above. The passage of the hoisting ropes 3 of the ele-<br>
vator is as follows: One end of the ropes is immovably<br>
fixed to an anchorage 13 located in the upper part of<br>
the shaft above the path of a counterweight 2 moving<br>
along counterweight guide rails 11. From the anchor-<br>
age, the ropes run downward and are passed around di-<br>
verting pulleys 9 suspending the counterweight, which<br>
diverting pulleys 9 are rotatably mounted on the coun-<br>
terweight 2 and from which the ropes 3 run further up-<br>
ward via the rope grooves of diverting pulley 15 to<br>
the traction sheave 7 of the drive machine 6, passing<br>
around the traction sheave along rope grooves on the<br>
sheave. From the traction sheave 7, the ropes 3 run<br>
further downward back to diverting pulley 15, passing<br>
around it along the rope grooves and returning then<br>
back up to the traction sheave 7, over which the ropes<br>
run in the traction sheave rope grooves. From the<br>
traction sheave 7, the ropes 3 go further downwards<br>
via the rope grooves of diverting pulley 15 to the<br>
elevator car 1 moving along the car guide rails 10 of<br>
the elevator, passing under the car via diverting pul-<br>
leys 4 used to suspend the elevator car on the ropes,<br>
and going then upward again from the elevator car to<br>
an anchorage 14 in the upper part of the elevator<br>
shaft, to which anchorage the second end of the ropes<br>
3 is immovably fixed. Anchorage 13 in the upper part<br>
of the shaft, the traction sheave 7 and the diverting<br>
pulley 9 suspending the counterweight on the ropes are<br>
preferably so disposed in relation to each other that<br>
both the rope portion going from the anchorage 13 to<br>
the counterweight 2 and the rope portion going from<br>
the counterweight 2 to the traction sheave 7 are sub-<br>
stantially parallel to the path of the counterweight<br>
2. Similarly, a solution is preferred in which anchor-<br>
age 14 in the upper part of the shaft, the traction<br>
sheave 7, diverting pulley 15 and the diverting pul-<br>
leys 4 suspending the elevator car on the ropes are so<br>
disposed in relation to each other that the rope por-<br>
tion going from the anchorage 14 to the elevator car 1<br>
and the rope portion going from the elevator car 1 via<br>
diverting pulley 15 to the traction sheave 7 are sub-<br>
stantially parallel to the path of the elevator car 1.<br>
With this arrangement, no additional diverting pulleys<br>
are needed to define the passage of the ropes in the<br>
shaft. The roping arrangement between the traction<br>
sheave 7 and the diverting pulley 15 is referred to as<br>
Double Wrap roping, wherein the hoisting ropes are<br>
wrapped around the traction sheave two and/or more<br>
times. In this way, the contact angle can be increased<br>
in two and/or more stages. For example, in the embodi-<br>
ment presented in Fig. 1, a contact angle of 180° +<br>
180°, i.e. 360 ° between the traction sheave 7 and the<br>
hoisting ropes 3 is achieved. Double Wrap roping can<br>
be arranged in other ways, too, e.g. by placing the<br>
diverting pulley on the side of the traction sheave,<br>
in which case, as the hoisting ropes are passed twice<br>
around the traction sheave, a contact angle of 180° +<br>
90° = 270° is obtained, or by placing the diverting<br>
pulley at some other appropriate position. The rope<br>
suspension acts in a substantially centric manner on<br>
the elevator car 1, provided that the rope pulleys 4<br>
supporting the elevator car are mounted substantially<br>
symmetrically relative to the vertical center line<br>
passing via the center of gravity of the elevator car<br>
1. A preferable solution is to dispose the traction<br>
sheave 7 and the diverting pulley 15 in such a way<br>
that the diverting pulley 15 will also function as a<br>
guide of the hoisting ropes 3 and as a damping pulley.<br>
The drive machine 6 placed in the elevator shaft is<br>
preferably of a flat construction, in other words, the<br>
machine has a small thickness dimension as compared<br>
with its width and/or height, or at least the machine<br>
is slim enough to be accommodated between the elevator<br>
car and a wall of the elevator shaft. The machine may<br>
also be placed differently, e.g. by disposing the slim<br>
machine partly or completely between an imaginary ex-<br>
tension of the elevator car and a shaft wall. The ele-<br>
vator shaft is advantageously provided with equipment<br>
required for the supply of power to the motor driving<br>
the traction sheave 7 as well as equipment for eleva-<br>
tor control, both of which can be placed in a common<br>
instrument panel 8 or mounted separately from each<br>
other or integrated partly or wholly with the drive<br>
machine 6. The drive machine may be of a geared or<br>
gearless type. A preferable solution is a gearless ma-<br>
chine comprising a permanent magnet motor. Another ad-<br>
vantageous solution is to build a complete unit com-<br>
prising both an elevator drive machine with a traction<br>
sheave and one or more diverting pulleys with bearings<br>
in a correct operating angle relative to the traction<br>
sheave. The operating angle is determined by the rop-<br>
ing used between the traction sheave an the diverting<br>
pulley/pulleys, which defines the way in which the mu-<br>
tual positions and angle between the traction sheave<br>
and diverting pulley/diverting pulleys relative to<br>
each other axe fitted in the unit. This unit can be<br>
mounted in place as a unitary aggregate in the same<br>
way as a drive machine. The drive machine may be fixed<br>
to a wall of the elevator shaft, to the ceiling, to a<br>
guide rail or guide rails or to some other structure,<br>
such as a beam or frame. In the case of an elevator<br>
with machine below, a further possibility is to mount<br>
the machine on the bottom of the elevator shaft. Fig.<br>
1 illustrates the economical 2:1 suspension, but the<br>
ivention can also be implemented in an elevator using<br>
a 1:1 suspension ratio, in other words, in an elevator<br>
in which the hoisting ropes are connected directly to<br>
the counterweight and elevator car without diverting<br>
pulleys. Other suspension arrangements are also possi-<br>
ble in an implementation of the invention. For exam-<br>
ple, an elevator according to the invention can be im-<br>
plemented using a suspension ratio of 3:1, 4:1 or even<br>
higher suspension ratios. The counterweight and the<br>
elevator car may also be suspended in such manner that<br>
the counterweight is suspended using a suspension ra-<br>
tio of n:1 while the elevator car is suspended with a<br>
suspension ratio of m:l, where m is an integer at<br>
least equal to 1 and n is an integer greater than m.<br>
The elevator presented in the figure has automatic<br>
telescoping doors, but other types of automatic doors<br>
or turning doors may also be used within the framework<br>
of the invention.<br>
Fig. 2 presents a diagram representing another trac-<br>
tion sheave elevator according to the invention. In<br>
this elevator, the ropes go upward from the machine.<br>
This type of elevator is generally a traction sheave<br>
elevator with machine below. The elevator car 101 and<br>
the counterweight 102 are suspended on the hoisting<br>
ropes 103 of the elevator. The elevator drive machine<br>
unit 106 is mounted in the elevator shaft, preferably<br>
in the lower part of the shaft, a diverting pulley 115<br>
is mounted near the drive machine unit 106, said di-<br>
verting pulley allowing a sufficiently large contact<br>
angle to be achieved between the traction sheave 107<br>
and the hoisting ropes 103. The hoisting ropes are<br>
passed via diverting pulleys 104,105 provided in the<br>
upper part of the elevator shaft to the car 101 and to<br>
the counterweight 102. Diverting pulleys 104,105 are<br>
placed in the upper part of the shaft and preferably<br>
separately mounted with bearings on the same axle so<br>
that they can rotate independently of each other. By<br>
way of example, in the elevator in Fig. 2, Double Wrap<br>
roping is also applied in an elevator with machine be-<br>
low.<br>
The elevator car 101 and the counterweight 102 move in<br>
the elevator shaft along elevator and counterweight<br>
guide rails 110,111 guiding them.<br>
In Fig. 2, the hoisting ropes run as follows: One end<br>
of the ropes is fixed to an anchorage 112 in the upper<br>
part of the shaft, from where it goes downward to the<br>
counterweight 102. The counterweight is suspended on<br>
the ropes 103 via a diverting pulley 109. From the<br>
counterweight, the ropes go further upward to a first<br>
diverting pulley 105 mounted on an elevator guide rail<br>
110, and from the diverting pulley 105 further via the<br>
rope grooves of diverting pulley 115 to the traction<br>
sheave 107 driven by the drive machine 106. From the<br>
traction sheave, the ropes go again upwards to divert-<br>
ing pulley 115, and having wrapped around it they go<br>
back to the traction sheave 107. From the traction<br>
sheave 107, the ropes go again upwards via the rope<br>
grooves of diverting pulley 115 to diverting pulley<br>
104, and having wrapped around this pulley they pass<br>
via diverting pulleys 108 mounted on the top of the<br>
elevator car and then go further to an anchorage 113<br>
in the upper part of the elevator shaft, where the<br>
other end of the hoisting ropes is fixed. The elevator<br>
car is suspended on the hoisting ropes 103 by means of<br>
diverting pulleys 108. In the hoisting ropes 103, one<br>
or more of the rope portions between the diverting<br>
pulleys or between the diverting pulleys and the trac-<br>
tion sheave or between the diverting pulleys and the<br>
anchorages may deviate from an exact vertical direc-<br>
tion, a circumstance that makes it easy to provide a<br>
sufficient distance between different rope portions or<br>
a sufficient distance between the hoisting ropes and<br>
the other elevator components. The traction sheave 107<br>
and the hoisting machine 106 are preferably disposed<br>
somewhat aside from the path of the elevator car 101<br>
as well as that of the counterweight 102, so they can<br>
be easily placed almost at any height in the elevator<br>
shaft below the diverting pulleys 104 and 105. If the<br>
machine is not placed directly above or below the<br>
counterweight or elevator car, this will allow a sav-<br>
ing in shaft height. In this case, the minimum height<br>
of the elevator shaft is exclusively determined on the<br>
basis of the length of the paths of the counterweight<br>
and elevator car and the safety clearances needed<br>
above and below these. In addition, a smaller space at<br>
the top or bottom of the shaft will be sufficient due<br>
to the reduced rope pulley diameters as compared with<br>
earlier solutions, depending on how the rope pulleys<br>
are mounted on the elevator car and/or on the frame of<br>
the elevator car.<br>
Fig. 3 presents a partially sectioned view of a rope<br>
pulley 200 applying the invention. The rim 206 of the<br>
rope pulley is provided with rope grooves 201, which<br>
are covered by a coating 202. Provided in the hub of<br>
the rope pulley is a space 203 for a bearing used to<br>
mount the rope pulley. The rope pulley is also pro-<br>
vided with holes 205 for bolts, allowing the rope pul-<br>
ley to be fastened by its side to an anchorage in the<br>
hoisting machine 6, e.g. to a rotating flange, to form<br>
a traction sheave 7, so that no bearing separate from<br>
the hoisting machine is needed. The coating material<br>
used on the traction sheave and the rope pulleys may<br>
consist of rubber, polyurethane or a corresponding<br>
elastic material that increases friction. The material<br>
of the traction sheave and/or rope pulleys may also be<br>
so chosen that, together with the hoisting rope used,<br>
it forms a material pair such that the hoisting rope<br>
will bite into the pulley after the coating on the<br>
pulley has been worn out. This ensures a sufficient<br>
grip between the rope pulley 200 and the hoisting rope<br>
3 in an emergency where the coating 202 has been worn<br>
out from the rope pulley 200. This feature allows the<br>
elevator to maintain its functionality and operational<br>
reliability in the situation referred to. The traction<br>
sheave and/or the rope pulleys can also be manufac-<br>
tured in such manner that only the rim 206 of the rope<br>
pulley 200 is made of a material forming a grip in-<br>
creasing material pair with the hoisting rope 3. The<br>
use of strong hoisting ropes that are considerably<br>
thinner than normally allows the traction sheave and<br>
the rope pulleys to be designed to considerably<br>
smaller dimensions and sizes than when normal-sized<br>
ropes are used. This also makes it possible to use a<br>
motor of a smaller size with a lower torque as the<br>
drive motor of the elevator, which leads to a reduc-<br>
tion in the acquisition costs of the motor. For exam-<br>
ple, in an elevator according to the invention de-<br>
signed for a nominal load below 1000 kg, the traction<br>
sheave diameter is preferably 120-200 mm, but it may<br>
even be less than this. The traction sheave diameter<br>
depends on the thickness of the hoisting ropes used.<br>
In the elevator of the invention, the use of a small<br>
traction sheave, e.g. in the case of elevators for a<br>
nominal load below 1000 kg, makes it possible to<br>
achieve a machine weight even as low as about one half<br>
of the weight of currently used machines, which means<br>
producing elevator machines weighing 100-150 kg or<br>
even less. In the invention, the machine is understood<br>
as comprising at least the traction sheave, the motor,<br>
the machine housing structures and the brakes.<br>
The weight of the elevator machine and its supporting<br>
elements used to hold the machine in place in the ele-<br>
vator shaft is at most about 1/5 of the nominal load.<br>
If the machine is exclusively or almost exclusively<br>
supported by one or more elevator and/or counterweight<br>
guide rails, then the total weight of the machine and<br>
its supporting elements may be less than about 1/6 or<br>
even less than 1/8 of the nominal load. Nominal load<br>
of an elevator means a load defined for elevators of a<br>
given size. The supporting elements of the elevator<br>
machine may include e.g. a beam, carriage or suspen-<br>
sion bracket used to support or suspend the machine<br>
on/from a wall structure or ceiling of the elevator<br>
shaft or on the elevator or counterweight guide rails,<br>
or clamps used to hold the machine fastened to the<br>
sides of the elevator guide rails. It will be easy to<br>
achieve an elevator in which the machine deadweight<br>
without supporting elements is below 1/7 of the nomi-<br>
nal load or even about 1/10 of the nominal load or<br>
still less. Basically, the ratio of machine weight to<br>
nominal load is given for a conventional elevator in<br>
which the counterweight has a weight substantially<br>
equal to the weight of an empty car plus half the<br>
nominal load. As an example of machine weight in the<br>
case of an elevator of a given nominal weight when the<br>
fairly common 2:1 suspension ratio is used with a<br>
nominal load of 630 kg, the combined weight of the ma-<br>
chine and its supporting elements may be only 75 kg<br>
when the traction sheave diameter is 160 mm and hoist-<br>
ing ropes having a diameter of 4 mm are used, in other<br>
words, the total weight of the machine and its sup-<br>
porting elements is about 1/8 of the nominal load of<br>
the elevator. As another example, using the same 2:1<br>
suspension ratio, the same 160 mm traction sheave di-<br>
ameter and the same 4 mm hoisting rope diameter, in<br>
the case of an elevator for a nominal load of about<br>
1000 kg, the total weight of the machine and its sup-<br>
porting elements is about 150 kg, so in this case the<br>
machine and its supporting elements have a total<br>
weight equaling about 1/6 of the nominal load. As a<br>
third example, let us consider an elevator designed<br>
for a nominal load of 1600 kg. In this case, when the<br>
suspension ratio is 2:1, the traction sheave diameter<br>
240 mm and the hoisting rope diameter 6 mm, the total<br>
weight of the machine and its supporting elements will<br>
be about 300 kg, i.e. about 1/7 of the nominal load.<br>
By varying the hoisting rope suspension arrangements,<br>
it is possible to reach a still lower total weight of<br>
the machine and its supporting elements. For example,<br>
when a 4:1 suspension ratio, a 160 mm traction sheave<br>
diameter and a 4 mm hoisting rope diameter are used in<br>
an elevator designed for a nominal load of 500 kg, a<br>
total weight of hoisting machine and its supporting<br>
elements of about 50 kg will be achieved. In this<br>
case, the total weight of the machine and its support-<br>
ing elements is as small as only about 1/10 of the<br>
nominal load.<br>
Fig. 4 presents a solution in which the rope groove<br>
301 is in a coating 302, which is thinner at the sides<br>
of the rope groove than at the bottom. In such a solu-<br>
tion, the coating is placed in a basic groove 320 pro-<br>
vided in the rope pulley 300 so that deformations pro-<br>
duced in the coating by the pressure imposed on it by<br>
the rope will be small and mainly limited to the rope<br>
surface texture sinking into the coating. Such a solu-<br>
tion often means in practice that the rope pulley<br>
coating consists of rope groove-specific sub-coatings<br>
separate from each other, but considering manufactur-<br>
ing or other aspects it may be appropriate to design<br>
the rope pulley coating so that it extends continu-<br>
ously over a number of grooves.<br>
By making the coating thinner at the sides of the<br>
groove than at its bottom, the strain imposed by the<br>
rope on the bottom of the rope groove while sinking<br>
into the groove is avoided or at least reduced. As the<br>
pressure cannot be discharged laterally but is di-<br>
rected by the combined effect of the shape of the ba-<br>
sic groove 320 and the thickness variation of the<br>
coating 302 to support the rope in the rope groove<br>
301, lower maximum surface pressures acting on the<br>
rope and the coating are also achieved. One method of<br>
making a grooved coating 302 like this is to fill the<br>
round-bottomed basic groove 320 with coating material<br>
and then form a half-round rope groove 301 in this<br>
coating material in the basic groove. The shape of the<br>
rope grooves is well supported and the load-bearing<br>
surface layer under the rope provides a better resis-<br>
tance against lateral propagation of the compression<br>
stress produced by the ropes. The lateral spreading or<br>
rather adjustment of the coating caused by the pres-<br>
sure is promoted by thickness and elasticity of the<br>
coating and reduced by hardness and eventual rein-<br>
forcements of the coating. The coating thickness on<br>
the bottom of the rope groove can be made large, even<br>
as large as half the rope thickness, in which case a<br>
hard and inelastic coating is needed. On the other<br>
hand, if a coating thickness corresponding to only<br>
about one tenth of the rope thickness is used, then<br>
the coating material may be clearly softer. An eleva-<br>
tor for eight persons could be implemented using a<br>
coating thickness at the bottom of the groove equal to<br>
about one fifth of the rope thickness if the ropes and<br>
the rope load are chosen appropriately. The coating<br>
thickness should equal at least 2-3 times the depth of<br>
the rope surface texture formed by the surface wires<br>
of the rope. Such a very thin coating, having a thick-<br>
ness even less than the thickness of the surface wire<br>
of the rope, will not necessarily endure the strain<br>
imposed on it. In practice, the coating must have a<br>
thickness larger than this minimum thickness because<br>
the coating will also have to receive rope surface<br>
variations rougher than the surface texture. Such a<br>
rougher area is formed e.g. where the level differ-<br>
ences between rope strands are larger than those be-<br>
tween wires. In practice, a suitable minimum coating<br>
thickness is about 1-3 times the surface wire thick-<br>
ness. In the case of the ropes normally used in eleva-<br>
tors, which have been designed for a contact with a<br>
metallic rope groove and which have a thickness of 8-<br>
10 mm, this thickness definition leads to a coating at<br>
least about 1 mm thick. Since a coating on the trac-<br>
tion sheave, which causes more rope wear than the<br>
other rope pulleys of the elevator, will reduce rope<br>
wear and therefore also the need to provide the rope<br>
with thick surface wires, the rope can be made<br>
smoother. Rope smoothness can naturally be improved by<br>
coating the rope with a material suited for this pur-<br>
pose, such as e.g. polyurethane or equivalent. The use<br>
of thin wires allows the rope itself to be made thin-<br>
ner, because thin steel wires can be manufactured from<br>
a stronger material than thicker wires. For instance,<br>
using 0.2 mm wires, a 4 mm thick elevator hoisting<br>
rope of a fairly good construction can be produced.<br>
Depending on the thickness of the hoisting rope used<br>
and/or on other reasons, the wires in the steel wire<br>
rope may preferably have a thickness between 0.15 mm<br>
and 0.5 mm, in which range there are readily available<br>
steel wires with good strength properties in which<br>
even an individual wire has a sufficient wear resis-<br>
tance and a sufficiently low susceptibility to damage.<br>
In the above, ropes made of round steel wires have<br>
been discussed. Applying the same principles, the<br>
ropes can be wholly or partly twisted from non-round<br>
profiled wires. In this case, the cross-sectional ar-<br>
eas of the wires are preferably substantially the same<br>
as for round wires, i.e. in the range of 0.015 mm2 -<br>
0.2 mm2. Using wires in this thickness range, it will<br>
be easy to produce steel wire ropes having a wire<br>
strength above about 2000 N/mm2 and a wire cross-<br>
section of 0.015 mm2 - 6.2 mm2 and comprising a large<br>
cross-sectional area of steel material in relation to<br>
the cross-sectional area of the rope, as is achieved<br>
e.g. by using the Warrington construction. For the im-<br>
plementation of the invention, particularly well<br>
suited are ropes having a wire strength in the range<br>
of 2300 N/m2 - 2700 N/mmz, because such ropes have a<br>
very large bearing capacity in relation to rope thick-<br>
ness while the high hardness of the strong wires in-<br>
volves no substantial difficulties in the use of the<br>
rope in elevators. A traction sheave coating well<br>
suited for such a rope is already clearly below 1 mm<br>
thick. However, the coating should be thick enough to<br>
ensure that it will not be very easily scratched away<br>
or pierced e.g. by an occasional sand grain or similar<br>
particle that may have got between the rope groove and<br>
the hoisting rope. Thus, a desirable minimum coating<br>
thickness, even when thin-wire hoisting ropes are<br>
used, would be about 0.5...1 mm. For hoisting ropes hav-<br>
ing small surface wires and an otherwise relatively<br>
smooth surface, a coating having a thickness of the<br>
form A+Bcosa is well suited. However, such a coating<br>
is also applicable to ropes whose surface strands meet<br>
the rope groove at a distance from each other, because<br>
if the coating material is sufficiently hard, each<br>
strand meeting the rope groove is in a way separately<br>
supported and the supporting force is the same and/or<br>
as desired. In the formula A+Bcosa, A and B are con-<br>
stants so that A+B is the coating thickness at the<br>
bottom of the rope groove 301 and the angle a is the<br>
angular distance from the bottom of the rope groove as<br>
measured from the center of curvature of the rope<br>
groove cross-section. Constant A is larger than or<br>
equal to zero, and constant B is always larger than<br>
zero. The thickness of the coating growing thinner to-<br>
wards the edges can also be defined in other ways be-<br>
sides using the formula A+Bcosa so that the elasticity<br>
decreases towards the edges of the rope groove. The<br>
elasticity in the central part of the rope groove can<br>
also be increased by making an undercut rope groove<br>
and/or by adding to the coating on the bottom of the<br>
rope groove a portion of different material of special<br>
elasticity, where the elasticity has been increased,<br>
in addition to increasing the material thickness, by<br>
the use of a material that is softer than the rest of<br>
the coating.<br>
Fig. 5a, 5b and 5c present longitudinal cross-sections<br>
of steel wire ropes used in the invention. The ropes<br>
in these figures contain thin steel wires 403, a coat-<br>
ing 402 on the steel wires and/or partly between the<br>
steel wires, and in Fig. 5a a coating 401 over the<br>
steel wires. The rope presented in Fig. 5b is an un-<br>
coated steel wire rope with a rubber-like filler added<br>
to its interior structure, and Fig. 5a presents a<br>
steel wire rope provided with a coating in addition to<br>
a filler added to the internal structure. The rope<br>
presented in Fig. 5c has a non-metallic core 404,<br>
which may be a solid or fibrous structure made of<br>
plastic, natural fiber or some other material suited<br>
for the purpose. A fibrous structure will be good if<br>
the rope is lubricated, in which case lubricant will<br>
accumulate in the fibrous core. The core thus acts as<br>
a kind of lubricant storage. The steel wire ropes of<br>
substantially round cross-section used in the elevator<br>
of the invention may be coated, uncoated and/or pro-<br>
vided with a rubber-like filler, such as e.g. polyure-<br>
thane or some other suitable filler, added to the in-<br>
€erior structure of the rope and acting as a kind of<br>
lubricant lubricating the rope and also balancing the<br>
pressure between wires and strands. The use of a<br>
filler makes it possible to achieve a rope that needs<br>
no lubrication, so its surface can be dry. The coating<br>
used in the steel wire ropes may be made of the same<br>
or nearly the same material as the filler or of a ma-<br>
terial that is better suited for use as a coating and<br>
has properties, such as friction and wear resistance<br>
properties, that are better suited to the purpose than<br>
a filler. The coating of the steel wire rope may also<br>
be so implemented that the coating material penetrates<br>
partially into the rope or through the entire thick-<br>
ness of the rope, giving the rope the same properties<br>
as the filler mentioned above. The use of thin and<br>
strong steel wire ropes according to the invention is<br>
possible because the steel wires used are wires of<br>
special strength, allowing the ropes to be made sub-<br>
stantially thin as compared with steel wire ropes used<br>
before. The ropes presented in Fig. 5a and 5b are<br>
steel wire ropes having a diameter of about 4 mm. For<br>
example, when a 2:1 suspension ratio is used, the thin<br>
and strong steel wire ropes of the invention prefera-<br>
bly have a diameter of about 2.5 - 5 mm in elevators<br>
for a nominal load below 1000 kg, and preferably about<br>
5-8 mm in elevators for a nominal load above 1000<br>
kg. In principle, it is possible to use ropes thinner<br>
than this, but in this case a large number of ropes<br>
will be needed. Still, by increasing the suspension<br>
ratio, ropes thinner than those mentioned above can be<br>
used for corresponding loads, and at the same time a<br>
smaller and lighter elevator machine can be achieved.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates the manner in which a rope pulley<br>
502 connected to a horizontal beam 504 comprised in<br>
the structure supporting the elevator car 501 is<br>
placed in relation to the beam 504, said rope pulley<br>
being used to support the elevator car and associated<br>
structures. The rope pulley 502 presented in the fig-<br>
ure may have a diameter equal to or less than the<br>
height of the beam 504 comprised in the structure. The<br>
beam 504 supporting the elevator car 501 may be lo-<br>
cated either below or above the elevator car. The rope<br>
pulley 502 may be placed completely or partially in-<br>
side the beam 504, as shown in the figure. The hoist-<br>
ing ropes 503 of the elevator in the figure run as<br>
follows: The hoisting ropes 503 come to the coated<br>
rope pulley 502 connected to the beam 504 comprised in<br>
the structure supporting the elevator car 501, from<br>
which pulley the hoisting rope runs further, protected<br>
by the beam, e.g. in a hollow 506 inside the beam, un-<br>
der the elevator car and goes then further via a sec-<br>
ond rope pulley placed on the other side of the eleva-<br>
tor car. The elevator car 501 rests on the beam 504<br>
comprised in the structure, on vibration absorbers 505<br>
placed between them. The beam 504 also acts as a rope<br>
guard for the hoisting rope 503. The beam 504 may be a<br>
C-, U-, I-, Z-section beam or a hollow beam or equiva-<br>
lent.<br>
Fig. 7 presents a diagrammatic illustration of the<br>
structure of an elevator according to the invention.<br>
The elevator is preferably an elevator without machine<br>
room, with a drive machine 706 placed in the elevator<br>
shaft. The elevator shown in the figure is a traction<br>
sheave elevator with machine above. The passage of the<br>
hoisting ropes 703 of the elevator is as follows: One<br>
end of the ropes is immovably fixed to an anchorage<br>
713 located in the upper part of the shaft above the<br>
path of a counterweight 702 moving along counterweight<br>
guide rails 711. From the anchorage, the ropes run<br>
downwards to diverting pulleys 709 suspending the<br>
counterweight, which are rotatably mounted on the<br>
counterweight 702 and from which the ropes 703 run<br>
further upward via the rope grooves of diverting pul-<br>
ley 715 to the traction sheave 707 of the drive ma-<br>
chine 706, passing around the traction sheave along<br>
the rope grooves on the sheave. From the traction<br>
sheave 707, the ropes 703 run further downwards back<br>
to diverting pulley 715, wrapping around it along the<br>
rope grooves of the diverting pulley and returning<br>
then back up to the traction sheave 707, over which<br>
the ropes run in the traction sheave rope grooves.<br>
From the traction sheave 707, the ropes 703 go further<br>
downwards via the rope grooves of the diverting pulley<br>
to the elevator car 701 moving along the car guide<br>
rails 710 of the elevator, passing under the car via<br>
diverging pulleys 704 used to suspend the elevator car<br>
on the ropes, and going then upwards again from the<br>
elevator car to an anchorage 714 in the upper part of<br>
the elevator shaft, to which anchorage the second end<br>
of the ropes 703 is immovably fixed. Anchorage 713 in<br>
the upper part of the shaft, the traction sheave 707,<br>
diverting pulley 715 and the diverting pulley 709 sus-<br>
pending the counterweight on the ropes are preferably<br>
so disposed in relation to each other that both the<br>
rope portion going from the anchorage 713 to the coun-<br>
terweight 702 and the rope portion going from the<br>
counterweight 702 via diverting pulley 715 to the<br>
traction sheave 707 are substantially parallel to the<br>
path of the counterweight 702. Similarly, a solution<br>
is preferred in which the anchorage 714 in the upper<br>
part of the shaft, the traction sheave 707, diverting<br>
pulleys 715,712 and the diverting pulleys 7 04 suspend-<br>
ing the elevator car on the ropes are so disposed in<br>
relation to each other that the rope portion going<br>
from the anchorage 714 to the elevator car 701 and the<br>
rope portion going from the elevator car 701 via di-<br>
verting pulley 715 to the traction sheave 707 are sub-<br>
stantially parallel to the path of the elevator car<br>
701. With this arrangement, no additional diverting<br>
pulleys are needed to define the passage of the ropes<br>
in the shaft. The roping arrangement between the trac-<br>
tion sheave 707 and the diverting pulley 715 is re-<br>
ferred to as Double Wrap roping, wherein the hoisting<br>
ropes are wrapped around the traction sheave two<br>
and/or more times. In this way, the contact angle can<br>
be increased in two and/or more stages. For example,<br>
in the embodiment presented in Fig. 7, a contact angle<br>
of 180° + 180°, i.e. 360 ° between the traction sheave<br>
707 and the hoisting ropes 703 is achieved. The rope<br>
suspension acts in a substantially centric manner on<br>
the elevator car 701, provided that the rope pulleys<br>
704 suspending the elevator car are mounted substan-<br>
tially symmetrically relative to the vertical center<br>
line passing via the center of gravity of the elevator<br>
car 701. A preferable solution is to dispose the trac-<br>
tion sheave 707 and the diverting pulley 715 in such a<br>
way that the diverting pulley 715 will also function<br>
as a guide of the hoisting ropes 703 and as a damping<br>
pulley.<br>
The drive machine 706 placed in the elevator shaft is<br>
preferably of flat construction, in other words, the<br>
machine has a small thickness dimension as compared<br>
with its width and/or height, or at least the machine<br>
is slim enough to be accommodated between the elevator<br>
car and a wall of the elevator shaft. The machine may<br>
also be placed differently, e.g. by disposing the slim<br>
machine partly or completely between an imaginary ex-<br>
tension of the elevator car and a shaft wall. The ele-<br>
vator shaft is advantageously provided with equipment<br>
required for the supply of power to the motor driving<br>
the traction sheave 707 as well as equipment needed<br>
for elevator control, both of which can be placed in a<br>
common instrument panel 708 or mounted separately from<br>
each other or integrated partly or wholly with the<br>
drive machine 706. The drive machine may be of geared<br>
or gearless type. A prefereble solution is a gearless<br>
machine comprising a permanent magnet motor. Another<br>
advantageous solution is to build a complete unit com-<br>
prising both the elevator drive machine 706 and the<br>
diverting pulley 715 and its bearings, which is used<br>
to increase the contact angle, in a correct operating<br>
angle relative to the traction sheave 707, which unit<br>
can be mounted in place as a unitary aggregate in the<br>
same way as a drive machine. The drive machine may be<br>
fixed to a wall of the elevator shaft, to the ceiling,<br>
to a guide rail or guide rails or to some other struc-<br>
ture, such as a beam or frame. The diverting pul-<br>
ley/diverting pulleys to be placed near the drive ma-<br>
chine to increase the operating angle can be mounted<br>
in the same way. In the case of an elevator with ma-<br>
chine below, a further possibility is to mount the<br>
above-mentioned components on the bottom of the eleva-<br>
tor shaft. In Double Wrap roping, when diverting pul-<br>
ley 715 is of substantially equal size with the trac-<br>
tion sheave 707, diverting pulley 715 can also func-<br>
tion as a damping wheel. In this case, the ropes going<br>
from the traction sheave 707 to the counterweight 702<br>
and to the elevator car 701 are passed via the rope<br>
grooves of the diverting pulley 715 and the rope de-<br>
flection caused by the diverting pulley is very small.<br>
It could be said that the ropes coming from the trac-<br>
tion sheave only touch the diverting pulley tangen-<br>
tially. Such tangential contact serves as a solution<br>
damping the vibrations of outgoing ropes and it can<br>
applied in other roping solutions as well. An example<br>
of these other roping solutions is Single Wrap (SW)<br>
roping, where the diverting pulley is of substantially<br>
equal size with the traction sheave of the drive ma-<br>
chine and where a diverting pulley used for tangential<br>
rope contact as described above. In SW roping accord-<br>
ing to the example, the ropes wrap around the traction<br>
sheave only once, with a contact angle of about 180°<br>
between the rope and the traction sheave, the divert-<br>
ing pulley is only used as a means of producing a tan-<br>
gential contact as described above and the diverting<br>
pulley functions as a rope guide and as a damping<br>
wheel for the damping of vibrations. The suspension<br>
ratio of the elevator is of no importance with respect<br>
to the application of SW roping described in the exam-<br>
ple; instead, it can be used in connection with any<br>
suspension ratio. The embodiment using SW roping as<br>
described in the example may have an inventive value<br>
in itself, at least in regard of damping. The divert-<br>
ing pulley 715 may also be of substantially different<br>
size than the traction sheave, in which case it func-<br>
tions as a diverting pulley increasing the contact an-<br>
gle and not as a damping wheel. Fig. 7 presents an<br>
elevator according to the invention that uses a sus-<br>
pension ratio of 4:1. The invention can also be imple-<br>
mented using other suspension arrangements. For exam-<br>
ple, an elevator according to the invention can be im-<br>
plemented using a suspension ratio of 1:1, 2:1, 3:1 or<br>
even suspension ratios higher than 4:1. The elevator<br>
presented in the figure has automatic telescoping<br>
doors, but other types of automatic doors or turning<br>
doors may also be used within the framework of the in-<br>
vention.<br>
Fig. 8 presents a diagrammatic illustration of the<br>
structure of an elevator according to the invention.<br>
The elevator is preferably an elevator without machine<br>
room, with a drive machine 806 placed in the elevator<br>
shaft. The elevator shown in the figure is a traction<br>
sheave elevator with machine above. The passage of the<br>
hoisting ropes 803 of the elevator is as follows: One<br>
end of the ropes is immovably fixed to an anchorage<br>
813 located in the upper part of the shaft above the<br>
path of a counterweight 802 moving along counterweight<br>
guide rails 811. From the anchorage, the ropes run<br>
downwards to diverting pulleys 809 suspending the<br>
counterweight, which are rotatably mounted on the<br>
counterweight 802 and from which the ropes 803 run<br>
further upward via the rope grooves of diverting pul-<br>
ley 815 to the traction sheave 807 of the drive ma-<br>
chine 806, wrapping around the traction sheave along<br>
the rope grooves on the sheave. From the traction<br>
sheave 807, the ropes 803 run further downwards, going<br>
crosswise relative to the upwards going ropes, and<br>
further via the rope grooves of the diverting pulley<br>
to the elevator car 801 moving along the car guide<br>
rails 810 of the elevator, passing under the car via<br>
diverting pulleys 804 used to suspend the elevator car<br>
on the ropes, and going then upwards again from the<br>
elevator car to an anchorage 814 in the upper part of<br>
the elevator shaft, to which anchorage the second end<br>
of the ropes 803 is immovably fixed. Anchorage 813 in<br>
the upper part of the shaft, the traction sheave 807,<br>
diverting pulley 815 and the diverting pulley 809 sus-<br>
pending the counterweight on the ropes are preferably<br>
so disposed in relation to each other that both the<br>
rope portion going from the anchorage 813 to the coun-<br>
terweight 802 and the rope portion going from the<br>
counterweight 802 via diverting pulley 815 to the<br>
traction sheave 807 are substantially parallel to the<br>
path of the counterweight 802. Similarly, a solution<br>
is preferred in which the anchorage 814 in the upper<br>
part of the shaft, the traction sheave 807, diverting<br>
pulley 815 and the diverting pulleys 804 suspending<br>
the elevator car on the ropes are so disposed in rela-<br>
tion to each other that the rope portion going from<br>
the anchorage 814 to the elevator car 801 and the rope<br>
portion going from the elevator car 801 via diverting<br>
pulley 815 to the traction sheave 807 are substan-<br>
tially parallel to the path of the elevator car 801.<br>
With this arrangement, no additional diverting pulleys<br>
are needed to define the passage of the ropes in the<br>
shaft. This roping arrangement between the traction<br>
sheave 807 and the diverting pulley 815 can be re-<br>
ferred to as X Wrap (XW) roping, while Double Wrap<br>
(DW) roping, Single Wrap (SW) roping and Extended Wrap<br>
(ESW) roping are previously known concepts. In X Wrap<br>
roping, the ropes are caused to wrap around the trac-<br>
tion sheave with a large contact angle. For example,<br>
in the case illustrated in Fig. 8, a contact angle of<br>
well over 180°, i.e. about 270° between the traction<br>
sheave 807 and the hoisting ropes 803 is achieved. X<br>
Wrap roping presented in the figure can also be ar-<br>
ranged in another way, e.g. by providing two diverting<br>
pulleys at appropriate positions near the drive ma-<br>
chine. Diverting pulley 815 has been fitted in a posi-<br>
tion designed to form an angle relative to the trac-<br>
tion sheave 807 such that the ropes will run crosswise<br>
in a manner known in itself so that the ropes are not<br>
damaged. The rope suspension acts in a substantially<br>
centric manner on the elevator car 801, provided that<br>
the rope pulleys 804 suspending the elevator car are<br>
mounted substantially symmetrically relative to the<br>
vertical center line passing via the center of gravity<br>
of the elevator car 801.<br>
The drive machine 806 placed in the elevator shaft is<br>
preferably of flat construction, in other words, the<br>
machine has a small thickness dimension as compared<br>
with its width and/or height, or at least the machine<br>
is slim enough to be accommodated between the elevator<br>
car and a wall of the elevator shaft. The machine may<br>
also be placed differently, e.g. by disposing the slim<br>
machine partly or completely between an imaginary ex-<br>
tension of the elevator car and a shaft wall. The ele-<br>
vator shaft is advantageously provided with equipment<br>
required for the supply of power to the motor driving<br>
the traction sheave 807 as well as equipment needed<br>
for elevator control, both of which can be placed in a<br>
common instrument panel 808 or mounted separately from<br>
each other or integrated partly or wholly with the<br>
drive machine 806. The drive machine may be of geared<br>
or gearless type. A preferable solution is a gearless<br>
machine comprising a permanent magnet motor. Another<br>
advantageous solution is to build a complete unit com-<br>
prising both the elevator drive machine 806 and the<br>
diverting pulley 815 and its bearings, which is used<br>
to increase the contact angle, in a correct operating<br>
angle relative to the traction sheave 807, which unit<br>
can be mounted in place as a unitary aggregate in the<br>
same way as a drive machine. Using a complete unit<br>
means less need for rigging during installation. X<br>
Wrap roping can also be implemented by mounting a di-<br>
verting pulley directly on the drive machine. The<br>
drive machine may be fixed to a wall of the elevator<br>
shaft, to the ceiling, to a guide rail or guide rails<br>
or to some other structure, such as a beam or frame.<br>
The diverting pulley to be placed near the drive ma-<br>
chine to increase the. operating angle can be mounted<br>
in the same way. In the case of an elevator with ma-<br>
chine below, a further possibility is to mount the<br>
above-mentioned components on the bottom of the eleva-<br>
tor shaft. Fig. 8 illustrates the economical 2:1 sus-<br>
pension, but the invention can also be implemented in<br>
an elevator with 1:1 suspension ratio, in other words,<br>
in an elevator with the hoisting ropes connected di-<br>
rectly to the counterweight and elevator car without a<br>
diverting pulley. The invention can also be imple-<br>
mented using other suspension arrangements. For exam-<br>
ple, an elevator according to the invention can be im-<br>
plemented using a suspension ratio of 3:1, 4:1 or even<br>
higher suspension ratios. The elevator presented in<br>
the figure has automatic telescoping doors, but other<br>
types of automatic doors or turning doors may also be<br>
used within the framework of the invention.<br>
Fig. 9 presents a diagrammatic illustration of the<br>
structure of an elevator according to the invention.<br>
The elevator is preferably an elevator without machine<br>
room, with a drive machine 906 placed in the elevator<br>
shaft. The elevator shown in the figure is a traction<br>
sheave elevator with machine above. The passage of the<br>
hoisting ropes 903 of the elevator is as follows: One<br>
end of the ropes is immovably fixed to an anchorage<br>
913 located in the upper part of the shaft above the<br>
path of a counterweight 902 moving along counterweight<br>
guide rails 911. From the anchorage, the ropes run<br>
downwards to diverting pulleys 909 suspending the<br>
counterweight, which are rotatably mounted on the<br>
counterweight 902 and from which diverting pulleys 909<br>
the ropes 903 run further upward to the traction<br>
sheave 907 of the drive machine 906, wrapping around<br>
the traction sheave along the rope grooves on the<br>
sheave. From the traction sheave 907, the ropes 903<br>
run further downwards, going crosswise relative to the<br>
upwards going ropes, and further to diverting pulley<br>
915, wrapping around it along the rope grooves of the<br>
diverting pulley 915. From the diverting pulley 915,<br>
the ropes go further downwards to the elevator car 901<br>
moving along the car guide rails 910 of the elevator,<br>
passing under the car via diverting pulleys 904 used<br>
to suspend the elevator car on the ropes, and going<br>
then upwards again from the elevator car to an anchor-<br>
age 914 in the upper part of the elevator shaft, to<br>
which anchorage the second end of the ropes 903 is im-<br>
movably fixed. Anchorage 913 in the upper part of the<br>
shaft, the traction sheave 907 and the diverting pul-<br>
ley 909 suspending the counterweight on the ropes are<br>
preferably so disposed in relation to each other that<br>
both the rope portion going from the anchorage 913 to<br>
the counterweight 902 and the rope portion going from<br>
the counterweight 902 to the traction sheave 907 are<br>
substantially parallel to the path of the counter-<br>
weight 902. Similarly, a solution is preferred in<br>
which the anchorage 914 in the upper part of the<br>
shaft, the traction sheave 907, diverting pulley 915<br>
and the diverting pulleys 904 suspending the elevator<br>
car on the ropes are so disposed in relation to each<br>
other that the rope portion going from the anchorage<br>
914 to the elevator car 901 and the rope portion going<br>
from the elevator car 901 via diverting pulley 915 to<br>
the traction sheave 907 are substantially parallel to<br>
the path of the elevator car 901. With this arrange-<br>
ment, no additional diverting pulleys are needed to<br>
define the passage of the ropes in the shaft. This<br>
roping arrangement between the traction sheave 907 and<br>
the diverting pulley 915 can be referred to as Ex-<br>
tended Single Wrap roping. In Extended Single Wrap<br>
roping, by using a diverting pulley, the hoisting<br>
ropes are caused to wrap around the traction sheave<br>
with a larger contact angle. For example, in the case<br>
illustrated in Fig. 9, a contact angle of well over<br>
180°, i.e. about 270° between the traction sheave 907<br>
and the hoisting ropes 903 is achieved. Extended Sin-<br>
gle Wrap roping presented in the figure can also be<br>
arranged in another way, e.g. by disposing the drive<br>
machine and the diverting pulley in another way in re-<br>
lation to each other, e.g. the other way round rela-<br>
tive to each other than in the case presented in Fig.<br>
9. Diverting pulley 915 has been fitted in a position<br>
designed to form an angle relative to the traction<br>
sheave 907 such that the ropes will run crosswise in a<br>
manner known in itself so that the ropes are not dam-<br>
aged. The rope suspension acts in a substantially cen-<br>
tric manner on the elevator car 901, provided that the<br>
rope pulleys 904 suspending the elevator car are<br>
mounted substantially symmetrically relative to the<br>
vertical center line passing via the center of gravity<br>
of the elevator car 901. In the solution represented<br>
by Fig. 9, the drive machine 906 can preferably be<br>
placed e.g. in the free space above the counterweight,<br>
thereby increasing the space saving potential of the<br>
elevator.<br>
The drive machine 906 placed in the elevator shaft is<br>
preferably of flat construction, in other words, the<br>
machine has a small thickness dimension as compared<br>
with its width and/or height, or at least the machine<br>
is slim enough to be accommodated between the elevator<br>
car and a wall of the elevator shaft. The machine may<br>
also be placed differently, e.g. by disposing the slim<br>
machine partly or completely between an imaginary ex-<br>
tension of the elevator car and a shaft wall. The ele-<br>
vator shaft is advantageously provided with equipment<br>
required for the supply of power to the motor driving<br>
the traction sheave 907 as well as equipment needed<br>
for elevator control, both of which can be placed in a<br>
common instrument panel 908 or mounted separately from<br>
each other or integrated partly or wholly with the<br>
drive machine 906. The drive machine may be of geared<br>
or gearless type. A preferable solution is a gearless<br>
machine comprising a permanent magnet motor. Another<br>
advantageous solution is to build a complete unit com-<br>
prising both the elevator drive machine 906 and/or the<br>
diverting pulley/diverting pulleys 915 with their<br>
bearings, mounted in a correct operating angle rela-<br>
tive to the traction sheave 907 to increase the con-<br>
tact angle, all this equipment being ready fitted on a<br>
mounting base, which unit can be mounted in place as a<br>
unitary aggregate in the same way as a drive machine.<br>
Using a unitary aggregate solution reduces the need<br>
for rigging at installation time. The drive machine<br>
may be fixed to a wall of the elevator shaft, to the<br>
ceiling, to a guide rail or guide rails or to some<br>
other structure, such as a beam or frame. The divert-<br>
ing pulley to be placed near the drive machine to in-<br>
crease the operating angle can be mounted in the same<br>
way. In the case of an elevator with machine below, a<br>
further possibility is to mount the above-mentioned<br>
components on the bottom of the elevator shaft. Fig. 9<br>
illustrates the economical 2:1 suspension, but the in-<br>
vention can also be implemented in an elevator with<br>
1:1 suspension ratio, in other words, in an elevator<br>
with the hoisting ropes connected directly to the<br>
counterweight and elevator car without a diverting<br>
pulley. The invention can also be implemented using<br>
other suspension arrangements. For example, an eleva-<br>
tor according to the invention can be implemented us-<br>
ing a suspension ratio of 3:1, 4:1 or even higher sus-<br>
pension ratios. The elevator presented in the figure<br>
has automatic telescoping doors, but other types of<br>
automatic doors or turning doors may also be used<br>
within the framework of the invention.<br>
Figures 10a, 10b, 10c, 10d, 10e, 10f and 10g present<br>
some variations of the roping arrangements according<br>
to the invention that can be used between the traction<br>
sheave 1007 and the diverting pulley 1015 to increase<br>
the contact angle between the ropes 1003 and the trac-<br>
tion sheave 1007, in which arrangements the ropes 1003<br>
go downwards from the drive machine 1006 towards the<br>
elevator car and counterweight. These roping arrange-<br>
ments make it possible to increase the contact angle<br>
between the hoisting rope 1003 and the traction sheave<br>
1007. In the invention, contact angle a refers to the<br>
length of the arc of contact between the traction<br>
sheave and the hoisting rope. The magnitude of the<br>
contact angle a may be expressed e.g. in degrees, as<br>
is done in the invention, but it is also possible to<br>
express the magnitude of the contact angle in other<br>
terms, e.g. in radians or equivalent. The contact an-<br>
gle a is presented in greater detail in Fig. 10a. In<br>
the other figures, the contact angle a is not ex-<br>
pressly indicated, but it can be seen from the other<br>
figures as well without specific description.<br>
The roping arrangements presented in Fig. 10a, 10b,<br>
10c represent some variations of the X Wrap roping de-<br>
scribed above. In the arrangement presented in Fig.<br>
10a, the ropes 1003 come via diverting pulley 1015,<br>
wrapping around it along rope grooves, to the traction<br>
sheave 1007, over which the ropes pass along its rope<br>
grooves and then go further back to the diverting pul-<br>
ley 1015, passing crosswise with respect to the rope<br>
portion coming from the diverting pulley, and continu-<br>
ing their passage further. Crosswise passage of the<br>
ropes 1003 between the diverting pulley 1015 and the<br>
traction sheave 1007 can be implemented e.g. by having<br>
the diverting pulley fitted at such an angle with re-<br>
spect to the traction sheave that the ropes will cross<br>
each other in a manner known in itself so that the<br>
ropes 1003 are not damaged. In Fig. 10a, the contact<br>
angle a between the ropes 1003 and the traction sheave<br>
1007 is represented by the shaded area. The magnitude<br>
of the contact angle a in this figure is about 310°.<br>
The size of the diameter of the diverting pulley can<br>
be used as a means of determining the distance of sus-<br>
pension that is to be provided between the diverting<br>
pulley 1015 and the traction sheave 1007. The magni-<br>
tude of the contact angle can be varied by varying the<br>
distance between the diverting pulley 1015 and the<br>
traction sheave 1007. The magnitude of the angle a can<br>
also be varied by varying the diameter of the divert-<br>
ing pulley and/or by varying the diameter of the trac-<br>
tion sheave and also by varying the relation between<br>
the diameters of the diverting pulley and the traction<br>
sheave. Fig. 10b and 10c present an example of imple-<br>
menting a corresponding XW roping arrangement using<br>
two diverting pulleys.<br>
The roping arrangements presented in Fig. 10d and 10e<br>
are different variations of the above-mentioned Double<br>
Wrap roping. In the roping arrangement in Fig. 10d,<br>
the ropes run via the rope grooves of diverting pulley<br>
1015 to the traction sheave traction sheave 1007 of<br>
the drive machine 1006, passing over it along the rope<br>
grooves of the traction sheave. From the traction<br>
sheave 1007, the ropes 1003 go further downwards back<br>
to diverting pulley 1015, wrapping around it along the<br>
rope grooves of the diverting pulley and returning<br>
then back to the traction sheave 1007, over which the<br>
ropes run in the rope grooves of the traction sheave.<br>
From the traction sheave 1007, the ropes 1003 run fur-<br>
ther downwards via the rope grooves of the diverting<br>
pulley. In the roping arrangement presented in the<br>
figure, the hoisting ropes are caused to wrap around<br>
the traction sheave twice and/or more times. By these<br>
means, the contact angle can be increased in two<br>
and/or more stages. For example, in the case presented<br>
in Fig. 10d, a contact angle of 180° + 180° between the<br>
traction sheave 1007 and the ropes 1003 is achieved.<br>
In Double Wrap roping, when the diverting pulley 1015<br>
is substantially of equal size with the traction<br>
sheave 1007, the diverting pulley 1015 also functions<br>
as a damping wheel. In this case, the ropes going from<br>
the traction sheave 1007 to the counterweight and ele-<br>
vator car pass via the rope grooves of the diverting<br>
pulley 1015 and the rope deflection produced by the<br>
diverting pulley is very small. It could be said that<br>
the ropes coming from the traction sheave only touch<br>
the diverting pulley tangentially. Such tangential<br>
contact serves as a solution damping the vibrations of<br>
outgoing ropes and it can applied in other roping ar-<br>
rangements as well. In this case, the diverting pulley<br>
1015 also functions as a rope guide. The ratio of the<br>
diameters of the diverting pulley and traction sheave<br>
can be varied by varying the diameters of the divert-<br>
ing pulley and/or traction sheave. This can be used as<br>
a means of defining the magnitude of the contact angle<br>
and fitting it to a desired magnitude. By using DW<br>
roping, forward bending of the rope 1003 is achieved,<br>
which means that the rope 1003 is in DW roping is bent<br>
in the same direction on the diverting pulley 1015 and<br>
on the traction sheave 1007. DW roping can also be im-<br>
plemented in other ways, such as e.g. the way illus-<br>
trated in Fig. 10e, where the diverting pulley 1015 is<br>
disposed on the side of the traction sheave 1007. In<br>
this roping arrangement, the ropes 1003 are passed in<br>
a manner corresponding to Fig. 10d, but in this case a<br>
contact angle of 180° + 90°, i.e. 270° is obtained. If<br>
the diverting pulley 1015 is placed on the side of the<br>
traction sheave in the case of DW roping, greater de-<br>
mands are imposed on the bearings and mounting of the<br>
diverting pulley because it is exposed to greater<br>
stress and load forces than in the embodiment pre-<br>
sented in Fig. 10d.<br>
Fig. 10f presents an embodiment of the invention ap-<br>
plying Extended Single Wrap roping as mentioned above.<br>
In the roping arrangement presented in the figure, the<br>
ropes 1003 run to the traction sheave 1007 of the<br>
drive machine 1006, wrapping around it along the rope<br>
grooves of the traction sheave. From the traction<br>
sheave 1007, the ropes 1003 go further downwards, run-<br>
ning crosswise relative to the upwards going ropes and<br>
further to diverting pulley 1015, passing over it<br>
along the rope grooves of the diverting pulley 1015.<br>
From the diverting pulley 1015, the ropes 1003 run<br>
further on. In Extended Single Wrap roping, by using a<br>
diverting pulley, the hoisting ropes are caused to<br>
wrap around the traction sheave with a larger contact<br>
angle than in ordinary Single Wrap roping. For exam-<br>
ple, in the case illustrated in Fig. lOf, a contact<br>
angle of about 270° between the ropes 1003 and the<br>
traction sheave 1007 is obtained. The diverting pulley<br>
1015 is fitted in position at an angle such that the<br>
ropes run crosswise in a manner known in itself, so<br>
that the ropes are not damaged. By virtue of the con-<br>
tact angle achieved using Extended Single Wrap roping,<br>
elevators implemented according to the invention can<br>
use a very light elevator car and the elevator drive<br>
machine can be placed e.g. in the free space above the<br>
counterweight, thus allowing freer disposition of<br>
other elevator components because there is more space<br>
available. One possibility of increasing the contact<br>
angle is illustrated in Fig. 10g, where the hoisting<br>
ropes do not run crosswise relative to each other af-<br>
ter wrapping around the traction sheave and/or divert-<br>
ing pulley. By using a roping arrangement like this,<br>
it is also possible increase the contact angle between<br>
the hoisting ropes 1003 and the traction sheave 1007<br>
of the drive machine 1006 to a magnitude substantially-<br>
over 180°.<br>
Figures 10a,b,c,d,f and g present different variations<br>
of roping arrangements between the traction sheave and<br>
the diverting pulley/diverting pulleys, in which the<br>
ropes go downwards from the drive machine towards the<br>
counterweight and the elevator car. In the case of an<br>
elevator embodiment according to the invention with<br>
machine below, these roping arrangements can be in-<br>
verted and implemented in a corresponding manner so<br>
that the ropes go upwards from the elevator drive ma-<br>
chine towards the counterweight and the elevator car.<br>
Fig. 11 presents yet another embodiment of the inven-<br>
tion, wnerein the elevator drive machine 1106 is fit-<br>
ted together with a diverting pulley 1115 on the same<br>
mounting base 1121 in a ready-made unit 1120, which<br>
can be fitted as such to form a part of an elevator<br>
according to the invention. The unit contains the ele-<br>
vator drive machine 1106, the traction sheave 1107 and<br>
diverting pulley 1115 ready-fitted on the mounting<br>
base 1121, the traction sheave and diverting pulley<br>
being ready fitted at a correct operating angle rela-<br>
tive to each other, depending on the roping arrange-<br>
ment used between the traction sheave 1107 and the di-<br>
verting pulley 1115. The unit 1120 may comprise more<br>
than only one diverting pulley 1115, or it may only<br>
comprise the drive machine 1106 fitted on the mounting<br>
base 1121. The unit can be mounted in an elevator ac-<br>
cording to the invention like a drive machine, the<br>
mounting arrangement being described in greater detail<br>
in connection with the previous figures. If necessary,<br>
the unit can be used together with any of the roping<br>
arrangements described above, such as e.g. embodiments<br>
using ESW, DW, SW or XW roping. By fitting the above-<br>
described unit as part of an elevator according to the<br>
invention, considerable savings can be made in instal-<br>
lation costs and in the time required for installa-<br>
tion.<br>
It is obvious to the person skilled in the art that<br>
different embodiments of the invention are not limited<br>
to the examples described above, but that they may be<br>
varied within the scope of the following claims. For<br>
instance, the number of times the hoisting ropes are<br>
passed between the upper part of the elevator shaft<br>
and the counterweight or elevator car is not a very<br>
decisive question as regards the basic advantages of<br>
the invention, although it is possible to achieve some<br>
additional advantages by using multiple rope passages.<br>
In general, embodiments should be so implemented that<br>
the ropes go to the elevator car at most as many times<br>
as to the counterweight. It is also obvious that the<br>
hoisting ropes need not necessarily be passed under<br>
the car; instead, they may also be passed over or<br>
sideways past the elevator car. In accordance with the<br>
examples described above, the skilled person can vary<br>
the embodiment of the invention, while the traction<br>
sheaves and rope pulleys, instead of being coated<br>
metal pulleys, may also be uncoated metal pulleys or<br>
uncoated pulleys made of some other material suited to<br>
the purpose.<br>
It is further obvious to the person skilled in the art<br>
that the metallic traction sheaves and rope pulleys<br>
used in the invention, which are coated with a non-<br>
metallic material at least in the area of their<br>
grooves, may be implemented using a coating material<br>
consisting of e.g. rubber, polyurethane or some other<br>
material suited to the purpose.<br>
It is also obvious to the person skilled in the art<br>
that the elevator car, the counterweight and the ma-<br>
chine unit may be laid out in the cross-section of the<br>
elevator shaft in a manner differing from the lay-out<br>
described in the examples. Such a different lay-out<br>
might be e.g. one in which the machine and the coun-<br>
terweight are located behind the car as seen from the<br>
shaft door and the ropes are passed under the car di-<br>
agonally relative to the bottom of the car. Passing<br>
the ropes under, the car in a diagonal or otherwise<br>
oblique direction relative to the form of the bottom<br>
provides an advantage when the suspension of the car<br>
on the ropes is to be made symmetrical relative to the<br>
center of mass of the elevator in other types of sus-<br>
pension lay-out as well.<br>
It is further obvious to the person skilled in the art<br>
that the equipment required for the supply of power to<br>
the motor and the equipment needed for elevator con-<br>
trol can be placed elsewhere than in connection with<br>
the machine unit, e.g. in a separate instrument panel.<br>
It is also possible to fit pieces of equipment needed<br>
for control into separate units which can then be dis-<br>
posed in different places in the elevator shaft and/or<br>
in other parts of the building. It is likewise obvious<br>
to the skilled person that an elevator applying the<br>
invention may be equipped differently from the exam-<br>
ples described above. It is further obvious to the<br>
skilled person that the suspension solutions according<br>
to the invention can also be implemented using some<br>
other type of flexible hoisting means as hoisting<br>
ropes than the means described here, to achieve small<br>
deflection diameters of the hoisting means, for exam-<br>
ple by using flexible rope of one or more strands, flat<br>
belt, cogged belt, trapezoidal belt or some other type<br>
of belt applicable to the purpose, or even using dif-<br>
ferent types of chains.<br>
It is also obvious to the skilled person that, instead<br>
of using ropes with a filler as illustrated in Fig. 5a<br>
and 5b, the invention may be implemented using ropes<br>
without filler, which are either lubricated or unlu-<br>
bricated. In addition, it is also obvious to the per-<br>
son skilled in the art that the ropes may be twisted<br>
in many different ways. It is also obvious to the<br>
skilled person that the average of the wire thick-<br>
nesses may be understood as referring to a statisti-<br>
cal, geometrical or arithmetical mean value. To deter-<br>
mine a statistical average, the standard deviation or<br>
Gauss distribution can be used. It is further obvious<br>
that the wire thicknesses in the rope may vary, e.g.<br>
even by a factor of 3 or more.<br>
It is also obvious to the person skilled in the art<br>
that the elevator of the invention can be implemented<br>
using different roping arrangements for increasing the<br>
contact angle a between the traction sheave and the<br>
diverting pulley/diverting pulleys than those de-<br>
scribed as examples. For example, it is possible to<br>
dispose the diverting pulley/diverting pulleys, the<br>
traction sheave and the hoisting ropes in other ways<br>
than in the roping arrangements described in the exam-<br>
ples.<br>
