COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10; rule 13)<br>
1.        A DEVICE FOR CLEANING AND SANITIZING THE RECTUM AND ANUS AREA OF THE PROCTOLOGICAL PATIENT.<br>
2	PRASAD VAIDYA, DR.HEDGEWAR HOSPITAL,GARKHEDA,<br>
SAMBHAJI   NAGAR,AURANGABAD-431 005, MAHARASHTRA4NDIA. AN INDIAN NATIONAL<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
A Device For Cleaning And Sanitizing The Rectum And Anus Area Of The<br>
Proctological Patient<br>
Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a device for providing a sitz bath to the proctological patient. More particularly it relates to a device for cleaning and sanitizing the rectum and anus area of the proctological patient.<br>
Prior Art:<br>
The standard protocol following surgery of perenium, the sitz bath or hip bath is advised to all the post operative proctological patients. The purpose of this sitz bath or hip bath is:<br>
i.	To clean the post operative site<br>
ii.        To receive fomentation to ano rectum<br>
iii.       To disinfect the area with superadded medications in the water<br>
At present following modalities are available for taking sitz bath:<br>
i<br>
a.	simple plastic tub containing lukewarm water with some medicament<br>
b.	Western type of commodes with water jets/ sprinklers gadgets<br>
c.	Foldable sitz bath accessories which can be fitted to western commodes<br>
Now we will see each modality available for the sitz bath as mentioned above in detail. a.   Simple plastic tube:<br>
This kind of device consists of a simple plastic tub having about 5 liters capacity to which lukewarm water with required medicaments is poured. The method of taking sitz bath using this device has been described in Mosbys Medical Nursing and Applied Health<br><br>
Dictionary (Forth Edition page No. 14411). While taking sitz bath using this device patient has to dip his hips in a tub containing lukewarm water with medicament for about 10-15 minutes. In this method patient has to sit in a squatting position.<br>
In this method patient has to sit in a squatting position, which is quite cumbersome and some times develops cramps in calf muscles and creates giddiness for the patient. Also when the patient sits on the tub, it overflows the tub which makes the surrounding area dirty with contaminated water. There is soiling of the patient clothes due to the tub water. In general any proctological patient does not receive adequate cleaning effect in such tub bath.<br>
b.	Western type of commodes with water jets/ sprinklers gadgets:<br>
Water jets/ sprinklers are the special devices which can only be fitted to commodes of western style. The force of water coming from this jet nozzle is very high. This force produces pain when directed over the raw post operative perianal site. This can also hamper the epithelization process of wound healing which is continuously going on in the perianal wound. Also the jet nozzle has to be directed manually to target the desired site.<br>
c.	Foldable sitz bath accessories which can be fitted to western commodes:<br>
This kind of arrangement is similar to the combination of the above two methods of takin sitz bath. It is having the disadvantages of above both the methods.<br>
From above mentioned three modalities available in the prior art, it is clear mat the proctological<br>
patient is unable to get-comfortable and non painful sitz bath using these modalities. Also the cleaning and sanitizing effect achieved by these modalities is not sufficient.<br>
Hence considering all the problems and disadvantages of the modalities available presently for the sitz bath, there is need of a device for providing sitz bath which will be free from all above mentioned problems and disadvantages.<br><br>
