ENHANCED IGNITION STRATEGY<br>
STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT RIGHTS<br>
[0001] This invention was produced pursuant to U.S. Government<br>
Contract No. DE-FC-04-03 AL67635 with the Department of Energy (DoE). The<br>
U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to methods and systems for<br>
heating particulate filters.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Diesel engines typically have higher efficiency than gasoline<br>
engines due to an increased compression ratio and a higher energy density of<br>
diesel fuel. A diesel combustion cycle produces particulates that are typically<br>
filtered from diesel exhaust by a particulate filter (PF) that is disposed in the<br>
exhaust stream. Over time, the PF becomes full and the trapped diesel<br>
particulates must be removed. During regeneration, the diesel particulates are<br>
burned within the PF.<br>
[0005] Conventional regeneration methods inject fuel into the exhaust<br>
stream after the main combustion event. The post-combustion injected fuel is<br><br>
combusted over one or more catalysts placed in the exhaust stream. The heat<br>
released during the fuel combustion on the catalysts increases the exhaust<br>
temperature, which burns the trapped soot particles in the PF. This approach,<br>
however, can result in higher temperature excursions than desired, which can be<br>
detrimental to exhaust system components, including the PF.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] Accordingly, an exhaust system that processes exhaust<br>
generated by an engine is provided. The system generally includes a<br>
particulate filter (PF) that filters particulates from the exhaust wherein an<br>
upstream end of the PF receives exhaust from the engine. A grid of electrically<br>
resistive material is applied to an exterior upstream surface of the PF and<br>
selectively heats exhaust passing through the grid to initiate combustion of<br>
particulates within the PF. A catalyst coating applied to at least one of the PF<br>
and the grid. A control module estimates a temperature of the grid and controls<br>
the engine to produce a desired exhaust product to increase the temperature of<br>
the grid.<br>
[0007] In other features, a method of regenerating a particulate filter<br>
(PF) of an exhaust system for an engine is provided. The method generally<br>
includes: applying a grid of electrically resistive material to a front exterior<br>
surface of the PF; applying a catalyst coating to at least one of the PF and the<br>
grid; estimating a temperature of the grid based on at least one of an exhaust<br>
composition and an exhaust temperature; and controlling the engine to produce<br><br>
a desired exhaust product to react with the catalyst coating to increase the<br>
estimated temperature of the grid.<br>
[0008] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0017] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that executes one<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or<br>
other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0018] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary vehicle 10 including a<br>
diesel engine system 11 is illustrated in accordance with various aspects of the<br>
present disclosure. It is appreciated that the diesel engine system 11 is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and that the particulate filter regeneration system described<br>
herein can be implemented in various engine systems implementing a particulate<br>
filter. Such engine systems may include, but are not limited to, gasoline direct<br>
injection engine systems and homogeneous charge compression ignition engine<br>
systems. For ease of the discussion, the disclosure will be discussed in the<br>
context of a diesel engine system.<br><br>
[0019] A turbocharged diesel engine system 11 includes an engine 12<br>
that combusts an air and fuel mixture to produce drive torque. Air enters the<br>
system by passing through an air filter 14. Air passes through the air filter 14 and<br>
is drawn into a turbocharger 18. The turbocharger 18 compresses the fresh air<br>
entering the system 11. The greater the compression of the air generally, the<br>
greater the output of the engine 12. Compressed air then passes through an air<br>
cooler 20 before entering into an intake manifold 22.<br>
[0020] Air within the intake manifold 22 is distributed into cylinders 26.<br>
Although four cylinders 26 are illustrated, it is appreciated that the systems and<br>
methods of the present disclosure can be implemented in engines having a<br>
plurality of cylinders including, but not limited to, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12<br>
cylinders. It is also appreciated that the systems and methods of the present<br>
disclosure can be implemented in a v-type cylinder configuration. Fuel is injected<br>
into the cylinders 26 by fuel injectors 28. Heat from the compressed air ignites<br>
the air/fuel mixture. Combustion of the air/fuel mixture creates exhaust. Exhaust<br>
exits the cylinders 26 into the exhaust system.<br>
[0021] The exhaust system includes an exhaust manifold 30, a diesel<br>
oxidation catalyst (catalyst) 32, and a particulate filter (PF) 34. Optionally, an<br>
EGR valve (not shown) re-circulates a portion of the exhaust back into the intake<br>
manifold 22. The remainder of the exhaust is directed into the turbocharger 18 to<br>
drive a turbine. The turbine facilitates the compression of the fresh air received<br>
from the air filter 14. Exhaust flows from the turbocharger 18 through the catalyst<br>
32 and the PF 34. The catalyst 32 oxidizes the exhaust based on the post<br><br>
combustion air/fuel ratio. The PF 34 receives exhaust from the catalyst 32 and<br>
filters any particulate matter particulates present in the exhaust.<br>
[0022] A control module 44 controls the engine 12 and PF regeneration<br>
based on various sensed and/or modeled information. More specifically, the<br>
control module 44 estimates particulate matter loading of the PF 34. When the<br>
estimated particulate matter loading achieves a threshold level (e.g., 5 grams/liter<br>
of particulate matter) and the exhaust flow rate is within a desired range, current<br>
is controlled to the PF 34 via a power source 46 to initiate the regeneration<br>
process. The duration of the regeneration process varies based upon the<br>
amount of particulate matter within the PF 34. It is anticipated, that the<br>
regeneration process can last between 1 - 6 minutes. Current is only applied,<br>
however, during an initial portion of the regeneration process. More specifically,<br>
the electric energy heats the face of the PF 34 for a threshold period (e.g., 1 - 2<br>
minutes). Exhaust passing through the front face is heated. The remainder of<br>
the regeneration process is achieved using the heat generated by combustion of<br>
the particulate matter present near the heated face of the PF 34 or by the heated<br>
exhaust passing through the PF 34.<br>
[0023] In some cases, high levels of exhaust flow from the engine 12<br>
prevent the face from reaching a sufficient temperature. To allow the face to<br>
properly heat, the PF 34 includes a catalyst coating as will be discussed further<br>
below. In general, the control module 44 controls the engine 12 to produce<br>
exhaust products that include increased Hydrocarbons (HC) and Carbon<br><br>
Monoxide (CO). The HC and CO react with the catalyst coating of the PF 34<br>
causing an increase in the temperature near the face of the PF 34.<br>
[0024] The control module 44 controls the engine exhaust products<br>
based on sensor signals and/or modeled data and the particulate filter<br>
regeneration methods and systems of the present disclosure. In various<br>
embodiments, an exhaust temperature sensor 47 generates an exhaust<br>
temperature signal based on a temperature of the exhaust. A mass airflow<br>
sensor 48 generates an exhaust air signal based on air entering or exiting the<br>
engine 12. A current and/or voltage sensor 49 generates a current and/or<br>
voltage signal based on the voltage and/or current supplied by the power<br>
source 46 to the PF 34. An oxygen sensor 51 generates an oxygen level signal<br>
based on a level of oxygen in the exhaust.<br>
[0025] In various embodiments, the control module 44 receives the<br>
signals and controls the engine 12 by, for example, commanding fuel to be<br>
injected in the exhaust after the combustion cycle via, for example, the fuel<br>
injector 28 or a post fuel injector 53 that injects fuel into the exhaust. In various<br>
other embodiments, the control module 44 controls the engine by controlling the<br>
air flow or valve timing.<br>
[0026] With particular reference to Figure 2, the PF 34 is preferably a<br>
monolith particulate trap and includes alternating closed cells/channels 50 and<br>
opened cells/channels 52. The cells/channels 50, 52 are typically square cross-<br>
sections, running axially through the part. Walls 58 of the PF 34 are preferably<br>
comprised of a porous ceramic honeycomb wall of cordierite material. It is<br><br>
appreciated that any ceramic comb material is considered within the scope of the<br>
present disclosure. Adjacent channels are alternatively plugged at each end as<br>
shown at 56. This forces the diesel aerosol through the porous substrate walls<br>
which act as a mechanical filter. Particulate matter is deposited within the closed<br>
channels 50 and exhaust exits through the opened channels 52. Particulate<br>
matter 59 flow into the PF 34 and are trapped therein.<br>
[0027] For regeneration purposes, a grid 64 including an electrically<br>
resistive material is attached to the front exterior surface referred to as the front<br>
face of the PF 34. Current is supplied to the resistive material to generate<br>
thermal energy. It is appreciated that thick film heating technology may be used<br>
to attach the grid 64 to the PF 34. For example, a heating material such as Silver<br>
or Nichrome may be coated then etched or applied with a mask to the front face<br>
of the PF 34. In various other embodiments, the grid 64 is composed of<br>
electrically resistive material such as stainless steel and attached to the PF 34<br>
using an adhesive or press fit to the PF 34.<br>
[0028] It is also appreciated that the resistive material may be applied<br>
in various single or multi-path patterns as shown in Figure 3. Segments of<br>
resistive material can be removed to generate the pathways. In various<br>
embodiments a perforated heater insert 70 as shown in Figure 4 may be<br>
attached to the front face of the PF 34. In any of the above mentioned<br>
embodiments, exhaust passing through the PF 34 carries thermal energy<br>
generated at the front face of the PF 34 a short distance down the channels 50,<br>
52. The increased thermal energy ignites the particulate matter present near the<br><br>
inlet of the PF 34. The heat generated from the combustion of the particulates is<br>
then directed through the PF 34 to induce combustion of the remaining<br>
particulates within the PF 34.<br>
[0029] With particular reference to Figure 5, in various embodiments a<br>
catalyst coating is additionally applied to the PF 34 or the grid 64. According to<br>
the present disclosure, the catalyst coating can be distributed in sub-sections of<br>
the PF 34 at varying densities optimized by an operating temperature of the PF<br>
34. As can be appreciated, the density of the catalyst coatings can be applied in<br>
a step-like format or a continuous or linear format.<br>
[0030] As shown in Figure 5, an exemplary PF 34 includes an inlet that<br>
allows the exhaust to enter the PF 34 and an outlet that allows the exhaust to exit<br>
the PF 34. The PF 34 includes a first sub-section 72 and a second sub-section<br>
74. The first sub-section 72 is located a first distance from the inlet. The second<br>
sub-section 74 is located a second distance from the inlet that is greater than the<br>
first distance. The first sub-section 72 is coated with catalysts at a first density.<br>
The first coating can include an oxidation catalyst that reduces HC and CO. The<br>
oxidation catalyst includes, but is not limited to, palladium, platinum, and/or the<br>
like. The second sub-section 74 can be coated with catalysts at a second<br>
density or alternatively, not coated at all. If coated, the second density is less<br>
than the first density. The second coating can also include an oxidation catalyst<br>
that reduces HC and CO, as discussed above.<br>
[0031] With particular reference to Figure 6, a dataflow diagram<br>
illustrates various embodiments of a particulate filter regeneration system that<br><br>
may be embedded within the control module 44. Various embodiments of<br>
particulate filter regeneration systems according to the present disclosure may<br>
include any number of sub-modules embedded within the control module 44.<br>
As can be appreciated, the sub-modules shown in Figure 6 may be combined<br>
and/or further partitioned to similarly control regeneration of the PF 34. Inputs<br>
to the system may be sensed from the vehicle 10 (Figure 1), received from<br>
other control modules (not shown) within the vehicle 10 (Figure 1), and/or<br>
determined by other sub-modules (not shown) within the control module 44. In<br>
various embodiments, the control module 44 of Figure 6 includes a<br>
regeneration control module 80, an engine control module 82, and a<br>
temperature module 84.<br>
[0032] The regeneration control module 80 receives as input a<br>
particulate matter level 86 indicating an estimated level of accumulated<br>
particulate matter present in the PF 34 (Figure 1) and an exhaust flow 88.<br>
Based on the particulate matter level 86 and the exhaust flow 88, the<br>
regeneration control module 80 determines whether regeneration is desired.<br>
For example, if the accumulated particulate matter level 86 is high and the<br>
exhaust flow 88 is sufficient to carry the combustion, the regeneration control<br>
module 80 determines that regeneration is desired.<br>
[0033] The regeneration control module 80 can also receive as input a<br>
grid temperature 93 (as will be discussed below). Once regeneration is desired<br>
and the grid temperature 93 is within a predetermined range, the regeneration<br><br>
control module 80 generates a current control signal 94 that controls current to<br>
the PF 34 (Figure 1) to heat the face of the PF 34 (Figure 1).<br>
[0034] The temperature module 84 receives as input an oxygen level<br>
96, an exhaust flow 98, an exhaust temperature 100, and a current/voltage 102.<br>
The temperature module 84 predicts the grid temperature 93 of the grid 64<br>
(Figure 2) based on one or more of the inputs 96-102. In general, the<br>
temperature module 84 predicts the grid temperature 93 based on a<br>
composition of the engine exhaust as well as the exhaust temperature 100.<br>
[0035] In various embodiments, the temperature module 84 can<br>
estimate the grid temperature 93 based on whether the catalyst 32 (Figure 1) is<br>
provided. For example, when the catalyst 32 (Figure 1) is provided, the grid<br>
temperature 93 is estimated as a function of a particulate filter exotherm,<br>
exhaust flow 98, a particulate filter temperature, and/or combinations thereof.<br>
The particulate filter exotherm can be estimated as a function of engine exhaust<br>
products, the oxygen level 96, catalyst efficiency, and/or combinations thereof.<br>
The engine exhaust products can be estimated based on a combustion strategy<br>
(e.g., fuel to air ratio, and/or valve timing). The particulate filter temperature<br>
can be estimated as a function of exhaust temperature 100 and/or catalyst<br>
exotherm. In various other embodiments, the temperature module 84 can<br>
estimate the grid temperature 93 based on the current/voltage value 102 and/or<br>
the exhaust flow 98.<br>
[0036] The engine control module 82 receives as input the grid<br>
temperature 93. If the grid temperature 93 is outside of a predetermined<br><br>
desired range, the engine control module 82 can generate at least one of a fuel<br>
control signal 104 and an air control signal 106 to control the composition of the<br>
exhaust flowing to the PF 34 (Figure 1). For example, the engine can be<br>
controlled to produce an increased level of HCs and/or CO in the exhaust so<br>
that a reaction may occur with the catalyst coating to increase the grid<br>
temperature 93. In various embodiments, the engine control module 82<br>
controls the engine 12 (Figure 1) based on whether a catalyst 32 (Figure 1) is<br>
present.<br>
[0037] With particular reference to Figure 7, a flowchart illustrates an<br>
exemplary particulate filter regeneration method that can be performed by the<br>
particulate filter regeneration system of Figure 6 in accordance with various<br>
aspects of the present disclosure. As can be appreciated, the order of<br>
execution of the steps of the exemplary particulate filter regeneration method<br>
can vary without altering the spirit of the method. The exemplary particulate<br>
filter regeneration method may be performed periodically during control module<br>
operation or scheduled to run based on certain events.<br>
[0038] In one example, the method may begin at 200. The PF 34<br>
(Figure 1) is evaluated to determine if regeneration is desired at 210. If the PF<br>
34 (Figure 1) is full and regeneration is desired at 210, the grid temperature 93<br>
is estimated as discussed above at 220 and evaluated at 230 and 240.<br>
Otherwise, if regeneration is not desired at 210, the method may end at 270.<br>
[0039] At 230, if the grid temperature 93 is below a predetermined<br>
optimal temperature threshold (first threshold) and the grid temperature 93 is<br><br>
above a catalytic combustion temperature threshold (second threshold) at 240,<br>
then the engine 12 (Figure 1) is controlled to produce a desired exhaust product<br>
at 250. Once the grid temperature 93 is above the predetermined optimal<br>
temperature threshold at 230, current is controlled to the grid 64 (Figure 2) at<br>
260. The method may end at 270. However, if the grid temperature 93 falls<br>
below the catalytic combustion temperature threshold at 240, the method may<br>
end at 270.<br>
[0040] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has been<br>
described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the<br>
disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings and<br>
specification.<br><br>

surface of the PF;<br>
applying a catalyst coating to at least one of the PF and the grid;<br>
estimating a temperature of the grid based on at least one of an<br>
exhaust composition and an exhaust temperature; and<br>
controlling the engine to produce a desired exhaust product to<br>
react with the catalyst coating to increase the estimated temperature of the grid.<br>
10.	The method of claim 9 wherein the estimating the temperature of<br>
the grid is based on at least one of a composition of the exhaust and an<br>
exhaust temperature.<br>
11.	The method of claim 9 further comprising providing a catalyst<br>
upstream from the PF and wherein the estimating the temperature of the grid is<br>
based on a presence of the catalyst.<br>
12.	The method of claim 11 wherein the estimating the temperature of<br>
the grid is based on at least one of a particulate filter exotherm, a particulate<br>
filter temperature, and an exhaust flow.<br><br>
13.	The method of claim 12 further comprising estimating the<br>
particulate filter temperature based on an exhaust temperature and a catalyst<br>
exotherm.<br>
14.	The method of claim 12 further comprising estimating the<br>
particulate filter exotherm based on at least one of a composition of the exhaust<br>
and an efficiency of the catalyst.<br>
15.	The method of claim 9 further comprising heating the grid by<br>
supplying current to the electrically resistive material.<br>
16.	The method of claim 15 wherein the heating the grid is performed<br>
once the estimated temperature is above a predetermined threshold.<br>
17.	The method of claim 15 further comprising inducing combustion of<br>
particulates present on the front surface of the PF via the heated grid.<br>
18.	The method of claim 17 further comprising directing heat<br>
generated by combustion of the particulates into the PF to induce combustion<br>
of particulates within the PF.<br><br>
19.	The method of claim 15 further comprising controlling the current<br>
to initiate regeneration during an initial period of a PF regeneration cycle.<br>
20.	The method of claim 19 further comprising estimating an amount of<br>
particulates within the PF and wherein the controlling is performed when the<br>
amount exceeds a threshold amount.<br><br>
An exhaust system that processes exhaust generated by an engine is<br>
provided. The system generally includes a particulate filter (PF) that filters<br>
particulates from the exhaust wherein an upstream end of the PF receives<br>
exhaust from the engine. A grid of electrically resistive material is applied to an<br>
exterior upstream surface of the PF and selectively heats exhaust passing<br>
through the grid to initiate combustion of particulates within the PF. A catalyst<br>
coating applied to at least one of the PF and the grid. A control module<br>
estimates a temperature of the grid and controls the engine to produce a<br>
desired exhaust product to increase the temperature of the grid.</td>
