DESCRIPTION IN-VEHICLE  AC   GENERATOR<br>
Technical   Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an in-vehicle AC generator mounted in a vehicle such as an automobile. Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
An in-vehicle AC generator mounted in a vehicle such as an automobile and driven by an internal-combustion engine is provided with a rectifier that converts an AC voltage induced across the stator winding thereof into a DC voltage, and a regulator that adjusts a voltage induced across the stator winding thereof. In general, the regulator is provided with a circuit unit having a circuit that adjusts a voltage induced across the stator winding, and a heat sink that makes contact with the surface of the circuit unit and radiates heat generated in the circuit unit; the regulator is mounted in a regulator holding unit. The regulator holding unit, a brush holding unit that holds a brush, and an external terminal holding unit that holds an external terminal for connecting the regulator with an external apparatus are integrally assembled in a regulator assembly. The regulator assembly is mounted at an axis-direction end of the AC generator,<br>
[0003]<br>
In a conventional in-vehicle AC generator, a regulator<br><br>
holding unit provided in a regulator assembly includes a containing portion for containing a circuit unit of a regulator; three sides of the containing portion are surrounded by a wall member and the rest is opened.  The circuit unit of the regulator is contained in the containing portion of the regulator holding unit; three peripheral sides of a heat sink adhered to the circuit unit are adhered to a wall member that surrounds the containing portion. In the containing portion of the regulator holding unit, the contained circuit unit is protected and held by a curable resin that is filled into the containing portion through the opened side (for example, refer to Patent Documents 1 and 2).

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0005]<br>
In a conventional in-vehicle AC generator, there have been problems described below. Because, in the regulator holding unit, only three sides among four peripheral sides of the heat sink of the regulator are adhered to the wall member, the holding strength of the heat sink is not sufficient; moreover, because one peripheral<br><br>
side of the containing portion that contains the circuit unit of the regulator is opened even after the regulator is mounted, the resin filled in the containing portion is exposed to the outside, whereby change with time is liable to cause the resin to be deteriorated, and the holding strength for the circuit unit lowers . [0006]<br>
The present invention has been implemented in order to solve tlis foregoing problems in a conventional in-vehicle AC generator; the objective thereof is to obtain an in-vehicle AC generator provided with a regulator holding unit capable of robustly holding a regulator and reducing deterioration in a resin filled in a containing portion that contains a circuit unit of the regulator. Means for Solving the Problems [0007]<br>
An in-vehicle AC generator according to the present invention is provided with a stator fixed to a bracket; a stator winding provided on the stator; a rotor shaft pivotably supported by the bracket; a rotor that is fixed on the rotor shaft and disposed in a space situated more proximal from the rotor shaft than the stator; a magnetic-field winding provided on the rotor; a slip ring that is fixed on the rotor shaft and electrically connected with the magnetic-field winding; a brush that makes contact with the slip ring and supplies a magnetic-field current to the magnetic-field winding; a regulator having a circuit unit provided with a circuit for adjusting the value of a voltage generated across<br><br>
the stator winding and a neat sink that is adhered to a surface of the circuit unit and radiates heat generated in the circuit unit; and a regulator assembly having a brush holding unit that slidably holds the brush, a regulator holding unit that holds the regulator, and a connecter holding unit that holds a connecter for connecting the regulator with an external terminal. The regulator holding unit is provided with a containing portion in which at least the whole periphery of an opening is surrounded by a wall member; the circuit unit is inserted into the containing portion through the opening; the heat sink is held by the containing portion in such a way that the peripheral portion thereof is adhered to the wall member that surrounds the whole periphery of the opening, and closes the opening; and the containing portion is provided with a resin filled in the vicinity of the contained circuit unit. Advantages of the Invention [0008]<br>

The regulator assembly 50 is fixed to the rear bracket 4 at both sides of the regulator holding unit 53 and at a space proximal from the rotor shaft; therefore, the excitation force exerted on the heat sink 522 and the circuit unit 521 of the regulator 52 can be suppressed to a minimum quantity.<br><br>
[0017]<br>
The regulator holding unit 53 is provided with a rectangular containing portion 532 whose four peripheral sides are formed of a wall member 531 and a.n opening 533 that is opened in the rotor-shaft center axis direction, i.e., in the direction that is perpendicular to the center axis X of the rotor shaft penetration portion 51. The whole periphery of the opening 533 is surrounded by the wall member 531. The circuit unit 521 of the regulator 52 is inserted into and contained in the containing portion 532 of the regulator holding unit 53, through the opening 533. The whole peripheral sides of the heat sink 522, formed in a rectangular shape, of the regulator 52, i.e., four sides of a rectangular peripheral portion 5211 are adhered by the intermediary of an adhesive to the inside of the wall member 531 that forms the end portions of four sides of the containing portion 532, thereby closing the opening 533 of the containing portion 532. The circuit unit 521, which is contained in the containing portion 532, of the regulator 52 is disposed in such a way that the surface 5211 of the circuit board to which the heat sink 522 is adhered is perpendicular to the center axis X of the rotor shaft penetration portion 51. The regulator<br>
52	including the circuit unit 521 and the heat sink 522 adhered to the circuit unit 521 is mounted in the regulator holding unit<br>
53	from a side, of the regulator assembly 50, which is distal from the rotor 20.<br>
[0018]<br><br>
In EEibodimenL 1, nhe longitudinal side and the transverse side of the rectangle zz the heat sink 522 for the regularor 52 are set to be longer than the longitudinal side and the transverse side of the circuit unit 521, and only the peripheral portion of theheat sink522 is adhered to the wall portion 531 with an adhesive; however, it may be allowed that the longitudinal sides and the transverse sides of the heat sink 522 and the circuit unit 521 are set to the same dimensions, and the peripheral portions of both the heat sink 522 and the circuit unit 521 are adhered to the wall portion 531 with an adhesive. In this case, the regulator 52 is more robustly held by the regulator holding unit 53. Moreover, it may be allowed that the dimension of only one of the longitudinal and transverse sides of the heat sink 522 is set to be the same as the dimension of the corresponding side of the circuit unit 521, and the peripheral portions of the sides, of the heat sink 522 and the circuit unit 521, which have the same dimension are adhered to the wall portion 531 with an adhesive. Still moreover^ it may be allowed that none of the heat sink 522 and the circuit unit 521 is rectangular, or it may be allowed that only one of the heat sink 522 and the circuit unit 521 Is rectangular and the other has a shape other than a rectangle. [0019]<br>
The brush holding unit 56 is disposed in such a way as to extend from the side face of the rotor shaft penetration portion 51 in the direction perpendicular to the center axis Xand is provided<br><br>
with a pair of i:hrcugh-hole3 561 and 562 that slidably hold the brushes 54 and 55. As illustrated in FIG. 1, the pair of brushes 54 and 55 thiat is held by the brush holding unit 55 are always pressed, inside the through-holes 561 and 562, hy the springs 541 and 551, respectively, toward the slip rings 14 and 15 in such a way as to make contact with the surfaces of the slip rings 14 and 15. In the brush holding unit 56, there are provided terminals (uniilustratcd) connected with the respective brushes 54 and 55; the terminals are soldered with the circuit unit 521 of the regulator 52 at a side, of the regulator assembly 50, which is distal from the rotor 20, by the intermediary of lead pins. [0020]<br>
One end portion 571 of the connecter holding unit 57 is fixed to a wall portion 5311 that forms one side of the containing unit 53; the connecter holding unit 57 is disposed in such a way as to extend from the one end portion 57T. to the other end portion 572 in the direction perpendicular to the center axis X of the rotor shaft penetration portion 51. The connector 58 held hy the connecter holding unit 57 connects the circuit unit 521 of the regulator 52 with an external terminal (unillustrated) that is connected with a vehicle control apparatus (unillustrated). Accordingly, the circuit unit 521 of the regulator 50 receives a control signal from the control apparatus by way of the connecter 58, and controls the magnetic-field current so as to control the AC voltage induced across the stator winding 2.<br><br>
[0021]<br>
As illustrated in FIGS. 3 and ^, a pair of resin filling holes 591 and 592 is provided in the walj portion 5311 of the containing portion 532 to which the one end portion 571 of the connecter holding unit 57 is fixed. The resin filling holes 591 and 592 are provided with taper surfaces 5911 and 5921, respectively, for gradually reducing the cross-sectional areas thereof from the outside to the inside of the containing portion 532, [0022]<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 10, a rear plate 601 is mounted on a side face, of the regulator assembly 50, which is proximal from the rotor 20, i.e., on the side face, of the regulator assembly 50, which is opposite to the side face on which the heat sink 522 of the regulator 52 is exposed to the outside; a noise-preventing capacitor 60 is fixed to the rear plate 601. The noise-preventing capacitor 50 is provided with terminals soldered with wound film-shaped capacitor element that are contained in the rear plate 601 that forms a resin case, and molded in a thin-plate shape with an epoxy resin. [0023]<br>
In the regulator assembly 50 configured as described above,. the circuit unit 521 of the regulator 52 is inserted into the containing portion 532 of the regulator holding unit 53, through the opening 533, and the four peripheral sides of the heat sinlc are adhered to the inside of the wall portion 531 with an adhesive.<br><br>
50 rhat the regulator 52 is held by the regulator holding unit 53, Next, through the cair of resin filling holes 591 and 592, a liquid thermosetting resin 61 is filled into the containing portion 532 and hardened with heat. The resin 61 sealed and hardened in the containing portion 532 robustly fixes the circuit unit 521 within the containing portion 532. When the thermosetting resin 61 is filled, because the pair of resin filling holes 591 and 592 is provided, air is readily released from the containing portion 532 even though the thermosetting resin has high viscosity; thus, residual airinthe filled thermosetting resin 61 can be eliminated. [0024]<br>
The brushes 54 and 55 in a pair are inserted into the through-holes 561 and 562, respectively, in a pair; moreover, as illustrated in FIG. 10, the rear plate 601 is fixed at the side face, of the regulator assembly 50, which is distal from the renulater 52 . [0025]<br>
As illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, the regulator assembly 50 assembled as described above is disposed at a space where the C shape of the rectifier assembly 30 opens, and is fixed to the rear bracket 4 with screws 21 and 22, with the rotor shaft penetration portion 51 penetrated by the rotor shaft 9. In this situation, the other end portion 572 of the connecter holding unit 57 in the regulator assembly 50 makes contact with a face portion 41 of the rear bracket 4 and held by the rear bracket 4 .  FIG. 2 illustrates<br><br>
a state in tvhich the brushes 54 and 55 have not made contact with<br>
the surfaces cf "he slip rings 14 and 15.<br>
[0026]<br>
In the in-vehicle AC generator according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention, because all the four peripheral sides of the heat sink 522 are adhered to the wall portion 531 of the containing portion 532 with an adhesive, the regulator 52 can robustly be fixed to the regulator holding unit 53.  With regard to the containing portion 532 of the regulator holding unit 53, the four sides are formed of the wall portion 531; therefore, unlike a conventional apparatus, the resin €1 filled in the containing portion 532 is not largely exposed to the outside through one side, of the containing portion 532, which does not have any wall portion. As a result, deterioration in the resin due to change with time can be reduced, whereby the circuit unit 521 can robustly be protected and held. [0027]<br>
Because being disposed in a space where the C shape of the rectifier assembly 30 opens, the regulator assembly 50 can compactly be fixed to the rear bracket 4; moreover, because the regulator assembly 50 is robustly fixed to the rear bracket with the screws 22 and 23, the detachment thereof due to a vibration exerted on the circuit unit 521 or the heat sink 522 can be prevented. Still moreover, because the thermosetting resin 61 is filled in the containing portion 532, adhesion between the thermosetting resin<br><br><br>
