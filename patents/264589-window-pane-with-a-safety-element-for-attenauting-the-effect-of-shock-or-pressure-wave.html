The invention relates to a window pane with a safety element More particularly the<br>
invention relates to a window pane with safety element for attenuating the effect of a<br>
pressure or shock wave.<br>
European patent application EP 0319695 A1 discloses a structure of plates to be<br>
assembled to a supporting structure for the formation of a facade or a roof in a<br>
building. The structure of plates consists of a glass insulating plate made of several<br>
panes and a supporting frame bonded to the rear edge of the plates. The bonded<br>
assembly is, in this instance, attached by mechanical supports placed at certain points.<br>
The individual supports are assembled fixedly to the outer edge of the structure of<br>
plates for the formation of a structural unit, without extending up to their front outer<br>
face. They couple via the rear, furthermore without contact, a girdle of the supporting<br>
frame-oriented toward the structure of plates. The anchoring of the supports to the<br>
outer pane may for example be provided such that the supports engage in notches in'<br>
the peripheral rim of the outer pane of the glass insulating plate. In another<br>
embodiment, the supports engage in certain locations in a U-channel placed in the<br>
hollow peripheral space of the glass insulating plate.<br>
European patent application EP 0320 674 A2 relates to a plate consisting of individual<br>
panes with retention and/or safety members. The aforementioned plate consists of two<br>
sheets of glass bonded, by means of a layer of transparent adhesive, to one another<br>
and with first edge portions of the retention and/or safety members penetrating into<br>
. the latter. The retention and/or safety members consist essentially of a flexible pad,<br>
which' is preferably formed by a threaded fabric. The second edge portion of the<br>
retention and/or safety member emerging from the plate is attached to an<br>
infrastructure. When the plate is assembled to another pane oriented toward the<br>
infrastructure, in the manner<br><br>
of an insulating glazing unit, the outward-oriented<br>
plate is protected against destruction in the event of<br>
this assembly being ruined.<br>
German utility model DE 20 2004 005 639 U1 discloses an<br>
explosion-prevention sash-glass composite which<br>
consists of a glass plate consisting of several panes<br>
and a metal channel frame receiving the glass plate.<br>
Between the individual panes of the glass plate there<br>
is a band of fabric or of plastic material with high<br>
tear strength bonded so that a pad of the band of<br>
fabric or of plastic material emerges from the glass<br>
plate. This pad is fed at right angles around the front<br>
face of the glass plate in the direction of the face<br>
situated opposite the effect of the explosion, and<br>
bonded, or bonded and additionally screwed to the metal<br>
channel frame.<br>
European patent application EP 1 035 295 A2 discloses a<br>
window exposed to a pressure wave, in which the<br>
retention elements attached to the window sash are<br>
placed on the face of the window situated opposite the<br>
pressure wave. The retention elements are outside the<br>
window pane, consist of steel or plastic cables and<br>
contain energy-absorbing devices, for example elements<br>
with springs. If a pressure wave occurs, the window<br>
pane is deformed, is blown out of the window sash and<br>
is held by the retention elements. In this manner, the<br>
axial movement of the window pane toward the inside of<br>
the premises is prevented and the kinetic energy is<br>
nullified.<br>
The solutions known in the prior art for attaching<br>
window panes have various disadvantages.<br>
For example, when one end of the safety elements is<br>
placed in the intermediate layer of laminated panes<br>
consisting of several individual panes assembled<br>
together over the whole surface and another end is fed<br><br>
laterally out of the laminated pane (EP 0 320 674 A2,<br>
DE 20 2004 005 639 U1), the laminated panes must be<br>
manufactured separately for each size of window. It is<br>
not possible to cut the laminated panes in a large<br>
plate of standard dimensions, as for the manufacture of<br>
other windows. Because of this, the costs increase<br>
substantially due to individual or short-run<br>
manufacture.<br>
This is also valid for the solutions in which the outer<br>
plate of a window pane is provided with reliefs or<br>
bevels to which the retention elements can be coupled.<br>
There is also here a costly operation of machining (of<br>
the glass). In the embodiment according to document<br>
EP 0 319 695 A1, there arises an additional<br>
disadvantage in that the glass insulating plates are<br>
assembled rigidly to the infrastructure or to a sash by<br>
means of supports. When this solution must be used for<br>
a glazing unit attenuating a pressure or shock wave,<br>
the infrastructure or the sash with its possible<br>
battens for attaching the glass and the glass<br>
insulating plates must be dimensioned so as to<br>
withstand the impulsion generated by this load. Nor<br>
must the glass insulating plates deform under the load<br>
to the point of being blown out of their sash. The<br>
dimensions of the various components must in this case<br>
be relatively voluminous and solid.<br>
The aforementioned disadvantages are certainly not<br>
present in the retention elements known via document<br>
EP 1 035 295 A2, because they elastically capture the<br>
window pane blown out of its sash by a shock wave. The<br>
retention elements consisting of wires or cables,<br>
visible from the outside, however prevent the clear<br>
view through the window and unfavorably influence the<br>
appearance of the window or even of the whole building.<br>
The problem at the basis of the invention consists in<br>
procuring an improved window pane, attenuating the<br><br>
effect of a pressure or shock wave after an explosion<br>
in the manner of an insulating pane, which can be<br>
provided with retention elements and which can be<br>
manufactured simply and economically.<br>
According to the invention, this problem is solved by<br>
the characterizing part of claim 1. The independent<br>
claims 16 and 17 relate to a window or a door with such<br>
a window pane. The features of the dependent claims<br>
disclose advantageous embodiments of these objects.<br>
The window pane according to the invention is<br>
constructed in the manner of an insulating pane, so it<br>
consists of at least two panes, which are assembled<br>
together by their edges by means of a spacing frame.<br>
Assembly is usually by bonding, in which the outer rims<br>
of the panes extend beyond the spacing frame, so as to<br>
form at the edge of the window pane an outward opening<br>
groove.<br>
When the window pane must also provide an insulation<br>
effect, the space between the panes is gas-sealed and<br>
filled with a gas preventing thermal exchange. This gas<br>
may also be air at a reduced pressure relative to the<br>
atmospheric pressure. In a manner known per se, the<br>
spacing frame may be fitted with a reservoir with a<br>
desiccating agent, which is provided with openings<br>
toward the intermediate space of the pane. This<br>
effectively prevents the formation of humidity by<br>
condensation.<br>
According to the invention, a flexible, elongated<br>
safety element, for example in the form of a metal<br>
cable or wire, is placed in the edge groove of the<br>
window pane, at least one end of the safety element<br>
being fed out of the edge groove and thus emerging<br>
beyond the outer dimensions of the window pane. The<br>
safety element itself consists of a material which may<br>
resist the impulsion of a window pane pushed out of its<br><br>
sash due to a pressure wave. The window pane is<br>
therefore captured with the aid of its safety element,<br>
which is attached to an element of sash or of building<br>
by its end fed out of the edge groove, and is prevented<br>
from making an uncontrolled movement.<br>
When the window pane according to the invention must be<br>
used in an opening window, the safety element may be<br>
attached to both an opening sash and a fixed sash.<br>
During the attachment to a fixed sash, the end of the<br>
safety element emerging from the window pane must<br>
naturally be sufficiently long for it to be still<br>
possible to perform a movement/an opening of the window<br>
that may be necessary. In particular, in a pivoting<br>
window, this arrangement does not however pose any<br>
problems, because the necessary extra length of the<br>
emerging end of the safety element is relatively short.<br>
In a fixed window, the safety element may be anchored<br>
in the building itself, independently of the window<br>
sash.<br>
Because the window pane is attached by means of the<br>
safety element, independently of the sash that contains<br>
it (and of its glass retention battens), the sash may<br>
be manufactured in a substantially less costly and<br>
solid manner than is necessary for a window device<br>
attenuating the effect of a pressure or shock wave<br>
without a safety element. The last-mentioned window<br>
devices must in particular be designed so that the sash<br>
holds the window pane in all cases. In addition, the<br>
window pane itself must be made in a correspondingly<br>
rigid manner, so that it can support the impulse of an<br>
explosion, must not deform and consequently must not be<br>
blown out of the sash. On the contrary, both the sash<br>
and its fitting, therefore the window frame itself,<br>
may, with the window pane according to the invention,<br>
be manufactured in a simpler and lighter manner (less<br>
'solid) , because the window pane will be sure to be<br>
captured after having been blown out of the sash.<br><br>
The window pane according to the invention is also<br>
particularly suitable for equipping existing windows or<br>
doors. Because of the variability and flexibility of<br>
the ends of the safety element fed out of the window<br>
pane, their attachment to an existing sash or in a<br>
building opening already present is possible easily and<br>
at a low cost.<br>
Given that the safety elements must withstand high<br>
forces, materials with a high tear strength are used.<br>
In this respect, wires, cables, cords and fabrics made<br>
of. steel or high strength plastic are found to be of<br>
value. Because of the flexibility of said forms of<br>
safety elements, the latter may be easily placed in the<br>
edge groove of the window pane and have an end fed to<br>
the outside.<br>
In the case where there is a risk that the safety<br>
element is ripped out of the edge groove in ' the event<br>
of load, it may be attached to the spacing frame, for<br>
example by welding or brazing for the metal materials,<br>
or by bonding. When the spacing frame consists of<br>
prefabricated battens and corner elements assembling<br>
the latter to one another, safety elements may already<br>
be provided by the manufacturer of the spacing frame.<br>
In particular, the corner elements are recommended for<br>
this variant, because the latter are identical for all<br>
the dimensions of panes, while elongated channel<br>
battens must each time be cut to the appropriate length<br>
for the pane.<br>
In the variant with the safety elements inserted into<br>
the edge groove, the two ends of the latter may also be<br>
fed out of the edge groove, to thus achieve a better<br>
anchorage to an infrastructure. A safety element may<br>
therefore be placed in an edge groove so that the first<br>
end of the safety element emerges for example at the<br>
top and the other end emerges at the bottom of the<br><br>
window pane. The safety element may however also run<br>
round the window pane once, forming a "U", or several<br>
times, inside a peripheral edge groove. The ends of the<br>
safety element may then leave the periphery of the<br>
window pane outside the edge groove, via their<br>
imaginary extension in any corner.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, several safety<br>
elements are placed in one or more edge grooves, the<br>
window pane again being able to be circumvented only<br>
once or several times.<br>
The safety elements may also be placed in the guide<br>
elements placed in the edge grooves. The guide elements<br>
may be envisaged for example as U-shaped or C-shaped<br>
battens and also as closed tubes. The guide elements<br>
may be placed locally inside the edge groove or also<br>
over a major portion of its length. The opening of the'<br>
C or U may in this instance face the spacing frame or<br>
also the opposite direction. In addition to their<br>
guidance function, the guide elements may also provide<br>
a better distribution of the load and relieve weight<br>
from the spacing frame.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the guide, elements are, in a<br>
known manner, incorporated into the spacing frame, due<br>
to the fact that the face of the latter oriented'away<br>
from the intermediate space of the pane is C-shaped or'<br>
U-shaped and is provided with a hollow tubular space.<br>
Such a channel for a spacing frame is known for example<br>
through German patent application DE 35 16 875 A1. This<br>
patent application also discloses spacing channels with<br>
an extension emerging from the face of the pane, which<br>
may be inserted into the groove of a frame for the<br>
attachment of the pane.<br>
Usually, to seal the intermediate space of the pane,<br>
the peripheral edge groove is filled in with a bonding<br>
and/or sealing mass as a secondary sealing pad, in<br><br>
addition to the bonding of the spacing frame with the<br>
panes. This filler may be used in a particularly<br>
advantageous manner to attach the safety and/or guide<br>
elements in the edge groove. Particularly when the<br>
safety elements or the guide elements are not attached<br>
to the spacing frame, the aforementioned peripheral<br>
filler may be used for the attachment of the safety<br>
and/or guide elements, without an additional operation<br>
being necessary. The filler therefore blocks off the<br>
intermediate space of the pane of the insulating<br>
glazing unit and attaches the safety elements in its<br>
edge groove at the same time.<br>
The panes assembled together by means of a spacing<br>
frame to form the window pane according to the<br>
invention must usually be panes reinforced for the<br>
intended purpose, that is to attenuate the effect of a<br>
pressure or shock wave after an explosion. As a<br>
reinforced pane, a wired glass pane can be used for<br>
example. However laminated panes are preferred, which<br>
consist of at least two individual panes assembled to<br>
one another at the surface. The individual panes may<br>
consist of plastic, glass or (partially) prestressed<br>
glass. Composites made of glass panes and panes or<br>
sheets of resilient plastic, which consist for example<br>
of polyethylene terephthalate or polycarbonate, are<br>
particularly strong. The individual panes may be<br>
assembled together by means of a layer of thermoplastic<br>
adhesive, for example of polyvinylbutyral, or by means<br>
of a layer of casting resin. As required, a splinter-<br>
retention sheet may also be deposited on the surface<br>
facing toward the outside of the laminated pane.<br>
In many cases, for example when the window pane<br>
according to the invention has to resist particularly<br>
powerful shock or pressure waves, it may be necessary<br>
to assemble the panes, with the spacing frame in a<br>
particularly secure manner, to prevent a breakage of<br>
the composite and thus a separation of one of the<br><br>
panes. One possibility of ensuring this aspect consists<br>
in enlarging the bonding surface between the spacing<br>
frame and the panes, therefore using spacing channels<br>
of larger cross section with a larger bonding surface<br>
than those used for the usual insulating glazing units.<br>
Another possibility for ensuring the assembly of the<br>
panes consists in arranging additional channels in the<br>
form of fasteners, which run round the edge of the<br>
pane. These channel fasteners may for example be made<br>
of spring steel and remain on the window pane and thus<br>
fulfill their function only through their elastic<br>
force. Other materials may however also be envisaged,<br>
to the extent that they have the necessary strength. If<br>
the channel fasteners do not exert any elastic force,<br>
they must be attached in another manner, for example by<br>
means of a bonded assembly. An appropriate secondary<br>
seal filler mass may be used as adhesive for the<br>
composite glazing unit or an additional adhesive is<br>
used. The aforementioned channel fasteners made of<br>
spring steel may of course be additionally bonded to<br>
the window pane. The channel fasteners are placed<br>
either locally on one or more of the rims of the pane<br>
or over the whole length of one or more of the rims of<br>
the pane.<br>
Other details and advantages of the object of the<br>
invention will appear, without intended limitation,<br>
through the drawings of exemplary embodiments of window<br>
panes with safety elements according to the present<br>
invention and through their detailed description that<br>
follows.<br>

in which the two ends of the safety element are fed out<br>
of the edge groove in opposite corners;<br>
Fig. 7 represents a variant of the window pane, in<br>
which two safety elements surround the spacing frame in<br>
the shape of a U; and<br>
Fig. 8 shows a corner bracket of one embodiment, in<br>
which the safety element is attached directly to the<br>
corner bracket of the spacing frame.<br>
According to Fig. 1, a window pane 1 according to the<br>
invention consists of two panes 2, 3, made of laminated,<br>
glass, that are fixedly bonded together with<br>
interposition of channels 4 of a spacing frame and<br>
enclosing between them a space 5. The intermediate<br>
space 5 is filled with a gas which resists the transfer<br>
of heat. Each, of the panes 2, 3 consists of three<br>
prestressed glass panes assembled together by means of<br>
polyvinylbutyral thermoplastic adhesive sheets or other<br>
appropriate adhesive materials and thus forms<br><br>
reinforced panes known per se. In the context of the<br>
invention, as has already been mentioned, plastic panes<br>
may however of course also be used, for example but not<br>
exclusively as the central pane in the triple<br>
composite.<br>
The channel 4 of the spacing frame has a hollow space<br>
6, into which tabs of other channels, in particular<br>
corner connectors, may be inserted. In this manner,<br>
channel parts and spacing frames of any length can be<br>
manufactured. The corner connectors may have different<br>
angles, so that it is possible to produce window panes<br>
having any number of corners. The points of abutment of<br>
the channels must naturally be joined and filled<br>
securely together.<br>
Another hollow space 7 in the channel 4 is filled with<br>
a hygroscopic agent. Openings 8 connect the hollow<br>
space 7 with the intermediate space 5 of the pane, so<br>
that the hygroscopic agent can act on the gas in the<br>
space 5. This effectively prevents the condensation of<br>
water vapor on the inner faces of the panes 2 and 3.<br>
In addition to its. bonding with the panes 2 and 3, the<br>
channel 4 and then the intermediate space 5 of the pane<br>
is filled with a sealing mass 9 (for example<br>
polysulfide). The channel 4 is placed between the panes<br>
2 and 3 so as to form a recessed edge groove 10. This<br>
groove 10 receives both the sealing mass 9 and a steel<br>
safety element 11 in the form of a cable.<br>
In the representations that follow, identical	elements<br>
are indicated by the same reference numbers	and they<br>
are not explained again, to the extent that	they are<br>
not modified relative to Fig. 1.<br>
The safety element 11 in Fig. 2 is also a steel cable<br>
which, unlike the embodiment according to Fig. 1, has<br>
however been placed in the edge groove 10 before the<br><br>
intermediate space of the pane is filled in by means of<br>
the sealing mass 9. First, the safety element 11 may in<br>
this manner be attached simply, which makes handling<br>
easier before the window pane is installed and<br>
transported. Secondly, the reaction forces to be<br>
transmitted between the safety element 11 and the<br>
window pane 1 are distributed over a larger area of the<br>
panes 2 or 3 and over the spacing channel 4. Because of<br>
this, the safety and/or the load limit of the window<br>
pane are increased.<br>
Fig. 3 represents an embodiment of the window pane 1<br>
according to the invention, in which the safety element<br>
11 is also guided. Accordingly, a spacing channel 40<br>
has a tubular recess 12 through which the safety<br>
element in the form of a cable 11 is placed. The corner<br>
connectors for the channels 40 may be configured so<br>
that the recess 12 is free at the point of junction<br>
with the channel 40 and that the safety element 11 can<br>
thus be fed out of the edge groove 10. It is however<br>
equally possible to provide the tubular recess 12, in<br>
any location along the channel 40, with an opening in<br>
the direction of the edge groove 10, to feed the safety<br>
element 11 out of the latter. In both cases, the<br>
position of the safety element 11 must naturally be<br>
fixed and its ends be fed out of the surface of the<br>
pane, before the sealing mass 9 is applied.<br>
Unlike the representation, the recess in the spacing<br>
channel could also open over the whole length toward<br>
the outer rim of the window pane 1 (in the form of a<br>
channel or groove) . Instead of a recess, it is also<br>
possible to imagine providing for the safety element a<br>
separate guide channel which is either sunk into the<br>
peripheral seal independently of the spacing channel or<br>
fixedly attached to the latter.<br>
The section represented in Fig. 4 shows a variant of<br>
the embodiment according to Fig. 2, in which one<br><br>
channel fastener or several local channel fasteners 14<br>
are placed along the rims of the window pane. The<br>
channel fasteners 14 encompass the two panes 2 and 3 in<br>
their edge region. They are made of spring steel and<br>
have, after they have been installed, a strong<br>
prestress such that the panes 2 and 3 cannot separate<br>
from one another, even in the case of possible breakage<br>
by overload of their bonded assembly with the spacing<br>
frame channels. They also encompass the safety element<br>
11 and may ensure the position respectively the<br>
retention of the latter in the edge groove.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a window pane 1 according to the invention<br>
seen in elevation, with the pane 3 and the spacing<br>
frame 4 masked by the latter and represented<br>
schematically as broken lines. The safety element 11 is<br>
placed in a U-shape inside the edge groove 10 all<br>
around the spacing frame 4, its two ends 11.1 and 11.2<br>
are fed upward out of the lateral edge grooves 10 and<br>
may be attached to another construction element not<br>
shown.<br>
In the embodiment represented in Fig. 6, the safety<br>
element 11 in the form of a cable runs all the way<br>
round the spacing frame 4, the two ends 11.1 and 11.2<br>
of the safety element of course being fed out of the<br>
same edge groove 10, but on opposite sides. In this top<br>
edge groove, the safety element is therefore laid<br>
doubly, respectively with two lengths.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a variant in which, in addition to the<br>
safety element 11, a second identical safety element<br>
110 is laid in a U-shape, as represented in Fig. 5,<br>
around the spacing frame. The openings of the U-shaped<br>
loops are, in this instance, oriented in opposite<br>
directions, so that the ends 11.1 and 110.1,<br>
respectively 11.2 and 110.2, are fed out of the same<br>
edge groove, but in opposite directions. In this<br><br>
embodiment, the window pane 1 may be attached at four<br>
points to an outside construction element.<br>
Fig. 8 represents an aluminum corner bracket 15, to<br>
which a flexible safety element 16 is attached in a<br>
loop. The safety element 16 may for example be a steel<br>
cable, which is brazed onto the corner bracket 15. The<br>
corner bracket 15 has channel portions 15.1 and 15.2<br>
which have substantially the same cross section as the<br>
channel 4, and junction tabs 17.1 and 17.2. The latter<br>
are dimensioned so that they can be inserted in a tight<br>
fit into the hollow space 6 of the channel 4 . In this<br>
manner, it is for example possible to form a closed<br>
frame with four channels 4 and four corner brackets 15.<br>
The safety element 16 is in this case also fed out of<br>
the edge groove 10 of the window pane. As an<br>
illustration, a portion of the periphery of the pane 3<br>
has been drawn as broken lines.<br><br>
