				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The invention relates generally to electric utility storm outage management,<br>
and more particularly to efficient storm outage management of electric utility maintenance<br>
resources and other resources based on predictive and other modeling.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Energy companies provide power to consumers via power generation units.<br>
A power generation unit may be a coal-fired power plant, a hydro-electric power plant, a<br>
gas turbine and a generator, a diesel engine and a generator, a nuclear power plant, and the<br>
like. The power is transmitted to consumers via a transmission and distribution system that<br>
may include power lines, power transformers, protective switches, sectionalizing switches,<br>
other switches, breakers, reclosers, and the like. The transmission and distribution system<br>
forms at least one, and possibly more, electrical paths between the generation units and<br>
power consumers (e.g., homes, businesses, offices, street lights, and the like).<br>
[0003] Severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, ice storms, lightning storms,<br>
and the like can cause disruptions of power flow to consumers (i.e., power outages). For<br>
example, high winds or ice can knock trees into overhead power lines, lightning can damage<br>
transformers, switches, power lines, and so forth. While some power outages may be of<br>
short-term duration (e.g., a few seconds), many power outages require physical repair or<br>
maintenance to the transmission and distribution system before the power can be restored.<br>
For example, if a tree knocks down a home's power line, a maintenance crew may have to<br>
repair the downed power line before power can be restored to the home. In the meantime,<br>
consumers are left without power, which is at least inconvenient but could be serious in<br>
extreme weather conditions (e.g., freezing cold weather conditions). In many<br>
circumstances, therefore, it is very important to restore power quickly.<br>
[0004] Large storms often cause multiple power outages in various portions of the<br>
transmission and distribution system. In response, electric utilities typically send<br>
maintenance crews into the field to perform the repairs. If the storm is large enough,<br>
maintenance crews are often borrowed from neighboring electric utilities and from external<br>
contracting agencies. Dispatching the crews in an efficient manner, therefore, is important<br>
to the quick and efficient restoration of power.<br>
[0005] Conventional techniques for maintenance crew dispatch include<br>
dispatching the crews straight from a central operation center. Once the storm hits, the<br>
electric utility then determines where to send the crews based on telephone calls from<br>
consumers. Conventional outage management systems log customer calls and dispatch<br>
crews to the site of the disturbance based on the customer calls. The engines of<br>
conventional outage management systems typically assume that calls from customers that<br>
are near each other are associated with a single disturbance or power outage. These<br>
conventional outage management systems do not function well under severe weather<br>
scenarios for various reasons.<br>
[0006] Additionally, conventional outage management systems provide an<br>
estimated time to restore a particular section of a power circuit based on historical crew<br>
response times only. For example, a suburban customer may be given an estimated time to<br>
restore of 2 hours while a rural customer may be given an estimated time to restore of 4<br>
hours. These times are typically based on the historical times for crew to be dispatched and<br>
repair an outage. These conventional systems fail to provide accurate estimates for large<br>
storms. That is, conventional systems assume that a crew will be dispatched to the outage<br>
in a short period of time. With large storms, however, there may be a significant time delay<br>
before a crew is sent to a particular outage location (as there are typically multiple outages<br>
occurring at the same time).<br>
[0007] Thus, there is a need for systems, methods, and the like, to facilitate<br>
efficiently dispatching maintenance crews in severe weather situations and for providing an<br>
estimated time to restore power to a particular customer that works well for large storms.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0030] The electric utility storm outage management systems and methods are<br>
directed to the management of resources during a storm outage of a power circuit (e.g., an<br>
electric utility transmission and distribution system). The systems and methods use<br>
information prior to the occurrence of a storm to predict damage-related information that<br>
can be used to efficiently manage the electric utility resources. The systems and methods<br>
may be used by an electric utility to predict damages to the power circuit, maintenance crew<br>
person-days to repair the damages, consumer outages from the damage, an estimated time to<br>
restore the power circuit, predicted estimated time to restore power to a particular customer,<br>
an estimated cost to restore the power circuit, and the like. The systems and methods may<br>
also be used to track actual damages to the power circuit, actual maintenance crew person-<br>
days to repair the damages, actual consumer outages from the damage, actual time to restore<br>
the power circuit, actual time to restore power to a particular customer, actual cost to restore<br>
the power circuit, and the like. Further, the systems and methods may be modified based on<br>
historical predicted and actual information. The systems and methods may also track power<br>
circuit observations and power circuit restorations. The systems and methods may assist an<br>
electric utility to improve the management of its resources during storm outages. Such<br>
improved management may assist the utility to restore power more efficiently and quicker.<br>
The systems and methods may be implemented in one or more of the exemplary computing<br>
environments described in more detail below, or in other computing environments.<br>
[0031] Figure 1 shows computing system 20 that includes computer 20a.<br>
Computer 20a includes display device 20a' and interface and processing unit 20a".<br>
Computer 20a executes computing application 80. As shown, computing application 80<br>
includes a computing application processing and storage area 82 and a computing<br>
application display 81. Computing application processing and storage area 82 includes<br>
computing engine 85. Computing engine 85 may implement systems and methods for<br>
electric utility storm outage management. Computing application display 81 may include<br>
display content which may be used for electric utility storm outage management. In<br>
operation, a user (not shown) may interface with computing application 80 through<br>
computer 20a. The user may navigate through computing application 80 to input, display,<br>
and generate data and information for electric utility storm outage management.<br>
[0032] Computing application 80 may generate predicted maintenance parameters,<br>
such as, for example, predicted damages to a power circuit, predicted maintenance crew<br>
person-days to repair the damages, predicted consumer outages from the damage, predicted<br>
estimated time to restore the power circuit, predicted estimated time to restore power to a<br>
particular customer, predicted estimated cost to restore the power circuit, and the like.<br>
Computing application 80 may also track actual maintenance parameters, such as, for<br>
example, actual damages to the power circuit, actual maintenance crew person-days to<br>
repair the damages, actual consumer outages from the damage, actual time to restore the<br>
power circuit, actual time to restore power to a particular customer, actual cost to restore the<br>
power circuit, and the like. The predicted information and actual information may be<br>
displayed to the user as display content via computing application display 81.<br>
[0033] Computer 20a, described above, can be deployed as part of a computer<br>
network. In general, the above description for computers may apply to both server<br>
computers and client computers deployed in a network environment. Figure 2 illustrates an<br>
exemplary network environment having server computers in communication with client<br>
computers, in which systems and methods for electric utility storm outage management may<br>
be implemented. As shown in Figure 2, a number of server computers 10a, 10b, etc., are<br>
interconnected via a communications network 50 with a number of client computers 20a,<br>
20b, 20c, etc., or other computing devices, such as, a mobile phone 15, and a personal<br>
digital assistant 17. Communication network 50 may be a wireless network, a fixed-wire<br>
network, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), an intranet, an extranet,<br>
the Internet, or the like. In a network environment in which the communications network<br>
50 is the Internet, for example, server computers 10 can be Web servers with which client<br>
computers 20 communicate via any of a number of known communication protocols, such<br>
as, hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), wireless application protocol (WAP), and the like.<br>
Each client computer 20 can be equipped with a browser 30 to communicate with server<br>
computers 10. Similarly, personal digital assistant 17 can be equipped with a browser 31<br>
and mobile phone 15 can be equipped with a browser 32 to display and communicate<br>
various data.<br>
[0034] In operation, the user may interact with computing application 80 to<br>
generate and display predicted and actual information, as described above. The predicted<br>
and actual information may be stored on server computers 10, client computers 20, or other<br>
client computing devices. The predicted and actual information may be communicated to<br>
users via client computing devices or client computers 20.<br>
[0035] Thus, the systems and methods for electric utility storm outage<br>
management can be implemented and used in a computer network environment having<br>
client computing devices for accessing and interacting with the network and a server<br>
computer for interacting with client computers. The systems and methods can be<br>
implemented with a variety of network-based architectures, and thus should not be limited<br>
to the examples shown.<br>
[0036] Figure 3 shows an illustrative embodiment of computing engine 85. As<br>
shown in Figure 3, computing engine 85 includes storm outage engine 110, damage<br>
prediction engine 120, and maintenance crew prediction engine 130. While computing<br>
engine 85 is shown as being implemented in three separate engines, computing engine 85<br>
may be implemented as one engine or any number of engines. Further, the various<br>
functionalities of the engines 110, 120, and 130 may be distributed among various engines<br>
in any convenient fashion.<br>
[0037] Damage prediction engine 120 receives a weather prediction from a<br>
weather prediction service 200. The weather prediction may include predicted wind speed<br>
and duration, a predicted storm duration, a predicted snowfall amount, a predicted icing<br>
amount, and a predicted rainfall amount, a predicted storm type (e.g., hurricane, wind, ice,<br>
tornado, lighting, etc.), a predicted lightning location and intensity, and the like. The<br>
weather prediction may be embodied in or may accompany a Geographic Information<br>
System (GIS) file, or the like. Weather prediction service 200 may include a national<br>
weather service bureau, a commercial weather service organization, an automated weather<br>
prediction service, or the like.<br>
[0038] Damage prediction engine 120 determines a predicted amount of damage to<br>
the power circuit based on the weather prediction from weather prediction service 200.<br>
Damage prediction engine 120 may determine a predicted per-unit amount of damage. For<br>
example, a predicted number of broken power poles per mile, a predicted number of<br>
downed power lines per mile, and a predicted number of damaged power transformers per<br>
mile, and the like. If damage prediction engine 120 determines a per-unit predicted amount<br>
of damage, then another engine (e.g., storm outage engine 110) may use that per-unit<br>
predicted amount of data and determines a predicted total amount of damage for the power<br>
circuit based on the power circuit interconnection model. The other engine (e.g., storm<br>
outage engine 110) may also determine the predicted total amount of damage based on<br>
weather-susceptibility information, and the like. Alternatively, damage prediction engine<br>
120 may determine a total predicted amount of damage to the power circuit based on the<br>
weather prediction and the model of the interconnections of the power circuit, and the<br>
weather-susceptibility information of the power circuit components. The predicted amount<br>
of damage may be stored to historical data store 290. Historical data store 290 may also<br>
contain any of the data and information processed by computing engine 85, such as, for<br>
example, historical predicted maintenance parameters, historical weather predictions,<br>
historical power circuit observations, historical weather susceptibility information, historical<br>
interconnection models, historical user input and output information, historical predicted<br>
and actual crew costs, historical restoration times, and the like.<br>
[0039] Tn one embodiment, damage prediction engine 120 receives the weather<br>
prediction from weather prediction service 200, which may be in the format of GIS files.<br>
Damage prediction engine 120 may convert the weather prediction to an indication of<br>
predicted intensity, such as, for example, a number using a simple scaling system. For<br>
example, the intensity of the storm may be rated on a scale from 1 to 3, from 1 to 10, and<br>
the like. Alternatively, various aspects of the weather, such as, for example, predicted wind<br>
speed, predicted rainfall amount, and the like may be rated on such a scale. Alternatively,<br>
more complex systems may be used to convert the weather prediction to an indication of<br>
predicted intensity. For example, conversions between wind speed and predicted intensity<br>
may be done on a smaller geographic basis (e.g., an intensity indication per feeder rather<br>
than an intensity indication per power circuit). Conversions may be linear, exponential,<br>
logarithmic, and the like. Additionally, a user may input, and damage prediction engine 120<br>
may receive a predicted intensity. In this manner, a user may perform "what-if" analyses<br>
for various types of storms. For example, a user may enter a predicted storm intensity of '3'<br>
into a system and computing application 85 may determine predicted damages and<br>
predicted maintenance parameters (e.g., predicted number of customers, predicted time to<br>
restore each customer, etc.) based on the user-entered storm intensity.<br>
[0040] The interconnection model of the power circuit may be stored in<br>
interconnection model data store 210. Interconnection model data store 210 may reside on<br>
computer 20a, for example, or on another computing device accessible to computing engine<br>
85. For example, interconnection model data store 210 may reside on server 10a and<br>
typically may reside on another server if the interconnection model is an existing<br>
interconnection model. The interconnection model may include information about the<br>
components of the power circuit, such as, for example, the location of power lines, the<br>
location of power poles, the location of power transformers and sectionalizing switches and<br>
protective devices, the type of sectionalizing switches, the location of power consumers, the<br>
interconnectivity of the power circuit components, the connectivity of the power circuit to<br>
consumers, the layout of the power circuit, and the like.<br>
[0041] In one embodiment, the interconnectivity of the power circuit components<br>
may be modeled by a file using node numbers. An illustrative interconnectivity file is given<br>
below which models the power circuit of Figure 7. (Figure 7 shows an exemplary power<br>
circuit 790 having power circuit elements 700-713 interconnected via nodes 1-9.)<br>

[0043] As shown, the interconnectivity file includes a file fine that represents a<br>

a source type (e.g., 'SOURCE'), a second field representing the node associated with the<br>
source (e.g., 'sub'), a third field representing the phasing of the source (e.g., '7' for three<br>
phase), and a fourth field representing the type of the source or equipment identification<br>
(e.g., 'substation' for a substation). The power-line file line contains seven fields: a first<br>
field representing that the component is a line type (e.g., 'LINE'), a second field<br>
representing the node number at a first end of the power-line (e.g., 'one' for node 1), a third<br>
field representing the node number at the other end of the power-line (e.g., 'sub' for node<br>
substation), a fourth field representing the phasing of the source (e.g., '7' for three phase), a<br>
fifth field representing the type of the source or equipment identification (e.g., 'primary_r<br>
for a primary power-line), a sixth field representing the length of the power-line (e.g.,<br>
'10000' for 10,000 feet), and a seventh field representing the type of protection device for<br>
the power-line (e.g., 'breaker' for a breaker). While the interconnectivity file shown<br>
includes a particular arrangement of data, other files arrangements may be used and other<br>
ways of modeling the power circuit may be used, such as, for example, computer-aided<br>
design (CAD) models and the like.<br>
[0044] The interconnectivity file may also include information about the number<br>
of customers at each load or a separate file may include such information, as shown below.<br>

ten,400,100,xfmr_1<br>
[0046] As shown, the customer location file includes a line for each load (which<br>
may include multiple customers). The line contains four fields: a first field representing the<br>
node number of the load (e.g., 'one' for node 1), a second field representing the power<br>
rating of the transformer feeding the load (e.g., '2000' for a 2000 kVA transformer), a third<br>
field representing the number of customers fed by that transformer, and a fourth field<br>
representing the transformer type (e.g., 'xfmr_1' for a particular transformer type). While<br>
the file shown includes a particular arrangement of data, other files arrangements may be<br>
used and other ways of modeling the power circuit may be used, such as, for example, CAD<br>
models and the like.<br>
[0047] Weather susceptibility information may be stored in weather susceptibility<br>
infonnation data store 220. Weather susceptibility information data store 220 may reside on<br>
computer 20a, for example, or on another computing device accessible to computing engine<br>
85. For example, weather susceptibility information data store 220 may reside on server<br>
10a or any client or server computer. Weather susceptibility information includes<br>
infonnation about the weather susceptibiUty of components of the power circuit, such as, for<br>
example, power line pole age, power line component ice susceptibility, power line<br>
component wind susceptibiUty, tree density by location, and the like.<br>
[0048] The indication of predicted intensity may be used to determine a<br>
corresponding weather susceptibility, thereby providing different equipment weather<br>
susceptibilities for different intensity storms, such as shown in the illustrative equipment<br>
weather susceptibiUty file below.<br>

[0050] As shown, the equipment weather susceptibility file includes file lines that<br>
represent various types of devices or components of the power circuit. For a feeder, the line<br>
contains multiple fields: a first field representing the device or component identification<br>
(e.g., 'primary_1' for a component type that is a type of primary feeder), a second field<br>
representing the ampacity of the feeder (e.g., '400' for an ampacity of 400), a third field<br>
representing the number of storm damage points or the number of ranges in a weather<br>
intensity scale (e.g., '3' for a weather intensity scale that is divided into three ranges, such<br>
as, low intensity, medium intensity, and high intensity), and a pair of fields for each range in<br>
the weather intensity scale, the first field of the pair representing a predicted number of<br>
power-line spans down per mile, the second field of the pair representing a predicted<br>
number of trees down per mile (e.g., for a storm predicted to have low intensity a prediction<br>
of '2' spans down per mile and a prediction of '5' trees down per mile). For a transformer,<br>
the line contains multiple fields: a first field representing the feeder identification (e.g.,<br>
'xfmr_1' for a particular type of transformer), a second field representing the ampacity of<br>
the transformer (e.g., '200' for an ampacity of 200), a third field representing the number of<br>
storm damage points or the number of ranges in a weather intensity scale (e.g., '3' for a<br>
weather intensity scale that is divided into three ranges, such as, low intensity, medium<br>
intensity, and high intensity), and a fourth field representing a probability of transformer<br>
failure (e.g., '0.1' for a 0.1 percent chance of transformer failure). Sectionalizing switch and<br>
substation information may also be contained in the equipment weather susceptibility file,<br>
such as, probability of failure and the like. The information may also include ampacity<br>
information for use in determining whether customers can be fed from an alternative feeder<br>
and the like. While the equipment weather susceptibility file shown includes a particular<br>
arrangement of data, other files arrangements may be used and other ways of modeling the<br>
susceptibility may be used.<br>
[0051] Damage prediction engine 120 may interface with storm outage engine 110<br>
as shown to communicate with interconnection model data store 210 and weather<br>
susceptibility information data store 220. Also, damage prediction engine 120 may<br>
communicate directly (or via network 50) with interconnection model data store 210 and<br>
weather susceptibility information data store 220.<br>
[0052] Maintenance crew prediction engine 130 receives the damage prediction<br>
(or an indication of the types of damages predicted) that was determined by damage<br>
prediction engine 120 (or storm outage engine 110) and determines a predicted maintenance<br>
crew requirement. The predicted maintenance crew requirement may be a predicted per-<br>
damage type maintenance crew requirement, may be a predicted total maintenance crew<br>
requirement for all the predicted damage, or the like. For example, maintenance crew<br>
prediction engine 130 may determine a predicted crew type and a predicted crew person-day<br>
requirement to repair each type of damage predicted (e.g., a prediction that it takes a line<br>
crew one day to repair twelve spans of downed line). Also, maintenance crew prediction<br>
engine 130 may determine a predicted crew type and a predicted crew person-day<br>
requirement to repair all of the predicted damage (e.g., a prediction that ten line crews and<br>
two tree crews will be required to handle the storm outage maintenance). If maintenance<br>
crew prediction engine 130 determines predicted per-damage type maintenance crew<br>
requirements, another engine (e.g., storm outage engine 110) converts the per-damage type<br>
maintenance crew requirements to total maintenance requirements based on the predicted<br>
damage to the power circuit. The predicted maintenance crew requirement may be stored to<br>
historical data store 290.<br>
[0053] Maintenance crew prediction engine may include or access a maintenance<br>
crew productivity file as shown below.<br>
[0054] CREW PRODUCTIVITY FILE<br>

four_man_crew,7,10,6,5000<br>
[0055] As shown, the maintenance crew productivity file includes a file line for<br>
each type of crew. The line contains five fields: a first field representing the type of crew<br>
(e.g., 'tree_crew' for a tree maintenance crew), a second field representing the number of<br>
trees per day the crew can maintain (e.g., '25' trees per day), a third field representing the<br>
number of spans per day the crew can repair (e.g.,' 10' spans per day), a fourth field<br>
representing the number of transformers per day the crew can repair (e.g., '4' transformers<br>
per day), and a fifth field representing the cost per day of the crew (e.g., '2000' for $2000<br>
per day). While the file shown includes a particular arrangement of data, other files<br>
arrangements may be used and other ways of modeling the maintenance crew productivity<br>
may be used.<br>
[0056] Storm outage engine 110 determines a predicted maintenance parameter,<br>
such as, for example, a predicted amount of damage to the power circuit, a predicted<br>
maintenance crew person-days to repair the damages, a predicted consumer outages from<br>
the damage, a predicted estimated time to restore the power circuit, a predicted estimated<br>
cost to restore the power circuit, and the like based on the predicted maintenance crew<br>
requirement and the predicted amount and location of damage to the power circuit. In this<br>
manner, maintenance crews may be sent to a staging location near the location of predicted<br>
damage. The predicted maintenance parameters may also be stored to historical data store<br>
290.<br>
[0057] Storm outage engine 110 may determine the maintenance parameter<br>
predictions on a per feeder basis and then sum the predicted damage for each feeder.<br>
Predicted time to restore the power circuit may be based on assumptions (or rules) that the<br>
primary feeder will be repaired first, that feeder reconfiguration will or will not be<br>
employed, that medium size feeders will be repaired next, and that feeders to a small<br>
number of homes will be repaired last, which loads have priority (e.g., hospitals), or other<br>
rules. These rules and assumptions may be applied to the interconnection model and the<br>
predicted damage, actual damage, or some combination thereof to determine a restoration<br>
sequence. In this manner, storm outage engine 110 may determine an estimated time to<br>
restore power to each power consumer. Storm outage engine 110 may also update the<br>
estimate time to restore power to each power consumer based on power circuit observations,<br>
such as, for example, observations of actual damage, observations of repairs, and the like.<br>
[0058] Storm outage engine 110 may also use other information to determine the<br>
predicted maintenance parameter. For example, storm outage engine 110 may use<br>
maintenance crew availability, maintenance crew cost, maintenance crew scheduling<br>
constraints, and the like to determine the predicted maintenance parameter. Maintenance<br>
crew cost and scheduling constraints may be located in crew prediction engine 130,<br>
historical data store 290, a business management system database such as an SAP database,<br>
or any other database, data table, or the like. Maintenance crew cost information may<br>
include both internal and external (contractor) crew information. Information (e.g.,<br>
maintenance crew availability, maintenance crew cost, maintenance crew scheduling<br>
constraints) may also be received as input information 260, which may be stored on<br>
computer 20a, may be received as user input into computer 20a, may be received via<br>
network 50, or the like. In this manner, a user may input various crew costs and various<br>
crew numbers to perform "what-if" analysis on various crew deployments. The user may<br>
also input a number of outage days desired and storm outage engine 110 may output a<br>
predicted number of crews and a predicted cost to meet the desired number of outage days.<br>
[0059] Alternate inputs to storm outage engine 110 may be in form of predicted<br>
line crew days and tree crew days (instead of predicted number of spans down and trees<br>
down), and the like, for use by storm outage engine 110 in predicting maintenance<br>
parameters.<br>
[0060] Storm outage engine 110 may also track actual maintenance parameters,<br>
such as, for example, actual damages to the power circuit, actual maintenance crew person-<br>
days to repair the damages, actual consumer outages from the damage, actual time to restore<br>
the power circuit, actual time to restore power to a particular customer, actual cost to restore<br>
the power circuit, and the like. The actual damages to the power circuit, actual maintenance<br>
crew person-days to repair the damages, actual consumer outages from the damage, actual<br>
time to restore the power circuit, actual time to restore power to a particular customer,<br>
actual cost to restore the power circuit information, and the like may also be stored to<br>
historical data store 290.<br>
[0061] Once the storm hits, storm outage engine 110 may use additional data to<br>
make a revised prediction regarding the maintenance parameters. For example, storm<br>
outage engine 110 may receive power circuit observations 230, such as, customer call<br>
information, update information from maintenance crews, information from data acquisition<br>
systems, information about power circuit recloser trips, information from damage<br>
assessment crews, and the like. Storm outage engine 110 may use the power circuit<br>
observations 230 to make a revised prediction upon receipt of the power circuit observations<br>
230, upon some periodic interval, some combination thereof, or the like. For example, if<br>
the damage assessments average 10 trees down per mile of power-line and the weather<br>
susceptibility indicated a predicted average of 5 trees down per mile, storm outage engine<br>
may calculate revised predicted total number of trees down using 10 trees down per mile of<br>
power-line. Storm outage engine 110 may also use, for example, power circuit observations<br>
to determine an accumulated cost of the storm outage to date. Also, storm outage engine<br>
110 may use actual power circuit observations of actual damage to determine an estimated<br>
time to restore power to a particular customer. Storm outage engine 110 may also<br>
determine other predicted maintenance parameters based on user input and power circuit<br>
observations of actual damage.<br>
[0062] The predicted maintenance parameters may be output as output information<br>
270 and displayed on computing application display 81. For example, the predicted amount<br>
of damage to the power circuit may be displayed in graphical form, such as a graphical<br>
representation of the power circuit having a particular indication associated with portions of<br>
the power circuit being predicted to be damaged. For example, all portions of the power<br>
circuit downstream from a transformer that is predicted to be damaged may be highlighted<br>
in yellow, marked with and "x," or the like.<br>
[0063] Typically, the display is arranged to correspond the physical geometry of<br>
the power circuit. Figure 7 shows an illustrative power circuit 790. Power circuit 790<br>
includes power circuit elements such as substations 700 and 712, breakers 701 and 713,<br>
loads 702, 704, 708, and 710, fuses 703 and 707, recloser 705, and sectionalizing switches<br>
709 and 711 interconnected as shown. Figure 8 shows an illustrative display 890<br>
representing power circuit 790. As shown, Figure 8 includes display elements 800-813 that<br>
correspond to power circuit elements 700-713. Display 890 may represent the predicted<br>
outage configuration of the power circuit. For example, the power-line to loads 704 and<br>
708 may be illustrated with a hash marked line (or color or the like) to indicate a prediction<br>
that those loads are likely to lose power. The power-line to between recloser 705 and<br>
substation 800 may be illustrated with a bold line (or color or the like) to indicate a<br>
prediction that those loads are not likely to lose power.<br>
[0064] Storm outage engine 110 may also output a report of the predicted<br>
maintenance parameters. For example, a report may include the following information:<br>
Xfinnnine No. Cust: 200 ETR: 3.91<br>
Xfmnten No. Cust: 100 ETR: 3.91<br>
[0065] As can be seen, all of the damage in this report is predicted and none of the<br>
damage has been either verified or repaired. The estimated time to restore (ETR) the entire<br>
system is 3.91 days. Also, each load transformer has its own estimated time to restoration<br>
determined and displayed. For example, the estimated time to restore the load (100<br>
customers) of transformer one is 0.95 days while the estimated time to restore the load<br>
(another 100 customers) of transformer ten is 3.91 days.<br>
[0066] In addition to determining predicted maintenance parameters, storm outage<br>
engine 110 may track actual maintenance parameters. For example, actual damage may be<br>
tracked in a damage assessment report file, as shown below.<br>
[0067] DAMAGE ASSESSMENT REPORT FILE<br>
%line type id, component id, upstream component id, number spans down, number trees<br>
down<br>
LINE,one,sub,9,17<br>
LINE,ten,nine, 12,20<br>
[0068] As shown, the damage assessment report file includes a file line for each<br>
damage assessment. The file line contains five fields: a first field representing the<br>
component type (e.g., 'LINE' for power-line), a second field representing the node at the<br>
load side of the component (e.g., 'one' for node one), a third field representing the node at<br>
the source side of the component (e.g., 'sub' for node sub), a fourth field representing the<br>
number of spans down on the line (e.g., '9' spans down), and a fifth field representing the<br>
number of trees down on the line (e.g., '17' trees down). While the file shown includes a<br>
particular arrangement of data, other files arrangements may be used and other ways of<br>
modeling the damage assessments may be used. Storm outage engine 110 may generate<br>
reports for such damage assessments.<br>
[0069] Actual restoration of power to customers may be tracked by storm outage<br>
engine 110 and included in a repair restoration progress report file, as shown below.<br>
[0070] REPAIR RESTORATION PROGRESS REPORT FILE<br>
%line type id, component id, upstream component id, number spans fixed, number trees<br>
fixed, service reenergized<br>
LINE,one,sub,9,17,0<br>
LINE,two,one,8,16,0<br>
LINE,one,Sub,0,0,1<br>
[0071] As shown, the repair restoration progress report file includes a line for each<br>
power-line component repaired. The line contains six fields: a first field representing the<br>
component type (e.g., 'LINE' for power-line), a second field representing the component<br>
(e.g., '1' for line number 1), a third field representing the upstream power circuit component<br>
(e.g., 'sub' for a substation), a fourth field representing the number of spans repaired on the<br>
line (e.g., '9' spans repaired), a fifth field representing the number of trees maintained on<br>
the line (e.g., '17' trees maintained), and a sixth field represent whether the switch or<br>
breaker associated with that component has been closed (e.g., '0' for switch open and '1'<br>
for switch closed). While the file shown includes a particular arrangement of data, other<br>
files arrangements may be used and other ways of modeling the repair restoration progress<br>
may be used.<br>
[0072] Using these files, storm outage engine 110 may recalculate predicted<br>
maintenance parameters based on actual maintenance parameters determined, as described<br>
in more detail above. Storm outage engine 110 can then generate additional reports based<br>
on the actual maintenance parameters and the recalculated predicted maintenance<br>
parameters. An illustrative additional report is shown below.<br><br><br>
[0073] As can be'seen in this illustrative report, 24% of the system has been<br>
assessed, therefore, some of the damage is verified and some of the damage remains<br>
predicted. The verified damage may be illustrated on a display such as shown in Figure 9.<br>
Figure 9 shows an illustrative display 990 representing power circuit 790. As shown,<br>
Figure 9 includes display elements 900-913 that correspond to power circuit elements 900-<br>
913. Display 990 may represent the predicted outage configuration of the power circuit.<br>
For example, loads 704 and 708 may be illustrated with a hash marked line (or color or the<br>
like) to indicate that they have been assessed and power loss has been verified. Computing<br>
application display 81 may be revised based on the actual maintenance parameters received<br>
by storm outage engine 110. For example, once a customer call is received corresponding<br>
to a portion of the power circuit that is predicted to be damaged, the graphical<br>
representation of that portion of the power circuit may be displayed having a different<br>
indication. For example, portions of the power circuit which have confirmed damage may<br>
be highlighted in red, marked with and "-----" pattern, or the like. Also, once confirmation<br>
is received that a portion of the circuit has been restored to normal operation, that portion<br>
may be displayed normally, or with another different indication. For example, a restored<br>
'WO 2005/043347<br>
portion of the power circuit may be highlighted in blue, marked with a double-line, or the<br>
like.<br>
[0074] Storm outage engine 110 may also determine predicted maintenance<br>
parameters based on the actual maintenance parameters and maintenance restoration<br>
information. Storm outage engine 110 can then generate additional reports based on the<br>
actual maintenance parameters and maintenance restoration information. An illustrative<br>
additional report is shown below.<br>
As can be seen, 100% of the system has been assessed and 94% the damage remains to be<br>
restored. Note that an ETR of zero may refer to a customer whose power has been restored.<br>
[0075] Storm outage engine 110 may continue to update the predicted<br>
maintenance parameters based on the actual maintenance parameters and maintenance<br>
restoration information. Storm outage engine 110 can then generate additional reports, as<br>
shown below.<br>
As can be seen, 100% of the system has been assessed and 75% the damage remains to be<br>
restored. Storm outage engine 110 may also receive user input representing adjustments to<br>
the number of crews and output predicted maintenance parameters based on the adjusted<br>
number of crews. Storm outage engine 110 may determine adjusted predicted maintenance<br>
parameters based on the user input.<br>
[0076] Storm outage engine 110 may continue to update the predicted<br>
maintenance parameters based on the actual maintenance parameters and maintenance<br>
restoration information until all customers have their power restored. Storm outage engine<br>
110 can continue to receive power circuit observations, including power circuit restoration<br>
information, and then generate another report, as shown below.<br>
As can be seen, 100% of the system has been assessed and 100% the damage has been<br>
repaired and restored. Storm outage engine 110 may output actual maintenance parameters,<br>
such as, for example, a total cost, and the like.<br>
[0077] Further, storm outage engine 110 (or damage prediction engine 120 or<br>
maintenance crew prediction engine 130) may use the predicted and actual information in<br>
historical data store 290 to revise the rules of computing engine 85, refine weather<br>
susceptibility information, refine multipliers used to determine predicted maintenance<br>
parameters, and the like. Such revision may be done automatically, may be done at periodic<br>
intervals, may request user authorization to effect each revision, and the like.<br>
[0078] Figures 4 and 5 show flow charts of an illustrative method for electric<br>
utility storm outage management. While the following description includes references to<br>
the system of Figure 3, the method may be implemented in a variety of ways, such as, for<br>
example, by a single computing engine, by multiple computing engines, via a standalone<br>
computing system, via a networked computing system, and the like.<br>
[0079] As shown in Figure 4, at step 300, damage prediction engine 120<br>
determines a weather prediction by receiving a weather prediction from a weather<br>
prediction service 200. The weather prediction may include predicted wind speed, a<br>
predicted storm duration, a predicted snowfall amount, a predicted icing amount, a predicted<br>
rainfall amount, a GIS file, and the like.<br>
[0080] At step 310, storm outage engine 110 determines an interconnection model<br>
of the power circuit from interconnection model data store 210. The interconnection model<br>
may include information about the components of the power circuit, such as, for example,<br>
the location of power lines, the location of power poles, the location of power transformers<br>
and sectionalizing switches and protective devices, the type of sectionalizing switches, the<br>
location of power consumers, the interconnectivity of the power circuit components, the<br>
connectivity of the power circuit to consumers, the layout of the power circuit, and the like.<br>
[0081] At step 320, storm outage engine 110 determines weather susceptibility<br>
information from weather susceptibility information data store 220. Weather susceptibility<br>
information may include information about the weather susceptibility of components of the<br>
power circuit, such as, for example, power line pole age, power line component ice<br>
susceptibility, power line component wind susceptibility, and the like.<br>
[0082] At step 330a, damage prediction engine 120 determines a predicted per-unit<br>
amount of damage to the power circuit based on the weather prediction from weather<br>
prediction service 200. Damage prediction engine 120 may determine, for example, a<br>
predicted number of broken power poles per mile, a predicted number of downed power<br>
lines per mile, and a predicted number of damaged power transformers per mile, and the<br>
like. Alternatively, damage prediction engine 120 may determine the predicted total<br>
amount of damage to the power circuit based on the model of the interconnections of the<br>
power circuit, the weather prediction, weather-susceptibility information of the power<br>
circuit components, and the like (and possibly obviating step 330b).<br>
[0083] At step 330b, storm outage engine 110 determines a total predicted amount<br>
of power circuit damage based on the predicted per-unit amount of damage from damage<br>
prediction engine 120, based on the interconnection model of the power circuit, and based<br>
on the weather susceptibility information of the power circuit components. The predicted<br>
total amount of damage may be location specific, may be a total number of components, or<br>
some combination thereof.<br>
[0084] At step 330c, maintenance crew prediction engine 130 may receive the<br>
damage prediction or an indication of the types of damages predicted that was determined at<br>
steps 330a and 330b and determines a predicted maintenance crew requirement for each<br>
type of predicted damage. Alternatively, maintenance crew prediction engine 130 may<br>
determine a predicted total maintenance crew requirement for the storm outage based on the<br>
total predicted damages.<br>
[0085] At step 330d, storm outage engine 110 determines a predicted maintenance<br>
parameter, such as, for example, a predicted amount of damage to the power circuit, a<br>
predicted maintenance crew person-days to repair the damages, a predicted consumer<br>
outages from the damage, a predicted estimated time to restore the power circuit, a<br>
predicted estimated cost to restore the power circuit, and the like based on the predicted<br>
maintenance crew requirement and the predicted amount of damage to the power circuit.<br>
Storm outage engine 110 may determine such maintenance parameter predictions based also<br>
on maintenance crew availability, maintenance crew cost, maintenance crew scheduling<br>
constraints, and the like.<br>
[0086] At step 340, storm outage engine 110 may also determine and track actual<br>
maintenance parameters, such as, for example, actual damages to the power circuit, actual<br>
maintenance crew person-days to repair the damages, actual consumer outages from the<br>
damage, actual time to restore the power circuit, actual cost to restore the power circuit, and<br>
the like. For example, storm outage engine 110 may receive power circuit observations<br>
230, such as, customer call information, update information from maintenance crews,<br>
information from data acquisition systems, information about power circuit recloser trips,<br>
information from damage assessment crews, and the like.<br>
[0087] At this point, steps 320 and 330 may be re-executed and the predicted<br>
maintenance parameter may be determined based also on the actual maintenance parameter<br>
determined at step 340. Also, step 320 may use revised weather susceptibility information<br>
based on actual damage assessments, and the like. For example, if an original weather<br>
susceptibility data point predicted five downed trees per mile, but damage assessment data<br>
showed an actual average often downed trees per mile, storm outage engine 110 or damage<br>
prediction engine 120 may use the actual average value often trees per mile in determining<br>
a predicted amount of power circuit damage in the areas of the power circuit which have not<br>
yet had an assessment completed.<br>
[0088] At step 350, storm outage engine 110 may store the predicted and actual<br>
damages of the power circuit, the predicted and actual maintenance crew person-days to<br>
repair the damages, the predicted and actual consumer outages from the damage, the<br>
predicted and actual time to restore the power circuit, the predicted and actual cost to restore<br>
the power circuit information, and the like to historical data store 290.<br>
[0089] At step 360, storm outage engine 110 may display the predicted<br>
maintenance parameters on computing application display 81. For example, the predicted<br>
amount of damage to the power circuit may be displayed in graphical form, such as a<br>
graphical representation of the power circuit having a particular indication associated with<br>
portions of the power circuit being predicted to be damaged. Storm outage engine 110 may<br>
also display the actual maintenance parameters determined at step 340. For example, once a<br>
customer call is received corresponding to a portion of the power circuit that is predicted to<br>
be damaged, the graphical representation of that portion of the power circuit may be<br>
displayed having a different indication. Also, once confirmation is received that a portion<br>
of the circuit has been restored to normal operation, that portion may be displayed normally,<br>
or with another different indication. Further, storm outage engine 110 may continually<br>
display the predicted maintenance parameters on computing application display 81 and<br>
continually update the display based on new information being received by storm outage<br>
engine 110.<br>
[0090] At step 370, storm outage engine 110, damage prediction engine 120,<br>
maintenance crew prediction engine 130, or weather susceptibility data store 220 may be<br>
revised based on the actual data received at step 340. For example, storm outage engine<br>
110 may use the predicted and actual information in historical data store 290 to revise the<br>
engine rules, refine weather susceptibility information, refine multipliers used to determine<br>
predicted maintenance parameters, and the like. Step 370 may be performed automatically,<br>
may be done at periodic intervals, may request user authorization to effect each revision,<br>
and the like. Various steps of the methods may be repeated once additional information,<br>
for example, power circuit observations, and the like, become available to storm outage<br>
engine 110.<br>
[0091] Figure 6 shows a flow chart of an illustrative method for electric utility<br>
storm outage management. While the following description includes references to the<br>
system of Figure 3, the method may be implemented in a variety of ways, such as, for<br>
example, by a single computing engine, by multiple computing engines, via a standalone<br>
computing system, via a networked computing system, and the like.<br>
[0092] At step 600, storm outage engine 110 determines an interconnection model<br>
of the power circuit from interconnection model data store 210. The interconnection model<br>
may include information about the components of the power circuit, such as, for example,<br>
the location of power lines, the location of power poles, the location of power transformers<br>
and sectionalizing switches and protective devices, the type of sectionalizing switches, the<br>
location of power consumers, the interconnectivity of the power circuit components, the<br>
connectivity of the power circuit to consumers, the layout of the power circuit, and the like.<br>
[0093] At step 610, storm outage engine 110 determines a damage location, which<br>
may predicted and actual damage. Storm outage engine 110 may determine a damage<br>
location based on power circuit observations 230, such as, customer call information, update<br>
information from maintenance crews, information from data acquisition systems,<br>
information about power circuit recloser trips, information from damage assessment crews,<br>
and the like.<br>
[0094] At step 620, storm outage engine 110 determines a restoration sequence for<br>
the power circuit. The restoration sequence may be based on the damage location, which<br>
may include predicted and actual damage. The restoration sequence may also be based on<br>
the interconnection model. The restoration sequence may be determined using rules,<br>
assumptions, prioritizations, or the like. The restoration sequence may be determined to<br>
optimize for lowest cost, for shortest time to restoration, for some combination thereof, and<br>
the like. For example, storm outage engine 110 may determine a restoration sequence that<br>
prioritizes loads having higher numbers of customers first. In this manner, a greater number<br>
of customers may be restored to power is less time. Also, some critical loads may be<br>
prioritized higher than residential loads. For example, hospitals nursing homes may be<br>
given high priority in the restoration sequence.<br>
[0095] At step 630, storm outage engine 110 determines a predicted maintenance<br>
parameter, such as, for example, a time to restore power to a particular customer, based on<br>
the interconnection model, the restoration sequence, and the damage location. Time to<br>
restore power to a particular customer may also be determined based on predicted<br>
maintenance crew person-days to repair damages, and the like. Various steps of the<br>
methods may be repeated once additional information, for example, power circuit<br>
observations, power circuit restoration information, and the like, become available to storm<br>
outage engine 110.<br>
[0096] Storm outage engine 110 may also display the predicted maintenance<br>
parameter, such as, for example, a predicted time to restore power to a particular customer<br>
determined at step 630. Figure 9 shows such an illustrative display 990. As shown in<br>
Figure 9, display elements 900-913 correspond to power circuit elements 700-713,<br>
respectively. Display element 904 corresponds to load 704 and is displayed with a hashed<br>
line to indicate that load 704 is experiencing a power outage. Alternatively, display element<br>
904 may be displayed with a particular color to indicate that load 704 is experiencing a<br>
power outage. Display element 920 indicates the estimated time to restore load 704<br>
determined at step 630. As shown, display element 920 indicates that the estimated time to<br>
restore load 704 is 1 day. Display element 921 indicates the estimated time to restore load<br>
708 determined at step 630. As shown, display element 921 indicates that the estimated<br>
time to restore load 708 is 1.5 days. In this manner, an electric utility may communicate a<br>
predicted time to restore power to particular customer to that customer. Alternatively, the<br>
electric utility may decide to add some predefined time to the estimate, add some predefined<br>
percentage to the estimate, use the highest estimate of the entire feeder associated with a<br>
particular customer, and the like.<br>
[0097] Figure 10 shows another illustrative display 1090. As shown in Figure 10,<br>
display element 1000 represents substation 1 and display element 1010 represents substation<br>
2. Display elements 1000,1010 may be arranged on display 1090 in a particular geometry<br>
to represent the geometry of the power circuit. Display element 1001 is located proximate<br>
display element 1000 and indicates storm outage maintenance parameters associated with<br>
substation 1. Display element 1011 is located proximate display element 1010 and indicates<br>
storm outage maintenance parameters associated with substation 2. As shown, display<br>
element 1001 indicates that 5000 customers are experiencing a power outage, 5<br>
maintenance crews are currently assigned to substation 1, the worst case predicted time to<br>
power restoration (ETR) is 2 days, the average ETR is 1 day, and the predicted cost to repair<br>
is $15,000. Display element 1011 indicates that 10,000 customers are experiencing a power<br>
outage, 10 maintenance crews are currently assigned to substation 2, the worst case<br>
predicted time to power restoration (ETR) is 5 days, the average ETR is 1 day, and the<br>
predicted cost to repair is $30,000. In this manner, an electric utility can quickly review the<br>
deployment of maintenance crews to determine if the deployment corresponds with the<br>
number of customers experiencing outages and the like.<br>
[0098] As can be seen, the above described systems and methods provide a<br>
technique for efficient management of maintenance resources before and during an electric<br>
utility storm outage. As such, an electric utility may more efficiently prepare for and<br>
implement storm outage maintenance.<br>
