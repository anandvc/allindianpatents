				<td>PROCESS FOR GELATINES EXTRACTION AND CHROMIUM SALTS RECOVERY FROM TANNED HIDES<br>
AND SKIN SHAVINGS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention refers to a process for gelatine extraction and chromium<br>
salts separation from tanned hides and skins, with recovery of the hydrolysing<br>
agent.<br>
TECHNICAL NOTE<br>
The environmental impacts of hides and skins tanning are most significant since<br>
the process produces large amounts of hardly disposable wastes and uses highly<br>
polluting heavy metals, such as chromium. Therefuie, the disposal of by-products<br>
of the tannery industry is a real problem. The methods of disposal adopted so far<br>
are the following: waste disposal in authorised landfills, non-differentiated waste<br>
incineration in bulk, and waste conversion—thougr; in very low amounts—into<br>
nitrogen fertiliser. However, said methods do not solve the problem, but make it<br>
more serious: in fact, the wastes from the tannery industry contain approx. 3%<br>
chromium, which, though trivalent, is a heavy metal and tends to accumulate.<br>
Therefore, when said wastes are disposed of in landfills or are used for the<br>
production of nitrogen fertiliser, they cause serious soil pollution problems.<br>
Incineration is not advisable at all as it brings about the formation—by high<br>
temperature oxidation—of highly toxic hexavalent chromium and other combustion<br>
by-products, also in the gas phase, which are polluting and toxic to varying<br>
degrees.<br>
On the other hand, as suggested by the attempts made to dispose of wastes<br>
through the so-called "leather torrefaction"-which gives nitrogen fertiliser-most by-<br>
products, after adequate treatments, may be of high economic value from the<br>
recycling viewpoint. It is common knowledge that by-products of the tannery<br>
industry can give technical-grade gelatines as well as chromium, which, if<br>
recovered appropriately, may be reused in hides and skins tanning. In fact, most of<br>
said by-products consist of collagen-derived protein materials, which can yield<br>
different gelatines having a wide range of industrial application. Except for the<br>
foodstuff or pharmaceutical industries, for which the use of products from tannery<br>
is forbidden, technical-grade gelatines are widely used especially as adhesives in<br><br>
many other industrial sectors, e.g. in the industry of dyes and plasters, of matches<br>
and abrasives, textiles, paper and cardboard, and bookbinding.<br>
Traditionally, the most widely used process for technical-grade gelatines<br>
production from by-products derived from hides and skins splitting, consists in<br>
practice as example a treatment with 15% limewash and in the washing with<br>
running water, followed by lime residues neutralisation with acids and gelatines<br>
extraction in water at a temperature of 80° to 100°C. However, this process is<br>
characterised by a very high water consumption (up to 80 m3/hr) as well as by the<br>
production of poor-quality technical-grade gelatines. Furthermore, the sector of<br>
technical-grade gelatine production has now to face a difficult situation, i.e. the<br>
scarce availability of starting by-products, mostly due to the present trend to locate<br>
said productions in developing countries. However, the technical-grade gelatines<br>
produced in developing countries not always comply with the technical<br>
specifications requested by product users.<br>
Instead, tanned hides and skins shaving is sufficiently, if not abundantly, available<br>
in industrialised countries, where other problems arise in connection with shaving<br>
disposal and by-products recovery for recycling (collagen gelatine and chromium).<br>
To this end, several processes for gelatines production from low-chromium-content<br>
collagen have been developed: they are mostly based on alkaline hydrolysis with<br>
hot strong alkalis, gelatine extraction, chromium insolubilisation, followed by<br>
successive separations. In other processes, alkaline hydrolysis is preceded by<br>
chromium removal from the hides and skins shaving with acid chemical agents<br>
capable of binding trivalent chromium and by the separation of same by<br>
precipitation. In still further processes, hydrolysis is followed by the oxidation of the<br>
trivalent chromium residue to hexavalent chromium and by the separation of same.<br>
Said processes for the obtainment of low-chromium content gelatines, based on<br>
treatments with alkaline reagents for collagen hydrolysis and chromium separation,<br>
are multi-stage and therefore hardly applicable to the industrial sector. However,<br>
alkaline treatments give low-quality gelatines and bring about the production of<br>
ammonia by the amidic group degradation.<br>
It is, therefore, a major object to develop a process, easily applicable to industrial<br>
plants, which, starting from tanned hides and skins shaving containing Cr(lll),<br><br>
might allow-through few steps--the obtainment of choice collagen gelatines in high<br>
yields as well as chromium salts that may be recovered and reused in industrial<br>
plants. Consequently, the problem arising from their disposal would be minimised.<br>
It is a further object to develop an industrially efficient production process having<br>
no environmental impact, which, therefore, may envisage a complete reuse of its<br>
by-products (wastewaters and hydrolysing agent), and does not generate polluting<br>
gas emissions.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
A surprisingly advantageous process according to the objects of the present<br>
invention has been developed by the Applicant. The process-involving few steps<br>
and no alkaline treatment-gives a choice product (gelatines) with good Bloom<br>
mechanical resistance, which, therefore, may be used for industrial purposes, and<br>
allows the recovery, from tanned hides and skins shaving, of chromium, which may<br>
be reused in the tanning industry. From an industrial point of view, the claimed<br>
process also allows the recovery of its by-products (hydrolysing agent and water),<br>
and from an environmental point of view it is compatible with environmental impact<br>
requirements. Hence it complies with the objects of the present invention.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a process<br>
characterised by acid hydrolysis of tanned hides and skins shaving, containing<br>
chromium(lll), at a pressure below the atmospheric and at relatively low<br>
temperatures.<br>
The process for gelatines production and chromium salts recovery, object of the<br>
present invention is characterised at least by the following steps:<br>
a)	organic acid hydrolysis of tanned hides and skins shaving products at<br>
temperatures to 100° C;<br>
b)	extraction of the raw gelatine in solution obtained after hydrolysis by<br>
filtration with recycling of non-hydrolysed products, if any, to hydrolysis;<br>
c)	gelatine and chromium salts separation by desalination over ion<br>
exchange resins.<br>
Further objects of the present invention are i) recovery of the acid hydrolysing<br>
agent and water for recycling and ii) total chromium recovery after desalination by<br>
ion resins selective regeneration.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As shown in the flow diagram of Figure 1, the process for gelatines production and<br>
chromium salts recovery from tanned hides and skins shaving, forming the object<br>
of the present invention, is continuous type and consists in the following steps:<br>
a)	organic acid hydrolysis of tanned hides and skins shaving products at<br>
temperatures to 100° C;<br>
b)	dilution with water of the material resulting from the first hydrolysis;<br>
c)	extraction of the raw gelatine in solution obtained after hydrolysis by<br>
mechanical filtration with recycling to hydrolysis of non-hydrolysed<br>
products, if any;<br>
d)	gelatine separation from chromium salts and clarification of the same by<br>
desalination carried out by filtration through ion exchange resins;<br>
e)	concentration, cooling and drying of the resulting gelatine and water<br>
recycling;<br>
f)	concentration of the chromium salts obtained by ion exchange filters<br>
standard regeneration, by evaporation in vacuo with recovery of<br>
chromium salts and of water to be recycled.<br>
As reported in the Summary, the essential production steps characterising the<br>
whole process are: acid hydrolysis in an aqueous medium of tanned hides and<br>
skins shaving products; raw gelatine extraction by filtration of the hydrolysate in<br>
solution; gelatine separation by desalination over ion exchange resins with gelatine<br>
clarification and chromium separation.<br>
A detailed description of the production steps indicated in the flow diagram of<br>
Figure 1 is given hereinbelow.<br>
Acid hydrolysis<br>
Tanned hides and skins shaving products having an average moisture content<br>
of approximately 55%, which otherwise would be disposed of, are sent to plant<br>
storage areas, wherefrom they are conveyed and fed to reaction tanks, provided<br>
with products weighing means. On the basis of the amount of products loaded,<br>
through a preset programme, an electronic control system calculates the amount of<br>
reagents to be fed (water and acids). To favour hydrolysis, the mass may be<br>
maintained under continued stirring.<br><br>
The quantity of acids is predetermined at 10 to 80% wt/wt in respect of the weight<br>
of shaving as it is, with an average moisture content of approx. 55%. Water is fed<br>
at room temperature in a water weight ratio ranging from 4 to 10 times the weight<br>
of shaving as it is, having an average moisture content of approximately 55%.<br><br>
The hydrolysing agents preferably used for acid hydrolysis are organic acids<br>
selected from the group consisting of monocarboxylic, polycarboxylic, hydroxy<br>
acids, such as for example formic, lactic, citric, EDTA, tartaric acids and equivalent<br>
acids, the salts and mixtures thereof. Optionally, the organic acids, both salified<br>
and as mixtures thereof, may be added with mineral acids, such as for example<br>
sulphuric, phosphoric and equivalent acids in an amount of 5 to 20% in respect of<br>
the shaving mass.<br>
The mass in the tank is heated to a temperature up to 100°C. and the time of<br>
residence under said temperature conditions is from 0.5 to 30 hours. By way of<br>
example, the mass may be heated with steam at a pressure of 0.5 to 1 bar.<br>
The temperature and the time of residence under the selected temperature<br>
conditions influence the hydrolysis of the protein material and, consequently, the<br>
quali- and quantitative yield of the gelatine produced. To a higher temperature and<br>
longer time corresponds a gelatine in higher yields, but of poorer quality, measured<br>
as mechanical resistance index (Bloom's parameter). It follows that the process<br>
physical parameters are to be fixed on the basis of the type of gelatine to be<br>
produced.<br>
Continuous mass mixing by blade or anchor stirrer favours the hydrolysis kinetics<br>
and increases the yield.<br>
Raw gelatine dilution and extraction by filtration<br>
Once acid hydrolysis has been performed, the mass in the reaction tank is added<br>
with the water necessary for the other steps. The hydrolysed protein fraction, which<br>
consists of raw gelatine, is separated from the solid mass fraction consisting of<br>
non-hydrolysed shaving products, by filtration with mechanical filtering means,<br>
such as for example, centrifugal separators, drum filters, bag filters, filter press,<br>
rotational separators and equivalent means. The solid mass is defined as<br>
unreacted solid residue. The protein fraction hydrolysed in solution, which contains<br>
raw gelatine, is conveyed to the successive steps, while the solid fraction is<br>
recycled to hydrolysis. The hydrolysis/filtration sequence may be repeated on the<br>
chromium solid residue to extract the greatest possible, if not the whole amount of<br>
gelatine. The gelatine qualitative yields are constant independently of the increase<br>
in number of the extraction cycles.<br><br>
Gelatine separation by desalination<br>
The raw gelatine solution obtained by mechanical filtration contains the hydrolysing<br>
agent, chromium salts and impurities, such as ashes, in amounts exceeding the<br>
allowable limits provided for by the technical specifications of the product for<br>
industrial use.<br>
The raw gelatine solution is subjected to desalination to simultaneously free the<br>
solution from water, acid hydrolysing agents and chromium salt residues and to<br>
abate ashes, without significant protein substances losses. The purification takes<br>
place by filtration through ion, cation and anion or mixed-bed exchange resins,<br>
selective for trivalent chromium. Resin filters are periodically regenerated to extract<br>
the captured chromium salts. The regeneration solution is then recycled to the<br>
separated chromium salts concentration step.<br>
Concentration, cooling and drying<br>
The resulting gelatine solution is fed to a multiple-effect evaporator and then<br>
coooled and dried, e.g. in air dryers.<br>
Chromium salts concentration<br>
The chromium salts solution, containing trivalent chromium salts, obtained by<br>
resins regeneration of the desalination step, is concentrated by evaporation<br>
preferably in vacuo, to give a concentrate, utilised by salcrome manufacturers for<br>
tanning, and water which is recycled.<br>
With a view to improving the process yields and efficiency, the claimed process for<br>
gelatines and chromium salts production may optionally include, after acid<br>
hydrolysis (step a) and after raw gelatine filtration (step c), the following steps:<br>
-	gelatine separation from chromium salts and clarification by dialysis across<br>
membranes;<br>
-	chromium salts separation by diafiltration through membranes with<br>
separation from the hydrolysing agent of the first step and recycling of the<br>
same.<br>
The above optional steps allow the obtainment of gelatine of higher quality and the<br>
recovery of chromium-free hydrolysing agent, which may be recycled again. The<br>
gelatine solutions obtained in the first dialysis may be sent to desalination or<br>
directly concentrated and dried as previously described.<br><br>
As shown in detail in the flow diagram of Figure 2, the process forming the object<br>
of the present invention, is continuous type and includes the following steps:<br>
a)	organic acid hydrolysis of tanned hides and skins shaving products at<br>
temperatures to 100° C;<br>
b)	dilution with water of the product obtained from the first hydrolysis;<br>
c)	extraction of raw gelatine in solution obtained after hydrolysis by<br>
mechanical filtration and recycling of non-hydrolysed products, if any, to<br>
hydrolysis;<br>
d)	gelatine separation by dialysis across selective membranes for gelatine<br>
clarification and separation from chromium salts;<br>
e)	gelatine desalination by filtration of the chromium residue through resins;<br>
f)	concentration, cooling and drying of the gelatine separated and water<br>
recycling;<br>
g)	chromium separation by diafiltration through membranes selective for<br>
chromium salts with separation from the hydrolysing agent of the first<br>
step;<br>
h) concentration of the hydrolysing agent over selective membranes with<br>
recovery of the same and of water to be recycled;<br>
i) concentration of chromium salts obtained by diafiltration and ion<br>
exchange filters regeneration, by evaporation in vacuo with recovery of<br>
chromium salts and water to be recycled.<br>
The essential production steps characterising the whole process are: acid<br>
hydrolysis of tanned hides and skins shaving products; raw gelatine extraction by<br>
filtration of the hydrolysate in solution; gelatine separation from chromium and<br>
clarification by dialysis, diafiltration of the solution containing chromium salts.<br>
The optional steps included in the flow diagram of Figure 2 are described in detail<br>
hereinbelow. The basic steps are as described above.<br>
Gelatine separation by dialysis<br>
The raw gelatine solution obtained by mechanical filtration may be optionally<br>
subjected to dialysis before desalination. By portionwise water addition, dialysis<br>
allows the simultaneous removal of acid hydrolysing agents and chromium salts<br>
from the water solution and the abatement of ashes, without significant protein<br><br>
losses. The filtering means used for dialysis are porous membranes with molecular<br>
sieves of 1,000 to 30,000 dalton, which retain protein molecules of approx. 50,000<br>
dalton and do not retain low-ionic-charge molecules, such as chromium salts and<br>
acids. The acid solution recovered from dialysis is sent to the recovery of the<br>
hydrolysing solution and chromium salts.<br>
Chromium salts separation by diafiltration<br>
The solutions containing the chromium salts and hydrolysing agent recovered from<br>
dialysis are diafiltered through selective membranes, to separate chromium salts<br>
from the hydrolysing agent. Diafiltration uses filtering means with porous<br>
membranes with molecular sieves of 200 to 500 dalton, which retain the bi-trivalent<br>
ion species and do not retain low-ionic-charge molecules, such as the hydrolysing<br>
agent. The two fractions are recovered after an appropriate concentration. The<br>
hydrolysing agent is recovered up to 70%.<br>
Hydrolysing agent concentration<br>
The hydrolysing agent is recovered and recycled to hydrolysis after concentration,<br>
which may be performed with reverse osmosis membranes or with evaporators in<br>
vacuo. The water recovered is recycled.<br>
Chromium salts concentration<br>
The chromium salts solutions, which contain trivalent chromium, obtained by<br>
diafiltration and resins washings of the desalination step, are concentrated by<br>
evaporation in vacuo, as previously described. The concentrate obtained is utilised<br>
by salcrome manufacturers for tanning. Water is recycled.<br>
With a view to efficiently recovering-from an industrial standpoint-mainly the<br>
chromium separated and secondarily the hydrolysing agent, the claimed process,<br>
after desalination optionally includes a particular type of ion exchange<br>
regeneration, meant for:<br>
-	decreasing the consumption of reagents used in ion exchange filters<br>
regeneration;<br>
-	producing a more concentrated chromium salts solution that does not<br>
require a further concentration, thereby reducing the volumes to be<br>
concentrated and effecting a saving in energy.<br>
As shown in the flow diagram of Figure 3, the claimed process is continuous type<br><br>
and includes the following steps:<br>
a)	organic acid hydrolysis of tanned hides and skins shaving products at<br>
temperatures to 100° C;<br>
b)	dilution with water of the material obtained by the first hydrolysis;<br>
c)	extraction of the raw gelatine in solution obtained after hydrolysis by<br>
mechanical filtration with recycling of non-hydrolysed products, if any,<br>
to hydrolysis;<br>
d)	gelatine desalination by filtration of the chromium residue through<br>
resins;<br>
e)	selective regeneration of ion exchange filters;<br>
f)	concentration, cooling and drying of the gelatine separated and water<br>
recycling.<br>
The optional steps included in the flow diagram of Figure 3 are described in detail<br>
hereinbelow. The basic steps are as described above.<br>
Selective regeneration of ion exchange filters<br>
Whenever ion exchange filters lose their ability to retain salts, they must be<br>
regenerated by means of adequately diluted acid and alkaline regenerants and of<br>
successive washings. The technique adopted here consists in the separation of<br>
three regeneration phases, denominated head, core, and tail, where:<br>
-	the head is poor in regenerant and chromium salts;<br>
-	the core is poor in regenerant, but is rich in chromium salts, and forms the<br>
concentrated phase;<br>
-	the tail is rich in regenerant and poor in chromium salts.<br>
Head and tail are combined and, by fresh regenerant make up, reconstitute the<br>
regenerating solution for the next regenerating cycles.<br>
The core consists of a solution with a chromium content of 2 to 4% by wt, which<br>
does not need any further concentration.<br>
The consumption of regenerant (both alkaline and acid) is thereby reduced by<br>
approx. 50%, while the volume of exhaust wash waters, which still contain<br>
chromium salts and, therefore, must be concentrated, is reduced by approx. 70%.<br>
The continuous process for gelatines production and the complete recovery of<br>
chromium salts, as well as of the hydrolysing agent and water, which consists of all<br><br>
steps previously described, also includes the following steps, as reported in the<br>
flow diagram of Figure 4:<br>
a)	organic acid hydrolysis of tanned hides and skins shaving products at<br>
temperatures to 100° C;<br>
b)	dilution with water of the material obtained by the first hydrolysis;<br>
c)	extraction of the raw gelatine in solution obtained after hydrolysis by<br>
mechanical filtration and recycling to hydrolysis of non-hydrolysed products,<br>
if any;<br><br>
d)	gelatine separation by dialysis across selective membranes for gelatine<br>
clarification and separation of the same from chromium salts;<br>
e)	chromium separation by diafiltration through membranes selective for<br>
chromium salts with separation from the hydrolysing agent of the first step;<br>
f)	concentration of the hydrolysing agent over selective membranes with<br>
recovery of the same and of water to be recycled;<br>
g)	gelatine desalination by filtration of the chromium residue through resins;<br>
h) concentration, cooling and drying of the gelatine separated;<br>
i) selective regeneration of ion exchange filters;<br>
j) concentration of the chromium salts obtained by diafiltration and ion<br>
exchange filters regeneration, by evaporation in vacuo with recovery of<br>
chromium salts and of water to be recycled.<br>
The following examples concerning gelatines preparation and chromium salts and<br>
hydrolysing agent recovery on the basis of the claimed process, are conveyed by<br>
way of illustration, not of limitation of the present invention.<br>
Example 1: Acid hydrolysis, filtration and desalination<br>
A 200 I reactor was fed with shaving (10 kg) containing 56% moisture and approx.<br>
2% trivalent chromium, with 20-30% by wt. citric acid solution (6 kg) and distilled<br>
water (34 kg). Shaving was allowed to hydrate at room temperature for some hours<br>
and stirred by an anchor stirrer. The reaction mass was heated to 20°C with<br>
continued stirring by an anchor stirrer and slight air bubbling to favour mixing.<br>
Hydrolysis was started by steam modulation in the reactor jacket. After 2-hr<br>
heating to 80-90°C, hydrolysis of the shaving was obtained. The resulting product<br>
was diluted with distilled water in a ratio equal to 1:1 by wt. to give a solution (90 I)<br>
at 60°C, with 9% glue weight.<br>
Filtration, which was carried out with 100 micron felt vessel mechanical bag filter<br>
instead of a centrifuge, had been preceded by a first rough filtration using a 400<br>
micron filtering bag and a further dilution thermostated at 50°C in a batch reactor.<br>
Filtration gave a 100 micron hydrolysate solution and approx. 3-4% unreacted<br>
residue (on a dry basis).<br>
Hydrolysis yield referred to shaving as it is: 83% by wt.<br>
A portion of gelatine obtained by acid hydrolysis and filtration was desalted by<br><br>
causing it to pass in two columns containing weak anion resin and strong cation<br>
resin (150 ml each). In particular, gelatine (380 ml) was diluted with distilled water<br>
(1:1) and caused to pass in two columns containing anion resin A100 and cation<br>
resin C150 (150 ml), regenerated and preheated to 180°C with water. This<br>
operation was performed with diluted gelatine at 50°C at a specific rate of 5 BV<br>
(Bed Volume). The resulting solution was concentrated in vacuo.<br>
Desalination gave a gelatine solution exhibiting:<br>
glue weight: 16%; sp. gr.: 1.034 at 40°C; viscosity: 115.4 mpoise at 40°C.<br>
Solution drying gave a gelatine exhibiting the following characteristics:<br>
Bloom: 421; viscosity: 127 mpoise; citric acid: n.d.; Cr(lll): 0.15% by wt.; moisture<br>
content: 17%; ashes content at 560°C: 1.1%.<br>
Example 2: Acid hydrolysis, filtration and desalination<br>
A laboratory flask was fed with shaving (50 g) containing 56% moisture and<br>
approx. 2% trivalent chromium, and with 9 to 10% lactic acid solution (400 ml).<br>
Once the mass had been hydrated for some hours at room temperature under<br>
stirring by an anchor stirrer, it was hydrolysed (96%) at approx. 90ºC for 30 min.,<br>
then diluted with distilled water (1:1) at room temperature and filtered through<br>
drymad cloth. The solution was allowed to percolate into a column containing<br>
mixed bed resins, preheated with water to 80°C. The solution was concentrated<br>
and dried to give a gelatine exhibiting the following characteristics:<br>
Bloom: 370; Cr(lll): 0.2% by wt.; ashes content: 1.5% by wt.; moisture content:<br>
10% by wt.<br>
Example 3: Gelatine dialysis, concentration and drying<br>
The gelatine solution obtained by filtration as per example 1 was collected in a<br>
tank and thermostated at 50°C. The solution was dialysed by an ultrafiltration unit<br>
with a membrane with cut-off of approx 6000 to separate the gelatine from the<br>
hydrolysing agent and chromium, once the retentate (gelatine) volume had been<br>
reduced by 50%, and osmosized water at 50°C had been added portionwise in a<br>
1:2 ratio by vol. to favour the dialysis of citric acid and of chromium. Finally, the<br>
retentate was further reduced.<br>
Dialysis gave:<br>
a gelatine with a citric acid residue of 0.2% by wt. and a chromium residue of<br><br>
0.01% by wt;<br>
a permeate with a citric acid content of approx. 0.2% by wt. and a chromium<br>
content of 0.005% by wt.<br>
The gelatine solution obtained by dialysis was concentrated to give a semi-firm<br>
gelatine with 12.5% glue weight as well as distilled water that was recovered.<br>
The semi-firm gelatine was solidified, ground and dried. Concentration gave a<br>
gelatine exhibiting the following characteristics:<br>
Yield referred to hydrolysed shaving: 30% by wt.; Bloom: 324; moisture content:<br>
3%; viscosity (Ostwald): 177 mpoise at 12.5%; citric acid: 5% by wt.; Cr(lll): 0.2%<br>
by wt.; ashes content at 560°C: 2.1%.<br>
Example 4: Citric acid diafiltration<br>
The permeate obtained by gelatine dialysis as per example 3 was concentrated by<br>
means of a nanofiltration unit with membrane with cut-offs of 200 to 300, to give a<br>
permeate free from chromium, but with a small amount of recovered citric acid.<br>
Said amount is small because the process is batch type; instead a continuous<br>
process under steady-state conditions would give a higher amount of recovered<br>
citric acid. Diafiltration gave:<br>
a permeate free from chromium and with a citric acid content of 0.02% by wt.;<br>
a retentate with a citric acid content of 1.4% by wt. and a chromium content of<br>
0.039% by wt.<br>
The permeate obtained by diafiltration was concentrated by a reverse osmosis<br>
unit. In particular, the following was obtained:<br>
a retentate with citric acid content of 0.3% by wt.;<br>
osmosized water with a citric acid residue of 30 ppm.<br>
Example 5: Acid hydrolysis, filtration and dialysis<br>
A laboratory flask was fed with shaving (50 g) containing 56% moisture and<br>
approx. 2% trivalent chromium, and with a 4-5% citric acid solution (600 ml). The<br>
mass was hydrolysed (99%) at approx. 50°C for 30 hrs. under stirring by an anchor<br>
stirrer, diluted with distilled water (1:1) at room temperature and filtered through<br>
drymad cloth. The filtered solution was dialysed by ultrafiltration with dialysis cell<br>
with addition of distilled water (3 I) at 50°C. The solution was concentrated and<br>
dried to give a gelatine exhibiting the following characteristics:<br><br>
Bloom: approx. 370; Cr(lll): 0.4% by wt.; ashes content: 2% by wt.; moisture<br>
content: 6% by wt.<br>
Example 6: Selective regeneration of resins columns<br>
Once the gelatine sample had been desalted as per Example 1, the anion resin<br>
column was regenerated with a solution consisting of 30% NaOH and distilled<br>
water heated to 60°C, in a 1:5 ratio by vol. The column was washed with low-flow-<br>
rate distilled water and then with high-flow-rate distilled water. Eluates were<br>
collected to obtain a concentrated eluate (core) rich in trivalent chromium.<br>
The head and tail, which consisted of aqueous eluate and, respectively, of an<br>
eluate poor in Cr, were combined to give the mother liquid which may be reused to<br>
regenerate the anion column in the successive steps:<br>
head+tail: 40% by vol.; Cr content: 0.04%, NaOH content: 0.7%.<br>
The "core" is the concentrate that may be utilised by salcromo manufacturers.<br>
Core: 10% by vol.; Cr content: 0.2%, NaOH content: 0.3%.<br>
Example 7: Acid hydrolysis, filtration, dialysis, desalination, diafiltration and<br>
selective regeneration<br>
A 200 I reactor was fed with shaving (10 kg) containing 56% moisture and approx.<br>
2% trivalent chromium, with 20-30% by wt. citric acid solution (6 kg) and distilled<br>
water (34 kg). Shaving was allowed to hydrate at room temperature for some hours<br>
and stirred by means of an anchor stirrer. The reaction mass was heated to 20°C<br>
with continued stirring by an anchor stirrer and slight air bubbling to favour mixing.<br>
Hydrolysis was started by steam modulation in the reactor jacket. After 2-hr<br>
heating to 80-90°C, hydrolysis of the shaving was obtained. The resulting product<br>
was diluted with distilled water in a ratio equal to 1:1 by wt. to give a solution (90 I)<br>
at 60°C, with 9% glue weight.<br>
Filtration, which was carried out with 100 micron felt vessel mechanical bag filter<br>
and not with a centrifuge, had been preceded by a first rough filtration using a 400<br>
micron filtering bag, and a further dilution thermostatted at 50°C in a batch reactor.<br>
Filtration gave a 100 micron hydrolysate solution and approx. 3-4% unreacted<br>
residue (on a dry basis).<br>
Hydrolysis yield referred to shaving as it is: 83% by wt.<br>
The gelatine solution resulting from filtration was collected in a tank and<br><br>
thermostated at 50°C. The solution was dialysed by an ultrafiltration unit with a<br>
membrane with cut-off of approx 6000 to separate the gelatine from the hydrolysis<br>
agent and chromium, once the retentate (gelatine) volume had been reduced by<br>
approx. 50%, and osmosized water at 50°C had been added portionwise in a 1:2<br>
ratio by vol. to favour the dialysis of citric acid and of chromium. Finally, the<br>
retentate was further reduced.<br>
Dialysis gave:<br>
a gelatine with a citric acid residue of 0.2% by wt. and a chromium residue of<br>
0.01% by wt.;<br>
a permeate with a citric acid content of approx. 0.2% by wt. and a chromium<br>
content of 0.005% by wt.<br>
Some gelatine solution obtained by dialysis was desalted by causing it to pass in<br>
two columns containing weak anion resin and strong cation resin (150 ml each). In<br>
particular, gelatine (400 ml) was diluted with distilled water (1:1) and caused to<br>
pass in two columns containing anion resin A100 and cation resin C150 (150 ml),<br>
regenerated and preheated to 80°C with water. This operation was performed with<br>
diluted gelatine at 50°C at a specific rate of 5 BV (Bed Volume). The resulting<br>
solution was. concentrated in vacuo.<br>
Solution drying gave a gelatine exhibiting the following characteristics:<br>
Bloom: 436; viscosity: 153 mpoise; citric acid: n.d.; Cr(lll): 0.12% by wt.; moisture<br>
content: 17%; ashes content at 560°C: 1.5%.<br>
The permeate obtained by gelatine dialysis was concentrated by means of a<br>
nanofiltration unit with membrane with a cut-off of 200 to 300, to give a permeate<br>
free from chromium, but with a small amount of recovered citric acid. Said amount<br>
is small because the process is batch type; instead a continuous process under<br>
steady-state conditions would give a higher amount of recovered citric acid.<br>
Diafiltration gave:<br>
a permeate free from chromium and with a citric acid content of 0.02% by wt.;<br>
a retentate with a citric acid content of 1.4% by wt. and a chromium content of<br>
0.039% by wt.<br>
The permeate obtained by diafiltration was concentrated by a reverse osmosis<br>
unit. In particular, the following was obtained:<br><br>
a retentate with a citric acid content of 0.3% by wt.;<br>
osmosized water with a citric acid residue of 30 ppm.<br>
Once the gelatine sample had been desalted, the anion resin column was<br>
regenerated with a solution consisting of 30% NaOH and distilled water heated to<br>
60°C, in a 1:5 ratio by vol. The column was washed with low-fjow-rate distilled<br>
water and then with high-flow-rate distilled water. Eluates were collected to obtain<br>
a concentrated eluate (core) rich in trivalent chromium.<br>
The head and tail, which consisted of aqueous eluate and, respectively, of an<br>
eluate poor in Cr, were combined to give the mother liquid which may be reused to<br>
regenerate the anion column in the successive steps:<br>
head+tail: 40% by vol.; Cr content: 0.04%, NaOH content: 0.7%.<br>
The "core" is the concentrate that may be utilised by salcromc manufacturers.<br>
Core: 10% by vol.; Cr content: 0.2%, NaOH content: 0.3%.<br>
The claimed process entirely complies with the aforementioned objects of the<br>
present invention, i.e. the development of industrial processes, capable of<br>
recovering—from tanned hides and skins shaving-by-products (collagen gelatine<br>
and chromium) that may be recycled to and reused in industrial plants, thereby<br>
minimising the problem arising from their disposal; the obtainment of choice<br>
products of high economic value, for successive industrial applications; the<br>
development of a process having no environmental impact and, therefore,<br>
envisaging a complete reuse of its by-products (hydrolysing agents, regenerants,<br>
and wastewaters) and not generating polluting gas emissions.<br>
In this respect, it is to be noted that the envisaged and essential acid hydrolysis is<br>
very fast and gives a hydrolysate in a yield of approx. 80% in respect: of shaving as<br>
it is, without any alkaline treatment. Finally, the hydrolysis gives a gelatine of<br>
satisfactory quality and, in any case, exhibiting a Bloom's resistance not less than<br>
300, and does not generate gaseous by-products. Non-hydrolysed tanned hides<br>
and skins shaving products may be recycled for further hydrolysis. Said step may<br>
be repeated several times until complete, or anyhow, exhaustive hydrolysis of the<br>
starting material without detriment to the gelatine qualitative yields. The successive<br>
hydrolysis cycles, in fact, give technical-grade gelatines exhibiting constant<br><br>
qualitative chacteristics.<br>
The hydrolysate consisting of gelatine, hydrolysing agent and chromium salts is<br>
separated in successive separation steps to give three main products: gelatine,<br>
regenerated hydrolysing agent and chromium salts in solution.<br>
All products are further processed and recovered: in particular, the gelatine is<br>
marketed; the chromium salts are utilised by salcromo manufacturers for tanning<br>
and, therefore, is reused industrially; the hydrolysing agent, the ion-exchange-<br>
columns regenerant and water are continuously recycled.<br>
It is of major importance that the process never uses polluting agents and does not<br>
generate liquid or gaseous emissions: therefore, it is ecofriendly. Only relatine<br>
drying brings about a low water loss. A further, but not secondary feature related to<br>
the environmental impact of the process is that--unlike the processes for protein<br>
hydrolysates production by alkaline hydrolysis—the process degradation of the<br>
amidic group does not produce ammonia.<br>
Numerous variations and modifications may be effected without departing from the<br>
spirit and scope of the novel concept of the invention. Therefore, the claimed<br>
process may be modified and perfected by those skilled in the art, according to the<br>
technical knowledge and experience gained in the sector as well as to the normal<br>
evolution of the state of the art<br><br>
