				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a novel device useful for the delivery of physiologically active substances or nutrients. More particularly the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of shells, from the material of plant origin or semisynthetic polymers, for delivery of drugs and nutrients.<br>
Gelatin is a heterogeneous mixture of water soluble proteins of high average molecular weight. Gelatin is not found in nature but derived from collagen by hydrotytic action. It is obtained by boiling skin tendons, ligaments, bones etc., with acidic or alkaline water. Gelatin is colourless or slightly yellow, transparent, brittle, practically odourless, tasteless sheets, flakes, or coarse powder. Soluble in hot water, glycerol,  acetic acid and insoluble in organic solvents.  Shells for pharmaceutical dosage forms are usually made from gelatin. They may contain a preservative such as benzoic acid, a parahydroxybenzoic acid ester or sulphur dioxide. The main drawback of these slidl lies in their preparation because they are derived form the animal parts, which leads to their ncit-vegetarian nature. The other drawbacks associated with the hard gelatin capsules are depends on their storage conditions. When the humidity is low, the capsules become brittle; if stored at high humidities the capsules become flaccid and loose their shape. Storage in high temperature areas also can effect the quality of hard gelatin capsules [Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed., 1990, p 1658]. An alternative material from the plant source is reported here, which uses Tamarind seed poh/ose, from Tamarindus indica.<br>
Tamarindus indica is cultivated throughout India particularly abundant in Madhya Pradesh and South India specially in Tamil nadu, Mysore and Andhra Pradesh. Many medicinal values are claimed for various preparations from the fruit, leaf, flower, barks etc. of tamarind tree but only a few are well recognized. The antiscorbutic properties of the pulp, laxative action of the fruit juice and diuretic properties of leaf sap are well established. The pulp of the fruits is used as<br><br>
various edible house hold preparations and seeds are thrown away as waste. These waste seeds are used to extract in the yield of 20-2596 a valuable poh/ose [Tamarind seed pofyose (TSP)] of immense pharmaceutical use. The extraction process for this poh/saccharide of pharmaceutical grade has been developed at this Institute [Ind. Pat. No. 142092, 1975]. Tamarind seed polyose is light brown coloured brittle fibers without any perceptible odour and taste, and can be powdered to any mesh size. It is insoluble in organic sol vents and dispersible in water to form a highly viscous jelly like mucilaginous solution, unusual with other natural gums and mucilages. It is non-toxic, non-irritant, non-biodegradable but bioabsorbable by animal tissue. It has passed the subacute toxicity tests in rats and monkeys. It possesses a unique property of forming thin films having high tensile strength and flexibility. One of its major advantages over other naturally occurring polymers is its nonhygroscopic nature. This quality can lead to its further use in making capsules and cachets.<br>
Some cellulose derivatives such as methyl cellulose, hydroxy ethyl cellulose, carboxy methyl cellulose sodium salt are also dispersible in water and form a highly viscous jelly like<br>
mucilaginous solution. These are non-toxic and non-irritant. These are routinely used as filler or<br><br>
binder or disintegrating agents. Now we tried them for the preparation of a device useful for the<br>
delivery of physiologically active substances or nutrients.<br>
No purely vegetarian shell is known till date. In the present process the preparation of vegetable shells for pharmaceutical dosage forms is described.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a novel device useful for the delivery of physiologically active substances or nutrients which obiates the drawbacks of known device.<br><br>
The another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of shell using polysaccharide of plant origin or semisynthetic source.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a novel shell useful for drug delivery by using the process of the present invention.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a novel device in the form of capsule or cachets for the delivery of physiologically active substances or nutrients , which comprises the steps of : (i) preparing a 10-20 % mucilaginous solution of polysaccharide selected from tamarind seed polyose, cassia tora, cassia javenica, purified isapgol mucilage , cellulose derivatives , by wanning at 50-80 ° C hi a polar solvent, (ii) adding to the said polysaccharide solution , a mixture solution comprising a disintegrating agent ( 5 -20 % ), a plastisizer (5-20 %), a preservative (0.1 - 0.5 %) respectively of the kinds such as here in described , (iii) coating the resultant solution obtained at step (ii) on to pre-lubricated formers of desired shape and size such as capsule or cachets , (vi) drying the coated formers at a temperature ranging 50 - 70 ° C the by conventional methods as described herein , (v) polishing the device using known polishing agents by conventional manner.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the disintegrating agent used is selected from starch, carboxy methyl cellulose sodium salt, methyl cellulose .<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the preservative used is selected from benzoic acid, a parahydroxybenzoic acid ester or sulphur dioxide.microcrystalline cellulose.<br>
hi another embodiment of the present invention the plasticizer used is selected from castor oil, glycerol, propylene glycol.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention  the polar solution used for preparing mucilage solution is selected from water, glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or mixture thereof.<br><br>
The tubes used may be selected from the tubes of nylon, plastic, metallic, wooden. The polishing agent may be selected from shellac, modified shellac, poly vinyl pyrrolidone, epoxy resins, titanium dioxide.<br>
The use of disintegrating agent helps in decreasing the time required to deliver the drug by disintegrating of the shells in the gastro intestinal tract.<br>
Similarly the use of polishing/coating agent gives shining to the shells. The process of the present invention involves moistening mixture of polysaccharide and disintegrating agent with plasticiser, diluting with water and wanning to 50 - 80° C to make thick mucilaginous solution. To this solution preservative was added. The mucilage so formed was coated on the tubes after applying liquid lubricating agent on surface of tubes and dring the tubes by rotating in front of a blast of filtered air with controlled humidity. These are further allowed to dry in an oven at 50 - 80° C. The shells so formed were coated by known methods using polishing agent. The caps of the shell are also prepared by the same method. Each shell was stripped, trimmed to uniform length and joined.<br>
The following examples broadly illustrate the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed without limiting the nature, scope and application of the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
10% mucilaginous solution of tamarind seed polyose was prepared by warming a mixture of tamarind seed polyose (1 g) and starch (1 g) in castor oil (0.2 g) and water (10 ml) at 70° C. To this solution benzoic acid (10 mg) was added. This solution was coated on the nylon tubes after applying liquid paraffin on their surface. These coated tubes were first dried under a streem of dry air followed by dring at 70° C in an oven. The shells were stripped and trimmed to<br><br>
get shells. The caps of these shells were also prepared by the above method. The shells and caps were polished by dipping them in shallac solution and drying in air.<br>
Example - II<br>
20% mucilaginous solution of Cassia tora was prepared by wanning a mixture of Cassia tora (2 g) and methyl cellulose (1 g) in castor oil (0.2 g) and water (10 ml) at 70° C. To this solution methyl para hydroxy benzoate (10 mg) was added. This solution was coated on the nylon tubes after applying liquid paraffin on their surface. These coated tubes were first dried under a streem of dry air followed by dring at 70° C in an oven. The shells were stripped and trimmed to get shells. The caps of these shells were also prepared by the above method. The shells and caps were polished by dipping them in titanium dioxide solution and drying in air.<br>
Example - III<br>
Methyl cellulose (2 g), carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (1 g) was moist with glycerol and propylene glycol (0.2 ml each) and to it water (20 ml) was added to get mucilaginous solution. Nylon tubes (9 &amp; 10 mm thickness) round end were taken. These were coated with the mucellaginous solution to form uniform layers. The layer were dried by dipping in acetone containing shellac and allowed to dry in an oven at 50° C. Each capsule was stripped, trimmed to uniform length and joined.<br>
Example - IV<br>
Hydroxy ethyl cellulose (2 g), microcrystalline cellulose(l g) was moist with castor oil (0.4 ml) and to it water (20 ml) was added to get mucilaginous solution. To this solution salicylic acid (20 mg) was added. The solution so formed was coated on steel tubes to form uniform layers. The layer was dried by stream of hot air followed by drying in an oven at 60° C. The caps of these<br><br>
shells were also prepared by the above method. Each shell was stripped, trimmed to uniform length and joined.<br>
The advantages of the new device as prepared by the process of the present invention are that they provide a vegetable shells for pharmaceutical dosage forms One of major advantages is nonhygroscopic nature of these shells. These shells also overcomes the main draw backs associated with the hard gelatin capsules.<br><br><br><br><br>
