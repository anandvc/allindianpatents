In addition, they may be interrupted by hetero atoms, e.g. O or NR5. wherein R5 is hydrogen or C1-C4alkyl, Preference is given to a straight-chain or branched C1-C12alkylene radical. Special preference is given to C1-C6alkylene radicals, more especially C2-C4alkylene radicals. Propylene radicals, especially the 1.3-propylene radical, are of particular importance.<br>

or unsubstituted or amino-substituted cydohexyl; or phenyl-substituted C1-C4alkyl-<br>
Especially preferred dyes of formula (1) are those of formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
X1, X2, X3 and X4 are each independently of the others hydrogen, methyl or methoxy,<br>
especially hydrogen,<br>
Y1 is as defined above under formula (1), especially a bridging member of formula<br>
-NH-(CH2)6-NH-, and<br>
X  is an anion. As to X the preferences given above apply. Especially preferred dyes of formula (2) are those of formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
X1 and X2 are each independently of the others hydrogen, methyl or methoxy, especially<br>
hydrogen, and<br>
R5, R6 and X are as defined above under formula (2). As to R5, R6 and X the above preferences apply.<br><br>
Preferably, in formula (2a) R5 is hydrogen.<br>
Preferably, in formula (2a) R6 is unsubstituted or amino-substituted C5-C12alkyI; or unsubstituted or amino-substituted C5-C8cycloalkyl; or phenyl-substituted C1-C4alkyl,<br>
The dyes of formulae (1) and (2) can be prepared according to methods known perse (see e.g. EP-A-714 954).<br>
The dyes of formula (1) can be obtained, for example, by reacting a compound of formula<br><br>
wherein the substituents have the definitions and preferred meanings indicated above. Alternatively, it is also possible to use as compounds of formula (3) those compounds which, instead of the methoxy group indicated, contain halogen, e.g. chlorine, or C2-C4alkoxy. The compounds of formulae (3), (4a) and (4b) are known or can be prepared in a manner known per se. For example, the compounds of formula (3) can be obtained by diazotising 4-alkoxyanilines, coupling the product with an imidazole and then carrying out alkylation and qualernisation.<br>
The reaction of a compound of formula (3) with a diamine of formula (4a) or (4b) can be<br><br>
carried out, for example, at a temperature of about from 40 to 100°C. preferably from 40 to 70°C. optionally under pressure and/or in an inert gas atmosphere, and in an inert solvent, e.g, in water or aliphatic alcohols, e.g. C1-C8alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol or especially isopropanol, but more especially in aprotic polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulfoxide. In the case of diamines that are liquid under the reaction conditions, it is possible, if desired, to dispense with a solvent.<br>
The dyes of formula (2) can be obtained, for example, in a similar way as given above for the preparation of the compounds of formula (1). However, instead of the diamines of formulae (4a) and (4b) an amine of formula HN(R5)R6 is used.<br>
The dyes of formulae (1) and (2) according to the invention are suitable for dyeing polyacryionitrile materials and leather, but especially for dyeing paper, since they possess a high substantivity for that substrate. The dyes give dyeings in red shades. The resulting dyeings are distinguished by good fastness properties. The effluents are in most cases completely colourless.<br>
The dyes of formula (1) or (2) may also be used in mixtures with other cationic dyes. Especially preferred dye mixtures are those which contain a dye of formula (1) or a dye of formula (2) and a cationic copper phthalocyanine dye. Using such mixtures theR6 are obtained on paper dyeings in highly attractive neutral shades. Suitable copper phthalocyanine dyes are those dyes which are known from the literature and can be used for the dyeing of paper, especially the dyes described in EP-A-0 184 991, DE-A-3 111 199 and EP-A-0 174 586,<br>
The dyes of formula (1) or (2) can be formulated as a solid or liquid commercial form and employed for the dyeing of paper.<br>
In the form of powder or granules, the dyes are used especially in discontinuous mass dyeing, in which the dye is added in batches to the pulper, hollander or mixing vat. In this case the dyes are preferably used in the form of dye preparations which may comprise diluents, e.g. urea as solubiliser, dextrins, Glauber's salt, sodium chloride and dispersants, dusting agents and sequestrants, such as tetrasodium pyrophosphate.<br><br>
The invention accordingly relates also to solid dye preparations for the dyeing of paper which comprise dyes of formula (1) or (2).<br>
In recent years, the use of concentrated aqueous solutions of dyes has gained in importance, specifically because of the advantages which such solutions have over dyes in powder form. By using solutions, the difficulties associated with the formation of dust are avoided and the user is freed from the time-consuming and often difficult dissolution of the dye powder in water. The use of concentrated solutions has been prompted furthermore by the development of continuous dyeing processes for paper, since in those processes it is advantageous to add the solution directly to the hollander or at any other suitable point in the paper-making.<br>
The invention therefore relates also to concentrated aqueous solutions of dyes of formula (1) or (2) which comprise, for example, from 1 to 50 percent by weight, especially from 5 to 40 percent by weight, and preferably from 8 to 30 percent by weight, dye. based on the total weight of the solution.<br>
Concentrated aqueous solutions of dyes of formula (1) or (2) can be prepared, for example, by filtering the dye suspension obtained in the preparation of the dye, subjecting the filtrate, if desired, to desalination, for example by a membrane separation technique, and then stabilising it with an acid, for example formic acid, acetic acid or lactic acid, and by the addition of auxiliaries, such as urea, ε-caprolactam or polyethylene glycol.<br>
The dye solutions so prepared preferably contain from 400 to 900 parts of water, from 0 to 400 parts of an organic carboxylic acid, for example formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid or lactic acid, and from 0 to 200 parts of further additives, such as urea, ε-caprolactam or polyethylene glycol, per 100 parts of dye.<br>
The aqueous concentrates according to the invention, which are stable at storage temperatures of up to -5°C. are suitable for the dyeing of paper, on which they produce attractive red shades.<br>
The dyes of formula (1) or (2) can also be employed for the dyeing of textile materials of cellulose, for example cotton, and for the dyeing of leather and glass fibres.<br><br>
The following Examples serve to illustrate the invention but do not limit the invention thereto. Parts and percentages relate to weight, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Application Example 1:<br>
50 parts of chemically bleached beechwood sulfite pulp are mixed with 50 parts of<br>
bleached pinewood pulp RKN 15 (freeness 22' SR) and 0.2 part of the dye of formula<br><br>
in water (pH 6. water hardness 10° dH [German hardness], temperature 20°, liquor ratio 1:40). After 15 minutes' stirring, sheets of paper are produced on a Frank sheet-former. The paper has been dyed red.<br>
Similar results are obtained if 0.2 parts of the dye of forniula (101) are replaced by the same amount of a dye of formula<br><br><br><br>
Application Example 2: A paper web is produced from bleached beechwood sulfite pulp (22" SR) on a continuous laboratory paper-making machine. Ten seconds before the headbox, an aqueous solution of the dye of formula (101) according to Example 1 is metered continuously into the thin pulp with strong turbulence (0.3 % strength dyeing, liquor ratio 1:400, water hardness 10° dH, pH 6. temperature 20°). A red dyeing is<br><br>
produced on the paper web.<br>
Similar results are obtained if in Application Example 2 the dye of formula (101) is replaced by the dye formula (102). (103), (104), (105), (106), (107) or (108).<br><br>
