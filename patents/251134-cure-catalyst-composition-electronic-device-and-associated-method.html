3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be  performed : -<br><br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The invention includes embodiments that relate to a curable composition and an associated method. The invention includes embodiments that relate to a device incorporating the composition.<br>
Some electronic components may be connected by eutectic tin/lead (Sn/Pb) solder, which has a melting point at about 183 degrees Celsius (°C). It may be desirable to use a lead-free solder rather than the eutectic solder. But, lead-free solder may have a different melting point than the eutectic solder. A possible replacement solder may have a melting point in range of from about 218 degrees Celsius to about 230 degrees Celsius. A higher melting point of the solder may shift peak temperature during a reflow from about 220 degrees Celsius to a new peak in a range of from about 240 degrees Celsius to about 260 degrees Celsius. Commercially available no-flow underfills (NUF) may respond to the higher temperature by initiating an overly fast cure that may restrict solder ball and prevent formation of good electrical connections.<br>
Attempts to produce a catalytic material for an NUF for use with a lead-free solder have been problematic. Problems encountered may include an unacceptable electrical yield. It may be desirable to have a curable composition usable as an underfill material with lead-free solder having improved or different properties.<br>

One or more electrical connections 106 (two illustrated) formed from lead-free solder interconnect the die 102 and the substrate 104. A curable composition (underfill composition/material) 108 occupies at least a portion of a volume 110 defined by inward facing surfaces of the die 102 and the substrate 104. A region 112 is adjacent to an outward facing surface of the die 102, and may be occupied by an optional<br><br><br>
encapsulant material (not shown) such as a thermally conducting interfacial (TIM) material.<br>
A method according to an embodiment of the invention may include disposing a curable, but uncured or only partially cured (e.g., B-staged), underfill material 108 into at least a portion of the volume 110. Subsequently, the underfill material may be cured. And, simultaneously with the curing of the underfill material 108, a lead-free solder ball may be heated to a melt point. In response, the lead-free solder ball may melt and flow to form one or more of the electrical interconnects 106. Accordingly, a cure temperature of the underfill, and the lead-free solder ball melt point, may be within predetermined parameters or respective ranges.<br>

EXAMPLES<br><br><br>
The following examples are intended to illustrate methods and embodiments in accordance with the invention, and as such should not be construed as imposing limitations upon the claims. Unless specified otherwise, all ingredients are commercially available from such common chemical suppliers as Aldrich Chemical Company (Milwaukee, Wisconsin), Air Products (Allentown, Pennsylvania), GE Silicones (Wilton, Connecticut), Resolution Performance Products (Pueblo, Colorado), Dainippon Ink and Chemicals Inc., (Tokyo, Japan), and the like.<br>
EXAMPLE 1: Preparation of a catalyst.<br>
A round bottom 100 milliliters (ml) flask is charged with 5 grams (g) of tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane and 15 ml of anhydrous toluene to form a suspension. The resultant suspension is stirred for 5 minutes at room temperature (25 degrees Celsius) to form a reaction mixture. Subsequently, 0.8 Ig of n-methylimidazole in 5 ml of anhydrous toluene is added drop-wise to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture is transparent after the complete addition of n-methylimidazole. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for an additional hour. Formation of white solids is observed after about 5 minutes of stirring. Subsequently, 30 ml of hexane is added to the reaction mixture and the flask is left in the refrigerator overnight. The next day, the white solid is filtered and dried under vacuum to yield 4.33 g of a product complex. The structure of the complex is confirmed by *H, 13C and 19F NMR.<br>
EXAMPLE 2: Preparation of a curable composition.<br>
A first resin (RSL-1739) and a second resin (EXA-4700), both epoxy-based, are blended together at room temperature with 4-methyl-hexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA), glycerol and 5,5'- (1,1,3,3,5,- hexamethyl -1,5- trisiloxane diyl) bis [hexahydro -4,7- methanoisobenzofuran -1,3- dione] (TriSNBA) to form a mixture. The resulting mixture is blended for 30 minutes at room temperature. A catalyst (POLYCAT SA-I or a catalyst according to an embodiment of the invention) and optional additives as set forth in the Tables below are added to the mixture to produce a formulation. The formulation is mixed at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes and is degassed at room temperature for at least 30 minutes to form a curable composition. The resultant curable compositions are stored at minus 40 degrees Celsius.<br>
Heat of reaction, onset of cure, cure peak temperature and glass transition temperature (Tg) are determined by non-isothermal DSC experiments performed with Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) TA Instruments Q1000 system. Differential Scanning Calorimetery (DSC) is used to control curing kinetics of the curable composition. Approximately 10 milligrams (mg) of each curable composition<br><br><br>
is sealed in an individual aluminum hermetically sealable pan. Each sample and pan is heated at a rate of 30 degrees Celsius/minute from room temperature to 300 degrees Celsius and then cooled. The heat flow during the curing is recorded. The glass transition temperature is determined based on the second heating cycle of the same curable composition.<br>
Determination of fluxing capability:<br>
The solder fluxing test is performed using cleaned copper-laminated FR-4 board. A portion (0.2 g) of the curable composition is dispensed on the copper laminate and few lead free solder balls are placed inside the drop. Subsequently, the drop is covered with glass slide and the copper plate is passed through a reflow oven at a peak temperature of 260 degrees Celsius. The solder balls spread and coalescence is examined under optical microscope.<br>
Procedure for assembly and testing:<br>
Standard FR-4 and high Tg/low CTE FR-4 boards are used for assembly and have electrolytic nickel with a gold flash layer surface finish. The bond pads on both test boards are defined by a rectangular trench etched out of the solder mask (Taiyo/PSR 4000). A controlled amount of curable composition is dispensed using a 22-gauge needle (EFD Inc) in a dot/line pattern in the center of the component footprint area to test boards previously baked out at temperatures ranging from 150 degrees to 220 Celsius for a time ranging from 20 minutes up to 2 hours. The flip chip die is placed using an MRSI 505 automatic pick and place machine with a placement force of 150 grams and placement head dwell time of 500 milliseconds. Reflow of these test vehicles is carried out using a ZEPHER convection reflow oven using a lead free profile with a soak zone and peak temperature in a range of from about 250 degrees Celsius to about 260 degrees Celsius. A post cure step of 1 hour at 160 degrees Celsius after reflow is necessary to complete the curing step. The assembled flip-chip is subjected to Air-to-Air Thermal Shock (AATS) (minus 55 degrees Celsius to plus 150 degrees Celsius) for 1000 cycles (dwell time: 10 minutes at each extreme). The curable compositions are monitored for cracking and for electrical continuity through thermal shock testing.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 THROUGH EXAMPLE 6 and COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1: Catalyst concentration with regard to cure properties of curable compositions.<br>
In the Examples 3 through 6 and in Comparative Example 1, curable compositions are prepared in a similar manner as described in Example 2, using a single resin and with variations in the weight percent of a catalyst (as prepared in Example 1) added as indicated in Table 1 below.<br><br><br>
Table 1: Ingredients for Example 3-6 and Comparative Example 1<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The following scale is used to rate the ability of the curable composition to flux and to evaluate the degree of cure of the curable composition.<br>
A.	Fluxing:<br>
1.	No change in the shape of solder balls<br>
2.	Solder starts to collapse<br>
3.	Solder balls are collapsed but do not coalesce.<br>
4.	Solder balls are collapsed and some coalescence is observed.<br>
5.	Solder balls are collapsed and complete coalescence is observed<br>
B.	Degree of Cure:<br>
1.	Viscous fluid after reflow at room temperature<br>
2.	Low viscosity fluid after reflow at elevated temperature, and sticky solid at room temperature<br>
3.	Viscous fluid after reflow at elevated temperature, solid at room temperature<br>
4.	Soft after reflow at elevated temperature, solid at room temperature<br>
5.	Solid after reflow at elevated temperature<br><br><br>
Table 2: Results of Example 3 - 6 and Comparative Example 1.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
A catalyst may be necessary for effective curing. The curable composition achieves minimal curing in the absence of a catalyst. Results tabulated in Table 2 demonstrate that in Example 3 though Example 6 the formulations have acceptable cure characteristics for use in a lead-free solder application.<br>
Fig. 2 is a graph, represented by the reference number 114, showing five curve profiles of viscosity 118 (centipoise) versus time 116 (hours). Each of the five curve profiles corresponds to one of Examples 3-6 or to Comparative Example 1. The results indicate that with the increase in catalyst concentration, there is an increase in the viscosity of the curable composition over time at room temperature. In the absence of a catalyst, there is little or no increase in viscosity over time, as indicated by Curve 120. The larger the concentration of the catalyst, the greater the increase in viscosity over time, as indicated by Curves 122,124,126 and 128.<br>
EXAMPLE 7 AND COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2 - 6: Effect of catalyst concentration on cure properties.<br>
In Example 7 and Comparative Examples 2-6, curable compositions are prepared in a similar manner as described in Example 2, with variations in the weight percent of catalyst (POLYCAT SA-I) as indicated in Table 3. The ratio of EXR4700 to RSL1739 is l to 4.<br>
Table 3: Ingredients for Example 7 and Comparative Example 2-6<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The results in Table 4 indicate that Comparative Example 2 through Comparative Example 6 have acceptable cure characteristics for lead-free application within a relatively narrow range of catalyst concentration. The results indicate also that Comparative Example 2 through Comparative Example 6 require a relatively decreased catalyst quantity compared to Example 7.<br>
Fig. 3 is a graph, represented by reference number 130, showing two curve profiles of heat flow (W/g) 134 versus temperature (degrees Celsius) 132. The onset temperature or curing temperature profile of the curable composition of Example 7<br><br><br>
is indicated as Curve 136. The onset temperature or curing temperature profile of the curable composition of Comparative Example 2 is indicated as Curve 138. The cure temperature of the curable composition of Example 7 may be about the same as a melt point temperature of a lead-free solder material. Further, the onset temperature or curing temperature of the curable composition of Example 7 may be about 30 degrees Celsius higher than the curable composition of Comparative Example 2, which is adapted for use with a lead-containing solder.<br>
EXAMPLE 8 AND COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 7 - Room temperature stability.<br>
In Example 8, the curable composition includes the catalyst of Example 1. Comparative Example 7 includes POLYCAT SA-I as the catalyst. Example 8 and Comparative Example 7 include ingredients in the amounts shown in Table 5. Example 8 and Comparative Example 7 are prepared in a manner similar to that disclosed in Example 2.<br>
Table 5. Ingredients for Example 8 and Comparative Example 7.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The samples are each analyzed through two temperature cycles. The first run captures the heat of cure. The second run provides a baseline for subtracting thermal events unrelated to the cure. Baseline files are subtracted from each run. Indium standards are analyzed to confirm temperature and heat flow calibration of the DSC prior to sample analysis. Indium calibration is within 0.5 degrees Celsius of the expected onset and within 0.2 Joules/gram (J/g) of the expected heat flow.<br>
Fig. 4 is a graph, represented by reference number 140, showing two curve profiles of viscosity 118 versus time 116 at room temperature. Curve 142 indicates the<br><br><br>
viscosity profile for Example 8, and Curve 144 indicates the viscosity profile for Comparative Example 7. Comparison of the Curves 142, 144 demonstrates a relatively greater viscosity increase over time of Comparative Example 7 compared to Example 8. That is, an embodiment according to the invention may have an improved or longer shelf life at room temperature compared to a commercially available material<br>
As shown in Table 6, and with reference to Fig. 4, the results indicate that a curable composition according to an embodiment of the invention has relatively lower viscosity after 8 hours storage at room temperature compared to material using a commercially available catalyst in an amount sufficient to achieve an acceptable cure. Further, to achieve desirable cure properties, Table 5 indicates the catalyst concentration in Comparative Example 7 is decreased relative to the catalyst concentration of Example 8. The catalyst concentration in Comparative Example 7 is sufficiently low to be relatively problematic in metering the catalyst in a require concentration range.<br>
