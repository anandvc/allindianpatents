SPECIFICATION<br>
SECTION 10<br><br><br>
TITLE<br>
"AN OIL EXPELLER"<br><br>
APPLICANT<br>
KALPESH CHANDUBHAI, a0 Indian National of Opposite Ganj Bazar,Visnagar-328 4315, Distt Mahesana, Gujarat. India<br>
The following Specification Particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which is to "be performed.<br><br>
GRANTED<br><br><br>
This invention relates to an oil expeller.<br>
The use of the oil expeller is well established in the prior art. The conventional oil expeller comprises a crusher housed in a housing for crushing the oil seeds fed into the housing at the inlet end thereof from a hopper. The hopper is mounted towards one end of said housing for storing the oil seeds to be crushed therein. Means are provided at the other end of said housing for adjusting the thickness of the cake coming out from the oil expeller. A pulley adapted to be rotated by the motive means is mounted at one end of said crusher for rotation thereof. Screw press mechanism is used in the conventional oil expellers.<br>
There are certain disadvantages associated with the conventional oil expeller.<br>
One of the main disadvantage is that the motive means is either mounted on the foot of the main frame of the oil expeller and a pulley and belt system is used for rotating the crushing shaft of the oil expeller.<br>
Another disadvantage is that a lot of energy loss takes place/occurred during the power transmission.<br><br>
Yet another disadvantage is that the maintenance cost of the conventional oil expeller is very high as a lot wear and tear occurred due to the vibrations caused by the conventional powered transmission means.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that the no means are provided to adjust the thickness of the cake during the operation of the machine.<br>
Therefore the main object of this invention is to propose a      oil expeller able to crush all kind of oil seeds which helps in achieving highest production efficiency by providing improved and energy efficient transmission system in a very compact size.<br>
According to this invention there is provided an oil expeller comprising a plurality of w©rm shaft disposed in the respective crushing chambers, one end of said warm shafts are connected to a motive means through a    power transmission system provided between said shafts and motive means, means are provided towards the outlet ends of said warm shafts for adjusting the thickness  of  the cake, a plurality of  seeds  steaming<br><br><br>
chamber are mounted on the top of the main frame of the<br>
oil expeller for steaming the seeds received from the<br>
respective hopper mounted on the feeding end of said<br>
steaming chambers, a plurality of cramer pipes are<br>
provided at the exit ends of said steaming chambers for<br>
feeding the seeds to the feeding end of said worm shafts<br>
respectively.	<br>
In accordance with this invention the oil expeller of this invention has a plurality of crushing shafts/warm shafts disposed into respective crushing chambers for crushing the oil seeds. A plurality of seeds steaming chambers are mounted on the top of the main frame of said oil expeller for .steaming the seeds received from the respective hoppers mounted on the feeding ends of said steaming chambers. A number of cramer pipes are provided at the exit ends of said steaming chambers for facilitating the feeding of the steamed seeds to the' crushing chambers respectively. One end of said wOrm shafts is connected to a motive means through a planetary gear wheels system provided between said warm shafts and motive means. Means are provided at the exit ends of said shafts for adjusting the thickness of the cake and thus for adjusting the oil contents in the cake.<br><br><br>
An  oil expeller according to a preferred embodiment  is<br>
herein  described  and illustrated in  the  accompanying<br>
drawings wherein	'<br>
Fig.l shows isometric view of the oil expeller.<br>
Fig.2 shows the sectional view of the expeller.<br>
Fig.3 shows the enlarged view of the power transmission<br>
and Fig.4 shows cake thickness adjusting means.<br>
Referring to the drawings particularly fig.l, the oil expeller of this invention has a plurality of w©rm shafts/crushing shafts 9 disposed in the respective crushing chambers 15. Shafts 9 are provided for crushing the steamed oil seeds received from the cramer pipes 13. A plurality of steaming chambers 11 are mounted on the top of the main frame F of the oil expeller for steaming the oil seeds received from the hoppers 10 mounted at the feeding end of the steaming chambers 11. The operating ends of said w©rm shaft 9 are connected with a motive means for example an electric motor 1 through a planetary gear wheel system 3 and motor coupler gear 2 connected with each other. Means    are provided at the exit ends of the crushing <br><br>
chambers 15 for helping and adjusting the formation and thickness of the cake. The planetary gear system 3 as shown in figs. 2 and 3 comprises a torque divided wheel gear 8 connected rotatably with a torque devider gear pinion 7. The torque devider pinion 7 is rotatably connected with a planetary gear wheel 6 which is rotatably mounted on a planetary plate and is rotatably connected with a planetary pinion gear 5. The planetary pinion gear is rotatably connected with a planetary fix gear 4 which is connected to a rotatable planetary gear wheel 3. The rotatable planetary gear 3 is coupled with a motor couple gear 2 rotatably. The motor coupler gear 2 is mounted on the shaft of the motor 1. The torque devider wheel gear 8 is coupled with the wprm shaft 9 such that to rotate the same on either sides. The middle devider shaft is coupled with another torque devider wheel provided at the back side and is not shown in the figures. A steam chamber shaft 12 having movers 12A is provided in each steaming chamber SD as to rotate the oil seeds in the chamber in order to facilitate  the<br><br><br>
steaming action- A. cramer 14 is provided at the lower end of said cramer pipe for transferring the seeds coming from the steam chamber towards the mouth of the crushing chamber. A pulley 13A is provided at the top end of the cramer shaft so as to rotate the cramer 14 with the help of the belt provided to receive the rotation from the said motive means.<br>
Reference  is now made to fig.4 the thickness  adjusting<br>
•means      comprises a cone 16 being provided at the  exit<br>
end  of  the  crushing chamber such that  to  allow  the<br>
passes  of the outer end of the crusher       therethrough<br>
and  to provide a way 20 around it for the exit  of  the<br>
cake  from the crushing chamber.  A jack 17 is  provided<br>
towards the outer end of the cone 16.  A jack gear wheel<br>
18  is  provided  around the jack 17  such  that  to  be<br>
rotated by means of a knob 19 provided to move jack gear<br>
wheel  inwardly and outwardly and thus to  displace  the<br>
cone '16 inwardly and outwardly in order to  adjust  the<br>
thickness  of  the  way  20  and  thus  to   adjust  the<br>
thickness of the cake coming out through the  passes/way<br>
20.  The warm shafts 9 are   rotatably mounted on the main<br>
frame  F of the oil expeller with the help  of  bearings<br>
9A.<br><br><br>
During the operation of the oil expeller the oil seeds are stored in the' hoppers. The oil seeds are then allowed to move into the steaming chambers- The steamed oil seeds are then fed into the cramer pipes and which are then pushed towards the feeding end/mouth of the crushing chambers respectively. The oil seeds are brushing chambers and wherein the oil and ' cake is produced. The oil is poured on to a collection.tray 21A provided at the bottom of the frame F of the oil expeller. The oil collected in the collecting tray 21A is drained out through an oil drain pipe 21 and which is then collected into the drums. The crushers Are rotated by a motive means for example an electric motor and the rotational power is transferred to the crushers with the help of the planetary gear system in the fashion as herein described above directly and thus the loss of energy during the transmission system is eliminated.<br><br>
