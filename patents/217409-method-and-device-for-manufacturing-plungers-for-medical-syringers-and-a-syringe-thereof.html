	Method_and device _for manufacturing plungers for medical<br>
	syringes/ plungers obtained thereby, as well as a syringe<br>
5 	for medical purposes.<br>
	The present invention concerns methods for manufacturing<br>
	plungers for medical syringes, as well as devices applying<br>
	such method and plungers obtained according to said method.<br>
10 	Further, it also concerns different embodiments of<br>
	syringes, in particular syringes with special embodiments<br>
	of plungers,<br>
	In particular, the invention concerns a method for<br>
15 	manufacturing such, plungers out of plastic.<br>
	By syringes should be understood in this case all<br>
	recipients provided, with a piston or plunger with which<br>
	liquid can be sucked up in the recipient and/or can be<br>
20	pressed out of the recipient. Examples thereof are<br>
	injection syringes and dose syringes.<br>
	The above-mentioned plungers, which are designed to be<br>
	pushed in a slidable manner in a usually cylindrical<br>
25 recipient, as is known consist of a longitudinal plunger<br>
	body upon which is fixed a piston body at the front in the<br>
	shape of a head. The plunger body is usually made of a<br>
	relatively hard plastic, whereas the piston body is made of<br>
	a softer material which guarantees a good sealing against<br>
30 	the cylinder wall of the syringe.<br><br>
WO 2004/035289 								P€T/BE2003/000157<br>
-2-<br>
	The above-mentioned parts, the plunger body on the one hand<br>
	and the piston body on the other hand, are traditionally<br>
	made entirely separately, to be subsequently assembled,<br>
	either manually or by means of an assembly machine.<br>
5<br>
	The two aforesaid parts of the known plungers are<br>
	traditionally attached to each other by means of a sort of<br>
	snap-in system, in particular by means of collars meshing<br>
	behind one another, such that the piston body can be<br>
10 pressed down on the far end of the plunger body.<br>
	As, according to the known technique, the two parts of a<br>
	plunger are manufactured separately and have to be<br>
	subsequently assembled, this technique is relatively<br>
15 complicated, time-consuming and expensive. There is also a<br>
	chance that the parts do not perfectly mesh during the<br>
	assembly, so that problems may arise at a later stage, when<br>
	the plunger is pushed in the cylindrical body of the<br>
	syringe or the like.<br>
20<br>
	According to newer techniques, the two parts of the plunger<br>
	are provided onto each other in a single injection-moulding<br>
	machine, so that no separate mechanical mounting is<br>
	required and the above-mentioned disadvantages are<br>
25 	excluded.<br>
	A first example thereof is known from EP 1.099.449. The<br>
	plunges body is hereby first injection-moulded out of hard<br>
	plastic in a mould impression, after which a piston body<br>
30	made of a softer plastic is then formed on the plunger body<br>
	by enlarging said mould impression near the front end of<br><br>
	WO 2004/035289 							PCT/BE2003/00157<br>
-3-<br>
	the formed plunger body and by then injecting the softer<br>
	plastic in the space which has thus become available.<br>
	In order to be able to enlarge the above-mentioned mould.<br>
5. 	impression, the mould is provided with a sliding part. A<br>
	disadvantage of the use of such a sliding part consists in<br>
	that a sub edge may be created on the front side of the<br>
	formed piston body at the transition between said sliding<br>
	part and the surrounding mould parts , which is undersirable<br>
10	in medical applications since, at the height of said sub<br>
	edge, material particles may come off and thus end in<br>
	the reservoir of the syringe, and thus also in the medical<br>
	liquid to be injected.<br>
15	The injection of the plastic For forming the piston body is<br>
	not simple either in this case. According to a first known<br>
	possibility, the plastic may be injected laterally, which<br>
	results in gate points being created in the side wall of<br>
	the piston body, which is not desirable in practice.<br>
20	According to a second known possibility, the injection<br>
	takes place through a supply duct formed, in the plunger<br>
	body. This prevents the formation of gate points on the<br>
	front side or side wall of the piston body, but a<br>
	disadvantage consists in that rather complex additional<br>
25	means are required to form such a supply duct through the<br>
	plunger body.<br>
A	second example is known from US 5.902.276, whereby a<br>
	plunger body is formed in a first mould and a thin layer of<br>
30	soft plastic is subsequently provided in a second mould<br>
	over the front end of said plunger body, in order to thus<br><br>
	WO 2004/035289 							PCT/BE2003/O00157<br>
-4-<br>
	realise a piston body. The soft plastic is hereby injected<br>
	via the back side of the piston body to be formed.<br>
	However, a disadvantage hereby is that the presence of the<br>
	already formed plunger body leaves little room to provide a<br>
5	nozzle in an efficient manner. Also, several nozzles per<br>
	piston body have to be provided in order to make sure that<br>
	the plastic spreads sufficiently through the mould<br>
	impression. Also, the devices required to this end are<br>
	relatively complex.<br>
10<br>
	The present invention in general aims a method for<br>
	manufacturing plungers for medical syringes out of plastic<br>
	which is new and offers several advantages as such, such as<br>
	for example an efficient manufacturing. Also, it aims a<br>
15	method which makes it possible to exclude the disadvantages<br>
	of the above-mentioned known methods, at least when certain<br>
	preferred embodiments are applied.<br>
	To this end, according to a first aspect, it concerns <br>
20	method for manufacturing plungers for medical syringes,<br>
	whereby such a plunger consists of at least two parts,<br>
	namely a longitudinal plunger body made of plastic and a<br>
	piston body provided, at the front end of the plunger body<br>
	which consists of a plastic which is softer than the<br>
25	plastic of the plunger body, characterised in that such a<br>
	plunger is formed by first manufacturing the piston body<br>
	and then the plunger body by means of injection moulding,<br>
	whereby the plunger body is injected against the piston,<br>
	body.<br>
30<br><br>
	WO 2004/035289 							PCT/BE2003/000157<br>
-5-<br>
	Since, of each plunger the piston body is formed first, and<br>
	then the plunger body, the liquid plastic for forming the<br>
	plunger body is pressed against the supple plastic of the<br>
	already formed priston body, as a result of which this<br>
5	supple plastic is pressed in somewhat elastically, so that<br>
	a particularly tight fit of the piston body on the plunger<br>
	body is obtained, in the end.<br>
	By first forming the piston body and then the plunger body,<br>
10	this also offers the advantage that the plastic for the<br>
	piston body can be easily provided via the side of the<br>
	mould Impression which is meant to form the back side of<br>
	the piston body. In this manner, the formation of flash<br>
	lines and gate points on the piston body can be easily<br>
15	excluded without any relatively complicated constructions<br>
	for the supply of plastic being required Hence, the<br>
	piston body will preferably be formed such that its front<br>
	side and side wall are entirely free of flash lines and/or<br>
	gate points for the plastic.<br>
20<br>
	In particular, the piston body is preferably formed in a<br>
	mould, impression whose walls, which connect to the front<br>
	side and the side wall of the piston body to be formed, are<br>
	part of one and the same undivided mould part.<br>
25<br>
	The plastic for forming the piston body is preferably<br>
	provided via the back side of the piston body to be formed<br>
	in the mould impression concerned, possibly centrally, such<br>
	that an even spread of the plastic in the mould impression<br>
30	is promoted. Moreover/ a single nozzle may then be<br>
	sufficient for the infection of said plastic.<br><br>
	WO 2004-035289 							PCT/BE2003/000157<br>
-6-<br>
	As the piston body is formed first and this piston body<br>
	consists of an elastically bendable material, this offers<br>
	the advantage that the piston body, even when it has an<br>
5	inwardly directed collar and/or a part defining a counter<br>
	draft, can be easily taken out of the mould, simply by<br>
	pulling the mould part concerned loose, from. behind said<br>
	collar or out of the counter draft.<br>
10	What precedes does not exclude, however, that according to<br>
	another preferred embodiment, the piston body and the<br>
	plunger body are connected to each other merely by the<br>
	adhesion between the plastics out of which they are made,<br>
	in particular without any parts meshing behind each other,.<br>
15	counter drafts and the like thereby being realised. For,<br>
	by making use of suitable plastics, for example the types<br>
	of plastic mentioned hereafter, it is possible to obtain an<br>
	adhesion which is sufficiently large without any explicit<br>
	mechanical lock in the shape of meshing parts being<br>
20	required. This offers as an advantage that the mould for<br>
	forming the piston body can be opened effortlessly, without<br>
	the formed piston body coming out of the mould impression<br>
	in an unwanted manner.<br>
25	According to yet another possibility, use can also be made<br>
	of a folding core, which makes it possible to form inwardly<br>
	directed parts on the piston body. By folding the core<br>
	before it is removed from the formed piston body, it can<br>
	subsequently be removed from said piston body without any<br>
30 	tensile force being exerted on the piston body.<br><br>
	WO 2004/035289 							PCT/BE2003/000157<br>
	According to the most preferred embodiment, the above-<br>
	mentioned method is characterised in that the piston body<br>
	is formed in a first mould impression, after which, said<br>
	piston body, while it is still being held in the first<br>
5	mould impression or a part thereof, is presented to a<br>
	second mould impression in which the plunger body is then<br>
	injected against the piston body by means of injection<br>
	moulding, whereby mould impressions are applied having such<br>
	a shape that the obtained plunger body and piston body are<br>
10	connected to one another thanks to their shape and/or<br>
	thanks to the adhesion between the used plastics. By<br>
	making use of two mould impressions instead of one mould<br>
	impression which is locally enlarged after a first part has<br>
	been moulded, this offers the advantage that the mould<br>
15	parts used thereby for forming the piston body and the<br>
	plunger body respectively can be optimised individually.<br>
	preferably, the method is also characterised in that, while<br>
	a plunger body is being formed connected to a piston body,<br>
20	a subsequent piston body is formed simultaneously by means<br>
	ox the same nozzle with. Which the first piston body is<br>
	realised, but in another mould impression. This allows for<br>
	an efficient production whereby, during each injection<br>
	cycle, a piston body as well as a plunger body are formed.<br>
25<br>
	The piston body is preferably formed in a mould with mould<br>
	parts whose partial surface mainly coincides with the back<br>
	side Of the piston body to be formed or extends parallel<br>
	thereto. This makes it possible, after the piston body has<br>
30	been formed/ to simply present the mould, part in which the<br>
	piston body is provided with the side defining the above-<br><br>
	WO 2004/035289 							PCT/BE2003/000157<br>
-8-<br>
	mentioned partial surface against the mould parts in which<br>
	the plunger body is formed, without any complex movements<br>
	of the mould parts being required.<br>
5 	The piston body is preferably made of a thermoplastic<br>
	elastomer, while the plunger body is made of polypropylene<br>
	or the like -<br>
	It should be noted that the invention also concerns<br>
10	embodiments whereby not the entire plunger body is injected<br>
	against the piston body, but merely a part of this plunger<br>
	body is injected against the piston body, after which the<br>
	obtained part, formed of the aforesaid part and the piston<br>
	body, are connected afterwards to a second, individually<br>
15	manufactured part of the plunger body, for example via a<br>
	mechanical coupling between both parts. The above-<br>
	as rationed part which, is injected against the piston body is<br>
	preferably made in the shape of an insert which makes it<br>
	possible to make a connection to the rest of the plunger<br>
20	body at a later stage, as mentioned above. By an insert is<br>
	meant that the above-mentioned part is only limited in size<br>
	and has been mainly designed to form a connection with the<br>
	piston body on the one hand, by means of embedment, and to<br>
	form a part which can be easily connected to the rest of<br>
25	the plunger body as such on the other hand, for example by<br>
	means of a mechanical coupling.<br>
	According to a special embodiment, when realising such a<br>
	plunger or a part thereof, also an accessory is formed<br>
30	situated on the front side of the piston body, and which<br>
	consists of a material which is different from the material<br><br>
	WO 2OO4/O35289 							PCT/BE2003/000157<br>
	of the piston body. Such an accessory can be of any nature<br>
	whatsoever. A number of examples will be illustrated<br>
	hereafter. As such an accessory is made of a separate<br>
	material, this offers the advantage that its material<br>
5	selection can be optimised as a function of the purpose of<br>
	such an accessory. The material of the accessory will<br>
	preferably consist of a plastic which is harder than the<br>
	plastic out of which the piston body is formed.<br>
10	By an 'accessory which is situated on the front side of the<br>
	piston body' is meant every part which is accessible via<br>
	the front side of the piston body.<br>
	According to a first possibility, the above-mentioned.<br>
15	accessory consists of a part which extends frontally from<br>
	the front side of the piston body and which, when the<br>
	plunger is situated in the syringe, can at least partially<br>
	penetrate in the outlet of the syringe, which makes it<br>
	possible to optimally empty the syringe. The use of such a<br>
20	protruding part is known as such, but not that it is made<br>
	of a different material, in particular another plastic than<br>
	the one out of which the piston body is formed. By making<br>
	use of different materials is thus obtained that<br>
	independent material selections can be made whereby, when<br>
25	the material of the piston body is selected, an<br>
	optimisation of the sealing can be aimed at, whereas when<br>
	the material of the protruding part is selected, an<br>
	optimisation can be aimed at for this part in order to make<br>
	it function optionally. Thus, for example, by selecting a<br>
30	harder plastic, the protruding part can be made rattier<br><br>
	WO 2004/035289 							PCT/BE20O3/000157<br>
-10-<br>
	rigid, as a result of which it cannot bend and. will not be<br>
	situated exactly in front of the outlet.<br>
	According to another possibility, the above-mentioned<br>
5	accessory consists of a part which makes it possible to<br>
	create a passage between the front side and the rear side<br>
	of the piston body when emptying the syringe, in order to<br>
	prevent "the syringe being re-used, as a result of which,<br>
	what is called a safety syringe is obtained-<br>
1O<br>
	The above—mentioned accessory is preferably made In one; of-<br>
	the following shapes:<br>
		— as a part which is made in one piece with the plunger<br>
		body or a part thereof, and which is thus formed<br>
15		simultaneously with the latter during the injection<br>
		moulding, which offers the advantage that the<br>
		accessory always remains perfectly aligned, for<br>
		example remains axially aligned, and that no separate<br>
		injection moulding cycle is required to form the<br>
20		accessory;<br>
		— as a separate part provided on the front side of the<br>
		piston body;<br>
		— as a separate part provided on the front side of the<br>
		piston body, whereby this part is injected, against the<br>
25		material of the piston body after the piston body has<br>
		been formed, which offers the advantage that no liquid<br>
		can leak away between both plastics.<br>
	It should be noted that the invention can also be used for<br>
30	realising short plungers, in particular plungers of the<br>
	type designed to co-operate with a drive element. In<br><br>
	WO 2004/035289 							PCT/BE2003/000l57<br>
-11-<br>
	practice, such plungers are used for example in syringes or<br>
	the like to slowly administer medical substances to a<br>
	patient, in a dosed manner by means of a pump. Such a<br>
	syringe is then connected to the patient via a catheter.<br>
5	The plunger is connected to an automatically driven drive<br>
	element of the pump, which moves very slowly when in use.<br>
	Also, taking info account what precedes, the present<br>
	invention, according to a second aspect, provides for a<br>
10.	method as described above, characterised in that, instead<br>
	o£ being used to manufacture plungers with a longitudinal<br>
	plunger body, it is used to manufacture plungers of the<br>
	type which is meant to be used in combination with a drive<br>
	element, whereby such a plunger then mainly consists of a<br>
15	piston body and a plunger part, whereby this plunger; part<br>
	is fit to co-operate with, such a drive element.<br>
	It should also be noted that the characteristic in that a<br>
	part is formed at the height of the piston body which<br>
20	protrudes frontally from the front side, of the piston body<br>
	and which, when the plunger is situated in the syringe, can<br>
	penetrate at least partially in the outlet of the syringe,<br>
	whereby this part and the piston body are formed of<br>
	materials, in particular plastics which are injected<br>
25	against one another, is advantageous when the piston body<br>
	is moulded first and then the protruding part, as well as<br>
	when the protruding part is moulded first and then the<br>
	piston body. Fox, in both cases, the above-mentioned<br>
	advantages remain applicable.<br>
30<br><br>
	WO 2004/035289 							PCT/BE2003/000157<br>
-12-<br>
	Taking into account what precedes, the present invention,<br>
	according to a third aspect, also provides for a method for<br>
	manufacturing plungers for medical syringes comprising aL<br>
	least a piston body, characterised in that, at the piston<br>
5	body, a part is formed which protrudes frontally from the<br>
	front side of the piston body, and which, when the plunger<br>
	is situated in the syringe, can penetrate at least<br>
	partially in the outlet of the syringe, whereby this part<br>
	is formed of a material which differs from, and is<br>
10	preferably harder than the material of the piston body, and<br>
	wthereby the piston body on the one hand and said, protruding<br>
	part on the other hand are injected against one another,<br>
	whereby the above-mentioned part is either or not made in<br>
	one piece with a pLunger body belonging to the plunger.<br>
15<br>
	According to a fourth aspect, the invention concerns a<br>
	device for the application of the method according to the<br>
	first and second aspect, characterised in that it at least<br>
	consists of a number of mould parts which at least define a<br>
20	first mould impression and a second mould impression to<br>

	According to the invention, the present device may have<br>
	some more special additional characteristics, as explained<br>
	in the following description and as described in the<br>
	accompanying claims, which characteristics can be either or<br>
5	not combined.<br>
	It is clear that also devices which make it possible to<br>
	realise the methods according to the aforesaid third, aspect<br>
	fall within the scope of the invention. Its construction,<br>
10	taking the description of the method as a basis. Ijes<br>
	within the scope of the knowledge of any craftsman.<br>
	Naturally, the invention also concerns plungers, as well as<br>
	parts of plungers, made according to the preceding method,<br>
15	as well as syringes that are equipped with such plungers.<br>
	Finally, it should be noted that also the fact that the<br>
	above-mentioned part protruding from the piston body<br>
	consists of another material than the piston body itself,<br>
20	is advantageous as such and offers several of the above-<br>
	mentioned advantages, irrespective of whether this part has<br>
	been formed by forming it together with the piston body in<br>
	two successive injection moulding cycles, or in any other<br>
	way whatsoever, for example made separately to be<br>
25	subsequently connected to the piston body in a mechanical<br>
	manner.<br>
	Taking into account what precedes, the invention also<br>
	concerns a syringe for medical purposes, according to a<br>
30	fifth aspect, comprising at least a cylinder body with an<br>
	outlet which is formed of a narrowed outlet part, as well<br><br>
	WO 2004/035289 							PCT/BE2003/000l57<br>
-14-<br>
	as a plunger working in conjunction with the cylinder body<br>
	which is provided with a piston body and a plunger body,<br>
	characterised in that the plunger comprises a part which<br>
	protrudes frontally from tne front side of the piston body<br>
5	and which can penetrate at least partially in the above-<br>
	mentioned outlet part, whereby this part is formed of a<br>
	material which is different from the material of the piston<br>
	body, and. preferably consists of a plastic which is harder<br>
	than the material out of which the piston body is formed.<br>
10<br>
	In this case also, the part which protrudes frontally from<br>
	the front side of the piston body, can be made according to<br>
	either of the following two possibilities:<br>
		- as a part which, is made in one piece with the plunger<br>
15		body or made in one piece with a part of this plunger<br>
		body<br>
		- as a separate part provided at the piston body.<br>

	A plastic syringe 1, as is used for medical applications,<br>
25	mainly consists, as is represented in figure 1, of a<br>
	recipient, in this case a cylinder 2 and a plunger 3.<br>
	As is represented in greater detail in figures 2 and 3, the<br>
	plunger 3 is composed of a plunger body 4 and a piston bociy<br>
30	5, which in the given embodiment have such a shape that<br>
	they mesh and as stich remain coupled.<br><br>

	As is represented, the plunger body 4, which normally<br>
	consists of a relatively hard. plastic, for example<br>
	polypropylener preferably has a cross-shaped shaft 6<br>
5	provided- with a collar 7 on one far end.<br>
	The above-mentioned piston body 5, which is preferably made<br>
	of a soft material, such as thermoplastic elastomer, is<br>
	made in the shape of a head and is provided with an<br>
10	excavation 9 on the rear side 8 which is partially<br>
	confined by an inwardly directed collar 10, which co-<br>
	operates with the collar 7 of the plunger body 4 .<br>
	The invention aims a method and a device for manufacturing<br>
15	plungers 3, or at least plungers of a srmilar type, in<br>
	other words plungers 3 which consist of a plunger body 4<br>
	and a piston body 5 of different plastics. In order to<br>
	illustrate the method, the construction of a preferred<br>
	embodiment of a device 11 applied thereby, in particular a<br>
20	combined injection mould, is first described hereafter by<br>
	means of figures 4 to 6.<br>
	The device 11 comprises a number of mould parts, in this<br>
	case four, 12-13-14-15 respectively, defining `first' mould.<br>
25	impressions 16 and a 'second' mould impression 17, for<br>
	forming a first part of the plunger 3, namely the pistor;<br>
	body 5, and a second part of the plunger 3, namely the<br>
	plunger body 4 respectively.<br>
30 The mould parts 12-13-14-15 together form three parts. 18-<br>
	13-20 Which can be mutually moved.<br><br>

	The first part 18 is formed of the mould parts 12 and 14<br>
	which are mounted on a common support 21 which is<br>
	preferably fixed.<br>
5<br>
	The second part 19 is formed of the mould part 15 which is<br>
	mounted on a support 22. This second part 19 can make a<br>
	translation movement T1 in relation to the first part 18.<br>
10	The third part 20 is formed of the mould part 13, which is<br>
	mainly square and movable/ in particular is provided in an<br>
	extending and rotatable manner on the support 22.<br>
	The first mould impressions 16 are formed of cavities 23A-<br>
15	23B-23C-23D provided on the surface of the mould part 13,<br>
	in this case on each of the four sides thereof<br>
	respectively, as well as of the wall part 24 of the mould<br>
	part 12 with which the cavity which is turned towards this<br>
	wall part 24 can be sealed. On the wall part 24 is<br>
20	provided a protruding part 25 which is designed to form the<br>
	excavation 9, and which is provided, with a recess 25A which<br>
	is confined by a collar 25B.<br>
	Hereby is obtained that the partial surface between the<br>
25	mould parts 12 and 13 coincides with the rear side 8 of the<br>
	piston body 5 to be formed,<br>
	By means of the translation movement T1, the mould<br>
	impression 16 can be opened, sealed respectively.<br>

	The second mould impression 17 is mainly formed of the<br>
	cavities 26 and 27 provided the the surface of the mould<br>
	parts 14 and 15 respectively. These cavities 26 and 27<br>
	hereby open into sides 28 and 29 as well as into sides 30<br>
5	and 31 standing at right angles thereto.<br>
	Further, these cavities 26 and 27 are situated such, that<br>
	the mould impression 17 formed thereby, when the whole is<br>
	closed, connects to the cavity 23B._ The longitudinal axes<br>
10	of the mould impression 17 and the mould impression 16, in<br>
	particular the cavity 23Bf are tvareby situated in each<br>
	other's prolongation.<br>
	The mould parts 14 and 15 can also be moved towards one<br>
15	another and away from one another the means of the<br>
	translation movement Tl. Further, the mould part 13 can<br>
	make a translation movement T2 as well as a rotational<br>
	movement R.<br>
20	In order to realise the movements Tl, T2 and R, the device<br>
	11 is provided with a motion mechanism, consisting of<br>
	drives which can move the three parts 18-19-20 in relation<br>
	to one another, as will be further described, which are not<br>
	represented for clarity' s sake. It should be poted that<br>
25	the mould part 13 can also make a translation movement 13<br>
	in relation to the support 22 which has to make it possible<br>
	for the mould part 13 to freely rotate.<br>
	For the rotation, use is made of a rotating indexing<br>
30	mechanism 32, whose axis of rotation 33 has a direction<br>
	which is different from the direction or directions of<br><br>
	WO 2004/035289 							PCT/BE2003/000157<br>
-19 -<br>
	movement according to which the mould parts 12-13 and 14-15<br>
	open and close.<br>
	It should be noted that, as represented in the figures, the<br>
5	mould, parts 12-13-14-15 together- define three partial<br>
	surfaces in other words surfaces whose composed mould<br>
	opens and closes, which are situated in a stepped manner in<br>
	relation to one another. This stepped construction allows<br>
	for a compact construction.<br>
10<br>
	Further, the device 11 comprises injection means for<br>
	supplying the plastic to be injected to the aforesaid, mould<br>
	impressions respectively which consist of nozzles 33—35<br>
	provided in the fixed part 18 and which preferably have<br>
15	parallel longitudinal axes, and which also open in parallel<br>
	partial surfaces.<br>
	Moreover, the nozzle 34 extends centrally through the<br>
	protrvitiing part 25 <br>
20<br>
	The working of the device 11, as well as the accompanying<br>
	method, is described hereafter by means of the different<br>
	positions represented in figures 4 to 8.<br>
25	Figure 4 shows the composed mould when closed. A first<br>
	plastic is hereby provided in the first mould impression 16<br>
	via the nozzle 34, in particular the cavity 23A. In the<br>
	cavity 23B, a piston body 5 formed during a preceding cycle<br>
	is already present.<br>
30<br><br>
	WO 3004/035289 							PC*7BE2fl03/000}57<br>
	In the second mould impression 17 is simultaneously<br>
	injected a second plastic via the noazle 35, whereby this<br>
	plastic not only fills the cavities 26 and 27, but also the<br>
	excavation 9 of the piston body 5 which is presented<br>
5	against it and which is present in the cavity 23B.<br>
	After the piston body 5 in the mould impression 16 and the<br>
	plunger body 3 in the mould impression 17 have cured<br>
	sufficiently, the mould is opened according to the<br>
10	direction Tl, as represented in figure 5, whereby the<br>
	protruding part 25 of the mould part 12 is pulled out of<br>
	the excavation 9 of the piston body 5, while the latter is<br>
	retained in a manner which is not represented in the<br>
	figures. As the piston body 5 is made of supple plastic<br>
15	and is elastically bendable, the protruding part 25 can be<br>
	pulled loose with its edge 25B from behind the supple edge<br>
	10 without any problem.<br>
	Possibly, means which are not represented can be provided<br>
20	which hold the piston body 5 in the mould part 13 while the<br>
	part 25 is being pulled out of the excavation 9, in order<br>
	to prevent the piston body 5 from coming out of the mould<br>
	part 13 as well. Further, use can be made of a folding<br>
	core 25, either or not Combined with such means, such that<br>
25	when, the mould concerned is opened, no or practically no<br>
	tensile forces will be exerted on the piston body 5.<br>
	Figure 6 shows how the mould part 13 is moved according to<br>
	arrow T2, namely parallel to the support 22, as a result of<br>
30	which the piston body 5 is pulled out of the cavity 23B of<br><br>

-21-<br>
	the mould part 13, as this piston body 5 is stuck behind<br>
	the collar 7 of the plunger body 4 with its collar 10 -<br>
	After the plunger 3 has been ejected from the maould, as<br>
5	represented by means of a dot and dash line in figure 6,<br>
	the mould part 13 is pulled out according to arrow 13 and<br>
	then rotated over 90° in the sense of rotation R by means<br>
	of the indexing mechanism 32, as represented in figure 7.<br>
10	Figure 8 shows the composed mould after the mould part 13<br>
	has first been provided against the support 22 according to<br>
	arrow T3.<br>
	Finally, the mould is closed again according to arrows T2<br>
15	and Tl, after which a new piston body 5 and a new plunger<br>
	body 4 are formed, in the maould impressions 16 and L7<br>
	respectively, by injecting plastic-<br>
	Figures 9 and 10 represent a second preferred embodiment of!<br>
20	the device according to the invention, whereby the second<br>
	mould part 13 has two cavities 23E and 23F, and this mould<br>
	part 13 can he rotated along a tilted shaft 33A -which<br>
	extends at an angle of 45° in relation to the longitudinal<br>
	axes of the cavities 23E and 23F-<br>
25<br>
	The use and working of this embodiment is analogous to that<br>
	of the first embodiment, with as a sole difference that the<br>
	mould part 13 is rotated in another manner.<br>
30	It is clear that in both embodiments, the leading idea of<br>
	the method of the invention is applied, i.e. that a piston<br><br>
	WO 2004/035289 							PCT/BE2003/000157<br>
-22-<br>
	body 5 is injected first, and that the plunger body 4 is<br>
	subsequently injected against the latter.<br>
	As represented, the piston body 5 and the plunger body 4<br>
5	are preferably formed in one and the same direction. It is<br>
	clear, however, that this does not exclude that, according<br>
	to a variant, the piston bodies 5 could be formed in a<br>
	first device, could be removed from this device and then be<br>
	provided in a second device to there inject the plunger<br>
10	body 4 against it.<br>
	In order to keep the formed piston bodies 5 with some<br>
	resisting force in the mould impression 16 concerned, the<br>
	side walls can possibly be made with a light counter draft.<br>
25<br>
	Instead of forming a connection with parts meshing behind<br>
	one another, such as the collars 7 and 10, it is also<br>
	possible to mainly or even exclusively base the connection<br>
	on the adhesive force between both plastics. In this case,<br>
20	it is possible to work with, a simple excavation. 9 in the<br>
	piston body 5, which has no inwardly directed part, and the<br>
	plunger body 4 can be simply made with a part reaching into<br>
	the excavation 9,<br>
25	As mentioned in the introduction, the invention also<br>
	concerns embodiments whereby only a part of the plunger 3<br>
	is formed in the above-mentioned injection moulding cycles,<br>
	in particular a part 36 which, as represented in figure 11,<br>
	consists of the piston body 5 and a part 37 of the plunger<br>
30	body 4, whereby this part 37 has the shape of an insert and<br><br>
	WO 2004/035289 							PCT/BE2003/000157<br>
-23-<br>
	is made such that it can be coupled to a second part 38 of<br>
	the plunger body 4 to be produced separately.<br>
	The parts 37 and 38 hereby comprise coupling means which<br>
5	make it possible for these parts to be connected. In the<br>
	embodiment of figure 1, these coupling means are formed of<br>
	threaded parts 39 and 40, which make it possible for the<br>
	parts 37 and 38 to be connected, as represented in figure<br>
	12.<br>
10<br>
	Figure 13 shows that the part 36 can be realised in an<br>
	almost similar manner as the plungers 3 in the device 11 of<br>
	figure 4, The only difference consists in that the shape<br>
	of the mould, parts concerned have to be adjusted to the<br>
15	shape of the part 37 instead of to the shape of the entire<br>
	plunger body 4.<br>
	Figure 13 shows, consistent with figure 4, a device 11 in<br>
	which the piston body 5 is each, time injected first, and<br>
20	subsequently the accompanying part 37 .<br>
	The above-mentioned coupling means between the parts 37 and<br>
	38 can be made in different shapes. Figure 14, for<br>
	example, shows a variant with coupling parts 41-42 which<br>
25	allow for a snap—in connection. Figure 15 shows a variant<br>
	whereby the part 37 is provided with a threaded part 43<br>
	with internal screw thread, and the part 38 is provided<br>
	with a threaded part 44 with outside thread.<br>
30	Figures 16 and 17 represent a special embodimdent of a<br>
	syringe 1 for medical purposes according to the invention.<br><br>
	WO 2004/0335289 							PCT/BE20O3/000157<br>
24<br>
	This syringe 1 comprises at least a cylinder body or a<br>
	cylinder 2 with an outlet 45 which is mainly formed of a<br>
	narrowed outlet part 46 onto which can be fixed, for<br>
	example, a hollow needle 47 or a catheter which is not<br>
5	represented, as well as a plunger 3 working in conjunction<br>
	with the cylinder body 2 which is provided with a plunger<br>
	body 4 and a. piston body 5, What is special hereby is that.<br>
	the plunger 3 has an accessory, in this case a part 48<br>
	which protrudes frontally from the front side of the piston<br>
10	body 5 and which, as represented in figure 17, can<br>
	penetrate at least partially in the above-mentioned outlet<br>
	part 46, whereby this part 48 is formed of a material which<br>
	differs from the material of the piston body 5, and which<br>
	preferably consists of a plastic which is harder than the<br>
15	material out of which the piston body 5 is formed.<br>
	In the example of figures 16 and 17, the part 46 is made in<br>
	one piece with the plunger body 4. According to a variant<br>
	which is not represented, it could also be made in one<br>
20	piece with a part 37 in the shape of a insert.<br>
	The part 48 makes it possible to restrict the amount of<br>
	liquid which remains in the syringe 1 when the syringe is<br>
	used, after the plunger 3 has been entirely pressed in, to<br>
25	a minimum, which is of major importance in the case of very<br>
	expensive medical preparations.<br>
	Figure 18 represents a device 11 with which the plungers 3<br>
	of the syringes 1 in figures 16-17 can be realised, for<br>
