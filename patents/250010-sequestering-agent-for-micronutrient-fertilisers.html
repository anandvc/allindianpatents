PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a composition and method for improving the bioavailability of micronutrients to plants.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Agriculture is a multi-million dollar industry. In order to improve plant growth good fertile soils are required and, in the absence of these, fertilisers are often used in order to facilitate the growth of agricultural crops.<br>
Essential nutrients for plant growth include metal ions, such as Cu, Zn, Mn, etc. which are crucial to various metabolic pathways of plants such as photosynthesis and so forth. Traditional farming methods have resulted in general deficiency of such metal ions in soil and indeed in some areas these metal ions are almost completely absent and this can result in diminished yields and poor plant growth of crops grown in such areas. It is well known that the addition of surplus metal ions to either the soil or plant foliage can help to significantly alleviate such growth deficiencies in agricultural crops. One of the more common ways of delivering the appropriate metal micronutrient has been to form a chelated complex of the metal ion with a synthetic chelate as this maintains the metal ion in a soluble form for ease of application and reduces metal adsorption and fixation in soil.<br>
However, the use of the synthetic chelates, although widely used, has some significant drawbacks such as high cost associated with production and, more recently, concerns over the fact that they are synthetic and may persist in the environment for extended periods of time. Accumulation in soil and waterways due to the recalcitrant nature of synthetic chelates may lead to some negative impact on the environment.<br>
Examples of synthetic chelates include EDTA, EDDHA, DTPA and NTA.<br>
Moreover, EDTA is such an efficient complexor of metal ions that it can compete with the plants for the metal ion, thus resulting in inefficiencies in delivery of the metal ion to the plant.<br><br><br>
In addition to the use of synthetic chelates, it has also been known to use organic acids, such as citrate, as the chelating agent, however, this is found not to be generally acceptable due to inferior stability constants at pH's greater than 7 and the rapid biodegradation of citrate in the soil. Moreover, the use of acids as chelating agents also has a drawback in relation to the corrosive nature of such compounds and the damaging effect that this can have on machinery if inadvertently mixed in high concentrations.<br>
In each of the above cases, the use of synthetic chelates or organic acids have become the standard accepted way of providing micronutrients to plants on the thought that such agents were the best possible and most efficient compounds available. Clearly, with society's changing views on agriculture and in particular a more accepted view of organic agriculture wherein synthetic agricultural compounds are not accepted due to their potential damaging effects along the food chain, there is then a need to develop more acceptable chelating agents for the delivery of micronutrients to plants.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide new metal chelating compounds that are capable of delivering micronutrients to plant crops.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method of providing micronutrients to plants that is significantly more environmentally friendly than those currently in use.<br>
A further problem with the use of EDTA is its inability to biodegrade in the environment. EDTA can be found in many natural waterways and is often found in high concentrations in waste water effluents. Because of its lack of ability to biodegrade, EDTA has been banned in some parts of Europe and indeed other countries may soon follow suit.<br>
A further problem with the use of NT A is that it has carcinogenic properties. Because of its toxicity and inability to biodegrade, NTA has been banned in the United States of America and indeed other countries may soon follow suit.<br><br><br>
It is an object of the present invention to overcome, or at least substantially ameliorate, the disadvantages and shortcomings of the prior art.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description, taking in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein, by way of illustration and example, an embodiment of the present invention is disclosed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION	<br>
The summary of the invention is as follows:<br>
What we have found then is that by employing a compound being a surfactant having the general formula (I) and in particular a surfactant of the general formula (III), being the biosurfactant rhamnolipid, in which the single carboxylate group has the capability of sequestering micronutrient ions such as copper, zinc, manganese, iron etc. This then results in the formation of what is hereinafter referred to as a "lipid soluble" complex wherein the term "lipid soluble" refers to the ability of the chelated or complexed metal to permeate through the plant membranes or cuticle to provide the metal ion to the plant. This then is in contrast to the action of EDTA and other conventionally used chelating agents, which are not generally absorbed by plant roots and indeed are known to compete against the plant roots for the micronutrients present in the rhizosphere, being the zone that surrounds the roots of the plants.<br>
Moreover, when a rhamnolipid or other biologically produced sequestering agent are used, the biodegredation of the sequestering agent is dramatically greater than that of the synthetic chelating agents therefore resulting in less pollution and greater acceptance in the wider community. Additionally, they may also obtain organic registration, thus permitting the use of such agents in organic farms and the like. Conventional synthetic chelating agents cannot be used on organic farms due to the fact that they are synthetically manufactured.<br>
It has also now been discovered that the use of sequestering agents produced from Bacillus bacteria, such as surfactin, also have the ability to sequester or complex with micronutrients such as those previously mentioned and have an increased level of biodegradability compared to that of synthetic complexing agents.<br>
4<br><br>
In addition, it has been discovered that these biosurfactants, having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups, are also able to provide transportation of the micronutrients through the foliage. The hydrophobic leaf cuticle is the main barrier for fertiliser uptake when micronutrients are applied directly to the plant foliage. We have found that rhamnolipid - metal complexes can be absorbed into hydrophobic zones thus transporting micronutrients from an aqueous phase into a lipophilic phase.<br>
According to the present invention, although this should not be seen as limiting the invention in any way, there is provided a method of sequestering micronutrients when used to provide the micronutrients to a plant, which comprises applying to an area of the plant or soil/substrate surrounding the plant an effective amount of a plant fertiliser composition comprising a surfactant capable of forming coordinate bonds with the micronutrients, transporting the micronutrients across a membrane of the plant and releasing the micronutrients for use by the plant.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Having now generally described the invention, a further understanding can be obtained by reference to certain specific examples that are provided herein for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting.<br><br><br>
n-Octanol/Water Partition Coefficients of Zn- Rhamnolipid complexes<br>
«-Octanol/water partition coefficients (Kow) are commonly used to determine whether molecules can partition into hydrophobic (lipid-soluble) phases. Polar molecules, ie metals, generally partition in the water phase. Neutral, lipid soluble organic molecules may partition within the octanol phase according to their Kow. Most conventional chelate complexes (ie ZnEDTA2") partition within the water phase.<br>
The partition coefficient has been defined as:<br>
where C0 and Cw referred to the concentration of Zn in the n-octanol and water phase respectively (Chiou et al. 1977).<br>
The aim of this experiment was to determine whether Zn-Rhamnolipid complexes would partition within the H-octanol phase. Kow's were measured with varying Rhamnolipid concentrations.<br>
Methods<br>
Kow's were determined using the shake-flask method. 20ml of ImM ZnSO4,7H2O solution was mixed with Rhamnolipid biosurfactant in 50ml polyethylene tubes. Final Rhamnolipid concentrations were (mM) 0, 0.1, 0.24, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5. Two millilitres of n-Octanol was added to the solutions before they were shaken end-over-end for 24 hours. Following shaking, 3ml of solution was removed from the water phase and digested in concentrated HNO3 before analysis for total Zn by ICP-OES. The partition coefficient was calculated according to the equation above.<br>
Results<br>
Unlike the Rhamnolipid, EDTA complexes with Zn, Mn and Cu did not partition within the n-octanol phase, as shown in Figure 1. Clearly then the use of Rhamnolipid dramatically facilitates the transfer of the metal ion from the aqueous phase into the octanol phase.<br>
The use of Rhamnolipid to sequester Zn on alkaline and calcareous soils<br><br><br>
The purpose is to determine whether Rhamnolipids would increase the availability of Zn fertiliser to Canola grown on alkaline and calcareous soils. The performance of this ligand was benchmarked against EDTA, the most commonly used chelating agent on alkaline and calcareous soils in Australia.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
A pot experiment was designed to test the availability of Zn to Canola when applied to calcareous and alkaline soils either as ZnSO4.7H2O or sequestered with, Rhamnolipids or EDTA.<br>
Soil samples were collected from field sites known to be Zn responsive at Streaky Bay, South Australia and Birchip, Victoria (Table 1). Topsoils from each location were collected, oven dried and passed through a 2mm sieve. The experimental fertilisers were mixed with 20g of soil, which was banded between l00g of the unfertilised bulk soil. Total nutrient application equated to (g/g soil) P 60, N 27, applied as TGMAP, and Zn 0.2 as ZnS04.7H20. Chelate rates were based on the concentrations required to complex between 75 and 100% of the Zn in the fertiliser solution. Rates varied depending on the equilibrium constant (10gK) and the stoichiometry of the Zn-ligand complexes. GEOCHEM was used to predict the degree of chelation in the EDTA and Rhamnolipid fertiliser solutions. Chelate application rates were (M/g soil) Rhamnolipid 1.25 (75% of Zn complexed), EDTA 0.37 (100% Zn complexed), Experimental controls were chelate free (ZnSO4 only) and chelate and Zn free. Each treatment was replicated four times.<br>
Two pre-germinated Canola seeds (variety Pinnacle) were transferred to each pot. The pots were watered to 9g = 0.5 with deionised water every second day and evaporation was reduced with polyethylene beads, which were spread over the exposed surface of each pot. The plants were grown for 21 days in a controlled environment growth chamber (10 h dark at 15°C, 14 h light at 20°C, 41% humidity) before the shoots were harvested, rinsed, dried, weighed and then digested in concentrated HNO3. Plant digests were analysed for 65Zn by gamma spectroscopy and for total nutrient contents by ICP-OES.<br><br><br>
Analysis of Data<br>
Data for shoot dry weight, shoot nutrient concentrations and Zn fertiliser uptake were analysed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significance between means was determined using the Least Significant Difference (LSD) test.<br>
Results<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
EDTA was ineffective on both the calcareous grey sandy loam from streaky bay and the Sodosol from Birchip, Victoria (Figure 2) (LSD=1.72). This result was not aunexpected, as the efficacy of EDTA is known to decrease with increasing pH (Norvell 1972). Rhamnolipid significantly increased total Zn uptake by canola on both soils (p
The published logK for ZnEDTA is 16.5 whereas the published logK for Zn-rhamnolipid is only 5.9 (Martell and Smith 1974; Ochoa-Loza et al. 2001).<br>
Canola dry matter response to foliar applied Zn<br>
Foliar sprays are commonly used to apply micronutrient fertilisers to growing crops. The leaf cuticle, a hydrophobic waxy layer, represents the major barrier for nutrient absorption by leaves. Previous scientific reviews have shown that lipophilic molecules should, in theory, diffuse across cuticles more readily than charged solutes (Schonherr and Riederer 1989). However, to date, the foliar application of lipophilic fertilisers has not been widely tested. In a previous experiment Zn-Rhamnolipid complexes were found to readily partition within the hydrophobic H-octanol phase, suggesting that these complexes possess lipophilic qualities.<br>
The aim of this experiment was to determine whether Canola shoots would absorb neutral Zn-Rhamnolipid complexes more readily than ZnSO4 or ZnEDTA. Dry matter<br><br>
response in Zn deficient Canola was used as a measure of fertiliser effectiveness because it considers metabolically available Zn, rather than total Zn uptake.<br>
Methods<br>
Pre-germinated Canola seedlings (var. Pinnacle) were grown in Zn free nutrient solution, in a controlled environment growth chamber (10 h dark at 15°C, 14 h light at 20°C, 41% humidity) for three weeks. After 13 days, whole shoots were immersed in ZnSO4.7H2O solutions for five seconds. The solutions contained (M Zn) 10, 100, 1000, and were either complexed with EDTA and Rhamnolipid, or ligand free. EDTA rates were (M) 3.75, 37.5 or 375 and Rhamnolipid rates were (mM) 1, 1.1 or 1.9. Rhamnolipid rates were high enough to ensure a Zn Kow of at least 50 at the highest Zn application rate. Rhamnolipid free solutions contained 0.1% v/v Spreadwet 1000 wetting agent to enhance Zn uptake by reducing the surface tension of the solutions. Wetting agent was not required in the Rhamnolipid solutions because of the surfactant properties of the ligand.<br>
Following shoot immersion, roots were rinsed twice in Zn-free hydroponic solutions to ensure that Zn applied to the surface of shoots did not contaminate the root systems.<br>
After the three-week growth period, plant roots and shoots were harvested, dried and weighed for dry matter production.<br>
Results<br>
As shown in figure 3, Rhamnolipid significantly increased dry matter response to Zn (P
