				<td>CONTROL HOUSING FOR WORK VEHICLE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates generally to work vehicles such as agricultural<br>
tractors. More particularly, the present invention relates to operator controls within<br>
the operator's stations of such vehicles. Specifically, the present invention relates to<br>
housings for such operator controls.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] The problem is that there is a need for a housing that encloses and holds a<br>
control lever such as the electronic power reverser control for an agriculture tractor.<br>
This housing must withstand loads applied to the lever as well as be aesthetically<br>
pleasing. It is desirable to do this with as few parts are possible.<br>
[0003] Any tractor or other work vehicle that has an electronic power reverser will<br>
have a lever/switch that controls the forward/rearward motion of the vehicle. Of the<br>
known power reverser housings, none use a composite material to form both the<br>
aesthetic housing as well as the structural functions.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0004] The present invention has upper and lower housings that together retain the<br>
control lever. These two housing halves are fastened together with a plurality of<br>
fasteners, and other joining techniques. The lever is retained between the two<br>
housing halves without additional fasteners. More particularly, the lever is<br>
"sandwiched" between the two housing halves. As the lever has a load applied to it,<br>
the load is transmitted to the housing halves which, in turn, transmit the load to the<br>
steering column. The housing halves slide on the steering column allowing the<br>
steering column to telescope while maintaining a constant distance from the steering<br>
wheel to the reverser lever. There is also bushing means that prevents the housing<br>
from wearing prematurely as the steering wheel is turned. This differs from the<br>
known prior art in that the electronic power reverser is housed between two<br>
composite parts that provide both the aesthetic and structural functions. The benefit<br>
is that the disclosed system that has fewer parts, is lower cost, and is easier to<br>
assemble than previously known structures. This design is more fully integrated and<br>
has less opportunity for failure than known structures.<br>
[0005] The problem of fastening the upper and lower housing with a system that<br>
transfers load from the operator to the lever, from the lever to the housing, and from<br>
the housing to the steering column, is overcome by using a plurality of fasteners, a<br>
tongue and groove configuration around the perimeter and an interlock feature on<br>
the bosses for the fasteners. There are also contact areas that serve to "sandwich"<br>
the lever in the housing.<br>
[0006] In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the invention to provide a housing<br>
for a control lever assembly.<br>
[0007] Another object of the invention is the provision of a housing for a control<br>
lever assembly that transfers loads from the operator to the lever, from the lever to<br>
the housing, and from the housing to the steering column.<br>
[0008] A further object of the invention is to provide a housing for a control lever<br>
assembly that functions both aesthetically and structurally.<br>
[0009] An additional object of the invention is the provision of a housing for a<br>
control lever assembly that requires fewer parts, is lower in cost and is easier to<br>
assemble than previously known housings.<br>
[0010] The foregoing and other objects of the invention together with the<br>
advantages thereof over the known art which will become apparent from the detailed<br>
specification which follows are attained by an operator control housing for a work<br>
vehicle, the vehicle being equipped with a control lever and a steering column<br>
assembly, the steering column assembly having a steering shaft disposed in a<br>
steering shaft barrel and a steering wheel attached to the steering shaft, the control<br>
housing assembly comprising: a key mounted on the steering shaft barrel; a first<br>
housing half journaled on the steering shaft by way of bushing means and being<br>
retained thereon by at least one retaining means, the first housing half having a<br>
plurality of lever support bolsters and a plurality of fastener bosses; a second<br>
housing half disposed on the steering shaft barrel, the second housing half having a<br>
plurality of lever support bolsters, a keyway and a plurality of fastener bosses; one<br>
of the first or second housing halves having a groove around a peripheral edge<br>
thereof, the other of the first or second housing halves having a tongue around a<br>
peripheral edge thereof; one of the first or second housing halves having a circular<br>
lip at an end of each fastener boss; and, wherein the keyway of the second housing<br>
half engages the key mounted on the steering barrel so that the housing cannot<br>
rotate with respect thereto and the tongue of one housing half matingly engages the<br>
groove of the other housing half, the circular lips of the fastener bosses of one<br>
housing half engage the fastener bosses of the other housing half, the control lever<br>
is sandwiched between the first and second housing halves and is supported therein<br>
by the lever support bolsters of both housing halves so that loads are transmitted<br>
from the control lever to the housing assembly and in turn to the steering column<br>
assembly, the control housing assembly is able to move with the steering shaft and<br>
steering wheel but cannot rotate.<br>
[0011] Other objects of the invention are attained by an agricultural tractor having<br>
an operator's station, a steering column assembly mounted in the operator's station,<br>
the steering column assembly having a steering shaft disposed in a steering shaft<br>
barrel and a steering wheel attached to the steering shaft, the steering column<br>
assembly being adapted to both tilt and telescope, the tractor being further equipped<br>
with a left hand forward-neutral-reverse lever for controlling the forward and reverse<br>
motion of the tractor, the tractor further comprising: a key mounted on the steering<br>
shaft barrel; a first housing half journaled on the steering shaft by way of a bushing<br>
and being retained thereon by at least one retaining ring, the first housing half having<br>
a plurality of lever support bolsters and a plurality of fastener bosses; a second<br><br>
housing half disposed on the steering shaft barrel, the second housing half having a<br>
plurality of iever support bolsters, a keyway and a plurality of fastener bosses; one of<br>
the first or second housing halves having a groove around a peripheral edge thereof,<br>
the other of the first or second housing halves having a tongue around a peripheral<br>
edge thereof; one of the first or second housing halves having a circular lip at an end<br>
of each fastener boss; and, wherein the keyway of the second housing half engages<br>
the key mounted on the steering barrel so that the housing cannot rotate with respect<br>
thereto and the tongue of one housing half matingly engages the groove of the other<br>
housing half, the circular lips of the fastener bosses of one housing half engage the<br>
fastener bosses of the other housing half, the left hand forward-neutral-reverse lever<br>
is sandwiched between the upper and lower housings and is supported therein by<br>
the lever support bolsters of both housing halves so that loads are transmitted from<br>
the left hand forward-neutral-reverse lever to the housing assembly and in turn to the<br>
steering column assembly, the control housing assembly is able to move with the<br>
steering shaft and steering wheel as the steering shaft and steering wheel are<br>
telescoped and tilted but cannot rotate.<br>
[0012] In general, an agricultural tractor or other work vehicle having an operator's<br>
station is described. A steering column assembly is mounted in the operator's<br>
station and has a steering shaft disposed in a steering shaft barrel. The steering<br>
column assembly is adapted to both tilt and telescope. A left hand forward-neutral-<br>

edge thereof. Similarly, one of the first or second housing halves has a circular lip at<br>
an end of each fastener boss. The keyway of the second housing half engages the<br>
key mounted on the steering barrel so that the housing cannot rotate with respect<br>
thereto and the tongue of one housing half matingly engages the groove of the other<br>
housing half, while the circular lips of the fastener bosses of one housing half<br>
engage the fastener bosses of the other housing half. The left hand forward-<br>
neutral-reverse lever is sandwiched between the upper and lower housings and is<br>
supported therein by the lever support bolsters of both housing halves so that loads<br>
are transmitted from the left hand forward-neutral-reverse lever to the housing<br>
assembly and in turn to the steering column assembly. The control housing<br>
assembly is able to move with the steering shaft and steering wheel as the steering<br>
shaft and steering wheel are telescoped and tilted, but cannot rotate.<br>
[0013] To acquaint persons skilled in the art most closely related to the present<br>
invention, one preferred embodiment of the invention that illustrates the best mode<br>
now contemplated for putting the invention into practice is described herein by and<br>
with reference to, the annexed drawings that form a part of the specification. The<br>
exemplary embodiment is described in detail without attempting to show all of the<br>
various forms and modifications in which the invention might be embodied. As such,<br>
the embodiment shown and described herein is illustrative, and as will become<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art, can be modified in numerous ways within the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention-the invention being measured by the appended<br>
claims and not by the details of the specification.<br>

Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
[0025] With reference now to the drawings it can be seen that an operator control<br>
housing assembly according to the invention is designated generally by the numeral<br>
10. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2 the control housing 10 is adapted for mounting on a<br>
steering control assembly 12 in an operator's station of a vehicle. The steering<br>
control assembly 12 generally includes a steering column comprised of a steering<br>
shaft 16 and a steering shaft barrel 18. A steering wheel 20 is mounted to the<br>
steering shaft 16. The steering control assembly 12 is operatively connected, in a<br>
conventional manner, with a steering linkage of the vehicle (not shown). In the<br>
preferred embodiment the steering control assembly 12 is further adapted so that the<br>
steering shaft 16 is slidable with respect to the steering barrel 18 so that the steering<br>
column and wheel 20 are able to be telescoped. The steering column is also<br>
adapted to tilt, as well as telescope, to facilitate entry and egress from the operator<br>
station and to maximize operator comfort during operation of the vehicle. Those<br>
having skill in the art will recognize that the invention is equally applicable to steering<br>
control assemblies that do not tilt and/or telescope.<br>
[0026] As shown in Fig. 2, the control housing 10 generally comprises an upper<br>
housing half 24 and a lower housing half 26. In the preferred embodiment the<br>
control housing assembly 10 houses a left hand forward/neutral/reverse (LH FNR)<br>
lever 28 which controls the forward, neutral, and reverse functions on the vehicle.<br>
Those having skill in the art will recognize that the invention is applicable to a<br>
number of other control levers, knobs or switches and is further applicable to left<br>
hand or right hand configurations. The control housing assembly 10 is assembled<br>
over the steering column and engages a key 30 on the steering shaft barrel 18. As<br>
will be described in more detail as the description continues, the key 30 interacts<br>
with the control housing assembly 10 to prevent relative rotation between the control<br>
housing assembly 10 and the steering column assembly. The control housing<br>
assembly 10 is further adapted to slide up and down on the steering column when<br>
the steering wheel 20 and column assembly are telescoped up and down. Bushing<br>
means 32 is installed into the upper housing 24 and contacts the steering shaft 16.<br>
In the preferred embodiment illustrated the bushing means is a metal bushing, but it<br>
will be recognized that the bushing means 32 could be of another type such as a<br>
bearing or wear ring and could be manufactured from any number of appropriate<br>
materials.<br>
[0027] As shown in Fig. 2, an upper retaining clip 34 and washer 36 keep the<br>
control housing assembly 10 from sliding off the steering shaft 16. The bushing 32<br>
is pressed into the upper housing 24 to prevent the bushing 32 from rotating in the<br>
housing 24. The bushing 32 contacts the upper housing 24 and allows the steering<br>
shaft 16 to rotate, while the control housing assembly 10 does not rotate. A lower<br>
retaining clip 38 keeps the control housing assembly 10 from falling down the<br>
steering column. The upper housing 24 is fixed from moving left, right, fore and aft<br>
by the bushing 32 and steering column combination. It should be noted that other<br>
appropriate retaining means can be used in place of the retaining clips 34 and 38<br>
such as locking nuts, keys or pins etc.<br>
[0028] Fig. 3 illustrates the configuration of the upper housing 24. As can be seen<br><br>
the upper housing 24 generally includes a column mounting portion 40 and a lever<br>
mounting portion 44. The column mounting portion 40 includes a shaft aperture 46<br>
and a bushing journal 48 surrounding the aperture 46. As described above the<br>
bushing 32 is pressed into the bushing journal 48. The lever mounting portion 44 of<br>
the upper housing 24 generally includes a plurality of fastener bosses 50 and a<br>
plurality of lever assembly bolsters 54. A recess 56 is provided in one end of the<br>
upper housing 24 through which the LH FNR lever 28 extends when the housings 24<br>
and 26 are assembled as will be described in more detail below. For reasons which<br>
will become apparent as the description continues, a groove 58 is provided around<br>
the periphery of the upper housing 24. Support webs 60 are provided between the<br>
fastener bosses 50 for additional structural integrity. Similarly, ridges 62 are<br>
provided between the bolsters 54 for support of the LH FNR lever 28 and for<br>
additional structural support.<br>
[0029] Fig. 4 illustrates the configuration of the lower housing 26. Like the upper<br>
housing 24, the lower housing 26 generally includes a column mounting portion 72<br>
and a lever mounting portion 74. The column mounting portion 72 includes a shaft<br>
aperture 76 surrounded by a steering barrel journal 78. For reasons which will be<br>
described below, the steering barrel journal 78 includes a keyway 80. The lever<br>
mounting portion 74 includes a plurality of fastener bosses 84 and a plurality of lever<br>
assembly bolsters 86. A recess 88 is provided in one end of the lower housing 26<br>
through which the LH FNR lever 28 extends when the housings 24 and 26 are<br>
assembled. A tongue 90 is provided around the periphery of the lower housing 26.<br>
The tongue 90 is adapted to matingly engage the groove 58 of the upper housing 24.<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates the tongue and groove mating of the upper 24 and lower 26<br>
housings. Fig. 8 also illustrates the interaction of the fastener bosses 50 of the<br>
upper housing 24 with the fastener bosses 84 of the lower housing 26. As shown<br>
the fastener bosses 84 of the lower housing 26 each include an interlock feature.<br>
The interlock feature comprises a generally circular lip 92 extending upward at the<br>
top of each fastener boss 84 of the lower housing 26. The inside diameter of the<br>
circular lip 92 closely corresponds to the outside diameter of the generally tubular<br>
fastener boss 50 of the upper housing 24. Accordingly when the upper 24 and lower<br>
26 housings are drawn together by thread forming fasteners 96, the ends of the<br>
fastener bosses 50 of the upper housing 24 are captured by the circular lips 92 of the<br>
fastener bosses 84 of the lower housing 26. The interlock feature of the invention<br>
significantly improves the structural integrity of the housing assembly 10 and<br>
facilitates assembly of the housings 24 and 26. Those having skill in the art will<br>
recognize that the tongue 90 can be included on the lower housing 26 as illustrated<br>
while the groove 58 is included on the upper 24 housing or vice versa. Likewise the<br>
circular lips 92 of the fastener bosses could be included on either of the upper 24 or<br>
lower 26 housing halves.<br>
[0030] Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate how the housings are assembled to the steering<br>
column. As shown, the upper housing 24 is joumaled on the steering shaft 16 by<br>
way of the bushing 32. The washer 36 and upper retaining clip 34 prevent the upper<br>
housing 24 from sliding up on the steering shaft 16, while the lower retaining clip 38<br>
prevents the upper housing from falling down the shaft 16. The upper housing 24 is<br>
fixed from moving left, right, fore and aft by the bushing 32 and steering shaft 16<br>
combination. The lower housing 26 is disposed over the steering shaft barrel 18<br>
which is joumaled in the column mounting portion 72 of the lower housing 26. Thus<br>
when the upper housing 24 and lower housing 26 are fastened together and<br>
mounted to the steering column the housing 10 moves up and down with the<br>
steering shaft 16 and relative to the steering barrel 18 as the steering column is<br>
telescoped and tilted. The key 30, mounted on the steering barrel 18, is disposed in<br>
the keyway 80 of the lower housing 26 and thus prevents the housing 10 from<br>
rotating on the steering column. As shown in Fig. 6 the LH FNR lever 28 is<br>
sandwiched between the upper housing 24 and the lower housing 26 and<br>
accordingly moves with the housing 10. Thus the LH FNR lever 28 is always located<br>
at the same position relative to the steering wheel 20 regardless of how the steering<br>
column is tilted or telescoped.<br>
[0031] With reference to Fig. 7 it can be seen that the lower housing 26 contacts<br><br>
the key 30 to prevent rotation, and the lower housing 26 contacts the steering<br>
column barrel 18 to prevent motion fore and aft and side to side. Both of these<br>
contacts are configured such that the control housing assembly 10 can move up and<br>
down.<br>
[0032] Figures 9 and 10 illustrate how the upper housing 24 and lower housing 26<br>
contact the LH FNR lever 28. As can be seen the LH FNR lever 28 is "trapped"<br>
between the upper housing 24 and lower housing 26 with multiple contact points<br>
created by the various lever assembly bolsters 50 and 86 of the upper 24 and lower<br>
26 housings respectively.<br>
[0033] The upper housing 24 and lower housing 26 serve not only the structural<br>
functions of housing and supporting the LH FNR lever 28, but also no further outer<br>
housing or trim is required to serve the aesthetic functions of the housing. Because<br>
the housing 10 is preferably manufactured from a composite material that is both<br>
structurally strong and aesthetically pleasing it is possible to manufacture the<br>
housing 10 with a few number of parts and with less expense than previously known<br>
structures. The structural features of the housing 10 described above, permit loads<br>
applied to the LH FNR lever 28, to be transmitted to the housing 10 and, in turn, to<br>
the steering column.<br>
[0034] The invention described herein is particularly well suited for use with an<br>
agricultural tractor equipped with a LH FNR lever and a tilting and telescoping<br>
steering control assembly in an operator's station thereof, but it will be recognized<br>
that the invention has equal application to other types of vehicles having other types<br>
of control levers, switches, or knobs and different types of steering control assembly<br>
configurations.<br>
[0035] Thus it can be seen that the objects of the invention have been satisfied by<br>
the structure presented above. While in accordance with the patent statutes, only<br>
the best mode and preferred embodiment of the invention has been presented and<br><br>
described in detail, it is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit tne invention to tne<br>
precise form disclosed. Obvious modifications or variations are possible in light of<br>
the above teachings. The embodiment was chosen and described to provide the<br>
best illustration of the principles of the invention and its practical application to<br>
