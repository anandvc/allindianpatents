				<td>This invention relates to an eco-friendly process for the preparation of mixed oxide of iron, nickel, chromium &amp; cobalt useful for the production of value added nickel-ferrous products.<br>
The end product produced by the process of the present invention will be a mixed oxide of iron, nickel, chromium and cobalt. This may be used as raw material for making ferro-nickel and/or stainless steel. The end product may also be used for making soft magnets.<br>
The first commercially known process for the extraction of nickel from lateritic nickel ore was commisioned by the Freeport Sulfur Company. They had access to a huge reserve of lateritic nickel ore containing <l .5 of ni along the northeast coast cuba. process was named as caron after professor delft university netherlands who suggested it in according to this ore is pre-reduccd followed by ammonia-ammonium carbonate leaching. precipitated nico3 from></l>
Though Freeport succeeded in producing nickel under trying conditions, the process was not economically competitive primarily due to poor metal extraction.<br>
Though initial exploits of Freeport Sulfur did not succeed to the extent it was desired to be, they came up with a better process in 1957. Lateritic nickel ore containing nickel 
 <br>
extracted as sull'nde by H2S precipilalion. This is also known as Freeport Moa Bay process.<br>
Moa Bay process has several advantages but the primary constarint is that it is an energy intensive process. Moa Bay project in Cuba was abandoned in 1959 even before the plant was actually operative.<br>
Falconbridge process is an another established process which is relatively recent and where lateritic nickel ore is directly used for making ferro-nickel through reduction roasting followed by electric furnace smelting.<br>
Falconbridge process enjoys certain advantages in its concept as well as regarding the direct relevance of its end product. However, the process is energy intensive.<br>
Given below arc some of the imporatanl known processes for the extraction of nickel from laterilic ores. However, most of them have not yet been commercially exploited.<br>
In patent no. US4125588, 1977, a methodd has been given for the recovery of nickel and magnesia from laleritcs using; Low temperature sulfalion.<br>
In patent no, US 41959865, 1978, a process has been described lor the selective reduction of nickel lateritic ores for the extraction of non-ferrous metals.<br><br>
In patent no. US430I 125, 1977, a melhod has been given for the exlraclion of Ni from pre-reduced laterilic ores with aqueous sull'iiric acid inthe presence of peroxidanls.<br>
In patent no. US4311520, a process has been given for Ihe recovery of nickel, cobalt and manganese from their oxides and silicates.<br>
In patent no. GB2086872A, 1981 acid leaching of lalerilic nickel ores have been described.<br>
Acid leaching of nickel from serpentinic lalerilc ores have been described in palent no. US44I0498, 1980.<br>
A method of liberating nickel and cobalt from laleriles using high pressure acid leaching has been given in patent nos. US454I994, 1983 and US454I868, 1983, US4548794, 1983.<br>
All these processes are essentially extraction processes for nickel and oilier valuable metals from lalcrilic nickel ore. Enrichment of metal values in (he lalerilic ore may be a part of these processes, as normal exlarclion processes are no! commercially viable unless the starling material is enriched to some exlenl. However, il was not possible lo gel explicit access lo. such information . The common enrichment processes include physical bencficiation through floatation, magnetic separation, hand picking etc. Under<br><br>
normal cicumstances these methods have not been round to be very efficient for ores of' very lean nature like lalerilie nickel ore.<br>
Available processes all deal with lalerilie ores having nickel concentration more than 1%. Existing processes arc generally energy intensive processes.<br>
Existing processes generate huge quantity of residues and wastes which are not environment friendly and cause serious disposal problems.<br>
Existing processes arc not operator friendly and involve toxic reagents like hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide etc.<br>
Lalerilie nickel ores, especially (hose of Indian origin, are by nature lean ores. Available processes mostly deal with ores in which nickel content is morethan 1%. India has a huge reserve of latcrUic nickel ores. But unfortunately, the average nickel concentration in that lies between 0.4-0.6%. Presently, there is no available method nationally or internationally lo process nickel ores of such a low grade.<br>
Therefor R&amp;D efforts have been made lo develop a process which can enrich lalerilie nickel ores having nickel content less than 1% and produce less pollution.<br><br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an cco-friendly process for the enrichment of nickel, cobalt and iron contents in lalerilic nickel ores useful for the production of value added nickcli-ferrous products.<br>
Another objective of.the proposed invention is to provide an improved process for the enrichment of nickel, cobalt and iron content of lalerilic nickel ores having nickel concentration less than 1%, whereby making it useful for value added nickcli-ferrous products.<br>
Yel another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the enrichment of nickel, cobalt and iron content of lalerilic nickel ores and thereby reducing environmental pollution and operational hazards.<br>
In the process of the present invention, the metal components of the raw ore are taken in the solution by atmospheric acid leaching using a mineral acids and (races of organic-acids. Latcrilic nickel ores ar basically oxitles of iron where Ni is embedded in the Goelhile structure. Under reducing conditions the dissolution is belter though prior to that opening of the matrix is necessary. HNO3 and H2SO4 help in opening up Ihe matrix. Presence of  H2SO4  causes sulfalion and supplies energy for that  by reacting vvilh waler.<br><br>
The leach liquor contains sulfate, chloride and nitrate solutions of nickel, iron, cobalt and other soluble metals. The iron, nickel and cobalt components are precipitated as corresponding hydroxides using sodium carbonate as a precipitant at pH higher than 10. To complete the precipitation, af pellets of NaOH is added finally. The chemical reactions that take place are,<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The precipitate is heated at 900ºC to make the corresponding oxides. The reactions that take place are,<br>
(Equation Removed)<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an eco-friendly process for the preparation of mixed oxide of iron, nickel, chromium &amp; cobalt useful for the production of value added nickel-ferrous products which comprises:<br>
(a)	leaching lateritic nickel ore with mineral acid such as herein described<br>
and traces of organic acid such as herein described followed by<br>
filtration;<br>
(b)	heating the filtrate obtained in step (a) to boiling, adding neutralising<br>
agent to the boiling filtrate till the pH of the filtrate is in the range of 6-<br>
10 followed by filtration;<br>
(c)	washing the precipitate obtained in step (b) thoroughly with water;<br>
(d)	heating the washed precipitate so obtained in step (c) at a temperature<br>
of 25 to 900°C if required, to get the mixed oxide of iron, nickel,<br>
chromium &amp; cobalt.<br>
According to a feature of the invention, lateritic nickel ores used may be selected from Ni:0.1% and above. Mineral acids used for leaching lateritic nickel ore may be such as H2SO4, HCI, HNO3, H3PO4 singly or in combination thereof. Traces of organic acids used for leaching lateritic nickel ore may be such as oxalic acid, tartaric acid, ascorbic acid singly or in combination thereof.<br>
According to another feature of the invention, for effecting precipitation in The leach liquor, a number of neutralising agents used may be such as Na2CO3, (NH4)2CO3, NH4OH, CaCO3 used singly or in combination thereof. Washed precipitate is heated to a temperature in the range of 25 to 900°C to get the final product.<br><br>
