METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR RECONFIGURING A COMMON CHANNEL<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention relates generally to a mobile communication system<br>
and, more particularly, to reconfigure a common channel for a mobile communication.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating a network structure of a universal mobile<br>
telecommunication system (UMTS), Generally, a UMTS system 10 comprises a user<br>
equipment (UE) 1], a UMTS terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN) 12, and a core<br>
network (CN) 13. Herein, the UE may be a mobile terminal in. general. The UTRAN 12<br>
comprises at least one of radio network sub-systems (RNSs) 13, and each RNS comprises a<br>
radio network controller (RNC) 131 and at least one of Node B 132 which is controlled by<br>
the RNC. The Node B includes at least one cell 133.<br>
[0003] FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating a layer structure of radio interface protocol<br>
in mobile communication system. As shown in FIG. 2, the radio interface protocol<br>
comprises horizontally a physical layer, a data link layer and a network layer. Meanwhile,<br>
the radio interface protocol comprises vertically a user plane for transmitting user data and<br>
a control plane for signaling.<br>
[0004] The protocol layers of FIG. 2 comprises LI (the first layer), L2 (the second<br>
layer) and L3 (the third layer). The layers of FIG 2 correspond to 3 layers from the bottom<br>
according to the open system interconnection (OSI) layer structure.<br><br>
WO 2006/104335	PCT/KR2006/001126<br>
2<br>
[0005] The first layer, i.e., the physical (PHY) layer, provides the higher layer with<br>
information transfer service through physical channels. The PHY layer is connected to the<br>
second layer, i.e., medium access control (MAC) layer, with transport channels and data is<br>
transferred between MAC layer and PHY layer through the transport channels. Meanwhile,<br>
data is transferred between the PHY layers of a transmitting side and the PHY layer of a<br>
receiving side through the PHY channels.<br>
[0006] The MAC layer provides a radio link control (RLC) layer with service<br>
through logical channels. The RLC layer of L2 supports reliable data transmission and may<br>
segment and concatenate service data units (SDUs) transferred from a higher layer.<br>
[0007] A radio resource control (RRC) layer located at the bottom of L3 m the<br>
protocol layers is; defined on the control plane, may control the logical channels, the<br>
transport channels and the physical channels in relation to configuration, reconfiguration<br>
and release of radio bearers (RBs). Herein, the RB means a service supported by L2 for<br>
data transmission between UE and UTRAN. Generally, to set up a RB means a process for<br>
defining a protocol layers and channels for providing a specific service, as well as a process<br>
for configuring parameters and operation, corresponding to the specific service.<br>
[0008] Moreover, the RRC layer may broadcast system information through a<br>
broad control channel (BCCH). The system information regarding a cell is broadcasted to<br>
UEs using at least one of system information block (SIB). If th!e system information is<br>
modified, the UTRAN transmits BCCH modification information to the UEs through a<br>
paging channel (PCH) or a forward access channel (FACH), for the UEs to have the latest<br>
system information.<br><br>
WO 2006/104335	PCT/KR2006/001126<br>
3<br>
[0009] As an example of point-to-multipoint service, multimedia<br>
broadcast/multicast service (MBMS) is explained as follows. The MBMS supplies a<br>
streaming or background service using a MBMS bearer which is set up generally for<br>
downlink transmission. A MBMS service comprises at least one session, MBMS data is<br>
transmitted to UEs using the MBMS bearer during ongoing session, If the UE is activated<br>
corresponding to a service to which the UE have been subscribed, the UE may receive the<br>
service.<br>
[0010] FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating channels for MBMS. The UTRAN provides<br>
UEs with MBMS using a RB. The UTRAN may set up two types of RBs, i.e., a point-to-<br>
point RB and a point-to-multipoint RB. Herein, the point-to-point RB corresponds to a bi-<br>
directional RB. The point-to-point RB employs a dedicated traffic channel (DTCH) as a<br>
logical channel, a dedicated channel (DCH) as a transport channel, and a dedicated physical<br>
channel (DPCH) or a secondary common control physical channel (SCCPCH) as a physical<br>
channel.<br>
[0011] Meanwhile, the point-to-multipoint RB corresponds to a uni-directional RB.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the point-to-multipoint RB may employ the MBMS traffic channel<br>
(MTCH) as a logical channel, the FACH as a transport channel, and the SCCPCH as a<br>
physical channel. The MTCH is configured for each MBMS provided in a cell, is used for<br>
transmission of user data corresponding to a MBMS on the user plane. A MBMS control<br>
channel (MCCH) which is a logical channel is mapped to the FACH, and the transport<br>
channel FACH is mapped to the SCCPCH. In general, one MCCH is allocated to one cell.<br>
[0012] FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating a method for transmitting MCCH<br><br>
WO 2006/104335	PCT/KR2006/001126<br>
4<br>
information through the MCCH. As illustrated in FIG. 4, the MCCH information is<br>
transmitted through MCCH with two types of periods, i.e., modification period and<br>
repetition, period. The MCCH information comprises critical information and non-critical<br>
information. The non-critical information may be modified in the modification period or in<br>
the repetition period. But, the critical information may be modified in the modification<br>
period. That is, the critical information is transmitted (repeatedly) during the modification<br>
period, and modified critical information is transmitted at the start time of the modification<br>
period. The MCCH information means a control message regarding MBMS, and the<br>
control message may be a RRC message. The MCCH information includes modified<br>
service information (MSI), unmodified service information (USI), point-to-multipoint RB<br>
information and access information. Herein, the access information message corresponds to<br>
the non-critical information, and the other information message corresponds to the critical<br>
information. The access information is transmitted per an access period which is equal to or<br>
less than the repetition period. Further, the repetition period may comprise multiple of the<br>
access period.<br>
[0013] If the UTRAN transmits a control message corresponding to a MBMS, the<br>
control message includes a MBMS transmission identity. Herein, the MBMS transmission<br>
identity comprises a MBMS session identity and a MBMS service identity. For example,<br>
when the UTRAN transmits the MBMS MSI message, the MBMS MSI message includes<br>
the MBMS transmission identity and service information corresponding to the MBMS<br>
transmission identity.<br>
[0014] The UTRAN periodically transmits information regarding whether the<br><br>
WO 2006/104335	PCT/KR2006/001126<br>
5<br>
MCCH information is modified, thorough a MBMS notification Indicator channel (MICH).<br>
Therefore, if a UE wants to receive a specific MBMS data but a session of the specific<br>
MBMS doesn't start yet, the UE receives information through a MICH instead of a MCCH<br>
or a MTCH.	;<br>
[0015] The UTRAN may modify the MCCH information by generating, adding,<br>
changing or deleting parameters from the MCCH information. The UTRAN transmits a<br>
MICH message and a MSI message to notify the UE of whether the MCCH information is<br>
going to be modified during the modification period. The MSI message includes at least<br>
one service identity corresponding to each service modified in the modification period, and<br>
information for operating the UE subscribed to the sen-ice. Herein, the service identity may<br>
be a MBMS transmission identity. "The MUMS transmission identity may comprise a<br>
MBMS service identity identifying a service. Also, the MBMS transmission identity may<br>
comprise combination of a MBMS session identity and a MBMS service identity, the<br>
MBMS session identity identifies a service session. A service identity corresponding to a<br>
service not being modified during the modification period, among the services currently<br>
provided in a cell, is transmitted using a USI message. Herein, the service identity may be a<br>
MBMS transmission identity corresponding to the service.<br>
[0016] When a service session of a MBMS starts, the UTRAN transmits, through<br>
the MICH, a notification indicator (NI) notifying UEs of receiving information through the<br>
MCCH. If a UE receives the NI from the UTRAN, the UE is trying to receive the MBMS<br>
data. If a UE receives a NI notifying the service modification through the MICH, the UE<br>
receives the MCCH information during the modification period indicated by the NI. During<br><br>
WO 2006/104335	PCT/KR2006/001126<br>
6<br>
receiving the MCCH information, the UE receives the MSI message, and checks whether<br>
the MBMS is modified. If the UE detects modification of the MBMS, the UE receives<br>
modified MCCH information. Meanwhile, the UE receives the MSI and the USI messages<br>
which are transmitted during the modification period, and may acquire a service list listing<br>
all services currently provided in the cell in the modification period.<br>
[0017] A UE trying to receive a MBMS service using a point-to-multipoint KB<br>
receives MCCH information including RB information through a MCCH, and sets up the<br>
point-to-multipoint RB in itself using the MCCH information. After setting up the point-to-<br>
multipoint RB, the UE receives MBMS data through the physical channel SCCPCH to<br>
which the logical channel MTCH is mapped.<br>
[0018] The UTRAN may transmit the MB MS data through the MTCH. Herein, as<br>
illustrated FIG. 3, the UTRAN transmits a scheduling message to the UE through a MBMS<br>
scheduling channel (MSCH) corresponding to the SCCPCH to which the MTCH is mapped.<br>
The scheduling message includes information regarding a start point and an ending point of<br>
MBMS data transmission in a scheduling period. Therefore, the UTRAN informs the UE of<br>
a transmission period of scheduling information (scheduling period) in advance.<br>
[0019] According to the related art, MCCH information is transmitted to UEs using<br>
the SIB through the BCCH. Therefore, if the MCCH is reconfigured, the UE receives<br>
BCCH modification information through the FACH or the PCH, and receives the SIB<br>
according to the BCCH modification information. Accordingly, the UE may acquire the<br>
MCCH reconfiguration information from the SIB. But, this process for acquiring the<br>
MCCH reconfiguration causes some problem. That is, in such case that the UE receives the<br><br>
WO 2006/104335	PCT/KR2006/001126<br>
7<br>
BCCH reconfiguration information through the PCH, the reconfiguration of the MCCH<br>
may be delayed, because a discontinuous reception cycle (DTX cycle), i.e., a transmission<br>
period of the PCH, is longer than the MCCH modification period.<br>
PISCOLSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0020] Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a channel reconfiguration<br>
method that substantially obviates one or more problems due to limitations and<br>
disadvantages of the related art.<br>
[0021] An object of the present invention is to reconfigure promptly a control<br>

BEST MOPE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0037] Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to<br>
refer to the same or like parts.<br>
[0038] FIG. 5 is a flow chart illustrating a process for reconfiguring a common<br>
channel according to the first embodiment. In the FIG 5, the MCCH is taken as an example<br>
of a common channel, but the method of FIG 5. is applicable to other common channels.<br>
[0039] As illustrated in FIG 5, a UTRAN transmits MCCH configuration<br>
modification information to a UE, during a modification period or a repetition period,<br>
through the MCCH S5I. Herein, the. MCCH configuration modification information may<br>
be transmitted repeatedly per a modification period. The MCCH configuration modification<br>
information includes information related to modification of the MICH configuration,<br>
wherein the MCCH configuration modification information may be transmitted using SIB<br>
through BCCH.<br>
[0040] The MCCH configuration modification information may indicate the SIB<br>
which the UE is to receive, and also include information notifying the modification of a<br>
SIB. The UE may monitors MSI message, and if the UE detect the MCCH configuration<br>
modification information by the MSI message, the UE tries to receive a SIB through the<br>
BCCH, according to the MCCH configuration modification information.<br>
[0041] The UTRAN broadcasts MCCH configuration information using a SIB<br>
which is transmitted through the BCCH S52. Herein, the MCCH configuration information<br><br>
WO 2006/104335	PCT/KR2006/001126<br>
11<br>
includes parameters for reconfiguration of the MCCH. Further, the parameters may include<br>
at least one of a length of MCCH modification period for reconfiguration, a length of a<br>
MCCH repetition period, a length of an access period, a channelization code (for example,<br>
OVSF code or scrambling code) of the SCCPCH to which the MCCH is mapped, a<br>
spreading factor of a physical channel to which the MCCH is mapped, or size of data block<br>
for MCCH transmission.<br>
[0042] Also, the parameters may comprise a start time of the MCCH<br>
reconfiguration. Herein, the start tune may be represented as at least one of a SFN, a CFN,<br>
a modification period index, a repetition period index, and an access period index. Unless<br>
the MCCH configuration information includes the start time, the UK may determine the<br>
start time using the MCCH configuration modification information or a reference time.<br>
Wherein, the reference time corresponds to at least one of the SFN, the CFN, the start time<br>
of the next modification period, a repetition period or an access period. But, if the MCCH<br>
configuration ixiformation includes the start time of the MCCH reconfiguration, the UE<br>
may recognize the MCCH reconfiguration time. Meanwhile, the start time of the MCCH<br>
reconfiguration may be transmitted through the MCCH instead of the BCCH, or be<br>
transmitted by the MCCH configuration modification information.<br>
[0043] The UE receives the MCCH configuration information, and reconfigure the<br>
MCCH according to the parameters S53. The UE receives MCCH information through the<br>
MCCH after the reconfiguration of MCCH S54.<br>
[0044] FIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating a process for reconfiguring a common<br>
channel, according to the second embodiment In the FIG 6, the MCCH is taken as an<br><br>
WO 2006/104335	PCT/KR2006/001126<br>
12<br>
example of a common channel, but the method of FIG 6. is applicable to other common<br>
channels.<br>
[0045] As illustrated in FIG 6, a UTRAN transmits MCCH configuration<br>
modification information to a UE, during a modification period' or a repetition period,<br>
through the MCCH S61. Herein, the MCCH configuration modification information may<br>
be transmitted repeatedly per a modification period.<br>
[0046] The MCCH configuration modification information is transmitted using the<br>
MSI through the MCCH, and the information includes all or part of parameters which are<br>
transmitted using a SIB through the BCCH. Herein, the parameters may include at least one<br>
of a length of MOOR modification period for reconfiguration, a length of a MCCH<br>
repetition period, a length of an access period, a channelization cqde (for example, OVSF<br>
code or scrambling code) of the SCCPCH to which the MCCH is mapped, a spreading<br>
factor (SF) of a physical channel to which the MCCH is mapped, or size of data block for<br>
MCCH transmission.<br>
[0047] Also, the parameters may comprise a start time of the MCCH<br>
reconfiguration. Herein, the start time may be detected by at least one of a SFN, a CFN, a<br>
modification period index, a repetition period index, and an access period index. The UE<br>
monitors periodically the MSI message, receives the MCCH configuration modification<br>
information during a modification period. Unless the MCCH configuration information<br>
include the start time, the UE may determine the start time using at least one of the SFN,<br>
the CFN, the start time of the next modification period, a repetition period or an access<br>
period. But, if the MCCH configuration information includes the start time of the MCCH<br><br>
WO 2006/104335	PCT/KR2006/001126<br>
13	;<br>
reconfiguration, the UE may recognize the time of the MCCH reconfiguration. Meanwhile,<br>
the start time of the MCCH reconfiguration may be transmitted through the MCCH instead<br>
of the BCCH, or be transmitted by the MCCH configuration modification information.<br>
[0048] The UE receives the MCCH configuration information, and reconfigure the<br>
MCCH according to the parameters S62. The UE receives MCCH information through the<br>
MCCH alter the reconfiguration of the MCCH S63.<br>
[0049] FIG. 7 is a diagram illustrating the MCCH reconfiguration time. As shown<br>
in FIG 6, the reconfiguration of MCCH is performed at the end of the first period in which<br>
the MCCH configuration information is received, wherein the end of the fust period<br>
corresponds to the start time of the second period. For example of the MCCH<br>
reconfiguration, supposed that SF of the SCCPCH 1o which the MCCH is mapped is<br>
changed from 128 to 64, the UTRAN transmits the MCCH configuration modification<br>
information,, and then transmits the MCCH configuration information. Thus, the UE may<br>
receive the MCCH configuration information during the first period, and reconfigure the<br>
MCCH at the start time of the second period.<br>
[0050] FIG. 8 is a flow chart illustrating MCCH reconfiguration process in a UE.<br>
The UE receives a MSI message in every modification period S81. And, the UE examines<br>
whether the MCCH configuration modification information is included in the MSI message<br>
S82. If included, the UE determines whether the UE is to receive a SIB through the BCCH<br>
based on the MCCH configuration modification information S83. If the UE determines that<br>
