IMPROVED PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF OXIDIZED<br>
PHOSPHOLIPIDS<br>
FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of synthetic chemistry, and more particularly, to novel synthetic processes useful for the preparation of oxidized phospholipids, derivatives, analogs and salts thereof.<br>
In the art of pharmacology, modified phospholipids are known in many applications. In U.S. Patent No. 5,985,292 compositions for trans-dermal and trans-membranal application incorporating phospholipids bearing lipid-soluble active compounds are disclosed. In U.S. Patent Nos. 6,261,597, 6,017,513 and 4,614,796 phospholipid derivatives incorporated into liposomes and biovectors for drug delivery are disclosed. In U.S. Patent No. 5,660,855 lipid constructs of aminomannose-derivatized cholesterol suitable for targeting smooth muscle cells or tissue, formulated in liposomes, are disclosed. These formulations are aimed at reducing restenosis in arteries, using PTCA procedures.<br>
The use of liposomes for treating atherosclerosis has been further disclosed in the PCT patent application published as WO 95/23592. Therein are disclosed pharmaceutical compositions of unilamellar liposomes that may contain phospholipids. The liposomes disclosed in WO 95/23592 are aimed at optimizing cholesterol efflux from atherosclerotic plaque and are typically non-oxidized phospholipids.<br>
Modified phospholipid derivatives mimicking platelet activation factor (PAF) structures are known to be pharmaceutically active, affecting such functions as vascular permeability, blood pressure and heart function inhibition. In U.S. Patent No. 4,778,912 it is suggested that one group of such derivatives has anti-cancer activity.<br>
In U.S. Patent No. 4,329,302 synthetic 1-0-alkyl ether or 1-0-fatty acyl phosphoglycerides compounds which are lysolechitin derivatives usable in mediating platelet activation are disclosed. In U.S. Patent No. 4,329,302 is disclosed that small chain acylation of lysolechitin gave rise to compounds with platelet activating behavior, as opposed to long-chain acylation, and that the  1-0-alkyl ether are<br>
 <br>
biologically superior to the corresponding 1-0-fatty acyl derivatives in mimicking PAF.<br>
The structural effect of various phospholipids on the biological activity thereof has been investigated by Tokunuira et al. (Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. July 1981, Vol. 219, No. 1) and in U.S. Patent No. 4,827,011, with respect to hypertension,<br>
In Swiss patent CH 642,665 modified phospholipid ether derivatives that may have some physiological effect arc disclosed.<br>
Davies et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 2001, 276:16015) teach the use of oxidized phospholipids as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists.<br>
In U.S. Patent No. 6,838,452 and in WO 04/106486 (which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein), by the present assignee, the preparation of well-defined oxidized phospholipids, as well as other synthetic oxidized LDL (low density lipoprotein) components, is disclosed. The disclosed compounds are reported to be highly effective in treating atherosclerosis and related diseases, as well as autoimmune diseases and inflammatory disorders. It is fiirther reported that the oxidized phospholipid regulate the immune response to oxidized LDL. It is further reported that generally, etherified oxidized phospholipids are superior to comparable esterified oxidized phospholipids as therapeutic agents.<br>
Oxidation of phospholipids occurs in vivo through the action of free radicals and enzymatic reactions abundant in atheromatous plaque. In vitro, preparation of oxidized phospholipids usually involves simple chemical oxidation of a native LDL or LDL phospholipid component. Investigators studying the role of oxidized LDL have employed, for example, ferrous ions and ascorbic acid (Itabe, H., et al., J.Biol. Chem. 1996; 271:33208-217) and copper sulfate (George, J. et al., Atherosclerosis. 1998; 138:147-152; Ameli, S. et al., Arteriosclerosis Thromb Vase Biol 1996; 16:1074-79) to produce oxidized, or mildly oxidized phospholipid molecules similar to those associated with plaque components; Similarly prepared molecules have been shown to be identical to auto-antigens associated with atherogenesis (Watson A.D. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272:13597-607) and able to induce protective antiÂ¬atherogenic immune tolerance (U.S. Patent Application No. 09/806,400 to Shoenfeld et al., filed Sept. 30, 1999) in mice. Similarly, in U.S. Patent No, 5,561,052, a method of producing oxidized lipids and phospholipids using copper sulfate and superoxide<br>
 <br>
dismutase to produce oxidized arachidonic or linoleic acids and oxidized LDL for diagnostic use is disclosed.<br>
The oxidation tecliniques described above for preparing oxidized phospholipids involve reactions that are non-specific and yield a mixture of oxidized products. The non-specificity of the reactions reduces yield, requires a further separation step and raises concern for undesired side effects when the products are integrated in pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
l-Palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-.y/7-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POVPC) and derivatives thereof such as l-palmitoyI-2-glutaroyl-5'n-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PGPC) are representative examples of mildly oxidized esterified phospholipids that have been studied with respect to atherogenesis (see, for example, Boullier et al., J. Biol. Chem.. 2000, 275:9163; Subbanagounder et al., Circulation Research, 1999, pp. 311). The eiYeci of different structural analogs that belong lo thi.s cla.s,s of oxidized phospholipids has also been studied (see, for example, Subbanagounder ct al., Arterioscler. Thromb. Nasc. Biol. 2000, pp. 2248; Leitinger ct al., I'roc. Nat. Ac, Sci. 1999,96:12010).<br>
POVPC is typically prepared by providing a phosplialidyl i liolliui Ijcariiig an unsaturated fatty acid and oxidizing the unsaturated bond of the fatty acid by, e.g., ozonolysis (oxidative cleavage) or using a periodate as an oxidizing agent. Such a synthetic pathway typically involves a multi-step synthesis and requires separation of most of the formed intermediates by means of column chromatography.<br>
As described in U.S. Patent No. 6,838,452 cited above, etherified oxidized phospholipids have been similarly prepared by oxidizing an unsaturated bond of a fatty acid attached to a phospholipid backbone. More particularly, the etherified oxidized phospholipids were prepared, according to the teachings of this patent, by introducing an unsaturated short fatty acid to a glycerolipid, introducing a phosphate moiety to the obtained intermediate and oxidizing the unsaturated bond in the fatty acid chain by means of (i) hydrogen peroxide and formic acid, so as to obtain a diol, followed by potassium periodate, so as to obtain an aldehyde; or (ii) ozonolysis. While the oxidative cleavage of the unsaturated bond results in an aldehyde moiety, other oxidized moieties (e.g., carboxylic acid, acetal, etc.) were obtained by further oxidizing the aldehyde moiety.   Such a multi-step synthetic pathway is oftentimes<br>
 <br>
characterized by relatively low overall yields and again, requires separation of most of the formed intermediates by means of column chromatography.<br>
It has been found that in vivo applications employing esterified oxidized phospholipids prepared as above have the disadvantage of susceptibility to recognition, binding and metabolism of the active component in the body, making dosage and stability after administration an important consideration. Etherified oxidized phospholipids, such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 6,838,452 and in WO 04/106486, exhibit higher biostability and high therapeutic activity.<br>
Thus, the currently known methods of preparing etherified, as well as esterified, oxidized phospholipids involve complex multi-step procedures suitable for laboratory preparation yet rendering industrial scale preparation inefficient and complex. In particular, these multi-step procedures require industrially inapplicable separation techniques such as column chromatography during various stages of the synthetic process.<br>
In view of the beneficial therapeutic activity of oxidized phospholipids in general and of etherified oxidized phospholipids in particular, there is a widely recognized need for and it would be highly advantageous to have an improved process for the preparation of etherified oxidized phospholipids devoid of at least some of the disadvantages of processes known in the art.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is of novel methods of preparing oxidized phospholipids which can be efficiently used for a scaled up production of such oxidized phospholipids. Specifically, the present invention is of novel methods of introducing an oxidized moiety to a compound having a glycerolic backbone and is further of novel methods of introducing a phosphorous-containing moiety to such a compound. The novel methods described herein are devoid of column chromatography and typically use commercially available and environmental friendly reactants.<br>
The principles and operation of the novel synthetic methods according to the present invention may be better understood with reference to the accompanying descriptions.<br>
Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details set forth in the following description or exemplified by the Examples. The invention is capable of<br>
 <br>
other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.<br>
As discussed hereinabove, it has been recently reported that well-defined, synthetically prepared oxidized phospholipids can regulate the immune response to oxidized LDL and are thus highly effective in treating atherosclerosis and related diseases, as well as autoimmune diseases and inflammatory disorders. It has been further reported that generally, etherified oxidized phospholipids are superior to comparable esterified oxidized phospholipids as therapeutic agents.<br>
These highly beneficial oxidized phospholipids typically include a glycerolic backbone, to which a lipid residue, a phosphate residue and an oxidized moiety-containing lipid residue are attached, as is described in detail, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 6,838,452 and in WO 04/106486.<br>
As is further discussed hereinabove, the presently known methods of preparing such well-detlned synthetic oxidized phospholipids involve multi-step syntheses. While these multi-step syntheses were found to be relatively efficient, resulting in moderate to good yield, these methods are limited by the need to perform laborious isolation and purification procedures of the various intermediates formed throughout the syntheses. Particularly, these procedures typically involve techniques such as column chromatography, which, as is widely recognized by a skilled artisan, is industrially inapplicable, or at least inefficient in terms of costs, complexity and use of excessive amounts of organic solvents, which may be hazardou.s and requires special care of the waste di-sposal. The need to use colunuj c)Â»rorn(i(()grtt|&gt;hy In llicsc methods stems from the fact that the intermediates, as well as the final products formed during these multi-step syntheses, cannot be isolated and/or purified by more conventional techniques such as extraction, crystallization and the like.<br>
Since such synthetically-prepared oxidized phospholipids exhibit exceptionally beneficial therapeutic activity, it is highly desired to prepare these compounds in a high level of purity. Furthermore, since the preparation of such oxidized phospholipids involves multi-step syntheses, purification of the intermediates is required in order to perform such a process is reasonable yields and with minimal amount of side products.<br>
 <br>
In a search for novel methods of preparing oxidized phospholipids, which could be efficiently utilized in the scaled-up production of these compounds, while circumventing the need to use laborious techniques such as column chromatography, the present inventors have designed and successfully practiced novel synthetic methodologies for introducing an oxidized moiety and/or a phosphate moiety to compounds that have a glycerolic backbone, which circumvent the disadvantageous use of column chromatography and which result in relatively high yield of pure compounds. The methods described herein further typically utilize commercially available, non-hazardous reactants, which further provides for the industrial applicability thereof<br>
The novel synthetic methodologies described herein can be divided as follows:<br>
(i) a novel method of introducing an oxidized moiety to a compound having a glycerolic backbone, via introduction of an unsaturated moiety and oxidation of the unsaturated moiety, whereby upon said oxidation the oxidized moiety-containing compound is isolated and purified by means of a water-soluble adduct;<br>
(ii) a novel method of introducing an oxidized moiety to a compound having a glycerolic backbone, via introduction of an unsaturated moiety and oxidation of the unsaturated moiety, whereby said oxidation is performed via an epoxide intermediate and in the presence of a selective protecting group;<br>
(iii) a novel method of introducing an oxidized moiety to a compound having a glycerolic backbone, via introduction of an unsaturated moiety and oxidation of the unsaturated moiety, whereby said oxidation is performed directly and allows isolation and purification of the oxidized product by simple phase-separation means;<br>
(iii) a novel method of introducing an oxidized moiety to a compound having a glycerolic backbone, via direct introduction of the oxidized moiety; and<br>
(iv) a novel method of introducing a phosphate moiety to a glycerolipid optionally having an oxidized or pre-oxidized moiety attached thereto, via introduction of a reactive phosphorous-containing group.<br>
Due to the superior performance of oxidized phospholipids in which the oxidized moiety-containing residue is attached to the backbone via an ether bond, these methods arc all directed for the attachment of the oxidized moiety-containing residue to the glycerolic backbone via an ether bond.<br>
 <br>
As is demonstrated in the Examples section that followN, using these methodologies, well-defined oxidized phospholipids, have been successfully propiircd in relatively high yield and purity.<br>
Thus, according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of preparing a compound having a glycerolic backbone and at least one oxidized moiety-containing residue attached to the glycerolic backbone via an ether bond, which is devoid of column cliromatography. The method, according to this aspect of the present invention, is effected by:<br>
providing a first compound having a glycerolic backbone and at least one free hydroxyl group;<br>
providing a second compound having at least one unsaturated bond and at least one reactive group capable of forming an ether bond with said free hydroxyl group;<br>
reacting the first compound and the second compound to thereby obtain a third compound, which has a glycerolic backbone and an unsaturated bond-containing residue being attached to the glycerolic backbone via an ether bond;<br>
isolating the third compound, to thereby obtain a purified third compound;<br>
reacting the purified third compound with an oxidizing Â£^ent, to thereby obtain a fourth compound, which has a glycerolic backbone and an oxidized moiety-containing residue attached to the glycerolic backbone via an ether bond; and<br>
isolating the fourth compound to thereby obtain a purified fourth compound, thereby obtaining the compound having a glycerolic backbone and at least one oxidized moicty-containing residue attached to the glycerolic backbone via an ether bond.<br>
As used herein throughout, the phrase "a compound having a glycerolic backbone", which is also referred to herein interchangeably as "a glycerolic compound", or a "glycerol compound" describes a compound that includes the following skeleton:<br>
â 'Â». â .,.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
When the compound is glycerol, each of the glycerolic positions sn-l, sn-2 and sn-3 is substituted by a free hydroxyl group.<br>
As used herein throughout, the phrases "oxidized moiety" and "an oxidized moiety-containing residue", which are used herein interchangeably, describe an organic moiety in wliich at least one of its carbon atoms is substituted by an oxygen atom. Examples, without limitation, include aldehyde, carboxylic acid, carboxylic ester, diol, acetal, and kelal. The phrases "a compound having an oxidized moiety-containing residue" and "an oxidized moiety-containing compound" arc also u.sed herein interchangeably.<br>
The method according to this aspect of the present invention is based on introducing an unsaturated moiety to the glycerolic compound and .subjecting the unsaturated bond to oxidative cleavage. However, while such a synlhctic route has been employed in the presently known syntheses ol glycerolic oxidized phospholipids, the present inventors have now designed and successfully practiced such a process in which the glycerolic compound that has an oxidized moiety attached thereto can be isolated and purified without using column chromatography.<br>
Introduction of the unsaturated moiety to the glycerolic compound is typically performed using methods known in the art, such as described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 6,838,452.<br>
Typically, a first compound, which has a glycerolic backbone and at least one free hydroxyl group, is selected as the starting material.<br>
A compound that has an unsaturated moiety and a first reactive group, which is also referred to herein as the second com{^ound, is obtained, either commercially or using methods known in the art, and is reacted with the glycerolic starting material.<br>
The first reactive group is selected capable of reacting with the free hydroxyl group. Reacting with the free hydroxyl group so as to form an ether bond is typically performed via a nucleophilic mechanism and therefore the first reactive group is preferably characterized as a good leaving group and can be, for example, halide, â¢sulfonate, and any other leaving group.<br>
Preferably, the reactive group is halide and more preferably, it is bromide.<br>
The second compound is preferably selected such that the unsaturated moiety is present at a terminus position thereof, so as to facilitate the oxidation reaction that follows.   By "unsaturated moiety" it is meant herein a moiety that includes at least<br>
 <br>
two carbon atoms that are linked therebetween by an unsaturated bond, e.g., a double bond or a triple bond, preferably a double bond.<br>
Further preferably, the second compound comprises from 4 to 30 carbon atoms, more preferably from 4 to 27 carbon atoms, more preferably from 4 to 16 carbon atoms, more preferably from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, more preferably from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, and most preferably the second compound comprises 6 carbon atoms.<br>
Reacting the first compound and the second compound described herein is typically performed in the presence of a base. Suitable bases for use in this context of the present invention include, without limitation, inorganic bases such as sodium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, barium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide.<br>
Reacting the first compound and the second compound is typically performed m the presence of a solvent. Suitable solvents for use in this context of the present invention include, without limitation, non polar solvents such as petrol ether, hexane, benzene and toluene.<br>
In cases where it is desired to perform the reaction selectively, namely, introducing the unsaturated moiety to a certain position of the glycerolic backbone, free hydroxyl group other than the reacting hydroxyl, if present, should be protected prior to the reaction.<br>
Thus, in such cases, the method according to this aspect of the present invention optionally and preferably further comprises, prior to reacting the first compound and the second compound, protecting one or more addilioniil free hy{lrj)xyl groups that may be present within the first compound.<br>
Any of the known hydroxyl-protecting groups can be used in IIIIN context of the present invention. According to preferred embodiment of this aspect of the present invention, the protecting group is trityl.<br>
Trityl is a bulky group, which typically serves as a selective protecting group, due to steric hindrance. Thus, while reacting a glycerolic compound that has more than one free hydroxyl group, typically, the trityl group would be reacted with the less .hindered group.<br>
As noted hereinabove and is fiirther discussed in detail in U.S. Patent No. 6,838,452 and in WO 04/106486, the position of the glycerolic backbone to which an oxidized moiety is attached affects the activity of the compound. It is therefore highly<br>
 <br>
beneficial to perform the preparation of the glycerolic compounds described herein selectively, such that the oxidized moiety-containing residue would be attached to the desired position. As is further demonstrated in U.S. Patent No. 6,838,452, oxidized phospholipids that have an oxidized moiety-containing residue attached to the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone exhibit a superior performance.<br>
To that end, the use of trityl group as the protecting group while introducing the above-described second compound to the glycerolic backbone is highly beneficial, since due to its bulkiness, protection of the hydroxyl end groups, at the sn-J and/or an-3 positions would be effected, leaving the hydroxyl group at the sn-2 available for further substitutions.<br>
Once the reaction between the ftfst compound and the second compound is completed, a reaction mixture which contains a compound that has a glycerolic backbone and an unsaturated moiety-containing residue attached thereto via an ether bond is obtained. Such a compound is also referred to herein interchangeably as a third compound.<br>
Depending on the starting material used, the third compound can ftirther include one or more protecting groups, protecting free hydroxyl groups that may be present within the glycerolic backbone.<br>
The third compound, either protected or deprotected, is then isolated from the reaction mixture and treated so as to obtain a purified compound.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, isolating the third compound is performed by first collecting the formed third compound. Collecting the third compound is typically performed using conventional techniques such as extraction, removal of the solvent, filtration and the like, including any combination thereof Once collected, the crude product is dissolved is a solvent, whereby the solvent is selected such that the third compound is soluble therein whereby impurities formed during the reaction between the first and the second compounds are insoluble therein.<br>
The term "impurities" is used herein to describe any substance that is present in the final crude product and is not the product itself and include, for example, unreacted starting materials and side products.<br>
Using such a solvent, a mixture that includes a solution of the third compound in' such a solvent and insoluble substances is obtained. Suitable solvents for use. in this context of the present invention include, without limitation, noii-poiur solvents<br>
 <br>
such as petrol ether, hexanc, benzene, heptane and toluene. Preferably, the solvent is petrol ether. Further preferably, the solvent is hexane.<br>
The insoluble impurities are then removed from the niixdiie, prelcrnlily by filtration, the solvent is removed and a purified third compoimd is obtained while circumventing the need to use column chromatography in the purification procedure thereof.<br>
The purified third compound is then reacted with an oxidizing agent, so as to oxidize the unsaturated moiety and thereby obtain a fourth compound, in which an<br>
oxidized moiety-containing residue is attached to the glycerolic backbone via an ether<br>
ii â  bond.<br>
The oxidizing agent is selected depending on the desired oxidized moiety, as is detailed hereinbelow, and can be, for example, a peroxide, a periodate, a bismuthate, a permanganate, a chlorite, ozone, silver oxide, osmium tetraoxide and any combination thereof.<br>
As used herein, the term "periodate" describes a compound having the formula XIO4, wherein X can be hydrogen (for periodic acid) or a monovalent cation of a metal (e.g., sodium, potassium). A preferred periodate is sodium periodate (NaI04).<br>
The term "bismuthate" describes a compound having the formula XBiOs, wherein X can be hydrogen or a monovalent cation of a metal (e.g., sodium, potassium).<br>
The term "permanganate" describes a compound having the formula XMn04, wherein X can be hydrogen or a monovalent cation of a metal (e.g., sodium, potassium).    Preferred permanganate is potassium permanganate (KMn04).<br>
The term "chlorite" describes a compound having the formula XCIO2, wherein X can be hydrogen or a monovalent cation of a metal (e.g., sodium, potassium).As used herein, the term "peroxide" include a compound having the formula R-O-O-H, wherein R can be hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, oxyalkyl, oxycycloalkyl and oxyaryl, as these terms are defined herein.<br>
As used herein throughout, the term "alkyl" refers to a saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon including straight chain and branched chain groups. Preferably, the alkyl group has 1 to 20 carbon atoms.<br>
A "cycloalkyl" group refers to an all-carbon monocyclic or fused ring (i.e., 'rings which share an adjacent pair of carbon atoms) group wherein one of more of the<br>
 <br>
rings does not have a completely conjugated pi-electron system. Examples, without limitation, of cycloalkyl groups are cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane, cyclopentene, cyclohexane, cyclohexadiene, cycloheptane, cycloheptatriene, and adamantane.<br>
An "aryl" group refers to an all-carbon monocyclic or fiised-ring polycyclic (i.e., rings which share adjacent pairs of carbon atoms) groups having a completely conjugated pi-eleclron system. Examples, without limitation, of aryl groups are phenyl, naphthalenyl and anthracenyl.<br>
The terms "oxyalkyl", "oxycycloalkyl" and "oxyaryl" describe an R'-C(=0)-group, whereby R' is alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl, respectively, such that Ihc peroxide is a peroxycarboxylic acid.<br>
Preferably, the peroxide is hydrogen peroxide or a |&gt;er()xycari&gt;oxyIic ucid (e.g., perbenzoic acid).<br>
Thus, in one embodiment of this aspect of the present invention, the oxidized moiety is aldehyde and reacting the third compound with an oxidizing agent is performed by first converting the unsaturated moiety in the third compound to a diol moiety, preferably by means of an oxidizing agent, which is referred to herein as a first oxidizing agent; and then further oxidizing the diol moiety, by means of a second oxidizing agent, to the aldehyde moiety.<br>
The first and the second oxidizing agents can be the same or different and can be, for example, a peroxide, a periodate, a bismuthate, a permanganate, a chlorite, ozone and any combination thereof<br>
In cases where the first and the second oxidizing agents are the same, and depending on the oxidizing agent used, converting the unsaturated moiety to a diol moiety and oxidizing the diol moiety can be performed simultaneously. Suitable oxidizing agents that can be used in this respect include oxidizing agents that are capable of inducing an oxidative cleavage of an unsaturated moiety such as, for example, ozone, osmium tetraoxide, and potassium permanganate.<br>
In cases where the first and the second oxidizing agents are different, preferably the first oxidizing agent is a peroxide, such as hydrogen peroxide and the second oxidizing agent is, for example, a periodate or a bismuthate.<br>
The reaction conditions at which the converting and oxidizing procedures are performed are determined in accordance with the oxidizing agent used.<br>
 <br>
In a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the present invention, the first and the second oxidizing agents are different and converting the unsaturated moiety to a diol moiety and oxidizing the diol moiety are performed sequentially. Further according to a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the present invention, once the diol is obtained, the protecting group, if present, is removed so as to obtained a compound having three or more free hydroxyl groups (herein, a triol). Such a compound can be easily purified, prior to its oxidation to an aldehyde, by means of cry stall iz^ation, due to its unique chemical features, as is demonstrated in the Examples section the follows (see, Example 1). Once purified, selective protection the free hydroxyl group at the sn-1 and/or sn-3 positions can be effected, prior to the next synthetic step.<br>
The thus formed aldehyde-containing glycerolic compound, is then isolated fi"om the reaction mixture and purified.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the present invention, the aldehyde is purified by means of forming a water-soluble adduct thereof<br>
Thus, once the reaction with the oxidizing agent(s) is completed, the aldehyde-containing fourth compound is collected using conventional techniques as described herein above and thereafter the crude product is converted into a water-soluble adduct thereof By performing such a conversion in a biphasic system, an aqueous phase that contains the water-soluble adduct and an organic phase, which contains water-insoluble impurities are obtained. Since most of Ihc side products and unrcHcted material formed during the oxidation reaction are organic substances, such substances are easily separated from the wuter-soluble adducl by collecting llic aqueous pliase. The aldehyde-containing compound is thereafter recovered by decomposing the water-.soluble adduct.<br>
Suitable water-soluble adducts that can be used in this context of the present invention are preferably obtained by reacting the aldehyde-containing compound with a Girard reagent.<br>
Girard reagents are a family of substances that are capable of forming water-soluble hydrazone adducts with carbonyl-containing compounds, and thus allow the separation of carbonyl-containing compounds from other organic non-carbonylic compounds. Girard reagents are ionic derivatives of semicarbazide.<br>
The T form is (Carboxymethyl)trimethylammonium chloride hydrazide:<br>
 <br>
HjN,<br>
 <br>
'N^   CI-<br>
 <br>
H<br>
The D form is (Carboxymethyl)dimethylammonium chloride hydrazide:<br>
 <br>
HN<br>
 <br>
o	j<br>
 <br>
 <br>
NH,<br>
And the P form is I-(CarboxyImethyl)pyridinium chloride hydrazide:<br>
 <br>
Thus, by converting the aldehyde-containing compound to a water-soluble adduct thereof with a Girard reagent, a purified fourth compound is easily and conveniently obtained, while avoiding the use of column chromatography.<br>
In cases where the oxidized moiety is a carboxylic acid, reacting the third compound with an oxidizing agent can be performed by first providing an aldehyde-containing compound, optionally and preferably as described hereinabove, and further optionally and preferably, by providing a purified aldehyde-containing compound, using the methodology described hereinabove, and thereafter further oxidizing the aldehyde to carboxylic acid.<br>
Oxidizing the aldehyde to a carboxylic acid is preferably performed by reacting the aldehyde with an oxidizing agent such as chlorite.<br>
Alternatively, the unsaturated moiety can be oxidized to a carboxylic acid via an epoxide intermediate.<br>
 <br>
Thus, reacting the third compound with an oxidizing agent can be performed by converting the unsaturated moiety to epoxide, mid coiivciting Uic epoxide to Ihc carboxylic acid. Preferably, converting the epoxide to a carboxylic ncid is performed by converting tlic epoxide to diol and oxidizing the diol so ii.s lo olilnhj (lie caiboxylic acid moiety.<br>
Converting the third compound to an epoxide is preferably performed by reacting the third compound with a peroxide, as defined hereinabove, and more preferably with a peroxycarboxylic acid.<br>
Converting the epoxide to diol is preferably performed by reacting the epoxide with perchloric acid (HCIO4). Alternatively, the epoxide is converted to diol by reacting it with sulfiiric acid.<br>
The diol is then converted to the carboxylic acid by reacting it with a third oxidizing agent. The third oxidizing agents can be selected from periodate, bithmutate, permanganate, chlorite and any combination thereof. Preferably, the diol is converted to the carboxylic acid by reacting it with a periodate, followed by a chlorite.<br>
The fourth compound thus obtained, having a glycerolic backbone and a carboxylic acid-containing moiety attached thereto via an ether bond, in then purified, so as to obtain a purified product.<br>
The present inventors have now surprisingly found that a fourth compound obtained via the epoxide intermediate can be easily purified, while avoiding the use of column chromatography, if a free hydroxyl group thereof is protected by a protecting group such as acetate, pivaloate or benzoate.<br>
As mentioned hereinabove, a free hydroxyl group, if present in the glycerol backbone, is preferably protected, whereby a preferable, selective protecting group is trityl. However, since trityl is a large, bulky and non-polar moiety, its presence might, in some cases, complicate the isolation and purification procedures of the various intermediates and the final product.<br>
The present inventors have now uncovered that limitations associated with the trityl group can be readily circumvented by: (i) isolating an aldehyde-containing compound via the formation of a water-soluble adduct thereof, as is widely described hereinabove; or (11) replacing the trityl protecting group by a less bulky group, subsequent to the introduction of the second compound.   In addition, as described<br>
 <br>
hereinabove, when oxidizing the third compound comprises the formation of a diol, once the diol is forms, the trityl protecting group can be removed and the resulting triol can be isolated by means of crystallization.<br>
Thus, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the process further comprises, subsequent to the provision of the purified third compound and/or prior to reacting the third compound with an oxidizing agent: replacing the trityl group with a protecting group selected from the group consisting of acetate, pivaloate or benzoate.<br>
Replacing the trityl protecting group is typically effected by removing the trityl group, so as to obtain a free hydroxyl group and protecting the hydroxyl group with the desired protecting group.<br>
Protecting the hydroxyl group with an acetate group is readily performed by reacting the third compound with e.g., acetic anhydride. Protecting fhe hydroxyl group with a pivaloate group is readily performed by reacting tJic third compound with e.g., jMvaloyl chloride. Protecting the hydroxyl group wKli u bon/oatu grouf) IN readily performed by reacting the third compound with e.g., benzoyl choride.<br>
Purifying a fourth compound, as described herein, which has an acetate, pivaloate or benzoate protecting group can be carried out by conventional extraction techniques, preferably while using silica gel during the extraction procedure.<br>
As is demonstrated in the Examples section that follows (see. Example 2), it was found that preparing a glycerolic compound having an oxidized moiety-containing group attached thereto via an ether bond, via the formation of an epoxide-containing intermediate that has an acetate protecting group, resulted in highly purified compound and high reaction yield.<br>
The present inventors have further uncovered that a fourth compound having a carboxylic acid as an oxidized moiety can be readily obtained by reacting the third compounds described herein with a mixture of a periodate and a permanganate as an oxidizing agent.<br>
Converting the third compound directly to a carboxylic acid-containing compound is highly beneficial since it evidently render the entire process more efficient by reducing the number of synthetic steps and further circumvents the need to purify the intermediates formed during, the oxidation process. In addition, the oxidizing agent utilized in this route comprises safe, non-hazardous agents.<br>
 <br>
Hence, according to the presently most preferred embodiment of the present invention, the oxidized moiety is carboxylic acid and oxidizing the third compound is effected by reacting the third compound with a mixture of a periodate and a permanganate.<br>
Such a reaction is preferably performed in the presence of a base. Preferred bases that are suitable for use in this embodiment of the present invention include sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate.<br>
In cases where the obtained fourth compound has a protecting group, as described hereinabove, once the fourth compound is obtained, isolated and optionally purified, the protecting group is removed.<br>
In cases where the oxidized moiety is a carboxylic acid, the fourth compound can be readily isolated upon removal of the protecting group and obtaining a compound that has a carboxylic moiety and a hydroxy moiety.<br>
Similarly to the procedure described hereinabove for isolating and purifying the third compound, the fourth compound can be readily purified by dissolving it in a solvent, whereby the solvent is selected such that the fourth compound is soluble therein whereby impurities formed during the oxidation process are insoluble therein.<br>
Moreover, such a solvent can be selected such that the fourth compound is soluble therein whereby the protecting group is insoluble therein. Thus, performing the removal of the protecting group under conditions that involve such a solvent allows removing both the protecting group and the impurities formed during the oxidation reaction within the siime synthetic step.<br>
Using such a solvent, a mixture that includes a solution of the fourth compound in such a solvent and insoluble subslanccN Huch an iinpurilics nnd the protecting group is obtained. Suitable solvents for use in this context of the present invention include, without limitation, non-polar solvents such Â«H (HMIOI elhor, lioxanc, benzene, heptane and toluene, semi-polar solvents such as ethyl acetate and mixtures thereof Preferably, the solvent is petrol ether or hexane and/or a mixture of thereof witli ethyl acetate.<br>
The insoluble impurities are then removed from the mixture, preferably by filtration, the solvent is removed and a purified fourth compound is obtained while circumventing the need to use column chromatography in the purification procedure<br>
 <br>
thereof and further circumventing the need for multiple purification procedures of the various intermediates formed.<br>
In cases where the oxidized moiety is an ester, the process is elTected by providing a carboxylic-acid containing compound and then converting the carboxylic acid to the ester. This can be readily carried out, using procedures well known in the art. Exemplary procedures are described in the Examples section that follows (see, for example, Examples 1,6 and 7).<br>
As is discussed hereinabove, compounds having a glycerolic backbone and at least one oxidized moiety-containing residue attached to the glycerolic backbone and further having a phosphorous-containing moiety attached to the glycerolic backbone, preferably a phosphate-containing moiety, are known as oxidized phospholipids and are highly beneficial in treating various conditions. Thus, the process described herein optionally and preferably further comprises introduction of such a phosphorous-containing moiety to the glycerolic backbone.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "phosphorous-containing moiety" describes a moiety, as defined herein, which includes one or more phosphor atoms. Representative examples include, without limitation, phosphates, phosphonates, phosphines, phosphine oxides, phosphites, pyrophosphates and like.<br>
As used herein the term "phosphonate" describes a -P(=0)(OR')(OR") group, where R' and R" are each independently hydrogen, or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl, as defined herein.<br>
The term "phosphinyl" describes a -PR'R" group, with R' and R" as defined hereinabove.<br>
The term "phosphine oxide" describes a -P(=0)(R')(R") end group or a -P(=0)(R')- linking group, as these phrases are defined hereinabove, with R' and R" as defined herein.<br>
The term "pyrophosphate" describes an -0-P(=0)(OR')-0-P(=0)(OR')(OR")(OR"') group, with R', R" as defined herein, and R'" is defined as R' or R".<br>
The term "phosphite" describes an -O-PH(=0)(0R') group, with R' as defined herein.<br>
The term "phosphate" describes an -0-P(=0)2(0R') group, with R' as defined herein.<br>
 <br>
The term "Ihiophosphate" describes an "0-P(=0)(Â»S)(OR') gwiip, with R' as defined herein.<br>
The introduction of a phosphorous-containing moicly lo the glycerolic compound can be performed either prior to reacting the first compound and the second compound, prior to isolating the third compound, prior lo Â»riÂ«;linn <ho third compound with the oxidizing agent prior to isolating fourth or subsequent and can be performed using any of methods known in art.></ho>
Introduction of a phosphorous-containing moiety lo a compound having a glycerolic compound is therefore performed by:<br>
reacting any of the first compound, the third compound, the purified third compound, the fourth compound or the purified fourth compound described above, with a phosphorous-containing moiety, so as to obtain a compound having a glycerolic backbone and at least one oxidized moiety-containing residue attached to the glycerolic backbone and further having a phosphorous-containing moiety attached to the glycerolic backbone.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the phosphorous-containing moiety is a phosphate moiety which is attached to the glycerolic backbone via a phosphodiester bond.<br>
Thus, the phosphorous-containing moiety can be, for example, phosphoric<br>
acid, phosphoryl choline, phosphoryl ethanolamine, phosphoryl serine, phosphoryl<br>
cardiolipin, phosphoryl inositol, ethylphosphocholine, phosphorylmethanol,<br>
phosphorylethanol,	phosphorylpropanol,	phosphorylbutanol,<br>
phosphorylethanolamine-N-lactose, phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(propylene<br>
,. glycol)],	phosphoinositol-4-phosphate,	phosphoinositol-4,5-biposphonate,<br>
pyrophosphate, phosphoethanolamine-diethylenetriamine-pentaacetate, dinitrophenyl-phosphoethanolamine and phosphoglycerol.<br>
Preferably, the phosphorous-containing moiety is attached to the sn-3 position of the glycerolic backbone and thus, introduction of such a moiety is performed selectively, by appropriately protecting other free hydroxyl groups that are present in the reacting compound or deprotecting a protected hydroxyl group at the desired position.<br>
 <br>
In the presently known methods of preparing oxidized phospholipids, the phosphorous-containing moiety is typically introduced prior to the provision of an oxidized-moiety containing compound.<br>
In addition, in cases where the phosphorous-containing moiety is phosphoryl choline, a widely used and beneficial moiety in such compounds, the presently known methods involve N-alkylation reactions, which involve hazardous and environmentally unfriendly reagents such as, for example, trimethylamine.<br>
The present inventors have now uncovered that (i) a phosphorous-containing moiety can be readily introduced subsequent to the provision of an oxidized moiety-containing compound; and (ii) the introduction of the phosphorous-containing moiety can be efficiently performed via a reactive phosphorous-containing intermediate.<br>
24<br>
Based on the above, the present inventors have designed and successfully practiced a novel process for introducing a phosphorous-containing moiety to compounds having a glycerolic backbone and an oxidi/ed moioty-conlaining residue attached thereto via an ether bond.<br>
This process, combined with the process described iilwvi' (i&gt;i pmpiuJng Uic oxidized moiety-containing compound, can be beneficially used for preparing the therapeutically beneficial oxidizes phospholipids described above.<br>
Thus, according preferred embodiments of the present invention, the introduction of the phosphorous-containing moiety is performed subsequent to the production of the third compound or subsequent to the production of the fourth compound, with the latter being preferred. However, it should be noted that the process of introducing the phosphorous-containing moiety presented herein is also applicable at any other stage.<br>
The introduction of a phosphorous-containing moiety to a glycerolic compound is therefore preferably effected, according to the present embodiments, by reacting a first compound, a third compound, a purified third compound, a fourth compound or a purified fourth compound as described above, which has a free hydroxyl group, with a reactive phosphorous-containing compound, so as to produce a compound having a reactive phosphorous-containing group; and converting the reactive phosphorous-containing group to the phosphorous-containing moiety.<br>
The reactive phosphorous-containing compound is selected such that upon said reacting, a reactive phosphorous-containing group attached to the glycerolic<br>
 <br>
backbone is obtained. The reactive phosphorous-containing compound is therefore selected as having a second reactive group and a third reactive group, whereby the second reactive group is selected capable of reacting with the free hydroxyl group and the third reactive group is selected capable of being converted to the phosphorous-containing moiety.<br>
Reactive groups that are capable of reacting with a free hydroxyl groups include, for example halides, sulfonyl chlorides, acyl halides and the like.<br>
Preferably the second reactive group is halide and more preferably it is chloride.<br>
I	While as described hereinabove, preferable phosphorous-containing moieties<br>
are phosphate moieties, converting the phosphorous-containing compound to the desired phosphorous-containing moiety typically involves a formation of a phosphate-ester bond. Such a bond can be obtained, for example, by reacting a phosphoric derivative such as phosphoryl chloride with a hydroxy-containing moiety.<br>
Thus, according to a preferred embodiment, the reactive phosphorous-containing compound is phosphorous oxychloride (POCI3), such that the third and the second reactive groups are both chlorides and the compound having a phosphorous-containing reactive group has a glycerolic backbone and a phosphoryl chloride residue attached thereto.<br>
Reacting the first compound, the third compound, the purified third compound, the fourth compound or the purified fourth compound with the phosphorous oxychloride is typically carried out in the presence of a base. Suitable bases include organic and inorganic bases, with organic bases being preferred. Tlias, the reaction is preferably effected in presence of a base such as, for example, trialkylamine (e.g., triethylamine).<br>
This reaction is further preferably carried out in the presence of a solvent, preferably u polar solvent such as Tl IF.<br>
The phosphoryl chloride-containing glycerolic containing compound obtained by the process described herein can be readily converted to any desired phosphorus-containing moiety and is therefore a highly beneficial intermediate.<br>
Thus, for example, it can be converted to phosphoric acid by a simple hydrolysis thereof, as is exemplified in the Examples section that follows.<br>
 <br>
Alternatively, it can be reacted with a hydroxy-containing moiety, and optionally and preferably also with water, to thereby obtain other phosphate moieties.<br>
Preferred phosphate moieties that are incorporated in therapeutic oxidized phospholipids (e.g., phosphoryl choline, phosphoryl ethanolamine) typically include an aminoalkyl group, which can be further N-alkylated.<br>
Converting the phosphoryl chloride intermediate to such phosphate moieties can thus be readily performed by reaction with a derivative of the desired aminoalkyl group, selected capable of reacting with the third reactive group (being a chloride).<br>
Thus, for example, aminoalkyl-containing phosphate moieties can be obtained by reacting the phosphoryl chloride intermediate with an aminoalcohol. If desired, the aminoalcohol can thereafter be further alkylated, so as to produce an N-alkylated aminoalkyl phosphate moiety, as in the case of a phosphoryl choline moiety.<br>
Obtaining such an N-alkylated aminoalkyl phosphate moiety attached to a glycerolic backbone using the process described above is highly beneficial since it circumvents the need to use hazardous materials such as the trimethylamine typically used for obtaining such compounds.<br>
As discussed hereinabove, the introduction of the phosphorous-containing moiety can be performed either prior to or subsequent to the introduction of an oxidized moiety-containing residue to the glycerolic compound. As is demonstrated in the Examples section that follows, a phosphoryl choline moiety was successfully introduced into glycerolic compounds having either an oxidized-moiety containing residue or an unsaturated-nioiely containing residue (sec, Examples -1 and 5). Thus, the process of introducing a phosphate moiety via a reactive phosphorous-containing intermediate presented herein can be performed either with glycerolic compounds having an oxidized or pre-oxidized moiety attached thereto via an ether bond.<br>
In their search for improved methods for preparing oxidized phospholipids, the present inventors have further designed and practiced an additional process for preparing a glycerolic compound having an oxidized moiety attached thereto via an ether bond, which is effected by direct introduction of an oxidized moiety-containing residue to a glycerolic compound.<br>
Hence, according to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of preparing a compound having a glycerolic backbone and at least one<br>
 <br>
oxidized moiety-containing residue attached to the glycerolic backbone via an ether bond, which is eflected by:<br>
providing a first compound having a glycerolic backbone and at least one free hydroxyl group, as described hereinabove;<br>
providing a fifth compound having at least one oxidi/ed moiety, as described hereinabove, and at least one fourth reactive group;<br>
reacting the first compound and the fifth compound to thereby obtain a reaction mixture containing a sixth compound, being the compound having a glycerolic backbone and at least one oxidized moiety-containing residue attached to the glycerolic backbone via an ether bond; and<br>
isolating the compound having a glycerolic backbone and at least one oxidized moiety-containing residue attached to the glycerolic backbone via an ether bond.<br>
The process according to this aspect of the present invention therefore involves the reaction of the first compound described hereinabove with a compound that has a reactive group that is capable of reacting with a free hydroxyl group of the first compound, referred to herein as a fourth reactive group, and an oxidized moiety. Such a compound is referred to herein as the fifth compound.<br>
The oxidized moiety in the fifth compound can be any of the oxidized moieties described above, namely, an aldehyde, a diol, a carboxylic acid, an ester an acetal or a ketal. Optionally, the oxidized moiety can be a semi-oxidized moiety, namely, being readily converted to a desired oxidized moiety without reacting with an oxidizing agent. An example of such a semi-oxidized moiety is nitrile, which can be readily converted to a carboxylic acid by a simple hydrolysis.<br>
The fourth reactive group in the fifth compound is as described herein for the first reactive group and is preferably a halide and more preferably a bromide.<br>
Reacting the first compound and the fifth compound is preferably effected in the presence of a base. Relatively strong inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium hydride, potassium hydroxide, lithium aluminum hydride, sodium amide, sodium hydroxide and any mixture thereof are preferred.<br>
Under such reaction conditions, a fifth compound which has 4 or 5 carbon atoms might be cyclized during the reaction, thus adversely affecting the reaction efficiency.<br>
 <br>
Thus, preferably, the fifth compound preferably has less than 4 or more than 5 carbon atoms.<br>
As described hereinabove, in cases where the first compound has more than one hydroxyl group attached thereto, the hydroxyl group is optionally and preferably protected by a protecting group, prior to reacting the first and the fifth compounds.<br>
Once the sixth compound is obtained, the protecting group can be removed and the compound is purified using conventional purification methods.<br>
Tlie process according to this aspect of the present invention is highly beneficial since it enables to prepare the described oxidized moiety-containing compound in a one-step synthesis.<br>
Using this process, oxidized phospholipids can be readily obtained by introducing a phosphorous-containing moiety, a described in detail hereinabove, either prior to or subsequent to the reaction with the fifth compound, The introduction of the phosphorous-containing moiety is preferably performed using the process presented hereinabove.<br>
In any of the processes described herein, the first compound can include an alkylcnc chain attached thereto, Preferably, the alkylenc chniii is nJliichcd Ui (lio m-l position of the first compound.<br>
The alkylene chain can be attached to the glycerolic compound by, for example, an ester bond or an ether bond. Preferably, the alkylene chain is attached via an ether bond, such that the final product is a dietherified glycerolic compound.<br>
Thus, in each of the p/ocesses described herein, the first compound is a glycerolipid, as defined herein and preferably, a mono-etherified glycerolipid in which the lipid moiety is attached to the sn-1 position of the glycerol. Such a first compound therefore has one free hydroxyl group, which, as described hereinabove, is preferably protected prior to any reaction.<br>
Thus, the first compound can be, for example, a glycerol, a glycerolipid, a mono-etherified glycerolipid, a di-etherified glycerolipid, a phosphoglycerol, a phosphoglyceride, a mono-etherified phosphoglyceride and a lysolechitin.<br>
As is discussed in detail hereinabove, the position at which the oxidized moiety-containing residue is attached to the glycerolic backbone affects the activity of the resulting compounds and thus, as is further discussed hereinabove, it is preferably to perform the reaction selectively.<br>
 <br>
Preferably, in any of the processes described herein the oxidized moiety-containing residue is attached to the sn-2 position of the compound. Thus, by appropriately selecting and/or protecting the first compound, selective attachment of the oxidized moiety-containing residue is perforined.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the first compound therefore has the following general formula I:<br>
.0	A,<br>
-OH<br>
-R3<br>
Formula I<br>
wherein:<br>
A| is absent or is selected fi-om the group consisting of CH2, CH=CH and C=0;<br>
Ri is selected from the group consisting of H and a hydrocarbon chain having from 1 to 30 carbon atoms; and<br>
R3 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, nryl, phosphoric acid, phosphoryl choline, phosphoryl ethanolamine, phosphoryl serine, phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidyl serine, phosphatidyl cardiolipin, phosphatidyl inositol, phosphoryl cardiolipin, phosphoryl inosilol, ethylphosphocholine, phosphorylmethanol, phosphorylethnnol, phosphorylpropanol, phosphoryl butanol, phosphorylethanolamine-N-lactosc, phosplioclluHiuluniinc-N-[methoxy(propylene glycol)], phosphoinositol-4-phosphate, phosphoinositol-4,5-biposphonate, pyrophosphate, phosphoethanolamine-diethylenetriamine-pentaacetate, dinitrophenyl-phosphoethanolamine, phosphoglycerol.<br>

As is demonstrated in the Examples section that follows, the above-described processes can be used for producing oxidized phospholipids, and particularly therapeutically beneficial oxidized phospholipids such as r-hexadecyl-2-(4'-carboxy)butyl-3-phosphocholine (also known in the art and referred to herein as CI-201). For example, using the process described in Example 6 hereinbelow, l-Hexadecyl-2-(4'-carboxy)butyl-3-phosphocholine was produced in an industrial scale of dozens of Kg.<br>
Additional objects, advantages, and novel features of the present invention will become apparent to one ordinarily skilled in the art upon examination of the following examples, which are not intended to be limiting. Additionally, each of the various embodiments and aspects of the present invention as delineated hereinabove and as claimed in the claims section below finds experimental support in the following examples.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preparation o/rac-l-hexadecyl-2~(5'-pentanoic methyl ester)-glycerol using periodate and a Girard T reagent<br>
In this example, an imsaturated moiety is introduced into a glycerolic backbone and is thereafter oxidized by means of formic acid, hydrogen peroxide and periodate. Then thus formed oxidized product is purified by means of a Girard reagent.<br>
As a representative example, the preparation of rac-l-hexadecyl-2-(5'-pentanoic methyl ester)-gIycerol is hereby described.<br>
rac-l-Hexadecyl-2-(5'-pentanoic methyl ester)-glycerol is prepared in accordance with the teachings of the present invention, as is described in Schemes I through V below.<br>
l-Hexadecyl-3-tritylglycerol was prepared as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,838,452. In brief, D-acetone glycerol (4 grams), powdered potassium hydroxide (approximately 10 grams) and hexadecyl bromide (9.3 grams) in benzene (100 ml) were stirred and refluxed for 5 hours, while removing the water formed by azeotropic distillation (compare W. J. Baumann and H. K. Mangold, J. Org. Chem. 29: 3055, 1964 and F. Paltauf, Monatsh. 99:1277, 1968). The volume of the solvent was gradually reduced to about 20 ml, and the resulting mixture was cooled to room temperature and dissolved in ether (100 ml). The resulting solution was washed with water (2 x 50 ml), and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. A 100 ml mixture of 90:10:5 methanol:water:concentrated hydrochloric acid was added to the residue and the mixture was refluxed for 10 minutes. The product was extracted with ether (200 ml) and was washed consecutively with water (50 ml), 10 % .sodium hydroxide (20 ml) and again with water (volumes of 20 ml) until ncutnil. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the product (8.8 gramn) was crystallized from hexane to give 7.4 grams of pure 1-hexadecyl-glycerol.<br>

In this process, l-hexadecyl-2-(5'-hexenyl)-3-tritylglycerol Is directly oxidized to obtain the corresponding carboxylic acid in a one-step procedure, thus circumventing the need to perform the oxidation via a multiple-step procedure that requires laborious separations of the intermediates. The oxidation step is performed using safe, efficient and less hazardous oxidizing agents.  Purification procedures of<br>
 <br>
all the intermediates are performed while avoiding the use of industrially inapplicable column chromatography.<br>
This process was efficiently scaled-up, so as to industrially manufacture CI-201.<br>
