This invention relates to a camouflaging scrim garnish which is particularly though not exclusively, useful in camouflaging defence equipments, such as military tanks, vehicles and anti-air craft guns etc. Camouflaging is a strategy followed by many to prevent detection. This is particularly useful in the defence field for avoiding detection and identification by the enemy. Military tanks and artillery in and around battle fields and in military installations are often camouflaged.<br>
Conventionally camouflaging is effected by covering the articles to be camouflaged with materials such as plants, foliage fabric dyed in natural colours. Plants and foliage are not easily replenishable and wanton destruction of plants harm the environment. Jute and jute based camouflaging materials are used by many. Though readily available and biodegradable, jute camouflaging material is not found durable, found to last at the most only one season. Nets made of synthetic materials such as nylon are also used. Though camouflaging with synthetic material is more durable than using jute camouflaging material and is found to last at least three or four seasons, they are not biodegradable and ecofriendly. Further, camouflaging material made from thermoplastic resins are affected by the extreme weather conditions in the desert and are liable to get destroyed when exposed to such conditions.<br><br>
The object of the present invention is to produce an effective camouflaging scrim garnish that would overcome the drawbacks discussed herein above. Coir is a natural fibre produced from coconut husks. Coconut trees are abundant in India, particularly in the southern coastal area. Many articles which are useful industrially and domestically are manufactured from coconut fibre. Coconut fibre is biodegradable and readily available.<br>
A mixture of coir fibre and aluminized yarn or aluminium fibre or filament is allowed to pass through a conventional willowing machine. The substrate formed is then pressed using rollers and on this non-woven substrate vulcanizable rubber latex is sprayed using sprayers. The substrate is then subjected to vulcanization in a known manner. Latex composition may be sprayed on either side or on both sides so as to coat and strengthen the substrate evenly coir fibre used for making the camouflage material may be dyed or undyed. Rubber latex composition used for spraying the non-woven web of coir and aluminium fibre substrate contains rubber latex and known vulcanizing components such as sulphur, zinc oxide and water. Rubber latex composition may also be coloured.<br><br>
Coir and aluminium fibre or aluminised yarn may be mixed in any desired proportion. Aluminium content is preferably kept between 20 to 50g/sq metre. Density of the non-woven substrate after latex spraying may be between 150 to 500g/sq meter. Preferably about 100g/sq meter of the rubber latex composition is sprayed on the coir fibre aluminium fibre substrate which is subsequently cured. The weight of the finished product may only be 50% of the initial weight of the substrate after spraying.<br>
A major advantage in using the camouflaging material according to the invention is that aluminised fibre present therein scatters the microwave radiation from airborne radar. The camouflaging material according to the invention is also very light in weight. Optionally the substrate of coir fibre and aluminised fibre may also be woven.<br>
This invention relates to a camouflaging scrim garnish which comprises a substrate made of coir fibre and aluminized fibre or aluminum filaments having a coating of cured rubber latex thereon.<br>
The substrate may be woven or non woven, and dyed.<br><br>
This invention also includes a method of making a camouflaging scrim garnish which comprises the steps of passing coir fibres and aluminised fibre or aluminium filaments through a willowing machine, pressing the web produced thereby through rollers, spraying rubber latex composition on to the substrate so formed and curing the same thereafter.<br>
Curing may if desired be effected at a temperature above normal and at reduced pressure according to known curing or vulcanization steps.<br>
Though this invention is described hereinabove with a specific embodiment, obvious equivalents and modifications known to persons skilled in the art are within its scope and that of the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
I CLAIM:<br>
1.	A camouflaging scrim garnish comprising a substrate made of coir fibre and aluminised fibre or aluminium filaments having a coating of cured rubber latex thereon.<br>
2.	The camouflaging scrim garnish as claimed in claim 1, wherein said substrate is a non-woven substrate and has a density of 150 to 500g/sq meter.<br>
3.	The camouflaging scrim garnish as claimed in claims 1 or 2, wherein the aluminium content of the said substrate ranges from 20 to 50g/sq meter.<br>
4.	The camouflaging scrim garnish as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 3, wherein said substrate is dyed.<br>
5.	A method of making a camouflaging scrim garnish comprising the steps of passing coir fibres and aluminised fibre or aluminium filaments through a willowing machine, pressing the web produced thereby though rollers spraying rubber latex composition on to the substrate so formed and curing the same thereafter.<br><br>
The method as claimed in claim 5, wherein about 100g/sq meter of the rubber latex composition is sprayed on to the substrate.<br>
The method as claimed in claims 5 or 6, wherein said rubber latex composition contains natural rubber latex and known additives such as sulphur, zinc oxide and colourants.<br>
The method as claimed in any one of the claims 5 to 7 wherein the sprayed substrate is cured by heating optionally under reduced pressure till the weight of the uncured substrate is reduced by about 50%.<br>
A camouflaging scrim garnish substantially as herein described.<br>
A method of making a camouflaging scrim garnish substantially as herein described.<br><br></td>
