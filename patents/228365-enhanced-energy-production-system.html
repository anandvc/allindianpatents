				<td>ENHANCED ENERGY PRODUCTION SYSTEM<br>
Field of the Invention.<br>
The present invention relates to energy production and in particular to a<br>
system for increasing the yield of an existing energy production system which<br>
provides a non-polluting source of energy from water in the form of hydrogen and<br>
heat.<br>
Background Art<br>
A variety of energy sources are presently available, such as nuclear,<br>
solar, hydroelectric, geothermal, wind and tidal power. However, by far the most<br>
common and convenient sources of energy at present are those based on the<br>
combustion of carbonaceous products. For example, coal, gas, coke, wood, petroleum<br>
and diesel. By necessity, when such carbonaceous products bum they produce oxides<br>
of carbon, most notably CO2.<br>
CO2 has become notorious as a "greenhouse" gas and the 1997 Kyoto<br>
protocol aims to reduce the level of such greenhouse gases and ultimately minimise<br>
the extent of global wanning and its consequences.<br>
The use of Hydrogen as a fuel therefore represents an attractive<br>
alternative.<br>
Fuel cells convert hydrogen directly into electrical energy by reactions<br>
which involve the reforming of hydrogen rich organic compounds (such as methane<br>
and methanol) by means of steam, catalysis, elevated temperatures and the like. Fuel<br>
cells operate by the direct conversion of chemical energy in a fuel to electrical energy<br>
without an intermediate combustion change. They represent the principal next<br>
generation source of mass energy production and are poised to make a significant<br>
contribution to power generation. However, these fuel cells suffer from the<br>
disadvantage that they all produce oxides of carbon, such as CO or CO2, when using<br>
reformed organics as their hydrogen source.<br>
On the earth, free or uncombined hydrogen is rare. It is commonly<br>
found in a combined form such as water, hydrocarbons and all plant and animal<br>
matter. In producing elemental hydrogen, the primary considerations are usually cost<br>
and convveience in the laboratory pure hydrogen is usuallymade by the reaction of a<br>
suitable metal with a displacement acid or by the electrolysis of water. For<br>
commercial hydrogen, the primary sources are water and hydrocarbons. These<br><br>
endothermic processes require energy.<br>
Molecular hydrogen is an important source of energy, as evidenced by<br>
the endothermic nature of its production. Its internal energy can be released either by<br>
combustion or by reaction with oxygen in a fuel cell.<br>
However, the combustion of hydrogen gas directly produces no oxides<br>
of carbon - clean combustion produces theoretically only pure water.<br>
The electronic and dehydrogenation process mentioned above for the<br>
production of molecular hydrogen produce by-products which may be unwanted.<br>
Electrolysis produces oxygen, which is useful, but dehydrogenation of organic<br>
compounds produces carbon dioxide, a global warming gas. These processes also<br>
require considerable energy input from external sources.<br>
Attempts have been made to produce pure molecular hydrogen by self<br>
sustaining exothermic reactions. Conventional hydrogen generators are described in<br>
U. S. patent no. 4,463,063 and refer to the reaction of metal hydrides with water and<br>
the use of extruded electropositive metal anodes which gradually dissolve in the<br>
electrolytes, to provide electrons for discharge at inert cathodes.<br>
In all of these instances the resulting compounds apart from the<br>
hydrogen produced, are regarded as watte, with problems associated with their<br>
collection and disposal.<br>
Pure hydrogen can be liberated from water according to the following<br>
half cell equation:<br>
2H2O+2e—* 2OH-+H2	E°=-0.828V.<br>
In theory, any electropositive system with an Eo value greater than<br>
0.828 V can react with water to produce hydrogen. Examples of such electropositive<br>
systems with Eo values above 0.828 V include hydrides, for example:<br>
2H-—►H2 + 2e	E°=2.23V<br>
Although reactions of metals to produce hydrogen such as that given<br>
by:<br>
Al + H2O + NaOH—* NaA102+ 11/2H2<br>
are chemically feasible, they are kinetically very slow and the hydrogen is produced at<br>
a slow rate over a priod this 'trickle' of hydrogen is unsatisfactory for<br>
commercial use.<br>
It is desirable therefore to maximise not only the amount of hydrogen<br><br>
produced by a cell, but also the rate of hydrogen production.<br>
More recent inventions in the field disclose generators for the<br>
production of hydrogen from methanol (U. S. patent no's 5,712,052 and 5,885,727).<br>
However, a by-product of the said reaction is carbon monoxide which is adsorbed by<br>
the catalyst, causing "catalyst poisoning", which refers to the deterioration of the<br>
catalytic function of the electrode, and subsequent lowering in the energy efficiency of<br>
the system, in order to minimise this problem, such generators must necessarily be<br>
equipped with means for measuring the carbon monoxide concentration in the system<br>
as well as means for decreasing it.<br>
The commercially useable hydrogen being produced as late as August<br>
2004 was being extracted mostly from natural gas. Nearly 90% of hydrogen is<br>
obtained by steam reformation of naptha or natural gas. Gasification of coal and<br>
electrolysis of water are the other industrial methods for hydrogen production.<br>
However, these processes are highly energy-intensive and not always environmentally<br>
friendly due mainly to the production of either CO2 or CO as a product.<br>
The steam-iron process is one of the oldest ways of producing<br>
hydrogen.<br>
iron + steam ^™ irbnOQI) oxide + hydrogen.<br>
2?^) + 3H2O(g) v=^ Ft&gt;!OXt) + 3H2<tf></tf>
Note that the reaction between iron and steam is reversible.<br>
Although it was considered to be an important option, also from the<br>
economic point of view for producing hydrogen with a high purity, the steam<br>
reforming of natural gas or partial oxidation of heavy oils outweighed it. The interest<br>
in the steam-iron process has recently grown due to the relatively clean hydrogen that<br>
can be produced in mis process, which is especially important for the use of hydrogen<br>
in fuel cells and also due to the possibility to use renewable energy sources for this<br>
process.<br>
One prior art system utilising the steam-iron process is directed to a<br>
repetitive cycle process in which the relevant reaction pathways are:<br>
3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g) v=^ Fe3O4<s></s>
3FeO + H2O(g) «F* FesO^) + H2(6)<br><br>
Natural gas or other gaseous reducing species can remove oxygen from<br>
the higher oxidation state such as Fe2O3 (hematite) or Fe3O4 (magnetite) forming a<br>
stream of carbon oxides, water and unconverted hydrocarbons. If operating<br>
conditions and the reactor design are appropriately selected, only carbon dioxide and<br>
water are produced as per the following equations:<br>
4Fe2O3 + CH4→ 8FeO + CC2 + 2H2O<br>
4Fe2O3 + 3CH4 → 8Fc + 3CO2 + 6H2O<br>
4Fe3O4 •+ CH4, → 12FeO + CO2 + 2H2O<br>
Fe3O4 + CH4 → 3Fe + CO2 + 2H2O<br>
Condensing water leaves a pure carbon dioxide stream ready to be stored. The<br>
disadvantages with tin's system are mat different reactor and Fe regeneration vessels<br>
must be used to maximise the purity of the hydrogen removed and that carbon dioxide<br>
is still produced.<br>
Our previous system was a method for generating hydrogen and/or<br>
energy from a chemical reaction including the steps of: selecting an electronegative<br>
half cell reaction producing hydrogen; selecting an electropositive half cell reaction<br>
having a sufficient potential to drive said electonegative half cell reaction selecting a<br>
second electropositive half cell reaction; said first and second electropositive half cell<br>
reactions selected in combination with said electronegative half cell reaction to<br>
produce an increase in hydrogen and/or energy production from water; and combining<br>
said half cell reactions. This system, through a suitable selection of half-cell reactions,<br>
chemical concentrations, and inherent interactions produced approximately 67 litres of<br>
hydrogen at STP from 54g of reactant and 1 litre of water. As a by-product, the<br>
system produced a high amount of steam.<br>
The transport and storage of energy and fuel are also often problematic.<br>
The direct transference of electricity results in substantial losses of energy when the<br>
electricity is transmitted over long distances. Large infrastructure investments are also<br>
required for electricity transmittal over long distances which require the use of high<br>
tension wires and towers and booster and substation arrays to ensure delivery of<br>
adequate power to the consumer.<br>
The transmission of gaseous fuels, such as natural gas, also requires<br>
substantial infrastructure to ensure adequate pressure and supply to consumers. Single<br><br>
use and rechargeable cylinders are practicable in some cases but even household size<br>
cylinders are bulky and heavy and require regular replacement.<br>
It will be clearly understood that, if a prior art publication is referred to<br>
herein, this reference does not constitute an admission that the publication forms part<br>
of the common general knowledge in the art in Australia or in any other country.<br>
Summary of the Invention.<br>
The present invention is directed to an enhanced energy production<br>
system, which may at least partially overcome at least one of the abovementioned<br>
disadvantages or provide the consumer with a useful or commercial choice.<br>
In one form, the invention resides in an enhanced energy production<br>
system having the step of introducing steam at elevated temperature and a positive<br>
pressure into an enhanced reactor, wherein a portion of the energy added to the reactor<br>
system by the addition of the steam is used by reaction systems in the reactor to<br>
increase the number of dissociated H2O molecules at or near a reactive or catalytic<br>
point in the reactor.<br>
The energy generator produces pure gaseous hydrogen by the reduction<br>
of water by electro positive half-cell reactions involving two or more electropositive<br>
rodex systems. The systems are thosem to maxfmise hydrogen production and<br>
desirably to produce by-products which are valuable rather than harmful or useless.<br>
The invention may use the steam produced as a by-product of a method<br>
for generating hydrogen and/or energy from a chemical reaction including the steps of:<br>
selecting an electronegative half cell reaction producing hydrogen; selecting a first<br>
electropositive half cell reaction having a sufficient potential to drive said<br>
electronegative half cell reaction; selecting a second electropositive half cell reaction;<br>
said first and second electropositive half cell reactions selected in combination with<br>
said electronegative half cell reaction to produce an increase in hydrogen and/or<br>
energy production from water; and combining said half cell reactions. However,<br>
steam from any source may be used.<br>
In another form, the invention resides in an enhanced energy<br>
production system having the step of introducing steam at elevated temperature and a<br>
positive pressure into an enhanced reactor affecting oscillations of H2O<br>
molecules using an energy source wherein a portion of the energy added to the reactor<br>
system by the energy source is used by reaction systems in the reactor to increase the<br><br>
number of dissociated H2O molecules at or near a reactive or catalytic point in the<br>
reactor.<br>
Typically the reactive or catalytic point in the reactor may be a reactive<br>
or catalytic surface or portion thereof.<br>
The energy source used to affect the molecular oscillations may be any<br>
source, but preferred sources a renewable energy sources such as solar energy or<br>
microwave energy sources. These energy sources may be used in addition to or<br>
alternatively to using the steam entering the enhanced reactor as an energy source.<br>
The enhanced reactor of the present invention may also include a<br>
reaction system. The reaction system may include one or more half cell reactions. The<br>
half cell reactions may be the same as, similar to or entirely different from the<br>
reactions discussed above with reference to the method for generating hydrogen which<br>
produced steam as a by-product. Combinations of electronegative half cell reactions<br>
and electropositive half cell reactions may be used. The reaction system or half cell<br>
reactions may require or be assisted by the provision of a reactive or catalytic surface.<br>
For example, the surface may provide an alternative reaction pathway with lower<br>
activation energy. As the surface may allow the reaction to occur at a lower activation<br>
energy, a larger fraction of collisiens or interactionmay other and be offective ana<br>
given temperature or pressure. This may increase the reaction rate. Preferably, the<br>
enhanced reactor may affect the rate determining step of the reaction system. The<br>
reaction kinetics of the reaction system in the enhanced reactor may be affected. The<br>
enhanced reactor may preferably affect either the rate constant or the order of the<br>
reaction system resent in the enhanced reactor.<br>
It may also be that by the addition of steam at elevated temperatures<br>
and positive pressures, the environment within the enhanced reactor may be made<br>
more conducive to the production of hydrogen. The increased temperature caused by<br>
the steam may increase the rate of at least some of the reactions in the system within<br>
the reactor.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments of the present invention, it may be<br>
possible to select the half cell reactions such that the sum of the value of residual<br>
material in the hydrogen cell at the endpoint of the rection is greater than that of the<br>
sum of reactants introduced into the cell.<br>
Preferably, the reaction system is an inorganic chemical system.<br><br>
Preferably, the second electropositive half cell reaction can also drive<br>
the electronegative half cell reaction.<br>
The chemical system may include additional electropositive half cell<br>
reactions.<br>
Preferably, one of the electronegative half cell reactions is:<br>
2H2O + 2e" —♦ 2OHT+ H2.<br>
Preferably, one of the electropositive half cell reactions is:<br>
Mg—»Mg2+ + 2e-.<br>
Preferably, one of the electropositive half cell reactions is:<br>
Al + 4OH —* A1OH-2H2O + 3ePreferably, the electropositive half cell reactions involve the oxidation<br>
of species selected from Group I or Group H metals, binary hydrides, ternary hydrides,<br>
amphoteric elements, electropositive elements in groups one and two of the periodic<br>
table and chelated transition elements, oxyacids of phosphorus and oxyacids of sulfur.<br>
In general, the reductant can be any system having an Eo value greater<br>
than +0.83 V when a reductant is written on the left hand side of the half-cell equation<br>
is according to the Latimer convention.<br>
In bigHy prefer HuiJiJi^	fe a binary<br>
and/or ternary hydride, in combination with an amphoteric element Amphoteric<br>
elements preferred include aluminium, zinc, chromium, gallium and tin. Aluminium is<br>
particularly preferred. Iron may also be used.<br>
Preferably, the reductant in the first electropositive half cell is<br>
hypophosphorous acid or dithionite.<br>
The reductant in the first electropositive half cell reaction may also be a<br>
metal organic complex capable of changing configuration to release one or more<br>
electrons in a realisation of an increased co-ordination number.<br>
As stated above, the reaction system or half cell reactions in the<br>
enhanced reactor may require or be assisted by the provision of a reactive or catalytic<br>
surface. The reactive or catalytic surface may be or include a half-cell reductant. The<br>
reductant may be capable of partial or total regeneration.<br>
In_ajrujst4JrBferaMy_emhodlmeri^<br>
reactive or catalytic reagent, allowing or facilitating further reactions to take place.<br>
Suitably, the reductant may form a semiconductive material or molecule. Most<br><br>
preferably, a semiconductor crystal may be formed. Such a crystal may be a highly<br>
ordered structure known as a lattice. Such a lattice structure may yield a periodic<br>
potential throughout the material. There may be more than one semiconductor<br>
material species present in the enhanced reactor.<br>
The reduction of the reductant to form the semiconductive material<br>
may preferably enhance the hydrogen production as the semiconductive material may<br>
catalyse further reactions in the enhanced reactor. Suitably, further exothermic<br>
reactions are catalysed. The semiconductor material may be or be produced from a<br>
metal One or more metals may also be present in the enhanced reactor.<br>
The reactor may also experience one or more localised heating effects.<br>
These effects may arise as the temperature at the point of a reaction, that is<br>
microscopically, is typically much higher than the actual temperature of the solution<br>
when considered on a macroscopic level. Thus if a further reaction occurs at the point<br>
of reaction while the temperature is still very high, there may be an increase in the<br>
kinetics of the reaction due to the elevated temperature at the point.<br>
The semiconductor material may possess energy bands consisting of a<br>
large number of closely spaced energy levels. The energy levels in a semiconductor<br>
are generiHy siouped4n Ww&amp;,-»epart*sd-by enetgyfciwi pfr.^B* bdumour of<br>
electrons at the top and bottom of such a band is typically similar to that of a free<br>
electron. However, the electrons may be affected by the presence of the periodic<br>
potential of the semiconductor material.<br>
The reactive properties of a semiconductor are usually dominated by<br>
the highest partially empty band and the lowest partially filled band. Consideration of<br>
these bands only leads to a simplified energy band diagram for semiconductors as<br>
illustrated in Figure 1.<br>
The almost full band may be called the valence band since it is<br>
occupied by valence electrons. The almost empty band can be termed the conduction<br>
band, as electrons may be free to move in mis band and contribute to the conduction<br>
and reactivity of the material.<br>
The simplified energy band diagram in Figure 1 is used to describe<br>
semiconductors. Shown -are., the .valence-and-conduction-bands-as indicated by the<br>
valence band edge, Ev, and the conduction band edge, Ec. The vacuum level, Evuuum,<br>
and the electron affinity, x are also indicated in the figure.<br><br>
Figure 1 identifies the almost-empty conduction band by a horizontal<br>
line. This line indicates the bottom edge of the conduction band and is labelled Ec.<br>
Similarly, the top of the valence band is indicated by a horizontal line labelled Ey. The<br>
energy band gap is located between the two lines, which are separated by the bandgap<br>
energy EB. The distance between the conduction band edge, Ec, and the energy of a<br>
free electron outside the crystal (called the vacuum level labelled Evtcuum) is quantified<br>
by the electron affinity, x mltiplied with the electronic charge q.<br>
The energy bandgap of semiconductors tends to decrease as the<br>
temperature is increased. This behaviour may be better understood if one considers<br>
that the interatomic spacing increases when the amplitude of the atomic vibrations<br>
increases due to the increased thermal energy. Therefore, using steam in the enhanced<br>
reactor with its corresponding increase in temperature, may activate the<br>
semiconductor by decreasing the bandgap.<br>
In a semiconductor, the completely filled band is generally close<br>
enough to the next higher empty band that electrons can make it into the next higher<br>
band. In the almost empty band, electrons are free to move in mis band and contribute<br>
to the conduction of the material, and also to the reactivity of the material.<br>
By nan-owing the enegy bandgap using steam in the enhanced reactor<br>
with its corresponding increase in temperature, this may increase reactivity of the<br>
semiconductor by decreasing the bandgap and allowing the movement of electrons<br>
between the conduction band and the valence band. Partially filled bands do contain<br>
electrons as well as available energy levels at slightly higher energies.<br>
The temperature dependence of me energy bandgap, Et, has been<br>
experimentally determined yielding the following expression for Et as a function of<br>
the temperature, T:<br>
where E/0), a and 0 are the fitting parameters.<br>
The surfaces arid interfaces of semiconductors may therefore typically<br>
contain a large number of combination centers because of the abrupt termination of<br>
the semiconductor crystal, which leaves _large number of ectrically active dangling-<br>
bonds. In addition, the surfaces and interfaces are more likely to contain impurities<br><br>
since they are exposed during the device fabrication process which may further<br>
increase the reactivity of the material.<br>
Preferably, the (water) molecule may be drawn down to the reactive or<br>
catalytic surface rapidly. The H2O molecule may adopt a favourable orientation in the<br>
(001) plane with the oxygen atom pointing towards the surface.<br>
According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention in which a specific catalyst is used, when the oxygen atom is within<br>
approximately about 2.7 Angstrom of a bridging oxide iron on the reactive or catalytic<br>
surface, there may be a strong interaction between the hydrogen of the H2O molecule<br>
and the bridging oxygen of the oxide ion. This hydrogen atom may then be captured<br>
by the bridging oxygen and the hydroxyl remnant of the H2O molecule may adsorb<br>
above the fivefold "cation site".<br>
The enhancement process according to this preferred embodiment may<br>
enhance the number of dissociated H2O molecules adsorbed onto the reactive or<br>
catalytic surface and then release the terminal OH groups as oxygen gas and the<br>
bridging OH groups as hydrogen gas. The terminal OH groups may therefore act as<br>
electron donors.<br>
Whereas the bridging protonated oxide ions act as electron acceptors.<br>
Viz 2e" + Off +H* —* O' + H2	E° = -0.00V.<br>
Suitably, the discharge of the terminal OH group may produce oxygen<br>
gas plus a proton. This proton may men be attracted towards a negative OH bridging<br>
group where reduction produces hydrogen gas and an oxide ion, which remains in the<br>
crystal lattice.<br>
The reactive or catalytic surface of the enhanced reactor may be<br>
capable of regeneration. For example, use of aluminium leads to the formation of<br>
AI3H2O which can in turn be converted into alumina and back to aluminium by<br>
cathodic reduction, producing a metal. Preferably, carbonaceous molecules are not<br>
used in the regeneration so as to minimise the production of carbon monoxide or<br>
carbon dioxide.<br>
The reactive or catalytic-surface may be provided-as-a cathode-screen.<br>
The cathode screen may perform a catalytic function and is used to facilitate electron<br>
transfer in the system, and has the effect of increasing the rate of the reaction. The<br><br>
screen may accept electrons from the electropositive system and transfer these to the<br>
water to a greater rate than would be observed if the electron transfer was only<br>
occurring directly from the electropositive system to the water.<br>
More preferably, the enhanced reactor is an alkaline cell which uses a<br>
mesh cathode to provide electrons for the reduction of water according to the half cell<br>
equation:<br>
2H20 + 2e ~&gt; 20H-+ H2	E° =-0.41 V<br>
said half cell electro-chemical equation being coupled with another half cell reductant<br>
for the production of hydrogen. Desirably, the inert mesh cathode consists of<br>
platinised titanium to assist anodic corrosion thereby aiding electron transfer from the<br>
reductant.<br>
Suitably, the reactions taking place in the enhanced reactor may<br>
proceed at an increased rate due to the heat added by the steam. As the reactions<br>
taking place in the enhanced reactor suitably have a net exothermic value when<br>
considered together, more heat may be produced than is consumed by any<br>
endothermic reactions also taking place in the enhanced reactor. In turn, this net<br>
increase in heat may further increase the rate of the reactions in me enhanced reactor.<br>
•Ktirtitt-fiftiMttt^	of<br>
the value of residual materials in the hydrogen cell at the endpoint of the reaction is<br>
greater than that of the sum of reactants introduced into the cell.<br>
The enhanced reactor of the present invention preferably includes an<br>
associated heat exchange system that can be used to transfer heat from an exothermic<br>
chemical reaction in the cell or control the rate of the exothermic chemical reacn'on(s).<br>
The heat exchange system may operate by condensing the steam produced by the<br>
direct heating of the water in the aqueous system by the reaction. The heat exchange<br>
system may be used for other purposes (eg, domestic heating) or simply as a way of<br>
controlling the rate of reaction in the generator. It is known that increasing<br>
temperature increases the rate of a reaction.<br>
Larger centrally located units for producing and distributing greater<br>
volumes of hydrogen and heat may use a continuous input of chemicals, introduced in<br>
batch -mixtures at regular intervels and from which solution of the value added<br><br>
products can be removed. The recirculated cooling water may be used to replenish the<br><br>
water used up in die production of hydrogen, thus keeping the reaction temperature<br>
high enough to ensure a continuing vigorous reaction.<br>

for generating hydrogen and/or energy, the first part being a primary reaction system<br>

potential to drive said electronegative half cell reaction; selecting a second<br>
electropositive half cell reaction; said first and second electropositive half cell<br>
reactions selected in combination with said electronegative half cell reaction to<br>
produce an increase in hydrogen and/or energy production from water; and combining<br>
said half cell reactions; and the second part including the introduction of steam<br>
produced as a by-product of the first step at elevated temperature and a positive<br>
pressure into an enhanced reactor, wherein a portion of the energy added to the reactor<br>
system by the addition of the steam is used by reaction systems in the reactor to<br>
increase the number of dissociated H2O ions at or near a reactive or catalytic surface.<br>
According to a third aspect, the invention provides an enhanced reactor<br>
including: a reaction system which produces hydrogen from water, a supporting<br>
reactive of catalytic sur&amp;cc on which 1be tiydrogen ovtt&gt;jKrtetttiri is low, thereby<br>

the rate of reaction in the absence of said reactive of catalytic surface.<br>
The reactive of catalytic surface may be or include a cathode surface.<br>

and a means for removing reactants and/or products as a batch process.<br><br>
Brief Description of thejDrawings. u<br>
Various embodiments of the invention will be described with reference<br>
to the following drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a simplified energy band diagram used to describe<br>
semiconductors.<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic flow diagram illustrating a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention in which the steam produced in a primary reactor<br>
is used as a feedstock to an enhanced reactor.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, an enhanced energy<br>
production system is provided.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the cell for carrying out the present invention is an<br>
alkaline cell, which uses an inert mesh cathode to provide electrons for the reduction<br>
of water according to the half cell equation (equation 1) below:<br>
2H2O + 2e" ~&gt; 2OH-+ H2	B° =-0.41 V<br>
This is a well-documented electro-chemical reaction which<br>
theoretically can be coupled with another half cell reductant having an E° value<br>
greater than -0.41 V ia(Met to p»4l^ hyd»g^ How^jv^, ^ tewsticE of the<br>
processes sometimes makes such combinations impracticably slow.<br>
The present invention describes exceptions to the above, which can be<br>
found in the use of binary and ternary hydrides, the amphoteric elements and<br>
electropositive elements in groups one and two of the Periodic Table. In some of these<br>
instances the mesh cathode does not provide galvanic interaction merely acts as a<br>
convenient reaction platform.<br>
The enhanced reactor of the present invention includes a selection of chemicals, which<br>
react with water, the reaction possibly facilitated or enhanced by a reactive or catalytic<br>
surface. The selection of chemicals have a low hydrogen overpotential, thereby<br>
increasing the rate of reaction and subsequent rate of hydrogen generation.<br>
The relevant half cell reactions are:<br><br><br><br>
Generally, one or more further electropositive half cell reactions involving the<br>
oxidation of species selected from Group I or Group H metals, binary hydrides, ternary<br>
hydrides, amphoteric elements, electropositive elements in groups one and two of the<br>
periodic table and chelated transition elements, oxyacids of phosphorus and oxyacids<br>
of sulphur will also take place in the enhanced reactor.<br>
In a highly preferred combinations, the half cell reductant is a binary<br>
and/or ternary hydride, in combination with an amphoteric element. Amphoteric<br>
elements preferred include aluminium, zinc, chromium, gallium and tin. Aluminium is<br>
particularly preferred. Iron can also be used.<br>
The reductant in the first electropositive half cell reaction may also be a<br>
metal organic complex capable of changing configuration to release one or more<br>
electrons in a realisation of an increased co-ordination number.<br>
As stated above, the reaction system or half cell reactions in the<br>
enhanced reactor may require or be assisted by the provision of a reactive or catalytic<br>
surface. The reactive or catalytic surface may be or include a half-cell reductant. The<br>
rwJuctantinay fc» x*psbte <rfpo orto></rfpo>
In a most preferably embodiment, a reductant forms a further reactive<br>
or catalytic reagent, allowing or facilitating further reactions to take place. Suitably,<br>
one or more reductants will form a scmiconductive material or molecule.<br>
The reduction of one or more reductants to form the semiconductive<br>
material may preferably enhance the hydrogen production as the semiconductive<br>
material can catalyse further reactions in the enhanced reactor. Suitably, further<br>
exothermic reactions are catalysed.<br>
The reactions taking place in the enhanced reactor may proceed at an<br>
increased rate due to the heat added by the steam. As me reactions taking place in the<br>
enhanced reactor suitably have a net exothermic value when considered together,<br>
more heat may be produced than is consumed by any endothermic reactions also<br>
taking place in the enhanced reactor. In turn, this net increase in heat may further<br>

The enhanced reactor of the present invention will generally include an<br>
associated heat exchange system that can be used to transfer heat from an exothermic<br>
chemical reaction in the cell or control the rate of the exothermic chemical reaction(s).<br>
The enhanced reactor is configured such that the hydrogen produced<br>
can build up to a pressure such that it can force the aqueous components of the cell<br>
out of contact with the reactive solid components and into a holding reservoir. In this<br>
way, the enhanced reactor can be made self regulating-hydrogen is produced while the<br>
aqueous components are in contact with the reactive solids, but as the hydrogen is<br>
produced, the aqueous components are forced away from the solids by pressurised<br>
hydrogen, thereby resulting in a reduction in hydrogen production. When hydrogen is<br>
drawn off, the pressure is released, allowing the aqueous components to come back<br>
into contact with the solids and causing the reaction to recommence. The hydrogen<br>
can be removed either batobwise, as described above, or in a continuous fashion to<br>
regulate hydrogen production. The reactor size and configuration can be selected<br>
based on the amount of hydrogen production required.<br>
The cathode screen performs a catalytic function and is used to<br>
facilitate electron transfer in the system, and has the effect of increasing the rate of the<br>
ruction. The screen ACCEPTS EFECTRONS FROM THE system end transfers<br>
these to the water to a greater rate than would be observed if the electron transfer was<br>
only occurring directly from the electropositive system to the water.<br>
The enhanced reactor preferably contains a heat exchange coil through<br>
which water is recirculated to condense the steam within the reactor and thus remove<br>
the heat produced during the exothermic reaction. Raschig rings may also be used in<br>
the volume above the reaction area to condense this steam .back into the reaction itself.<br>
In another preferred form, the invention provides a two part process for<br>
generating hydrogen and/or energy, the first part being a primary reaction system<br>
including the sub-steps of selecting an electronegative half cell reaction producing<br>
hydrogen; selecting a first electropositive half cell reaction having a sufficient<br>
potential to drive said electronegative half cell reaction; selecting a second<br>
electropositive half cell reaction; said first and second electropositive half cell<br>
produce an increase in hydrogen and/or energy production from water, and combining<br>
said half cell reactions; and the second part including the introduction of steam<br><br>
produced as a by-product of the first step at elevated temperature and a positive<br>
pressure into an enhanced reactor, wherein a portion of the energy added to the reactor<br>
system by the addition of the steam is used by reaction systems in the reactor to<br>
increase the number of dissociated H2O ions at or near a reactive or catalytic surface.<br>
All Eo values herein are relative to a hydrogen reference.<br>
In the present specification and claims, the word "comprising" and its<br>
derivatives including "comprises" and "comprise1' include each of the stated integers<br>
but does not exclude the inclusion of one or more further integers.<br>
