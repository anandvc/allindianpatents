				<td>FOAMING COMPOSITION FOR HAIR CARE<br>
The present invention, relates to navel foaming<br>
compositions for washing and treating the hair and/or<br>
scalp, comprising at least one active principle chosen<br>
from corticosteroids and retinoids, one anionic<br>
surfactant, one amphoteric surfactant and one<br>
propenetrating agent, and to the treatment process<br>
employing such compositions.<br>
Psoriasis is one of the commonest skin ailments<br>
among all chronic skin diseases. This disease is found<br>
in 1.4 to 2.9% of the population. The scalp is one of<br>
the favored sites for psoriasis; the latter causes<br>
essentially erythemas, desquamations, hyperkeratoses or<br>
pruritides and can also be responsible for a reduction<br>
in hair density. The treatments used to date involve<br>
salicylic acid, local steroids, anthralin, or coal or<br>
wood tar. These treatments are unpleasant, in<br>
particular when tar is applied, and require lengthy<br>
applications, in particular when hair ointments are<br>
used.<br>
For the purpose of improving the quality of<br>
life for the patient, without however decreasing the<br>
therapeutic effect of the treatment, foaming<br>
compositions comprising corticosteroids have been.<br>
developed. More particularly, the application time of<br>
these foaming compositions is reduced with respect to<br>
the, conventional treatment.<br>
Patent BE 84515 discloses a composition<br>
comprising hydrocortisone in a solvent mixture composed<br>
of 15 to 60% of aliphatic alcohol, 15 to 60% of<br>
propylene glycol and of 5 to 60% of a third<br>
solubilizing agent taken from the group consisting of<br>
2-hydroxyethyl salicylate, dipropyl ketone and<br>
dimethylcocobenzylammonium chloride.<br>
Patent EP 0 325 949 discloses a solution<br>
comprising at least 2.5% of corticosteroids, from 25 to<br>
80% of a nonionic surfactant, from 0 to 70% of ethanol.<br>
from 0 to 70% of propylene glycol and an antimicrobial<br>
agent.<br>
Nevertheless, the solvents present in these<br>
compositions have a tendency to evaporate very rapidly.<br>
Furthermore, the fluidity of these compositions renders<br>
the application difficult and it is often necessary to<br>
apply these compositions by rubbing in order to allow<br>
effective penetration of the active principles, the<br>
consequence of which is to irritate the epidermis even<br>
more, or to apply these compositions and to allow them<br>
to act for several hours, which is annoying to the<br>
patient.<br>
To avoid evaporation of the solvent, provision<br>
has been made, in Patent WO 9627376, for a foam<br>
comprising a corticosteroid, a foam-breaking agent, a<br>
propellant and buffer. The foam-breaking agent is<br>
composed of an aliphatic alcohol, of water, of a fatty<br>
alcohol and of a nonionic surfactant. Nevertheless,<br>
when these foams are applied to keratinous fibers,<br>
their resulting esthetic appearance is not satisfactory<br>
and the scalp lying under the keratinous fibers may be<br>
insufficiently treated.<br>
The Applicant Company has looked for<br>
compositions which do not exhibit the abovementioned<br>
disadvantages, that is to say a composition which makes<br>
it possible to improve the penetration of the active<br>
principle while being particularly easy to use and<br>
exhibiting good cosmetic properties.<br>
The Applicant Company has now developed a<br>
foaming composition which exhibits the properties<br>
mentioned above.<br>
The compositions of the present invention,<br>
while making possible good penetration of the active<br>
principles, also exhibit an improvement in the cosmetic<br>
performances of the compositions for the treatment of<br>
skin ailments or of the hair, the compositions of the<br>
invention leaving the hair soft and manageable and not<br>
rendering it greasy. Furthermore, these compositions<br>
are easy to rinse out.<br>
The Applicant Company has also found that the<br>
foaming compositions of the present invention<br>
surprisingly make it possible to obtain a foam which<br>
exhibits improved characteristics of volume and of<br>
compactness with respect to the foaming compositions<br>
for the treatment of skin ailments or of the scalp of<br>
the prior art.<br>
It has also been found that, surprisingly, the<br>
compositions which are subject matters of the present<br>
invention are stable over time, making it possible to<br>
prevent the precipitation of the active principles, and<br>
thus remain clear.<br>
One of the subject matters of the invention is<br>
thus composed of a foaming composition for washing and<br>
treating the hair and/or the scalp.<br>
Another subject matter of the invention is a<br>
process for washing and treating the hair and/or the<br>
scalp employing such a composition.<br>
A subject matter of the invention is also a<br>
composition according to the invention for its<br>
application as medicament.<br>
A subject matter of the invention is also the<br>
use of the compositions of the invention as medicament<br>
and for the manufacture of a medicament intended to<br>
treat skin ailments or hair.<br>
 Other subject matters of the invention will<br>
become apparent on reading the description and the<br>
examples which follow.<br>
The foaming composition for washing and<br>
treating the hair and/or the scalp is essentially<br>
characterized in that it comprises, in an aqueous<br>
medium:<br>

aliphatic radical is a linear or branched chain<br>

Applications FR-A-2,270,846, 2,383,660, 2,598,611,<br>
2,470,596 and 2,519,863.<br>
More generally still, within the meaning of the<br>
present invention, the expression "cationic polymer"<br>
denotes any polymer comprising cationic groups and/or<br>
groups which can be ionized to cationic groups.<br>
The preferred cationic polymers are chosen from<br>
those which comprise units comprising primary,<br>
secondary, tertiary and/or quaternary amine groups,<br>
which can either form part of the main polymer chain or<br>
be carried by a side substituent directly connected to<br>
the latter.<br>
The cationic polymers used generally have a<br>

The quaternized proteins or protein<br>
hydrolysates are in particular chemically modified<br>
polypeptides carrying quaternary ammonium groups at the<br>
chain end or grafted onto the chain. Their molecular<br>
mass can vary, for example, from 1500 to 10,000 and in<br>
particular from 2000 to 5000 approximately. Mention may<br>
in particular be made, among these compounds, of:<br>
collagen hydrolysates carrying triethylammonium<br>
groups, such as the products sold under the name "Quat-<br>
Pro E" by Maybrook and called, in the CTFA dictionary,<br>

Collagen";<br>
animal protein hydrolysates carrying<br>
trimethylbenzylammonium groups, such as the products<br>
sold under the name "Crotein BTA" by Croda and called,<br>
in the CTFA dictionary, "Benzyltrimonium Hydrolyzed<br>
Animal Protein";<br>
protein hydrolysates carrying, on the polypeptide<br>
chain, quaternary ammonium groups comprising at least<br>
one alkyl radical having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms.<br>
Mention may be made, among these protein<br>
hydrolysates, inter alia, of:<br>
"Croquat L", the quaternary ammonium groups of<br>
which comprise a C12 alkyl group;<br>
"Croquat M", the quaternary ammonium groups of<br>
which comprise C10-C18 alkyl groups;<br>
"Croquat S", the quaternary ammonium groups of<br>
which comprise a C18 alkyl group;<br>
"Crotein Q", the quaternary ammonium groups of<br>
which comprise at least one alkyl group having from 1<br>
to 18 carbon atoms.<br>
These various products are sold by Croda.<br>
Other quaternized proteins or hydrolysates are,<br>
for example, those corresponding to the formula:<br>
xn which X xs an anion of an organic or<br>
inorganic acid, A denotes a protein residue derived<br>
from collagen protein hydrolysates, R5 denotes a<br>
lipophilic group comprising up to 30 carbon atoms and<br>
R6 represents an alkylene group having 1 to 6 carbon<br>
atoms. Mention may be made, for example, of the<br>
products sold by Inolex under the name "Lexein QX<br>
3000", called "Cocotrimonium Collagent [sic]<br>
Hydrolysate" in the CTFA dictionary.<br>
Mention may also be made of quaternized plant<br>
proteins, such as wheat, maize or soya proteins:<br>
mention may be made, as quaternized wheat proteins, of<br>
those sold by Croda under the names "Hydrotriticum WQ<br>
or QM", called "Cocodimonium Hydrolysed Wheat Protein"<br>
in the CTFA dictionary, "Hydrotriticum QL", called<br>

dictionary or "Hydrotriticum QS", called "Steardimonium<br>
Hydrolysed Wheat Protein" in the CTFA dictionary.<br>
