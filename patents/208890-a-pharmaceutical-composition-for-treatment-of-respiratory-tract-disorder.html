THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 (39 of 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION See Section 10, rule 13<br><br><br>
ALTANA PHARMA AG of BYK-GULDEN-STRASSE 2, D-78467 KONSTANZ, DEUTSCHLAND, GERMANY, GERMAN Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
New combination<br>
Field of application of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to combinations of pharmaceutically active substances for use in the treatment of respiratory tract disorders.<br>
The substances used in the combinations according to the invention are known active compounds from the PDE4 and PDE3/4 inhibitors class and active compounds from the class of the leukotriene receptor antagonists.<br>
Known technical background<br>
In the International Patent Application WO02/38155 the combined use of Roflumilast, Roflumilast-N-Oxide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of either compound on the one hand and of a leukotriene-receptor antagonist on the other hand for the treatment of bronchial and respiratory disorders is described. In the International Patent Application WO01/90076 a pharmaceutical composition comprising Roflumilast-N-Oxide and a leukotriene receptor antagonist is claimed.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
Asthma is a common inflammatory disease of the respiratory tract, accounting for 1 - 3% of all office visits, 500,000 hospital admissions per year and more pediatric hospital admissions than any other single illness in the US. Annually, more than 5000 children and adults die of asthma attacks in the United States {William E. S.; Goodmann Gilmann A.:The pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9* Edition, pp. 152 &amp;659-682, McGrawHIII, NewYork 1996).<br>
Asthma can no longer be viewed simply as a reversible airway obstruction. It should instead be considered primarily as an inflammatory illness that has bronchial hyperactivity and bronchospasm as its results. Allergen specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) is bound to the mast cells via Fc receptors. It is a fragment obtained by papain digestion of immunoglobulin molecules and contains most of the antigenic determinants. When an allergen comes into contact with IgE, the mast cells are activated and release a number of inflammatory mediators, which include granule contents like histamine, proteases, heparin, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a variety of lipid membrane derived molecules like prostaglandins, leukotrienes and platelet activating factor (PAF), and a number of cytokines like<br>
2<br><br><br>
Interleukin (IL)-1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 and chemokines. An enormous variety of mediators are released which have more than one potent effect on airway inflammation.<br>
As a result of vasodilation, increased vasopermeability and increased endothelial adhesiveness to¬wards leukocytes further leads to an influx of inflammatory cells like lymphocytes, eosinophils and macrophages from blood circulation into the tissues. This in turn" leads to the release of mediators which have further inflammatory effects (Rao A. R. et al. Recent Perspectives in the design of antiasthmatic agents, Pharmazie, 55, 7, 475-482, 2000).<br>
Thus, It can be understood that it is unlikely that drugs affecting a single mediator can satisfactorily treat the disease alone. As asthma is one of the major diseases affecting mankind, there is a need to develop drugs which can affect a wide variety of mediators.<br>
Therefore, it is the object of the present invention to make available respiratory tract therapeutics which fulfil the following conditions:<br>
Favorable simultaneous influence on several of the inflammatory mediators<br>
Marked bronchorelaxation and -dilatation<br>
Good oral availability<br>
Minor side effects<br>
Good suitability for long-term therapy<br>
Favorable Influence on bronchial hyperreactivity<br>
It has now been found that the combined use of a PDE4 or a PDE3/4 inhibitor and a leukotriene re¬ceptor antagonist outstandingly fulfills the above-mentioned conditions.<br>
The invention thus relates to the combined use of a PDE4 or a PDE3/4 inhibitor and a leukotriene receptor antagonist in the treatment of respiratory tract disorders.<br>
"Combined use" in the context of the invention means the simultaneous, sequential or separate administration of the PDE4 or the PDE3/4 inhibitor on the one hand and of the leukotriene receptor antagonist on the other hand.<br>
Simultaneous administration Includes - aside from the simultaneous uptake of two separate dosage forms containing the PDE4 or the PDE3/4 inhibitor in the one and the leukotriene receptor antagonist in the other dosage form - pharmaceutical compositions containing both active ingredients in one single dosage form {fixed unit dose form).<br><br>
3<br><br><br>
Sequential administration in the context of the invention means the administration of the PDE4 or the PDE3/4 inhibitor on the one hand and of the leukotriene receptor antagonist on the other hand in separate dosage forms within less than 12 hours, more preferably within less than one hour, most preferably within 5 minutes or less.<br>
Separate administration within the context of the invention means the administration of the PDE4 or the PDE3/4 inhibitor on the one hand and of the leukotriene receptor antagonist on the other hand in separate dosage forms within 12 hours or more.<br>
"Combined use" in the context of the invention also includes a pharmaceutical product comprising both the PDE4 or the PDE3/4 inhibitor and the leukotriene receptor antagonist as discrete separate dosage forms, in separate containers or e. g. in bfisters containing both types of drugs in discrete solid dosage units, preferably in a form in which the dosage units which have to be taken together or which have to be taken within one day are grouped together in a manner which is convenient for the patient Said pharmaceutical product itself or as a part of a kit may contain instructions for the simultaneous, se¬quential or separate administration of the discrete separate dosage units, to a patient in need thereof.<br>
By the expression "PDE4 inhibitor" is meant a selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, which inhibits preferentially the type 4 phosphodiesterase when compared to other known types of phosphodiester¬ase, e.g. type 1, 2, 3, 5 etc., whereby the compound has a lower IC50 (more potent) for the type 4 phosphodiesterase, such as where the ICM for PDE4 Inhibition is about factor 10 lower compared to ICa, for inhibition of other known type of phosphodiesterase, e.g. type 1, 2, 3, 5 etc.<br>
Analogously, the expression "PDE3/4 inhibitor" is defined. Methods to determine the activity and se¬lectivity of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor are known to the person skilled in the art. In this connection it may be mentioned, for example, the methods described by Thompson et al. (Adv Cycl Nucl Res 10: 69-92, 1979), Giembycz et al. (Br J Pharmacol 118: 1945-1958, 1996) and the phosphodiesterase scintillation proximity assay of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.<br>
By the expression "leukotriene receptor antagonist" is meant leukotriene C4, leukotriene D4 and leu¬kotriene E4 receptor antagonists, of which the leukotriene D4 receptor antagonists are preferred.<br>
As possible PDE4 or PDE3/4 Inhibitors within the meaning of the present invention may be mentioned, by way of example, those PDE4 or PDE3/4 inhibitors which are named expressis verbis as an example, or described or claimed genericaliy in the following patent applications and patents: DE 1545687, DE 2028869, DE 2123328, DE 2315801, DE 2402908, DE 2413935, DE 3900233, EP 0103497, EP 0139464, EP 0158380, EP 0163965, EP 0335386, EP 0389282, EP 0393500, EP 0428302, EP 0435811, EP 0449216, EP 0459505, EP 0470805, EP 0490823,    EP 0506194,<br>

However, in general, satisfactory results will be obtained when the total daily dosage of first active ingredient(s), the PDE4 respectively the PDE3/4 inhibitors, when taken oral is in the range from 1 -2000 ug/kg of body weight. In the case of the particularly preferred PDE4 inhibitor ROFLUMILAST, the dally dosage is in a range from 1 - 20 ug/kg of body weight. The daily dosage for the particularly preferred PDE3/4 inhibitor PUMAFENTRINE is in a range from 300 - 1500 ug/kg of body weight.<br>
The total daily dosage of the second active ingredient(s), the leukotriene receptor antagonists also can vary within a wide range. In the case of the particularly preferred leukotoene receptor antagonist MONTELUKAST, the daily dosage when taken oral is in a range from 50-400 ug/kg of body weight.<br>

Pharmacology Objective:<br>
To assess the additive or synergistic inhibitory effect of the selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor ROFLUMILAST combined with the leukotriene receptor antagonist MONTELUKAST both orally administered 1 h before ovalbumin (OVA) challenge on the early, mainly leukotriene-mediated (SRS-A - slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis) bronchoconstriction in anaesthetized, mechanically ventilated guinea pigs.<br>
Animals:<br>
Male Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs; body weight 200-250 g at sensitization and 350-500 g when performing the experiments.<br>
Drugs, substances and experimental procedure:<br>
Ovalbumin (OVA) was used as allergen for active sensitization. Therefore, 20 kg OVA together with 20 mg AI{OH)3 suspended in 0.5 ml 0.9%NaCl-solution (= saline) were administered l.p. to each animal on 2 consecutive days. After 2-3 weeks the animals were challenged with a single i.v. dose of 0.15 mg/kg OA suspended in saline. Drugs were suspended in a 4%-methocei-solution and administered p.o. by gavage to the conscious animals (n = 10 animals per dose) 1 h before OVA-challenge:<br>
1)	ROFLUMILAST (3-cyclopropy]methoxy-4-difluoromethoxy-N-(3,5-dichloropyrid-4-yl)-ben2arni-de) at doses of 0.01, 0.1,1.0, and 3.0 pmol/kg (0.004, 0.04, 0.4, and 1.2 mg/kg)<br>
2)	MONTELUKAST sodium salt 2-[1-[1(R)-[3-[2{E)-(7-chloroquinolin-2-yl)vinyl]phenyl]-3-[2-(1-hy-droxy-1-methylethyl)phenyl]propylsulfanylmethyl]cyclopropyl]acetic acid sodium salt) at doses of 0.03, 0.10, 0.17, and 0.5 umol/kg (0.018, 0.06, 0.1, and 0.3 mg/kg)<br>
3)	ROFLUMILAST at doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 umol/kg (0.04, 0.12, and 0.4 mg/kg) in combination with MONTELUKAST sodium salt 0.03 pmol/kg (0.018 mg/kg)<br>
Controls received the drug-free methocel-solution 1 h before OVA-challenge as placebo (n = 12). OVA-challenge and lung function measurements were performed in anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated animals. Urethane was used for anesthesia and was injected i.p. at a dose of 1.5 g/kg as 12.5 % solution about 50 min before OVA-challenge. To abolish spontaneous breathing, animats received 1.5 mg/kg i.v. of the muscle relaxant pancuronium bromide about 14 min before OVA-challenge. To enhance the SRS-A-mediated bronchoconstriction, the animals were pretreated with: Indomethacin 10 mg/kg i.v. 20 min before OVA-challenge to block the cyclooxygenase pathway and to enhance the production of lipoxygenase-mediators, mainly leukotrienes. Pvrllamine 2 mg/kg i.v. 6 min before OVA-challenge to inhibit the bronchoconstrictor effect of endogenously liberated histamine.<br>
26<br><br>
Propranolol 0.1  mg/kg i.v. 5 min before OVA-challenge to abolish endogenous adrenergic tonus. Administration volume was 1 ml/kg for ail i.v. injected compounds.<br>
Measurement of the SRS-A-mediated bronchoconstrictlon:<br>
After Injection of the muscle relaxant, the animals were ventilated at 60 breaths/min, 7 ml/kg tidal volume and 40/60% inspiration/expiration ratio using a small animal Ventilator. Dynamic lung compliance and airway conductance (=1/resistance) were calculated breath-by-breath from tidal volume and pulmonary inflation pressure and from flow and pulmonary inflation pressure, respectively, using a PC-based software program for analysis, data acquisition and archiving of the respiratory and cardiovascular parameters. The SRS-A-mediated bronchoconstriction was induced by i.v. injection of OVA. This was characterized by a decrease of compliance and conductance, which started about 1 min after OVA-injection and reached a plateau at 70-90% decrease after 4-6 min. The time-effect curve for the delta-%-decrease of compliance and conductance was determined up to 12 min post challenge. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored to control vitality.<br>
Data analysis:<br>
The area under the time-delta-%-decrease curves (AUC) was determined for each animal. On basis of the AUC-values, the inhibition of the SRS-A-induced decrease of compliance and conductance was calculated in reference to placebo. After eliminating drop-outs (Grubb's-test), dose-response curves were established, principally based on log-linear regression analysis, to determine ED50-values. Pharmacodynamic effect of ROFLUMILAST combined with MONTELUKAST sodium salt was measu-red and compared with the calculated effects according to G. Poch [1]. Measured and calculated ED50-values were compared by an unpaired t-test for statistical significant differences.<br>
Results:<br>
1)	ROFLUMILAST inhibited decrease of airway conductance with an ED50 of 0.69 mg/kg (1.73 umol/kg) and airway compliance with an ED50 of 0.58 umol/kg (1.45 mg/kg) (Fig. 1 and 2).<br>
2)	MONTELUKAST sodium salt inhibited decrease of airway conductance with an ED50 of 0.055 mg/kg (0.090 umol/kg) and airway compliance with an ED50 of 0.053 umol/kg (0.086 mg/kg) (Fig. 3 and 4).<br>
3)	ROFLUMILAST combined with MONTELUKAST sodium salt 0.018 mg/kg (0.030 umol/kg) inhibited decrease of airway conductance with an ED50 of 0.07 mg/kg (0.18 umol/kg) and airway compliance with an ED50 of 0.08 umol/kg (0.19 mg/kg) respectively. (Fig. 5 and 6)<br>
4)	 if one calculates the ED50 values according to the method described by G. Pdch {1] for ROFLUMILAST combined with MONTELUKAST sodium salt 0.018 mg/kg (0.030 umol/kg) on the basis of the values given in 1) and 2) the ED50 values come out as follows: ED50 = 0.15<br>
27<br><br><br>
mg/kg (0.38 \poml/kg} for airway conductance and ED50 = 0.11  (0.28 pmol/kg) for airway compliance (Fig. 5 and 6). 5) Measured ED50$are not significantly different from calculated ED50s.<br>
Summary:<br>
Inhibitory   effects   of   ROFLUMILAST   and   MONTELUKAST   sodium   salt   on   SRS-A-lnduced bronchoconstriction are additive.<br>
