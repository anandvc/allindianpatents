				<td>Bending  device   for  two  working  rolls  of  a  rolling  stand<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a bending device for two working rolls of a rolling stand having guide blocks provided in lateral roll housings for two vertically adjustable pressure-transmission bodies, on which the working rolls are supported via chocks, and having bending cylinders which are arranged in pairs between the pressure-transmission bodies and have a piston rod acting on one pressure-transmission body and a cylinder formed or held by the respective other pressure-transmission body, the pressure-transmission bodies being supported on the respective guide  block  in  a   sliding  manner.<br>
Bending devices for axially displaceable working rolls of a rolling stand of this type are already known for example from EP   0   256   408   A2   and  DE   199   38   217   A1.<br>
According to EP 0 256 408 A2, chocks receiving the working rolls are supported on a guide projection of pressure-transmission bodies arranged in pairs via a respective sliding surface arranged halfway up. A bending cylinder which acts between the pressure-transmission bodies arranged in pairs can be used to displace the pressure-transmission bodies vertically to one another. In order vertically to guide the pressure-transmission bodies, guide blocks form lateral guide webs which are surrounded by the pressure-transmission bodies. Guide blocks and guide webs are covered in the support regions over their  entire  area  by  wearing  plates   forming  sliding  surfaces.<br>
A bending device (L-block) for working rolls of a rolling stand is known from DE 199 38 217 Al, which device comprises two pressure-transmission     bodies     which     are     L-shaped     in     their<br>
configuration, interact in a pair and between which a bending cylinder acts to generate roll bending forces. The pressure-transmission bodies are guided vertically while being supported in a guide block, the guide block being covered in the regions of contact with the pressure-transmission bodies over its entire area by wearing plates forming sliding surfaces. Loading of the bending cylinders, which are set apart from one another, leads to an eccentric introduction of force into the pressure-transmission bodies. The forces of reaction from the tilting moment result, depending on the tilting direction on opposing wearing  plates  on  the  upper  and  lower<br>
wearing    plate     edge     thereof, in     locally    limited    very    high<br>
pressure.    The   necessary   platebetween   the   guide   block   and   the<br>
pressure-transmission bodies forms the basis of this edge<br>
effect.<br>
The invention is thus based on the object of configuring a bending device for the working rolls of a rolling stand of the type described at the outset in such a way that forces of reaction acting transversely to the plane of movement of the pressure-transmission bodies as a result of tilting positions of the pressure-transmission bodies can be diverted into the guide  block  independently  of  the   edge  pressure.<br>
The invention achieves the object set as a result of the fact that the pressure-transmission bodies are supported on the respective guide block in a sliding manner by self-adjusting wearing plates. Thus, the wearing plates rest against the corresponding support surface over their entire area and the production of local edge pressure is entirely avoided as a result of an approximately uniform distribution of loads. This leads to significant lengthening of the service life of the wearing plates, wherein this measure is expected to lengthen the service life threefold. The abutment of the wearing plates over their entire area also eliminates in the edge region of the wearing plates any lubrication problems which are otherwise intensified in the event of non-uniform surface loading and wedge gap formation resulting therefrom as a result of the flowing-away of the lubricant from regions having high surface pressure.<br>
According    to    an	expedient    configuration,     the    self-adjusting<br>
wearing      plates	have      a      planar      sliding      surface      and      a<br>
cylindrically   or	spherically   shaped   support   surface.    In   this<br>
case,    the   planar	sliding   surface   of   the   wearing   plate   rests<br>
against a guide surface of the pressure-transmission body in a sliding manner and the cylindrically or spherically shaped support surface of the wearing plate is pivotably supported on a correspondingly configured, cylindrically or spherically configured  mating  support   surface  of  the  guide  block.<br>
The extension in terms of area of the sliding surface of the wearing plates is selected in such a way that the maximum occurring surface pressure does not exceed, assuming a uniformly distributed tilting force onto the entire sliding surface, approximately half, preferably one third, of the admissible surface pressure. The higher this arithmetically maximum surface pressure is if the pairing of materials remains unaltered,   the  shorter  the  service  life  to  be  expected  will  be.<br>
Constant or intermittent lubrication of the sliding surface and the support surface of the wearing plates is required to ensure the necessary movability of the wearing plates. At least one outlet opening of a lubricant supply line is associated with both the sliding surface and the support surface of each self-adjusting wearing plate, wherein these outlet openings preferably each open into the sliding surface and the support surface. Expediently, the lubricant supply line is guided to the respective wearing plate through the guide block. These lubricant supply lines are advantageously arranged in such a way that at least one respective outlet opening of a common lubricant supply line is associated with the sliding surface and the support surface of the self-adjusting wearing plate, the lubricant supply line penetrating the wearing plate between the support surface and the sliding surface. To ensure uniform distribution of lubricant, lubricant channels are incorporated into the sliding surface and the support surface of the wearing plates.<br>
The spacing of the wearing plates on the vertically arranged leg of the pressure-transmission bodies (lever arm of the tilting forces on the guide block) is selected in such a way that lubricant channels never lie exposed during operation of the  bending  block.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the wearing plate is equipped with a cylindrical support surface. A radius midpoint on a longitudinal axis of the wearing plate is associated with this cylindrical support surface which in cross section forms an image of an arc of a circle. The mounting, and if necessary additional fastening of the wearing plate, is carried out on a likewise cylindrically configured mating support surface on the guide block. The radius midpoints of the cylindrical support surface   of  the   web  plate   and  of   the   cylindrical  mating   support<br><br>
surface of the guide block preferably both lie on a common longitudinal axis, thus allowing (slight) rotational movement about this longitudinal axis. This longitudinal axis preferably lies outside the wearing plate. The longitudinal axis is oriented normally to the axes of rotation of the working rolls. The rotational movement is of an order of magnitude of approximately  1/10°.<br>
A state of equilibrium, in which the resulting tilting force onto the sliding surface of the wearing plate acts at only a short distance from the center of the sliding surface, is established as a function of friction and lubrication at the cylindrical support surface of the wearing plate, which is supplied with lubricant via a centrally incorporated lubrication  pocket,   and  of  the<br>
friction and lubrication of the sliding surface of the wearing plate. The smaller the radius of the circle can be selected, the better the self-adjusting effect of the wearing plate will be, although as the radius decreases, the tilting force surface pressure  rises.<br>
Spherical supporting of the wearing plate by a spherical cap-shaped support surface is expedient above all when there is a likelihood of tilting movements of the pressure-transmission bodies in a second normal plane or of considerable deformation of the guide block, especially when said deformation reaches an order of magnitude at which slight plastic deformation occurs on  circular   segment-shaped/cylindrical  wearing  strips.<br>
In particular for fixing the position of the wearing plates during the assembly of the individual components, it is expedient if the wearing plate is secured in the guide block receiving the mating support surface by a fastening element allowing a pivoting movement of the wearing plate relative to the guide block. This fastening element can be formed by a screw which is sunk in the planar sliding surface of the wearing plate but causes merely loose positioning of the wearing  plate  and  in  no  way  positional  fixing  thereof.<br>
In the case of a slight tilting position of the pressure-transmission bodies too, constant abutment of all self-adjusting wearing plates against the vertical support surfaces of the pressure-transmission bodies is necessary to ensure optimum lubrication of the wearing plates. For this purpose, between the self-adjusting wearing plate and the guide block supporting the wearing plate, a spreading element resting against or acting on the wearing plate and on the guide block is arranged in a recess. Expediently, this spreading element is formed    by    a    leaf    spring    which    generates    a    spreading    force<br>
between the wearing plate and the guide block, so that the contact between the wearing plate and the pressure-transmission body  is  maintained  at  all  times.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the bending device, the pressure-transmission bodies which interact in pairs are L-shaped in their configuration with a longer vertical and a shorter horizontal leg and the legs of the pressure-transmission bodies oppose one another in pairs substantially in a plane parallel to the working rolls. All vertical support surfaces of the pressure-transmission bodies arranged in normal planes vertical to the plane receiving the working rolls are supported  exclusively  by  self-adjusting<br>
wearing plates. The horizontal and the vertical leg can also be of  the  same  length.<br>

Fig. 5b shows the second embodiment of the bending device in a retracted  operating  position.<br>
Functionally equivalent components are denoted in the embodiments described hereinafter in each case by the same reference  numeral.<br>
As illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, working rolls 1, which can be driven so as to rotate about axes of rotation la, of a rolling stand (not shown in greater detail) are mounted at their ends in chocks 2 which can be adjusted vertically in the window of the lateral roll housings 3 in order on the one hand to be able to set a predetermined strip thickness and on the other hand to influence via the vertical adjustment the bending course of the working rolls 1, in particular in relation to axial displacement of the working rolls relative to the support rolls (not shown in the present document). The bending course of the working rolls 1 is influenced with the aid of a bending device consisting substantially of pressure-transmission bodies 4a, 4b which are arranged in pairs and between which bending cylinders 5 are arranged. The pressure-transmission bodies 4a, 4b,   which  are   arranged  in  pairs   on  both  sides  of  the<br>
chocks  2,   are  mounted  in  a  respective  guide  block  6   so  as  to  be<br>
vertically   displaceable   on   wearing   plates   7   which   self-adjust<br>
in    their   vertical    orientation    or    on    vertical    guides    7a.    As<br>
Figure   2   shows   in  particular,   the   guide  blocks   6   are   laterally<br>
fastened  in  windows   of  the  roll  housing   3  and  form  two  parallel<br>
vertical   guides   7a   for   the   pressure-transmission   bodies   4a,    4b<br>
which   are   L-shaped  with   a   longer   vertical   leg   8   and   a   shorter<br>
horizontal   leg   9.   The   arrangement   is   in   this   case  made   in   such<br>
a  way  that  the   legs   8   and  9  of  the  pressure-transmission  bodies<br>
4a  and  4b  oppose  one  another  in  pairs,   as  may  be   seen  in  Figure<br>
1.    The   legs   8   and   9   of   the   pressure-transmission   bodies   4a   and<br>
4b   are  provided  with   a   rectangular   or   square   cross   section   and<br>
lie    substantially    in    a    common    center    plane    parallel    to    the<br>
working   roll   plane   receiving   the   axes   of   rotation   la   of   the<br>
working   rolls   1.    The   cylinders   10   of   the   bending   cylinders   5<br>
can   accordingly   be   formed   in   a   simple   manner   by   the   vertical<br>
leg    8    of    the    two    pressure-transmission    bodies    4a,     4b.     The<br>
piston    rod    12,    which    is    provided   with   a    piston    11,     of    the<br>
bending   cylinders   5   penetrates   a   cylinder   cover   13   and  engages<br>
with    a    receiving    recess    14    in    the    horizontal    leg    9    of    the<br>
respective     other     pressure-transmission     body     4b     or     4a.      A<br>
pressure  piece   15   inserted  into   the   receiving   recess   14   serves<br>
to  transmit  the  bending  forces.   The  piston  rod  12   is   secured  in<br>
the    receiving    recess    14    in    a    tension-resistant   manner   by    a<br>
locking   bolt    16   which   engages   perpendicularly   to   the   piston<br>
rod<br>
The two bending cylinders 5, which are arranged in pairs and associated with the pressure-transmission bodies 4a and 4b, lie, in a common plane corresponding to the plane of the diagram of Figure 1, set horizontally apart from each other and generate a tilting moment when they are subjected to pressure in this plane owing to the possible eccentric introduction of bending   force,    the    tilting    forces,    which    act    in    each   pair,<br>
being diverted into the guide block 6 and the roll housing 3 via the self-adjusting wearing plates 7. In the plane of the diagram of Figure 2, there is only very slight non-uniform surface loading on the vertical guides 7a as a result of forces of reaction which are diverted onto the guide block 6 via the pressure-transmission bodies 4a and 4b. Both the vertical guides 7a, which are shown in Figure 2 over their entire area, and the self-adjusting wearing plates 7 shown in Figure 1 can be used for this purpose. Arranged along the long vertical leg 8 of the pressure-transmission bodies 4a and 4b are two self-adjusting wearing plates 7 and along the comparatively short horizontal legs 8 of the pressure-transmission bodies a self-adjusting  wearing  plate  7.<br><br>
Fig.    3    shows    the    self-adjusting   wearing   plate    7    which   rests flat  with   a  planar   sliding   surface   17   against   a   vertical   guide surface      18      of     the     pressure-transmission     body     4a     and     is supported     with     a     cylindrically     shaped     support     surface     19 against   a  mating   support   surface   20   of   the   guide   block   6   so   as to   be   able   to   pivot   about   a   radius   midpoint   21.    The   sliding surface   17   of   the   self-adjusting   wearing   plate   7   is   square   or rectangular   in   its   formation   and   the   supporting   surface   19   is formed     by     a     portion     of     a     circularly     cylindrical     lateral surface.      A      lubrication      pocket      22,       starting      from     which sufficient    lubrication    is    ensured    for    the    movement    of    the adjustment  of  the  wearing  plate   onto  the  vertical   guide   surface 18   of   the   pressure-transmission   body   4a,    is   incorporated   into the    cylindrically    shaped    support    surface    19    of    the    wearing plate   7.   The  wearing  plate   7   is   fastened  to  a   fastening  element 23,      which     is      shown     as     a      screw,      without      impairing     the operationally  desired  rotational  movement  on  the   guide  block   6, but      easy      integration      and      detachment      of      the      pressure-transmission  bodies   is   allowed.<br>
Figure 3 also permits in the selected view a further geometrical embodiment of the self-adjusting wearing plate. The wearing plate 7 is equipped with a spherically configured support surface 19 which is part of a sphere surface which is supported on a likewise spherically shaped mating support surface 20 of the guide block 6 so as to be able to pivot about a radius midpoint in two normal directions and thus spatially ensures the planar abutment of the sliding surface of the wearing plate. The planar sliding surface 17 of the self-adjusting wearing plate is in this case preferably circular in its   formation.<br>
Figures    4a    to    4d    show    further    advantageous    designs    of    the wearing   plate,    especially   for    intensive   lubrication   thereof.<br>
Lubricant supply lines 25 are incorporated, as shown in Figures 1 and 2, into the guide block 6 in the form of bores and open, Starting from a central lubricant supply unit (not shown) or easily accessible lubricating nipple, into the mating support surfaces 20 of the guide blocks 6. These lubricant supply lines 25 subsequently penetrate the wearing plate 7 and connect the cylindrical support surface 19 to the planar sliding surface 17. Fig. 4a shows, starting from the outlet openings of two lubricant supply lines 25, lubricant channels 26 which are incorporated into the sliding surface 17, extend over the sliding surface 17 in the manner of lattice-type grids and thus ensure uniform supply of lubricant at the entire sliding surface. At the cylindrically formed support surface 19, the lubricant channels open into conical lubrication pockets 22 which  merge  with  a  groove-like<br>
recess 27. The recess 27 receives a spreading element 28 which is configured as a leaf spring (Fig. 4d), rests on the one hand against the base of the recess 27 and on the other hand against the guide block 6 and generates a spreading force which presses the wearing plate away from the guide block 6 and presses it again the guide surface 18 of the pressure-transmission bodies 4a,   4b.<br>
A bending means which is known to specialists as a T-block and is eguipped with the wearing plates according to the invention is shown in schematic views in Figure 5a in an extended operating position and in Figure 5b in a retracted operating position. These two operating positions are defined by the maximum possible path of vertical displacement of the two pressure-transmission bodies 4a and 4b which are T-shaped in their configuration. The pressure-transmission bodies 4a and 4b are guided vertically in a guide block 6, the bending cylinders 5 each acting on the horizontal legs 9 of the pressure-transmission bodies and being embedded in receiving recesses 14 of the guide block 6. The pressure-transmission bodies 4a and 4b are vertically guided on the guide block 6 by self-adjusting wearing plates 7 which are configured in their design and with regard to the supply of lubricant similarly to the wearing plates   according  to  the  views   in  Figures   1  to   4.<br>
The invention is not restricted to the illustrated embodiments. Equally, the self-adjusting wearing plates can for example rest with the sliding surface against a vertical guide surface of the guide block and be supported with the cylindrically spherically shaped support surface in a mating support surface on  the  pressure-transmission  body.<br><br><br><br><br>
