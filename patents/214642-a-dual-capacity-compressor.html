				<td>A DUAL CAPACITY COMPRESSOR<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a dual capacity compressor for compressing a<br>
working fluid, such as refrigerant, to a required pressure, and more particularly, to a<br>
compressor of which compression capacity changes with a direction of rotation.<br>
Background Art<br>
The dual capacity compressor is a kind of reciprocating type compressor of<br>
which piston stroke and compression capacity changes with rotation directions of a<br>
motor and a crankshaft, which is made by means of an eccentric sleeve rotatably<br>
coupled with a crank pin of a crankshaft. Since the dual capacity compressor has a<br>
compression capacity that can be changed depending on a required load, the dual<br>
compressor is used widely in apparatuses which require compression of working fluid,<br>
particularly in home appliances operative in a refrigeration cycle, such as a refrigerator,<br>
for enhancing an operation efficiency. A US. Patent 4,236,874 discloses a general dual<br>
capacity compressor, referring to which a related art dual capacity compressor will be<br>
described, briefly.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a section of a dual capacity compressor disclosed in the US<br>
Patent 4,236,S74, and FIG. 2 illustrates operation of the dual capacity compressor,<br>
schematically.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the dual capacity compressor is provided with a piston 7<br>
in a cylinder 8, a crankshaft 1, a crank pin 3 having an axis 3a eccentric from an axis<br>
la of the crankshaft 1, an eccentric ring 4 coupled with the crank pin 3, and a<br>
connecting rod 6 connected between the eccentric ring 4 and the piston 7, as key<br>
components. The eccentric ring 4 and the connecting rod 6 are rotatable with respect to<br><br>
each other, as well as the axis 3a of the crank pin. There are release areas 9 in contact<br>
surfaces of the crank pin 3 and the eccentric ring 4 respectively, and a key 5 for<br>
coupling the crank pin 3 with the eccentric ring 4 in the release areas. The operation of<br>
the dual capacity compressor with respect to the compression capacity will be<br>
?v*<br>
described. As shown in FIG. 2, in the dual capacity compressor, a stroke of the piston 7<br>
is regulated by an eccentricity varied with a position of the eccentric ring 4, wherein, if<br>
a large capacity is required, the crank shaft 1 is rotated in a clockwise direction<br>
(regular direction) and, if a small capacity is required, the crank shaft 1 is rotated in a<br>
counter clockwise direction (reverse direction). In detail, FIG. 2A illustrates a moment<br>
the piston 7 is at a top dead center during a clockwise direction rotation, and FIG. 2B<br>
illustrates a moment the piston 7 is at a bottom dead center during a clockwise<br>
direction rotation, when the stroke Lmax is the greatest because the eccentricity is the<br>
greatest. FIG. 2C illustrates a moment the piston 7 is at a bottom dead center during a<br>
counter clockwise direction rotation, and FIG. 2D illustrates a moment the piston 7 is<br>
at a top dead center during a counter clockwise direction rotation, when the stroke<br>
Lmin is the smallest because the eccentricity is the smallest.<br>
However, during the foregoing operation, the crank pin 3 and the eccentric<br>
ring 4 are involved in centrifugal forces, respectively caused by their rotation around<br>
the axis 1a of the crank shaft, exerting on an extension line between the shaft axis la<br>
and the pin axis 3a, and between the shaft axis 1a to the a center of gravity of the ring<br>
4a, respectively. Therefore, different from FIGS. 2A and 2B, in cases of FIGS. 2C and<br>
2D, as lines of actions are not on the same line, a local rotating moment is taken place<br>
at the eccentric ring 4 with respect to the pin 3 as a product of a vertical distance "d" to<br>
the pin 3 and its own centrifugal force, acting in a direction the same with a direction<br>
(counter clockwise direction) of rotation of the crank shaft 1. Since the crank pin 3 and<br><br>
the eccentric ring 4 are members that can make relative motion to each other, the<br>
rotating moment causes a relative rotation of the eccentric ring 4 in a direction of<br>
rotation of the crank shaft 1, releasing the key 5 both from the crank pin 3 and the<br>
eccentric ring 4, and leaving the eccentric ring 4 and the key 5 to move in the rotation<br>
direction as shown in dashed lines in FIG. 3. Moreover, as shown in FIG. 3. for an<br>
example, during clockwise direction operation, a pressure "P" (a pressure of re-<br>
expansion of the working fluid) in the cylinder after compression pushes the eccentric<br>
ring 4 to a direction of rotation of the crank shaft 1, to cause the eccentric ring 4 to<br>
make a relative rotation with respect to the crank pin 3 in a rotation direction of the<br>
crank shaft. At the end, such a relative rotation makes operation of the compressor<br>
unstable, to fail to obtain a desired compression performance.<br>
In fact, the relative rotation is occurred because the key 5 fails to hold both the<br>
crank pin 3 and the eccentric ring, perfectly. The key 5 rolls within the release area<br>
whenever the direction of rotation of the crank shaft is changed, to cause serious wear<br>
at respective contact surfaces, that shortens a lifetime of the compressor.<br>
Other than the USP 4,236,874, there are many patent publications that disclose<br>
technologies of the dual capacity compressors, which will be described, briefly.<br>
Similarly, USP 4,479,419 discloses a dual capacity compressor provided with<br>
a crank pin, eccentric cam and a key. The key is fixed to the eccentric cam, and moves<br>
along a track in a crank pin when a direction of rotation of the compressor is changed.<br>
However, since the key can not hold both the crank pin and the eccentric cam,<br>
positively, the USP 4,479,419 also has unstable operation caused by the relative<br>
rotation.<br>
USP 5,951,261 discloses a compressor having an eccentric part with an inside<br>
diameter of bore formed across the eccentric part, and an eccentric cam with another<br><br>
bore with an inside diameter the same with the eccentric part formed in one side<br>
thereof. A pin is provided to the bore in the eccentric part, and a compression spring is<br>
provided in the bore in the eccentric sleeve. Accordingly, when the bores are aligned<br>
during rotation, the pin moves into the bore in the cam by a centrifugal force, to hold<br>
the eccentric part and the eccentric cam, together. However, in the USP 5,951,261,<br>
since the eccentric cam is provided with only one bore therein, the eccentric part and<br>
the eccentric cam can hold together only when the compressor rotates in a particular<br>
direction. Moreover, an operative reliability can not be secured, since an exact<br>
movement of the pin from the eccentric part to the cam through the bores difficult.<br>
In the meantime, basically, each of the dual capacity compressors described<br>
before employs eccentric members, such as an eccentric ring and an eccentric cam, and<br>
changes a stroke distance " of the piston and the compression capacity with<br>
eccentricities of the eccentric members. Because relative arrangements of the eccentric<br>
members with members around the eccentric members change with the rotation<br>
directions of the compressor, the change of the eccentricity takes place. Therefore, for<br>
causing an appropriate amount of change of the eccentricity, it is also important to<br>
arrange the eccentric members at required positions accurately before the perfect<br>
coupling of the eccentric members.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a dual capacity compressor<br>
which can maintain a constant eccentricity and make a stable operation even if the<br>
compressor is rotated in any directions that have different compression capacity.<br>
As described, the inventor understands that the unstable operation of the dual<br>
capacity compressor is caused by a local centrifugal force of the eccentric sleeve, and<br>
an external load thtough the connecting rod and etc., during operation. Though such<br><br>
causes are not avoidable as far as an eccentric mechanism is used, the inventor<br>
understand that, if the crank pin and the eccentric sleeve can be coupled positively<br>
during operation, such a problem can be solved. Taking an idea of a key member that<br>
has such a coupling feature, the key member and members related thereto are modified<br>
to prevent the relative rotation between the crank pin and the eccentric sleeve.<br>
Moreover, as known, the eccentricity and the stroke distance of the piston vary<br>
with direct, or relative rotation to other adjoining members, of the eccentric sleeve.<br>
Therefore, the inventor modifies the compressor further such that the eccentric sleeve<br>
rotates smoothly, and arranged accurately in view of an operative reliability of the<br>
compressor.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a dual capacity compressor<br>
including a power generating part including a reversible motor and a crank shaft<br>
inserted in the motor, a compression part having a cylinder, a piston in the cylinder,<br>
and a connecting rod connected to the piston, a crank pin in an upper part of the crank<br>
shaft eccentric to an axis of the crank shaft, an eccentric sleeve having an inside<br>
circumferential surface rotatably fitted to an outside circumferential surface of the<br>
crank pin, and an outside circumferential surface rotatably fitted to an end of the<br>
connecting rod, a key member for positive fastening of the eccentric sleeve to the<br>
crank pin in all rotation directions of the motor, and an eccentric mass provided to the<br>
eccentric sleeve for rotating the eccentric sleeve around the crank pin.<br>
The key member holds the eccentric sleeve at a plurality of points, and more<br>
preferably the key member holds the eccentric sleeve at two points set up with<br>
reference to a center line in any direction during operation.<br>
The components will be described in more detail.<br>
The crank pin includes one pair of key member fitting parts formed opposite<br><br>
to each other.<br>
The crank pin further includes at least one first oil supply hole for supplying<br>
oil between the eccentric sleeve and the crank pin, and the first oil supply hole is<br>
formed in the crank shaft so as to be in communication with an oil passage for<br>
supplying oil to various moving parts of the compressor. Preferably, the crank pin has<br>
one pair of first oil supply holes formed in the crank pin opposite to each other.<br>
The eccentric sleeve includes a track part formed along a circumference<br>
thereof for enabling rotation of the eccentric sleeve itself relative to the projection of<br>
the key member, and a limiting part formed relative to the track part for limiting<br>
rotation of the projection of the key member. The track part of the eccentric sleeve is a<br>
cut away part cut along a circumferential direction at a depth from a top thereof, or a<br>
pass through hole extended along a circumferential direction to a length at a depth<br>
from the top thereof.<br>
Preferably, the steps formed between the track part and the limiting part is<br>
parallel to an extension line connecting an axis of the crank shaft and an axis of the<br>
crank pin, and more preferably, the step is spaced apart from an extension line<br>
connecting the axis of the crank shaft and the axis of the crank pin as much as a<br>
distance equal to a half of a thickness of the key member.<br>
The eccentric sleeve further includes at least one second oil supply hole in<br>
communication with the first oil supply hole in the crank pin. The eccentric sleeve<br>
further includes oil cavities formed in an outside circumferential surface thereof<br>
around the second oil supply hole, and an oil groove extended from the second oil<br>
supply hole vertically in the outside circumferential surface.<br>
The key member includes a first projection for projecting a length from the<br>
crank pin and engaging with the step of the eccentric sleeve, a first stopper for limiting<br><br>
the length of projection of the first projection, and a second projection for projecting<br>
in a direction opposite to the first projection and engaging with the step on the other<br>
side of the eccentric sleeve during rotation.<br>
Preferably, the key member further includes an elastic member for being<br>
inserted on the second projection and supporting the first projection so that the first<br>
projection is projected continuously regardless of an operation state of the compressor.<br>
Preferably, the key member further includes a second stopper for limiting a length of<br>
projection of the second projection from the crank pin depending on a direction of the<br>
centrifugal force.<br>
The eccentric mass rotates the eccentric sleeve so as to be held at a part of the<br>
key member, and generates a rotation moment with a centrifugal force for rotating the<br>
eccentric sleeve.<br>
Preferably, the eccentric mass rotates the eccentric sleeve in a direction the<br>
same with a relative friction generated at the eccentric sleeve, and in a direction<br>
opposite to a rotation direction of the crank shaft. The eccentric mass is provided to a<br>
part of the eccentric sleeve, of which weight is light relatively, and preferably adjacent<br>
to the track part of the eccentric sleeve.<br>
The eccentric sleeve is a plate member provided to the outside circumferential<br>
surface of the eccentric sleeve on an upper part of the eccentric sleeve. The eccentric<br>
mass is formed as one unit with the eccentric sleeve, or formed separate from the<br>
eccentric sleeve, and fixed to the eccentric sleeve.<br>
Thus, the dual capacity compressor of the present invention prevents the<br>
relative rotation between the crank, pin and the eccentric sleeye, permitting a stable<br>
operationo of the compressor and an improvement of an efficiency. The eccentric sleeve<br>
is arranged accurately to provide a desired eccentricity, to secure an operation<br><br>
reliability of the compressor, as well.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In<br>
describing the embodiments of the present invention, same parts will be given the<br>
same names and reference symbols, and repetitive descriptions of which will be<br>
omitted. An overall structure of the dual capacity compressor of the present invention<br>
will be described, with reference to FIG. 4.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the dual capacity compressor of the present invention<br>
includes a power generating part 20 in a lower portion of the compressor for<br>
generating and transmitting a required power, and a compression part 30 over the<br>
power generating part 20 for compressing working fluid by using the power. Moreover,<br><br>
in addition to these general parts, the dual capacity compressor includes a stroke<br>
changing part 40 connected between the power generating part 20 and the compression<br>
part 30 for varying a compression capacity of the compression part 30 during operation.<br>
In the meantime, there is a shell which encloses the power generating part 20 and the<br>
compression part 30 for preventing refrigerant from leaking, and there is a frame 12<br>
elastically supported on a plurality of supporting members (i.e., springs) attached to an<br>
inside of the shell. There are a refrigerant inlet 13 and a refrigerant outlet 15 fitted to,<br>
and in communication with an inside of the shell.<br>
The power generating part 20 under the frame 12 includes a motor with a<br>
stator 21 and rotator 22 for generating a rotating force by an external electrical power,<br>
and a crank shaft 23. The motor is reversible. The crank shaft 23 has a lower part<br>
inserted in the rotator 22 for transmission of a power, and oil holes or grooves for<br>
supplying lubrication oil held in the lower part to driving parts.<br>
The compression part 30 is mounted on the frame 12 over the power<br>
generating part 20, and includes a mechanical driving part for compression of the<br>
refrigerant, and a suction and discharge valves for assisting the driving part. In addition<br>
to a cylinder 32 that actually forms a compression space, the driving part has a piston<br>
31 for reciprocating in the cylinder 32, and a connecting rod 33 for transmission of<br>
reciprocating power to the piston 31. The valves receive and discharge refrigerant<br>
to/from the cylinder 32 in association with a cylinder head 34 and the head cover 35.<br>
The stroke changing part 40 of the dual capacity compressor of the present<br>
invention will be described in detail, while description of the power generating part<br>
and the compression part, which are identical to the related art, are omitted.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5A, on the whole, the stroke changing part 40 includes a<br>
crank pin 110 on top of, and in eccentric to, the crank shaft, an eccentric sleeve 120<br><br>
rotatably fitted between an outside circumferential surface of the crank pin 110 and<br>
the connecting rod 33, and a key member 130 fitted in the crank pin 110. The key<br>
member 130holds the positions of the crank pin 110 and the eccentric sleeve 120 with<br>
respect to each other during operation of the compressor. In the stroke changing part<br>
40, the eccentric sleeve 120 is arranged, and rotated so that an effective eccentricity<br>
thereof changes with rotation directions (regular or reverse direction) of the motor. For<br>
maintaining such a changed effective eccentricity, the key member 130 is held at the<br>
eccentric sleeve 120. Therefore, if the rotation direction of the motor changes by the<br>
stroke changing part 40, basically a stroke length of the connecting rod and a<br>
displacement of the piston change with the change of the effective eccentricity, and<br>
according to this the compression capacity also changes depending on the rotation<br>
direction. The stroke changing part 40 of the present invention described briefly will<br>
be described in more detail, with reference to the attached drawings.<br>
FIGS. 5A and 5B illustrate side and plan views of dual capacity compressors<br>
of the present invention respectively, wherein components thereof are shown in<br>
assembled states with partial sections for easy description and clarity. FIGS. 6A ~ 12<br>
illustrate the components, separately.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5A, the crank pin 110 is hollow partially, for fitting the key<br>
member 130 in the hollow, movably. The crank pin 110 also has one pair of key<br>
member fitting parts 111 formed opposite to each other, and an oil passage 112 and at<br>
least one oil supply hole 113 in a low part.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 5A and 5B, the fitting parts 111a and 111b are formed in<br>
the hollow tube part so as to be disposed in a vertical plane containing the crank shaft<br>
axis 23a and the crank pin axis 110a. Accordingly, the key member 130 in the fitting<br>
parts 111a and 111b are influenced from a centrifugal force F exerting on the extension<br><br>
line between the axes 23a and 110a along a longitudinal direction of the key member<br>
130. The key member 130 is movable by the centrifugal force F guided by the fitting<br>
parts 111a and 111b. As shown in FIG. 6A, the fitting parts 111a and 111b may<br>
actually form a pass through hole. The fitting parts 111 of the pass through hole can<br>
prevent the key member 130 from falling off during operation. Preferably, as shown in<br>
FIG. 6B, at least one of the fitting parts 111a and 111b may be a slot extended from a<br>
top end of a wall of the crank pin 110 to a position, for easy fitting of the key member<br>
130 to the crank pin 110. It is more preferable that there is a seat part 111c at an end of<br>
the fitting part for stable fitting of the key member 130.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5A, the oil passage 112 is in communication both with the<br>
oil groove in outside surface of the crank shaft 23, and the first oil supply hole 113.<br>
The first oil supply hole 113 may be a through hole in any position" of the crank pin<br>
110. However, if the oil supply hole 113 is formed parallel to the fitting parts 111a and<br>
111b, i.e., along an extension line connecting the fitting parts 111a and 111b, the oil<br>
supply hole, 113 can reduce strength of the crank pin, significantly. Therefore, as<br>
shown in FIGS. 7C and 7D, the oil supply hole 113 is formed in a direction<br>
perpendicular to the extension line connecting the fitting parts 111a and 111b (i.e., an<br>
extension line between the axes 23a and 110a in FIG. 5B). Moreover, it is preferable<br>
that one pair of the first oil supply holes 113 are formed opposite to each other for<br>
uniform supply of lubricating oil between the crank pin 110 and the eccentric sleeve<br>
120. The lubrication oil on the bottom of the compressor is at first passed through the<br>
oil groove and the oil passage 112, and sprayed from an upper end of the oil passage<br>
112 so as to be supplied between contact surfaces of the components during operation<br>
for prevention of wear and smooth operation of the components, and may be supplied<br>
from the oil passage 112 to a gap between the crank pin 110 and the eccentric sleeve<br><br>
120 directly through the oil supply hole 113. Preferably, the crank pin 110 is formed<br>
higher than the eccentric sleeve 120, for spraying the lubrication oil to the components<br>
evenly from a high position.<br>
The eccentric sleeve 120 basically has an inside circumferential surface<br>
rotatably coupled to an outside circumferential surface of the crank pin 110, and an<br>
outside circumferential surface rotatably coupled to an end of the connecting rod 33. In<br>
more detail, as shown in 7A, the eccentric sleeve 120 includes a track part 121 formed<br>
along a circumference thereof, and a limiting part 122 for limiting a track of the track<br>
part 121. There are two steps 123a and 123b between the track part 121 and the<br>
limiting part 122. As shown in FIG. 5A, since at least a part of the key member 130 is<br>
projected so as to be held at the eccentric sleeve 120 when the compressor is not in<br>
operation, the track part 121 makes such a rotation of the eccentric sleeve 120 itself<br>
relative to the key member possible. That is, the eccentric sleeve 120 can rotate round<br>
the crank pin 110 as much as a range the track part 120 is formed therein. Opposite to<br>
the track part 121, the limiting part 122 limits rotation of the sleeve itself together with<br>
the key member 130 during stoppage and movement. Actually, the key member 130 is<br>
held at the steps 123a and 123b.<br>
In the eccentric sleeve 120, the track part 121 may be a cut away part cut along<br>
a circumference direction starting from a top end of the eccentric sleeve 120 to a<br>
required depth, actually. As shown in FIGS. 5B and 7B, the steps 123a and 123b are<br>
formed in parallel to an extension line between the crank shaft axis 23a and the crank<br>
pin axis 110a. That is, the steps 123a and 123b are actually formed in parallel to an<br>
extension line between a maximum thickness and a minimum thickness of the<br>
eccentric sleeve to have different widths, and the extension line is on the extension line<br>
between the axes 23a and 110a during operation of the compressor. In other words, the<br><br>
steps 123a and 123b are positioned on an extension line parallel to the extension line<br>
of the axes 23a and 110a at the same time. Consequently, the key member 130<br>
disposed on the same extension line can be held at both of the steps 123a and 123b,<br>
such that the steps 123a and 123b form common contact surfaces for the key member<br>
130, actually. Preferably, the steps 123a and 123b are spaced away from the extension<br>
line between the axes 23a and 110a by a half of a thickness "t" of the key member 130.<br>
According to this, the key member 130 can be held at the steps 123a and 123b more<br>
stably and accurately. On the other hand, the steps 123a and 123b may be formed to<br>
have slopes respectively each at an angle with respect to the extension line between the<br>
axes 23a and 110a. In more detail, the steps 123c and 123d may be formed in a radial<br>
direction extension line from the crank pin axis 110a sloped at an angle 9 with respect<br>
to the extension line between the axes 23a and 110a. Also, the steps 123e and 123f<br>
may be sloped at an angle toward the limiting part centered on a cross point with an<br>
inside circumferential surface of the crank pin 110. Even in above cases, the steps 123c,<br>
123d, 123e and 123f have common contact points with the key member 130, to enable<br>
engagement with each other. Moreover, the track part 121 may be, not only the cut<br>
away part as shown in FIG. 7A, but also a pass through hole extended to a length along<br>
a circumferential direction at a depth from the top end of the sleeve 120 as shown in<br>
FIG. 7E. The track part 121 of such a pass through hole holds the key member 130 so<br>
as not to break ay/ay in a vertical direction.<br>
Other than this, referring to FIGS. 7C and 7D, the eccentric sleeve 120 may<br>
further include a second oil supply hole 124 formed at a height. The second oil supply<br>
hole 124 is formed to be in communication with the first oil supply hole 113 in the<br>
crank pin 110 when the compressor is in operation. In more detail, the key member<br>
130 keeps holding the eccentric sleeve 120 when the compressor of the present<br><br>
invention is in operation. Therefore, as shown, it is basically preferable that the<br>
second oil supply hole 124 is in communication with the first oil supply hole 113 when<br>
the key member 130 holds the eccentric sleeve 110. Moreover, as described before,<br>
since the first oil supply hole 113 is perpendicular to the key member 130, it is<br>
required that the second oil supply hole 124 also perpendicular to the steps 123a and<br>
123b in contact with the key member 130 for communication with the first oil supply<br>
hole 113. Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 7C, the eccentric sleeve 120 is arranged<br>
oppositely with reference to the key member 130 every time the rotation direction of<br>
the crank shaft changes, for changing eccentricity of the eccentric sleeve 120.<br>
Therefore, it is useful that the eccentric sleeve 120 has another second oil supply hole<br>
124 opposite to the one second oil supply hole 124 in communication with the first oil<br>
supply hole 113. That is, the eccentric sleeve 120 becomes to have one pair of second<br>
oil holes 124 formed oppositely. At the end, either one of the two second oil supply<br>
holes 124 is in communication with the first oil supply hole 113 regardless of rotation<br>
direction when the compressor is in operation. The second oil supply holes keep in<br>
communication with the first oil supply hole 133, selectively depending on directions<br>
of rotation of the compressor. Therefore, the lubricating oil can be supplied to a gap<br>
between the eccentric sleeve 120 and the connecting rod 33, continuously during<br>
operation. In addition to this, a depth of oil cavity 124a is formed around the second oil<br>
supply hole 124, for forming a stand-by space for distributing the oil around the<br>
second oil supply hole 124, thereby making supply of lubrication oil between the<br>
eccentric sleeve 120 and the connecting rod 33 easy. Moreover, there is an oil groove<br>
124b formed in an outside circumferential surface of the eccentric sleeve 120 extended<br>
in a vertical direction so as to be in communication with the second oil supply hole 124,<br>
 so that the lubricating oil reaches to a top end, and a bottom end of the outside<br><br>
circumferential surface of the eccentric sleeve 120 from the secpnd oil supply hole<br>
124 along the oil groove 124b. According to this, the lubricating oil can be supplied<br>
between the eccentric sleeve 120 and the connecting rod 33, uniformly.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7A again, preferably, the steps 123a and 123b between the<br>
track part 121 and the limiting part 122 are rounded. In more detail, as shown, there is<br>
a round portion 125 between the steps 123a and the track part 122. The key member<br>
130 is supported on the round portion 125 when the key member 130 is held at the<br>
eccentric sleeve 120. A curvature of the round portion 125 is formed such that the<br>
round portion 125 comes into contact with the key member 130 in an area as large as<br>
possible. According to this, the key member 130 can be stably held at the eccentric<br>
sleeve 120 by the round portion 125. Moreover, owing to the round portion 125, the<br>
key member 130 can make, not point to point contact, but surface to surface contact,<br>
with the eccentric sleeve 120. Moreover, the round portion 125 strengthens the steps<br>
123a and the 123b, actually. Therefore, even if the key member 130 and the eccentric<br>
sleeve 120 are brought into repetitive, and continual contact during operation of the<br>
compressor, neither the key member 130, nor the eccentric sleeve 120, is not broken<br>
due to stress concentration and fatigue caused thereby.<br>
FIGS. 5A, 5B, or 8 illustrate the key member 130 in detail. As shown,<br>
basically the key member 130 has a first projection 131 to be projected for a length<br>
from the crank pin 110 even when the compressor is not in operation, and a second<br>
projection 132 to be projected for a length from the crank pin 110 when the<br>
compressor is in operation. The key member 130 also has a first stopper 133 for<br>
limiting a projection length of the first projection 131. Together with this, the key<br>
member 130 has an elastic member 140 for regulating a position of the key member<br>
130 during the compressor is stopped or in operation. In the present invention, the key<br><br>
member 130 holds the eccentric sleeve 120 while the key member 130 is moved by<br>
the centrifugal force. Especially, as described before, the second projection 132 holds<br>
 the eccentric sleeve 12.0 as the second projection 132 is projected during operation. For<br>
being projected by the centrifugal force generated during operation, it is required that<br>
the second projection 132 is directed to the same direction with a direction of the<br>
centrifugal force. Therefore, as shown, while the second projection 132 is positioned at<br>
outer sides of radii of the crank shaft 23 and the crank pin 110 relatively, the first<br>
projection 131 is positioned at inner sides of radii of the crank shaft 23 and the crank<br>
pin 110. In other words, actually, the second projection 132 is arranged in the crank pin<br>
110 spaced away from the axis 23a of the crank shaft for receiving a great centrifugal<br>
force, and relative to this, the first projection 131 is arranged adjacent to the center.<br>
Moreover, in order for the first and second projections 131 and 132 to hold the<br>
eccentric sleeve 120 at the same time when the compressor is in operation, it is<br>
preferable that the key member 130 has a length greater than an outside diameter of the<br>
crank pin 110.<br>
In more detail, referring to FIG. 5A, the first projection 131 is projected from<br>
the crank pin 110 and engaged with one of the steps 123a and 123b regardless of<br>
operation state (stop or in operation) of the compressor, and maintains an engaged state<br>
even during operation of the compressor. For this, the elastic member 140 is fitted on<br>
the second projection 132 and supports the first stopper 133 elastically, together with<br>
an inside wall of the crank pin 110. A length of the projection of the first projection is<br>
limited as the first stopper 133 of the key member 130 interferes with the inside wall of<br>
the crank pin 110. For more stable operation, it is preferable that the length of the first<br>
projection is at least a. half of a minimum width of the steps 123a and 123b. Also, as<br>
described before, since the first projection 131 is positioned at an inner side of a radial<br><br>
direction of the crank shaft 23 and the crank pin 110, the first projection 131 is<br>
projected toward the inner side of the radial direction, i.e., the axis 23a of the crank<br>
shaft, continuously. Therefore, the key member 130 is held at at least a part of the<br>
eccentric sleeve 120 relatively positioned at the inner side of radial direction of the<br>
crank shaft 23, always.<br>
The second projection is projected in a direction opposite to the first projection,<br>
to engage with the other step during operation. According to this, the first and second<br>
projections 131 and 132 of the key member 130 engage with the eccentric sleeve 120<br>
at the same time. The centrifugal force along the key member 130 becomes the greater<br>
gradually as the rotation speed of the crank shaft 23 becomes the faster to overcome<br>
the elastic force of the elastic member 140. According to this, the second projection is<br>
moved and projected in a direction of the centrifugal force (i.e., in a direction of an<br>
extension line between the axes 23a and 110a). In this instance, the eccentric sleeve<br>
120 rotates round the crank pin 110 for changing eccentricity when the compressor<br>
changes a direction of rotation. Therefore, in order not to interfere the rotation of the<br>
eccentric sleeve 120, it is required that the second projection 132 has a length a tip of<br>
which does not project beyond an outside circumference of the crank pin 110 when the<br>
compressor is not in operation.<br>
The first and second projections 131 and 132 are engaged with the steps 123a<br>
and 123b alternately depending on the rotation direction of the crank shaft. Since the<br>
key member 130 is arranged on the extension line between the axes 23a and 110a or at<br>
least parallel thereto, respective contact positions of the key member 130 to the steps<br>
123a and 123b differ if thickness "t1" and "t2" of the first and second projections differ.<br>
Therefore, the thickness "t1" and "t2" of the first and second projections 131 and 132<br>
are required to have the same thickness for accurate engagement with the steps 123a<br><br>
and 123b. Though a section of the key member 130 is circular in the drawing and<br>
description of the present invention, any form of the section, such as square or<br>
hexagonal, as faras"that canrnakeengagement with the steps 123a and 123b, may be<br>
used.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, a contact surface 133a of the first stopper 133 may have a<br>
form fit to an inside circumferential surface of the crank pin 100. According to this, the<br>
key member 130 can be engaged with the crank pin 110 exactly, and can make more<br>
smooth operation owing to an increased weight thereof (i.e., an increased centrifugal<br>
force makes an easy projection of the second projection 132). Preferably, the first<br>
stopper 133 may further include a recess 133b for making stable reception of the<br>
elastic member 140. Such contact surface 133a and the recess 133b supplement stable<br>
operation of the key member 230, actually. In the meantime, the first stopper 133 may<br>
be formed as a unit with the key member 130, or separately to be fitted to the key<br>
member 130. Examples of such separate type first stopper 133 are shown in FIGS. 10A<br>
and 10B.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10A, the first stopper 133 may include projections 133a<br>
extended inward in a radial direction. According to this, the first stopper 133 is fitted<br>
to the key member 130 as the projections 133a are inserted in a circumferential groove<br>
in a position of the key member 130. Or, as shown in FIG. 10B, the first stopper 133 of<br>
a simple ring member may be fastened to a position of the key member 130 with a<br>
fastening member. These separate type stoppers 133 enable fitting of the key member<br>
130 to the crank pin 130 even when both of the key member fitting parts 111a and<br>
111b are through holes. In more detail, by placing the stopper 133 on an inside of the<br>
crank pin 110, and inserting the key member 130 through the through holes, the<br>
stopper 133 and the key member 130 are engaged.<br><br>
In the meantime, as described before, in the key member 130, the projection<br>
length of the second projection 132 in the key member 130 can be regulated by the<br>
elastic force of the elastic member 140 during regular operation. However, the<br>
transient sharp acceleration of the crank shaft 23 and the crank pin 110 at starting of<br>
the compressor causes a substantially great momentary centrifugal force exerted on the<br>
key member 130. It is liable that the second projection 132 is projected excessively by<br>
the centrifugal force enough to cause the first projection 131 broken away from the<br>
fitting part 111. Therefore, it is preferable that the key member 130 further includes a<br>
second stopper 134 for limiting the projection length of the second projection 133<br>
beyond the crank pin 110 by the centrifugal force.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11A, the second stopper 134 may be a hollow tube member<br>
134a movably fitted on the second projection 132 in a length direction of the second<br>
projection 132. In this instance, the elastic member 140 is arranged between the second<br>
stopper 134a and the second projection 132. The second stopper 134a comes into<br>
contact both with the first stopper 133 and an inside wall of the crank pin 110 when the<br>
key member 130 moves in a direction of the centrifugal force, thereby preventing the<br>
second projection 133 from being projected more than a certain length. As shown in<br>
FIG. 11B, the second stopper 134 may be an extension 134b having a thickness at least<br>
greater than a thickness of the second projection 133. That is, the second stopper 134b<br>
in FIG. 11B is a lengthwise extension of the first stopper 133, actually. In this case, the<br>
elastic member 140 is fitted on an outside circumference of the second stopper 134b.<br>
Or, as shown in FIG. 11C, the second stopper 134 may be a radial direction extension<br>
134c of the second projection to a required thickness, having a form similar to the first<br>
stopper 133, actually. In this case, the elastic member 140 is fitted between the second<br>
stopper 134b and the inside circumferential surface of the crank pin 110. Similar to<br><br>
variations to the first stopper 133 described with reference to FIGS. 10A and 10B,<br>
the stoppers 134b and 134c may be separate members fixed to the key member 130,<br>
respectively.:<br>
In summary, basically the key member 130 has a length greater than a<br>
diameter of the crank pin by at least a predetermined amount, and is movably fitted in<br>
the crank pin. At least a part of the key member 130 (i.e., the first projection) is<br>
projected from the crank pin even if the compressor is not in operation, and the other<br>
part thereof (the second projection) is projected from the crank pin 110 by the<br>
centrifugal force during the compressor is in operation. That is, the key member 130 is<br>
held at least at a part of the eccentric sleeve 120 continuously, and held at the eccentric<br>
sleeve 120 additionally when the compressor is in operation. Therefore, the key<br>
member 130 is in contact with the eccentric sleeve 120 at a plurality of points, and<br>
more particularly, the key member 130 is in contact with opposite ends of the eccentric<br>
member 120 set up with reference to a center line of any direction at the same time<br>
during operation, actually. Eventually, the key member 130 makes the eccentric sleeve<br>
120 coupled with the rotating crank pin 110 positively in any direction rotation of the<br>
motor, thereby preventing the eccentric sleeve 120 and the crank pin 110 from moving<br>
relative to each other.<br>
In the meantime, if the rotation direction of the crank shaft 23 changes, the<br>
eccentric sleeve 120 rotates around the crank pin 110 to change eccentricity and the<br>
piston stroke distance and the compression capacity. As shown in FIG. 12B, when the<br>
crank shaft 23 starts to turn, a friction force "f" is generated between the crank pin 110<br>
rotated with the crank shaft 23 and the connecting rod 33 stationary relative to the<br>
crank pin 110, i.e., on the eccentric sleeve 120 in a direction (a clockwise direction<br>
when the drawing is seen from above) opposite to the rotation direction (an anti-<br><br>
clockwise direction when the drawing is seen from above) of the crank shaft 23. In<br>
general, the rotation of the eccentric sleeve 120 is caused by such a relative friction<br>
force "f" until one of the steps 123a or 123b of the eccentric sleeve is brought into-<br>
contact with the first projection 131 from the key member. However, such a relative<br>
friction force "f" overcomes friction forces between the eccentric sleeve 120 and the<br>
connecting rod 33, and between the eccentric sleeve 120 and the crank pin 110, and<br>
exerts on the eccentric sleeve 120. Due to this, the relative rotation force may not be<br>
enough to rotate the eccentric sleeve 120 smoothly depending on operation conditions.<br>
For an example, if supply of the lubricating oil between the crank pin 110, the<br>
eccentric sleeve 120, and the connecting rod 33 are not enough, friction forces between<br>
the members 110, 120, and 33 increase, such that the relative friction force "f" can not<br>
rotate the eccentric sleeve 120. Or, if an abnormal external force exerts on the eccentric<br>
sleeve 120 through the connecting rod 33, the relative friction force "f" can not<br>
overcome the external force enough to rotate the eccentric sleeve 120.<br>
In those cases, the eccentric sleeve 120 can not be arranged at an accurate<br>
position to generate a required eccentricity change, failing in obtaining desired two<br>
different compression capacities. That is, the eccentric sleeve 120 fails to rotate<br>
adequately such that one of the steps 123a and the 123b is held at the first projection<br>
131, leading the second projection 132 to fail in holding the other step, and thereby<br>
holding the eccentric sleeve 120, positively. Therefore, in the present invention, an<br>
eccentric mass 200 configured to make smooth rotation of the eccentric sleeve 120 is<br>
provided to the eccentric sleeve 120.<br>
Referring to FIG. 12A, the eccentric sleeve 200 is eccentric to the eccentric<br>
 sleeve 120, and, therefore, has an eccentric center of gravity G. When the crank shaft<br>
 23 starts to turn, a centrifugal force "C" exerts on the center of gravity "G" along an<br><br>
extension line between the axis 23a of the crank shaft and the center of gravity "G"<br>
Since the center of gravity "G" is spaced significantly far from the axis 23a of the crank<br>
pin which is a center of rotation of the eccentric sleeve 120, a length "d" of an arm is<br>
perpendicular to the extension line from the axis 23a of the crank pin. Therefore, the<br>
centrifugal force "C" generates a local rotation moment "M" owing to the length "d" of<br>
the arm, to rotate the eccentric sleeve 120 in a clockwise direction. The rotation<br>
moment "M" caused by the eccentric mass 200 is substantially great, enough to rotate<br>
the crank sleeve 120 around the crank pin 110 stably even under any external<br>
disturbance. Accordingly, the eccentric sleeve 120 keeps rotating, to be held at the key<br>
member 130, more precisely, at the first projection 131, and produce an accurate<br>
eccentricity required for the change of the compression capacity. Alternatively, as<br>
shown in a dashed line, the eccentric mass 200 may be arranged at the eccentric sleeve<br>
120, symmetrically. In this case too, when the crank shaft 23 starts to turn, a<br>
centrifugal force "C" exerts on a center of gravity "G", and rotation moment "M" is<br>
generated owing to a length "d" of an arm. Alikely, the rotation moment "M" rotates<br>
the eccentric sleeve 120 stably, such that the sleeve 120 is held at the first projection<br>
131 of the key member. Therefore, even if the eccentric mass 200 is arranged at any<br>
part of the eccentric sleeve 120, the eccentric mass 200 generates the rotation moment,<br>
and rotates the eccentric sleeve 120.<br>
As described before, referring to FIG. 12B, the friction force "f" exerts on the<br>
eccentric sleeve 120 during rotation of the crank shaft 23. If a direction of the friction<br>
force "f" is opposite to the direction of the rotation moment "M", the friction force "f"<br>
offsets the rotation moment "M", resulting to interfere rotation of the eccentric sleeve.<br>
Therefore, it is preferable that the eccentric mass 200 is arranged at the eccentric<br>
sleeve 120 such that the eccentric mass 200 generates the rotation moment "M" in a<br><br>
direction the same with the friction force "f". That is, in a preferred embodiment of .<br>
the present invention, the eccentric mass 200 is configured to rotate the eccentric<br>
sleeve 120 in a direction the same with the direction of the friction force "f". Moreover,<br>
since the friction force "f" exerts in a direction opposite to the rotation direction of the<br>
crank shaft 23, preferably, the eccentric mass 200 rotates the eccentric sleeve 120 in a<br>
direction opposite to a direction of rotation of the crank shaft 23.<br>
Moreover, as shown, the eccentric sleeve 120 has an eccentric center "Gs".of<br>
gravity, not only owing to its own non-uniform thickness, but also owing to the track<br>
part 121 formed by cutting out. That is, the center of gravity "Gs" is positioned on the<br>
limiting part 122 that is heavier. Therefore, during rotation of the crank shaft 23, a<br>
centrifugal force "Cs" exerts on an extension line between the center of gravity "Gs" of<br>
the eccentric sleeve 120 and the axis 23a of the crank shaft. Due to the eccentricity of<br>
the center of gravity "Gs", the centrifugal force "C generates a rotation moment "Ms"<br>
caused by a perpendicular distance between the extension line and the axis 110a of the<br>
crank pin 110a, i.e., a length "ds" of an arm. The rotation moment "Ms" always exerts<br>
in a direction the same with a rotation direction of the crank shaft 23. That is, as shown<br>
in FIG. 12B, during anti-clockwise direction rotation of the crank shaft 23, the rotation<br>
moment "Ms" is generated at the eccentric sleeve 120 in the anti-clockwise direction<br>
by the center of gravity "Gs". Furthermore, though not shown, during clockwise<br>
direction rotation of the crank shaft 23, a rotation moment "Ms" is generated in the<br>
clockwise direction. As described, the friction force "f" rotates the eccentric sleeve 120<br>
in a direction opposite to the rotation direction of the compressor, until the eccentric<br>
sleeve 120 is held at the first projection 131. However, the rotation moment Ms tends<br>
to rotate the eccentric sleeve 120 in the rotation direction of the compressor. Even<br>
when the moment "M" caused by the eccentric mass 200 exerts on the eccentric sleeve<br><br>
120, the moment "Ms" rotates the eccentric sleeve 120 in a direction opposite to the<br>
direction of rotation caused by the eccentric mass 200, finely and intermittently.<br>
Therefore; the fine rotation of the eccentric sleeve 120 interferes the projection and<br>
holding of the second projection 132 for perfect holding of the eccentric sleeve 120.<br>
Since such an unstable action is caused by unbalance of weight of the eccentric sleeve<br>
120, it is preferable that the eccentric mass 200 is arranged at a light part of the<br>
eccentric sleeve 120. That is, as shown in FIG. 12B, the eccentric sleeve 200 is<br>
arranged adjacent to the track part 121. Such eccentric mass 200 shifts the center of<br>
gravity "Gs" of the eccentric sleeve 120 to a position adjacent to the axis 110a of the<br>
crank pin, and minimizes the length ds of the arm, to eliminate an influence of the<br>
rotation moment "Ms" from the eccentric sleeve 120. According to this, fine rotation of<br>
the eccentric sleeve 120 is prevented, making the second projection 132 held at the<br>
eccentric sleeve 120, more stably, by its own centrifugal force "F". Moreover, as shown,<br>
the eccentric mass 200 at the limiting part 121 generates a rotation moment in a<br>
direction the same with a direction of the friction force "f", i.e., opposite to the rotation<br>
direction of the crank shaft 23, to rotate the eccentric sleeve 120. Therefore, the<br>
eccentric sleeve 200 at the limiting part 121 is the most preferable in the rotation of the<br>
eccentric sleeve 120 to an accurate position, and sustaining the eccentric sleeve 120 to<br>
be at the accurate position.<br>
The eccentric mass 200 may be arranged at any position as far as the eccentric<br>
mass 200 can generate the rotation moment by means of the centrifugal force. For an<br>
example, an eccentric mass of a great specific gravity may be provided in a hole<br>
formed in the eccentric sleeve 120. However, such a provision of the eccentric sleeve<br>
requires a larger eccentric sleeve 120, resulting to increase other members engaged<br>
with the eccentric sleeve 120. Therefore, preferably, as shown in FIG. 5A, the<br><br>
eccentric mass 200 is arranged on an outside circumferential surface of the eccentric<br>
sleeve 120, which is made of a thin plate member for avoiding interference with other<br>
adjacent members. The eccentric mass 200 may be formed as one unit with the<br>
eccentric sleeve 120, when the eccentric mass 200 is an extension from the outside<br>
circumferential surface of the eccentric sleeve 120. Or, the eccentric mass 200 may be<br>
formed separate from the eccentric sleeve 120, and fixed to the outside circumferential<br>
surface of the eccentric sleeve 120. The eccentric mass 200 may be arranged on or<br>
under the eccentric sleeve 120 without interference with the connecting rod 33.<br>
However, as shown in FIG. 5A, the eccentric mass 200 on the eccentric sleeve 120 can<br>
prevent the connecting rod 33 from breaking away upward from the eccentric sleeve<br>
120.<br>
The operation of the dual capacity compressor will be described with<br>
reference to the attached drawings. FIGS. 13A and 13B illustrate plan views each<br>
showing operation of the dual capacity compressor of the present invention in a<br>
clockwise rotation thereof, and FIGS. 14A and 14B illustrate plan views each showing<br>
operation of the dual capacity compressor of the present invention in an anti-clockwise<br>
rotation thereof.<br>
FIG. 13A illustrates a plan view showing relative positions of the key member<br>
130 and the eccentric sleeve 120 when the crank shaft 23 starts to turn in a regular, i.e.,<br>
the clockwise direction. As described, the first projection 131 is always projected<br>
beyond the crank pin 110 to an inward radial direction of the crank pin 110 by the<br>
elastic force. When the crank shaft 23 starts to rotate in the clockwise direction in a<br>
state the first projection 131 is projected, the crank pin, the eccentric sleeve, and the<br>
key member 110, 120, and 130 are start to revolve around the axis of the crank shaft.<br>
During the revolution, the relative friction force "f" is generated between the crank pin<br><br>
110 and the connecting rod 33 in a direction opposite to the rotation direction of the<br>
crank shaft. The eccentric sleeve 120 rotates around the crank pin 110a in an anti-<br>
clockwise direction by the friction force "f". At the same time with this, the rotation<br>
moment "M" is generated by the centrifugal force "C" generated at the center of gravity<br>
"G" of the eccentric mass 200, and rotates the eccentric sleeve 120 in the anti-<br>
clockwise direction more smoothly, together with the friction force T. According to<br>
this, the step 123b on the thin side of the eccentric sleeve is held at the projected first<br>
projection 131, positively. Once the crank shaft 23 rotates, since the friction force "f"<br>
and the rotation moment "M" are generated continuously, the holding between the first<br>
projection 131 and the step 123 is continued. As shown in FIG. 13B, if rotation speed<br>
reaches to a certain level, the key member 130 moves following the extension line<br>
between the axes 23a, and 110a by the centrifugal force "F". According to this, the<br>
second projection 132 engages with the step 123a on the thick side, while the contact<br>
between the first projection 131 and the step 123b is maintained. This simultaneous<br>
multi-point contact enables the key member 130 to make a positive engagement with<br>
the eccentric sleeve 120. Therefore, in the regular direction rotation, even if the<br>
external force "P" coming from re-expansion of the working fluid after compression, or<br>
other force is applied through the connecting rod 33, the relative rotation between the<br>
crank pin 210 and the eccentric sleeve 220 is prevented. Even if there is a local<br>
rotation moment generated at the eccentric sleeve 120, the relative rotation of the<br>
eccentric sleeve 110 with respect to the crank pin 110 can be prevented. As shown in<br>
FIG. 13B, a solid line part in the drawing illustrates a top dead center state, a dashed<br>
line part in the drawing illustrates a bottom dead center state, and the eccentric sleeve<br>
120 arranged such that the eccentric sleeve 120 generates a maximum eccentricity<br>
between a piston (not shown) connected to the connecting rod 33 and the crank pin 110<br><br>
in the case of regular direction rotation. According to this, the piston reciprocates a<br>
maximum stroke length Lmax, and the compressor of the present invention has the<br>
maximum compression capacity.<br>
In the meantime, when the crank shaft 23 starts to turn in the reverse, i.e., in<br>
the anti-clockwise direction, the relative friction force "f" is generated between the<br>
crank pin 110 and the connecting rod 33 in a direction opposite to the rotation direction,<br>
i.e., in the clockwise direction, to generate the rotation moment "M" in a direction the<br>
same with the eccentric mass 200. The eccentric sleeve 120 rotates in the clockwise<br>
direction around the axis 110a of the crank pin starting from a position shown in FIG.<br>
13A by the friction force "f" and the moment "M", and, as shown in FIG. 14A, has the<br>
step 123a on the thick side engaged with the first projection 131. Alikely, during<br>
rotation of the crank shaft 23, the engagement between the first projection 131 and the<br>
step 123a are sustained by the friction force "f" and the moment "M". Identical to the<br>
regular direction rotation, as shown in FIG. 14B, when the rotation speed reaches to a<br>
certain level, the second projection 132 engages with the step 123b on the thin side by<br>
the centrifugal force "F", such that a multi-point contact is made between the eccentric<br>
sleeve 120 and the key member 130. Therefore, in the reverse direction rotation,<br>
relative rotation between the crank pin 110 and the eccentric sleeve 120 can be<br>
prevented, even if the external force "P" caused by the pressure of the working fluid<br>
applied to the piston during compression, and other force is applied thereto. Moreover,<br>
as shown in FIG. 14B, in the case of the reverse direction rotation, since the eccentric<br>
sleeve 120 is arranged to have a minimum eccentricity, the piston reciprocates in a<br>
minimum stroke length Lmin, and the compressor of the present invention has a<br>
minimum compression capacity.<br>
At the end, the compressor of the present invention can make stable operation<br><br>
even in any operation states, i.e., in regular and reverse direction rotations, by<br>
eliminating relative rotation between elements that are made to maintain the<br>
eccentricity by the key member 130, i.e., the crank pin 110 and the eccentric sleeve<br>
120.<br>
Moreover, the eccentric sleeve 120 is made to rotate, and engage with the key<br>
member 130 smoothly by the eccentric mass 200. That is, the eccentric mass 200<br>
serves to arrange the eccentric sleeve 120 at a required position accurately such that<br>
the eccentricity is changed, properly.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and<br>
variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or<br>
scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the<br>
modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of<br>
the appended claims and their equivalents.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The multi-point contact between the eccentric sleeve and the key member<br>
during operation permits positive engagement of the crank pin and the eccentric sleeve<br>
through the key member, such that any external, or internal cause can make relative<br>
movement between the eccentric sleeve and the crank pin, thereby permitting a stable<br>
operation of the compressor without variation of an output. That is, since the<br>
 eccentricity is constant, a designed compression capacity can be obtained, without<br>
change. Moreover, a friction loss caused by relative rotation between the crank pin and<br>
the eccentric sleeve is prevented. At the end, such a stable operation brings about an<br>
increase of an efficiency of the dual capacity compressor. In addition to this, noise<br>
occurred in the relative rotation can be prevented, and lifetimes of the components can<br>
 be increased.<br><br>
The rotation moment generated by the eccentric mass at the eccentric sleeve<br>
permits smooth rotation, and change of the eccentricity of the eccentric sleeve.<br>
Accordingly, the eccentric sleeve is arranged at a required position accurately so as to<br>
change the eccentricity and the compression capacity before the eccentric sleeve is<br>
held completely by the key member, thereby increasing an operative reliability of the<br>
compressor of the present invention.<br><br>
