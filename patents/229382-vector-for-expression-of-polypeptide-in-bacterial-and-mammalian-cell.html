DUAL EXPRESSION VECTOR SYSTEM FOR ANTIBODY EXPRESSION IN<br>
BACTERIAL AND MAMMALIAN CELLS<br>
1.        FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The present invention provides a dual expression vector, and methods for its<br>
use, for the expression and secretion of Fab fragments in bacteria and corresponding full length IgG in mammalian cells. The vector comprises a regulatory and coding sequences for a polypeptide of interest, e.g.9 a heavy or light chain of an IgG, wherein a bacterial promoter and signal sequence are included within a first intron located within the signal sequence of the polypeptide, e.g.,, an IgG heavy or light chain gene, and, when the protein of interest has more than one intron, e.g., an Ig heavy chain, a bacterial stop codon is included within a second intron, eg., the intron between the CHI domain and the hinge region of the heavy chain gene. The vector also comprises a mammalian promoter, origins of replication for both bacterial and mammalian cells, and optionally, one or more selectable markers. Thus, when expressed in bacteria, transcription from the bacterial promoter and termination at the stop codon in the second intron results in expression of a fragment of the polypeptide, e.g., a Fab fragment, whereas in mammalian cells splicing removes the bacterial regulatory sequences located in the introns and generates the mammalian signal sequence, allowing expression of the foil-length polypeptide, e.g., IgG heavy or light chain polypeptide.  The dual expression vector system can be used to select and screen for new monoclonal antibodies, as well as to optimize monoclonal antibodies for binding to antigenic molecules of interest Using this system, initial screening or selection steps can be accomplished by expressing Fab (or scFv) in E. coli, and the resulting Fab binding molecules can be readily expressed as bivalent IgG molecules of the desired isotype for functional testing.<br>
2.        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Recombinant expression systems have been key to the development of<br>
current antibody engineering technology. The demonstration of coexpression of cloned light and heavy chain genes of an IgM or an IgG in mammalian cells led rapidly to the generation and testing of chimeric Mabs containing human constant regions (Ochi et aL, 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U.SA. 80:6351 6355; Oi et al, 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.SA. 80:825 829; Morrison et a!., 1984, Proc. NatL Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81(21):6851-5). Subsequently, methods were developed to introduce human sequences into the variable<br><br>
regions of mouse immunoglobulins without reducing avidity. resulting in antibodies with very low potential immunogenicity in human subjects (Jones et al., 1986, Nature 321:522 525; Queen et al.,1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S A. 86:10029 10033). Reproducible methods have been developed to express large amounts of such recombinant antibodies in CHO or mouse myeloma cells for the preparation of highly purified material for human testing and eventual sale. There are now a number of such Mabs which have been approved and marketed for human use, including Rituxan and Herceptin for cancer treatment, Synagis for the prevention of RSV infection, Remicade for treatment of ihumatoid arthritis, and   . Zenapax for prevention of graft rejection (Reff et al.,1994, Blood 83:435 445; Carter et al., 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89(10):4285-9; Johnson et al., 1997, J. Infect. Dis. 176:1215 1224; Queen et al., 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:10029 10033; see Table 1).<br>
[0003]	Likewise, the demonstration that Fv, single chain Fv, or Fab molecules could<br>
be successfully expressed in microbial systems led rapidly to the development of methods to<br>
utilize this expression technology to exploit diverse libraries of VH and VL sequences<br>
(Skerra et al., 1988, Science 240:1038 1041; Bird et al.,1988; Science 242:423 426;<br>
Huston et al.,1988, Proa Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A 85:5879 5883). Combinatorial libraries of<br>
VL and VH sequences were initially expressed from bacteriophage lambda and the binding<br>
of a particular combination to antigen screened using a plaque lift assay (Huse et al.,1989,<br>
Science 246:1275-81; Huse etal.,1992, Biotechnology 24:517 523). By tethering either an<br>
scFv or Fab on the surface of a filamentous bacteriophage it was possible to select for<br>
binding phage containing the genes for the binding regions in their genome using panning<br>
techniques (McCafferty etal.,1990, Nature 348:552 554; Hoogenboom et al.,1991,19:<br>
4133 4137; Bird et al.,1988, Science 242:423 426; Kang et al.,1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
U. S. A. 88:4363 4366). The ability to select rather than screen allowed the enormous<br>
diversity contained in large libraries of 109 or greater individual members to be exploited to<br>
identify and isolate rare binders. Thus, it is now possible to isolate antibody fragments<br>
binding with reasonable affinity to almost any proteinaceous antigen from a large diverse<br>
bacteriophage library. Methods have also been developed to improve the affinity of<br>
antibody fragments by iterative rounds of mutagenesis of the CDRs and screening or<br>
selecting for improved binding to antigen (Schier et al.,1996, J. Mol. Biol. 263:551 567;<br>
Wu et al.,1998, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S A. 95:6037 6042).<br>
[0004]	Despite breakthroughs in using Fab or scFv expression systems for the<br>
identification and affinity maturation of novel specificities, fall length IgG molecules offer several advantages. One of the key features of an IgG is its bivalent structure.<br><br>
Cooperativity between the two Fab arms of an IgG in binding to antigen leads to a higher avidity of a bivalent IgG compared to the monovalent Fab. The degree of difference between the affinity of the individual Fab arms and the avidity of the IgG is most pronounced when the antigen is also multivalent or surface bound. The amount of cooperativity is more pronounced when the antigen is present at higher density and less pronounced in Mab with high affinity Fab arms, hi practical terms, this means that above a certain antigen density threshold a Mab with high affinity but low cooperativity will have the same avidity as a Mab having Fab arms with moderate affinity but high cooperativity. This latter Mab would be more selective for areas of high antigen density compared to the former Mab. One can envision instances where either Mab would be advantageous. For instance, there are very few true cancer antigens, i.e., antigens which are expressed only on tumor cells. Most are expressed on tumor cells at a higher density, but are expressed on other cell types as well. Thus, a Mab with high avidity but moderate affinity migjht be more selective for tumor than for normal cells expressing the antigen at a lower density. Likewise, during viral infection, antigen may be present on the virus, on virally infected cells, and secreted in free form. A neutralizing Mab selective for areas of higher antigen density could target the virus and infected cells rather than free antigen, or other areas of low antigen density, and thus might have equal or better efficacy compared to a high affinity Mab. Methods have been developed to select for higher avidity fragments using various strategies to link monomers of Fab or scFv (Hudson et al., 1999, J Immunol Methods 231:177189). These constructs are useful but may not accurately replicate the avidity provided by linking Fab arms using an Fc. Additionally, one may want to first identify specific binders and then those which have higher cooperativity. For instance, in the example above, one might want to screen for viral neutralization but find that most monovalent Fabs had little activity. Converting to full length IgG might allow selection for neutralizing activity due to increased avidity.<br>
[0005]	In other cases, effector function may be required for optimal potency of the<br>
binding molecule. The interaction between the Fc portion of immunoglobulin molecules and specific cell surface receptors allows the coupling of antigen binding to effector cell functions.<br>
[0006]	There are three classes of Fc receptors for IgG present in humans and<br>
rodents, which are designated RI, RE, and RBI (Ravetch and Bolland, 2001, Annu. Rev. Immunol 19: 275 290). RI, present on monocytes and macrophages, binds to monomeric IgG with high affinity. RH is present on a wide variety of cells including B cells, platelets, neutrophils, macrophages and monocytes, and binds to mUltimeric IgG (immune complexes<br><br>
or aggregated IgG) with moderate affinity. Two forms of RH are expressed, differing by the presence of either an activation (HAM) Rlla domain or an inhibitory (TTIM) RUb domain on the intracellular portion of the receptor. The relative level of activating and inhibitory receptors on a given cell determines the response to immune complexes. B cells express only the inhibitory form. RIII, like RII, binds to multimeric IgG (immune complexes or aggregated IgG) with moderate affinity. There are also two forms of RIII.. The IT AM domain on the associated gamma chain mediates signaling through RI, as well as through RIIIa and the FcE receptors. The signaling molecule RIIIa associates with the ITAM containing gamma chain on NK, monocytes, macrophages, and certain T cells. On NK cells, signaling by RIIIa also involves the TCR zeta chain. RIIIb is a non signaling form and is expressed on (human) neutrophils as a GPI linked molecule.<br>
[0007J	In the body, RI sites are generally occupied by monomeric IgG while RII and<br>
RIII receptors are unoccupied and available to. interact with immune complexes. Cross linking of activating Fc receptors by antibody antigen complexes can result in the phagocytosis of pathogens, killing of foreign and transformed cells by direct cytotoxicity, the clearance of toxic substances, and the initiation of an inflammatory response. Additionally, the Fc contains sites for interacting with complement components (Tao et al.9 1993, J Exp Med 178:661 667). Finally, the Fc is responsible for the long half-life in vivo of IgGs through a specific interaction with the MHC related FcRn receptor (Ghetie and Ward, 2002, Immunol Res. 25:97 113).<br>
[0008]	Clearly, in instances where the target is a bacterium or a cancerous cell, it<br>
would be advantageous to test agents for clearance or killing rather than only binding. In that case, an IgG would be the preferred molecule to test For instance, the chimeric anti CD20 Mab Rituxan was selected based on its having strong ADCC activity against human B cells (Reff et al.,1994, Blood 83:435 445). Additionally, although the anti HER2 antibody Herceptin binds to and blocks signaling through an EGF like receptor on tumor cells, recent studies have indicated that tumor protection is largely Fc-mediated (Clynes et al., 2000, Nat. Med. 6:443 446).<br>
[0009]	There is a great interest in expression, selection and improvement of<br>
antibodies using scFv or Fab systems. Using the technologies currently available, however, the resulting scFv or Fab fragments must be re-cloned into a vector for expression of the full length glycosylated Mab for further testing and development This step severely limits the number of Mabs which can be tested at this stage.  Thus, despite such interest in the technology, as yet, no effective system for selecting and improving full length Mab molecules useful for human therapeutics has been developed.<br><br>

3.        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0011]	The present invention provides a vector system, and methods for its use, for<br>
the selection, screening and expression of optimized monoclonal antibodies. The vector system can be used to express and select for Fab fragments in bacteria, preferably E. coli, and corresponding full length antibodies (e.g., IgGs) in eukaryotic cells, preferably mammalian cells. Using this system, screening and/or selection of the initial binding molecules can be accomplished using E. coli expressed Fab or scFv, and the resulting binding molecules can be quickly expressed as bivalent antibodies of the desired isotype for functional testing.<br>
[0012]	The invention is based, impart, on the Applicants' discovery and<br>
development of a dual expression vector system capable of expressing and secreting into the periplasmic space antibody fragments in bacteria and expressing and secreting full-length IgG in mammalian cells. In this novel vector, regulatory elements required for expression and secretion of Fab fragments in bacteria overlap sequence elements required for both proper processing of IgG heavy and light chain RNA transcripts and secretion of IgG heavy and light chain polypeptides in mammalian cells. In particular, a bacterial promoter and signal sequence are included in an nitron located within the sequence coding for the signal sequence of a mammalian IgG heavy or light chain gene, and a bacterial stop codon is  included in another intron between the CHI and the hinge region of the heavy chain gene (or, in an alternative embodiment in an intron located between the hinge region and the CH2 domain). Thus, when expressed in bacteria, transcription from the bacterial promoter and termination at the stop codon in the second intron results in Fab fragment expression in bacteria periplasmic space, whereas in mammalian cells, splicing removes the bacterial promoter and signal sequence and regenerates the mammalian signal sequence, allowing expression of the full-length IgG heavy or light chain polypeptide. An important feature of the vector is the structural and functional overlap of a bacterial and mammalian regulatory sequence elements, i.e., the mammalian signal sequence and splice acceptor site, and the bacterial promoter and signal sequences, so that the functionality of all four of these sequence elements is maintained. It is therefore critical in construction of the vector that any changes made within this overlap region maintain the functionality of these four sequence elements.<br><br>
[0013]	This improved system enhances and streamlines the identification of the best<br>
functional Mabs for use as therapeutic agents. When expressed in bacterial cells, the<br>
bacterial promoter controls expression of the Fab (or scFv), allowing selection and<br>
screening for antigen binding in the bacterial cells. However, when expressed in<br>
mammalian cells, splicing results in removal of the introns within the mammalian signal<br>
sequence and between the CHI and hinge region of the heavy chain, and hence the bacterial<br>
promoter, bacterial signal sequence, and stop codon are removed, and the mammalian signal<br>
sequence reconstructed. A mammalian promoter, e.g., CMV promoter, is located 5' of start<br>
site of the mammalian signal sequence, directing transcription of a nucleotide sequence<br>
encoding the heavy chain or light chain of the IgG molecule, and thus, the full-length heavy<br>
chain or light chain IgG molecule is expressed in die mammalian cell<br>

5.        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0038]	The present invention is directed to a novel dual expression vector system for<br>
expression and secretion of Fab fragments in bacterial cells, e.g., E. coli cells, and for expression of IgG heavy and light chain polypeptides in eukaryotic cells, preferably mammalian cells, but also, e.g., insect cells or avian cells, and to methods for its use in screening and optimization of monoclonal antibodies with particular binding characteristics. As discussed above, the invention is based, in part, on the Applicants' development of a dual expression vector system capable of expressing and secreting into the periplasmic space antibody fragments in bacteria and expressing and secreting full-length antibodies in mammalian cells, hi this novel vector a bacterial promoter and signal sequence are included in an intron located within the signal sequence of a mammalian IgG heavy or light chain gene, and a bacterial stop codon is included in another intron between the CHI and the hinge region of the heavy chain gene. Thus, when expressed in bacteria, transcription from the bacterial promoter and termination at the stop codon in the second intron results in Fab fragment expression, whereas in mammalian cells, splicing removes the bacterial control elements and regenerates the mammalian signal sequence, allowing expression of the full-length IgG heavy or light chain polypeptide. Thus, this dual purpose vector is designed to maintain the structure and function of the bacterial and mammalian regulatory sequence elements, z.e., the mammalian signal sequence and splice acceptor site, and the bacterial promoter and signal sequences.<br>
[0039]	Described below, are compositions and methods relating to the construction<br>
and use of the novel dual expression vector system. In particular, Section 5.1 describes compositions of the invention, including DNA cassettes designed for dual expression of a polypeptide of interest in a eukaryotic cell and a fragment thereof in bacteria, vectors comprising the dual expression vector polynucleotide cassette, host cells comprising such cassettes and vectors, and kits comprising such cassettes, vectors, and host cells. Sections<br><br>
52 and 5.3 describe methods for use of the invention, including methods for use of the novel vector sequence for identifying novel antibodies, and for selection and screening of optimized monoclonal antibodies in both eukaryotic and bacterial systems, as well as generalized methods for applying these principles to construct a dual expression vector system for any membrane-bound or secreted protein of interest<br>
5.1      THE DUAL EXPRESSION VECTOR<br>
&gt;<br>
[0040]	The dual expression vector system having the sequence and functional<br>
elements outlined above may be constructed using a variety of techniques available in the art. In a preferred embodiment, the vector comprises: (1) a mammalian promote^ (2) a nucleotide sequence encoding an IgG heavy chain or light chain; said nucleotide sequence comprising: (a) a mammalian signal sequence comprising: (i) a first intron, said first intron comprising a bacterial promoter and signal sequence, such that the bacterial promoter and signal sequence overlap a first splice acceptor site and are operably linked to the IgG heavy or light chain coding sequence such that said bacterial promoter and signal sequence direct expression and secretion into the periplasmic space of said Fab domain of said heavy chain or said light chain in a bacterial cell and said mammalian promoter, and signal sequence directs expression and secretion of said heavy chain or said light chain in a mammalian cell; and (ii) when said vector encodes said heavy chain, a second intron between sequence encoding the CHI and the hinge region of the heavy chain gene, said second intron comprising a bacterial stop codon; (3) a bacterial origin of replication; (4) and a mammalian origin of replication- In addition to the foregoing sequence elements, the vector may further comprise selectable markers for cloning and growth of the vector in bacterial cells, and for growth and selection of cells bearing the vector in both bacterial and eukaryotic cells, multiple cloning site sequences for addition of other nucleotide sequences, as well as other sequences of interest. The sequence elements are described in detail hereinbelow.<br>
5.1.1    DUAL EXPRESSION VECTOR CASSETTE SEQUENCES<br>
[0041]	The nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of interest, e.g.9 an IgG<br>
heavy chain or light chain, is designed with a mammalian signal sequence which comprises a first intron, and if the sequence encodes a heavy chain, a CHI-hinge region comprising a second intron. The first and second introns are designed to include bacterial regulatory sequences which direct expression and secretion of the polypeptide in bacterial cells, and which are removed by splicing when the dual expression vector is expressed in mammalian cells. The particular sequence composition and structure of the dual expression vector cassette is described in detail herein.<br><br>
[0042]	The first intron is designed to be located within the mammalian signal<br>
sequence of the polypeptide of the interest Unless the mammalian signal sequence<br>
naturally has an intron, a first intron is constructed using any recombinant DNA method<br>
known in the art.  The first intron comprises a bacterial promoter and signal sequence<br>
which overlaps the splice acceptor site. The bacterial promoter and signal sequence are<br>
constructed so that they are "operably linked" to the polypeptide sequence, e.g., the IgG<br>
heavy chain sequence or light chain sequence. That is, the bacterial promoter is positioned<br>
so as to direct transcription of the Fab fragment or scFv sequence in a bacterial cell, and the<br>
bacterial signal sequence is positioned to overlap the splice acceptor site so as to result in<br>
secretion of the polypeptide into the periplasmic space in a bacterial cell.<br>
[00431	To maintain the functionality of the bacterial promoter, the bacterial signal<br>
sequence and the mammalian signal and splice acceptor site, the first intron nucleotide sequence may be designed using promoter consensus sequences, signal sequence consensus sequences and splice site consensus sequences which are well known in the art, and as illustrated in the example presented in Section 6. For example, any signal sequence which targets the polypeptide of interest, e.g., an antibody such as IgG, to the bacterial periplasmic membrane, may be used. The bacterial signal sequence may be natural or synthetic in origin. Leader sequences, associated with proteins naturally destined for the periplasm, are, for example, known to direct the secretion of foreign proteins to the periplasm (Maclntyre et al.,1990, Mol. Gen. Genet 221:466-474). In a preferred embodiment, the signal sequence<br>
■T-"<br>
encodes the pelB sequence and the OmpA protein leader sequence (Hobom et a/., 199S, Dev. Biol. Stand. 84:255-262). Other signal sequences are also possible, including, but not limited to, the leaders from E. coli PhoA (Oka et al.,1985, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci 82:7212-16), OmpT (Johnson et al.,1996, Protein Expression 7:104-113), LamB and OrnpF (Hoffinan &amp; Wright, 1985, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:5107-5111), j3-lactamase (Kadonaga et al., 1984, J. Biol. Chem. 259:2149-54), enterotoxins (Morioka-Fujimoto et a/., 1991, J. Biol. Chem. 266:1728-32), protein A from Staphylococcus aureus (Abrahmsen et al., 1986, Nucleic Acids Res. 14:7487-7500), endoglucanase from B. subtilis (Lo et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 54:2287-2292), as well as artificial and synthetic signal sequences (Maclntyre et al.,1990, Mol. Gen. Genet 221:466-74; Kaiser et al.,1987, Science, 235:312-317).<br>
[0044]	Secretion of Fab fragments or scFv into the periplasm of bacteria may be<br>
improved by altering vector sequences, once an initial vector is made. For example, phage display of a single chain fv (scFv) with variability introduced in the signal sequence may be used to select for variants with improved secretion. In addition, other signal peptide coding<br><br>
sequences may also be modified and tried. In this case, a database of signal peptide coding sequences can be made and compare to the desired splice site. The most homologous segment may then be modified if necessary for secretion of Fab in E. coli and retention of Mab expression and secretion in HEK 293 cells.<br>
[0045]	Individual sequence elements within this region may be optimized by<br>
making appropriate changes to improve the functionality of the individual elements,<br>
providing the functionality of all sequence elements, i.e., transcription in both bacterial and<br>
mammalian hosts, splicing of transcripts in mammalian hosts, and secretion into the<br>
periplasm in bacteria and secretion in mammalian hosts, is maintained.<br>
[0046]	To predict whether modified prokaryotic signal peptides would still retain<br>
favorable splice cleavage sites, sequences may be analyzed by SighalP program which uses neural network algorithm (Nielsen et al.,1997, Int J. Neural Sys. 8, 581 599). The potential functionality of the splice sites may be assessed using the Splice Site Prediction program at the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project web site (see Reese et al&gt; J. CompuL Biol., 1997,4(3):311 23). This program also uses a neural network algorithm trained on human genes.<br>
[0047]	It may also be desirable to add epitope/affinity tags to improve purification<br>
or identification of the polypeptide, e.g., Fab fragment, scFv, or light or heavy chain, during purification or screening protocols. In order to insure that these tags be exposed on the protein after secretion, flexible linker sequences such as GGGGS are introduced between the functional domains and the epitope/affinity tag sequences. Peptide tags can include those for which methods/reagents exist that allow facile identification of the tagged polypeptide or fragment, but are unlikely to inhibit or interfere with function of the tagged polypeptide or fragment The tag may be of any length that permits binding to the corresponding binding reagent, but does not interfere with the tagged proteins binding to the mRNA. In a preferred embodiment, the tag is about 8,10,12,15,18 or 20 amino acids, is less than 15,20,25,30,40 or 50 amino acids, but maybe 100,150,200, 300,400 or 500 or more amino acids in length. The tag may be bound specifically by a reagent that does not bind any component of: (1) the cell of interest; or (2) a polysomal preparation of interest; or (3) whatever cellular fraction of interest is being contacted by the reagent that binds the tag. Molecular tags may include, by way of example, and not by limitation, protein A fragments; myc epitopes (Evan et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 5(12):3610-3616); Btag (Wang et al., 1996, Gene 169(1): 53-58; and polyhistidine tracts (Bornhorst et al.y 2000, Methods Enzymol 326*245-54). Other preferred tags include, but are not limited to:<br><br>
(1)	a portion of the influenza virus hemagglutinin protein (Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala; SEQ ID NO: 1). The reagent used for purification is a monoclonal antibody recognizing the tagged protein (12CA5) (Wilson et al.91984, Cell 37(3):767 78).<br>
(2)	a portion of the human c myc gene (Glu-Gln-Lys-Leu-He-Ser-Glu-Glu-Asp-Leu; SEQ ID NO: 2). The reagent used for purification is a monoclonal antibody recognizing the tagged protein (9E10) (Evan et al., 1985, Mol Cell Biol. 5(12):3610 6).<br>
(3)	a portion of the bluetongue virus VP7 protein (Gln-Tyr-Pro-Ala-Leu-Thr, SEQ ID NO: 3), The reagent used for purification is a monoclonal antibody recognizing the tagged protein (Dll and/orF10)(Wang et al.,Gene. 1996 Feb 22;169(1):53 8)<br>
(4)	a FLAG peptide (eg., Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys; SEQ ID NO: 4). The reagent used for purification are monoclonal antibodies recognizing the tagged protein (e.g.,Mland/orM2)(Sigma)(Hopp et al.,U.S.PatentNo. 4,703,004, entitled "Synthesis of protein with an identification peptide" issued October 27,1987; Brizzard et a/., 1994, Biotechniques. Apr,16(4):730 5; Knappik et al, 1994, Biotechniques 17(4):754 761);<br>
(5)	a Strep tag peptide (eg., Ala Trp Arg His Pro Gin Phe Gly Gly, SEQ ID NO: 5). In a preferred embodiment, a strep-tag peptide is used. The reagent used for purification is one of several optimized versions of streptavidin that recognizes the tagged protein (IB A GmbH) (Skerra et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,506,121, entitled Fusion peptides with binding activity for streptavidin, issued April 9,1996 ; Skerra et al.,1999, BiomoL Eng. 16(1 4):79 86; Skerra et al, 2000, Methods Enzymol. 2000;326:271 304).<br>
[0048]	When the soluble domain/fragment of the polypeptide that is to be expressed<br>
in bacteria is not co-terminal with the full-length polypeptide of interest, a second intron comprising a bacterial stop codon is included in the polypeptide of the interest This intron is located in the region of the polypeptide where termination of the soluble domain/fragment is desired If an intron does not naturally exist in the desired location of the protein of interest, appropriate intron sequences may be introduced into the desired location using recombinant or synthetic DNA techniques well known in the ait For example, in a preferred embodiment, the sequence of the heavy chain of IgG comprises a second intron located between the CHI domain and the hinge region. Translation termination at this site in bacteria results in (he expression of a Fab1 fragment Alternatively, if production of a Fab2 fragment is desired, an intron comprising a stop codon may be included in the sequence encoding the polypeptide between the hinge and the CH2 domain. This would result in the production of the larger Fab2 fragment<br>
[0049]	Dual expression vector cassette sequences are tested to insure that the<br>
functionality of the splice site acceptor and bacterial signal sequences are maintained. Any<br><br>
sequence changes which negatively impact the ability of the full-length Igti to be secreted from mammalian cells would be not be useful, although minor functional consequences could be tolerated, at least for screening purposes.<br>
[0050]	Circular vectors incorporating IgG and Fab expression sequences may be<br>
constructed using standard methods known in the art (see Sambrook et al.,1989, supra;<br>
Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Associates and<br>
Wiley Interscience, New York). For example, synthetic or recombinant DNA technology<br>
may be used. In one embodiment, a vector comprising The dual expression vector cassette<br>
sequences is made by polymerase chain reaction ("PCR") amplification. In this method,<br>
oligonucleotides are synthesized to include restriction enzyme sites at (heir 5' ends, and<br>
PCR primer sequences complementary to the boundary sequences of an IgG regulatory and<br>
coding sequence at their 3" ends. These oligonucleotides are then used as primers in a PCR<br>
amplification reaction to amplify the IgG regulatory and coding sequence region. This<br>
amplified region is then cloned into a vector containing mammalian and bacterial origins oj<br>
replication and appropriate selectable marker sequences, using standard molecular biology<br>
techniques (see e.g., Methods in Enzymology, 1987, Volume 154, Academic Press;<br>
Sambrook et al., 1989, supra; and Ausubel et al., supra). The circular product is then<br>
transformed into Escherichia coli for amplification to yield large amounts of the vector.<br>
[0051]	Preferably, as discussed in detail below, the vector includes a bacterial origi<br>
of replication, a mammalian origin of replication, and one or more selectable markers. As the dual expression vector system described herein is designed to be used in both mammalian and bacterial hosts, a variety of bacterial strains or cell line may be used. The choice of certain vector sequences, such as the origin of replication sequences, will depend on the choice of host, which, in turn may depend on a variety of factors, such as factors required for expression, secretion, and screening or selecting a particular polypeptide or antibody of interest<br>
5.1.2   METHODS FOR PRODUCTION OF ANTIBODIES<br>
[0052]	Antibodies which immunospecifically bind to an antigen can be produced t<br>
any method known in the art for the synthesis of antibodies, in particular, by chemical synthesis or preferably, by recombinant expression techniques.<br>
[0053]	Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using a wide variety of techniques<br>
known in the art including the use of hybridoma, recombinant, and phage display technologies, or a combination thereof. For example, monoclonal antibodies can be produced using hybridoma techniques including those kno-frn in the art and taught, for exainple, in Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Haibor<br><br>
Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988); Hammerling et al.9 in; Monoclonal Antibodies and T Cell Hybridomas 563 681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981) (said references incorporated by reference in their entireties). The term '^monoclonal antibody" as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. The term "monoclonal antibody*' refers to an antibody that is derived from a single clone, including any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone, and not the method by which it is produced.<br>
[0054]	Methods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using<br>
hybridoma technology are routine and well known in the art Briefly, mice can be<br>
immunized with a non-murine antigen and once an immune response is detected, e.g.,<br>
antibodies specific for the antigen are detected in the mouse serum, the mouse spleen is<br>
harvested and splenocytes isolated. The splenocytes are then fused by well known<br>
techniques to any suitable myeloma cells, for example cells from cell line' SP20 available<br>
from the ATCC. Hybridomas are selected and cloned by limited dilution. The hybridoma<br>
clones are then assayed by methods known in the art for cells that secrete antibodies capable<br>
of binding a polypeptide. Ascites fluid, which generally contains high levels of antibodies,<br>
can be generated by immunizing mice with positive hybridoma clones.<br>
[0055]	Accordingly, the present invention provides methods of generating<br>
monoclonal antibodies as well as antibodies produced by the method comprising culturing a hybridoma cell secreting an antibody wherein, preferably, thehybridoma is generated by fusing splenocytes isolated from a mouse immunized with a non-murine antigen with myeloma cells and then screening the hybridomas resulting from the fusion for hybridoma clones that secrete an antibody able to bind to the antigen.<br>
[0056]	Antibody fragments which recognize specific particular epitopes may be<br>
generated by any technique known to those of skill in the ait For example, Fab and F(ab')2<br>
fragments may be produced by proteolytic cleavage of immunoglobulin molecules, using<br>
enzymes such as papain (to produce Fab fragments) or pepsin (to produce F(ab')2<br>
fragments). F(aV)2 fragments contain the variable region, the light chain constant region<br>
and the CHI domain of the heavy chain. Further, the antibodies of the present invention<br>
can also be generated using various phage display methods known in the art.<br>
[0057]	For some uses, including in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in vitro<br>
detection assays, it may be preferable to use human or chimeric antibodies. Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human subjects. Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including phage display methods described above using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. See also U.S. Patent Nos. 4,444,887 and 4,716,111; and PCT<br><br>
publications WO 98/46645, WO 98/50433, WO 98/24893, W098/16654, WO 96/34096, WO 96/33735, and WO 91/10741; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its ' entirety,<br>
[0058]	Human antibodies can also be produced using transgenic mice which are<br>
incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins, but which can express human immunoglobulin genes. For example, the human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin gene complexes may be introduced randomly or by homologous recombination into mouse embryonic stem cells. Alternatively, the human variable region, constant region, and diversity region may be introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells in addition to the human heavy and light chain genes. The mouse heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes may be rendered non functional separately or simultaneously with the introduction of human immunoglobulin loci by homologous recombination. In particular, homozygous deletion of the JH region prevents endogenous antibody production. The modified embryonic stem cells are expanded and microinjected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. The chimeric mice are then be bred to produce homozygous offspring which express human antibodies. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of a polypeptide of interest. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained from the immunized, transgenic mice using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by die transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg and Huszar (1995, Int. Rev. Immunol. 13:65 93). For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies, see, e.g., PCT publication Nos. WO 98/24893, WO 96/34096, and WO 96/33735; and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,413,923,5,625,126, 5,633,425,5,569,825,5,661,016, 5,545,806,5,814,318, and 5,939,598, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. In addition, companies such as Abgenix, Inc. (Freemont, CA) and Genpharm (San Jose, CA) can be engaged to provide human antibodies directed against a selected antigen using technology similar to that described above.<br>
[0059]	A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody<br>
are derived from different immunoglobulin molecules such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a human antibody and a non-human immunoglobulin constant region. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art See e.g., Morrison, 1985,<br><br>
Science 229:1202; Oi et al.,1986, BioTechniques 4:214; Gillies et al.,1989, J. Immunol.<br>
Methods 125:191-202; and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,807,715,4,816,567, and 4,8 16397, which<br>
are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety- Chimeric antibodies comprising one<br>
or more CDRs from human species and framework regions from a non-human<br>
immunoglobulin molecule can be produced using a variety of techniques known in die art<br>
including, for example, CDR-grafting (EP 239,400; PCT publication No. WO 91/09967;<br>
and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,225,539,5,530,101, and 5,585,089), veneering or resurfacing (EP<br>
592,106; EP 519,596; Padlan, 1991, Molecular Immunology 28(4/5):489-498; Studnicka et<br>
al.,1994, Protein Engineering 7(6):805-814; and Roguska et al.9 1994, PNAS 91:969-973),<br>
and chain shuffling (U.S. Patent No. 5,565332). In a preferred embodiment, chimeric<br>
antibodies comprise a human CDR3 having an amino acid sequence of any one of the<br>
CDR3 listed in Table 2 and non-human framework regions. Often, framework residues in<br>
the framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR<br>
donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework<br>
substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the<br>
interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important<br>
for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at<br>
particular positions. (See, e.g., Queen et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,585,089; and Riechmann et<br>
al., 1988, Nature 332:323, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties:)<br>
[0060}	Further, the antibodies of interest can, in turn, be utilized to generate anti-<br>
idiotype antibodies that "mimic" antigens using techniques well known to those skilled in the ait (See, e.g.9 Greenspan &amp; Bona, 1989, FASEB J. 7(5):437-444; and Nissinoff, 1991, J. Immunol. 147(8):2429-2438). For example, antibodies that bind to and competitively inhibit the binding of an antigen of interest (as determined by assays well known in the art and disclosed in supra) to its host cell receptor can be used to generate anti-idiotypes that "mimic" an antigen of interest binding domain and, as a consequence, bind to and neutralize the antigen and/or its host cell receptor. Such neutralizing anti-idiotypes or Fab fragments of such anti-idiotypes can be used in therapeutic regimens to neutralize the antigen. For example, such anti-idiotypic antibodies can be used to bind an antigen of interest and/or to bind its host cell receptor.<br>
5.13   RECOMBINANT EXPRESSION AND PROTEIN PRODUCTION<br>
10061]	Once the dual expression vector containing a cassette sequence encoding a<br>
polypeptide of interest is constructed, e.g., a cassette sequence encoding an antibody molecule with the appropriately designed intron sequences, the dual expression vector of the invention may be produced by recombinant DNA technology Using techniques well-known<br><br>
in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,331,415, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[0062]	For example, in a preferred embodiment, methods which are well known to<br>
those skilled in the art can be used to construct the dual expression vector cassette with<br>
appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals.' These methods include, for<br>
example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic<br>
recombination. The invention, thus, provides an expression vector comprising a nucleotide<br>
sequence encoding an antibody molecule, a heavy or light chain of an antibody, a heavy or<br>
light chain variable domain of an antibody or a portion thereof, or a heavy or light chain<br>
CDR, operably linked to a promoter. Such vectors may include the nucleotide sequence<br>
encoding the constant region of the antibody molecule (see, e.g., PCT Publication WO<br>
86/05807; PCT Publication WO 89/01036; and U.S. Patent No. 5,122,464) and the variable<br>
domain of the antibody may be cloned into such a vector for expression of the entire heavy,<br>
the entire light chain, or both the entire heavy and light chains.<br>
[0063]	The dual expression vector is transferred to a host cell by conventional<br>
techniques and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce<br>
an antibody of interest. Thus, the invention includes host cells containing a polynucleotide<br>
encoding an antibody of interest or fragments thereof, or a heavy or light chain thereof, or<br>
portion thereof or a single chain antibody of interest, operably linked to a heterologous<br>
promoter. In preferred embodiments for the expression of double-chained antibodies,<br>
vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains may be co-expressed in the host cell for<br>
expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule, as detailed below.<br>
[0064]	A variety of host systems may be utilized to express the dual expression<br>
vector of the invention (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,807,715). Such host systems represent cells which may, when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences, express an antibody molecule of interest in situ. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., E. coli and B. subtilis); yeast (e.g., Saccharomyces Pichia) transformed with dual expression vectors; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus); plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g, cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV; tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) transformed with dual expression cassettes; or mammalian cell systems (e.g., COS, HEK, CHO, BHK, 293, NS0, and 3T3 cells) harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (eg., metallothiotiein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter).<br><br>
[0065]	For expression in a bacterial host, (he dual expression vector includes an<br>
origin of replication, which is needed for replication and propagation of the plasmid vector.<br>
For cloning and propagation in E. coli, any E. colt origin of replication is used, examples of<br>
which are well-known in the art (see, Miller, 1992, A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics,<br>
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY, and references therein). Non-limiting examples<br>
of readily available plasmid origins of replication are CoIEl-derived origins of replication<br>
(Bolivar et al., 1977, Gene 2:95-113; see Sambrook et al., 1989, supra), pl5A origins<br>
present on plasmids such as pACYC184 (Chang and Cohen, 1978, J. Bacterid. 134:1141-<br>
56; see also Miller, 1992, p. 10.4-10.11), and pSClOl origin available for low-copy<br>
«     » plasmids expression are all well known in the art.<br>
[0066]	For example, in one embodiment, the origin of replication from a high-copy<br>
plasmid is used, such as a plasmid containing a ColEl-derived origin of replication,<br>
examples of which are well known in the art (see Sambrook et al.,1989, supra; see also<br>
Miller, 1992, A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics, Cold Spring Haibor Laboratory Press,<br>
NY, and references therein). One example is an origin from pUC19 and its derivatives<br>
(Yanisch-Perron et al.,1985, Gene 33:103-119). pUC vectors exist at levels of 300-500<br>
copies per cell and have convenient cloning sites for insertion of foreign genes. For very<br>
high expression, X vectors, such as λgtl1 (Huynh et al.,1984, in "DNA Cloning<br>
Techniques:, Vol I: A Practical Approach", D, Glover, ed., pp 49-78, IRL Press, Oxford), or<br>
the T7 or SP6 phage promoters in cells containing T7 and Sp6 polymerase expression<br>
systems (Studier et al.,1990, Methods Enzymol. 185:60-89) can be used.<br>
[0067J	When a lower level of expression is desired, an origin of replication from a<br>
medium or a low-copy may be used. Medium-copy plasmids are well known in theart,<br>
such as pBR322, which has a ColEl derived origin of replication and 20-100 copies per cell<br>
(Bolivar et al.,1977, Gene 2:95-113; see Sambrook et al.,1989, supra)9 or pACYC184, one<br>
of the pACYClOO series of plasmids, which have a pl5A origin of replication and exist at<br>
10-12 copies per cell (Chang and Cohen, 1978, J. Bacterid. 134:1141-56; see also Miller,<br>
1992, p. 10.4-10.11), Low-copy plasmids are also well known in the art, for example,<br>
pSClOl, which has a pSClOl origin, and approximately 5 copies per cell. Both pACYC<br>
and pSCl 01 plasmid vectors have convenient cloning sites and can co-exist in the same cell<br>
as pBR and pUC plasmids, since they have compatible origins of replication and unique<br>
selective antibiotic markers. Other suitable plasmid origins of replication include lambda or<br>
phage PI replicon based plasmids, for example the Lorist series (Gibson et al.,1987, Gene<br>
53:283-286).<br><br>
[0068]	When even less expression is desired, the origin of replication may be<br>
obtained from the bacterial chromosome (see Miller, 1992, supra; Niedhardt, F.C., ed.,<br>
1987, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, American Society for Microbiology,<br>
Washington, D.C.; Yarmolinsky, MB. &amp; Sternberg, R, 1988, pp. 291-438, in Vol. 1 of The<br>
Bacteriophages, R. Calendar, ed., Plenum Press, New York). In addition, synthetic origins<br>
of replication, bacterial promoters, or bacterial signal sequences may be used.<br>
[0069]	In mammalian host cells, the dual expression vector sequences may either be<br>
designed to exist in the mammalian host cells as episomes, or may be designed to facilitate integration into the host genomic DNA to create stable cell lines, e.g., by designing vector to be linearized. Such vectors are known in the art.<br>
[0070]	For example, a number of viral-based expression systems may be utilized in<br>
mammalian host cells. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, The dual expression vector cassette sequences may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription/translation control complex, e.g., the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non-essential region of the viral genome (e.g., region El or E3) will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing IgG gene products in infected hosts (e.g., see Logan and Shenk, 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81,3655-3659). Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted expression vector cassette sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. In cases where an IgG heavy or light chain, including its own initiation codon and adjacent sequences, is inserted into the appropriate expression vector, no additional translational control signals may be needed. However, in cases where only a portion of the IgG coding sequence is inserted, exogenous translational control signals, including, perhaps, the ATG initiation codon, must be provided. Furthermore, the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements, transcription terminators, etc. (see Bittner et al.,1987, Methods in Enzymol. 153,516-544).<br>
[0071]	In addition, a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression<br>
of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion, desired. Such modifications (e.g., glycosylation) and processing (e.g., cleavage) of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have<br><br>
characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post-translational processing and<br>
modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be<br>
chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed.<br>
To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper<br>
processing of the primary transcript, giycosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product<br>
mfry be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO, VERY, BHK,<br>
Hela, COS, MDCK, 293,3T3, W138, BT483, Hs578T, HTB2, BT20 and T47D, NSO (a<br>
murine myeloma cell line that does not endogenously produce any immunoglobulin chains).<br>
[0072]	For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable<br>
expression is preferred. For example, cell lines which stably express the antibody molecule may be engineered Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA, engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded<br>
into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which<br>
»<br>
express the antibody molecule. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compositions that interact directly or indirectly with the antibody inolecule.<br>
[0073]	A number of selection systems may be used, including but not limited to, the<br>
herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler et al.,1977, Cell 11:223), hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Szybalska &amp; Szybalski, 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 48:202), and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy et al.,1980, Cell 22:8-17) genes can be employed in tk-, hgprt- or aprt- cells, respectively. Also, antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes: dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler et al., 1980, Natl. Acad. ScL USA 77:357; O'Hare et al., 1981, Proc, Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:1527); gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan &amp; Berg, 1981, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:2072); neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418 (Wu and Wu, 1991, Biotherapy 3:87-95; Tolstoshev, 1993, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol, 32:573-596; Mulligan, 1993, Science 260:926-932; and Morgan and Anderson, 1993, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 62:191-217; May, 1993, TTB TECH 1l(5):155-2 15); and hygro, which confers resistance to hygromycin<br><br>
(Santerre et al,1984, Gene 30:147)- Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology may be routinely applied to select the desired recombinant clone, and such methods are described, for example, in Ausubel et al (eds.), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY (1993); Kriegler, Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual, Stockton Press, NY (1990); and in Chapters 12 and 13, Dracopoli et al (eds), Current Protocols in Human Genetics, John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY (1994); Colberre-Garapin et al,1981, J. Mol. BioL 150:1, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.<br>
[0074]	For selection in bacteria, preferably antibiotic resistance markers are used,<br>
such as the kanamycin resistance gene from Tn903 (Friedrich and Soriano, 1991, Genes Dev. 5:1513-1523), or genes that confer resistance to other aminoglycosides (including but not limited to dihydrostreptomycin, gentamycin, neomycin, paromycin and streptomycin), the TEM-1 β-lactamase gene from Tn9, which confers resistance to penicillin (including but not limited to ampicillin, carbenicillin, methicillin, penicillin N, penicillin O and penicillin V). Other selectable genes sequences including, but not limited to gene sequences encoding polypeptides which confer zeocin resistance (Hegedus et al 1998, Gene 207:241-249). Other antibiotics that can be utilized are genes that confer resistance to amphenicols, such as chloramphenicol, for example, the coding sequence for chloramphenicol transacetylase (CAT) can be utilized (Eikmanns et al 1991, Gene 102:93-98). As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, other non-antibiotic methods to select for maintenance of the plasmid may also be used, such as, for example a variety of auxotrophic markers (see Sambrook et al, 1989, supra; Ausubel et al, supra).<br>
[0075]	The expression levels of an antibody molecule can be increased by vector<br>
amplification (for a review, see Bebbington and Hentschel, The use of vectors based on gene amplification for the expression of cloned genes in mammalian cells in DNA cloning, Vol.3. (Academic Press, New York, 1987)). When a marker in the vector system expressing antibody is amplifiable, increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the antibody gene, production of the antibody will also increase (Crouse et al., 1983, Mol. Cell. Biol. 3:257).<br>
[0076J	The host cell may be co-transfected with two dual expression vectors of the<br>
invention, the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides in mammalian cells and Fab or scFv polypeptides in bacterial cells. Alternatively, a single<br><br>
vector may be used which encodes, and is capable of expressing, both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations, the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain (Proudfoot, 1986, Nature 322:52; and Kohler, 1980, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:2 197). The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA<br>
[0077]	Polypeptides can be produced by standard recombinant DNA techniques.<br>
For example, PCR amplification of gene fragments can be carried out using anchor primers<br>
which give rise to complementary overhangs between two consecutive gene fragments<br>
which can subsequently be annealed and reamplified to generate a chimeric gene sequence<br>
(see, e.g., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel et al., eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons,<br>
1992). Moreover, a nucleic acid encoding a bioactive molecule can be cloned into an<br>
expression vector containing the Fc domain or a fragment thereof such that the bioactive<br>
molecule is linked in-frame to the Fc domain or Fc domain fragment<br>
[0078]	Methods for fusing or conjugating polypeptides to the constant regions of<br>

[0079]	The nucleotide sequences encoding a bioactive molecule and an Fc domain<br>
or fragment thereof may be an be obtained from any information available to those of skill in the art (i.e., from Genbank, the literature, or by routine cloning). The nucleotide sequence coding for a polypeptide a fusion protein can be inserted into the dual expression vector.<br>
[0080]	The expression of the polypeptide in eukaryotic cells may be controlled by<br>
any promoter or enhancer element known in the art Promoters which may be used to control the expression of the gene encoding fusion protein include, but are not limited to, the SV40 early promoter region (Bernoist and Chambon, 1981, Nature 290:304-310), the promoter contained in the 3* long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus (Yamamoto et al, 1980, Cell 22:787-797), the herpes thymidine kinase promoter (Wagner et al,1981, Proc. NatL Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78:1441-1445), the regulatory sequences of the metallothionein gene (Brinster et al, 1982, Nature 296:39-42), the tetracycline (Tet) promoter (Gossen et al, 1995, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 89:5547 5551); and in bacteria, prokaryotic promoters<br><br>
such as the β-Iactamase promoter (Villa-Kamaroff et  al.,1978, Proc. Nafl. Acad. Sci. U.SA. 75:3727-3731), or the tac promoter (DeBoer et al, 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S A 80:21-25; see also "Useful proteins from recombinant bacteria" in Scientific American, 1980,242:74-94); in plant cells, the nopaline synthetase promoter region (Herrera-Estrella et al., Nature 303:209-213) or the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S RNA promoter (Gardner et al, 1981, Nucl. Acids Res. 9:2871), and the promoter of the photosynthetic enzyme ribulose biphosphate carboxylase (Herrera-Estrella et a/., 1984, Nature 310:115-120); promoter elements from yeast or other fungi such as the Gal 4 promoter, the ADC (alcohol dehydrogenase) promoter, PGK (phosphoglycerol kinase) promoter, and the alkaline phosphatase promoter.<br>
[0081]	In a specific embodiment, the expression of a polypeptide is regulated by a<br>
constitutive promoter, such as the CMV promoter. In another embodiment, the expression of a polypeptide is regulated by an inducible promoter.<br>
[0082]	Expression vectors containing inserts of a gene encoding a polypeptide can<br>
be identified by three general approaches: (a) nucleic acid hybridization, (b) presence or<br>
absence of "marker" gene functions, and (c) expression of inserted sequences. In the first<br>
approach, the presence of a gene encoding a polypeptide in an expression vector can be<br>
detected by nucleic acid hybridization using probes comprising sequences that are<br>
homologous to an inserted gene encoding the polypeptide, respectively. In the second<br>
approach, the recombinant vector/host System can be identified and selected based upon the<br>
presence or absence of certain "marker" gene functions (e.g., thymidine kinase activity,<br>
resistance to antibiotics, transformation phenotype, occlusion body formation in<br>
baculovirus, etc.) caused by the insertion of a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide<br>
in the vector. For example, if the nucleotide sequence encoding the fusion protein is<br>
inserted within the marker gene sequence of the vector, recombinants containing the gene<br>
encoding the fusion protein insert can be identified by the absence of the marker gene<br>
function, hi the third approach, recombinant expression vectors can be identified by<br>
assaying the gene product (e.g., fusion protein) expressed by the recombinant Such assays<br>
can be based, for example, on the physical or functional properties of the fusion protein in<br>
in vitro assay systems, e.g., binding with anti bioactive molecule antibody.<br>
[0083]	Any of the methods previously described for the insertion of DNA fragments<br>
into a vector may be used to construct expression vectors containing a chimeric gene consisting of appropriate transcriptional/translational control signals and the protein coding sequences. These methods may include in vitro recombinant DNA and synthetic techniques and in vivo recombinants (genetic recombination). Expression of IgG heavy or light chain<br><br>
in mammalian cells may be regulated by a second nucleic acid sequence so that the igu heavy or .light chain is expressed in a host transformed with the recombinant DNA molecule. For example, expression of IgG heavy or light chain may be controlled by any promoter/enhancer element known in the art<br>
[0084]	Preferably, the bacterial expression of Fab fragments or full-length IgG is<br>
controlled by an inducible promoter. Inducible expression yielding a wide range of expression can be obtained by utilizing a variety of inducible regulatory sequences. In one embodiment, for example, the lad gene and its gratuitous inducer IPTG can be utilized to yield inducible, high levels of expression of Fab fragments in E. coli when sequences encoding such polypeptides are transcribed via the lacOP regulatory sequences. A variety of other inducible promoter systems are well known to those of skill in the art which can also be utilized. Levels of expression from IgG dual expression vector system can also be varied by using promoters of different strengths.<br>
[0085]	Other regulated expression systems that can be utilized include but are not<br>
limited to, the araC promoter which is inducible by arabinose (AraC) (see, e.g., Schleif,<br>
2000, Trends Genet 16:559-565), the TET system (Geissendorfer and Hillen, 1990, Appl.<br>
Microbiol. fiiotechnoL 33:657-663), the pL promoter of phage λ temperature and the<br>
inducible lambda repressor CI857 (Pirrotta, 1975, Nature 254:114-117; Petrenko et aL,<br>
1989, Gene 78:85-91), the trp promoter and ftp repressor system (Bennett et aL,1976, Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci USA 73:2351-55; Wame et aL, 1986, Gene 46:103-112), the /acUV5<br>
promoter (Gilbert and Maxam, 1973, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 70:1559-63), Ipp<br>
(Nokamuta et aL, 1982, J. Mol. AppL Gen. 1:289-299), the T7 gene-10 promoter, phoA<br>
(alkaline phosphatase), recA (Horii et aL, 1980, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:313 7), and<br>
the tac promoter, a trp-lac fusion promoter, which is inducible by IPTG (Amann et aL,<br>
1983, Gene 25:167-78), for example, are all commonly used strong promoters, resulting in<br>
an accumulated level of about I to 10% of total cellular protein for a protein whose level is<br>
controlled by each promoter. If a stronger promoter is desired, the tac promoter is<br>
approximately tenfold stronger than lacUV5, but will result in high baseline levels of<br>
expression, and should be used only when overexpression is required. If a weaker promote:<br>
is required, other bacterial promoters are well known in the art, for example, maltose,<br>
galactose, or other desirable promoter (sequences of such promoters are available from<br>
GenBank (Burks et aL 1991, Nucl. Acids Res. 19:2227-2230).<br>
[0086]	For eukaryotic expression of full-length IgG heavy or light chain, vectors<br>
will include eukaryotic-specific replication origins and promoter regions, which include specific sequences that are sufficient for RNA polymerase recognition, binding and<br><br>
transcription initiation. Additionally, promoter1 regions include sequences that modulate the<br>
recognition, binding and transcription initiation activity of RNA polymerase. Such<br>
sequences may be cis acting or may be responsive to trans acting factors. Depending upon ■<br>
the nature of the regulation, promoters maybe constitutive or regulated. Promoters that<br>
may be used to control Tnpl expression include, but are not limited to, the SV40 early<br>
promoter region (Benoist and Chambon, 1981, Nature 290:304-310), the promoter<br>
contained in the 3' long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus (Yamamoto et al.,1980, Cell<br>
22:787-797), the herpes thymidine kinase promoter (Wagner et al.,1981, Proc. Natl. Acad.<br>
Sci. U.S.A. 78:1441-1445), the regulatory sequences of the metallothionein gene (Brinster<br>
et al.,1982, Nature 296:39-42); plant expression vectors comprising the nopaline synthetase<br>
promoter region (Herrera-Estrella et al.,1984, Nature 303:209-213) or the cauliflower<br>
mosaic virus 35S RNA promoter (Gardner et al., 1981, Nucl. Acids Res. 9:2871), and the<br>
promoter of the photosynthetic enzyme ribulose biphosphate carboxylase (Herrera-Estrella<br>
et al.,1984, Nature 310:115-120); promoter elements from yeast or other fungi such as the<br>
Gal 4 promoter, or the ADC (alcohol dehydrogenase) promoter.<br>
[0087]	Vectors that contain both a promoter and a cloning site into which a<br>
polynucleotide can be operatively linked are well known in the art Such vectors are<br>
capable of transcribing RNA in vitro or in vivo, and are commercially available from<br>
sources such as Stratagene (La Jolla, Calif.) and Promega Biotech (Madison, Wis.). In order<br>
to optimize expression and/or in vitro transcription, it may be necessary to remove, add or<br>
alter 5* and/or 3* untranslated portions of the cloned DNA to eliminate extra, potential<br>
inappropriate alternative translation initiation codons or other sequences that may interfere<br>
with or reduce expression, either at the level of transcription or translation. Alternatively,<br>
consensus ribosome binding sites can be inserted immediately 5' of the start codon to<br>
enhance expression (see, e.g., Kozak, 1991, J. Biol. Chem. 266:19867). Similarly,<br>
alternative codons, encoding the same amino acid, can be substituted for coding sequences<br>
in order to enhance translation (e.g., the codon preference of the host cell can be adopted,<br>
the presence of G-C rich domains can be reduced, and the like).<br>
[0088]	The vector may also contain nucleotide sequences of interest for protein<br>
expression, manipulation or maintenance of the inserted target DNA For example,<br>
promoter sequences, enhancer sequences, translation sequences such as Shine and Dalgarno<br>
sequences, transcription factor recognition sites, Kozak consensus sequences, and<br>
termination signals may be included, in the appropriate position in the vector.<br>
[0089]	The vector should also include signal sequences which may be natural or<br>
synthetic in origin. Signal sequences which may target polypeptides, e.g., antibodies such<br><br>
as IgG, to the inner cell membrane can also be used Leader sequences, associated wiin proteins naturally destined for the periplasm, are, for example, known to direct the secretion of foreign proteins to the periplasm (Maclntyre et aL, 1990, MoL Gen. Genet 221:466-474). In a preferred embodiment, the signal sequence encodes the QmpA protein leader sequence (Hobom et aL,1995, Dev. Biol. Stand. 84-255-262). Other signal sequences are also possible, including, but not limited to, the leaders from E. coli PhoA (Oka et aL,1985, Proc. Natl. Acad Sci 82:7212-16), OmpT (Johnson et aL, 1996, Protein Expression 7:104-113), LamB and OmpF (Hoffman &amp; Wright, 1985, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 82:5107-5111), 0-lactamase (Kadonaga et aL, 1984, J. Biol. Chem. 259:2149-54), enterotoxins (Morioka-Fujimoto et aL, 1991,1 Biol. Chem. 266:1728-32), protein A from<br>
*<br>
Staphylococcus aureus (Abrahmsen et aL, 1986, Nucleic Acids Res. 14:7487-7500), endoglucanase from B. subtilis (Lo et aL, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 54*-2287-2292), as well as artificial and synthetic signal sequences (Maclntyre et aL, 1990, MoL Gen. Genet 221:466-74; Kaiser et al., 1987, Science, 235:312-317).<br>
[0090]	Any method known in the art for delivering a DNA preparation comprising<br>
the dual expression vector cassette sequences into a host cell is suitable for use with the<br>
methods described above. Such methods are known in the art and include, but are not<br>
limited to electroporation of cells, preparing competent cells with calcium or rubidium<br>
chloride, and transduction of DNA with target DNA packaged in viral particles. For<br>
eukaryotic cells, methods include but are not limited to electroporation, transfection with<br>
calcium phosphate precipitation of DNA, and viral packaging. In a preferred embodiment,<br>
electroporation is used. Cells are treated to make them competent for electroporation by<br>
standard methods (see Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene<br>
Publishing Associates and Wiley Interscience, New York). Preferably, about 50 fil of a<br>
standard preparation of electrocompetent cells is used for electroporation by standard<br>
procedures. In experiments that require the transformation of a linear or circular vector, 0.3<br>
fig or more of vector is preferably used. In experiments that require the transformation of a<br>
DNA preparation containing the IgG DNA, 0.3 fig or more is preferably used. For co-<br>
transformation experiments, the DNAs are preferably mixed before electroporation. After<br>
electroporation, the cells are preferably diluted in culture medium and incubated for an<br>
approximately 1 and a half hours recovery period before culturing under conditions to<br>
identify the phenotypic change conveyed by the selectable marker gene.<br>
[0091]	Optimally, the phenotypic change is resistance to an antibiotic and the cells<br>
are cultured on plates that contain the corresponding antibiotic. In this case, the antibiotic resistant colonies that appear after overnight culture will predominantly contain the desired<br><br>
subcloning product For the selectable marker, preferably antibiotic resistance markers are<br>
used, such as the kanamycin resistance gene from Tn903 (Friedrich and Soriano, 1991,<br>
Genes Dev. 5:1513-1523), or genes that confer resistance to other aminoglycosides<br>
(including but not limited to dihydrostreptomycin, gentamycin, neomycin, paromycin and<br>
streptomycin), the TEM-1 βlactamase gene from Tn9, which confers resistance to<br>
penicillin (including but not limited to ampicillin, carbenicillin, methicillin, penicillin N,<br>
penicillin O and penicillin V). Other selectable genes sequences including, but not limited<br>
to gene sequences encoding polypeptides which confer zeocin resistance (Hegedus et al<br>
1998, Gene 207:241-249). Other antibiotics that can be utilized are genes that confer<br>
resistance to amphenicols, such as chloramphenicol, for example, the coding sequence for<br>
chloramphenicol transacetylase (CAT) can be utilized (Eikmanns et al 1991, Gene 102:93-<br>
98). As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, other non-antibiotic methods to select<br>
for maintenance of the plasmid may also be used, such as, for example a variety of<br>
auxotrophic markers (see Sambrook et al., 1989, supra; Ausubel et al., supra).<br>
[0092]	In another embodiment, DNA is delivered into the host cell by transduction<br>
of DNA that has been packaged into a phage particle. P1 or X transduction and packaging protocols are known in the art Lambda packaging extracts are available commercially (e.g., from Promega, Madison, WI).<br>
10093]	Once an antibody molecule of interest has been produced by recombinant<br>
expression, it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. Further, the antibodies of the present invention or fragments thereof may be fixsed to heterologous polypeptide sequences described herein or otherwise known in the art to facilitate purification.<br>
5.2     METHODS FOR SELECTING AND SCREENING ANTIBODIES<br>
5.2.1   METHODS FOR SELECTION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF ANTIBODIES<br>
[0094]	Full-length IgG and Fab fragments of the present invention may be<br>
characterized in a variety of ways. In particular, full-length IgG and Fab fragments may be<br>
assayed for the ability to immunospecifically bind to an antigen of interest Such an assay<br>
may be performed in solution (e.g., Houghten, 1992, Bio/Techniques 13:412 421), or on a<br>
solid support such as a microliter dish, or on beads (Lam, 1991, Nature 354:82 84), on chips<br>
(Fodor, 1993, Nature 364:555 556), on bacteria (U.S. Patent No. 5,223,409), on spores<br><br>
(U.S. Patent Nos. 5,571,698; 5,403,484; and 5,223,409), on plasmids (Cull et al, 1992,<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:1865 1869) or on phage (Scott and Smith, 1990, Science<br>
249:386 390; Devlin, 1990, Science 249:404 406; Cwirla et al., 1990, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
USA 87:6378 6382; and Felici, 1991, J. Mol. Biol. 222:301 310) (each of these references is<br>
incorporated herein in its entirety by reference). Antibodies or fragments thereof that have<br>
been identified to immunospecifically bind to an antigen of interest or a fragment thereof<br>
can then be assayed for their specificity and affinity for an antigen of interest.<br>
[0095]	The antibodies of interest or fragments thereof may be assayed for<br>
immunoispecific binding to an antigen of interest and cross-reactivity with other antigens by any method known in the art Immunoassays which can be used to analyze immunospecific binding and cross-reactivity include, but are not limited to, competitive and non-competitive assay systems using techniques such as western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), "sandwich" immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, precipitin reactions, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion assays, agglutination assays, complement-fixation assays, immunoradiometric assays, fluorescent immunoassays, protein A immunoassays, to name but a few. Such assays are routine and well known in the art (see, eg., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New Yoik, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Exemplary immunoassays are described briefly below (but are not intended by way of limitation).<br>
[0096]	Immunoprecipitation protocols generally comprise lysing a population of<br>
cells in a lysis buffer such as RIPA buffer (1% NP-40 or Triton X-100,1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M sodium phosphate at pH 7.2,1% Trasylol) supplemented with protein phosphatase and/or protease inhibitors (e.g., EDTA, PMSF, aprotinin, sodium vanadate), adding the antibody of interest to the cell lysate, incubating for a period of time (e.g., 1 to 4 hours) at 40° C, adding protein A and/or protein G sepharose beads to the cell lysate, incubating for about an hour or more at 40° C, washing the beads in lysis buffer and resuspending the beads in SDS/sample buffer. The ability of the antibody of interest to immunoprecipitate a particular antigen can be assessed by, e.g., western blot analysis. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the binding of the antibody to an antigen and decrease the background (e.g., pre-clearing the cell lysate with sepharose beads). For further discussion regarding immunoprecipitation protocols see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York at 10.16.1.<br><br>
[0097]	Western blot analysis generally comprises preparing protein samples,<br>
electrophoresis of the protein samples in a polyacrylamide gel (e.g., 8%- 20% SDS-PAGE depending on the molecular weight of the antigen), transferring the protein sample from the polyacrylamide gel to a membrane such as nitrocellulose, PVDF or nylon, blocking the membrane in blocking solution (e.g.,PBS with 3% BSA or non-fat milk), washing the membrane in washing buffer (e.g.,PBS-Tween 20), blocking the membrane with primary antibody (the antibody of interest) diluted in blocking buffer, washing the membrane in washing buffer, blocking the membrane with a secondary antibody (which recognizes the primary antibody, e.g., an anti-human antibody) conjugated to an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase tit alkaline phosphatase) or radioactive molecule (e.g., 32P or 1251) diluted in blocking buffer, washing the membrane in wash buffer, and detecting the presence of the antigen. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected and to reduce the background noise. For further discussion regarding western blot protocols see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York at 10.8.1.<br>
[0098]	ELISAs comprise preparing antigen, coating the well of a 96 well microtiter<br>
plate with the antigen, adding the antibody of interest conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) to the well and incubating for a period of time, and detecting the presence of the antigen. In ELISAs the antibody of interest does not have to be conjugated to a detectable compound; instead, a second antibody (which recognizes the antibody of interest) conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to die well. Further, instead of coating the well with the antigen, the antibody may be coated to the well. In this case, a second antibody conjugated to a detectable compound may be added following the addition of the antigen of interest to the coated well. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art. For further discussion regarding ELISAs see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York at 11.2.1.<br>
[0099]	The binding affinity of an antibody to an antigen and the off-rate of an<br>
antibody-antigen interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled antigen (e.g.,3H or l25I) with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled antigen, and the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled<br><br>
antigen. The affinity of the antibody of the present invention or a fragment thereof for an antigen of interest and the binding off-rates can be determined from the data by scatchard plot analysis. Competition with a second antibody can also be determined using radioimmunoassays. In this case, an antigen of interest is incubated with an antibody of the present invention or a fragment thereof conjugated to a labeled compound (e.g.,3H or l25T) in the presence of increasing amounts of an unlabeled second antibody. [0100] In a preferred embodiment, BIAcore kinetic analysis is used to determine the binding on and off rates of antibodies or fragments thereof to an antigen of interest BIAcore kinetic analysis comprises analyzing the binding and dissociation of an antigen of interest from chips with immobilized antibodies or fragments thereof on their surface (see the Example section infra).<br>
[0101] Antibodies or fragments thereof can also be assayed for their ability to inhibit the binding of an antigen of interest to its host cell receptor using techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example, cells expressing the receptor for an antigen of interest can be contacted with the antigen in the presence or absence of the antibody or fragment thereof i.e., the Fab fragment, and the ability of the antibody or fragment thereof to inhibit an antigen of interest's binding can measured by, for example, flow cytometry or a scintillation assay. The antigen of interest or the antibody or antibody fragment can be labeled with a detectable compound such as a radioactive label (e.g., 32P, 35S, and 1251) or a fluorescent label (e.g., fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, phycoerythrin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, o-phthaldehyde and fluorescamine) to enable detection of an interaction between an antigen of interest and its host cell receptor. Alternatively, the ability of antibodies or fragments thereof to inhibit an antigen of interest from binding to its receptor can be determined in cell-free assays. For example, the antigen of interest can be contacted with an antibody or Fab fragment and the ability of the antibody or antibody fragment to inhibit an antigen of interest from binding to its host cell receptor can be determined. Preferably, the antibody or Fab fragment is immobilized on a solid support and the antigen of interest is labeled with a detectable compound. Alternatively, the antigen of interest is immobilized on a solid support and the antibody or Fab fragment is labeled with a detectable compound- The antigen of interest may be partially or completely purified (e.g., partially or completely free of other polypeptides) or part of a cell lysate. Further, an antigen may be a fusion protein comprising the antigen and a domain, such as a binding domain. Alternatively, an antigen can be biotinylated using techniques well known to those of skill in the art (e.g., biotinylation kit, Pierce Chemicals; Rockford, IL).<br><br>
[0102] The antibodies of interest or fragments thereof can also be assayed for their ability to inhibit or downregulate an activity of the antigen, using techniques known to those of skill in the art The antibodies or Fab fragments produced by the vector system of the invention can also be assayed for their ability to inhibit or downregulate the expression of an antigenic polypeptide. Techniques known to those of skill in the art, including, but not limited to, Western blot analysis, Northern blot analysis, and RT-PCR can be used to measure protein expression.<br>
[0103] The antibodies or Fab fragments produced by the vector system of the invention are preferably tested in vitro, and then in vivo for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity, prior to use in humans. For example, in vitro assays which can be used to determine whether administration of a specific antibody or composition of the present invention is indicated, include in vitro cell culture assays in which a subject tissue sample is grown in culture, and exposed to or otherwise administered an antibody or composition of the present invention, and the effect of such an antibody or composition of the present invention upon the tissue sample is observed. In various specific embodiments, in vitro assays can be carried out to determine if an antibody or composition of the present invention has a desired effect upon specific cell types. Preferably, the antibodies or Fab fragments produced by the vector system of the invention are also tested in in vitro assays and animal model systems prior to administration to humans. Further, in accordance with this embodiment, the tissues from the sacrificed rats can be examined for histological changes. [0104] In accordance with the invention, clinical trials with human subjects need not be performed in order to demonstrate the prophylactic and/or therapeutic efficacy of antibodies or Fab fragments produced by the vector system of the invention. In vitro and animal model studies using the antibodies or fragments thereof can be extrapolated to humans and are sufficient for demonstrating the prophylactic and/or therapeutic utility of said antibodies or antibody fragments,<br>
[0105] Antibodies or compositions of the present invention for use in therapy can be tested for their toxicity in suitable animal model systems, including but not limited to rats, mice, cows, monkeys, and rabbits. For in vivo testing of an antibody or composition's toxicity any animal model system known in the art may be used.<br>
[0106] Efficacy in treating or preventing viral infection may be demonstrated by detecting the ability of antibodies or Fab fragments produced by the vector system of the invention to inhibit infection of a pathogen, or to prevent, ameliorate or alleviate one or more symptoms associated with the antigen. The treatment is considered therapeutic if there is, for example, amelioration of one or more symptoms, or a decrease in mortality and/or morbidity<br><br>
following administration of an antibody or composition of interest Further, the treatment is considered therapeutic if there is an increase in the immune response following the administration of one or more antibodies or Fab fragments produced by the vector system of the invention which immunospecifically bind to one or more antigens. [0107] Antibodies or compositions of interest can be tested in vitro and in vivo for the ability to induce the expression of cytokines such as IFN-α, IFN-β IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-15. Techniques known to those of skill in the art can be used to measure the level of expression of cytokines. For example, the level of expression of cytokines can be measured by analyzing the level of RNA of cytokines by, for example, RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis, and by analyzing the level of cytokines by, for example, immunoprecipitation followed by western blot analysis and ELIS A. In a preferred embodiment, an antibody or Fab fragment produced by the vector system of the invention is tested for its ability to induce the expression of IFN-7. [0108] Antibodies or compositions of interest can be tested in vitro and in vivo for their ability to modulate the biological activity of immune cells, preferably human immune cells (e.g., T-cells, B-cells, and Natural Killer cells). The ability of an antibody or Fab fragment produced by the vector system of interest to modulate the biological activity of immune cells can be assessed by detecting the expression of antigens, detecting the proliferation of immune cells, detecting the activation of signaling molecules, detecting the effector function of immune cells, or detecting the differentiation of immune cells. Techniques known to those of skill in the art can be used for measuring these activities. For example, cellular proliferation can be assayed by 3H thymidine incorporation assays and trypan blue cell counts. Antigen expression can be assayed, for example, by immunoassays including, but are not limited to, competitive and non-competitive assay systems using techniques-such as western blots, immunohistochemistry radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), "sandwich" immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, precipitin reactions, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion assays, agglutination assays, complement-fixation assays, immunoradiometric assays, fluorescent immunoassays, protein A immunoassays and FACS analysis. The activation of signaling molecules can be assayed, for example, by kinase assays and electrophoretic shift assays (EMSAs). [0109] Antibodies or compositions of interest can also be tested for their ability to inhibit viral replication or reduce viral load in in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo assays. Antibodies or Fab fragments produced by the vector system of the invention can also be tested for their ability to decrease the time course of an infection, antibodies or Fab fragments produced by the Vector system of the invention can also be tested for their ability to increase the survival<br><br>
period of humans suffering from infection by at least 25%, preferably at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 75%, at least 85%, at least 95%, or at least 99%.  Further, antibodies or Fab fragments produced by the vector system of the invention can be tested for their ability reduce the hospitalization period of humans suffering from infection by at least 60%, preferably at least 75%, at least 85%, at least 95%, or at least 99%. Techniques known to those of skill in the art can be used to analyze the function of the antibodies or compositions ofinterestinvivo.<br>
5.2.2   METHODS OF SCREENING USING PHAGE DISPLAY [0110] As will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, there are numerous other methods of screening individual proteins or other compounds, as well as large libraries of proteins or other compounds (e.g.,phage display libraries) to identify molecules which bind to a particular antigen of interest.<br>
[0111] In phage display methods, functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In particular, DNA sequences encoding VH and VL domains are amplified from animal cDNA libraries (e.g., human or murine cDNA libraries of lymphoid tissues). The DNA encoding the VH and VL domains are recombined together with an scFv linker by PCR and cloned into a phagemid vector (e.g.,p CANTAB 6 or pComb 3 HSS). The vector is electroporated in E. coli and the E. coli is infected with helper phage. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and Ml 3 and the VH and VL domains are usually recombinantly fused to either the phage gene III or gene VIII. Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds to an antigen of interest of interest can be selected or identified with antigen, e.g., using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. Examples of phage display methods that can be used to make the antibodies of the present invention include those disclosed in Brinkman et al.,1995, J. Immunol. Methods 182:41-50; Ames et al., 1995, J. Immunol Methods 184:177-186; Kettleborough et al., 1994, Eur. J. Immunol. 24:952-958; Persic et al., 1997, Gene 187:9-18; Burton et al.,1994, Advances in Immunology 57:191-280; PCT application No, PCT/GB91/01134; PCT publication Nos. WO 90/02809, WO 91/10737, WO 92/01047, WO 92/18619, WO 93/1 1236, WO 95/15982, WO 95/20401, and W097/13844; and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,698,426, 5,223,409, 5,403,484,5,580,717,5,427,908,5,750,753, 5,821,047,5,571,698,5,427,908, 5,516,637,5,780,225,5,658,727, 5,733,743 and 5,969,108; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[0112] Examples of phage display libraries are described in Scott and Smith, 1990, Science 249:386-390; Devlin et al.,1990, Science, 249:404-406; Christian et al.,1992, J. MoL Biol.<br><br>
227:711-718; Lenstra, 1992, J. Immunol. Meth. 152:149-157; Kay et al.,1993; Gene 128:59 65; and PCT Publication No. WO 94/18318 dated August 18,1994. [0113] As described in the above references, after phage selection, the antibody coding regions from the phage can be isolated and used to generate whole antibodies, including human antibodies, or any other desired antigen binding fragment, and expressed in any desired host, including mammalian cells, insect cells, plant cells, yeast, and bacteria, e.g., as described below. Techniques to recombinantly produce Fab, Fab* and F(aV)2 fragments can also be employed using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in PCT publication No. WO 92/22324; Mullinax et al.,1992, BioTechniques 12(6):864-869; Sawai et al., 1995, AJRI 34:26-34; and Better et al., 1988, Science 240:1041-1043 (said references incorporated by reference in their entireties).<br>
[01141 To generate whole ahtibodies, PCR primers including VH or VL nucleotide sequences, a restriction site, and a flanking sequence to protect the restriction site can be used to amplify the VH or VL sequences in scFv clones. Utilizing cloning techniques known to those of skill in the art, the PCR amplified VH domains can be cloned into vectors expressing a VH constant region, e.g., the human gamma 4 constant region, and the PCR amplified VL domains can be cloned into vectors expressing a VL constant region, e.g., human kappa or lamba constant regions. Preferably, the vectors for expressing the VH or VL domains comprise an EF-la promoter, a secretion signal, a cloning site for the variable domain, constant domains, and a selection marker such as neomycin. The VH and VL domains may also cloned into one vector expressing the necessary constant regions. The heavy chain conversion vectors and light chain conversion vectors are then co-transfected into cell lines to generate stable or transient cell lines that express full-length antibodies, e.g., IgG, using techniques known to those of skill in the art<br>
5.2.3   METHODS FOR OPTIMIZATION OF ANTIBODY SEQUENCES [0115] In addition to its above-described applications for testing and characterizing novel antibodies, the dual expression vector may be used for optimization of existing antibodies for desired binding or therapeutic properties. In this aspect of the invention, nucleotide sequences encoding known IgG heavy or light chain sequences may be cloned in the dual expression vector system, and subjected to chemical, synthetic or genetic mutagenesis to alter its nucleotide sequence. Sequence variants may then be screened in bacteria and/or human cells for changes in characteristics of interest<br>
[0116] A polynucleotide encoding an antibody may be obtained, and the nucleotide sequence determined, by any method known in the aft. The nucleotide sequence of antibodies immunospecific for a desired,antioen can beo btained, e.g., from the literature or<br><br>
a database such as GenBank. Since the amino acid sequences of V1TAX1N"" is known, nucleotide sequences encoding this antibody can be determined using methods well known in the art, i.e., nucleotide codons known to encode particular amino acids are assembled in such a way to generate a nucleic acid that encodes the antibody. Such a polynucleotide encoding the antibody may be assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides (eg., as described in Kutmeier et al.,1994, BioTechniques 17:242), which, briefly, involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody, annealing and ligating of those oligonucleotides, and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR.<br>
[0117] Alternatively, a polynucleotide encoding an antibody may be generated from nucleic acid from a suitable source. If a clone containing a nucleic acid encoding a particular antibody is not available, but the sequence of the antibody molecule is known, a nucleic acid encoding the immunoglobulin may be chemically synthesized or obtained from a suitable source (eg., an antibody cDNA library, or acDNA library generated from, or nucleic acid, preferably poly A+ RNA, isolated from, any tissue or cells expressing the antibody, such as hybridoma cells selected to express an antibody of interest) by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3' and 5' ends of the sequence or by cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular gene sequence to identify, e.g., a cDNA clone from a cDNA library that encodes the antibody. Amplified nucleic acids generated by PCR may then be cloned into replicable cloning vectors using any method well known in the art.<br>
[0118] Once the nucleotide sequence of the antibody is determined, the nucleotide sequence of the antibody may be manipulated using methods well known in the art for the manipulation of nucleotide sequences, e.g., recombinant DKA techniques, site directed mutagenesis, PCR, etc. (see, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et ai., 1990, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2d Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY and Ausubel et al., eds., 1998, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY, which are both incorporated by reference herein in their entireties), to generate antibodies having a different amino acid sequence, for example to create amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions.<br>
[01191 In a specific embodiment, one or more of the CDRs is inserted within framework regions using routine recombinant DNA techniques. The framework regions may be naturally occurring or consensus framework regions, and preferably human framework regions (see, eg., Chothia et al.,1998, J. Mol. Bioll 278:457-479 for a listing of human framework regions). Preferably, the polynucleotide generated by the combination of the<br><br>
framework regions and CDRs encodes an antibody that specifically binds to a particular antigen. Preferably, as discussed suprat one or more amino add substitutions may be made within the framework regions, and, preferably, the amino acid substitutions improve binding of the antibody to its antigen. Additionally, such methods may be used to make amino acid substitutions or deletions of one or more variable region cysteine residues participating in an intrachain disulfide bond to generate antibody molecules lacking one or more intrachain disulfide bonds. Other alterations to the polynucleotide are encompassed by the present invention and within the skill of the art<br>

53      OTHER METHODS FOR USE WITH THE INVENTION<br>
5.3.1    USE OF THE DUAL EXPRESSION VECTOR SYSTEM TO EXPRESS OTHER POLYPEPTIDES AND FRAGMENTS THEREOF<br>
[0121] The dual expression vector system of the instant invention may be used to express any polypeptide of interest in a mammalian cell, and a fragment, preferably a soluble fragment, of said polypeptide in a bacterial cell, using the methods described for expressing antibodies disclosed herein. The polypeptide of interest should preferably be a membrane-bound or secreted polypeptide, and have a soluble domain which retains an activity which can be assayed when expressed and secreted into the periplasmic domain of a bacterial cell. Domains of interest may include, but are not limited to, DNA-binding domain, protein-protein interaction domains, a kinase domain or other enzymatic or functional protein domain.<br>
[0122] The dual expression vector is constructed by inserting an intron into the signal sequence of the full length polypeptide. The intron is designed to comprise a bacterial promoter and a signal sequence overlapping the splice acceptor sequence and in frame with the coding region of the polypeptide of interest, so that transcription from the bacterial promoter directs expression of the domain of interest in a bacterial cell. Methods for construction of such sequences are described in detail in the example provided below. [0123] The components of such a dual expression vector include: (a) a bacterial origin of replication, (b) a mammalian origin of replication, and (c) a mammalian promoter for expression operatively associated with a nucleotide sequence encoding said secreted or membrane-bound polypeptide, said nucleotide sequence comprising a mammalian signal sequence comprising at least one intron, said intron comprising a bacterial promoter and a bacterial signal sequence operatively associated with a sequence encoding said soluble domain of said polypeptide, such that said bacterial promoter and bacterial signal sequence direct expression and secretion of said soluble domain of said polypeptide into the periplasmic space in a bacterial cell and said mammalian promoter and said mammalian signal sequence directs expression and secretion of said polypeptide, wherein said promoter for expression in mammalian cells is operatively associated with said nucleotide sequence encoding said soluble domain of said polypeptide.<br>

53.2   DIAGNOSTIC USES OF ANTIBODIES [0129] Antibodies or Fab fragments produced by the vector system of fee invention can be used to assay antigen levels in a biological sample using classical immunohistological methods as described herein or as known to those of skill in the art (e.g., see Jalkanen et al., 1985, J. Cell Biol. 101:976-985; and Jalkanen et al.,1987, J. Cell. Biol. 105:3087-3096). Other antibody-based methods useful for detecting protein gene expression include immunoassays, such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELIS A) and the -   radioimmunoassay (RIA). Suitable antibody assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels, such as, glucose oxidase; radioisotopes, such as iodine (l25I,121I), carbon (I4C, sulfur (35S), tritium (3H), indium (121ln), and technetium (99Tc); luminescent labels, such as luminol; and fluorescent labels, such as fluorescein and xhodamine, and biotm. [0130] It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety, for a human subject, the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of 99Tc. The labeled antibody or antibody fragment will then preferentially accumulate at the location of cells which contain the specific protein. In vivo tumor imaging is described in S.W. Btirchiel et al., I mmunonharmacokinerics of Radiolabeled Antibodies and Their Fragments.' (Chapter 13<br><br>
in Tumor Imaging: The Radiochemical Detection of Cancer, S.W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes, eds., Masson Publishing Inc. (1982).<br>
[0131] Depending on several variables, including the type of label used and the mode of administration, the time interval following the administration for permitting the labeled molecule to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level is 6 to 48 hours or 6 to 24 hours or 6 to 12 hours. In another embodiment the time interval following administration is 5 to 20 days or 5 to 10 days.<br>
[0132] Presence of the labeled molecule can be detected in the subject using methods known in the art for in vivo scanning. These methods depend upon the type of label used. Skilled artisans will be able to determine the appropriate method for detecting a particular label. Methods and devices that may be used in the diagnostic methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, computed tomography (CT), whole body scan such as position emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and sonography. [0133] In a specific embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a radioisotope and is detected in the patient using a radiation responsive surgical instrument (Thurston et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,441,050). In another embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a fluorescent compound and is detected in the patient using a fluorescence responsive scanning instrument. In another embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a positron emitting metal and is detected in the patient using positron emission-tomography. In yet another embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a paramagnetic label and is detected in a patient using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).<br>
6.        EXAMPLES 6.1      EXPRESSION OF ANTI-CD16 Fab AND IgG [0134] To provide a basis for designing a dual expression vector for expression of Fab in E. coli and IgG in mammalian cells, the following preliminary studies were performed. Two vectors were constructed: first, a vector for expression of Fab molecules in E. colivand second, a vector for expression of IgG in mammalian cells. Heavy chain and light chain cDNAs of either chimeric or humanized versions of an anti CD16 Mab were used to validate expression vectors.<br>
[0135] In order to express Fab molecules in E. coli, a vector similar to that described by Barbas (Barbas et aL, 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. A. 88:7978 7982) was constructed, in which individual light chain (LC) sequences and VH CHI (Fd) chain sequences were each fused to the pelB signal peptide coding sequence under the control of the lac promoter<br><br>
operator (lacPO). The Fd segment sequences also contained sequences encoding both a C terminal His tag for purification and an HSV epitope tag for identification. [0136] This vector was used to secrete chimeric or humanized and CD16 Fab into the periplasm of E. coli (strains BL21 or XL1 Blue) at approximately 1 mg/L To test this material for binding activity, Fab was purified from periplasmic extracts and analyzed for the ability to bind the soluble portion of die CD16 receptor (sCD16) in a sandwich ELISA or to inhibit the binding of sCDl 6 to immune complexes. As shown in Figure 1, the purified chimeric Fab migrates as a single 25 kd band on an SDS PAGE gel after reduction, or a single 50 kd band without reduction. This indicates that the product is disulfide-lihked. On western blots, the bands are reactive with both anti LC and HSV tag antibody, indicating that both LC and Fd chains are present<br>
[0137] For expression of IgG, individual vectors were constructed in which sequences encoding the full length heavy chain (yl) or light chain (K) genes were fused to a murine VH signal sequence and placed downstream from the GMVie promoter/enhancer in die vector pCI neo (Promega). The murine VH signal peptide coding region contains the naturally occurring intron and was found to be very reliable for secreting both light and heavy chain sequences from a number of antibodies, hi contrast, cDNA sequences containing the signal peptide from the variable region being expressed for secretion resulted in more inconsistent results. Light and heavy chain plasmids for either chimeric or humanized anti CD16 were cotransfected into HEK 293 cells. Generally, 5 10 /ig/ml are secreted'into the culture medium after 3 days.<br>
[0138] The material purified from both vectors was tested for binding either directly in ELISA, or purified and assayed for inhibition of binding of sCD16 to immune complexes formed between fluorescein BSA and a human IgGl chimeric version of the anti fluorescein Mab 4 4 20. Inhibition of binding of sCD16 to immune complexes is shown in Figure 2. The protocol used was as follows: A MaxiSoip immunoplate (Nunc F96) was coated with 500 ng/well of BSA FTTC in carbonate buffer at 4°C over night The plate was blocked with 0.5 %BSA in PBST for 30 minutes at room temperature. 50 ng/well of Ch4 4 20 (Human IgGl) was added to die plate and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour to form the immune complex. The purified Ch3G8Fab, Ch3G8 (as positive control), and human IgGl (as negative control) were diluted in 0.5% BSA/PBST containing 0.5 ug/ml sCD16 G2 biotin to final concentrations indicated in die figure and added to the wells containing die immune complexes.  The plate was then incubated for 2 hours incubation at room temperature. The binding of sCDl 6 G2 biotin to the immune complex was detected by horseradish conjugated streptavidin (Pharmacia) in 1:5000 dilution. After 30 minutes<br><br>
incubation at room temperature, TMB (BioFX) was used as substrate for detection. Between the steps above, the plate was always washed 3 times with lx PBS/0.1% Tween 20 (PBST). The plate was kept at room temperature for 5 10 minutes for color development The reaction was stopped by 0.18M of sulfuric acid, and OD450nm was measured. [0139] As shown in Figure 3, this material was also active in direct binding to sCD16A. Soluble monomeric CD16 was captured onto an immunoplate that had been coated with the anti CD16 Mab LNK16. After washing out unbound ligand, dilutions of chimeric Fab were added to the plate that was then incubated for Ihr at room temperature. Bound Fab was then detected using a goat anti human Fab HRP conjugate followed by TMB development as described above. The results of this sCD16A binding assay are shown in Figure 3.<br>
6.1.1   EXPRESSION VECTOR FOR EXPRESSION OF IgG LIGHT AND HEAVY CHAIN IN MAMMALIAN CELLS AND Fab IN E. COLI<br>
[0140] The following strategy was used for design and construction of a dual expression<br>
vector for expression and screening of Fab fragments in E. coli and of IgG in mammalian<br>
cells.   In tins embodiment of the invention, to obtain efficient expression and secretion in<br>
both systems according to the instant invention, two conditions were imposed: first, for E<br>
coli expression and secretion, the signal peptides preceding the secreted polypeptide must<br>
be functional; and second, for mammalian expression and secretion, the message must be<br>
correctly spliced to join together the segments coding for the signal sequence. Since the<br>
region coding for the bacterial signal sequence overlaps with the mammalian splice acceptor<br>
site, the design of these two elements must be considered together.<br>
[0141] The pelB signal peptide coding sequence from pET2Sb was used as a template for<br>
design and construction of this synthetic segment This coding sequence was modified to<br>
maximize homology to a consensus 3' splice donor site, while retaining hydrophobic<br>
residues in the core of the signal peptide- This involved substituting leucine codons (CTC)<br>
for two alanine codons (GCC or GCT) to provide a pyrimidine stretch of adequate length<br>
for correct splicing. In addition, to provide a potential splicing branch point upstream from<br>
the pyrimidine stretch, an Ala codon (GCT) was changed to lie (ATC). Finally, in the<br>
region shared by the prokaryotic and mammalian signal peptides, residues were chosen at<br>
positions -1 and -2 which would most likely retain functional activity in both systems. To<br>
predict whether modified prokaryotic signal peptides would still retain favorable splice<br>
cleavage sites, sequences were analyzed by SignalP program which uses neural network<br>
algorithm (Nielsen et al., 1997, Int J. Neural Sys. 8,581 599). The potential functionality<br>
of the splice sites was assessed using the Splice Site Prediction program at the Berkeley<br><br>
Drosophila Genome Project web site (see Reese et al.9 J. Comput Biol., 1997,4(3):311 23). This program also uses a neural network algorithm trained on human genes. [0142] The plasmid vector pMGXl15 contains a minigene coding for a humanized heavy chain in the mammalian expression vector pCI neo. In this minigene, the only intron is within the region coding for the signal peptide. The precise splice junction is located in the Gly codon at position -4 to the signal peptide cleavage site (see Figure 4A-B). The designed segment shown in Figure 4A was introduced as follows: first, the lac promoter and operator (lacPO) sequence was obtained from pUC18 by PCR and introduced into pET25b as a Bgin Xbal fragment, replacing the T7 promoter, generating pMGX102. The lacPO sequence together with the pelB signal sequence was then amplified by PCR using pMGX102 as template. This fragment was then placed between the two fragments from pMGX115 comprising the 5' exon of the signal sequence (including the 5' splice site) and the heavy chain (VHCγI), respectively, using overlapping PCR. The alterations in the signal sequences were introduced during this process by designing them into the overlapping PCR primers used to join the segment coding for the mature VH to the segment containing the lacPO pelB sequence.  The resulting fragment was cloned into the expression vector pCI Neo, generating pMGX121.<br>
[0143] To determine if the alteration of the intron, splice junction and signal peptide would affect expression and secretion, expression.of pMGX121 was examined in HEK 293 cells. No deleterious effect was seen on expression, as measured in an ELISA in which human IgG is captured using an anti human Fc antibody and detected using an anti human heavy + light chain HRP conjugate.<br>
[0144] In order to provide a stop codon for E. coli expression of Fd (VH CHI fragment), a second intron was introduced into pMGX121 between CHI and the hinge region, generating pMGX578 (see Figure 4B). The intron from the native human 7I gene was amplified from genomic DNA by a nested PCR and joined to the other segments by overlapping PCR. Site directed mutagenesis was then performed to introduce a stop codon near the beginning of the intron. Again, the sequence was designed so as not to interfere with splicing, and the retention of the splice site sequence was examined using the program described above.  The resulting plasmid, pMGX579, was then sequenced and expression in HEK 293 ceils, when co transfected with LC (light chain) expression plasmid, was confirmed. [0145] To generate a similar LC expression plasmid, the signal intron containing the lacPO pelB sequences from pMGX121 was combined with the humanized light chain coding sequence by an overlapping PCR procedure and this fragment was cloned into pMGX581, which is identical to pMGX579 except that Act sites have been introduced at the 5' end of<br><br>
the CMVie promoter and at the 3' end of the SV40 polyA site to allow the entire expression cassette to be excised. This plasmid was named pMGX582.<br>
[0146] Expression of LC from this plasmid was tested as follows. E. coli strain XL 10 gold, harboring either pMGX506 or pMGX582 (LC), was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. Three hours later, cells were collected and the periplasmic fraction was isolated. This material was diluted 1/2 and 1/10 and applied to microliter plates which had been coated with goat and human Fab (Jackson). After incubating at room temperature for approximately one hour, the unbound material was washed out and the bound light chain (LC) was detected using HRP conjugated goat anti human LC (Biosource, Inc.). After one hour incubation at room temperature, the plate was developed using TMB reagent and color development stopped after approximately 10 minutes using 0.18 M H2S04. The results, shown in Figure 6, confirmed expression of LC in E. coli from this plasmid. Especially significant was the apparent secretion of the LC into the E. coli periplasm, indicating that the signal sequence was functional. Expression of IgG after cotransfection of this plasmid with heavy chain (HC) expression plasmid pMGXl 15 was also demonstrated. [0147] The plasmid pMGX583 was constructed in order to assess the expression of Fab in E. coli and IgG in mammalian cells. pMGX583 contains both HC and LC expression cassettes, each with the lacPO pelB intronic sequence. To construct pMGX583, the entire expression cassette, CMvie lacPO pelB LC S V40p A was excised by digestion with AscI and ligated into pMGX580 (which is identical to pMGX579 except that the AscI site was introduced into the 5' end of CMvie promoter). The expression of IgG from this plasmid has been confirmed by transfection into HEK 293 cell and followed by goat anti human Fc antibody captured EUS A. The IgG was purified by protein G chromatography and analyzed in SDS PAGE and Western blot Coomassie Blue staining and western blot of purified IgG expressed from pMGX583 in HEK 293 cells. Protein was analyzed in SDS PAGE under reduction condition. In the Western blot, 1:5000 dilution of goat anti human IgG(Fab')2 AP conjugated (Jackson) was used and developed by Chromogen. The results are shown in Figure 7.<br>
[0148] Expression of Fab in E. coli (strains BL21 or XLl-blue) from pMGX583 was also evaluated. Since pMGX121-derived plasmids do not contain a copy of the lac repressor gene, the plasmid pLacl (Novagen) was provided. pLacl is a chloramphenicol resistant plasmid that encodes the lac repressor protein and has a pl5a origin of replication which is compatible with pMGX121-derived vectors. pLacl and pMGX583 were contransfoimed into the E. coli, and colonies selected with ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Transformants were grown up and induced with ImM IPTG as described below. The Fab from a<br><br>
periplasmic extract was captured by sCD16A and detected by goat anti human F(ab*)2 HRP conjugated (Jackson), as shown in Figure 8. The same amount of periplasmic extract from un induced and induced (EPTG, 1 mM) were used. Commercially available human IgGl was used as control Serial dilutions of purified ch3G8Fab from the previous construct, as shown in Figure 2, was used as a standard. The estimated expression of Fab in periplasmic from pMGX583 plasmid is approximately 10 ng per ml of culture.<br>

[0149] The preliminary work described above has demonstrated that prokaryotic   ; transcription and translation signals can be introduced into the signal intron of an IgG heavy chain or light chain construct without reducing expression or secretion in mammalian cells. [0150] Enough Fab is prepared from E. coli obtain N terminal sequence of the LC and Fd fragment Mass spectroscopic analysis is performed on the intact Fab as well as the reduced and alkylated chains. A similar analysis is performed on Mab produced transiently in mammalian cells.<br>
[0151] To increase the Fab secretion level to the periplasm in bacteria, several modifications of peptide in the bacterial signal sequence region have been designed and constructed. The amino acids at a number of positions were reverted to that contained in the pelB sequence as shown below.<br>

To predict whether modified signal peptides still retain favorable splice cleavage sites, sequences were analyzed by SignalP program. The individual modifications have<br><br>
been made and are tested in the both bacterial and mammalian cell systems. Mutations have been introduced in the intron of the HC/Fd gene in a vector also containing the LC cDNA wife the original lacZ pelB segment from pMGX102 (z.e., wt pelB). In this way, the contribution of the mutations to increased secretion can be assessed by analysis of antigen binding by the secreted Fab in periplasmic extracts. For mammalian expression, the LC gene can be co transfected on a second plasmid. Combinations of mutations will then be made as dictated by the results of the initial analysis.<br>
[0152] Codon usage has also been shown to influence fee successful cleavage of signal peptides. To exploit this possibility, and to capture any unpredictable variation which could promote improved secretion, libraries of E. coli mutants are screened wife random variability introduced into this region. These are constructed with degenerate or doped oligonucleotides and screened by both a colony lift method and by high throughput screening of periplasmic extracts. The incorporation of epitope tags is particularly useful for this screening.<br>
[0153] Materials and Methods. Vectors are modified to introduce new genetic elements using basic cloning methods, overlapping PCR methods and site directed mutagenesis (Quick change kit, Stratagene). All new constructs are subjected to DNA sequencing to confirm that no unwanted mutations were introduced into the sequences dining construction.   To assure the stability of fee plasmids in E, coli. fee recipient strains are laclq+ and, if necessary, lacl is provided on a compatible plasmid or on fee construct itself. In addition, plasmid-bearing cells are grown in rich medium or wife glucose present prior to induction, in order to prevent induction of the lac promoter by CRP. The following protocol is followed for induction of expression. Cells are grown overnight at 30C from a single colony in L broth (10 g of Bactotryptone, 5g yeast extract, lOg NaCl per liter). The overnight culture is diluted 1/100 in LB and fee culture grown at 30°C to an OD600 of approximately 0.2. At this point, the culture is divided into three flasks and two are induced with either 0.1, or 1 mM BPTG respectively (from a lOOmM stock). The other flask will serve as a uniniduced control. Three hours after induction, cells are harvested and fee periplasmic fractioh isolated by osmotic shock. The resulting fraction is assayed for fee presence of Fab by ELISA and by western blot hi the ELISA assay, Fab is captured with Goat anti human light chain and detected wife mouse anti Fd followed by a rabbit anti mouse HRP conjugate. Purified Fab, either that described in the preliminary results section or obtained from a vendor, is used to generate a standard curve for the assay. [0154] For detection of fee retaining function of fee Fab, a captured antigen binding ELISA assay was applied. The purified Fab from periplasmic or unpurified periplasmic extraction<br><br>
was captured by SCD16 and detected by goat anti human F(ab')2 HRP conjugated antibody (Jackson). The commercial purified human IgGl was used as a negative control. [01551 Analysis of expression from mammalian cells. For measuring the expression and secretion level in mammalian cells, individual constructs, as indicated in Table 1, were expressed transiently in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK 293) by transfection with LipofectAMINE 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen). The day before transfection, cells were plated on poly D lysine precoated dishes (Becton Dickinson) at 5x 106 cells/dish (100 mm).  For each dish of cells, 18 fd of total DNA was diluted into 1.4 ml of OPTIMEMI Reduced Serum Medium (Invitrogen). 54 pi of LipofectAMINE Reagent (Invitrogen) was diluted into 1A ml of OPTI MEM I Reduced Serum Medium and incubated for S rains at room temperature. Diluted DNA and LIPOFECTAMINE Reagent were then combined and incubated at room temperature for 20 mins to allow complexes to form. The DNA LipofectAMINE Reagent complexes were directly added to the cells. The cells were incubated at 37°C in a CO2 (5%) incubator for 72 hrs to allow the recombinant IgG secretion to the medium. The conditional medium is assayed for the expression level of IgG by ELISA and Western Blot In the ELISA assay, IgG (in the conditional medium) is captured with goat anti human Fc antibody (Jackson) and detected with goat anti human IgG (light + heavy) HRP conjugate. Purified human IgGl from commercial was used for the standard curve.<br>
6.2      PHAGE DISPLAY AND SCREENING METHODS<br>
[0155] Screening methods for the exploitation of this vector involving both E. coli expressed Fabs and mammalian expressed IgGs are encompassed by the present invention. A modified version of pET25b is utilized to express Fab. In that case, the LC was not epitope-tagged and the Fd chain was expressed with a C terminal HS V tag followed by a hexahistidine tag for purification. This sequence is incorporated into the construct in two ways. First, an amber (TAG) stop codon is used instead of the ochre codon currently present (TAA). This allows read through translation in a suppressor (supE) strain of £ colt Such a construct is particularly useful for phage display and this strategy has been used previously (Hoogenboom et al, 1991, Nucleic Acids Res. 19: 4133 4137). The amber codon would be suppressed in a strain such as XL1 blue (supE44+), allowing for incorporation of Fab into phage particles, but not in BL21(sup ), the favored strain for Fab<br>
expression.<br>

Fusions to phage coat (gene Vm) or attachment (gene HI) protein coding regions have been most widely used in phage display. Fusions of the Fd (VH CHI) gene segment to each of these gene segments are constructed The genes are isolated by PCR from the fd tet phage. For the gene HI fusion, the segment from P198 to S406 of the gene is used. The fusion is constructed such that the gene HI segment replaces the hexahistadine tag in the above vector, retaining the HSV epitope tag between CHI and the gene HI segment A similar construct is made with a segment of the gene VtQ gene for multivalent display of Fab.<br>
[0158] Phage analysis Standard conditions are used for phage preparation and analysis. Phagemids are grown in E. coli strain XL1 Blue. Log phase cultures grown at 37°C are infected with helper phage VCSM13 and cultured for approximately 12 hr.  Phage are isolated from the culture supernatant by PEG/NaCl precipitation and the resulting pellet resuspended in TBS15.  A portion of the phage are analyzed by ELISA for the presence Fab on the surface. In addition bound phage are eluted from the immunoplate to determine the binding of the phage to surface bound sCD16 Ig or an identical preparation of sCD32 Ig. Phage bearing active anti CD16 Fab should bind to the former molecule but not the latter. Preincubation with sCD16 Ig in solution is used to block binding. Elution of the phagemid from the plates is performed using a low pH solution (glycine HC1 pH 2.2) followed by neutralization. Phagemids are plated with XL1 Blue on ampicillin containing plates for determination of titers.<br>
