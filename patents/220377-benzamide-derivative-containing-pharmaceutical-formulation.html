				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
BEN2AMIDE DERIVATIVE-CONTAINING PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATION HAVING IMPROVED SOLUBILITY<br>
AND ORAL ABSORPTIVITY Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates a pharmaceutical formulation with increased solubility containing benzamide derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which are useful as drugs, and especially anticancer drugs.  In particular, it relates to a pharmaceutical formulation containing high concentration of active ingredient with improved oral absorptivity, that may also be used as injection. Background Art<br>
The benzamide .derivatives used for the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts have histone deacetylase inhibitory action, and are useful as therapeutic and/or ameliorating agents for disease connected with cellular growth, as effect enhancers for gene therapy, and as immunosuppressants.  They exhibit particularly powerful effects as anticancer agents, and are effective for hematopoietic tissue tumors and solid tumors (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication HEI No. 10-152462 ) .<br>
However, while the benzamide derivatives used for the invention have very satisfactory absorptivity when orally administered to mice and rats, some cases of low absorptivity have been found in dogs.  Some cases of low absorptivity with oral administration have also been found even when the formulations are prepared using common additives such as lactose, corn starch, carboxymethyl cellulose, light anhydrous silicic acid, magnesium aluminometasilicate, magnesium stearate and titanium oxide.  It has therefore been considered difficult to achieve stable blood concentration only with formulation for oral administration containing benzamide<br>
derivative or salt thereof as an active ingredient.<br>
It has also been attempted to dissolve benzamide derivatives or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts in water, phosphate buffer solution and the like to make liquid drugs or injections, but their low solubility has made it impossible to obtain formulations of sufficient concentration.<br>
Thus, injections containing benzamide derivatives or their salts as active ingredients must have very large volumes because of the poor solubility of the active ingredients, and it has therefore been difficult to provide them as drugs.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide formulations with increased solubility and improved oral absorptivity for benzamide derivatives and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts that are useful as histone deacetylase inhibitors, and to provide injections containing the active ingredient at high concentration. In order to overcome the problems described above, the present inventors have conducted diligent research on addition of various additives to benzamide derivatives and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts to improve solubility and absorptivity, and as a result the present inventors have completed the present invention upon finding that this object can be achieved by using certain types of additives.<br>

Examples<br>
The present invention will now be explained in further detail by way of examples and a comparative example.  It is to be noted, however, that the present invention is not limited by these examples in any way. Example 1<br>
After thoroughly blending 100 mg of compound 1 with 10 ml each of 0.05 N hydrochloric acid solution, inethanol, ethanol, propylene carbonate, polysorbate 80, polyethylene glycol 400, polyethylene glycol 300, glycerin, dimethylacetamide or propylene glycol at room temperature, the supernatant obtained by centrifugal separation of each mixture was separated off and used as a pharmaceutical solution.  Comparative control samples were also prepared by thoroughly dissolving 100 mg of compound 1 with 10 ml each of purified water, sodium acetate buffer solution at pH 4.0 or sodium phosphate buffer solution at pH 6.8 at room temperature, and separating off the supernatant obtained by centrifugal separation.  Table 2 shows a result of measuring the concentration of compound 1 in each sample by HPLC analysis.  All of the samples of the present invention contained dissolved compound 1 at a concentration of 5 mg/ml or greater, which is a sufficient concentration for an injection.  On the other hand, all of the comparative control samples contained dissolved compound 1 only at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml or less, and therefore the concentration necessary for an injection could not be guaranteed.<br>
Example  2<br>
10.13 g of polyethylene glycol 400 and 1.08 g of polysorbate 80 and 200 mg of compound 1 were mixed together and, the mixture was completely dissolved by ultrasonic treatment for 30 minutes with occasional mixing.  The solution was filled into hard gelatin capsules so that the dosage can be 1.5 mg/kg based on body weight for dogs before administration, to prepare a pharmaceutical formulation. Example 3<br>
200 mg of compound 1, 700 mg of polyethylene glycol 4000, 800 mg of polyethylene glycol 6000, 600 mg of sodium lauryl sulfate and 1200 mg of sucrose ester of fatty acid were weighed out and mixed in an agate mortar, and the mixture was pulverized with a pestle.  The mixed powder was filled into hard gelatin capsules so that the dosage can be 1.5 mg/kg based on body weight for dogs before administration, to prepare a pharmaceutical formulation.<br>
Examplja4<br>
200 mg of compound 1, 1350 mg of glutamic acid hydrochloride and 1950 mg of D-mannitol were weighed out and mixed in an agate mortar, and the mixture was pulverized with a pestle.  The mixed powder was filled into hard gelatin capsules so that the dosage can be 1.5 mg/kg based on body weight for dogs before administration, to prepare a pharmaceutical formulation. Comparative Example I<br>
200 mg of compound 1 and 1000 mg of D-mannitol were weighed out and mixed in an agate mortar, and the mixture was pulverized with a pestle.  The mixed powder was filled into hard gelatin capsules so that the dosage can be 1.5 mg/kg based on body weight for dogs before administration, to prepare a pharmaceutical formulation. Example 5<br>
Solubility evaluation test in water The content of each of the pharmaceutical formulations obtained in Examples 2 to 4 and Comparative Example 1 was mixed with water, and the solubility was evaluated by measurement of concentration of compound 1 by HPLC or observation of clarity and color in the supernatant.  Table 3 shows the solubility evaluation result based on measurement of concentration of compound 1 by HPLC or observation of clarity and color in each supernatant, after the content of each of the formulations obtained in Examples 2 to 4 and Comparative Example 1 (amount of compound 1 is 20 mg) was mixed with 1 to 1000 ml of purified water.  According to the result for Example 2, no precipitation of compound 1 was found with mixture of water at any proportion.  For Examples 3 and 4, it was found that the solubility was about 4 times and about 100 times that of Comparative Example 1,<br>
Table 3: Solubility of each pharmaceutical formulation in water<br><br>
In the table, the symbol x represents no dissolution of compound 1, and the symbol O represents complete dissolution of compound 1.<br>
Oral absorptivity evaluation test<br>
The pharmaceutical formulations obtained in Examples 2 to 4 and Comparative Example 1 were orally administered to fasted male beagles with 20 ml of water. Approximately 2.5 ml of blood was intravenously sampled into a heparinized container at 15, 30 and 45 minutes and 1, 2, 4, 6 and 9 hours after administration, and the blood was centrifuged and the plasma was collected.  The active ingredient was separated by solid phase extraction from the plasma, and the concentration was measured by high performance liquid chromatography.  The result is shown in Fig. 1.  Examples 2 to 4 all had higher absorptivity than the comparative example 1.<br>
Table 4 shows the pharmacokinetic parameters for the oral administration of the pharmaceutical formulations obtained in Examples 2 to 4 and Comparative Example 1 to the fasted male beagles with 20 ml of water.  Examples 2 to 4 all exhibited a higher AUC and Cmax than those of the comparative example 1, and improved absorptivity with oral administration.<br>

Industrial Applicability<br>
