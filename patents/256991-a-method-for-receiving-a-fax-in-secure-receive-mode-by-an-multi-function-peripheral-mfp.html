				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates, in general, to fax/ multifunction peripherals (MFP). Further, this invention relates to security in facsimile communication while sending / receiving in order to ensure confidentiality and data security. More particularly, this invention explains a method and system for secure fax reception with automatic password generation.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
This invention provides the desired enhanced confidentiality of message communications (e.g., fax documents) by providing unrestricted access to part of the message transmission (e.g., a header message) and a restricted access to the remainder of the message. The unrestricted portion identifies the message recipient and indicates the existence of a restricted portion of the message. Access to the restricted portion, illustratively, requires one or more of the following: submitting a password to the receiving apparatus and using the appropriate key for decrypting the restricted portion (when the restricted portion has been previously encrypted by the sender). For these two approaches, processing power is needed at the recipient's apparatus, and that power is provided by a processor within the apparatus or, if a higher level of security is desired, by a smart card possessed by the recipient.<br>
In one arrangement, all but a header message portion (which identifies an intended<br><br>
recipient) of a received message is restricted and, optionally, encrypted using either a public key, K.sub.RP, of an intended recipient of the message or a sender's private or secret key, K.sub.SS. The outputted header message portion informs the recipient (and all who care to know) of the receipt of a restricted (unencrypted or encrypted) message. Access to the restricted message (and decrypting, if necessary) is available after either 1) the recipient completes a login and password process or 2) the recipient inserts his/her smart card into the apparatus and enters a personal security code which is authenticated by the apparatus. According to another feature of the invention, the recipient can select which of a plurality of received stored encrypted messages is to be decrypted and outputted.<br>
The present invention also enables a message sender to insert a smart card and access an "address book" within it. The sending apparatus displays the addressee list (name and number) obtained from the sender's smart card and enables the sender to select a recipient (and various encryption keys) to whom the sender's message is to be sent. The sender's message may then be encrypted using the recipient's public key K.sub.RP or sender's private key K.sub.SS and sent to the recipient's apparatus.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
The above invention and the existing technology in general have certain limitations / drawbacks<br><br>
a)	Every user who has an access to the system should have a smart card which authenticates the access. This is a major drawback since any new user configured to the system should be provided with a smart card. Hence the cost overhead is more in this case.<br>
b)	The user will not have access if he has lost the smart card.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention addresses the weaknesses of the above invention. It has other major advantages also. In the system proposed by the present invention, different users can be configured. When a particular user is configured to the machine, the mobile number and e-mail address of the user is also configured into the system. When the configured user receives a fax, the dynamic password generator associated with the machine generates a password for that particular fax and sends it to the user through an SMS, with a notification that the user has received a fax message.<br>
Accordingly, this invention encompasses a method for secure fax reception with automatic password generator comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	configuring the user who can use the secure fax option by configuring, the mobile number and the email ID;<br>
(b)	receiving a FAX by the MFP;<br>
(c)	checking if the MFP is in a secure receive mode;<br><br>
(d)	checking whether the FAX is intended to a particular user who's name is configured in secure receive mode;<br>
(e)	encrypting and storing the said FAX in a hard disk associated with MFP if the said FAX is for a configured user;<br>
(f)	generating password by a dynamic automatic password generator module;<br>
(g)	sending the dynamically generated password as an SMS to the mobile configured by the corresponding user;<br>
(h) entering the user name and the said dynamically generated password in the MFP and printing the fax that the said user has received; and<br>
(i) sending the password generated to the user through Email if the user has not taken a printout of the received fax within a specified time.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention further encompasses a system for secure fax reception with automatic password generator comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	means for configuring the user who can use the secure fax option by configuring, the mobile number and the email ID;<br>
(b)	means for receiving a FAX by the MFP;<br>
(c)	means for checking if the MFP is in a secure receive mode;<br>
(d)	means for checking whether the FAX is intended to a particular user who's name is configured in secure receive mode;<br>
(e)	means for encrypting and storing the said FAX in a hard disk / RAM associated with MFP if the said FAX is for a configured user;<br>
(f)	means for generating password by a dynamic automatic password generator module;<br><br>
(g) means for sending the dynamically generated password as an SMS to the<br>
mobile configured by the corresponding user; (h) means for entering the user name and the said dynamically generated<br>
password in the MFP and printing the fax that the said user has received;<br>
and (i)   means for sending the password generated to the user through Email if the<br>
user has not taken a printout of the received fax within a specified time.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows the flow chart implementation of the present invention<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the<br><br>
claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Figure 1 shows the flow chart implementation of the present invention.<br>
1.	A fax is send to the receiver.<br>
2.	A check is made to find out whether the FAX is for a secure fax configured user.<br>
3.	If the fax is for a configured user, generate new password. 4.If the fax is not for a configured user then Print incoming fax. 5.Then SMS the password to the mobile of configured user.<br>
6.Then a check is made to confirm if the user access the fax within specified time. 7. If the fax is not accessed with in the said specified time, email the password to the email ID of configured user.<br>
The way the SECURE FAX WITH AUTOMATIC PASSWORD GENERATOR works is described as below.<br>
The apparatus consists of an MFP with a dynamic password generator. The dynamic password generator generates an x-character password (where x is a natural number), which is a combination of alphabets and numerals. In the MFP with SECURE FAX WITH AUTOMATIC PASSWORD GENERATOR we will be able to configure "n" users to the MFP (Depending on design specification). What is meant by configure is that one can set the user who can use the secure fax option.<br><br>
While configuring, the mobile number and the email id of the user is also configured. Only the person who has the administrative privileges can enable or disable the secure receive option or configure a user.<br>
When a MFP receives a FAX it checks for two things<br>
i)	Is the MFP in Secure Receive mode?<br>
ii)        If it is in secure receive mode, then it checks whether the FAX is intended to a particular user who's name is configured in secure receive.<br>
Now let us look at how the MFP differentiates between a fax which came to the configured user and a normal fax (in which user is not configured.) When the MFP with secure receive, receives a fax from a normal T.30 fax, it stores the incoming fax in the memory. After that it parses the first fifteen lines of fax for the string "To: USER_NAME" (Where "USER_NAME" will be the user name of a configured Secure fax user).<br>
If it does not come across "USER_NAME" during parsing or the "USER_NAME" does not match with any of the configured user it just prints out the fax. If the "USER_NAME" matches with any of the configured user, the fax is then encrypted and stored in the storage device (hard disk/Ram) associated with MFP. Then the dynamic automatic password generator module in MFP will generate a password. This is sent as an SMS to the mobile configured by the corresponding user along with the dynamically generated password. This password will be a combination of alphabets and numerals which are generated according to a<br><br>
permutation and combination algorithm. So this password will keep on varying every time, providing enhanced security.<br>
Once this password is generated by the automatic password generator module of MFP, the password authentication in the MFP to the corresponding user will be set as the newly generated password. Once the configured user receives this SMS he can enter his user name and the dynamically generated password in the MFP and then print the fax that he has received. If the user has not responded (i.e. not taken a printout of the received fax) within a specified time (say 2 hours), The password generated earlier is send to the user through Email assuming that the configured user is not accessing the mobile hand set at that point of time.<br>
Here the overhead on providing individual smart card is reduced. Also the password generated is dynamic and hence provides enhanced security.<br>
Effects/Advantage(s) of the Invention<br>
1)	Since password for each incoming secure fax is generated, the chances of password misuse are minimized.<br>
2)	Enhanced Privacy and Security.<br>
3)	Low cost compared to existing secure fax systems.<br>
Additional care is taken to send the dynamically generated password by email, so that the user can retrieve the fax even if the SMS is accidentally erased by user.<br><br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatus can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
