				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The technical field relates to mobile data communications, and more particularly, to<br>
regulating uplink communications from mobile radio terminals in a radio access network.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
There is an ever increasing demand for wireless communication devices to perform a<br>
variety of applications. Some of those applications require substantial bandwidth. For<br>
example, next generation wireless communication systems may offer high speed downlink<br>
packet access (HSDPA) and high speed uplink packet access (HSUPA) to provide enhanced<br>
data rates over the radio interface to support Internet access and multimedia type applications.<br>
The enhanced uplink concept currently being considered in the 3rd Generation Project<br>
Partnership (3 GPP) intends to introduce substantially higher peak data rates over the radio<br>
interface in the uplink direction. Enhanced uplink data communications will likely employ<br>
fast scheduling and fast hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) with soft combining in the<br>
radio base station. Fast scheduling allows the radio base station to control when a wireless<br>
terminal is transmitting in the uplink direction and at what data transmission rate. Data<br>
transmission rate and transmission power are closely related, and scheduling can thus also be<br>
seen as a mechanism to vary the transmission power used by the mobile terminal for<br>
transmitting over an enhanced uplink channel. Because neither the amount of uplink data to<br>
be transmitted nor the transmission power available in the mobile terminal at the time of<br>
transmission is known to the radio base station. As a result, the final selection of data rate<br>
will likely be performed in the mobile terminal. But the radio base station can set an upper<br>
limit on the data rate and/or transmission power that the mobile terminal may use to transmit<br>
over an enhanced uplink data channel.<br>
Although the primary focus of enhanced uplink is on the radio interface performance<br>
and efficiency, the "bottleneck" may well occur further upstream from the radio interface in<br>
the transport of the uplink information between nodes in the radio access network (RAN).<br>
For example, the available uplink bit rate over the interface between a radio base station node<br>
in the RAN and a radio network controller node in the RAN (referred to as the Iub interface)<br>
may be a fraction of the available uplink bit rate over the radio interface. In this situation,<br>
high speed uplink packet access may overload the Iub interface between the radio base station<br>
and the radio network controller during peak bit rates. Figure 1 illustrates that even though<br>
the downlink HSDPA bit rate over the radio interface is higher than the uplink HSUPA bit<br>
2<br>
 <br>
rate, the available bandwidth for high speed packet access data between the radio network<br>
controller and the radio base station is even less than the uplink HSUPA bit rate. The dashed<br>
line representing Iub High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) bandwidth limit is lower that the<br>
HSDPA and HSUPA bandwidths.<br>
Consider the following simple example. A radio base station (sometimes referred to<br>
as a "Node B" using 3GPP terminology) controls three cells that have an enhanced uplink<br>
data transmission capability. Assume that the radio base station is connected to a radio<br>
network controller using one 4 Mbps link to support the enhanced uplink data transmitted<br>
from the radio base station and the radio network controller. Assume that the enhanced<br>
uplink capability may be up to 4 Mbps per cell. In this situation, enhanced uplink<br>
communication data from three cells at or near capacity cannot be transported from the radio<br>
base station to the radio network controller over the single 4 Mbps link. The result is a<br>
congested or overload situation. This congestion could result in long delays and loss of data,<br>
which reduces quality of service.<br>
One possible solution to avoid this kind of overload situation would be to "over<br>
provision" the bandwidth resources in the radio access network for communications between<br>
radio network controllers and radio base stations. But this is inefficient, costly, and in some<br>
existing mobile communications networks, not practical. For high speed downlink, an<br>
HSDPA flow control algorithm could be employed by the radio base station to reduce the<br>
available downlink HSDPA bit rate to a level that suits the Iub interface bandwidth. But this<br>
control methodology cannot be employed in the opposite uplink direction because, as<br>
explained above, the amount of uplink data to be transmitted from mobile terminals is not<br>
known to the radio base station. Should the uplink enhanced bit rate over the radio interface<br>
significantly exceed the Iub uplink bandwidth, congestion will likely occur with long delays<br>
and possibly lost or otherwise corrupted data frames. What is needed, therefore, is a way to<br>
detect and then control an overload or other congested situation in the radio access network<br>
as a result of uplink mobile terminal communications being transported between nodes in the<br>
radio access network.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The technology described herein meets this need as well as other needs. Congestion<br>
associated with transporting in the RAN uplink information originating from one or more<br>
mobile terminals is detected. That detected congestion is then reduced using any suitable<br>
technique(s) and may be implemented in one or more nodes in the RAN. One advantageous<br>
3<br>
 <br>
(but non-limiting) application is to a RAN that supports high speed uplink packet access<br>
(HSUPA) and/or one or more enhanced uplink dedicated channels (E-DCHs). Uplink<br>
congestion may be detected over an interface between a radio network controller and a radio<br>
base station (the Iub interface) and/or an interface between radio network controllers (the Iur<br>
interface).<br>
Although congestion reduction may be performed in any suitable fashion, one<br>
example approach is to reduce a parameter associated with a bit rate at which uplink mobile<br>
terminal information is transported through the RAN. For example, where the uplink mobile<br>
terminal information is communicated using uplink data flows, the bit rate parameter may be<br>
reduced by reducing a bit rate of one or more uplink data flows. It may be appropriate to limit<br>
the bit rate of the one or more uplink data flows actually causing the congestion in the RAN;<br>
alternatively, the bit rate of one or more lower priority uplink data flows may be reduced.<br>
There are a number of different ways that the bit rate parameter may be reduced. For<br>
example, a bit rate parameter value may correspond to an absolute bit rate parameter value or<br>
a relative bit rate parameter value sent to one or more mobile terminals, e.g., a maximum bit<br>
rate or transmission power or a percentage or fraction of a current bit rate or transmission<br>
power. Another approach is to reduce the bit rate parameter using a capacity limitation<br>
message. If the RNC detects a congested condition in the RAN, it can send a capacity<br>
limitation to a radio base station, which then schedules uplink transmissions from mobile<br>
terminals to effect that capacity limitation, e.g., by using scheduling grants or credits.<br>
In some situations, more drastic measures may be necessary to reduce the bit rate<br>
parameter such as dropping one or more frames of one or more uplink mobile terminal<br>
communications. In soft/softer handover situations, one or more of the diversity handover<br>
links may be released to reduce the bit rate parameter. Another technique employs sending<br>
negative acknowledgment messages for received packets back to the mobile terminal causing<br>
the mobile terminal to retransmit those negatively acknowledged packets. This effectively<br>
reduces the uplink bit rate through the RAN.<br>
The congestion control may be implemented by sending control information either<br>
over a separate control signaling channel or in a user data plane where the control signaling is<br>
sent along with the data over a data channel.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In the following description, for purposes of explanation and non-limitation, specific<br>
details are set forth, such as particular nodes, functional entities, techniques, protocols,<br>
standards, etc. in order to provide an understanding of the described technology. For<br>
example, one advantageous applications is to enhanced uplink communications in accordance<br>
with 3GPP specifications. But other applications and other standards may be employed. It<br>
will apparent to one skilled in the art that other embodiments may be practiced apart from the<br>
specific details disclosed below. In other instances, detailed descriptions of well-known<br>
methods, devices, techniques, etc. are omitted so as not to obscure the description with<br>
unnecessary detail. Individual function blocks are shown in the figures. Those skilled in the<br>
art will appreciate that the functions of those blocks may be implemented using individual<br>
hardware circuits, using software programs and data in conjunction with a suitably<br>
programmed microprocessor or general purpose computer, using applications specific<br>
integrated circuitry (ASIC), and/or using one or more digital signal processors (DSPs).<br>
Referring to Figure 2, an example network 10 that supports wireless communications<br>
is illustrated. Network 10 may accommodate one or more standard architectures including a<br>
universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) and other systems based on code<br>
division multiple access (CDMA), GPRS/EDGE and other systems based on time division<br>
multiple access (TDMA) systems, etc. In CDMA, different wireless channels are<br>
5<br>
 <br>
distinguished using different channelization codes or sequences, (these distinct codes are used<br>
to encode different information streams), which may then be modulated at one or more<br>
different carrier frequencies for simultaneous transmission. A receiver may recover a<br>
particular stream or flow for the receive signal using the appropriate code or sequence to<br>
decode the received signal. In TDMA, the radio spectrum is divided into time slots. Each<br>
time slot allows only one user to transmit and/or receive. TDMA requires precise timing<br>
between the transmitter and the receiver so that each user may transmit its information during<br>
its allocated time slot.<br>
The network 10 includes a radio access network (RAN) 14 and one or more core<br>
network(s) 12. One example radio access network is the UMTS terrestrial access network<br>
(UTRAN) used in third generation cellular systems. Core network 14 typically supports<br>
circuit-based communications as well as packet-based communications. The RAN 14<br>
includes one or more radio network controllers (RNCs) 16. Each RNC is coupled to one or<br>
more radio base stations (RBSs) 18 sometimes referred to as Node B's. The communications<br>
interface between Node Bs and RNCs is referred to as the Iub interface, and the<br>
communications interface between RNCs is referred to as the Iur interface. Transport of<br>
information over the Iub and Iur interfaces is typically based on asynchronous transfer mode<br>
(ATM) or Internet Protocol (IP). Wireless terminals 20 (referred to hereafter as mobile<br>
terminals) communicate over an air or radio interface with the RAN 14. The radio interface<br>
is referred to as the Uu interface. The two center mobile terminals are shown communicating<br>
with both RBSs 18.<br>
Although attention has recently been paid to high speed downlink packet access<br>
(HSDPA), there is increasing interest in high speed uplink packet access (HSUPA), also<br>
referred to as "enhanced uplink" and as enhanced uplink dedicated channel (E-DCH).<br>
Enhanced uplink employs several uplink channels from each mobile terminal with an active<br>
uplink connection as illustrated in Figure 3. The enhanced dedicated physical data channel<br>
(E-DPDCH) carries enhanced uplink data (at higher bit rates), in addition to the normal<br>
dedicated physical data channels (DPDCHs) used for regular uplink data communication.<br>
The dedicated physical control channel (DPCCH) carries pilot symbols and out-of-band<br>
control signaling. Out-of-band control signaling related to enhanced uplink, e.g., uplink<br>
scheduling requests, may be carried on the enhanced dedicated physical control channel (E-<br>
DPCCH).<br>
6<br>
 <br>
As explained above, there is the possibility, particularly with enhanced uplink data<br>
communications, that the enhanced uplink bit rate over the air interface exceeds the uplink<br>
bandwidth limits for communications between nodes in the radio access network. This point<br>
was illustrated in Figure 1. These kinds of bandwidth restrictions between nodes in a radio<br>
access network may only become more significant as radio access networks expand or<br>
become more complicated. Consider, for example, the radio access network shown in Figure<br>
4 in which multiple RNCs (RNC1, RNC2, ..., RNCn) are coupled to multiple radio base<br>
stations (RBS1, RBS2, ..., RBSn) by way of one or more aggregation nodes 22. The<br>
aggregation nodes 22 may be, for example, ATM switches, IP routers, etc. and are optional.<br>
Each aggregation node (1) aggregates data traffic from the RBSs to the RNCs and (2) splits<br>
the data traffic from the RNCs to the individual RBSs. In this more sophisticated radio<br>
access network, there are multiple Iur and Iub interfaces which may have limited bandwidth<br>
capability. Some type of congestion control should be in place to avoid congestion, delay,<br>
and overload situations caused by receiving uplink data over the radio interface at a rate<br>
greater than what can be currently transported over any one of these RAN interfaces.<br>
Reference is now made to the flowchart in Figure 5 which illustrates an uplink RAN<br>
congestion control routine. Congestion is monitored in the RAN that is associated with<br>
transporting uplink information through the RAN (step S2). An overload or congestion<br>
condition is detected between nodes in the RAN related to uplink information for example by<br>
detecting frame (or other data unit) losses (step S4). Frame losses may be detected using a<br>
frame sequence number (FSN). Each transport bearer between an RNC and a radio base<br>
station has its own sequence number. It is assumed that when a frame sequence number is<br>
detected as missing, that the corresponding frame is lost due to congestion.<br>
Alternatively, or in addition, delay build-up can be monitored to detect a congestion<br>
condition. In transport networks that include large buffers, congestion may not normally<br>
result in frame losses, but rather in a build-up of delay time in the buffer before packets are<br>
transmitted. Rather than relying on detected frame losses, which may result in severe delays,<br>
each user plane frame transmitted from a base station uplink to an RNC includes a field for a<br>
real-time stamp, e.g., a control frame number (CFN) plus a subframe number. If the RNC<br>
detects a time stamp "drift," meaning that the delay is increasing, the RNC can then<br>
determine there is congestion. For example, if uplink frames are delayed more than 30 msec<br>
in addition to the delay that is prevailing in non-congested circumstances, this is a good<br>
indicator of uplink congestion in the RAN.<br>
7<br>
 <br>
Returning to Figure 5, once an overload or congestion condition is detected, one or<br>
more actions is taken to reduce the detected uplink congestion in the RAN (step S6). There<br>
are various techniques and implementations for reducing that detected uplink congestion in<br>
the RAN. Some non-limiting examples are described below.<br>
Consider the example implementation shown in Figure 6 in which both the radio<br>
network controller 16 and the radio base station 18 perform certain tasks in reducing uplink<br>
RAN congestion. The RNC 16 includes an uplink RAN congestion detector 30 and uplink<br>
RAN congestion controller 32, and a handover controller 34. The RNC 16 includes other<br>
functional entities which are not pertinent to this description and therefore are not shown.<br>
The radio base station 18 includes an uplink RAN congestion controller 40, an automatic<br>
repeat request (ARQ) controller 42, (which in a preferred implementation is a hybrid ARQ<br>
(HARQ) controller), a mobile terminal uplink scheduler 44, and radio circuitry 46. The radio<br>
base station 18 has other entities and circuitry for performing the functions not pertinent to<br>
the description and therefore are not shown.<br>
The uplink RAN congestion detector 30 monitors and detects uplink RAN congestion<br>
using, for example, frame loss detection or delay build-up detection as described above.<br>
Other techniques may be employed. The uplink RAN congestion controller 32 processes<br>
congestion detection information provided by detector 30, and based on certain<br>
characteristics of one or more congested uplink flows, the uplink RAN congestion controller<br>
32 may decide to limit the uplink load in the RAN using any suitable methodology. For<br>
example, the congestion controller 32 may limit a maximum data rate/transmission power<br>
grant that the mobile terminal uplink scheduler 44 is allowed to assign to a particular mobile<br>
terminal or to a mobile terminal uplink data flow. The mobile terminal subjected to this<br>
maximum data rate/power restriction can be the same mobile terminal or data flow which is<br>
experiencing the congestion on one or more flows, or it may be a different mobile terminal or<br>
data flow, perhaps with a lower priority.<br>
Alternatively, the uplink RAN congestion controller 32 may limit the maximum data<br>
rate/transmission power that the uplink scheduler 44 is allowed to assign to a group of mobile<br>
terminals. The uplink RAN congestion controller 32 may communicate the maximum data<br>
rate/transmission power to the radio base station 18 using a CAPACITY LIMITATION<br>
message, as illustrated in Figure 7. The CAPACITY LIMITATION notification message<br>
includes the maximum bit rate/power that the uplink scheduler 44 may assign to one or more<br>
mobile terminal uplink flows. The CAPACITY LIMITATION message may also include a<br>
8<br>
 <br>
time interval over which the maximum bit rate/power restriction applies. On the other hand,<br>
the limits may remain in effect until a new capacity limitation message is received. The<br>
uplink CAPACITY LIMITATION notification may be sent either in the RAN "user plane"<br>
using a control frame embedded with the data or in the RAN "control plane" using control<br>
signaling over an explicit control channel. Example control signaling protocols includes<br>
Node B Application Part (NBAP) /RNS Application Part/RNSAP).<br>
The maximum bit rate/power may be expressed, for example, as an absolute limit,<br>
such as 200 Kbps, or as a prohibition from using a transport format indicator (TFI) exceeding<br>
a particular value, such as TFI 12. An example in terms of an absolute transmission power<br>
might be a maximum allowed transmission power offset, and an example of a relative limit<br>
might be a percentage by which to reduce the current bit rate/power, e.g., 50%. Again, the<br>
load may be reduced with respect to the affected mobile terminal, an affected uplink flow, an<br>
aggregated load of multiple mobile terminals, or different mobile terminals or different flows<br>
that are less prioritized than the affected one(s).<br>
Alternatively, when the uplink RAN congestion controller 40 in the radio base station<br>
18 receives a capacity limitation notification on the uplink RAN congestion controller 32, the<br>
congestion controller 40 may limit the scheduling grants assigned to a particular mobile<br>
terminal or group of mobile terminals. In a RAN supporting soft-handover, a mobile terminal<br>
can be connected to multiple cells controlled by one or several radio base stations. Of the<br>
cells in this "active set," the strongest (in terms of a pilot signal) is typically chosen as the<br>
"serving cell" responsible for the primary control of the mobile terminal. Via this serving<br>
cell, the radio base station can assign absolute grants limiting the maximum bit-rate/power of<br>
the mobile terminal. In order to control the, inter-cell interference, the radio base stations can<br>
also send relative grants via non-serving cells. Relative grants indicate if one or a group of<br>
mobile terminals should increase, hold, or decrease their current bit-rate/power. Any of these<br>
grants can be based on scheduling requests sent in the uplink from the mobile terminal to the<br>
radio base-stations. Such scheduling requests typically include, e.g., the desired bit-rate or<br>
the present buffer fill-levels in the mobile terminal.<br>
In the situation where the radio base station controls the serving cell of the mobile<br>
terminal, the uplink RAN congestion controller 40 limits the absolute grant of that mobile<br>
terminal; alternatively, the uplink RAN congestion controller 40 assigns relative grants<br>
(up/hold/down) so that the RNC capacity limitation is fulfilled. The uplink scheduler 44 can<br>
provide scheduling information to the mobile terminal to control the upper limit of the mobile<br>
9<br>
 <br>
terminal transmission data rate/transmission power. The "absolute grant channel" may carry<br>
an absolute scheduling grant on a shared channel which includes (a) the identity of the mobile<br>
terminal (or a group of mobile terminals) for which the grant is valid and (b) the maximum<br>
resources that this mobile terminal (or group of mobile terminals) may use. A "relative grant<br>
channel" carries a relative scheduling grant on a dedicated channel and includes at least one<br>
bit that registers an incremental up/hold/down. The absolute grant channel is read from the<br>
serving cell. The relative grant channel may be read from additional cells, e.g., in the case of<br>
soft handover, from all cells in the active set. If a mobile terminal is assigned to read the<br>
relative grant channel from a set of cells, the mobile terminal must not increase its data rate or<br>
power offset if any cell in the active set signals a hold. Similarly, if any of the cells relative<br>
grants is set to down, the mobile terminal must decrease the rate or power offset with some<br>
predefined step size. When the radio base station does not control the mobile terminal<br>
serving cell, the uplink RAN congestion controller 40 assigns relative grant indications<br>
(up/hold/down) to fulfill the RNC capacity limitation.<br>
As another alternative already explained above, the uplink RAN congestion controller 40<br>
may discard RAN data frames so that the RAN capacity limitation assigned by the RNC is<br>
fulfilled without affecting scheduling grants. Rather than discarding frames, the uplink RAN<br>
congestion controller 40 may instruct the H/ARQ controller 42 to send a NACK message for<br>
each received and discarded data unit back to the mobile terminal. NACKing the discarded<br>
data frames from a non-serving cell triggers re-transmission of those discarded data frames,<br>
unless some other link has received those data frames correctly. The effect is reduced<br>
pressure on the RAN transport.<br>
It is possible that the sending of capacity limitation control frames to inform the<br>
uplink RAN congestion controller 40 to lower the bit rate/transmission power relative to the<br>
normal bit rate/transmission power per HSUPA flow will result in the following behavior. If<br>
the uplink scheduler 44, which controls the HSUPA flow bit rates, lowers the flow bit rate<br>
from one of the mobile terminals by modifying its scheduling grants, it is likely that the<br>
uplink scheduler 44 will schedule another mobile terminals to transmit in its place.<br>
Moreover, it is likely that the mobile terminal associated with RAN congestion has excellent<br>
uplink radio/air interface performance. Therefore, scheduling another mobile instead of the<br>
congested mobile to transmit in the uplink should reduce the congestion of the uplink RAN<br>
congested flows.<br>
10<br>
 <br>
After recovery from a congestion condition, as detected by the uplink RAN<br>
congestion detector 30, the uplink RAN congestion controller 32 may restore the original data<br>
rate or transmission power by sending notification to the radio base station. Alternatively,<br>
and as explained above, a configurable or predefined period of time may be set after which<br>
the temporary restriction on the uplink scheduler 44 is released. This latter approach may be<br>
preferred because explicit signaling from the RNC is not required.<br>
Consider a situation in which the mobile terminal 20 that is subject to RAN<br>
congestion is in soft handover, as illustrated in Figure 8. In this example, mobile terminal 20<br>
has three soft handover links LI, L2, and L3 to three base stations RBS1, RBS2, and RBS3,<br>
respectively. Assume that the congested radio link L3 is not the "serving" handover link.<br>
Typically, the serving link is the strongest one of the handover links based on detected signal<br>
strength measurements. The uplink RAN congestion controller 32 may decide to release the<br>
weaker handover radio link L3, which is subject to congestion in the RAN, and leave links LI<br>
and L2. This congestion reduction approach has the benefit of not affecting the bit rate over<br>
the radio interface. Any capacity loss associated with loss of macro-diversity over the air<br>
interface is less impacting than the RAN congestion associated with link L3.<br>
The RAN Iub and Iur interfaces each likely have a maximum total uplink bandwidth.<br>
A certain, relatively small amount of each maximum bandwidth is allocated for control<br>
signaling. The rest of the remaining bandwidth may be divided as desired between uplink<br>
dedicated data channels (X) and enhanced uplink dedicated data channels (Y), where the<br>
remaining bandwidth = (X + Y). When the RNC detects uplink congestion over one of the<br>
interfaces, it sends a message to the RBS to reduce the enhanced uplink dedicated data<br>
channels bandwidth by a certain percentage selected to reduce the congestion without<br>
impacting the enhanced uplink services too much. When the congestion condition is<br>
alleviated or after a predetermined time period, the enhanced uplink dedicated data channels<br>
bandwidth may be restored to Y.<br>
The above technology solves the problem of uplink RAN congestion without having<br>
to over-provision the RAN transport network. The RAN congestion is reduced by adapting<br>
the uplink mobile transmissions load to the current uplink RAN resource situation. In other<br>
words, the data frame bit rate in the RAN can be adapted to present RAN bandwidth<br>
restrictions. As a result, the data frame delays and losses can be minimized even where the<br>
uplink radio interface could provide higher bit rates than what the RAN transport network can<br>
offer.<br>

UPLINK CONGESTION DETECTION AND CONTROL BETWEEN NODES IN A RADIO<br>
ACCESS NETWORK<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The technical field relates to mobile data communications, and more<br>
particularly, to regulating uplink communications from mobile radio terminals in a radio access<br>
network.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]	There is an ever increasing demand for wireless communication devices to<br>
perform a variety of applications. Some of those applications require substantial bandwidth.<br>
For example, next generation wireless communication systems may offer high speed downlink<br>
packet access (HSDPA) and high speed uplink packet access (HSUPA) to provide enhanced<br>
data rates over the radio interface to support Internet access and multimedia type applications.<br>
[0003]	The enhanced uplink concept currently being considered in the 3rd Generation<br>
Project Partnership (3GPP) intends to introduce substantially higher peak data rates over the<br>
radio interface in the uplink direction. Enhanced uplink data communications will likely<br>
employ fast scheduling and fast hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) with soft combining<br>
in the radio base station. Fast scheduling allows the radio base station to control when a<br>
wireless terminal is transmitting in the uplink direction and at what data transmission rate.<br>
Data transmission rate and transmission power are closely related, and scheduling can thus also<br>
be seen as a mechanism to vary the transmission power used by the mobile terminal for<br>
transmitting over an enhanced uplink channel. Because neither the amount of uplink data to be<br>
transmitted nor the transmission power available in the mobile terminal at the time of<br>
transmission is known to the radio base station. As a result, the final selection of data rate will<br>
likely be performed in the mobile terminal. But the radio base station can set an upper limit on<br>
the data rate and/or transmission power that the mobile terminal may use to transmit over an<br>
enhanced uplink data channel.<br>
[0004]	Although the primary focus of enhanced uplink is on the radio interface<br>
performance and efficiency, the "bottleneck" may well occur further upstream from the radio<br>
interface in the transport of the uplink information between nodes in the radio access network<br>
(RAN). For example, the available uplink bit rate over the interface between a radio base<br>
station node in the RAN and a radio network controller node in the RAN (referred to as the Iub<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/075951	PCT/SE2006/000032<br>
2<br>
interface) may be a fraction of the available uplink bit rate over the radio interface. In this<br>
situation, high speed uplink packet access may overload the Iub interface between the radio<br>
base station and the radio network controller during peak bit rates. Figure 1 illustrates that<br>
even though the downlink HSDPA bit rate over the radio interface is higher than the uplink<br>
HSUPA bit rate, the available bandwidth for high speed packet access data between the radio<br>
network controller and the radio base station is even less than the uplink HSUPA bit rate. The<br>
dashed line representing Iub High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) bandwidth limit is lower that<br>
the HSDPA and HSUPA bandwidths.<br>
[0005]	Consider the following simple example. A radio base station (sometimes<br>
referred to as a "Node B" using 3GPP terminology) controls three cells that have an enhanced<br>
uplink data transmission capability. Assume that the radio base station is connected to a radio<br>
network controller using one 4 Mbps link to support the enhanced uplink data transmitted from<br>
the radio base station and the radio network controller. Assume that the enhanced uplink<br>
capability may be up to 4 Mbps per cell. In this situation, enhanced uplink communication<br>
data from three cells at or near capacity cannot be transported from the radio base station to the<br>
radio network controller over the single 4 Mbps link. The result is a congested or overload<br>
situation. This congestion could result in long delays and loss of data, which reduces quality of<br>
service.<br>
[0006]	One possible solution to avoid this kind of overload situation would be to "over<br>
provision" the bandwidth resources in the radio access network for communications between<br>
radio network controllers and radio base stations. But this is inefficient, costly, and in some<br>
existing mobile communications networks, not practical. For high speed downlink, an HSDPA<br>
flow control algorithm could be employed by the radio base station to reduce the available<br>
downlink HSDPA bit rate to a level that suits the Iub interface bandwidth. But this control<br>
methodology cannot be employed in the opposite uplink direction because, as explained above,<br>
the amount of uplink data to be transmitted from mobile terminals is not known to the radio<br>
base station. Should the uplink enhanced bit rate over the radio interface significantly exceed<br>
the Iub uplink bandwidth, congestion will likely occur with long delays and possibly lost or<br>
otherwise corrupted data frames. What is needed, therefore, is a way to detect and then<br>
control an overload or other congested situation in the radio access network as a result of<br>
uplink mobile terminal communications being transported between nodes in the radio access<br>
network.<br>
 <br>

SUMMARY<br>
[0007]	The technology described herein meets this need as well as other needs.<br>
Congestion associated with transporting in the RAN uplink information originating from one<br>
or more mobile terminals is detected. That detected congestion is then reduced using any<br>
suitable technique(s) and may be implemented in one or more nodes in the RAN. One<br>
advantageous (but non-limiting) application is to a RAN that supports high speed uplink packet<br>
access (HSUPA) and/or one or more enhanced uplink dedicated channels (E-DCHs). Uplink<br>
congestion may be detected over an interface between a radio network controller and a radio<br>
base station (the Iub interface) and/or an interface between radio network controllers (the Iur<br>
interface).<br>
[0008]	Although congestion reduction may be performed in any suitable fashion, one<br>
example approach is to reduce a parameter associated with a bit rate at which uplink mobile<br>
terminal information is transported through the RAN. For example, where the uplink mobile<br>
terminal information is communicated using uplink data flows, the bit rate parameter may be<br>
reduced by reducing a bit rate of one or more uplink data flows. It may be appropriate to limit<br>
the bit rate of the one or more uplink data flows actually causing the congestion in the RAN;<br>
alternatively, the bit rate of one or more lower priority uplink data flows may be reduced.<br>
[0009]	There are a number of different ways that the bit rate parameter may be<br>
reduced. For example, a bit rate parameter value may correspond to an absolute bit rate<br>
parameter value or a relative bit rate parameter value sent to one or more mobile terminals,<br>
e.g., a maximum bit rate or transmission power or a percentage or fraction of a current bit rate<br>
or transmission power. Another approach is to reduce the bit rate parameter using a capacity<br>
limitation message. If the RNC detects a congested condition in the RAN, it can send a<br>
capacity limitation to a radio base station, which then schedules uplink transmissions from<br>
mobile terminals to effect that capacity limitation, e.g., by using scheduling grants or credits.<br>
[0010]	In some situations, more drastic measures may be necessary to reduce the bit<br>
rate parameter such as dropping one or more frames of one or more uplink mobile terminal<br>
communications. In soft/softer handover situations, one or more of the diversity handover<br>
links may be released to reduce the bit rate parameter. Another technique employs sending<br>
negative acknowledgment messages for received packets back to the mobile terminal causing<br>
the mobile terminal to retransmit those negatively acknowledged packets. This effectively<br>
reduces the uplink bit rate through the RAN.<br>

[0011]	The congestion control may be implemented by sending control information<br>
either over a separate control signaling channel or in a user data plane where the control<br>
signaling is sent along with the data over a data channel.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0020]	In the following description, for purposes of explanation and non-limitation,<br>
specific details are set forth, such as particular nodes, functional entities, techniques, protocols,<br>
standards, etc. in order to provide an understanding of the described technology. For example,<br>
one advantageous applications is to enhanced uplink communications in accordance with<br>
3GPP specifications. But other applications and other standards may be employed. It will<br>
apparent to one skilled in the art that other embodiments may be practiced apart from the<br>
specific details disclosed below. In other instances, detailed descriptions of well-known<br>
methods, devices, techniques, etc. are omitted so as not to obscure the description with<br>
unnecessary detail. Individual function blocks are shown in the figures. Those skilled in the<br>
art will appreciate that the functions of those blocks may be implemented using individual<br>

5<br>
hardware circuits, using software programs and data in conjunction with a suitably<br>
programmed microprocessor or general purpose computer, using applications specific<br>
integrated circuitry (ASIC), and/or using one or more digital signal processors (DSPs).<br>
[0021]	Referring to Figure 2, an example network 10 that supports wireless<br>
communications is illustrated. Network 10 may accommodate one or more standard<br>
architectures including a universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) and other<br>
systems based on code division multiple access (CDMA), GPRS/EDGE and other systems<br>
based on time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, etc. In CDMA, different wireless<br>
channels are distinguished using different channelization codes or sequences, (these distinct<br>
codes are used to encode different information streams), which may then be modulated at one<br>
or more different carrier frequencies for simultaneous transmission. A receiver may recover a<br>
particular stream or flow for the receive signal using the appropriate code or sequence to<br>
decode the received signal. In TDMA, the radio spectrum is divided into time slots. Each time<br>
slot allows only one user to transmit and/or receive. TDMA requires precise timing between<br>
the transmitter and the receiver so that each user may transmit its information during its<br>
allocated time slot.<br>
[0022]	The network 10 includes a radio access network (RAN) 14 and one or more<br>
core network(s) 12. One example radio access network is the UMTS terrestrial access network<br>
(UTRAN) used in third generation cellular systems. Core network 14 typically supports<br>
circuit-based communications as well as packet-based communications. The RAN 14 includes<br>
one or more radio network controllers (RNCs) 16. Each RNC is coupled to one or more radio<br>
base stations (RBSs) 18 sometimes referred to as Node B's. The communications interface<br>
between Node Bs and RNCs is referred to as the lub interface, and the communications<br>
interface between RNCs is referred to as the Iur interface. Transport of information over the<br>
lub and Iur interfaces is typically based on asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) or Internet<br>
Protocol (IP). Wireless terminals 20 (referred to hereafter as mobile terminals) communicate<br>
over an air or radio interface with the RAN 14. The radio interface is referred to as the Uu<br>
interface. The two center mobile terminals are shown communicating with both RBSs 18.<br>
[0023]	Although attention has recently been paid to high speed downlink packet access<br>
(HSDPA), there is increasing interest in high speed uplink packet access (HSUPA), also<br>
referred to as "enhanced uplink" and as enhanced uplink dedicated channel (E-DCH).<br>
Enhanced uplink employs several uplink channels from each mobile terminal with an active<br>
uplink connection as illustrated in Figure 3. The enhanced dedicated physical data channel (E-<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/075951	PCT/SE2006/000032<br>
6<br>
DPDCH) carries enhanced uplink data (at higher bit rates), in addition to the normal dedicated<br>
physical data channels (DPDCHs) used for regular uplink data communication. The dedicated<br>
physical control channel (DPCCH) carries pilot symbols and out-of-band control signaling.<br>
Out-of-band control signaling related to enhanced uplink, e.g., uplink scheduling requests, may<br>
be carried on the enhanced dedicated physical control channel (E-DPCCH).<br>
[0024]	As explained above, there is the possibility, particularly with enhanced uplink<br>
data communications, that the enhanced uplink bit rate over the air interface exceeds the uplink<br>
bandwidth limits for communications between nodes in the radio access network. This point<br>
was illustrated in Figure 1. These lands of bandwidth restrictions between nodes in a radio<br>
access network may only become more significant as radio access networks expand or become<br>
more complicated. Consider, for example, the radio access network shown in Figure 4 in<br>
which multiple RNCs (RNC1, RNC2, ..., RNCn) are coupled to multiple radio base stations<br>
(RBS1, RBS2, ..., RBSn) by way of one or more aggregation nodes 22. The aggregation<br>
nodes 22 may be, for example, ATM switches, IP routers, etc. and are optional. Each<br>
aggregation node (1) aggregates data traffic from the RBSs to the RNCs and (2) splits the data<br>
traffic from the RNCs to the individual RBSs. In this more sophisticated radio access network,<br>
there are multiple Iur and Iub interfaces which may have limited bandwidth capability. Some<br>
type of congestion control should be in place to avoid congestion, delay, and overload<br>
situations caused by receiving uplink data over the radio interface at a rate greater than what<br>
can be currently transported over any one of these RAN interfaces.<br>
[0025]	Reference is now made to the flowchart in Figure 5 which illustrates an uplink<br>
RAN congestion control routine. Congestion is monitored in the RAN that is associated with<br>
transporting uplink information through the RAN (step S2). An overload or congestion<br>
condition is detected between nodes in the RAN related to uplink information for example by<br>
detecting frame (or other data unit) losses (step S4). Frame losses may be detected using a<br>
frame sequence number (FSN). Each transport bearer between an RNC and a radio base<br>
station has its own sequence number. It is assumed that when a frame sequence number is<br>
detected as missing, that the corresponding frame is lost due to congestion.<br>
[0026]	Alternatively, or in addition, delay build-up can be monitored to detect a<br>
congestion condition. In transport networks that include large buffers, congestion may not<br>
normally result in frame losses, but rather in a build-up of delay time in the buffer before<br>
packets are transmitted. Rather than relying on detected frame losses, which may result in<br>
severe delays, each user plane frame transmitted from a base station uplink to an RNC includes<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/075951	PCT/SE2006/000032<br>
7<br>
a field for a real-time stamp, e.g., a control frame number (CFN) plus a subframe number. If<br>
the RNC detects a time stamp "drift," meaning that the delay is increasing, the RNC can then<br>
determine there is congestion. For example, if uplink frames are delayed more than 30 msec in<br>
addition to the delay that is prevailing in non-congested circumstances, this is a good indicator<br>
of uplink congestion in the RAN.<br>
[0027]	Returning to Figure 5, once an overload or congestion condition is detected, one<br>
or more actions is taken to reduce the detected uplink congestion in the RAN (step S6). There<br>
are various techniques and implementations for reducing that detected uplink congestion in the<br>
RAN. Some non-limiting examples are described below.<br>
[0028]	Consider the example implementation shown in Figure 6 in which both the<br>
radio network controller 16 and the radio base station 18 perform certain tasks in reducing<br>
uplink RAN congestion. The RNC 16 includes an uplink RAN congestion detector 30 and<br>
uplink RAN congestion controller 32, and a handover controller 34. The RNC 16 includes<br>
other functional entities which are not pertinent to this description and therefore are not shown.<br>
The radio base station 18 includes an uplink RAN congestion controller 40, an automatic<br>
repeat request (ARQ) controller 42, (which in a preferred implementation is a hybrid ARQ<br>
(HARQ) controller), a mobile terminal uplink scheduler 44, and radio circuitry 46. The radio<br>
base station 18 has other entities and circuitry for performing the functions not pertinent to the<br>
description and therefore are not shown.<br>
[0029]	The uplink RAN congestion detector 30 monitors and detects uplink RAN<br>
congestion using, for example, frame loss detection or delay build-up detection as described<br>
above. Other techniques may be employed. The uplink RAN congestion controller 32<br>
processes congestion detection information provided by detector 30, and based on certain<br>
characteristics of one or more congested uplink flows, the uplink RAN congestion controller<br>
32 may decide to limit the uplink load in the RAN using any suitable methodology. For<br>
example, the congestion controller 32 may limit a maximum data rate/transmission power<br>
grant that the mobile terminal uplink scheduler 44 is allowed to assign to a particular mobile<br>
terminal or to a mobile terminal uplink data flow. The mobile terminal subjected to this<br>
maximum data rate/power restriction can be the same mobile terminal or data flow which is<br>
experiencing the congestion on one or more flows, or it may be a different mobile terminal or<br>
data flow, perhaps with a lower priority.<br>
[0030]	Alternatively, the uplink RAN congestion controller 32 may limit the maximum<br>
data rate/transmission power that the uplink scheduler 44 is allowed to assign to a group of<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/075951	PCT/SE2006/000032<br>
8<br>
mobile terminals. The uplink RAN congestion controller 32 may communicate the maximum<br>
data rate/transmission power to the radio base station 18 using a CAPACITY LIMITATION<br>
message, as illustrated in Figure 7. The CAPACITY LIMITATION notification message<br>
includes the maximum bit rate/power that the uplink scheduler 44 may assign to one or more<br>
mobile terminal uplink flows. The CAPACITY LIMITATION message may also include a<br>
time interval over which the maximum bit rate/power restriction applies. On the other hand,<br>
the limits may remain in effect until a new capacity limitation message is received. The uplink<br>
CAPACITY LIMITATION notification may be sent either in the RAN "user plane" using a<br>
control frame embedded with the data or in the RAN "control plane" using control signaling<br>
over an explicit control channel. Example control signaling protocols includes Node B<br>
Application Part (NBAP) /RNS Application Part/RNSAP).<br>
[0031]	The maximum bit rate/power may be expressed, for example, as an absolute<br>
limit, such as 200 Kbps, or as a prohibition from using a transport format indicator (TFI)<br>
exceeding a particular value, such as TFI 12. An example in terms of an absolute transmission<br>
power might be a maximum allowed transmission power offset, and an example of a relative<br>
limit might be a percentage by which to reduce the current bit rate/power, e.g., 50%. Again,<br>
the load may be reduced with respect to the affected mobile terminal, an affected uplink flow,<br>
an aggregated load of multiple mobile terminals, or different mobile terminals or different<br>
flows that are less prioritized than the affected one(s).<br>
[0032]	Alternatively, when the uplink RAN congestion controller 40 in the radio base<br>
station 18 receives a capacity limitation notification on the uplink RAN congestion controller<br>
32, the congestion controller 40 may limit the scheduling grants assigned to a particular mobile<br>
terminal or group of mobile terminals. In a RAN supporting soft-handover, a mobile terminal<br>
can be connected to multiple cells controlled by one or several radio base stations. Of the cells<br>
in this "active set," the strongest (in terms of a pilot signal) is typically chosen as the "serving<br>
cell" responsible for the primary control of the mobile terminal. Via this serving cell, the radio<br>
base station can assign absolute grants limiting the maximum bit-rate/power of the mobile<br>
terminal. In order to control the inter-cell interference, the radio base stations can also send<br>
relative grants via non-serving cells. Relative grants indicate if one or a group of mobile<br>
terminals should increase, hold, or decrease their current bit-rate/power. Any of these grants<br>
can be based on scheduling requests sent in the uplink from the mobile terminal to the radio<br>
base-stations. Such scheduling requests typically include, e.g., the desired bit-rate or the<br>
present buffer fill-levels in the mobile terminal.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/075951	PCT/SE2006/000032<br>
9<br>
[0033]	In the situation where the radio base station controls the serving cell of the<br>
mobile terminal, the uplink RAN congestion controller 40 limits the absolute grant of that<br>
mobile terminal; alternatively, the uplink RAN congestion controller 40 assigns relative grants<br>
(up/hold/down) so that the RNC capacity limitation is fulfilled. The uplink scheduler 44 can<br>
provide scheduling information to the mobile terminal to control the upper limit of the mobile<br>
terminal transmission data rate/transmission power. The "absolute grant channel" may carry<br>
an absolute scheduling grant on a shared channel which includes (a) the identity of the mobile<br>
terminal (or a group of mobile terminals) for which the grant is valid and (b) the maximum<br>
resources that this mobile terminal (or group of mobile terminals) may use. A "relative grant<br>
channel" carries a relative scheduling grant on a dedicated channel and includes at least one bit<br>
that registers an incremental up/hold/down. The absolute grant channel is read from the<br>
serving cell. The relative grant channel may be read from additional cells, e.g., in the case of<br>
soft handover, from all cells in the active set. If a mobile terminal is assigned to read the<br>
relative grant channel from a set of cells, the mobile terminal must not increase its data rate or<br>
power offset if any cell in the active set signals a hold. Similarly, if any of the cells relative<br>
grants is set to down, the mobile terminal must decrease the rate or power offset with some<br>
predefined step size. When the radio base station does not control the mobile terminal serving<br>
cell, the uplink RAN congestion controller 40 assigns relative grant indications (up/hold/down)<br>
to fulfill the RNC capacity limitation.<br>
[0034]	As another alternative already explained above, the uplink RAN congestion<br>
controller 40 may discard RAN data frames so that the RAN capacity limitation assigned by<br>
the RNC is fulfilled without affecting scheduling grants. Rather than discarding frames, the<br>
uplink RAN congestion controller 40 may instruct the H/ARQ controller 42 to send a NACK<br>
message for each received and discarded data unit back to the mobile terminal. NACKing the<br>
discarded data frames from a non-serving cell triggers re-transmission of those discarded data<br>
frames, unless some other link has received those data frames correctly. The effect is reduced<br>
pressure on the RAN transport.<br>
[0035]	It is possible that the sending of capacity limitation control frames to inform the<br>
uplink RAN congestion controller 40 to lower the bit rate/transmission power relative to the<br>
normal bit rate/transmission power per HSUPA flow will result in the following behavior. If<br>
the uplink scheduler 44, which controls the HSUPA flow bit rates, lowers the flow bit rate<br>
from one of the mobile terminals by modifying its scheduling grants, it is likely that the uplink<br>
scheduler 44 will schedule another mobile terminals to transmit in its place. Moreover, it is<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/075951	PCT/SE2006/000032<br>
10<br>
likely that the mobile terminal associated with RAN congestion has excellent uplink radio/air<br>
interface performance. Therefore, scheduling another mobile instead of the congested mobile<br>
to transmit in the uplink should reduce the congestion of the uplink RAN congested flows.<br>
[0036]	After recovery from a congestion condition, as detected by the uplink RAN<br>
congestion detector 30, the uplink RAN congestion controller 32 may restore the original data<br>
rate or transmission power by sending notification to the radio base station. Alternatively, and<br>
as explained above, a configurable or predefined period of time may be set after which the<br>
temporary restriction on the uplink scheduler 44 is released. This latter approach may be<br>
preferred because explicit signaling from the RNC is not required.<br>
[0037]	Consider a situation in which the mobile terminal 20 that is subject to RAN<br>
congestion is in soft handover, as illustrated in Figure 8. In this example, mobile terminal 20<br>
has three soft handover links LI, L2, and L3 to three base stations RBS1, RBS2, and RBS3,<br>
respectively. Assume that the congested radio link L3 is not the "serving" handover link.<br>
Typically, the serving link is the strongest one of the handover links based on detected signal<br>
strength measurements. The uplink RAN congestion controller 32 may decide to release the<br>
weaker handover radio link L3, which is subject to congestion in the RAN, and leave links LI<br>
and L2. This congestion reduction approach has the benefit of not affecting the bit rate over<br>
the radio interface. Any capacity loss associated with loss of macro-diversity over the air<br>
interface is less impacting than the RAN congestion associated with link L3.<br>
[0038]	The RAN Iub and Iur interfaces each likely have a maximum total uplink<br>
bandwidth. A certain, relatively small amount of each maximum bandwidth is allocated for<br>
control signaling. The rest of the remaining bandwidth may be divided as desired between<br>
uplink dedicated data channels (X) and enhanced uplink dedicated data channels (Y), where<br>
the remaining bandwidth = (X + Y). When the RNC detects uplink congestion over one of the<br>
interfaces, it sends a message to the RBS to reduce the enhanced uplink dedicated data<br>
channels bandwidth by a certain percentage selected to reduce the congestion without<br>
impacting the enhanced uplink services too much. When the congestion condition is alleviated<br>
or after a predetermined time period, the enhanced uplink dedicated data channels bandwidth<br>
may be restored to Y.<br>
[0039]	The above technology solves the problem of uplink RAN congestion without<br>
having to over-provision the RAN transport network. The RAN congestion is reduced by<br>
adapting the uplink mobile transmissions load to the current uplink RAN resource situation. In<br>
other words, the data frame bit rate in the RAN can be adapted to present RAN bandwidth<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/075951	PCT/SE200fi/000032<br>
11<br>
restrictions. As a result, the data frame delays and losses can be minimized even where the<br>
uplink radio interface could provide higher bit rates than what the RAN transport network can<br>
offer.<br>
