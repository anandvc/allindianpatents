“A NATURAL ALLICIN TABLET AND PREPARATION METHOD<br>
THEREOF”<br>
YAO, YING, a Chinese Citizen of No 1-1 Guihuacheng Town House No. 69 Zijinhua Rd., Xihu, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310012, CHINA<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
A NATURAL ALLICIN TABLET AND PREPARATION METHOD THEREOF<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention relates to a plant extract preparation and more particularly, to a tablet comprising natural allicin with capability of anti-bacteria, anti-inflammation, and anti-virus and a method for producing the same.<br>
 Natural allicin is a mixture mainly composed of diallyl trisulfide, diallyl disulfide, diallyl-thiosulfinate, ajoene, and vinyldithiins. Generally, the allicin content refers to the total amount of the above mentioned five active ingredients. Natural allicin is extracted from garlic and plays a role something like broad-spectrum antibiotics and a vascular cleaner or protector. Thus, it exhibits strong medicinal functions.<br>
 As a vascular protector, a daily intake of between 5 and 80 mg of allicin is enough for a grownup. However, if functioning as broad-spectrum antibiotics to kill infectious viruses and bacteria, the administered allicin must be large. Many practices have proved the fact that the prevention and treatment effect on diseases caused by viruses or bacteria is poor when the intake amount does not exceed 120 mg each time for people. Conventional allicin tablets contain a limit dose of allicin, for example, 20 mg or 25 mg of allicin per piece, and the dosage is 2-3 times per day with 2-6 pieces per time. Obviously, the dosage amount is not enough for preventing and treating diseases. However, administering a large amount of allicin one time is harmful to body. Thus, it is urgent to develop an allicin tablet which can be administered largely within an effective dose but causes no harm to human body.<br>
 In view of the above-described problems, it is one objective of the invention to provide a tablet that comprises high content of allicin, can be administered according to the body weight of a human in need thereof, involves no artificial chemicals, and exhibits good effect on anti-bacteria,<br><br>
anti-inflammation, and anti-virus.<br>
 The allicin of the invention is 21-90% natural allicin powder produced and sold by Hangzhou Shenzhou Earth Ecology Culture Institute, and the other components of the tablet are purchased from market. The tablet has unexpected therapeutic effects.<br>
 The allicin tablet is produced by mixing the materials, uniformly stirring, and tabletting. The invention provides two kinds of the tablet.<br>
 A first tablet, without starch and garlic powder involved, comprises 1,000 weight parts of 21-90% natural allicin powder, 10-30 weight parts of 50-95% sesamin, 10-30 weight parts of 50-95% IgY or IgG, and a release agent, the allicin content of the tablet being 200-800 mg/g. The release agent ensures the molds to be easily released and not sticky in the process of tabletting, the addition amount thereof is not related to the allicin content. Preferably, the release agent is magnesium stearate.<br>
 A second tablet, comprises 1,000 weight parts of 62-80% natural allicin powder, 20-80 weight parts of 50-95% sesamin, 20-80 weight parts of 50-95% IgY or IgG, 38-460 weight parts of starch, 100-1500 weight parts of garlic powder, and a release agent, the allicin content of the tablet being 200-600 mg/g.<br>
Based on the allicin amount, four kinds of tablets are produced as follows.<br>
1. The tablet comprises 1,000 weight parts of 62-80% natural allicin powder, 20-80 weight parts of 50-95% sesamin, 20-80 weight parts of 50-95% IgY or IgG, 340-460 weight parts of starch, 550-1500 weight parts of garlic powder, and 6 weight parts of magnesium stearate, and the allicin content of the tablet is 200-400 mg/g.<br>
 2. The tablet comprises 1,000 weight parts of 62-80% natural allicin powder, 20-70 weight parts of 50-95% sesamin, 20-70 weight parts of 50-95%<br><br>
IgY or IgG, 80-460 weight parts of starch, 460-550 weight parts of garlic powder, and 4 weight parts of magnesium stearate, and the allicin content of the tablet is 300-500 mg/g.<br>
 3. The tablet comprises 1,000 weight parts of 62-80% natural allicin powder, 20-50 weight parts of 50-95% sesamin, 20-50 weight parts of 50-95% IgY or IgG, 38-80 weight parts of starch, 200-460 weight parts of garlic powder, and 3 weight parts of magnesium stearate, and the allicin content of the tablet is 400-600 mg/g.<br>
 4. The tablet comprises 1,000 weight parts of 62-80% natural allicin powder, 20-40 weight parts of 50-95% sesamin, 20-40 weight parts of 50-95% IgY or IgG, 38 weight parts of starch, 100-190 weight parts of garlic powder, 2 weight parts of magnesium stearate, and 10-100 weight parts of a cool or cold food additive, and the allicin content of the tablet is 400-600 mg/g.<br>
 As far as traditional Chinese medicine is concerned, garlic is hot-natured, so the natural allicin tablet is particularly suitable for humans with a cool- or cold-natured body. For humans with a hot-natured body, the above-mentioned cool or cold food additive can be added to the tablet. The cool or cold food additive is corn, wheat, barley, buckwheat, coix Seed, millet, mung bean, green bean sprouts, bitter melon, white fungus, seaweed, lettuce, aloe vera, white radish, asparagus, celery, water bamboo, coriander, white gourd, lily, towel gourd, spinach, amaranth , water spinach, fern, dandelion, clover blossom, sugar beet, sweet potato, konjak, water pack, eggplant, daylily, mushroom, cucumber, watermelon, melon, banana, rape, water chestnuts, water chestnut meat, lotus root, lotus seed, nelumbinis embryo, green tea, chrysanthemum, honeysuckle, apple, pear, orange, persimmon, hylocereus undatus, fruit, star fruit, mangosteen, strawberries, loquat, cherry tomato, medlar, grapefruit, kiwi fruit, soft-shelled turtle, turtle, duck, frog, jellyfish, snail, crab, clam, mussel, snakehead, snail, snake, or a mixture thereof, among which an extract from mungbean sprout or lily is preferable. The extract<br><br>
content is 40-95%. If the tablet comprises no cool or cold food additive, humans with a hot-natured body can eat sufficient cool or cold food when being administered with the tablet.<br>
The preparation method of the cool or cold food additive comprises grinding a raw material, extracting with liquor, filtering, removing residue and alcohol, and freeze-drying to yield a powder or powder block.<br>
 A method for producing the second tablet comprises mixing and uniformly stirring starch, garlic powder, and natural allicin powder, adding natural sesamin, Ig Y or Ig G, the release agent, and the cool or cold food additive, uniformly stirring, and tabletting.<br>
The allicin content of the natural allicin power is 65-75%.<br>
 The allicin tablet is 1,000 mg per piece, each piece containing 200-700 mg of allicin. The dosage is based on body weight, i.e., one piece per 10 kg of body weight per time, and 2-3 times per day.<br>
 The allicin tablet has high content of allicin. Clinical applications have shown that for a seriously-ill patient, natural allicin can weaken the diseases but the administered dosage must be large. Generally, the dosage is 200-700 mg/10 kg body weight. For example, for a person with weight body of 50 kg, the oral dosage of natural allicin should be 1,000-3,500 mg per time, and 2-3 times a day. The allicin tablet can effectively kill inflammation, viruses, and infectious bacteria, without side effects and drug resistance. Thus, it is very safe and moderate.<br>
 The above-mentioned conclusions are concluded from experiments carried out on white rabbits. 18 white rabbits (all were 1 kg in body weight) suffering from bacillary dysentery were divided into three groups (Group A, B, and C) randomly. The rabbits were treated separately. The treatment method and the results were shown in following table.<br><br>

No allicin was administered.          All the six rabbits died.<br>
 Additionally, experiments carried out on German shepherd puppies also proved the above conclusions.<br>
 Eight German shepherd puppies suffered from plague, two of which were treated with injections and medicine without allicin, finally died. The rest six were at their last gasp and could not stand up. The allicin tablet of the invention was administered to the six puppies, three times a day. On the first administration day, the puppies stood up, walked around, and took food. On the 3rd day, the puppies recovered completely, with good appetite and walked smoothly. In the process of treating the six puppies, no injections and medicine involved.<br>
 The following are clinical cases about the treatment effect of the natural allicin tablet on patients.<br>
 1. The natural allicin tablet was administered to nine patients (Ms. Yu, 24 years old, from Hangzhou; Ms. Feng, 37 years old, from Guangxi; Ms. Wang, 35 years old, from Zhejiang; Ms. Zhu, 34 years old, from Zhejiang; Ms. Wang, 53 years old, from Hangzhou; Ms. Yao, 53 years old, from Hangzhou; Mr. Qu, 21 years old, from Hangzhou; Ms. Liu, 38 years old, from Hangzhou; Mr. Ying, 56 years old, from Hangzhou;) catching a cold. After an hour, cold symptoms were alleviated. After three times' administration, the patients<br><br>
recovered completely.<br>
 2. A nephritis patient (Ms. Xu, 78 years old, from Hangzhou;) had high content of urine protein. After 15 days' administration of the natural allicin tablet, the urine protein content decreased greatly and fell into the normal range.<br>
3. A patient (a college student, 22 years old, from Hangzhou) almost recovered from leukemia after hospital treatment. However, the disease relapsed soon and worsened. He had a fever everyday and severe oral ulcer. The natural allicin tablet was administered to the patient. Three days later, his body temperature was back to normal and the oral ulcer disappeared.<br>
 4. A lymphoma patient (Mr. Yao, 53 years old, from Hangzhou) experiencing chemotherapy had severe oral ulcer and could not eat. Nothing but the natural allicin tablet was administered to the patient. Four days later, the oral ulcer disappeared.<br>
 5. A nasopharyngeal carcinoma patient (a friend of Mr. Yao, 50 years old, from Hangzhou) experiencing chemotherapy had severe oral ulcer. Chinese medicine and anti-inflammatory drugs were tried but had no effect. The natural allicin tablet was administered to the patient. Four days later, the oral ulcer disappeared.<br>
 6. A liver and intestinal cancer patient (Mr. Chen, 55 years old, from Beijing) was told on Nov. 2008 that no medicine could treat his disease. From Jan. 2009 on, he was administered with eight bottles of the allicin tablet of the invention and twelve bottles of common allicin tablet. The disease weakened with passing day and the liver ache almost disappeared.<br>
 7. A patient (Ms. Yao, 50 years old, from Hangzhou) whose liver ached sometimes for several days was administered with the allicin tablet of the invention. Two days later, the ache disappeared.<br>
 8. Two patients (Ms. Qin, 46 years old, from Sichuan; Ms. Liu, 38 years old, from Jiangsu) had yellow and smelly leucorrhea. Many anti-inflammatory<br><br>
and anti-bacterial drugs were tried but had no effect. The natural allicin tablet was administered to the patient. Several days later, the inflammation disappeared.<br>
 9. Two patients (Ms. Feng, 37 years old, from Guangxi; Ms. Tang, 16 years old, from Hangzhou) suffering from stomach disease was administered with the allicin tablet of the invention. Several days later, the disease was allievated.<br>
 10. Five diarrhea patients were (two Mr. Yao, 55 and 79 years old respectively, from Hangzhou; two Ms. Yao, both 52 years old, from Hangzhou; Mr. Cheng, 79 years old, from Beijing) administered with the allicin tablet of the invention. Several times later, the diarrhea disappeared.<br>
11. Seven patients (two Mr. Yao, 55 and 53 years old respectively, from Hangzhou; Ms. Cui, 53 years old, from Hangzhou; Ms. Wang, 53 years old, from Hangzhou; Ms. Yao, 53 years old, from Hangzhou, etc.) suffering from toothache which resulted in headache were administered with the allicin tablet of the invention. Several times later, the aches disappeared.<br>
12. Two patients (Ms. Xu, 78 years old, from Hangzhou; Mr. Yao, 53 years old, from Hangzhou) suffering from urinary tract infection were administered with the allicin tablet of the invention. Three times later, the disease disappeared.<br>
13. Two patients (Ms.Yao, 53 years old, from Hangzhou; Ms. Liu, 38 years old, from Jiangsu) having nasal obstruction were administered with the allicin tablet of the invention. Three times later, the disease disappeared.<br>
14. A patient (Mr. Ying, 56 years old, from Zhejiang) suffering from prostatitis was administered with the allicin tablet of the invention. One week later, the disease weakened.<br>
15. A patient (a child, 7 years old) suffering from an inflamed and aching tonsil with fever was administered with the allicin tablet of the invention. Half an<br><br>
hour later, the disease weakened. Four hours later, the allicin tablet was administered again. Soon, the fever and inflammation disappeared.<br>
16. Two patients (Ms. Zhang, 86 years old, from Hangzhou; Mr. Ren, 53 years old, from Hangzhou) suffered from high fever in the winter in 2008. Due to heavy snow, road was blocked and thus they could not go to hospital. Thus, they were administered with the allicin tablet of the invention thrice within 15 hrs. Gradually, the fever disappeared.<br>
 These clinical cases show that the allicin tablet has capability of anti-bacteria and anti-inflammation. However, in use, the dosage should be large. In contrast to the allicin tablets in the prior art, the tablet has the characteristic of the highest allicin content per piece, the largest dosage administered safely and no side effects.<br>
 The invention is described herein below with reference to accompanying drawings, in which the sole figure shows an active ingredient of an allicin powder according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
