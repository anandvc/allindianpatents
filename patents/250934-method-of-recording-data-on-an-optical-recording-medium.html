				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of data recording on an optical recording medium, and more particularly, to a method for recording channel-modulated digital data on an optical disc by forming a mark or a space thereon.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Data is recorded on an optical disc, which is one of optical recording media, by forming a mark or a space on a target tract of the optical disc. In the case of readonly discs such as CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs, mark or a space is formed as a pit. In the case of a writable disc such as CD-R/RW or DVD-R/RW/RAM, a recording layer is coated with a phase change material whose properties change into crystalline or amorphous crystalline according to temperature. By using such characteristics of the phase change material, a mark or space is formed on a writable disc.<br>
Data recording methods using signal detection are divided into a mark edge recording method and a mark position recording method. The mark position recording method uses that the amplitude of a detected radio-frequency (RF) signal changes from a positive/negative value to a negative/positive value, starting from the position of a mark. In contrast, the mark edge recording method uses that the amplitude of a detected RF signal changes from a positive/negative value to a negative/positive value, starting form both edges of a mark. Thus, the edge of a mark must be precisely recorded on a target tract of an optical medium so as to improve the quality of a reproduction signal.<br>
However, in an optical disc covered with a phase change film, the shape of the trailing edge of a mark, which is recorded by such a conventional recording<br>
method, depends on the length of a mark or an interval between adjacent marks, i.e., the length of a space. For instance, the size of the trailing edge of a mark may be larger than that of its leading edge, thereby deteriorating the recording/reproducing characteristics of the optical disc. The recording/reproducing characteristics become much worse because heat is accumulated in the edge of a mark when a recording mark is comparatively long.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a conventional recording waveform for recording non-return-to-zero-inverted (NRZI) data on a DVD +RW. Here, T denotes a period of a reference clock. In the mark edge recording method, high and low levels of the NRZI data are recorded as a mark and a space, respectively. A recording waveform for recording a mark and a recording waveform for recording a space (for erasing the mark) are called a record pattern and an erase pattern, respectively. A conventional recording waveform includes a record pattern, the record pattern being a multi pulse consisting of a plurality of unit pulses that are maintained at the same power levels for the same time, and includes an erase pattern that is maintained at a predetermined DC level for a predetermined duration.<br>
In detail, the erase pattern included in the conventional recording waveform is maintained at a predetermined DC level for a predetermined time, resulting in continuous heating of an area of an optical disc where the erase pattern is recorded, at a temperature between 0°C and 200°C. If the erase pattern is repeatedly recorded predetermined numbers of time, the quality of the optical disc deteriorates and a mark recorded on the optical disc distorts, thereby remarkably lowering the recording/reproducing characteristics. In particular, the recording/reproducing characteristics deteriorate to a great extent, when a period T of a reference clock becomes shorter and thermal interference between pulses of a recording waveform increases as the recording density and linear velocity of an optical disc are increased so as to record much more data. Further, in the case of the conventional record pattern with a multi-pulse, the amount of power supplied to record a mark may decrease to distort the mark when data is recoded on an optical disc at a high speed so as to increase the transmission speed of data, i.e., when the period T of the reference clock decreases.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating the structure of a recording apparatus according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.   The recording apparatus records data on an optical recording medium 200 by forming a mark or a space thereon.   Referring to FIG. 2, the recording apparatus includes a pickup 1, a recording waveform generator 2, and a channel modulator 3.<br>
The channel modulator 3 modulates data input from the outside into a channel bit stream, and the recording waveform generator 2 receives the channel bit stream and generates a recording waveform to record the channel bit stream.   The generated recording waveform includes a DC record pattern with a DC pulse and an erase pattern with a multi pulse.   The recording waveform will later be described in detail.   The pickup 1 forms a mark or a space on the optical recording medium 200 by illuminating light thereon in accordance with the generated recording waveform.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating the structure of the recording apparatus of FIG. 2 according to another embodiment of the present invention.    Elements that are the same as those of FIG. 2 are indicated with the same reference numerals and their descriptions will be omitted here.<br>

circuit 12 that performs servo control on the motor 11 and the optical head 13, and a laser driving circuit 14 that drives laser (not shown) installed in the optical head 13.<br>
The channel modulator 3 creates non-return-to-zero-inverted (NRZI) data by modulating input data into a channel bit stream.   The recording waveform generator 2 generates a recording waveform to record the NRZI data and provides the recording waveform to the laser driving circuit 14 included in the pickup 1.<br>

The power level of the modified DC pulse Tdc is maintained at a DC level for more than 1T and then is lowered to the power level of the cooling pulse Tcl for less than 1T. Such a change in the power level of the modified DC pulse Tdc is repeated predetermined numbers of time.   When recording a mark of 3T, a first pulse Tfp, a DC pulse Tdc, and a cooling pulse Tcl, are sequentially generated.   Here, Tfp, Tdc, and Tcl denote the pulse duration of the first pulse, the modified DC pulse, and the cooling pulse, respectively.<br>
Each erase pattern consists of a modified multi pulse.    In FIG. 12, Temp denotes the width of an erase multi pulse that constitutes the erase pattern.    In this embodiment, Temp is set to 0.5T.<br>
The first and last erase pulses F and L of the multi pulse of the recording waveform 25 are at high power levels, and the first and last erase pulses Fand L of the multi pulses of the recording waveforms 22 through 24 are at low power levels. Each last erase pulse L is also the first pulse Ttp of the record pattern for recording a mark of 3T that follows the multi pulse.<br>
FIG. 13 illustrates recording waveforms 28 through 30 generated by the recording waveform generator 2, according to still another embodiment of the present invention.    The recording waveforms 28 through 30 show different DC record patterns according to the present invention.<br>
In a record pattern for recording a mark of 7T, a first pulse Ttp, a modified DC pulse Tdc, and a cooling pulse Tci are sequentially generated.   The power level of the modified DC pulse Tdcis maintained at a DC level for more than 1T and reduced to the power level of the cooling pulse 7c/for less than 1T.    Such a change in the power level of the modified DC pulse Tdc is repeated predetermined numbers of time. In a record pattern for recording the next mark of 3T, a first pulse Tfp, a DC pulse Tdc, and a cooling pulse 7c/are sequentially generated.    Here, TfP, Tdc, and Tc\ denote the pulse duration of the first, DC, and cooling pulses, respectively.<br>

The power levels of the first and last erase pulses Fand L, which constitute the modified multi pulse of the recording waveform 28, are at high power levels.    In contrast, the power levels of the first and last erase pulses Fand L, constitute the modified multi pulses of the recording waveforms 29 and 30, are at low power levels and high power levels, respectively.    Each last erase pulse L is also the first pulse Tfp of the record pattern for recording the mark of 3T that follows the modified multi pulse.<br>
FIGs. 14 through 16 illustrate recording waveforms showing four types of erase patterns according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.   The characteristic portions of the respective erase patterns are marked with circles in order to tell them from one another.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 14 through 16, erase patterns consist of modified multi pulses, classified into four types: (a) LH type; (b) LL type; (c) HH type; and (d) HL type.    In detail, (a) shows an erase pattern of an LH type, the first erase pulse F of which is at a low power level and the last erase pulse L of which is at a high power level,    (b) shows an erase pattern of an LL type, the first and last erase pulses F and L of which are at low power levels,    (c) shows an erase pattern of an HH type, the first and last erase pulses Fand L of which are at high power levels,    (d) shows an erase pattern of an HL type, the first erase pulse F of which is at a high power level and the last erase pulse L of which is at a low power level.<br>
In this disclosure, the duration of the high and low power levels of a multi pulse of an erase pattern according to the present invention is set to 0.5T, that is, a ratio of the duration of the high power level to that of the low power level is 1:1.<br>
However, there is no limit to the ratio, for example, the ratio may be m:n (m and n are integers)<br>
As described above, a recording waveform according to the present invention includes an erase pattern consisting of a multi pulse, thereby reducing the distortion of an end of a mark and increasing the reproducing characteristics.   The recording waveform further includes a DC record pattern with a DC pulse, which prevents a reduction in power supplied when recording data a high speed and improves the shape of a mark by more easily controlling recording operations.<br>
Meanwhile, information (or type information) regarding four types of erase patterns may be recorded in a lead-in area of a writable disc or contained as header information in a wobble signal.   Therefore, when recording data on a writable disc, a recording apparatus reads type information from a lead-in area or a wobble signal and forms a mark or a space on the disc by generating a recording waveform based on the type information.<br>
The four types of the erase patterns may be used as codes indicating a reading speed factor of a disc drive or the type of a mark.    For instance, an LH-type erase pattern may indicate that information recorded on a disc using the erase pattern is preferably reproduced at a 20X speed factor.<br>
Hereinafter, a method of recording channel-modulated digital data on an optical disc by forming marks and spaces thereon according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described based on the above configuration.<br>
FIG. 17 is a flowchart illustrating a recording method according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.   Referring to FIG. 17, a recording apparatus receives and modulates external data to produce NRZI data in action 1701.    In action 1702, the recording apparatus creates a recording waveform that includes a DC record pattern, and an erase pattern with a multi pulse.    In action 1703, the recording apparatus forms a mark or a space on an optical disc using the recording waveform.<br>
In this disclosure, the aforementioned recording waveforms are described with respect to marks of 7T and 3T.    However, those skilled in the art could have easily derived a record pattern and an erase pattern for marks or spaces of 2T, 4T, 5T, or 6T, from the teachings of the present invention.<br>
