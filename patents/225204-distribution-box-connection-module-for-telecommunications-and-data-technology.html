				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a distribution box connection module for<br>
telecommunications and data technology.<br>
Conventional distribution box connection modules for<br>
communications and data technology have two rows of connection<br>
contacts which are arranged on one end face of a housing . A<br>
distribution box connection module such as this is known, for<br>
example, from DE 27 25 SS1. the distribution box connection<br>
module has a first row of connection contacts on the cable face<br>
and, opposite this, a second row of connection contacts on the<br>
jumper face, in which case the contacts on the cable face may be<br>
regarded as input contacts while the contacts on the jumper face<br>
may be regarded as output contacts, although the information flow<br>
may be reversed. Center contacts are arranged between the rows,<br>
and test plugs or protection plugs can be inserted into them. One<br>
example of such protection plugs is three-point or five-point<br>
overvoltage protection modules or staggered protection circuits.<br>
If such overvoltage protection is now inserted into the center<br>
contacts, then this center tap, and in some cases also adjacent<br>
center taps, is or are no longer acceSS1ble for test purposes,<br>
and the overvoltage protection must be removed again for test<br>
purposes, so that the contact is not protected in this time.<br>
A distribution box connection for telecommunication and data<br>
technology is known from DE 100 29 649 Al, comprising a housing<br>
in which externally acceSS1ble input and output contacts are<br>
arranged for the connection of cables or cores, with the housing<br>
having a cavity in which functional elements are arranged between<br>
the input and output contacts. The input and output contacts may<br>
in this case be arranged in the same end face of the housing or<br>
else on apposite end faces, with the input contacts being<br>
associated with one end face, and the output contacts being<br>
associated with the other end face. this results in clear<br>
separation between the cable face and the jumper face, with the<br>
individual cores and cables not interfering with one another.<br>
STMI interfaces, among others, are used in the transmiSS1on<br>
network between the nodes in the telecommunications network and<br>
are connected to a large number of transmitters and receivers<br>
which, for example, are formed by electronic units, and with the<br>
transmiSS1on capacity at the moment, for example, being 2 Mbit/s<br>
per channel.<br>
The invention is thus based on the technical problem of providing a user-friendly distribution<br>
box connection module for telecommunications and data technology, in particular for use in<br>
transmission networks between the nodes.<br>
The technical problem is solved by the subject matter in the features of patent claim 1.<br>
Further advantageous refinements of the invention are described in the dependent claims.<br>
For this purpose, the input contacts are in the form of at least two mutually opposite rows of<br>
contacts, and the output contacts are in the form of at least one plug connector, with at least<br>
two input contacts in the first row and least two input contacts in the second row being<br>
connected to the output contacts in the at least one plug connector, and with the input<br>
contacts in the first row and in the second row being connected via the at east one printed<br>
circuit board to the output contacts in the plug connector. In consequence, four cores can be<br>
associated one channel, with two cores being used for reception and two cores for<br>
transmission of data. On the output side, in this case, the jumpering via the plug connector is<br>
very simple, so that it is possible to use prefabricated cables.<br>
On the input side, the distribution box connection module is user-friendly since all the cores<br>
for receiving data for the subscriber can be associated with one row of input contacts, and all<br>
the cores for transmitting data for a subscriber can be associated with the other row of input<br>
contacts. The input side thus provides clear separation between the transmission mode and<br>
the reception mode, in a similar way to that in conventional strip connectors, with the system<br>
face and jumper face being separated via the two rows of connection contacts. The electrical<br>
connection of the associated input contacts in the first row and in the second row to their<br>
shared plug connector is in this case made via the at least one printed circuit board.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the input contacts in the first row and in the<br>
second row are in the form of insulation displacement terminal contacts.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the plug connectors are in the form of RJ-45 female<br>
connectors. In embodiments where one channel has only four associated cores, only four<br>
contacts of the RJ-45 female connector are connected in a corresponding manner to the<br>
input contacts, with the contacts 3-6 being connected, by way of example, while, the contacts<br>
1, 2, 7, 8 remain unconnected (numbering of the contacts in accordance with RJ-45).<br>
The plug connectors are preferably likewise arranged in two mutually opposite rows. In this<br>
case, the electrical connections between the input and output contacts are in some cases<br>
crossed over, since two cores must be routed from each plug connector to the first row, and<br>
two cores must be routed from each plug connector to the second row of the input contacts.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, two mutually opposite printed circuit boards are thus<br>
arranged within the housing and are electrically connected to one another, with the crossover<br>
being provided via the electrical connection. The two printed circuit boards are preferably<br>
electrically connected via a flat ribbon cable. However, in principle, other electrical<br>
connections such as plug contacts are also feasible.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, functional and/or protection elements are arranged on the<br>
printed circuit board and are electrically connected between the input and output contacts,<br>
such as filter or amplifier circuits, or overvoltage protection elements.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the housing is formed in two or more parts, with at least<br>
one part of the housing being composed of metal. In addition to a pleasant design, the<br>
metallic housing allows direct formation with at least one grounding clip, which is formed from<br>
the housing and can be connected via contact pads to the printed circuit board. Furthermore,<br>
the metal housing is preferably formed with connecting elements for profiled rods and/or<br>
rails.<br>
In addition, the input contacts preferably have associated isolating contacts, with each<br>
contact pair preferably having its own associated isolating contact for measurement and test<br>
purposes. Switching or connection contacts may also be used instead of isolating contacts.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail in the following text with reference to a<br>
accompanying<br>
preferred exemplary embodiment. In the accompanying figures:<br>
Figure 1 shows a block diagram of a connection area around a distribution box<br>
connection module,<br>
Figure 2 shows a perspective front view of a distribution box connection module,<br>
Figure 3 shows a perspective rear view of the distribution box connection module,<br>
Figure 4 shows a plan view of the distribution box connection module,<br>
Figure 5 shows a perspective illustration of the printed circuit board with a front<br>
part, and<br>
Figure 6 shows a perspective illustration of two printed circuit boards with a front<br>
part.<br>
Figure 1 shows the distribution box connection module 1 in one possible environment within<br>
a telecommunications network. The distribution box connection module 1 has an input side E<br>
and an output side A, with the expreSS1ons input side and output side being used only for<br>
definition purposes here, since the information flow takes place in both directions. Two or<br>
more transmitter modules SrSn and two or more receiving modules ErEn are arranged on<br>
the input side E. The transmission and receiving modules are in each case designed, for<br>
example, for a transmission capacity of 2 MB/s and are in the form of electronics units. The<br>
individual transmission modules S1-Sn may in this case also be combined in a higher-level<br>
transmitter unit SE. The receiving modules Ei-En may likewise be combined to form a<br>
receiving unit EE. The connection between the transmission and receiving units SE, EE is<br>
made via conventional telecommunications cables FK, with one core pair, for example, in<br>
each case being associated with one module. An STM1 module based on SDH technology is<br>
arranged on the output side A, with the connection between the output side A and STM1<br>
module being made via prefabricated patch cables PK. Core pairs which are associated with<br>
a common channel from transmission and receiving modules are then combined in the<br>
distribution box connection module 1 and are passed as a "channel cable" to the STM1<br>
module. On the input side E, the cores are in this case separated on the basis of the<br>
transmission and receiving mode, as will be explained in more detail later, while, in contrast,<br>
channel separation is provided on the output side. In this case, it should be noted that the<br>
transmission and receiving units SE, EE can also be formed jointly as an STM1 module, that<br>
is to say with the distribution box connection module 1 being arranged between two STM1<br>
modules.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 show perspective views of the distribution box connection module 1. The<br>
distribution box connection module 1 has a first row of input contacts 10 and a second row of<br>
input contacts 20, which are arranged opposite one another.<br>
In the illustrated example, each row has sixteen insulation displacement terminal contacts<br>
11, 21 for connection of eight double cores. A first row of output contacts 30 and a second<br>
row of output contacts 40 are arranged on the opposite end face, with four output contacts in<br>
one row in each case being combined as a plug connector, in the form of an RJ-45 female<br>
connector 31, 41. The distribution box connection module 1 thus in each case has thirty-two<br>
input contacts 10, 20 and output contacts 30, 40. The distribution box connection module 1<br>
also has two front parts 12, 22, which form a part of the housing and surround the input<br>
contacts 10, 20. The front parts 12, 22 are in this case preferably composed of plastic.<br>
The output contacts 30, 40 are surrounded by two metallic side walls 32 and a metallic<br>
baseplate 33, which, together with the two front parts 12, 22, form the housing. The two side<br>
walls 32 can be screwed to the baseplate 33. The two side walls 32 each have two<br>
connecting elements 34, via which the distribution box connection module 1 can be latched<br>
onto a profiled rod system, which is not illustrated. The two front parts 12, 22 are connected<br>
to the baseplate 33 via latching tongues 35. Furthermore, the baseplate 33 has four<br>
grounding clips 36, via which an electrical connection can be produced to contact pads or<br>
printed circuit boards which cannot be seen. The input contacts 10, 20 are connected to the<br>
output contacts 30, 40 via these printed circuit boards. In this case, two input contacts 10<br>
(which are associated with one double core) in the first row and input contacts 20 in the<br>
second row are in each case electrically connected to the output contacts 30, 40 of an RJ-45<br>
female connector 31, 41 via the printed circuit boards. In this case, the input contacts 10 are<br>
only used for connecting cores via which data is transmitted to the STM1 module, and the<br>
input contacts 20 are only used for connecting cores via which data transmitted by the<br>
subscriber is transmitted. The four connected contacts in an RJ-45 female connector 31, 41<br>
are thus connected to two input contacts 10 in the first row and to two input contacts 20 in<br>
the second row. If, for example, it is now intended to connect an RJ-45 female connector 41<br>
to the associated input contacts 10, 20, then the connection for the input contacts 20 can be<br>
made virtually straight, while, in contrast, the connection from the input contacts 10 in the<br>
housing must be crossed over from top to bottom. The conditions for making contact with an<br>
RI-45 female connector 31 correspond to this, but are reversed. This croSS1ng-over is<br>
preferably carried out via two mutually opposite printed circuit boards within the housing, as<br>
will be explained in more detail later. This means that the two transmission directions are<br>
arranged such that they are clearly separated from one another on the input side, which<br>
[lacuna] the connection, measurement and testing. On the output side, on the other hand,<br>
prefabricated cables can be used very easily and in a simple manner for jumpering since the<br>
output contacts which are associated with one channel are integrated in one plug connector.<br>
Since, normally, jumpering has to be carried out more frequently on the output side than on<br>
the input side, the connecting elements 34 may also be reversed so that the RJ-45 female<br>
connectors 31, 41 are freely accessible after latching onto the profiled rod. More or less than<br>
eight channels may, of course, be connected in one distribution box connection module 1.<br>
Figure 4 shows a plan view of the distribution box connection module 1. In this case, each<br>
associated pair of input contacts 10, 20 has an associated externally accessible isolating<br>
contact 13, and in this context reference may be made, for example, to DE 100 29 649 A1<br>
with regard to the configuration of the isolating contact 13. At this point, it should be noted<br>
that the input contacts may also be formed with further contacts for connection of a shield. In<br>
this case, three insulation displacement terminal contacts 11, 21 would in each case be<br>
associated with one double core. Four RJ-45 female connectors 31 are arranged on the face<br>
of the printed circuit board 50 which faces the output side. The front part 12 is latched by<br>
means of the insulation displacement terminal contacts 11 onto the face of the printed circuit<br>
board 50 which faces the input side, with the insulation displacement terminal contacts,<br>
which are formed with fork contacts, being pushed onto contact pads on the printed circuit<br>
board 50. The input contacts of these contact pads are then connected via core tracks, which<br>
are not shown, to contact points 16 and/or directly to RJ-45 female connectors 31.<br>
Figure 6 shows two printed circuit boards 50 as shown in Figure 5, which are connected to<br>
one another via a flat ribbon cable 17 at the contact points 16. Eight input contacts 10 are<br>
looped through to the lower printed circuit board 50 and eight input contacts 20 are looped<br>
through to the other printed circuit board 50, via, respectively, the contact points 16 and the<br>
flat ribbon cable 17.<br>
The distribution box connection module 1 may be extended in a modular fashion, so that a<br>
large number of rows may be arranged horizontally instead of the two rows of input and<br>
output contacts described. Furthermore, one plug connector may also have more than four<br>
associated cores.<br>
