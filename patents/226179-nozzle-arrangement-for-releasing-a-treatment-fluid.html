				<td>NOZZLE ARRANGEMENT FOR RELEASING A TREATMENT FLUID<br>
The present invention concerns a nozzle arrangement, as may be applied in the<br>
treatment of a work piece with a treatment fluid or in the flooding of a corresponding<br>
treatment bath with a treatment fluid. In particular the present invention concerns a<br>
flow nozzle arrangement which can, for example, be applied in continuous systems<br>
for wet-chemical treatment of printed-circuit boards.<br>
Nozzle arrangements of the type mentioned are widely known. Thus, for example,<br>
such nozzle arrangements are used in continuous systems for wet-chemical<br>
treatment of printed-circuit boards in order to achieve the fastest and most even<br>
possible treatment of the printed-circuit boards passing through. For this purpose in a<br>
known fashion various such nozzle arrangements are arranged above and/or below<br>
the level at which the printed-circuit boards pass through as well as diagonally to this<br>
direction of flow of the printed-circuit boards, from which the corresponding treatment<br>
fluid is sprayed onto the surface of the printed-circuit board or is sucked from it, in<br>
order to achieve a constant and even exchange of the treatment fluid along the<br>
surface of the printed-circuit boards.<br>
In EP 1 187 515 A2 a number of different nozzle arrangements are proposed in this<br>
connection. Here essentially round tubes are used that have various nozzle forms.<br>
Thus these nozzle arrangements may, for example, have slot nozzles arranged<br>
diagonally, round nozzles arranged alongside each other in rows or also a number of<br>
slot nozzles arranged alongside each other and running in an axial direction.<br><br>
DE 37 08 529 A1 also proposes the use of slot nozzles, whereby by means of a<br>
variable slot width of the corresponding nozzle the flow quantity and the spray<br>
pressure of the respective medium can be adjusted.<br>
In DE 35 28 575 A1 for cleaning, activation and/or metallization of bore holes in<br>
printed-circuit boards passing through horizontally a nozzle below the level at<br>
which these pass through and vertically to the direction of flow is used, from which<br>
a fluid treatment means in the form of a constant wave is delivered onto the<br>
underside of each printed-circuit board that passes through. The nozzle is<br>
arranged in the top part of a nozzle housing, which comprises a pre-chamber with<br>
inlet nozzle, whereby the pre-chamber is, in turn, separated from an upper part of<br>
the inner area of the nozzle by means of a shadow mask. With the help of the<br>
shadow mask a distribution of the flow of the fluid treatment means to the nozzle is<br>
achieved. The inner area of the nozzle before the actual (slot) nozzle serves as the<br>
pre-chamber for an even build-up of the flow of the fluid treatment means.<br>
EP 0 280 078 B1 reveals a nozzle arrangement for cleaning or chemical treatment<br>
of work pieces, in particular printed-circuit boards, by means of a corresponding<br>
treatment fluid. The nozzle arrangement comprises a lower admission box and a<br>
housing box, whereby via the lower admission box the treatment fluid is passed<br>
via bore holes in the floor of the housing box into the inside of the housing box. The<br>
housing box, in turn, has a central separating wall in combination with two<br>
perforation levels and slots arranged on this, which allows the treatment fluid to<br>
flow to both slots and via these to form two even, sinusoidal surge wave profiles,<br>
which the work pieces, in particular the bore holes of printed-circuit boards, pass<br>
through, and by means of the Venturi effect ensure an intensive mass transfer.<br>
In the known flow nozzle arrangements the speed of flow at the inlest is at a<br>
maximum, since it is here that the greatest flow volume passes through. With<br>
increasing distance from the inlet the flow speed drops accordingly, since via each<br><br>
of the individual nozzle openings only part of the treatment fluid discharges. Apart<br>
from the existing static pressure, this leads to banking-up pressure and uneven flow<br>
speeds at the nozzle openings. A further consequence is unevenness in the<br>
quantities of the treatment fluid discharged.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a nozzle arrangement for<br>
releasing a treatment fluid, in which an extensively even flow speed and flow quantity<br>
of the treatment fluid in the longitudinal direction of the nozzle arrangement can be<br>
achieved. Further requirements that are preferably to be met are a high level of<br>
compactness of the nozzle section, in order to use the smallest possible amount of<br>
space in systems of the abovementioned type. Apart from this, the number of<br>
components and the production costs should be kept low. In addition the spray or flow<br>
geometry and the spray direction should preferably be the same at all discharge<br>
openings.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a nozzle arrangement for releasing a<br>
treatment fluid, with a longitudinal housing with at least one fluid feed opening for<br>
feeding the treatment fluid and at least one fluid delivery opening formed in the<br>
housing for releasing the treatment fluid, whereby in the housing a fluid channel is<br>
formed for feeding the treatment fluid from the fluid feed opening to the at least one<br>
fluid delivery opening, and whereby the section of the fluid channel reduces from the<br>
fluid feed opening in the longitudinal direction of the housing, characterized in that the<br>
housing is made from plastic, and at or in the nozzle arrangement at least one<br>
stiffening member made from metal and extending in the longitudinal direction of the<br>
nozzle arrangement is provided, and in the nozzle arrangement a longitudinal insert,<br>
in which a plurality of distribution openings spaced from one another in the<br>
longitudinal direction is formed, is arranged so that the fluid channel defined by the<br>
insert is in communication with the at least one fluid delivery opening via the<br>
distribution openings, in order to feed the treatment fluid from the fluid channel via the<br>
distribution openings to the at least one fluid delivery opening.<br><br>
Preferably, the section of the fluid channel reduces continuously from the fluid feed<br>
opening in the longitudinal direction of the housing. Preferably, the distribution<br>
openings of the insert are positioned congruent to the fluid delivery openings in the<br>
housing. Preferably, the section of the fluid channel reduces from the fluid feed<br>
opening in the longitudinal direction of the housing from a number of sides.<br>
Preferably, all the distribution openings have the same diameter. Preferably, the<br>
length of the distribution openings increases from the fluid feed opening in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the housing. Preferably, the length of the distribution openings<br>
of the fluid feed opening in the longitudinal direction of the housing is the same.<br>
Preferably, the distribution openings have a differing diameter. Preferably, the<br>
diameter of the distribution openings reduces from the fluid feed opening in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the housing. Preferably, the distribution openings are provided<br>
with countersinkings on their side turned towards the fluid channel. Preferably, the<br>
countersinkings of the distribution openings have a different depth. Preferably, the<br>
depth of the countersinkings of the distribution openings increases from the fluid feed<br>
opening in the longitudinal direction of the housing. Preferably, the housing is<br>
essentially parallelepiped in shape and the stiffening member is essentially U-shaped.<br>
Preferably, between the at least one fluid delivery opening and the fluid channel and<br>
immediately before the at least one fluid delivery opening a storage chamber is<br>
formed for pressure distribution. Preferably, the storage chamber is in the form of a<br>
recess provided in the longitudinal insert on the side of the distribution openings<br>
turned towards the at least one fluid delivery opening. Preferably, all distribution<br>
openings are arranged spatially at an offset to the at least one fluid delivery opening<br>
in such a way that the treatment fluid flows out of the fluid delivery openings via the<br>
storage chamber only after at least two changes in direction. Preferably, the at least<br>
one fluid feed opening is provided at a longitudinal end of the housing. Preferably, the<br>
at least one fluid feed opening is provided at a middle section of the housing.<br>
Preferably, the housing has a plurality of fluid delivery openings spaced from one<br>
another in the longitudinal direction of the housing. Preferably, the fluid delivery<br>
openings are slotted or round. Preferably, the fluid delivery openings have the same<br><br>
dimensions. Preferably, the fluid delivery openings have a reducing width from the<br>
fluid feed opening over the length of the housing or a reducing diameter over the<br>
length of the housing. Preferably, the slotted fluid delivery openings are formed in a<br>
plurality of rows offset from one another in the housing. Preferably, in the housing a<br>
plurality of connecting channels spaced from one another and extending widthways in<br>
the housing are formed in the longitudinal direction of the housing, which<br>
communicate at one end with the fluid channel in the housing and at the other with<br>
the at least one fluid delivery opening. Preferably, the connecting channels are<br>
formed in a cover which is positioned on the housing. Preferably, the cover is<br>
positioned with a fluid-tight seal at the housing. Preferably, the connecting channels<br>
are arranged evenly spaced in the longitudinal direction of the housing. Preferably,<br>
the connecting channels are distributed essentially over the entire length of the<br>
housing. Preferably, each connecting channel extends essentially in a straight line<br>
transversely to the longitudinal direction of the housing. Preferably, each connecting<br>
channel opens out into one of the fluid delivery openings at either side of the housing.<br>
Preferably, a further longitudinal insert, which is conical in its longitudinal direction, is<br>
arranged in the housing and defines together with the longitudinal insert having the<br>
distribution openings the fluid channel.<br>
The nozzle arrangement according to the invention has an elongated housing with at<br>
least one fluid feed opening for the feeding of a treatment fluid and with at least one<br>
fluid delivery opening formed in the housing for releasing the treatment fluid onto the<br>
work piece to be treated. In the housing a fluid channel is formed for feeding the<br>
treatment fluid from the fluid feed opening to the at least one fluid delivery opening.<br>
The minimum of one delivery opening can be slotted or be designed as a row of<br>
round bore holes arranged behind one another with an even spacing.<br><br>
According to a first embodiment of the present invention the section of the fluid<br>
channel reduces from the fluid feed opening in the longitudinal direction of the<br>
housing, whereby a continuous reduction in the section of the fluid channel in the<br>
longitudinal direction and along the minimum of one fluid delivery opening can be<br>
provided. By means of this adaptation of the flow section of the fluid channel to the<br>
distance from the fluid feed opening or from the fluid inlet, where the greatest fluid<br>
quantity passes through, balancing of the flow speed along the entire length of the<br>
nozzle arrangement and thus along the at least one fluid delivery opening can be<br>
achieved.<br>
In a housing with the same section in the longitudinal direction a longitudinal insert<br>
can be provided, the section of which reduces in the longitudinal direction from the<br>
fluid feed opening, so that it reduces according to the section of the fluid channel.<br>
The insert is preferably arranged in relation to the fluid delivery openings in such a<br>
way that all fluid delivery openings have delivery channels of the same length.<br>
It is also equally possible, however, for the thickness of the housing wall to<br>
increase at one or more points in the longitudinal direction of the housing from the<br>
fluid feed opening.<br>
The insert in the inside of the nozzle arrangement can, for example, also comprise<br>
a large number of individual sections or segments. These may be displacers or<br>
perforated bodies. In this way, for example, 60 parts per nozzle arrangement,<br>
depending on the required length, with differing section, or for discs with a differing<br>
inside diameter, are arranged in a row. The individual sections can be glued,<br>
welded, or held together with tie rods or with a stiffener. The flow cross section for<br>
the fluid decreases constantly here from section to section from the first segment at<br>
the fluid entry to the end of the nozzle arrangement. If, for example, one of the<br>
sections has a delivery opening, the storage chamber in the section can be<br><br>
cylindrical and not conical. This results in a stepped fluid channel with very low<br>
production costs.<br>
According to a second embodiment of the present invention the fluid channel<br>
communicates via several distribution openings separated from one another in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the housing, and which differ in length. If the length of<br>
these distribution openings is increasingly altered starting from the fluid feed<br>
opening in the longitudinal direction of the housing, then likewise balancing of the<br>
speed of flow of the treatment fluid over the entire length of the nozzle<br>
arrangement at the nozzle or fluid delivery openings can be achieved. The differing<br>
lengths of the bore holes or distribution openings result in differing flow resistances<br>
which lead to a balancing of the flow speed.<br>
The abovementioned distribution openings can all have the same diameter.<br>
Similarly, however, it is also conceivable for the distribution openings to be<br>
designed with differing diameters. The decisive factor for the change in diameter is<br>
a differing flow speed in the feed channel and the associated differing overall<br>
pressure conditions.<br>
According to a further variant, therefore, it is proposed that the distribution<br>
openings have differing diameters at the fluid delivery and that these are provided<br>
with countersinkings with the same diameters. If the diameter of the<br>
countersinkings is selected to be identical, then a further evening out of the volume<br>
flow and the delivery speed takes place.<br>
The above distribution openings can be fashioned in an insert of the<br>
abovementioned type in the form of corresponding bore holes. The insert can be<br>
retained with the help of a preferably U-shaped stiffener in the housing.<br><br>
It has been observed that through the dynamic forces of the flowing fluid the jet is<br>
not delivered at the fluid delivery openings in the angle of the opening channel, but<br>
diagonally in the direction of flow of the treatment fluid. With increasing length of<br>
the delivery channel this effect reduces. This likewise leads to an uneven treatment<br>
result on the sensitive treatment product.<br>
It is therefore particularly advantageous if between the at least one fluid delivery<br>
opening and the fluid channel a storage chamber is provided, for example in the<br>
form of a corresponding milling or recess of the aforementioned insert, which<br>
serves to further distribute the pressure and to reduce the dynamic forces. The<br>
distribution openings are arranged in a preferred embodiment in such a way that<br>
the jet of fluid delivered bounces against the wall in which the fluid delivery<br>
openings are arranged. Then the jet is deflected diagonally and bounces against<br>
the wall of the milled-out insert, before flowing against the treatment product or<br>
work piece once it has been deflected again by the fluid delivery opening.<br>
The fluid delivery opening or the inlet for the treatment fluid can be arranged on a<br>
longitudinal side of the housing. It is, of course, conceivable for this fluid delivery<br>
opening to be arranged in a central section of the housing however.<br>
The fluid delivery openings are preferably in the form of several slots arranged at<br>
intervals in the longitudinal direction of the housing which can all have identical<br>
dimensions or also different dimensions. It is particularly advantageous if the fluid<br>
delivery openings are designed in the form of several rows of slots offset against<br>
each other, which each run in the longitudinal direction of the housing. In place of<br>
the offset rows of slots, however, rows of bore holes can also be used. In both<br>
cases an even flow against the treatment product takes place.<br>
It is also important that the distance from the fluid delivery openings and the<br>
treatment product is always the same. This should avoid the nozzle arrangement<br><br>
bending under the build-up or jet pressure of the treatment fluid. High temperatures<br>
or deformations caused by the production process (e.g. those brought about by<br>
welding) should also be avoided. The required stability can in particular be<br>
achieved by having longitudinally arranged metal stiffeners on or in the nozzle<br>
arrangement.<br>
According to a further embodiment, the nozzle arrangement according to the<br>
invention can also have a preferably bilaterally continuously reducing section of the<br>
fluid channel, whereby on one side of the housing a fluid-tight lid or covering is<br>
arranged on the housing which together with the housing defines the fluid delivery<br>
openings. According to this embodiment the fluid delivery openings, in particular,<br>
comprise a plurality of slots arranged in the longitudinal direction of the nozzle<br>
arrangement at intervals and which run diagonally to the longitudinal direction, i.e.<br>
in the width direction of the nozzle arrangement, whereby the fluid delivery<br>
openings are arranged bilaterally on the nozzle arrangement. Each slot or<br>
connecting channel thus communicates at one end with the fluid channel of the<br>
housing and at the other flows into each of two fluid delivery openings.<br>
This embodiment is particularly well suited to the totally even flooding of treatment<br>
baths with a treatment fluid or a treatment medium. In certain processes where<br>
there is a danger of substances being absorbed from the environment, such as for<br>
example oxygen from the air, the flooding must be carried out as far as possible<br>
without the formation of jets or vortexes that could increase the surface area of the<br>
treatment fluid. This object is achieved by the nozzle arrangement according to the<br>
embodiment described above by an even, slow flow speed over the entire effective<br>
length of the nozzle arrangement.<br>
The last embodiment given can be combined with the features of the embodiments<br>
described before it. Of course the last embodiment given may also be constructed<br><br>
without the features described above concerning the creation of a storage chamber or<br>
the use of distribution openings, etc.<br>
The nozzle arrangement according to the invention is preferably suited to use as a<br>
flow nozzle in wet-chemical systems with a horizontal throughput of the printed-circuit<br>
boards. The present invention is not, of course, limited to this preferred range of<br>
application, however. It can be used wherever a work piece has to have a flow<br>
against it from a nozzle arrangement of a treatment fluid, for example also for<br>
cleaning or chemical treatment etc. of the work piece or wherever the most even<br>
possible flooding of a treatment bath with a treatment fluid of this kind has to be<br>
possible. In its most generalized form, therefore, the invention can be used wherever<br>
the most even possible release of a treatment fluid is desired.<br>
The present invention is explained in more detail in the following with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings on the basis of a preferred embodiment.<br>

a line of intersection C-C illustrated in Figure 3.<br>
Figure 8 shows a side view of a nozzle arrangement according to the invention<br>
according to a further embodiment in the form of a partial section.<br>
Figure 9 shows a top view of the nozzle arrangement illustrated by Figure 8 in<br>
partial section, and<br>
Figure 10 shows a sectional view of the nozzle arrangement from Figure 8 and<br>
Figure 9 along a line of intersection C-C illustrated in Figure 8.<br>
The nozzle arrangement illustrated in Figure 1, which is particularly suited as a flow<br>
nozzle for galvanisation systems with a horizontal throughput of printed-circuit<br>
boards, comprises an essentially parallelepiped-shaped housing 2. On a rear face<br>
of the housing 2 a connecting sleeve 1 coupled to a fluid feed opening of the<br>
housing is arranged for the feeding of a treatment fluid. On a side face of the<br>
housing 2 arranged opposite the work piece to be treated or the treatment product<br>
rows of slots or of bore holes offset from one another are arranged that form the<br>
delivery openings 8 for the treatment fluid. In the embodiments illustrated all slotted<br>
delivery openings or bore holes 8 have the same dimensions and accordingly the<br>
same length and width or diameter. Differing dimensions can also be selected,<br>
however, in order to generate a predefined spray or flow picture.<br><br>
In the inside of the housing 2 a wedge-shaped insert 3, which is preferably made<br>
from plastic is arranged, along with a U-shaped stiffener 4 for stabilising this insert<br>
3 that is made from a metal that is resistant to the chemicals used, such as special<br>
steel, titanium, niobium or similar.<br>
As described in more detail in the following, the purpose of the insert 3 is to<br>
balance the flow speed in the fluid channel and thus to evenly distribute the<br>
treatment fluid over the entire length of the nozzle arrangement.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 1, in particular, the insert 3 runs conically in the<br>
longitudinal direction, so that at its end arranged adjoining the connecting sleeve 1<br>
it has the lowest thickness and at its opposite end the greatest thickness. Between<br>
the insert 3 and the stiffener 4 there is a hollow space that serves as the fluid<br>
channel 5 for the treatment fluid. At the end coupled to the connecting sleeve 1, the<br>
flow section of this fluid channel 5 is accordingly at its greatest and decreases<br>
continuously towards the opposite end, where the flow section is at its least.<br>
The nozzle arrangement has, on the surface opposite to the treatment product and<br>
along its length the preferably evenly spaced delivery openings 8 in the form of<br>
through holes, which in the embodiment illustrated all have the same diameter. In<br>
place of the bore holes illustrated slotted delivery opening can also be used.<br>
As can be seen, again, from Figure 1, the length of these delivery openings 8 is the<br>
same over the entire length of the nozzle arrangement. The treatment fluid is<br>
passed through the nozzle arrangement in the direction of the arrow via the<br>
connecting sleeve 1 into the fluid channel 5 and in the longitudinal direction to the<br>
delivery openings 8.<br><br>
Since on account of the wedge-shaped insert 3 the flow speed at all points of the<br>
fluid channel 5 is the same and all delivery openings 8 have the same dimensions,<br>
a very even spray picture results.<br>
According to Figure 2, the wedge-shaped insert is arranged in the top part of the<br>
nozzle arrangement. The delivery openings 8 are present in the housing 2 and in<br>
the insert 3 identically. This results in delivery channels of differing lengths but with<br>
the same diameter of delivery openings. The differing length delivery channels can<br>
be used for a further balancing of the spray picture. In the longer bore holes at a<br>
greater distance from the fluid inlet there is an increased flow resistance towards<br>
the end, which provides a further balancing of the flow conditions.<br>
According to Figure 3 in an insert 3 there is a milling or a recess and in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the insert 3 distribution openings 7 are formed at intervals<br>
from each other. The milling or the recess on the insert 3 creates between the<br>
distribution openings 7 of the insert 3 and the slotted delivery openings 8 formed in<br>
the housing 2 (not illustrated in this figure) a storage chamber 6 for the treatment<br>
fluid, which serves to further distribute the pressure. The fluid jet emitted from each<br>
distribution opening 7 is initially emitted against the housing wall, diverted<br>
diagonally downwards from here against the wall of the insert 3 before, following a<br>
further change of direction, emerging from the slotted delivery opening 8 onto the<br>
treatment product 10. This deviation is intended to release the dynamic force of the<br>
moving fluid.<br>
Figure 7 shows as section C-C, illustrated in Figure 3, further details of the nozzle<br>
arrangement.<br>
The distribution openings 7 have differing lengths due to the wedge-shaped insert<br>
3. If this difference in length proves troublesome the bore holes can be provided<br><br>
with countersinkings 9 of differing length in accordance with detail D (illustrated in<br>
Figure 3) in order to adjust the flow conditions.<br>
A combination of the continuously reducing fluid channel 5 from the feed opening<br>
to the opposite end of the nozzle arrangement communicating with the storage<br>
chamber 6 and the multiple deviations of the fluid flow before delivery from the<br>
delivery openings 8 (e.g. a row of slots) ensures that the same quantity of fluid<br>
emerges from each slot and at the same discharge speed.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 5, the stiffener 4 essentially runs along the entire<br>
length of the insert 3. At the outer end of the stiffener the thickness of the insert 3 is<br>
increased by the wall thickness of the stiffener. This ensures a tight seal on the<br>
fluid channel 5 in the inside of the housing 2 of the nozzle arrangement (see also<br>
Figure 3). The insert 3 is also thicker by the same amount along its top side, so<br>
that it sits securely on the U-shaped stiffener 4, as can be seen from Figure 7. It is<br>
also possible, however, to position the U-shaped stiffener on the outside of the<br>
housing 2. To this end the additional thickness on the insert 3 can be dispensed<br>
with. The stiffener can also be secured to the housing by means of screws, for<br>
example. The screws should not, however, protrude into the fluid channel 5.<br>
In the embodiments illustrated in Figures 3 - 7 an even flow speed of the treatment<br>
fluid at the outlet openings 8 is in principle achieved by two measures. Firstly, the<br>
throughput section for the treatment fluid decreases continuously inside the nozzle<br>
arrangement, that is in the fluid channel 5, from the connecting sleeve 1 to the end<br>
of the nozzle arrangement due to the insert 3 that runs diagonally. Secondly, the<br>
distribution openings 7 do not carry the treatment fluid directly to the treatment<br>
product. Instead it is twice diverted and only then is it delivered via the fluid delivery<br>
openings 8, in this example rows of slots.<br><br>
The flow resistance in the distribution openings 7 increases continuously because<br>
of their increasing length. In order that this does not have any effect on the fluid<br>
distribution, the inclination of the insert 3, illustrated in Figures 2, 3 and 5, is<br>
preferably selected to be somewhat flatter so that a gap still remains at the end of<br>
the nozzle arrangement. In the example in Figure 3 the gap height at the end is<br>
approximately 4 mm.<br>
A combination of the two measures (inclined or tapered insert and fluid deviation in<br>
the additional storage chamber) leads to the best results, since the reduction in<br>
section of the fluid channel 5 alone can possibly only bring about an inadequate<br>
pressure equalisation and the jets emerge diagonally. Since with this combination<br>
the delivery openings 8 preferably all have the same widths or diameters, the same<br>
volume of fluid per unit of time flows from all the delivery openings.<br>
Figure 6 shows a further example of a nozzle arrangement with a storage chamber<br>
6. Here two inserts 3, 3' are present. Insert 3 is, as already described, wedge-<br>
shaped and fitted in the bottom section of the nozzle arrangement. Insert 3' in the<br>
top part of the nozzle arrangement has the same section along its entire length. In<br>
insert 3' there are distribution bore holes 7. These all have the same length.<br>
Accordingly, the wedge-shaped fluid channel is steeper at the end than illustrated<br>
in Figures 2, 3 and 5.<br>
Nevertheless, by taking just one of the two measures described above it may be<br>
possible in a particular application to achieve a sufficiently even flow speed of the<br>
treatment fluid to the delivery openings 8.<br>
Of course, a number of modifications to the embodiments illustrated in the figures<br>
are conceivable, without deviating from the basic ideas of the invention. Thus, for<br>
example, the connecting sleeve 1 could be moved to the middle of tine housing 2 of<br>
the nozzle arrangement, so that the feed of the treatment fluid takes place<br><br>
centrally. With this variant the throughput section of the fluid channel 5 inside the<br>
housing 2 from the central connecting sleeve 1 to both ends of the housing 2, i.e.<br>
bilaterally, would decrease and the thickness of the insert 3, correspondingly from<br>
the central connecting sleeve 1 to the two ends would increase in width, so that the<br>
length of the distribution openings 7 in the insert 3 also increases bilaterally.<br>
Furthermore, in the embodiments illustrated the continuously reducing throughput<br>
section of the fluid channel 5 is achieved solely through the increasing width of the<br>
insert 3. It is, of course, also conceivable for several side faces of the fluid channel<br>
5 to be increasingly broadened in the longitudinal direction of the housing 2. On top<br>
of this it may be possible to dispense with the storage chamber 6 for further<br>
pressure distribution.<br>
In order to improve the evenness of the flow speed the slotted delivery openings 8<br>
may also have a different width, whereby the width, in particular in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the housing 2, can decrease from the inlet sleeve 1. This generally<br>
leads to differing volume flows that may cause varying results on the treatment<br>
product.<br>
Notwithstanding the embodiments illustrated the distribution openings 7 may also<br>
be designed with differing diameters, whereby in order to create a continuously<br>
increasing flow resistance in particular a continuous reduction in the diameter of<br>
the distribution openings 7 is conceivable, since towards the end of the nozzle<br>
arrangement the overall pressure is at its highest.<br>
On the side of the distribution openings 7 bordering the fluid channel 5 the former<br>
can be provided with countersinkings 9 with a larger diameter (see Figure 3). In<br>
order to create a continuously increasing flow resistance in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the housing 2 these countersinkings can have a different depth, in<br><br>
particular a depth that continuously increases in the longitudinal direction of the<br>
housing 2.<br>
It may also be possible to dispense with the stiffener 4 illustrated in the drawing. It<br>
is also conceivable that the insert 3 and the housing 2 are built as a single piece.<br>
Finally, it should be mentioned that with the embodiment illustrated a number of<br>
delivery openings 8 are in fact provided at intervals in the longitudinal direction of<br>
the housing 2, which are in particular evenly spaced and arranged in two rows of<br>
slots that are arranged with an offset to one another, whereby in principle,<br>
however, a proper and satisfactory operability of the nozzle arrangement is also<br>
guaranteed with simply an, in particular, longitudinal delivery opening 8, for<br>
example with just a slotted delivery opening 8 extending in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the housing 2.<br>
Figures 8-10 illustrate a further nozzle arrangement according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention, whereby Figure 8 illustrates a side view of the nozzle<br>
arrangement on the partial section, Figure 9 a top view of the nozzle arrangement<br>
in the partial section and Figure 10 a sectional view of the nozzle arrangement<br>
along a line of intersection C-C shown in Figure 8.<br>
The nozzle arrangement shown in Figures 8-10 concerns an embodiment which is<br>
particularly well-suited to the even flooding of treatment baths with a treatment<br>
fluid. In certain processes where there is a danger of substances being absorbed<br>
from the environment, such as oxygen from the air, the flooding must be carried<br>
out as far as possible without the formation of jets or vortexes that could increase<br>
the surface area of the treatment fluid. The nozzle arrangement illustrated in<br>
Figures 8-10 achieves this by an even, slow flow speed over the entire effective<br>
length of the nozzle arrangement.<br><br>
The nozzle arrangement illustrated in Figures 8-10 comprises, like the<br>
embodiments described previously, a connecting sleeve 1 and a longitudinal,<br>
essentially parallelepiped housing 2, in which an insert 3 is fitted, which defines a<br>
fluid channel 5 with a section that reduces continuously in the longitudinal direction<br>
of the nozzle arrangement or the housing 2. In this connection, it can be seen in<br>
particular from Figure 9 that the insert 3 bilaterally reduces the section of the fluid<br>
channel 5, whereby the section of the fluid channel 5 is continuously and evenly<br>
reduced from the connecting sleeve 1 to the end of the nozzle arrangement, so<br>
that in the fluid channel 5 itself approximately the same flow speed of the treatment<br>
fluid always exists.<br>
On one side of the housing 2 a fluid-tight lid or covering 11 is arranged on the<br>
housing by means of a suitable jointing method such as welding or gluing. As can<br>
be seen from Figure 8 and Figure 9, on its underside the covering 11 has a number<br>
of slots or connecting channels running diagonally to the longitudinal direction of<br>
the nozzle arrangement, which in particular are spaced evenly along the entire<br>
effective length of the nozzle arrangement. These slots in the lid 11, together with<br>
the housing 2, from fluid delivery openings 8 for the treatment fluid.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 10, with this embodiment the treatment fluid fed via the<br>
connecting sleeve 1 of the nozzle arrangement, from the fluid channel 5 via the<br>
slots formed in the lid 11 can be delivered at the fluid delivery openings 8 provided<br>
bilaterally on the nozzle arrangement or the housing 2.<br>
Of course, the nozzle arrangement illustrated in Figures 8-10 can also be<br>
combined with the features of the nozzle arrangement described previously using<br>
Figures 1-7.<br>
The description of the nozzle arrangement according to the invention involves, in<br>
all the embodiments, the transport of the treatment fluid from the nozzle<br><br>
arrangement to the treatment product. The nozzle arrangement functions in the<br>
same way as well for the sucking of the treatment fluid from the treatment product<br>
into the nozzle arrangement. If during the treatment decomposition products result<br>
or solid matter is applied, this form of electrolyte transport is particularly<br>
advantageous. By sucking the treatment liquid into the nozzle arrangement the<br>
decomposition products or solid matter are entrained and thus reach a<br>
regeneration unit or a filter that removes the solid matter, as quickly as possible.<br>
Interference with the treatment results by this matter is thus virtually excluded.<br><br>
