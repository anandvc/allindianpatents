Various methods, systems and apparatus relating to the present invention are disclosed in the following co-pending applications filed by the applicant or assignee of the present<br><br>
invention on June 30,2000:<br>
PCT/AU00/00743,     PCT/AUOO/OO744,     PCT/AU00/00745,     PCT/AU00/00746,<br>
PCT/AU00/00747 and PCT/AU00/00748 The disclosures of these co-pending applications are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The applicant has disclosed in pending applications USSN 09/113,070 and USSN<br>
09/112,785 cards called Artcards in which the information is encoded in black ink on a white background on the reverse face of the printed card, the front surface of the card bearing an image. The data that may be recorded may be the contents of a book recorded in a digital manner with the from face bearing an image equivalent to the dust jacket of the book.<br>
In such prior art, two printheads are required in order to simultaneously print the image on the front of the card and the digital data on the rear of the card. To read the card, the card is passed through an optical scanning means and the fault tolerant encoded data is reconstructed and decoded and provided to a user as an audio or visual output.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a user interface for reading data encoded •in a fault<br>
tolerant form in infrared ink on a surface simultaneously bearing an image.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for reading data encoded in a fault tolerant digital form printed in invisible ink on a surface of a card said surface bearing an image comprising:<br>
a)	scanning means for scanning said encoded fault tolerant digital form of said data on said surface in the infrared;<br>
b)	means for processing said scanned data and for decoding said data into 'a secondary digital format;<br>
c)	means for outputting said data in said secondary digital format to an output device with which said secondary digital format is usable;<br>
d)	said output device presenting said data in a human readable form.<br>
Preferably the invisible ink may be an infrared (IR) absorbing ink with negligible absorption in the visible spectrum.<br>
Preferably, the data is encoded on the card using a Reed-Solomon encoding process after compression of the data. This allows recovery of the data notwithstanding up to 30%<br><br>
damage to the print media upon which the data is recorded (image encoded form). The card for example may be a standard card as disclosed in co-pending applications lodged hereto PCT/AU01/01317 (Docket No. ART8O), PCT/AU01/01328 (Docket No. ART8l) and PCT/AU01/01326 (Docket No. ART82) of the size of a photograph of approximately 4" x 6" (102mm x 152mm). It is also contemplated that other formats are also possible for the card for example of the same width but shorter or longer depending upon the amount of data which is recorded or to be recorded on the print media.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Notwithstanding any other form which may fall within the scale of the present<br>
invention, preferred forms of the invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawing of Fig 1 which illustrates the card reading arrangement of the preferred embodiment.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED AND OTHER EMBODIMENTS<br>
The   preferred   embodiment   is    preferably   implemented   through   sµitable<br>
programming of a hand held device such as that described in the applicant's applications PCT/AU01/01317 (Docket No. ART8O), PCT/AU01/01328 (Docket No. ART8l) and PCT/AU01/01326 (Docket No. ART82) filed concurrently herewith by the present applicant the content of which is hereby specifically incorporated by reference. These applications make reference to tl:ie applicant's prior applications USSN 09/113,070 and USSN 09/112,785.<br>
The aforementioned patent specifications disclose an apparatus including a camera system, hereinafter known as an "Artcam" type camera system, wherein sensed images can be directly printed out by the camera unit using an Inkjet pagewidth printhead having at least four separate Inkjet nozzles for printing a color image and an infi:ared image simultaneously on a print media. A pagevvddth printhead of this type was described by the applicant in co-pending applications PCT/AU00/00743, PCT/AU00/00744, PCT/AU00/00745, PCT/AU0O/00746, PCT/AU00/00747 and PCT/AU00/00748 and the descriptions thereof are hereby specifically incorporated by reference.<br>
In the above referenced patent specifications, namely PCT/AU01/01317, (Docket No. ART8O), PCT/AU01/01328 (Docket No. ART8l) and PCT/AU01/01326 (Docket No. ART82), data in a fault tolerant encoded form is printed in infi¾red ink over a color image. The data which was described in each of these<br><br>
specifications related respectively to storing a fault tolerant encoded digital form of the image itself, a fault tolerant encoded digital form of the image itself along with an image processing program script which enabled the image to be processed to produce a given effect thereon, and a copy of the image itself and of a transformed copy of that image, the transformation being achieved by a program which could be separately loaded into the camera system.<br>
In the present application, the invention resides in recording digital data on an image, the digital data relating to other than the image itself or any manipulation thereof. For example, as described in the applicant's prior art of USSN 09/113,070 a card may be printed using a fault tolerant digitally encoded form comprising a book on one surface of a print media while on the other face of the print media an image is recorded, for example in this case the dust jacket of the book. The cards that were described were of the size of a credit card of approximately 85mm x 55mm size. The card was printed on both faces. In the present invention the card needs only to be printed on one face with the data being recorded in infra red ink and thus invisible to a human reader. As described in the applicant's co-pending applications PCT/AU01/01317 (Docket No. ART8O), PCT/AU01/01328 (Docket No. ART8l) and PCT/AU01/01326 (Docket No. ART82), a card of approximate size 4" x 6" (102mm x 152mm) can contain approximately 3-<br>
4megabytes of data depending on how the data is encoded and distributed across the surface of the card. The data in those applications is distributed in such a way that full recovery of the data there encoded, namely an image, can be recovered even if up to 30% damage has occurred to the surface of the card. To store an average page of text requires approximately 2 kbytes of digital data for text only, hence 3 megabytes of data would record approximately 1.5 thousand pages of written text. An average book contains between 250-550 pages and such a book is readily accommodated by the format of the present disclosure. In addition, :images may be interspersed with the text as thumbnail (reduced sized) images in a suitable file format for example jpeg, gif, tiff, bmp to name a few.<br>
The preferred embodiment provides an adaptation of the particular technology as disclosed in the aforementioned patent specifications PCT/AU01/01317 (Docket No. ART8O), PCT/AU01/01328 (Docket No. ART8l) and PCT/AU01/01326 (Docket No. ART82). In this adaptation, the camera system and the printing system is<br><br>
dispensed with and replaced with a large screen reader. The cards according to the preferred embodiment are then provided having an indicator of the information which is recorded on the card. The information in a fault tolerant encoded form is printed in infrared ink over that indicator. For example the card could include a book's content or a newspaper content. An example of such a system is as illustrated in Fig 1 wherein the card 10 includes a book title on the card with data printed thereon in infrared ink as shown by arrow 11. The card 10 is inserted in the reader 12 which includes a flexible display 13 which allows for the folding up of the card reader 12. The card reader includes display controls 14 which allow for paging forward and back and other controls of the card reader 12.<br>
It can therefore be seen that the arrangement of Fig 1 provides for an efficient distribution of information in the form of books, newspapers, magazines, technical manuals, and so forth.<br>
Various inkjet technologies can be used for printing of the card according to the cxirrent disclosure, for example íin inkjet pagewidth printhead such as disclosed in the applicant's co-pending applications PCT/AU00/00743, PCT/AU00/00744, PCT/AU00/00745, PCT/AU00/00746, PCT/AU00/00747 and PCT/AU00/00748 may be used. Suitable infrared ink is disclosed in the applicant's co-pending applications, Australian provisional patent applications PQ94I2 and PQ9376 filed on 14 August 2000 and applicant's applications PQ95O9 filed on 18 August 2000, and PQ957l, and PQ956l filed on 21 August 2000. Data may be encoded in a manner or using a format as disclosed in applicant's USSN 09/113,070 and USSN 09/112,785, or PCT/AU01/01317 (Docket No. ART8O), PCT/AU01/01328 (Docket No. ART8l) and PCT/AU01/01326 (Docket No. ART82), for example the Artcard format or the alternative Artcard format. Other formats may be used.<br>
It would be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that numerous vari^atio¤s and/or modifications may be made to the present invention as shown in the specific embodiment without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present invention is, therefore, to be considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive.<br><br><br><br><br>

Description of the prior art<br>
Biologically important compound of benzyl-piperidylmethyl-indanones derivative is 1 -benzyl-4- [(5,6-dimethoxy-1 -indanon)-2-yl]methylpiperidine generically known, as Donepezil. Donepezil is useful as a medicament, specifically as an acetyl cholinesterase inhibitor, more specifically as an agent for preventing, treating and improving various kinds of senile dementia, cerebrovascular dementia or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and further specifically as an agent for preventing, treating and improving Alzheimer-type senile dementia. Donepezil is a new drug treatment for use in mild to moderate dementia due to SDAT. Donepezil acts by inhibiting acetylcholine esterase, the enzyme responsible for metabolising acetylcholine, thereby enhancing neurotransmitter levels.<br>
JP-A 64-79151(1989) discloses a process for the preparation of Donepezil by reacting 5,6-dimethoxy-l-indanone with 1-benzyl-4-formylpiperidine in the presence of strong base such as lithium diisopropylamide followed by reduction.<br>
JP-A 8-225527 (1996) (EP-711,756-A1, U.S. Pat. No. 5,606,064) discloses a process for the preparation of Donepezil, which comprises reaction of 5,6-dimethoxy-l-indanone with pyridin-4-aldehyde afforded 5,6-dimethoxy-2-(pyridin-4-yl)methyleneindan-l-one followed by reaction with benzyl bromide<br><br>
afforded	1 -benzyl-4-(5,6-dimethoxyindan-1 -on-2-ylidene)methylpiridinium<br>
bromide, then reduction in the presence of platinum oxide afforded Donepezil. The reduction in the last step was not reproducible. Hence suffers in scaleup.<br>
W097/22584 describes a process which involves reaction of (pyridin-4-yl)<br>
carboxyaldehyde with malonic acid afforded 3-(pyridin-4-yl) -2-propenoic acid,<br>
followed by reduction afforded 3- (piperidin-4-yl) -2-propionic acid, followed by<br>
reaction with methyl chlorocarbonate afforded 3-[N- (methoxycarbonyl) piperidin-<br>
4-yl] propionic acid, followed by reaction with oxalyl chloride afforded methyl 4-<br>
(2-chlorocarbonylethyl)piperidin-l-carboxylate, followed by reaction with 1,2-<br>
dimethoxybenzene in the presence of aluminum chloride afforded methyl 4-[3-<br>
(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-oxopropyl]piperidin-l-carboxylate, followed by reaction<br>
