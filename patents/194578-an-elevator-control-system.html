				<td>Background<br>
1. Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to a technology to communicate several information in an elevator according to serial transmission methods. Particularly, an elevator control system which transmits the several information for the elevator driving state serially, comprises an elevator controller for controlling an elevator car driving state, a floor controller for controlling input/output signals generated from a plurality of floors, and the floor controllers installed in each floor in a building, and a plurality of car controllers for controlling input/output signals generated from in the car. Accordingly, using these devices, it can maximize the communication efficiency and of improving the communication reliability among the elevator controller, the floor controllers, and the car controllers.<br>
2. Description of the Prior Art<br>
In general, the conventional elevator system provides with a number of communication lines which are extended from an elevator machine room to each floor for transmitting an lighting signal of an responding lamp to a hall call signal generated at each floor in a building, and for transmitting the car position indicating signal to the indicator installed in the car.<br>
However, as buildings become higher, and users of an elevator system require more sophisticated services about an elevator control and an indicating method, it was difficult<br>
1A<br><br>
to troubleshoot and repair parts(especially, interfaces between controllers).<br>
To eliminate these disadvantages described above, there is a continued study for reducing numbers of lines installed and for introducing the compatibility of interfaces between the various controllers.<br>
As one of the result of the above-mentioned studies, it is proposed that an elevator controller and a plurality of car controllers be linked together in common cable, and the signals of respective controller are transmitted usina serial transmission method bv a microprocessor. However, such a system has a limited communication efficiency capable of handling elevator system which has sophisticated functions and installed in skyscrapers.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing a conventional elevator signal transmission device. In FIG. 1, there are an elevator controller 1 for controlling overall elevator traveling operation upon receiving signals from floor controllers 3A-3C, a hall signal transmitting repeater 2 for sending signals transmitted from the floor controllers 3A-3C to said elevator controller, and for sending the received signals which the elevator controller 1 transmits to the floor controllers 3A-3C installed in each floor in a building via a common transmission line 6, the floor controllers 3A-3C for outputting a traveling information and a responding lamp signal to car position indicators 4A-4C and to hall call button devices 5A-5C received from the hall signal transmitting repeater 2, and for transmitting a call signal input via the call button devices 5A-5C to the hall signal transmitting repeater 2, the car position indicators 4A-4C for displaying a current traveling position of the elevator by receiving a traveling information from the floor controllers 3A-3C, and the floor call button devices 5A-5C for transmitting the call signals to the floor controllers in accordance with the waiting user request, and for displaying that the call signal is registered according to the control<br>
2<br><br>
of the floor controllers.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing another example of a signal transmission device in an elevator system as the prior art. An elevator controller 1, a hall signal transmitting repeater 2, floor controllers 3A-3C, car position indicators 4A-4C, and hall call button devices 5A-5C are the same as in FIG. 1. In FIG. 2 the elevator system further comprises a car controller 7 for transmitting an output signal of car devices to the hall signal transmitting repeater 2 via the common transmission line 6, and for receiving the traveling information in the elevator from the hall signal transmitting repeater 2, a car indicator 8 for displaying the current traveling position and direction of the elevator by receiving the traveling information from the car controller in the elevator, and a car operating panel 9 for transmitting the generated call signal according to the user request in the car to the car controllers, and for lighting a corresponding floor button by receiving the driving state signal of the responding lamp accordingly. The operation of the signal transmission devices constructed as above will be described with reference to FIG. 3.<br>
The signal transmission among the respective controllers in FIGs. 1, 2 is accomplished by the transmission data format illustrated in FIG. 3. The elevator controller 1, first of all, assigns the floor controller 3C of a first floor, and transmits floor output signals, such as a call responding signal, voice information signal, according to the responding signal received. Thereafter, the elevator controller 1 receives a floor input signal, such as the call button input signal, parking floor designating signal, floor controller check code, and so on from the floor controller 3C.<br>
The elevator controller 1 also assigns the floor controller 3B on a second floor according to the operation described above, transmits the floor output signal, and then<br>
3<br><br>
receives the floor input signal from the floor controller 3B again. In such ways described above, the elevator controller 1 is capable of successively communicating with the floor controller 3A on the top floor.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 2, in the event that the car controller 7 is linked to the hall signal transmitting repeater 2 via a common transmission line, the elevator controller 1 transmits the output signal to car controller 7 by assigning the respective car controller 7. Thereafter, the elevator controller 1 receives the input signal from the car controller 7 so that the communication among these controllers are accomplished for data exchange.<br>
Upon the completion of sending/receiving operation either between the elevator controller 1 and the car controller 7 or between the elevator controller 1 and the floor controllers 3A-3C for data exchange, respectively, the elevator controller 1 simultaneously transmits a common information of both the car controller 7 and the floor controllers 3A-3C.<br>
The common information might comprise an indicator display information for displaying a current floor position of the car, a direction display lamp information for indicating the up/down traveling direction, a full-car lamp displaying information for noticing the being passed-through without stopping since the car is full, a pause lamp information for indicating that the elevator car does not run in a predetermined period of, time, and so on.<br>
Upon the completion of the communication from the elevator controller 1 to either the plurality of floor controllers 3A-3C or the car controller 7 for exchange of the individual information and a common information, in other words, from the hall signal transmitting repeater 2 to both the plurality of floor controllers 3A-3C and the car controller 7 in the manner as described above, the various indicator units installed at the floor controllers<br>
4<br><br>
3A-3C and the car controller 1, are received the .corresponding signal to display the extra information, such as a weather forecast, a stock market information, an advertising information and so on, in the case of having visual or audible display information units.<br>
in summary, RG. 3 illustrates the process comprising a first period of time set at will according to the building floor number at which the hall signal transmitting repeater 2 transmits the individual information after assigning successively the respective remote controllers, in other words, the floor controllers 3A-3C and the car controller 7, a second period of transmitting the common information to the remote controllers, and a third period of transmitting various information in accordance with a visual and an audible information process devices. This process is finished as one period, accomplished by repeating above 3 transmission periods.<br>
Since the sending/receiving operation of the individual information for the corresponding floor is performed by assigning the respective devices of each floor during the first period of time, a problem of which the transmission period becomes longer might be partially solved, a constant answering time is guaranteed for taking it granted that the transmission device is slow, and the extra information except the elevator control information can be also transmitted.<br>
After the elevator controller assigns the respective floor controllers, it can detect the failure of the corresponding floor controllers when exchanging the individual information during the first period of time, and after passed the predetermined period of time, it can service normally in the elevator controller when repaired the failure of the corresponding floor controllers issued in Korean Patent No. 96-12682.<br>
It is natural that the information via the transmission line increases in case that a<br>
5<br><br>
building becomes higher, devices installed in the elevator system are more various, and the devices which process various kinds of information use the one transmission line. In this case, although the transmission speed should be quick to transmit a lot of information during a predetermined period of time, it is desirable that the transmission speed is slow properly to improve the reliability of communication.<br>
However, in the event that the signal is transmitted by using the conventional communication method as described above even though the building becomes higher, and the elevator runs express, a sending/receiving time of the first period of time is longer in proportion to the number of building floors, the sending/receiving period of time is always assigned the devices in the elevator system, and actually do not generate the input signals in the process of sending/receiving the individual information on the respective system by designating successively devices of the respective system as well. Accordingly, there are shortcomings that a transmitting time is delayed when the signals are generated in each floor or an indicating time for displaying the driving state of the elevator is delayed because a designation time of the second period of time and the third period of time is assigned late, and it takes much time relatively when the plurality of floor controllers check the failure at every predetermined period of time. These shortcomings are more serious in case of an express elevator.<br>
Summary<br>
As a result, this invention is invented to solve the above described shortcomings. The present invention establishes a transmission line for transmitting signals between the elevator controller and the plurality of floor controllers and between the elevator controller<br>
6<br><br>
and the car controllers, respectively: And a repeater for transmitting a hall signal and a car signal on the transmission line are respectively established.

The invention will be described with reference to FIGs. 4 to 19 which are added for the present invention operation.<br>
First, the floor controllers 107A-109A are divided into the group zones 200A-200D of four units shown in FIGs. 6a, 6b when a hall signal transmitting repeater 102 transmits the signal among the floor controllers 107A-109A shown in FIG. 4, and this process is<br>
25<br><br>
described hereinto.<br>
The hall signal transmitting repeater 102 carries out a series of communicating function according to the program stored at an internal ROM. The hall signal transmitting repeater 102 puts together both a selective signal of group zones 200A-200D about the floor controllers 201A-216A received from the elevator controller 101 and the individual information, and transmits them to the floor controllers 201A-216A after receiving the selective signal and the common information at the same time. The floor controllers 201A-216A on each floor received the selective signal and the common signal send the information to the hall signal transmitting repeater 102, in which the common information is transmitted via a parallel input/output device, and the individual information is output selectively.<br>
Additionally, the floor controllers 201A-216A transmit the signal repeatedly after deciding the period of time to answer by detecting the selective signal of the group zones 200A-200D, the selective signal is included in the received individual information. And the signal flowchart about the operation is illustrated by referring FIG.9, and FIGs. 11a-11c from now.<br>
After inputting an initial power supply, a microprocessor installed in the hall signal transmitting repeater 102 carries out an initialization setting step(step101) which is a various of parallel input/output devices according to the predetermined order by programming, and waits(step102) a completion for a synchronization process of the elevator controller 101.<br>
And then, the hall signal transmitting repeater 102 receives the control data and communication parameters required for communicating according to the synchronization<br>
26<br><br>
process of the elevator controller 101, and checks the floor controllers 201A-216A during the predetermined period of time. After checking the hall signal transmitting repeater 102 sends the result to the elevator controller 101 and then goes to the next step(step103). After checking, the individual information transmitted(step104) from the floor controllers 201A-216A is transmitted from the elevator controller 101.<br>
The operation which exchanges the information with the elevator controller 101 is accomplished successively at every predetermined period of time under the control of the elevator controller 101.<br>
Here, the floor common information received from the elevator controller 101 is a traveling direction information, a floor character information for indicating a current car position, and an information for displaying a car driving state, such as an emergency traveling, a repairing traveling, and a car load state(for example, a lamp for indicating a full-car) altogether being an additional lighting lamp signal. And an arrival forecasting of the car, a lantern of noticing reservation, and a chime information may be included.<br>
And a corresponding elevator state information to know the state of the elevator car includes the state signal of the corresponding elevator itself whose signal is for transmitting to the other corresponding elevator, in other words, the signal of FIG. 10a when 2 more elevators carry out a parallel traveling by owning together the hall call signal.<br>
After finished a 104 step(step104), the elevator controller 101 receive a framed check data, and the corresponding state information received from the elevator controller 101 and the floor common information are transmitted to all of the floor controllers 201A-216A, the other elevator or the group managing part (step105-step107).<br>
Moreover, in case that there is an individual information(such as a call signal<br>
27<br><br>
generated in the floor) for sending to the floor controllers 201A-216A, the individual information is mixed with the floor selecting signal of the group zones 200A-200D calculated from the floor controllers? state data during the synchronization process, and then transmits the mixed information to the respective floor controllers 201A-216A. But, in case that there is no the individual information, the floor selecting signal of the group zones is transmitted during receiving(step108-step111).<br>
The sending/receiving synchronization process according to the selective signal of the group zone 200A will be described.<br>
The group zone is divided into 4 units according to a communication load capacity calculated from the plurality of floor controllers 201A-216A in FIGs. 6a, 6b. In this case, in the event of transmitting the individual information and a selective signal of the group zone 200A after the elevator controller 101 transmits the common information, the all floor controllers 201A-216A send the individual information to the hall signal transmitting repeater 102 when the selective signal is assigned to a self-group zone as receiving the selective signal. The group zone is divided according to the communication load capacity, implements the communication as dividing into 8 units in FIGs. 7a, 7b.<br>
And then the hall signal transmitting repeater 102 identifies whether or not the individual information received from the floor controllers 201A-216A is stored in an internal buffer, if so, the hall signal transmitting repeater 102 edits the individual information from each floor controller so as to transmit to the elevator controller 101 in next period of time(step112, step 113).<br>
Additionally, shown in FIG. 11c the individual information which is received from each floor controllers 201A-216A generated successively is stored in the internal memory<br>
28<br><br>
with an event format, and this process is transacted to an extra routine.<br>
On the other hand, the floor controllers 107A-109A process the input/output signal of the floor devices installed in each floor shown in FIG. 4, in other words, the car position indicators 107B-109B, and hall call button devices 107C-109C. As illustrating the above process, the example is that the floor controllers 107A-109A are divided into the group zones 200A-200D of 4 units shown in FIGs. 6a, 6b and the signal flowchart about the process are illustrated hereinto as referring to FIGs. 12a-12c.<br>
After performing an internal initialization step according to the program stored in the internal ROM after being supplied with an initial power supply, the floor controllers 201A-216A identify whether the floor common information received from the elevator controller 101 and the individual information exists or not. And then if exists, the floor controllers 201A-216A transmit the floor common information to the car position indicators 107B-109B via the internal parallel signal interface circuits S201-S203.<br>
The transmitted common information indicates the format example in FIG. 10(a). An information of displaying a car position and a direction lamp information do not give the extra identifying number because the data position is predetermined.<br>
And then FIG. 10b indicates the format example about the individual information of each floor, the individual information includes the individual information about a hall call of each floor, and a floor control command which controls the hail signal transmitting repeater 102.<br>
The floor controllers 201A-216A which receive the individual information of each floor determine whether the group zone selecting signal being in the floor control command designates the group zone of itself. If designated, the floor controllers<br>
29<br><br>
201A-216A decide the timing to send the identifier of itself and data. Otherwise, the floor controllers 201A-216A set a corresponding flag and predicts a busy communication fine about receiving the floor checking command of the other group zones(step204-step206).<br>
Next, the floor controllers 201A-216A compare the floor identifier(ID) being in the individual information about the half call with the ID set in the- corresponding floor controlfers(step207). After being determined that they are matching to each other, the individual information(call responding signal) is transmitted to the corresponding hall call button device among the hall call button devices 201C-216C via the internal floor parallel signal interface circuit(step208). Otherwise, it goes to the step209 directly.<br>
As identifying whether the transmission timing is up according to the previous floor command, if so, the floor controllers 201A-216A identify whether the signal from the hall call button devices 201C-216C is pushed or not(step210). After this step, in the event that there is an input signal, the floor controllers 201A-216A reset a prediction flag after transmitting the signal to the hall signal transmitting repeater 102 as coupling a side information which may be distinct the floor controllers 210A-216A, the call button input signal(an upward or downward call), the floor individual information including the floor identifier, and an information indicating that the floor controllers 210A-216A are normal S211. However, if not, the floor controllers 210A-216A transmit the signal only to the hall signal transmitting repeater 102 in a designated transmission period of time.<br>
Additionally, after confirming the step 209, as determining whether the allowed transmission of the individual information time is up according to the previous floor command, if not, the floor controllers 201A-216A transmit a stored signal to the hall signal transmitting repeater 102 when it approaches the predetermined information transmission<br>
30<br><br>
period of time, after storing the signal which is inputted from the hall call button devices 201C-216C in buffer as determining whether it is the other group zone in the transmission period of time or not.<br>
As accomplishing these series of process repeatedly, the floor controllers 201A-216A identify whether the floor common information or individual information is received from the hall signal transmitting repeater 102. If so, the floor controllers 201A-216A receive and transact the individual information by using the internal memory. FIG. 12c shows these process.<br>
When the signal transmission accomplishes between the hall signal transmitting repeater 102 and the floor controllers 201A-216A, FIG. 9 shows the transmission type of the signal imaginarily.<br>
Like described above, the floor common information in FIG. 9 which is transmitted from the elevator controller 101 to the floor controllers 201A-216A of each floor is the same as A signal, and it is transmitted at each predetermined period of time successively as indicating a first to fourth transmission period of time. FIG. 10 shows a data format of the signals.<br>
In FIG. 9, the A signal is set in the elevator controller 101 as an information transmitted from the other respective elevators or group management control panels, and floor controllers 201A-216A of all the floors. The other respective elevators or group management control panels received the signals recognize the number of the current valid information on the basis of the data size field, and uses the internal control transaction signal after receiving the respective elevator state information as the same number of the current valid information.<br>
31<br><br>
In addition, the floor controllers 201A-216A of all floors output a received information formed in a predetermined place, in other words, a common information which is a floor numeric information indicating a current floor of the elevator, and a direction lamp information to the car position indicators 201B-216B. And the floor controllers 201A-216A of ail floors accomplish a hall call registration in the floor according to the floor control command, a car arrival forecasting function and so on, and carry out the control command according to the floor control command included in the floor common information indicated as A signal in FIG. 9. And the examples of the control command is a signal for checking a lighting state of hall indicators among the floor devices, that is, a chime, and a lighting indicator.<br>
The elevator controller 101 transmits a B signal, the individual information which tells the service assignment in the floor as a format of FIGs. 10b, 10c, besides the A signal which is transmitted to the floor controllers 201A-216A of each floor in FIG. 9. And the transmission transaction will be described hereinto.<br>
First, the B signal is transmitted to the all floor controllers 201A-216A to select a group zone 200A, and the floor controllers 201A-216A answer after receiving the B signal in case that the floor controllers 201A-216A are determined as a corresponding group zone.<br>
Looking a first transmission period of time in FIG. 9, a corresponding floor controllers 201 A, 203A answer about a call request of a first floor and a third floor, the responding signal is processed in the elevator controller 101 and the processing result is included in the individual information of each floor about the first and the second floor of the B signal in a second transmission period of time in case that the group zone selecting<br>
32<br><br>
signal included in the B signal selects and transmits the group zone 200A.<br>
When the group zone selecting signal including the B signal selects and transmits the group zone 200B, the floor controllers 201A-216A received the signal floor ID. The floor controllers 201A-216A of the first floor and the third floor operate the hall call devices, in other words, the car position indicator and the hall call button devices 201B, 201C and 203B, 203C. And the floor controllers 205A-208A included in the group zone 200B transmit both a button input signal and a checking signal to the elevator controller 101 via the hall signal transmitting repeater 102, include a process result of the signals with the individual information about 5th-8th floors of B signal in the third transmission period of time.<br>
When the group zone selecting signal selects a group zone 200C, the selecting signal is transmitted to the floor controllers 201A-216A by including the selective signal in floor control command of the individual information, the floor controllers 201A-216A received the signal identify the individual ID. The floor controllers 205A-208A of the 5th floor through the 8th floor operate floor call button devices 205C-208C. And the floor controllers 209A-212A included in the group zone 200C transmit a button input signal and a checking signal to the hall signal transmitting repeater 102.<br>
In a 4th transmission period of time, it returns again to the first transmission period of time after transmitting the signals successively such as a timing figure of FIG. 9.<br>
Because the plurality of floor controllers are sorted to any group according to a communication load capacity, and a transmission time is decided according to the floor controllers in the group, the sending/receiving of the common information and the individual information between the elevator controller 101 and the plurality of floor controllers 201A-216A are efficiently accomplished. And in case that an efficient signal transmission<br>
33<br><br>
can be accomplished in an actual elevator usage environment, when any information needed among the devices besides a control information every time is sent/received, a fast answering and a quick error detection are guaranteed. Also, because an extension of extra devices become easier, the signal may be transmitted nevertheless a skyscraper, and an express elevator.<br>
In the other embodiment, a signal transmission method between the elevator controller 101 and the car controllers 110A, 111A of the car controller group 106 shown in FIG. 4 wili be described hereinto. There may be at least one car traveling operating panel. In other words, the traveling operating panel of the maximum 4 should be installed in the car because the traveling operating panel may be separated and installed the traveling operating panel for a general, for handicapped, and may be divided into a main operating panel and a secondary operating panel, respectively.<br>
Additionally, the car controllers 110A, 111A are independently composed to control input/output signals which are a button signal of a respective operating panel, a switch signal, and a lamp signal of various display devices because the number of the lines are increased in case that several traveling operating panels are installed like above illustrated. And since the respective traveling operating panel is connected to the power supply lines and the communication lines only for operating the car controllers 110A, 111 A, the number of the installed lines are decreased sharply.<br>
FIGs. 15a, 15b illustrate signal flows according to the operation of the car signal transmitting repeater 103 which relays the signal transmission between the elevator controller 101 and the car controllers 110A, 111 A, having the signal transmission devices.<br>
After inputting an initial power supply, the microprocessor mounted on the car signal<br>
34<br><br>
transmitting repeater 103 accomplishes an initialization process step according to the program stored in ROM, receives the signal transmitted from the elevator controller 101 to the car controllers 110A, 111A, and transmits the received information of car controllers 110A, 111A to the elevator controller 101(step301-step303).<br>
Generally, an information of a transmission period of time received from between the elevator controller 101 and the car controiler 110A is periodically accomplished by the elevator controller 101 at every predetermined period of time, the received information is transmitted to the car controllers 110A, 111A commonly as a D signal shown in FIG. 14c.<br>
A transmission type of the D signal which is the same as FIG. 14c, always changes the signal value at every period of time for a specified period of time successively (for example, increase 1 successively from 11 to FF) in a check data field and so detects a validity of signal which is the transmission period of time from the car controllers 110A, 111A to the elevator controller 101. And the transmission type of the D signal writes number of a valid data of field in a data size field, and transmits a type of an ID of each signal type after adding a control data in an actual controlled data, in which the ID determines the type of a data.<br>
By giving a number which is from 0 to 255 with the type of the ID, it is classified a kinds of overall 256, and is flexible about the signal variation and addition according to this, an example of giving the ID is described hereinto;<br>
No. 0-10: a signal of lighting lamp for a destination floor call registration of a traveling operating panel for a general.<br>
No. 11-20: a signal of lighting lamp  for a destination floor call registration of a traveling operating panel for a handicapped.<br>

No. 71-80: character information transmitted as VMD(Visual Message Display).<br>
Accordingly, the ID and the data content are commonly transmitted to the car controllers 110A, 111A coupled in a common transmission line 104 at the same time, in which the ID can recognize the type of the signals according to a generated signal of each period of time, and the car controllers 110A, 111A output to outer devices by inputting an ID data only in accordance with the predetermined individual ID according to the individual ID given of each traveling operating panel which is one or a plurality, after receiving the signals.<br>
After identifying whether there is an information received from the car controllers 110A, 111A(step305), if so, the received information is edited to data type for transmitting the individual information according to the car controllers 110A, 111A to the elevator controller 101(step306) and a series of process(step302-step306) is accomplished repeatedly like above-described.<br>
Besides a series of process(step302-step306) above, after identifying an event which receives the signal from the car controllers 110A, 111A(ST301), if so, the received information is stored in the internal memory(ST302).<br>
On the other hand, a signal flow about the transacting of the car controllers 110A,<br>
36<br><br>
111A will be illustrated by referring FIGs. 16a, 16b.<br>
In case of inputting an initial power supply, the car controllers 110A, 111A accomplish the initialization process according to the program stored in an internal ROM, and identify whether it is a period of time to transmit the signal to the elevator controller 101. The car controllers 110A, 111A transmit the signal inputted from the car traveling operating panels 110C, 111C and from the same car devices in case that it is time to transmit, and reset the data transmission start timer for next transmission(step401 -step404).<br>
Then the car controllers 110A, 111A identify whether there is a signal received from the elevator controller 101, if so, identify whether there is an ID which is processed from an individual ID among the received information. After identifying, in case that the ID exists, the car controllers 110A, 111A output the corresponding received information to a car outer device(step405-step407).<br>
The output signals are a traveling direction lamp information, a car position display information, an information for displaying the driving state(for example, a checking lamp, an indicating full lamp, and an emergency driving lamp), and a lamp control signal for a destination floor call registration of a traveling operating panel.<br>
The received information from car devices is edited to a data type for transmitting the signal to the elevator controller 101(step408) and a series of process is accomplished repeatedly like above-described(step402-step408).<br>
Besides a series of process(step402-step408) above, after identifying an event which receives the signals from the elevator controller 101(ST401), if so, the received information is stored in the internal memory(ST402), and the signals drive the data<br>
37<br><br>
transmission start timer which decides the time for transmitting itseif(ST403).<br>
Sending/receiving timing relation between the car signal transmitting repeater 103 and the car controllers 110A, 111A will be described by referring FIG. 14.<br>
An individual information and a common information which are transmitted from the car signal transmitting repeater 103 to the respective car controllers 110A, 111A are sorted to a format of each signal type, and the sorted signals are set the ID which can be processed by the respective car controllers 110A, 111A by being given a series of numbers of each signal type.<br>
Accordingly, the car controllers 110A, 111A identify whether the corresponding ID of a signal type is or not after receiving the signal transmitted periodically from the elevator controller 101, input and process the corresponding signal only. So the signal transmitted from the elevator controller 101 periodically is accomplished by always being mixed with the individual information of each car controller and a common information. Since this process is accomplished, it is possible to transmit the signal by only 1 transmission transaction, so a transmission period of time is applied efficiently.<br>
When the car controllers 110A, 111A transmit the signals received from the car devices after receiving the information from the elevator controller 101, the car controllers 110A, 111A set an operating time of a data transmission start timer of each ID set in the car controllers 110A, 111A, and transmit at the timing of the timer operation, separately. In other words, shown in FIG. 14b the signals transmitted from the car controllers 110A, 111A to the elevator controller 101 are transmitted in an order of 1C, 2C, 3C, and 4C having the time difference evenly. Therefore, several car controllers transmit the signals separately via the common transmission line 104, also a probability generating the data<br>
38<br><br>
collision on the common transmission line is decreased, it is to improve a reliability of the communication consequently.<br>
In addition, because the signals of respective devices are already sorted with the ID of each signal type in order to recognize the signal type of each respective control device of the 1C, 2C, 3C, and 4C, it is not difficult to determine whether the signal transmitted to the elevator controller 101 is transmitted from one of which the car controllers.<br>
And a validity of the sending/receiving signal between the elevator controller 101 and the car controllers 110A, 111A at every period of time, by transmitting conversely a check data content transmitted from the elevator controller 101 in transmission period of time on a check data field. A reliability of sending/receiving signal is guaranteed, and may protect the data damage by an outer noise, by retransmitting data received at previous period of time when a damage is occurred on the check data in the next period of time.<br>
Consequently, using the above described the signal transmission methods, the signals may be transmitted nevertheless a skyscraper, an express elevator without particular restraint, a fast answering and a quick error detection are guaranteed, and a proper answer is expected in a desired period of time when any information needed among the devices at every period of time is sent/received. A reliability of sending/receiving signal is guaranteed as well.<br>
For example, an information byte number of a signal data format of each port in FIG. 4 is a data number set by supposing a case that a probability which a call may be simultaneously generated from a floor in the period of time is 4 floors, when the data is sent/received using 80ms period of time between the elevator controller 101 and the<br>
39<br><br>
respective floor controllers 107A-109A. Therefore, a modification about the information byte number may alter without any limitation according to the building's situation, and character.<br>
On the other hand, the transaction of the car signal transmitting repeater 103 or the hall signal transmitting repeater 102, the floor controllers 107A, 109A, and the car controllers 110A, 111A are further illustrated by referring FIGs. 17-19,<br>
First, similar to the process in FIG. 17, the hall signal transmitting repeater 102 or the car signal transmitting repeater 103 has an one-chip micro-computer 504 which is comprising of devices of an EEPROM 504E storing an information for a serial signal transmission, a RAM 504F for an operating space which is needed for working program, a serial transmission interface 504B, a drive 504C and a receiver 504D for sending/receiving a serial signal, a parallel signal interface 504G for parallel interfaces with outer devices and a CPU 504A, and the micro-computer 504 has a configuration connected with outer EPROM 501 having an application program via a bus 503. And the micro-computer 504 may send/receive the signal by connecting with a CPU 101A of the elevator controller 101 via a duel-port RAM 502, and send/receive with the devices in the floor or the car devices by connecting with the common transmission lines 507A, 507B via a wave shaping circuit 505 and a pulse transformer 506.<br>
Accordingly, a button answering signal and a driving state signal received from the elevator controller 101 is successively output via a serial transmission interface 504B and a drive 504C in the micro-computer 504, is successively transmitted to each floor controller or the car controllers via the wave shaping circuit 505, and the pulse transformer 506.<br>
Additionally, the call button signal and the switch input signal transmitted from the<br>
40<br><br>
floor controllers 107A-109A or the car controllers 110A, 111A are transmitted to the CPU 101A of the elevator controller through the routine.<br>
On the other hand, in FIG. 18, the floor controllers 107A-109A have an one-chip micro-computer 605 which is comprising devices of an EEPROM 605E stored an information for a serial signal transmission, a RAM 605F for an operating space which is needed for program working, a serial transmission interface 605B, a drive 605C and a receiver 605D for sending/receiving a serial signal, and a parallel signal interface 605G for parallel interface with outer devices, and the micro-computer 605 has a configuration connected with an outer EPROM 601 stored an application program via a bus 604, a RAM 602 for a working space which stores the calculation result during the application program is working, and a parallel input/output port 603 for inputting/outputting signal with the outer devices. And the micro-computer 605 is indirectly connected with the hall signal transmitting repeater and the elevator controller 101 via the wave shaping circuit 606, the pulse transformer 607, and the common transmission lines 608A, 608B.<br>
Accordingly, a hall call signal input via the hall call button device 107C is successively output as a serial signal via a parallel signal interface 605G and a serial transmission interface 605B in the one-chip micro-computer 605, and a drive 605C, and then is successively transmitted to the elevator controller via the wave shaping circuit 606, the pulse transformer 607, and the serial transmission lines 608A, 608B as well.<br>
Additionally, after the call answering signal transmitted from the elevator controller 101 is transmitted to the hall call button device 107C through the routine, and the button lamp of the hall call button device 107C is lighting-up. The driving state signal, such as a traveling direction lamp displaying information, a car position displaying information, and<br>
41<br><br>
so on, transmitted from the elevator controller 101 is transmitted to the car position indicator 107B via the bus 604, and a parallel input/output port 603, so the customers who are waiting for an elevator on a floor can know a driving situation of the current elevator. On the other hand, in FIG. 19 the car controllers 110A, 111A have a micro-computer 705 which is comprising devices of an EEPROM 705E stored an information for a serial signal transmission, a RAM 705F for a working space which is needed for program working, a serial transmission interface 705B, a drive 705C and a receiver 705D for sending/receiving a serial signal, and a parallel signal interface 705G for parallel interface with outer devices, and the micro-computer 705 has a configuration connected with an outer EPROM 702 stored an application program via a bus 704, a RAM 701 for a working space which stores the calculation result during the application program is working, and a parallel input/output port 703 for inputting/outputting signal with the outer devices, respectively.<br>
The micro-computer 705 transmits the call signal to the elevator controller 101 via the serial signal transmission line 708A, 708B after receiving the call signal from a car traveling operating panel 110C via the parallel input/output port 703, and transmits the call answering signal and driving state signal which are received from the elevator controller 101, for example, a traveling direction lamp displaying information, a car position display information, to the car traveling operating panel 110C and the car indicator 110B via the parallel input/output port 703.<br>
The transmission line for transmitting signals between the floor controllers and the objects from the elevator controller and the transmission line for the signal transmission with the car devices are independently installed, respectively. And the common information<br>
42<br><br>
is always transmitted to the respective devices via the transmission lines at every predetermined period of time, a signal from the floor devices or the car devices is only received, and the answering signal is only sent to the floor or the car devices which correspond to the received signal at predetermined transmission period of time according to the invention. By transmitting these signals, quick answering is acquired in the skyscraper and an express elevator. In addition, the quick answering is acquired in case that the control information for transmission to the outer devices and any information are transmitted, since the occurred signals are selectively processed according to the elevator usage situation. And when the elevator controller communicates serially with the plurality of floor controllers, the elevator controller does not communicate with the respective floor controller, but transmits the common information and the individual information. Therefore, there is an effect to send/receive lots of information quickly in an express elevator providing a sophisticated function or high quality without adding the extra devices.<br>
