				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a single-mode optical fiber (hereinafter referred to as S-mode optical fiber) used for transmitting light in long-haul optical communications or the like and, in particular, to a dispersion-shifted fiber suitable for wavelength-multiplexing transmission. Related Background Art<br>
Conventionally, optical communication systems employing a S-mode optical fiber as their transmission line have often utilized light in the wavelength band of 1.3 ^m or 1.55 ^m as their signal light for communications.  Recently, in order to reduce transmission loss in the transmission line, the light in the wavelength band of 1.55 ym has been in use more and more.  The S-mode optical fiber employed in such a transmission line for light in the wavelength band of 1.55 pm (hereinafter referred to as 1.55-^m S-mode optical fiber) has been designed such that its wavelength dispersion (phenomenon in which pulse wave spreads due to the fact that velocity of propagation of light changes depending on its wavelength) is nullified (namely, to yield a dispersion-shifted fiber whose<br>
zero-dispersion wavelength is  1.55  ^m).     For  example, as  such a  dispersion-shifted  fiber,   Japanese Patent Publication No.   3-18161   discloses  a dispersion-shifted fiber having a dual-shape core type refractive index profile  in which a core  is constituted by an  inner core layer and an outer core  layer having a refractive index lower  than that of  the   inner core layer.     Further, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.   63-43107  and No.   2-141704  propose  a  dispersion-shifted fiber having a  depressed cladding/dual-shape  core type refractive index  profile  in which,   in  addition to  the double core structure mentioned above,   a cladding is constituted by an  inner  cladding   layer  and .an   outer cladding  layer having  a   refractive index  higher  than that of  the  inner cladding  layer.<br>
On the other  hand,   long-haul  light transmission has  recently  become possible with  the advent  of wavelength division multiplex   (WDM)  transmission and optical  amplifiers.     Under  such circumstances,   however, influences of nonlinear optical  effects cannot be neglected.     Accordingly,   in order  to eliminate the nonlinear optical  effects,   it   has  been proposed to deform the refractive  index profiles mentioned above, thereby  shifting  their zero-dispersion wavelength toward the shorter or  longer wavelength side of their signal wavelength band   (Japanese Patent Application<br>
Laid-Open No. 7-168046 and U.S. Patent No. 5,483,612). Here, a nonlinear optical effect is a phenomenon in which a signal light pulse is distorted in proportion to density of light intensity or the like.  This phenomenon becomes a factor restricting transmission speed, as well as a relay distance in a relaying transmission system.<br>
SUMMARY QF THE INVENTION<br>
As a result of studies concerning the above-mentioned prior art, the inventors have discovered the following problems. Namely, in the above-mentioned dispersion-shifted fibers proposed for wavelength division multiplex transmission, the zero-dispersion wavelength is set to a level different from the wavelength level of signal wavelength band so as to restrain nonlinear optical effects from occurring, while their effective core cross-sectional area A9tf is set on the order of 55 pm2.  Though the conventional dispersion-shifted fibers for wavelength division multiplex transmission are sufficient for the conventional applications, it may be difficult for the prior art to keep a suitable transmission quality in the conventional transmission distance in view of further advance in wavelength multiplexing which will occur as communications become more sophisticated.<br>
Here, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application<br>
Laid-Open No. 8-248251, effective core cross-sectional area Aeff is given by the following expression: <br>
(Figure Remove)wherein E is an electric field accompanying propagated light, and r is a radial distance from a core center.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a dispersion-shifted fiber which can effectively, restrain the nonlinear optical, effects from occurring, and is suitable for long-haul light transmission.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a dispersion-shifted fiber having a zero-dispersion wavelength out of a wavelength band of 1.53 to 1.56 urn and having:<br>
a dispersion level of 1.0 to 4.5 ps/nm/km in terms of<br>
a<br>
absolute value at a wavelength of 1,550 nm;<br>
a dispersion slope not greater than 0.13 ps/nm2/km in terms of absolute value at the wavelength of 1,550 nm;<br>
an effective area not less than 70 urn2 at the wavelength of 1,550 run;<br>
a transmission loss not greater than 0.25 db/km with respect to light in a 1.55-um wavelength band; and<br>
a cutoff wavelength of 1.5 to 2.2 um at a length of 2m.<br>
The invention also provides a dispersion-shifted fiber having a zero-dispersion wavelength out of a wavelength band of 1.53 to 1.56 um and having:<br>
a dispersion level of 1.0 to 4.5 ps/nm/km in terms of<br>
i<br>
absolute value at a wavelength of 1550 nm;<br>
a dispersion slope not greater than 0.13 ps/nm2/km in<br>
terms of absolute value, an effective core cross-sectional area Aa££ of 70 fjm2 or more, and a transmission loss not greater than 0.25 dB/km with respect to light in a wavelength band of 1.55 ^ra.<br>
Here, when the dispersion level in terms of absolute value is smaller than 1.0 ps/nm/km, waveform distortion caused by four-wave mixing, unstable modulation, and the like cannot practically be neglected in long-haul light transmission over 20 km or more.  When the dispersion level in terms of absolute value is greater than 4.5 ps/nm/km, by contrast, waveform distortion caused by wavelength dispersion and by self phase modulation cannot practically be neglected in long-haul light transmission over 20 km or more.<br>
In the dispersion-shifted fiber according to the present invention, the absolute value of dispersion slope is not greater than 0.13 ps/nmVkm.  Accordingly, it is possible to transmit signal lights in which the variation in the amount of waveform distortion due to the dispersion wavelength in signal lights is effectively decreased.<br>
The amount of nonlinear optical effects generated is in proportion to nonlinear optical effect constant (N2/Aaff).  Accordingly, at the same propagating light condition, nonlinear optical effects^ are effectively<br>
restrained from occurring when the nonlinear optical effect constant (N2/Aa£1.) is made smaller.  On the other hand, since nonlinear refractive index N2 is substantially defined by a main material of the optical fiber, it is difficult for the optical fiber made of the same main material to change the nonlinear refractive index N2 from its conventional level so as to restrain the nonlinear optical effects from occurring.<br>
Therefore, in the dispersion-shifted fiber according to the present invention, the effective core cross-sectional area Aaft is increased to 70 ;jm2 or greater, thereby the amount of nonlinear optical effects generated becomes, smaller than that of the conventional dispersion-shifted fiber by at least 20%.<br>
Fig. 1 is a graph showing a relationship between effective core cross-sectional area Aa£t and nonlinear optical constant (N2/Aa£1.) in a dispersion-shifted fiber having a typical composition.  From Fig. 1, it can be seen- that nonlinear optical constant (N2/Aaf£), which is 5.8 x 10~l° (1/W) when effective core cross-sectional area Aa£C is 55 /jm2, becomes 4.6 x 10"10 (1/W) when effective core cross-sectional area ABtt is 70 /jm3, thus being reduced by about 20%.  Accordingly, as compared with the conventional dispersion-shifted fiber, the dispersion-shifted fiber according to the present invention can increase the degree of wavelength<br>
multiplexing in signal light.<br>
In general, refractive index N of a medium under strong light changes depending on light intensity. Accordingly, the minimum order of effect on refractive index N is expressed by:<br>
N = N0 + N2 • E2<br>
wherein N0 is a linear refractive index, N2 is a nonlinear refractive index, and E is a field amplitude. Namely, under strong light, the refractive index N of the medium is given by the sum of N0 and an increase which is in proportion to the square of field amplitude E.  In particular, the constant of proportion N2 (unit: mVv2) in the second term is known as nonlinear refractive index.  Since the distortion in signal light pulse is mainly influenced by, of nonlinear refractive indices, the nonlinear refractive index in the second term, nonlinear refractive index in this specification mainly refers to this second-order nonlinear refractive index.<br>
Also, in the dispersion-shifted fiber according to the present invention, since its incident signal light power can be increased by about 20% (about 1 dB) as compared with the conventional dispersion-shifted fiber, signal light can be transmitted over a transmission distance longer than that of the conventional fiber by 5 km when transmission loss is<br>
assumed to be 0.2 dB/km.  As a result, in the case where the conventional repeater spacing is 50 km, for example, the number of repeaters can be reduced by about 10%.<br>
Further, the dispersion-shifted fiber according to the present invention has a bending loss of 0.5 dB/turn or less when bent at a diameter of 32 mm. Here, the bending loss is measured in a state where a fiber to be measured is wound around a mandrel having a diameter of 32 mm, and a value thus obtained is expressed per turn.<br>
In general, the greater is effective core cross-sectional area Aa££, the higher becomes the density of light intensity on the outer periphery side, thus yielding a greater bending loss.  An optical fiber with a greater bending loss generates a greater optical loss due to the bending inevitably generated by cable-forming step, cable-laying step, excess-length processing upon connection, and the like.  The dispersion-shifted fiber according to the present invention has a bending loss of 0.5 dB/turn or less when bent at a diameter of 32 mm, thereby effectively suppressing the optical loss caused by the bending generated at the cable-forming step or the like. Preferably, in the dispersion-shifted fiber according to the present invention, the absolute value of dispersion slope is 0.09 ps/nmVkm or more.  The<br>
smaller the dispersion slope is, the less becomes the variation in the amount of waveform distortion caused by wavelength dispersion in the signal lights.  On the other hand, the smaller the dispersion slope is, the more likely satisfied is a phase-matching condition for generating the four-wave mixing that is one of nonlinear optical phenomena.  Therefore, in the dispersion-shifted fiber according to the present invention, the absolute value of dispersion slope is preferably at least 0.09 ps/nmVkm but not greater than 0.13 ps/nmVkm, so as to restrain not only the variation in the amount of waveform distortion caused by wavelength dispersion, but also the occurrence of the four-wave mixing, while the signal lights are transmitted.<br>
In order to realize the foregoing characteristics, the dispersion-shifted fiber according to the present invention can be realized by dual-shape core type or segmented-core type refractive index profile.  Both refractive index profiles have a depressed cladding structure.<br>
Here, a first embodiment of the dispersion-shifted fiber according to the present invention has a depressed cladding/dual-shape core type refractive index profile.  The first embodiment of the dispersion-shifted fiber comprises an inner core having a<br>
predetermined refractive index and an outside diameter of 2a; an outer core, disposed around the outer periphery of the inner core, having a refractive index lower than that of the inner core and an outside diameter of 2b; an inner cladding, disposed around the outer periphery of the outer core, having a refractive index lower than that of the outer core; and an outer cladding, disposed around the outer periphery of the inner cladding, having a refractive index higher than that of the inner cladding.<br>
According to the findings obtained by the inventors as a result of studies, when effective core cross-sectional area hott is increased in a dispersion-shifted fiber having a simple dual-shape core type refractive index profile without a depression cladding structure, namely, non-depressed cladding/dual-shape core type refractive index profile, in a state where its absolute value of dispersion is set to 1.0 to 4.5 ps/nm/km at the wavelength of 1,550 nm, its cutoff wavelength becomes shorter, and its bending loss increases.  Even when the refractive index profile is adjusted to increase the cutoff wavelength in order to reduce the bending loss, due to the restriction that the cutoff wavelength must not exceed the signal light wavelength, the bending loss can not sufficiently be ameliorated.<br>
Also,   according  to the   findings of the  inventors, when the bending  loss  of  a dispersion-shifted fiber having a  depressed cladding/dual-shape core type refractive  index  is   lower than  that of a dispersion-shifted   fiber   having  a  simple  dual-shape core type refractive index.     Accordingly,  an optical  fiber (having  a  depressed cladding/dual-shape core  type refractive  index  profile)   employing the configuration mentioned above can  favorably  realize the  foregoing various  characteristics,   and suppress the bending loss to  a predetermined  level  or  lower.<br>
Preferably,   the  first  embodiment of the dispersion-shifted  fiber  satisfies  the following relationships:<br>
a/b   s  0.15	(1)<br>
0\8%  <. an1></.>
0.12%5An2^0.30%	(3)<br>
An3/An2 ^   0.95	(4)<br>
wherein  An: is a  relative refractive index difference of the  inner core with  respect  to the inner cladding,  An2 is   a  relative  refractive  index difference of  the outer core with  respect   to  the  inner cladding,   and An3  is   a relative refractive  index difference of the outer cladding with respect to the  inner cladding.<br>
The  dispersion-shifted   fiber' satisfying these relationships  can   favorably  realize the foregoing<br>
various characteristics, and allows its absolute value of dispersion slope to become at least 0.09 ps/nm2/km but not larger than 0.13 ps/nn\2/km.<br>
Here, ^he relative refractive index difference Ar^ of the inner core with respect to the inner cladding, relative refractive index difference An2 of the outer core with respect to the inner cladding, and relative refractive index difference An., of the outer cladding with respect to the inner cladding are respectively defined as follows:<br>
An, = (nt2 -n32)/(2ni2) (5) An2 = (n22 -n3')/(2n22) (6) An, = (n
wherein n, is the refractive index of the inner core, n2 is the refractive index of the outer core, n3 is the refractive index of the inner cladding, and n4 is the refracti.ve index of the outer cladding.  In this specification, each relative refractive index difference is expressed in terms of percentage.<br>
Preferably, the first embodiment of the dispersion-shifted fiber further satisfies the following relationship:<br>
1.2s c/b 
wherein 2c is an outside diameter of the inner cladding.<br>
The above relationship is preferable in view of<br>
the fact that, in the first embodiment of the dispersion-shifted fiber, the bending-loss-reducing effect, which is generated by the existence of the inner cladding, can not sufficiently be yielded when the inner cladding is too thin.  On the other hand, when the inner cladding is too thick, it functions in a way similar to a normal cladding and fails to yield the cutoff-wavelength-shortening effect of the depressed cladding type refractive index.  When the dispersion-shifted fiber satisfies the relationship of c/b &gt; 1.2, the bending loss in the case where it is bent at a diameter of 32 nun can become 0.5 dB/turn or less.<br>
On the other hand, as the first embodiment of the dispersion-shifted fiber satisfies the relationship of c/b <: its cutoff wavelength can favorably be made shorter thereby making it easy to secure a range of signal light which allows single-mode transmission.></:>
Next, a-second embodiment of the dispersion-shifted fiber according to the present invention has a depressed cladding/segmented-core type refractive index profile.  The second embodiment of the disp'ersion-shifted fiber comprises an inner core having a predetermined refractive index and an outside diameter of 2a; an intermediate core, disposed around the outer periphery of the inner core, having a refractive index<br>
lower than that of the inner core and an outside diameter of 2b; an outer core, disposed around the outer periphery of the intermediate core, having a refractive index higher than that of the intermediate core and an outside diameter of 2c; an inner cladding, disposed around the outer periphery of the outer core, having a refractive index lower than that of the outer core; and an outer cladding, disposed around the outer periphery of the inner cladding, having a refractive index higher than that of the inner cladding. Preferably, the second embodiment of the dispersion-shifted fiber satisfies the following relationships:<br>

wherein Ant is a relative refractive index difference of said inner core with respect to said inner cladding, An2 is a relative refractive index difference of said intermediate core with respect to said inner cladding, An3 is a relative refractive index difference of said outer core with respect to said inner cladding, and An, is a relative refractive index difference of said outer cladding with respect to said inner cladding.<br>
The  above-relationships   (9)   and  (10)   are conditions  to  satisfy  the   effective core cross-section area Aatf  of  70 /jm2.    The relative refractive index difference A^ of  said  inner core with respect to said inner cladding is     preferably 0.5  %  or more  in order  to satisfy   the condition  that  the dispersion  level   in terras  of   absolute value  falls within  1.0  to  4.5 ps/nm/km.     Further,  when  the relative  index  difference An:   is   1.1   %  or  less,   the   dispersion  slope at wavelength of   1,550   nm  falls  within  a  range of  0.09  to  0.13 ps /nmVkm.     The value   (An3   -  An2   )   should be  0.2   %  or more in  order to   satisfy  the condition that  the  bending loss when  bent at  a diameter of   32 mm becomes   0.5' dB/turn  or  less,   and  it should be 0.7  %  or less  in order to  make cutoff wavelength at a length of  2 m set 2 .2  juki or  less.      The  relationship  (13)   is  a  condition to   restrain the  transmission loss with respect to light in  a 1.55-jjm wavelength band so as not to exceed 0.25 dB/km.<br>
Further,   the  second  embodiment  of  the dispersion-shifted   fiber satisfies  the following relationship:<br>
1.2  *   d/c  
wherein   2d is an outside diameter of the inner cladding.<br>
The bending  loss when bent at a diameter of  32  mm becomes   0.5  dB/Jcm or  less  when   (d/c)   is  not  less  than<br>
1.2, and the reducing effect of the cut off wavelength becomes saturated when (d/c) exceeds 3.5.<br>
The present invention will be more fully understood from the detailed description given hereinbelow and the accompanying drawings, which are given by way of illustration only and are not to be considered as limiting the present invention.<br>

In Fig. 4, the outside"diameter 2a of the inner core 110, outside diameter 2b of the outer core 120, relative refractive index difference A^ of the inner core 110 with respect to the inner cladding 210, and relative refractive index difference An2 of the outer core 120 with respect to the inner cladding 210 are changed so as to satisfy that (a/b) is 0.13 and Aaf£ is 80 pm2.  It can be seen from Fig. 4 that |d| is equal to or larger<br>
than 1.0 ps/nra/km when Anx exceeds 0.8%, and that |d| is equal to or smaller than 4.5 ps/nm/km when Ant is approximately 1.2%.<br>
Fig. 5 is a graph showing a relationship between the relative refractive index difference Ant of the inner core 110 with respect to the inner cladding 210 and dispersion slope.  In Fig. 5, the outside diameter 2a of the inner core 110, outside diameter 2b of the outer core 120, relative refractive index difference An: of the inner core 110 with respect to the inner cladding 210, and relative refractive index difference An2 of the outer core 120 with respect to the inner cladding 210 are changed so as to satisfy 0.13 of (a/b), 80 pm2 of Aaff, 0.1 dB/turn of bending loss when bent at a diameter of 32 mm, and 1,580 nm of zero-dispersion wavelength.  It can be seen from Fig. 5 that the dispersion slope becomes 0.13 ps/nm2/]cm or more when ADj is equal to or greater than 1.2%.<br>
Fig. 6 is a graph showing a relationship between the relative refractive index difference An2 of the outer core 120 with respect to the inner cladding 210 and bending loss generated when bent at a diameter of 32 mm.  In Fig. 6, the outside diameter 2a of the inner core 110, outside diameter 2b of the outer core 120, and relative refractive index difference An2 of the outer core 120 with respect to the inner cladding 210<br>

It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the bending loss upon bending at a diameter of 32 mm is 0.5 dB/turn or less when An2 is equal to or greater than 0.12%.  Here, the bending loss is measured as a fiber to be measured is wound around a mandrel having a diameter of 32 mm by a predetermined number of turns (e.g., 100 turns), and is given by a value obtained when thus measured value is expressed per turn.<br>
Fig. 7 is a graph showing a relationship between the relative refractive index difference An2 of the outer core 120 with respect to the inner cladding 210 and cutoff wavelength at a reference length of 2 m.  In Fig. 7, the outside diameter 2a of the inner core 110, outside diameter 2b of the outer core 120, relative refractive index difference An2 of the outer core 120 with respect to the inner cladding 210, and relative refractive index difference An3 of the outer, cladding 220 with respect to the inner cladding 210.are changed so as to satisfy that &amp;nl is 1.0% in thev;;inner core 110<br>
•*<br>
with respect to the inner  cladding -210,   (a/b)   is  0.13, hatt  is   80  pm2,   zero-dispersion wavelength  is   1,580  nm, and An3/An2   is   0 . 8 .<br>
Normally/   cutoff  wavelength Xc of an optical  fiber is  measured according   to a   bending process  performed  at a length of 2 m,  which  is  recommended by CCITT-G.650. When  a  S-mode optical   fiber   has   a length L of  2  m,   the cutoff wavelength  Ac,   as  the  lowest wavelength  allowing single-mode transmission,   coincides with the result of the  above-mentioned measurement.     It  has been, known that,   as  the  length L   increases,   the cutoff wavelength Xc changes  according to the   following expression   (15):<br>
ML)   =  M^o  =  2   m)  -   0.184   x  iog10(L/L0) (15)<br>
(see  T.   Kato et  al.,   QECC'96 Technical  Digestf   July 1966,   Makuhari Messe,   pp.   160-161).<br>
On  the other  hand,   the dispersion-shifted  fiber according to the present  invention  is  assumed to transmit   signal   light   having a  wavelength   in  the  band of  1.55  /jm over a  long distance of 20  km or more. Consequently,   it  is necessary for the cutoff wavelength XC(L0)   at  a  length of   2 m to  satisfy  the following expression   (16) :<br>
AC(L)   5   1.5   +  0.732   t^m]   -   2.2  pm	(16)<br>
From Fig.   7,   it   can be seen that  the  cutoff wavelength AC(L0)   is  equal   to or less  than  2.2  ^m at  a length of  2  m when An2    0.30%.<br>
Fig.   8  is  a  graph showing  a relationship between value   (An,/An2)   and transmission loss.     In Fig.   8,   the<br>
relative refractive index difference An: of the outer<br>
cladding 220 with respect to the inner cladding 210 is<br>
changed under the following conditions:<br>
relative refractive index difference An5 = 1.0%;<br>
relative refractive index difference An2 = 0.20%; and<br>
(a/b) = 0.13.<br>
It can be seen from Fig. 8 that transmission loss<br>
drastically increases beyond 0.25 dB/km when (An3/An2)<br>
is greater than 0.95.<br>
Fig. 9 is a graph showing a relationship between value (c/b) and bending loss at a diameter of 32 mm. In Fig. 9, the outside diameter 2c of the inner cladding 210 is changed under the following conditions: relative refractive index difference Anx = 1.0%; relative refractive index difference An2 = 0.20%; relative refractive index difference An3 = 0.12%; radius a = 2.1 pm; and radius b is 16.0 pm.<br>
It can be seen from Fig. 9 that the bending loss generated when bent at a diameter of 32 mm drastically increases beyond 0.5 dB/turn when (c/b) does not exceed 1.2.<br>
Fig. 10 is a graph showing a relationship between value (c/b) and cutoff wavelength at a length of 2 m. In Fig. 10, the outside diameter 2c of the inner cladding 210 is changed under the following conditions:<br>
relative refractive index difference An: = 1.0%; relative refractive index difference An2 = 0.20%; relative refractive index difference An3 = 0.12%; radius a = 2.1 ^m; and radius b = 16.0 )jm.<br>
It can be seen from Fig. 10 that the effect on lowering cutoff wavelength is saturated when (c/b) does not exceed 3.5.<br>
Namely, when the dispersion-shifted fiber according to the present invention has a depressed cladding/dual-shape core type refractive index profile, it satisfies the following relationships:<br>
a/b 
0.8% 
0.12% <. an2></.>
An3/An2

diameter of 32 mm.<br>
Thus, favorably realized is a dispersion-shifted fiber which can effectively restrain nonlinear optical effects from occurring and is suitable for long-haul light transmission.<br>
On the other hand, without being restricted to the foregoing dispersion-shifted fiber having a depressed cladding/dual-shape core type refractive index profile, the present invention can be embodied in various manners.  For example, the dispersion-shifted fiber can be applied to a dispersion-shifted fiber having a segmented-core type refractive index profile as follows.<br>
The dispersion-shifted fiber having a segmented-core type refractive index profile comprises an inner core having a predetermined refractive index and an outside diameter of 2a; an intermediate core, disposed around the outer periphery of the inner core, having a refractive index lower than that of the inner core and an outside diameter of 2b; an outer core, disposed around the outer periphery of the intermediate core, having a refractive index higher than that of the intermediate core and an outside diameter of 2c; an inner cladding, disposed around the outer periphery of the outer core, having a refractive index lower than that of the outer core and an outside diameter of 2d;<br>
and an outer cladding, disposed around the outer periphery of the inner cladding, having a refractive index higher than that of the inner cladding.<br>
Accordingly, the dispersion-shifted fiber having the above-mentioned various characteristics should satisfy the following relationships:<br>
a/c 
b/c &gt; 0.60	(10)<br>
0.5% ^ Anj 
0.2% 
An4/An3 
1.2 
wherein Ant is a relative refractive index difference of said inner core with respect to said inner cladding, An2 is a relative refractive index difference of said intermediate core with respect to said inner cladding, An3 is a relative refractive index difference of said outer core with respect to said inner cladding, and An4 is a relative .refractive index difference of said outer cladding with respect to said inner cladding, wherein 2d is an outside diameter of the inner cladding.<br>
Here, in the segmented-core type refractive index profile, the relative refractive index difference of each glass region with respect to the inner cladding is defined as follows:<br>
Anx = (nx2 -ncld2)/(2nx2)<br>
x=l,2,3,4<br>
wherein nx is the refractive index of the inner core, n2 is the refractive index of the intermediate core, n3 is the refractive index of the outer core, and n4 is the refractive index of the outer cladding.<br>
Fig. 11 is a view showing a cross-sectional configuration of a first typical example (dual-shape core type) of a dispersion-shifted fiber according to the present invention and its refractive index profile. As shown in Fig. 11, the dispersion-shifted fiber 200 has a depressed cladding/dual-shape core type refractive index profile 201 and comprises an inner core 111 having an outside diameter of 4.2 ^m; an outer core 121, disposed around the outer periphery of the inner core 111, having an outside diameter 2b of 32 /jm; an inner cladding 211, disposed around the outer periphery of the outer core 121, having an outside diameter 2c of 63 pm; and an outer cladding 221 disposed around the outer periphery of the inner cladding 211.<br>
Also, the first embodiment of the dispersion-<br>
shifted fiber 200 satisfies the above-mentioned s<br>
relational expressions (1) to (4) and (8) as fpilows :<br>
a/b = 0.13 
0.8% 
0.12% 
An, = 0.12%<br>
An3Mn2 = 0.6 
1.2 
Further, characteristics of the first embodiment of the dispersion-shifted fiber measured at the wavelength of 1,500 nm are as follows:<br>
zero-dispersion wavelength = 1,585 nm;<br>
dispersion level at 1,550 nm = -3.8 ps/nm/km;<br>
dispersion slope = 0.111 ps/nm2/km;<br>
effective core cross-sectional area Aat£ = 78.2 ^m;<br>
cutoff wavelength = 1.59 jjn\;<br>
bending loss =0.1 dB/turn when bent at a diameter of 32 mm; and<br>
transmission loss = 0.21 dB/km.<br>
Next, Fig. 12 is a view showing a cross-sectional configuration of a second embodiment of the dispersion-shifted fiber according to the present invention and its refractive index profile.  As shown in Fig. 12, the second embodiment of the dispersion-shifted fiber 300 has a segmented-core type refractive index profile and comprises an inner core 301 having an outside diameter 2a. of 7.0 /jm; an intermediate core 302, disposed around the outer periphery of the inner core 301, having an outside diameter 2b of 13.4 pm; an outer core 303, disposed around the outer periphery of the intermediate<br>
core 302, having an outside diameter 2c of 19.2 pm; an inner cladding 304, disposed around the outer periphery of the outer core 303, having an outside diameter 2d of 38.4 pro; and an outer cladding 305 disposed around the outer periphery of the inner cladding 304.<br>
Also, the second embodiment of the dispersion-shifted fiber 300 satisfies the above-mentioned relational expressions (9) to (14) as follows: a/c = 0.36  0.60 0.5% 
Also, the depressed cladding/segmented-core type refractive index profile can be modified in various manners as shown in Figs. 13 and 14. For example, Fig. 13 shows a first application of the depressed cladding/segmented-core type refractive index profile at the condition that the refractive index of the intermediate core 302 is higher than that of the inner cladding 304 (An2 &gt; 0), and Fig. 14 shows a second application of the depressed cladding/segmented-core type refractive index profile at the condition that the refractive index of the intermediate core 302 is lower than that of the inner cladding 304 (An2 
Further, characteristics of the second embodiment of the dispersion-shifted fiber measured at the wavelength of 1,550 nm are as follows:<br>
zero-dispersion wavelength = 1,567 nm;<br>
dispersion level at 1,550 nm = -1.8 ps/nm/km;<br>
dispersion slope = 0.110 ps/nmj/km;<br>
effective core cross-sectional area Aa4f = 81.8 /jm;<br>
cutoff wavelength = 1.74 ^m;<br>
bending loss = 0.1 dB/turn when bent at a diameter of 32 mm; and<br>
transmission loss =0.21 dB/km.<br>
As explained in detail in the foregoing, in the dispersion-shifted fiber according to the present invention, its zero-dispersion wavelength does not exist at least within the wavelength range of 1.53 to 1.56 urn, while its effective core cross-sectional area is set to 70 fjiR2 or greater, nonlinear optical effects are effectively restrained from occurring. Accordingly, it is possible to favorably realize a dispersion-shifted fiber, suitable for long-haul light transmission, which can effectively restrain the -<br>
nonlinear optical effects from occurring.      <br>
.. J/ Also, as the dispersion-shifted fiber according to<br>
the present invention has a configuration -a<br>
depressed cladding/dual-shape core type refractive<br>
index profile or a segmented-core type refractive index<br>
profile, it can reduce bending loss and favourably realise the aimed dispersion-shifted fiber.<br>
From the invention thus described, it will be obvious that the implementation of the invention may be varied in many ways.
