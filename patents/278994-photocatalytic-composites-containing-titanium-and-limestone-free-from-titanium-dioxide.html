Title: "Photocatalytic composites containing titanium and limestone free from<br>
titanium dioxide"<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention concerns the field of photocatalytic materials used for<br>
decontamination from environmental pollutants, and for preserving the<br>
original colour of articles of manufacture exposed to said pollutants, with<br>
application in particular in the field of cement.<br>
State of the art<br>
The use of titanium dioxide in the form of anatase as photocatalyst in<br>
cement compositions is widely known. The resulting compositions are<br>
exploited to make various construction elements and articles of manufacture<br>
endowed with photocatalytic properties, capable of decomposing<br>
environmental pollutants in presence of light and oxygen. In these<br>
compositions titanium dioxide can be dispersed in bulk with the remaining<br>
components (WO-A-9805601, to the Applicant); alternatively, firstly a cement<br>
base free from titanium dioxide is formed, and then it is externally coated<br>
with titanium dioxide, optionally mixed with binders and/or adhesives of<br>
various types. In all these cases the titanium-containing photocatalyst is<br>
present in the form of a mere physical mixture with the mineral components<br>
of the cement composition. The interaction that is established in these cases<br>
is of the mechanical or weakly electrostatic kind, and thus there is no<br>
adequate continuity between photocatalyst and rest of the mixture. This can<br>
lead to various problems linked to inadequate interpenetration of the<br>
photocatalytic components and of those constituting the inert material. The<br>
close interaction between photocatalyst and mineral elements of the cement<br>
is however important for an effective photocatalytic action: indeed, in<br>
photocatalytic cements the cement component is known to simultaneously<br>
absorb atmospheric pollutants through a process of rapid dynamic<br>
equilibrium with the environment (adsorption/desorption): the pollutant<br>
temporarily adsorbed is then decomposed by the photocatalyst. However, in<br>
known products the adsorbent part and the photocatalytic part are clearly<br>
distinct: in this situation a part of the adsorbed pollutant can be desorbed<br>
 <br>
before the photocatalyst is able to act sufficiently, with the consequence of<br>
an insufficient level of photocatalysis.<br>
In an attempt to improve the degree of interaction between photocatalytic<br>
part and inert part, some materials have been proposed in which the<br>
titanium dioxide is supported on mineral components. An example of these<br>
products is titanium dioxide supported on metakaolin, described in patent<br>
application MI2007A002387, to the Applicant. However, as also highlighted<br>
in the aforementioned application in reference to various supports, the<br>
reactivity of the titanium dioxide varies greatly depending on the support,<br>
and the properties of the resulting product are extremely variable and often<br>
unsatisfactory.<br>
A high-performance photocatalytic is particularly desirable in the case of<br>
cement materials, characterised by a very low cost/weight ratio: for these<br>
materials, any increase in production costs linked to the addition of fine<br>
additives reflects greatly on said ratio, risking to make the end product<br>
unmarketable.<br>
In particular, titanium dioxide has a significantly high cost. It may therefore<br>
be useful to have composite materials that are free from titanium dioxide,<br>
and that despite this have a photocatalytic effect equal to or greater than<br>
that provided by titanium dioxide.<br>
Currently the need for photocatalytic composites that meet the<br>
aforementioned requirements is largely unfulfilled.<br>
Calcium titanate is a material with properties of refractoriness, chemical<br>
resistance and of a semi-conductor. It is found in nature in various forms<br>
(e.g. perovskite) characterised by a mixture of phases with different ratios<br>
between calcium and titanium, e.g. CaTiO3, Ca3Ti2O7, Ca4Ti3O10, CaTi4O9,<br>
Ca3Ti2O5, Ca2TiO4, CaTi204(OH)2, etc. It can be prepared via dry or wet route.<br>
Dry preparation is generally carried out by reacting titanium oxide and<br>
calcium carbonate at temperatures greater than 1300°C. (Izv. Akad. Nauk<br>
USSR-Neorg. Mater., 11 (1975) 1622). Wet preparation can be carried out in<br>
different ways, e.g. hydrothermically by heating an aqueous suspension of<br>
titanyl oxalate and a hydrated titanium gel to 150-200°C in an autoclave<br>
(T.R.N. Kutty and R. Vivekanandam, Mater. Lett., 5 (1987) 79-83). It is also<br>
 <br>
known to obtain calcium titanate via peroxide route by treating an aqueous<br>
calcium chloride and titanium chloride solution with hydrogen peroxide and<br>
ammonia, and subsequently calcining the precipitate obtained. (Pfaff,<br>
J.Eur.Ceram.Soc.,9,1992,293-299).<br>
Mixtures of cement and titanates have occasionally been described. For<br>
example JP20002 26248 describes cement mixtures with good flame and acid<br>
resistance containing a ceramic powder that includes potassium titanate<br>
and titanium dioxide.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
A new photocatalytic composite has now been identified in which the<br>
titanium is tightly and stably integrated with a mineral currently used in the<br>
field of cement, which is limestone. The composite is obtained by reacting a<br>
precursor of titanium dioxide with limestone in basic solution, recovering the<br>
product in particular conditions, drying it and calcining the solid obtained.<br>
The composite, obtained by operating in presence of sodium, contains<br>
limestone and calcium titanate, the latter characterised by two crystalline<br>
phases not known until now (herein characterised and referred to as CT2<br>
and CT5). The composite thus obtained, which can be used as such or in<br>
mixture with other components, has shown an unexpectedly high<br>
photocatalytic activity.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The photocatalytic composite object of the invention comprises limestone<br>
and calcium titanate; the latter is present in part in the known form of<br>
perovskite (traces) and in part in the form of two new crystalline phases,<br>
herein identified here and characterised for the first time, referred to as CT2<br>
and CT5.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention by calcium titanate in crystalline<br>
phase CT2 it is meant a crystalline chemical compound containing calcium<br>
and titanium, present in molar ratio 1:2, having empirical formula CaTi20s,<br>
identified by the characteristic diffraction peaks: (002) d(interplanar<br>
distance)=4,959; (210-202) d=2,890; (013) d=2,762 and (310-122) d=2,138.<br>
These peaks are indexed with an orthorhombic cell having the following<br>
reticular parameters: a=7.1 A, b=5.0 A, c=9.9 A.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention by calcium titanate in crystalline<br>
phase CT5 it is meant a crystalline chemical compound containing calcium<br>
and titanium, present in molar ratio 1:5, having empirical formula<br>
CaTi5011, identified by the characteristic diffraction peaks: (002) d=8,845;<br>
(023) d=4,217; (110) d=3,611 and (006) d=2,948. These peaks are indexed<br>
with an orthorhombic cell having the following reticular parameters: a=3.8 A,<br>
b=12.1 A, c=17.7A.<br>
For the purposes of the present application the crystallographic parameters<br>
for phases CT2 and CT5 herein indicated and claimed are meant to be<br>
variable within a range of about ± 0.5 A for the parameters of the cell a,b,c,<br>
and within a range of about ± 0.05 for the interplanar distances d; similarly,<br>
the calcium: titanium molar ratios indicated above are meant to be variable<br>
by about ± 10%.<br>
The microstructural characteristics of phases CT2 and CT5 are widely<br>
illustrated in the experimental part.<br>
 <br>
In the composites object of the invention, the amounts of calcium titanate in<br>
CT2 phase and in CT5 phase are widely variable: preferably they are present<br>
in similar amounts. In an embodiment of the invention the calcium titanate<br>
is present exclusively in CT2 phase or exclusively in CT5 phase.<br>
The aforementioned calcium titanate in the CT2 and/or CT5 phase<br>
represents per se constitutes a particular embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The limestone used to form the composite is the commercially<br>
available one, preferably in finely divided form, also commercially available<br>
(example source: cava di Tinella (Fasano, Brindisi))<br>
The BET surface area of the composite generally ranges from 1 to 150 m2/g,<br>
with preferred values between 2 and 20 m2/g, e.g. between 5 and 10 m2/g.<br>
The process for obtaining the composites described here constitutes a<br>
further aspect of the invention. It generally comprises reacting limestone and<br>
a precursor of titanium dioxide in a basic solution containing sodium ions.<br>
The reactants can be added into the reactor in indifferent order; preferably<br>
the limestone is contacted first with the basic solution and then with the<br>
precursor. The precursor used is preferably titanyl sulphate. The basic<br>
solution containing sodium ions is preferably an aqueous NaOH solution. In<br>
the process conditions the precursor converts totally into calcium titanate.<br>
Preferably, an amount of precursor is used corresponding to a theoretical<br>
content of Ti02 (i.e. calculated considering a total conversion of the precursor<br>
into Ti02 ) of about 20% by weight with respect to the limestone. The<br>
reaction goes on for a time of between 45 and 90 minutes, at a temperature<br>
ranging from 20 and 80 °C. At the end of the reaction, the resulting solid<br>
product is recovered from the solution, optionally washed, then dried and<br>
calcined. The washing generally takes place with water; it must in any case<br>
be partial, in order not to completely eliminate the sodium residues coming<br>
from the basic solution used. Alternatively, the solid can be completely<br>
washed (or else a basic solution not containing sodium can be used) and<br>
then a sufficient amount of sodium can be introduced, e.g. by dispersing the<br>
solid a suitable aqueous solution having an adequate concentration of<br>
sodium ions. Indeed, it has been observed that in presence of sodium (at<br>
least 0.05% by weight, expressed as Na20 over the dry product), the<br>
precursor of Ti02 used does not convert into Ti02, but it obtains<br>
substantially exclusively calcium titanate; the composite is thus<br>
 <br>
substantially free from titanium dioxide. By "substantially free from" it is<br>
meant a composite in which the titanium dioxide is absent, or else it is<br>
present in amounts not greater than 2% by weight.<br>
The presence of sodium at the end of the washing can be tested through<br>
methods known in the field, e.g. via flame test, X-ray fluorescence and<br>
atomic absorption, etc. In case it is opted not to wash the reaction solid, the<br>
presence of substantial amounts of sodium in the product (deriving from the<br>
initial basic solution) is in any case ensured and does not need to be tested<br>
analytically.<br>
The calcining preferably takes place at a temperature ranging from 300 and<br>
800°C, e.g. between 450 and 700 °C; particularly effective photocatalytic<br>
composites have been obtained by calcining at about 650°C.<br>
Heat treatments below 525°C are less preferable since they need long times<br>
(over 24 hours) for the formation of the desired calcium titanates. The<br>
reaction speed at temperatures of between 550 and 6506C is high.<br>
Temperatures of over 700°C are preferably to be avoided because they cause<br>
the start of limestone decarbonatation..<br>
A further object of the present invention is the photocatalytic composite<br>
obtained through the process described above.<br>
From the point of view of the elemental composition (as detectable by X-ray<br>
fluorescence and atomic absorption), the composites according to the<br>
invention can be further characterised as follows:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
The elemental composition given in the tables refers to the composite as a<br>
whole: such a composite comprises, in addition to calcium titanate,<br>
limestone and residues of the reactants used for the titanate-forming<br>
reaction.. In particular, the analysis confirms the presence of non-negligible<br>
amounts of sodium in the composite, responsible for the complete<br>
conversion of the TIO2 precursor into calcium titanate. Indeed, it has been<br>
observed that composites obtained in a similar way, but carefully washing<br>
the reaction solid until substantially all traces of sodium have been<br>
eliminated (sodium residue below 0.05% by weight, expressed as Na20 over<br>
the dry product), contained substantial amounts of titanium dioxide in<br>
mixture with the calcium titanate: both products derived from the<br>
conversion of the TiOaprecursor ; the group of composites thus obtained has<br>
specific application advantages and is the object of a co-pending application<br>
to the Applicant.<br>
As highlighted by the electron microscopy observations contained in the<br>
experimental part, the calcium titanate in the present composites is in the<br>
form of crystalline grains of a size of about 10-150 microns, closely<br>
connected to limestone grains. There is thus clearly a strong aggregative link<br>
between the photocatalytic portion of the composite (calcium titanate) and<br>
the mineral support component (limestone); within these aggregates, the<br>
calcium titanate crystals in phase CT2 are generally rounded, whereas those<br>
in phase CT5 generally have a characteristic rod shape.<br>
The present invention represents a successful example of composite material<br>
in which the calcium titanate is closely and stably linked to a support<br>
 <br>
material (limestone) able to be used in the cement field.. The close<br>
interconnection between the photocatalytic and non-photocatalytic parts of<br>
the composite obtains a substantial continuity between absorption sites of<br>
the pollutants and decomposition sites thereof, with the advantage of high<br>
photocatalytic efficiency. Such efficiency has been highlighted by abatement<br>
tests of N-oxides (NOx) and VOC (aromatic hydrocarbons), using the<br>
composite of the invention either as such, or incorporated in bulk in a<br>
cement matrix.<br>
With the present invention a highly integrated multi-phase composite<br>
material has been obtained, free from titanium dioxide, having high<br>
photocatalytic activity, particularly suitable for being incorporated in cement<br>
matrices.<br>
Despite the lack of TiC&gt;2, the "absolute" photocatalytic activity of the<br>
composite (expressed as amount of NO abated) proved unexpectedly similar<br>
to that of equivalent commercial products containing the best known<br>
photocatalyst (anatase titanium dioxide, PC-105, Millenium). The "relative<br>
photocatalytic activity (expressed as ratio between the amount of NO abated<br>
and the total weight of titanium present in the composite) proved to be even<br>
greater than that of similar composites containing the same calcium titanate<br>
and titanium dioxide: there is thus, for the calcium titanate of the invention<br>
and its composites, an intrinsically greater photocatalytic activity than that<br>
of titanium dioxide, the latter up to now considered the photocatalyst of<br>
choice.<br>
A further object of the invention is the use of the photocatalytic composite<br>
described earlier as photocatalytic product as such, or in the preparation of<br>
cements and cement articles of manufacture endowed with photocatalytic<br>
activity. The article of manufacture can contain the composite dispersed in<br>
bulk, or layered on its outer surfaces, as coating: in the latter case the<br>
photocatalytic composite is preferably mixed with suitable tackifiers, used to<br>
promote suitable cohesion between article of manufacture and coating layer.<br>
In any case, the composite is used in amounts such as to obtain a<br>
concentration of composite in bulk preferably ranging from 1% to 15 %,<br>
more preferably between 2% and 10%. The methods for the dispersion in<br>
bulk or for the outer coating are per se widely known in the field in question.<br>
 <br>
An aspect of the invention thus concerns photocatalytic composition, in<br>
particular of the cementitious type, comprising the composite described<br>
above. The further elements of the cement composition are those commonly<br>
known, in particular: various hydraulic binders, optional aggregates and<br>
additives used in the cement field. The hydraulic binders and the aggregates<br>
(defined for example by standards UNI ENV 197.1 and UNI 8520) are<br>
products widely known in the field. The compositions according to the<br>
invention can be provided in fluid state, or else mixed with water (to form<br>
mortars or concretes, depending upon the granule size of the aggregates<br>
used), or else they can be provided in the corresponding forms free from<br>
water (dry premixes). These compositions are used to form photocatalytic<br>
articles of manufacture through suitable casting in moulds and similar<br>
technologies; the resulting articles of manufacture contain the composite of<br>
the invention dispersed in bulk. Alternatively, they can be used as coating<br>
formulations of pre-existing articles of manufacture, preferably co-<br>
formulated with suitable tackifiers.<br>
The invention is illustrated hereafter not for limiting purposes through the<br>
following examples.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL PART<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preparation of the composite (STCA02)<br>
280 g of a commercial calcareous filler (origin: cava Tinella di Brindisi) were<br>
stirred, suspended in 700 ml of a NaOH solution (200g/l in distilled water),<br>
and an aqueous solution of 700 ml of TiOS04 (100g/l di Ti02), so as to have<br>
a theoretical Ti02 content equal to about 20% by weight, was dripped. The<br>
powder obtained was filtered and partially washed with distilled water, thus<br>
keeping a part of the sodium deriving from the NaOH in the solid. The<br>
powder was then dried at 105°C in a ventilated oven. Before performing the<br>
calcining heat treatment at 650 °C for 2 hours, the product was broken up<br>
so as to obtain a powder.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Alternative for the preparation of the composite (STCA02)<br>
 <br>
280 g of a commercial calcareous filler (origin: cava Tinella di Brindisi) were<br>
stirred, suspended in a 2M aqueous solution of NH4HCO3 (slightly in excess<br>
with respect to the titanyl sulphate), and an aqueous solution of 700 ml of<br>
TiOSOt (100g/l of TiCte), so as to have a theoretical content of TIO2 equal to<br>
about 20% by weight, was dripped. The powder obtained was filtered and<br>
completely washed with distilled water. The powder was then dried at 105°C<br>
in a ventilated oven. The solid product was then again dispersed in an<br>
aqueous solution at a known concentration of NaOH (the concentration is<br>
such as to introduce the desired amount of Na, expressed as Na20, over the<br>
solid), and kept agitated until the solution is completely dry. Before<br>
performing the calcining heat treatment at 650 °C for 2 hours, the product<br>
was broken up so as to obtain a powder.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Micro-structural characterisation.<br>
The composite STCA 02 obtained in example 1, subjected to diffractometric<br>
analysis (diffractometer BRUKER D8 Advance and CuKa (Acu= 1.545 A)<br>
radiation, proved to be a polyphase mixture consisting of calcite, traces of<br>
perovskite, and calcium titanate in different crystalline phases. In particular,<br>
the diffraction profile showed the presence of a series of peaks not<br>
attributable to known crystalline phases, which can be referred to two<br>
different phases (CT2 and CT5) that proved to be calcium titanate-containing<br>
compounds with ratios of Ca:Ti 1:2 and 1:5 respectively (see Fig. 1). The<br>
peaks attributable to the two phases are of similar intensity, indicating that<br>
they are present in the composite in comparable amounts.<br>
The accurate position of the peaks of the new crystalline phases was<br>
determined through diffractometric analysis of the sample after elimination<br>
of the calcite by treatment in diluted HC1 (1:10) and subsequent drying at<br>
60°C (Fig. 2).<br>
The observed interplanar distances (d) of the two phases are shown in the<br>
following tables, wherein h,k,l indicate the Miller indices, and °26 indicate<br>
the diffraction angle.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
Microscope analysis.<br>
In order to better understand the nature of the sample, both the sample as<br>
such and the acid residue were subjected to analysis by transmission<br>
electron microscopy (TEM). The observations allowed to establish that the<br>
sample consisted of a mixture of crystals of a few microns of calcium<br>
carbonate and of crystalline micro-nano aggregates (grains) of calcium<br>
titanate and carbonate having variable size from 50 to 300 nm (see Figs. 3<br>
and 4).<br>
Through microanalysis with EDS detector it has been possible to identify two<br>
families of crystals containing both Ca and Ti, one with a characteristic<br>
rounded shape, the other with an elongated shape (Fig. 5, 6). The<br>
semiquantitative analyses made by focussing the electron beam on different<br>
crystals of the first phase have allowed to establish that the Ca:Ti ratio in<br>
this phase, here referred to as CT2, is about 1:2<br>
High-resolution images were carried out on some crystals of this phase with<br>
the corresponding Fourier transforms, from which it has been possible to<br>
extract information on the cell parameters for the CT2 phase:<br>
Orthorhombic: a=7.1 A, b=5.0 A, c=9.9 A.<br>
The extinction conditions observed are the following:<br>
Okl k+l=2n<br>
hhl no cond	(1)<br>
2hhl no cond<br>
hOO h=2n<br>
OkO k=2n	(2)<br>
 <br>
By adding the extinctions (1) and (2) one obtains as possible space group<br>
Pna21 (Herman Mauguin Symbol), corresponding to the space group 33<br>
shown in International Tables of Crystallography, vol. A, "Space Groups<br>
Symmetry", V ed., Kluver Acad. Publ. 2002)<br>
Possible monoclinic distortions can exist and the TEM data obtained cannot<br>
exclude them.<br>
The software used for simultaneously indexing such patterns was QED<br>
(Belletti D., Calestani G., Gemmi M, Migliori A. - QED V 1.0: a software<br>
package for quantitative electron diffraction data treatment<br>
Ultramicroscopy, 81 (2000) pp 57-65).<br>
In light of the information obtained on the cell of this new phase it was<br>
possible to assign some of the peaks not identified in the diffractogram of the<br>
sample STCA06 to the CT2 phase.<br>
The remaining peaks are attributable to a different phase (CT5, see later).<br>
The cell parameters of the CT2 phase have been further refined through<br>
fitting of the calculated diffractometric profile with the real one.<br>
Through microanalyses with EDS detector it has been confirmed that the<br>
family of rounded crystals is conform with CT2 phase, found in the sample of<br>
photocatalytic composite.<br>
Other crystals of characteristic elongated form were found to contain Ca, Ti<br>
and small amounts of Na. This new crystalline phase, characterised by a<br>
Ca:Ti ratio of about 1:5, is referred to here as CT5. Similarly to what was<br>
done for CT2, some high-resolution images were taken, with the<br>
corresponding Fourier transforms from which it has been possible to extract<br>
information on the cell parameters.<br>
The main characteristic of this phase is a periodicity of 17.6 A.<br>
From the simultaneous indexing of such patterns via QED software (Belletti<br>
et al., op.cit.) it has been possible to derive a possible cell for the compound<br>
in question. The cell was orthorhombic C centred:<br>
a=3.8 (10) A, b=12.1 (20) A, c=17.7 (2) A (decimal error)<br>
 <br>
Possible monoclinic distortions can exist and the TEM data obtained cannot<br>
exclude them.<br>
The extinction conditions observed are:<br>
hkl h+k=2n<br>
hkO h+k=2n<br>
Okl not able to be determined<br>
hOl h,l=2n<br>
hOO h=2n<br>
OkO k=2n<br>
001 l=2n<br>
These extinctions are compatible with the following possible space groups:<br>
type C-c-: Cmc21, C2cm, Cmcm (corresponding to the space group 63, cf.<br>
International Tables of Crystallography, vol. A, "Space Groups Symmetry", V<br>
ed., Kluver Acad. Publ. 2002) in the case of extinction Okl k=2n;<br>
type Ccc-:Ccc2, Cccm in the case of extinction Okl k,l=2n.<br>
The cell parameters of the CT5 phase have been further refined through<br>
fitting of the calculated diffractometric profile with the real one.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Analysis of specific BET surface and microporosity.<br>
The values measured during the analysis of the new photocatalytic<br>
composite STCA 02 shown in the table show an increase in the specific<br>
surface of the heat treated product (650'C), with respect to the limestone as<br>
such, with an increase in the non-microporous fraction.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
By working at different temperatures it is also observed that the surface area<br>
generally tends to decrease as the calcining temperature increases.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Photocatalytic activity on cement: NOx abatement measurements.<br>
The composite STCA02 was mixed with white cement (Italbianco 52.5 di<br>
Rezzato) so as to obtain photocatalytic cements with percentage by weight of<br>
photocatalyst within the range 2.0 - 8.5%. NOx abatement analyses were<br>
carried out on cement mortars made with normalised sand CEN (according<br>
to UNI 196-1) by preparing tests in Petri dishes of diameter 8 cm and surface<br>
of about 60 cm2. The results obtained show an excellent behaviour of such<br>
cements, comparable to that of cement containing commercial anatase (Fig.<br>
7).<br>
The abatement values measured on the mortars CEN containing the<br>
composite STCA02 at different concentrations on cement have shown very<br>
good NOx abatement values already at percentages of around 2.5% by<br>
weight. (See Fig. 7)<br>
The photocatalytic activity tends to increase as the calcining temperature of<br>
the sample increases.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Photocatalytic activity on cement: VOC abatement measurements.<br>
The evaluation of the abatement capability of aromatic hydrocarbons was<br>
carried out using the pure photocatalytic products (not mixed with cement)<br>
 <br>
under UV radiation. Ethylbenzene was used as organic substance, using a<br>
flow apparatus typical of tests on catalysts (oxidation of ethylbenzene in air).<br>
In this way the intrinsic activity of the material is determined, disregarding<br>
the diffusive phenomena. The results obtained show an excellent level of<br>
5 abatement activity of the product. It is greater than the best commercial Ti02<br>
(Fig. 8).<br>
