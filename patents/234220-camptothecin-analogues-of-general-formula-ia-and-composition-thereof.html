				<td>Comparative data<br>
In order to illustrate the unexpected effect of compounds of the present invention with silyl radical, please find enclosed experimental results (IC50) extracted from the present invention : compounds of formula I and comprising silyl radical are compared to the very close compounds described in the present invention.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The substitution of a butyl or phenyl radical by a -(CH2)2SiMe3 radical (with the same substituents on the other positions), decreases in an unexpected way the IC50 and thus increases the activity of corresponding Si compounds.<br><br><br><br>
concentrations on the proliferation of tumoral cell colonies, is, unexpectedly, superior to the activity of compounds which are already known. A subject of the invention is also the compounds previously mentioned as medicaments, as well as the pharmaceutical compositions containing them. The invention also relates to a new preparation process for the compounds according to the invention.<br>
Therefore a subject of the invention is the compounds of general formula (I) characterized in that they correspond<br>
either to formula IA<br><br>

In the definitions indicated above, the expression halo represents the fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo radical. By lower alkyl radical is meant in the present application a linear or branched alkyl radical containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms, such as the methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl and tert-butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, hexyl or isohexyl radicals. Among the alkyl radicals containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms, there can be mentioned the lower alkyls as defined above but also the heptyl, octyl, nonyl or decyl radicals. The lower alkoxy radicals can correspond to the alkyl radicals indicated above such as for example the methoxy, ethoxy, propyloxy or isopropyloxy radicals but also linear, secondary or tertiary butoxy.<br>
The term cycloalkyl designates a ring with 3 to 7 carbons, such as for example, the cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl groups. The term lower cycloalkyl alkyl designates the radicals in which respectively the cycloalkyl and lower alkyl are as defined above such as for example cyclohexyl methyl, cyclohexyl ethyl. The term aryl designates a mono- di- or tricyclic hydrocarbon compound with at least one aromatic ring, each ring containing at most 7 members, such as for example phenyl, naphthyl, anthracyl, biphenyl or indenyl. The lower arylalkyl radicals designate the radicals in which respectively the aryl and lower alkyl radicals are as defined above such as for example benzyl, phenethyl or naphthylmethyl.<br>
The term lower hydroxy alkyl refers to radicals in which the alkyl chain can be linear or branched and contain 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The terms lower alkyl amino and lower dialkyl amino preferably designate radicals in which the alkyl radicals are as defined above, such as for example methylamino, ethylamino, dimethylamino, diethylamino or (methyl)(ethyl)amino.<br>

The compounds of formula (I) in which at least one of the R2, R3, R4 and R5 radicals represents a sulphonate (such as for example mesylate, triflate or tosylate), can be obtained by a process characterized in that the corresponding hydroxylated compound in an anhydrous aprotic solvent is treated with a sulphonylating agent in the presence of a base. The aprotic solvent can be dichloromethane or N,N-dimethylformamide, the sulphonylating agent can be methanesulphonyl chloride, triflic anhydride, N-phenyltriflimide or p-toluene sulphonyl chloride, and the base can be triethylamine, pyridine or sodium hydride. The sulphonate group can also be introduced at the level of intermediate products.<br>
The compounds of formula (N), in which and R6 is a hydrogen atom and R2, R3, R4 and R5 have the meaning indicated above, can be obtained from anilines of formula (P)<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
in which R7, R3, R4 and R5 have the meaning indicated above, according to.the following process: an aniline of formula (P) is 7V-acetylated by treatment with an acetylating agent such as, for example, acetic anhydride. The acetanilide thus obtained is treated at a temperature comprised between 50Â°C and 100Â°C, preferably about 75Â°C, with a reagent known to a person skilled in the art under the name Vilsmeyer's reagent (obtained by the action of phosphoryl oxychloride on MA^-dimethylformamide at a temperature comprised between 0Â°C and 10Â°C) to produce the corresponding 2-chloro-3-quinolinecarbaldehyde (for example, refer to Meth-Colin et al. J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans, /p.1520 (1981); Meth-Cohn et al. J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. 7p.2509 (1981); and Nakasimhan et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 112 p.4431 (1990)). This intermediate is easily reduced to the corresponding quinolylmethanol of formula (N), under standard conditions known to a person skilled in the art such as treatment in an alcoholic solvent (for example methanol) with sodium borohydride at a temperature comprised between 0Â°C and 40Â°C.<br>
The compounds of formula (N) in which R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 have the meaning indicated above, can also be obtained from carboxylated quinolones of formula (Q)<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
in which R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 have the meaning indicated above, according to the following process: a quinolone of formula (Q) is chlorinated to produce the corresponding chloroquinoline, the carboxylated function of which is reduced to produce the compound of general formula (N). The chlorination can be carried out with â¢a chlorophosphine oxide such as phosphorus oxychloride or chlorodiphenylphosphine oxide, pure or in the presence of an inert aprotic cosolvent such as toluene or chloroform, at a temperature comprised between 50Â°C and 120Â°C. The chlorination is preferably carried out with an excess of phosphorus oxychloride at 80Â°C. The reduction can be carried out with an aluminium hydride in an aprotic solvent such as diethyl ether, ter/-butylmethyl oxide, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, chloroform, trichloroethane or toluene, at a temperature comprised between 0Â°C and 50Â°C. The reduction is<br><br>
preferably carried out with diisobutylaluminium hydride in dichloromethane at ambient temperature.<br>
The compounds of formula (Q), in which and R6 is a hydrogen atom and R2, R3, R4 and R5 have the meaning indicated above, can be obtained from anthranilic acids of formula<br>
(R)<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
in which R2, R3, R4 and R5 have the meaning indicated above, according to the following process: an acid of formula (R) is reduced to produce the corresponding benzyl alcohol. The alcohol function of the intermediate thus obtained is protected selectively in order to leave the amine function intact. The resulting aniline is acylated with a derivative of malonic acid. The previously protected alcohol function is deprotected, then oxidized to produce the corresponding carbonyl function, and the intermediate thus obtained is subjected to an intermolecular process according to a reaction known to a person skilled in the art under the name of Knovenagel's condensation, to produce carboxylated quinolones of formula (Q), in which and R6 is a hydrogen atom and R2, R3, R4 and R5 have the meaning indicated above. The reduction of the acid to alcohol can be carried out by a metallic hydride in an inert aprotic solvent at a temperature comprised between 0Â°C and 50Â°C, and preferably by a mixed hydride of lithium and aluminium in tetrahydrofuran at ambient temperature. The protection of the intermediate benzyl alcohol can be carried out according to the general methods known to the person skilled in the art (Greene T, et al, "Protective groups in Organic Synthesis", 2nd edition, Wiley, New-York,. 1991) or also with a silyl chloride in the presence of a base, in an aprotic solvent at a temperature comprised between 0Â°C and 50Â°C, and preferably by terf-butyldiphenylsilyl chloride in the presence of imidazole, in dimethylformamide at ambient temperature. Acylation can be carried out with a malonic derivative such as ethylmalonyl chloride or methyl malonate in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or 4-dimethylaminopyridine in an aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran or toluene at a temperature comprised between 0Â°C and<br><br>

Although the prior art mentions the use of a similar reaction for the analogues of camptothecin.es containing an ct-hydroxylactone (Sawada, S., et al., Chem Pharm. Bull, (1991), vol. 39, p. 2574); PCT Application WO 98/35940), its use for the analogues of camptothecines such as the compounds of formula (IV) containing a p-hydroxylactone, has not been foreseen and is unexpected, because in strongly acid medium, a ternary and benzylic hydroxyl function, in position P with regard to a carboxylic function, is generally eliminated to produce the corresponding olefine (Nagasawa, et al. Helerocycles 1989, vol. 28, p. 703; Kimura, H. et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull 1982, vol. 30, p. 552; Fujita, T. et al., J. Appl Chem Biotechnol 1982, vol. 32, p. 421; Miller, R. E., et al., J. Org. Chem. 1950, vol. 15, p. 89; Fieser, L. F., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1948, vol. 70, p. 3209).<br>
In the process above, the strongly acid medium can be provided by acids such as aqueous or non-aqueous trifluoroacetic acid or sulphuric acid and preferably aqueous sulphuric acid, the iron (III) salt will preferably be heptahydrated iron (III) sulphate, the free radical precursor will be an aldehyde of formula R6-CHO in which R6 represents a<br>
linear or branched alkyl radical containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms optionally substituted<br><br>

The solution containing hydroxide or alkoxide radicals can be provided by hydrogen peroxide or tert-butyl hydroperoxide, and preferably by hydrogen peroxide at 30 volumes.<br>
The compounds of the present invention posses useful pharmacological properties. Therefore it follows that the compounds of the present invention have an inhibitory activity on topoisomerase I and/or II and an anti-tumoral activity. The state of the art suggests that the compounds of the invention have an anti-parasitic and/or anti-viral activity. The compounds of the present invention can thus be used in different therapeutic applications.<br>
An illustration of the pharmacological properties of the compounds of the invention will be found hereafter in the experimental part.<br>
The compounds can inhibit topoisomerase, for example of type I and/or II, in a patient, for example a mammal such as man, by administration to this patient of a therapeutically effective quantity of the compounds of the invention.<br>
The compounds of the invention have an anti-tumoral activity. They can be used for the treatment of tumors, for example of tumors expressing a topoisomerase, in a patient by administration to said patient of a therapeutically effective quantity of one of the compounds of the invention. Examples of tumors or cancers include cancers of the oesophagus, the stomach, the intestines, the rectum, the oral cavity, the pharynx, the larynx, the lung, the colon, the breast, the cervix uteri, the corpus endometrium, the ovaries, the prostate, the testicles, the bladder, the kidneys, the liver, the pancreas, the bone, the connective tissues, the skin, for example melanomas, the eyes, the brain and the central nervous system, as well as cancer of the thyroid, leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, lymphomas other than those related to Hodgkin, multiple myelomas and others.<br>
They can also be used for the treatment of parasitic infections by inhibition of the hemoflagellates (for example in trypanosomia or leishmania infections) or by inhibition of the plasmodia (such as for example in malaria), but also the treatment of viral infections or diseases.<br>
These properties make the compounds of the invention suitable for pharmaceutical use. A subject of the present Application is also the compounds of the invention, and in<br><br>
particular the products of general formulae (I), (IIA) or (III) as defined above as medicaments. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one of the medicaments as defined above as an active ingredient.<br>
Therefore the invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing a compound according to the invention or an addition salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid of it, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable support according to the chosen administration method (for example oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, trans-dermic or sub-cutaneous). The pharmaceutical composition (for example therapeutic) can be in the form of a solid, liquid, liposome or lipidic micella.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition can be in solid form, such as for example, powders, pills, granules, tablets, liposomes, gelatin capsules or suppositories. The pill, tablet or gelatin capsule can be covered in a substance which is capable of protecting the composition from the action of gastric acid or enzymes in the stomach of the subject for a sufficient period of time to allow this composition to pass in a non-digested form into the small intestine of the latter. The compound can also be administered locally, for example, at the same location as the tumor. The compound can also be administered according to a sustained release process (for example a sustained release composition or an infusion pump). The appropriate solid supports can be, for example, calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, magnesium carbonate, talc, sugars, lactose, dextrin, starch, gelatin, cellulose, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidine and wax. The pharmaceutical compositions containing a compound according to the invention can also be presented in liquid form such as, for example, solutions, emulsions, suspensions or a sustained release formulation. The appropriate liquid supports can be, for example, water, organic solvents such as glycerol or glycols such as polyethylene glycol, similarly their mixtures, in varied proportions, in water.<br>
A subject of the invention is also the use of the compounds of the invention for the preparation of medicaments intended to inhibit topoisomerases, and more particularly the topoisomerases of type I or of type II, medicaments intended to treat tumors, medicaments intended to treat parasitic infections, as well as medicaments intended to treat viral infections or diseases.<br>
The dose of a compound according to the present invention envisaged for the treatment of the diseases or disorders mentioned above, varies according to the administration method, the age and body weight of the subject as well as the state of the latter and it<br><br>
will be decided definitively by the attending doctor or vet. Such a quantity determined by the attending doctor or vet is here called "effective therapeutic quantity".<br>
Unless defined in another manner, all the technical and scientific terms used here have the same meaning as that commonly understood by an ordinary specialist in the field to which the invention belongs. Similarly, all publications, patent applications, all patents and all other references mentioned here are incorporated by way of reference.<br>

The residue, taken up in a saturated aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate (200 ml), is washed with dichloromethane (2 x 100 ml) and the resulting solution is acidified to pH = 1 with 6 N hydrochloric acid, then extracted with dichloromethane (2 x 200 ml). The combined extracts are dried over magnesium sulphate and concentrated. The solution is dried over magnesium sulphate and concentrated. The racemic acid thus obtained (31.1 g; 90 mmol), taken up in isopropyl alcohol (30 ml), is treated with a quinidine solution (29.2 g; 90 mmol) in isopropyl alcohol (30 ml), and the resulting mixture is agitated at 50Â°C until complete dissolution. The temperature is allowed to reduce to 40Â°C, the agitation is stopped and the reaction medium allowed to cool down to ambient temperature. The medium is taken to 0Â°C without agitation then maintained at this temperature for 16 hours. Then the temperature is allowed to rise to 20Â°C and agitation is carried out until crystallization. The medium is diluted with isopropyl alcohol then filtered. The precipitate is rinsed with isopropyl alcohol. The dextrorotatory salt precipitates whilst the levorotatory salt remains in solution in isopropyl alcohol. The filtrate is recovered which is concentrated to produce the expected product.

'HARMACOLOGICAL STUDY OF THE PRODUCTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
^rocedure.<br>
\denocarcinoma HT29 cells from the human colon are cultured in a single layer at 57Â°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% of air and 5% of CO2, in a modified<br>
essential Earle's medium at 4.5 g/1 (Gibco, Paisley, United Kingdom); completed with 10% of inactivated foetal calf serum, 2 mM of glutamine, and 50 jag/ml of gentamycin (Gibco, Paisley, United Kingdom).<br>
Approximately 2000 cells are seeded with the culture medium above in the wells of a microplate (96 wells, flat-bottomed) and incubated for 24 hours. Solutions in N,N-dimethyl-acetamide (DMA) of each of the examples of the invention, diluted in the culture medium so that the final concentration of DMA is 0.1% (v/v), are added to the plate cultures in order to obtain final concentration ranges from 1x10 to 1 x 10 M, and the cells are incubated for 72 hours.<br>
The WST1 staining reagent, (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) is then added to each well at a final concentration of 9%, and the cells are incubated for 2 hours at 37Â°C. This stage allows the mitochondrial dehydrogenase of the living cells to convert WST1 orange tetrazolium salt into crimson formazan. The resulting stained solutions are quantified by dual-beam detection (450 and 690 nm) using a multi-cuvette scanning spectrophotometer.<br>
Results<br>
The results shown in the following table are expressed in terms of inhibitory concentration at 50% (IC50, in nM), accompanied by a confidence interval. The<br>
inhibitory activities of the adenocarcinoma HT29 cell proliferation of the human colon obtained with the examples of the invention are assessed, these activities being, in an unexpected fashion, superior to the activity of the reference compound described in the PCT Patent Application WO 97/000876 (and corresponding to compound IA in which R! = Et, R2 = R3 - R4 = R5 = H, R&amp; = H).<br>
