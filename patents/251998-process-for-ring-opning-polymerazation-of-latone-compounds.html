				<td>Technical Field [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a process for ring-opening polymerization of lactone compounds using an activated carbon as a catalyst, and to a catalyst for ring- . opening polymerization of lactone compounds. Background Art [0002]<br>
Ring-opening polymerization is a polymerization process in which polymerization proceeds as a result of ring opening of a cyclic compound as a monomer to synthetically yield a polymer.  Industrially important synthetic polymers such as nylons (polyamides), polyesters, polyethers, polyethyleneimines, and polysiloxanes are now produced through ring-opening polymerization. [0003]<br>
In general, a catalyst must be added to a reaction system so as to develop ring-opening polymerization.  The catalyst herein acts upon the cyclic compound and accelerates its ring-opening reaction.  For example, catalysts for cation-reactive monomers such as cyclic ethers,<br>
cyclic formals, and cyclic imines include Lewis acids such as BF3.o(C2H5) 2, SnCl4, and A1C13; alkyl halides such as alkyl chlorides and alkyl bromides; super strong acids such as CF3SO3H; ester's of super strong acids, such as CF3S03R, wherein R represents an alkyl group; and cation salts such as R3C+PF6- and R30+BF4-, wherein R represents an alkyl group. Catalysts for anion-reactive monomers such as cyclic siloxanes, lactams, and acid anhydrides include Li, Na, K, RCOONa, RONa, and R2NLi, wherein R represents an alkyl group. As a catalyst for a fluorooxetane, there is disclosed an alkali metal fluoride supported on a support such as an activated carbon.  In this catalyst, however, the active site is the alkali metal fluoride, and the activated carbon only plays a role as a support (Patent Document 1) . Catalysts for coordinate anion-reactive monomers such as cyclic ethers and lactones include, for example, (C2H5)2Zn-H20, (C2H5)2Zn-ROH, and AlR3-acetylacetone-H20, wherein R represents an alkyl group; and those for metathesis reactive monomers such as cyclic olefins include Mods and WCle. [0004]<br>
However, when these known catalysts are used, 1) side reactions other than polymerization may occur, and/or 2) residual catalysts, if remained in the resulting polymers, may exhibit some toxicitY or may cause deterioration in performance of the polymers.<br>
 [0005]<br>
In contrast, activated carbons have been known to be used as adsorbents and supports for solid catalysts, but have not yet been known to be usable, if used alone, as catalysts for ring-opening polymerization. [0006]<br>

[0021]<br>
[Lactone Compound (a)]<br>

Examples of lactone compounds (a) for use in the present invention include compounds represented by following General Formula (1): [Chemical Formula 2]<br>
 (Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1 represents an alkylene group having two to eighteen carbon atoms, which may be substituted with one or more alkyl groups each having one or more carbon atoms.<br>
[0022]<br>

Likewise, cyclic carbonate compounds such as ethylene carbonate, 1,3-propylene carbonate, neopentyl carbonate, 2-methyl-1,3-propylene carbonate, and 1,4-butanediol carbonate can be used herein. [0023]<br>
The term "ring-opening homopolymerization" in the present invention refers to ring-opening polymerization of one lactone compound (a), and the term "ring-opening copolymerization" refers to ring-opening polymerization of two or more different lactone compounds (a).  Monomers for use in ring-opening copolymerization include, in addition to the lactone compounds (a), oxirane compounds such as<br>
ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, a-olefin epoxides having six to thirty carbon atoms, styrene oxide, glycidol, and epichlorohydrin.<br>
[0024]<br>
[Activated Carbon] Activated carbons for use as catalysts in the present<br>
invention can be articles known as porous carbonaceous absorbents.  These activated carbons can be prepared by carbonizing carbonaceous materials through heat treatment, and activating the carbonized materials.  Examples of such carbonaceous materials include vegetable-derived (plant-derived) natural carbonaceous materials such as coal, cokes, pitch, bone charcoal, vegetable charcoal, coconut shells/wood, sawdust, and lignin; animal-derived natural carbonaceous materials such as beef bones; organic polymers including synthetic resins such as phenolic resins and polyacrylonitriles; and soot. [0025]<br>
Activated carbons for use in the present invention can be either activated carbons themselves or articles partially containing activated carbons.  Such activated carbons can be, for example, an activated carbon supported on a support such as a plastic, a mineral, a ceramic, or a fiber; a granulated article (granules) prepared by granulating a powdered activated carbon with a binder; and a granulated article of a powdered activated carbon with a powder typically of a mineral or a ceramic.  Some materials such as bone charcoal, vegetable charcoal, graphite, and carbon black may structurally partially contain activated carbons.  In this case, these materials can also be used as the articles partially containing activated carbons in the present<br>
invention. [0026]<br>
The specific surface area of an activated carbon for use in the present invention is not specifically limited, as long as being 500 m2/g or more, and is preferably 750 m2/g or more, and more preferably 900 m2/g or more, with its upper limit generally being about 3000 m2/g. [0027]<br>

the trade name of M-30; and a product supplied from Toyobo Co., Ltd. under the trade name of KF-1500.  Examples of sheet-like activated carbons include a product supplied from Kanebo, Ltd. under the trade name of Microlite AC. [0028]<br>
The amount of an activated carbon is not specifically limited but is preferably 0.01 to 10 parts by weight, and more preferably 0.1 to 1 parts by weight, to 100 parts by weight the lactone compounds (a). [0029]<br>
[Active Hydrogen-containing Compound]<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, ring-opening homopolymerization or ring-opening copolymerization with another lactone compound (a) can be carried out using an active hydrogen-containing compound (b) as an initiator.  The "active hydrogen-containing compound (b)" refers to, for example, a compound having one or more of hydroxyl group, carboxyl group, amino group and/or thiol group.<br>
[0030]<br>
Examples of such active hydrogen-containing compounds (b) include water; diols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butanediol, neopentyl glycol, and hexanediol; ether diols as condensates of these; and trifunctional or higher polyhydroxy compounds such as glycerol, trimethylolethane,<br>
trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, and dipentaerythritol.<br>
Products prepared by using these are referred to as<br>
polylactones in the present invention. [0031] The active hydrogen-containing compounds (b) further<br>
include monohydroxy compounds.  Among them, aliphatic,<br>
alicyclic, or aromatic alcohols having one to thirty carbon atoms are preferred, of which aliphatic alcohols are more preferred.  More specific examples thereof include lower alcohols having one or more carbon atoms, and higher alcohols having ten or more carbon atoms.  Products derived from these compounds, if used as active hydrogen-containing compounds (b), are corresponding alcohol esters of polylactones having terminal hydroxyl group.  The use of an aliphatic alcohol, for example, as an active hydrogen-containing compound (b) yields a polylactone aliphatic alkyl ester.<br>
[0032]<br>
The active hydrogen-containing compounds (b) also include monocarboxy or polycarboxy compounds.  Specific examples of such carboxy compounds include lower aliphatic carboxylic acids such as those ranging from formic acid,<br>
t<br>
acetic acid to decanoic acid, polymerizable unsaturated carboxylic acids such as (meth)acrylic acids, and higher aliphatic carboxylic acids such as those ranging from lauric<br>
acid (dodecanoic acid) to stearic acid (octadecanoic acid); aliphatic saturated or polymerizable unsaturated<br>
t<br>
dicarboxylic acids such as maleic acid, succinic acid, and adipic acid; alicyclic dicarboxylic acids such as cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid; aromatic dicarboxylic acids such as phthalic acid and analogues thereof; tricarboxylic acids such as propanetricarboxylic acid, trimellitic acid, and aminotriacetic acid; tetracarboxylic acids such as butanetetracarboxylic acid, pyromellitic acid, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and other polycarboxylic acids.  Products from these compounds, if used as active hydrogen-containing compounds (b), are corresponding carboxylic acid esters of polylactones having terminal carboxyl group.  The use of an aliphatic carboxylic acid, for example, as an active hydrogen-containing compound (b) yields a polylactone aliphatic carboxylic acid ester.<br>
[0033]<br>
The reaction temperature and reaction time of ring-opening polymerization are not specifically limited.  The ring-opening polymerization is carried out at temperatures of, for example, 100°C to 200°C preferably for one hour or longer and more preferably for five hours or longer.<br>
[0034]<br>
A reaction system in ring-opening polymerization contains a cyclic compound as a monomer and an activated<br>
carbon as essential components.  It may further contain, where necessary, one or more solvents as reaction diluents. Examples of such solvents (reaction diluents) include low molecular weight hydrocarbons such as aliphatic hydrocarbons having about four to about twelve carbon atoms; alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane; aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene; chain ethers such as those from dimethyl ether to ethylene glycol dimethyl ether; halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform; ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, and cyclohexanone; amides such as N,N-dimethylformamide; and cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane.<br>
[0035]<br>
A reaction may be carried out according to a batch mode, a semibatch mode, or a continuous mode.  Reactors for use herein include stirred tank reactors; flow reactors such as packed columns; and fluidized bed reactors.  The reaction is preferably carried out according to a procedure, in which an activated carbon as a catalyst is packed in a packed-column reactor to form a catalytic layer, and a lactone compound (a) alone or a mixture of a lactone compound (a) and an active hydrogen-containing compound (b) is allowed to pass<br>
through the catalytic layer.  This procedure not only saves the time and efforts for filtering the catalyst but also<br>
*<br>
enables easy reactivation and drying of a deactivated<br>
catalyst by allowing steam to pass through the catalytic layer.<br>
[0036]<br>
A process for ring-opening polymerization of lactone compounds according to the present invention uses an activated carbon as a catalyst and thereby suppresses side reactions such as dimerization of lactones, as compared with known processes.  In addition, it remarkably suppresses contamination of inorganic elements into products. Accordingly, it can yield lactone-ring-opened polymers having a content of by-produced lactone dimers of 0.1 percent by weight or less, preferably 0.05 percent by weight or less, or yield lactone-ring-opened polymers having contents of residual inorganic elements of each 0.1 ppm by weight or less.  The process according to the present invention can also yield target products which are excellent in properties such as color (hue). EXAMPLES<br>
[0037]<br>
The present invention will be further illustrated with reference to several examples and comparative examples below, which, however, are never intended to limit the scope of the<br>
present invention.  As an activated carbon, Shirasagi A supplied from Japan EnviroChemicals, Ltd. was used. Inorganic elements in target products were quantitatively<br>
determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) emission spectrometry.  The inorganic elements herein are Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Ce, Co, Cu, Cr, Ga, Ge, Fe, Hf, La, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Pd, Sb; Se, Si, Sn, Sr, Ti, V, Zn, and Zr. Lactone dimers were quantitatively determined by gas chromatography.  All percentages and ppm (parts per million) are by weight, unless otherwise specified.<br>
[0038]<br>
EXAMPLE 1:  Preparation Example 1 of Polycaprolactonediol In a 1-liter four-neck flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet tube, a stirrer, a condenser, a temperature controller, and a dropping cylinder were placed 2.0 mol (212.2 g) of diethylene glycol, 6.9 mol (787.8 g) of ε-caprolactone, and 5.0 g of the activated carbon, followed by heating to 180°C. Next, while keeping the reaction temperature to 180°C, a reaction was continued until the ε-caprolactone concentration in the reaction system became less than 0.5 percent by weight.  After cooling, the activated carbon was removed from the reaction system through filtration, to yield about 950 g of a reaction product.<br>
The resulting polycaprolactonediol had an American  Public Health Association (APHA) color index of 20, an acid value of 0.1 KOH-mg/g, a moisture content of 0.02%, a hydroxyl value of 218 KOH-mg/g, a viscosity of 300 mPa.s (40°C) , a lactone dimer content of 0.01%, and contents of<br>
the inorganic elements of each 0.1 ppm or less.<br>
[0039]<br>
EXAMPLE 2:  Preparation Example 1 of Polycaprolactonetriol In a four-neck flask having the same configuration as in Example 1 were placed 1.25 mol (167.7 g) of trimethylolpropane, 7.3 mol (832.3 g) of ε-caprolactone, and 5.0 g of the activated carbon, followed by heating to 180°C. Next, while keeping the reaction temperature to 180°C, a reaction was continued until the lactone compound concentration in the reaction system became less than 0.5 percent by weight.  After cooling, the activated carbon was removed from the reaction system through filtration, to yield about 950 g of a reaction product.<br>
The resulting polycaprolactonetriol had an APHA color index of 15, an acid value of 0.2 KOH-mg/g, a moisture content of 0.02%, a hydroxyl value of 210 KOH-mg/g, a viscosity of 1200 mPa.s (25°C) , a lactone dimer content of 0.02%, and contents of the inorganic elements of each 0.1 ppm or less.<br>
[0040] EXAMPLE 3:  Preparation Example 2 of Polylactonetriol<br>

activated carbon, followed by heating to 180°C.  Next, while keeping the reaction temperature to 180°C, a reaction was carried out until the total content of residual two lactone compounds in the system became 2 percent by weight or less based on the total amount of the two lactone compounds.  Thereafter, the degree of vacuum in the system was gradually raised using a vacuum pump so that the residual two lactone compounds were removed to a total content of the two lactone compounds of 1 percent by weight or less.  After cooling, the activated carbon was removed from the reaction system through filtration, to yield about 950 g of a reaction product.<br>
The resulting polylactonetriol had an APHA color index of 20, an acid value of 0.06 KOH-mg/g, a moisture content of 0.01%, a hydroxyl value of 336 KOH-mg/g, a viscosity of 1120 mPa.s (25°C) , a lactone dimer content of 0.01%, and contents of the inorganic elements of each 0.1 ppm or less.<br>
[0041]<br>
EXAMPLE 4:  Preparation Example 1 of Polylactone Monocarboxylic Acid Ester<br>

followed by heating to 180°C.  Next, while keeping the<br>
reaction temperature to 180°C, a reaction was continued until the concentration of the lactone compounds in the system became less than 0.5 percent by weight based on the total amount of the lactone compounds.  After cooling, the activated carbon was removed from the reaction system through filtration, to yield about 950 g of a reaction product.<br>
The resulting polylactone monocarboxylic acid ester had an APHA color index of 20, an acid value of 27.9 KOH-mg/g, a moisture content of 0.02%, a hydroxyl value of 0.1 KOH-mg/g, a viscosity of 1530 mPa.s (25°C), a lactone dimer content of 0.01%, and contents of the inorganic elements of each 0.1 ppm or less.<br>
[0042]<br>
EXAMPLE 5:  Preparation Example 1 of Polylactone Monohydroxymonocarboxylic Acid Ester<br>
In a four-neck flask having the same configuration as in Example 1 were placed 0.50 mol (150.2 g) of 12-hydroxystearic acid, 4.46 mol (509.9 g) of e-caprolactone, 2.65 mol (339.9 g) of 4-methylcaprolactone, and 5.0 g of the activated carbon, followed by heating to 180°C.  Next, while keeping the reaction temperature to 180°C, a reaction was continued until the concentration of the lactone compounds in the system became less than 0.5 percent by weight based on the total amount of the lactone compounds.  After cooling,<br>
the activated carbon was removed from the reaction system through filtration, to yield about 950 g of a reaction product.<br>
The resulting polylactone monohydfoxymonocarboxylic acid ester had an APHA color index of 20, an acid value of 26.9 KOH-mg/g, a moisture content of 0.02%, a hydroxyl value of 26.3 KOH-mg/g, a viscosity of 2510 mPa.s (25°C) , a lactone dimer content of 0.01%, and contents of the inorganic elements of each 0.1 ppm or less.<br>
[0043]<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1:  Preparation Example 2 of Polylactone Monohydroxymonocarboxylic Acid Ester<br>
In a four-neck flask having the same configuration as Example 1 were placed 0.50 mol (150.2 g) of 12-hydroxystearic acid, 4.46 mol (509.9 g) of e-caprolactone, 2.65 mol (339.9 g) of 4-methylcaprolactone, and 0.01 g of<br>
stannous octoate, followed by heating to 180°C.  Next, while keeping the reaction temperature to 180°C, a reaction was continued until the concentration of the lactone compounds in the system became less than 0.5 percent by weight based on the total amount of the lactone compounds.  After cooling, about 950 g of a reaction product was obtained.<br>
The resulting polylactone monohydroxymonocarboxylic acid ester had an, APHA color index of 50, an acid value of 26.5 KOH-mg/g, a moisture content of 0.04%, a hydroxyl value<br>
of 26.9 KOH-mg/g, a viscosity of 2830 mPa.s (25°C) , a lactone dimer content of 0.18%, a Sn content of 3 ppm, and contents of the inorganic elements other than Sn of each 0.1 ppm or less.<br>
Industrial Applicability <br>
[0044]<br>
According to the present invention, a high-quality target compound can be obtained in a high yield, because an activated carbon used herein has an excellent catalytic activity and thereby suppresses side reactions.  The catalyst can be more easily separated and removed from the target product through filtration and less causes deterioration in safety and performance of the target product than known catalysts.  Accordingly, a process according to the present invention is very excellent as a process for industrially producing ring-opened polymers of lactone compounds.<br><br><br><br><br>
