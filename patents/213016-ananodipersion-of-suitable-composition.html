Use of nanodispersions in pharmaceutical end formulations<br>
The present invention relates to the use of nanodispersions in pharmaceutical end formulations, to pharmaceutical end formulations comprising said nanodispersions and to the different pharmaceutical uses of these end formulations.<br>
Pharmaceutical end formulations are understood here to mean formulations which comprise, in addition to the basic substances responsible for forming the pharmaceutical formulation, other functional active agents. These are added to the pharmaceutical base formulations and can be used for the therapeutic treatment of the nervous system, endocrine system, cardiovascular system, respiratory tract, gastro-intestinal tract, kidneys and efferent urinary tracts, locomotor apparatus, immunological system, skin and mucosae and for the treatment<br>
of infectious diseases.<br>
*<br>
In order for these substances to have an effect at the desired site, they must be transported to the respective site. To optimise their availability at the site of action, many active agents are applied by means of so-called carrier and transport vehicles (carrier systems), for example mixed micelles, liposomes or nanoemulsions (nanoparticles). Examples of such active agents are amphotericin (NeXstar, Sequus, TLC), daunorubicin (NeXstar). doxorubicin (Sequus), inactivated hepatitis A viruses (Berna), or econazol (Cilag). Applying these active agents by means of said carrier systems results in therapeutic advantages such as fewer side-effects or better vaccinal effect.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that so-called nanodispersions of suitable composition can enhance the effectivity of medicinal agents in pharmaceutical end formulations.<br>
Accordingly, this invention relates to the use of a nanodispersion, which comprises<br>
(a)	a membrane-forming molecule,<br>
(b)	a coemulsifier and<br>
(c)	a lipophilic component,<br>
in pharmaceutical end formulations, the nanodispersion being obtainable by (a) mixing the components (a), (b) and (c) until a homogeneous clear liquid is obtained (so-called nanodispersion prephase), and<br><br>
((3) adding the liquid obtained in step (a) to the water phase of the phamaceutical end formulations, steps (a) and (p) being carried out without any additional supply of energy.<br>
Step (a) is usually carried out at room temperature, where necessary with heating and under<br>
normal pressure conditions. Mixing is carried out using standard stirring apparatus, for example propeller, angled paddle or magnetic agitators, and without using any special mechanical stirring aids.<br>
Components (a), (b) and (c) (= step (a)) are mixed in anhydrous medium, i.e. it is not necessary to add any water.<br>
Step (p) is carried out by adding the liquid obtained in step (a), the nanodispersion pre-<br>
phase, to the water phase of the pharmaceutical end formulations. The particular choice of components (a), (b) and (c) results directly in ultrafine, monodisperse nanodispersions. In this case it is possible to forego homogenisation via nozzle, rotor-stator or ultrasound homo-genisers, which is usually carried out to convert coarsely disperse or at least heterodisperse systems to fine monodisperse systems. Step (p) is thus characterised by the absence of high shear or cavitation forces.<br>
Step (p) is usually carried out at room temperature, which is the range of the respective oil/water phase inversion temperature (PIT).<br>
The nanodispersions characterised by the process steps (a) and (P) contain particles having an average diameter of 
It is preferred to use a nanodispersion. which contains,<br>
(a)	as membrane-forming molecules, substances which are suitable for forming so-called bilayers.<br>
(b)	as coemulsifiers, substances which preferably form 0/W structures and,<br>
(c)	as lipophilic component, a lipophilic agent customarily used for pharmaceutical preparations.<br><br>
The nanodispersion preferably contains as component (a) a phospholipid, a hydrated or partially hydrated phospholipid, a lysophospholipid, a ceramide, or mixtures of these compounds,<br><br>
wherein<br>
R1     is C10-C20acyl;<br>
Ra     is hydrogen or C10-C20acyl<br>
R3     is hydrogen, 2-trimethylamino-1-ethyl, 2-amino-1-ethyl; C1-C5alkyI which is unsubsti-<br>
tuted or substituted by one or several carboxy, hydroxy or amino groups; the inositol or<br>
glyceryl group;<br>
or salts of these compounds.<br>
C10-C20Acyl is preferably straight-chain C10-C20alkanoyl containing an even number of carbon atoms and straight-chain C10-C20alkenoyl containing a double bond and an even number of carbon atoms.<br>

Suitable are. for example, naturally occurring cephalin or lecithin, e.g. cephalin or lecithin from soybeans or chicken eggs with different or identical acyl groups, or mixtures thereof.<br><br>
The phospholipid of formula (1) may also be of synthetic origin. The expression "synthetic phospholipid" is used to define phospholipids having uniform composition with respect to Ri and R2. Such synthetic phospholipids are preferably the lecithins and cephalins defined above, wherein the acyl groups Ri and R2 have a defined structure and which are derived from a defined fatty acid having a degree of purity greater than about 95%. Ri and R2 may be identical or different and unsaturated or saturated. Preferably, R1 is saturated, for example n-hexadecanoyi, and R2 is unsaturated, for example 9-cis-octadecenoyl (oleoyl).<br>
The expression "naturally occurring" phospholipid defines a phospholipid that does not have a uniform composition with respect to R1 and R2. Such natural phospholipids are likewise lecithins and cephalins, wherein the acyl groups R1 and R2 are derived from naturally occurring fatty acid mixtures.<br>
The requirement "substantially pure" phospholipid of formula (1) defines a degree of purity of more than 90 % by weight, preferably of more than 95 % by weight of the phospholipid of formula (1), which can be demonstrated by means of suitable determination methods, for example by paper chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, by HPLC or by means of enzymatic colour testing.<br>
In a phospholipid of formula (1), R3 defined as C1-C4alkyl is, for example, methyl or ethyl. Methyl is preferred.<br>
R3 defined as C1-CsalkyI substituted by one or several carboxy, hydroxy or amino groups is, for example. 2-hydroxyethyl, 2,3-dihydroxy-n-propyl, carboxymethyl, 1- or 2-carboxyethyl, dicarboxymethyl, 2-carboxy-2-hydroxyethyl or 3-carboxy-2.3-dihydroxy-n-propyl. 3-amino-3-carboxy-n-propyl or 2-amino-2-carboxy-n-propyl, preferably 2-amino-2-carboxyethyl.<br>
Phospholipids of formula (1) containing these groups can be present in salt form, for example as sodium or potassium salt.<br>
Phospholipids of formula (1), wherein R3 is the inositol or glyceryl group, are known by the names phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol.<br>
The acyl radicals in the phospholipids of formula (1) are also customarily known by the<br><br>
names given in brackets:<br>
9-cis-dodecenoyl (lauroleoyl), 9-cis-tetradecenoyl (myR1stoleoyi), 9-cis-hexadecenoyl (palmi-toleoyl), 6-cis-octadecenoyl (petroseloyl). 6-trans-octadecenoyl (petroselaidoyi), 9-cis-octa-decenoyl (oleoyl), 9-tran3-octadecenoyl (elaidoyl), 9,12-cis-octadecadienoyl (linoleoyl), 9,12,15-cis-octadecatR1enoyl (linolenoyl), 11-cis-octadecenoyi (vaccenoyi), 9-cis-eicosenoyl (gadoleoyi), 5,8,11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoyl (arachidonoyi). n-dodecanoyi (lauroyl), n-tetra-decanoyl (myR1stoyi), n-hexadecanoyi (palmitoyi), n-octadecanoyi (stearoyi), n-eicosanoyi (arachidoyi), n-docosanoyi (behenoyi), n-tetracosanoyi (lignoceroyl).<br>
A salt of the phospholipid of formula (1) is preferably pharmaceutically acceptable. Salts are defined by the existence of salt-forming groups in the substituent R3 and by the free hydroxyl group at the phosphorus atom. The formation of internal salts is also possible. Alkali metal<br>
salts, especially the sodium salt, are preferred.<br>
»<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of this invention, puR1fied lecithin from soybeans of the quality LIPOID S 100 or S 75, or a lecithin defined in the monograph USP23/NF 18, is used.<br>

polyethoxylated carbon hydrates<br>
block polymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, such as poloxamer 188.<br>
Component (b) is present in the nanodispersion used according to this invention in a concentration of about 1 to about 50 % by weight, based on the total weight of the components (a), (b) and (c).<br><br>
Component (c) is preferably a natural or synthetic or a partially synthetic di- or tR1glyceR1de, a mineral oil, silicone oil, wax, fatty alcohol, guerbet alcohol or the ester thereof, a therapeutic oil, a lipophilic pharmaceutical active agent or a mixture of these substances.<br>
Active agents suitable for pharmaceutical application are to be found, inter alia, in Arznei-mittelkompendium 1997. Examples of suitable active agents are: analgesics, antacids/ulcus treatments, antiallergic agents, antianemic drugs, antidepressants, antidiabetic agents, antidiarrheal agents, antidotes/addiction-combating agents/ emetics, anti-emetics/antivertiginosa, antiepileptic agents, antihemorrhagic agents, antihypertensives, antihypotonic agents, antiinfectives, anticoagulants, antirheumatic agents/ anti-inflammatory agents, appetite depressants, beta blockers, bronchodilators, cholinergic agents, dermatological agents, disinfectants, diagnostic agents, dietetic agents, diuretics, blood flow stimulants, gastroenterological agents, gout remedies, influenza remedies, gynecological agents, antihemorrhoidal agents, hormones, antitussives, hypnotics, immunological agents, intravenous infusions, cardiac remedies, contraceptives, contrast media, adrenocortical steroids, laxatives, liver and gall therapeutic agents, lipid metabolism preparations, local anesthetics, migraine analgesics, mineral metabolism preparations, muscle relaxants, narcotics, neuroleptic agents, odontological agents, ophthalmic agents, otorhinolaryngological agents (ORL), anti-parkinson drugs, psychostimulants, sedatives, spasmolytic agents, tonics/roborants, tranquilisers, anti-tuberculosis drugs, urological agents, preparations for vaR1cose veins, consolidants and zytostatic agents.<br>
Component (c) is present in the nanodispersions used according to this invention in a concentration of preferably 0.1 to 80 % by weight, based on the total weight of components (a), (b) and (c).<br>
The nanodispersion used according to this invention optionally compR1ses as facultative component (d) a solubiliser, preferably a Ca-Caalcohol, such as ethanol or propylene glycol.<br>
A nanodispersion containing the components (a), (b), (c) and optionally (d) is distinguished by favourable phase properties of the solubilised functional pharmaceutical agent. Thus if there is opalescence and transparency in incident light, only a very slight turbidity shows that the dispersion is physically still different from the ideal state of a genuine molecular solution. Electron microscopic images show that a population of more than 98 % is present in a<br><br>
Gaussian distR1bution as a suspension of particles (nanoparticles) having a particle size of less than about 50 nm, typically of less than about 30 nm. However, these distinctions from a genuine solution can be tolerated because of the particularly good homogeneity properties of the dispersion which can be evidenced, for example, by a surpR1singly high storage stability, e.g. no separation after stoR1ng for several months at temperatures of up to room temperature (stability to be expected by extrapolation: more than two years).<br>
Laser light scatteR1ng measurements and electron microscopic analysis (Cryo-TEM) confirm the very small size and excellent homogeneity of the nanoparticles present in the nano-dispersion.<br>
Another advantage of the nanodispersions used according to this invention is that they are easy to prepare.<br>
The nanodispersions characteR1sed by claim 1 are used according to this invention for pharmaceutic end formulations.<br>
This invention also relates to the so-called nanodispersion prephase characteR1sed in step (a), which is obtainable by mixing the components<br>
(a)	membrane-forming molecules,<br>
(b)	coemulsifier,<br>
(c)	lipophilic component and, optionally,<br>
(d)	a Ca-Cealcohol, preferably propylene glycol and, more preferably, ethanol<br>
until a homogeneous clear liquid is obtained, mixing being carR1ed out in anhydrous medium.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the nanodispersion prephase or the nanodispersion is used directly for pharmaceutical end formulations.<br>
The pharmaceutical end formulations are preferably liquid, semisolid or solid preparations.<br>
Examples of liquid pharmaceutical end formulations are injectable solutions, infusion solutions, drops, sprays, aerosols, emulsions, lotions, suspensions, dR1nking solutions, gargles and inhalants.<br><br>
Examples of semisolid pharmaceutical end formulations are ointments, creams (0/W emulsions), R1ch creams (W/0 emulsions), gels, lotions, foams, pastes, suspensions, ovula, plasters, including transdermal systems.<br>
Examples of solid pharmaceutical end formulations are tablets, coated tablets, capsules, granules, effervescent granules, effervescent tablets, lozenges, sucking and chewing tablets, suppositoR1es, implants, lyophilisates, adsorbates or powders.<br>
This invention also relates to these end formulations.<br>
The end formulations contain the nanodispersion in a concentration of 0.01 to 100 by weight, preferably of 0.05 to 20 by weight and, more preferably, of 0.1 to 10 % by weight.<br>
To prepare liquid and semisolid pharmaceutical end products (Examples 20 to 29), the na-nodispersions are incorporated into the aqueous component of the end product. It is also possible to add instead of the nanodispersion the corresponding nanodispersion prephase to the water phase of the pharmaceutical end formulation. The nanodispersion prephase is added to the water phase with stirR1ng and preferably at a temperature in the range of the respective oil/water phase inversion temperature (PIT).<br>
Solid pharmaceutical end products, such as tablets (Example 30). effervescent tablets, coat-ed tablets, granules, effervescent granules and plasters, are coated or loaded with nanodis-persions by spraying or drenching. In certain cases it is advantageous to admix the dehydrated form of the nanodispersion to the solid mixture. The nanodispersion is usually dehydrated by freeze- or spray-drying in the presence of customary excipients. Capsules, in particular elastic gelatin capsules, can also be loaded with the nanodispersion prephase (Example 31).<br>
MatR1x- or membrane-controlled pharmaceutical application systems, such as oros capsules, transdermal systems, injectable microcapsules or implants, are loaded by conventional methods with nanodispersions. Oros capsules can also be loaded with the nanodispersion prephase.<br><br>
In addition to the excipients for providing the pharmaceutical dosage form, the pharmaceutical end formulation can also contain other components, for example stabilisers, preservatives such as parabenes, antioxidants, and aromatics, fragrances or colourants.<br>
The pharmaceutical end formulations are preferably used for the therapeutic treatment of the nervous system, endocR1ne system, cardiovascular system, respiratory tract, gastro-intestinal tract, kidneys and efferent uR1nary tracts, locomotor apparatus, immunological system, skin and mucosae as well as for the treatment of infectious diseases, tumours and vitamin and mineral deficiency diseases.<br>
The novel pharmaceutical end formulation is preferably applied epicutaneously, buccally, lingually, sublingually, enterally (= perorally), rectally, nasally, pulmonally, per inhalationem, conjunctivally, intravaginally, intraurethrally, intracardially, intraarteR1ally, intravenously, intra-lumbally. intrathecally, intraarticularly, intracutaneously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly and intrapeR1toneally.<br>
