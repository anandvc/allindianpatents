				<td>BACKGROUND<br>
Hypoglycemia occurs when blood glucose levels drops too low to provide enough energy for the body's activities. In adults or children older than 10 years, hypoglycemia is uncommon except as a side effect of diabetes treatment, but it can result from other medications or diseases, hormone or enzyme deficiencies, or tumors. When blood glucose begins to fall, glucagon, a hormone produced by the pancreas, signals the liver to break down glycogen and release glucose, causing blood glucose levels to rise toward a normal level. However for diabetics, this glucagon response to hypoglycemia may be impaired, making it harder for glucose levels to return to the normal range.<br>
Hypoglycemia is a life threatening event that requires immediate medical attention. The administration of glucagon is an established medication for treating acute hypoglycemia and it can restore normal levels of glucose within minutes of administration. When glucagon is used in the acute medical treatment of hypoglycemia, a crystalline form of glucagon is solubilized with a dilute acid buffer and the solution is injected intramuscularly. While this treatment is effective, the methodology is cumbersome and dangerous for someone that is semi-conscious. Accordingly, there is a need for a glucagon analog that maintains the biological performance of the parent molecule but is sufficiently soluble and stable, under relevant physiological conditions, that it can be pre-formulated as a solution, ready for injection.<br>
Additionally, diabetics are encouraged to maintain near normal blood glucose levels to delay or prevent microvascular complications. Achievement of this goal usually requires intensive insulin therapy. In striving to achieve this goal, physicians have encountered a substantial increase in the frequency and severity of hypoglycemia in their diabetic patients. Accordingly, improved Pharmaceuticals and methodologies are needed for treating diabetes that are less likely to induce hypoglycemia than current insulin therapies.<br>
As described herein, high potency glucagon agonists are provided that exhibit enhanced biophysical stability and aqueous solubility. These compounds can be used<br>
in accordance with one embodiment to prepare pre-formulated solutions ready for injection to treat hypoglycemia. Alternatively, the glucagon agonists can be co-administered with insulin to buffer the effects of insulin to allow for a more stable maintenance of blood glucose levels. In addition, other beneficial uses of compositions comprising the modified glucagon peptides disclosed herein are described in detail below.<br>

In accordance with one embodiment, applicants have found that introduction of hydrophilic groups at positions 16,17,20, 21,24 and 29 of the native peptide can improve the solubility and stability of the resulting glucagon analog in solutions having a physiological pH. More particularly, in one embodiment the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise one or more hydrophilic groups covalently linked to the side chains of amino acids present at positions 21 and 24 of the glucagon peptide, and in one embodiment the hydrophilic group is PEG. In one embodiment the glucagon peptide comprises a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ED NO: 45 and glucagon agonist derivatives of SEQ ID NO: 45, with the proviso that<br>
when the amino acid at position 21 is Asp the amino acid at position 24 is not Gin, and when the amino acid at position 24 is Gin the amino acid at position 21 is not Asp, wherein one or more hydrophilic groups covalently linked to the side chains of amino acids present at positions 21 and 24 of the glucagon peptide, and in one embodiment the hydrophilic group is PEG.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment, the native glucagon peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 is modified to contain one or more amino acid substitution at positions 16,17, 20,21, 24 and/or 29, wherein the native amino acid is substituted with an amino acid having a side chain suitable for crosslinking with hydrophilic moieties, including for example, PEG. The native peptide can be substituted with a naturally occurring amino acid or a synthetic (non-naturally occurring) amino acid. Synthetic or non-naturally occurring amino acids refer to amino acids that do not naturally occur in vivo but which, nevertheless, can be incorporated into the peptide structures described herein.<br>
In one embodiment, a glucagon agonist is provided wherein the native glucagon peptide sequence has been modified to contain a naturally occurring or synthetic amino acid in at least one of positions 16,17,20, 21,24 and 29 of the native sequence, wherein the amino acid substitute further comprises a hydrophilic moiety.

In accordance with one embodiment the lysine residue at position 12 of the native peptide is substituted with arginine and a single lysine substitution is inserted for the amino acid present at position 16,17, 20,21,24 or 29.  In another embodiment the methionine residue present at position 27 of the native peptide is changed to leucine or norleucine to prevent oxidative degradation of the peptide.<br>

In one embodiment the substitutions at positions 2, 5, 7,10,11,12,13,14,16,17,18,19, 20, 27,28 or 29 are conservative amino acid substitutions. In one embodiment the amino acid present at position 16,17,20,21,24 or 29 of the native peptide is substituted with cysteine or lysine,  However, in one embodiment an amino acid substitution (using a natural or synthetic ammo acid) is made at position 16,17,20, 21,24 or 29, wherein the substitute amino acid allows for the covalent attachment of a PEG chain to the amino acid side chain. In one embodiment the substitution is made at position 21 and/or 24.<br>
In one embodiment an improved glucagon agonist is provided having superior stability and solubility in aqueous solutions at physiological pH. In this embodiment the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise a polyethylene glycol chain linked to an amino acid side chain of an amino acid located at positions 2, 5, 7, 10,11,12, 13,14, 16,17,18,19,20,27,28 or 29 of the native peptide.

General Synthesis Protocol:<br>
Glucagon analogs were synthesized using HBTU-activated "Fast Boc" single coupling starting from 0.2mmole of Boc Thr(OBzl)Pam resin on a modified Applied Biosystem 430 A peptide synthesizer. Boc amino acids and HBTU were obtained from Midwest Biotech (Fishers, IN). Side chain protecting groups used were: Arg(Tos), Asn(Xan), Asp(OcHex), Cys(pMeBzl), His(Bom), Lys(2Cl-Z), Ser(OBzl), Thr(OBzl), Tyr(2Br-Z), and Trp(CHO). The side-chain protecting group on the N-termmal His was Boc.<br>
Each completed peptidyl resin was treated with a solution of 20% piperdine in dimethylformamide to remove the formyl group from the tryptophan. Liquid hydrogen fluoride cleavages were performed in the presence of p-cresol and dimethyl sulfide. The cleavage was run for 1 hour in an ice bath using an HF apparatus (Penninsula Labs). After evaporation of the HF, the residue was suspended in diethyl ether and the solid materials were filtered. Each peptide was extracted into 30-70ml aqueous acetic acid and a diluted aliquot was analyzed by HPLC [Beckman System Gold, 0.46 x 5cm Zorbax C8, 1ml/min, 45C, 214nm, A buffer =0.1%TFA, B=0.1%TFA/90%acetonitrile, gradient of 10% to 80%B over l0min].<br>

The homogeneous fractions were combined and lyophilized to give a product purity of &gt;95%. The correct molecular mass and purity were confirmed using MALDI-mass spectral analysis.<br>
General Pegylation Protocol: (Cys-maleimido)<br>
Typically, the glucagon Cys analog is dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (5-l()mg/ml) and 0.01M ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid is added (10-15% of total volume).
