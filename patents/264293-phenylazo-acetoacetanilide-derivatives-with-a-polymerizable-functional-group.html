PHENYLAZO-ACETOACETANIIlDE DERIVATIVES "WITH A POLYMERISABLE FUNCTIONAL GROUP AND RELATED COMPOUNDS AS MONOMERS FOR PREPARING POLYMERIC PIGMENT DI2PERSANTS FOR INKJET INKS<br>
Technical field<br>
[0001]  The present invention relates to monomers having chromophore groups that exhibit a structural similarity with a colour pigment in a pigment dispersion and a pigmented inches ink.<br>
Background art<br>
[0002] Pigment dispersions are made using a dispersant. A dispersant is a<br>
substance for promoting the conation and stabilization of a dispersion of pigment particles in a dispersion medium. Dispersants are generally surface-active materials having an anionic, cationic or non-ionic structure. The presence of a dispersant substantially reduces the dispersing energy required. Dispersed pigment particles may have a tendency to re-agglomerate after the dispersing operation, due to mutual attraction forces. The use of dispersants also counteracts this re-agglomeration tendency of the pigment particles.<br>
[0003]  The dispersant has to meet particularly high requirements when used for Inkjet inks. Inadequate dispersing manifests itself as increased viscosity in liquid systems, loss of brilliance and/or hue shifts. Moreover, particularly good dispersion of the pigment particles is required to ensure unimpeded passage of the pigment particles through the nozzles of the print head, which are usually only a few micrometers in diameter. In addition, pigment particle agglomeration and the associated blockage of the printer nozzles has to be avoided in the standby periods of the printer.<br>
[0004]   Polymeric dispersants contain in one part of the molecule so-called anchor groups, which adsorb onto the pigments to be dispersed. In a spatially separate part of the molecule, polymeric dispersants have polymer chains sticking out and whereby pigment particles are made compatible with the dispersion medium, i.e. stabilized.<br>
[0005]  The properties of polymeric dispersants depend on both the nature of the monomers and their distribution in the polymer. Polymeric dispersants obtained by randomly polymerizing monomers (e.g. monomers A and B polymerized into ABBAABAB) or by polymerizing alternating monomers<br><br>
(e.g. monomers A and B polymerized into ABABABAB) generally result in a poor dispersion stability, improvements in dispersion stability were obtained using graft copolymer and bloke copolymer dispersants. [0006]  Graft copolymer dispersants consist of a polymeric backbone with side chains attached to the backbone.<br><br>
by polymerizing an addition-polymerizable monomer having an acidic functional group and other addition-polymerizable monomer in the presence of a polymerization initiator, the polymerization initiator being a diazotization product prepared by diazotizing at least one compound<br><br>
selected from the group consisting of an anthraquinone derivative having an aromatic amino group, an acrid one derivative having an aromatic amino group and an organic dyestuff having an aromatic amino group. In this pigment-dispersing agent, the colorant is located in the polymeric<br><br>
phthalocyanine type molecular skeleton which is adsorptive on the pigment and an oligomer unit or polymer unit which prevents re-agglomeration of the pigment to bring out the effect of dispersion are covalently bonded, and having affinity for a medium or a solvent.<br>
[0012]  Consent practice is that the exact or almost the exact chemical structure of the colour pigment is incorporated as the anchor group in the polymeric dispersing agent to assure maximum affinity with the colour pigment. As a consequence, each pigment has its own tailor made polymeric dispersant. In practice, this requires the holding of an inventory of different polymeric dispersants for producing a complete range of colour Inkjet ink sets. The cyan ink with copper phthalocyanine as pigment is a rare exception in that all desired properties are combined in the same pigment. But yellow pigments have to be selected based on the properties that are the most important in their application of Inkjet ink. For example, some yellow pigments are selected for their light stability, while others are selected to obtain images having high colour strength. The holding of such an inventory of different types of polymeric dispersants incurs financial penalties due to additional storage and logistical requirements as well as increasing the possibility of using the "wrong" polymeric dispersant for the production of a particular Inkjet ink.<br>
[0013]  However the synthesis of such polymeric dispersants is complicated since the low solubility of the pigment induces low solubility of the monomer containing the pigment structure.<br>
[0014] For consistent image quality, the inkjet ink requires a dispersion stability capable of dealing with high temperatures (above 60Â°C) during transport of the ink to a customer and changes in the dispersion medium of the<br><br>
inkjet ink during use, for example, evaporation of solvent and increasing<br>
concentrations of humectants, penetrates and other additives. [0015]  Therefore, It is highly desirable to be able to manufacture a range of stable<br>
pigmented inkjet inks using a single polymeric dispersant obtained by<br>
simple synthesis. Objects of the invention [0016]   It is an object of the present invention to provide a monomer for preparing<br>
a polymeric dispersant obtainable by uncomplicated synthesis and suitable<br>
for different colour pigments. [0017]   It is a further object of the present invention to provide inkjet inks with high<br>
dispersion stability. [0018]  It is a further object of the present invention to provide inkjet inks<br>
producing images of high image quality with a high optical density. [0019]  Further objects of the invention will become apparent from the description<br>
hereinafter. Summary of the invention [0020]  It has been surprisingly found that inkjet inks with high optical density and<br>
high stability were obtained using a colored polymeric dispersant wherein<br>
a pending chromophore group exhibits a structural similarity with the<br>
colour pigment, but is smaller in size than the colour pigment. [0021]  Objects of the present invention have been realized with a monomer with a<br>

Pigmented Inkjet ink<br>

[0057]  The pigmented inkjet ink may further contain at least one biocide. [0058] The pigmented inkjet ink may further contain at least one humectants<br>

rate of ink. [0061]  The viscosity of the pigmented inkjet ink is preferably lower than 100<br>
mPa.s, more preferably lower than 30 mPa.s, and most preferably lower<br>
than 15 mPa.s at a shear rate of 100   and a temperature between 20<br>
and 11 OX. [0062]  The pigmented inkjet ink according to the present invention is preferably<br>
an aqueous, a solvent based or an oil based pigmented inkjet ink. [0063]  The pigmented inkjet ink may be curable and may contain monomers,<br>
oligomers and/or prepolymer possessing different degrees of<br>
functionality. A mixture including combinations of mono-, di-, tri-and/or<br><br>
higher functionality monomers, oligomers or prepolymers may be used. The initiator typically initiates the polymerization reaction. A catalyst called an initiator for initiating the polymerization reaction may be included in the curable pigmented Inkjet ink. The initiator can be a thermal initiator, but is preferably a photo-initiator. The photo-initiator requires less energy to activate than the monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers to form the polymer. The photo-initiator suitable for use in the curable fluid may be a Norrish type I initiator, a Norrish type II initiator or a photo-acid generator.<br>
Colour Pigments<br>
[0064]  The colour pigment exhibits a structural similarity with the chromophore group in the monomer according to the present invention but is preferably smaller in size. The chromophore group preferably has a molecular weight which is smaller than 95%, preferably smaller than 90%, preferably smaller than 85%, more preferably smaller than 75% and most preferably smaller<br><br>
63, 81, 83, 87, 113, 121, 124, 152, 170, 171, 172, 174 and 188.<br>
[0067]   Particular prefered pigments are C.I. C. I. Pigment Yellow 1,2, 3, 5, 6, 49. 65, 73, 74, 75, 97, 98, 111, 116, 130 and 213.<br>
[0068]   Particular preened pigments are C.I. Pigment Yellow 120, 151, 154,175, 180,181 and 194.<br>
[0069]   Particular preened pigments are C.I. Pigment Orange 1, 36, 60, 62 and 72.<br>
[0070]  The pigment particles in the pigmented Inkjet ink should be sufficiently small to permit free flow of the ink through the Inkjet printing device, especially at the ejecting nozzles. It is also desirable to use small particles for maximum colour strength and to slow down sedimentation.<br>
[0071]  The average particle size of the pigment in the pigmented inkjet ink should be between 0.005 and 15 pm. Preferably, the average pigment particle size is between 0.005 and 5 pm, more preferably between 0.005 and 1<br><br>
[jm, particularly preferably between 0.005 and 0.3 pm and most preferably between 0.040 and 0.150 [jm. Larger pigment particle sizes may be used as long as the objectives of the present invention are achieved.<br>
[0072]  The pigment is used in the pigmented Inkjet ink in an amount of 0.1 to 20 wt%, preferably 1 to 10 wt% based on the total weight of the pigmented Inkjet ink.<br>
Polymeric dispersants<br>
[0073]  The polymeric dispersant for the pigmented Inkjet ink has a polymeric backbone comprising one or more monomers according to the present invention. The other monomer species constituting the polymeric backbone of the polymeric dispersant are required for the compatibility between polymeric dispersant and dispersion medium. It is not required that the rest of the polymeric backbone has an affinity for the pigment. For example, the rest of the polymeric backbone of a dispersant for aqueous Inkjet inks can be a homopolymer of acrylic acid monomers. A homopolymer is generally incapable of dispersing pigments, but the presence of one or more nonnumeric units with a chromophore group exhibiting a similarity with the pigment ensures an adequate affinity between polymeric dispersant and pigment surface.<br>
[0074] The polymeric backbone can also be a statistical copolymer, a block copolymer, a graft copolymer, a comb polymer or an alternating<br><br>
the pigment surface to enhance certain properties of the inks. e.g. dispersion stability. For example, the polymeric backbone of a dispersant for aqueous Inkjet inks may contain hydrophobic monomers to increase the affinity of the polymeric dispersant for the pigment surface. However in enhancing this affinity for the pigment surface, care should be taken that enough of the polymeric backbone sticks out to make the pigment particles compatible with the dispersion medium.<br><br>
[0075]  Preferably at most 45%, preferably at most 30 % of the monomer units of the polymeric backbone of the polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention have a chromophore group,<br>
[0076]   In graft copolymers the use of grafted chains of methoxypolyethylenegtycoi (MPEG) has been found to be very advantageous in aqueous Inkjet inks. For solvent-based Inkjet inks the use of grafted chains of polyester were found to be very advantageous. A preferred MPEG macro monomer is BISOMERâ¢ MPEG 350MA (methoxypolyethyleneglycol methacrylate) from LAPORTE INDUSTRIES LTD.<br>
[0077]  Preened grafted chains of polyester in non-aqueous Inkjet inks are derived from 5-valerolactone , s-caprolactam and/or C1 to C4 alkyl substituted  -caprolactam. The grafted chains can be introduced Into the polymeric dispersant through GDI coupling of a polyester-OH chain with a carboxylic acid group of, for example, an acrylic acid monomer in the polymeric backbone of the dispersant. However, it was observed that grafting by free radical polymerization, wherein the polyester chain already coupled to the carboxylic acid group of an acrylic acid monomer was used as a macro-monomer, not only resulted in better dispersion quality and stability of the Inkjet inks but also were obtained by a more reproducible polymeric dispersant synthesis requiring less purification.<br>
[0078]  For radiation curable inks with the dispersion medium comprising or<br>
consisting of monomers and/or oligomers, many (co)polymers having good solubility in the dispersion medium are suitable for the polymer backbone of the polymeric dispersant.<br><br>
maleic acid, acryloyloxybenzoic acid and methacryloyloxybenzoic acid (or their salts), maleic anhydride; alkyl(meth)acrylate (linear, branched and cycloalkyl) such as methyl(meth)acrylate, n-butyl(meth)acrylate, tert-butyl(meth)acrylate, cyclohexyl(meth)acrylate and<br><br>
2-ethylhexyl(meth)acrylate; aryl(meth)acrylates such as benzyl(meth)acrylate and phenyl(meth)acrylate; hydroxyalkyl(meth)acrylates such as hydroxyethyl(meth)acrylate and hydroxypropyl(meth)acrylate; (meth)acrylates with other types of functionalities (e.g. oxirane, amino, fluoro, polyethylene oxide, phosphate-substituted) such as glycidyl (meth)acrylate, dimethylaminoethyl(meth)acrylate, trifiuoroethyl acrylate, methoxypolyethyleneglycol (meth)acrylate and<br>
tripropyleneglycol(meth)acrylate phosphate; allyl derivatives such as allyl glycidyl ether; styrenics such as styrene, 4-methylstyrene, 4-hydroxystyrene, and 4-acetoxystyrene; (meth)acrylonitrile; (meth)acrylamides (including N-mono and N,N-disubstituted) such as N-benzyl (meth)acrylamide; maleimides such as N-phenyl maleimide, N-benzyl maleimide and N-ethyl maleimide; vinyl derivatives such as vinylcaprolactam, vinylpyrrolidone, vinylimidazole, vinylnaphthalene and vinyl halides; vinylethers such as vinylmethyl ether; and vinylesters of carboxylic acids such as vinylacetate and vinylbutyrate.<br>
[0081]  The polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention preferably has a polymeric backbone with a polymerization degree DP between 5 and 1000. more preferably between 10 and 500 and most preferably between 10 and 100.<br>
[0082] The polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented inkjet ink preferably has a number average molecular weight Mn between 500 and 30000, more preferably between 1500 and 10000.<br>
[0083]  The polymeric dispersant has preferably a polymeric disparity PD smaller than 2, more preferably smaller than 1.75 and most preferably smaller than 1.5.<br>
[0084]  The polymeric dispersant is used in the pigmented inkjet ink in an amount of 5 to 600 wt%, preferably 10 to 100 wt% based on the weight of the pigment.<br>
Synthesis<br>
[0085]  The polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented inkjet ink is prepared by co polymerization with the monomer according to the present invention.<br><br>
[0086]  The polymerization process may be a condensation polymerization, in<br>
which the chain growth is accompanied by elimination of small molecules such as water or methanol or an addition polymerization, in which the polymer is formed without the loss of other materials. Polymerization of the monomers can be conducted according to any conventional method such as bulk polymerization and semi-continuous polymerization.<br>
[0087]  The synthesis is preferably performed by a controlled radical<br>
polymerization (CRP) technique. Suitable polymerization techniques include ATRP (atom transfer radical polymerization). RAFT (reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization), MADIX (reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer process, using a transfer active xanthate), catalytic chain transfer (e.g. using cobalt complexes), GTP (group transfer polymerization), or nit oxide (e.g. TEMPO) mediated polymerizations.<br>
[0088]   Polymeric dispersants prepared by co polymerizing monomers of the<br>
polymeric backbone and monomers containing a chromophore group were found to have superior properties compared to polymeric dispersants prepared by modification of a (co)polymer with a chromophore having a reactive group. The polymerization method using monomers containing a chromophore group offers the advantage of well-controlled design of polymeric dispersants for a wide variety of dispersion media. Due to its low solubility, a monomer containing the complete colour pigment as a chromophore group poses problems both in the synthesis of the polymeric dispersants, as well as the suitability of the polymeric dispersant for a wide variety of dispersion media and pigments.<br>
Dispersion media<br>

Preparation of pigmented Inkjet inks<br>
[0104] The pigmented Inkjet ink may be prepared by precipitating or milling the pigment in the dispersion medium in the presence of the polymeric dispersant.<br>
[0105]   Mixing apparatuses may include a pressure kneader, an open kneader, a planetary mixer, a dissolver, and a Dalton Universal Mixer. Suitable milling and dispersion apparatuses are a ball mill, a pearl mill, a colloid mill, a<br><br>
high-speed disperser, double rollers, a bead mill, a paint conditioner, and triple rollers. The dispersions may also be prepared using ultrasonic energy.<br>
[0106]  Many different types of materials may be used as milling media, such as glasses, ceramics, metals, and plastics. In a preferred embodiment, the grinding media can comprise particles, preferably substantially spherical in shape, e.g. beads consisting essentially of a polymeric resin or yttrium stabilized zirconium beads.<br>
[0107]   In the process of mixing, milling and dispersion, each process is performed with cooling to prevent build up of heat, and for radiation curable Inkjet inks as much as possible under light conditions in which actinic radiation has been substantially excluded.<br>
[0108] The Inkjet ink may contain more than one pigment, the Inkjet ink may be prepared using separate dispersions for each pigment, or alternatively several pigments may be mixed and co-milled in preparing the dispersion.<br>
[0109] The dispersion process can be carried out in a continuous, batch or semi-batch mode.<br>
[0110] The preferred amounts and ratios of the ingredients of the mill grind will vary widely depending upon the specific materials and the intended applications. The contents of the milling mixture comprise the mill grind and the milling media. The mill grind comprises pigment, polymeric dispersant and a liquid carrier such as water. For Inkjet inks, the pigment is usually present in the mill grind at 1 to 50 wt%, excluding the milling media. The weight ratio of pigment over polymeric dispersant is 20:1 to 1:2.<br>
[0111]  The milling time can vary widely and depends upon the pigment,<br>
mechanical means and residence conditions selected, the initial and desired final particle size, etc. In the present invention pigment dispersions with an average particle size of less than 100 nm may be prepared.<br>
[0112] After milling is completed, the milling media is separated from the milled particulate product (in either a dry or liquid dispersion form) using conventional separation techniques, such as by filtration, sieving through a mesh screen, and the like. Often the sieve is built into the mill, e.g. for a<br><br>
bead mill. The milled pigment concentrate is preferably separated from the milling media by filtration.<br>
[0113]  In general it is desirable to make the Inkjet inks in the fonn of a<br>
concentrated mill grind, which is subsequently diluted to the appropriate concentration for use in the Inkjet printing system. This technique permits preparation of a greater quantity of pigmented ink from the equipment. By dilution, the inkjet ink is adjusted to the desired viscosity, surface tension. colour, hue, saturation density, and print area coverage for the particular application.<br>
Spectral Separation Factor<br>
[0114]  The spectral separation factor SSF was found to be an excellent measure to characterize a pigmented inkjet ink, as it takes into account properties related to light-absorption (e.g. wavelength of maximum absorbance Amax, shape of the absorption spectrum and absorbance-value at Amax) as well as properties related to the dispersion quality and stability,<br>
[0115]  A measurement of the absorbance at a higher wavelength gives an<br>
indication on the shape of the absorption spectrum. The dispersion quality can be evaluated based on the phenomenon of light scattering induced by solid particles in solutions. When measured in transmission, light scattering in pigment inks may be detected as an increased absorbance at higher wavelengths than the absorbance peak of the actual pigment. The dispersion stability can be evaluated by comparing the SSF before and after a heat treatment of e.g. a week at 80Â°C.<br>
[0116]  The spectral separation factor SSF of the ink is calculated by using the data of the recorded spectrum of an ink solution or a jetted image on a substrate and comparing the maximum absorbance to the absorbance at a higher reference wavelength Aret.The spectral separation factor is calculated as the ratio of the maximum absorbance Amax over the absorbance Aret at a reference wavelength.<br><br><br>
[0117] The SSF is an excellent tool to design Inkjet ink sets with large colour<br>
gamut. Often Inkjet ink sets are now commercialized, wherein the different<br>
inks are not sufficiently matched with each other. For example, the<br>
combined absorption of all inks does not give a complete absorption over<br>
the whole visible spectrum, e.g. "gaps" exist between the absorption<br>
spectra of the colorants. Another problem is that one ink might be<br>
absorbing in the range of another ink. The resulting colour gamut of these<br>
Inkjet ink sets is low or mediocre. EXAMPLES Materials [0118]  All materials used in the following examples were readily available from<br>

Measurement methods<br>
1. Measurement of SSF<br>
[0121]  The spectral separation factor SSF of the ink was calculated by using the data of the recorded spectrum of an ink solution and comparing the maximum absorbance to the absorbance at a reference wavelength. The choice of this reference wavelength is dependent on the pigment(s) used:<br><br>
â¢	if the colour ink has a maximum absorbance Amax between 400 and<br>
500 nm then the absorbance Aret must be cletemriined at a reference<br>
wavelength of 600 nm,<br>
â¢	If the colour ink has a maximum absorbance Amax between 500 and<br>
600 nm then the absorbance Aref must be detemnined at a reference<br>
wavelength of 650 nm,<br>
â¢	If the colour ink has a maximum absorbance Amax between 600 and<br>
700 nm then the absorbance Aref must be detennined at a reference<br>
wavelength of 830 nm.<br>
[0122] The absorbance was determined in transmission with a Shimadzu<br>
UV-2101 PC double beam-spectrophotometer. The ink was diluted to have a pigment concentration of 0.002%. In the case of a magenta ink, the ink was diluted to have a pigment concentration of 0.005%. A spectrophotometer measurement of the UV-VIS-NIR absorption spectrum of the diluted ink was performed in transmission-mode with a double beam-spectrophotometer using the settings of Table 5. Quartz cells with a path length of 10 mm were used and water was chosen as a blank.<br><br>
[0123]   Efficient pigmented Inkjet inks exhibiting a narrow absorption spectrum and a high maximum absorbance have a value for SSF of at least 30.<br>
2.	Dispersion stability<br>
[0124]  The dispersion stability was evaluated by comparing the SSF before and after a heat treatment of one week at  . Pigmented Inkjet inks exhibiting good dispersion stability have a SSF after heat treatment still larger than 30.<br>
3.	Polymer analysis<br><br>
[0125]   Unless otherwise specified all polymers have been characterized with gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) using the following methods. Random or block copolymers were analyzed with NMR by dissolving them in a reiterated solvent. For 'H-NMR Â± 20 mg polymer was dissolved in 0.8 mL CDCI3 or DMS0-d6 or acetonitrile-d3 or D2O (with or without NaOD addition). Spectra were recorded on a Varian I nova 400 MHz instrument equipped with an ID-probe. For  -NMR Â± 200 mg polymer was dissolved in 0.8 mL CDCI3 or DMS0-d6 or acetonitrile-d3 or D2O (with or without NaOD addition). Spectra were recorded on a Varian Gemini2000 300 MHz equipped with a SW-probe.<br>
[0126]  Mn, Wand polydispersity (PD) values were detemnined using gel<br>
permeation chromatography. For polymers dissolvable in organic solvents PL-mixed B columns (Polymer Laboratories Ltd) were used with THF+5% acetic acid as mobile phase using polystyrene with known molecular weights as calibration standards. These polymers were dissolved in the mobile phase at a concentration of IM/mL. For polymers dissolvable in water PL Aquagel OH-60, OH-50, OH-40 and/or OH-30 (Polymer Laboratories Ltd) column combinations were used depending on the molecular weight region of the polymers under investigation. As mobile phase water/methanol mixtures adjusted to pH 9.2 with e.g. disodiumhydrogen phosphate were used with or without the addition of neutral salts e.g. sodium nitrate. As calibration standards polyacrylic acids with known molecular weights were used. The polymers were dissolved in either water or water made basic with ammonium hydroxide at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Refractive index detection was used.<br>
[0127]  An example is now given to illustrate the calculation of the average composition of a random (= statistical) copolymer P(MAA-c-EHA). The Mn of the copolymer was determined with GPC to be 5000. The molar percentage of each monomer type by NMR was determined to be: 45 mole% MAA and 55 mole% EHA. Calculation:<br>
(0.45 X MMAA) + (0,55 x MEHA) = 140.09<br><br>
5000 /140.09 = total number of monomer units in average polymer chain = 36<br>
Average number of MAA units = 0.45 x (5000/140.09) = 16 units Average number of EHA units = 0.55 x (5000/140.09) = 20 units Thus, the average composition is P(MAAi6-c-EHA2o).<br>
4.	Particle size<br>
[0128]  The particle size of pigment particles in pigmented inkjet ink was<br>
determined by photon correlation spectroscopy at a wavelength of 633 nm with a 4mW HeNe laser on a diluted sample of the pigmented inkjet ink. The particle size analyzer used was a Malvern'  nano-S available from Goffin-Meyvis.<br>
[0129] The sample was prepared by addition of one drop of ink to a covets containing 1.5 mL water and mixed until a homogenous sample was obtained. The measured particle size is the average value of 3 consecutive measurements consisting of 6 runs of 20 seconds. For good inkjet characteristics (jetting characteristics and print quality) the average particle size of the dispersed particles is preferably below 150 nm.<br>
5.	Calculation of %MW<br>
[0130] The %MW is calculated as the ratio of the molecular weight of the chromophore group over the molecular weight of the colour pigment multiplied by 100.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0131]  This example illustrates that different pigments for inkjet inks can be<br>
dispersed using the same polymeric dispersant prepared with a monomer in accordance with present invention having a smaller chromophore group with a structural similarity to the pigment. The polymeric backbone of the dispersant is a homopolymer, which are known to have poor dispersing capability.<br>

The volume of the mixture was set to 150 mL with ethanol and the reduction was carried out at a starting temperature of SS'^C under an initial H2-pressure of 60 bar. By shaking the reactor, the exothermic reaction started and the temperature increased to about   After reduction, the charge was mixed during 1 hour and the Raney Nickelâ¢ was filtered off. The filtrate was evaporated at a temperature of SOX until the desired white crystalline product MC-1D appeared. The yield of compound MC-1D was 95%. Synthesis scheme of compound MC-1D :<br><br>

While the diazionium-salt was made. 20.7 g (0.1 mol) of MC-2B from ACROS was dissolved in a mixture of 500 mL methanol and 10.0 mL (0.1 mol) 29 % sodiumhydroxide-solution. This solution was added drop-wise into the diazonium-salt solution and a yellow suspension was immediately formed. The temperature was maintained between 0 and 5Â°C for about 3 hours and the yellow product MC-2 was filtered and washed with methanol The yield of the chromophore MC-2 was 92 %.<br><br><br>

[0139]  The reaction was performed in a three-necked round-bottomed flask that was equipped with a stirrer, a cooler and a bubble-counter on top. 4 g of the polyacrylic acid homopolymer (VERSICOL E5 as powder form) was introduced in the flask and dissolved in 40 mL of anhydrous dimethylacetamide (DMA). A slight flux of nitrogen was circulated through the flask. After (VERSICOL E5) was dissolved. 4.48 g of 1 ,r-carbonyldiimidazole (GDI) was added and CO2 evolution was observed. The reaction was further stirred at room temperature for 1 hour after which 4.10 g of the chromophore MC-2 in combination with 169 mg of the<br><br>

The heterogeneous mixture obtained was basified to pH 10 with NaOH and filtrated to remove remaining precipitates. The solution was dialyzed in water (Regenerated Cellulose Dialysis Membrane of MWCO of 1,000 Dalton - SPECTRA/PORâ¢ 6) for two days and precipitates that appeared were filtered off again. The obtained solution was freeze-dried to give a fluffy yellow powder. Yield of DISP-2 was 4.8 g.<br>

Synthesis of polymeric dispersant DISP-7<br>
[0160]  The polymeric dispersant DISP-7 was prepared by copolymerizing the monomer MONC-2 with AA monomer.<br>
[0161]  The synthesis was performed in a 100 ml three-necked round-bottomed flask  which was equipped with a cooling unit, a bubble counter on top and a stirring bar. 2.26 g of the monomer AA, 1.74 g of the monomer MONC-2, 0.12 g of the initiator WAKOâ¢ V601, 0.12 g of the transfer agent MSTY were introduced in 35.76 g of dioxane. The total weight % concentration of the monomers was 10. The reaction mixture was degassed by bubbling nitrogen in the solution for approximately 30 min. The flask was immersed into an oil bath and heated to SO^'C and the mixture was further reacted for 20 hours. After polymerization, the reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature.

The yield was 71%.<br>
[0162]  Analytical results of DISP-7: GPC: Mn = 1999; Mw = 3945; PD= 1.97 (GPC in THF+5% acetic acid; calibrated vs. PS-standards)<br><br>
NMR: AA/MONC-2 molar ratio was 86/4. On average DISP-7 contained 13<br>
AA monomeric units and 2 MONC-2 monomeric units. Preparation of inkjet Ink [0163]  All inkjet inks were prepared in the same manner to obtain a composition<br>
as described in Table 6. except that different pigments and dispersants<br>
were used.<br><br>
[0164]  An ink composition was made by mixing the pigment, the dispersant and about half of the water with a dissolver and subsequently treating this mixture with a roller mill procedure using yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide-beads of 0.4 mm diameter ("high wear resistant zirconia grinding media" from TOSOH Co.). A polyethylene flask of Boil was filled to half its volume with grinding beads and 20g of the mixture. The flask was closed with a lit and put on the roller mill for three days. The speed was set at 150 rpm. After milling the dispersion was separated from the beads using a filter cloth. Under stirring, the surfactant SurfynoFi 104H and the blocide Proxelâ¢ Ultra 5, glycerol, 1,2-propanediol and the remaining water were added. This mixture was stirred for 10 minutes and filtered. The filtration was performed in two steps. First, the ink mixture is filtered using a (palatial) syringe with a microfiber disposable filter capsule with 1pm pore diameter (GF/B microfiber from Whitman Inc.) Then the same procedure is repeated on the filtrate. After the second filtration the ink is ready for evaluation.<br><br>
[0165]   Using the above method, the comparative inkjet inks COMP-1 to COMP-4 and the inventive inkjet inks INV-1 to INV-9 were prepared according to<br><br>
Results and evaluation<br>
[0166]  The spectral separation factor (SSF) was determined for each sample<br>
directly after preparation. The results are listed in Table 8 together with the<br>
%MW.<br><br><br><br>
[0167]   From Table 8 it is clear that the polyacrylic acid homopolymer was<br>
incapable of dispersing the pigments PY74 and PY17 in the comparative Inkjet inks COMP-1 and COMP-2. Modification of the polyacrylic acid with a chromophore results already in high SSF values for the comparative Inkjet inks COMP-3 and COMP-4. However, the highest SSF values were obtained when using polymeric dispersants prepared by copolymerizing monomers having a chromophore group in the inventive Inkjet inks INV-1 to INV-9 with the exception of inventive inkjet ink INV-7. The inventive Inkjet ink INV-7 shows that there is an upper-limit for the number of monomers with a chromophore group in the polymeric dispersant, as the dispersion quality was reduced to an unacceptable level for pigment PY74.<br>
[0168]   simple method of copolymerizing a monomer already containing a small chromophore group offers the advantage of well controlled design and synthesis of polymeric dispersants for one or more pigments for a specific dispersion medium.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0169]  This example illustrates the improved henna stability of inkjet inks using a polymeric dispersant prepared by the method of copolymerizing a monomer already containing a small chromophore group. It also illustrates the advantage that a monomer with a chromophore group allows the well controlled design and synthesis of polymeric dispersants.<br>
