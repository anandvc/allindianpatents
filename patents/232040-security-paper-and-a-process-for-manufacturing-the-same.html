				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a security paper and a process for manufacturing the same.<br>
The invention relates to a paper more particularly security paper, e.g. paper for bank notes or bills, checks, visas, passports, credit cards, and the like.<br>
In known manner, such papers are made more secure by means of security elements.<br>
Security elements may be constituted, for example, by fibers or platelets or flakes that are brilliant, fluorescent, luminescent, metallic, magnetic, thermochromic, photochromic, iridescent, etc.<br>
Documents FR-A-2 425 937 describes a fiber structure containing metal fibers and a method of manufacturing it.<br>
The metal fibers are incorporated in the coherent structure in controllable manner, i.e. in restricted locations and in predetermined concentrations, either on the surface or else in the thickness of the structure, e.g., in the form of strips. Strips are deposited on the surface by organizing a secondary headbox containing a dispersion of metal fibers over the wet section of the paper machine and extending over a fraction of the width of the paper. The final paper thus includes a strip in which fibers are distributed randomly since an aqueous suspension of metal fibers is deposited, with the concentration of fibers in the strip having a constant average value.<br>
The fibers may be incorporated in the thickness of the structure. When it is desired to deposit into the thickness of the structure, a paper-making dispersion is formed containing cellulose fibers and metal fibers in the desired concentration, and the resulting fiber sheet is sandwiched between sheets that do not contain metal fibers. This lamination may take place either on a paper-making machine having a plurality of flat molds, or else off the paper-making machine with the addition of paste.<br>
Such a sheet is to be a "multi-ply" sheet since it comprises a plurality of layers. In addition, the concentration of fibers is either zero outside the layer including metal fibers, or else constant within the layer that includes metal fibers. If the fibers are detected by means of a detector. It will deliver either a signal equal to 0 (fiber concentration zero) or else equal to 1 (fibers at average concentration C). Consequently, a counterfeiter can deposit fibers at a certain location, and the deposit may be uniform or random. Where there is no deposit, the detector will give a zero signal. Where deposition has taken place, the detector will give a 1 signal, regardless of whether the deposit is uniform or random, given that finer concentration ends up having a constant average value, even in a random deposit.<br>
This prevents a detector form distinguishing between authentic paper and counterfeit paper.<br>
In addition, the method of manufacturing such a sheet is expensive since it requires several steps or several Fourdrinier wire parts in the paper-making machine. Finally, such a method does not enable a sheet to be obtained on a cylinder mold paper-making machine.<br>
Document US-A-59281 describes a method of making paper which consists in adding metal fillers or powder to the pulp.   That method consists essentially in<br><br>
introducing metal elements in random manner, e.g. by means of a perforated cylinder containing metal elements that fall under gravity onto the sheet of paper being made.<br>
Document GB-A-696 673 describes a method and a apparatus for spraying security elements, e.g. metal powder, immediately before forming the sheet of paper. The elements may be inserted in the form of lines of points or lines that are curved sinusoidally or cycloidally. The apparatus can be controlled to deposit the elements by means of beta rays, but concentrations are random.<br>
An object of the invention is to provide in a simple manner a sheet that is in the form of a fibrous structure including particulate security elements disposed within the thickness of the fibrous structure including particulate security elements dispose within the thickness of the fibrous structure.<br>
The term "fibrous structure" issue to cover any structure obtained by paper -making techniques , from an aqueous composition of cellulose fibers, optionally including synthetic fibers, fillers, and any other additive as used in the paper-making industry.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a sheet in the form of a fiber structure having particulate elements enabling recognition signals to be distinguishably varied.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a security paper characterized in that it comprises:<br>
(a)	at least one ply made of fibrous structure;  and<br>
(b)	security elements in the form of particles selected from optical, metal or magnetic particles having arbitrary shape being disposed on the body of the ply the particles being disposed in the body of the ply with determined concentrations which vary according to the place on the sheet where they are provided the particles being provided according to regions Dl, D2, D3, D4 in parallel strips extending axially over the entire sheet of paper.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for manufacturing a security paper, said process comprising rotating in an aqueous suspension containing at least cellulose fibers a cylindrical paper making machine having a cylinder made of web so that the fiber deposit on the cylinder to form a ply of paper characterized in that the security element are deposited when a portion only of the ply paper has been formed on the web and then drying the ply to obtain the security paper.<br>
The process of manufacturing the security paper does not involve a chemical reaction.<br>
The sheet is single-ply. In addition, the particles are particles of arbitary shape, such a fibers, platelets, flakes, e.g. metal fibers.<br>
Preferably, the particles are located in distinct domains Dl, D2,D3,Dn with the average particle concentration CI, C2,C3,Cn in each domain being determined.<br>
The domains Dl, D2, D3, Dn are spaced apart from one another, their distance d being determined.<br><br>
The average concentrations C1, C2, C3, Cn are distributed in a curve, e.g. in a sinusoid.<br>
The security elements emit physical signals that are detectable, in particular optical, magnetic, or electrical signals.<br>
According to the invention, the security elements may be at a mean concentration CI in one location, C2 in another location, and C3 in another location, such that Cly<yc2y the signal is thus encrypted and it decrypted on reading.></yc2y>
The invention also provides a method of making such a sheet.<br>
Document WO 94/11577 (Tumba) describes a method of producing defined domains in paper that consist in preventing the paper being dried at one or more locations of the web of the machine while a sheet of paper is being formed on the machine, and by depositing a special composition on those locations, which composition contains fibers that are different from the other fibers deposited on the web.<br>
To prevent the paper from drying, i.e. to prevent fibers from depositing, a nozzle is used having a lip that rests against the web of the cylinder mold, the nozzle having a portion that delivers the special composition in the "bare" portion. That provides a paper which includes portions that are transparent, but all the other physical properties of those portions are the same as those of the remainder of the paper.<br>
Document US-A-4 437 935 (Crane) describes a method enabling security elements to be put into the surface of the paper. That method consists in depositing security elements on a strip that is dispersible by means of water, in placing the strip in a determined position on the surface of the sheet of paper, and then in dispersing the strip. It is thus possible to insert the strip into the inside of the paper. However, that method does not envisage modifying the concentration of the security elements since, on the contrary, it makes it possible to provide paper having security elements at locations that are exact in all directions.<br>
The method of the present invention consists in depositing or inserting particles when a portion only of the ply of paper has already formed on the web, and preferably while the ply is half-formed. The security elements are inserted by means of a fluid whose flow rate is controlled.<br>
According to the invention, the particles are deposited by inserting them using a device, e.g. a rigid or flexible tube, that does not touch the wire of the paper-making machine.<br><br>
The following description given with reference to the accompanying drawings of non-limiting examples serves to show how the invention can be implemented.<br>
Figure 1 is an exploded view of a sheet made in accordance with document FR-A-2 425 937.<br>
Figure 2 is an exploded view of a sheet made in accordance with document US-A-4 437 935.<br>
Figure 3 is a view of a sheet made in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Figure 4 is a section view on line AA through the sheet of Figure 3.<br>
Figure 5 is a view of the signal picked up by a detector.<br>
Figure 6 is a view of apparatus used for making the sheet of Figure 3.<br>
Figure 7 is a perspective view of another embodiment of apparatus for making the sheet of the invention.<br>
The sheet 1 shown in Figure 1 is made up of three folds. The outer folds 2 and 3 are for example fibrous structures obtained on a flat mold or a cylinder mold from an aqueous suspension of cellulose fibers, optionally mixed with synthetic fibers, fillers, and other additives well known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
The inner fold 4 is a fibrous structure obtained from an aqueous suspension containing cellulose fibers, security elements 5, optionally synthetic fibers, and other additives. The security elements are more particularly metal or magnetic fibers. Because they are inserted in an aqueous suspension, they are distributed randomly. In addition, the final sheet is made up of three folds.<br>
Figure 2 shows a sheet 6 made up of two folds 7 and 8. While the two folds are being formed during paper-making, a water-soluble strip 9 is inserted between them, the strip 9 including security elements that are separate from one another. The security elements are uniformly spaced apart. They are at constant concentration.<br>
Figure 3 shows a sheet 11 of the invention.<br>
The sheet 11 of the invention is such as to comprise security elements 12 in the form of particles. The term "particles" is used to mean any element of arbitrary shape, e.g. fibers that are a few tenths of a millimeter long, platelets, or flakes. These security elements may be metal or magnetic. The particulate elements 12 are disposed inside the thickness of the sheet 11 in the manner shown in Figure 4. The elements 12 are preferably situated substantially halfway across the thickness e of the sheet 11.<br>
According to the invention, the sheet 11 is a single-ply sheet, and the particles 12 are deposited in such a manner as to be at concentrations that are varying, but determined concentrations.   The term "determined varying concentrations" is used<br><br>
herein to mean that at any given location of the sheet, the concentration C of particles 12 is adjusted.<br>
Thus, with reference to the figures, in domain Dl, particle concentration is CI, in domain D2 it is C2, in domain D3 it is C3, and in domain Dn particle concentration is Cn.<br>
The concentrations C1, C2, C3, Cn can be adjusted so that the concentrations begin by increasing and subsequently decrease. For example:<br>
C1 C4 &gt; C6 etc.<br>
The signals transmitted by the particles therefore follow the same changes. Thus, if the concentrations C follow a sinusoidal curve, then the signals as transmitted will be sinusoidal in profile.<br>
Naturally, the concentrations C may be adjusted in such a manner that the transmitted signals have a desired configuration.<br>
In Figure 5, a sinusoidal signal S is shown as obtained from metal fibers in concentrations that increase and then decrease. Depending on the average distance d between the various domains Dl, D2, D3, Dn, the pitch of the curve representing the signal S can be adjusted.<br>
In Figure 6, there can be seen a device that enables the particle deposition method to be implemented. The figure shows a cylindrical paper-making machine, but the same method could naturally be used on a Fourdrinier wire part.<br>
The cylinder machine shown at 13 comprises a cylinder 14 made of a web which may be embossed to form a watermark in the paper. The cylinder 14 rotates in an aqueous suspension of cellulose fibers, optionally including synthetic fibers and other known additives. The fibers deposit on the cylinder 14 to form a ply 15 of paper. According to the invention, a flexible or rigid tube 16 is disposed so that its end 17 is located at the position where the ply 15 begins to form. Particles are injected via the tube 16 at a rate which is adjusted so that the concentration of particles reaching the end 17 of the tube 16 is adjusted. The particles are preferably deposited where the ply of paper is half-formed.<br>
By way of example, the flow rate of the particles is adjusted by means of a valve 18. The higher or lower the flow rate, the higher or lower the concentration vith which the particles are deposited. The particles may be conveyed by means of a fluid such as compressed air or water.<br>
When the particles are deposited on the ply that is half-formed or in the process of being formed, the ply continues to form as the cylinder 14 continues to<br><br>
rotate, and it is then lifted by a lifting web referenced 19 to go to drying apparatus or any subsequent treatment for the ply of paper.<br>
A whole series 16a, 16b, 16c of tubes 16 may be provided with their ends being placed in the vicinity of the web of the cylinder, as shown in Figure 7.<br>
The ends 17a, 17b, 17c of the tubes are placed above the web of the cylinder, but without touching.it.<br>
The distance between the ends 17a, 17b, 17c of the tubes and the surface of the web 14 is adjusted so that the particles are placed inside the ply 15 that is being formed.<br>
Differently flow rates of particles may be provided in the tubes. Similarly, different distances may be provided between the tubes so as to modulate the concentrations of particles and the locations of the domains Dl, D2, D3 relative to one another.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
