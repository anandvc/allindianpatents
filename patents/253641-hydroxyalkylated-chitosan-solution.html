				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
HYDROXYALKYLATED CHITOSAN SOLUTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001] This invention relates to a hydroxyalkylated<br>
chitosan solution and its use.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002] Chitosan is a naturally-occurring<br>
polysaccharide, and industrially, it is produced by<br>
deacetylating chitin isolated from crustaceans such<br>
as shrimps, lobsters or crabs. Chitosan is equipped<br>
with functions such as film-forming properties,<br>
antimicrobial activities, water retention<br>
properties and flocculating ability, and therefore,<br>
have been put in practical use as a functional polymer<br>
invarious fields. In recent years, its applications<br>
are actively under way especially as a safe<br>
functionalizing agent capable of imparting these<br>
functions to various substrates. For example,<br>
Patent Document 1 discloses a water-based substrate<br>
treatment composition containing chitosan or the like<br>
and a metal compound. Chitosan is also widely used<br>
as antimicrobiality-imparting coating formulations<br>
for various films, nonwoven fabrics and fiber products .<br><br>
One of technologies desired for these coating<br>
forraulations is concerned with solutions of chitosan<br>
or derivatives thereof in solvents other than water.<br>
Patent Document 1: JP-A-2003-201576<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problem to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0003] Chitosan itself dissolves neither in water nor<br>
in organic solvents, but in a dilute aqueous acid<br>
solution of an organic acid such as citric acid, acetic<br>
acid or lactic acid, chitosan forms a salt with the<br>
organic acid and dissolves. By coating various<br>
substrates with this dilute aqueous acid solution<br>
of chitosan and causing its water to evaporate, films<br>
can be formed with durability in dry forms . Therefore,<br>
such dilute aqueous acid solutions of chitosan can<br>
readily impart the unique functions of chitosan to<br>
various substrates.<br>
[0004] A chitosan solution can be in the form of an<br>
aqueous solution, when a substrate surface onto which<br>
the chitosan solution is to be applied is hydrophilic .<br>
When a substrate surface is hydrophobic or lipophilic,<br>
on the other hand, the coating of an aqueous solution<br>
of a chitosan derivative results in its repelling<br>
so that no uniform coating is available. A solution<br>
of a chitosan derivative in a solvent other than water<br><br>
is, therefore, desired for substrates the surfaces<br>
of which are hydrophobic or lipophilic. There has,<br>
however, been unknown to date any solution of a<br>
chitosan derivative, which makes use of a solvent<br>
other than water and is suited for coating hydrophobic<br>
or lipophilic surfaces.<br>
[0005] Chitosan readily dissolves in dilute aqueous<br>
acid solutions, but except for such dilute aqueous<br>
acid solutions, no solvents are known to able to<br>
effectively dissolve chitosan, to say nothing of<br>
solvents suited for coating applications. With<br>
respect to chitosan derivatives other than those<br>
having high degrees of substitution, no solvent is<br>
known to be suited either for their dissolution except<br>
for the above-mentioned dilute aqueous acid solutions,<br>
to say nothing of solvents suited for coating<br>
applications. There is, accordingly, an<br>
outstanding desire for nonaqueous solvents (organic<br>
solvents) capable of preparing solutions of chitosan<br>
derivatives, which are suited for coating hydrophobic<br>
or lipophilic surfaces.<br>
[0006] Further, dry films available from aqueous<br>
chitosan solutions, which have been commonly employed,<br>
have a problem in that they show solubility to water<br>
and are poor in waterproofness, because organic acids<br>
remain in the dry films.<br><br>
[0007] Similar to usual polymers , it is also practiced<br>
to add various crosslinking agents to aqueous<br>
solutions of chitosan so that the resulting coatings<br>
are crosslinked (see, for example, JP-B-2781990).<br>
This method has already found wide-spread utility<br>
in general industrial applications, because it has<br>
many advantages such that it can readily achieve<br>
crosslinking in a single step by appropriately<br>
choosing a crosslinking agent to be used and its use<br>
conditions and that it can control the property of<br>
the resulting coating ranging from high<br>
waterproofness that it practically does not swell<br>
in water to such waterproofness that it does not<br>
dissolve in water but absorbs water and swells<br>
substantially.<br>
[0008] However, the crosslinking agents known to date<br>
have high reactivity, and therefore, are accompanied<br>
by problems in that solutions available after mixing<br>
the crosslinking agents are short in pot life and<br>
the inherent properties of chitosan are reduced in<br>
the resulting coatings although the resulting<br>
coatings are provided with improved waterproofness.<br>
[0009] Objects of the present invent ion are , therefore,<br>
to provide a one-pack solution of a chitosan<br>
derivative, which is free from cross linking and stable<br>
at room temperature, can form a chitosan coating<br><br>
excellent in waterproof ness after drying under heat,<br>
and is suited for the coating of a hydrophobic or<br>
lipophilic surface, and a coating process of a<br>
substrate, which makes use of the one-pack solution.<br>
Means for Solving the Problem<br>
[0010] The above-described objects can be achieved by<br>
the present invention to be described hereinafter.<br>
Described specifically, the present invention<br>
provides a hydroxyalkylated chitosan solution<br>
comprising an aprotic polar solvent, a<br>
hydroxyalkylated chitosan, and an organic acid or<br>
a derivative thereof.<br>
[0011] In the present invention as described above,<br>
the; aprotic polar solvent may preferably be at least<br>
one; solvent selected from the group consisting of<br>
N,N-dimethy1formamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide,<br>
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone,<br>
1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, and dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide; the organic acid may preferably be a<br>
polybasic acid; and the polybasic acid may preferably<br>
be at least one acid selected from the group consisting<br>
of pyromelliticacid, citric acid, trimelliticacid,<br>
malic acid, polymaleic acid, phthalic acid, and<br>
succinic acid.<br>
[0012] In the present invention as described above,<br><br>
the organic acid or the derivative thereof may be<br>
used preferably in an amount of from 20 to 300 parts<br>
by weight per 100 parts by weight of the<br>
hydroxyalkylated chitosan; the hydroxyalkylated<br>
chitosan may be contained preferably at a<br>
concentration of from 1 to 40 wt%; the<br>
hydroxyalkylated chitosan may preferably have a<br>
hydroxyalkylation degree of at least 0.2; and the<br>
hydroxyalkylated chitosan may preferably be a<br>
hydroxyalkylation product of chitosan, the chitosan<br>
has a deacetylation degree of at least 30%, and, when<br>
the chitosan is dissolved at a concentration of 1<br>
wt% in a 1 wt% aqueous solution of acetic acid, a<br>
resulting solution has a viscosity of from 1 mPa.s<br>
to 10,000 mPa.s.<br>
[0013] The present invention also provides a coating<br>
process of a substrate, which comprises a step of<br>
causing the above-described hydroxyalkylated<br>
chitosan solution to adhere onto a surface of the<br>
substrate, and another step of heating the substrate,<br>
which has been obtained in the first-mentioned step,<br>
at not lower than 100°C for at least 1 second. In<br>
the process, the hydroxyalkylated chitosan solution<br>
may preferably comprise organic or inorganic<br>
particles and the substrate may preferably be a metal<br>
article.<br><br>
Advantageous Effects of the Invention<br>
[0014] According to the present invention, it is<br>
possible to provide a hydroxyalkylated chitosan<br>
solution, which can form a chitosan coating of<br>
excellent waterproofness on a hydrophobic or<br>
lipophilic surface without needing another chemical<br>
such as a crosslinking agent, and also a coating<br>
process of a substrate, which makes use of the<br>
solution.<br>
Best Modes for Carrying out the Invention<br>
[0015] The present invention will next be described<br>
in further detail based on preferred embodiments.<br>
As mentioned above, there was not known to date<br>
any solution of a chitosan derivative<br>
(hydroxyalkylated chitosan), which makes use of an<br>
organic solvent suited for coating a hydrophobic or<br>
lipophilic surface. The present inventors,<br>
therefore, conducted an enthusiastic investigation<br>
about conditions for dissolving a hydroxyalkylated<br>
chitosan in an organic solvent. As a result, the<br>
present inventors found that, when the<br>
hydroxyalkylated chitosan and an organic acid or its<br>
derivative (which may hereinafter be referred to as<br>
"the organic acid", including the derivative) is added<br><br>
to various aprotic polar solvents, the<br>
hydroxyalkylated chitosan and the organic acid<br>
interact and hydroxyalkylated chitosan solutions are<br>
obtained.<br>
[0016] Further, the chitosan solution was coated on<br>
a surface of a substrate, the solvent was caused to<br>
evaporate off by reduced-pressure drying to form a<br>
coating, the substrate was heated at 180°C or higher<br>
for 30 seconds, and the substrate was then immersed<br>
in water. As a result, it was confirmed that even<br>
24 hours later, no changes were visually observed<br>
on the coating and the formed coating became a<br>
waterproof coating.<br>
[0017] The hydroxyalkylated chitosan solution<br>
according to the present invention is characterized<br>
in that the hydroxyalkylated chitosan and the organic<br>
acid are contained in the aprotic polar solvervt.<br>
Preferably, the hydroxyalkylated chitosan for<br>
use in the present invention may have a structure<br>
that an alkylene oxide or oxiranemethanol is added<br>
to the amino group of chitosan, like hydroxyethyl<br>
chitosan, hydroxypropyl chitosan, hydroxybutyl<br>
chitosanorglycerylatedchitosan, and may be produced<br>
by reacting chitosan with the alkylene oxide or<br>
oxiranemethanol. It is, however, to be noted that<br>
the hydroxyalkylated chitosan for use in the present<br><br>
the present invention, the glycerylatedchitosan will<br>
hereinafter be embraced in the term "hydroxyalkylated<br>
chitosan".<br>
[0020] From the standpoint of the solubility of such<br>
a hydroxyalkylated chitosan in an aprotic polar<br>
solvent, the degree of addition of a corresponding<br>
alkylene oxide or oxiranemethanol to chitosan [the<br>
degree of hydroxyalkylation (nounit) ] may preferably<br>
be 0.2 (mole) or greater but 4 (moles) or less per<br>
pyranose ring (mole of pyranose) . To obtain such<br>
a hydroxyalkylation degree, it is desired to add and<br>
react 0.3 (mole) or greater but 10 (moles) or less<br>
of the alkylene oxide per pyranose ring (mole<br>
pyranose) that makes up chitosan. A hydroxylation<br>
degree of 0.2 or less is insufficient from the<br>
standpoint of the solubility in the aprotic polar<br>
solvent. Even when the hydroxylation degree exceeds<br>
4, on the other hand, the solubility in the aprotic<br>
polar solvent does not change so that the setting<br>
of the hydroxyalkylation degree beyond 4 is<br>
uneconomical.<br>
[0021] In the present invention, no particular<br>
limitation is imposed on the source of chitosan as<br>
a raw material for the hydroxyalkylated chitosan and<br>
the production process of the hydroxyalkylated<br>
chitosan, and chitosan products which have been<br><br>
industrially manufactured to date are all usable.<br>
Further, no particular limitation is imposed either<br>
on the deacetylation degree or polymerization degree<br>
of chitosan. Preferably, however, the<br>
deacetylation degree of chitos an may be 30% orhigher,<br>
with 70% to 100% being more preferred and 80% to 100%<br>
being still more preferred.<br>
[0022] Preferred as chitosan can be such chitosan that<br>
as an aqueous solution containing the chitosan at<br>
1 wt% and acetic acid at 1 wt%, the viscosity of the<br>
aqueous solution (20°C) ranges from 1 mPa.s to 10,000<br>
mPa.s. A deacetylation degree of lower than 30% is<br>
insufficient from the standpoint of the solubility<br>
of a hydroxyalkylated chitosan, which is available<br>
from a reaction with the corresponding alkylene oxide<br>
or oxiranemethanol, in the aprotic polar solvent.<br>
If the above-described viscosity is lower than 1 mPa-s,<br>
the resulting coating is insufficient in strength.<br>
If the above-described viscosity is higher than 10,00 0<br>
mPa.s, on the other hand, a solution of the resulting<br>
hydroxyalkylated chitosan has an excessively high<br>
viscosity so that the concentration of the<br>
hydroxyalkylated chitosan has to be limited at a very<br>
low level. Therefore, viscosities outside the<br>
above-described range are not preferred.<br>
[0023] Chitosan, which is employed as a raw material<br><br>
for the hydroxyalkylated chitosan to be used in the<br>
present invention, may more preferably be one having<br>
a deacetylation degree of from 80% to 100% and, as<br>
an aqueous solution containing 1 wt% of the chitosan<br>
and 1 wt% of acetic acid, giving a viscosity of from<br>
3 mPa.s to 100 mPa.s from the standpoints of the<br>
solubility of the chitosan and the strength of the<br>
resulting coating.<br>
[0024] As the organic acid or its derivative for use<br>
in the present invention, those known to date can<br>
each be used, including organic acids such as<br>
salicylic acid, pyromellitic acid, citric acid,<br>
trimellitic acid, malicacid, pyrrolidonecarboxylic<br>
acid, polymaleic acid, phthalic acid, succinic acid<br>
and 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylicacid. Preferred<br>
can be polybasic acids, their acid anhydrides, and<br>
salts of some or all of their carboxyl groups, notably<br>
their ammonium salts and amine salts and alkyl esters,<br>
amides, imides, amide-imides and the like of some<br>
or all of their carboxyl groups. Preferred as<br>
derivatives of these polybasic acids are compounds<br>
which regenerate polybasic acids upon heating of<br>
coatings to be formed subsequently.<br>
More preferably, the polybasic acid can be at<br>
least one acid selected from the group consisting<br>
of pyromellitic acid, citric acid, trimellitic acid,<br><br>
etc.), carbonates (ethylene carbonate, ethyl methyl<br>
carbonate, diethyl carbonate, dimethyl carbonate,<br>
propylene carbonate, butylene carbonate, etc.),<br>
amides (formamide, N-methylformamide,<br>
N-methylacetamide, N-ethylformamide,<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-diethylformamide,<br>
acetamide, N-methylacetamide, N-ethylacetamide,<br>
N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-diethylacetamide,<br>
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone,<br>
piperidone, N-methylpiperidone , N-ethylpiperidone,<br>
hexamethylphosphoric triamide,<br>
1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone,<br>
methyloxazolidinone, ethyloxazolidinone, etc.),<br>
sulfoxides (dimethyl sulfoxide, etc.), andsulfones<br>
(tetramethylene sulfone, etc.). Among these,<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide,<br>
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone,<br>
1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone and dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide are more preferred. With respect to these<br>
aprotic polar solvents, a selection is made as desired<br>
depending on the application. These aprotic polar<br>
solvents may be used either singly or in combination.<br>
[0027] As the organic acid and aprotic polar solvent<br>
for use in the present invention, general commercial<br>
products can be used as they are, or they may be used<br>
after purification as needed. Concerning the<br><br>
hydroxyalkylated chitosan, one produced by the<br>
above-described process may be used with the reaction<br>
solvent, byproducts and/or the like still contained<br>
therein, or may be used after purification.<br>
[002 8] As the order of addition of the hydroxyalkylated<br>
chitosan and organic acid to the aprotic polar solvent<br>
upon their dissolution in the solvent to prepare the<br>
hydroxyalkylated chitosan solution according to the<br>
present invention, either the hydroxyalkylated<br>
chitosan or the organic acid may be added first or<br>
they may be added at the same time. As their<br>
dissolution method, stirring may be conducted with<br>
heating as needed although stirring at room<br>
temperature is sufficient.<br>
[0029] The existence of water contained in individual<br>
additives to be used as needed and the existence of<br>
water formed when the organic acid is a hydrate or<br>
the like affect neither the hydroxyalkylated chitosan<br>
solution according to the present invention nor the<br>
formation of a coating on a substrate by the solution.<br>
No conditions are thus applied to such water.<br>
[0030] The concentration of the hydroxyalkylated<br>
chitosan in the hydroxyalkylated chitosan solution<br>
according to the present invention may range<br>
preferably from 1 to 40 wt%, more preferably from<br>
5 to 10 wt% from the viewpoints of coating<br><br>
applicability, transport cost and the like. A<br>
concentration lower than 1 wt% makes it difficult<br>
to obtain a stable coating, while a concentration<br>
higher than 40wt% makes it hard to obtain a homogeneous<br>
solution.<br>
[0031] The hydroxyalkylated chitosan solution<br>
according to the present invention can be used for<br>
coating a substrate as it is. For improving the<br>
applicability to a substrate, however, it is possible<br>
to add an organic substance, such as a cationic<br>
surfactant, a nonionic surfactant or a lipophilic<br>
or hydrophobic organic solvent, an inorganic filler<br>
orthelike. Further, the addition of a preservative,<br>
antimold agent or the like is not particularly<br>
inhibited. In addition, a crosslinking agent other<br>
than an organic acid may also be incorporated in the<br>
hydroxyalkylated chitosan solution as needed.<br>
[0 032] Examples of the crosslinking agent other than<br>
the organic acid include epoxy compounds such as<br>
ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, polyethylene<br>
glycol diglycidyl ether and glycerol polyglycidyl<br>
ether; isocyanate compounds such as toluylen<br>
diisocyanate, xylylenediisocyanate, hexamethylene<br>
diisocyanate and phenyl diisocyanate, and blocked<br>
isocyanate compounds formed by blocking such<br>
isocyanate compounds with blocking agents such as<br><br>
phenols, alcohols, active methylene compounds,<br>
mercaptans, acid-amides, imides, amines, imidazoles,<br>
ureas, carbamic acids, imines, oximes or sulfites;<br>
aldehyde compounds such as glyoxal, glutaraldehyde,<br>
and dialdehyde starch; (meth)acrylate compounds such<br>
as polyethylene glycol diacrylate, polyethylene<br>
glycol dimethacrylate and hexanediol diacrylates;<br>
methylol compounds such as methylolmelamine and<br>
dimethylol urea; organic acid metal salts such as<br>
zirconyl acetate, zirconyl carbonate and titanium<br>
lactate; metal alkoxide compounds such as aluminum<br>
trimethoxide, aluminum tributoxide, titanium<br>
tetraethoxide, titanium tetrabutoxide, zirconium<br>
tetrabutoxide, aluminum dipropoxide<br>
acethylacetonate, titanium dimethoxide<br>
bis ( acetylacetonate) and titanium dibutoxide<br>
bis(ethylacetoacetate); carbodiimide compounds;<br>
and the like. The use of such a crosslinking agent<br>
is not essential. When to be employed, however, the<br>
amount of the crosslinking agent may suitably range<br>
from 0.1 to 200 wt% based on the hydroxyalkylated<br>
chitosan.<br>
[0033] The coating process of the present invention<br>
for the substrate comprises the step of causing the<br>
hydroxyalkylated chitosan solution according to the<br>
present invention to adhere onto the surface of the<br><br>
substrate, and the step of heating the substrate,<br>
which has been obtained in the first-mentioned step,<br>
at not lower than 100°C for at least 1 second. Examples<br>
of the substrate to be coated by the hydroxyalkylated<br>
chitosan solution according to the present invention<br>
include, but are not limited to, glass, ceramics,<br>
plastics, metals, fibers, non-woven products, and<br>
packaging materials (for example, plastic films, and<br>
composite films of aluminum and resins).<br>
[0034] According to the coating process of the present<br>
invention, various substrates on each of which a<br>
coating of a hydroxyalkylated chitosan, said coating<br>
containing an organic acid, is applied can each be<br>
obtained by applying a hydroxyalkylated chitosan<br>
solution onto the substrate by spraying, coating or<br>
impregnation to form a coating and then causing the<br>
solvent to evaporate from the coating until the<br>
content of the solvent in the coating is decreased<br>
to 15% or lower, preferably 5% or lower based on the<br>
weight of the hydroxyalkylated chitosan in the coating.<br>
No particular limitation is imposed on the thickness<br>
of each coating to be formed by the above-described<br>
process, and the thickness of each coating may<br>
generally range from 1 to 500 μm or so. The drying<br>
of the substrate with the hydroxyalkylated chitosan<br>
solution coated thereon may preferably be conducted<br><br>
under reduced pressure or ambient pressure at a<br>
temperature of the boiling point of the solvent or<br>
higher. To provide the thus-formed coating with<br>
improved waterproofness, the substrate with the<br>
coating formed thereon can be heated preferably at<br>
100°C or higher for 1 second or longer, more preferably<br>
at 150 to 250°C for 1 second to 10 minutes afterdrying.<br>
If the heating temperature is lower than 100°C or<br>
the heating time is shorter than 1 second as a heat<br>
treatment condition, no coating can be obtained with<br>
excellent waterproofness.<br>
[0035] The present invention is useful especially when<br>
the substrate is an aluminum foil or copper foil to<br>
be used for the fabrication of an electrode plate<br>
for a nonaqueous electrolyte secondary battery.<br>
Described specifically, when an active material for<br>
an electrode is added to the above-described solution<br>
of the present invention and a layer of the active<br>
material is formed on a surface of an aluminum foil<br>
or copper foil as a collector, an active material<br>
layer having excellent adhesion to the collector can<br>
be formed.<br>
[0036] It is to be noted that the application of the<br>
hydroxylated chitosan solution according to the<br>
present invention is not limited to the coating of<br>
a substrate by spraying, coating, impregnation or<br><br>
the like. For example, solid particles containing<br>
the hydroxyalkylated chitosan can be obtained by<br>
drying the hydroxyalkylated chitosan solution in air<br>
by a. method such as spray drying. A film with the<br>
hydroxyalkylated chitosan contained therein can also<br>
be obtained by casting the hydroxyalkylated chitosan<br>
solution on a glass plate and then coating it.<br>
[0037] As has been described above, the<br>
hydroxyalkylated chitosan solution according to the<br>
present invention contains only the hydroxyalkylated<br>
chitosan, organic acid and aprotic polar solvent as<br>
its essential elements, is easy to produce, and is<br>
extremely useful as a coating forming composition,<br>
which is equipped with functionality and<br>
waterproofness, especially for a hydrophobic or<br>
lipophilic substrate surface or metal article surface<br>
the coating of which with an aqueous solution of<br>
chitosan or the like has heretofore been difficult.<br>
Examples<br>
[0038] The present invention will next be described<br>
more specifically based on Examples and Comparative<br>
Examples . It is tobe noted that the present invention<br>
shall not be limited by these Examples.<br><examples and comparative examples of glycerylated></examples>
Chitosan&gt;<br><br>
The compositions of individual glycerylated<br>
chitosan solutions employed in the Examples and<br>
Comparative Examples are shown in Table 1 . Examples<br>
14-16 are all directed to the same composition, but<br>
the composition is repeatedly described because<br>
conditions in the coating process of the present<br>
invention were different. The expression<br>
"viscosity of 1% raw chitosan solution" in the table<br>
indicates the viscosity of a 1 wt% acetic acid solution<br>
containing 1 wt% of chitosan as a raw material for<br>
the corresponding glycerylated chitosan (viscosity<br>
measuring method : measured by a Brookfield rotational<br>
viscometer under the conditions consisting of a<br>
measuring temperature of 20°C and a measuring rotation<br>
speed of 30 rpm) . Concerning aprotic polar solvents<br>
used in the respective glycerylated chitosan<br>
solutions, the following abbreviations are used: NMP<br>
(N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone), DMF<br>
(N,N-dimethylformamide) , DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide) ,<br>
DMAC (N,N-dimethylacetamide), and DMI<br>
(1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone).<br>
[0039] Example 1<br>
Dispersed in NMP (80 parts by weight) was<br>
glycerylated chitosan (deacetylation degree of raw<br>
chitosan: 83%; 10 parts by weight) . After salicylic<br>
acid (10 parts by weight) was added to the dispersion,<br><br>
the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature<br>
for 4 hours to effect dissolution. After the<br>
thus-prepared solution was allowed to stand overnight,<br>
it was again stirred at room temperature for 1 hour<br>
to effect dissolution so that a glyceryl chitosan<br>
solution (100 parts by weight) was prepared.<br>
[0040]Examples 2-21<br>
In a similar manner as in Example 1, glycerylated<br>
chitosan solutions according to the present invention were<br>
each prepared with the viscosity of an aqueous 1 wt% acetic<br>
acid solution containing the raw chitosan for the<br>
corresponding glycerylated chitosan, the glycerylation<br>
degree and weight of the glycerylated chitosan, the kind<br>
and weight of the organic acid, the mixing ratio of the<br>
glycerylated chitosan to the organic acid and the kind and<br>
weight of the aprotic polar solvent being changed as shown<br>
in Table 1. The deacetylation degree of the raw chitosan<br>
employed was 83%. It is to be noted that, when it was difficult<br>
to dissolve the glycerylated chitosan by stirring at room<br>
temperature, stirring was conducted with heating to prepare<br>
the solution.<br>
[0041]	Preparation procedures of the various solutions<br>
employed as the Comparative Examples will be described<br>
hereinafter.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
Comparative Example 1 is directed to the use of chitosan<br><br>
not subjected to a glycerylation reaction (deacetylation<br>
degree: 85%, glycerylation degree: 0, viscosity of anaqueous<br>
1 wt% acetic acid solution containing the chitosan at 1 wt%:<br>
6 mPa.s; hereinafter simply called "the chitosan"). The<br>
chitosan (5 parts by weight) was dispersed in NMP (90 parts<br>
by weight) . Subsequent to the addition of pyromellitic acid<br>
(5 parts by weight) , the thus-obtained mixture was stirred<br>
at room temperature for 4 hours, but the chitosan was not<br>
dissolved at all. The NMP was then heated to 80°C, at which<br>
stirring was conducted for 2 hours. However, the chitosan<br>
was not dissolved at all, and therefore, no chitosan NMP<br>
solution was obtained.<br>
[ 0042]Comparative Example 2<br>
Comparative Example 2 is directed to the preparation<br>
of a solution without using any organic acid. Glycerylated<br>
chitosan (deacetylation degree of raw chitosan: 83%; lOparts<br>
byweight) was dispersed in NMP (90 parts by weight), followed<br>
by stirring at room temperature for 4 hours. After the<br>
resultant dispersion was allowed to stand overnight, it<br>
was again stirred at room temperature for 1 hour to<br>
effect dissolution so that a glyceryl chitosan<br>
solution (100 parts by weight) was prepared.<br>
[ 0043]Comparative Example 3<br>
Dispersed In NMP (90 parts by weight) was<br>
glycerylated chitosan (deacetylation degree of raw<br>
chitosan: 85%; 5 parts by weight). After<br><br>
pyromellitic acid (5 parts by weight) was added to<br>
the dispersion, the resulting mixture was stirred<br>
at room temperature for 4 hours to effect dissolution.<br>
After the thus-prepared solution was allowed to stand<br>
overnight, it was again stirred at room temperature<br>
for 1 hour to effect dissolution so that a glyceryl<br>
chitosan solution (100 parts by weight) wasprepared.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0046] On coatings obtained by using the individual<br>
glycerylated chitosan solutions prepared in<br>
accordance with the compositions shown in Table 1<br>
and by following the below-described coating forming<br>
method, a waterproofness evaluation test was<br>
performed. The evaluation results are shown in Table<br>
2.<br>
[0047 ] <coating forming method><br>
On surfaces of stainless steel sheets (SUS304, 1 mm<br>
thick x 10 cm long x 10 cm wide) which had not been subjected<br>
to any pretreatment such as degreasing treatment, the various<br>
solutions of Examples 1-21 and Comparative Examples 2 and<br>
3 were coated by a bar coater to give dry coat weights of<br>
2 g/m2, respectively. Under the conditions shown in Table<br>
2, drying was then conducted. The thus-coated stainless<br>
steel sheets were provided as specimens to be used in the<br>
following evaluation test.<br>
[0048]<waterproofness evaluation testing method><br>
Each specimen was immersed for 24 hours in purified<br>
water, and was then dried under heat for 1 hour in a fan<br>
dryer controlled at 105°C. After being allowed to cool down<br>
to room temperature, its weight was measured, and in<br>
accordance with the following formula, the percent residue<br>
of its coating was determined.<br>
(C - A)/(B - A) x 100 (%)<br>
where,<br><br>
A: Weight of a stainless steel sheet before coating<br>
a solution,<br>
B: Weight of the stainless steel sheet after coating<br>
and drying the solution, and<br>
C: Weight of the stainless steel after immersing,<br>
subsequent to the coating and drying of the solution,<br>
the stainless steel for 24 hours in water and then<br>
conducting drying again.<br>
[0049]<evaluation standards for waterproofness><br>
The waterproofness of each coating was evaluated in<br>
4 stages based on the value obtained in accordance with the<br>
above-described formula. The evaluation method was as<br>
follows:<br>
A: Percent residue of coating  95%<br>
B: 95% &gt; percent residue of coating  80%<br>
C: 80% &gt; percent residue of coating  50%<br>
D: 50% &gt; percent residue of coating<br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0052] As is evident from the above results of Table<br>
2, the results of the waterproofness evaluations of<br>
the coatings formed using the glycerylated chitosan<br>
solutions according to the present invention were<br>
good. Comparative Example 1 is directed to the<br>
illustrative use of chitosan in place of a<br>
glycerylated chitosan. The chitosan was not<br>
dissolved in NMP so that no solution was successfully<br>
prepared. In Comparative Example 2 , the NMP solution<br>
was prepared using the glycerylated chitosan of the<br>
high degree of substitution (glycerylation degree:<br>
3.2) without using any organic acid. The coating<br>
formed from the solution was not equipped with any<br>
waterproofness . In Comparative Example 3, the<br>
coating was formed using a vacuum dryer without<br>
heated-air drying at high temperatures . Asaresult,<br>
the waterproofness of the coating was poor.<br>
[0053] To evaluate the pot lives of the above-described<br>
glycerylated chitosan solutions, portions of the<br>
individual solutions of Examples 1-21 (the solutions<br>
of Examples 14-16 were the same) were stored in a<br>
room (20to28°C) and in a constant-temperature chamber<br>
(50°C), respectively, to observe any changes with<br>
time in the solution forms. Even after an elapsed<br>
time of 3 months or longer, all of the solutions neither<br>
increased in viscosity nor formed a gel, and therefore,<br><br>
were usable for coating substrates.<br>
[0054] Example 22<br>
Onto a polyimide film of 50 μm thickness (10 cm x 5<br>
cm), the 5 wt% glycerylated chitosan solution of Example<br>
14 (solution viscosity: 174mPa-s) was coated by a bar coater.<br>
Repelling of the NMP solution was not observed at all, and<br>
uniform coating was feasible onto the polyimide film the<br>
surface of which was hydrophobic.<br>
[ 0055]Comparative Example 4<br>
Onto a polyimide film of 50 μm thickness (10 cm x 5<br>
cm), a 5 wt% aqueous solution (solution viscosity: 186mPa.s)<br>
of citric acid, said solution containing 5 wt% of chitosan,<br>
was coated by a bar coater. The aqueous solution was repelled.<br>
It was, therefore, unable to uniformly coat the aqueous<br>
solution onto the polyimide film.<br>
[0056]Examples 23-25<br>
In Table 3, the compositions of individual<br>
hydroxyalkylated chitosan solutions employed as Examples<br>
23-25 are shown. The abbreviations of the aprotic polar<br>
solvents used in the individual hydroxyalkylated chitosan<br>
solutions are as defined above. The production of the<br>
hydroxyalkylated chitosans was conducted in a manner known<br>
perse in the art. The raw chitosan for the hydroxyalkylated<br>
chitosans was the same as that employed above in Example<br>
6.<br><br><br><br>
[0058] On coatings obtained by using the<br>
hydroxyalkylated chitosan solutions described in<br>
Table 3 and following the same coating forming method<br>
as in the case of the glycerylated chitosans, a<br>
waterproofness evaluation test was performed in a<br>
similar manner as described above. The evaluation<br>
results are shown in Table 4.<br><br><br><br>
[0060] As is evident from the above results of Table<br>
4, the results of the waterproofness evaluations of<br>
the coatings formed using the glycerylated chitosan<br>
solutions according to the present invention were<br>
good.<br>
[ 0061 ]<application examples to batteries><br>
Application Example 1 (Coating formulation,<br>
electrode plate)<br>
A positive-electrode coating formulation<br>
employed in this Example and containing a positive<br>
electrode active material was prepared by the<br>
procedure to be described hereinafter. As materials<br>
for the positive-electrode coating formulation,<br>
LiCoO2 powder having particle sizes of from 1 to 100<br>
μm/ acetylene black as a conductive aid and the<br>
solution of Example 14 described above in Table 1<br>
were stirred and mixed at a mixing ratio of 90 parts<br>
by weight, 5 parts by weight and 50 parts by weight<br>
at a rotation speed of 60 rpm for 120 minutes in a<br>
planetary mixer to obtain a slurry-form,<br>
positive-electrode coating formulation with the<br>
positive-electrode active material contained<br>
therein.<br>
[0062] Using the positive-electrode coating<br>
formulation obtained as described above and employing,<br>
as a substrate, a collector formed of a 20-μm thick<br><br>
aluminum foil, the positive-electrode coating<br>
formulation was applied on one side of the substrate<br>
by a "COMMA ROLL COATER". The thus-coated substrate<br>
was then dried for 2 minutes in an oven controlled<br>
at 110°C, and was further dried for 2 minutes in the<br>
oven controlled at 150°C to eliminate the solvent<br>
and to have the binder crosslinked, so that a positive<br>
electrode plate with an active material layer formed<br>
with a dry thickness of 100 μm on the collector was<br>
obtained. The positive electrode plate obtained by<br>
the above-described procedure was pressed under<br>
conditionsof 5, 000 kgf/cm2 to make the coating uniform.<br>
Subsequently, aging was conducted for 48 hours in<br>
a vacuum oven controlled at 80°C to completely<br>
eliminate volatiles (the solvent, the unreacted<br>
polybasic acid, etc.).<br>
[0063] Parallel lines, which consisted of<br>
perpendicularly-intersecting 11 vertical lines and<br>
11 horizontal lines, were drawn by a cutter at<br>
intervals of 1 mm on the active material layer to<br>
form 100 squares within 1 cm2. A mending tape was<br>
applied to the surface of the active material layer,<br>
and tape peeling was then conducted. The number of<br>
squares which were not peeled off was counted as a<br>
measure of adhesiveness. The average of 10 tests<br>
was 98.0 squares. Further, the conditions of the<br><br>
active material layer were observed after the<br>
electrode plate with the squares formed thereon as<br>
described above was immersed at 50°C for 24 hours<br>
in a mixed solvent of EC (ethylene carbonate), PC<br>
(propylene carbonate) and DME (dimethoxyethane)<br>
combined together at a volume ratioof 1:1:2. Neither<br>
peeling nor swelling of the active material layer<br>
was recognized.<br>
[0064]Application Example 2 (Coating formulation,<br>
electrode plate)<br>
A negative-electrode coating formulation<br>
employed in this Example and containing a<br>
negative-electrode active material was prepared by<br>
the procedure to be described next. Carbon powder<br>
obtainedby thermal degradation of coal coke at l,200°C,<br>
acetylene black as a conductive aid and the solution<br>
of Example 8 described above were stirred and mixed<br>
at a mixing ratio of 90 parts by weight, 5 parts by<br>
weight and 50 parts by weight at a rotation speed<br>
of 60 rpm for 120 minutes in the planetary mixer to<br>
obtain a slurry-form coating formulation with the<br>
negative-electrode active material contained<br>
therein.<br>
[0065] The coating formulation containing the<br>
negative-electrode active material and obtained as<br>
described above was applied onto a copper-foil<br><br>
collector by using the "COMMA ROLL COATER". After<br>
the thus-coated collector was processed through a<br>
drying step, it was dried for 2 minutes in the oven<br>
controlled at 110°C, and was further dried for 2<br>
minutes in the oven controlled at 150°C to eliminate<br>
the solvent and to have the binder crosslinked, so<br>
that an active material layer was formed with a dry<br>
thickness of 100 μm on the collector. A negative<br>
electrode plate obtained by the above-described<br>
procedure was pressed under conditions of 5,000<br>
kgf/cm2 to make the coating uniform. Subsequently,<br>
aging was conducted for 48 hours in a vacuum oven<br>
controlled at 80°C to completely eliminate volatiles<br>
(the solvent, the unreacted polybasic acid, etc.).<br>
[0066] Parallel lines, which consisted of<br>
perpendicularly-intersecting 11 vertical lines and<br>
11 horizontal lines, were drawn by a cutter at<br>
intervals of 1 mm on the active material layer to<br>
form 100 squares within 1 cm2. A mending tape was<br>
applied to the surface of the active material layer,<br>
and tape peeling was then conducted. The number of<br>
squares which were not peeled off was counted as a<br>
measure of adhesiveness. The average of 10 tests<br>
was 96 squares. Neither peeling nor swelling of the<br>
active material layer was recognized.<br>
[0067]Application Example 3 (Battery)<br><br>
An electrode unit was first formed by using<br>
the positive-electrode plate and negative-electrode<br>
plate, which had been obtained above in Application<br>
Example 1 and Application Example 2, respectively,<br>
and rolling them into a volute form with a separator<br>
interposed therebetween. The separator was made of<br>
a porous polyolefin (polypropylene, polyethylene or<br>
a copolymer thereof) film having a width broader than<br>
the positive-electrode plate and a three-dimensional<br>
porous (spongy) structure. The electrode unit was<br>
then inserted into a bottomed cylindrical, stainless<br>
steel can, which would also serve as a<br>
negative-electrode terminal, so that a battery of<br>
the AA size and 500 mAh rated capacity was assembled.<br>
Charged as an electrolyte into the battery was a<br>
solution of 1 mole of LiPF6 as a supporting salt in<br>
a mixed solvent prepared by combining EC (ethylene<br>
carbonate), PC (propylene carbonate) and DME<br>
(dimethoxyethane) at a volume ratio of 1:1:2 to give<br>
a total volume of 1 liter.<br>
[0068] Forthe measurement of battery characteristics,<br>
a charge-discharge measuring instrument was used.<br>
Twenty (20) batter ies we re charged at the temperature<br>
condition of 25°C and the current value of a 0.2 CA<br>
charging current, firstly in a charging direction<br>
until a battery voltage reached 4.1V. After a break<br><br>
of 10 minutes, the cells were discharged by the same<br>
current until 2.75 V was reached. Subsequent to a<br>
break of 10 minutes, charging and discharging were<br>
then repeated 100 cycles under the same conditions<br>
to measure charge-discharge characteristics. When<br>
the charge-discharge capacity in the 1st cycle was<br>
assumed to be 100, the charge-discharge capacity in<br>
the 100th cycle was 96.<br>

or lipophilic surface the coating of which with an<br>
aqueous solution has heretofore been difficult. It<br>
is also useful as a binder upon fabrication of<br>
electrode plates for batteries.<br><br>
