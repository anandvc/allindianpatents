EARTH LEAKAGE CIRCUIT BREAKER WITH FUNCTION<br>
FOR DETECTING REVERSE LEAKAGE CURRENT<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1] The present invention relates to an earth leakage circuit breaker (ELCB). and more<br>
particularly, to an ELCB with a function for detecting a reverse leakage current which<br>
backflows while cutting off an electric leakage.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2] An electric leakage is a phenomenon that an electric current flows into a ground<br>
through a conductor when a cover of an electric wire or an insulator of an electrical<br>
product get deteriorated or mechanically damaged. An electric leakage means that a<br>
leakage current occurs to cause a fire, leading to victims. In order to prevent human<br>
and material damage caused by such electric leakage, an ELCB is usually installed in<br>
places where electrical products are used such as a factory or a home. A typical ELCB<br>
operates such that electrical power supplied to an electrical product is forcibly cut off<br>
when an electric leakage or an overload occurs.<br>
[3] After an electric leakage state is released, a circuit breaker s lever should be manually<br>
reset to an original position. However, in case where electrical power is cut off due to<br>
an electric leakage in a place where a person is not easy to approach like a wireless<br>
communication repeater, a person is necessary who can make a breaker lever to be<br>
reset for electrical power to be supplied again. For the foregoing reason, there is a<br>
problem in that electrical power is not supplied for a long time from a time when an<br>
electric leakage is released to a time when a circuit breaker is manually reset.<br>
[4] FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a conventional ELCB in which a breaker lever<br>
is automatically resettable after electrical power is cut off due to an electric leakage.<br>
The ELCB 10 comprises a power switch unit 12 including a breaker switch, an electric<br>
leakage sensing unit 14 for comparing a phase difference between both end voltages<br>
AC1-IN and AC2-IN to detect an electric leakage state, and a breaker driving unit 16<br>
for driving the breaker switch to an OFF state. The ELCB 10 further comprises a reset<br>
driving unit 18 electrically connected to the power switch unit 12. The reset driving<br>
unit 18 serves to forcibly make the breaker switch to be reset to an ON state in order to<br>
supply electrical power again.<br>
[5] However, the conventional ELCB 10 has a problem in that its practicality is lowered<br>
since its external form structure becomes greatly different from a universal one due to<br>
the reset driving unit 18. In order to resolve such a problem, Korean Patent No.<br>
0718530. which was filed on April 29. 2006 in Korea and issued on May 9, 2007 to an<br>
applicant of the present invention, discloses an earth leakage circuit breaker with an<br>
automatic reset means in which a structure change of a universal circuit breaker is<br>
minimized.<br>
[6] Nevertheless, the conventional automatic resettable ELCB supplies electrical power<br>
again by using a forcible resetting method after electrical power is cut off and. so it is<br>
not efficient. As a time increases, the number of forcible reset times reaches tens of<br>
times to hundreds of times, and this gives a mechanical burden to the ELCB. reducing<br>
the lifespan of the ELCB.<br>
[7] In order to resolve the above problem, Korean Utility Model No. 0312397 discloses<br>
an automatic resettable ELCB which continuously supplies a small current to a load<br>
side using a condenser to detect an electric leakage state. However, an amount of<br>
current supplied by the condenser is extremely restrictive, and mere is a limitation to<br>
putting it to practical use, and its reliability is not high since an electric leakage state is<br>
determined using a small amount of current.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[8] It is an object of the present invention to provide an ELCB which is automatically<br>
reset after an electric leakage state is released.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[9] One aspect of the present invention provides an earth leakage circuit breaker (ELCB)<br>
with a function of detecting a leakage current which backflows while cutting off an<br>
electric leakage, comprising: a breaker portion for detecting an occurrence of an<br>
electric leakage to cut off electrical power; and a leakage current detecting portion<br>
electrically connected in parallel with the breaker portion between an input terminal<br>
and an output terminal of the breaker portion and detecting a leakage current which<br>
backflows from the output terminal after electrical power is cut off by the breaker<br>
portion.<br>
[10] The ELCB further comprises an electric leakage signal generating portion electrically<br>
connected to the leakage current detecting portion and generating an electric leakage<br>
signal by using the leakage current detected by the leakage current detecting portion;<br>
and an electric leakage control portion for controlling an operation of the breaker<br>
portion by using the electric leakage signal generated by the electric leakage signal<br>
generating portion.<br>
[11] The leakage current detecting portion comprises a light-emitting diode for generating<br>
light using an electric current; and a first resistor electrically connected serially to the<br>
light-emitting diode.<br>
[12] The leakage current detecting portion further comprises a second resistor electrically<br>
connected in parallel with the light-emitting diode.<br>
[13] The electric leakage signal generating portion comprises a first transistor electrically<br>
connected to the light-emitting diode and being turned on by light generated by the<br>
light-emitting diode; and a third resistor electrically connected serially to the first<br>
transistor.<br>
[14] The electric leakage control portion comprises an automatic rest unit electrically<br>
connected to the breaker portion and releasing a breaking state of the breaker portion;<br>
and a controller electrically connected between the electric leakage signal generating<br>
portion and the automatic rest unit and controlling an operation of the automatic reset<br>
unit according to the electric leakage signal generated by the electric leakage signal<br>
generating portion.<br>
[15] The ELCB further comprises a test portion serially connected between the electric<br>
leakage control portion and the leakage current detecting portion to be operated by the<br>
electric leakage control portion and operating the leakage current detecting portion<br>
according to a previously set period.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[21] Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in<br>
detail. However the present invention is not limited to the exemplary embodiments<br>
disclosed below, but can be implemented in various types. Therefore, the present<br>
exemplary embodiments are provided for complete disclosure of the present invention<br>
and to fully inform the scope of the present invention to those ordinarily skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
[22] FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an ELCB with a function for detecting a reverse<br>
leakage current which backflows while cutting off an electric leakage according to one<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 3 is a circuit diagram il-<br>
lustrating the ELCB of FIG. 2.<br>
[23] Referring to FIGs. 2 and 3, the ELCB 100 comprises a breaker portion 110 for<br>
detecting an occurrence of an electric leakage to cut off electrical power, and a leakage<br>
current detecting portion 120 (120a or 120b) for detecting a leakage current which<br>
backflows after electrical power is cut off by the breaking portion 110.<br>
[24] Even though not shown, the breaker portion 110 may comprise a power switching<br>
unit, an electric leakage sensing unit, an electric leakage signal amplifying unit, and a<br>
breaker driving unit as elements for performing a function of a typical ELCB. The<br>
power switching unit, the electric leakage sensing unit, and the breaker driving unit are<br>
similar to those of the ELCB FIG. 1, and thus descriptions on those are omitted.<br>
[25] The leakage current detecting portion 120 (120a or 120b) is arranged to be elec-<br>
trically connected in parallel with the breaker portion 110 between an input terminal<br>
IN (IN1 or IN2) and an output terminal OUT (OUT1 or OUT2) which are installed on<br>
both ends of the breaker portion 110. When an electric leakage occurs, an electric<br>
current does not flow in the breaker portion 110, and so an electric current (leakage<br>
current) which backflows to the ELCB 100 through a ground from an external portion<br>
flows through the leakage current detecting portion 120 (120a or 120b) connected in<br>
parallel with the breaker portion 110.<br>
[26] The leakage current detecting portion 120 (120a or 120b) may comprise a light-<br>
emitting member LED 1 or LED2 for generating light using an electric current and a<br>
first resistor (R1 and R2). Preferably, a light-emitting diode which generates light of<br>
high brightness using a small amount of current is used as a light-emitting member. A<br>
leakage current detected by the leakage current detecting portion 120 (120a or 120b)<br>
can be easily recognized by the naked eye by the light-emitting member LED 1 or<br>
LED2.<br>
[27] The first resistors R1 and R2 are current-limiting resistors for adjusting an electric<br>
current value for generating an electric current enough to have the light-emitting<br>
members LED1 and LED2 to emit light, respectively. Meanwhile, rectifier diodes D1<br>
and D2 may be arranged which are connected in serial to the light-emitting members<br>
LED 1 and LED2 to rectify an AC power of the ELCB 100 into a DC power and to<br>
prevent a reverse current.<br>
[28] As described above, the ELCB 100 of the present invention uses a leakage current<br>
which backflows to the load side of the breaker portion through a ground when an<br>
electric leakage occurs.<br>
[29] That is, the leakage current detecting portion 120 (120a or 120b) can detect a leakage<br>
current in an electric current state that an electric leakage occurs or can not detect a<br>
leakage current in a normal state that an electric leakage state is released. Therefore, it<br>
is possible to determine whether an electric leakage occurs or not according to an<br>
operation of the leakage current detecting portion 120 (120a or 120b).<br>
[30] Meanwhile, in case where a switch of the breaker portion 110 is switched to an OFF<br>
state by a user manipulation, the light-emitting members LED1 and LED2 do not emit<br>
light since a leakage current is not detected by the leakage current detecting portion<br>
120. Therefore, there is an advantage in that it is possible to easily recognize that other<br>
reasons than an electric leakage and a forcible breaking have the breaker portion 110 to<br>
go to a switch OFF state.<br>
[31] FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating an ELCB with a function for detecting a reverse<br>
leakage current which backflows while cutting off an electric leakage according to<br>
another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 5 is a circuit<br>
diagram illustrating the ELCB of FIG. 4.<br>
[32] Referring to FIGs. 4 and 5, the ELCB 200 comprises a breaker portion 210 (210a or<br>
210b), a leakage current detecting portion 220 (220a or 220b), an electric leakage<br>
signal generating portion 230 (230a or 230b) for generating an electric leakage signal,<br>
and an electric leakage control portion 240 for controlling an operation of the breaker<br>
portion 210 (210a or 210b) by using the electric leakage signal.<br>
[33] The breaker portion 210 (210a or 210b) may comprise a switch unit SW1 or SW2<br>
having a fixed contact terminal F1 or F2 and a movable contact terminal M1 or M2, a<br>
power switch unit (not shown), an electric leakage sensing unit (not shown), and a<br>
breaker driving unit (not shown). The breaker portion 210 is similar to that of FIG. 1,<br>
and thus a detailed description on that is omitted.<br>
[34] The leakage current detecting portion 220 (220a or 220b) is electrically connected in<br>
parallel with the breaker portion 210 (210a or 220b) between an input terminal IN 1 or<br>
IN2 and an output terminal OUT1 or OUT2 which are installed on both ends of the<br>
breaker portion 210 (210a or 210b). Therefore, a leakage current which backflows to a<br>
load side of the breaker portion when an electric leakage occurs flows to the leakage<br>
current detecting portion 220 (220a or 220b) electrically connected in parallel with the<br>
breaker portion 210 (210a or 220b).<br>
[35] The leakage current detecting portion 220 (220a or 220b) may comprise a light-<br>
emitting diode D1 or D3 for generating light using an electric current, a first resistor<br>
R or R4 connected serially to the light-emitting diode Dl or D3, and a second resistor<br>
R2 or R5 connected in parallel with the light-emitting diode Dl or D3.<br>
[36] Preferably, a diode with high light-emitting efficiency or high speed is used as the<br>
light-emitting diode D1 or D3 to constitute a photo coupler P1 or P2. The first resistor<br>
R1 or R4 and the second resistor R2 or R5 perform a function for having part of a<br>
leakage current which backflows to a load side to flow to the light-emitting diode D1<br>
or D3 and thus to be used in generating light by the light-emitting diode D1 or D3.<br>
[37] Resistance values of the first resistor R1 or R4 and the second resistor R2 or R5 may<br>
depend on an electric leakage sensitivity and an amplitude of an applied voltage of the<br>
breaker portion 210 (210a or 210b). For example, if an electric leakage sensitivity set<br>
to the ELCB 200 is 30mA, the resistance values of the first resistor Rl or R4 and the<br>
second resistor R2 or R5 are set so that an electric current which flows to the light-<br>
emitting diode D1 or D3 can be about 5mA to 15mA. In other words, the second<br>
resistor R2 or R5 serves as an electric leakage sensitivity adjusting resistor for<br>
adjusting an electric leakage sensitivity of the ELCB 200.<br>
[38] In some cases, the first resistor R1 or R4 may be a resistor of an electrical wire itself,<br>
and the second resistor R2 or R5 may be a current limiting variable resistor. The<br>
leakage current detecting portion 220 (220a or 220b) may further comprise a rectifier<br>
diode D2 or D4 which is connected serially to the light-light emitting member LED<br>
and the first resistor Rl or R4 to rectify an AC power to a DC power and to prevent a<br>
reverse current.<br>
[39] Returning to FIGs. 4 and 5, the electric leakage signal generating 230 (230a or 230b)<br>
is electrically connected to the leakage current detecting portion 220 (220a or 220b) so<br>
that it can generate an electric leakage signal by using a leakage current detected by the<br>
leakage current detecting portion 220 (220a or 220b). The electric leakage control<br>
portion 240 which controls an operation of the breaker portion 210 (210a or 210b) by<br>
using the electric leakage signal is arranged between the electric leakage signal<br>
generating portion 230 (230a or 230b) and the breaker portion 210 (210a or 210b).<br>
Therefore, it is possible to easily control a switching operation of the breaker 210<br>
(210a or 210b) by using a leakage current detected by the leakage current detecting<br>
portion 220 (220a or 220b).<br>
[40] The electric leakage signal generating portion 230 (230a or 230b) may comprise a<br>
first transistor Q1 or Q2 which is formed integrally with the light-emitting diode D1 or<br>
D3 to receive light generated in the light-emitting diode D1 or D3, a third resistor R3<br>
or R6 connected serially to the first transistor Q1 or Q2, and a DC power terminal.<br>
[41] The first transistor Q1 or Q2 is turned on or off according to whether light generated<br>
in the light-emitting diode D1 or D3 exists or not, that is, whether a leakage current<br>
occurs or not. As the third resistor R3 or R6, a resistor which allows an appropriate<br>
current to flow to the first transistor Ql or Q2 is used.<br>
[42] Since the leakage current detecting portion uses an AC power and the electric-<br>
leakage signal generating portion uses a DC power, it is possible to form a photo<br>
coupler PI or P2 to generate an electric leakage signal S1 or S2 from a leakage current.<br>
[43] The electric leakage control portion 240 may perform a driving operation for<br>
releasing a breaking state of the breaker portion 210 (210a or 210b) through an<br>
automatic reset unit 260 connected to the breaker portion 210 (210a or 210b). The<br>
automatic reset unit 260 can employ various driving methods, and the present<br>
invention is not limited to a certain driving method. For example, there are an electro-<br>
magnetic driving method and a motor driving method as the driving method of the<br>
automatic reset unit 260, and an automatic reset method disclosed in Korean Patent no.<br>
0718530 may be used.<br>
[44] A driving operation of the automatic reset unit 260 may be controlled by a controller<br>
250 connected between the electric leakage signal generating portion 230 (230a or<br>
230b) and the automatic reset unit 260. A four (4)-bit micro controller unit (MCU) or a<br>
processor such as a central processing unit (CPU) may be used as the controller 250.<br>
[45] The controller 250 operates as follows. When an electric leakage occurs, the electric<br>
leakage signal S1 or S2 is generated by the electric leakage signal generating portion<br>
230 (230a or 230b) to then be transmitted to the controller 250. At this time, the<br>
controller 250 does not operate the automatic reset unit 260 while keeping detecting an<br>
electric leakage state. On the other hand, when the electric leakage signal S1 or S2 is<br>
no longer input to the controller 250, the controller 250 determines it as an electric<br>
leakage finishing state and operates the automatic reset unit 260 to release the electric<br>
leakage breaking state.<br>
[46] A test portion 270 (270a or 270b) may be arranged between the electric leakage<br>
control portion 240 and the leakage current detecting portion 220 (220a or 220b). The<br>
test portion 270 (270a or 270b) operates the leakage current detecting portion 220<br>
(220a or 220b) by being turned on or off by the electric leakage control portion 240.<br>
[47] The test portion 270 (270a or 270b) may comprise a fourth resistor R7 or R9, a<br>
switching means RL1 or RL2 such as a relay, a second transistor Q3 or Q4, and a fifth<br>
resistor R8 or R10. The electric leakage control portion 240 alternately generate test<br>
signals S3 and S4 at a previously set period or at a desired time to enable a detecting<br>
operation of the leakage current detecting portion 220 (220a or 220b) to thus adjust a<br>
load applied to the leakage current detecting portion 220 (220a or 220b) to a desired<br>
level.<br>
[48] Reference numerals S5 and S6 of FIG. 5 applied to the controller 250 denote an<br>
electric leakage detecting signal and an output power signal, respectively. Even though<br>
not shown in FIG. 5, the electric leakage detecting signal S5 is generated by the<br>
breaker portion 210 (210a or 210b), and the output power signal is generated by<br>
electrical power applied to the controller 250. The automatic reset unit 260 is elec-<br>
trically connected to both of the breaker portions 210a and 210b, and the electric<br>
leakage control portion 240 is electrically connected to both of the test portions 270a<br>
and 270b.<br>
[49] As described above, the ELCBs 100 and 200 according to the exemplary em-<br>
bodiments of the present invention simultaneously cut off two electrical powers<br>
applied, respectively, between a pair of input terminals and output terminals. Since a<br>
leakage current which backflows to a load side can flow to one side of a plus output<br>
terminal or a minus output terminal, it is obvious to person having ordinary skill in the<br>
art that the leakage current detecting portion, the electric leakage signal generating<br>
portion and the test portion are arranged between each input terminal and each output<br>
terminal.<br>
[50] As described above, the ELCB according to the present invention indicates an oc-<br>
currence of a leakage current which backflows from the earth using a light-emitting<br>
means, so that it is possible to rapidly and accurately determine whether a leakage<br>
current or an electric leakage occurs or not.<br>
[51] When an automatic reset means is employed in the ELCB of the present invention, it<br>
is possible to determine whether an electric leakage state is released or not to reset the<br>
ELCB immediately after an electric leakage state is released. Therefore, it is possible<br>
to implement an intelligent ELCB which efficiently operates without forcibly resetting<br>
tens of times or hundreds of time to provide electrical power to a load.<br>
