				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of [l,4,5]-oxadiazepine<br>
derivatives.<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of [1,4,5]-oxadiazepines and to their use as intermediates in the preparation of herbicides of the tetrahydropyrazolo-dione type.<br>
According to PL 123646 and SU 784 264, [1,4,5]-oxadiazepines are prepared by reacting various N,N'-diacylated hydrazines with 2,2'-dichlorodiethyl ether in DMFA as solvent.<br>
It has now been found, surprisingly, that the preparation of [1,4,5]-oxadiazepine derivatives can be significantly improved in respect of yield and purity when the reaction of N,N'-diacyl-hydrazines to form the corresponding 4,5-diacyl-[1,4,5]-oxadiazepines and the further reaction thereof to form the [1,4,5]-oxadiazepines are carried out in certain organic, polar solvents.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates to a process for the preparation of [1,4,5]-oxa-diazepine derivatives by (1) reaction of a N,N'-diacylhydrazine with a 2,2'-disubstituted diethyl ether in a polar solvent in the presence of a base and at elevated temperature to form the corresponding 4,5-diacyl-[1,4,5]-oxadiazepine and (2) optionally reaction of the latter compound with a hydrohalic acid in a polar solvent to form the corresponding [1,4,5]-oxa-diazepine at elevated temperature, wherein in reaction step (1) a solvent selected from the group DMSO, sulfolane, NMP and DMA is used and in reaction step (2) a high-boiling polar solvent is used.<br>
Preferred N,N'-diacylhydrazines correspond to formula I  RrCO-NH-NH-CO-R2 (I), wherein R1 and R2 each independently of the other are hydrogen, C1-C5alkyl, C1-C5haloalkyl, C2-C5-alkenyl, C2-C5alkynyl, phenyl, alkylphenyl, halophenyl, alkoxyphenyl, benzyl, alkylbenzyl, halobenzyl or alkoxybenzyl, or R1and R2 together are C1-C4alkylene, 1,2-phenylene or 1,8-naphthylene.<br>
Preferred 2,2'-disubstituted diethyl ethers correspond to formula II R3-CH2CHR5-0-CHR6CH2-R4 (II), wherein R3 and R4 each independently of the other are halogen or a radical of formula -OS(0)2R7, wherein R7 is C1-C5alkyl, C1-C5haloalkyl, phenyl,<br><br>
alkylphenyl or halophenyl, and R5 and R6 each independently of the other are hydrogen,<br>
C1-C5alkyl, C2-C5alkoxyalkyl, phenyl, alkylphenyl, alkoxyphenyl or halophenyl.<br>
Bases suitable for use in reaction step (1) are especially hydroxides and carbonates and<br>
alcoholates of alkali and alkaline earth metals, especially potassium hydroxide and<br>
potassium carbonate, and mixtures of such bases, especially of potassium hydroxide and<br>
potassium carbonate.<br>
Hydrohalic acids are preferably hydrogen chloride and hydrogen bromide.<br>
Solvents for use in reaction step (1) include DMSO [(CH3)2SO], sulfolane [(CH2)4SO2], NMP<br>
[(CH2)3CONCH3] and DMA [CH3CON(CH3)2] and mixtures thereof, preference being given to<br>
NMP and especially DMSO. In reaction step (2) there are preferably used alcohols having a<br>
boiling point above 100°C, for example n-butanol, n-pentanol, cyclohexanol, phenol, benzyl<br>
alcohol and especially glycol, diethylene glycol, glycerol and C1-C4alkoxy-C1-C4alcohols,<br>
such as methoxyisopropanol and ethoxyethanol.<br>
The alkyl radicals appearing in the substituent definitions of compounds of formulae I and II<br>
contain from 1 to 5 carbon atoms and are, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl or pentyl<br>
and also branched isomers thereof. Alkoxy radicals are derived from the mentioned alkyl<br>
radicals. Alkenyl and alkynyl radicals each have from 2 to 5 carbon atoms and are, for<br>
example, ethenyl, propenyl, ethynyl and propynyl and branched isomers thereof, and also<br>
butenyl, butynyl, pentenyl, pentynyl and branched and di-unsaturated isomers thereof. The<br>
phenyl radicals may be further substituted by alkyl or alkoxy, for example each having from<br>
1 to 4 carbon atoms, which preferably occupy the ortho- or meta- or ortho- and paraposition^).<br>
Halogen is preferably fluorine, chlorine or bromine.<br>
The term "elevated temperature" denotes especially a temperature range of from 30 to<br>
150°C. It is especially advantageous to proceed in a range of from 60 to 100°C in reaction<br>
step (1) and in a range of from 30 to 60°C in reaction step (2).<br>
The N,N'-diacylhydrazines used according to the invention as starting materials are known<br>
and can be obtained in a manner known perse, e.g. as described in PL 123646 B1.<br>
In reaction step (1) it is preferable to use from 1.5 to 4 equivalents of the 2,2'-disubstituted<br>
diethyl ether, based on N,N-diacylhydrazine.<br>
The 4,5-diacyl-[1,4,5]-oxadiazepines obtained in this reaction step can be obtained especially<br>
by precipitation from alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol,<br>
methoxyisopropanol and ethoxyethanol. They are generally obtained in yields of from 40 to<br>
76 % and in a purity of more than 95 %. It is not necessary, however, to isolate those intermediates;<br>
they can be introduced directly into the next step by replacing the solvent of<br>
reaction step (1) by the solvent of reaction step (2).<br>
It may be possible further to improve reaction step (1) in terms of yields by the addition of<br>
potassium iodide, a crown ether, e.g. 18-crown-6, and a phase transfer catalyst, e.g. benzyltriethylammonium<br>
chloride, TBAB and Aliquats.<br>
The hydrohalic acids required for the removal of the acyl (protecting) groups in reaction step<br>
(2) can be added directly by passing them into the reaction mixture. They can, however, also<br>
be produced in situ, for example by utilising the reaction of acid halides, such as acetyl chloride,<br>
with the alcohols present as solvent. Preferably from 2 to 5 equivalents of hydrohalic<br>
acid, based on 4,5-diacyl-[1,4,5]-oxadiazepine, are used.<br>
The yields of isolated [1,4,5]-oxadiazepine salts are generally from 80 to 95 % and, over<br>
both reaction steps, from 60 to 70 %. The purity of the salts is usually about 90 %.<br>
The synthesis of the [1,4,5]-oxadiazepine derivatives is usually carried out by introducing the<br>
N,N'-diacylhydrazine into the polar solvent and then adding an excess of base. The 2,2'-disubstituted<br>
diethyl ether, optionally in excess, is then added at elevated temperature and the<br>
reaction mixture is maintained at that temperature for about from 2 to 4 hours. The mixture<br>
is cooled to room temperature and filtered, and the 4,5-diacyl-[1,4,5]-oxadiazepine is isolated<br>
from the filtrate by concentration by evaporation. That compound is then dissolved or suspended<br>
in a high-boiling alcohol. Hydrohalic acid, optionally in excess, is then passed into<br>
the solution or suspension at a temperature of about 50°C. The reaction mixture is then<br>
maintained at that temperature for a further 12 to 14 hours, degassed, cooled and filtered,<br>
and the residue is washed, yielding the hydrogen halide salt of the [1,4,5]-oxadiazepine.<br>
The process according to the invention can be carried out continuously or batchwise<br>
(discontinuously), batchwise operation being preferred. Both the batchwise reaction<br>
procedure and the continuous reaction procedure are carried out especially in a stirred<br>
vessel or a stirred vessel cascade.<br>
The process according to the invention has the following advantages over the processes of<br>
the prior art:<br>
it can be carried out on an industrial scale<br>
it can be carried out in a multi-purpose apparatus<br>
it yields both the intermediates and the end products in higher purity<br>
it yields both the intermediates and the end products in higher yields<br>
it is not necessary to isolate the intermediates<br>
it allows comparatively low reaction temperatures, especially in reaction step (1)<br>
The [1,4,5]-oxadiazepine derivatives prepared according to the invention are used especially<br>
as intermediates in the preparation of herbicides of the tetrahydropyrazolodione type, which<br>
are described, for example, in WO 99/47525.<br>
The following Examples further illustrate the invention.<br>
Example 1. Preparation of 4,5-diacetyl-[1,4,5]-oxadiazepine<br>
10.6 g of finely pulverised 85 % potassium hydroxide are introduced into a solution of 9.3 g<br>
of N,N'-diacetylhydrazine and 141 g of dimethyl sulfoxide in such a manner that a temperature<br>
of 33°C is not exceeded. After heating to 80 to 85°C, 23 g of 2,2'-dichlorodiethyl ether<br>
are added dropwise to the reaction mixture over the course of 50 minutes. The resulting<br>
highly fluid suspension is maintained at 80 to 85°C for 3 hours, then cooled to 20 to 25°C<br>
and filtered, and the filtration residue is washed with dimethyl sulfoxide. 11.4 g (76.0 %) of<br>
4,5-diacetyl-[1,4,5]-oxadiazepine are obtained from the combined filtrates by concentration<br>
by evaporation.<br>
Example 2. Preparation of 4,5-diacetyl-[1,4,5]-oxadiazepine<br>
105.6 g of finely pulverised potassium hydroxide are introduced into a solution of 92.9 g of<br>
N,N'-diacetylhydrazine and 1410 g of dimethyl sulfoxide. When the heat of reaction has died<br>
away, 229.9 g of 2,2'-dichlorodiethyl ether are added and then 221.1 g of finely ground<br>
potassium carbonate are introduced. The reaction mixture is heated to 70°C and maintained<br>
at 70 to 75°C for 2 hours, then cooled to 20 to 25°C and filtered, and the filtration residue is<br>
washed with dimethyl sulfoxide. Concentration of the combined filtrates by evaporation yields<br>
an oil, to which 157 g of isopropanol are added. After cooling to -10°C, filtration is carried<br>
out and the crystalline residue is washed with isopropanol. After drying of the residue, 99.4 g<br>
(65.1 %) of 4,5-diacetyl-[1,4,5]-oxadiazepine are obtained in a purity of 97.6 %.<br>
Example 3. Preparation of [1,4,5]-oxadiazepine hydrochloride<br>
19.7 g of hydrogen chloride (anhydrous) are passed into a solution of 19.1 g of 4,5-diacetyl-<br>
[1,4,5]-oxadiazepine and 70 g of diethylene glycol over a period of 8 to 10 hours and the<br>
reaction mixture is then maintained at 43 to 45°C for 10 to 12 hours. After the reaction suspension<br>
has been degassed at 40 to 45°C, filtration is carried out at a temperature of 10°C<br>
and the residue is washed with cold methyl acetate. After drying of the residue, 13.2 g<br>
(85.0 %) of [1,4,5]-oxadiazepine hydrochloride are obtained in a purity of 90.0 % with<br>
approximately 8.5 % diethylene glycol bound in the crystals.<br>
Examples 4-8. Preparation of 4,5-diacetyl-[1,4,5]-oxadiazepine<br>
39.6 g of potassium hydroxide powder 85 % (0.6 mol) are introduced into a mixture of 35 g<br>
of diacetylhydrazine (0.3 mol) and 560 ml of solvent (see Table 1). When the heat of<br>
reaction has died away, 85.8 g of 2,2-dichlorodiethyl ether (0.6 mol) are added; the reaction<br>
mixture is heated to 80°C and maintained at 80-90°C for 5 hours. The mixture is then cooled<br>
to 20°C and filtered, and the filtration residue is washed with the solvent. The yield is given<br>
by the content of title compound in the combined filtrate. It will be seen that the solvents<br>
used according to the invention (tests 4-7) give far better yields of 4,5-diacetyl-[1,4,5]-oxadiazepine<br>
than N,N-dimethylformamide, which is known from the above prior art (DMFA,<br>
comparison test 8).<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Examples 9-13. Preparation of 4,5-diacetyl-[1,4,5]-oxadiazepine<br>
A mixture of 35 g of diacetylhydrazine (0.3 mol), 124.4 g or 165.8 g of ground potassium<br>
carbonate (0.9 or 1.2 mol, respectively), 85.8 g of 2,2-dichlorodiethyl ether (0.6 mol) and<br>
560 ml of solvent (see Table 2) is heated to 125°C and maintained at 125-130°C or 80-90°C<br>
(in the case of DMSO) for 5 hours. The mixture is then cooled to 20°C and filtered, and the<br>
filtration residue is washed with the solvent. The yield is given by the content of title compound<br>
in the combined filtrate.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 14. Preparation of 1,2-(phthalyl)diazo-5-oxacycloheptane<br>
39.6 g of potassium hydroxide powder 85 % (0.6 mol) are introduced into a mixture of 49.1 g<br>
of 2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione (0.3 mol) and 616 g of dimethyl sulfoxide. When the<br>
heat of reaction has died away, 85.8 g of 2,2-dichlorodiethyl ether (0.6 mol) are added and<br>
the reaction mixture is heated to 80°C and maintained at 80-90°C for 5 hours. The mixture is<br>
then cooled to 20°C and filtered, and the filtration residue is washed with dimethyl sulfoxide.<br>
The solvent is removed from the combined filtrates by distillation, and 100 g of n-pentanol<br>
are added to the residual oil, the product crystallising out. Filtration and washing of the filtration<br>
residue yields 22.5 g, or 25 %, of the title compound.<br>
Example 15. Preparation of 4,5-diacetyl-[1,4,5]-oxadiazepine<br>
A mixture of 11.6 g of diacetylhydrazine (0.1 mol), 29.0 g of ground potassium carbonate<br>
(0.21 mol), 31.5 g of 2,2-dimesyl diethyl ether (0.12 mol) and 177 g of dimethyl sulfoxide is<br>
heated to 80°C and maintained at 80-85°C for 6 hours. The mixture is then cooled to 20°C<br>
and filtered, and the filtration residue is washed with 50 g of dimethyl sulfoxide. The filtrate is<br>
completely concentrated by evaporation, and 20 ml of water are added to the oily residue.<br>
Extraction three times with ethyl acetate, drying of the combined extracts over sodium<br>
sulfate, concentration by evaporation and crystallisation of the residue from n-pentanol yields<br>
10.8 g, or 58.4 %, of the title compound.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
