POLYPEPTIDE   USING   TWO-STEP   ION EXCHANGE CHROMATOGRAPHY;<br>
SERUM INSTITUTE OF INDIA LIMITED, A COMPANY INCORPORATED UNDER THE COMPANIES ACT, 1956, WHOSE ADDRESS IS "SAROSH BHAVAN" 16-B/1, DR. AMBEDKAR ROAD, PUNE - 411 001, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA.<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
 5 MAR 2004                           GRANTED <br><br>
                   25-3-2004    <br><br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
1. Field of Invention:<br>
The preferred embodiments of the invention relates to a process for purifying a polypeptide from a mixture containing said polypeptide and related or un-related impurities in a two-step ion exchange chromatography process using a conventional step and a negative step in any preferred order.<br>
2. Related (Prior) art:<br>
The biotechnology industry is based on purification of physiologically active proteins from natural sources or genetically engineered proteins from culture or fermentation medium for the manufacture of various commercially useful vaccines, anti-cancer drugs, hormones, blood proteins, therapeutic agents, etc.<br>
For such usage, it is necessary to have the polypeptide in a pure form. Protein purification requires separation of target protein from all other proteins and other impurities taking advantage of the physico-chemical differences between them. One such property is that of charge. Different proteins have different combinations of amino acids giving each protein a unique spread of ionic charges.<br>
Ion exchange chromatography (IEC) is one of the widely practiced purification methods to purify proteins or peptides based on the net charge on the proteins. The IEC can be used in two different methods: anion exchange and cation exchange based on the type of charged ligands of the chromatography matrix.<br>
A conventional IEC method usually consists of one or more stages of: cleaning, regeneration, equilibration, loading, washing, elution, and regeneration. (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1990).<br>
For industrial application of IEC, the elution is achieved by increasing the concentration of salt in an aqueous buffer solution, either as step(s) or linear gradient, optionally controlled by modulating the pH (S. Bj. O slashed.rn and L. Thim, Activation of Coagulation Factor VII to VIIa. Res. Disl. No. 269, 564-565, 1986).<br>
2-<br><br>
In a conventional application of IEC on an industrial level the loading conditions favor the binding of the target protein to chromatography matrix, followed by eluting the said target polypeptide preferentially by altering the ionic strength of the carrier solvent.<br>
In a conventional IEC, on application of the sample the conditions are created to favor the binding of the protein of interest on the chromatography matrix. Alternatively for research purpose, the conventional IEC can be modified so as to favor the binding of the impurities without letting the target protein to bind the matrix (isocratic elution), referred hitherto as negative purification (Crane, A. BIOL 405, Cell Biology, Dr. Keller, Dec. 6, 1999). However, commercial application of negative purification even though possible is not practiced. In the present invention, a novel IEC method based on both principles (the negative and the conventional) have been applied in tandem in any order, for the purification of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In contrast to the conventional single-stage IEC method of purifying target polypeptide by preferential binding followed by changing solvent conditions in step(s) or linear gradient that favor preferential elution, the present invention relates to a novel two-stage ion exchange chromatography process and relates to the following aspects:<br>

Appropriate salt component is used to achieve the desired ionic strength of the elution solution. Changing the pH and thereby altering the charge of the molecule is another way to achieve binding and elution of the molecule (target protein/ impurities). In the preferred embodiment of the invention, a single parameter (that is either conductivity or pH) is changed to achieve elution of both the polypeptide and contaminant, while the other parameter (that is pH or conductivity, respectively) remaining constant. For example, while the conductivity of the various solutions (such as loading solution, washing solution, elution solution, regeneration solution and equilibration solution) may differ, the pH of these solutions may be essentially the same.<br>

Each of these proteins, polypeptides, and their combinations as well as their homologues, analogs and derivatives thereof, constitutes an alternative embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Aspect 23:<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to a mixture comprising of the target polypeptide, optionally modified chemically by conventional techniques such as alkylation, acylatation, esterification or amide formation or the like, so as to aid in the separation of impurities from the target substance and is one aspect of the present invention to any derivatization of proteins or polypeptides such as active site blockage using cholomethyl ketone (S. Higashi, H. Nishimura, S. Fuiji, K. Takada, S, Iwanaga, 1992. J. Biol. Chem. 267, 17990; J. H. Lavvson, S. Butenas, K. Mann, 1992. J. Biol. Chem. 267, 4834; J. Contrino, G. A. Hair, M. A. Schimeizl, F. R. Rickles, D. L. Kreutzer, 1994. Am. J. Pathol. 145, 1315); so as to block the active sites or protect the target protein from proteases.<br>
11<br><br>
Aspect 24:<br>
Peptides can be produced on an industrial scale according to conventional organic peptide-synthesis chemistry' either as native peptide or a mixture of their homologues, analogs or derivatives.<br>
Industrial-scale polypeptide production can also be achieved using Continuous Exchange Cell-free Rapid Translation System (ProteoMaster from Roche Applied Systems, Penzberg Germany).<br>
Polypeptides can also be produced by a method which comprises of cultiiring or fermenting a host cell containing the DNA sequence(s) introduced in to the host cell by suitable standard techniques (e.g. Sambrook, J, Fritseh, E. F. and Maniatis, T. Molecular Cloning; A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York, 1989) encoding, usually one, or at times more than one, polypeptide or protein under suitable nutrient medium conditions permitting the expression of the protein(s) or polypeptide(s), after which the resulting polypeptide is recovered from the culture or fermentation broth or transgenic animals expressing the target protein in mammary glands.<br>
The DNA sequence encoding the parent peptide encoding a part of the target polypeptide may be of genomic or cDNA origin prepared either by polymerase chain reaction using suitable primers (Burden and Whitney, Biotechnology: Proteins to PCR: A course in Strategies and Lab Techniques, 1995) or cloned in a suitable vector (e.g. as described in Sambrook, J., Fritseh, E.F. and Maniatis, T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory' Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York, 1989) or synthesized by established chemical methods (e.g. Beaucage and Caruthers, Tetrahedron Letters 22 (1981), 1859-1869; Matthes et al. EMBO Journal 3 (1984), 801-805) The nucleic acid encoding the target polypeptide is isolated by any of these techniques is inserted into a replicable vector for expression. The vector components generally include, but not limited to, one or more of the following: a signal sequence, a promoter sequence, autonomous replication sequence, one or more marker genes, a termination sequence (e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5389525)<br>
The medium used to culture the cells may be any conventional medium suitable for growing the host cells, such as minimal or complex media containing appropriate supplements as available from commercial suppliers or as published recipes (e.g.  Difco  Manual).  The  polypeptide  produced  by the  cell  may be<br>
12<br><br>
intracellular or secreted by the cells and may be recovered by disrupting the cells in presence of protease inhibitor(s) or by purifying the extra-cellular polypeptide from the cell-free culture medium, respectively.<br>
Aspect 25:<br>
The conventional down-stream processing methods are then employed for the purification of polypeptides arising out of any one of the industrial production methods described in aspect-24. The down-stream processing includes one or more steps, for example, centrifugation or filtration to recover either the culture supernatant (if the target polypeptide is secreted by the cells) or the cells (if the target polypeptide is intracellular). For the latter proteins, the first step of a purification process involves disruption of cells by one or more passages through any of the known mechanical disruption devices such as the glass ball mill (e.g. DynoMill and Fryma Coball Mill), high pressure homogenizer (e.g. Nanojet), by enzymatic treatment or osmotic shock method to release the intracellular protein, optionally in presence of a protease inhibitor, optionally precipitating the proteinaceous components present in the homogenate or culture supernatant by means of one or more precipitating agents such as ammonium sulphate, polyethylene glycol, urea so as to precipitate out preferentially the target protein or the impurities excluding the target protein, The resulting precipitated solution is clarified by means of differential centrifugation or by filtration and subsequently subjected the supernatant or filtrate to one or more chromatographic techniques such as hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC), size-exclusion or gel-filtration chromatography (GFC), reverse-phase chromatography, affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography (IEC) according to the present invention, and optionally subjecting to further purification steps, if necessary, by any of the known techniques. Exemplary further purification steps include but not restricted to, filtration, iso-pycnic or equilibrium density gradient centrifugation, sterilization and others. The sequential order of the purification steps, based on the characteristics of the target polypeptide and on the characteristics of the related or unrelated impurities accompanying the polypeptide of interest, may vary. Thus, in a broad aspect, any industrial process comprising one or more steps described herein, for production of a pure target polypeptide, which also includes an IEC process according to the present invention, is within the embodiment of the present application.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE EXAMPLES:<br>
The present invention is illustrated by the following examples, which, are not to be construed as limiting the scope of protection.<br>
Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), a particulate lipoprotein, was expressed in a methylotrophic yeast Hamemda polymorpha K3 / 8-1 (EP 173378) by conventional recombinant DNA technology. The recombinant yeast strain was fennented in synthetic media using limiting feeds of glycerol or methanol or mixture of glycerol and methanol to achieve an optimum expression of HBsAg under the control of formate dehydrogenase promoter. The fermentation was carried out in three phases: an initial growth phase with higher glycerol concentration (2.0 to 2.5%v-glycerol/v-broth), was followed by derepression phase with dissolved-oxygen-dependent glycerol feeding as the sole carbon source and the final methanol induction phase with time-based feeding of glycerol and methanol (0.1-1.0%v-glycerol/v-broth and 0.5-8.0%v- methanol/v-broth). Upon completion of the fennentation process the cells are separated from the medium components by either tangential-flow micro-filtration system or centrifugation followed by disruption in a glass-bead mill (e.g. Dyno Mill KD20) at a cell density of 50-150 g. dry cell weight / litre in presence of a protease inhibitor (PMSF). The disrupted cells are precipitated using polyethylene glycol to remove cell debris and impurities by removing the precipitate by centrifugation followed by trapping and desorption of the antigen from fused silica (Aerosil 380 V) hitherto referred as the desorbate. The desorbate is adjusted for conductivity prior to ion exchange chromatography as described herein:<br>
EXAMPLE-1: Anion exchange chromatography - Stage (a) followed by Stage (b):<br>
Stage (a)- Negative TEC:<br>
The conductivity of the desorbate, containing the target protein (HBsAg) at a concentration of 0.1 - 1.5 mg/ml, preferably at 0.3 to 1.0 mg/ml and having total protein content of 0.5 - 2.0 mg/ml, preferably 0.8 to 1.4 mg/ml, was adjusted to 13-16 mS/cm by addition of 5 M NaCl before loading on the chromatography column containing Toyopearl DEAE 650M (TosoHass) anion exchanger at a flow rate of 76 cm per hour. The resulting flow through (that is unbound fraction) was collected, followed by passing 2 column volumes of washing buffer, 2 column volumes of elution solution-I containing 0.2 M NaCl in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH<br>
IS<br><br>
8.5 and conductivity of 18-22 mS/cm, 2 column volumes of elution solution-II containing 0.2 M NaCl in 50mM Tris buffer, pH 8.5 and conductivity of 50 mS/cm, cleaned with 2 column volumes of 0.5 M NaOH in water, regenerated with 2 column volumes of elution solution-II and equilibrated with 2 column volumes of 50mM Tris at pH 8.5 and conductivity of 2.0 mS/cm.<br>
Stage (b) - Conventional IEC.<br>
The flow-through (unbound fraction) obtained in stage (a) was diluted with loading buffer to give a final conductivity of 10 (+/-2 mS/cm) before loading on a cleaned, regenerated and equilibrated chromatography column containing Toyopearl DEAE 650M (TosoHass) anion exchanger at a flow rate of 76 cm per hour, followed by passing sequentially: 2 column volumes of 50mM Tris at pH 8.5 and conductivity of 8 mS/cm, 2 column volumes of elution buffer-I and 2 column volumes of elution buffer-II. The individual fractions collected for each buffer passed through the column was analyzed separately for protein, HBsAg, DNA, lipid and protein impurities using SDA-PAGE. For each solution passed, absorbance (at 280 nm) and conductivity using on-line detectors was recorded.<br>
Total protein and HBsAg concentrations of each chromatography fraction (flow through, wash fraction, elution buffer-I fraction, elution buffer-II fraction) was detennined on the basis of UV spectrophotometer scans of each sample and from the A28o value, the concentration of protein and HBsAg was detennined from the fonnula:<br>
Protein concentration in the Desorbate	= A280 X Dilution factor X 3.5*<br>
HBsAg concentration in the Desorbate	= A2so X Dilution factor X 6.0*<br>
Protein concentration in IEC eluate buffer-I = A2so X Dilution factor X 3.5*<br>
HBsAg concentration in IEC eluate buffer-I = A28oX Dilution factor X 5.0*<br>
^Extinction coefficient<br>
19<br><br>
EXAMPLE-2: Anion exchange chromatography -Stage (b) followed by Stage (a):<br>
The same desorbate used in Example-1 was purified by reversing the two stages, that is stage (b) prior to stage (a).<br>
Stage (b) - Conventional IEC.<br>
The desorbate conductivity was adjusted to 8 mS/cm using 1 M NaCl and buffered with 50 raM Tris at pH 8.5, prior to loading on a pre-equilibrated reduced-scale column containing at a flow rate of 76 cm per hour, followed by passing sequentially: 2 column volumes of 50mM Tris at pH 8.5 and conductivity of 8 mS/cm, 2 column volumes of elution buffer-I containing 0.2 M NaCl in 50mM Tris buffer, pH 8.5 and conductivity of 18-22 mS/cm, and 2 column volumes of elution buffer-II containing 0.2 M NaCl in 50mM Tris buffer, pH 8.5 and conductivity of 50 mS/cm. The individual fractions collected for each buffer passed through the column was analyzed separately for protein, HBsAg, DNA, lipid and protein impurities using SDA-PAGE. For each solution passed, absorbance (at 280 nm) and conductivity using on-line detectors was recorded.<br>
The resulting elution buffer-1 fraction from the column was collected and purified further by concentrating on a tangential-flow ultra-filtration system using a 300kDa nominal cut-off membrane and subjecting the concentrate to cesium chloride equilibrium density gradient centrifugation (at 45000 rpm for 42 hours), followed by gel-filtration (or size exclusion) chromatography.<br>
Stage (a)- Negative IEC:<br>
In a separate study, the resulting elution buffer-I fraction from the anion exchange column [Example 2, Stage (b)] was collected and diluted with 50 mM Tris (pH 8.5) to give a conductivity of 13-16 mS/cm prior to loading on a cleaned, regenerated and equilibrated chromatography column containing Toyopearl DEAE 650M (TosoHass) anion exchanger at a flow rate of 76 cm per hour. The loading was followed by passing sequentially through the matrix: 2 column volumes of 50mM Tris at pH 8.5 and conductivity of 8 mS/cm, 2 column volumes of elution buffer-I, followed by 2 column volumes of elution buffer-II. Out flowing material from the column was separately collected and analyzed for each of the buffers passed.<br>
20<br><br>
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:<br>
The target protein was eluted and collected as a single peak and analyzed for protein impurities by SDS-PAGE, Ratio of A280/A260, Size-exclusion chromatography, Ratio of HBsAg to protein content and DNA content.<br>
The above-described two-stage method gave higher level of purity (e.g. 95% as compared to 75%) with similar yield of the target polypeptide in comparison with the single-stage conventional anion exchange chromatography as described above in Stage (b) as shown in TABLE-1.<br>
There was a considerable improvement in the step yield of HBsAg (up to 200%) when the eluate from the two-stage anion exchange chromatography was concentrated on a cross-flow ultra-filtration membrane (of 300kDa nominal cut off) and subjected to cesium chloride equilibrium density gradient centrifligation (at 45000 rpm for 40 hours) when compared with the recovery of HBsAg purified using a conventional anion exchange chromatography [EXAMPLE-2, Stage (b)] and further purified using an identical purification scheme of ultra-filtration and density gradient centrifugation (TABLE-1).<br>
