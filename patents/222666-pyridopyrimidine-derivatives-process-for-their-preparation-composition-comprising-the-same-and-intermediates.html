FUNGICIDES<br>
This invention relates to novel derivatives of pyridopyrimidines, to processes for preparing them, to certain intermediate chemicals used in their manufacture, to compositions containing them and to methods of using them to combat fungi, especially fungal infections of plants.<br>
Derivatives of the nitrogen-containing 5,6 ring system s-l,2.4-triazoIo[l,5-a]pyri-midine are known from the patent literature as being useful for controlling phytopathogenic fungi. Examples of recent patent publications include EP-A-1249452. WO 02/051845, WO 02/083676, WO 02/0S3677, WO 02/088125, WO 02/0S8126, WO 02/0S8127. Certain derivatives of pyridopyrimidines are described, for example, in US 5597776 and WO 01/17972 as herbicide antagonists. Others are known for pharmaceutical applications (see, for example, J. Med. Chem. (1983), 26(3), 403).<br>
The present invention is concerned with the provision of novel pyridopyriTnidines for combating phytopathogenic diseases on plants and harvested food crops. Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided a compound of the general formula (1):<br>

The compounds of the invention may contain one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and may exist as enantiomers (or as pairs of diastereoisomers) or as mixtures of such. They may also exist as diastereoisomers by virtue of restricted rotation about a bond. However, mixtures of enantiomers or diastereoisomers may be separated into individual isomers or isomer pairs, and this invention embraces such isomers and mixtures thereof in all proportions. It is to be expected that for any given compound, one isomer may be more fungicidally active than another.<br>

Cycloalkyl groups contain from 3 to 8, typically from 3 to 6, carbon atams and include bicycloalkyl groups such as the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptyl group. Haloalkyl groups or moieties are typically trichloromethyl or trifluoromethyl or contain a trichloromethyl or trifluoromethyl teR""inal group.<br>
Except where otherwise stated, alkenyl and alkynyl moieties also contain from 2 to 8, suitably from 2 to 6 and typically from 2 to 4, carbon atoms in the foR"" of straight or branched chains. Examples are allyl, 2-methylallyl and propargyl. Optional substituents include halo, typically fluoro. An example of halo-substituted alkenyl is 3,4,4-trifluoro-/z-butenyl.<br>
Halo includes fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. Most commonly it is fluoro, chloro or bromo and usually fluoro or chloro.<br>
Aryl is usually phenyl but also includes naphthyl, anthryl and phenanthryl.<br>
Heteroaryl is typically a 5- or"6-membered aromatic ring containing one or more O, N or S heteroatoms, which may be fused to one or more other aromatic or heteroaromatic rings, such as a benzene ring. Examples are thienyl, furyl, pyrrolyl, isoxazolyl, oxazolyl,<br><br>
benzothiazolyl, benzoxazolyl, benzimidazolyl, indolyl, quinolinyl and quinoxalinyl groups and, where appropriate, N-oxides thereof.<br>
The 6,6-ring systems embraced by the general foR""ula (1) are pyrido[2,3-d]pyri-midines (where W and Y are both CRS and X and Z are both N) and pyrido[3,2-d]pyri-midines (where X and Z are both CR8 and W and Y are both N).<br>

Compounds of general foR""ula (12) can be prepared by reaction of compounds of general foR""ula (11) with a chlorination reagent such as phosphorus oxychloride, either neat or in a suitable solvent such as toluene, at between 50 and 150°C, but preferably between 80 and 110°C, or in a microwave reactor at between 150 and 300°C, but preferably between 200 and 250°C. Compounds of foR""ula (7) can be prepared from compounds of foR""ula (12) by reductive amination, for example by reaction with a ketone or aldehyde in a suitable solvent such as ethanol or toluene, at between room temperature and reflux, optionally in the presence of an acid catalyst such as para-toluenesulphonic acid or a drying agent such as molecular sieves, followed by treatment with a suitable reducing agent such as sodium borohydride, at between -20°C and 40°C, but preferably at room temperature. The aldehyde or ketone is chosen so that the desired groups R3 and R4 are foR""ed after reduction of the product of reaction with the amine (12).

If required, the reaction can be repeated with a different aldehyde or ketone. For example, if acetone is used for the second reaction, then compounds of foR""ula (7) where R3 is N-propyl and R is iso-propyl, are foR""ed. Alternatively compounds of foR""ula (7) can be foR""ed from compounds of foR""ula (12) by alkylation with a group R3LG, where LG is a leaving group, by treatment with a suitable base such as sodium hydride in a solvent such as DMF, or a base such as potassium carbonate in a solvent such as acetone or DMF, at between -7S°C and 100°C, but preferably between room temperatureand 60°C, followed by treatment with R4TG in a second step under the same conditions if required.<br><br><br>

Compounds of general foR""ula (22) where Rn is hydrogen or Cj.^ alkyl, can be foR""ed by reaction of compounds of general foR""ula (16) with an alkyl acetylene under the Sonogashira conditions, for example with 1-propyne in triethylamine in the presence of a cuprous salt such as cuprous iodide and a palladium catalyst such as Pd(Ph)4, between room temperature and 70°C. Compounds of general foR""ula (23) where R/2 is hydrogen or C1-6 alkyl, can be foR""ed by reaction of compounds of general foR""ula (16) with an alkenyl metal derivative in a suitable solvent, such as ethenylboronic acid in THF, in the presence of a palladium catalyst such as Pd(Ph)4 and a base such as caesium carbonate, between room temperature and 65°C.<br><br>

The invention therefore provides a method of combating or controlling phytopatho-genie fungi which comprises applying a fungicidally effective amount of a compound of formula (1), or a composition containing a compound of formula (1), to a plant, to a seed of a plant, to the locus of the plant or seed or to soil or any other plant growth medium, e.g. nutrient solution.<br>
The term "plant" as used herein includes seedlings, bushes and trees. Furthermore, the fungicidal method of the invention includes protectant, curative, systemic, eradicant and antisporulant treatments.<br>
The compounds of formula (1) are preferably used for agricultural, horticultural and turfgrass purposes in the form of a composition.<br>
In order to apply a compound of formula (1) to a plant; to a seed of a plant, to the locus of the plant or seed or to soil or any other growth medium, a compound of formula (1) is usually formulated into a composition which includes, in addition to the compound of formula (1), a suitable inert diluent or carrier and, optionally, a surface active agent (SFA). SFAs are chemicals that are able to modify the properties of an interface (for example, liquid/solid, liquid/air or liquid/liquid interfaces) by lowering the interfacial tension and thereby leading to changes in other properties (for example dispersion, emulsification and wetting). It is preferred that all compositions (both solid and liquid formulations) comprise, by weight, 0.0001 to 95%, more preferably 1 to S5%, for example 5 to 60%, of a compound of formula (1). The composition is generally used for the control of fungi such that a compound of formula (1) is applied at a rate of from 0. lg tol 0kg per hectare, preferably from lg to 6kg per hectare, more preferably from lg to 1kg per hectare.<br>
When used in a seed dressing, a compound of formula (1) is used at a rate of 0.000lg to lOg (for example 0.001 g or 0.05g), preferably 0.005g to 10g, more preferably 0.005 g to 4g, per kilogram of seed.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a fungicidal composition comprising a fungicidally effective amount of a compound of formula (1) and a suitable carrier or diluent therefor.<br>
In a still further aspect the invention provides a method of combating and controlling fungi at a locus, which comprises treating the fungi, or the locus of the fungi with a<br><br>
The compositions can be chosen from a number of formulation types, including dustable powders (DP), soluble powders (SP), water soluble granules (SG), water dispersible granules (WG), wettable powders (WP), granules (GR) (slow or fast release), soluble concentrates (SL), oil miscible liquids (OL), ultra low volume liquids (UL), emulsifiable concentrates (EC), dispersible concentrates (DC), emulsions (both oil in water (EW) and water in oil (EO)), micro-emulsions (ME), suspension concentrates (SC), aerosols, fogging/smoke formulations, capsule suspensions (CS) and seed treatment formulations. The formulation type chosen in any instance will depend upon the particular purpose envisaged and the physical, chemical and biological properties of the compound of formula (1).<br>
Dustable powders (DP) maybe prepared by mixing a compound of formula (1) with one or more solid diluents (for example natural clays, kaolin, pyrophyllite, bentonite, alumina, montmorillonite, kieselguhr, chalk, diatomaceous earths, calcium phosphates, calcium and magnesium carbonates, sulphur, lime, flours, talc and other organic and inorganic solid carriers) and mechanically grinding the mixture to a fine powder.<br>
Soluble powders (SP) may be prepared by mixing a compound of formula (1) with one or more water-soluble inorganic salts (such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate or magnesium sulphate) or one or more water-soluble organic solids (such as a polysaccharide) and, optionally, one or more wetting agents, one or more dispersing agents or a mixture of said agents to improve water dispersibility/solubility. The mixture is then ground to a fine powder. Similar compositions may also be granulated to form water soluble granules (SG).<br>
Wettable powders (WP) may be prepared by mixing a compound of formula (1) with one or more solid diluents or carriers, one or more wetting agents and, preferably, one or more dispersing agents and, optionally, one or more suspending agents to facilitate the dispersion in liquids. The mixture is then ground to a fine powder. Similar compositions may also be granulated to form water dispersible granules (WG).<br>
Granules (GR) may be formed either by granulating a mixture of a compound of formula (1) and one or more powdered solid diluents or carriers? or from pre-formed blank granules by absorbing a compound of formula (1) (or a solution thereof, in a suitable agent) in a porous granular material (such as pumice, attapulgite clays, fuller's earth, kieselguhr,<br><br>
commonly used to aid absorption or adsorption include solvents (such as aliphatic and aromatic petroleum solvents, alcohols, ethers, ketones and esters) and sticking agents (such as polyvinyl acetates, polyvinyl alcohols, dextrins, sugars and vegetable oils). One or more other additives may also be included in granules (for example an emulsifying agent, wetting agent or dispersing agent).<br>
Dispersible Concentrates (DC) may be prepared by dissolving a compound of formula (1) in water or an organic solvent, such as a ketone, alcohol or glycol ether. These solutions may contain a surface active agent (for example to improve water dilution or prevent crystallisation in a spray tank).<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates (EC) or oil-in-water emulsions (EW) may be prepared by dissolving a compound of formula (1) in an organic solvent (optionally containing one or more wetting agents, one or more emulsifying agents or a mixture of said agents). Suitable organic solvents for use in ECs include aromatic hydrocarbons (such as alkylbenzenes or alkylnaphthalenes, exemplified by SOLVESSO 100, SOLVESSO 150 and SOLVESSO 200; SOLVESSO is a Registered Trade Mark), ketones (such as cyclohexanone or methylcyclo-hexanone), alcohols (such as benzyl alcohol, furfuryl alcohol or butanol), Af-alkylpyr-rolidones (such as TV-methylpyrrolidone or 7V-octylpyrrolidone), dimethyl amides of fatty acids (such as Cs-Cio fatty acid diethylamide) and chlorinated hydrocarbons. An EC product may spontaneously emulsify on addition to water, to produce an emulsion with sufficient stability to allow spray application through appropriate equipment. Preparation of an EW involves obtaining a compound of formula (1) either as a liquid (if it is not a liquid at room temperature, it may be melted at a reasonable temperature, typically below 70°C) or in solution (by dissolving it in an appropriate solvent) and then emulsifying the resultant liquid or solution into water containing one or more SFAs, under high shear, to produce an emulsion. Suitable solvents for use in EWs include vegetable oils, chlorinated hydrocarbons (such as chlorobenzenes), aromatic solvents (such as alkylbenzenes or alkylnaphthalenes) and other appropriate organic solvents that have a low solubility in water.<br>
Microemulsions (ME) may be prepared by mixing water with a blend of one or more solvents with one or more SFAs, to produce spontaneously a thermodynamically stable isotropic liquid formulation. A compound of formula (1) is present initially in either the<br><br>
system (which system is present may be determined by conductivity measurements) and may be suitable for mixing water-soluble and oil-soluble pesticides in the same formulation. An ME is suitable for dilution into water, either remaining as a microemulsion or forming a conventional oil-in-v.ater emulsion.<br>
Suspension concentrates (SC) may comprise aqueous or non-aqueous suspensions of finely divided insoluble solid particles of a compound of formula (1). SCs may be prepared by ball or bead milling the solid compound of formula (3) in a suitable medium, optionally with one or more dispersing agents, to produce a fine particle suspension of the compound. One or more wetting agents may be included in the composition and a suspending agent may be included to reduce the rate at which the particles settle- Alternatively, a compound of formula (1) may be dry milled and added to water, containing agents hereinbefore described, to produce the desired end product.<br>
Aerosol formulations comprise a compound of formula (1) and a suitable propellant (for example /z-butane). A compound of formula (1) may also be dissolved or dispersed in a suitable medium (for example water or a water miscible liquid, such as /2-propanoI) to provide compositions for use in non-pressurised, hand-actuated spray pumps.<br>
A compound of formula (1) maybe mixed in the dry state with a pyrotechnic mixture to form a composition suitable for generating, in an enclosed space, a smoke containing the compound.<br>
Capsule suspensions (CS) may be prepared in a manner similar to the preparation of EW formulations but with an additional polymerisation stage such that an aqueous dispersion of oil droplets is obtained, in which each oil droplet is encapsulated by a polymeric shell and contains a compound of formula (1) and, optionally, a carrier or diluent therefor. The polymeric shell maybe produced by either an interfacial polycondensation reaction or by a coacervation procedure. The compositions may provide for controlled release of the compound of formula (1) and they may be used for seed treatment. A compound of formula (1) may also be formulated in a biodegradable polymeric matrix to provide a slow, controlled release of the compound.<br><br>
example certain mineral oils or natural plant oils (such as soy bean and rape seed oil), and blends of these with other bio-enhancing adjuvants (ingredients which may aid or modify the action of a compound of formula (1)).<br>
A compound of formula (1) may also be formulated for use as a seed treatment, for example as a powder composition, including a powder for dry seed treatment (DS), a water soluble powder (SS) or a water dispersible powder for slurry treatment (WS), or as a liquid composition, including a flowable concentrate (FS), a solution (LS) or a capsule suspension (CS). The preparations of DS, SS, WS, FS and LS compositions are very similar to those of, respectively, DP, SP? WP, SC and DC compositions described above. Compositions for treating seed may include an agent for assisting the adhesion of the composition to the seed (for example a mineral oil or a film-forming barrier).<br>
Wetting agents, dispersing agents and emulsifying agents may be SFAs of the   -cationic, anionic, amphoteric or non-ionic type.<br>
Suitable SFAs of the cationic type include quaternary ammonium compounds (for example cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide), imidazolines and amine salts.<br>
Suitable anionic SFAs include alkali metals salts of fatty acids, salts of aliphatic monoesters of sulphuric acid (for example sodium lauryl sulphate), salts of sulphonated aromatic compounds (for example sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, calcium dodecyl-benzenesulphonate, butylnaphthalene sulphonate and mixtures of sodium di~isopropyl- and tri-/5^propyl-naphthalene sulphonates), ether sulphates, alcohol ether sulphates (for example sodium laureth-3-sulphate), ether carboxylates (for example sodium Iaureth-3-carboxylate), phosphate esters (products from the reaction between one or more fatty alcohols and phosphoric acid (predominately mono-esters) or phosphorus pentoxide (predominately di-esters), for example the reaction between lauryl alcohol and tetraphosphoric acid; additionally these products may be ethoxylated), sulphosuccinamates, paraffin or olefine sulphonates, taurates and lignosulphonates.<br>
Suitable SFAs of the amphoteric type include betaines, propionates and glycinates.<br>
Suitable SFAs of the non-ionic type include condensation products of alkylene oxides, such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide or mixtures thereof, with fatty alcohols (such as oleyl alcohol or cetyl alcohol) or with alkylphenols (such as octylphenol,<br><br>
(comprising ethylene oxide and propylene oxide); alkanolamides; simple esters (for example fatty acid polyethylene glycol esters); amine oxides (for example Iauryl dimethyl amine oxide); and lecithins.<br>
Suitable suspending agents include hydrophilic colloids (such as polysaccharides, polyvinylpyrrolidone or sodium carbox#methylceliulose)-and swelling clays (such as bentonite or attapulgite).<br>
A compound of formula (1) may be applied by any of the known means of applying fungicidal compounds. For example, it may be applied, formulated or unformulated, to any part of the plant, including the foliage, stems, branches or roots, to the seed before it is planted or to other media in which plants are growing or are to be planted (such as soil surrounding the roots, the soil generally, paddy water or hydroponic culture systems), directly or it may be sprayed on, dusted on, applied by dipping, applied as a cream or paste formulation, applied as a vapour or applied through distribution or incorporation of a composition (such as a granular composition or a composition packed in a water-soluble bag) in soil or an aqueous environment.<br>
A compound of formula (1) may also be injected into plants or sprayed onto vegetation using electrodynamic spraying techniques or other low volume methods, or applied by land or aerial irrigation systems.<br>
Compositions for use as aqueous preparations (aqueous solutions or dispersions) are generally supplied in the form of a concentrate containing a high proportion of the active ingredient, the concentrate being added to water before use. These concentrates, which may include DCs, SCs, ECs, EWs, MEs SGs, SPs, WPs, WGs and CSs, are often required to withstand storage for prolonged periods and, after such storage, to be capable of addition to water to form aqueous preparations which remain homogeneous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. Such aqueous preparations may contain varying amounts of a compound of formula (1) (for example 0.0001 to 10%, by weight) depending upon the purpose for which they are to be used.<br>
A compound of formula (1) may be used in mixtures with fertilisers (for example nitrogen-, potassium- or phosphorus-containing fertilisers). Suitable formulation types<br><br>
The invention therefore also provides s fertiliser composition comprising a fertiliser and a compound of formula (1).<br>
The compositions of this invention may contain other compounds having biological activity, for example micronutrients or compounds having similar or complementary fungicidal activity or which possess plant growth regulating, herbicidai, insecticidal, nematicidal or acaricidal activity.<br>
By including another fungicide, the resulting composition may have a broader spectrum of activity or a greater level of intrinsic activity than the compound of formula (1) alone. Further the other fungicide may have a synergistic effect on the fungicidal activity of the compound of formula (1).<br>
The compound of formula (1) may be-the sole active ingredient of the composition or it may be admixed with one or more additional active ingredients such as a pesticide, fungicide, synergist, herbicide or plant growth regulator where appropriate. An additional active ingredient may: provide a composition having a broader spectrum of activity or increased persistence at a locus; synergise the activity or complement the activity (for example by increasing the speed of effect or overcoming repellency) of the compound of formula (1); or help to overcome or prevent the development of resistance to individual components. The particular additional active ingredient will depend upon the intended utility of the composition.<br>

The compounds of formula (1) may be mixed with soil, peat or other rooting media for the protection of plants against seed-borne, soil-borne or foliar fungal diseases.<br>
Some mixtures may comprise active ingredients, which have significantly different physical, chemical or biological properties such that they do not easily lend themselves to the same conventional formulation type. In these circumstances other formulation types may be prepared. For example, where one active ingredient is a water insoluble solid and the other a water insoluble liquid, it may nevertheless be possible to disperse each active ingredient in the same continuous aqueous phase by dispersing the solid active ingredient as a suspension (using a preparation analogous to that of an SC) but dispersing the liquid active ingredient as an emulsion (using a preparation analogous to that of an EW). The resultant composition is a suspoemulsion (SE) formulation.<br><br><br>
