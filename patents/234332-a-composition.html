				<td>The present invention relates to a composition.<br>
The present invention relates inter alia to the treatment of demyelinating disorders and neurodegenerative diseases and to compositions for such use.<br>
The majority of excitatory synaptic responses in mammalian CNS are elicited by amino acids such as L-gmtamate or L-aspartate, which participate in nerve functions including recognition, memory, movement, respiration, cardiovascular adjustment and sensation. In the expression of their physiological activity, an interaction with a specific receptor is important. These receptors can be classified into four different receptor subtypes. Three of these receptors are coupled to ionophores and are known as the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), the AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate), and the kainate receptors. The fourth receptor subtype is linked to phosphoinositol metabolism and is known as the metabotropic glutamate receptor.<br>
The NMDA receptor is coupled to high conductance channels permeable to Na+, K+, and Ca2+. It is modulated by glycine (coagonist) and polyamines (positive modulator) and is<br>
blocked in a use- and voltage dependent manner by Mg2+, The functional NMDA receptor is thought to be formed as a pentameric subunit assembly consisting of subunit selection from NRl (eight isoforms) and NR2 (fourlsoforms) families. The type of subunits forming the NMDA channel determine its biophysical properties and physiological function. The<br>
AMPA and kainate receptors are permeable to Na+ and K+ AMPA receptor-dependent ion channel is formed from four different subunits designated as GluRl to GluR4 (in two alternative splice variants - flip and flop) in a tetrameric subunit assembly. Pharmacological properties of AMPA receptor-dependent ion channels are determined by the selection of subunits. Channel assemblies lacking GluR2 subunits are permeable to<br>
Ca2+ in addition to Na+- and K+-permeability. In situ hybridization has revealed different expression of glutamate receptor subunits throughout the brain and during development.<br>
The amino acid as an excitatory neurotransmitter has been known to induce neurotoxicity by, for example, abnormal excitation of central nerves. It has been noted that the said toxicity is as serious as being accompanied by the death of nerve cells causing various<br>
nervous diseases. Main nervous diseases which have been known are cerebral ischemia, head injury, spinal injury, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's chorea, AIDS nervous disturbance, epilepsy, neurodegeneration observed after the state of hypoxia, mental disorder, mobility disturbance, pain, spasticity, nervous disturbance by toxin in food, various neurodegenerative diseases, various mental diseases, chronic pain, migraine, carcinomatous pain and pain caused by diabetic nervous disturbance. They are serious diseases where many mechanisms of onset, etc. have not yet been clarified and effective therapeutic pharmaceutical agents have not yet been found, but it is believed that they are closely related to excessive release/accumulation of excitatory neurotransmitters, changes in expressing pattern of receptors, etc. For example, it has been reported that glutamate concentration in cerebrospinal fluid increases in stroke, cerebral ischemia, head injury and spinal injury. There is a report that neuropathy occurs when glutamate, NMDA, AMP A, kainate, etc. are excessively applied to nerve cells. There are reports that, in Alzheimer's disease, p-amyloid protein enhances the neurotoxicity of glutamate and that it promotes the release of glutamate. In the case of Parkinson's disease, there are reports that L-dopa hydroxide activates the AMPA receptor and enhances the neurotoxicity. There is another report that L-dopa promotes the generation of free radicals resulting in a rise of oxidative stress. In the case of Huntington's chorea, it is reported that a substance which inhibits the release of glutamate is effective in improving the symptoms. In the case of ALS, there are many reports showing the participation of glutamate in its pathology. There are some cases where the AIDS patients suffer from recognition nerve function deficiency and, even in such a nerve disease, participation of glutamate is suggested. For example, it is reported that gp 120 which is a glycoprotein in an envelope of HTV virus suppresses the incorporation of glutamate by astrocytes while a substance which inhibits the release of glutamate suppresses the neurodegeneration by gp 120. With regard to allergic encephalomyelitis, there is a report that, in the mice where the said inflammation takes place, enzyme which decomposes glutamate incorporated from outside of cells is deficient. Olivopontocerebellar atrophy is a disease which is sometimes combined with Parkinson's disease and an antibody to GluR2 which is a subunit constituting the AMPA receptor has been found and the relation between Olivopontocerebellar atrophy and AMPA receptor is suggested. With regard to a report for epilepsy, it is reported that, in the mice which are unable to construct the GluR2 in AMPA receptor, Ca2+ permeability of the AMPA receptor<br>
increases whereby it is apt to cause a sudden onset resulting in death. Besides the above, it is reported that NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenz[f]quinoxaline) and other inhibiting compounds to AMPA receptors have antianxiety and anticonvulsant action and there is also a report for the connection of AMPA receptor/kainate receptor with urinary disturbance, drug abuse, pain, etc.<br>
Therapeutic approaches to neurodegerative diseases and demyelinating disorders have proven largely unsatisfactory despite, in the case of the latter, the use of immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, which although providing limited benefit to patients, can be associated with potentially serious side effects. The introduction of interferon preparations has provided efficacy in the treatment of certain demyelinating disorders (e.g. multiple sclerosis). The beneficial effects are related to the immunomodulatory actions of the interferons. However, as benefits are apparent in only a portion of the subgroup of patients classified as suitable for treatment, then the problem remains that management of the disease remains insufficient with such preparations. The limited efficacy of current immunomodulatory therapies in demyelinating disorders (e.g. multiple sclerosis) may be related the failure of these agents to combat the oligodendroglial, neuronal and axonal degeneration associated with the disease.<br>
It can be expected that the substances showing an antagonistic action to excitatory neurotransmitters are useful for the therapy of the above-mentioned diseases. It is presently expected that substances having an antagonistic action to non-NMDA receptors such as AMPA receptor and kainate receptor will be particularly useful. For example, it is reported that inhibitors of the interaction of glutamate with the AMPA and/or kainate receptor complex are useful in treating demyelinating disorders (WOOO/01376). In addition it is reported that AMPA and/or kainate receptor antagonists were effective in ameliorating experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model which reproduces many of the pathological and clinical features of multiple sclerosis. Whilst the neuroprotective potential of AMPA and/or kainate receptor antagonists is recognised in the neuronal/axonal degeneration resulting from hypoxia/ischemia, hypoglycemia, convulsions and head or spinal cord trauma, these data [WOOO/01376] were the first to provide evidence in support of the involvement of glutamate in the pathogenesis of demyelinating disorders. In addition, the improved clinical outcome in EAE associated with AMPA<br>
and/or kainate receptor antagonist therapy was independent of anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory effects, suggesting an alternative mechanism of action involving oligodendroglial and neuronal/axonal protection.<br>
A solution to the problem of the lack of clinical efficacy of current therapies in demyelinating disorders is to use a combination of an immunoregulatory or anti-inflammatory agent and a neuroprotective, axonal protective and/or oligodendroglial protective agent. Thus, an object of the present invention is to investigate and find compounds which inhibit AMPA receptors) and/or kainate receptor(s) which when combined with an immnuomodulatory or anti-inflammatory agent suppresses the neurotoxicity, axonal toxicity and oligodendroglial toxicity of excitatory neurotransmitters and achieves a protective action as pharmaceutical agents being useful as therapeutic, preventing or improving agents for various neurodegenerative and demyelinating diseases.<br>
The present inventors have now provided evidence (whereby the reversal of paralysis in an in vivo model of a demyelinating and neurodegenerative disorder is achieved) in support of the pronounced clinical benefit in the therapy of neurodegenerative and demyelinating disorders using a combination of an AMPA and/or kainate receptor antagonist with an immunoregulatory agent, which is greater than the anticipated additive effect of either agent alone.<br>
Thus in one aspect the invention provides a composition comprising<br>
I)	a compound as described in the text herein, and<br>
II)	an immunoregulatory or an anti-inflammatory agent.<br>

All references to neurodegenerative disease may be acute or chronic. Compositions of the present invention may be used in human and veterinary medicine. Treatments may be prophylactic or may be in respect of existing conditions. Accordingly, the compositions of the present invention are useful in the therapeutic, prevention and improvement of various nervous diseases and are useful, for example, as therapeutic and preventive agents for acute neurodegenerative diseases (such as cerebral vascular accident of acute stage, head injury, spinal injury (such as spinal cord lesion), neuropathy by hypoxia or hypoglycemia), chronic neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntingdon's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinocerebellar degeneration), epilepsy, hepatic enephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, Parkinson's syndrome, spastic paralysis, pain, neuralgia, schizophrenia, anxiety, drug abuse, nausea, vomiting, urinary disturbance, visual disturbance (paropsia) due to glaucoma, auditory disturbance (paracusis) due to antibiotics, food poisoning, infectious encephalomyelitis (such as cerebrospinal meningitis (e.g. HTV cerebrospinal meningtitis)), cerebrovascular dementia, dementia or nervous symptoms due to meningitis.<br>
In this text, the neurodegenerative disease can be a demyelinating disorder. The term "demyelinating disorder" is used herein to include any disorder that results in a reduced level of myelination for example, encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, acute demyelinating polyneuropathy (Guillain Barre syndrome), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, multiple sclerosis, Marchifava-Bignami disease, central pontine myelinolysis, Devic syndrome, Balo disease, HTV-myelopathy, HTLV-<br>
myelopathy, progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy, or a secondary demyelinating disorder - i.e. where bystander myelin loss occurs as a consequence of a secondary pathological insult. Examples of secondary demyelinating diseases are CNS lupus erythematodes, polyarteritis nodosa, Sjoegren's syndrome, sarcoid granuloma or isolated cerebral vasculitis.<br>
Indeed, neurodegeneration, the major correlate of permanent clinical disability in multiple sclerosis occurs acutely during active demyelinating and can lead to in excess of 75% axonal loss in the chronic phase of disease. Similarly, neuronal and axonal degeneration are also .a pathological component of the acute and chronic EAE models.<br>
The compound of the present invention herein and an immunoregulatory or anti-inflammatory agent can be used separately, simultaneously or sequentially to treat a neurodegenerative disease, for example a demyelinating disorder. It can provide synergistically effective combination.<br>
Throughout this text, the prevention and /or treatment of any disease or disorder means any effect which mitigates any damage or any medial disorder, to any extend, and includes preventions and/or treatmenmts themselves. Further, the term 'treatment' means any amelioration of disease, disorder, syndrome, condition, pain, symptom, or a combination of two or more thereof.<br>
Therefore, the invention further provides use of a compound as described herein and an immunoregulatory or anti-inflammatory agent in the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of neurodegenerative disease. The neurodegenerative disease can be a demyelinating disorder. In such use, the compound as described herein and the immunoregulatory or anti-inflammatory agent can be administered separately, simultaneously or sequentially.<br>
Further provided is a method for the prevention or treatment of neurodegenerative disease, the method comprising administration to a patient, a composition as defined herein. The patient is preferably in need of such administration. The methods of the invention can be carried out to prevent or treat, for example, a demyelinating disorder. In such methods the<br>
immunoregulatory or anti-inflammatory agent can be administered separately, simultaneously or sequentially.<br>
The compositions of the present invention are administered, or used, or manufactured for use in a quantity sufficient to prevent and/or treat the symptonms of the condition, disease or disorder. For all aspects of the invention, particularly medical ones, the administration of the composition has a dosage regime which will umtimately be determined by the attending physician and will take into consideration such factors as the compound being used, animal type, age, weight, severity of symptoms, method of administration, adverse reactions and/or other contraindications. Specific dosage ranges can be determined by standard design clinical trials with patient progress and recovery being fully monitored. Such trials may use an escalating dose design using a low percentage of the maximum tolerated doses in animals as the starting dose in man.<br>
The physiologically acceptalble compounds, in compositions of the invention may be administered for periods of continuous therapy, for example a week or more, a month or more, a year or more, or indefinitely.<br>
A still further aspect of the invention provides a kit comprising: a first container comprising a compound as defined herein according to the invention and a second container comprising an immunoregulatory or anti-inflammatory agent, optionally with instructions for use and which kit can further comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient (combined with the compound in the first container and/or the agent in the second container, or separate to both).<br>

IN VIVO EXAMPLES<br>
The present invention will now be described by way of in vivo examples, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
FIGURE 1   ' shows that the AMPA receptor antagonist (2-cyanophenyl)-l-(phenyl-5-(2-pyridyl)-l,2-dihydropyridin-2-one (example 7) in combination with interferon-B reduces severity of paralysis during EAE in rats. The compound of example 7 (lOmg/kg p.o. once daily; 7-16 dpi) combined with interferon-B (IxlO6 Units/rat s.c.) significantly reduces the peak disease score compared to vehicle and either the compound of example 7 or interferon-B treatment alone. Data represent the mean ± SEM of disease score (n=8/group).<br>
FIGURE 2    shows that the AMPA receptor antagonist (2-cyanophenyl)-l-(phenyl-5-(2-pyridyl)-l,2-dihydropyridin-2-one (example 7) (lOmg/kg p.o. once daily; 7-16 dpi) in combination with interferon-B (IxlO6 Units/rat s.c.) reduces weight (g) loss during the course of EAE in rats. Data represent the mean ± SEM of disease score (n=8/group).<br>
In vivo Example 1<br>
Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), an inducible autoimmune disease, represents the best characterized animal model of a demyelinating disorder and drugs active in this model proved to be active in humans (Pender MP (1996). Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, In Autoimmune Neurological Disease, Editors Pender MP and McCombe PA, Cambridge University Press, pp 26-88).<br>
Here we describe a surprising observation on the pronounced reduction in neurological deficits during acute EAE in rats following treatment with a non-immunomodulatory and non-anti inflammatory agent, the AMPA receptor antagonist of example 7, in combination with interferon-B.<br>
Animals<br>
Female Lewis rats (200 + 10 g) obtained from Charles River, Kent, UK, were housed in pairs under environmentally controlled conditions (6:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. light/dark<br>
cycle; 22-24°C; 45-55% humidity) and allowed free access to food and water. Experimental groups consisted of 8 animals.<br>
Induction of Acute-Active EAE in Lewis Rats<br>
Rats were immunised in each hind foot with 15 fil of inoculum containing 15 /ig guinea pig myelin basic protein (MBP, prepared by the method of Dunkley and Carnegie (1974); final concentration 2 mg/ml), emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant (CFA; Sigma, UK) containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra (final concentration 5.5 mg/ml; Difco Laboratories, UK).<br>
Assessment of Clinical EAE in Lewis rats<br>
Animals were weighed and monitored daily and clinical disease scored as (0) no clinical signs; (1) flaccid tail and weight loss; (2) hind limb hypotonia with further weight loss; (3) complete hind limb paralysis; (4) paraplegia and (5) death. In addition, intermediate scores were assigned to animals which showed a loss of tonicity in the distal half of the tail (score = 0.5), paralysis of one hind limb (score = 2.5) or complete hind limb paralysis with forelimb weakness (score = 3.5). During the period of compound administration (7-16 days post immunisation; dpi) animals were scored 15h after injection of vehicle, compound of example 7 or interferon-fi to avoid any acute effect of treatment on disease score.<br>
Administration regime<br>
3-(2-Cyanophenyl)-l-phenyl-5-(2-pyridyl)-l,2-dihydropyridin-2-one; (example 7) was suspended in 0.5% methyl cellulose (MC) solution to obtain a compound concentration of 4 mg/ml. Interferon-8 was dissolved in PBS to obtain a compound concentration of 5xl06 Units/ml. Rats were dosed once daily (9 a.m.) on days 7 to 16 post immunisation with either vehicle (methyl cellulose p.o. and PBS s.c.), the compound alone in the dose of lOmg/kg (p.o. plus vehicle PBS s.c), interferon-8 alone in the dose of IxlO6 Units/rat (s.c. plus methyl cellulose p.o.) or example 7 in the dose of lOmg/kg (p.o) combined with interferon-8 in the dose of IxlO6 Units/rat (s.c.).<br>
Results<br><br>
Effect of the compound of example 7 and interferon-fi on disease progression during EAE in the Lewis rat<br>
Following immunisation with MBP, neurological deficit developed in 8/8 vehicle treated animals, all of which displayed paralysis of both hind limbs; the mean disease onset and duration were 11.8 dpi and 4.3 days respectively (Figure 1 and Table 1). Similarly, neurological deficit developed in 8/8 interferon-B treated animals, all of which displayed paralysis of both hind limbs; the mean disease onset and duration were 12.4 dpi and 4.5 days respectively (Figure 1 and Table 1). Once daily treatment from day 7 to 16 post immunisation using the compound of example 7 significantly delayed disease onset, shortened disease duration and reduced peak and cumulative disease score compared to both vehicle and interferon-B treated animals (Figure 1 and Table 1). The compound in combination with interferon-B, provided pronounced protection, greater than that observed with either vehicle, interferon-B or the compound treatment alone. Once daily treatment from day 7 to 16 post immunisation using the compound in combination with interferon-B completely prevented the development of paralysis in 7 out of 8 rats, with only one animal exhibiting incomplete loss of tail tone (score 0.75) for one day only. Thus the compound of example 7 in combination with interferon-B significantly reduced disease duration (p

Test Example 1<br>
The suppressing action of the compounds of the present invention to calcium influx into nerve cells induced by AMPA was investigated using the primary culture system of nerve cells of cerebral cortex of embryo of rat. Culturing Conditions:<br>
Cerebral cortex was cut out from the brain of rat of gestational 18 days and treated with trypsin and DNase to disperse the cells. The cells were flown by MEM containing 10% of serum, sown in a culture bottle and astrocytes were proliferated. The astrocytes were re-dispersed by trypsin and sown in a 96-well plate. After incubation for one week, it was confirmed that the astrocytes covered all over the bottom and then the nerve cells of cerebral cortex which was dispersed by the above method were sown thereupon. After incubation for 24 hours, the medium was changed, the incubation was carried out for one week and, after that, the medium was changed to that containing luM of MK-801. Nerve cells which were incubated for not shorter than 8 to 10 days were used. <br>
Suppressing Action to Calcium Influx into Nerve Cells Induced bv AMPA Calcium influx into the cells was measured using Fura2-AM which was a calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye. It was treated in a medium containing Fura2-AM for 1 hour, incorporated into the cells, exchanged to a Tyrode solution containing luM MK-801 and stimulation was carried out using 2uM AMPA. Change in the amount of calcium flown into the cells were measured as the change in the fluorescent intensity at the exciting wave length of 340/380 nm. Effect of the test compound was evaluated using the reaction resulted in the AMPA added to a Tyrode solution containing no compound as a control. Results are shown in Tables 1 to 3.<br>
GYKI52446 (Le Peillet, et aL, Brain Res., 571,115,1992) was used as a control compound. IC5o of GYKI 52466 was 9.02(JM.<br>
Test Example 2<br>
Anticonyulsant Action Induced bv AMPA<br>
A test compound was suspended in a 0.5% methyl cellulose solution or in sesame oil and<br>
was orally administered (25 mg/kg) to male mice of ddy strain. After 30 minutes or 1 hour<br>
from the oral administration, AMPA was continuously injected (2<br>
nmole/5p,l/minute/mouse) into lateral ventricle to induce the convulsions. The effect was<br>
judged by a time-extending action until the convulsion takes place by a continuous<br>
injection of AMPA.<br>
Results<br>
The compound represented by the above formula (I) according to the present invention<br>
showed an excellent anticonvulsant action. For example, the compounds of Examples 4,7,<br>
9,12,16, 32,41,47, 57,61,76,78, 91,126,128,137,139,164,199,261,262, 264,270<br>
and 298 showed a significant anticonvulsant action.<br>

Occlusion model of mid-cerebral arteries<br>
The usefulness of the compound related to the present invention in the remedy of acute stroke was confirmed by the test below. Namely, the cerebral bloodstream of mid-cerebral arteries was blocked by inserting a nylon suture thread of 4-0 specification whose edge was crashed with flame, by 17mm from the branch of internal carotid artery, through internal carotid artery from the external carotid artery of a male Sprange Dawley rat, and cerebral infarction was prepared (Zea Longa et al., Stroke 20:84-91,1989). The size of the cerebral infarction was evaluated by preparing the intersection slice of brain having a thickness of 2mm and measuring the area of a portion which was not stained by TTC staining. The effect of the tested substance was carried out in this model by comparing the infarction nidus size between a group treated with a solvent and a group treated with the tested substance.<br>
As a result, the compound related to the present invention revealed an excellent effect as the therapeutic agent of acute stroke.<br>
Test example 4 Antimethamphetamine effect<br>
(S)-(+)-N,a-dimethylphenetylamine (hereinafter, referred to as "methamphetamine") was dosed intraperitoneal administration to a rat or mouse to which the tested compound was dosed, and a quantity of active movement was measured using an active movement measuring apparatus (SCANET SV-10; manufactured by TOYO Sangyo Co., Ltd.). The activity as the therapeutic agent of schizophrenia was evaluated using the hyperdynamic effect control of active movement caused by methamphetamine as an index (K.E. Vanover, Psychopharmacology 136:123-131,1998). The effect of the tested substance was confirmed by the control effect of a quantity of active movement accentuation in comparison with the group dosed with a solvent.<br>
As a result, the compound related to the present invention revealed an excellent methamphetamine effect.<br>
Test example 5<br>
Rigidity model of intercaruncle ablatio provocative muscle<br>
An animal model in which the myotony of anteroposterior limbs was provoked was<br>
prepared by electrically freezing between the upper cumulus and the lower cumulus of a<br>
rat. Myorelaxation effect was evaluated based on the effect of controlling the increase of<br>
muscle discharge which is generated when the posterior limbs in this model are moved<br>
back and forth. The effect of the tested substance was confirmed by the changes of muscle<br>
discharge amount before dosing the tested substance and muscle discharge amount after<br>
dosing it.<br>
The compound related to the present invention revealed an excellent myorelaxation effect.<br>
Test example 6<br>
Light dark test<br>
A mouse is put in a dark box which is composed of two light and dark boxes which are<br>
linked by a tunnel, and items below were recorded concerning the behavior of the mouse<br>
for 5 minutes after that.<br>
1.	A time for remaining in the light and dark boxes.<br>
2.	Times by which the mouse went and came back between the light box and the dark<br>
box.<br>
3.	Times by which the mouse went until the entrance of the light box.<br>
The antianxiety effect of the tested compound was detected as the elongation of the time remaining in the light and dark boxes, the increase of times by which the mouse went and came back between the light and the dark box, and the increase of times by which the mouse went until the entrance of the light box, for the group dosed with a solvent (Hascoet M., BourinM., Pharm. Biochem. Behav. 60:645-653, 1998).<br>
According to the present test, it was confirmed that the compound related to the present invention has an excellent antianxiety effect.<br>
Test example 7<br>
Destruction model of 6-hvdroxydopamine-inductive nigrostriaton<br>
lOMg/kg of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) (twice per day) was dosed every day in<br>
the abdomen of a rat whose one side of nigra neurocyte was destroyed by injecting 6-<br>
hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into nigra, therefore the increase of rotational motion to the<br>
reverse side of encephalopathy was provoked (C. Marin et al, Synapse 36(4):267-274,<br>
2000). After the solvent or the tested compound was dosed to the rat, influence on the<br>
provoked rotational motion was studied. The tested compound delayed the time until<br>
primitive rotational motion shows the maximum value after dosing L-DOPA, and<br>
increased the time of showing rotation which is a half or more of the maximum rotational<br>
number.<br>
Test example 8<br>
Acetic acid writhing method<br>
Anguishing condition under which the lower half of rat's body was twisted, its abdomen<br>
was dented and its hind legs were extended was provoked by injection 0.6% acetic acid<br>
saline in the abdomen of the rats. After the tested compound and the solvent were dosed,<br>
the acetic acid saline was injected in the abdomen, and analgesic effect was evaluated by<br>
comparing the times of these abnormal actions within an observation time (5 to 15 minutes<br>
after the dose of acetic acid) which occur after the dosing (Basic Pharmacology Experiment, edited by Kazuhiko Kubota, pages 45-47, Nankoh-do).<br>
As a result, it could be confirmed that the compound related to the present invention controls the times of the abnormal actions significantly and has an excellent analgesic effect.<br>
Test example 9<br>
Vomiting model induced by cisplatin<br>
A catheter for venoclysis was buried in a ferret, and the rat was postoperatively recovered.<br>
Then, vomiting reaction was provoked by injecting lOmg/kg of cis-<br>
diaminedichloroplatinum (cisplatin) (A. Fink-Jensen et al., Neuroscience Letters<br>
137:173-177,1992). Cisplatin (lOmg/kg) was injected a ferret which was preliminarily<br>
treated with the tested compound or the solvent, then the ferret was put in an observation<br>
cage, and the time (latent time) and times until the rhythmical contraction of abdomen<br>
(defined as vomiting) occurs during the observation period of 240 minutes were measured.<br>
As a result, the compound related to the present invention extended the latent time and reduced the vomiting times significantly.<br>

Experimental autoimmune encephalomvelitis model<br>
Female Lewis rats (205 ± 10 g) obtained from Charles River, Kent UK, were housed in pairs under environmentally controlled conditions (6:00a.m.-6:00p.m. light/dark cycle; 22-24°C; 45-55% humidity) and allowed free access to food and water. Experimental groups consisted of 9-12 animals. Rats were immunised in each hind foot with 20-50 pi of inoculum containing 50 jig guinea pig myelin basic protein (MBP; final concentration 2 nag/ml), emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant (CFA; Sigma, UK) containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra (final concentration 5.5 mg/ml; Difco Laboratories, UK). Animals were weighed and monitored daily and clinical disease scored as (0) no clinical signs; (1) flaccid tail and weight loss; (2) hind limb hypotonia with further weight loss; (3) complete hind limb paralysis; (4) paraplegia and (5) death. In addition, intermediate scores were assigned to animals which showed a loss of tonicity in the distal<br>
half of the tail (score = 0.5), paralysis of one hind limb (score = 2.5) or complete hind limb paralysis with forelimb weakness (score = 3.5). During the period of compound administration (10-16 days post immunisation; dpi) animals were scored 15h after injection of vehicle or compound to avoid any acute effect of treatment on disease score. Compounds were dissolved/suspended in 0.5% methyl cellulose using a hand held Polytron homogeniser (PT1200; 2 min). Rats were dosed p.o. with either methyl cellulose vehicle (2.5 ml/kg) or compound at 5,10 and 20 mg/kg.<br>
Results: the compound of the invention is improved in view of EAE. The compounds of Examples 7,32,76,139,164,261,262 and 264 are for example provided with a superior effect to the vehicle-administered group.<br><br>
