Arvlsulfonyl derivatives with 5-HT6 receptor affinity This invention relates to (arylsulfonyl-phenyl)-piperazine derivatives of formula<br>
wherein: <br>
Ar is naphthyl or phenyl, optionally substituted by halogen or (Q-C6)-alkoxy;<br>
Rl is (C1-.C6)-alkyl;<br>
R2 is hydrogen or (C1-C6)-alkyl;<br>
or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates thereof.<br>
It has been shown that these compounds have a very good affinity to the 5-HT6 receptor. They are therefor suitable in the treatment of diseases, related to this receptor.<br>
The actions of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) as a major modulatory neurotransmitter in the brain, are mediated through a number of receptor families termed 5-HT1, 5-HT2,5- HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7. Based on a high level of 5-HT6 receptor mRNA in the brain, it has been stated that the 5-HT6 receptor may play a role in the pathology and treatment of central nerve system disorders. In particular, 5-HT6 selective ligands have been identified as potentially useful in the treatment of certain CNS disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, anxiety, depression, manic depression, psychoses, epilepsy, obsessive compulsive disorders, migraine, Alzheimer's disease (enhancement of cognitive memory), sleep disorders, feeding disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, panic attacks, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), attention deficit disorder (ADD), withdrawal from drug abuse such as cocaine, ethanol, nicotine and benzodiazepines, schizophrenia, and also disorders associated with spinal trauma and/or head<br>
2.<br><br>
injury such as hydrocephalus. Such compounds are also expected to be of use in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as functional bowel disorder. (See for ex. B.L. Roth et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.1994, 268, pages 1403-14120, D. R. Sibley et al., MoL Pharmacol. 1993, 43, 320-327, A.J. Sleight et al, Neurotransmission 1995, 11, 1-5, and A. J. Sleight et al. Serotonin ID Research Alert, 1997, 2 (3), 115-8. Furthermore, the effect of 5-HT6 antagonist and 5-HT6 antisense aligonucleotides to reduce food intake in rats has been reported (Br J Pharmac. 1999 Suppl 126, page 66 and J Psychopharmacol Suppl A64 1997, page 255).<br>
Several arylsulfonyl compounds with 5-HT6 affinity have been disclosed, for example in EP 0 930 302 or in WO01/98279, but it has been surprisingly found that the novel compounds of formula I possess greater affinity, and therefore would be suitable and highly desirable for the treatment or prevention of central nervous disorders described herein.<br>
Objects of the present invention are compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvents per se and as pharmaceutically active substances, their manufacture, medicamnets based on a compound in accordance with the invention and their production as well as the use of compounds of formula I in the control or prevention of illnesses based on the modulation of the 5-HT6 system, comprising Alzheimer's disease, central nervous disorders, such as for example, psychoses, schizophrenia, manic depressions, neurological disorders, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington's disease, gastrointestinal disease comprising functional bowel disorder or disorders which require a reduction of food intake.<br>
The invention also discloses all pharmaceutical acceptable prodrugs.<br>

Iyophilisation from solution for constitution before use with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile, pyrogen-free water.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be formulated for topical administration to the epidermis as ointments, creams or lotions, or as a transdermal patch. Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agents. Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also containing one or more emulsifying agents, stabilising agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, or colouring agents. Formulations suitable for" topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising active agents in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatine and glycerine or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be formulated for administration as suppositories. A low melting wax, such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter is first melted and the active component is dispersed homogeneously, for example, by stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool, and to solidify.<br>
The compounds of the present invention maybe formulated for vaginal administration. Pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or sprays containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be formulated for nasal administration. The solutions or suspensions are applied directly to the nasal cavity by conventional means, for example, with a dropper, pipette or spray. The formulations may be provided in a single or multidose form. In the latter case of a dropper or pipette, this may be achieved by the patient administering an appropriate, predetermined volume of the solution or suspension. In the case of a spray, this may be achieved for example by means of a metering atomising spray pump.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be formulated for aerosol administration, particularly to the respiratory tract and including intranasal administration. The compound will generally have a small particle size for example of the order of five (5) microns or less. Such a particle size may be obtained by means known in the art, for example by micronization. The active ingredient is provided in a pressurised pack with a suitable propellant such as a<br><br><br>
chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), for example, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, or dichlorotetrafluoroethane, or carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. The aerosol may conveniently also contain a surfactant such as lecithin. The dose of drug may be controlled by a metered valve. Alternatively the active ingredients may be provided in a form of a dry powder, for example a powder mix of the compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose, starch, starch derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The powder carrier will form a gel in the nasal cavity. The powder composition may be presented in unit dose form for example in capsules or cartridges of e.g., gelatine or blister packs from which the powder maybe administered by means of an inhaler.<br>
When desired, formulations can be prepared with enteric coatings adapted for sustained or controlled release administration of the active ingredient. For example, the compounds of the present invention can be formulated in transdermal or subcutaneous drug delivery devices. These delivery systems are advantageous when sustained release of the compound is necessary and when patient compliance with a treatment regimen is crucial. Compounds in transdermal delivery systems are frequently attached to an skin-adhesive solid support. The compound of interest can also be combined with a penetration enhancer, e.g., Azone<br>
(l-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one). Sustained release delivery systems are inserted subcutaneously into the subdermal layer by surgery or injection. The subdermal implants encapsulate the compound in a lipid soluble membrane, e.g., silicone rubber, or a biodegradable polymer, e.g., polylacticacid.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.<br>
