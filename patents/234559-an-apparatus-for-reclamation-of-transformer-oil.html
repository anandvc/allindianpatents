				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION	*V<br>
This invention relates to an apparatus for reclamation of transformer oil. PRIOR ART<br>
Insulating oil in transformer acts on both dielectric and coolant, ii'or this<br>
purpose it is essential to have certain electrical and thermal properties. The<br>
requirements are good electric strength, high resistivity, low electric dislsipation<br>
factor, low acidity and high intratacial tension. During operation of the<br>
transformer due to continuous heating and constant contact with coniStruction<br>
materials like copper, paper, press board and core materials etc., the oil quality<br>
deteriorates.	j<br>
The amount of deterioration of products like organic acids, sludge, low nrlolecular weight hydrocarbon gases and moisture increases the accumulation |of these products which deteriorate the oil which in turn can cause damage/failure of transformer.<br>
Further the preventive or productive maintenance of oil discloses^ serious<br>
problem of moisture, combustible gases and/or oil decay products.	j<br>
OBJECTS OF PRESENT INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an object of this invention is to propose an apparatus for redlamation of transformer oil having applications such as for reclamation of transformer oil at the site.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose an apparatus for reclaiiiation of<br>
transformer oil, which avoids transformer down time.	J<br><br>
?<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose an apparatus for reclamation of i<br>
transformer oil, which avoids oil transportation.	J<br>
! !<br>
A still further object of this invention is to propose an apparatus for reclamation of \ transformer oil which has better .throughput, lower dead volume, is energy efficient and j has minimum wastage of oil.<br>
