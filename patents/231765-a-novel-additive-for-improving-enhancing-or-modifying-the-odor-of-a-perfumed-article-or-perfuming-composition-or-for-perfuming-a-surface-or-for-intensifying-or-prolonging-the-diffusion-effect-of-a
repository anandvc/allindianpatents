				<td>A NOVEL ADDITIVE FOR IMPROVING, ENHANCING OR MODIFYING THE ODOR OF A PERFUMED ARTICLE OR PERFUMING COMPOSITION, OR FOR PERFUMING A SURFACE, OR FQR INTENSIFYING OR PROLONGING THE DIFFUSION EFFECT OF AN ODORIFEROUS INGREDIENT ON A SURFACE<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to the field of perfumery. More particularly, it concerns compounds comprising at least one ß-oxy or ß-thio carbonyl moiety capable of liberating an active molecule such as  for  example, an α,ß-unsaturated ketone, aldehyde or carboxylic ester. The present invention concerns also the use of said compounds in perfmnery as well as the perfuming compositions or perfumed articles comprising the invention's compounds.<br>
Prior art<br>
The perfume industry has a pnrt.cuoar  interest for compounds which are capable of prolonging the effect of active ingredicuits over a certain period of time, for example in order to overcome the problems encounlcred when using perfuming ingredients which are too volatile or have a poor substantvity  These compounds can be used in various applications, as for example in fine or Junctional perfiimery. The washing of textiles is a particulair field in wliich there is a constant quest to enable the effect of active substances, in particular perfumes, to be effective e for a certain period of time after washing and drying. Indeed, many substances liaving fragrances which are particularly suitable for this type of application are, in fact, known tc lack tenacity on laundiy, or do not remain on the laundry when rinsed, with the result that their perfuming effect is experienced only briefly and not very intensely. Given the importance of this type of application in the perfiome industry, research in this field has been sustained, in particular with the aim of finding new, and more effective solutions to the iforementioned problems.<br>
Amongst the compounds of the present invention a few are known from the prior art. Said compounds are 3-(phenylmeihoxy)-l-(2,6,6-triraethyl-2-cyclohexen-l-yl)-I-butanone (by Fehr C et al. in Helv. Chira. Acta (1992), 75, 1023), 4-(phenylsuIfonyI)-4-<br>

The compounds of formula (I) may be synthesized from commercially available compounds by conventional methods. Generally speaking, the invention compounds are obtainable by the [l,4]-addition reaction between an odoriferous α,ß-unsaturated ketone, aldehyde or carboxylic ester of formula (IF)<br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein the configxiration of the carbon-carbon double bond can be of the E or Z type and the symbols R', R2, R3 and R4 have the meaning indicated in formula (I); and a compound of formula Q[(-G-)n[-X-H]m]w„ wherein all the symbols have the meaning given in formula (I). For practical reasons, and according to the nature and nucleophilicity of the functional group X, the invention compounds may be more advantageously obtained by the reaction between the compound of formula (11"), which is the aldol derivative of the odoriferous compound of formula (IF),(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein the symbols R', R2, R3 and R4 have the meaning indicated in fonnula (I); and a derivative of Q[(-G-)n[-X-H]m]w such as an acid chloride, a sulfonyl chloride or an alkyl chloro formate derivative.<br>
The use of the aldol derivative is particularly interesting for the synthesis of all the compounds of formula (I) wherein X represents, e.g., a carboxylic, sulfonate, sulfate, carbonate, phosphate, borate, and silicate flinctional group. On the other hand, the direct use of the odoriferous molecule as starting material is particularly interesting for the synthesis of all the compounds of formula (I) wherein X represents, e.g., an ether, thioether or yet a thiocarboxylic derivative.<br>
Polymeric materials may also be obtained by the polymerization of one monomer to which a moiety (-G-)n[-X-P]m, has been previously grafted. Said polymerisation may also be performed in the presence of other monomeric units bearing a different (-G-)n[-X-P]m moiety.<br>
General examples of this approach are illustrated in the following scheme, for particular cases of the compounds of formula (I):<br>
(Formula Removed) Although it is not possible to provide an exhaustive list of the compounds of formula Q[(-G-)„[-X-H]J„ which may  be  used in the synthesis of the invention compounds, one can cite as preferred examples the following: benzoic acid, 4- or 3-methyl-benzoic   acid,   3-   or   4-(N,N-dimethylamino)-benzoic   acid,   tosylic   acid, benzenesulfonic acid, isophthalic acid, phthalic acid, terephthalic acid, benzene-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid, alkyliminodiacetic acid (wherein alkyl represents a C, to C,o alkyl group), 10-undecenoic acid, undecanoic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, dodecanedionic acid,  1-octadecanethiol and CH3(CH2)11S(O)aH (wherein a represent 0,  1  or 2).

Similarly, it is not possible to provide an exhaustive list of the currently known odoriferous compounds of foraiula (IF) which can be used in the synthesis of the invention compounds and subsequently be released. However the following can be named as preferred examples: alpha-damascone, beta-damascone, gamma-damascone, delta-damascone, alpha-ionone, beta-ionone, gamma-ionone, delta-ionone, beta-damascenone.<br>

Of course, the aldol derivatives of fomiula (11") of the latter compounds are also useful in the synthesis of the invention compounds.<br>
Amongst the odoriferous compounds cited in the list hereinabove, the preferred are: the damascones, ionones, beta-damascenone, l-(5,5-dimethyl-l-cyclohexen-l-yl)-4-penten-1-one, l(6),8-P-menthadien-2-one, 2-cyclopentadecen-1-one, 1-(2,2,3,6-tetramethyl- 1 -cyclohexyl)-2-buten-1 -one, 4-(2,2,3,6-tetramethy 1-1 -cyclohexyl)-3-buten-2-one and 2-cyclopentadecen-1-one.<br>
As can be noticed from formula (I), the compounds of the invention are composed of three main parts, namely the release moiety P-X, the fragment G and the terminal group Q.<br>
The special feature of the invention resides in the structure of the releasing moiety P-X. Owing to the particular chemical structure of said moiety, the compounds of formula (I) are capable of releasing, via a decomposition reaction, a residue and an odoriferous molecule such as, for example, an α,ß-unsaturated ketone, aldehyde or carboxylic ester of formula (II').<br>
An example of said decomposition reaction is illustrated in the following scheme:<br>
Scheme Removed<br>
The compound Q[(-G-)n[-X-H]m]w, which is also the residue of the decomposition reaction, may be itself an odorless compound or a perfuming ingredient; preferably said residue is an odorless compound. Similarly, the compound of formula (I) is preferably odorless.<br>
The nature of X plays an important role in the release kinetics of the odoriferous molecule. Thus, by a careful choice of the nature of X it is possible to tune the perfinne release properties of the compounds of formula (I).<br>
The second part of the compounds of the invention is the fragment G. Besides its role as a linker between the releasing unit P-X and Q, said G can have also an influence in the releasing properties of the compounds of formula (I). Indeed, a shrewd choice of the chemical nature of said fragment, e.g. electron donating/withdrawing or hydrophobic/hydrophilic fragments, can allow to fine tune the perfume releasing properties.<br>
The third component of the compounds of the invention is the terminal group Q. Whenever Q is not a hydrogen or a group [[P-X]„[G]J, said terminal group can play the role of a carrier to which can be attached several releasing units P-X. Moreover, depending on its specific nature, it can also play an important role in the effective deposition and surface substantivity of the molecules of the invention on the surface used for the application, especially on fabrics and hair. Said role of a carrier in the effective deposition is well known by a person skilled in the art.<br>
The decomposition reaction, which leads to the release of the odoriferous molecules, is believed to be influenced by pH changes or heat, but may be triggered by other types of mechanisms.<br>
As the compovmds of the invention are useful ingredients for the perfuming of various products, the present invention concerns also all different forms of the invention's compounds which can be advantageously employed in perfiunery. Such forms include a composition of matter consisting of a compounds of formula (I) and a solvent commonly used in perfumery. As examples of said solvent, generally speaking, one can cite compounds such as dipropyleneglycol, diethyl phthalate, isopropyl myristate, benzyl benzoate, 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)-l-ethanol or ethyl citrate, which are the most commonly used.<br><br>
I.<br><br>
Additionally, the present invention concerns a perfuming composition comprising at least one compound of formula (I). Generally speaking, by "perfuming composition" we mean here a mixture comprising at least two perfuming ingredients, in any of their forms, and possibly one or more solvents commonly used in perfuming compositions. Therefore, a perfiraiing composition according to the invention comprises at least one invention's compoimd together with one or more perfuming co-ingredients and possibly one or more solvents.<br>
The nature and type of these perfuming co-ingredients do not warrant a more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the skilled person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and according to the nature of the product to be perfimied and the desired olfactory effect. In general terms, these perfuming co-ingredients belong to chemical classes as varied as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, acetates, nitriles, terpene hydrocarbons, nitrogenous or sulphurous heterocyclic compounds and essential oils of natural or synthetic origin. Many of these ingredients are in any case listed in reference texts such as the book of S. Arctander, Perfume and Flavor Chemicals, 1969, Montclair, New Jersey, USA, or its more recent versions, or in other works of a similar nature, as well as in the abundant patent literature in the field of perfumery.<br>
Similarly, a detailed description of the nature and type of solvents commonly used in perfuming compositions cannot be exhaustive. A skilled person in the art is able to select them on the basis of the nature of the product to be perfumed. However, as non-limiting examples of such solvents, one can cite, in addition to the solvents mentioned above, also ethanol, water/ethanol mixtures, limonene or other terpenes, isoparafiBns such as those known under the trademark Isopar (origin: Exxon Chemical) or glycol ethers and glycol ether esters such as those known under the trademark Dowanol® (origin: Dow Chemical Company).<br>
As previously mentioned, a compound of formula (I), in any of its forms, or a perfuming composition comprising said compound of formula (I), is a usefiil perfuming ingredient which can be advantageously used in all the fields of modem perfumery, such as fine perfumery or fimctional perfumery, as it enable a controlled release of odoriferous molecules.<br>
Indeed, the invention compounds may be advantageously employed in fine or functional perfumery to achieve a more controlled deposition, and consequent release, of odoriferous compounds. For example, perfuming ingredients present as such in washing or perfuming compositions can have little staying-power on a surface and consequently be often eliminated, for example in the rinsing water or upon drying of said surface. This problem can be solved by using a compound of formula (I), for which we have been able to show that it possesses a surprising stability over storage and staying-power or tenacity on surfaces, such as textiles. Therefore, the compounds according to the invention, owing to a good substantivity, a low volatility and a controlled release of odoriferous molecules, can be incorporated in any application requiring the effect of rapid or prolonged liberation of an odoriferous component as defined hereinabove and fvirthermore can impart a fragrance and a freshness to a treated surface which will last well beyond the rinsing and/or drying processes. Suitable sxirfaces are, in particular, textiles, hard surfaces, hair and skin.<br>
Thus, in perfumery, one of the major advantages of the invention resides in the fact that the compounds of formula (I) impart an intense fragrance to the treated surface, produced by an odoriferous molecule, which would not be detected on said surface over a suffciently long period if the odoriferous α,ß-unsaturated carbonyl derivative had been used as such, i.e. without a precursor.<br>
Such a behavior makes the compounds of formula (I) particularly suitable as precursors of perfuming ingredients for applications associated with fimctional or fine perfumery. Consequently, the use of an invention's compound as perfuming ingredient is another object of the present invention. Moreover, perfiimed articles comprising at least one invention's compound, in any of its forms, or a perfiiming composition comprising said compound of formula (I), are also an object of the present invention.<br>
Suitable perfumed articles comprise solid or liquid detergents and fabric softeners as well as all the other articles common in perfumery, namely perfumes, colognes or aftershave lotions, perfiimed soaps, shower or bath salts, mousses, oils or gels, hygiene products or hair care products such as shampoos, body-care products, deodorants or antiperspirants, air fresheners and also cosmetic preparations. As detergents are intended applications such as detergent compositions or cleaning products for washing up or for<br>
cleaning various surfaces, e.g. uitended for textile, dish or hard-surface treatment, whether they are intended for domestic or industrial use. Other perfumed articles are fabric refreshers, ironing waters, papers, wipes or bleaches.<br>
Preferred perfuming compositions or perfumed articles are perfumes, fabric detergents or softener bases.<br>
Typical examples of fabric detergents or softener composition into which the compounds of the invention can be incorporated are described in WO 97/34986 or in US patents 4,137,180 and 5,236,615 or EP 799 885. Other typical detergent and softening compositions which can be used are described in works such as Oilman's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, vol. A8, pages 315-448 (1987) and vol. A25, pages 747-817 (1994); Flick, Advanced Cleaning Product Formulations, Noye Publication, Park Ridge, New Jersey (1989); Showell, in Surfactant Science Series, vol. 71: Powdered Detergents, Marcel Dekker, New York (1988); Proceedings of the World Conference on Detergents (4th, 1998, Montreux, Switzerland), AOCS print.<br>
Some of the above-mentioned articles may represent an aggressive medium for the invention compounds, so that it may be necessary to protect the latter from premature decomposition, for example by encapsulation.<br>
For the sake of clarity, it has to be mentioned that, by "perfumed article" we mean here a finished consumer product, or a part of said consumer product, capable of exerting a perfuming action. Therefore, a perfumed article according to the invention comprises at least a part of the whole formulation corresponding to the desired article, e.g. a detergent or a part of it, and at least an invention's compound possibly together with one or more perfuming co-ingredients and possibly one or more solvents.<br>
The nature and type of the constituents of the article do not warrant a more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the skilled person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and according to the nature and the desired effect of said article.<br>
The proportions in which the compounds according to the invention can be incorporated into the various aforementioned articles or compositions vary within a wide range of values. These values are dependent upon the nature of the article or product to be perfumed and on the desired olfactory effect as well as the nature of the co-ingredients in<br>
 given composition when the compounds according to the invention are mixed with perfuming co-ingredients, solvents or additives commonly used in the art.<br>
For example, typical concentrations are in the order of 0.001 % to 5 % by weight, or even more, of the compounds of the invention based on the weight of the composition into which they are incorporated- Concentrations lower than these, such as in the order of 0.01% to 1% by weight, can be used when these compounds are applied directly in the perfuming of the various consumer products mentioned hereinabove.<br>
Another object of the present invention relates to a method for the perfuming of a surface or to a method for intensiiying or prolonging the diffusion effect of the characteristic fragrance of an odoriferous ingredient on a surface, characterized in that said surface is treated in the presence of a compound of formula (I). Suitable surfaces are, in particular, textiles, hard surfaces, hair and skin.<br>
The invention will now be described in further detail by way of the following examples, wherein the abbreviations have the usual meaning in the art, the temperatures are indicated in degrees centigrade (°C); the NMR spectral data were recorded in CDCI3 (if not stated otherwise) with a 360 or 400 MHz machine for 'H and "C, the chemical displacement 5 are indicated in ppm with respect to the TMS as standard, the coupling constants J are expressed in Hz. GPC analyses were performed on a Macherey-Nagel Nucleogel GPC 500-5 column (300 x 7.7 mm i.d.), eluted with THF at 0.5 ml/min and calibrated with commercially available standards (origin: Fluka).<br>

An alkaline buffer solution containing 1% by weight of a non-ionic surfactant was prepared by dissolving two borate buffer tablets pH = 9.2 and 2.24 g of Triton® XI00 (origin: Union Carbide) in a mixture of 160 ml water and 40 ml of acetonitrile. To determine the exact pH value of the final reaction solution, 10 ml of the buffer were diluted with 2 ml of acetonitrile (to give a mixture of water/acetonitrile 2:1) and the pH values measured to be 10.5.<br>
50 jii of a 0.25 M solution of the test compound in THF, were added to 5 ml of the above mentioned alkaline buffer (water/acetonitrile 4:1) and diluted with 1 ml of acetonitrile (to give a final mixture of water/acetonitrile 2:1). The sample was left stirring at room temperature for 3 day, then extracted with 1 ml of heptane and left decanting for 30 min. The heptane phase (0.5 µl) was injected three times into a Carlo Erba MFC 500 gas chromatograph equipped with a Fisons AS 800 autosampler and a J&amp;W Scientific DBl capillary column (30 m, 0.32 mm i.d.) at 70°C for 10 min then to 260°C (10°C/min), helium pressure 50 kPa, injection temperature 250°C, detector temperature 280°C.
