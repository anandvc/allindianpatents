				<td>A FLOW DISTRIBUTION DEVICE FOR A PULP MAKING PROCESS<br>
This invention relates to a method and a device for the uniform spreading and<br>
distribution of a flowing medium, for example a pulp suspension, where the medium is<br>
distributed via at least two distribution units.<br>
As an application example of the invention can be mentioned cellulose and the need of<br>
the papermaking industry to form webs of fibrous suspensions, which often are more<br>
than 10 metres wide and have very high requirements on uniformity both across and<br>
along the manufacturing direction. The uniformity of the webs often is totally decisive<br>
for the efficiency and economy of the process.<br>
At, for example, liquid treatment, i.e. washing or bleaching and dewatering of fibrous<br>
suspensions it is, thus, essential that the pulp is applied to and distributed transversely<br>
on a continuous liquid permeable support as uniformly as possible both in the<br>
longitudinal and transverse direction. It is equally essential that the treatment liquid is<br>
distributed uniformly across the pulp web. A uniform distribution prevents channeli-<br>
zation and thereby non-uniform liquid treatment and dewatering.<br>
In order to make optimum use of the apparatus equipment, a suspension of cellulose<br>
fibers to be dewatered, for example in connection with a liquid treatment, must be<br>
supplied at the highest possible concentration and be formed on the support, through<br>
which liquid is sucked out. This support can be a liquid permeable roll or a plane wire.<br>
The question of highest possible concentration is decided by the capacity of the device<br>
to distribute transversely the medium sufficiently uniformly and to form a homogenous<br>
web in order to satisfy the demand of the process in question. The difficulty of<br>
distributing the fibrous suspension uniformly across the entire width increases rapidly<br>
with increasing pulp concentration as a consequence of the increasing shearing strength<br>
of the fiber network.<br>
Distribution of a flowing medium<br>
This invention relates to a method and a device for the uniform spreading and<br>
distribution of a flowing medium, for example a pulp suspension, where the medium is<br>
distributed via at least two distribution units.<br>
As an application example of the invention can be mentioned cellulose and the need of<br>
the papermaking industry to form webs of fibrous suspensions, which often are more<br>
than 10 metres wide and have very high requirements on uniformity both across and<br>
along the manufacturing direction. The uniformity of the webs often is totally decisive<br>
for the efficiency and economy of the process.<br>
At, for example, liquid treatment, i.e. washing or bleaching and dewatering of fibrous<br>

In order to make optimum use of the apparatus equipment, a suspension of cellulose<br>
fibers to be dewatered, for example in connection with a liquid treatment, must be<br>
supplied at the highest possible concentration and be formed on the support, through<br>
which liquid is sucked out. This support can be a liquid permeable roll or a plane wire.<br>
The question of highest possible concentration is decided by the capacity of the device<br>
to distribute transversely the medium sufficiently uniformly and to form a homogenous<br>
web in order to satisfy the demand of the process in question. The difficulty of<br>
distributing the fibrous suspension uniformly across the entire width increases rapidly<br>
with increasing pulp concentration as a consequence of the increasing shearing strength<br>
of the fiber network.<br>
Non-uniform distribution of the fibrous suspension not only results in non-uniform<br>
dewatering and thereby poor efficiency of the liquid treatment, it also can cause in a<br>
press damages on the fibers and, thus, deteriorated pulp quality. In the roll nip between<br>
the rolls, for example in a roll press, fiber flocks and thick portions of the pulp web can<br>
be subjected to compacting pressures so high that the fibers are damaged in these load-<br>
carrying portions.<br>
It is, thus, obvious that a uniform distribution of the fibrous suspension and treatment<br>
liquid is of greatest importance for the quality of the final product and economy of the<br>
process.<br>
One type of distribution units used at the distribution of fibrous suspension is described<br>
in the patent specification SE 500 546. The distribution unit there comprises a<br>
distribution housing with a wide outlet opening and a pipe for the supply of the<br>
suspension to the distribution housing. In the distribution housing the suspension is<br>
deflected and simultaneously spread in lateral direction and thereafter deflected again in<br>
a passage bent in the transverse direction. Such a distribution unit delivers a uniformly<br>
distributed and parallel flow.<br>
In order to form a web of up to 10 metres width and even greater width, several<br>
distribution units are required. Each distribution unit of the type described in<br>
SE 500 546 normally is about 0,9m wide, but today they arc found to have widths of up<br>
to about 2 metres.<br>
For the supply of the suspension to the distribution units, a head box is provided<br>
substantially along the entire width of the web. The head box acts as a large equalizing<br>
box, in which the pulp shall be uniformly distributed. The head box has an outlet for<br>
each distribution unit. From each outlet a pipe extends to its distribution unit.<br>
At such a device of known art problems arise in that the pulp web becomes non-uniform<br>
seen along the entire width of the web. Each distribution unit brings about a uniform<br>
web, but the different distribution units between themselves do not bring about exactly<br>
equal webs. Problems also arise because the distribution units at times can plug.<br>
The present invention has the object to offer a method and a device for uniformly<br>
spreading and distributing a flowing medium to a web, for example a web of pulp<br>
suspension, where the medium is distributed via at least two distribution units. It has<br>
been mentioned above, that just the uniformity of the web is fully decisive for the<br>
efficiency and economy of the process.<br>
It was found that the head box at times does not deliver the same flow in all outlets.<br>
The flow distribution is achieved by static throttlings. At a pulp flow a pressure drop is<br>
created above the throttling of the respective outlet. It is this pressure drop which<br>
produces the distribution of the pulp between the different outlets. Especially at low<br>
flows the pressure drop created in the throttlings becomes too low for providing a good<br>
distribution. This in its turn results in that the different distribution units cannot be fed<br>
fully equally which, of course, results in a non-uniform web, seen totally.<br>
It is also due to the non-uniform distribution from the head box to the distribution units<br>
that the distribution units can plug.<br>
The object of the invention is achieved in that each distribution unit separately is fed<br>
with suspension via a pipe with flow control, for example by means of valves, which are<br>
controlled by a control system.<br>
In this way a uniform feed to each distribution unit is ensured and can also be controlled<br>
so, that a uniform distribution between the different distribution units is obtained. This<br>
means that to all distribution units an equally large flow is obtained.<br>
That thereby the head box can be abolished, implies several further advantages. A roll<br>
press of conventional type comprises two rotary rolls, which between themselves form a<br>
nip for dewatering the suspension. The rolls are mounted in a trough. In order not to<br>
block the way when there is need to have access to the press from above, the head box<br>
was placed outside the trough, and the distribution housing was supplied with<br>
suspension from below and outside the trough. The trough has a certain extension, seen<br>
radially, outward from the rolls. As a result thereof, the distribution unit must comprise<br>
a transport channel for the transport of the suspension from the outlet opening to the<br>
surface where the pulp web shall be formed (the rolls). The longer this transport channel<br>
is, the greater becomes the plugging risk.<br>
According to the invention, the distribution housing is fed from above. The pipes,<br>
through which the suspension is supplied, are not a hinder for the access to the press, if<br>
such access is required. The transport channel of the distribution unit can thereby be<br>
given a shorter length whereby the transport distances get shorter and, thus, the<br>
plugging risk is reduced.<br>
In the device according to the invention, as stated above, there is no need for a head<br>
box. The design of the trough has been depending on the head box, because they often<br>
must constitute one unit together or in any case be arranged adjacent one another. The<br>
fact that the head box is not needed renders it much easier to design a good trough,<br>
which is important because the trough is a bearing pan.<br>
The characterizing features of the invention are defined in the attached claims.<br>
A preferred embodiment will be described in the following, with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, where:<br>
Figure 1 shows a distribution unit;<br>
Figure 2 is a section along II-II in Fig. 1;<br>
Figure 3 is a section along III-III in Fig. 2;<br>
Figure 4 shows a principle of a dewatering device with distribution means;<br>
Figure 5 is a section along IV-IV in Fig. 4 with the distribution device formed<br>
according to known art;<br>
Figure 6 is a section along IV-IV in Fig. 4 with the distribution device formed<br>
according to the invention.<br>
The Figures 1,2 and 3 show a distribution unit 1 of the type described in SE 500 546.<br>
The distribution unit 1 is intended for transverse distribution and forming a web of a<br>
flowing medium, for example a pulp web of a fibrous suspension. The distribution unit<br>
will be described only roughly, because it is known per se. The distribution unit 1<br>
comprises a distribution housing 4 with a wide substantially rectangular outlet opening<br>
2 and a supply pipe 3 for the fibrous suspension.<br>
The outlet opening 2 transforms to a transport channel 11, which has a width equal to<br>
the outlet opening 2 and is intended to transport the suspension from the outlet opening<br>
2 to the place where the pulp web shall be formed.<br>
The distribution housing 4 is formed with a distribution chamber 5, whrh is located<br>
substantially transversally to the supply pipe 3 and extends from the connection of this<br>
pipe 3 diverging in the direction to a passage 8 bent in transverse direction. The<br>
distribution housing 4 further comprises an outlet chamber 6, which extends in the<br>
opposite direction from the defleation at the passage 8 to the outlet opening 2. The two<br>
chambers 5,6 are separated by an inner wall 7 in the housing 4 and communicate with<br>
each other via the passage 8. The medium is thereby deflected to a substantially<br>
uniformly distributed parallel flow at the outlet opening 2.<br>
Figure 4 shows in principle a dewatering device seen from above. (The dewatering<br>
devices referred to in the Figures shown are of the type described, for example, in the<br>
patent specification SE 509 519. The dewatering device comprises at least one rotary<br>
liquid permeable roll.) The dewatering device comprises two liquid permeable rolls 9<br>
and for each roll 9 a distribution device 20 for distributing a fibrous suspension on the<br>
roll 9.<br>
It appears from Figure 4, that the embodiment of a distribution device 20 comprises four<br>
distribution units 1. A distribution device 20 can, of course, comprise more or fewer<br>
distribution units 1. The number required is decided by the width of each outlet opening<br>
2 (the width of the distribution unit 1) and by the width of the web to be produced. At<br>
distribution units 1 of 1 metre width and a roll 9 of 5 metre length, thus, five distribution<br>
units 1 are required in order to obtain a pulp web over the entire length of the roll 9.<br>
Figure 5 is a section along IV-IV in Figure 4 where the distribution device is formed<br>
according to known art. Only half the dewatering device is shown, however, because it<br>
is symmetric.<br>
The distribution device comprises a head box 12, which substantially extends along the<br>
entire length of the roll 9. The head box 12 is located outside a trough 10, in which the<br>
roll 9 is mounted.<br>
The pulp suspension is fed to the head box 12, for example from a pulp tower, which is<br>
not shown. The suspension is distributed in the head box 12 and fed from below into<br>
each distribution unit 1 via its pipe 3 to the distribution chamber 5 of the distribution<br>
housing 4 and further through the distribution chamber 6 to the outlet opening 2 and<br>
further through the transport channel 11 according to the arrows in the Figure. The<br>
transport channel 11 opens at the surface of the roll 9 where the pulp web is formed.<br>
The length of the transport channel 11 depends on the design of the trough 10.<br>
Figure 6 is a section as in Figure 5, but where the distribution device 20 is formed<br>
according to the invention. Each distribution unit 1 comprises a supply pipe 3 with a<br>
flow controller 13. All flow controllers 13 are connected to a common control unit 14<br>
for controlling the flow. Via the control unit 14 the flow can be so controlled that all<br>
distribution units 1 receive a uniform supply of suspension, and that the different<br>
distribution units 1 between themselves receive a uniform flow of suspension.<br>
Each supply pipe 3 is connected from above to its distribution housing 4. The closer the<br>
supply pipe 3 is located to the roll 9, the shorter transport channel 11 is required. In the<br>
case when the supply pipe 3 is located immediately adjacent the roll, no transport<br>
channel 11 is required.<br>
No head box 12 is provided, but the pulp suspension is fed directly, suitably via a pump,<br>
from, for example, a pulp tower to each distribution unit 1 via its pipe 3. The term direct<br>
is to be understood here also so that from the tower can extend a pipe, which then<br>
branches to a pipe 3 to each distribution unit 1.<br>
As appears at a comparison between Figures 5 and 6, the transport channel 11 is shorter<br>
at a design according to Figure 6. The transport distance of the suspension and the risk<br>
of plugging are thereby reduced.<br>
A distribution device according to the invention, of course, can also comprise a head<br>
box.<br>
The flow controllers then are located after the head box. This provides a uniform and<br>
equally distributed flow to the distribution units, but is not a preferred embodiment.<br>
Although the invention is illustrated with a device for the distribution of a pulp<br>
suspension, it is obvious that the invention also is applicable to other flowing media<br>
where a uniform distribution is desired. One example thereof is the supply of treatment<br>
liquid over a material web.<br>
The invention, thus, is not restricted to the embodiments set forth above, but can be<br>
varied within the scope of the claims with reference to the description and Figures.<br><br>
