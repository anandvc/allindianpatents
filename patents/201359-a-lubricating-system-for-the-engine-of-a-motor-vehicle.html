This invention relates to a lubrication system for the engine of a motor vehicle, such as a 4-stroke motor cycle engine or other engine to which this invention is applicable. In the lubrication system for a step less transmission scooter type four-stroke engine, normally the oil is used for lubricating the cylinder head parts and crankshaft bearings and gearbox. The oil sump for both crankshaft/cylinder head lubrication and gearbox lubrication is provided separately. The oil sump of the required volume for crankshaft/cylinder head lubrication is provided below the crankshaft as an integral part of crankcase left side and right parts.<br>
The oil is drawn by oil pump from sump and pumped to various areas under pressure. To distribute oil to various places, the crankcase castings have to have interconnected holes of required size and length. The main drawback with this.design is that it involves drilling deep holes in the castings and interconnecting them. Some times if drilling of holes is not d{Mie prq)erly there is a chance of discontinuity of oil passage, lack of lubrication and ultimate failure of engine parts. Another disadvantage of the conventional design is that it cannot hold sufficient quantity of oil in drilled holes because of low volume, which leads to ineffective lubrication during starting of the engine. The oil flowing during running of the engine also gets drained into the sump after stoppage of engine.<br><br>
This invention therefore proposes to eliminate or at least substantially minimise the aforementioned drawbacks.<br>
The lubricating system for the engine of a motor vehicle, according to this invention, comprises two crankcase portions provided with oil flow passages for the flow of lubricating oil from the oil pump to the parts of the engine to be lubricated, wherein the said portions have among them at least one pair of mating cavities forming a chamber connected to the said flow passages and to the oil pump, whereby whenever the said portions are placed against each other, face to face, oil from the said pump fills up the chamber, whence oil flows from the said chamber through the passages to the said parts of the engine<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings the single Figure in which illustrates, by way of example, and not by way of limitation, one of various possible embodiments of thi^invention.<br>
The embodiment illustrated comprises a lubrication system for the engine of a motor vehicle. It comprises two crankcase portions PI and P2 provided with oil flow passages for the flow of lubricating oil from the oil pump A to the parts of the engine to be lubricated.<br><br>
The said portions PI and P2 have among them two pairs of mating cavities CI CI and C2 C2 forming two chambers whenever the said portions PI and P2 are placed face to face against each other. The chambers formed by the cavities CI CI and C2 C2 are connected to the said flow paissages and to the oil pump, whereby whenever the said portions are placed against each other, face to face, and the two chambers formed thereby, oil from the said pump fills up the chambers, whence oil flows from the oil pump to the chambers and thence through the passages to the parts of the engine to be lubricated.<br>
The cavities are conveniently cast along with the portions PI and P2 of the crankcase, eliminate drilling of deep holes for interconnection. The cast cavities C1 CI and C2 C2 hold sufficient volume of the lubricating oil whicTi does not get drained even after the engine is shut down. It is noteworthy that on starting the engine, the lubricating oil held in the chambers reaches the parts of the engine to be lubricated quickly. This helps in improving the life of engine parts and reliability. The elimination of deep drilled holes also ensures smoother lubricating oil flow passages. The cavities CI CI and C2 C2 can also be easily cleaned and washed during servicing of the engine which otherwise is not possible in the case of the conventional lubricating system.<br><br>
The terms and expressions herein are of description and not of limitation, as these do not exclude any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiments of this invention are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention:<br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A lubricating system for the engine of a motor<br>
vehicle, comprising two crankcase portions provided<br>
with oil flow passages for the flow of lubricating oil<br>
from the oil pump to the parts of the engine to be<br>
lubricated, wherein the said portions have among<br>
them at least one pair of mating cavities forming a<br>
chamber connected to the said flow passages and to<br>
die oil pump, whereby whenever die said portions are<br>
placed against each other, face to face, oil from the<br>
said pump fills up the chamber, whence oil flows<br>
from the said chamber through the passages to die<br>
said parts of the engine.<br>
2.	A lubrication system for the engine of a motor<br>
vehicle substantially as herein described and<br>
illustrated.<br><br></td>
