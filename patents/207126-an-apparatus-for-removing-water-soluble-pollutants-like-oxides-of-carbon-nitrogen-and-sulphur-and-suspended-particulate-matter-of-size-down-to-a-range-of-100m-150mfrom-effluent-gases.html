				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an apparatus for removing water soluble/  and suspended particulate matter/from effluent gases. More particularly, this invention pertains to a system which is an efficient pollution control device thai effectively removes both suspended particulate matter and also soluble noxious compounds present in gases emanating from furnaces, incinerators, burners and the like devices causing atmospheric and ground pollution.<br>
Atmospheric pollution by hot gases emanating from burner, furnace, oven, etc. causes many problems has always been a bane for the civil authorities. Such gases are invariably laden with minute solid particles, often less than 10 µm size which not only pollute the atmosphere, but also cause severe damage to the flora and fauna around the source of emission. The hot gases tend to raise the atmospheric temperature and contribute to global warming and invariably carry gaseous pollutants which are potential health hazard and may even result in acid rain destroying crops and fertility of soil. The adverse effects on floriculture in and around Kolaghat thermal power station in West Bengal is a glaring example of what damage the particulate impurities present in effluent gases can inflict<br>
To tackle this scourge of industry, such as foundries in India particularly in and around Kolkata, various types of control devices have hitherto been put to use for arresting suspended solid particles. Some such devices are, inter alia, (i) dry cyclone separator, (ii) Wet venturi scrubber, (iii) bag filter, (iv) electrostatic precipitator, etc. Most of these devices are expensive, occupy fairly large space and consume considerable amount of energy for their operation to capacity, which again adds to the operational cost apart from considerable expenditure on their installation, commissioning and maintenance.<br>
Moreover, it has been found that furnaces, burners, incinerators, etc. installed and operated by small and medium scale units cause considerable pollution because of financial constraint on one hand and lack of awareness on the other. Authorities have often taken a lackadaisical attitude towards the issues of pollution and most of the time the erring entrepreneurs have been given a wide berth.<br>
In recent times, State Pollution Control Boards and the Judiciary have taken cognizance of the pollution hazard and public awareness has also played an important<br>
2<br><br>
role in tackling the problem of pollution and formulating legislation and setting norms to determine the critical limits.<br>
The principal object of this invention is to provide an apparatus capable of removing Water soluble pollutants from gases emanating from burners, furnaces, cupolas, ovens, incinerators, crematoria and the like systems.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide an apparatus or a system for effectively controlling atmospheric and ground pollution by arresting small size (often 10 µm) particulate matters and also by substantially eliminating noxious compounds present in this effluent gases.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to devise a virtually maintenance free system for handling hot gases laden with suspended solid particles and hazardous gaseous pollutants.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide an apparatus which not only arrests particulate and gaseous impurities but also brings down the temperature of the effluent gases hereby preventing greenhouse effect.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to design, fabricate and instal an apparatus which is not only cost- effective but also uses indigenous material and technology.<br>
A still another object of this invention is to provide an apparatus or.a system for combating atmospheric and ground pollution which can be installed as an ancillar)' unit to an existing conventional pollution control device such as cyclones, bag filters, electrostatic precipitators etc.<br>
The foregoing objects are achieved by the present invention according to which<br>
there is provided an apparatus for removing water soluble pollutanis/and suspended<br>
particulate matter/from effluent gases which comprise, in combination,	<br>
(a) a tank having at least one inlet and one outlet piping systems and filled with water upto a predetermined level,<br>
(a)	a short piece with flange at one of the side walls of the tank connected to the suction<br>
side of an I. D. fan,<br>
(b)	gas settling -cum- distribution unit and main bubbler ring unit comprising<br>
(i)        a vertical downcomer pipe leading from the inlet connection flange down almost to the bottom of the tank,<br>
3<br><br>
(ii)       a settler open at the bottom to which the said down-comer pipe is connected, (iii)     a plurality of connecting arms branching out in the horizontal plane from the<br>
said settler and (iv)      ring main for allowing the gas to bubble out through the holes drilled (herein,<br>
The connecting arms are attached to the ring main distributor, usually circular in<br>
shape.<br>
The gas settling - cum - distribution unit of the subject apparatus is a cast/fabricated<br>
structure for conveying, distributing and bubbling out the inlet gas through water in<br>
the tank. The settler, the arms, the ring main and a part of the downcomer are<br>
submerged in water in the tank.<br>
Usually there are provided four numbers of connecting arms, uniformly spaced. The<br>
water tank may be equipped with a liquid level indicator, either a transducer type or<br>
a glass gauge liquid level indicator. A flange connection may be provided at the top<br>
for filling in water together with man-hole cover. A drain valve may be provided at<br>
the bottom for, The drain valve may be connected to the drain line (9) provided for<br>
the purpose to drain out the tank, as and when necessary. The space on the top cover<br>
of tank may be effectively utilised for installation of equipment like fan, motor, etc.,<br>
by adopting suitable means therefor.<br>
Hot /cold effluent gases laden with particulate and gaseous pollutants come out of<br>
the process equipment such as mentioned above. The gas enters the system through<br>
the inlet pipe either directly, or after coming out of a primary control device, to a dry<br>
cyclone separator. An induced draft fan (abbreviated as 1. D. fan) draws the gas<br>
through the device where the gas bubbles through water contained in the tank<br>
Fine suspended particles and soluble noxious pollutants get trapped / arrested /<br>
dissolved in the water and relatively clean gas is released into atmosphere through a<br>
stack at an appropriate height.<br>
The invention essentially resides in bubbling out dust laden gas through water which<br>
results in trapping suspended fine particles present in the gas. The present apparatus<br>
effectively causes particulate impurities to settle at the bottom of the tank, and<br>
utilises fluid drag, surface tension effect and normal gravitational pull, overcoming<br>
4<br><br>
the forces due to pressure gradient and buoyancy, for holding back the fine particles. All these make the process of dust separation by the apparatus very efficient. The apparatus/device of this invention has a central dust settler at the end of a down-comer which decelerates this flow and increases the residence time, thus facilitating dust separation. The distributor ring main has a number of holes in it through which the gas comes out, ensuring reasonably uniform distribution of dust particles and absorption of substantial amounts of noxious gases in water. As mentioned earlier, the gas space in the tank is connected to the suction side of the fan, which means that the I.D. fan receives a cooler gas with less volume to handle.<br>
The invention will be more particularly described by the accompanying drawings in which-<br>
Fig. 1 is the front sectional view of the subject apparatus along section AA. Fig 2 is the top view of the system, indicating therein section AA and J'ig 3 is the enlarged view of the portion marked by "X" in Fig.l. In Fig. 1 there is shown a tank of concrete/brick structure /fabricated structure (1) which houses other components of the system as well as water needed for its operation, the tentative level of which is shown by (2). The top of the tank (3) has a flange connection (4) on it for facilitating ingress of the dust laden gas in the tank (1). At one of the side-walls near the top, there is a flange (5), called "Exhaust Flange" which is connected to the suction side of the I.D. fan, drawing relatively clean air out of tank, and serving as the gas outlet.<br>
The apparatus has a gas settling -cum-distributor unit and a ring main bubbler unit, which are M.S./ C.I./ S.S. structures for conveying, distributing and bubbling out of the inlet gas through the water contained in the tank (1) and consists essentially of a vertical down comer pipe (7) leading from the inlet connection flange (4) to the settling unit (6), extension of the settling unit (14), four Nos. of distribution arms (11) and a circular ring main (8)<br>
In Fig. 2 there is shown a top view of the apparatus in which (6) is the settling unit serving as the gas settler-cum-distributor where the velocity of the particle laden hot gas is reduced. The downcomer (7) is suitably connected to the settling unit (6) Settling unit is fitted with an extension piece (14), which is open at the bottom, as shown in the enlarged view 'X' in Fig.3 of the drawings. A number of distribution<br>
5<br><br>
arms (11) branch out in the horizontal plane from the settling unit (6). These arm pipes carry holes (10) on them and, like the arms of a pulley, are connected to a circular ring main (8). The ring main serves the purpose of bubbling out the gas through two rows of holes drilled in it on angular stagger with specified triangular pitch (13). At the bottom region of the water tank, a flange is provided (9) for the drain pipe.<br>
Fig.3, is the enlarged view of the bottom portion of the settling chamber (6). This bottom portion is called the extension pipe (14).<br>
It will also be noticed from Fig.l of the drawings that the settling chamber (6), the arms (11), the ring main (8), the extension piece (14) and a portion of the down comer (7) are all submerged in water.<br>
For determining the level of water inside the tank, there may be installed a liquid level indicator, either of a glass gauge or a transducer type. The pressure in the space above water inside the tank being less than atmospheric, the glass gauge must be connected to the space above the liquid level in the tank for true recording of water level inside. One flange connection (12) for filling water into the tank. A man-hole cover may be provided at the top, which have, however, not been shown in the drawings. Moreover, the space on the top cover of the tank may further be put to use by making provision for installation of fan and motor on the said top cover itself by suitable means.<br>
