Banerjee, Proceedings of Unitecr-95 Vol 2, pp 586-593, (1995), wherein micro-porous ceramic product was developed based on alumina and alumino-silicate body compositions using napthlene as pore former. The major disadvantages of the hitherto known prior art as referred above are: <br>
1    Use of organic binder makes the process costlier.<br>
2.	Some of the organic binders causes pollution on burn out.<br>
3.	Process of foaming is costly and not viable for large scale production.<br>
in a co-pending patent application no. NF-11 / 03, we have described and claimed a process a process for the production of low cost porous ceramic tiles using marble dust. This process comprises of calcining marble dust, mixing intimately 15 to 48 wt% of the said clacined marble dust, 52 to 64 wt% of clay and 0-33 wt% wollastonite, to obtain a mixture, slaking the said mixture with water, air drying the slaked batch for a period of 40 to 48 hrs, shaping the product by known method, subjecting the shaped dried product so obtained to hydrothermal treatment in a an autoclave under a saturated vapor pressure may be in the range of 100 to 160 psi for a period in the range of 0 to 2 hours. In this process calcined marble dust is used and solidification of products is done by hydrothermal treatment.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the production of high strength porous ceramic tiles utilizing solid industrial wastes, which obviates the drawbacks of the hitherto known prior art, as mentioned above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to utilize industrial wastes, particularly marble dust and fly ash, which create enormous environmental pollution and health hazards.<br>
Yet another object of the present inver' " is to utilize marble dust in its as received form without calcinations.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the production of lighter and high strength building materials.<br>
Still yet another object of the present invention is to produce a product which is machinable and can be converted to required shapes and sizes by cutting.<br>
In the present invention there is provided a process for the production of low cost porous ceramic tiles using waste materials like marble dust and fly ash, in combination with or without clay, by firing at temperatures below 1200°C. Marble dust fines, a waste material, generated by the marble industries during cutting and polishing processes is used as a starting material. Another dreaded waste material, fly ash, mainly generated by the thermal power plant boilers, is also utilized. Formation of low temperature glassy phase on reaction between the constituent materials during firing is responsible for the strength development. The product produced by the present invention possesses bulk density in the range of 1.26 to 1.52 gm/cc, apparent porosity in the range of 36.5 to 47.5% and cold crushing strength in the range of 122 to 353 kg/cm2.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a for the production of high strength porous ceramic tiles utilizing industrial solid wastes, which comprises:<br>
(a) mixing intimately 50 to 80 wt% marble dust waste having major chemical constituents such as 35 to 37 wt% CaO, 2 to 3 wt% N2O + K20, 5 to 8 wt% MgO, 0 to 25 wt% Si02, 2 to 4 wt% Al203 and has 20 to 22 wt% loss on ignition with an average particle size (d50) in the range of 25 to 28 micrometer, with 20 to 40 wt% fly ash having chemical constituents such as 58 to 60 wt% SiO2, 27 to 30 wt% Al2O3, 2 to 4 wt% Fe2O3, 2 to 3 wt% TiO2, 2 to 3 wt% CaO, 1 to 2 wt% Na2O+K2O and has 1 to 2 wt% loss on ignition with an average particle size (d50) in range of 14 to 16 micro meter, and 0 to 12 wt% clay powder such as kaolin or ball clay type to obtain batch,<br><br><br>
(b)	mixing the above said batch as obtained from step (a) with green binder solution selected from the group consisting of polyvinyl alcohol, dextrin, carboxy methyl cellulose to obtain a product,<br>
(c)	shaping the above said products as obtained from step (b) by subjecting to hydraulic compaction at a pressure in the range of 350 to 400 kg/cm2 to obtain shaped product,<br>
(d)	Drying the above said shaped products as obtained from step (c) at a temperature ranging from 110 to 120°C for a period ranging from 24 to 30 hours to obtain dry product,<br>
(e)	firing the above said dried product as obtained form step (d) at a temperature ranging from 1150 to 1200°C followed by soaking for a period ranging from 1 to 2 hours to obtain high strength porous ceramic tiles .<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the clay powder is such as kaolin or ball clay type and passes through 200 mesh BS sieve (75 micro meter).<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the dry mixing time of the batch is in the range of 25 to 30 minutes.<br>
In still yet another embodiment of the present invention, the quantum oft green binder solution is in the range of 5 to 6 wt% of total body mix.<br>
In a yet further embodiment of the present invention, the mixing of the green binder solution with the batch is for a time period in the range of 15 to 20 minutes.<br>
In the present invention marble dust is used as a major waste material, which contains calcite (CaCO3) as major phase and wollastonite (CaO, SiO2), diopside<br>
(Ca, Mg) Si03], aragonite (CaC03) as minor phases as detected in XRD studies. Fly ash. which is another major waste material used in the process, contains Quartz (SiO?), muilite (3 AbCK 2SiO?) or siilimanite (AI2O3. 3iO?). These two ,/aste materials in combination with or without clay (AI2O3. 2SiO? 2H20) generate pores on heating at a temperature in the range of 900 to iOOO°C due to decomposition of carbonates. Beyond this temperature, a reaction sintering between lime and aiummo-siiicate results in formation of low temperature liquid phases anorthite (CaO AI2O3. 2SiO2) or gehlenite ( 2 CaO AI2O3. SiO2) phases, which binds the particles together and develops strength. Presence of free quartz and other impurities from both marble dust and fly ash might have reduced the iiquidus temperature further in association with anorthite resulting porous (lighter) products with sufficient strength in the sintering range of 1150 to 1200°C. Presence of muilite in fly ash also contributes towards strength development.<br>
The novelty of the present invention resides in providing high strength porous ceramic tiies by reaction sintering of industrial solid wastes namely marble dust and fly ash with or without clay in the temperature range of 1150 to 1200°C. Insitu pore formation during decomposition of calcite (CaCO3) mineral present in marble dust in the temperature range of 900 to 1000°C and binding of particles by low temperature ceramic bond (gehlenite / anorthite) formed in the temperature range of 1150 to 1200°C are responsible for sintered (bulk density 1.26 to 1.59 gm/cc) porous (apparent porosity 36.5 to 47%) and high strength (cold crushing strength 122 to 352 Kg/cm2) products.<br>
The non-obvious inventive steps of the process of the present invention resides in providing a synergistic composition consisting of marble dust and fly ash wastes with or without clay to obtain a mixture. Further the mixture in the form of shaped products on heat treatment at a temperature in the range of 1150 to 1200°C, produces a porous matrix embedded with low temperature glassy phase and this results in high porosity and strength in the product. The detailed process steps of the present invention are as follows:<br>
1.	Dry mixing intimately 50 to 80 wt% marble dust, 20 to 40 wt% fly ash, 0 to<br>
12 wt% clay powder for a period of 25 to 30 minutes.<br>
2.	Thorough mixing of the batch with green binder solution for a period of 15-<br>
20 minutes.<br>
3.	Shaping of articles by hydraulic compaction at a specific pressure of 350<br>
to 400 kg/cm2.<br>
4.	Drying of shaped articles in the temperature range of 110-120°C for a<br>
period of 24 to 30 hrs in an electric oven.<br>
5.	Firing of dried articles in the temperature range of 1150 to 1200°C for a<br>
