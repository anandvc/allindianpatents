PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FUMED SILICA<br>
i CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
10001]       This patent application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/796,166, filed April 28,2006 (the entire contents of ^hieh are incorporated by reference herein).<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
f 0002]      The invention pertains to processes for the production of finned silica.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
i<br>
10003]       There are many applications for fumed metal oxides, particularly for fumed silica,<br>
of extremely fine particle size. Such applications include fillers for polymers such as rubber,<br>
paper coatings (i.e., recording media), the manufacture of optical fibers and quartz glassware,<br>
thermal insulation, and chemical-mechanical polishing compositions intended for use in<br>
semiconductor manufacturing.	'<br>
[0004]      Fumed silica is generally produced by the vapor phase hydrolysis of chlorosiianes, such as silicon tetrachloride, in a hydrogen oxygen flame. Such processes are generally referred to as pyrogenic processes. The overall reaction is:   !<br>
SiCl4 + 2H2 + 02 -&gt; Si02 + 4HC1<br>
[0005]       Organosilanes also have been used in pyrogenic processes for the production of fumed silica, hi the vapor phase hydrolysis of organosilanes; the caibon-bearing fragments undergo oxidation to form carbon dioxide as a by-product along with hydrochloric acid. [0006]       In this process, submicron-sized molten spheres of silica are formed. These particles collide and fuse to form three-dimensional, branched, chain-like aggregates, of approximately 0.1 - 0.S urn in length. Cooling takes place very quickly, limiting the particle growth and ensuring that the fumed silica is amorphous. These aggregates in turn form agglomerates of 0.5 - 44 jam (about 325 US mesh). Fumed silicas generally have very high purity, with total impurities in many cases below 100 ppm (parts per million). This high<br>
purity makes fumed silica dispersions particularly advantageous for many applications.<br>
i i<br>
 <br>
[0007]       Numerous methods have been developed in the art to produce fumed silica via<br>
l<br>
pyrogenic processes. U.S. Patent 2^90,249 describes a process for the pyrogenic production Of famed silica, tn accordance with this process, a gaseous feedstock comprising a fuel, such as methane or hydrogen,, oxygen, and a volatile silicon compound, such as silicon<br>
i<br>
tetrachloride, wherein the oxygen is present in a stoichiometric or hyperstoicniometric<br>
i<br>
proportion, is fed into a burner supporting a short flame having a ratio of height to diameter<br>
of about 2:1 or below. Water formed by the combustion of the fuel in oxygen reacts with the<br>
silicon tetrachloride to produce silicon dioxide particles, which coalesce and aggregate to<br>
form fumed silica. The effluent from the burner is cooled, and the fumed silica is then<br>
collected.<br>
[0008)       U.S. Patent 4,108,964 describes a process for the pyrogenic production of fumed<br>
i sfficausmgorganosilanesasthesilicon-contairimgconjponcnt In accordance with this<br>
process, an organosilane, such as methylrricnlorosihme, is volatilized at a temperature above<br>
the boiling point of the organosilane. The vaporized organosilane is mixed with a gaseous<br>
fuel, such as hydrogen or methane, and an oxygen-containing gas containing from 15-100%<br>
oxygen, to form a feedstock. The feedstock is fed to a flame supported by a burner at various<br>
flow rates to produce fumed silica. The volume ratios of the individual gas components are<br>
reported not to be of critical importance. The molar ratio of the organosilane to the water-<br>
i forming gases generally is said to be in the range of from 1:0 to 1:12.<br>
[0009]       Despite the foregoing processes for producing fumed silica, there remains a need<br>
for other processes for producing turned silica, especially processes for producing fumed<br>
silica more economically and/or efficiently, wherein the fumed silica exhibits desirable<br>
properties such as panicle uniformity, dispersibility, and the nice.<br>
[0010]       The invention provides such a process. These and other advantages of the<br>
invention, as well as additional inventive features, will be apparent from the description of<br>
the invention provided herein.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0011]      The invention provides a process for the production of fumed silica comprising (a) providing a silicon halide feedstock comprising about 80% to |100% melhyltrichlorosilane, (b) combining the silicon halide feedstock with hydrogen gas and oxygen gas to form a reactant mixture, (c) discharging the teactant mixture out of a burner, wherein the hydrogen (Hfe) is present in a mole fraction of about 0.11 or less based oh the reactant mixture and/or<br>
 <br>
the velocity of the reactant mixture upon exiting the burner is about 25 m/s or more, and (d) combusting the hydrogen gas and the oxygen gas of the reactant mixture so as to bydrolyze the silicon haiide to produce fumed silica.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0012]       The invention provides a process for the production of fumed silica. The process<br>
comprises (a) providing a silicon halide feedstock, (b) combining the silicon haiide feedstock<br>
i with hydrogen gas and an oxygen gas to form a reactant mixture, (c) discharging the reactant<br>
mixture out of a burner, and (d) combusting the hydrogen gas and the oxygen gas of the<br>
reactant mixture so as to hydrolyze the silicon haiide to produce fumed silica.<br>
[0013]      The silicon haiide can be any silicon haiide capable of undergoing hydrolysis to<br>
the corresponding oxide, i.e., silica, under the conditions imposed thereon in the hydrolysis<br>
flame. Suitable silicon halides include, for example, silicon tetrachloride, silicon<br>
tetrafluoride, methyitrichlorosilane, trichlorosilane, dimethylidichlorosilane,<br>
methyldichlorosilanc, methyldichloroflurosilaue, dichlorosiiane, dibutyldichlorosilane,<br>
ethyltrichlorosilanc, propyltrichlorosilane, and mixtures thereof.<br>
(00141       The silicon haiide feedstock comprises about 80% to 100% methyltrichlorosilane<br>
(e.g., about 83% to 100% metbyltrichlorosllane, about 85% tjo 100% methsdtrichlorosilane, or<br>
about 87% to 100% methyltrichlorosilane). The silicon haiide feedstock preferably<br>
comprises about 90% to 100% memyttrichlorosilane (e.g., about 91% to 100%<br>
memyitricblorosiiane, about 92% to 100% methyltrichlorosilane, about 93% to 100%<br>
methyltrichlorosilane, or about 94% to 100% methylrrichlorosilane). More preferably, the<br>
silicon haiide feedstock comprises about 95% to 100% methyltrichlorosilane (eg., about 96%<br>
to 100% methyltrichlorosilane, about 97% to 100% methyltrichlorosilane, about 98% to<br>
100% methyltrichlorosilane, or about 99% to 100% methyltrichlorosilane). Most preferably,<br>
the silicon haiide feedstock is pure or substantially pure methyltrichlorosilane (eg., about<br>
99.5% to 100% methyltrichlorosilane, about 99.8% to 100% methyltrichlorosilane, about<br>
99.9% to 100% methyltrichlorosilane, about 100% methyltrichlorosilane). Ideally, the silicon<br>
i<br>
haiide feedstock is 100% methyltrichlorosilane.<br>
(0015}      The silicon haiide feedstock typically is rendered gaseous or vaporized before being combined with the hydrogen gas and the oxygen gas to forrn the reactant mixture. The silicon haiide feedstock can be rendered gaseous or vaporized in any suitable manner. For<br>
 <br>
example, the silicon halide feedstock can be rendered gaseous or vaporized by exposure to a<br>
suitably high temperature environment.<br>
[0016]       The hydrogen gas can be provided from any suitable source and in any suitable<br>
manner.<br>
{0017]       The oxygen gas represents the oxidant for the combustion of the hydrogen gas in<br>
the process of the invention and can be employed in its pure state or admixed with other<br>
gases. Thus, the oxygen gas can be supplied as pure or substantially pure oxygen, as air, or<br>
as oxygen-enriched air. Moreover, if desired, the oxygen gas can be provided in the form of<br>
oxygen admixed with other gases such as nitrogen, argon, helium, carbon dioxide, and/or<br>
hydrogen halide.<br>
10018]      When the oxygen gas is not supplied in pure fbrmj, e.g., when the oxygen gas is<br>
supplied as part of an oxygen-containing gas, there may or may not be water, e.g., water<br>
vapor or moisture, present with the oxygen gas. For exampH when the oxygen gas is<br>
provided by supplying air, water will be present along with the oxygen gas. In such<br>
situations where water is present with the oxygen gas, such as with air, the water is optionally<br>
removed, in whole or in part, from the oxygen-containing gas. If the removal of the water<br>
from the oxygen-containing gas is desired, then the water rwrioval can be accomplished in<br>
any suitable manner, e.g., by drying the air supplying the oxygen gas.<br>
!<br>
[0019]      The reactant mixture comprises the silicon halide feedstock, the hydrogen gas, and the oxygen gas. As such, the reactant mixture generally is in gaseous form- The reactant mixture desirably comprises an at least stoichiometric quantity of the hydrogen gas and, preferably, an at least stoichiometric quantity of the oxygen gas. In other words, the reactant mixture desirably comprises a sufficient concentration of hydrogen gas so as to provide, upon combustion thereof, sufficient water to convert all or substantially all of the silicon halide of the reactant mixture to the corresponding oxide, i.e., silica. Moreover, the concentration of the oxygen gas forming part of the mixture desirably is at least sufficient to bum all or substantially all of the hydrogen gas of the reactant mixture. Preferably, the concentrations of the hydrogen gas and the oxygen gas components of the reactant mixture are at least slightly in excess of the stoichiometric requirements described herein.;<br>
[0020]       Hydrogen (Hj) desirably is present in a mole fraction of about 0.11 or less based on rhe reactant mixture, i.e., the total moles of all of the reactant mixmre components, which include, but are not limited to, the motes of the silicon halide feedstock, the hydrogen gas, and the oxygen gas. The Hj mole fraction QCm) can be deteniimed by dividing the moles of<br>
 <br>
Hj by die total moles of all of the reactant mixture components. The moles of Hz include (a) the moles of H2 in the hydrogen gas, (b) ™£ moles, if any, of H2 m the oxygen-containing gas, and (c) the moles of H^ that are provided, as a practical matter, from the silicon halide feedstock components (Le., those silicon halide feedstock components that bum quickly to provide contribute Ha to the total moles of Hz in the reaction mixture, such as trichlorosilane (TCS) if present in me silicon halide feedstock, but not from mcthyltrichlorosilane, or from silicon tetrachloride or other such silicon halides if present in the silicon halide feedstock). The moles of Hz provided by any trichlorosilane in the silicon! halide feedstock are equal one-half (1/2) of the moles of the trichlorosilane. The Hz mole fraction can be about 0.06 or more (e.g_, about 0.07 or more, about 0.075 or more, about 0.08 or more, about 0.085 or more, or about 0.09 or more). The H2 mole fraction can be about 0.1 or less (e.g., about 0.095 or less, about 0.09 or less, about 0.085 or less, or about 0.08 or less). Typically, the H? mole fraction is about 0.06 to about 0.11 (eg., about 0.07 to about 0.1, or abput 0.075 to about 0.095). [0021)      The silicon halide feedstock, the hydrogen gas, and the oxygen gas can be combined to form the reactant mixture in any suitable manner} For example, the reactant mixture can be formed by combining the silicon halide feedstock, the hydrogen gas, and the oxygen gas prior to passing the reactant mixture into a burner J or the reactant mixture can be formed by combining the silicon halide feedstock, the hydrogen gas, and the oxygen gas in a burner, e.g., at or prior to the zone where the combustion of the hydrogen gas and the oxygen gas takes place.<br>
{0022]       The burner comprises an inlet end and a discharge end or mouth. The inlet end can define a receiving and mixing chamber wherein the reactant mixture components are introduced and combined to form the reactant mixture. Thus, for instance, the silicon halide feedstock, the hydrogen gas, and the oxygen gas can be separately introduced via separate conduits into the burner, where the reactant mixture components are combined to form the reactant mixture. Alternatively, two or all three of the silicon halide feedstock, the hydrogen gas, and the oxygen gas can be partially or entirely combined in a' common conduit prior to entry thereof into the burner.<br>
[0023]       The reactant mixture is discharged from the burner and is preferably, but not necessarily, projected into a suitable enclosed reaction space. The velocity of the reactant mixture upon exiting the burner desirably is about 2S m/s or more (e.g^ about 30 m/s or more, about 35 m/s or more, or about 40 m/s or more). The velocity of the reactant mixture upon exiting the burner can be about 100 m/s or less (e.g., about 95 m/s or less, about 90 m/s<br>
 <br>
or less, about 85 m/s or less, about 80 m/s or less, about 75 m/s or less, about 70 m/s or less, about 65 m/s or less, about 60 m/s or less, about 55 m/s or less, about 50 m/s or less, or about 45 m/s or less). Typically, the velocity of the reactant mixture upon exiting the burner is about 25 m/s to about 100 m/s (e.g., about 30 m/s to about 50 m/s, or about 35 m/s to about 45 m/s).<br>
(0024)       A combustible gas or vapor separate from the reactant mixture can be fed into and discharged from an annular space adjacent the burner discharge end or mouth. The combustible gas or vapor discharged near the discharge end of the burner can be any suitable<br>
j<br>
gas or vapor which does not react deleteriously with the components of the reactant mixture or with the products of the combustion process. Suitable combustible gases inchide hydrogen and methane. The flow rate of the combustible gas through the annular space desirably is suffieieat to keep the mouth of the burner free of attachments of solid substances and to avoid the formation of halogen gas in waste gases. Any suitable amount of combustible gas can be utilized to achieve such results.<br>
(0025]      The oxygen gas undergoes a combustion reaction with the hydrogen gas to form water. Water formation leads to the hydrolysis of the siUconjhalide and the production of fumed silica.<br>
[0026]      At die zone of the combustion reaction, there exists a flame, which can be characterized by a laminar flame speed. The laminar flame speed can be determined in accordance with known techniques, such as described in the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Codes and Standards, particularly "NFPA 68 (2002 Edition) (see especially Appendix D thereof). The laminar flame speed can be about 10 cm/s or more (e.g., about 20 cm/s or more, about 30 cm/s or more, about 35 cm/s or more, about 40 cm/s or mote, or about 45 cm/s or more). The laminar flame speed c$n be about 80 cm/s or less (e.g., about 70 cm/s or less, about 65 cm/s or less, about 60 cm/s or less, about 55 cm/s or less about 50 cm/s or less, about 45 cm/s or less, or about 40 cm/s or less). The laminar flame speed desirably is about 20 cm/s to about 70 cm/s (e.g., about 30 cm/s to about 60 cm/s, or about 35 cm/s to about 50 cm/s), such as about 35 cm/s to about 41 cm/s, or even about 42 cm/s to about 48 cm/s.<br>
[0027]      The reactant mixture then is provided with an environment within which the combustion process can be cooled and brought to completion: Preferably, this environment is defined by the enclosed reaction space, e.g., by a reaction chamber. The combustion process can be cooled in any suitable manner. For example, the combustion process can be cooled by<br>
 <br>
feeding a non-combustible gas into a reaction chamber in the reaction space. Alternatively,<br>
the combustion process can be cooled by feeding a non-combustible gas or other suitable<br>
substance into a space adjacent to the reaction space, e.g., into an annular space adjacent the<br>
reaction, space. Suitable non-combustible gases include air, ojdygen, and nitrogen. In that<br>
respect, in particular, toe non-combustible gas can cloak the hydrolysis reaction flame and<br>
thereby cool the reaction products (herefrom to below the sintering temperature of the fumed<br>
i silica reaction product.<br>
(0028]       As the hydrolysis reaction flame hydrolyzes the silicon halide to produce fumed<br>
silica, careful control of the H2 mole fraction and/or burner velocity as described herein<br>
serves to stabilise the hydrolysis reaction flame despite the relatively high concentration of<br>
methyltrichlorosilane in the silicon halide feedstock. The increased stability of the hydrolysis<br>
reaction flame provides for an efficient and consistent production of fumed silica.<br>
[0029]       Fumed silica typically exists in the form of aggregates of primary particles,<br>
especially aggregates having a chain-like structure composed of primary particles. Primary<br>
particles are formed by covalent bonds between atoms comprising the particles and are stable<br>
to all but the harshest conditions. At the next level of structure, primary particles are<br>
associated into secondary particles, generally referred to as aggregates. Aggregate particles<br>
comprise primary particles and are bonded together by covalent bonds and electrostatic<br>
interactions, and typically are resistant to degradation by, eg., mechanical energy inputs such<br>
as high-shear mixing. At the next level of structure, aggregates are more loosely associated<br>
into agglomerates. Typically, agglomerates can be disassociated into the constituent<br>
aggregates via mechanical energy inputs.	j<br>
{0030]       The fumed silica produced by the inventive process can have any suitable average<br>
primary particle size, aggregate particle size, agglomerate particle size, and surface area.<br>
Particle size is the diameter of the smallest sphere that encloses or encompasses the particle.<br>
Surface area is determined by the well-known BET method.   ;<br>
{0031}       The fumed silica can have an average primary particle size of about 2 nm or more<br>
(eg., about 3 nm or more, about 5 nm or more, about 10 nm or more, about 1S nm or more,<br>
about 20 nm or more, about 25 nm or more, about 30 nm or mere, or about 35 nm or more).<br>
The fumed silica can have an average primary particle size of about 50 nm or less (e.g., about<br>
45 nm or less, about 40 nm or less, about 35 run or less, about 30 run or less, about 30 nm or<br>
less, about 25 nm or less, about 20 nm or less, about 15 nm oritess, about 10 nm or less, or<br>
about 5 nm or less). For example, the fumed silica can have ah average primary particle size<br>
 <br>
of about 2 nm to about 50 nm (e.g., about 5 nmto about 40 nm, about 5 nm to about 30 nm, about 5 am to about 20nm, about 5 nm to about 15 nm, about io nm to about 40 nm, about 10 nm to about 30 nm, or about 10 nm to about 20 nm).<br>
[0032]      The fumed silica can have an average aggregate paxjticle size of about 50 nm or more (e.g., about 60 nm or more, about 70 nm or more, about 80 nm or more, about 90 nm or more, about 100 mn or more, about 150 nm or more, or about 200 nm or more). The fumed silica can have an average aggregate particle size of about 400 nm or less (e.g., about 350 nm or less, about 300 nm or less, about 250 nm or less, about 200 liun or less, about 150 nm or less, or about 100 nm or less). For example, the fumed silica can have an average aggregate particle size of about 50 nm to about 400 nm (e.g., about 100 np to about 300 nm, or about 200 mn to about 300 nm).<br>
[O033J      The finned silica can have a BET surface area of about 50 mVg or more (e_g.,<br>
about 100 m2/g or more;, about 150 ra2/g or more, about 200 m2/jg or more* about 250 m2/g or<br>
more, or about 300 m2/g or more). The fumed silica can have * BET surface area of about<br>
600 mVg or less (e.g., about 500 mVg or less, about 400 m2/g e-r less, about 300 m2/g or less,<br>
about 250 m2/g or less, or about 200 m2/g or less). For examplje, the finned silica can have a<br>
BET surface area of about 50 m2/g to about 400 m2/g (fe.g., abcjui 90 m2/g to about 380 mz/g.<br>
about 100 m2/g to about 350 m2/g, about 150 m2/g to about 250 m'/g, or about 200 m2/g to<br>
about 300 m2/g).	j<br>
