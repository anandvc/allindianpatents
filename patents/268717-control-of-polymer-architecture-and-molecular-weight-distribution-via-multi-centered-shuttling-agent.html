This application claims the benefit of U.S, Provisional Application No. 60/717,543, filed September 15, 2005.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for polymerizing a monomer or mixtures of two or more monomers such as mixtures of ethylene and one or more comonomers, to form an interpolymer product having unique physical properties, to a process for preparing such interpolymers, and to the resulting polymer products. In another aspect, the invention relates to the articles prepared from these polymers. The inventive polymer products include blends of generally uniform chemical composition and relatively broad molecular weight distribution, including a blend of two or more polymers of uniform monomer composition but differing in that at least one component has substantially higher in molecular weight than at least one other component. Also included are mixtures of two or more polymers comprising regions or segments (blocks) of differing chemical composition, characterized by the foregoing molecular weight distribution characteristics. In addition, at least one of the constituents of the polymer mixture contains a linking group which is the remnant of a multi-centered shuttling agent, causing the polymer to possess unique physical properties. These polymeric products and blends comprising the same are usefully employed m the preparation of solid articles such as moldings, films, sheets, and foamed objects by molding, extruding, or other processes, and are useful as components or ingredients in adhesives, laminates, polymeric blends, and other end uses. The resulting products are used in the manufacture of components for automobiles, such as profiles, bumpers and trim parts; packaging materials; electric cable insulation, and other applications.<br>
The use of certain metal alkyl compounds and other compounds, such as hydrogen, as chain transfer agents to interrupt chain growth in olefin polymerizations is well known in the art. In addition, it is known to employ such compounds, especially aluminum alkyl compounds, as scavengers or as cocatalysts in olefin polymerizations. In Macromolecules, 33, 9192-9199 (2000) the use of certain alimiinum trialkyl compounds as chain transfer agents in combination with certain paired zirconocene catalyst compositions resulted in polypropylene mixtures containing small quantities of polymer fractions containing both isotactic and atactic chain segments. In Liu and Rytter, Macromolecular Rapid Comm., 22,952-956 (200.1) and Bruaseth and Rytter, Macromolecules. 36, 3026-3034 (2003) mixtures of ethylene and 1-hexene were polymerized by a similar catalyst composition containing trimethylaluminum chain transfer agent. In the latter<br><br>
reference, the authors summarized the prior art studies in the following manner (some citations omitted):<br>
"Mixing of two metallocenes with known polymerization behavior can be used to control polymer microstructure. Several studies have been performed of ethene polymerization by mixing two metallocenes. Common observations were that, by combining catalysts which separately give polyethene with different Mw, polyethene with broader and in some cases faimodal MWD can be obtained. [S]oares and Kim (J. Polvm. Sci.. Part A: Polvm. Chem. 38, 1408-1432 (2000)) developed a criterion in order to test the MWD bimodality of polymers made by dual single-site catalysts, as exemplified by ethene/1-hexene copolymerization of the mixtures Et(Ind)2ZrCl2/Cp3HfCl2 and Et(Ind)2ZrCl2/ CGC (constrained geometry catalyst) supported on silica. Heiland and Kaminsky (Makromol. Chem.. 193, 601-610 (1992)) studied a mixture of Et"(Ind)2ZrCl2 and the hafnium analogue in copolymerization of ethene and l-butene.<br>
These studies do not contain any indication of interaction between the two different sites, for example, by readsorption of a terminated chain at the alternative site. Such reports have been issued, however, for polymerization of propene. Chien et al. (J. Polvm. Sci.. Part A: Polvm. Chem.. 37, 2439-2445 (1999), Makromol.. 30, 3447-3458 (1997)) studied propene polymerization by homogeneous binary zirconocene catalysts, A blend of isotactic polypropylene (i-PP), atactic polypropylene (a-PP), and a stereoblock fraction (i-PP-Z)-a-PP) was obtained with a binary system comprising an isospecific and an aspecific precursor with a borate and TIBA as cocatalyst. By using a binary mixture of isospecific and syndiospecific zirconocenes, a blend of isotactic polypropylene (i-PP), syndiotactic polypropylene (s-PP), and a stereoblock fraction (i-PP-b-s-PP) was obtained. The mechanism for formation of the stereoblock fraction was proposed to involve the exchange of propagating chains between the two different catalytic sites, Przybyla and Fink ( Acta Polym., 50, 77-83 (1999)) used two different types of metallocenes (isospecific and syndiospecific) supported on the same silica for propene polymerization. They reported that, with a certain type of silica support, chain transfer between the active species in the catalyst system occurred, and stereoblock PP was obtained. Lieber and Brintzinger (Macromol 3,9192-9199 (2000)) have proposed a more detailed explanation of how the transfer of a growing polymer chain from one type of metallocene to another occurs. They studied propene polymerization by catalyst mixtures of two different ansa-Zirconocenes. The different catalvsts were first studied individually with regard to their tendency toward alkyl-polymeryl exchange with the<br><br>
alkylaluminum activator and then pairwise with respect to tlieir capability to produce polymers with a stereoblock structure. They reported that formation of stereoblock polymers by a mixture of zirconocene catalysts with different stereoselectivities is contingent upon an efficient polymeryl exchange between the Zr catalyst centers and the Al centers of the cocatalyst." <br>
Brusath and Rytter then disclosed their own observations using paired zirconocene catalysts to polymerize mixtures of ethylene/1-hexene and reported the effects of the influence of the dual site catalyst on polymerization activity, incorporation of comonomer, and polymer microstructure using methylalumoxane cocatalyst.<br>
Analysis of the foregoing results indicate that Rytter and coworkers likely failed to utilize combinations of catalyst, cocatalyst, and third components that were capable of readsorption of the polymer chain from the chain transfer agent onto both of the active catalytic sites, that is they failed to obtain two-way readsorption. While indicating that chain termination due to the presence of trimethylaluminum likely occurred with respect to polymer formed from the catalyst incorporating minimal comonomer, and thereafter that polymeryl exchange with the more open catalytic site followed by continued polymerization hkely occurred, evidence of the reverse flow of polymer ligands appeared to be lacking in the reference. In fact, in a later communication, Rytter^ et. al.., Polymer. 45, 7853-7861 (2004), it was reported that no chain transfer between the catalyst sites actually took place in the earlier experiments. Similar polymerizations were reported in WO98/34970.<br>
In USP's 6,380,341 and 6,169,151, use of a "fluxional" metallocene catalyst, that is a metallocene capable of relatively facile conversion between two stereoisomeric forms having differing polymerization characteristics such as differing reactivity ratios was said to result in production of olefin copolymers having a "blocky" structure. Disadvantageously, the respective stereoisomers of such metallocenes generally fail to possess significant difference in polymer formation properties and are incapable of forming both highly crystalline and amorphous block copolymer segments, for example, from a given monomer mixture under fixed reaction conditions. Moreover, because the relative ratio of the two "fluxional" forms of the catalyst cannot be varied, there is no ability, using "fluxional" catalysts, to vary polymer block composition or to vary the ratio of the respective blocks.<br>
In JACS. 2004, 126,10701-10712, Gibson, et al discuss the effects of "catalyzed living polymerization" on molecular weight distribution. The authors define catalyzed living polymerization in this manner:<br>
"..if chain transfer to aluminum constitutes the sole transfer mechanism and the exchange of the growing polymer chain between the transition metal and the aluminum<br><br>
centers is very fast and reversiblej the polymer chains will appear to be growing on the aluminum centers. "This can then reasonably be described as a catalyzed cham growth reaction on aluminum. „An attractive manifestation of this type of chain growth reaction is a Poisson distribution of product molecular weights, as opposed to the Schulz-Flory distribution that arises when |3-H transfer accompanies propagation,"<br>
The authors reported the results for the catalyzed living horaopolymerization of ethylene using an iron, containing catalyst in combination with ZpBt2, ZnMe2, or Zn(i-Pr)2, Homoleptic allcyls of aluminum, boron, tin, lithium, magnesium and lead did not induce catalyzed chain growth. Using GaMe3 as cocatalyst resulted in production of a polymer having a narrow molecular weight distribution. However, after analysis of time-dependent product distribution, the authors concluded this reaction was, "not a simple catalyzed chain growth reaction." Similar processes employing similar catalysts have been described in USP's 5,210,338, 5,276,220, and 6,444,867.<br>
It is known in the art that the presence of long chain branching (LCB) may improve certain polymer characteristics, especially processability and melt strength. The presence of LCB in a polymer is characterized by the occurrence of polymer moieties of a length greater than that of any C3-8 olefin comonomer remnant attached to the main, backbone polymer chain. In prior art techniques, long chain branching may be generated in a polymer by incorporation of a vinyl-terminated macromer (either deliberately added or formed in situ during a polymerization such as through p-hydride elimination) either by action of the polymerization catalyst itself or by the use of a linking agent These methods generally suffer from incomplete incorporation of the vinyl-terminated macromer or linking moiety into the polymer, and/or a lack of control over the extent of XX3B for given process conditions.<br>
There remains a need in the art for a polymerization process that is capable of preparing copolymers having unique properties in a high yield process adapted for commercial utilization. Moreover, it would be desirable if there were provided an improved process for preparing polymers, including copolymers of two or more comonomers such as ethylene and one or more comonomers, by the use of a multi-centered shuttling agent (MSA) to introduce coupled or branched properties, including long chain branching, in the resulting pseudo-block copolymers, in a controlled manner. More specifically, it would be desirable to provide a method for generating long chain branching in olefin polymers that does not require incorporation of a polymerizable functional group, such as a vinyl group into the polymer chain. In addition it would be desirable to provide such an improved process for preparing the foregoing coupled or branched pseudo-block copolymer products in a continuous process.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention there is now provided an olefin polymer composition uniquely characterized by a broad, especially a multimodal molecular weight distribution and a process for the preparation thereof In particular, the present composition comprises two or more olefin polymers differing m molecular weights, wherein the weight average molecular weights of at least two such polymers differ by approximately an integer multiple. The polymer mixture is prepared in situ by the polymerization of one or more addition polymerizable monomers, preferably of two or more addition polymerizable monomers, especially ethylene and at least one copolymerizable comonomer, propylene and at least one copolymerizable comonomer having 4 or more carbons, or 4-methyl-l-pentene and at least one different copolymerizable comonomer having 4 or more carbons, optionally comprising multiple blocks or segments of differentiated polymer composition or properties, especially blocks or segments comprising differing comonomer incorporation levels. The process comprises contacting an addition polymerizable monomer or mixture of monomers under addition polymerization conditions with a composition comprising at least one addition polymerization catalyst, a cocatalyst and a multi-centered shuttling agent.<br>
Because the polymer is comprised of at least some polymer joined by means of one or more remnants of a multi-centered shuttling agent, the resulting polymeric composition possesses unique physical and chemical properties compared to random mixtures of polymers of the same gross chemical composition and compared to pseudo-block copolymers prepared with a chain shuttling agent lacking in multiple shuttling centers. Depending on the number of active centers in the multi-centered shuttling agent, that is, whether each shuttling agent molecule has two, three or more active shuttling sites, and the number of separate additions of such agent, the resulting polymer may be distinctly multi-modal or form a more uniform, broad distribution of molecular weight polymers and/or branched or multiply branched. In general, the resulting polymers contain reduced incidence of crosslinked polymer formation evidenced by reduced gel fraction. Preferably, the polymers of the invention comprise less than 2 percent of a crosslinked gel fraction, more preferably less than 1 percent crosslinked gel fraction, and most preferably less than 0.5 percent of crosslinked gel fraction.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention there is provided a copolymer, especially such a copolymer comprising m polymerized form ethylene and a copolymerizable comonomer, propylene and at least one copolymerizable comonomer having from 4 to 20 carbons, or 4-methyl-l-pentene and at least one different copolymerizable comonomer having from 4 to 20 carbons, said copolymer comprising two or more, preferably two or three intramolecular regions comprising differing chemical or physical properties, especially regions of differentiated comonomer incorporation, joined in a dimeric, linear, branched or polybranched polymer structure. Such polymers may be<br><br>
prepared by altering the polymerization conditions during a polymerization that includes a multi-centered shuttling agent, for example by using two reactors with differing comonomer ratios, multiple catalysts with differing comonomer incorporation abilities, or a combination of such process conditions, and optionally a polyfunctional coupling agent.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention there is provided a process and the resulting polymer, said process comprising:<br>
polymerizing one or more olefin monomers in the presence of an olefin polymerization catalyst and a multi-centered shuttling agent (MSA) in a polymerization reactor or zone thereby causing the formation of at least some quantity of a polymer joined with the remnant of the multi-centered shuttling agent.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention there is provided a process and the resulting polymer, said process comprising:<br>
polymerizing one or more olefin monomers in the presence of an olefin polymerization catalyst and a multi-centered shuttling agent (MSA) in a polymerization reactor or zone thereby causing the formation of at least some quantity of an initial polymer joined with the remnant of the multi-centered shuttling agent within the reactor or zone;<br>
discharging the reaction product from the first reactor or zone to a second polymerization reactor or zone operatmg under polymerization conditions that are distinguishable from those of the first polymerization reactor or zone;<br>
transferring at.least some of the initial polymer joined with the remnant of the multi-centered shuttling agent to an active catalyst site in the second polymerization reactor or zone by means of at least one remaining shuttling site of the multi-centered shuttling agent; and<br>
conducting polymerization in the second polymerization reactor or zone so as to form a second polymer segment bonded to some or all of the initial polymer by means of a remnant of the multi-centered shuttling agent, said second polymer segment having distinguishable polymer properties from the initial polymer segment<br>
Highly desirably, the polymer products herein comprise at least some quantity of a polymer containing two or more blocks or segments joined by means of a renmant of a multi-centered shutting agent. Generally the product comprises distinct polymer species having different molecular weights, ideally the larger molecular weights being integer multiples of the smallest. As a general rule, the product comprises a first polymer having a first molecular weight and at least some quantity of a second polymer having a molecular weight that is approximately an integer multiple of the molecular weight of the first polymer, wherein the integer is equal to the number of shuttling centers in the shuttling agent The polymer recovered from the present process may be terminated to form conventional type polymers, coupled through use of a polyfunctional coupling<br><br>
agent to form multiblock copolymers, including hyper-branched or dendrimeric copolymers, or functionalized by conversion of remnants of the multi-centered shuttling agents into vinyl-hydroxyl-, amine-, silane, carboxylic acid-, carboxylic acid ester, ionomeric, or other functional groups, according to known techniques,<br>
hi one embodiment of the invention a two-centered shuttling agent is used, resulting in polymers containing at least some quantity of a polymer containing the remnant of the two-centered chain shuttling agent and further step growth polymers based thereon. The resulting product is a polydisperse, in situ prepared, polymer blend, typically having a bimodal molecular weight distribution with one peak approximately twice the molecular weight of the other. If both a multi-centered shuttling agent and a monocenter chain shuttling agent are employed, either simultaneously or sequentially in the same polymerization, the result is a mixture of polymer products having polydisperse molecular weight distribution and pseudo-block copolymer properties.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the multi-centered shuttling agent employed in the foregoing processes is a two-centered shuttling agent, which uniquely causes the formation of a product comprising distinct polymer segments after undergoing sequential polymerization in two reactors or zones connected in series. In a further preferred embodiment, the two-centered shuttling agent's active sites are located near or at both termini of a linear shuttling agent (or form such a shuttlmg agent by ring opening of a cyclic MSA) and result in the formation of terminally functionalized polymers, including those polymers converted into further functional groups as previously disclosed. The foregoing two-centered shuttling agents are referred to here-in-aiter as α ω -two-centered shuttling agents due to their usefulness in the formation of α ω -di-ftmctionaIized polymers, particularly low molecular weight α ω -dihydroxy- orα ω -divinyl- substituted polyolefins having a molecular weights from 500 to 10,000, preferably from 1000 to 6000. Such products may be prepared by the reaction of oxygen or an oxygen - containing electrophile with the alpha-omega di-metallated polymer formed by incorporation of the presentα ω -two-centered shuttling agent mto a growing polymer, or by displacement of the metal center with an olefin, such as ethylene, to make the α ω -diene, which may then be converted to the diol by hydrofonnylation and hydrogenation if desired. Such polymers, especially low molecular weight versions thereof are useful for conversion to polyurethanes, polyesters, and other products used in coating, adhesive, sealant and elastomer production.<br>
In the foregoing embodiments of the invention, the resulting polymer may be linear or contain one or more branching centers, depending on whether a two-centered-, three-centered-, or higher centered shuttling agent is employed. Highly desirably, the foregoing copolymers are cliaracterized by terminal blocks or segments of polymer having higher tacticity or crystallinity from at least some remaining blocks or segments. Even more preferably, the polymer is a triblock<br><br>
copolymer comprising a central polymer block or segment that is relatively amorphous or even elastomeric.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the MSA is a three centered shuttling agent and the resulting polymers are characterized by the presence of long chain branching. In this embodiment, there is furthermore provided a method for generating long chain branching in olefin polymers without use of a polymerizable functional group, such as a vinyl group. Instead, the LCB branch point is the remnant of such a three-centered MSA. Because the extent of LCB in the polymer is easily controlled by addition of the three centered MSA to a polymerization reaction at the desired rate the resulting process is advantaged over prior art processes.<br>
In a still further embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a polymer mixture comprising: (1) an organic or inorganic polymer, preferably a homopolymer of ethylene or of propylene and/or a copolymer of ethylene or propylene with one or more copolymerizable comonomers, and (2) a polymer or polymer mixture according to the present invention or prepared according to the process of the present invention.<br>

Also, any references to a Group or Groups shall be to the Group or Groups reflected in this Periodic Table of the Elements using the lUPAC system for numbering groups. Unless stated to the contrary, implicit from the context, or customary in the art, all parts and percents are based on weight. For purposes of United States patent practice, the contents of any patent, patent application, or publication referenced herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety (or the equivalent US version thereof is so incorporated by reference) especially with respect to the disclosure of synthetic techniques.<br><br>
definitions (to the extent not inconsistent with any definitions provided herein) and general knowledge in the art.<br>
The term "comprising" and derivatives thereof is not intended to exclude the presence of any additional portion, component, step or procedure, whether or not the same is disclosed herein. In order to avoid any doubt, all compositions claimed herein through use of the term "comprising" may include any additional additive, adjuvant, or compound whether polymeric or otherwise, unless stated to the contrary. In contrast, the term, "consisting essentially of excludes from the scope of any succeeding recitation any other portion, component, step or procedure, excepting those that are not essential to operability. The term "consisting of excludes any portion, component, step or procedure not specifically delineated or listed. The term 'or", unless stated otherwise, refers to the listed members individually as well as in any combination.<br>
The term "polymer", includes both homopolymers, that is, homogeneous polymers prepared from a single monomer, and copolymers (interchangeably referred to herein as interpolymers), meaning polymers prepared by reaction of at least two monomers or otherwise containing chemically differentiated segments or blocks therein even if formed from a single monomer. More specifically, the term "polyethylene" includes homopolymers of ethylene and copolymers of ethylene and one or more C3-8 a-olefins. The term "crystalline" if employed, refers to a polymer that possesses a first order transition or crystalline melting point (Tm) as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) or equivalent technique. The term may be used interchangeably with the term "semicrystalline". The term "amorphous" refers to a polymer lacking a crystalline melting point. The term "elastomer" or "elastomeric" refers to a polymer or polymer segment having Tg less than 0°C, more preferably less than -15°C, most preferably less than -25°C, and a sample of which, when deformed by application of stress, is generally capable of recovering its size and shape when the deforming force is removed. Specifically, as used herein, elastic or elastomeric is meant to be that property of any material which upon application of a biasing force, permits that material to be stretchable to a length which is at least 25 percent greater than its unbiased length without rupture, and that will cause the material to recover at least 40 percent of its elongation upon release of the force. A hypothetical example which would satisfy this definition of an elastomeric material would be a 1 cm sample of a material which may be elongated to a length of at least 1.25 cm and which, upon being elongated to 1.25 cm and released, will recover to a length of not more than 1.15 cm. Many elastic materials may be stretched by much more than 25 percent of their relaxed length, and many of these will recover to substantially their original relaxed length upon release of the elongating force.<br>
The term "pseudo-block copolymer" refers to a copolymer comprising two or more blocks or segments of differing chemical or physical properties, such as variable comonomer content,<br><br>
crystallinity, density, tacticity, regio-error, or other property. Non-adjacent blocks are not necessarily of identical chemical composition, but may vary in one or more of the foregoing respects, from the composition of all other blocks or regions. Compared to random copolymers, pseudo-block copolymers possess sufficient differences in chemical properties, especially crystallinity, between blocks or segments, and sufficient block lengths to achieve one or more of the desired propertes of true block copolymers, such as thermoplastic/ elastomeric properties, while at the same time being amenable to preparation in conventional olefin polymerization processes, especially continuous solution polymerization processes employing catalytic quantities of polymerization catalysts. The polymers and blocks thereof fit a broader distribution than conventional block copolymers, which in theory have molecular weight distributions of 1.0, Pseudo-block copolymers possess broader molecular weight distributions. In addition, the respective blocks of a pseudo-block copolymer desirably possess a PDI fitting a Schulz-Flory distribution rather than a Poisson distribution.<br>
It may be readily appreciated by the skilled artisan that in one embodiment of the present invented process the MSA may be added once, more than once (intermittently) or added continuously to each polymerization reactor or zone employed in the polymerization. Highly desirably, the MSA is added to the reaction mixture prior to initiation of polymerization, at the same time as polymerization is initiated, or at least during a significant portion of the time in which polymerization is conducted, especially in the first reactor if multiple reactors are utilized. Thorough mixing of MSA and reaction mixture may be occasioned by active or static mixing devices or by use of any stirring or pumping device employed in mixing or transferring the reaction mixture.	<br>
As used herein with respect to a chemical compound, unless specifically indicated otherwise, the singular includes all isomeric forms and vice versa (for example, "hexane", includes all isomers of hexane individually or collectively). The terms "compound" and "complex" are used interchangeably herein to refer to organic-, inorganic- and organometal compounds. The term, "atom" refers to the smallest constituent of an element regardless of ionic state, that is, whether or not the same bears a charge or partial charge or is bonded to another atom. The term "heteroatom" refers to an atom other than carbon or hydrogen. Preferred heteroatoms include: F, CI, Br, "N, O, P, B, S, Si, Sb, Al, Sn, As, Se and Ge.<br>
The term, "hydrocarbyl" refers to univalent substituents containing only hydrogen and carbon atoms, mcluding branched or unbranched, saturated ox unsaturated, cyclic or noncyclic species. Examples include alkyl-, cycloalkyl-, alkenyl-, alkadienyl-, cycloalkeny]-, cycloalkadienyl-5 aryl-, and alkynyl- groups.

"heteroatom containing hydrocarbyr' or "heterohydrocarbyl" refer to univalent groups in which at least one atom other than hydrogen or carbon is present along with one or more carbon atom and one or more hydrogen atoms. The term "heterocarbyl" refers to groups containing one or more carbon atoms and one or more heteroatoms and no hydrogen atoms. The bond between the carbon atom and any heteroatom as well as the bonds between any two heteroatoms, may be saturated or unsaturated. Thus, an alkyl group substituted with a heterocycloalkyl-, substituted heterocycloalkyl-, heteroaryl-, substituted heteroaryl-, alkoxy-, aryloxy-, dibydrocarbylboryl-, dihydrocarbylphosphino-, dihydrocarbylamino-, trihydrocarbylsilyl". hydrocarbylthio-, or hydrocarbylseleno- group is within the scope of the term heteroalkyl, Examples of suitable hetexoalkyl groups include cyano-, benzoyl-, (2-pyridyl)methyl-', and trifluoromethyl- groups.<br>
As used herein the term "aromatic" refers to a polyatomic, cyclic, conjugated ring system containing (45+2) it-electrons, wherein 6 is an integer greater than or equal to I. The term "'fused" as used herein with respect to a ring system containing two or more polyatomic, cyclic rings means that with respect to at least two rings thereof at least one pair of adjacent atoms is included in both rings. The term "aryl" refers to a monovalent aromatic substituent which may be a single aromatic ring or multiple aromatic rings which are fused together, linked covalently, or linked to a common group such as a methylene or ethylene moiety. The aromatic ring(s) may include phenyl, naphthyl, anthracenyl, and biphenyl, among others.<br>

The common linking group may also be a carbonyl as in benzophenone or oxygen as in diphenylether or nitrogen in diphenylamine.<br>
The term, "comonomer incorporation index", refers to the percent comonomer incorporated into a copolymer prepared by the catalyst under consideration. The selection of metal complexes or catalyst compositions having the greatest difference in comonomer incorporation indices under different polymerization conditions, in one embodiment of the present invention, results b copolymers from two or more monomers having the largest difference in block or segment properties, such as density, for the same comonomer composition distribution. Comonomer incorporation index is generally determined by the use of NMR spectroscopic techniques. It may also be estimated based on monomer reactivities and reactor kinetics according to known theoretical techniques.<br><br>
In a polymer containing distinguishable segments each segment may be the same or chemically different or generally characterized fay a distribution of properties. The latter result may be achieved if the polymer chain experiences different polymerization conditions in differing reactors or polymerization zones during formation. Different polymerization conditions in the respective reactors or zones include the use of different monomers, different comonomers, or different monomer/comonomer(s) ratios, different polymerization temperatures, pressures or partial pressures of various monomers, different catalysts, simultaneous use of mono-centered chain shuttling agents, differing monomer gradients, or any other difference leading to formation of a distinguishable polymer segment. In this manner, at least a portion of the polymer resulting from the present process may comprise two, three, or more, preferably two or three, differentiated polymer segment types arranged intramolecularly.<br>
According to the present invention, by selecting highly active catalyst compositions capable of rapid transfer of polymer segments both to and from, a suitable multi-centered shuttling agent, a polymer product having at least two different molecular weight fractions is formed. Due to the use of at least one multi-centered shuttling agent and catalysts capable of rapid and efficient exchange of growing polymer chains, the polymer experiences discontinuous polymer growth and transfer to a remnant of the multi-centered shuttling agent, thereby forming at least some polymer having approximately double, triple or other multiple of the molecular weight of a remaining component of the polymer blend, and optionally, chemically distinct polymer segments.<br>
By the term, "approximately" as used with respect to the comparison of modes in a multi¬modal molecular weight distribution of a polymer blend herein, is meant that the mean molecular weight of the higher molecular weight component of the multi-modal blend is within 15 percent, preferably within 10 percent of an integer multiple of the lower molecular weight component, said integer being 2 or higher.<br>

Preferred monomers or mixtures of monomers for use m combination with at least one MSA herein include ethylene; propylene; mixtures of ethylene with one or more monomers selected from the group consisting of propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyH-pentene, i-octene, and styrene; and mixtures of ethylene, propylene and a conjugated or non-conjugated diene.<br>
Chain Shuttling Agents<br>
The term, "shuttling agent" or "chain shuttling agent"', refers to a compound or mixture of compounds that is capable of causing polymeryl transfer between the various active catalyst sites under the conditions of the polymerization. That is, transfer of a polymer fragment occurs both to and from an active catalyst site in a facile manner. In contrast to a shuttling agent, a "chain transfer agent" causes termination of polymer chain growth and amounts to a one-time transfer of growing polymer from the catalyst to the transfer agent. Desirably, the intermediate formed between the chain shuttling agent and the polymeryl chain is sufficiently stable that chain termination is relatively rare.<br>
The term, "multi-centered shuttling agent" refers to a compound or molecule containing more than one, preferably 2 or 3, chain shuttling moieties joined by a polyvalent linking group. In practice, suitable chain shuttling moieties preferably include metal centers derived from a metal selected from Groups 2-14 of the Periodic Table of the Elements and having one or more available valencies able to reversibly bind to a growing polymer chain prepared by a coordination polymerization catalyst. At the same time that the chain shuttling moiety binds to the growing polymer chain, the remnant of the polyvalent linking group remaining after loss of the chain shuttling moiety or moieties incorporates or otherwise bonds to one or more active catalyst sites.<br><br>
thereby forming a catalyst composition containing an active coordination polymerization site capable of polymer insertion at at least one terminus of what was originally the polyvalent linking group. Desirably, at least 0.5 percent, preferably at least 1 percent, more preferably at least 2 percent and most preferably at least 3 percent and up to 9? percent, preferably up to 98 percent, and more preferably up to 95 percent of the total polymer comprises a higher molecular weight polymer component Particularly desirable compositions are blends of two polymers prepared according to the invention in which 25, 50 or 75 percent of the total. blend is the higher molecular weight component.<br>
While attached to the growing polymer chain, the shuttling agent desirably does not alter the polymer structure or incorporate additional monomer. That is, the shuttling agent does not also possess significant catalytic properties for polymeri2ation. Rather, the shuttling agent forms a metal-alkyl or other type interaction with the polymer moiety until transfer of the polymer moiety to an active polymerization catalyst site again occurs. Transfer of the same sliuttling agent site back to the original catalyst merely results in an increase in polymer molecular weight. Transfer to a different catalyst (if more than one catalyst type is employed) results in formation of a distinguishable polymer types due for example, to a difference in monomer incorporation properties, tacticity, or other property of the subsequent catalyst. Transfer by means of one of the remaining shuttling sites results in step growth from a different point in the polymer molecule. With a two-centered shuttling agent, at least some of the resulting polymer is approximately double the molecular weight of remaining polymer segments. Under certain circumstances, the subsequently formed polymer region also possesses a distinguishable physical or chemical property, such, as a different monomer or comonomer identity, a difference m comonomer composition distribution, crystallinity, density, tacticity, regio-error, or other property, compared to the polymer formed at other times during the polymerization. Subsequent repetitions of the foregoing process can result in formation of segments or blocks having a multiplicity of differing properties, or a repetition of a previously formed polymer composition, depending on the rates of polymeryl exchange, number of reactors or zones within a reactor, transport between the reactors or zones, number of different catalysts, monomer gradient in the reactor(s), and so forth. The polymers of the invention may be characterized by either a narrow or a broad molecular weight distribution. Polymers having a narrow molecular weight distribution typically have a PDI (Mw/Mn) from 2.0 to 2.8. Polymers having a broad PDI are those with PDI from 2.8 to 20, more preferably from 3.0 to 10.<br>
The process of the invention employing a two-centered chain shuttling agent and single catalyst may be further elucidated by reference to Figure 1, where there is illustrated an activated catalyst, 10, and a multi-centered shuttling agent, 14, containing two separate chain shuttling sites, M. Under chain growth polymerization conditions the activated catalyst forms a polymer chain, 12.<br><br>
In step 1, the shuttling agent exchanges one chain shuttling moiety with a catalyst/polymer combination, thereby binding the polymer chain, 12, to a chain shuttling moiety, M. Simultaneously, the remnant of the chain shuttling agent, 14, resulting from loss of a moiety, M, attaches to an active catalyst site, forming a new species, II, capable of continued polymerization. In step 2, new polymer segment, i2a is produced by the catalyst site, thereby forming a polymer segment joined to chain shuttling remnant, 14. No chain growth occurs at the other species of the reaction, the polymer chain, 12 terminated with chain shuttling agent remnant, M. In step 3, chain transfer followed by polymerization occurs thereby forming a new polymer segment, 12b, attached to original polymer segment 12, and regeneration of a two centered chain shuttling MSA including polymer extension 12a attached to moiety 14 and two M moieties. In step 4, a final transfer of this two centered chain shuttling MSA via the second shuttling center results in formation of active catalyst attached to the combined MSA moiety, 14 and polymer segment 12a and separate polymer segment 12 joined to polymer segment 12b. Although depicted as separate polymer regions, it is to be understood that the two polymers 12 and 12b formed under nearly identical polymerization conditions by the same catalyst species are substantially identical, and under homogeneous polymerization conditions, the combination of polymer 12 and 12b is essentially indistinguishable from polymer 12 itself, In step 5, new polymer segment, 12c is formed at the active catalyst site attached to MSA remnant 14. Termination in step 6 results in formation of two polymer products, 18 and 19, which are distinguishable based on molecular weight as well as the presence of the residue of the two-centered chain shuttling agent, 14, m polymer product 18,<br>
Transfer of the growing polymer may occur multiple times with continued growth of the polymer segment each time it is attached to an active catalyst. Under uniform polymerization conditions, the growing polymer blocks are substantially homogeneous, though their size conforms to a distribution of sizes, desirably a most probable distribution. If differing polymerization conditions such as the presence of different monomers or monomer gradients in a reactory, multiple reactors operating under differing process conditions, and so forth, the respective polymer segments may also be distinguished based on differences in chemical or physical properties- Chain shuttling and further growth may continue in the foregoing manner for any number of cycles. However, the resulting product mixture contains at least two separate species distinguishable primarily based on molecular weight difference, with polymer species 18, containing the remnant of the multi-centered shuttling agent, 14, being approximately double the size of polymer product, 19. Accordingly, in this instance a product of substantially homogeneous composition and having a bimodal molecular weight distribution is formed.<br>
In Figure 2 a similar, but less prevalent process is illustrated wherein simultaneous growth at both centers of a two centered MSA takes place. In particular, an activated catalyst, 20, and a<br><br>
multi-centered shuttling agent, 24 containing two separate chain shuttling sites, M are present in a reactor operating under polymerization conditions. The catalyst forms a polymer segment 22, In step 1, the shuttling agent exchanges one of the two active sites with the catalyst/polymer combination, thereby forming a species comprising the polymer chain, 22 attached to M. Simultaneously, the remnant of the chain shuttling agent, 24-M attaches to an active catalyst site, forming a new species, 21, capable of continued polymerization. In step 2, new polymer segment, 22a is produced by the catalyst site, thereby forming a polymer segment joined to chain shuttling remnant, 24, In step 3, chain transfer and growth involving the remaining site of the two centered MSA occurs while still attached to the original catalyst, thereby forming a polymer species, 26 having two active catalyst sites separated by polymer segment 22a and shuttling agent remnant, 24. In step 4, continued polymerization from both active sites forms a polymeric species, 27 containing two regions of polymer growth, 22a and 22b joined by the remnant of tie two-centered shuttling agent, 24 with active catalyst sites on each end. Termination of chain growth in step 5 results in formation of two polymer products, 28 and 29, which are distinguishable based on molecular weight as well as the presence of the residue of the two-centered chain shuttling agent, 24, in polymer product 28.<br>
The process of the invention employing a two-centered chain shuttling agent and two different catalysts, C and C" is illustrated in Figure 3, where a first activated catalyst, C, forms a polymer chain, 32. The second activated catalyst, C", also forms a polymer segment which is not depicted. In step 1, the shuttling agent exchanges one chain shuttling moiety with a catalyst/polymer combination, thereby binding the polymer chain, 32, to a chain shuttling moiety, M. Simultaneously, the remnant of the chain shuttling agent, 34 resulting from loss of a moiety, M, attaches to an active catalyst site, forming a new species' 31, capable of continued polymerization. In step 2, new polymer segment, 32a is produced by the catalyst site, thereby forming a polymer segment joined to the remnant of multi-centered shuttling remnant, 34. No chain growth occurs at the shuttling agent terminated polymer chain, 32. In step 3, chain transfer occurs involving the second catalyst, C", followed by polymerization to form a polymeric species, 35, comprising polymer segment, 36 attached to originally formed polymer chain 32, Polymer segment, 36 has different polymer properties such as comonomer incorporation or tacticity from polymer segment 32 or 32a. In step 4, chain transfer occurs once again, involving both catalyst C and C". Continued polymerization from both catalyst sites in step 5 forms new polymer segments, 32b and 36a, also having different polymer properties such as comonomer incorporation or acticity. These polymer segments are each joined fay the remnant of the two-centered shuttling agent, 34 to polymer segment 32a. Termination in step 6 results m formation of three polymer products, 38 and 39, and 40, which are distinguishable based on molecular weight as well as the presence of the residue of<br><br>
the two-centered chain shuttling agent, 34, in polymer products 38 and 40. In addition, products 38 and 39 are pseudo-block copolymers due to the presence of differing polymer regions formed by the respective catalysts C' and C". Additional polymer formed solely from catalyst C or C" (not illustrated) may be present in the product mixture as well.<br>
In figure 4, a variation of the foregoing process employing two catalysts C and C in the polymerization of ethylene, 1 and a C3-20 α-olefin (T - C1-18 hydrocarbyl), 2 in the presence of a dicentered shuttling agent, 3, having a divalent linking group, L, joining two chain shuttling moieties, M1 and M2' is illustrated. The shuttling moieties, M1 and M2 have differing affinities with respect to the catalysts, C and C' In particular, M' is more inclined to engage in polymer transfer with catalyst C whereas M” has a higher reactivity (increased shuttling index) with catalyst C'  In the various chain shuttling steps 1) and 3) shuttling between M1 and catalyst C as well as between M2 and catalyst C are illustrated. The skilled artisan will appreciate that the various steps illustrated may occur in any order. By also selecting the catalysts C and C with respect to their ability or inability to incorporate comonomer (or otherwise produce distinguishable polymers), the polymer segments formed by the respective catalysts. 4 and 5, will possess distinct physical properties and the resulting product will be a diblock copolymer. In particular, a diblock copolymer having one block of a highly crystalline ethylene or propylene polymer (little or no comonomer incorporation) and the other of an amorphous ethylene or propylene copolymer (greater quantity of comonomer incorporation) may be readily prepared in this manner.<br>
The skilled artisan will appreciate that by employing multiple catalysts, multiple monomers, multiple shuttling agents (including both CSA and MSA types) and/or multiple reactors or variable reactor conditions, multitudinous combinations of reaction products are attainable.<br>
The polymer product may be recovered by termination, such as by reaction with water or other proton source, or functionalized, if desired, forming vinyl, hydroxyl, silane, carboxylic acid, carboxylio acid ester, ionomeric, or other functional terminal groups, especially to replace the chain shuttling agent. Alternatively, the polymer segments may be coupled with a polyfunctional coupling agent, especially a difunctional coupling agent such as tolylene diisocyanate, dichlorodimethylsilane or ethylenedichloride, and recovered.<br>
Application of the foregoing techniques to the preparation of low molecular weight α ω -terminally functionalized polymers, especially  α ω -diols. orα ω -dienes, is disclosed in the following schematic illustration:<br><br><br>
where an α ω -two centered MSA, (PrM'LMPr) containing two metal sites, M', such a Zn, joined by a divalent ligand group, L (such as a hydrocarbylene group) and substituted with protecting groups Pr, such as trimethylsilyl groups, which optionally may be joined together as indicated by dotted lines, is added to an ethylene polymerization process. A metal di-terminated polymer is formed in the reaction which may be converted by known techniques (such as oxidation or displacement) to the corresponding dihydroxyl- or divinyl- functionalized polymer products using conventional processes. Suitable techniques for conversion of metallated polymers via displacement reactions are disclosed in J. Am, Chem. Soc, 126,10701-10712 (2004), J. Am. Chem, Soc. 127,10166-10167 (2005), and references cited therein.<br>
The skilled artisan will readily appreciate that the foregoing process may employ a multi--centered shuttling agent initially containing 2,3, 4 or even more active centers, resulting in the formation of polymer mixtures containing some quantity of a polymer that has approximately double, triple, quadruple, or other multiple of the molecular weight of the remaining polymer and a star or branched morphology.<br>
Ideally, the rate of chain shuttling is equivalent to or faster than the rate of polymer termination, even up to 10 or even 100 times faster than the rate of polymer termination and significant with respect to the rate of polymerization. This permits formation of significant quantities of polymer chains terminated with chain shuttling agents and capable of continued monomer insertion leading to significant quantities of the higher molecular weight polymer.<br>
By selecting different shuttling agents or mixtures of agents with a catalyst, by altering the comonomer composition, temperature, pressure, optional chain terminating agent such as H2, or other reaction conditions in separate reactors or zones of a reactor operating under plug flow conditions, polymer products having segments of varying density or comonomer concentration, monomer content, and/or other distinguishing property can be prepared, as well. For example, in a typical process employing two continuous solution polymerization reactors cormected in series and operating under differing polymerization conditions, the resulting polymer segments will each have a relatively broad molecular weight distribution characteristic of typical olefin coordination    polymerization catalysts, preferably a Mw/Mn from 1.2 to 10, more preferably from 1.5 to 5.0, but will reflect differing polymerization conditions of their formation. In addition, certain quantities of<br><br>
a conventional random copolymer may also be formed coincident with formation of the present polymer composition, resulting in a resin blend. If a relatively fast shuttling agent is employed, a copolymer having shorter block lengths but more uniform composition is obtained, with little formation of random copolymer. By proper selection of both catalyst and multi-centered shuttling agent, relatively pure mixtures of two polymers differing in molecular weight by approximately an integer value, copolymers containing relatively large polymer segments or blocks approximating true block copolymers, or blends of the foregoing with more random copolymers can all be obtained.<br>
Highly desired polymer compositions according to the present invention comprise a polyolefin, especially a copolymer of ethylene and a C3-8 comonomer alone or in admixture with a homopoiymer of ethylene or a homopolymer of propylene, said composition having a distinct bimodal molecular weight distribution, the higher molecular weight component having a Mw approximately double or triple that of the lower molecular weigh component.<br>

Preferred chain shuttling agents possess the highest transfer rates of polymer transfer as well as the highest transfer efficiencies (reduced incidences of chain termination). Such shuttling agents may be used in reduced concentrations and still achieve the desired degree of shuttling. Highly desirably, chain shuttling agents with a single exchange site are employed due to the fact that the effective molecular weight of the polymer in the reactor is lowered, thereby reducing viscosity of the reaction mixture and consequently reducing operating costs.<br>

Catalysts having high comonomer incorporation properties are also known to reincorporate in situ prepared long chain olefins resulting incidentally during the polymerization through β-hydride elimination and chain termination of growing polymer, or other process. The concentration of such long chain olefins is particularly enhanced by use of continuous solution polymerization conditions at high conversions, especially ethylene conversions of 95 percent or greater, more preferably at ethylene conversions of 97 percent or greater. Under such conditions a small but detectable quantity of vinyl group terminated polymer may be reincorporated into a growing polymer chain, resulting in the formation of long chain branches, that is, branches of a carbon length greater than would result from other deliberately added comonomer, Moreover, such chains reflect the presence of other comonomers present in the reaction mixture. That is, the chains may include short chain or long chain branching as well, depending on the comonomer composition of the reaction mixture. However, the presence of an MSA or CSA during polymerization can seriously limit the incidence of long chain branching since the vast majority of the polymer chains become attached to an MSA or CSA species and are prevented from undergoing p-hydride elimination.<br>

A noncoordinating anion specifically refers to an anion which when functioning as a charge balancing anion in a cationic metal complex does not transfer an anionic substituent or fragment thereof to said cation thereby forming neutral complexes. "Compatible anions" are anions which are not degraded to neutrality when the initially formed complex decomposes and are noninterfering with desired subsequent polymerization or other uses of the complex.<br>
Preferred anions are those containing a single coordination complex comprismg a charge-bearing metal or metalloid core which anion is capable of balancing the charge of the active catalyst species (the metal cation) which may be formed when the two components are combined. Also, said anion should be sufficiently labile to be displaced by olefinic, diolefinic and acetylenically unsaturated compounds or other neutral Lewis bases such as ethers or nitriles. Suitable metals include, but are not limited to, aluminum, gold and platinum. Suitable metalloids include, but are not limited to, boron, phosphorus, and silicon. Compounds containing anions which comprise coordination complexes containing a single metal or metalloid atom are, of course, well known and many, particularly such compounds containing a single boron atom in the anion portion, are available commercially.<br>

tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane modified alumoxanes. Such cocatalysts are previously disclosed in US Patents 6,214,760, 6,160,146, 6,140,521, and 6,696,379.<br>
A class of cocatalysts comprising non-coordinating anions generically referred to as expanded anions, further disclosed in US Patent 6,395,671, may be suitably employed to activate the metal complexes of the present invention for olefin polymerization. Generally, these cocatalysts (illustrated by those having imidazolide, substituted imidazolide, imidazolinide, substituted imidazolinide, benzimidazolide, or substituted benzimidazolide anions) may be depicted as follows:<br><br><br>

Examples of these catalyst activators include trihydrocarbylammonium" salts, especially, methyldi(C14-20 alkyI)ammonium- salts of:<br><br><br><br><br>
Other activators include those described in PCX publication WO 98/07515 such as tris (2, 2', 2'-nonafluorobipheayl)fluoroaluminate. Combinations of activators are also contemplated by the invention, for example, alumoxanes and ionizing activators in combinations, see for example, EP^A-0 573120, PCT publications WO 94/07928 and WO 95/14044 and US Patents 5,153,157 and 5,453,410. WO 98/09996 describes activating catalyst compounds with perchlorates, periodates and iodates, including their hydrates. WO 99/18135 describes the use of organoboroaluminum activators. WO 03/10171 discloses catalyst activators that are adducts of Bronsted acids with Lewis acids. Other activators or methods for activating a catalyst compound are described in for example, US Patents 5,849.852, 5,859, 653, 5,869,723, EP-A-61598i, and PCT publication WO 98/32775, All of the foregoing catalst activators as well as any other know activator for transition metal complex catalysts may be employed alone or in combination accordmg to the present invention, however, for best results alumoxane containing cocatalysts are avoided,<br>
The molar ratio of catalyst/cocatalyst employed preferably ranges from 1:10,000 to 100:1, more preferably from 1:5000 to 10:1, most preferably from 1:1000 to 1:1. Alumoxane, when used by itself as an activating cocatalyst, is employed in large, quantity, generally at least 100 times the quantity of metal complex on a molar basis. Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, where used as an activating cocatalyst is employed in a molar ratio to the metal complex of from 0.5:1 to 10:1, more preferably from 1:1 to 6:1 most preferably from 1:1 to 5;1 The remaining activating cocatalysts are generally employed in approximately equimolar quantity with the metal complex.<br>
During the polymerization, the reaction mixture is contacted with the activated catalyst composition according to any suitable polymerization conditions. The process is desirably characterized by use of elevated temperatures and pressures. Hydrogen may be employed as a chain transfer agent for molecular weight control accordmg to known techniques, if desired. As in other similar polymerizations, it is highly desirable that the monomers and solvents employed be of sufficiently high purity that catalyst deactivation or premature chain termination does not occur. Any suitable technique for monomer purification such as devolatilization at reduced pressure, contacting with molecular sieves or high surface area alumina, or a combination of the foregoing processes may be employed.<br><br>
Supports may be employed in the present invention, especially in slurry or gas-phase polymerizations. Suitable supports include solid, particuiated, high surface area, metal oxides, metalloid oxides, or mixtures thereof (interchangeably referred to herein as an inorganic oxide). Examples include; talc, silica, alumina, magnesia, titania, zirconia, Sn2O3,s aluminosilicates, borosiiicates, clays, and mixtures thereof. Suitable supports preferably have a surface area as determined by nitrogen porosimetry using the B.E.T. method from 10 to 1000 m2/g, and preferably from 100 to 600 m2/g. The average particle size typically is from 0.1 to 500µm, preferably from 1 to 200 µm, more preferably 10 to 100µm.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the present catalyst composition and optional support may be spray dried or otherwise recovered in solid,  particuiated form to provide a composition that is readily transported and handled. Suitable methods for spray drying a liquid containing slurry are well known in the art and usefully employed herein. Preferred techniques for spray drying catalyst compositions for use herein are described in US-A's-5,648,310 and 5,672,669.<br>
The polymerization is desirably carried out as a continuous polymerization, preferably a continuous, solution polymerization, in which catalyst components, monomers, and optionally solvent, adjuvants, scavengers, and polymerization aids are continuously supplied to one or more reactors or zones and polymer product continuously removed there from. Within the scope of the terms "continuous" and "continuously" as used in thiscontext are those processes in which there are intermittent additions of reactants and removal of products at small regular or irregular intervals, so that, over time, the overall process is substantially continuous. While the multi-centered shuttling agent and the chain shuttling agent(s) (if used) may be added at any point during the polymerization including m the first reactor or zone, at the exit or slightly before the exit of the first reactor, between the first reactor or zone and any subsequent reactor or zone, or even solely to the second reactor or zone, if present, both are preferably added at the initial stages of the polymerization. If there exists any difference in monomers, temperatures, pressures or other polymerization condition within a reactor or between two or more reactors or zones connected in series, polymer segments of differing composition such as comonomer content, crystallinity, density, tacticity, regio-regularity, or other chemical or physical difference, within the same molecule are formed in the polymers of the invention. In such event, the size of each segment or block is determined by the polymer reaction conditions, and preferably is a most probable distribution of polymer sizes.<br>
If multiple reactors are employed, each can be mdependently operated under high pressure, solution, slurry, or gas phase polymerization conditions. In a multiple zone polymerization, all zones operate under the same type of polymerization, such as solution, slurry, or gas phase, but, optionally, at different process conditions. For a solution polymerization process, it is desirable to<br><br>
employ homogeneous dispersions of the catalyst components in a liquid diluent in which the polymer is soluble under the polymerization conditions employed. One such process utilizing an extremely fine silica or similar dispersing agent to produce such a homogeneous catalyst dispersion wherein normally either the metal complex or the cocatalyst is only poorly soluble is disclosed in US-A-5,783,512. A high pressure process is usually carried out at temperatures from 100°C to 400°C and at pressures above 500 bar (50 MPa). A slurry process typically uses an inert hydrocarbon diluent and temperatures of from 0°C up to a temperature just below the temperature at which the resulting polymer becomes substantially soluble in the inert polymerization medium. Preferred temperatures in a slurry polymerization are from 30°C, preferably from 60°C up to 115°C, preferably up to 100°C, depending on the polymer being prepared. Pressures typically range from atmospheric (100 kPa) to 500 psi (3.4 MPa).<br>
In all of the foregoing processes, continuous or substantially continuous polymerization conditions are preferably employed. The use of such polymerization conditions, especially continuous, solution polymerization processes, allows the use of elevated reactor temperatures which results in the economical production of the present block copolymers in high yields and efficiencies.<br>
The catalyst may be prepared as a homogeneous composition by addition of the requisite metal complex or multiple complexes to a solvent in which the polymerization will be conducted or in a diluent compatible with the ultimate reaction mixture. The desired cocatalyst or activator and, optionally, a shuttling agent may be combined with the catalyst composition either prior to, simultaneously with, or after combination of the catalyst with the monomers to be polymerized and any additional reaction diluent Desirably, the MSA is added at the same time.<br>
At all times, the individual ingredients as well as any active catalyst composition must be protected from oxygen, moisture and other catalyst poisons. Therefore, the catalyst components, multi-centered shuttling agent and activated catalysts must be prepared and stored in an oxygen and moisture free atmosphere, preferably under a dry, inert gas such as nitrogen.<br>
Without limiting in any way the scope of the invention, one means for carrying out such a polymerization process is as follows. In one or more well stirred tank or loop reactors operating under solution polymerization conditions,the monomers to be polymerized are introduced continuously together with any solvent or diluent at one part of the reactor. The reactor contains a relatively homogeneous liquid phase composed substantially of monomers together with any solvent or diluent and dissolved polymer. Preferred solvents include C4-10 hydrocarbons or mixtures thereof, especially alkanes such as hexane or mixtures of alkanes, as well as one or more of the monomers employed in the polymerization. Examples of suitable loop reactors and a variety of<br><br>
suitable operating conditions for use therewith, includingthe use of multiple loop reactors, operating in series, are found in USP's 5,977,25U 6,319,989 and 6,683,149.<br>
Catalyst along with cocatalyst and multi-centered shuttling agent are continuously or intermittently introduced in the reactor liquid phase or any recycled portion thereof at a minimum of one location. The reactor temperature and pressure may be controlled by adjusting the solvent/monomer ratio, the catalyst addition rate, as well as by use of cooling or heating coils, jackets or both. The polymerization rate is controlled by the rate of catalyst addition. The content of a given monomer in the polymer product is influenced by the ratio of monomers in the reactor, which is controlled by manipulating the respective feed rates of these components to the reactor. The polymer product molecular weight is controlled, optionally, by controlling other polymerization variables such as the temperature, monomer concentration, or by the previously mentioned multi-centered shuttling agent, or a chain terminating agent such as hydrogen, as is well known in the art.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a second reactor is connected to the discharge of the reactor, optionally by means of a conduit or other transfer means, such that the reaction mixture prepared in the first reactor is discharged to the second reactor without substantially termination of polymer growth. Between the first and second reactors, a differential in at least one process condition may be established. Preferably for use in formation of a copolymer of two or more monomers, the difference is the presence or absence of one or more comonomers or a difference in comonomer concentration. Additional reactors, each arranged in a manner similar to the second reactor in the series may be provided as well. Further polymerization is ended by contacting the reactor effluent with a catalyst kill agent such as water, steam or an alcohol or with a coupling agent if a coupled reaction product is desired.<br>
The resulting polymer product is recovered by flashing off volatile components of the reaction mixture such as residual monomer(s) or diluent at reduced pressure, and, if necessary, conducting further devolatilization m equipment such as a devolatilizmg extruder. In a continuous process the mean residence time of the catalyst and polymer in the reactor generally is from 5 minutes to 8 hours, and preferably from 10 minutes to 6 hours.<br>
Alternatively, the foregoing polymerization may be carried out in a plug flow reactor optionally with a monomer, catalyst, multi-centered shuttling agent, temperature or other gradient established between differing zones or regions thereof, further optionally accompanied by separate addition of catalysts and/or chain shuttling agent, and operatmg under adiabatic or non-adiabatic polymerization conditions.<br>
The catalyst composition may also be prepared and employed as a heterogeneous catalyst by adsorbing the requisite components on an inert inorganic or organic particulated solid, as previously disclosed. In a preferred embodiment a heterogeneous catalyst is prepared by co-<br><br>
precipitating the metal complex and the reaction product of an inert inorganic compound and an active hydrogen containing activator, especiallythe reaction product of a tri (C1-4 alkyl) aluminum compound and an ammonium salt of a hydroxyaryitris(pentafluorophenyl)borate, such as an ammonium salt of (4-hydroxy-3,5-ditertiarybutylphenyl)tris(pentafluorophenyI)borate. When prepared in heterogeneous or supported form, the catalyst, composition may be employed in a slurry or a gas phase polymerization. As a practical limitation, slurry polymerization takes place in liquid diluents in which the polymer product is substantially insoluble. Preferably, the diluent for slurry polymerization is one or more hydrocarbons with less than 5 carbon atoms. If desired, saturated hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane or butane may be used in whole or part as the diluent. As with a solution polymerization, the α-olefin comonomer or a mixture of different α-olefin monomers may be used in whole or part as the diluent, Most preferably at least a major part of the diluent comprises the a-olefin monomer or monomers to be polymerized.<br>
Preferably for use in gas phase polymerization processes, the support material and resulting catalyst has a median particle diameter from 20 to 200µm, more preferably from 30 µm to 150 µm, and most preferably from 50 µm to 100 µm. Preferably for use in slurry polymerization processes, the support has a median particle diameter from 1 µm to 200 µm.  more preferably from 5 µm to 100 µm, and most preferably from 10 µm to 80 µm.<br>
Suitable gas phase polymerization process for use herein are substantially similar to known processes used commercially on a large scale for the manufacture of polypropylene, ethylene/ a-olefin copolymers, and other olefin polymers.the gas phase process employed can be, for example, of the type which employs a mechanically stirred bed or a gas fluidized bed as the polymerization reaction zone. Preferred is the process wherein the polymerization reaction is carried out in a vertical cylindrical polymerization reactor containing a fluidized bed of polymer particles supported or suspended above a perforated plate or fluidization grid, by a flow of fluidization gas-<br>
The gas employed to fluidizethe bed comprises the monomer or monomers to be polymerized, and also serves as a heat exchange medium to remove the heat of reaction from the bed. The hot gases emerge from the top of the reactor, normally via a tranquilization zone, also known as a velocity reduction zone, having a wider diameter than the fluidized bed and wherein fme particles entrained in the gas stream have an opportunity to gravitate back into the bed. It can also be advantageous to use a cyclone to remove ultra-fine particles from the hot gas stream. The gas is then normally recycled to the bed by means of a blower or compressor and one or more heat exchangers to strip the gas of the heat of polymerization.<br>
A preferred method of cooling of the bed, in addition to the cooling provided by the cooled recycle gas, is to feed a volatile liquid to the bed to provide an evaporative cooling effect, often<br><br>
referred to as operation in the condensing mode. The volatile liquid employed in this case can be, for example, a volatile inert liquid, for example, a saturated hydrocarbon having 3 to 8, preferably 4 to 6, carbon atoms. In the case that the monomer or comonomer itself is a volatile liquid, or can be condensed to provide such a liquid, this can suitably be fed to the bed to provide an evaporative cooling effect. The volatile liquid evaporates in the hot fluidized bed to form gas which mixes with the fluidizing gas. If the volatile liquid is a monomer or comonomer, it will undergo some polymerization in the bed. The evaporated liquid then emerges from the reactor as part of the hot recycle gas, and enters the compression/heat exchange part of the recycle loop. The recycle gas is cooled in the heat exchanger and, if the temperature to which the gas is cooled is below the dew point, liquid will precipitate from the gas. This liquid is desirably recycled continuously to the fluidized bed. It is possible to recycle the precipitated, liquid to the bed as liquid droplets carried in the recycle gas stream. This type of process is described, for example in EP-89691; U.S. 4,543,399; WO-94/25495 and U.S. 5,352,749. A particularly preferred method of recyclmg the liquid to the bed is to separate the liquid from the recycle gas stream and to reinject this liquid directly into the bed, preferably using a method which generates fine droplets of the liquid within the bed. This type of process is described in WO-94/28032.<br>
The polymerization reaction occurring in the gas fluidized bed is catalyzed by the contmuous or semi-continuous addition of catalyst composition as previously disclosed. The catalyst composition may be subjected to a prepolymerization step, for example, by polymerizing a small quantity of olefin monomer in a liquid inert diluent, to provide a catalyst composite comprising supported catalyst particles embedded in olefin polymer particles as well<br>
The polymer is produced directly in the fluidized bed by polymerization of the monomer or mixture of monomers on the fluidized particles of catalyst composition, supported catalyst composition or prepolymerized catalyst composition within the bed, Start-up of the polymerization reaction is achieved using a bed of preformed polymer particles, which are preferably similar to the desired polymer, and conditioning the bed by drying with inert gas or nitrogen prior to introducing the catalyst composition, the monomers and any other gases which it is desired to have in the recycle gas stream, such as a diluent gas, hydrogen chain transfer agent, or an inert condensable gas when operating in gas phase condensing mode. The produced polymer is discharged continuously or semi-continuously from the fluidized bed as desired.<br>
The gas phase processes most suitable for the practice of this invention are continuous processes which provide for the continuous supply of reactants to the reaction zone of the reactor and the removal of products from the reaction zone of the reactor, thereby providing a steady-state environment on the macro scale in the reaction zone of the reactor. Products are readily recovered by exposure to reduced pressure and optionally elevated temperatures (devolatilization) according<br><br>
to known techniques. Typically, the fluidized bed of the gas phase process is operated at temperatures greater than 50°C, preferably from 60°C to 110°C, more preferably from 70°C to<br>
110°C.<br>
Suitable gas phase processes which are adaptable for use in the process of this invention are disclosed in US Patents: 4,5g8,790; 4,543,399; 5,352,749; 5,436,304; 5,405,922; 5,462,999; 5,461,123; 5,453,471; 5,032,562; 5,028,670; 5,473,028; 5,106,804; 5,556,238; 5,541,270; 5,608,019; and 5,6I6,66L<br>
As previously mentioned, functionalized derivatives of polymers are also included within the present invention. Examples include metallated polymers wherein the metal is the remnant of the catalyst or chain shuttling agent employed, as well as further derivatives thereof Because a substantial fraction of the polymeric product exiting the reactor is terminated with the multi-centered shuttling agent, further functionalization is relatively easy. The metallated polymer species can be utilized in well known chemical reactions such as those suitable for other alkyl-aluminum, alkyl-gallium, alkyl-zinc, or alkyl-Group 1 compounds to form amine-, hydroxy-, epoxy-, silane, vinylic, and other functionalized terminated polymer products. Examples of suitable reaction techniques that are adaptable for use here in are described in Negishi,  "Organometallics in Organic Synthesis", Vol. 1 and 2, (1980), and other standard texts in organometallic and organic synthesis.<br>
Polymer Products<br>
Utilizing the present process, novel polymer compositions, including pseudo-block copolymers of one or more olefin monomers having the present bimodal molecular weight distribution, are readily prepared. Preferred polymers comprise in polymerized form at least one monomer selected from the group consisting of ethylene, propylene and 4-methyl-l-pentene. Highly desirably, the polymers are interpolymers comprising in polymerized form ethylene, propylene or 4-methyl-21-pentene and at least one different C2-20 α-olefin comonomer, and optionally one or more additional copolymerizable comonomers. Suitable comonomers are selected from diolefms, cyclic olefins, and cyclic diolefins, halogenated vinyl compounds, and vinylidene aromatic compounds. Preferred polymers are interpolymers of ethylene with 1-butene, l-hexene or 1-octene. Desirably, the polymer compositions of the invention have an ethylene content from 1 to 99 percent, a diene content from 0 to 10 percent, and a styrene and/or C2-8 α-olefin content from 99 to I percent, based on the total weight of the polymer. Further preferably, the polymers of the invention have a weight average molecular weight (Mw) from 10,000 to 2,500,000.<br>
The polymers of the invention can have a melt index, I2, from 0.01 to 2000 g/10 minutes, preferably from 0.01 to 1000 g/10 mmutes, more preferably from 0,01 to 500 g/10 minutes, and<br><br>
especially from 0.01 to 100 g/10 minutes. Desirably,the invented polymers can have molecular weights, Mw, from 1,000 g/mole to 5,000,000 g, mo!e, preferably from 1000 g/mole to 1,000,000, more preferably from 1000 g/mole to 500,000 g/mole, and especially from 1,000 g/mole to 300,000 g/'mole. The density of the invented polymers can be from 0.80 to 0.99 g/cm3 and preferably, for ethylene containing polymers, from 0.85 g/cm3 to 0.97 g/cm3.<br>
The polymers of the invention may be differentiated from conventional, random copolymers, physical blends of polymers, and block copolymers prepared via sequential monomer addition, fluxional catalysts, or by anionic or cationic living polymerization techniques, due to the previously mentioned unique molecular weight distribution. If present, the separate regions or blocks within each polymer are relatively uniform, dependmg on the uniformity of reactor conditions, and chemically distinct from each other- That is, the comonomer distribution, tacticity, or other property of segments within the polymer are relatively uniform within the same block or segment. However, the average block length is not a narrow distribution, but desirably is a most probable distribution. Such polymer products having two or more blocks or segments and a broader size distribution than a conventional block copolymer prepared by anionic techniques, are referred to herein as pseudo-block copolymers. The polymers have properties approximating in many respects, those of pure block copolymers, and in some aspects exceeding the properties of pure block copolymers.<br>

The blends may be prepared by mixing or kneading the respective components at a temperature around or above the melt point temperature of one or both of the components. For most of the present compositions,  this temperature may be above 130° C, 145° C., or even above 150° C, Typical polymer mixing or kneading equipment that is capable of reachingthe desired temperatures and melt plastifying the mixture may be employed. These include mills, kneaders, extruders (both single screw and twin-screw), Banbury mixers, and calenders.

DMA<br>
Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) is measured on compression molded disks formed in a hot press at 180°C at 10 MPa pressure for 5 minutes and then water cooled in the press at 90°C / min. Testing is conducted using an ARES controlled strain rheometer (TA instruments) equipped with dual cantilever fixtures for torsion testing.<br>
A 1.5mm plaque is pressed and cut in a bar of dimensions 32xl2mm. The sample is clamped at both ends between fixtures separated by 10mm (grip separation AL) and subjected to successive temperature steps from -100°C to 200°C (5°C per step). At each temperature the torsion modulus G' is measured at an angular frequency of 10 rad/s, the strain amplitude being maintained between 0,1 percent and 4 percent to ensure that the torque is sufficient and that the measurement remains in the linear regime.<br>
An initial static force of 10 g is maintained (auto-tension mode) to prevent slack in the sample when thermal expansion occurs. As a consequence, the grip separation AL increases with the temperature, particularly above the melting or softening point of the polymer sample. The test stops at the maximum temperature or when the gap between the fixtures reaches 65 mm. Pellet Blocking Behavior<br>
Pellets (150 g) are loaded into a 2 inch (5 cm).diameter hollow cylinder that is made of two halves held together by a hose clamp. A 2,75 lb (1,25 -kg) load is applied to the pellets m the cylinder at 45°C for 3 days. After 3 days, the pellets loosely consolidate into a cylindrical shaped plug.
