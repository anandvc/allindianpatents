MULTI-SPEED TRANSMISSION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/868,423, filed on December 4, 2006. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>

[0004] A typical multiple speed transmission uses a combination of<br>
friction clutches, planetary gear arrangements and fixed interconnections to<br>
achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and physical arrangement of the<br>
planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by packaging, cost and desired speed<br>
ratios.<br>
1<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000059-PTT-DLT _US-NP<br>
[0005] While current transmissions achieve their intended purpose, the<br>
need for new and improved transmission configurations which exhibit improved<br>
performance, especially from the standpoints of efficiency, responsiveness and<br>
smoothness and improved packaging, primarily reduced size and weight, is<br>
essentially constant. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved, cost-effective,<br>
compact multiple speed transmission.<br>

transmission according to the present invention;<br>
[0019] FIG. 2 is a diagrammatic view of an embodiment of an eight<br>
speed transmission according to the present invention; and<br>
[0020] FIG. 3 is a truth table presenting the state of engagement of the<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0021] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0022] At the outset, it should be appreciated that the embodiment of<br>
the eight speed automatic transmission of the present invention has an<br>
arrangement of permanent mechanical connections between the elements of the<br>
three planetary gear sets. More specifically, a first component or element of a<br>
first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a first component or element of<br>
a second planetary gear set and a second component or element of the first<br>
planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a second component or element of<br>
the second planetary gear set.<br>
[0023] Referring now to FIG. 1, an embodiment of an eight speed<br>
transmission 10 is illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram is a<br>
schematic representation of the components of a mechanical device such as an<br>
automatic transmission. Each individual lever represents a planetary gear set<br>
5<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000059-PTT-DLT_US-NP<br>
wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary gear are each<br>
represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes: one for<br>
the sun gear, one for the planet gear carrier, and one for the ring gear. The<br>
relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to represent the<br>
ring-to-sun ratio of each respective gear set. These lever ratios, in turn, are used<br>
to vary the gear ratios of the transmission in order to achieve an appropriate ratio<br>
and ratio progression. Mechanical couplings or interconnections between the<br>
nodes of the various planetary gear sets are illustrated by thin, horizontal lines<br>
and torque transmitting devices such as clutches and brakes are presented as<br>
interleaved fingers. If the device is a brake, one set of the fingers is grounded.<br>
Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams can be<br>
found in SAE Paper 810102, "The Lever Analogy: A New Tool in Transmission<br>
Analysis" by Benford and Leising which is hereby fully incorporated by reference.<br>
[0024] The transmission 10 includes an input shaft or member 12, an<br>
output shaft or member 14, a first planetary gear set 16 having three nodes: a<br>
first node 22, a second node 24 and a third node 28, a second planetary gear set<br>
18 having three nodes: a first node 42, a second node 44 and a third node 46,<br>
and a third planetary gear set 20 having three nodes: a first node 52, a second<br>
node 54 and a third node 56.<br>
[0025] The input member 12 is coupled to the second node 54 of the<br>
third planetary gear set 20. The output member 14 is coupled to the second<br>
node 44 of the second planetary gear set 18. The first node 22 of the first<br>
planetary gear set 16 is coupled to the first node 42 of the second planetary gear<br>
6<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000059-PTT-DLT_ US-NP<br>
set 18. The third node 28 of the first planetary gear set 16 is coupled to the third<br>
node 46 of the second planetary gear set 18.<br>
[0026] A first clutch 62 selectively connects the second node 54 of the<br>
third planetary gear set 20 to the third node 46 of the second planetary gear set<br>
18 and the third node 28 of the first planetary gear set 16. A second clutch 64<br>
selectively connects the third node 56 of the third planetary gear set 20 to the<br>
second node 24 of the first planetary gear set 16. A third clutch 66 selectively<br>
connects the third node 56 of the third planetary gear set 20 to the first node 22<br>
of the first planetary gear set 16. A fourth clutch 68 selectively connects the first<br>
node 52 of the third planetary gear set 20 to the first node 22 of the first planetary<br>
gear set 16. A first brake 70 selectively connects the first node 52 of the third<br>
planetary gear set 20 to the ground or a transmission housing 80. A second<br>
brake 72 selectively connects the third node 46 of the second planetary gear set<br>
18 to the ground or the transmission housing 80.<br>
[0027] Referring now to FIG. 2, a stick diagram presents a schematic<br>
layout of the embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 according to the<br>
present invention. In FIG. 2, the numbering from the lever diagram of FIG. 1 is<br>
carried over. The clutches, brakes and couplings are correspondingly presented<br>
whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now appear as components of<br>
planetary gear sets such as sun gears, ring gears, planet gears and planet gear<br>
carriers.<br>
[0028] For example, the first planetary gear set 16 includes a sun gear<br>
member 22, a ring gear member 24 and a carrier member 28 that rotatably<br>
7<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000059-PTT-DLT_ US-NP<br>
supports a set of pinion gears 32. The pinion gears 32 are configured to<br>
intermesh with the sun gear member 22 and the ring gear member 24. The sun<br>
gear member 22 is connected for common rotation with a first interconnecting<br>
shaft or member 34 and a second interconnecting shaft or member 35. The ring<br>
gear member 24 is connected for common rotation with a third interconnecting<br>
shaft or member 36. The carrier member 28 is connected for common rotation<br>
with a fourth interconnecting shaft or member 37.<br>
[0029] The second planetary gear set 18 includes a sun gear member<br>
42, a ring gear member 44 and a carrier member 46 that rotatably supports a set<br>
of pinion gears 48. The pinion gears 48 are configured to intermesh with both the<br>
sun gear member 42 and the ring gear member 44. The sun gear member 42 is<br>
connected for common rotation with the first interconnecting member 34. The<br>
ring gear member 44 is connected for common rotation with the output member<br>
14. The carrier member 46 is connected for common rotation with the fourth<br>
interconnecting member 37 and a fifth interconnecting shaft or member 38.<br>
[0030] The third planetary gear set 20 includes a sun gear member 52,<br>
a ring gear member 54 and a carrier member 56 that rotatably supports a set of<br>
pinion gears 58. The pinion gears 58 are configured to intermesh with both the<br>
sun gear member 52 and the ring gear member 54. The sun gear member 52 is<br>
connected for common rotation with a sixth interconnecting shaft or member 40.<br>
The ring gear member 54 is connected for common rotation with the input<br>
member 12 and a seventh interconnecting shaft or member 60. The carrier<br>
8<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000059-PTT-DLT_ US-NP<br>
member 56 is connected for common rotation with an eighth interconnecting<br>
shaft or member 61.<br>
[0031] The input member 12 is continuously connected to an engine<br>
(not shown) or to a turbine of a torque converter (not shown). The output<br>
member 14 is continuously connected with a final drive unit or transfer case (not<br>
shown).<br>
[0032] The torque-transmitting mechanisms or clutches 62, 64, 66, 68<br>
and the brakes 70, 72 allow for selective interconnection of the shafts or<br>
interconnecting members, members of the planetary gear sets and the housing.<br>
For example, the first clutch 62 is selectively engageable to connect the fourth<br>
interconnecting member 37 to the seventh interconnecting member 60. The<br>
second clutch 64 is selectively engageable to connect the third interconnecting<br>
member 36 to the. eighth interconnecting member 61. The third clutch 66 is<br>
selectively engageable to connect the second interconnecting member 35 to the<br>
eighth interconnecting member 61. The fourth clutch 68 is selectively<br>
engageable to connect the sixth interconnecting member 40 to the second<br>
interconnecting member 35. The first brake 70 is selectively engageable to<br>
connect the sixth interconnecting member 40 to the ground or transmission<br>
housing 80 to restrict rotation of the sixth interconnecting member 40 relative to<br>
the housing 80. The second brake 72 is selectively engageable to connect the<br>
fifth interconnecting member 38 to the ground or transmission housing 80 to<br>
restrict rotation of the fifth interconnecting member 38 relative to the housing 80.<br>
9<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000059-PTT-DLT_ US-NP<br>
[0033] Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 3, the operation of the<br>
embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 will be described. It will be<br>
appreciated that transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the input<br>
shaft or member 12 to the output shaft or member 14 in at least eight forward<br>
speed or torque ratios and at least two reverse speed or torque ratios. Each<br>
forward and reverse speed or torque ratio is attained by engagement of one or<br>
more of the torque-transmitting mechanisms (i.e. first clutch 62, second clutch<br>
64, third clutch 66, fourth clutch 68, first brake 70, and second brake 72), as will<br>
be explained below. FIG. 3 is a truth table presenting the various combinations<br>
of torque-transmitting mechanisms that are activated or engaged to achieve the<br>
various gear states. Actual numerical gear ratios of the various gear states are<br>
also presented although it should be appreciated that these numerical values are<br>
exemplary only and that they may be adjusted over significant ranges to<br>
accommodate various applications and operational criteria of the transmission<br>
10. An example of the gear ratios that may be obtained using the embodiments<br>
of the present invention are also shown in FIG. 3. Of course, other gear ratios<br>
are achievable depending on the gear diameter, gear teeth count and gear<br>
configuration selected.<br>
[0034] To establish a first reverse gear, the first brake 70, the second<br>
brake 72 and the third clutch 66 are engaged or activated. The first brake 70<br>
connects the sixth interconnecting member 40 to the ground or transmission<br>
housing 80 to restrict rotation of the sixth interconnecting member 40 relative to<br>
the housing 80. The second brake 72 connects the fifth interconnecting member<br>
10<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000059-PTT-DLT_ US-NP<br>
38 to the ground or transmission housing 80 to restrict rotation of the fifth<br>
interconnecting member 38 relative to the housing 80. The third clutch 66<br>
connects the second interconnecting member 35 to the eighth interconnecting<br>
member 61. Likewise, the eight forward ratios are achieved through different<br>
combinations of clutch and brake engagement, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
[0035] It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation<br>
and gear states of the eight speed transmission 10 assumes, first of all, that all<br>
the clutches and brakes not specifically referenced in a given gear state are<br>
inactive or disengaged and, second of all, that during gear shifts, i.e., changes of<br>
gear state, between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or brake engaged or<br>
activated in both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>
[0036] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
