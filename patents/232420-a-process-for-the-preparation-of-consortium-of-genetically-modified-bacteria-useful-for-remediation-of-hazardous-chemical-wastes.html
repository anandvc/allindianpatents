				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of consortium of genetically modified bacteria useful for remediation of hazardous chemical wastes. The invention uses a procedure for binding natural or genetically engineered bacteria to clay or clay minerals so as to enhance the activity of the organism and the engineered function, if any, for application in bioremediation of hazardous industrial wastes, particularly halogenated and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons.<br>
The composition can be used for seeding containing bioreactors for transformation of polyhalogenated compounds like chlorinated hydrocarbons, insecticides like lindane.<br>
• In "pump and treat technologies" for removal of hazardous halogenated compounds from water. Pump and treat methods conventionally involve pumping contaminated water to the surface for treatment and may include a system for injection into groundwater as part of the remediation strategy.<br>
Biotechnological processes continue to play a central role in treatment of<br>
municipal, industrial and agricultural wastes. Commercial biotechnology has<br>
inevitably advanced into areas that depend on the introduction of both natural and<br>
genetically engineered microorganisms (GEMs) into the environment (Anon, (1982).<br>
The use of genetically engineered microorganisms in the environment. In genetic<br>
Technology : A new Frontier, Office of Technology Assessment, West<br>
View Press, Boulder, CO, USA pp.117-127). GEMs	are<br>
being constructed for a variety of environmental applications including their use in agriculture as pesticides or for agronomic crop production, pollution control of toxic waste in land-fill sites, waste water treatment facilities or after accidental spillage, and in mining and the petrochemical industry for enhancing oil recovery or removal of sulphur. Presently, the release of GEMs is restricted (Freitas, J.R. D, Germida, J.J. (1991) Pseudomonas cepacia &amp; Pseudomonas putida as winter wheat Inoculants for biocontrol of Rhizoctania solani. Can. J. Microbiol. 37 : 780-784 ; Howard, J. and Fox, S. (1994) Review of current research projects and innovations in bioremediation. Genetic Engnn. News 14 (17) : 8-9). Field trials have been carried out involving genetically engineered strain of Pseudomonas syringae, the first to be approved for release into the environment (USA) Pseudomonas fluorescens carrying a lac ZY marker gene (USA), Rhizobium meliloti carrying a Tn5 marker gene (UK), and a genetically engineered Baculovirus (UK) (De Leij, F.A.A.M., Sutton, E.J., Whipps, J.M., Fenton, J.S. and Lynch, J.M. (1995) Field Release of a genetically modified Pseudomonas fluorescens on wheat : Establishment, Survival and Dissemination. Bio/Technology 13: 1488-1492; Prosser, J.I, Killham, K., Glover, LA. and Rattray, E.A.S. (1996) Luminescence- based systems for detection of bacteria in the environment. Crit. Revs. Biotechnol. 16 : 157-183; Scott Angle, J.; Levin, M. A., Gagliardi, J.V.; Mclntosh, M.S. (1995). Validation of microcosms for examining the survival of Pseudomonas aureofaciens (lacZY) in soil. Appl. Environm. Microbiol. 61 : 2835-2839). These field trials have revealed the behaviour of Pseudomonas fluorescens lac ZY strains and Pseudomonas syringae can be closely predicted by the results of<br>
experiments done in contained systems before release into environment. This engenders certain level of confidence in the ability to define in laboratory cultures and in microcosms many of ecologically important characters that will be required in a GEM that is to be deliberately released. It cannot be disputed that in the last 20 years, recombinant DMA technology has contributed additional genetic diversity to laboratory microbial populations. However, it is on record that there have been no cases reported in which an organism has become a disease problem as a result of receiving recombinant DNA.<br>
On the other hand, the resistance to the use of genetically manipulated bacteria is not universal. A few US based companies like Polybac Corporation, Sybron Corporation and others have been selling for almost a decade bacteria that they claim outperform indigenous strains found in aerated lagoons used in biological treatment of industrial wastes containing dioxins, orthochlorophenol, grease and "nonbiodegradable" detergents.<br>
The introduction of industrial chemicals into sewage treatment as well as other waste treatment facilities has caused problems because many chemicals are not degraded in traditional waste treatment facilities and escape as pollutants into the environment. Hence, bioremediation envisages the most obvious use of living OEMs and is proposed as a lucrative market. Since many contaminated sites or hazardous industrial wastes contain more than one pollutant, it is often difficult for natural microorganisms to degrade efficiently and simultaneously, a mixture of pollutants. Indigenous microorganisms when exposed to a mixture of pollutants, may produce toxic intermediates that do not<br><br>
allow an overall reduction of toxicity of biotreated sample to any great extent. Further, mixed formulations will allow only preferential proliferation of bacteria that feed on the most abundant compound leading to survival of only one or few strains with ultimately no bacteria available to degrade certain chemicals, and therefore have limited usage. The need for designing genetically competent organisms is due to the non-availability of efficient enzyme systems to break down certain compounds like poiychlorinated hydrocarbons which have half-life of order of years (Shanker, R. and Atkins, W.M. (1996) Luciferase Dependent, Cytochrome P450 catalysed dehalogenation in genetically engineered Pseudomonas. Biotechnology Progress (ACS &amp; AlChE) 12 (4): 474-479 ; Timmis, KM and Pieper, D.H. (1999) Bacteria designed for bioremediation. Trends in Biotechnology 17: 201-204 ; Trombly, J. (1995) Engineering enzymes for better bioremediation. Environm. Sci. Technol. 29:560-564A. ; Timmis, K.N., Steffan, R.J. and Unterman, R. (1994) Designing microorganisms for treatment of toxic wastes. Ann. Rev. Microbiol. 48 : 525-557; Warner, P.J. (1991) Prospects for use of genetically manipulated microorganisms in agriculture. Society for General Microbiology News (May issue) : 27-29.) Hence, genetically improved single cultures are considered more efficient than a mixer of cultures in degrading single or mixer of toxic chemicals. Therefore, genetically improved bacteria in combination with metabolically competent natural bacteria can be used to design stable composition with the desired traits.<br>
The   prerequisite   to   use   of  microorganisms   for  detoxification   of hazardous wastes is the preservation regime and shelf life of material. Hence,<br><br>
the preservation of both natural and genetically engineered microorganisms is becoming increasingly important due to their potential application in hazardous waste treatment in contained systems viz. soil slurry reactors as well as pump &amp; treat systems. Lyophilization is the method most commonly used for the preservation of natural microorganisms. Although, survival after lyohilization and long term storage for 6-10 years have been reported for many genera of natural bacteria, yeasts and fungi, the methodology has not been explored for environmentally important organisms in terms of their metabolic competence after storage. The success of bacteria introduced into soil depends on their ability to survive in sufficiently high numbers and for longer periods of time. It has been shown that the addition of bentonite clay to fresh orfreeze-dried rhizobial inoculants significantly enhanced their survival in soil attributed to the creation of protective microhabitats due to the bentonite amendment. Similar results were obtained with a Tn5 mutant Pseudomonas fluorescens strain (Heijnin, C.E., Hok-A-Hin C.H. and Van Veen J.A. (1992) Improvements to the use of bentonite clay as a protective agent, increasing survival levels of bacteria introduced into soil. Soil Biol. Biochem. 24(6); 533-538). Thus, lyophilization of bacterial cultures in combination with the use of clay minerals like bentonite confers an advantage for their application in bioremediation.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
preparation of synergistic composition useful for remediation of hazardous chemical<br>
wastes. In the present invention, a genetically engineered soil<br>
bacterium Pseudomonas having Ace No. MTCC 102 has been<br>
used	as a model organism to evaluate the  <br>
technique developed for preparation of a synergistic composition. This can be applicable to other stress tolerant soil organisms such as herein defined.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of consortium of genetically modified bacteria useful for remediation of hazardous chemical wastes particularly halogenated and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon which comprises growing stress tolerant soil microorganisms like Pseudomonas sp. Rhizobium sp., Bacillus sp., Micrococcus sp., Flavobacterium sp., Arthrobacter sp., or Rhodococcus sp. in a conventional Luria broth medium comprising Tryptone 100 g/l, Yeast extract 5 g/l, Sodium chloride 10 g/l by adjusting pH at 7.0 with Sodium Hydroxide at least for a period of 19 hours under stirring in a known manner separating the cells by centrifugation so as to obtain a pellet, resuspending the said pellet in a conventional minimal salt medium (Mg) such as herein described, having been supplemented with clay or clay minerals so as to have moisture content of 60 percent and optionally lyophilizing or freeze drying to get the consortium.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, stress tolerant soil organisms used may be such as naturally occurring organism or genetically engineered organism such as Pseudomonas putida co-expressing chromosomally encoded Vibrio harveyi luciferase and plasmid encoded cytochrome P450 cam C monooxygenase, used as model organism having Ace No.MTCC 102.<br>
The genetically engineered bacterium Pseudomonas putida co-expressing cytochrome P450 cam and luciferase has been bound to clay or clay minerals to design a stable composition to impart longer shelf life and<br>
therefore viability as a commercial package.  The preparation of composition<br>
involved the following steps :<br>
Inoculation of the bacteria in Luria broth pH 7.2 for growth at 30°C for 19-20 hours on an orbital shaker at 200 rpm.<br>
Harvesting of cells by centrifugation at 8000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C. Pellet  of  cells  was   resuspended   in   M9   medium   containing   0.1% magnesium sulfate, 0.003% sodium benzoate and 0.2% sodium citrate to which the clay-based binding matrix was added to provide moisture content of 60 percent and stored at 4°C.<br>
Alternatively, cells resuspended in M9 medium containing 0.1% magnesium sulfate were added to clay-based binding matrix and freeze dried. Lyophilization was performed at -25°C to -35°C at 0.60 to 1.032 mbar for 10-15 hours. Freeze-dried samples were stored desiccated at room temperature. The following examples are given by way of illustration of activity of the<br>
composition of the present inventon and therefore should not be construed to limit<br>
its scope:<br>
Example-1<br>
The short term survival of clay-bound cells of genetically engineered P.<br>
putida co-expressing luciferase and cytochrome P450 cam on storage at 4°C was<br>
evaluated by measuring luminescence in 0.1 g clay paste suspended in Luria broth.<br>
Luminescence was measured for 30 seconds or 1 minute in a Tri-<br><br><br><br><br>
