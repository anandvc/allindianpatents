				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a polypeptide adjuvant for use in vaccine compositions.<br>
An adjuvant is a substance or procedure which augments specific immune responses to antigens<br>
by modulating the activity of immune cells. Examples of adjuvants include, by example only,<br>
Freunds adjuvant, muramyl dipeptides, liposomes. Adjuvants may also be antibodies to receptors<br>
expressed by immune cells which act either agonistically or antagonistically. An adjuvant is<br>
distinct from a carrier which is often used to enhance an immune response to an antigen.<br>
A carrier is an immunogenic molecule which, when bound to a second molecule augments<br>
immune responses to the latter. Some antigens are not intrinsically immunogenic (i.e. not<br>
immunogenic in their own right) yet may be capable of generating antibody responses when<br>
associated with a foreign protein molecule such as keyhole-limpet haemocyanin or tetanus toxoid.<br>
Such antigens contain B-cell epitopes but no T cell epitopes. The protein moiety of such a<br>
conjugate (the "carrier" protein) provides T-cell epitopes which stimulate helper T-cells that in<br>
turn stimulate antigen-specific B-cells to differentiate into plasma cells and produce antibody<br>
against the antigen. Adjuvants that are protein ligands of immune cell receptors may have the<br>
quality of both adjuvant and carrier, the latter depending on their content of 'foreign' polypeptide<br>
sequences that can be recognised by T-cells of the immune system. The new adjuvants described<br>
in the present invention, may have both properties.<br>
Polyprotein antigens or polyladder proteins are produced by a number of parasitic and free-living<br>
nematode species. These polyproteins are generally composed of multiple units arranged in<br>
direct tandem arrays, and the proteins are generally synthesised as large precursor proteins which<br>
are cleaved by proteases to yield smaller fragments as a "ladder" with steps of around 15kDa,<br>
reflecting increments in the denominator molecular mass of the individual domains. The last 4<br>
amino acids of each such unit are usually comprise a protease-labile RX(K/R)R (or occasionally<br>
RXFR) motif. In addition these motifs are preceded by a cysteine residue 7,8 or 9 residues<br>
upstream (N-terminal of the motif) (McReynolds et al. (1993) Parasitology today 9 403-406),<br>
which may serve to distance the protease cleavage site from the body of the protein domain.<br>
Some parasite polyproteins (such as the DiAg proteins of Dirofilaria immitis) are strong immune<br>
stimulators, giving rise to production of antigen-non-specific IgE, and play important roles in the<br><br>
evasion of the immune response by parasites, by interfering with the production of parasite-<br>
specific IgE.<br>
One of the most important developments in medical science in recent history is the production of<br>
vaccines which provide prophylactic protection against a wide variety of infectious diseases.<br>
Many vaccines are currently in development for prevention and treatment of yet other categories<br>
of disease, including autoimmune, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. The present invention<br>
also applies to these additional categories of disease. Vaccines for the prevention of infectious<br>
diseases are, in many instances, made from inactivated or attenuated forms of the disease causing<br>
agent (or pathogen) which are injected or otherwise administered into a the recipient in order to<br>
prevent infection with the natural form of the pathogen. The recipient individual may respond by<br>
producing a humoral (antibody) response, a cellular (e.g. a cytolytic T cell, CTL) response, or<br>
both.<br>
The development of so-called subunit vaccines (in which the immunogen is a defined molecular<br>
fragment or subunit of an infectious agent, or a tumour antigen) has been the focus of<br>
considerable medical research. The need to identify candidate molecules (e.g. proteins or<br>
polysaccharides) useful in the development of subunit vaccines was originally based on the need<br>
for increased safety, and is also driven, in the case of vaccines against bacterial infections, by the<br>
increasing problem of antibiotic resistance. However, subunit vaccines tend to be less<br>
immunogenic than are vaccines based on whole organisms, and are more highly dependent on<br>
'adjuvants' in order to elicit an efficacious immune response that protects against infection with<br>
the target organism (or which generates an effective anti-tumour immune response).<br>
We describe a family of proteins which act as immunological adjuvants to enhance immune<br>
responses against various prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. The adjuvant system has potent<br>
action in stimulating immune responses against vaccine antigens. The new adjuvant system is<br>
particularly applicable to subunit vaccines, but is also readily applicable to other vaccine types<br>
(including vaccines based on whole organisms, nucleic acids etc.).<br>
Polyladder proteins of nematodes are known to be highly effective at inducing IgE responses.<br>
(Tomlinson et al. J.Immunol. 143 2349-2356 (1989); Paxton et al. Infect Immunol. 61 2827-2833<br>
(1993). However, some polyladder proteins (such as DiAg of Dirofilaria immitis) appear to<br>
subvert the appropriate immune response by generating antigen-non-specific IgE, which is<br><br>
incapable of binding to DiAg itself or to the parasite (Tezuka, H et al. Infection and Immunity,<br>
July 2003, 3802-3811), and may interfere with parasite elimination by arming mast cells and<br>
eosinophils with irrelevant IgE, to the exclusion of parasite-specific IgE. Moreover, IgE responses<br>
are generally regarded as an undesirable outcome of vaccination (at least in the case of vaccines<br>
against agents other than parasites), because IgE antibodies are associated with allergic reactions<br>
that can be dangerous and even life-threatening (e.g. anaphylaxis can occur in a subject who<br>
encounters an antigen, if they have pre-existing IgE antibodies specific for the antigen).<br>
Moreover, there is a finite risk that polyladder proteins could boost ongoing allergen-specific IgE<br>
responses in human subjects, or interfere with desirable immune responses to parasites if used in<br>
vaccine materials. In summary, the elicitation IgE responses by polyladder proteins and the<br>
elicitation of non-specific IgE responses that may interfere with parasite elimination or exacerbate<br>
allergic disease are all contraindications for the use of parasite polyladder proteins as vaccine<br>
constituents or adjuvants.<br>
Surprisingly, we now disclose that physical association, e.g. by conjugation or particulate co-<br>
formulation, of the polyladder proteins, (or preferably single repeat units of these proteins), is a<br>
means to achieve a very strongly enhanced immune response against the associated antigen, in the<br>
absence of a strong non-specific IgE response. We disclose that the physical association of<br>
polyladder proteins (or preferably individual single domain moieties of the polyladder proteins)<br>
with an antigen against which an immune response is desired can convert the potentially<br>
dangerous non-antigen-specific IgE response to the polyladder proteins into a beneficial adjuvant<br>
effect, giving rise to desirable antigen-specific antibodies against the antigen. We also disclose<br>
how the resulting antigen-specific immune response (to the polyladder-domain-associated vaccine<br>
antigen) can be biased towards IgG production (suitable for example for the elimination of<br>
bacterial pathogens), and towards the production of Thl type T-cell responses suitable for the<br>
elimination of intracellular parasites such as viruses (and some parasites), and biased away from<br>
potentially dangerous IgE responses. We also disclose how polyladder proteins or protein<br>
domains can be used to generate cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against the associated<br>
vaccine antigen, even when the antigen is administered in a non-particulate form. Furthermore,<br>
we disclose how polyladder protein domains (even domains of DiAg polyladder protein) can be<br>
used to generate desirable antigen-specific IgE responses against antigens (e.g. parasite antigens<br>
other than DiAg and polyladder proteins) that are physically associated with them.<br><br>
DiAg and related proteins have been shown to bias the immune system away from pathogenic<br>
Th1 responses responsible for autoimmune type-I (insulin dependent) diabetes in mice and are<br>
advocated as therapeutically useful for the treatment of Thl based autoimmune diseases (Imai, S.<br>
et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 286:1051-1058). Surprisingly therefore, in a further aspect<br>
of the present invention, we now disclose how DiAg and related proteins can be used to treat<br>
allergic diseases, which are the polar opposite (Th2) of the T-cell profile (Thl) involved in the<br>
pathogenesis of allergic diseases. The compositions and methods necessary to create these novel<br>
utilities of DiAg proteins are described below.<br>

In a preferred embodiment of the invention said polypeptide is mixed with said antigen.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, said polypeptide is conjugated, associated or<br>
crosslinked to said antigen.<br>
m a further preferred embodiment of the invention said polypeptide comprises a Dirofilaria<br>
immitis protein, Neutrophil chemotactic factor (NCF), or lymphocyte binding fragment thereof, or<br>
homologue thereof, or lymphocyte binding fragment of homologue thereof.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence<br>
selected from the group consisting of: SEQ NO. 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16;<br>
17; 18; 19; or a polypeptide which is at least 50% homologous, and more preferably 70%<br>
homologous, and more preferably still, 90% homologous to a sequence from this group.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the length of said polypeptide is of at least 20<br>
consecutive amino acids identical in sequence to at least a 20 amino acid portion of a sequence<br>
selected from SEQ ID No: 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18; or 19;.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said polypeptide is a lymphocyte binding fragment of<br>
such a protein.<br><br>
In another embodiment of the invention said polypeptide is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule<br>
comprising a nucleic acid sequence selected from a group consisting of, SEQ ID No: 20; 21; 22;<br>
23; 24; 25; 26; 27; 28; 29; 30; 31; 32; 33; or 34; or a nucleic acid molecule which hybridises<br>
under stringent hybridisation conditions to said nucleic acid molecule and which encodes a<br>
polypeptide with immunolgical adjuvant activity.<br>
Preferably said nucleic acid sequence has at least 50% homology to a sequence from this group,<br>
or preferably at least 70% homology to a nucleic acid sequence from this group, or more<br>
preferably at least 85% homology to a sequence from this group.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention said polypeptide is encoded by a 60 nucleotide portion<br>
of a nucleic acid sequence selected from a group consisting of: SEQ ID No: 20; 21; 22; 23; 24;<br>
25; 26; 27; 28; 29; 30; 31; 32; 33; or 34.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, adjuvant protein consists of a protein homologous to parts of a<br>
nematode ladder protein between, but not including the whole RX(K/R)R or RRFR sequence, and<br>
most preferably avoiding the R, K (and occasionally F) residues of this sequence.<br>
In further embodiment of the invention, RX(K/R)R protease cleavage motifs (such as those<br>
underlined in sequence (1) are mutated or are not included in the adjuvant protein.<br>
A useful example of this mutated sequence is a sequence wherein R and K residues are replaced<br>
by glycine 'G, residues. A second example is one in which the R and K residues are replaced by<br>
serine residues 'S'. A third example is where the R and K residues are replaced by G or S in any<br>
permutation (e.g. GXGS, SXSG, GXSG etc..)<br>
Usefully the linker may be longer than occurs naturally in polyladder proteins, (e.g. up to 30<br>
residues), most preferably 5-20 amino acid residues and typically lacks any strong propensity to<br>
secondary structure (such as helical propensity or tendency to form beta-sheet), and typically<br>
lacks residues capable of cleavage by trypsin-like enzymes (principally K and R).<br>
This lack of propensity to form secondary structure may usefully be engineered by incorporation<br>
of proline residues T' at intervals, e.g. every third residue or every tenth residue, but more<br>
preferably every 4th, 5th or 6th residue. Alternatively the prolines may be randomly distributed in<br><br>
the fusion zone of the sequence of the fusion protein such that a small linker sequence of 5<br>
residues would contain one proline, whereas a larger sequence of 15 residues would contain 3 or<br>
four prolines.<br>
The purpose of the linker sequence is primarily to join the two protein moieties in the fusion<br>
protein (namely the polyladder protein moiety and the antigen moiety), in a manner that is<br>
relatively stable to proteases (unlike the situation in the native polyladder protein sequence, where<br>
the boundaries between domains are highly protease labile). However a second function of the<br>
sequence is to allow the protein moieties to fold during biosynthesis into their native domains<br>
upon which their functional attributes (adjuvanticity and antigenicity/immunogenicity) depend.<br>
While the polypeptide linker used can take many forms, it is important that the linker does not<br>
contain sequences from human autoantigens (or autoantigens from the animal to be immunized).<br>
Thus putative linker sequences should be typically screened against databases in order to ensure<br>
that the linker has no significant homology to human proteins, especially proteins known or<br>
suspected to play a role in the aetiology of autoimmune diseases such as glutamate decarboxylase,<br>
insulin, thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase, islet cell autoantigens, parietal cell autoantigens,<br>
kidney autoantigens, myelin basic protein, myelin associated glycoprotein, myelin<br>
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein.<br>
An exception to this general rule would be the case where such proteins are non-organ specific in<br>
their distribution in the body, and abundantly expressed - such as the blood proteins albumin and<br>
the immunoglobulins. For example, the hinge region of IgG would make a good linker sequence<br>
for the said fusidn protein, since it is not especially protease labile. Likewise the hinge region of<br>
IgA would make a good linker sequence since only very few proteases (e.g. the meningococcal<br>
IgA protease) are able to cleave this sequence, despite its exposure (in the three dimensional<br>
structure of IgA) and flexible nature of the sequence. RX(K/R)R of RXFR motifs may be not<br>
included in the adjuvant protein, because the protein used as an adjuvant commences downstream<br>
(carboxy-terminal) of one cleavage motif, and ends upstream (amino terminal) of the next one.<br>
The start and end of me adjuvant protein can also be internal to the protease motifs.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said polypeptide is conjugated or crosslinked to said<br>
antigen with protein cross-linking agents such as glutaraldehyde or EDC (ethylcarbodiimide- a<br>
water soluble carbodiimide), or preferably with heterobifunctional reagents such as MBS and<br><br>
others described in the literature, and in the catalogue of the Pierce Chemical Company of<br>
Rockford, Illinois, USA, or the catalogue of Molecular Probes Inc. of Eugene, Oregon, USA.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said adjuvant is produced as a fusion protein with said<br>
antigen, by in frame fusion of nucleic acids encoding antigen and adjuvant using methods of in<br>
vitro DNA recombination and cloning that are well known in the art.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention said polypeptide and said antigen are<br>
encapsulated in synthetic microparticles or nanoparticles (e.g. polylactide-glycolide or 'PLG'),<br>
liposomes, or immune stimulating complexes (ISCOMs).<br>
Particulate formulation is desirable because it directs antigens to antigen-presenting cells<br>
favouring a Thl profile of immune response against the antigen, and countering any tendency of<br>
the polyladder protein moiety towards expression of Th2 profile and IgE production. Such modes<br>
of formulation will be useful for the stimulation of desirable cell-mediated and IgG antibody<br>
responses against the antigen. Particulate formulation also allows the facile incorporation of<br>
additional materials designed to bias the immune response in the direction of Thl. Such materials<br>
would typically include antibodies against IL 10 and IL4, Th1 cytokines such as IFN-gamma, and<br>
CpG DNA.<br>
Most favourably, particulate formulations will comprise both polyladder protein moiety and<br>
antigen against which an immune response is desired formulated in the same particle such that<br>
each particle in a formulation carries both entities as payloads. Such formulation ensures that both<br>
materials be taken up by any given single antigen presenting cell, and maximises the Thl biasing<br>
effect of particulate formulation for the payload antigen, even when such antigen and polyladder<br>
domain (and optional Thl biasing materials mentioned in the paragraph above) are not otherwise<br>
connected, except by being both present in the same particle.<br>
Particulate formulations preferably have a significant degree of surface exposure (5-10%) of<br>
polyladder protein moiety and antigen moiety. Generally such levels of exposure are achieved by<br>
default in the particulate formulation process. In cases where such exposure is not achieved, the<br>
aforesaid protein moieties can be conjugated to the surface of the particle by covalent<br>
conjugation. Surface exposure of the antigen moiety favours the stimulation of antigen specific B-<br>
cells and is helpful for antibody responses against the antigen.<br><br>
These particles are typically in the size range 150 nanometres up to 10 micrometres across. More<br>
preferably they are in the range 200 nanometres up to 2 micrometres.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said polypeptide and antigen are co-adsorbed or co-<br>
precipitated onto aluminium or calcium salts, such as aluminium hydroxide gel or calcium<br>
phosphate.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention said polypeptide is encoded by a nucleic acid<br>
molecule which is part of a vector wherein the expression of said polypeptide is operably<br>
controlled by a promoter.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said antigen is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule.<br>
Preferably said nucleic acid molecule is part of a vector wherein expression of said antigen is<br>
operably controlled by a promoter.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said polypeptide and said antigen are encoded by the<br>
same nucleic acid molecule. Preferably said nucleic acid molecule encodes an in frame fusion of<br>
said polypeptide and said antigen.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said in frame fusion includes a linker nucleic acid<br>
molecule encoding a flexible linker sequence (e.g. encoding oligo serine or glycine, or serine-<br>
glycine combinations with the number of residues).<br>
Preferably said vector is a "shuttle vector", capable of propagation in E.coli and of expression of<br>
the fusion protein in mammalian cells via a suitable promoter e.g. CMV or other eukaryotic<br>
promoter.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, the adjuvant protein domain (e.g. from NCF of D.<br>
immitis) is represented in several copies - (most preferably 1, 2 or 3) as co-linear fusions with<br>
antigen (in single copy) as part of the same polypeptide chain. Alternatively, the adjuvant protein<br>
domain is present as a single copy fused to an antigenic protein which forms oligomers (e.g.<br>
dimers, timers, tetramers etc.). In this latter construct the adjuvant protein domain becomes<br>
oligomeric once the antigen protein oligomerises. Most conveniently, a single copy of the<br>
adjuvant protein is made as an in-frame fusion with an oligomerising protein from the infectious<br><br>
agent against which a vaccine is designed to protect, such as the influenza hemagglutinin or the<br>
HIV coat glycoprotein gpl20. Alternatively, the adjuvant protein domain in single copy is fused<br>
to an antigen that does not oligomerise. In such cases, oligomeric forms may be created by<br>
incorporation of a protein moiety (such as a coiled coil) with a natural tendency to oligomerise.<br>
Examples of suitable oligomerising moieties are the paired helix coiled-coil structures of<br>
streptococci (e.g. the M-proteins) which form dimeric coiled coils; also trirneric helical protein<br>
moieties may also be used. One example is the stem part of type-2 membrane proteins such as<br>
CD23. Artificial coiled coil peptides that have been designed in order to study the assembly<br>
characterisitics of coiled coil proteins would also be suitable. Most preferably the degree of<br>
oligomerisation is the trimer, since this reflects the postulated natural state of the D. immitis<br>
protein. In instances where the adjuvant domain is represented in multiple copies, the most<br>
preferred embodiment will be the natural repeat structure of the D. immitis protein. In cases<br>
where a domain is repeated as part of a single polypeptide chain, it is most preferable to exploit<br>
alternative codon usage at the DNA level, in order to avoid direct repeats in the DNA sequence -<br>
which otherwise would give rise to problems of homologous recombination and deletion during<br>
propagation of the encoding DNA.<br>
A conjugate may be formed by the use of cross-linking agents to link adjuvant to antigen.<br>
Alternatively, conjugates may be translational fusions between adjuvant, and antigen.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention said composition comprises a carrier.<br>
In a still further preferred embodiment of the invention said composition comprises a second<br>
adjuvant.<br>

carcinoembryonic antigen, the human polymorphic epithelial mucin, MUC-1, or a hormone or<br>
analog thereof involved in hormone dependent cancer, such as gastrin).<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, said antigen is a ganglioside antigen.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention said antigen is a human host antigen, such as a<br>

fragment of a toxin or a toxoid.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a nucleic acid molecule which<br>
encodes conjugate wherein said conjugate comprises an antigenic polypeptide translationally<br>
fused to a nematode derived ladder protein in which an RX(K/R)R or RRFR motif is preceded 7,8<br>
or 9 residues upstream by a cysteine residue.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a means to treat allergic disease<br>
by administration of a solution or particulate (e.g. liposomal) formulation of a polyladder protein,<br>
or part thereof according to the invention (e.g.DiAg).<br>
An advantage of this mode of treatment of allergic disease is that it can be applied to all or any<br>
allergic disease, irrespective of the allergen, and even where the allergen(s) may be unknown (e.g.<br>
allergic asthmatic conditions). DiAg and related polyladder proteins, can be used to generate<br>
unusually large quantities of non-antigen-specific IgE that compete with sites (high affinity IgE<br>
receptors) on mast cells and eosinophils, deprive such cells of allergen-specific IgE, and prevent<br>
them from becoming activated and releasing inflammatory mediators upon contact with allergen.<br><br>
For example, because DiAg in human parasite infestations does not give rise to DiAg specific<br>
IgE, the risk of anaphylaxis developing as a result of DiAg therapy is minimal. In this aspect of<br>
the invention, individual polyladder (e.g. DiAg) domains can be used. Such domains can be<br>
administered as protein solutions in pharmaceutically acceptable saline vehicles, or encoded as<br>
DNA or RNA in plasmid or viral vectors for mammalian expression., or in liposomal vectors as<br>
plasmid constructs being expressible in the body of the vaccinee.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method to enhance the immune<br>
response against multivalent vaccines, especially multivalent polysaccharide vaccines by co-<br>
formulation of a carrier protein-polyladder conjugate or chimeric protein, with conjugates of<br>
various antigens, such as polysaccharide antigens with the same carrier protein.<br>
Typically, in this case the two carrier proteins may be the same protein, or may be different, but<br>
containing at least one T helper epitope in common with each other. One or both may be a<br>
synthetic peptide. An example might be multivalent pneumoccal conjugate vaccine, which<br>
consists of a number of different polysaccharides, each conjugated to a mutant diptheria toxoid.<br>
By the simple addition into this conjugate mixture of a polyladder protein-diptheria toxoid<br>
conjugate, immune responses against all the polysaccharide antigens in the conjugate will be<br>
strongly enhanced.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a nucleic acid molecule which<br>
encodes conjugate wherein said conjugate comprises an antigenic polypeptide translationally<br>
fused to adjuvant of at least 50%, homology, and more preferably at least 70% homology and<br>
more preferably still at least 90% homology to sequence from the group comprising: SEQ1,<br>
SEQ2, SEQ3, SEQ4, SEQ5, SEQ6, SEQ 7, SEQ8 SEQ9, SEQ10, SEQ11, SEQ 12.SEQ 13, SEQ<br>
14, SEQ 15, SEQ 16, SEQ 17, SEQ 18, SEQ 19.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a nucleic acid molecule which<br>
encodes conjugate wherein said conjugate comprises an antigenic polypeptide translationally<br>
fused to adjuvant where the adjuvant is a protein of at least 20 consecutive amino acids identical<br>
in sequence to at least a 20 amino acid portion of a sequence selected from the group comprising:<br>
SEQ 1, SEQ 2, SEQ 3, SEQ 4, SEQ 5, SEQ 6, SEQ 7, SEQ 8 SEQ 9, SEQ 10, SEQ 11, SEQ 12.<br>
SEQ 13, SEQ 14, SEQ 15, SEQ 16, SEQ 17, SEQ 18, SEQ 19.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, said nucleic acid molecule is part of an expression<br>
vector wherein said nucleic acid molecule is operably linked to a promoter.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention said vector is selected from the group<br>
consisting of: a plasmid; a phagemid; or a virus.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention said viral based vector is based on viruses<br>
selected from the group consisting of: adenovirus; retrovirus; adeno associated virus; herpesvirus;<br>
lentivirus; baculovirus.<br>
As used herein, a "vector" may be any of a number of nucleic acids into which a desired sequence<br>
may be inserted. Vectors include, but are not limited to, plasmids, phagemids and virus genomes.<br>
A cloning vector is one which is able to replicate in a host cell, and which typically is further<br>
characterised by one or more endonuclease restriction sites at which the vector may be cut in a<br>
determinable fashion and into which a desired DNA sequence may be ligated such that the<br>
recombinant vector retains its ability to replicate in the host cell. In the case of plasmids,<br>
replication of the desired sequence may occur many times as the plasmid increases in copy<br>
number within the host bacterium or just a single time per host before the host reproduces by<br>
mitosis. In the case of phage, replication may occur actively during a lytic phase or passively<br>
during a lysogenic phase.<br>
Vectors may further contain one or more selectable marker sequences suitable for use in the<br>
identification of cells which have or have not been transformed or transfected with the vector.<br>
Markers include, for example, genes encoding proteins which increase or decrease either<br>
resistance or sensitivity to antibiotics or other compounds, genes which encode enzymes whose<br>
activities are detectable by standard assays known in the art (e.g., -galactosidase, luciferase), and<br>
genes which visibly affect the phenotype of transformed or transfected cells, hosts, colonies or<br>
plaques (e.g., various fluorescent proteins such as green fluorescent protein, GFP). Preferred<br>
vectors are those capable of autonomous replication, also referred to as episomal vectors.<br>
Alternatively vectors may be adapted to insert into a chromosome, so called integrating vectors.<br>
The vector of the invention is typically provided with transcription control sequences (promoter<br>
sequences) which mediate cell/tissue specific expression. These promoter sequences may be<br>
cell/tissue specific, inducible or constitutive.<br><br>
Promoter is an art recognised term and, for the sake of clarity, includes the following features<br>
which are provided by example only, and not by way of limitation. Enhancer elements are cis<br>
acting nucleic acid sequences often found 5' to the transcription initiation site of a gene<br>
(enhancers can also be found 3' to a gene sequence or even located in intronic sequences and is<br>
therefore position independent). Enhancers function to increase the rate of transcription of the<br>
gene to which the enhancer is linked. Enhancer activity is responsive to trans acting transcription<br>
factors (polypeptides) which have been shown to bind specifically to enhancer elements. The<br>
binding/activity of transcription factors (please see Eukaryotic Transcription Factors, by David S<br>
Latchman, Academic Press Ltd, San Diego) is responsive to a number of environmental cues<br>
which include, by example and not by way of limitation, intermediary metabolites, environmental<br>
effectors.<br>
Promoter elements also include so called TATA box, RNA polymerase initiation selection (RIS)<br>
sequences and CAAT box sequence elements which function to select a site of transcription<br>
initiation. These sequences also bind polypeptides which function, inter alia, to facilitate<br>
transcription initiation selection by RNA polymerase.<br>
Adaptations also include the provision of autonomous replication sequences which both facilitate<br>
the maintenance of said vector in either the eukaryotic cell or prokaryotic host, so called "shuttle<br>
vectors". Vectors which are maintained autonomously are referred to as episomal vectors.<br>
Episomal vectors are desirable since these molecules can incorporate large DNA fragments (30-<br>
50kb DNA). Episomal vectors of this type are described in WO98/07876.<br>
Adaptations which facilitate the expression of vector encoded genes include the provision of<br>
transcription terrnination/polyadenylation sequences. This also includes the provision of internal<br>
ribosome entry sites (IRES) which function to maximise expression of vector encoded genes<br>
arranged in bi-cistronic or multi-cistronic expression cassettes.<br>
Expression control sequences also include so-called Locus Control Regions (LCRs). These are<br>
regulatory elements which confer position-independent, copy number-dependent expression to<br>
linked genes when assayed as transgenic constructs in mice. LCRs include regulatory elements<br>
that insulate transgenes from the silencing effects of adjacent heterochromatin, Grosveld et al.,<br>
Cell (1987), 51: 975-985.<br><br>
These adaptations are well known in the art. There is a significant amount of published literature<br>
with respect to expression vector construction and recombinant DNA techniques in general.<br>
Please see, Sambrook et al (1989) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring<br>
Harbour Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbour, NY and references therein; Marston, F (1987) DNA<br>
Cloning Techniques: A Practical Approach Vol III IRL Press, Oxford UK.; DNA Cloning: F M<br>
Ausubel et al, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.(1994).<br>
It is known in the art that nucleic sequences are present in vectors known as CpG motifs or ISSs<br>
(immune stimulating sequences). These consist minimally of non-methylated CG dinucleotides as<br>
a core, although sequences adjacent to the dinucleotide affect the magnitude of the stimulation<br>
induced. These ISSs activate antigen presenting cells (APCs) through a toll-like receptor<br>
(TLR9). The general aim in DNA vaccination is to include these motifs in the vector, as they<br>
enhance the response by activating APCs.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention said promoter is a tissue specific promoter,<br>
such as a muscle specific promoter, allowing intramuscular immunisation with DNA-based<br>
vaccines.<br>
Muscle specific promoters are known in the art For example, WO0009689 discloses a striated<br>
muscle expressed gene and its cognate promoter, the SPEG gene. EP1072680 discloses the<br>
regulatory region of the myostatin promoter. US5795872 discloses the use of the creatine kinase<br>
promoter to achieve high levels of expression of foreign proteins in muscle tissue. The muscle<br>
specific gene Myo D shows a pattern of expression substantially restricted to myoblasts.<br>
According to a yet further aspect of the invention there is provided a vaccine comprising a nucleic<br>
acid or a vector according to the invention.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method to immunise an animal<br>
to an antigen, comprising administering an effective amount of a conjugate according to the<br>
invention sufficient to stimulate an immune response to said antigen.<br>
In a preferred method of the invention said animal is human.<br><br>
In an alternative preferred method of the invention said animal is selected from the group<br>
consisting of: mouse; rat; hamster; goat; sheep, dog or cat.<br>
In a further preferred method of the invention, said animal is immuno-compromised, for example<br>
a Hu-SCID-PBL mouse, or a SCID-hu mouse, or a mouse or other animal otherwise engrafted<br>
with human lymphocytes or lymphocyte precursors, such that human antibody and T cell<br>
responses can be induced.<br>
Immuno-deficient or immuno-compromised mammals are know in the art. For example,<br>
EP0322240 and EP0438053 disclose the grafting of haematopoietic cells into a CUD or SCID host<br>
organism (see McGurre et al Clinical Immunology and Immunopathology (1975) 3: 555-566)<br>
each of which is incorporated by reference. WO9505736, which is incorporated by reference,<br>
also teaches the use of SCID organisms and their use as hosts for human cells.<br>
In a still further preferred method of the invention, said animal is transgenic for human<br>
immunoglobulin or T cell receptor DNA.<br>
In a further preferred method of the invention said immune response is the production of<br>
antibodies to said conjugate.<br>
In an alternative preferred method of the invention said immune response is the production of T-<br>
helper cells which recognise the antigen part of said conjugate.<br>
In a further preferred method of the invention, said immune response is the production of<br>
cytolytic T lymphocytes which recognise the antigen part of said conjugate.<br>
Preferred routes of administration are oral (e.g. mucosal), intradermal, subcutaneous, intranasal<br>
or intramuscular, however the immunisation method is not restricted to a particular mode of<br>
administration.<br>
According to a yet further aspect of the invention there is provided an antibody obtainable by the<br>
method according to the invention.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said antibody is a therapeutic antibody.<br><br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention said antibody is a diagnostic antibody.<br>
Preferably said diagnostic antibody is provided with a label or tag.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said antibody is a monoclonal antibody or binding<br>
fragment thereof. Preferably said antibody is a humanised or chimeric antibody.<br>
A chimeric antibody is produced by recombinant methods to contain the variable region of an.<br>
antibody with an invariant or constant region of a human antibody.<br>
A humanised antibody is produced by recombinant methods to combine the complimentarity<br>
determining regions of an antibody with both the constant (C) regions and the framework regions<br>
from the variable (V) regions of a human antibody.<br>
Chimeric antibodies are recombinant antibodies in which all of the V-regions of a mouse or rat<br>
antibody are combined with human antibody C-regions. Humanised antibodies are recombinant<br>
hybrid antibodies which fuse the complimentarity determining regions from a rodent antibody V-<br>
region with the framework regions from the human antibody V-regions. The C-regions from the<br>
human antibody are also used. The complimentarity determining regions (CDRs) are the regions<br>
within the N-terminal domain of both the heavy and light chain of the antibody to where the<br>
majority of the variation of the V-region is restricted. These regions form loops at the surface of<br>
the antibody molecule. These loops provide the binding surface between the antibody and<br>
antigen.<br>
Preferably said fragments are single chain antibody variable regions (scFV's) or "domain"<br>
antibody fragments. If a hybidoma exists for a specific monoclonal antibody it is well within the<br>
knowledge of the skilled person to isolate scFv' s from mRNA extracted from said hybridoma via<br>
RT PCR. Alternatively, phage display screening can be undertaken to identify clones expressing<br>
scFv's. Domain antibodies are the smallest binding part of an antibody (approximately 13kDa).<br>
Examples of this technology is disclosed in US6, 248, 516, US6, 291, 158, US6.127, 197 and<br>
EP03 68684 which are all incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said fragment is a Fab fragment.<br><br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention said antibody is selected from the group<br>
consisting of: F(ab')2 Fab, Fv and Fd fragments; CDR3 regions; single chain variable region<br>
fragments; or domain region fragments.<br>
Antibodies from non-human animals provoke an immune response to the foreign antibody and its<br>
removal from the circulation. Both chimeric and humanised antibodies have reduced antigenicity<br>
when injected to a human subject because there is a reduced amount of rodent (i.e. foreign)<br>
antibody within the recombinant hybrid antibody, while the human antibody regions do not illicit<br>
an immune response. This results in a weaker immune response and a decrease in the clearance of<br>
the antibody. This is clearly desirable when using therapeutic antibodies in the treatment of<br>
human diseases. Humanised antibodies are designed to have less "foreign" antibody regions and<br>
are therefore thought to be less immunogenic than chimeric antibodies.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention said antibodies are opsonic antibodies.<br>
Phagocytosis is mediated by macrophages and polymorphic leukocytes and involves the ingestion<br>
and digestion of micro-organisms, damaged or dead cells, cell debris, insoluble particles and<br>
activated clotting factors. Opsonins are agents which facilitate the phagocytosis of the above<br>
foreign bodies. Opsonic antibodies are therefore antibodies which provide the same function.<br>
Examples of opsonins are the Fc portion of an antibody or compliment C3.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method for preparing a hybridoma cell-line<br>
producing monoclonal antibodies according to the invention comprising the steps of:<br>
i)	immunising an immunocompetent mammal with a conjugate, composition,<br>
nucleic acid or vector according to the invention;<br>
ii) fusing lymphocytes of the immunised immunocompetent mammal with myeloma<br>
cells to form hybridoma cells;<br>
iii) screening monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells of step (ii) for<br>
binding activity to the antigen of the conjugate according to the invention;<br>
iv) culturing the hybridoma cells to proliferate and/or to secrete said monoclonal<br>
antibody; and<br>
v)	recovering the monoclonal antibody from the culture supernatant.<br><br>
Preferably, the said immunocompetent mammal is a mouse. Alternatively, said<br>
immunocompetent mammal is arat.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a hybridoma cell-line obtainable<br>
by the method according to the invention.<br>
An embodiment of the invention will now be described by example only and with reference to the<br>
following materials, methods and sequences.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
1. Production of an antigen-adjuvant conjugate<br>
a.	Production of recombinant adjuvant protein.<br>
The V1 domain (a repeating unit) of DiAg gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction<br>
(PCR) with primers (5_-primer, including NdeI restriction site: 5_GCATATGAATGAT-<br>
CATAATTTAGAAAGC-<br>
3_,3_-primer,	including	BamHI	restriction	site:	5_-<br>
CTAAAGGATCCTATCACCGCTTACGCCGTTCATTCATTG-3_)<br>
from from a D.immitis cDNA library. Amplified DNA was digested with Ndel and BamHI and<br>
cloned into pET3a vector (Stratagene) for expression in E. coli HMS174 (DE3). The purification<br>
of rDiAg was performed as follows. Five g of cell paste was suspended in 30 ml of 50 mM HC1<br>
and 5 mM EDTA at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min. Recombinant DiAg in the<br>
supernatant was precipitated by 60—80% saturated ammonium sulfate and then applied on a<br>
Superdex 200 column. Contaminants of pyrogen from E. coli were removed from concentrated<br>
rDiAg solution by immobilized polymixin B. The isolated adjuvant protein was lyophilized and<br>
stored at-20 °C until use.<br>
b.	Conjugation of adjuivant protein to antigen<br>
One of a number of possible methods for conjugating a peptide to an antibody would be as<br>
follows, by way of example only:<br><br>
The	D.immitis	polyladder	protein	V1	domain	adjuvant<br>
(YFQTYLSWLTDAQKDEKKMKEEGKSKM I QKKI F D Y F E S<br>

KIODEYPPVCRKIYAAMNEKRK) (Adjuvant) is dissolved in 0.1M Sodium phosphate, 0.15M<br>
NaCl, pH 7.2 at a concentration of 3-30mg/ml. 6mg of sulfo-SMCC (Pierce) are added, and the<br>
mixture incubated at room temperature for 30min. Excess cross-linker is then immediately<br>
removed on a desalting column (Sephadex G-25) or by ultrafiltration using 0.1M Sodium<br>
phosphate, 0.15M NaCl, pH 7.2 as the chromatography buffer. Fractions containing the peptide<br>
(by OD280) are pooled and the maleimide activated peptide concentrated to around lOmg/ml.<br>
In the meantime, antigen, for example, purified recombinant HSV glycoprotein D antigen (gD) is<br>
dissolved in or exchanged into the 0.1M Sodium phosphate, 0.15M NaCl, pH 7.2 buffer at 1-<br>
5mg/ml. Add 10-40ul of SATA (Pierce) stock solution (8mg/ml in DMSO or DMF) for each ml<br>
of gD at lmg/ml. React for 30min at room temperature. gD is then purified away from unreacted<br>
SATA by dialysis, gel filtration or ultrafiltration.<br>
Acetylated sulphydryl groups on the SATA modified gD are then de-protected as follows:<br>
A 0.5M hydroxylamine solution in 0.1M sodium phosphate, ph7.2 with lOmM EDTA is<br>
prepared. lOOul of this solution is added to each ml of antibody and left for 2h at room<br>
temperature. The thiolated gD is then purified by utrafiltration into 0.1M sodium phosphate, 0.1M<br>
NaCl, pH 7.2, 10mMEDTA, and immediately mixed with maleimide activated DiAg at a 1:10<br>
molar ratio of gD to DiAg. The reaction is allowed to continue for two hours at 37C. Conjugated<br>
gD-DiAg is then purified away from unreacted DiAg by ultrafiltration.<br>
2. Production of an antigen-adjuvant fusion protein<br>
The VI domain (a repeating unit) of the Dirofilaria immitis polyladder protein was amplified by<br>
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers (5_-primer, including HinoTI restriction site:<br>
5_GAAGCTTAATGATCATAATTTAGAAAGC-<br>
3_,3_-primer,	including	BamHI	restriction	site:	5_-<br>
CTAAAGGATCCTATCACCGCTTACGCCGTTCATTCATTG-3J<br>
from a D.immitis cDNA library. Amplified DNA was digested with Hind HI and BamHI.<br><br>
Meanwhile gD encoding DNA was amplified from HSV infected cells using primers<br>
incorporating additional nucleic acids and a Bam H1 restriction site in the 5' primer such that<br>
upon digestion with Bam HI and ligation to the DiAg encoding fragment, the DiAg and the gD<br>
encoding cDNAs were in-frame with each other, allowing continuous transcription of the DNA<br>
into an mRNA translatable into a fusion protein consisting of DiAg and gD. . These two DNA<br>
fragments were ligated into a mammalian expression vector (pcDNA3.1.(InVitrogen)) and this<br>
plasmid was used to transform competent E.coli cells allowing the poduction of sufficient<br>
quantity of plasmid (purified using a Qiagen column) to transfect COS-7 cells by electroporation.<br>
Fusion protein was purified from transfected COS-7 cell supernatant after 3-5 days using an anti-<br>
DiAg affinity column, and aftter further purification by gel filtration, fusion protein was used for<br>
immunisation.<br>
3. Production of a DNA vaccine encoding an antigen-adjnvant fusion protein.<br>
The pcDNAJ.l expression vector with insert, produced as described above, was used directly as a<br>
DNA vaccine by intramuscular injection<br>

20.	A composition as claimed in any of claims 1-12 wherein said antigen is a priori protein.<br>
21.	A composition as claimed in any of claims 1-20 wherein said composition comprises a<br>
carrier or a second adjuvant.<br><br>
The invention relates to a set of novel immunological adjuvants based upon so called<br>
"polyladder" proteins of nematode worms. These proteins are typified by repeating units<br>
separated by a protease cleavage motif of RX(K/R)R or RXFR where R is arginine, X is<br>
any amino acid, K is lysine and F is phenylalanine. These motifs are preceded by a<br>
cysteine residue at around 7, 8 or 9 residues upstream. Polyladder proteins or fragments<br>
of polyladder proteins may be used as immunological adjuvants either mixed with, or<br>
conjugated to a vaccine antigen, and will strongly enhance the immune response against<br>
the antigen. Conjugation may take the form of a genetic fusion between adjuvant and<br>
antigen. Antigens may be derived from pathogens, or may be tumour antigens,<br>
autoantigens, or antigens of other kinds. Vaccines may be used for prophylaxis or<br>
therapy.</td>
