				<td>SULFONYLAMINO-DERIVA'nVES AS NOVEL INHIBITORS OF HISTONE<br>
DEACETYLASE.<br>
This invention concerns compounds having histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibiting enzymatic activity. It further relates to processes for their preparation, to compositions comprising them, as well as their use, both in vitro and in vivo, to inhibit HDAC and as a medicine, for instance as a medicine to inhibit proliferative conditions, such as cancer and psoriasis.<br>
In all eukaryotic cells, genomic DNA in chromatine associates with histones to form nucleosomes. Each nucleosome consists of a protein octamer made up of two copies of each histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. DNA winds around this protein core, with the basic amino acids of the histones interacting with the negatively charged phosphate groups of the DNA. The most common posttranslational modification of these core histones is the reversible acetylation of the e-amino groups of conserved, highly basic N-terminal lysine residues. The steady state of histone acetylation is established by the dynamic equilibrium between competing histone acetyltransferase(s) and histone deacetylase(s) herein referred to as "HDAC". Histone acetylation and deacetylation has long been linked to transcriptional control. The recent cloning of the genes encoding different histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases provided a possible explanation for the relationship between histone acetylation and transcriptional control. The reversible acetylation of histones can result in chromatin remodelling and as such act as a control mechanism for gene transcription. In general, hyperacetylation of histones facilitates gene expression, whereas histone deacetylation is correlated with transcriptional repression. Histone acetyltransferases were shown to act as transcriptional coactivators, whereas histone deacetylases were found to belong to transcriptional repression pathways.<br>
The dynamic equilibrium between histone acetylation and deacetylation is essential for normal cell growth. Inhibition of histone deacetylase results in cell cycle arrest, cellular differentiation, apoptosis and reversal of the transformed phenotype. Therefore HDAC inhibitors can have great therapeutic potential in the treatment of cell proliferative diseases or conditions (Marks et al., Nature Reviews: Cancer 1: 194-202,2001)<br>
The study of inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDAC) indicates that indeed these enzymes play an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation. The inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) causes cell cycle arrest at both Gl and G2 phases, reverts the transformed phenotype of different cell lines, and induces differentiation of Friend<br><br>
leukemia cells and others. TSA (and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid SAHA) have been reported to inhibit cell growth, induce terminal differentiation, and prevent the formation of tumours in mice (Finnin et al., Nature, 401: 188-193,1999).<br>
Trichostatin A has also been reported to be useful in the treatment of fibrosis, e.g. liver fibrosis and liver chirrhosis. (Geerts et al., European Patent Application EP 0 827 742, published 11 March, 1998).<br>
Patent application WO01/38322 published on May 31, 2001 discloses amongst others inhibitors of histone deacetylase of general formula Cy-L'-Ar-Y'-QCO-NH-Z, providing compositions and methods for treating cell proliferative diseases and conditions.<br>
Patent application WO01/70675 published on 27 September, 2001 discloses inhibitors of histone deacetylase of formula Cy-S(0)2-NH-Y3-W and further provides compositions and methods for treating cell proliferative diseases and conditions.<br>
The problem to be solved is to provide histone deacetylase inhibitors with high enzymatic activity and also show advantageous properties such as cellular activity and increased bioavailability, preferably oral bioavailability, and have little or no side effects.<br>
The novel compounds of the present invention solve the above-described problem. The compounds differ from the prior art in structure.<br>
The compounds of the present invention show excellent in-vitro histone deacetylase inhibiting enzymatic activity. The present compounds have advantageous properties with regard to cellular activity and specific properties with regard to inhibition of cell cycle progression at both Gl and G2 checkpoints (p21 induction capacity). The compounds of the present invention show good metabolic stability and high bioavailability and more particular they show oral bioavailability. Moreover, the compounds of the present invention have a low affinity for the P450 enzymes, which reduces the risk of adverse drug-drug interaction allowing also for a wider safety margin.<br>

The term "histone deacetylase inhibitor" or "inhibitor of histone deacetylase" is used to identify a compound, which is capable of interacting with a histone deacetylase and inhibiting its activity, more particularly its enzymatic activity. Inhibiting histone deacetylase enzymatic activity means reducing the ability of a histone deacetylase to remove an acetyl group from a histone. Preferably, such inhibition is specific, i.e. the histone deacetylase inhibitor reduces the ability of a histone deacetylase to remove an acetyl group from a histone at a concentration that is lower than the concentration of the inhibitor that is required to produce some other, unrelated biological effect.<br>

The compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and N-oxides and stereochemically isomeric forms thereof may be prepared in conventional manner. Two general synthesis routes are encompassed as example: la) Hydroxamic acids of formula (I) wherein R1 is -C(O)NH(OH), said compounds being referred to as compounds of formula (I-a), may be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (II) with an appropriate acid, such as for example, trifluoro acetic acid. Said reaction is performed in an appropriate solvent, such as, for example, methanol.<br>
(Figure Remove) <br>
intermediates of formula (II) may be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (III) with an intermediate of formula (IV) in the presence of appropriate reagents such as /f-(ethylcarbonimidoyl)-//,A^-dimethyl-l,3-propanediamine,<br>
monohydrochloride (EDC) and l-hydroxy-l//-benzotriazole (HOBT). The reaction may be performed in a suitable solvent such as a mixture of DCM and THF.<br>
Ic) intermediates of formula (ID) may be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (V) with an appropriate base such as NaOH in the presence of a suitable solvent such as ethanol. (Figure Remove)<br>
2) Compounds of formula (I) wherein R1 is -NHC(O)C=N(OH)R10 wherein R10is arylCj-galkyl' said compounds being referred to as compounds of formula (I-b), may be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (VI) with an appropriate acid, such as for example, methane sulfonic acid. Said reaction is performed in an appropriate solvent, such as, for example, methanol.<br>
(Figure Remove) <br>
The compounds of formula (I) can also conveniently be prepared using solid phase synthesis techniques. In general, solid phase synthesis involves reacting an intermediate in a synthesis with a polymer support. This polymer-supported intermediate can then be carried on through a number of synthesis steps. After each step, filtering the resin and washing it numerous times with various solvents remove impurities. At each step the resin can be split up to react with various intermediates in the next step thus allowing for the synthesis of a large number of compounds. After the last step in the procedure the resin is treated with a reagent or process to cleave the resin from the sample. More detailed explanation of the techniques used in solid phase chemistry is described in for example "The Combinatorial Index" (B.Bunin, Academic Press) and Novabiochem's 1999 Catalogue &amp; Peptide Synthesis Handbook (Novabiochem AG, Switzerland) both incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and some of the intermediates may have at least one stereogenic centre in their structure. This stereogenic centre may be present in an R or an S configuration.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) as prepared in the hereinabove described processes are generally racemic mixtures of enantiomers, which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of formula (I) may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated there from by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) involves liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific<br>
stereoisomer is desired, said compound would be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and stereoisomeric forms thereof have valuable pharmacological properties in that they have a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitory effect.<br>
This invention provides a method for inhibiting the abnormal growth of cells, including transformed cells, by administering an effective amount of a compound of the invention.

Hence, the present invention discloses the compounds of formula (I) for use as a medicine as well as the use of these compounds of formula (I) for the manufacture of a medicament for treating one or more of the above-mentioned conditions.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and stereoisomeric forms thereof can have valuable diagnostic properties in that they can be<br>
used for detecting or identifying a HDAC in a biological sample comprising detecting or measuring the formation of a complex between a labelled compound and a HDAC.<br>
The detecting or identifying methods can use compounds that are labelled with labelling agents such as radioisotopes, enzymes, fluorescent substances, luminous substances, etc. Examples of the radioisotopes include I251,1311,3H and 14C. Enzymes are usually made detectable by conjugation of an appropriate substrate which, in turn catalyses a detectable reaction. Examples thereof include, for example, beta-galactosidase, beta-glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase, peroxidase and malate dehydrogenase, preferably horseradish peroxidase. The luminous substances include, for example, luminol, luminol derivatives, luciferin, aequorin and luciferase.<br>
Biological samples can be defined as body tissue or body fluids. Examples of body fluids are cerebrospinal fluid, blood, plasma, serum, urine, sputum, saliva and the like.<br>
In view of their useful pharmacological properties, the subject compounds may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes.<br>
To prepare the phannaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of a particular compound, in base or acid addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets.<br>
Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, to aid solubility for example, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case<br><br>
appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not cause a significant deleterious effect to the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on or as an ointment.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient, calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>
Those skilled in the art could easily determine the effective amount from the test results presented hereinafter. In general it is contemplated that a therapeutically effective amount would be from 0.005 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg body weight, and in particular from 0.005 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to administer the required dose as two, three, four or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example, containing 0.5 to 500 mg, and in particular 10 mg to 500 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.<br>
As another aspect of the present invention a combination of a HDAC-inhibitor with another anticancer agent is envisaged, especially for use as a medicine, more specifically in the treatment of cancer or related diseases.<br>

The term "platinum coordination compound" is used herein to denote any tumour cell growth inhibiting platinum coordination compound which provides platinum in the form of an ion.<br>
The term "taxane compounds" indicates a class of compounds having the taxane ring system and related to or derived from extracts from certain species of yew (Taxus) trees.<br>
The term "topisomerase inhibitors" is used to indicate enzymes that are capable of altering DNA topology in eukaryotic cells. They are critical for important cellular functions and cell proliferation. There are two classes of topoisomerases in eukaryotic cells, namely type I and type II. Topoisomerase I is a monomeric enzyme of approximately 100,000 molecular weight. The enzyme binds to DNA and introduces a transient single-strand break, unwinds the double helix (or allows it to unwind) and subsequently reseals the break before dissociating from the DNA strand. Topisomerase<br><br>
II has a similar mechanism of action which involves the induction of DNA strand breaks or the formation of free radicals.<br>
The term "camptothecin compounds" is used to indicate compounds that are related to<br>
or derived from the parent camptothecin compound which is a water-insoluble alkaloid<br>
derived from the Chinese tree Camptothecin acuminata and the Indian tree<br>
Nothapodytes foetida.<br>
The term "podophyllotoxin compounds" is used to indicate compounds that are related<br>
to or derived from the parent podophyllotoxin, which is extracted from the mandrake<br>
plant.<br>
The term "anti-tumour vinca alkaloids" is used to indicate compounds that are related to or derived from extracts of the periwinkle plant (Vinca rosea).<br>
The term "alkylating agents" encompass a diverse group of chemicals that have the common feature that they have the capacity to contribute, under physiological conditions, alkyl groups to biologically vital macromolecules such as DNA. With most of the more important agents such as the nitrogen mustards and the nitrosoureas, the active alkylating moieties are generated in vivo after complex degradative reactions, some of which are enzymatic. The most important pharmacological actions of the alkylating agents are those that disturb the fundamental mechanisms concerned with cell proliferation in particular DNA synthesis and cell division. The capacity of alkylating agents to interfere with DNA function and integrity in rapidly proliferating tissues provides the basis for their therapeutic applications and for many of their toxic properties.<br>
The term "anti-tumour anthracycline derivatives" comprise antibiotics obtained from the fungus Strep, peuticus var. caesius and their derivatives, characterised by having a tetracycline ring structure with an unusual sugar, daunosamine, attached by a glycosidic linkage.<br>
Amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein (HER 2) in primary breast carcinomas has been shown to correlate with a poor clinical prognosis for certain patients. Trastuzumab is a highly purified recombinant DNA-derived humanized monoclonal IgGl kappa antibody that binds with high affiniity and specificity to the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor.<br><br>
Many breast cancers have estrogen receptors and growth of these tumours can be stimulated by estrogen. The terms "estrogen receptor antagonists" and "selective estrogen receptor modulators" are used to indicate competitive inhibitors of estradiol binding to the estrogen receptor (ER). Selective estrogen receptor modulators, when bond to the ER, induces a change in the three-dimensional shape of the receptor, inhibiting its binding to the estrogen responsive element (ERE) on DNA.<br>
In postmenopausal women, the principal source of circulating estrogen is from conversion of adrenal and ovarian androgens (androstenedione and testosterone) to estrogens (estrone and estradiol) by the aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues. Estrogen deprivation through aromatase inhibition or inactivation is an effective and selective treatment for some postmenopausal patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer.<br>
The term "antiestrogen agent" is used herein to include not only estrogen receptor antagonists and selective estrogen receptor modulators but also aromatase inhibitors as discussed above.<br>
The term "differentiating agents" encompass compounds that can, in various ways, inhibit cell proliferation and induce differentiation. Vitamin D and retinoids are known to play a major role in regulating growth and differentiation of a wide variety of normal and malignant cell types. Retinoic acid metabolism blocking agents (RAMBA's) increase the levels of endogenous retinoic acids by inhibiting the cytochrome P450-mediated catabolism of retinoic acids.<br>
DNA methylation changes are among the most common abnormalities in human neoplasia. Hypermethylation within the promoters of selected genes is usually associated with inactivation of the involved genes. The term "DNA methyl transferase inhibitors" is used to indicate compounds that act through pharmacological inhibition of DNA methyl transferase and reactivation of tumour suppressor gene expression.<br>
The term "kinase inhibitors" comprises potent inhibitors of kinases that are involved in cell cycle progression and programmed cell death (apoptosis)<br>
The term "farnesyltransferase inhibitors" is used to indicate compounds that were designed to prevent famesylation of Ras and other intracellular proteins. They have been shown to have effect on malignant cell proliferation and survival.<br><br>
The term "other HDAC inhibitors" comprises but is not limited to:<br>
-	short-chain fatty acids for example butyrate, 4-phenylbutyrate or valproic acid;<br>
-	hydroxamic acids for example suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), biaryl<br>
hydroxamate A-161906, bicyclic aryl-//-hydroxycarboxamides, pyroxamide,<br>
CO-1521, PXD-101, sulfonamide hydroxamic acid, LAQ-824, trichostatin A<br>
(TSA), oxamflatin, scriptaid, m-carboxy cinnamic acid bishydroxamic acid, or<br>
trapoxin-hydroxarnic acid analogue;<br>
-	cyclic tetrapeptides for example trapoxin, apidicin or depsipeptide;<br>
-	benzamides for example MS-275 or CI-994, or<br>
-	depudecin.<br>

C. Pharmacological example:<br>
The in vitro assay for inhibition of histone deacetylase (see example C.I) measures the inhibition of HDAC enzymatic activity obtained with the compounds of formula (I).<br>
Cellular activity of the compounds of formula (I) was determined on A2780 tumour cells using a colorimetric assay for cell toxicity or survival (Mosmann Tim, Journal of Immunological Methods 65: 55-63,1983)(see example C.2).<br>
Kinetic solubility in aqueous media measures the ability of a compound to stay in aqueous solution upon dilution (see example C.3).<br>
DMSO-stock solutions are diluted with a single aqueous buffer solvent in 3 consecutive steps. For every dilution turbidity is measured with a nephelometer.<br>
A drug's permeability expresses its ability to move from one medium into or through another. Specifically its ability to move through the intestinal membrane into the blood stream and/or from the blood stream into the target. Permeability (see example C.4) can be measured through the formation of a filter-immobilized artificial membrane phospholipid bilayer. In the filter-immobilized artificial membrane assay, a "sandwich" is formed with a 96-well microtitre plate and a 96-well filter plate, such that each composite well is divided into two chambers with a donor solution at the bottom and an acceptor solution at the top, separated by a 125 urn micro-filter disc (0.45 pm pores), coated with 2%(wt/v) dodecane solution of dioleoylphosphatidyl-choline, under conditions that multi-lamellar bilayers form inside the filter channels when the system contacts an aqueous buffer solution. The permeability of compounds through this artificial membrane is measured in cm/s. The purpose is to look for the permeation of the drugs through a parallel artificial membrane at 2 different pH's: 4.0 and 7.4. Compound detection is done with UV-spectrometry at optimal wavelength between 250 and 500 nm.<br>
Metabolism of drugs means that a lipid-soluble xenobiotic or endobiotic compound is enzymatically transformed into (a) polar, water-soluble, and excretable metabolite(s). The major organ for drug metabolism is the liver. The metabolic products are often less active than the parent drug or inactive. However, some metabolites may have enhanced activity or toxic effects. Thus drug metabolism may include both "detoxication" and "toxication" processes. One of the major enzyme systems that determine the organism's capability of dealing with drugs and chemicals is represented by the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, which are NADPH dependent enzymes. Metabolic<br>
stability of compounds can be determined in vitro with the use of subcellular human tissue (see example C.5). Here metabolic stability of the compounds is expressed as % of drug metabolised after 15 minutes incubation of these compounds with microsomes. Quantitation of the compounds was determined by LC-MS analysis.<br>
The tumour suppressor p53 transcriptionally activates a number of genes including the WAF1/CIP1 gene in response to DNA damage. The 21 kDa product of the WAF1 gene is found in a complex involving cyclins, cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in normal cells but not transformed cells and appears to be a universal inhibitor of CDK activity. One consequence of p21WAFl binding to and inhibiting CDKs is to prevent CDK-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent inactivation of the Rb protein, which is essential for cell cycle progression. Induction of p21WAFl in response to cellular contact with a HDAC inhibitor is therefore a potent and specific indicator of inhibition of cell cycle progression at both the Gl and G2 checkpoints.<br>
The capacity of the compounds to induce p21WAFl was measured with the p21WAFl enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (WAF1 ELISA of Oncogene). The p21WAFl assay is a "sandwich" enzyme immunoassay employing both mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies. A rabbit polyclonal antibody, specific for the human WAF1 protein, has been immobilized onto the surface of the plastic wells provided in the kit. Any p21WAF present in the sample to be assayed will bind to the capture antibody. The biotinylated detector monoclonal antibody also recognizes human p21WAFl protein, and will bind to any p21WAFl, which has been retained by the capture antibody. The detector antibody, in turn, is bond by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. The horseradish peroxidase catalyses the conversion of the chromogenic substrate tetra-methylbenzidine from a colorless solution to a blue solution (or yellow after the addition of stopping reagent), the intensity of which is proportional to the amount of p21WAFl protein bond to the plate. The colored reaction product is quantified using a spectrophotometer. Quantitation is achieved by the construction of a standard curve using known concentrations of p21WAFl (provided lyophilised)(see example C.6).<br>
Specific HDAC inhibitors should not inhibit other enzymes like the abundant CYP P450 proteins. The CYP P450 (E.coli expressed) proteins 3A4, 2D6 en 2C9 convert their specific substrates into a fluorescent molecule. The CYP3A4 protein converts 7-benzyloxy-trifluoromethyl coumarin (BFC) into 7-hydroxy-trifluoromethyl coumarin. The CYP2D6 protein converts 3-[2-(N,N-diethyl-N-methylamino)ethyl]-7-methoxy-4-methylcoumarin (AMMC) into 3-[2-(N,N-diethylamino)ethyl]-7-hydroxy-4-<br>
methylcoumarin hydrochloride and the CYP2C9 protein converts 7-Methoxy-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (MFC) into 7-hydroxy-trifluoromethyl coumarin. Compounds inhibiting the enzymatic reaction will result in a decrease of fluoresent signal (see example C.7).<br>
Example C.I: In Vitro Assay for Inhibition of histone deacetvlase;<br>
HeLa nuclear extracts (supplier: Biomol) were incubated at 60 u,g/ml with 2xlO"8 M of radiolabeled peptide substrate. As a substrate for measuring HDAC activity a synthetic peptide, i.e. the amino acids 14-21 of histone H4, was used. The substrate is biotinylated at the NH2-terminal part with a 6-aminohexanoic acid spacer, and is protected at the COOH-terminal part by an amide group and specifically [3H]acetylated at lysine 16. The substrate, biotin-(6-aminohexanoic)Gly-Ala-([3H]-acetyl-Lys-Arg-His-Arg-Lys-Val-NHy, was added in a buffer containing 25 mM Hepes, 1 M sucrose, 0.1 mg/ml BSA and 0.01% Triton X-100 at pH 7.4. After 30 min the deacetylation reaction was terminated by the addition of HC1 and acetic acid, (final concentration 0.035 mM and 3.8 mM respectively). After stopping the reaction, the free 3H-acetate was extracted with ethylacetate. After mixing and centrifugation, the radioactivity in an aliquot of the upper (organic) phase was counted in a ^-counter. For each experiment, controls (containing HeLa nuclear extract and DMSO without compound), a blank incubation (containing DMSO but no HeLa nuclear extract or compound) and samples (containing compound dissolved in DMSO and HeLa nuclear extract) were run in parallel. In first instance, compounds were tested at a concentration of 10"5M. When the compounds showed activity at 10"5M, a concentration-response curve was made wherein the compounds were tested at concentrations between 10"5M and 10"12M. In each test the blank value was substracted from both the control and the sample values. The control sample represented 100% of substrate deactylation. For each sample the radioactivity was expressed as a percentage of the mean value of the controls. When appropriate ICso-values (concentration of the drug, needed to reduce the amount of metabolites to 50% of the control) were computed using probit analysis for graded data. Herein the effects of test compounds are expressed as pICso (the negative log value of the ICso-value). All tested compounds showed enzymatic activity at a test concentration of 10'5M and 42 compounds had a pICso &gt; 5 (see table F-2).<br>
Example C.2: Determination of antiproliferative activity on A2780 cells<br>
All compounds tested were dissolved in DMSO and further dilutions were made in culture medium. Final DMSO concentrations never exceeded 0.1 % (v/v) in cell<br>
proliferation assays. Controls contained A2780 cells and DMSO without compound and blanks contained DMSO but no cells. MTT was dissolved at 5 mg/ml in PBS. A glycine buffer comprised of 0.1 M glycine and 0.1 M NaCl buffered to pH 10.5 with NaOH (1 N) was prepared (all reagents were from Merck).<br>
The human A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells (a kind gift from Dr. T.C. Hamilton (Fox Chase Cancer Centre, Pennsylvania, USA]) were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 /ig/ml gentamicin and 10 % fetal calf serum. Cells were routinely kept as monolayer cultures at 37°C in a humidified 5 % CO2 atmosphere. Cells were passaged once a week using a trypsin/EDTA solution at a split ratio of 1:40. All media and supplements were obtained from Life Technologies. Cells were free of mycoplasma contamination as determined using the Gen-Probe Mycoplasma Tissue Culture kit (supplier: BioMerieux).<br>
Cells were seeded in NUNC™ 96-well culture plates (Supplier: Life Technologies) and allowed to adhere to the plastic overnight. Densities used for plating were 1500 cells per well in a total volume of 200 fil medium. After cell adhesion to the plates, medium was changed and drugs and/or solvents were added to a final volume of 200 p.1. Following four days of incubation, medium was replaced by 200 n\ fresh medium and cell density and viability was assessed using an MTT-based assay. To each well, 25 \t\ MTT solution was added and the cells were further incubated for 2 hours at 37°C. The medium was then carefully aspirated and the blue MTT-formazan product was solubilized by addition of 25 /il glycine buffer followed by 100 n\ of DMSO. The microtest plates were shaken for 10 min on a microplate shaker and the absorbance at 540 nm was measured using an Emax 96-well spectrophotometer (Supplier: Sopachem). Within an experiment, the results for each experimental condition are the mean of 3 replicate wells. For initial screening purposes, compounds were tested at a single fixed concentration of 10"6 M. For active compounds, the experiments were repeated to establish full concentration-response curves. For each experiment, controls (containing no drug) and a blank incubation (containing no cells or drugs) were run in parallel. The blank value was subtracted from all control and sample values. For each sample, the mean value for cell growth (in absorbance units) was expressed as a percentage of the mean value for cell growth of the control. When appropriate, ICso-values (concentration of the drug, needed to reduce cell growth to 50% of the control) were computed using probit analysis for graded data (Finney, D.J., Probit Analyses, 2nd Ed. Chapter 10, Graded Responses, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1962). Herein the effects of test compounds are expressed as pICso (the negative log value of the ICso-value). Most of the tested compounds showed cellular activity at a test concentration of 10"6 M and 41 compounds had a pICso £ 5 (see table F-2)Example C.3: Kinetic solubility in aqueous media<br>
In the first dilution step, 10 \i\ of a concentrated stock-solution of the active compound, solubilized in DMSO (5mM), was added to 100 jil phosphate citrate bufferpH 7.4 and mixed. In the second dilution step, an aliquot (20 ul) of the first dilution step was further dispensed in 100 |il phosphate citrate buffer pH 7.4 and mixed. Finally, in the third dilution step, a sample (20 ul) of the second dilution step was further diluted in 100 ul phosphate citrate buffer pH 7.4 and mixed. All dilutions were performed in 96-well plates. Immediately after the last dilution step the turbidity of the three consecutive dilution steps were measured with a nephelometer. Dilution was done in triplicate for each compound to exclude occasional errors. Based on the turbidity measurements a ranking is performed into 3 classes. Compounds with high solubility obtained a score of 3 and for this compounds the first dilution is clear. Compounds with medium solubility obtained a score of 2. For these compounds the first dilution is unclear and the second dilution is clear. Compounds with low solubility obtained a score of 1 and for these compounds both the first and the second dilution are unclear. The solubility of 9 compounds was measured. From these compounds 4 showed a score of 3, one obtained a score of 2 and 4 demonstrated a score of 1 (see table F-2).<br>
Example C.4: Parallel artificial membrane permeability analysis<br>
The stock samples (aliquots of 10 uj of a stock solution of 5 mM in 100 % DMSO) were diluted in a deep-well or Pre-mix plate containing 2 ml of an aqueous buffer system pH 4 or pH 7.4 (PSR4 System Solution Concentrate (pION)). Before samples were added to the reference plate, 150 |il of buffer was added to wells and a blank UV-measurement was performed. Thereafter the buffer was discarded and the plate was used as reference plate. All measurements were done in UV-resistant plates (supplier: Costar or Greiner).<br>
After the blank measurement of the reference plate, 150 uj of the diluted samples was added to the reference plate and 200 ul of the diluted samples was added to donorplate 1. An acceptor filter plate 1 (supplier: Millipore, type:MAIP N45) was coated with 4 jil of the artificial membrane-forming solution (l,2-Dioleoyl-sn-Glycer-3-Phosphocholine in Dodecane containing 0.1% 2,6-Di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol and placed on top of donor plate 1 to form a "sandwich". Buffer (200 uj) was dispensed into the acceptor wells on the top. The sandwich was covered with a lid and stored for 18h at room temperature in the dark.<br>
A blank measurement of acceptor plate 2 was performed through the addition of 150 uj of buffer to the wells, followed by an UV-measurement. After the blank measurement<br>
of acceptor plate 2 the buffer was discarded and 150 uj of acceptor solution was transferred from the acceptor filter plate 1 to the acceptor plate 2. Then the acceptor filter plate 1 was removed form the sandwich. After the blank measurement of donor plate 2 (see above), 150 |al of the donor solution was transferred from donor plate 1 to donor plate 2. The UV spectra of the donor plate 2, acceptor plate 2 and reference plate wells were scanned (with a SpectraMAX 190). All the spectra were processed to calculate permeability with the PSR4p Command Software. All compounds were measured in triplo. Carbamazepine, griseofulvin, acycloguanisine, atenolol, furosemide, and chlorothiazide were used as standards in each experiment. Compounds were ranked in 3 categories as having a low permeability (mean effect  mean effect &gt; 0.5 x 10"6 cm/s; score 2) or a high permeability (&gt; 0.5 x 10"6 cm/s; score 3). Two of the 7 tested compounds showed at least a score of 2 at one of the pH's measured and 5 compounds showed only a score of 1 at one of the pH's measured.<br>
Example C.5: Metabolic stability<br>
Sub-cellular tissue preparations were made according to Gorrod et al. (Xenobiotica 5:<br>
453-462, 1975) by centrifugal separation after mechanical homogenization of tissue.<br>
Liver tissue was rinsed in ice-cold 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer to wash excess<br>
blood. Tissue was then blotted dry, weighed and chopped coarsely using surgical<br>
scissors. The tissue pieces were homogenized in 3 volumes of ice-cold 0.1 M phosphate<br>
buffer (pH 7.4) using either a Potter-S (Braun, Italy) equipped with a Teflon pestle or a<br>
Sorvall Omni-Mix homogeniser, for 7 x 10 sec. In both cases, the vessel was kept in/on<br>
ice during the homogenization process.<br>
Tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 9000 x g for 20 minutes at 4 °C using a Sorvall<br>
centrifuge or Beckman Ultracentrifuge. The resulting supernatant was stored at -80 °C<br>
and is designated 'S9'.<br>
The S9 fraction can be further centrifuged at 100.000 x g for 60 minutes (4 °C) using a<br>
Beckman ultracentrifuge. The resulting supernatant was carefully aspirated, aliquoted<br>
and designated 'cytosol'. The pellet was re-suspended in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH<br>
7.4) in a final volume of 1 ml per 0.5 g original tissue weight and designated<br>
'microsomes'.<br>
All sub-cellular fractions were aliquoted, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and<br>
stored at -80 °C until use.<br>
For the samples to be tested, the incubation mixture contained PBS (0.1M), compound<br>
(5 u.M), microsomes (Img/ml) and a NADPH-generating system (0.8 mM glucose-6-<br>
phosphate, 0.8 mM magnesium chloride and 0.8 Units of glucose-6-phosphate<br>
dehydrogenase). Control samples contained the same material but the microsomes were replaced by heat inactivated (10 min at 95 degrees Celsius) microsomes. Recovery of the compounds in the control samples was always 100%. The mixtures were preincubated for 5 min at 37 degrees Celsius. The reaction was started at timepoint zero (t = 0) by addition of 0.8 mM NADP and the samples were incubated for 15 min (t = 15). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 volumes of DMSO. Then the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 900 x g and the supematants were stored at room temperature for no longer as 24 h before analysis. All incubations were performed in duplo. Analysis of the supematants was performed with LC-MS analysis. Elution of the samples was performed on a Xterra MS CIS (50 x 4.6 mm, 5 ujn, Waters, US). An Alliance 2790 (Supplier: Waters, US) HPLC system was used. Elution was with buffer A (25 mM ammoniumacetate (pH 5.2) in H2O/acetonitrile (95/5)), solvent B being acetonitrile and solvent C methanol at a flow rate of 2.4 ml/min. The gradient employed was increasing the organic phase concentration from 0 % over 50 % B and 50 % C in 5 min up to 100 % B in 1 min in a linear fashion and organic phase concentration was kept stationary for an additional 1.5 min. Total injection volume of the samples was 25 uj.<br>

Example C.6: p21 induction capacity<br>
The following protocol has been applied to determine the p21 protein expression level in human A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells. The A2780 cells (20000 cells II80 uJ) were seeded in 96 microwell plates in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 ^g/ml gentamicin and 10 % fetal calf serum. 24 hours before the lysis of the cells, compounds were added at final concentrations of 10"5,10"6,10"7 and 10"8 M. All compounds tested were dissolved in DMSO and further dilutions were made in culture medium. 24 hours after the addition of the compound, the supematants were removed from the cells. Cells were washed with 200 fil ice-cold PBS. The wells were aspirated and 30 uJ of lysisbuffer (50 mM Tris.HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 1 % Nonidet p40 and 10 % glycerol) was added. The plates were incubated overnight at -70 °C.<br>
The appropriate number of microtiter wells were removed from the foil pouch and placed into an empty well holder. A working solution (Ix) of the Wash Buffer (20x plate wash concentrate: 100 ml 20-fold concentrated solution of PBS and surfactant. Contains 2 % chloroacetamide) was prepared. The lyophilised p21WAF standard was reconstituted with distilled KbO and further diluted with sample diluent (provided in the kit)<br>
The samples were prepared by diluting them 1:4 in sample diluent. The samples (100 Hi) and the p21WAFl standards (100 uJ) were pipetted into the appropriate wells and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. The wells were washed 3 times with Ix wash buffer and then 100 uJ of detector antibody reagent (a solution of biotinylated monoclonal p21WAFl antibody) was pipetted into each well. The wells were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour and then washed three times with Ix wash buffer. The 400x conjugate (peroxidase streptavidine conjugate: 400-fold concentrated solution) was diluted and 100 fil of the Ix solution was added to the wells. The wells were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then washed 3 times with Ix wash buffer and 1 time with distilled F^O. Substrate solution (chromogenic substrate)(100 ul) was added to the wells and the wells were incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature. Stop solution was added to each well in the same order as the previously added substrate solution. The absorbance in each well was measured using a spectrophotometric plate reader at dual wavelengths of 450/595 nm.<br>
For each experiment, controls (containing no drug) and a blank incubation (containing no cells or drugs) were run in parallel. The blank value was substracted from all control and sample values. For each sample, the value for p21WAFl induction (in absorbance units) was expressed as the percentage of the value for p21WAFl present in the control. Percentage induction higher than 130 % was defined as significant induction. Thirteen compounds were tested in this assay. Eleven compounds showed significant induction.<br>
Example C.7: P450 inhibiting capacity<br>
All compounds tested were dissolved in DMSO (5 mM) and a further dilution to 5 10"4 M was made in acetonitrile. Further dilutions were made in assay buffer (0.1M NaK phosphate buffer pH 7.4) and the final solvent concentration was never higher than 2 %.<br>

After an incubation of 30 minutes at room temperature the reaction was terminated after addition of 2 volumes of acetonitrile. Fluorescent determinations were carried out at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and an emission wavelength of 535 nm. Ketoconazole (ICso-value = 3 X 10~8M) was included as reference compound in this experiment. The assay for the CYP2D6 protein comprises per well 6 pmol P450/mg protein (in 0.01M NaKphosphate buffer + 1.15% KC1), an NADPH generating system (0.41 mM Glucose-6-phosphate, 0.4 U/ml Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.0082 mM NADP and 0.41 mM MgCl2.6H2O in assay buffer) and compound in a total assay volume of 100 uJ. After a 5 min pre-incubation at 37 °C the enzymatic reaction was started with the addition of 3 uM of the fluoresent probe substrate AMMC in assay buffer. After an incubation of 45 minutes at room temperature the reaction was terminated after addition of 2 volumes of acetonitrile. Fluorescent determinations were carried out at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Quinidine (ICso-value 
The assay for the CYP2C9 protein comprises per well 15 pmol P450/mg protein (in 0.01M NaKphosphate buffer + 1.15% KC1), an NADPH generating system (3.3 mM Glucose-6-phosphate, 0.4 U/ml Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 1.3 mM NADP<br>
and 3.3 mM MgCb^HaO in assay buffer) and compound in a total assay volume of 100 ul. After a 5 min pre-incubation at 37 °C the enzymatic reaction was started with the addition of 200 \iM of the fluoresent probe substrate MFC in assay buffer. After an incubation of 30 minutes at room temperature the reaction was terminated after addition of 2 volumes of acetonitrile. Fluorescent determinations were carried out at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and an emission wavelength of 535 nm. Sulfaphenazole (ICso-value = 6.8 X 10"7M) was included as reference compound in this experiment.<br>
For initial screening purposes, compounds were tested at a single fixed concentration of 1 X 10"6 M. For active compounds, the experiments were repeated to establish full concentration-response curves. For each experiment, controls (containing no drug) and a blank incubation (containing no enzyme or drugs) were run in parallel. All compounds were assayed in quadruplicate. The blank value was subtracted from all control and sample values. For each sample, the mean value of P450 activity of the sample (in relative fluorescence units) was expressed as a percentage of the mean value of P450 activity of the control. Percentage inhibition was expressed as 100% minus the mean value of P450 activity of the sample. When appropriate, ICso-values (concentration of the drug, needed to reduce P450 activity to 50% of the control) were calculated. One compound was analysed in this assay. No inhibition of the different P450 enzymes could be detected with this compound.<br>
