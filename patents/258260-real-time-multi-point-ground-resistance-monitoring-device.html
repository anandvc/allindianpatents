BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention generally relates to ground resistance<br>
monitoring devices, and more particularly to a ground resistance monitoring<br>
device capable of monitoring ground resistances of multiple work stations<br>
simultaneously in real time.<br>
2.	The Prior Arts<br>
Grounding is often considered an extremely important issue in<br>
preventing electrostatic hazard. However, despite the technology advances,<br>
achieving a reliable and effective grounding still seems a difficult job.<br>
Accidents due to improper grounding are still quite often, even for high-tech<br>
manufacturers. Electrostatics, if not treated seriously and cautiously, could<br>
cause severe property loss and human lives too.<br>
In a conventional work place, there are usually multiple assembly<br>
lines each containing a number of assembly stations or machines. To prevent<br>
the electrostatics carried by the operators working in these assembly lines from<br>
damaging the products in production, the operators are usually required to wear<br>
electrostatic-proof clothes, shoes, and/or wrist strap, and the floor and the table<br>
surface are usually covered with floor mats or table mats to prevent the<br>
accumulation of electrostatics. As shown in FIG. 1a, the floor mat 10, the<br>
table mat 20 and the wrist strap (not shown) are usually connected to a common<br>
point ground 30 in an assembly station. The common point ground 30 is<br>
usually a metallic plate or wire set up at a fixed location in the assembly station.<br>
As shown in FIG. lb, the common point grounds 30 of the assembly<br>
stations in an assembly line are series-connected by a conductive wire 40, and<br>
the conductive wires 40 of separate assembly lines are jointed together or<br>
separately connected to either an equipment ground or an earth ground<br>
(independent of the equipment ground).<br><br>
The equipment ground is usually the ground provided by the ground<br>
wire of the AC (alternate current) mains. When a building is constructed, one<br>
or more ground bars are hammered into the ground to form a ground net 70.<br>
The ground wire of the AC mains is then connected to the ground net 70. The<br>
ground of the AC mains is then branched to the power outlets through the panel<br>
box 50 at each floor and a major panel box 60 of the building. The earth<br>
ground is usually connected to an additional and independent ground bar or<br>
ground net. In either way, electrostatics carried by or accumulated on the<br>
operators are conducted to earth through the wrist straps, the table mats, the<br>
floor mats, to the common point grounds in assembly stations, and then to the<br>
equipment ground of the building or the independent earth ground, so as to<br>
prevent potential electrostatic hazard.<br>
The foregoing grounding structure is also commonly found in<br>
production lines with a number of working machines, such as the surface<br>
mounting machines, and these working machines are usually connected to the<br>
equipment ground through their power cables respectively. Besides assembly<br>
lines, the service islands of a gas station have a similar environment. Each<br>
service island has a number of gasoline pumps each of which has several hoses<br>
to provide different kinds of gasoline. The nozzles of the hoses are connected<br>
to a conductive wire of the gasoline pump, and the conductive wires of the<br>
gasoline pumps of a service island is series-connected to a ground bar or a<br>
ground net of the gas station.<br>
For assembly lines, production lines, service islands, or any other<br>
similar working environments, they all contain a number of work stations<br>
(hereinafter, the term is used to refer to assembly stations, machines, gasoline<br>
pumps, or any other similar spots requiring appropriate grounding) which<br>
should be properly grounded to prevent electrostatic hazard. However, it is<br>
quite often that these ground bars or ground nets are rust-eaten to provide<br>
proper grounding, or the panel boxes are not connected to the ground bar or<br>
ground net for some reason, or the conductive wires are broken. All these<br>
would cause one or more work stations to have inadequate grounding and<br><br>
therefore the electrostatics start to accumulate on the operators which will<br>
damage the product under production or even the expensive machines.<br>
Conventionally, a common approach to the problem is to conduct<br>
periodic manual examination of the grounding of each work station. One<br>
manual examination method is the so-called three-point-grounding method by a<br>
specialized ground resistance measurement equipment.	The<br>
three-point-grounding method is to connect two test leads of the equipment to<br>
two existing ground bars and then connect a third test lead of the equipment to<br>
the ground bar or ground net under test. As can be imagined, this method<br>
requires quite some effort and time, and only applicable to a limited number of<br>
environments. For ground points indoors or at higher floor locations, this<br>
method is not adequate. Moreover, this kind of periodic examination still<br>
cannot detect and resolve grounding problems happening during the window<br>
between two examinations.<br>
There are quite a few other approaches proposed in the related arts.<br>
For example, a wrist strap disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,623,255 would siren<br>
when it is disconnected from the common point ground. However, whether the<br>
common point ground indeed provides adequate grounding is still unknown.<br>
A monitoring device disclosed in R.O.C. (Taiwan) Patent No. 448,414 can<br>
automatically monitor and issue alarm when detecting abnormal grounding for<br>
a single ground point. To monitor multiple grounding points, multiple devices<br>
have to be prepared which is too costly and, on the other hand, lacks the<br>
convenience of centralized management.<br>
Additionally, the existing techniques usually require a ground that is<br>
known to be appropriate as a reference. To locate and make sure the reference<br>
ground is indeed appropriate, the foregoing methods such as the<br>
three-point-grounding method has to be used, which adds a lot of trouble in<br>
setting up the monitoring devices. What is even more bothersome is that<br>
whether the reference ground remains effective may be an issue by itself and<br>
therefore may require periodic examination as well.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a real-time multi-point ground<br>
resistance monitoring device which can simultaneously monitor ground<br>
resistances of multiple work stations in real time.<br>
A major feature of the present invention is to conduct the ground<br>
resistance measurement and monitoring by establishing a path through the earth<br>
between the ground point being monitored and the ground of the ubiquitous AC<br>
mains<br>
Another major feature of the present invention is that the reference<br>
ground provided by the AC mains can be easily and conveniently examined<br>
without requiring expensive test equipments and/or the conduction of<br>
demanding test methods.<br>
Yet another major feature of the present invention is that the device<br>
can be calibrated to automatically offset the wire resistance when the<br>
connecting wire to the ground point being monitored is extended too long so as<br>
to achieve accurate measurements.<br>
The real-time multi-point ground resistance monitoring device of<br>
the present invention contains a number of monitoring ports, each separately<br>
parallel-connected to the common point ground, equipment ground, or other<br>
appropriate ground of a work station trough a conductive wire. Each<br>
monitoring port can be configured with a specific safety range of acceptable<br>
ground resistances, and how to issue alarm when the measurement result<br>
exceeds the safety range. In addition, as the conductive wire can be extended<br>
for a considerable distance, each monitoring port has a self-correction function<br>
to offset the influence of the wire resistance of the extended conductive wire to<br>
the measurement result. The real-time multi-point ground resistance monitoring<br>
device also provides a network interface permitting remote users to monitor the<br>
ground resistances of multiple work stations through a network.<br>
The real-time multi-point ground resistance monitoring device<br>
contains a processing unit, a display and operation unit, a testing and power<br><br>
supply unit, and a measurement unit. The processing unit is the brain of the<br>
device which has two-way connections to the other units for data exchange. The<br>
display and operation unit is the man-machine interface for setting up<br>
parameters, presenting measurement results, and delivering alarms. The<br>
testing and power supply unit connects to an external AC mains, converts the<br>
AC power to appropriate voltages to drive the other units, and provides the<br>
ground of AC mains as a reference to the measurement unit for measuring the<br>
ground resistance at each monitoring port. To ensure the correctness of the<br>
measurements, another major function of the testing and power supply unit is to<br>
make sure that the AC mains has proper grounding and to obtain the ground<br>
resistance of the AC mains. The measurement unit, under the control of the<br>
processing unit, periodically measures the ground resistance at each monitoring<br>
port and passes the measurement results to the processing unit. The<br>
processing unit then compares the measurement results against their<br>
corresponding safety ranges and issues an alarm through the display and<br>
operation unit when an exceptional condition has been detected.<br>
The real-time multi-point ground resistance monitoring device can<br>
further contains a network interface unit which network-enables the<br>
man-machine interface of the display and operation unit in the form of web<br>
pages or similar interface to authorized users accessing the monitoring device<br>
through a network, and therefore allows authorized users to set up device<br>
parameters or monitor measurement results through the network. Similarly,<br>
alarms from the processing unit can also be presented in the web pages or<br>
passed to specific users in appropriate manners.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
FIG. 2a is a schematic view showing the environment where a<br>
monitoring device according to the present invention functions. As shown in<br>
FIG. 2a, a real-time multi-point ground resistance monitoring device 100 of the<br>
present invention is an independent device connecting to an AC mains 200<br>
(usually a wall outlet providing 110V or 220V AC power) to extract the<br>
required power and utilizes the ground of the AC mains to establish an<br>
electrical path (more details will be given later). The monitoring device 100<br>
parallel-connects to multiple ground points 400 through conductive wires 300<br>
respectively to measure the ground resistances of the ground points 400. Each<br>
ground point 400 is a common point ground, an equipment ground, or other<br>
ground point requiring monitoring. As shown in FIG. 2a, the monitoring<br>
device 100 can further connect to a network 500 to provide remote operation<br>
and monitoring. The network 500 is an abstraction of any appropriate network.<br><br>
For example, it can be a wired or wireless local area network (LAN), a<br>
proprietary wide area network (WAN) or the Internet via a wired or wireless<br>
LAN, or a mobile data network (such as a 2.5G or 3G mobile communications<br>
network).<br>
FIG. 2b is a functional block diagram showing an embodiment of<br>
the real-time multi-point ground resistance monitoring device of the present<br>
invention. As shown in FIG. 2b, the real-time multi-point ground resistance<br>
monitoring device 100 mainly contains a processing unit 110, a display and<br>
operation unit 120, a testing and power supply unit 130, and a measurement<br>
unit 140. Among them, the display and operation unit 120 is the main<br>
man-machine interface of the monitoring device 100. FIG. 2c is a schematic<br>
view showing an embodiment of the display and operation unit 120 of the<br>
present invention. As shown in FIG. 2c, the display and operation unit 120<br>
contains a display 121 and a keypad 122 on the enclosure of the monitoring<br>
device 100, allowing a user to set up device parameters and to view<br>
measurement results. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2c, the display 121<br>
presents measurement results of multiple monitoring ports of the monitoring<br>
device 100 with "0"as normal and "X" as abnormal. Please note that the<br>
embodiment shown in FIG. 2c is only exemplary, and the present invention is<br>
not limited to the embodiment shown in FIG. 2c only. The display and<br>
operation unit 120 can further contain other control and display means, such as<br>
flash lights, a buzzer, or a speaker to alarm the user when the monitoring device<br>
100 detects some abnormal condition. The display and operation unit 120 can<br>
also contain an electrical or mechanical relay to trigger the operation of some<br>
external device.<br>
The display and operation unit 120 is driven by the processing unit<br>
110 through a connection therebetween. Through the connection, the display<br>
and operation unit 120 passes command inputted by the user back to the<br>
processing unit 110. The processing unit 110 is the core responsible for<br>
processing and computing data for the monitoring device 100, which has an<br>
ordinary computing structure including a processor, read-only memory, random<br><br>
access memory (RAM), input-output controllers, real-time clock, and buses, etc.<br>
The processing unit 110 has two-way connections with all other units to<br>
exchange data with each other. These details should be familiar to those<br>
skilled in the related arts and are omitted for simplicity.<br>
The measurement unit 140 contains more or more monitoring ports<br>
141 and a control interface 142. Each monitoring port 141 connects to a<br>
ground point 400 to be monitored (hereinafter, the test ground point) through a<br>
conductive wire 300. In turn, these monitoring ports 141 are connected to the<br>
control interface 142. The processing unit 110 periodically measures each test<br>
ground point 400 through the control interface 142. FIG. 2d is a schematic<br>
view showing how a test ground point is measured by the monitoring device of<br>
FIG. 2b. As shown in FIG. 2d, the processing unit 110 of FIG. 2b activates the<br>
control interface 142 to choose a specific monitoring port 141, and to connect<br>
the monitoring port 141 to an appropriate voltage source 133 provided by the<br>
testing and power supply unit 130 to form a electrical path from the voltage<br>
source 133, through the conductive wire 300, to the test ground point 400, and<br>
back to the voltage source 133 via the earth. The resistance of the entire path<br>
is: R203 (ground resistance of the AC mains 200) +R300 (resistance of the<br>
conductive wire 300) +R400 (ground resistance of the test ground point 400).<br>
Whenever the test ground point 400 doesn't have proper grounding, this implies<br>
that the electrical path does not exist or the path has extremely large resistance.<br>
The measurement result obtained by the processing unit 110 therefore will have<br>
a very high vale and the conclusion that the test ground point 400 doesn't have<br>
proper grounding can be derived.<br>
It can be seen from FIG. 2d that, if R30o (resistance of the conductive<br>
wire 300) is very large, the processing unit 110 may reach a misjudgment.<br>
The present invention therefore provides each monitoring port 141 with a<br>
self-correction function whose proper operation requires an accurate estimation<br>
of R300 (resistance of the conductive wire 300) in advance. FIG. 2e is a<br>
schematic view showing how the resistance of a conductive wire is estimated<br>
by the monitoring device of FIG.2b.<br><br>
Before going into the details about the estimation of the wire<br>
resistance, it has to be pointed out that the monitoring device 100 of the present<br>
invention contains a second ground port 132. In a special calibration mode of<br>
the monitoring device 100, the monitoring device 100 measures a test ground<br>
point through the second ground port 132, instead of through the ground of AC<br>
mains. The purpose of having the second ground port 132 is mainly that an<br>
existing known proper ground other than the one of the AC mains can be used<br>
for the multi-point ground resistance monitoring. Another purpose of having<br>
the second ground port 132 is then for the estimation of wire resistance as<br>
described here. In this special calibration mode, the monitoring device 100<br>
connects another conductive wire 301 having substantially identical length and<br>
of substantial identical material with the conductive wire 300 to the same test<br>
ground point 400 through the second ground port 132 to form an electrical path.<br>
The resistance of the entire path is therefore: R30i (resistance of the conductive<br>
wire 301) +R300 (resistance of the conductive wire 300). Because the conductive<br>
wire 301 is substantially identical with the conductive wire 300, the processing<br>
unit 110 can simply divide the measurement result by two to obtain a rather<br>
accurate estimation of R300.<br>
The processing unit 110 keeps three parameters in a non-violate<br>
memory for each monitoring port 141: the resistance of the conductive wire<br>
connected to the monitoring port 141 whose default is zero, the minimum and<br>
maximum acceptable ground resistances of the test ground point 400 monitored<br>
through the monitoring port 141 (i.e., the safety range). The resistance of the<br>
conductive wire 300 is usually very small value and can be ignored (therefore,<br>
is default to be zero in the non-violate memory). However, if the conductive<br>
wire 300 is very long and has a large wire resistance to influence measurement<br>
result, the resistance of the conductive wire 300 has to be estimated through the<br>
foregoing calibration mode. The estimated wire resistance value is then<br>
entered by the user, or automatically recorded by the processing unit 110 into<br>
the non-violated memory. The wire resistance is then deducted by the<br>
processing unit 110 from its measurement result during the normal monitoring<br><br>
process. The processing unit 110 then compares the corrected measurement<br>
result against the safety range of the monitoring port 141 and issues an alarm<br>
when the measurement result exceeds the safety range.<br>
The testing and power supply unit 130 connects separately to the<br>
neutral lead 201, power lead 202, and ground lead 203 of the AC mains 200.<br>
From the power lead 202, the testing and power supply unit 130 extracts,<br>
regulates, and rectifies the AC power, and then provides appropriate voltages to<br>
the other units. The testing and power supply unit 130 itself contains a testing<br>
member 131 to examine the grounding of the AC mains 200 to see if it is proper,<br>
and to obtain the ground resistance of the AC mains (i.e., the aforementioned<br>
R2o3). FIG. 2f is a schematic view showing an embodiment of the testing<br>
member 131 of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 2f, the testing<br>
member 131 mainly contains a loading element 1311 and a switch 1313. The<br>
loading element 1311 in turn contains a resistor 1312 having a very large<br>
resistance, and a resistor array (not numbered) parallel-connected to the resistor<br>
1312. In the embodiment as shown in FIG. 2f, the resistor array is provided<br>
with four resistors having different resistances respectively, which include<br>
(i.e., open circuit), lMft, 5.6Kft, and 200ft selected by an additional multi-step<br>
switch (not numbered) in the loading element 1311. Based on this design and<br>
the following table, the grounding condition of the AC mains 200 can be easily<br>
determined by observing whether current is conducted through the ground lead<br>
203 via each of these resistors selected by the multi-step switch (under the<br>
control of the processing unit 110):<br><br><br><br>
If the AC mains 200 has a proper grounding, there will always be<br>
current flowing through the ground lead 203 regardless of the resistor selected<br>
(as if the question mark in the drawing is a close circuit). Inversely, if the AC<br>
mains 200 has no grounding at all, there will always be no current flowing<br>
through the ground lead 203 regardless of the resistor selected (as if the<br>
question mark in the drawing is an open circuit). On the other hand, false<br>
grounding is a special case where it can discharge a small current but fails to do<br>
so for a large current. Therefore, when a resistor of a smaller resistance is<br>
selected such as the 5.6KQ or 200Q one, a very large current is supposed to<br>
occur but the false grounding of the ground lead 203 is unable to absorb it. On<br>
the other hand, when a resistor of a very large resistance such as the or 1MQ<br>
one, a small current is induced and can be discharged successfully through the<br>
false grounding of the ground lead 203.<br>
Based on these principles, the processing unit 110 can automatically<br>
switch the resistors and observe the conduction condition of the ground lead<br>
203 to determine whether the AC mains 200 has a proper grounding. A user<br>
then can be notified of the examination result of the testing member 131 by the<br>
flashing light or buzzer sound of the display and operation unit 120. The user<br>
therefore can be certain whether the AC mains 200 has provided a proper<br>
grounding for the monitoring device 100. It should be mentioned that the<br>
resistors of the loading element 1311 is not limited to the aforementioned<br>
combination of resistance values. Please also note that in the foregoing<br>
process the processing unit 110 can calculate the ground resistance R203 of the<br>
AC mains 200 and the processing unit 110 then records the ground resistance<br>
R.203 in the non-violate memory for deriving the ground resistances of testing<br>
ground points in the periodic monitoring process.<br>
Please note that, in real life, it is not impossible that the power lead<br>
202 and the neutral lead 201 are inversely connected mistakenly (that is, the AC<br><br>
voltage actually arises from the neutral lead 201 instead of from the power lead<br>
202). Therefore, the switch 1313 is provided to allow a user to select whether<br>
to take the power lead 202 or the neutral lead 201 as input. For example, if the<br>
power lead 202 is selected as input and no conduction is detected for all<br>
resistive loads, a user shouldn't jump to a conclusion that the AC mains 200<br>
does not provide a proper grounding. The user should further use the switch<br>
1313 to take the neutral lead 201 as input and examine the conduction condition<br>
of the ground lead 203 again. For example, if conduction is detected for all<br>
resistive loads when using the neutral lead 201 as input, it is obvious that the<br>
power lead 202 and the neutral lead 201 are inversely connected, and the<br>
grounding provided by the AC mains is still acceptable.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2b, the monitoring device 100 can further contain<br>
a network interface unit 150 to deliver the interface of the display and operation<br>
unit 120 in the form of web page or in similar text or graphic interface to<br>
authorized users accessing the monitoring device 100 through a network 500.<br>
Therefore an authorized user is able to set up device parameters or read<br>
measurement results remotely. Similarly, alarms from the processing unit 110<br>
can also be presented to a remote user in this way. The network 500 is an<br>
abstraction of various types of networks, such as a wired or wireless LAN, a<br>
proprietary WAN via a wired or wireless LAN, the Internet, or a mobile data<br>
network (such as a 2.5G or 3G mobile communications network).<br>
Accordingly, the network interface unit 150 should contain a physical port and<br>
support a communication protocol compatible to the network 500. In addition<br>
to passively waiting for user's examination, the network interface unit 150 can<br>
also proactively deliver alarms to one or more specific users via, for example,<br>
electronic mails, short messages, or even direct dialing with simulated or<br>
pre-recorded voice clips.<br>
To use the monitoring device 100, first the monitoring device 100 is<br>
connected to the AC mains 200 (usually a wall outlet) and then a testing mode<br>
of the monitoring device is activated to confirm if the ground lead 203 of the<br>
AC mains 200 is properly grounded and the ground resistance of the AC mains<br><br>
200 is obtained and recorded. If the AC mains 200 has a proper grounding,<br>
then, the conductive wire 300 is used to connect one of the test ground points<br>
400 to one of the monitoring ports 141. If some conductive wires 300 are too<br>
long, the monitoring device 100 can be entered into the foregoing calibration<br>
mode to estimate and record the wire resistance of each conductive wire 300.<br>
Subsequently, the user enters the safety range of each monitoring port 141 and<br>
activates the monitoring device 100 to periodically measure and compare<br>
ground resistance of each test ground point 400 with the safe range and to alarm<br>
when the ground resistance exceeds its corresponding safe range.<br>
If the monitoring device 100 is equipped with the network interface<br>
unit 150, the foregoing process further contains the step of appropriately<br>
connecting the monitoring device 100 to the network 500 and setting up<br>
relevant parameters such as IP (internet protocol) address, mask, and gateway,<br>
etc.<br>
Although the present invention has been described with reference to<br>
the preferred embodiments, it will be understood that the invention is not<br>
limited to the details described thereof. Various substitutions and<br>
modifications have been suggested in the foregoing description, and others will<br>
occur to those of ordinary skill in the art. Therefore, all such substitutions and<br>
modifications are intended to be embraced within the scope of the invention as<br>
defined in the appended claims.<br><br>
