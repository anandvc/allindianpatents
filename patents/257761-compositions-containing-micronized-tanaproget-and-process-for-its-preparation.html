BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Micronized tanaproget and compositions containing the same are provided.<br>
Intracellular receptors (IR) form a class of structurally related gene regulators<br>
known as "ligand dependent transcription factors". The steroid receptor family is a<br>
subset of the IR family, including the progesterone receptor (PR), estrogen receptor<br>
(ER), androgen receptor (AR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and mineralocorticoid<br>
receptor (MR).<br>
The natural hormone, or ligand, for the PR is the steroid progesterone, but<br>
synthetic compounds, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate or levonorgestrel, have<br>
been made which also serve as ligands. Once a ligand is present in the fluid<br>
surrounding a cell, it passes through the cell membrane via passive diffusion, and<br>
binds to the IR to create a receptor/ligand complex. This complex binds to specific<br>
gene promoters present in the cell's DNA. Once bound to the DNA, the complex<br>
modulates the production of mRNA and protein encoded by that gene.<br>
A compound that binds to an IR and mimics the action of the natural hormone<br>
is termed an agonist, whilst a compound which inhibits the effect of the hormone is<br>
an antagonist.<br>
PR agonists (natural and synthetic) are known to play an important role in the<br>
health of women. PR agonists are used in birth control compositions, typically in the<br>
presence of an ER agonist, alternatively they may be used in conjunction with a PR<br>
antagonist. ER agonists are used to treat the symptoms of menopause, but have been<br>
associated with a proliferative effect on the uterus which can lead to an increased risk<br>
of uterine cancers. Co-administration of a PR agonist reduces/ablates that risk.<br>
Tanaproget, 5-(4,4-dimethyl-2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-3,1-benzoazin-6-yl)-1H-<br>
pyrrole-2-carbonitrile, is a progesterone receptor modulator and is effective in<br>
contraception, hormone replacement therapy, and treating carcinomas and<br>
adenocarcinomas, dysfunctional bleeding, uterine leiomyomata, endometriosis, and<br>
polycystic ovary syndrome.<br><br>
What is needed in the art are compositions containing tanaproget for<br>
administration to a mammalian subject.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect, a composition containing micronized tanaproget,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, sodium lauryl sulfate, povidone,<br>
magnesium stearate, and butylated hydroxyanisole is provided.<br>
In another aspect, a process for preparing compositions containing<br>
micronized tanaproget is provided.<br>
In a further aspect, kits including a composition containing micronized<br>
tanaproget are provided.<br>
Other aspects and advantages are described further in the following detailed<br>
description of the preferred embodiments thereof.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Effective pharmaceutical compositions containing micronized tanaproget are<br>
provided. The micronized tanaproget can be readily formulated into an oral dosage<br>
unit, and is particularly well suited for a directly compressible unit. The inventors<br>
have found that tablets or caplets prepared by direct compression of or capsules<br>
containing the micronized tanaproget compositions of the invention exhibited rapid<br>
and complete drug release, as compared to nonmicronized tanaproget. Thus, the<br>
compositions of the invention provide for fast drug release.<br>
Briefly, tanaproget is micronized, in one embodiment under nitrogen and by<br>
means ofconventional micronizing techniques, for example with a Trost or jet mill,<br>
applied to non-micronized tanaproget. One method of preparation of non-micronized<br>
tanaproget is described in US Patent No. 6,436,929, and generally in US Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 2005/0272702, published December 8,2005. However,<br>
the invention is not limited to the method by which the non-micronized tanaproget is<br>
produced.<br>
In another embodiment, non-micronized tanaproget is purified by<br>
recrystallization. In one embodiment, the tanaproget is recrystallized from acetone<br><br>
and water. In a further embodiment, the tanaproget is dissolved in acetone, the<br>
acetone solution heated, water added to the heated acetone solution, and the<br>
acetone/water solution cooled to provide purified tanaproget. This purification<br>
specifically includes dissolving crude tanaproget in acetone and heating the solution<br>
to about 45 to about 51°C. After circulating the heated solution through a carbon<br>
filter for at leas about 4 hours, the filtered solution was concentrated using procedures<br>
known to those of skill in the art. After adding water to the concentrated solution, in<br>
one embodiment at a rate which does not cool the refluxing acetone solution, the<br>
acetone/water solution was cooled to about -6 to about 0°C. In one embodiment, the<br>
acetone/water solution was cooled at a rate of less than about 0.5°C/minute. After<br>
holding the batch at the reduced temperature for at least about 3 hours, the<br>
precipitated, purified tanaproget is collected using filtration. The collected solid is<br>
washed with a water/acetone mixture, in one embodiment washed twice with a 1:1<br>
water/acetone mixture. The washed purified tanaproget was then dried at less than<br>
35°G for about 4 hours. Further drying at less than about 50°C was performed to<br>
remove residual acetone/water as measured by spectroscopic methods.<br>
In one embodiment, rnicronized tanaproget prepared for use has a particle size<br>
of less than about 20 µm, less than about 15 µm, or less than about 10 µm. In a<br>
further embodiment, 90% of the particles were less than or equal to about 20 µm and<br>
50% were less than or equal to about 15 µm or about 10 µm as determined by the<br>
Malvern method, which is readily understood by one of skill in the art.<br>
The rnicronized tanaproget encompasses tautomeric forms of tanaproget and<br>
salts derived from pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable acids, bases, alkali<br>
metals and alkaline earth metals. Also included are derivatives of tanaproget,<br>
includhig, but not limited to, esters, carbamates, sulfates, ethers, oximes, carbonates,<br>
and the like.<br>
Physiologically acceptable acids include those derived from inorganic and<br>
organic acids. A number of inorganic acids are known in the art and include<br>
hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfuric, nitric, and phosphoric acids, among<br>
others. Similarly, a variety of organic acids are known in the art and include, without<br>
limitation, lactic, formic, acetic, fumaric, citric, propionic, oxalic, succinic, glycolic,<br><br>
glucuronic, maleic, furoic, glutamic, benzoic, anthranilic, salicylic, tartaric, malonic,<br>
mallic, phenylacetic, mandelic, embonic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic,<br>
panthenoic, benzenesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, stearic, sulfanilic, alginic, and<br>
galacturonic acids, among others.<br>
Physiologically acceptable bases include those derived from inorganic and<br>
organic bases. A number of inorganic bases.are known in the art and include<br>
aluminum, calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and zinc sulfate or<br>
phosphate compounds, among others. A number of organic bases are known in the<br>
art and include, without limitation, N,N,-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine,<br>
choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, meglumine, and procaine, among others.<br>
Physiologically acceptable alkali salts and alkaline earth metal salts can<br>
include, without limitation, sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium salts in the<br>
form of esters, and carbamates.<br>
These salts, as well as the nonmicronized and micronized tanaproget can be in <br>
the form of esters, carbamates and other conventional "pro-drug" forms, which, when<br>
administered in such form, convert to the active moiety in vivo. In one embodiment,<br>
the prodrugs are esters. See. e.g., B. Testa and J. Caldwell, "Prodrugs Revisited:<br>
The "Ad Hoc" Approach as a Complement to Ligand Design", Medicinal Research<br>
Reviews, 16(3):233-241, ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons (1996).<br>
Micronized tanaproget discussed herein also encompasses "metabolites"<br>
which are unique products formed by processing tanaproget by the cell or patient. In<br>
one embodiment, metabolites are formed in vivo.<br>
In one embodiment, the compositions of the invention were prepared by wet<br>
mixing micronized tanaproget, based upon the total weight of the unit dose, with the<br>
other components of the composition.<br>
As referred to herein below, the term "wt/wt" refers to the weight of one<br>
component based on the total weight of the composition. In one embodiment, this<br>
ratio does not include the weight of the capsule, the weight of any filler utilized in the<br>
capsule, and seal coating, if so utilized.<br><br>
A. Compositions<br>
The compositions are formulated to provide rapid release of tanaproget, while<br>
simultaneously being stable under conditions of storage. In one embodiment, the<br>
composition contains micronized tanaproget, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt<br>
thereof, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), croscarmellose sodium, sodium lauryl<br>
sulfate (SLS), povidone, magnesium stearate, and butylated hydroxyl anisole (BHA),<br>
also known as butylated hydroxyanisole.<br>
In one embodiment, micronized tanaproget is present in the composition of<br>
the invention in an amount from 0.01% wt/wt to 25% wt/wt of the composition. This<br>
amount may be varied, depending upon the amount of micronized tanaproget to be<br>
delivered to a patient. In another embodiment, an overage of tanaproget is'utilized,<br>
e.g., a 5% overage.<br>
The desired therapeutic regimen can be taken into consideration when<br>
formulating a composition of the invention. In one example, micronized tanaproget,<br>
is present in the formulation at about 0.01% wt/wt, based upon the total weight of the<br>
unit dose. In a further example, micronized tanaproget is present in the formulation<br>
at about Q.10% wt/wt based upon the total weight of the unit dose. In another<br>
example, micronized tanaproget is present in the composition at about 1% wt/wt<br>
based upon the total weight of the unit dose. In a further example, micronized<br>
tanaproget is present in the composition at about 5% wt/wt based upon the total<br>
weight of the unit dose. In yet another example, micronized tanaproget is present in<br>
the composition at about 25% wt/wt based upon the total weight of the unit dose.<br>
The composition of the invention also contains microcrystalline cellulose<br>
(MCC). In one embodiment, the MCC amounts to about 65% to about 97% wt/wt, or<br>
about 65% to about 90% wt/wt of the composition, ha one example, the composition<br>
includes about 65% wt/wt of MCC. In a further example, the composition includes<br>
about 85% wt/wt of MCC. In another example, the composition includes about 89%<br>
wt/wt of MCC. In still a further example, the composition includes about 90% wt/wt<br>
of MCC. In yet another example, the composition includes about 97% wt/wt of<br>
MCC.<br><br>
The composition of the invention further includes magnesium stearate and in<br>
one embodiment is present at about 0.25% wt/wt of the composition.<br>
Croscarmellose sodium is also present in the composition of the invention and<br>
in one embodiment is present at about 2 to about 7% wt/wt of the composition. In<br>
one example, the composition includes about 2.4% wt/wt of croscarmellose sodium.<br>
In another example, the composition includes about 6% wt/wt of croscarmellose<br>
sodium.<br>
A further component of the composition is sodium lauryl sulfate, which is<br>
present in one embodiment at about 0.1 to about 3% wt/wt of the composition. In<br>
one example, sodium lauryl sulfate is present at about 2% wt/wt of the composition.<br>
In another example, sodium lauryl sulfate is present at about 0.2% of the<br>
composition.<br>
Still another component of the composition includes povidone, which is<br>
present in one embodiment at about 0.1 to about 2% wt/wt of the composition. In<br>
one example, povidone is present at about 1.5% wt/wt of the composition. In another<br>
example, povidone is present at about 0.16% wt/wt of the composition.<br>
Butylated hydroxyamsole is an optional component of the composition of the<br>
invention and in one embodiment amounts to about 0.10% wt/wt, or about 0.1%<br>
wt/wt, of the composition.<br>
Without limitation as to the method of preparation of a composition of the<br>
invention, an example of a suitable micronized tanaproget composition is provided in<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The compositions of the invention are typically prepared by mixing<br>
micronized tanaproget, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, microcrystalline<br>
cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, sodium lauryl sulfate, povidone, magnesium<br>
stearate, and in one embodiment, butylated hydroxyanisole. In one embodiment, the<br>
composition is prepared by wet mixing the components therein with water. In a<br>
further embodiment, the sodium lauryl sulfate, butylated hydroxyanisole, and<br>
povidone are independently or together combined with water prior to use in the<br>
method of the invention.<br>
Such compositions can be utilized as described herein or combined with<br>
additional excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium,<br>
and/or magnesium stearate, in addition to those excipients described below, for use.<br><br>
The components can also be in extragranular or intragranular forms, as determined<br>
by one of skill in the art and as determined by the requirements of the process.<br>
A variety of apparatuses can be utilized to perform the process of the<br>
invention and includes bags of small, medium, and large sizes, screens of varying<br>
sizes, and blenders, among others.<br>
The process can also include compacting or milling the composition, typically<br>
using compactors and mills selected by one of skill in the art. The mining step is<br>
typically performed on particles of varying sizes, i.e., large particles, powders, and<br>
fine powders to obtain a preferred and more uniform particle size. The milling can<br>
include several separating, recycling, and screening steps to obtain the desired<br>
particle sizes.<br>
Drying is generally performed using a suitable drying instrument selected by<br>
one of skill in the art such as a fluid bed dryer.<br>
In a further embodiment, the compositions are prepared by diluting the<br>
compositions with excipients. Useful excipients for dilution include those set forth<br>
below and preferably include MCC, croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate.<br>
For example, compositions containing lesser amounts of tanaproget are<br>
prepared by diluting compositions containing greater amounts of tanaproget. For<br>
example, compositions containing 0.01 mg, 1 mg, or 5 mg of tanaproget can be<br>
prepared. In one embodiment, a composition of the invention containing 0.01 mg of<br>
tanaproget is prepared by diluting a composition of the invention containing 0.10 mg,<br>
1 mg, 5 mg, or 25 mg of tanaproget. In a further embodiment, a composition of the<br>
invention containing 0.01 mg of tanaproget is prepared by diluting a composition<br>
containing 0.10 mg. In another embodiment, a composition of the invention<br>
containing 1 mg of tanaproget is prepared by diluting a composition containing 5 mg<br>
or 25 mg of tanaproget. In yet a further embodiment, a composition of the invention<br>
containing 5 mg tanaproget is prepared by diluting a composition containing 25 mg<br>
of tanaproget. In one embodiment, the compositions of the invention prepared by<br>
diluting compositions containing higher amounts of tanaproget are diluted with<br>
MCC, croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate.<br><br>
The compositions prepared according to these routes can be encapsulated in a<br>
capsule or compressed into a tablet or caplet, which can optionally be encapsulated in<br>
a capsule. In one embodiment, the capsule is a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose<br>
(hypromellose) capsule.<br>
When compressed into a tablet or caplet, one of skill in the art would readily<br>
be able to select a suitable tablet press for use. However, one example of such a<br>
press includes the Stokes® B2 Tablet Press, among others.<br>
In one embodiment, a tablet prepared is encapsulated in a capsule. In a<br>
further embodiment, the capsule is a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (hypromellose)<br>
capsule. The capsule can be optionally sealed with the tablet therein or a filler can be<br>
added to the capsule containing tablet. In one embodiment, the filler includes MCC,<br>
croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate. In another embodiment, the tablet<br>
is placed in the capsule prior to adding the filler.<br>
If the composition is compressed into a tablet or caplet, the tablets or caplets<br>
can optionally be film-coated. Suitable film-coatings are known to those of skill in<br>
the art. For example, the film-coating can be selected from among suitable polymers<br>
such as hydroxpropyimethylceliulose, ethyl ceiluiose, polyvinyl alcohol, and<br>
combinations thereof. Other suitable film-coatings can be readily selected by one of<br>
skill in the art. In one embodiment, the tablet or caplet is coated with an Opadry®<br>
seal coat. Where applied, the weight percent of the film coat is generally in the range<br>
of 2% wt/wt to 6% wt/wt of the tablet or caplet.<br>
The tablets, caplets, capsules, or tablets-in-capsules containing the<br>
composition release about 86 to about 99% of tanaproget after about 90 minutes. In<br>
a further embodiment, 85% of the tanaproget, or about 90%, is released in about 15<br>
minutes.<br>
In one embodiment, the compositions contain particles of an optimal size to<br>
permit dissolution of the composition, and in a further embodiment, the particles are<br>
less than or equal to about 125 µm, or in still a further embodiment are less than 125<br>
µm. The sizes of the particles of the composition are typically measured by passing<br>
the solid composition through screens of varying sizes. In one embodiment, about<br>
1% of the particles are greater than or equal to about 150 µm; about 19% of the<br><br>
particles are greater than or equal to about 74 µm; and about 65% of the particles are<br>
greater than or equal to about 44 µm. In another embodiment, about 1% of the<br>
particles are greater than or equal to about 350 µm; about 1.7% of the particles are<br>
greater than or equal to about 180 µm; about 2% of the particles are greater than or<br>
equal to about 150 µm; about 21% of the particles are greater than or equal to about<br>
75 µm; and about 66% of the particles are greater than or equal to about 45 µm. In a<br>
further embodiment, about 9% of the particles are greater than or equal to about 350<br>
µm; about 17% of the particles are greater than or equal to about 180 µm; about 20%<br>
of the particles are greater than or equal to about 150 µm; about 60% of the particles<br>
are greater than or equal to about 75 µm; and about 90% of the particles are greater<br>
than or equal to about 45 µm. In still another embodiment, about 21% of the<br>
particles are greater than or equal to about 350 µm; about 64% of the particles are<br>
greater than or equal to about 180 µm; about 74% of the particles are greater than or<br>
equal to about 150 µm; about 87% of the particles are greater than or equal to about<br>
75 µm; and about 8% of the particles are greater than or equal to about 45 µm.<br>
If the particles of the compositions are larger than the optimal size and if the<br>
same have not yet been encapsulated in a capsule, the same can be subject to further<br>
milling and screening steps, among others, to reduce the particle size.<br>
If the composition is already encapsulated in a capsule, the composition can<br>
be manually removed from the capsule and subjected to further milling and screening<br>
steps to reduce the particle sizes of the composition. In a further embodiment, the<br>
capsules containing the composition can be severed using one or more blades or<br>
knives, the composition isolated, and the composition subjected to further milling<br>
and screening steps to reduce the particle sizes of the composition. Once the optimal<br>
particles size has been obtained, the composition is re-encapsulated in a capsule for<br>
use.<br>
B. Stability of the Compositions<br>
The compositions are stable over a period of about 1 month for samples<br>
stored at varying temperatures and humidities. The term stable as used herein refers<br>
to the compositions of the invention which degrade less than about 4%. Typically, it<br><br>
is the tanaproget that degrades in the composition. In one embodiment, the<br>
composition is stable at about 20°C/50% relative humidity to about 45°C/75%<br>
relative humidity. In one embodiment, the compositions of the invention degrade<br>
less than about 4% over a period of greater than 1 month at temperatures of about<br>
25°C and a relative humidity at or greater than about 60%.<br>
In one embodiment, the compositions of the invention were stored at reduced<br>
temperatures, and in a further embodiment, at temperatures of about 5°C. It is<br>
desirable that the compositions be stored in the absence of water, air, and moisture.<br>
C. Additional Components of the Compositions of the Invention<br>
Other suitable components can be added to the compositions, provided that<br>
the same is not already present, and will be readily apparent to one of skill in the art.<br>
Typically, the additional components are inert and do not interfere with the function<br>
of the required components of the compositions. The compositions can thereby<br>
further include other adjuvants, syrups, elixirs, diluents, binders, lubricants,<br>
surfactants, granulating agents, disintegrating agents, emollients, metal chelators, pH<br>
adjusters, surfactants, fillers, disintegrants, and combinations thereof, among others.<br>
Adjuvants can include, without limitation, flavoring agents, coloring agents,<br>
preservatives, and supplemental antioxidants, which can include vitamin E, ascorbic<br>
acid, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA).<br>

D. Methods of Using the Compositions<br>
The invention further provides a method of delivering tanaproget to a patient,<br>
where the method includes administering a micronized tanaproget dosing unit<br>
according to the invention.<br>
The dosage requirements of tanaproget may vary based on the severity of the<br>
symptoms presented and the particular subject being treated. Treatment can be<br><br>
initiated with small dosages less than the optimum dose of tanaproget. Thereafter the<br>
dosage is increased until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached.<br>
Precise dosages will he determined by the administering physician based on<br>
experience with the individual subject treated. In general, the compositions of this<br>
invention are most desirably administered at a concentration that will generally<br>
afford effective results without causing any unacceptable harmful or deleterious side<br>
effects. For example, an effective amount of micronized tanaproget is generally, e.g.,<br>
about 0.05 mg to about 1 mg, about 0.05 mg to about 0.3 mg, about 0.05 mg, about<br>
0.075 mg, about 0.1 mg, about 0.15 mg, about 0.2 mg, or about 03 mg.<br>
These compositions containing micronized tanaproget are therefore useful in<br>
contraception and hormone replacement therapy. The compositions are also useful in<br>
contraception and the treatment and/or prevention of, uterine myometrial fibroids,<br>
benign prostatic hypertrophy, benign and malignant neoplastic disease, dysfunctional<br>
bleeding, uterine leiomyomata, endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, and<br>
carcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the pituitary, endometrium, kidney, ovary,<br>
breast, colon, and prostate and other hormone-dependent tumors, and in the<br>
preparation of medicaments useful therefor. Additional uses of the compositions<br>
include stimulation of food intake.<br>
The compositions of the invention are formed into a suitable dosing unit for<br>
delivery to a patient. Suitable dosing units include oral dosing units, such as a<br>
directly compressible tablets, caplets, capsules, powders, suspensions, microcapsules,<br>
dispersible powders, granules, suspensions, syrups, elixirs, and aerosols. In one<br>
embodiment, the compositions are compressed into a tablet or caplet, which is<br>
optionally added to a capsule, or the compositions are added directly to a capsule.<br>
The compositions of the invention can also be formulated for delivery by other<br>
suitable routes. These dosing units are readily prepared using the methods described<br>
herein and those known to those of skill in the art.<br>
Solid forms, including tablets, caplets, and capsules containing micronized<br>
tanaproget can be formed by dry blending tanaproget with the components described<br>
above. In one embodiment, the capsules utilized include hydroxypropyl<br>
methylcellulose (hypromellose) capsule, or a hard shell gelatin capsule. In another<br><br>
embodiment, the tablets or caplets that contain tanaproget are film-coated. Suitable<br>
film-coatings are known to those of skill in the art. For example, the film-coating<br>
can be selected from among polymers such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, ethyl<br>
cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, and combinations thereof.<br>
A pharmaceutically effective amount of tanaproget can vary depending on the<br>
components of the composition, mode of delivery, severity of the condition being<br>
treated, the patient's age and weight, and any other active ingredients used in the<br>
composition. The dosing regimen can also be adjusted to provide the optimal<br>
therapeutic response. Several divided doses can be delivered daily, e.g., in divided<br>
doses 2 to 4 times a day, or a single dose can be delivered. The dose can however be<br>
proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic<br>
situation. In one embodiment, the delivery is on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.<br>
In another embodiment, the delivery is on a daily delivery. Daily dosages can also be<br>
lowered or raised based on the periodic delivery.<br>
It is contemplated that when the compositions of this invention are used for<br>
contraception or hormone replacement therapy, they can be administered in<br>
conjunction with one or more other progesterone receptor agonists, estrogen receptor<br>
agonists, progesterone receptor antagonists, and selective estrogen receptor<br>
modulators, among others.<br>
"When utilized for treating neoplastic disease, carcinomas, and<br>
adenocarcinomas, they can be administered in conjunction with one or more<br>
chemotherapeutic agents, which can readily be selected by one of skill in the art.<br>

Exampie 1 - Preparation of Micronized Tanaproget<br>
Tanaproget prepared according to US Patent Application Publication No.<br>
2005/0272702, published December 8, 2005, was milled using a U-10 Comil mill<br>
and thereby micronized using a MC50 Jetpharma Micronizer with a EZFH-1.4<br>
Feeder. Particle size was tested periodically for a particle size of less than about 15<br>
µm, and desirably less than about 10 µm, being distributed throughout 50% of the<br>
sample. The micronized tanaproget was packed in triple poly-bagged fiber drums. A<br>
desiccant was inserted between the outermost bags and the atmosphere in the bags<br>
replaced with nitrogen gas.<br>
Example 2 - Preparation of 0.10 and 1.0 mg Capsules Containing Micronized<br>
Tanaproget<br>
This example provides a wet granulation process for producing capsules<br>
containing 0.1 mg and 1.0 mg of micronized tanaproget.<br><br>
SLS and BHA were dissolved in purified water. Povidone was dissolved in<br>
purified water. A portion of intragranular microcrystallme cellulose (MCC) was<br>
passed through a screen directly into a high, shear mixer. Micronized tanaproget was<br>
geometrically pre-blended with a portion of the intragranular MCC and the pre-blend<br>
was passed through a screen directly into the high shear mixer. The remaining<br>
intragranular MCC and intragranular croscarmellose sodium was passed through a<br>
screen directly into the high shear mixer. The composition containing the tanaproget,<br>
MCC, and croscarmellose sodium was mixed using the SLS/BHA solution and<br>
povidone solution, followed with purified water. Additional purified water was<br>
utilized to reach the granulation end-point. Once the granulation end-point was<br>
reached, the granulation was dried and passed through, a screen. Extragranular MCC<br>
and extragranular croscarmellose sodium was passed through a screen and blended<br>
with the dried granulation in a blender. Magnesium stearate was passed through a<br>
screen and pre-mixed with a portion of the material containing the extragranular<br>
MCC, extragranular croscarmellose, and dried granulation. The pre-mix was mixed<br>
with the remaining portion of the material containing the extragranular MCC,<br>
extragranular croscarmellose, and dried granulation to form the final blend. The final<br>
blend was then encapsulated in a #4 hard gel capsule (HGC) to target fill weight of<br>
100 mg. The filled capsules were stored in a poly-lined drum under refrigeration in<br>
the absence of light and moisture.<br>
Example 3 - Preparation of 0.01 mg Capsule Containing Tanaproget<br>

croscarmellose sodium was passed through a screen and mixed in a high shear mixer.<br>
The blend containing tanaproget, intragranular MCC, and intragranular<br>
croscarmellose sodium was mixed using the SLS/BHA solution, povidone solution,<br>
and purified water. If needed, additional purified water was utilized to reach<br>
granulation end point. The wet blend was dried and passed through a screen.<br>
Extragranular MCC and extragranular croscarmellose sodium were passed through a<br>
screen and mixed in a blender with the dried, screened blend.<br>
Magnesium stearate was passed through a screen. The magnesium stearate<br>
was pre-mixed with a portion of the composition containing extragranular MCC,<br>
extragranular croscarmellose sodium, and tanaproget to form a premix. The premix<br>
was then added to the remaining portion of the containing extragranular MCC,<br>
extragranular croscarmellose sodium, and tanaproget, and mixed in a blender to form<br>
a final blend. The final blend was encapsulated in a #4 HGC capsule to target fill<br>
weight of 100 mg. The capsules were stored in a poly-lined drum under<br>
refrigeration, in the absence of light and moisture.<br><br>
Example 5 - Preparation of 5 and 25 mg Capsules Containing Tanaproget<br>
