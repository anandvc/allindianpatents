				<td>RIFFLE DISTRIBUTOR ASSEMBLY FOR A FOSSIL FUEL FIRED<br>
COMBUSTION ARRANGEMENT<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a riffle distributor assembly for a fossil<br>
fuel fired combustion arrangement and, more particularly, to a riffle distributor<br>
assembly for a fossil fuel fired combustion arrangement of the type having fossil<br>
fuel delivery systems that deliver pulverized coal to coal fired steam generators.<br>
Coal fired furnaces are typically provided with a plurality of ducts or pipes<br>
through which pulverized coal and air is directed to a plurality of fuel-air<br>
admission assembhes arrayed in respective vertically extending windboxes. The<br>
windboxes are disposed in one or more walls of the furnace and each introduces<br>
coal and air into the furnace.<br>
Pulverized coal firing is favored over other methods of burning coal<br>
because pulverized coal bums like gas and, therefore, fires are easily lighted and<br>
controlled. Such systems may include one or more pulverizers, also referred to as<br>
mills, that sire used to grind or comminute the fuel or, alternatively, may not<br>
include any pulverizer because a supply of pulverized coal available.<br>
The pipes directing the coal to the respective windboxes are large and<br>
cumbersome. Typically the pipes are provided with large couplings or bolted<br>
flanges to couple the end abutting axially adjacent portions together. The normal<br>
nozzle assembly requires regular maintenance because the pulverized coal has a<br>
severe erosive effect. A typical pulverizer will move between 7 and 50 tons of<br>
coal every hour. The coal typically moves at a velocity of 75-90 feet per second<br>
within the fuel transport pipe.<br>
A typical coal distribution system includes a number of distributors<br>
intended to split the flow of air and pulverized coal into two discrete pipes. It is<br>
desired that the distributors take the homogeneous mixture of pulverized coal and<br>
deliver identical quantities of that homogeneous flow to each of the two discrete<br>
pipes. Each of these distributors is a Y-shaped duct. Each of these Y-shaped ducts<br>
has an inlet and two outlets. US Patent No. 5,934,205 to Gordon et al discloses a<br>
Y-shaped distributor body and a splitter disposed in the distributor body for<br>
dividing a flow of pulverized coal between first and second outlets.<br>
In connection with the feed of pulverized coal to the feed burner nozzles of<br>
a combustion chamber, US Patent No. 6,055,914 to Wark notes that an exhauster<br>
fan first throws the coal radially into a primary discharge chute and that the flow<br>
of coal/air leaving the exhauster fan is uneven, whereby the coal/air flow to the<br>
burners tends to be light on one side or wall of the chute and heavy on the other<br>
side or wall of the chute in terms of both particle size and distribution.<br>
US Patent No. 6,055,914 to Wark describes a prior art solution which<br>
involves providing "riffle boxes" in the chute between the fan and the burners. A<br>
riffle box is a series of vertical, spaced plates separated by angled separator bars<br>
with alternating orientation from plate to plate and US Patent No. 6,055,914 to<br>
Wark notes that, in accordance with one theory, it is believed that the separator<br>
bars on one plate will deflect the coal in one direction, while the separator bars on<br>
adjacent plates will deflect the coal in the opposite direction, thereby splitting and<br>
redistributing the flow for a more homogeneous mixture. It is further noted in this<br>
reference that the typical arrangement is to provide a series of riffle boxes, with a<br>
first riffle box splitting the flow like a "Y" into two chute branches, and a<br>
subsequent riffle box on each of the first two branches splitting the flow again into<br>
a total of four chutes. Each chute typically fuels one of four comer-mounted<br>
burners in a tangentially-fired combustion chamber.<br>
US Patent No. 6,055,914 to Wark notes that the riffle boxes have proven<br>
ineffective in providing a more homogeneous mixture to the burners, and the<br>
coal/air flow reaching the four combustion chamber burners differs significantly<br>
from burner to burner. The reference cites several problems which result from a<br>
riffle box anangement: too lean a mixture at a burner can create NOX; oversized<br>
particles and inefficient burning create LOI (loss on ignition) contamination of the<br>
ash byproduct and reduced combustion efficiency; and, perhaps most importantly,<br>
the out-of-balance burner flow distorts the combustion chamber fireball from the<br>
ideal spherical shape to an undesirable elliptical shape, creating hot and cold spots<br>
in the boiler tubes and causing gas control problems.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a riffle distributor<br>
assembly for a fossil fuel fired combustion arrangement that will advantageously<br>
substantially uniformly distribute a single stream of fossil fuel into a pair of fossil<br>
fuel branch feed paths.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a riffle distributor assembly<br>
for a fossil fuel fired combustion arrangement that permits more precise and<br>
reliable control of the distribution of the material between two or more branch<br>
feed paths.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a riffle distributor<br>
assembly for a fossil fuel fired combustion arrangement that distributes material<br>
between two or more branch feed paths in a manner which minimizes any loss of<br>
pressure.<br>
An additional object of the present invention is to provide a riffle<br>
distributor assembly for a fossil fuel fired combustion arrangement of the type<br>
having fossil fuel delivery systems that deliver pulverized coal to coal fired steam<br>
generators such that the riffle elements will advantageously substantially<br>
uniformly distribute a single stream of pulverized coal into a pair of pulverized<br>
coal branch feed paths.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, it has now been<br>
found that these and other objects of the invention may be attained in an apparatus<br>
for influencing the travel properties of a material moving between a material<br>
supply source and a delivery location which includes means forming a feed path<br>
along which material travels as the material is enroute from the material supply<br>
jource to the delivery location and a riffle distributor assembly. In accordance<br>
vith further details of the one aspect of the present invention, the feed path passes<br>
through an upstream passage and the feed path includes one branch having a<br>
branch entry downstream of the upstream passage and another branch having a<br>
branch entry downstream of the upstream passage. The stream of material travels<br>
through the upstream passage thereafter separating into at least two portions with<br>
one portion of the material entering the one branch through its branch entry and<br>
thereafter traveling along the one branch and another portion of the material<br>
entering the another branch through its branch entry and thereafter traveling along<br>
the another branch in a manner in which the another portion of the material and<br>
the one portion of the material are segregated from one another during their<br>
respective travel along the one branch and the another branch. Also, the riffle<br>
distributor assembly is movable along a lateral axis perpendicular to the reference<br>
axis such that the one portion of the material and the another portion of the<br>
material, prior to their respective segregated travel along the one branch and the<br>
another branch, are comprised in unseparated manner in the stream of material as<br>
it travels through the upstream passage and the portions of the material thereafter<br>
travel in segregated manner in their respective branches with the travel properties<br>
of the one portion of the material in the one branch being different than its travel<br>
properties before the movement of the one branch entry relative to the reference<br>
axis.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, the material feed<br>
apparatus is configured for cooperation with an associated furnace having the<br>
capability of burning coal which is delivered thereto as a mixture of pulverized<br>
coal and air.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The material feed apparatus of the present invention will be described in<br>
detail in connection with the operation of the two embodiments of the material<br>
feed apparatus of the present invention to deliver a pulverized solid fuel and air<br>
mixture to a combustion vessel for combustion of the pulverized solid fuel in a<br>
combustion process. However, before the embodiments of the material feed<br>
apparatus of the present invention are described in detail, reference is had to<br>
Figure 1 for a brief description of the components of the combustion process<br>
arrangement with which the two embodiments of the material feed apparatus of<br>
the present invention are specifically configured to operate.<br>
the solid fuel that is pulverized within the pulverizer 14 is entrained therewithin in<br>
an airstream and while so entrained therein is conveyed from the pulverizer 14<br>
through the exhauster inlet duct 24 to the exhauster 16. The airstream with the<br>
pulverized solid fuel entrained therewith is made to pass through the exhauster 16<br>
by virtue of the movement of a conventional exhauster fan assembly (not shown)<br>
rotatably mounted within the exhauster 16. The pulverized solid fuel while still<br>
entrained in the airstream is discharged from the exhauster 16 through an outlet<br>
28. From the exhauster 16, the pulverized solid fuel entrained in the airstream is<br>
conveyed to the furnace 12 through an exhauster outlet duct 30 to the one<br>
embodiment of the material feed apparatus, hereinafter designated as the riffle<br>
distributor assembly 34. The riffle distributor assembly 34 optimally distributes<br>
the single stream of pulverized solid fuel delivered thereto by the exhauster outlet<br>
duct 30 into tv/o respective branch feed paths, each of which delivers the<br>
pulverized solid fuel to a respective one of the two clusters of the burners 18,<br>
whereupon the pulverized solid fuel is injected into the furnace 12 by the burners<br>
18 and combusted within the furnace 12.<br>
Reference is now had to Figures 2, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, 5a, and 5b, which<br>
illustrate one embodiment of the riffle distributor assembly 34, and to Figure 7,<br>
which illustrates another embodiment of the riffle distributor assembly 34, for a<br>
more detailed description of the manner in which the riffle distributor assembly 34<br>
is configured to feed a material from a material supply source to a delivery<br>
location and, more specifically, is configured to feed a material in the form of a<br>
comminuted solid fossil fuel - namely, pulverized coal - from a material supply<br>
source (the pulverizer 14) to a delivery location (the furnace 12).<br>
As seen in particular in Figure 2, the riffle distributor assembly 34<br>
comprises part of a means forming a feed path 36 along which material in the<br>
form of pulverized coal particles 38 and air 40, hereinafter collectively designated<br>
as the material feed stream 42, is fed from a material supply source (the<br>
pulverizer 14) to a delivery location (the famace 12). The feed path 36 comprises<br>
the various conventional components such as the exhauster 16, the exhauster inlet<br>
In the combustion process arrangement, a solid fuel pulverizer and<br>
exhauster system 10 furnishes pulverized solid fuel to a furnace 12. The solid fuel<br>
pulverizer and exhauster system 10 comprises a pulverizer 14, and an exhauster<br>
16 for effecting delivery of a mixture of hot gases and entrained fine solid fuel<br>
parl;icles from the pulverizer 14 to the furnace 12. The furnace 12 operates in<br>
conventional manner to combust the pulverized solid fuel and air fed thereinto<br>
and, to this end, the pulverized solid fuel and air is injected into the furnace 12<br>
through a plurality of burners 18. Additionally, the secondary air which is<br>
required to effectuate the combustion within the furnace 12 of the pulverized solid<br>
fuel that is injected thereinto through the burners 18. For illustration purposes<br>
herein, the burners 18 are arranged in two discrete clusters of burners with one<br>
burner cluster 18A having several burners commonly mounted along one comer<br>
of the furnace 12 and the other burner cluster 18B having several burners<br>
commonly mounted along another comer of the furnace 12.<br>
The hot gases that are produced from combustion of the pulverized solid<br>
fuel and air rise upwardly in the fumiace 12. During upward movement thereof in<br>
the furnace 12, the hot gases in a manner v^ell-known to those skilled in this art<br>
give up heat to the fluid passing through the tubes 20 that in conventional fashion<br>
line all four of the walls of the fumace 12. Then, the hot gases exit the fumace 12<br>
through a horizontal pass which in tum leads to a rear gas pass, both gas passes<br>
commonly comprising other heat exchanger surface (not shown) for generating<br>
and super heating steam, in a manner well-known to those skilled in this art.<br>
Thereafter, the steam commonly is made to flow to a turbine 22 which is in turn<br>
connected to a variable load, such as an electric generator (not shown), which in<br>
known fashion is cooperatively associated with the turbine 22, such that electricity<br>
is thus produced from the generator (not shown).<br>
In a solid fuel feed operation, raw untrammeled solid fuel, which may be<br>
in the form of coal, is fed from a conventional coal storage silo 26 to the<br>
pulverizer 14 and is pulverized within the pulverizer 14. In tum, the pulverizer 14<br>
is connected by means of an exhauster inlet duct 24 to the exhauster 16 whereby<br>
duct 24, the outlet 28, and the exhauster outlet duct 30 which convey the<br>
pulverized coal particles 38 and air 40 from the pulverizer 14 to the furnace 12 as<br>
well as additional components, to be described in more detail hereinafter, which<br>
convey the material feed stream 42 in a desired distributed load arrangement from<br>
the exhauster outlet duct 30 to the burners 18 of the furnace 12.<br>
The material feed stream 42 fed along the exhauster outlet duct 30 must be<br>
distributed or allocated to the plurality of burners 18 in a manner which optimally<br>
supports the combustion process in the furnace 12. For example, the combustion<br>
process in the furnace 12 may be most optimally supported by an equal allocation<br>
or loading of the burners 18 with the material feed stream 42 - in other words, a<br>
loading in which the same, or substantially the same, load of the material feed<br>
stream 42, as measured, for example, by mass flow rate, is fed to each burner 18<br>
for injection thereby into the combustion chamber encompassed by the furnace 12.<br>
Alternatively, the combustion process in the furnace 12 may be most optimally<br>
supported, at a given operational time period, by an unequal allocation or loading<br>
of the burners 18 with a relatively higher load or allocation of the material feed<br>
stream 42 being fed to a selected one or ones of the burner 18 than is fed to others<br>
of the burners 18. The riffle distributor assembly 34 is configurable to support the<br>
desired burner loading arrangement such that the material feed stream 42<br>
conveyed in the exhauster outlet duct 30 is distributed or allocated to the burners<br>
18 in a manner which achieves the desired burner loading. It is to be noted that, in<br>
this regard, the riffle distributor assembly 34 can be alternatively configured as a<br>
fixed, non-adjustable device operable to distribute the material feed stream 42 m<br>
accordance with a single, predetermined distribution plan or as an adjustable<br>
device which can be adjusted to distribute the material feed stream 42 in<br>
accordance with one distribution plan during one operational period and to<br>
distribute the material feed stream 42 in accordance with another distribution plan<br>
different from the one distribution plan during another operational period. The<br>
configuration of the riffle distributor assembly as a fixed, non-adjustable device<br>
operable to distribute the material feed stream 42 in accordance with a single.<br>
predetermined distribution plan is shown in Figure 7. The configuration of the<br>
riffle distributoir assembly 34 as an adjustable device which can be adjusted to<br>
distribute the material feed stream 42 in accordance with one distribution plan<br>
during one operational period and to distribute the material feed stream 42 in<br>
accordance with another distribution plan different from the one distribution plan<br>
during another operational period is shown in Figures 2, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, 5a, and 5b,<br>
which illustrate the one embodiment of the riffle distributor assembly 34.<br>
For the sake of illustrating several exemplary configurations of the riffle<br>
distributor assembly 34, the distribution of the material feed stream 42 by the<br>
riffle distributor assembly 34 to the burners 18 will be described with respect to a<br>
distribution plan in which the material feed stream 42 is distributed by the riffle<br>
distributor assembly 34 to a total of the two discrete burner clusters 18A, 18B, it<br>
being understood that the riffle distributor assembly 34 can, as desired, be<br>
configured to distribute a feed stream of material to, alternatively, more than two<br>
clusters of the burners 18. Additionally, the distribution of the material feed<br>
stream 42 can be effected, as the situation warrants, by any suitable arrangement<br>
of multiple units of the riffle distributor assembly 34 operating in parallel or in<br>
series.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, it can be seen that the riffle distributor assembly 34<br>
distributes the material feed stream 42 to the pair of the burner clusters 18A, 18B<br>
by effecting a distribution or allocation of the material feed stream 42 being<br>
conveyed in the exhauster outlet duct 30 to two branch ducts 44A, 44B each<br>
separately communicated with a respective one of the burner clusters 18A, 18B<br>
for conveying the respective allocated portion of the material feed stream 42<br>
thereto.<br>
Refemmg now to Figures 2, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, 5a, 5b, and 6, which illustrate<br>
the one embodiment of the riffle distributor assembly 34, the riffle distributor<br>
assembly 34 comprises a transition zone 46 to which one respective end of each of<br>
the branch ducts 44A, 44B is communicated and which is axially spaced from a<br>
downstream end 50 of the exhauster outlet duct 30 with respect to an incoming<br>
flow reference axis IFA. The riffle distributor assembly 34 includes a plenum 48<br>
that forms the downstream end 50 of the exhauster outlet duct 30 and forms, as<br>
well, the transition zone 46 such that the plenum 48, in its entirety, forms an<br>
enclosed space sealed against the outside extending from the downstream open<br>
end 50 of the exhauster outlet duct 30, through the transition zone 46,<br>
communicated with the branch ducts 44A, 44B.<br>
The riffle distributor assembly 34 also includes a plurality of riffle element<br>
plates 52. The riffle element plates 52 are supported within the transition zone 46<br>
and are adjustably positionably movable relative to the exhauster outlet duct 30 by<br>
an intake vane adjustment device 54 (shown in particular in Figure 6 and to be<br>
described shortly hereafter) in a manner such that the intake vane adjustment<br>
device 54 for the riffle element plates 52 is operable to change the offset, or lateral<br>
position, of the intake openings of the riffle element plates 52 relative to a drive<br>
movement axis DMA perpendicular to the incoming flow reference axis IFA.<br>
In the one embodiment of the present invention, and as best seen in Figure<br>
6, the intake openings of the riffle element plates 52 are formed by an adjusting<br>
vane sub-assembly 110 comprising a parallelepiped frame 112 and a plurality of<br>
intake vanes 114 each pivotally connected to a respective one of the riffle element<br>
plates 52 by a pivot connection 116. Reference is also had to Figure 6 in<br>
conjunction with Figure 8a, which is a side elevational sectional view, and Figure<br>
8b, which is a perspective view of one modification of the material feed apparatus<br>
of the present invention showing dual deflector plates mounted between each<br>
adjacent pair of the riffle element plates 52, wherein it can be seen that the<br>
parallelepiped frame 112 has a pair of opposed end panels III, a right hand side<br>
panel 113, and a left hand side panel 115. The left hand side panel 115 of the<br>
parallelepiped frame 112 (which is shown in broken lines in Figure 6 for the sake<br>
of clarity) has, along its inner longitudinal extent, a track 117 on which a slide<br>
drive 119 is slidably supported for sliding movement of the slide drive 119 along<br>
the track 117 in the direction of the DMA axis. Thus, the slide drive 119 extends<br>
parallel to the left hand side panel 115 of the parallelepiped frame 112 and is<br>
slidably supported thereon via the track 117 such that the sHde drive 119 moves in<br>
the direction of the DMA axis relative to the parallelepiped frame 112.<br>
The slide drive 119 includes a plurality of cut-outs 120 punched or cut out<br>
of the slide drive. The left hand side of each intake vane 114 is pivotally mounted<br>
at a respective pivot location 118 to the slide drive 119 such that one portion of<br>
the intake vane 114 extends into the respective generally triangularly shaped cut-<br>
out 120. The pivot location 118 at which each intake vane 114 is pivotally<br>
mounted to the frame 112 is spaced in the vertical direction along the EFA axis<br>
from the respective pivot connection 116 at which the intake vane 114 is pivotally<br>
connected to the respective one of the riffle element plates 52. The right hand side<br>
of each intake vane 114 is pivotally mounted to a respective pivot bore 121<br>
formed in the right hand side panel 113 of the parallelepiped frame 112.<br>
The intake vane adjustment device 54 of the riffle distributor assembly 34,<br>
as seen in Figure 6, is comprised of a motor drive assembly 58 in the form of a<br>
step motor and a rod 60, the motor drive assembly 58 having a selectively<br>
reversibly rotatable shaft whose end is connected via an eccentric pusher to the<br>
rod 60. One end of the rod 60 is pivotally connected to an end of the slide drive<br>
119. The step motor can be selectively actuated to effect extension and retraction<br>
movement of the rod 60 along the DMA axis such that the extension and<br>
retraction movement of the rod 60 along the DMA axis effects sliding movement<br>
of the sHde drive 119 along the track 117 of the left hand side panel 115 relative<br>
the parallelepiped frame 112.<br>
As seen in Figure 6, the upstream edges of the intake vanes 114 form a<br>
plurality of intake spaces defined between adjacent intake vanes 114 which<br>
together define an upstream passage through which the feed path 36 passes. The<br>
material feed stream 42 exiting the downstream open end 50 of the exhauster<br>
outlet duct 30 is distributed or allocated by the riffle distributor assembly 34 such<br>
that the material comprising the material feed stream 42 - namely, the pulverized<br>
coal 38 and air 36 - which has traveled in a non-distributed or non-allocated<br>
manner through the upstream passage bounded by the intake spaces between<br>
adjacent intake vanes 114, is now distributed or allocated by the riffle distributor<br>
assembly 34 according to a predetermined distribution plan into respective<br>
portions segregated from one another during their travel along the respective<br>
branch ducts 44A, 44B to the burner clusters 18A, 18B.<br>
The riffle distributor assembly 34 is thus configured as an apparatus for<br>
influencing the travel properties of a material (in the afore-described exemplary<br>
material feed scenario, the material is the material feed stream 42) moving<br>
between a material supply source (e.g., the pulverizer 14) and a delivery location<br>
(e.g., the furnace 12). The riffle distributor assembly 34 comprises a means<br>
foiTning a feed path 36 along which the material feed stream 42 travels as the<br>
material is enroute from the material supply source in the form of the pulverizer<br>
14 to the delivery location in the form of the furnace 12. The feed path 36 passes<br>
through the intake areas defined between adjacent intake vanes 114 which are<br>
each at a predetermined lateral spacings from the incoming flow reference axis<br>
EFA (i.e., laterally along the DMA axis).<br>
The feed path 36 includes one branch such as, for example, the branch<br>
duct 44A, having a branch entry downstream of intake areas defined between<br>
adjacent intake vanes 114, and another branch such as, for example, the branch<br>
duct 44B, having a branch entry downstream of the intake areas defined between<br>
adjacent intake vanes 114. The feed stream of the material 42 traveling through<br>
the intake ai-eas defined between adjacent intake vanes 114 thereafter separates<br>
into two portions with one portion ol' the material feed stream 42 entering the one<br>
branch duct 44A through its branch entry and thereafter traveling along the one<br>
branch duct 44A and another portion of the material feed stream 42 entering the<br>
other branch duct 44B through its branch entry and thereafter traveling along this<br>
other branch in a manner in which the one portion of the material feed stream 42<br>
and the other portion of the material feed stream 42 are segregated from one<br>
another during their respective travel along the one branch duct 44A and the other<br>
branch duct 44B.<br>
As seen in Figure 6, the riffle element plates 52 each have the same overall<br>
triangular shape and extend upwardly from their bases 154 parallel to one another<br>
along the II'A axis. The bases 154 are each fixedly mounted to the parallelipiped<br>
frame 112 and extend upwardly therefrom parallel to the IFA axis. Accordingly.<br>
Since each of the bases 154 of the riffle element plates 52 is fixedly mounted to<br>
the frame 112 and is, additionally, pivotally connected via a respective one of the<br>
pivot connections 116 to a respective one of the intake vanes 114, the sliding<br>
movement of the slide drive 119 relative to the frame 112 effects pivoting<br>
movement of the intake vanes 114 about their own pivot connections 118 in a<br>
manner in v/hich the riffle element plates 52 remain in their fixed mounted<br>
positions parallel to one another while the intake vanes 114 pivot about their<br>
respective pivot connections 116 in a laterally left pivot movement or a laterally<br>
right pivot movement.<br>
A deflector element 158 is mounted between each adjacent pair of the<br>
riffle element plates 52 and the deflector element 158 is a solid surface extending<br>
from the bases 154 of the adjacent pair of the riffle element plates 52 along the<br>
entirety of a respective side of the riffle element plates 52 to their topmost angle at<br>
which another respective side of the riffle element plates 52 begins. Accordingly,<br>
the respective adjacent sides of each adjacent pair of the riffle element plates 52<br>
which are not covered by a deflector element 158 operate as open passages past<br>
which the material feed stream 42 can flov/ to thereby exit the transition zone 46<br>
and enter a respective one of the branch ducts 44A, 44B. It can thus be<br>
appreciated that an alternating arrangement of the deflector elements 158 in which<br>
the deflector element 158 of every other adjacent pair of the riffle element plates<br>
52 extends along the respective adjacent sides of each adjacent pair of the riffle<br>
element plates 52 which is opposite to the pair of adjacent sides of the next-<br>
following adjacent pair of the riffle element plates 52 on which its own deflector<br>
element 158 is mounted. This alternating jirrangement is the arrangement of the<br>
deflector elements 158 of the one embodiment shown in Figure 6 and, since this<br>
one embodiment comprises an equal number of alternately "right hand" and "left<br>
hand" deflected passages between the riffle element plates 52, the riffle element<br>
plates 52 are operable to deflect the mix of coal particles 38 and air 40 traveling<br>
between each adjacent pair of the riffle element plates 52 into a respective one of<br>
the branch ducts 44A, 44B, depending upon the placement of the respective<br>
deflector element 158, with one-half of the material feed stream 42 being<br>
deflected into the branch duct 44A, as is schematically shown by the dotted line<br>
anow LH in Figure 6, and the other one-half of the material feed stream being<br>
deflected into the branch duct 44B, as is schematically shown by the dash-square<br>
line RH.<br>
The intake vane adjustment device 54 is operable to move the intake areas<br>
defined between adjacent intake vanes 114 in an offset or lateral direction relative<br>
to the incoming flow reference axis IFA (specifically, along the DMA axis) such<br>
that the one portion of the material feed stream 42 and the other portion of the<br>
material feed stream 42, prior to their respective segregated travel along the one<br>
branch duct 44A and other branch duct 44B, are comprised in unseparated manner<br>
in the stream of the material feed stream 42 as it travels through intake areas<br>
defined between adjacent intake vanes 114 and thereafter travel in segregated<br>
manner in their respective branch ducts 44A, 44B with the travel properties of the<br>
one portion of the material feed stream 42 in the one branch duct 44A being<br>
different than its travel properties before the offset or lateral movement of intake<br>
areas defined between adjacent intake vanes 114 relative to the incoming flow<br>
reference axis IFA.<br>
An understanding of how the travel properties of the one portion of the<br>
material feed stream 42 in the one branch duct 44A are different than its travel<br>
properties before the lateral or offset movement of intake areas defined between<br>
adjacent intake vanes 114 can be gained from a more detailed description of the<br>
manner in which the intake vanes 114 influence the distribution of the material<br>
feed stream 42 into the branch ducts 44A, 44B. The offset or lateral positions of<br>
the intake vanes 114 influence the distribution of the material feed stream 42 into<br>
the branch ducts 44A, 44B for the reason that the intake vanes 114 influence the<br>
overall path of movement of the feed stream of material as it exits the downstream<br>
open end 50 of the exhauster outlet duct 30.<br>
The influence of the lateral or offset positions of the intake vanes 114 on<br>
the distribution of the material feed stream. 42 into the branch ducts 44A, 44B is<br>
hereinafter explained with reference to Figures 2, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, 5a, and 5b. As<br>
seen in Figure 3b, which is a schematic side elevational view of the positions of<br>
the riffle element plates shown in Figure 3 during an initial material feed period,<br>
the material feed stream 42 may have, for example, an instantaneous cross-<br>
sectional distribution of the coal particles 38 across a lateral cross-section of the<br>
downstream end 50 of the feed path 36 characterized by the property that<br>
substantially the same proportion of the coal particles 38 in the lateral cross-<br>
section enters into each respective intake area defined between an adjacent pair of<br>
intake vanes 114. In other words, for illustration purposes herein, it is assumed<br>
that the instantaneous cross-sectional distribution of the coal particles 38 across a<br>
lateral cross-section of the downstream end 50 of the feed path 36 is such that an<br>
approximately equal amount of coal particles 38 enter between each adjacent pair<br>
of the intake vanes 114, whereupon the alternating right- and left-handedness<br>
an-angement of the riffle element plates 52 ensures that approximately the same<br>
amount of the coal particles 38 in the instantaneous lateral cross-section of the<br>
downstream end 50 of the feed path 36 enter each of the branch ducts 44A, 44B.<br>
The instantaneous cross-sectional distribution of the coal particles 38 across the<br>
lateral cross-section of the downstream end 50 of the feed path 36 is designated as<br>
the upstream feed distribution FPS and the cross-sectional distribution of the coal<br>
particles 38 during their passage through the branch ducts 44A, 44B is designated<br>
as the downstream feed distribution BDL. It can be seen in Figure 3b that the<br>
intake vanes 114 are, during the initial feed period, in alignment with the axis<br>
IFA; this position of the intake vanes 114 is deemed to be a no or zero offset<br>
position.<br>
The downstream feed distribution BDL changes in correspondence with<br>
the change in the lateral or offset positions of intake areas defined between<br>
adjacent intake vanes 114 from the initial upstream position during an initial<br>
material feed period shown in Figures 3 and 3b to a subsequent upstream position<br>
during a subsequent material feed period following the initial material feed period.<br>
With particulai: reference to Figures 4 and 4b, it can be seen that a lateral or offset<br>
movement of the intake vanes 114 effects a change in the downstream feed<br>
distribution BDL. The motor drive assembly 58 changes the lateral position of<br>
intake areas defined between adjacent intake vanes 114 to effect a change in the<br>
downstream feed distribution BDL. With reference to Figures 4 and 4a, it can be<br>
seen that the downstream feed distribution BDL has been offset during the<br>
subsequent material feed period in that the downstream feed distribution BDL<br>
schematically shown in Figure 4a has now shifted the cross-sectional distribution<br>
of the coal particles 38 to the right-hand side, as viewed in Figure 4a, such that<br>
proportionally more of the coal particles 38 in the upstream feed distribution FPS<br>
enter into the respective passages between the riffle element plates 52 toward the<br>
right hand side than those passages between the riffle element plates toward the<br>
left hand side. As is schematically shown in Figure 4a, by reason of the lateral or<br>
offset movement of the stream feed distribution BDL during the subsequent<br>
material feed period, those passages between adjacent pairs of the riffle element<br>
plates 52 communicated with the branch duct 44B toward the right hand side now<br>
collectively define a relatively greater passage volume than those passages<br>
between adjacent pairs of the riffle element plates 52 communicated with the<br>
branch duct 44A toward the left hand side, whereupon proportionately more of the<br>
coal particles 38 in the cross-sectional distribution flow from the transition zone<br>
46 into the branch duct 44B than flow into the branch duct 44A, and,<br>
consequently, the burner cluster 18B communicated with the branch duct 44B<br>
receives a larger pulse of coal particles 38 than the burner cluster 18A.<br>
Figures 5 and 5b illustrate a different subsequent material feed period in<br>
which the dov/nstream feed distribution BDL has been offset during this<br>
subsequent material feed period in that the downstream feed distribution BDL<br>
schematically shown in Figure 5a has now shifted the cross-sectional distribution<br>
of the coal particles 38 to the left-hand side, as viewed in Figure 5a, such that<br>
proportionally more of the coal particles in the upstream feed distribution FPS<br>
enter into the respective passages between the riffle element plates 52 toward the<br>
left hand side than those passages between the riffle element plates toward the<br>
right hand side.<br>
Figure 7 is an enlarged perspective exploded view, in partial section, of<br>
another embodiment of the material feed apparatus of the present invention shown<br>
in its installed position in line between the solid fuel pulverizer and exhauster<br>
system 10 and the furnace 12 of the fossil fuel combustion unit shown in Figure 1.<br>
In this embodiment, the riffle distributor assembly, which is herein designated as<br>
the riffle distributor assembly 234, is configured as a fixed, non-adjustable device<br>
operable to distribute the material feed stream 42 in accordance with a single,<br>
predetermined distribution plan. The riffle distribution assembly 234 includes two<br>
sets of riffle element plates 252A, 25 2B which are mounted one behind the other<br>
along the DMA axis in the transition zone 46. The riffle element plate 252A<br>
comprises a plurality of deflector elements 258 which each mounted between a<br>
respective adjacent pair of the riffle element plates 252A on the same respective<br>
side of the riffle element plates 252A - namely, the left hand side of the riffle<br>
element plates 252A as viewed in Figure 7. Thus, the riffle element plates 252A<br>
operate to guide the material feed stream 42 in the transition zone 46 into the<br>
branch duct 44A. The riffle element plate 252B comprises a plurality of deflector<br>
elements 258 which each mounted between a respective adjacent pair of the riffle<br>
element plates 252A on the same respective side of the riffle element plates 252B<br>
- namely, the right hand side of the riffle element plates 252B as viewed in Figure<br>
7. Thus, the riffle element plates 252B operate to guide the material feed stream<br>
42 in the transition zone 46 into the branch duct 44B.<br>
Figure 8a is a side elevational sectional view and Figure 8 b is a<br>
perspective view of one modification of the material feed apparatus of the present<br>
invention showing dual deflector plates mounted between each adjacent pair of<br>
the riffle element plates 52. Thus, in addition to the deflector plate 58 mounted<br>
between each adjacent pair of the riffle element plates 52, in this modification of<br>
the one embodiment of the present invention, there is also a mid-position deflector<br>
plate 59 mounted between each adjacent pair of the riffle element plates 52 and<br>
extending parallel to the respective deflector plate 58. Also, each respective<br>
intake vane 114 associated with a respective riffle element plate 52 is configured<br>
as two independently pivotally vane portions 114A, 1144B, wherein each vane<br>
portion 114A influences the travel of the material feed stream 42 into those<br>
respective volumes defined between adjacent pairs of the riffle element plates 52<br>
on the same respective one side of the mid-position deflector plates 59 and each<br>
vane portion 114B influences the travel of the material feed stream 42 into those<br>
respective volumes defined between adjacent pairs of the riffle element plates 52<br>
on the same respective other side of the mid-position deflector plates 59.<br>
The present invention thus provides an apparatus for feeding material<br>
between a material supply location and a delivery location which permits more<br>
precise and reliable control of the distribution of the material between two or more<br>
branch feed paths. Also, the inventive apparatus for feeding material between a<br>
material supply location and a delivery location distributes material between two<br>
or more branch feed paths in a manner which minimizes any loss of pressure.<br>
Moreover, the inventive apparatus for feeding material between a material supply<br>
location and a delivery location can distribute a mixture comprised of a fluid<br>
transport material and a solid material between two or more branch feed paths in a<br>
manner in which the distribution of the fluid transport material between the branch<br>
feed paths remains substantially the same following a re-distribution of the<br>
entrained solid material between the branch paths.<br>
While an embodiment and variations of the present invention have been<br>
shown, it v/ill be appreciated that modifications thereof, some of which have been<br>
alluded to hereinabove, may still be readily made thereto by those skilled in the<br>
art. It is, therefore, intended that the appended claims shall cover the<br>
