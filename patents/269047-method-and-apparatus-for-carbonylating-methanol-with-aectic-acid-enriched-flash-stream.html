ACETIC ACID ENRICHED FLASH STREAM<br>
Claim for Priority<br>
This non-provisional application claims the benefit of the filing date of<br>
United States Patent Application Serial No. 12/150,481, of the same title, filed<br>
April 29, 2008. The priority of United States Patent Application Serial No.<br>
12/150,481 is hereby claimed and the disclosure thereof is incorporated into this<br>
application by reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to acetic acid manufacture with improved<br>
efficiency provided by way of heating a flash vessel to maintain an elevated flash<br>
vapor temperature, generally more than 300°F. By way of the invention, the<br>
relative content of acetic acid in the crude product stream is increased, de-<br>
bottlenecking purification.<br>
Background<br>
Acetic acid production by way of methanol carbonylation is well known in<br>
the art. Generally speaking, a methanol carbonylation production line includes a<br>
reactor, a flasher, purification and recycle. In the reactor section, methanol and<br>
carbon monoxide are contacted with rhodium or iridium catalyst in a homogenous<br>
stirred liquid phase reaction medium in a reactor to produce acetic acid. Methanol<br>
is pumped to the reactor from a methanol surge tank. The process is highly<br>
efficient, having a conversion of methanol to acetic acid of typically greater than<br>
99 percent. A flash vessel coupled to the reactor flashes a draw stream in order to<br>
remove crude product from the reaction mixture. The crude product is fed to a<br>
purification section which includes generally a light ends or stripper column, a<br>
drying column, auxiliary purification and optionally a finishing column. In the<br>
process, various vent streams containing light ends, notably methyl iodide, carbon<br>
monoxide and methyl acetate are generated and fed to a light ends recovery<br>
section. These vent streams are scrubbed with a solvent to remove the light ends<br>
which are returned to the system or discarded.<br>
It has been noted in various references that flash vessels used in<br>
carbonylation production processes may or may not be heated. See United States<br>
Patent No. 5,874,610 to Clode et al. at Col. 2, lines 20-54; United States Patent<br>
No. 5,750,007 to Clode et al. at Col. 2, lines 40-51; and United States Patent No.<br>
5,990,347 to Clode at Col. 2, lines 50-57. See also, United States Patent No.<br>
6,066,762 to Yoneda et al. which discloses a flash temperature of from<br>
80°C-180°C. (Col. 16, lines 40-44). It has not been appreciated, however, that<br>
temperature control within a relatively narrow window can be used to greatly<br>
increase the acetic acid content of the crude product stream in an acetic acid<br>
process. In conventional systems, flashing is typically carried out adiabatically<br>
and there is a large temperature drop relative to the feed stream because of the<br>
heat of vaporization of the crude product.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It has been unexpectedly determined in accordance with the present<br>
invention that moderate heat input to the flasher vessel can greatly increase the<br>
concentration of acetic acid in the crude product stream, reducing purification and<br>
recycle requirements. This finding is not intuitively apparent to one of skill in the<br>
art. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that elevated flash<br>
temperatures vaporize more acetic acid and have little effect on the amount of<br>
light ends (methyl iodide, methyl acetate) that are flashed to the crude product<br>
vapor stream.<br>
There is thus provided in one aspect of the invention a carbonylation<br>
process for producing acetic acid comprising: (a) carbonylating methanol or its<br>
reactive derivatives in the presence of a Group VIII metal catalyst and methyl<br>
iodide promoter to produce a liquid reaction mixture including acetic acid, water,<br>
methyl acetate and methyl iodide; (b)feeding the liquid reaction mixture to a flash<br>
vessel which is maintained at a reduced pressure; (c) heating the flash vessel<br>
while concurrently flashing the reaction mixture to produce a crude product vapor<br>
stream, wherein the reaction mixture is selected and the flow rate of the reaction<br>
mixture to the flash vessel as well as the amount of heat supplied to the flash<br>
vessel is controlled such that the temperature of the crude product vapor stream is<br>
maintained at a temperature of greater than 300°F and the concentration of acetic<br>
acid in the crude product vapor stream is greater than 70% by weight of the<br>
stream.<br>
Further details and advantages will become apparent from the discussion<br>
which follows.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
The invention is described in detail below with reference to numerous<br>
embodiments for purposes of exemplification and illustration only. Modifications<br>
to particular embodiments within the spirit and scope of the present invention, set<br>
forth in the appended claims, will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art.<br>
Unless more specifically defined below, terminology as used herein is<br>
given its ordinary meaning. %, ppm and like terms refer to weight percent and<br>
parts per million by weight, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
"Reduced pressure" refers to a pressure less than that of the reactor vessel.<br>
A "like" stream undergoing flashing refers to a feed stream of the same<br>
composition which yields a product stream having the same flow rate of acetic<br>
acid in the flash vapor. See Tables 1-7.<br>
The feed temperature of the reaction mixture to the flasher is measured as<br>
close as practical to the inlet of the flasher, on the high pressure side. Any<br>
suitable instrumentation may be used.<br>
The temperature of the crude product vapor stream is measured as close as<br>
practical to the vapor outlet of the flasher vessel.<br>
A Group VIII catalyst metal used in connection with the present invention<br>
may be a rhodium and/or iridium catalyst. The rhodium metal catalyst may be<br>
added in any suitable form such that rhodium is in the catalyst solution as an<br>
equilibrium mixture including [Rh(CO)2I2]- anion as is well known in the art.<br>
When rhodium solution is in the carbon monoxide-rich environment of the<br>
reactor, solubility of the rhodium is generally maintained because<br>
rhodium/carbonyl iodide anionic species are generally soluble in water and acetic<br>
acid. However, when transferred to carbon monoxide depleted environments as<br>
typically exist in the flasher, light ends column and so forth, the equilibrium<br>
rhodium/catalyst composition changes since less carbon monoxide is available.<br>
Rhodium precipitates as RhI3, for example; details as to the form of entrained<br>
rhodium downstream of the reactor is not well understood. Iodide salts help<br>
alleviate precipitation in the flasher under so-called "low water" conditions as will<br>
be appreciated by one of skill in the art.<br>
Iodide salts maintained in the reaction mixtures of the processes described<br>
herein may be in the form of a soluble salt of an alkali metal or alkaline earth<br>
metal or a quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salt. In certain embodiments,<br>
the catalyst co-promoter is lithium iodide, lithium acetate, or mixtures thereof.<br>
The salt co-promoter may be added as a non-iodide salt or ligand that will<br>
generate an iodide salt. The iodide catalyst stabilizer may be introduced directly<br>
into the reaction system. Alternatively, the iodide salt may be generated in-situ<br>
since under the operating conditions of the reaction system, a wide range of non-<br>
iodide salt precursors will react with methyl iodide to generate the corresponding<br>
co-promoter iodide salt stabilizer. For additional detail regarding iodide salt<br>
generation, see U.S. Patents 5,001,259 to Smith et al; 5,026,908 to Smith et al.;<br>
and 5,144,068, also to Smith et al., the disclosures of which are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference. The iodide salt may be added as a phosphine oxide or<br>
any organic ligand, if so desired. These compounds and other ligands generally<br>
undergo quaternization in the presence of methyl iodide at elevated temperatures<br>
to yield suitable salts which maintain iodide anion concentration.<br>
An iridium catalyst in the liquid carbonylation reaction composition may<br>
comprise any iridium-containing compound which is soluble in the liquid reaction<br>
composition. The iridium catalyst may be added to the liquid reaction<br>
composition for the carbonylation reaction in any suitable form which dissolves in<br>
the liquid reaction composition or is convertible to a soluble form. Examples of<br>
suitable iridium-containing compounds which may be added to the liquid reaction<br>
composition include: IrCl3, Irl3, IrBr3, [Ir(CO)2I]2, [Ir(CO)2Cl]2, [Ir(CO)2Br]2,<br>
[Ir(CO)2I2]-H+, [Ir(CO)2Br2]-H+, [Ir(CO)2I4-H+, [Ir(CH3)I3(CO2]-H+, Ir4(CO)l2.<br>
IrCl3.3H2O, IrBr3.3H2O, Ir4(CO)12, iridium metal, Ir2O3, Ir(acac)(CO)2, Ir(acac)3,<br>
iridium acetate, [Ir3O(OAc)6(H2O)3][OAc], and hexachloroiridic acid [H2IrCl6].<br>
Chloride-free complexes of iridium such as acetates, oxalates and acetoacetatcs<br>
are usually employed as starting materials. The iridium catalyst concentration in<br>
the liquid reaction composition may be in the range of 100 to 6000 ppm. The<br>
carbonylation of methanol utilizing iridium catalyst is well known and is generally<br>
described in the following United States Patents: 5,942,460; 5,932,764;<br>
5,883,295; 5,877,348; 5,877,347 and 5,696,284, the disclosures of which are<br>
hereby incorporated by reference into this application as if set forth in their<br>
entirety.<br>
Methyl iodide is used as the promoter. Preferably, the concentration of<br>
methyl in the liquid reaction composition is in the range 1 to 50% by weight,<br>
preferably 2 to 30% by weight.<br>
The promoter may be combined with a salt stabilizer/co-promoter<br>
compound, which may include salts of a metal of Group IA or Group IIA, or a<br>
quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salt. Particularly preferred are iodide or<br>
acetate salts, e.g., lithium iodide or lithium acetate.<br>
Other promoters and co-promoters may be used as part of the catalytic-<br>
system of the present invention as described in European Patent Publication<br>
EP 0 849 248, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Suitable promoters are selected from ruthenium, osmium, tungsten, rhenium, zinc,<br>
cadmium, indium, gallium, mercury, nickel, platinum, vanadium, titanium,<br>
copper, aluminum, tin, antimony, and are more preferably selected from<br>
ruthenium and osmium. Specific co-promoters are described in United States<br>
Patent No. 6,627,770, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
A promoter may be present in an effective amount up to the limit of its<br>
solubility in the liquid reaction composition and/or any liquid process streams<br>
recycled to the carbonylation reactor from the acetic acid recovery stage. When<br>
used, the promoter is suitably present in the liquid reaction composition at a molar<br>
ratio of promoter to metal catalyst of [0.5 to 15]:1, preferably [2 to 10]:1, more<br>
preferably [2 to 7.5]: 1. A suitable promoter concentration is 400 to 5000 ppm.<br>
The present invention may be appreciated in connection with, for example,<br>
the carbonylation of methanol with carbon monoxide in a homogeneous catalytic<br>
reaction system comprising a reaction solvent (typically acetic acid), methanol<br>
and/or its reactive derivatives, a soluble rhodium catalyst, at least a finite<br>
concentration of water. The carbonylation reaction proceeds as methanol and<br>
carbon monoxide are continuously fed to the reactor. The carbon monoxide<br>
reactant may be essentially pure or may contain inert impurities such as carbon<br>
dioxide, methane, nitrogen, noble gases, water and C1 to C4 paraffinic<br>
hydrocarbons. The presence of hydrogen in the carbon monoxide and generated<br>
in situ by the water gas shift reaction is preferably kept low, for example, less than<br>
1 Bar partial pressure, as its presence may result in the formation of hydrogenation<br>
products. The partial pressure of carbon monoxide in the reaction is suitably in<br>
the range 1 to 70 bar, preferably 1 to 35 bar, and most preferably 1 to 15 bar.<br>
The pressure of the carbonylation reaction is suitably in the range 10 to<br>
200 Bar, preferably 10 to 100 bar, most preferably 15 to 50 Bar. The temperature<br>
of the carbonylation reaction is suitably in the range 100 to 300°C, preferably in<br>
the range 150 to 220°C. Acetic acid is typically manufactured in a liquid phase<br>
reaction at a temperature of from about 150 - 200°C and a total pressure of from<br>
about 20 to about 50 bar.<br>
Acetic acid is typically included in the reaction mixture as the solvent for<br>
the reaction.<br>
Suitable reactive derivatives of methanol include methyl acetate, dimethyl<br>
ether, methyl formate and methyl iodide. A mixture of methanol and reactive<br>
derivatives thereof may be used as reactants in the process of the present<br>
invention. Preferably, methanol and/or methyl acetate are used as reactants. At<br>
least some of the methanol and/or reactive derivative thereof will be converted to,<br>
and hence present as, methyl acetate in the liquid reaction composition by reaction<br>
with acetic acid product or solvent. The concentration in the liquid reaction<br>
composition of methyl acetate is suitably in the range 0.5 to 70% by weight,<br>
preferably 0.5 to 50% by weight, more preferably 1 to 35% by weight and most<br>
preferably 1-20% by weight.<br>
Water may be formed in situ in the liquid reaction composition, for<br>
example, by the esterification reaction between methanol reactant and acetic acid<br>
product. Water may be introduced to the carbonylation reactor together with or<br>
separately from other components of the liquid reaction composition. Water may<br>
be separated from other components of reaction composition withdrawn from the<br>
reactor and may be recycled in controlled amounts to maintain the required<br>
concentration of water in the liquid reaction composition. Preferably, the<br>
concentration of water maintained in the liquid reaction composition is in the<br>
range 0.1 to 16% by weight, more preferably 1 to 14% by weight, most preferably<br>
1 to 10% by weight.<br>
The reaction liquid is typically drawn from the reactor and flashed in a one<br>
step or multi-step process using a converter as well as a flash vessel as hereinafter<br>
described. The crude vapor process stream from the flasher is sent to a<br>
purification system which generally includes at least a light ends column and a<br>
dehydration column.<br>
The present invention is further appreciated by reference to Figure 1<br>
which is a schematic diagram illustrating a typical carbonylation process and<br>
apparatus. In Figure 1 there is shown a carbonylation system 10 including a<br>
reactor 12 provided with a feed system 14 including a methanol surge tank 16 and<br>
carbon monoxide feed line 18. A catalyst reservoir system includes a methyl<br>
iodide storage vessel 20 as well as a catalyst storage tank 22. Reactor 12 is<br>
provided with a vent 24 and an optional vent 24a. Reactor 12 is coupled to a<br>
flash vessel 26 by way of a conduit 28 and optionally by way of vent 24a. The<br>
flasher, in turn, is coupled to a purification section 30 which includes a light ends<br>
or stripper column 32, a dehydration column 34 and a strong acid, silver-<br>
exchanged cation ion-exchange resin bed 36 which removes iodides from the<br>
product. Instead of a silver-exchanged, strong acid cation ion-exchange resin, it<br>
has been reported that anion ion-exchange resin can be used to remove iodides.<br>
See British Patent No. G 2112394A, as well as United States Patent No.<br>
5,416,237, Col. 7, lines 54+, which teaches the use of 4-vinylpyridine resins for<br>
iodide removal.<br>
A gaseous purge stream is typically vented from the head of the reactor to<br>
prevent buildup of gaseous by-products such as methane, carbon dioxide and<br>
hydrogen and to maintain a set carbon monoxide partial pressure at a given total<br>
reactor pressure. Optionally (as illustrated in Chinese Patent No. ZL92108244.4),<br>
a so-called "converter" reactor can be employed which is located between the<br>
reactor and flasher vessel shown in Figure 1 and discussed further in connection<br>
with Figure 2. Optionally, the gaseous purge streams may be vented through the<br>
flasher base liquid or lower part of the light ends column to enhance rhodium<br>
stability and/or they may be combined with other gaseous process vents (such as<br>
the purification column overhead receiver vents) prior to scrubbing. These<br>
variations are well within the scope of the present invention as will be appreciated<br>
from the appended claims and the description which follows.<br>
As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the different chemical<br>
environments encountered in the purification train may require different<br>
metallurgy. For example, equipment at the outlet of the light ends column will<br>
likely require a zirconium vessel due to the corrosive nature of the process stream.<br>
while a vessel of stainless steel may be sufficient for equipment placed<br>
downstream of the dehydration column where conditions are much less corrosive.<br>
Carbon monoxide and methanol are introduced continuously into reactor<br>
12 with adequate mixing at a high carbon monoxide partial pressure. The non-<br>
condensable bi-products are vented from the reactor to maintain an optimum<br>
carbon monoxide partial pressure. The reactor off gas is treated to recover reactor<br>
condensables, i.e., methyl iodide before flaring. Methanol and carbon monoxide<br>
efficiencies are generally greater than about 98 and 90% respectively. As will be<br>
appreciated from the Smith et al. patent noted above, major inefficiencies of the<br>
process are the concurrent manufacture of carbon dioxide and hydrogen by way of<br>
the water gas shift reaction.<br>
From the reactor, a stream of the reaction mixture is continuously fed via<br>
conduit 28 to flasher 26. Through the flasher the product acetic acid and the<br>
majority of the light ends (methyl iodide, methyl acetate, and water) are separated<br>
from the reactor catalyst solution, and the crude process stream 38 is forwarded<br>
with dissolved gases to the distillation or purification section 30 in single stage<br>
flash. The catalyst solution is recycled to the reactor via conduit 40. In<br>
accordance with the invention, the flasher is heated with steam, for example, by<br>
way of jacketing or coils in order to raise the temperature of stream 38.<br>
Alternative heating means such as electric heating or radiant (microwave) heating<br>
can be used if more convenient.<br>
The purification of the acetic acid typically includes distillation in a light<br>
ends column, a dehydration column, and, optionally, a heavy ends column. The<br>
crude vapor process stream 38 from the flasher is fed into the light ends column<br>
32. Methyl iodide, methyl acetate, and a portion of the water condense overhead<br>
in the light end columns to form two phases (organic and aqueous) in a receiver<br>
42. Both overhead liquid phases return to the reaction section via recycle line 44.<br>
Optionally, a liquid recycle stream 45 from the light ends column may also be<br>
returned to the reactor.<br>
The purified process stream 50 is drawn off the side of the light ends<br>
column 32 and is fed into dehydration column 34. Water and some acetic acid<br>
from this column separate and are recycled to the reaction system via recycle line<br>
44 as shown. The purified and dried process stream 52 from the dehydration<br>
column 34 feeds resin bed 36 and product is taken therefrom at 56 as shown.<br>
Carbonylation system 10 uses only two primary purification columns and is<br>
preferably operated as described in more detail in United States Patent No.<br>
6,657,078 to Scales et al, entitled "Low Energy Carbonylation Process", the<br>
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Additional columns are<br>
generally used as desired, depending on the system.<br>
There is shown in Figure 2 an alternate layout of the reactor/flasher with a<br>
converter vessel 12a therebetween as well as a heat exchanger 60 and a low<br>
pressure steam flash vessel 62. Reactor 12 and flasher 26 operate as described<br>
above. Methanol and carbon monoxide are provided to reactor 12 at 18a, 18 and<br>
liquid reaction mixture is drawn at 28a and provided to converter vessel 12a<br>
which vents gas including light ends to a scrubber (not shown). The vent gas can<br>
be scrubbed with methanol and returned to the reactor. Converter 12a feeds<br>
flasher 26 where the pressure is reduced and flashed to crude product stream 38.<br>
Recycle to the reactor is provided by way of lines 40, 44 as is discussed above in<br>
connection with Figure 1.<br>
Flasher 26 is heated by way of a low pressure steam supply 64 provided<br>
from a steam flash vessel 62 which is fed from heat exchanger 60. Heat<br>
exchanger 64 is made with suitable metallurgy and receives hot catalytic mixture<br>
from reactor 12 via line 66 as well as steam condensate via line 68. The<br>
condensate is heated by the hot catalyst which, in turn, requires cooling because of<br>
the exothermic nature of the carbonylation reaction. The heated condensate is<br>
supplied to vessel 62 via line 70 where it is flashed to (low pressure) steam and<br>
used to heat flasher 26 as noted above.<br>
Thus, heat exchanger 64 as shown in Figure 2 provides cooling to the<br>
reactor and heat to the flasher which reduces overall energy costs as will be<br>
appreciated by one of skill in the art.<br>
Carbon monoxide may be added directly to converter 12a if so desired or<br>
may be added slightly before (upstream) or after (downstream) if so desired in<br>
order to stabilize the catalyst solution and consume any unreacted methanol.<br>
Details of such arrangements are seen in European Patent No. EP 0 759 419 as<br>
well as United States Patent No. 5,770, 768 to Denis et al., the disclosures of<br>
which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Whether or not heat transfer from the reactor to the flasher is employed,<br>
the present invention substantially increases the efficiency of the system by<br>
providing a higher concentration of acetic acid in the crude product vapor stream<br>
as will be appreciated form the discussion which follows.<br>
The carbonylation apparatus shown in Figure 1 and that illustrated in<br>
Figure 2 can be represented schematically as shown in Figure 3 for present<br>
purposes. In Figure 3, the feed to the reactor is designated stream 1, the liquid<br>
stream to the flasher is designated stream 2, the crude product vapor stream<br>
provided to the splitter column is designated stream 3 and the purified product<br>
stream is labeled stream 4. Stream 5 represents the catalyst recycle stream from<br>
the flasher and stream 6 represents recycle from purification recycle to the reactor.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates two major inefficiencies of the methanol carbonylation<br>
process generally; catalyst recycle (5) and purification recycle (6). Both of these<br>
internal 'flywheels' are energy and capital-intensive and could be minimized by<br>
improving performance of the flasher - by ensuring that the vapor stream that it<br>
sends to purification (3) has proportionally more HAc and less "non-product"<br>
components (H2O, MeAc, Mel). This can be accomplished by providing heat<br>
input to raise the operating temperature of the flasher. The benefits of this concept<br>
are illustrated in the following examples.<br>
A semi-empirical simulator was used to study the effect of flash<br>
temperature while holding constant the mass flow of HAc in the vapor stream (3).<br>
The stream compositions are shown below for vapor (3) and liquid (5) exiting the<br>
flasher. The flasher inlet basis is a stream at 387°F, 400 psig, containing 8.1 wt%<br>
Mel, 2.9 wt% MeAc, 75.7 wt% HAc, 2.8 wt% H2O, and 10.6 wt% Lil. Flash<br>
temperature (temperature of the vapor stream) was varied from adiabatic (297°F)<br>
to isothermal (387°F), all cases to 25 psig.<br>
Results appear in Tables 1-7 and Figures 4-7.<br>
As shown in the data and on Figure 4, increasing the flasher temperature<br>
increases the HAc wt% in the vapor stream (3) while decreasing concentrations of<br>
all other components. Figure 5 illustrates that the proportion of Li I in the catalyst<br>
recycle stream (5) increases with increasing flash temperature. This high Li I acts<br>
to improve catalyst stability in the flasher (possibly compensating for any<br>
detrimental effects of higher operating temperature).<br>
Figure 6 shows the effect of flasher temperature on the mass flow rate of<br>
each component in the vapor stream that is fed to purification (3). It shows that<br>
for a set amount of HAc throughput, smaller quantities of the "non-product"<br>
components are sent to purification when using a higher flash temperature. For<br>
example, raising the flash temperature from 297 to 310°F would decrease the<br>
mass flow of water sent to purification by 30%, MeAc by 55% and Mel by 55%.<br>
It is seen in Figure 7 that the flow rate requirements of the streams are<br>
significantly lower when operating the flasher at a higher temperature. This is a<br>
result of proportionally more HAc in the vapor stream exiting the flasher (3) and<br>
less of the "non-product" components. A lower flow rate of flasher feed (2) is<br>
required to attain the same mass throughput of HAc to purification (3). For<br>
example, by raising flash temperature from 297 to 310°F, the required catalyst<br>
recycle rate drops by 90%, liquid feed to flasher by 80%, purification recycle by<br>
50% and vapor feed to purification by 20%. Benefits include: (1) for an existing<br>
unit, increasing HAc in the crude product stream, thus debottlenecking<br>
purification and lower operating costs and/or allow an increase in capacity; (2)<br>
running the reactor at higher MeAc, currently this level is typically constrained by<br>
purification capacity, higher MeAc also allows the reactor to operate at a lower<br>
temperature and also decreases the make rate of propionic acid; (3) for a new unit,<br>
the capital and energy requirements are reduced by requiring less catalyst recycle<br>
and purification throughput for a given production rate of HAc; (4) decrease in<br>
vapor feed rate to purification reduces catalyst loss via entrainment; and (5)<br>
decrease in liquid feed rate to the flasher improves CO efficiency by significantly<br>
reducing the carryover loss of soluble CO (which currently accounts for 80% of<br>
the total CO waste).<br>
For example, increasing flasher operating temperature from 297 to 310°<br>
decreases the required flowrate to the flasher by 80%. This modification<br>
decreases the total CO inefficiency dramatically, by -60% (= 80% reduction of<br>
the 80% of CO loss from flasher carryover).<br>
The energy cost of heating the flasher with steam is shown in Figure 8.<br>
This cost would be significantly reduced by integrating heat between the reactor<br>
and flasher as is shown in Figure 2. For example, to heat to 310°F, it is possible<br>
to use the reactor cooling loop to heat the flasher.<br>
While the invention has been illustrated in connection with particular<br>
equipment and operating conditions, modifications to these examples within the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art.<br>
