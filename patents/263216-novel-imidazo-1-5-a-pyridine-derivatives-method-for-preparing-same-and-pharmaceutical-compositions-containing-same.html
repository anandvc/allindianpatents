Novel imidazo [1,5-a]pyridine derivatives, method for<br>
preparing same and pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing same<br>
A subject matter of the present invention is novel<br>
imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine derivatives which are inhibitors<br>
of FGFs (fibroblast growth factor), their process of<br>
preparation and the pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising them.<br>
FGFs are a family of polypeptides synthesized by a<br>
large number of cells during embryonic development and<br>
by cells of adult tissues in various pathological<br>
conditions.<br>
Certain derivatives of naphthyridinediamines and<br>
corresponding ureas which are selective inhibitors of<br>
FGF-1 are known (Batley B. et al. , Life Sciences,<br>
(1998), Vol. 62, No. 2, pp. 143-150; Thompson A. et<br>
al., J. Med. Chem., (2000), Vol. 43, pp. 4200-4211).<br>
Indolizine derivatives which are antagonists of the<br>
binding of FGFs to their receptors are described in<br>
international patent applications WO 03/084956 and<br>
WO 2005/028476.<br>
It has now been found that compounds which are<br>
imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine derivatives exhibit a powerful<br>
antagonist activity for the binding of FGFs to their<br>
receptors as well as a very good activity in vivo. This<br>
is because, surprisingly, in in vivo models in the<br>
mouse, the dose of 10 mg/kg allows us to obtain a<br>
maximum activity of the compounds. This effect was only<br>
obtained at the dose of 50 mg/kg with the indolizine<br>
series described in international patent applications<br>
WO 03/084956 and WO 2005/028476.<br><br>

which, by treatment with thionyl chloride, results in<br>
the corresponding acid chloride, which is used to<br>
acylate the compounds of formula II and to give the<br>
compounds of formula Ic.<br>
The compounds of the formula I according to the present<br>
invention are powerful FGF-1 and -2 antagonists. Their<br><br>
WO 2006/097625	- 34 -	PCT/FR2006/000567<br>
abilities to both inhibit the formation of new vessels<br>
from differentiated endothelial cells and to block the<br>
differentiation of CD34+ CD133+ adult human bone marrow<br>
cells to give endothelial cells have been demonstrated<br>
in vitro. Furthermore, their ability to inhibit<br>
pathological angiogenesis has been demonstrated<br>
in vivo. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the<br>
compounds of formula I are powerful antagonists of the<br>
FGF-1 receptor.<br>
Generally, FGF receptors are significantly involved,<br>
via autocrine, paracrine or juxtacrine secretions, in<br>
the phenomena of deregulation of the stimulation of the<br>
growth of cancer cells. Moreover, FGF receptors affect<br>
tumor angiogenesis, which plays a predominant role both<br>
with regard to the growth of the tumor and also with<br>
regard to metastasizing phenomena.<br>
Angiogenesis is a process for the generation of new<br>
capillary vessels from preexisting vessels or by<br>
mobilization and differentiation of bone marrow cells.<br>
Thus, both uncontrolled proliferation of endothelial<br>
cells and mobilization of angioblasts from the bone<br>
marrow are observed in neovascularization processes of<br>
tumors. It has been shown in vitro and in vivo that<br>
several growth factors stimulate endothelial<br>
proliferation and in particular the FGF-1 or a-FGF<br>
receptor and the FGF-2 or b-FGF receptor. These two<br>
factors induce the proliferation, the migration and the<br>
production of proteases by endothelial cells in culture<br>
and neovascularization in vivo. The a-FGF and b-FGF<br>
receptors interact with the endothelial cells via two<br>
categories of receptors, high affinity receptors with a<br>
tyrosine kinase activity (FGFs) and low affinity<br>
receptors of heparan sulfate proteoglycan type (HSPGs)<br>
situated at the surface of the cells and in the<br>
extracellular matrices. While the paracrine role of<br>
these two factors with regard to endothelial cells is<br><br>
WO 2006/097625	- 35-	PCT/FR2006/000567<br>
widely described, a-FGF and b-FGF might also be<br>
involved with regard to the cells through an autocrine<br>
process. Thus, a-FGF and b-FGF and their receptors<br>
represent highly relevant targets for therapies aimed<br>
at inhibiting angiogenesis processes (Keshet E. and<br>
Ben-Sasson S.A., J. Clin. Invest., (1999), Vol. 501,<br>
pp. 104-1497; Presta M., Rusnati M., Dell'Era P.,<br>
Tanghetti E., Urbinati C, Giuliani R. et al. , New<br>
York: Plenum Publishers, (2000), pp. 7-34;<br>
Billottet C, Jan j i B., Thiery J.P. and Jouanneau J.,<br>
Oncogene, (2002), Vol. 21, pp. 8128-8139).<br>
Furthermore, systematic studies targeted at determining<br>
the expression due to a-FGF and b-FGF and their<br>
receptors (FGFs) with regard to various types of tumor<br>
cells demonstrate that a cell response to these two<br>
factors is functional in a great majority of human<br>
tumor lines studied. These results support the<br>
hypothesis that an antagonist of a-FGF and b-FGF might<br>
also inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells (Chandler<br>
L.A., Sosnowski B.A., Greenlees L. , Aukerman S.L.,<br>
Baird A. and Pierce G.F., Int. J. Cancer, (1999),<br>
Vol. 58, pp. 81-451).<br>
a-FGF and b-FGF play an important role in the growth<br>
and maintenance of the cells of the prostate. It has<br>
been shown, both in animal models and in man, that a<br>
detrimental change in the cellular response to these<br>
factors plays an essential role in the progression of<br>
prostate cancer. This is because, in these pathologies,<br>
both an increase in the production of a-FGF, and b-FGF<br>
by the fibroblasts and the endothelial cells present in<br>
the tumor and an increase in the expression of FGF<br>
receptors on the tumor cells are recorded. Thus, a<br>
paracrine stimulation of the cancer cells of the<br>
prostate takes place and this process would be a major<br>
component of this pathology. A compound possessing an<br>
antagonist activity for FGF receptors, such as the<br><br>
WO 2006/097625	- 36 -	PCT/FR2006/000567<br>
compounds of the present invention, may represent a<br>
therapy of choice in these pathologies (Giri D. and<br>
Ropiquet F., Clin. Cancer Res., (1999), Vol. 71,<br>
pp. 5-1063; Doll J.A., Reiher F.K., Crawford S.E.,<br>
Pins M.R., Campbell S.C. and Bouck N.P., Prostate,<br>
(2001), Vol. 305, pp. 49-293).<br>
Several studies show the presence of a-FGF and b-FGF<br>
and their FGFR receptors both in human breast tumor<br>
lines (in particular MCF7) and in biopsies of tumors.<br>
These factors would be responsible, in this pathology,<br>
for the appearance of a very aggressive phenotype which<br>
induces strong metastasizing. Thus, a compound<br>
possessing an antagonist activity for FGFR receptors,<br>
such as the compounds of the formula I, may represent a<br>
therapy of choice in these pathologies (Vercoutter-<br>
Edouart A-S., Czeszak X., Crepin M., Lemoine J.,<br>
Boilly B., Le Bourhis X. et al., Exp. Cell. Res.,<br>
(2001), Vol. 262, pp. 59-68).<br>
Cancerous melanomas are tumors which very frequently<br>
induce metastases and which are highly resistant to the<br>
various chemotherapy treatments. Angiogenesis processes<br>
play a predominant role in the progression of a<br>
cancerous melanoma. Moreover, it has been shown that<br>
the probability of appearance of metastases increases<br>
very strongly with the increase in the vascularization<br>
of the primary tumor. The cells of melanomas produce<br>
and secrete various angiogenic factors, including a-FGF<br>
and b-FGF. Furthermore, it has been shown that<br>
inhibition of the cell effect of these two factors by<br>
the soluble FGF-1 receptor blocks in vitro the<br>
proliferation and the survival of the melanoma tumor<br>
cells and blocks in vivo the tumor progression. Thus, a<br>
compound possessing an antagonist activity for FGF<br>
receptors, such as the compounds of the present<br>
invention, may represent a therapy of choice in these<br>
pathologies (Rofstad E.K. and Halsor E.F., Cancer Res.,<br><br>
WO 2006/097625	- 37 -	PCT/FR2006/000567<br>
(2000); Yayon A., Ma Y-S., Safran M. , Klagsbrun M. and<br>
Halaban R., Oncogene, (1997), Vol. 14, pp. 2999-3009).<br>
Glioma cells produce a-FGF and b-FGF in vitro and<br>
in vivo and possess, at their surface, various FGF<br>
receptors. This thus suggests that these two factors,<br>
by autocrine and paracrine effect, play a pivotal role<br>
in the progression of this type of tumor. Moreover,<br>
like the majority of solid tumors, the progression of<br>
gliomas and their ability to induce metastases is<br>
highly dependent on the angiogenic processes in the<br>
primary tumor. It has also been shown that FGF-1<br>
receptor antisenses block human astrocytoma<br>
proliferation. Furthermore, naphthalenesulfonate<br>
derivatives are described for inhibiting the cellular<br>
effects of a-FGF and b-FGF in vitro and the<br>
angiogenesis induced by these growth factors in vivo.<br>
Intracerebral injection of these compounds induces a<br>
very significant increase in apoptosis and a<br>
significant decrease in angiogenesis, which is<br>
reflected by a considerable regression in gliomas in<br>
the rat. Thus, a compound possessing an antagonist<br>
activity for a-FGF and/or b-FGF and/or FGF receptors,<br>
such as the compounds of the present invention, may<br>
represent a therapy of choice in these pathologies<br>
(Yamada S.M., Yamaguchi F., Brown R., Berger M.S. and<br>

More recently, the potential role of proangiogenic<br>
agents in leukemias and lymphomas has been documented.<br>
This is because, generally, it has been reported that<br>
cell clones in these pathologies can be either<br>
destroyed naturally by the immune system or suddenly<br>
change into an angiogenic phenotype which favors their<br>
survival and then their proliferation. This change in<br><br>
WO 2006/097625	- 38 -	PCT/FR2006/000567<br>
phenotype is induced by an overexpression of angiogenic<br>
factors, in particular by the macrophages, and/or a<br>
mobilization of these factors from the extracellular<br>
matrix (Thomas D.A., Giles F.J., Cortes J., Albitar M.<br>
and Kantarjian H.M., Acta Haematol. , (2001), Vol. 207,<br>
pp. 106-190). Among angiogenic factors, b-FGF has been<br>
detected in numerous lymphoblastic and hematopoietic<br>
tumor cell lines. FGF receptors are also present on the<br>
majority of these lines, suggesting a possible<br>
autocrine cellular effect of the a-FGF and b-FGF which<br>
induces the proliferation of these cells. Furthermore,<br>
it has been reported that the angiogenesis of the bone<br>
marrow by paracrine effects was correlated with the<br>
progression of some of these pathologies.<br>
More particularly, it has been shown, in CLL (chronic<br>
lymphocytic leukemia) cells, that b-FGF induces an<br>
increase in the expression of antiapoptotic protein<br>
(Bcl2), resulting in an increase in the survival of<br>
these cells, and thus significantly participates in<br>
their cancerization. Moreover, the levels of b-FGF<br>
which are measured in these cells are very well<br>
correlated with the stage of clinical progression of<br>
the disease and the resistance to the chemotherapy<br>
applied in this pathology (fludarabine) . Thus, a<br>
compound possessing an antagonist activity for FGF<br>
receptors, such as the compounds of the present<br>
invention, may represent a therapy of choice, either<br>
alone or in combination with fludarabine or other<br>
products active in this pathology (Thomas D.A.,<br>
Giles F.J., Cortes J., Albitar M. and Kantarjian H.M.,<br>
Acta Haematol., (2001), Vol. 207, pp. 106-190);<br>
Gabrilove J.L., Oncologist, (2001), Vol. 6, pp. 4-7).<br>
There exists a correlation between the angiogenesis<br>
process of the bone marrow and extramedullar diseases<br>
in CMLs (chronic myelomonocytic leukemias). Various<br>
studies demonstrate that the inhibition of<br><br>
WO 2006/097625	- 39 -	PCT/FR2006/000567<br>
angiogenesis, in particular by a compound possessing an<br>
antagonist activity for FGF receptors, might represent<br>
a therapy of choice in this pathology.<br>
The proliferation and the migration of vascular smooth<br>
muscle cells contribute to intimal hypertrophy of the<br>
arteries and thus plays a predominant role in<br>
atherosclerosis and in post-angioplasty restenosis and<br>
endarterectomy.<br>
In vivo studies show, after lesion of the carotid by<br>
balloon injury, local production of a-FGF and b-FGF. In<br>
this same model, an anti-FGF2 neutralizing antibody<br>
inhibits the proliferation of the vascular smooth<br>
muscle cells and thus reduces intimal hypertrophy.<br>
An FGF2 chimeric protein bound to a molecule such as<br>
saporin inhibits the proliferation of the vascular<br>
smooth muscle cells in vitro and intimal hypertrophy<br>
in vivo (Epstein C.E., Siegall C.B., Biro S., Fu Y.M.<br>
and FitzGerald D., Circulation, (1991), Vol. 87,<br>
pp. 84-778; Waltenberger J., Circulation, (1997),<br>
pp. 96-4083).<br>
Thus, antagonists for FGF receptors, such as the<br>
compounds of the present invention, represent a therapy<br>
of choice, either alone or in combination with<br>
antagonist compounds for other growth factors involved<br>
in these pathologies, such as PDGF, in the treatment of<br>
pathologies related to the proliferation of the<br>
vascular smooth muscle cells, such as atherosclerosis<br>
or post-angioplasty restenosis, or subsequent to the<br>
fitting of endovascular prostheses (stents) or during<br>
aortocoronary bypasses.<br>
Cardiac hypertrophy occurs in response to a stress on<br>
the ventricular wall induced by overloading in terms of<br>
pressure or volume. This overloading can be the<br><br>
WO 2006/097625	- 40 -	PCT/FR2006/000567<br>
consequence of numerous physiopathological conditions,<br>
such as hypertension, AC (aortic coarctation),<br>
myocardial infarction and various vascular disorders.<br>
The consequences of this pathology are morphological,<br>
molecular and functional changes, such as hypertrophy<br>
of the cardiac myocytes, accumulation of matrix<br>
proteins and the re-expression of fetal genes. b-FGF is<br>
involved in this pathology. This is because the<br>
addition of b-FGF to cultures of neonatal rat<br>
cardiomyocytes modifies the profile of the genes<br>
corresponding to the contractile proteins, resulting in<br>
a profile of genes of fetal type. Additionally, adult<br>
rat myocytes show a hypertrophic response under the<br>
effect of b-FGF, this response being blocked by anti-<br>
b-FGF neutralizing antibodies. Experiments carried out<br>
in vivo on b-FGF knockout transgenic mice show that<br>
b-FGF is the major stimulating factor of the<br>
hypertrophy of the cardiac myocytes in this pathology<br>
(Schultz JeJ, Witt S.A., Nieman M.L., Reiser P.J.,<br>
Engle S.J., Zhou M. et al. , J.Clin. Invest., (1999),<br>
Vol. 19, pp. 104-709).<br>
Thus, a compound, such as the compounds of the present<br>
invention, possessing an antagonist activity for the<br>
FGF receptors represents a therapy of choice in the<br>
treatment of cardiac insufficiency and any other<br>
pathologies associated with degeneration of the cardiac<br>
tissue. This treatment can be carried out alone or in<br>
combination with current treatments (beta-blockers,<br>
diuretics, angiotensin antagonists, antiarrhythmics,<br>
calcium antagonists, antithrombotics, and the like) .<br>
The vascular disorders due to diabetes are<br>
characterized by a detrimental change in the vascular<br>
reactivity and in the blood flow, hyperpermeability, an<br>
exacerbated proliferative response and an increase in<br>
deposits of matrix proteins. More specifically, a-FGF<br>
and b-FGF are present in the preretinal membranes of<br><br>
WO 2006/097625	- 41 -	PCT/FR2006/000567<br>
patients having diabetic retinopathy, in the membranes<br>
of the underlying capillaries and in the vitreous<br>
humour of patients suffering from proliferative<br>
retinopathy. A soluble FGF receptor capable of binding<br>
to both a-FGF and b-FGF is developed in vascular<br>
disorders related to diabetes (Tilton R.G.,<br>
Dixon R.A.F. and Brock T.A., Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs,<br>
(1997), Vol. 84, pp. 6-1671). Thus, a compound, such as<br>
the compounds of formula I, possessing an antagonist<br>
activity for FGF receptors represents a therapy of<br>
choice, either alone or in association with compounds<br>
which are antagonists for other growth factors involved<br>
in these pathologies, such as VEGF.<br>
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease with an<br>
unknown etiology. While it affects numerous organs, the<br>
severest form of RA is a progressive synovial<br>
inflammation of the joints resulting in their<br>
destruction. Angiogenesis appears to significantly<br>
affect the progression of this pathology. Thus, a-FGF<br>
and b-FGF have been detected in the synovial tissue and<br>
in the joint fluid of patients affected by RA,<br>
indicating that this growth factor is involved in the<br>
initiation and/or the progression of this pathology. In<br>
adjuvant-induced models of arthritis (AIA) in the rat,<br>
it has been shown that the overexpression of b-FGF<br>
increases the seriousness of the disease, whereas an<br>
anti-b-FGF neutralizing antibody blocks the progression<br>
of RA (Yamashita A., Yonemitsu Y., Okano S.,<br>
Nakagawa K., Nakashima Y., Irisa T. et al.,<br>
J. Immunol., (2002), Vol. 57, pp. 168-450; Manabe N. ,<br>
Oda H., Nakamura K., Kuga Y., Uchida S. and<br>
Kawaguchi H., Rheumatol., (1999), Vol. 20, pp. 38-714).<br>
Thus, the compounds according to the invention<br>
represent a therapy of choice in this pathology.<br>
It has also been described that the levels of growth<br>
factors having a proangiogenic activity, such as FGF1<br><br>
WO 2006/097625	- 42 -	PCT/FR2006/000567<br>
and 2, were greatly increased in the synovial fluid of<br>
patients affected by osteoarthritis. In this type of<br>
pathology, a significant modification in the balance<br>
between the pro- and antiangiogenic factors is<br>
recorded, resulting in the formation of new vessels and<br>
consequently the vascularization of nonvascularized<br>
structures, such as articular cartilages or<br>
intervertebral disks. Thus, angiogenesis represents a<br>
key factor in bone formation (osteophytes) , thus<br>
constributing to the progression of the disease.<br>
Additionally, the innervation of the new vessels may<br>
also contribute to the chronic pain associated with<br>
this pathology (Walsh D.A., Curr. Opin., Rheumatol.,<br>
2004 Sept., 16(5), 609-15). Thus, the compounds<br>
according to the invention represent a therapy of<br>
choice in this pathology.<br>
IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) comprises two forms of<br>
chronic inflammatory diseases of the intestine: UC<br>
(ulcerative colitis) and Crohn's disease (CD) . IBD is<br>
characterized by an immune dysfunction which is<br>
reflected by inappropriate production of inflammatory<br>
cytokines, resulting in the establishment of a local<br>
microvascular system. The consequence of this<br>
angiogenesis of inflammatory origin is an intestinal<br>
ischemia induced by vasoconstriction. High circulating<br>
and local levels of b-FGF have been measured in<br>
patients affected by these pathologies (Kanazawa S.,<br>
Tsunoda T., Onuma E., Majima T., Kagiyama M. and<br>
Kkuchi K., American Journal of Gastroenterology,<br>
(2001), Vol. 28, pp. 96-822; Thorn M. , Raab Y.,<br>
Larsson A., Gerdin B. and Hallgren R., Scandinavian<br>
Journal of Gastroenterology, (2000), Vol. 12,<br>
pp. 35-408). The compounds of the invention exhibiting<br>
a high antiangiogenic activity in a model of<br>
inflammatory angiogenesis represent a therapy of choice<br>
in these pathologies.<br><br>
WO 2006/097625	- 43 -	PCT/FR2006/000567<br>
FGF-1, -2 and -3 receptors are involved in<br>
chronogenesis and osteogenesis processes. Mutations<br>
resulting in the expression of always activated FGFRs<br>
have been related to a large number of human genetic<br>
diseases reflected by malformations of the skeleton,<br>
such as Pfeiffer, Crouzon's, Apert's, Jackson-Weiss and<br>
Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndromes. Some of these<br>
mutations which affect more particularly the FGF-3<br>
receptor result in particular in achondroplasia (ACH),<br>
hypochondroplasia (HCH) and TD (thanatophoric<br>
dysplasia); ACH being the commonest form of dwarfism.<br>
From a biochemical viewpoint, the sustained activation<br>
of these receptors takes place by dimerization of the<br>
receptor in the abscence of ligand (Chen L. , Adar R.,<br>
Yang X., Monsonego E.O., Li C, Hauschka P.V., Yagon A.<br>
and Deng C.X., (1999), The Journ. of Clin. Invest.,<br>
Vol. 104, No. 11, pp. 1517-1525). Thus, the compounds<br>
of the invention which exhibit an antagonist activity<br>
for the binding of b-FGF to the FGF receptor and which<br>
thus inhibit the dimerization of the receptor represent<br>
a therapy of choice in these pathologies.<br>
Furthermore, it is known that the adipose tissue is one<br>
of the rare tissues which, in the adult, can grow or<br>
regress. This tissue is highly vascularized and a very<br>
dense network of microvessels surrounds each adipocyte.<br>
These observations have resulted in the testing of the<br>
effect of antiangiogenic agents on the development of<br>
the adipose tissue in the adult. Thus, it appears that,<br>
in pharmacological models in the ob/ob mouse, the<br>
inhibition of angiogenesis is reflected by a<br>
significant loss in weight of the mice (Rupnick M.A. et<br>
al., (2002), PNAS, Vol. 99, No. 16, pp. 10730-10735).<br>
Thus, a compound which is an antagonist for the FGF<br>
receptors possessing a powerful antiangiogenic activity<br>
may represent a therapy of choice in pathologies<br>
related to obesity.<br><br>
WO 2006/097625	- 44 -	PCT/FR2006/000567<br>
By virtue of their toxicity and their pharmacological<br>
and biological properties, the compounds of the present<br>
invention have application in the treatment of any<br>
carcinoma which has a high degree of vascularization<br>
(lung, breast, prostate, esophagus) or which induces<br>
metastases (colon, stomach, melanoma) or which is<br>
sensitive to a-FGF or to b-FGF in autocrine fashion or,<br>
finally, in pathologies of lymphoma and leukemia type.<br>
These compounds represent a therapy of choice, either<br>
alone or in combination with an appropriate<br>
chemotherapy. The compounds according to the invention<br>
also have application in the treatment of<br>
cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis or<br>
post-angioplasty restenosis, in the treatment of<br>
diseases related to the complications which appear<br>
subsequent to the fitting of endovascular prostheses<br>
and/or aortocoronary bypasses or other vascular grafts,<br>
and cardiac hypertrophy, or vascular complications of<br>
diabetes, such as diabetic retinopathy. The compounds<br>
according to the invention also have application in the<br>
treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as<br>
rheumatoid arthritis or IBD. Finally, the compounds<br>
according to the invention can be used in the treatment<br>
of achondroplasia (ACH), hypochondroplasia (HCH) and TD<br>
(thanatophoric dysplasia), and also in the treatment of<br>
obesity.<br>
The products according to the invention also have<br>
application in the treatment of macular degeneration,<br>
in particular age-related macular degeneration (or<br>
AMD) . A major feature of the loss of vision in the<br>
adult is neovascularization and the resulting<br>
hemorrhages, which cause major functional disorders in<br>
the eye and which are reflected by early blindness.<br>
Recently, the study of the mechanisms involved in the<br>
phenomena of ocular neovascularization has made it<br>
possible to demonstrate the involvement of<br>
proangiogenic factors in these pathologies. By<br><br>
WO 2006/097625	- 45 -	PCT/FR2006/000567<br>
employing a laser-induced choroidal neoangiogenesis<br>
model, it has been possible to confirm that the<br>
products according to the invention also make it<br>
possible to modulate the neovascularization of the<br>
choroid.<br>
Furthermore, the products of the invention can be used<br>
in the treatment or prevention of thrombopenia due in<br>
particular to anticancer chemotherapy. This is because<br>
it has been shown that the products of the invention<br>
can improve the levels of circulating platelets during<br>
chemotherapy.<br>

Example 2 00<br>
Model of inflammatory angiogenesis in the mouse<br>
Angiogenesis is required for the development of chronic<br>
inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or<br>
IBD, but also for the development of solid tumors. The<br>
formation of new vessels makes possible not only the<br>
perfusion of pathological tissues but also the<br>
transportation of cytokines responsible for<br>
establishing the chronicity of the disease.<br>
The model described by Colville-Nash P. et al.<br>
(D. JPET., 1995, Vol. 274, No. 3, pp. 1463-1472) makes<br>
it possible to study pharmacological agents capable of<br>
modulating the appearance of angiogenesis.<br>
The animals, nonconsanguineous white mice weighing<br>
approximately 25 g, are anesthetized with sodium<br>
pentobarbital (60 mg/kg; Sanofi Nutrition Sante<br>
Animale) by the intraperitoneal route.<br>
An air pouch is created on the back of the mouse by<br>
injecting 3 ml of air subcutaneously.<br>
After waking up, the animals receive a treatment,<br>
generally by force feeding, and receive an injection of<br>
0.5 ml of Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) with 0.1% croton<br>
oil (Sigma) into the pouch.<br>
Seven days later, the mice are again anesthetized and<br>
placed on a heating plate at 40°C. One ml of carmine<br>
red (5% in 10% gelatin, Aldrich Chemicals) is injected<br>
into the tail vein. The animals are subsequently placed<br>
at 4°C for 2-3 hours.<br>
The skins are subsequently removed and dried in an oven<br>
at 56°C for 48 hours. The dried tissues are weighed and<br>
placed in 1.8 ml of digestion buffer (2 mM<br><br>
WO 2006/097625	- 104 -	PCT/FR2006/000567<br>
dithiothreitol, 20 mM Na2HPO4, 1 mM EDTA, 12 U/ml<br>
papain) for 24 hours.<br>
The stain is then dissolved in 0.2 ml of 5M NaOH. The<br>
skins are centrifuged at 2000 g for 10 min. The<br>
supernatants are filtered through 0.2 -urn cellulose<br>
acetate membranes. The filtrates are read in a<br>
spectrophotometer at 492 nm against a carmine red<br>
calibration series.<br>
Two parameters are studied: the dry weight of the<br>
granuloma and the amount of stain after digestion of<br>
the tissues.<br>

Model of Matrigel angiogenesis in the mouse<br>
The model described by Passaniti et al. (Laboratory<br>
Investigation, (1992) 67(4), pp. 519-524) makes it<br>
possible to study pharmacological agents capable of<br>
modulating the appearance of the angiogenesis<br>
specifically induced by b-FGF. FGF2 (Peprotech) is<br>
added, in a proportion of 300 ng/ml, to Matrigel<br>
(Beckton Dickinson) maintained in the liquid form at<br>
4°C. After homogenization, the mixture (0.5 ml) is<br>
injected subcutaneous ly into the base of the back of<br>
female black mice (C57/B16) weighing approximately 20 g<br>
anesthetized beforehand with sodium pentobarbital<br>
(60 mg/kg; Sanofi Nutrition Sante Animale)<br>
intraperitoneally. The animals are treated by force<br><br>
WO 2006/097625	- 105 -	PCT/FR2006/000567<br>
feeding. After 5 days, the mice are again anesthetized<br>
and the skin of the base of the back is removed; at<br>
this stage, the qualitative differences in<br>
vascularization of the granuloma are evaluated (awarded<br>
scores) and the granulomas are photographed. An assay<br>
of DNA in the granulomas is subsequently carried out in<br>
order to quantify its cellularity. For this, the<br>
isolated granulomas are digested with collagenase<br>
(3 mg/ml) at 37°C overnight. After centrifuging at<br>
850 g for 10 min, the supernatant is discarded and the<br>
pellet is redissolved in 1.2 ml of PBS buffer<br>
containing 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2 and 5 mM glucose. The<br>
amount of DNA present is measured using a kit<br>
(Cyquant-GR®, Molecular probe) according to the<br>
instructions of the supplier.<br>
The results are expressed as mean values (± SEM) . The<br>
differences between the groups are tested with an ANOVA<br>
followed by a Dunnett's test for which the reference<br>
group is the "solvent control" group.<br>
For the histological studies, the granulomas are<br>
removed with the muscle and the skin, fixed overnight<br>
in a 10% formaldehyde solution and embedded in paraffin<br>
(Embedder Leica®) . The granulomas are subsequently<br>
sliced using a microtome (Leica) and stained with<br>
Masson's trichrome stain. The neovascularization of the<br>
granulomas is then evaluated. The vascularization<br>
levels are between a value of 0 and a value of 5.<br>

route at doses of 0.1 to 30 mg/kg.<br>

Model of tumor angiogenesis in the mouse<br>
This model makes it possible to study pharmacological<br>
agents capable of modulating the appearance of the<br><br>
WO 2006/097625	- 106 -	PCT/FR2006/000567<br>
angiogenesis specifically induced by tumor development.<br>
C56/B16 mice weighing approximately 20 g are<br>
anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg;<br>
Sanofi Nutrition Sante Animale) intraperitoneally. The<br>
tumors are established by subcutaneous injection on the<br>
back of mouse Lewis lung cells in a proportion of<br>
2 x 105 cells/mouse. After 5 days, the mice are treated<br>
daily by force feeding. The size of the tumors is<br>
measured twice weekly for 21 days and the tumor volume<br>
is calculated using the formula: [/6 (1 x 2 x 2)],<br>
where  represents the greatest diameter and co2<br>
represents the smallest diameter.<br>
The results are expressed as mean values (± SEM) . The<br>
differences between the groups are tested with an ANOVA<br>
followed by a Dunnett's test for which the reference<br>
group is the "solvent control" group.<br>

Effect on thrombopenia<br>
Thrombopenia remains a pathology for which few<br>
effective treatments exist apart from the transfusion<br>
of platelet concentrates and thrombopoietin<br>
(Kaushansky, K. , New Eng. J. Med. , (1998), 339,<br>
pp. 746-754).<br>
Anticancer chemotherapy constitutes one of the major<br>
causes of thrombopenia. One of the agents of<br>
chemotherapy, carboplatin, has been widely used to<br>
induce thrombopenia in the mouse and to be able thus to<br>
characterize the effect of compounds capable of<br>
improving the level of platelets, such as, for example,<br>
thrombopoietin (Hokom M.M. et al. , Blood, (1995), 86,<br>
pp. 4486-4492).<br><br>
WO 2006/097625	- 107 -	PCT/FR2006/000567<br>
150 mg/kg of carboplatin were administered<br>
intraperitoneally to balbC mice having a weight of<br>
20 g. A blood sample is taken periodically by retro-<br>
orbital puncture and the level of circulating platelets<br>
is determined by a hematology automated machine (MS9™<br>
from Melet-Schloesing Laboratoires, Cergy-Pontoise,<br>
France). Under these conditions, reversible<br>
thrombopenia is observed with a nadir situated 9 to 10<br>
days after the administration of carboplatin (reduction<br>
in the level of circulating platelets of 50-60%).<br>
The compounds according to the invention or their<br>
solvent (a blank-control) are administred by the oral<br>
route for 5 days, the treatment being begun 7 days<br>
before the administration of carboplatin. The<br>
experiments are carried out on batches comprising 10-12<br>
mice and the results are expressed as a mean ± standard<br>
error. Under these conditions, the compounds of the<br>
invention increase the level of circulating platelets<br>
at doses of 0.1 to 30 mg/kg.<br>

Model of CNV (choroidal neovascularization) induced by<br>
an argon laser in the mouse<br>
A major characteristic of the loss of ocular<br>
transparency is neovascularization and the resulting<br>
hemorrhages, which cause major functional disorders in<br>
the eye and which are effected by early blindness.<br>
Recently, the study of the mechanisms involved in the<br>
phenomena of ocular neovascularization has made it<br>
possible to demonstrate the involvement of<br>
proangiogenic factors in these pathologies.<br>
The model of laser-induced choroidal neoangiogenesis<br>
described by Rakic J.M. et al. in Invest. Ophthalmol.<br>
Vis. Sci., (2003), Jul., 44(7), pp. 3186-3193) makes it<br><br>
WO 2006/097625	- 108 - PCT/FR2006/000567<br>
possible to study pharmacological agents capable of<br>
modulating the neovascularization of the choroid.<br>
The mice are anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection<br>
of Avertin™. The two pupils are dilated with a 1%<br>
tropicamide solution by topical application, and three<br>
lesions are made around the optic disc using an argon<br>
laser (532 nml; spot size diameter 50 m; duration<br>
0.05 sec; 400 nW) . The optic disc is subsequently<br>
covered with a lens.<br>
14 days later, the mice are sacrificed and the eyes are<br>
enucleated and fixed in a buffer containing 3.5%<br>
Formalin™, wrapped in TeK™ tissue (Miles Laboratories,<br>
Naperville, Illinois) and frozen in liquid nitrogen so<br>
as to be able to produce sections using a cryostat.<br>
The choroidal neovascularization was quantified by a<br>
quantitative morphometric study which makes it possible<br>
to evaluate the thickness of the network of neovessels<br>
present in the choroid using a computer-assisted image<br>
analysis system (Olympus Micro Image version 3.0 for<br>
Windows 95/NT, Olympus Optical Co. Europe GmBH).<br>
Neovascularization is estimated by the ratio (B/C) of<br>
the thickness of the pigmented layer of the choroid in<br>
the lesion (B) to the thickness of this same pigmented<br>
layer in a region adjacent to the lesion (C) . The<br>
results are expressed as mean values (+ SEM). The<br>
differences between the treated groups and the control<br>
groups are tested with an ANOVA followed by a Dunnett's<br>
test for which the reference group is the "control<br>
solvent" group.<br>

route at doses of 0.1 to 3 0 mg/kg.<br><br>
