NITROGEN-CONTAINING SIX-MEMBERED AROMATIC RING DERIVATIVES AND<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS CONTAINING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a novel compound and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof that have the ability to<br>
promote axonal outgrowth in combination with the ability to promote<br>
angiogenesis and are thus effective in reducing or treating central<br>
nerve injuries such as head injury and spinal cord injury, cerebral<br>
infarction, ischemic heart diseases such as myocardial infarction<br>
and organic angina, peripheral arterial occlusive diseases such as<br>
critical limb ischemia, or after-effects of these diseases, or other<br>
diseases against which the compounds of the present invention are<br>
considered effective.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2005-239711 (Patent<br>
Document 1) states as follows:<br>
"The progress in the study of regulatory factors of angiogenesis has<br>
led to therapeutic applications of these factors. Among those<br>
factors known to promote angiogenesis are vascular endothelial<br>
growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and<br>
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). These growth factors and their<br>
genes are now being used to treat diseases that require improvement<br>
in the blood circulation (such as arteriosclerosis obliterance and<br>
ischemic heart diseases).<br>
However, these growth factors are proteins and are therefore<br>
difficult to administer orally. They also pose other problems<br>
regarding anaphylactic responses caused by repeated administration,<br>
safety of viral vectors used in gene therapies, and side effects<br>
such as edema. Hence, there is a need for the development of new<br>
treatments."<br>
[0003]<br>
Certain diseases are known to be caused by an organic disorder<br>
associated with neurite retraction and loss of synapses, though<br>
their etiology may vary from disease to disease. Such diseases<br>
include Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, cerebrovascular<br>
dementia, senile dementia, Lewy body disease, Parkinson's disease<br>
and Huntington's disease.<br>
Central nerve injuries such as cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral<br>
infarction, brain tumor, head injury and spinal cord injury can also<br>
be caused by an organic disorder associated with neurite retraction<br>
and loss of synapses.<br>
Different medicines for these diseases have been developed<br>
that act to protect neurons by different mechanisms.<br>
[0004]<br>
None of these medicines provide a fundamental treatment for<br>
these diseases and are less than satisfactory though they may delay<br>
the progress of the disease to some extent. In particular, there is<br>
no effective treatment for cerebral infarction that is currently<br>
used worldwide other than tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).<br>
Although several medicines currently under development are<br>
designed to act to protect neurons, none of them are directed to<br>
actively promoting the recovery of nerve function after cerebral<br>
infarction.<br>
Regeneration of neural stem cells has attracted much attention<br>
and many studies are being conducted in an effort to implant the<br>
cells. As far as the treatment of cerebral infarction is concerned;<br>
however, the implanted neural stem cells fail to serve as neurons to<br>
form neural networks since the neural stem cells have a small chance<br>
of survival after implantation or they may not differentiate into<br>
neurons.<br>
[0005]<br>
Recent studies suggest that vascular remodeling such as<br>
angiogenesis is essential to the generation and regeneration, as<br>
well as to the following differentiation and maturation of neural<br>
stem cells and other cells following cerebral infarction (Non-Patent<br>
Document 1: J. Clin. Invest.,: 114, 2004). Thus, an effective<br>
treatment for cerebral infarction is required not only to provide<br>
direct protection of neurons to prevent the progress of neuronal<br>
damage, but also to promote axonal outgrowth required for<br>
regeneration/remodeling of vascular networks and reconstruction of<br>
new neural networks in the damaged ischemic penumbra (Non-Patent<br>
Document 2: Science, 3:272 (5262), p664-666 (1996)).<br>
[0006]<br>
Under such circumstances, a low-molecular-weight compound that<br>
can act to promote axonal outgrowth and promote angiogenesis and<br>
that can be orally administered is considered a potential drug<br>
effective in reducing or treating central nerve injuries such as<br>
head injury and spinal cord injury, cerebral infarction, ischemic<br>
heart diseases such as myocardial infarction and organic angina,<br>
peripheral arterial occlusive diseases such as critical limb<br>
ischemia, and after-effects of these diseases, as well as other<br>
diseases against which such a compound is considered effective. Such<br>
a compound is also considered a potential drug effective in reducing<br>
or treating symptoms resulting from a functional or organic disorder<br>
of the brain, including cerebral ischemic injuries, such as after-<br>
effects of cerebral infarction, cerebral hemorrhage and cerebral<br>
arteriosclerosis, as well as diseases associated with an organic<br>
disorder resulting from senile dementia, Alzheimer's disease,<br>
Parkinson's disease, and after-effects of brain injury, spinal cord<br>
injuries and brain surgery.<br>
It is believed that the above-described compound that can<br>
promote angiogenesis would effectively act in occluded lesions found<br>
in peripheral arterial occlusive diseases, such as arteriosclerosis<br>
obliterance, Buerger's disease and Raynaud's disease. It is<br>
considered that the compound is particularly effective against<br>
critical limb ischemia and other severe symptoms against which<br>
conventional medications have no effect.<br>

It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the<br>
functional groups such as hydroxyl groups and amino groups of the<br>
starting reagents or intermediate compounds of the process of the<br>
present invention may be protected by a protective group and the<br>
production of the compounds of the formula (I) involves addition of<br>
one or more such protective groups at a suitable point and removal<br>
of the protective group at a suitable point of any subsequent<br>
processes.<br>

[0047]<br>
The compounds and intermediates of the present invention can<br>
be isolated from the reaction mixture using standard methods and, if<br>
necessary, may further be purified.<br>
[0048]<br>
Each of the reaction processes will now be described in detail.<br>
[0049]<br>
[Reaction process (a) ]<br>
This reaction process is specifically shown by the following<br>
reaction scheme:<br>
[0050]<br><br>
[0051]<br>
In the reaction scheme above, R0 to R7, E, Nx, n, X, Y and Q<br>
are as described above.<br>
The substituent R9 is an alkyl group, such as a methyl group,<br>
an ethyl group, a tert-butoxy group and a benzyl group. The<br>
substituents L1 and L2 are each a leaving group that can be easily<br>
replaced with an amino group or a hydroxyl group. Specific examples<br>
thereof include a halogen atom, such as a chlorine atom, a bromine<br>
atom and an iodine atom; an alkylsulfonyloxy group, such as a<br>
methanesulfonyloxy group and a trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy group;<br>
and an arylsulfonyloxy group, such as a p-toluenesulfonyloxy group<br>
and 3-nitrobenzenesulfonyloxy group.<br>
[0052]<br>
The present process essentially involves the reaction of a<br>
compound (II-a) with an ester derivative (III-a) to give a compound<br>
(IV-a), which in turn is hydrolyzed to produce a carboxylic compound<br>
(IV-b). Subsequently, the resulting compound (IV-b) is subjected to<br>
a condensation reaction with an amine derivative (V) to give a<br>
desired compound (I), which forms one aspect of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Alternatively, the compound (IV-a) may be obtained by<br>
converting the compound (II-a) into the compound (II-b) followed by<br>
reacting it with an ester derivative (III-b).<br>
[0053]<br>
When it is necessary to protect functional groups, such as a<br>
hydroxyl group and an amino group, in this reaction process, the<br>
process may include a process for adding one or more such protective<br>
groups at a suitable step and a removal process of the protective<br>
group at a subsequent step.<br>
For example, when R0 in the compound (I) is an -NR3R4 with R3 or<br>
R4 being a methyloxycarbonyl group, an ethyloxycarbonyl group, a<br>
tert-butyloxycarbonyl group, a benzyloxycarbonyl group, a benzyl<br>
group or each an oxygen atom to serve as a protective group on the<br>
nitrogen atom, the protective group may be removed or converted into<br>
other functional groups to give the desired compound (I) that has R3<br>
and/or R4 converted into a hydrogen atom. This reaction process can<br>
be involved in the present reaction processes.<br>
[0054]<br>
The respective processes are described in further detail in<br>
the following.<br>
Process 1:<br>
The compounds of the formula (II-a) and the ester derivatives<br>
of the formula (III-a) to serve as the starting material of the<br>
present process are commercially available ones or they may be<br>
obtained by using known methods.<br>
The compound (II-a) can be obtained according to a method or a<br>
suitable combination of methods or by applying methods described, for<br>
example, in Heterocyclic Compound New Edition, Introduction,<br>
Yamanaka Hiroshi, Sakamoto Norio et al., Kodansha Scientific (2004),<br>
and Heterocyclic Compound New Edition, Application, Yamanaka Hiroshi,<br>
Sakamoto Norio et al., Kodansha Scientific (2004).<br>
[0055]<br>
Examples of the ester derivative (III-a) include ethyl<br>
bromoacetate, ethyl 2-bromopropionate and ethyl 2-bromo-2-<br>
methylpropionate.<br>
In the present process, as a first step thereof the compound<br>
(II-a) is reacted with the ester derivative (III-a) to give the<br>
compound (IV-a).<br>
[0056]<br>
The reaction can be carried out by mixing the compound (II-a)<br>
with 1.0 to 1.5 equivalents of the ester derivative (III-a) at -20°C<br>
to 150°C, and preferably at 0°C to 100°C, in an inert solvent, such<br>
as benzene, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethylformaldehyde,<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide, acetonitrile, acetone, methanol, ethanol,<br>
isopropyl alcohol, tert-butyl alcohol, diethyl ether, ethylene<br>
glycol, methylene chloride or chloroform, and if necessary, in the<br>
presence of an organic base, such as triethylamine,<br>
diisopropylethylamine or pyridine, or an inorganic base, such as<br>
sodium, sodium hydride, potassium, potassium hydride, sodium<br>
ethoxide, potassium tert-butoxide, sodium carbonate, potassium<br>
carbonate, cesium carbonate, cesium fluoride, sodium bicarbonate or<br>
potassium bicarbonate.<br>
[0057]<br>
If necessary, the reaction may use a combination of organic<br>
bases and inorganic bases. Alternatively, sodium iodide, potassium<br>
iodide, tetrabutylammonium iodide or crown ether may be added.<br>
[0058]<br>
Processes 2 and 3<br>
These processes are used as an alternative process for<br>
synthesizing the compound (IV-a). Specifically, the compound (II-b)<br>
is first converted from the compound (II-a), and the resulting<br>
product is reacted with the ester derivative (III-b) to give the<br>
compound (IV-a).<br>
The conversion of the compound (II-a) (Process 2) may be<br>
carried out by various methods depending on the type of the<br>
substituent L2 of the compound (II-b). For example, when L2 is a<br>
halogen atom, such as a chlorine atom and a bromine atom, the<br>
compound (II-a) is reacted in the presence of both phosphorous<br>
oxychloride (POCl3) and phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) or in the<br>
presence of one of phosphorus oxychloride, phosphorus pentachloride,<br>
phosphorus oxybromide (POBr3), phosphorus pentabromide (PBr5), and<br>
the like. If necessary, the reaction may be carried out in an inert<br>
solvent, such as benzene, toluene, ethyl acetate, dioxane,<br>
chloroform or methylene chloride.<br>
[0059]<br>
When the leaving group L2 is an alkylsulfonyloxy group, such<br>
as a methanesulfoyloxy group or a trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy group;<br>
or an arylsulfonyloxy group, such as a p-toluenesulfonyloxy group or<br>
a 3-nitrobenzenesulfonyloxy group, the reaction is carried out by<br>
mixing the compound (II-a) with 1.0 to 1.5 equivalents of<br>
methanesulfonyl chloride (MsCl), p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (TsCl)<br>
or trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (Tf2O) at -20°C to 150°C, and<br>
preferably at 0°C to 100°C, in an inert solvent, such as toluene,<br>
ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, chloroform or acetonitrile,<br>
and if necessary, in the presence of an organic base, such as<br>
triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine or pyridine, or an inorganic<br>
base, such as sodium, sodium hydride, potassium, potassium hydride,<br>
sodium ethoxide, potassium tert-butoxide, sodium carbonate,<br>
potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate, cesium fluoride, sodium<br>
bicarbonate or potassium bicarbonate.<br>
[0060]<br>
While the resulting compound may be directly used in the<br>
subsequent process, it may be purified as desired by a known<br>
purification method, such as recrystallization and column<br>
chromatography, prior to the subsequent process.<br>
[0061]<br>
The compound (II-b) produced as described above is then<br>
reacted with the ester derivative (III-b) to be derivatized into the<br>
compound (IV-a) (Process 3).<br>
[0062]<br>
The reaction can be carried out by mixing the compound (II-b)<br>
with 1.0 to 1.5 equivalents of the ester derivative (III-b) at -20°C<br>
to 150°C, and preferably at 0°C to 100°C, in an inert solvent, such<br>
as benzene, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethylformaldehyde,<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide, acetonitrile, acetone, methanol, ethanol,<br>
isopropyl alcohol, tert-butyl alcohol, diethyl ether, ethylene<br>
glycol, methylene chloride or chloroform, and if necessary, in the<br>
presence of an organic base, such as triethylamine,<br>
diisopropylethylamine or pyridine, or an inorganic base, such as<br>
sodium, sodium hydride, potassium, potassium hydride, sodium<br>
ethoxide, potassium tert-butoxide, sodium carbonate, potassium<br>
carbonate, cesium carbonate, cesium fluoride, sodium bicarbonate or<br>
potassium bicarbonate.<br>
[0063]<br>
If necessary, sodium iodide, potassium iodide,<br>
tetrabutylammonium iodide or crown ether may be added to the<br>
reaction.<br>
[0064]<br>
The compound (III-b) for use in the reaction may be a<br>
commercial product or a known compound, or alternatively, can be<br>
easily synthesized by known methods.<br>
Specific examples of such compounds (III-b) include glycolic<br>
acid, methyl glycolate, ethyl glycolate, tert-butyl glycolate,<br>
benzyl glycolate, lactic acid, methyl lactate, ethyl lactate, tert-<br>
butyl lactate, benzyl lactate, 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid, methyl 2-<br>
hydroxyisobutyrate, ethyl 2-hydroxyisobutyrate, tert-butyl 2-<br>
hydroxyisobutyrate, glycine, glycine methyl ester, glycine ethyl<br>
ester, glycine tert-butyl ester, glycine benzyl ester, sarcosine,<br>
sarcosine methyl ester, sarcosine ethyl ester, sarcosine methyl<br>
ester, alanine, alanine methyl ester, alanine ethyl ester, alanine<br>
tert-butyl ester, alanine benzyl ester, N-methylalanine, 2-<br>
aminoisobutyric acid, methyl 2-aminoisobutyrate, ethyl 2-<br>
aminoisobutyrate, tert-butyl 2-aminoisobutyrate, benzyl 2-<br>
aminoisobutyrate and 2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid.<br>
[0065]<br>
Processes 4 and 5:<br>
The compound (IV-a) produced as described above is hydrolyzed<br>
by a known method (Process 4) to be converted into the carboxylic<br>
acid (IV-b), which in turn is subjected to amide condensation with<br>
the amine derivative (V) to give the amide (I).<br>
[0066]<br>
The compound (V) that can be used in the condensation reaction<br>
with the compound (IV-b) may be a known compound, or alternatively,<br>
can be easily synthesized by known methods.<br>
[0067]<br>
The conditions for the amidation reaction may be based on the<br>
methods described in Compendium for Organic Synthesis (Wiley-<br>
Interscience: A Division of John Wiley &amp; Sons).<br>
For example, the carboxylic acid derivative (IV-b) is treated<br>
with diethyl phosphorocyanidate (DEPC), diphenyl phosphorazidate<br>
(DPPA), dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 1-ethyl-3-(3-<br>
dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride, 2-iodo-1-methyl<br>
pyridinium, propanephosphonic acid anhydride, 2-chloro-l, 3-<br>
dimethylimidazolinium chloride, 2-chloro-1,3-dimethylimidazolinium<br>
hexafluorophosphate or benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-<br>
(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP reagent). When<br>
necessary, the reaction may be carried out in the presence of an<br>
organic or inorganic base. The amine derivative (V) is added either<br>
subsequently or prior to the reaction to give the amide (I).<br>
Alternatively, the carboxylic acid derivative (IV-b) may be<br>
converted into an active ester compound, such as an acid halide, a<br>
symmetric acid anhydride or a mixed acid anhydride, which in turn is<br>
reacted with the amine derivative (V) to give the amide derivative<br>
(I).<br>
[0068]<br>
When R0 in the resulting amide derivative (I) is an -NR3R4 and<br>
R3 or R4 is a methyloxycarbonyl group, an ethyloxycarbonyl group, a<br>
tert-butyloxycarbonyl group, a benzyloxycarbonyl group, a benzyl<br>
group or each an oxygen atom to serve as a protective group on the<br>
nitrogen atom, the protective group may be eliminated or converted<br>
into other functional groups to obtain the desired compound (I) that<br>
has R3 and/or R4 converted into a hydrogen atom. This may be an<br>
alternative reaction process.<br>
[0069]<br>
The reaction may be carried out by different methods depending<br>
on the type of the protective groups on the nitrogen atom of the<br>
compound (I). For example, a compound (I) in which R0 is an -NR3R4<br>
group with R3 or R4 being a benzyl group, a 4-methoxybenzyl group or<br>
a benzyloxycarbonyl group or R3 and R4 each being an oxygen atom,<br>
together forming a nitro group, may be hydrogenated in the presence<br>
of a catalyst, such as palladium carbon, palladium hydroxide on<br>
carbon, platinum or platinum oxide, in an inert solvent, such as<br>
methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, toluene, ethyl acetate,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, chloroform or acetic acid. Alternatively,<br>
the compound (I) may be reduced under an acidic condition using zinc<br>
or tin chloride.<br>
A compound (I) in which the protective group R3 or R4 is a<br>
tert-butoxycarbonyl group, an ethoxycarbonyl group, a 4-<br>
methoxybenzyl group, a 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl group, an acetyl group or<br>
a formyl group may be subjected to deprotection by treating with an<br>
acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic<br>
acid or sulfuric acid, in an inert solvent, such as methanol,<br>
ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, toluene, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran,<br>
dioxane, chloroform or acetonitrile.<br>
[0070]<br>
When necessary, the resulting compound (I) may be purified by<br>
a known purification method, such as recrystallization or column<br>
chromatography.<br>
[0071]<br>
[Reaction process (b)]<br>
The present process is specifically shown by the following<br>
chemical reaction scheme:<br>
[0072]<br>
(Chemical formula 12)<br>
[0073]<br>
In the reaction scheme above, R0 to R2, R5 to R7, E, Nx, n, X, Y,<br>
L2 and Q are as described above. The substituent R9 is a hydrogen<br>
atom and P is a protective group.<br>
Examples of the protective group include a benzyl group, a p-<br>
methoxybenzyl group, a tert-butoxycarbonyl group, an ethoxycarbonyl<br>
group, a benzyloxycarbonyl group and a p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl<br>
group.<br>
[0074]<br>
Specifically, a compound (V) is reacted with an ester<br>
derivative (III-b) to produce a compound (VI).<br>
In an alternative process for synthesizing the compound (VI),<br>
the compound (V) is reacted with an ester derivative (III-c) to give<br>
a compound (X), which in turn is converted into the compound (VI).<br>
Subsequently, the resulting compound (VI) is reacted with a<br>
compound (II-b) to give a desired compound (I), which forms one<br>
aspect of the present invention.<br>
[0075]<br>
When R0 in the resulting amide derivative (I) is an -NR3R4 with<br>
R3 or R4 being a methyloxycarbonyl group, an ethyloxycarbonyl group,<br>
a tert-butyloxycarbonyl group, a benzyloxycarbonyl group or a benzyl<br>
group or each an oxygen atom to serve as a protective group on the<br>
nitrogen atom, the protective group may be eliminated or converted<br>
into other functional groups to give the desired compound (I) that<br>
has R3 and/or R4 converted into a hydrogen atom. This may be an<br>
alternative reaction process.<br>
[0076]<br>
These respective processes are described in further detail in<br>
the following.<br>
Processes 6 and 7:<br>
The compound (III-b) or (III-c) to serve as the starting<br>
material of the present process are commercially available ones, or<br>
they may be obtained by using known methods.<br>
In the present process, as a first step thereof, the<br>
carboxylic acid (III-b) or (III-c) is subjected to amide<br>
condensation with the amine derivative (V) to give the amide (VI) or<br>
(X), respectively.<br>
[0077]<br>
The conditions for the amidation reaction may be based on the<br>
methods described in Compendium for Organic Synthesis (Wiley-<br>
Interscience: A Division of John Wiley &amp; Sons).<br>
For example, the carboxylic acid derivative (III-b) or (III-c)<br>
is treated with diethyl phosphorocyanidate (DEPC), diphenyl<br>
phosphorazidate (DPPA), dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 1-ethyl-3-<br>
(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride, 2-iodo-1-methyl<br>
pyridinium, propanephosphonic acid anhydride, 2-chloro-1,3-<br>
dimethylimidazolinium chloride, 2-chloro-1,3-dimethylimidazolinium<br>
hexafluorophosphate or benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-<br>
(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP reagent). When<br>
necessary, the reaction may be carried out in the presence of an<br>
organic or inorganic base. The amine derivative (III) is added<br>
either subsequently or prior to the reaction to obtain the amide<br>
(VI) or (X).<br>
Alternatively, the carboxylic acid derivative (III-b) or (III-<br>
c) may be converted into an active ester compound, such as an acid<br>
halide, a symmetric acid anhydride or a mixed acid anhydride, which<br>
in turn is reacted with the amine derivative (V) to give the amide<br>
(VI) or (X), respectively.<br>
[0078]<br>
Process 8:<br>
When the resulting product is the compound (X), it is<br>
subjected to deprotection and converted into the compound (VI).<br>
The deprotection may be carried out by different methods<br>
depending on the type of the protective group P of the compound (X).<br>
For example, when P is a benzyl group, a 4-methoxybenzyl group or a<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl group, the compound (X) is hydrogenated in the<br>
presence of a catalyst, such as palladium carbon, palladium<br>
hydroxide on carbon, platinum or platinum oxide, in an inert solvent,<br>
such as methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, toluene, ethyl acetate,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, chloroform or acetic acid. When the<br>
protective group P is a tert-butoxycarbonyl group, an ethoxycarbonyl<br>
group, a 4-methoxybenzyl group or a 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl group, the<br>
compound (X) is deprotected by treating with an acid, such as<br>
trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid or<br>
sulfuric acid, in an inert solvent, such as methanol, ethanol,<br>
isopropyl alcohol, toluene, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane,<br>
chloroform or acetonitrile.<br>
[0079]<br>
While the resulting compound may be directly used in the<br>
subsequent process, it may be purified as desired by a known<br>
purification method, such as recrystallization and column<br>
chromatography, prior to the subsequent process.<br>
[0080]<br>
Process 9:<br>
The compound (VI) produced as described above is reacted with<br>
the compound (II-b) to give the compound represented by the formula<br>
(I), which is the compound of the present invention.<br>
The compound (II-b) used in the present process is as<br>
described in the process 2. In this reaction, the compound (I) can<br>
be synthesized in the same manner as in the process 3.<br>
When necessary, the protective group on the nitrogen atom of<br>
the resulting amide derivative (I) may be eliminated or converted<br>
into other functional groups so that the amide derivative (I) can be<br>
converted into the compound represented by the formula (I), which is<br>
the compound of the present invention.<br>
In this reaction, the compound (I) can be synthesized in the<br>
same manner as in the reaction process (a).<br>
[0081]<br>
When necessary, the compounds obtained in the above-described<br>
reactions may be purified by a known purification method, such as<br>
recrystallization and column chromatography.<br>
[0082]<br>
[Reaction process (c)]<br>
The present process is specifically shown by the following<br>
chemical reaction scheme:<br>
[0083]<br>

such as myocardial infarction and organic angina, peripheral<br>
arterial occlusive diseases such as critical limb ischemia, and<br>
after-effects of these diseases, the compounds of the present<br>
invention are administered at a varying dose determined by the<br>
symptoms, severity of disease or age of patients to be treated and<br>
by whether the patient has complications. The dose may also vary<br>
depending on the route of administration, dosage form and dose<br>
frequency. For oral administration, the dose is typically from 0.1<br>
to 1000 mg/day/patient, and preferably from 1 to 500 mg/day/patient<br>
as measured in the amount of the active ingredient. For parenteral<br>
administration, the dose may be from one-hundredth to one-half the<br>
dose for oral administration. However, the preferred dose may be<br>
varied as desired, depending on the age, symptoms and other<br>
conditions of patients.<br>

Example 65: Production of 2-(5-amino-4,6-dimethylpyrimidine-2-<br>
yloxy)-N-(1-benzylpiperidine-4-yl)-N-methylacetamide (Compound 65)<br>
Compound 30 (calculated assuming that Compound 9 in the<br>
previous process was 74.74g and the yield of amidation was 80%) was<br>
dissolved in chloroform (140mL) . The solution was added to a 6N<br>
aqueous HC1 solution (530mL) at room temperature (20 to 30°C). The<br>
euipment used to add compound 30 was thoroughly washed with<br>
chloroform (240mL) and was then stirred at room temperature (20 to<br>
30°C) for 2.5 hours. After the chloroform layer was separated,<br>
chloroform (300mL) was added to the aqueous layer. While ice (740.7g<br>
in total) was added as necessary, a 4N aqueous sodium hydroxide<br>
solution (805mL) was added portionwise. An additional amount of 4N<br>
aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (25mL to adjust the pH of the<br>
aqueous layer to 8.5) was added, followed by the addition of<br>
chloroform (80mL), and separation was performed. After the<br>
chloroform layer was separated, chloroform (200mL) was added to the<br>
aqueous layer and separation was performed again. The chloroform<br>
layer collected in the two extraction processes was dried over<br>
magnesium sulfate and suction-filtered. The filtrate was then<br>
evaporated under reduced pressure to give 100.15g (103.9% yield, in<br>
2 steps) of the crude desired product as a pale yellow solid.<br>
Isopropanol (1020mL) was added to the resulting solid and the<br>
mixture was heated to 85°C to dissolve the solid. The mixture was<br>
stirred as it was allowed to cool. Once the temperature of heat bath<br>
reached 67°C, seeding was carried out and the mixture was kept<br>
stirred overnight. Subsequently, the mixture was stirred for 2 hours<br>
while it was cooled with ice, and was then suction-filtered. The<br>
resulting solid was washed with cold isopropanol (150mL) and dried<br>
to give 89.60g (92.9% yield, in 2 steps) of the desired compound<br>
(recrystallized from isopropanol) as colorless crystals.<br>
To the product (50.00g) recrystallized from isopropanol,<br>
ethanol (220mL) was added and the mixture was heated to 85°C to<br>
dissolve the product. The mixture was stirred as it was allowed to<br>
cool. Once the temperature of heat bath reached 65°C, seeding was<br>
carried out and the mixture was kept stirred overnight. Subsequently,<br>
the mixture was stirred for 2 hours while it was cooled with ice,<br>
and was then suction-filtered. The resulting solid was washed with<br>
cold isopropanol (100mL) and dried to give 48.18 (96% yield) of the<br>
desired product as white crystals.<br>

in rats<br>
Specific methods for evaluation are described below.<br>
[0278]<br>
Test Example 1: Ability to promote axonal outgrowth<br>
According to the method of M. P. Mattson [M. P. Mattson, Brain<br>
Res. Rev., 13, 179, (1988)], the hippocampal region was isolated<br>
from 18-day embryos of female Wistar rats and the neurons were<br>
dispersed using the papain dissociation system. Hippocampal neuron<br>
were suspended in 5% Nu-serum + B27 supplement + Neurobasal medium<br>
at 5 x 104 cells/well/2mL. 2mL of the cell suspension were<br>
inoculated on a poly-D-lysine-coated 36 0 dish and the neuron were<br>
incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.<br>
On day 3 of the incubation period, 1mL of the culture medium<br>
was replaced with 1mL of 5% Nu-serum + B27 supplement + Neurobasal<br>
medium containing 2mM AraC. Each test compound was added to the<br>
culture on day 3 and day 7 of the incubation period. On day 9, cells<br>
were fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution. The nerve axons of the<br>
fixed cells were stained with the Rabbit anti-growth-associated<br>
protein-43 polyclonal antibody and the stained cells were quantified<br>
using Kurabo neuron outgrowth-quantication software.<br>
[0279]<br>
The ability (%) of each test compound to promote axonal<br>
outgrowth was calculated from the following equation:<br>
The ability to promote axonal outgrowth (%) = [(measurement<br>
with a compound of interest)/(measurement of control)] x 100<br>
Example Compounds shown in Table 25 were used as test<br>
compounds and were each added at concentrations of 3µM and 0.3µM.<br>
The results are shown in Table 25. Although the measurements<br>
shown in Table 25 are mostly shown for the concentration of 3µM, the<br>
measurements obtained for the concentration of 0.3µM are shown for<br>
compounds that gave 120 (a value indicating a significant effect) or<br>
a higher measurement only at the concentration of 0.3µM or compounds<br>
that gave a significantly higher measurement at 0.3µM than at 3µM.<br>
Since bFGF gives a measurement of about 120 in this test, 120<br>
is used as the threshold to determine whether a given compound has<br>
the ability to promote axonal outgrowth<br>
[0280]<br>
[0281]<br>
As can be seen from Table 25, each of Example Compounds of the<br>
present invention showed about 120 (a value indicating a significant<br>
effect) or a higher measurement, indicating a significant ability to<br>
promote axonal outgrowth.<br>
[0282]<br>
Test Example 2: Ability to promote angiogenesis<br>
Using an angiogenesis test kit containing a mixture of human<br>
vascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts [KZ-1000; Kurabo], the<br>
ability of test compounds to promote angiogenesis was evaluated.<br>
Each test compound was added on days 1, 4, and 7 of the incubation<br>
period. On day 9, cells were immunostained with CD31 and<br>
photographed. Control cells were cultured under the same conditions,<br>
only without the addition of a test compound, and photographed.<br>
The lumen length of the blood vessel was quantified from the<br>
obtained images using an angiogenesis-quantification software. The<br>
ability (%) of each test compound to promote angiogenesis was<br>
calculated from the following equation:<br>
The ability to promote angiogenesis (%) = [(measurement with a<br>
compound of interest)/(measurement of control)] x 100<br>
Example Compounds shown in Table 26 were used as test<br>
compounds.<br>
The results are shown in Table 26. Although the measurements<br>
shown in Table 26 are mostly shown for the concentration of 3µM, the<br>
measurements obtained for the concentration of 0.3µM are shown for<br>
compounds that gave 120 (a value indicating a significant effect) or<br>
a higher measurement only at the concentration of 0.3µM or compounds<br>
that gave a significantly higher measurement at 0.3µM than at 3µM.<br>
Since bFGF gives a measurement of about 120 in this test, 120<br>
is used as the threshold to determine whether a given compound has<br>
the ability to promote angiogenesis.<br>
[0283]<br>
[0284]<br>
As can be seen from Table 26, each of Example Compounds of the<br>
present invention showed about 120 (a value indicating a significant<br>
effect) or a higher measurement, indicating a significant ability to<br>
promote angiogenesis.<br>
[0285]<br>
Test Example 3: Ability to promote the neurite outgrowth of spinal<br>
cord neurons<br>
According to the method of Martin G. Hanson Jr. [J. Neurosci.,<br>
1998 Sep. 15; 18(18): 7361-71], the spinal cord region was isolated<br>
from 15-day embryos of female Wistar rats and the cells were<br>
dispersed using the papain dissociation system. Neurons were<br>
collected using 6.8% Metrizamide density gradient and were suspended<br>
in 2%FBS + Leibovitz's -15 medium so that the density of the cells<br>
will be 2 x 103cells/well/200uL. 200uL of the cell suspension was<br>
inoculated on a poly-D-lysine/laminin-coated 96 well plate and the<br>
plate was incubated in an incubator at 37°C. Test compounds were<br>
added 1 hour after seeding of cells.<br>
On day 3 of the incubation period, neurons were stained with<br>
Calcein-AM and the lengths of neurites were determined using IN Cell<br>
Analyzer (GE Healthcare Bioscience).<br>
[0286]<br>
The ability (%) of each test compound to promote neurite<br>
outgrowth was calculated from the following equation:<br>
The ability to promote neurite outgrowth (%) = [(measurement<br>
with a compound of interest)/(measurement of control)] x 100<br>
Example Compounds 65, 71, 74, 92, 130 and 135 were used as<br>
test compounds and were each added at a concentration of 0.1µM.<br>
The results are shown in Table 27. bFGF gives a measurement<br>
of about 130 in this test. In Table 18, a value of 120 is used as<br>
the threshold to indicate that a given compound exhibits a<br>

Test Example 4: Evaluation of angiogenesis in a lower limb ischemia<br>
(critical limb ischemia) model in mice (in vivo test)<br>
According to the method of Ichiro Masaki [Circ Res.90; 966-973<br>
(2002)], the left femoral artery of Balb/c mice was excised to<br>
establish a model of critical limb ischemia (n = 29 to 30).<br>
Test compounds used were Example Compounds 65, 92, 114, 130,<br>
135 and 136, each of which was orally administered once daily at a<br>
dose of 0.1mg/kg or 1.0mg/kg for 10 days starting from the day of<br>
femoral artery excision. Once necrosis was observed in the lower<br>
limb of an animal, the observation of the individual was stopped and<br>
the survival rate of lower limb was monitored with time.<br>
[0290]<br>
The results are shown in Figs. 1 to 6 in which Figs. 1, 2, 3,<br>
4, 5 and 6 show the results of Example Compounds 65, 92, 114, 130,<br>
135 and 136, respectively.<br>

[0291]<br>
The results indicate that each of Example Compounds 65, 92,<br>
114, 130, 135 and 136 of the present invention resulted in an<br>
increased survival rate of the femoral artery/vein in lower limb and<br>
is therefore highly effective in ameliorating critical limb ischemia.<br>

Test Example 5: Ability to improve cardiac functions in a myocardial<br>
infarction model in rats<br>
According to the method of Masakatsu Wakeno et al.<br>
[Circulation 114: 1923-1932 (2006)], 10-week-oid male Sic:SD rats<br>
were anesthetized with pentobarbital and cut open in the chest area.<br>
The left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was completely<br>
occluded to establish a myocardial infarction model. Sham group<br>
underwent only thoracic surgical procedure.<br>
The test compound used was Example Compound 65, which was<br>
orally administered once daily at a dose of O.Olmg/kg, O.lmg/kg or<br>
l.Omg/kg for 28 days starting from the day of establishment of<br>
myocardial infarction model (after awakening from anesthesia).<br>
4 weeks after establishing myocardial infarction, animals were<br>
anesthetized with pentobarbital and monitored for their<br>
cardiachemodynamics using a mirror catheter. Subsequently, blood<br>
samples were collected from the abdominal aorta, wet lung weight was<br>
measured, and plasma BNP levels after arterial blood sampling were<br>
measured (RIA).<br>
[0293]<br>
The results are shown in Figs. 7 to 10.<br>
Figs. 7, 8, 9 and 10 show the results of LVEDP, LVdP/dt max,<br>
lung weight and plasma BMP levels, respectively.<br>
#: P 
test<br>
*: P 
[0294]<br>
Example Compound 65 suppressed the decrease in the maximum<br>
left ventricular contraction and the diastolic velocity following<br>
myocardial infarction, the increase in the end-diastolic pressure,<br>
and the increase in the wet lung weight, an indication of pulmonary<br>
congestion. The compound also suppressed the increase in the plasma<br>
BNP levels. These results demonstrate that Example Compound 65 of<br>
the present invention is highly effective in improving the decreased<br>
cardiac functions and heart failure associated with myocardial<br>
infarction.<br>
[0295]<br>
Test Example 6: Ability to improve functions in a rat microsphere<br>
(micro-embolism) model<br>
According to the method of Ichiro Date et al. [Journal of<br>
Neuroscience Research 78; 442-453 (2004)], 8-week-old male<br>
Crl:CD(SD) rats were used. Animals were anesthetized with halothane<br>
and midline incision was made. Right carotid artery was separated<br>
and a thread was looped around the common carotid artery and<br>
external carotid artery. The pterygopalatine artery was temporarily<br>
clipped with an aneurysm clip. The blood flow through the common<br>
carotid artery and external carotid artery was temporarily<br>
interrupted and 0.1mL of a microsphere suspension composed of<br>
microspheres dispersed in a 30% sucrose solution (1800<br>
microspheres/0.1mL) was injected into the common carotid artery.<br>
After injection of the suspension, the puncture of the injection<br>
needle was filled with instant glue while the blood flow was<br>
interrupted. The blood flow was then restored and the surgical wound<br>
was sutured. Neurological symptoms were observed the day following<br>
the surgery. The animals were assigned to each treated group at<br>
random with respect to the measurements of neurological symptoms,<br>
the decrease in body weight from the previous day, and the body<br>
weight on that day.<br>
The test compounds used were Example Compound 65, 108, 130,<br>
135 and 137, each of which was administered at a dose of 1.0mg/kg.<br>
Example Compound 65 was administered also at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg.<br>
Each compound was orally administered once daily for 10 days<br>
starting from the following day of the surgery. Coordinated motor<br>
functions were measured 5 times on an accelerated rota-rod (4 to 40<br>
rpm/5 min) 2 weeks after the surgery.<br>
As a standard parameter, the total time of the 5 measurements<br>
on rota-rod was summarized in Figs. 11 to 15.<br>
[0296]<br>
Specifically, Figs. 11 to 15 show the effect of different<br>
compounds 2 weeks after the microsphere injection (rota-rod test<br>
standard parameter). The figures show the results of rota-rod tests<br>
2 weeks after the ischemic event in which each compound was orally<br>
administered at 1.0mg/kg once daily for 10 days (Example Compound 65<br>
was administered at 0.1mg/kg or 1.0mg/kg). What is shown in the<br>
figures is the total time of the 5 measurements on rota-rod as a<br>
standard parameter.<br>
Figs. 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 show the results of Example<br>
Compounds 65, 108, 130, 135 and 137, respectively.<br>
***: p 
[0297]<br>
These results indicate that each of Example Compounds 65, 108,<br>
130, 135 and 137 of the present invention is highly effective in<br>
ameliorating ischemic cerebral infarction and after-effects thereof.<br>
According to an article by Kraft et al. (Eur. J. Neurosci.<br>
2005 Jun; 21(11): 3117-32), the experiment for Test Example 6 using<br>
microspheres to treat cerebral infarction caused by embolism serves<br>
as a suitable model for microvascular disorders, a sign of cognitive<br>
disorder. Thus, the results of Test Example 6 may indicate that the<br>
compounds of the present invention are effective in ameliorating<br>
dementia.<br>
[0298]<br>
Test Example 7: Ability to improve functions in a spinal cord injury<br>
(SCI) model in rats<br>
According to the method of Venkata Ramesh Dasari et al. [J<br>
Neurotrauma. 2007 Feb; 24(2):391-410], 9-week-old female Sic: SD<br>
rats were used. Animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital and<br>
incised along the dorsal midline. After the spinal column was<br>
exposed by dorsal midline incision, the 9th thoracic vertebral arch<br>
was removed with bone scissors, paying attention not to damage the<br>
dura mater. The upper and lower bones were held in place to position<br>
the exposed spinal site just under the impactor device (where impact<br>
is applied) and then a 200-kdyn force was applied to the site. Tonic<br>
extension of the lower limbs by the spinal cord injury was checked.<br>
The test compound used was Example Compound 65, which was<br>
administered at a dose of 1mg/kg. Specifically, the compound was<br>
administered through the tail vein once daily for 10 days, starting<br>
from 90 min after the surgery. The motor function of lower limb was<br>
evaluated by BBB score (Basso DM, Beattie MS, Bresnahan JC:J<br>
Neurotrauma. 1995;12:1-21) once a week until 5 weeks after surgery.<br>
The results are shown in Fig. 16.<br>
The results indicate that Example Compound 65 of the present<br>
invention is highly effective in ameliorating spinal cord injury.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>

cerebral infarction, ischemic heart diseases such as myocardial<br>
infarction and organic angina, peripheral arterial occlusive<br>
diseases such as critical limb ischemia or after-effects of these<br>
diseases, or other diseases against which the compounds of the<br>
present invention are considered effective. The present invention,<br>
therefore, is of significant medical importance.<br>
