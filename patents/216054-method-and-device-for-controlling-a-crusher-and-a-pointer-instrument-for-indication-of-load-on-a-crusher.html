Technical Field of the Invent ion<br>
The present invention relates to a method for controlling a cnisher at which<br>
material to be crushed is inserted into a gap between a first crushing means and a second<br>
crushing means.<br>
The present invention also relates to a pointer instrument for indication of the<br>
load on a crusher, which is of the kind mentioned above.<br>
The present invention also relates to a control system for control of the load<br>
on a crusher. which is of the kind mentioned above.<br>
Technical Background<br>
A crusher of the above-mentioned type may be utilized in order to crush hard<br>
material, such as pieces of rock material. It is desirable to be able to crush a large quantity<br>
of material in the crusher without risking that the crusher is exposed to such mechanical<br>
loads thai the frequency of breakdowns increases.<br>
WO 87/05828 discioses a method to decrease the risk: of increased<br>
mechanical load and breakdowns resulting therefrom. The number of pressure surges<br>
above a certain predetermined level that arise in the hydraulic fluid that controls the<br>
position of the crushing head are counted. If the count of pressure surges exceeds a<br>
predetermined amount, the relative position of the crushing shells is changed so that the<br>
width of the crushing gap increases. Preferably, the number of times thai the gap is<br>
increased during a predetermined time is also counted after which alarm is given if said<br>
number of times exceeds a predetermined amount.<br>
The method disclosed in WO 87/05828 may to a certain extern reducing the<br>
risk of the crusher breaking down prematurely, but does not increase the efficiency of the<br>
crusher as regards the amount of crashed material per unit of time<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method for controtting a<br>
crusher, which method increases the efficiency of the crusher in respect of accomplished<br><br>
3<br>
crushing work, which, for instance, may result in increased size reduction of a certain<br>
quantity of material or increased quantity of crushed material, in relation to the prior art<br>
technique. This object is attained by a method for controlling a crusher, which is of the<br>
kind mentioned above, which method is characterized by the following steps:<br>
a)	that the instantaneous load on the crusher is measured during at least one<br>
period of time to obtain a number of measured values,<br>
b)	that a representative value, which is representative of the highest measured<br>
instantaneous load during each such period of time, is calculated, and<br>
c)	that the representative value is compared to a desired value and that the<br>
load on the crusher is controlled depending on said comparison.<br>
An advantage of this method is that the control is based on a value that is<br>
representative of the highest instantaneous loads, also called the load peaks, on the crusher,<br>
i.e., the loads that involve highest risk of mechanical damage on the crusher. Thanks to<br>
this, an operator can be sure that the function of the crusher is not risked, irrespective of<br>
how the crusher is supplied with material. The operator can, by ensuring that the supply of<br>
material to the crusher becomes even as regards, among other things, quantity of material,<br>
moisture content, size distribution and hardness, decrease the highest instantaneous loads-<br>
Thereby, the crusher can operate at a high average load without increasing the risk of<br>
breakdown, In crushes that have an even supply and a material which does not cause high<br>
load peaks, the method according to the invention will mean that the crusher operates at a<br>
higher average load which means a higher efficiency, than what previously has been<br>
possible. In crushes that have an uneven supply, the method according to the invention will<br>
enable incentive to alter the supply so that it becomes more even with the purpose of<br>
providing a more efficient crushing. The control of desired value is normally a stable and<br>
safe type of control. Thus, the desired value is suitably selected to be the highest load that<br>
tthe crusher can operate at without increased risk of mechanical breakdown. Thus, the<br>
crusher can be utilized optimally without increasing the risk of breakdown in cases of<br>
uneven supply or unusually hard material. The desired value can be locked fay the one<br>
delivering the crusher, wherein the operator, which cannot affect the desired value, may<br>
make alterations in the supply of material with the purpose of increasing the efficiency of<br>
the crusher without, because of this, risking mechanical damage. In certain cases, it may,<br>
however, be appropriate to let the operator increase the desired value and consciously<br>
accept a calculated increase of the number of mechanical breakdowns in order to increase<br><br>
4<br>
the efficiency of the crusher farther, Also, other ways of choosing and/or controlling the<br>
desired value are possible.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, step a) also comprises that a sequence of<br>
data is formed, which data consist of determinations of the highest load on the crusher ia<br>
each one of said periods of time, which consist of a plurality of consecutive periods of<br>
time. The formation of a sequence of data, where each data is the highest load during a<br>
period of time included in the sequence, gives a control that in an advantageous way<br>
represents the highest loads. The division into periods of time makes, among other things,<br>
that occasional very high load peaks get a limited influence on said representative value.<br>
According to an even more preferred embodiment, said representative value is calculated<br>
in step b) as a mean value of data included in said sequence, A mean value gives a relevant<br>
picture of the load peaks for the control.<br>
Preferably, said periods of time follow immediately upon each other. An<br>
advantage of this is that also fast courses of events are recorded quickly and may be<br>
handled by the control, for instance a rapidly and heavily increasing load may quickly be<br>
compensated for, the risk of mechanical damage decreasing.<br>
Suitably, measured values are used continuously during operation of the crusher for<br>
forming a plurality of sequences of data. An advantage of this is that the control may be<br>
based on an almost continuous inflow of sequences and representative values calculated<br>
therefrom. The control may thereby quickly react on alterations in the operation of the<br>
crusher. Even more preferred is that upon calculation of said representative value of a<br>
current sequence, at least one data ia utilized concerning highest load that already has been<br>
utilized in an immediately preceding sequence. In this way, the sequences will overlap<br>
each other. An advantage of this is that said representative value will be calculated several<br>
times per unit of time. This means that the control more often receives new input data and<br>
makes that the control better can monitor the actual course in the: crusher.<br>
Preferably, all sequences include the same number of data concerning highest load.<br>
Preferably, said data amounts to at least five for each sequence. At least five data for each<br>
sequence makes that occasional very high or very low load peaks get a limited influence<br>
on said value, a desired damping of the control being provided.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, at Least the highest and/or the lowest of the<br>
data included in the sequence concerning, highest load is excluded upon calculation of said<br><br>
5 <br>
representative value of the same sequence. In this way, it is avoided that occasional very<br>
high and/or low values, which, for instance, may depend on erroneous measurements or<br>
occasional hard objects, gel an undesired large influence on the representative value that<br>
then is calculated for the current sequence.<br>
According to an even more preferred embodiment, at feast the highest as well as at<br>
least the two lowest values of the data included in the sequence concerning highest load<br>
are excluded upon calculation of said value of the same sequence, mone of the lowest than<br>
of the highest values being excluded. An advantage of this is that it is avoided that the<br>
control system "is fooled" to increase the load by virtue of a sequence randomly happening<br>
to contain a plurality of periods of time with relatively low highest loads, If these periods<br>
of time with low highest loads suddenly are followed by a very high highest load al the<br>
same time as the control system already ordered increase of the load, there is a risk of<br>
mechanical damage Thanks to the fact that more of the lowest values in the sequence are<br>
excluded, the highest peaks get a greater Impact and the system becomes more sensitive to<br>
the high peaks and can easier avoid that the load rises much above the desired value, A<br>
consequence of this becomes that the desired value can be raised somewhat, with an<br>
increased crushing capacity as a consequence, without increased risk of mechanical<br>
breakdowns.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the width of the gap is adjustable by means<br>
of a hydraulic adjusting device, in step a) the load being measured as a hydraulic fluid<br>
pressure in said device. The hydraulic fluid pressure frequently gives a very quick and<br>
relevnt indication of the condition in the crusher. Thus, the risk impossible delays or faull<br>
indications causing mechanical breakdowns decreases.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment, in step a) the load is measured as the<br>
power of the crusher driving device. The power of the driving device frequently gives a<br>
quick and relevant feedback of the load on the crusher. Control based on the power of the<br>
driving device is particularly suitable when the capacity of the driving device is what<br>
limits the feasible load on the crusher and also at cases when the adjusting devise is not of<br>
a hydraulic type. The power of the driving device may, for instance, be measured directly<br>
as an electric power, if the driving device is an electric motor, be calculated from a<br>
hydraulic pressure, if the driving device is a hydraulic motor, or, if the driving device is a<br>
diesel engine, from a developed engine power.<br><br>
6<br>
According to an additional preferred embodiment, in step a) the load is measured<br>
as a mechanical stress on the crustier. An advantage of the is that it is possible to choose<br>
the component that is the most critical one for the mechanical strength of the crusher and<br>
measure a stress, such as a tension or a strain, which is representative of the stress on the<br>
same component Thereby, a direct control of the load in relation to the load that the<br>
crusher withstands mechanically is obtained. It is, as mentioned above, not necessary to<br>
measure on the very critical component. On the contrary, it may frequently be appropriate<br>
to measure a mechanical stress in a place, the stress of which correlates well against the<br>
stress on the most critical component. Another advantage is that the mechanical stress may<br>
be utilized as a measure of load also in cases when the adjusting device is not hydraulic<br>
and in cases when the driving device is not limiting for the load that the crusher with-<br>
stands.<br>
In a crusher where it is possible to measure the load both as hydraulic fluid<br>
pressure, as power developed by the crusher driving device and as a mechanical stress, or<br>
at least as two of said parameters, the method may be formed with control on the load<br>
parameter of these which currently is highest in relation to the desired value thereof. Thus,<br>
during a period the load on the crusher may be controlled depending on measured, highest<br>
hydraulic pressures, while during another period it may be controlled depending on<br>
measured highest powers. In this way, the crusher can always operate efficiently without<br>
risking damage on that component, for instance the hydraulic system, driving device or<br>
crusher frame, which currently is exposed to the highest load relatively seen.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, in step c) the load is controlled by the fact<br>
that at least some of the following steps is carried out; that the width of the gap is changed,<br>
that the supply of material to the gap is changed, that the rotational speed of the crusher<br>
driving device is adjusted, and that the mutual movements of the crushing means are<br>
adjusted. Thus, the control of the load may late place in various ways and the method<br>
being selected may be adapted to the current operational situation and the load being<br>
controlled on. An alteration of the width of the gap, frequently gives a very quick<br>
alteration of the load on the crusher. In cases when, for instance, it is desired to keep the<br>
width constant, it may instead be of interest to alter the supply of material to the gap. If the<br>
driving device is exposed to a very high load, it may be suitable to alter the number of<br>
revolutions, It is also possible to combine a plurality of alterations and, for instance, to<br>
alter the width of the gap and adjust the mutual movement of the crushing means<br>
simultaneously. The latter may for instance be an adjustment of how much the crushing<br><br>
7<br>
means move to-and-fro towards each other during the crushing. One example is<br>
adjustment of the horizontal stroke of the shaft in a gyratory crusher.<br>
An additional object of the present invention is to provide a pointer instrument for<br>
indication of load on a gyratory crusher, which instruments makes it easier to improve the<br>
efficiency of the crusher in respect of accomplished crushing work, which, for instance,<br>
may result in an increased size reduction of a certain quantity of material or an increased<br>
quantity of crushed material, in relation to prior art technique.<br>
This object is attained by a pointer instrument, which is of the kind mentioned<br>
above and is characterized in that the pointer instrument has<br>
a first painter, which shows a comparative value, end<br>
a second printer, which shows a representative value, which has been determined<br>
after the instantaneous load on the crusher in one step a) has been, measured during at least<br>
one period of time to obtain a number of measured vaiues, said representative value in a<br>
step b) having been calculated as being representative of the highest measured<br>
instantaneous load during each such period of time, said comparative value being<br>
determined depending on the load on the crusher such that a comparison of the position of<br>
the first pointer and the position of the second pointer gives an indication as to whether the<br>
operation of the crusher is effective.<br>
An advantage of this pointer instrument is that it becomes very dear to an operator<br>
that operates the crusher if the operation is efficient or not If the first pointer shows almost<br>
equally high a pressure as the second pointer, which shows the representative value that is<br>
representative of the highest loads, it means that the operation of the crusher is efficient. If,<br>
on the other hand, the first pointer shows a considerably lower load than the second<br>
pointer, the operator gets an indication that, for instance, the supply of material to the<br>
crusher does not work satisfactory but needs be attended to. Thus, the operator gets an<br>
easily comprehensible indication of disturbances in the process. The pointer instrument<br>
also gives a clear and quick feedback on measures carried out in order to get the crusher to<br>
operate more efficiently, for instance measures in order to alter the moisture content or size<br>
disaribution of the supplied material or to provide a more even inflow of material. The<br>
second pointer also gives a feedback on that the control system is working and that the<br>
load does not exceed permitted levels, which could cause mechanical breakdowns.<br><br>
8<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the first and the second pointer form sides of<br>
a sector, the extension of which indicates the operation conditions of the crusher. The<br>
sector, which suitably has another color than the dial of the pointer instrument, gives a<br>
very clear visual indication of the difference between the value shown by the first pointer<br>
and the representative value representing the highest loads. For the operator, it becomes a<br>
ciear goal to keep the sector as small as possible since this means an efficiently operating<br>
crusher.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the first pointer shows a comparative value<br>
that represents the average load on the crusher. The average load is a good measure of the<br>
crushing work that the crusher performs. If the average load is close to the representative<br>
value, which is representative of the highest loads, it is a clear indication of the crushing<br>
operation being efficient.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment, the first pointer shows a comparative<br>
value, which has been determined after the instantaneous load on the crusher in a first step<br>
having been measured during at least one period of time to obtain a number of measured<br>
values, said comparative value in a second step having been calculated as being<br>
representative of the lowest measured instantaneous load during each period of time. The<br>
lowest measured instantaneous loads give, together with the highest measured<br>
instantaneous loads, which are shown by the second pointer, a good picture of how much<br>
the load in the crusher varies, "beating" up and down, and give indication if something<br>
should be altered in order to decrease the variation. As has been mentioned above, the<br>
highest loads are most serious as regards mechanical damage. However, it is also relevant<br>
to consider to the lowest loads, since a large difference between the highest and the lowest<br>
Joads means substantial load shifts on the crusher, which increase the risk of mechanical<br>
damage.<br>
An additional object of the present invention is to provide a control system for<br>
control of the load in a crusher, which control system improves the efficiency of the<br>
crusher in respect of accomplished crushing work, which, for instance, may result in<br>
increased size reduction of a certain quantity of material or increased quantity of crushed<br>
material, in relation to the prior art technique.<br>
This object is attained by a control system, which is of the kind mentioned above<br>
and is characterized in that it comprises<br><br>
9<br>
a measuring device, which is arranged to measure the instantaneous load on the<br>
crusher during at least one period of time to obtain a number of measured values,<br>
a calculation device, which is arrange to calculate a representative value, which is<br>
representative of the highest measured instantaneous load during each such period of time,<br>
and<br>
a control device, which is arranged to compare said representative value with a<br>
desired value and to control the load on the crusher depending on the same comparison.<br>
An advantage of said control system is that it increases the load at which a crusher<br>
can operate without increasing the risk of breakdown.<br>
Additional advantages and features of the invention are evident from the<br>

Descriotion of Preferred Embodiments<br>
in Fig 1, a gyratory crusher is shown schematically, which has a shaft 1, At the<br>
lower end 2 thereof, the shaft 1 is eccentrically mounted. At the upper end thereof, the<br>
shaft 1 carries a crushing head 3. A first crushing means in the form of a first, inner<br>
crushing shell 4 is mounted on the outside of the crushing head 3, in a machine frame 16, a<br>
second crushing means in the form of a second, outer, crushing shell S has been mounted<br>
in such a way that it surrounds the inner crushing shell 4, Between the inner crushing shell<br>
4 and the outer crushing shell 5, a crushing gap 6 is formed, which in axial section, as is<br>
shown in Fig. 1, has a decreasing width in the direction downwards. The shaft 1, and<br>
thereby the crushing head 3 and the inner crushing shell 4, is vertically movable by means<br>
of a hydraulic adjusting device, which comprises a tank 7 for hydraulic fluid, a hydraulic<br>
pump 8, a gas-filled container 9 and a hydraulic piston 15. Furthermore, a motor 10 is<br>
connected to the crusher, which motor during operation is arranged to bring the shaft 1,<br>
and thereby the crushing head 3, to execute a gyratory movement, i.e., a movement during<br>
which the two crushing shells 4,5 approach each other along a rotary generatrix and<br>
distance from each other at a diametrically opposite generatrix.<br>
In operation, the crusher is controlled by a control device 11, which via an input 12'<br>
receives input signals from a transducer 12 arranged at the motor 10, which transducer<br>
measures the load on the motor, via an input 13' receives input signals from a pressure<br><br>
11<br>
transducer 13, which measure the pressure in the hydraulic fluid in the adjusting device 7,<br>
8,9, 15 and via an input 14' receives signals from a fevef transducer 14, which measures<br>
the position of the shaft 1 in the vertical direction in relation to the machine frame 16, The<br>
control device 11 comprises, among other things, a data processor and controls, on the<br>
basis of received input signals, among other things, the hydraulic fluid pressure in the<br>
adjusting device.<br>
When the crusher is to be started, a calibration is first carried out without<br>
feeding of material. The motor 10 is started and brings the crushing head 3 to execute a<br>
gyratory pendulum movement. Then, the pump 8 increases the hydraulic fluid pressure so<br>
that the shaft 1, and thereby the inner shell 4, is raised until the inner crushing shell 4<br>
comes to abutment against the outer crushing shell 5. When the inner shell 4 contacts the<br>
outer shell 5, a pressure increase arises in the hydraulic fluid, which is recorded by the<br>
pressure transducer 13, The inner shell 4 is lowered somewhat in order to avoid that it<br>
"sticks" against the outer shell 5, and then the motor 10 is stopped and a so called A<br>
measure, which is the vertical distance from a fixed point on the shaft 1 to a fixed point on<br>
the machine frame 16. is measured manually and fed into the control device 11 to<br>
represent the corresponding signal from the level transducer 14. Next, the motor 10 is<br>
restarted and the pump 8 then pumps hydraulic fluid to the tank 7 until the shaft 1 reaches<br>
the lowermost position thereof. The corresponding signal from the level transducer 14 for<br>
said lower position is then read by the control device 11, Knowing the gap angle between<br>
the inner crushing shell 4 and the outer crushing shell 5, the width of the gap 6 may be<br>
calculated at any position of the shaft 1 as measured by the level transducer 14. Usually,<br>
the width of the gap 6 is calculated in the position when the gap 6 is as most narrow, i.e.<br>
in the position where the inner shell 4 gets in contact with the outer shell 5 during the<br>
above-mentioned calibration. However, it is also possible to calculate the width at another<br>
position in the gap 6 in stead.<br>
When the calibration is finished, a suitable width of the gap 6 is set and<br>
supply of material to the crushing gap 6 of the crusher is commenced. The supplied<br>
material is crushed in the gap 6 and may then be collected vertically below the same.<br>
According to the present invention, a representative value is calculated,<br>
which, is representative of the highest measured instantaneous loads on the crusher. As<br>
used in the present application, "load" relates to the stress that the crusher is exposed to on<br>
a certain occasion. The load may., according to the present invention, for instance, be<br>
expressed in the form of a mean peak pressure, which is calculated from hydraulic fluid<br><br>
12<br>
pressures as measured by the pressure transducer 13. The load may also be expressed as a<br>
mean peak motor power that is calculate d from motor powers 35 measured by the<br>
transducer 12, or as a mean peak tension that is calculated from mechanical tensions in the<br>
crusher as measured by a tension sensor, for instance a strain gauge.<br>
Fig 2 schematically shows a method for controlling the operation of the<br>
crusher depending on the hydraulic fluid pressure. The crushing process results in a<br>
varying pressure arising in the hydraulic fluid. At a certain quantity of supplied material of<br>
a certain hardness and size, a narrow gap 6 will mean a high hydraulic fluid pressure and a<br>
wide gap 6 will mean a low hydraulic fluid pressure. A high mean hydraulic fluid pressure<br>
means that the crusher is utilized efficiently in order to crush the supplied material. Thus,<br>
it is desirable that for a certain quantity of supplied material keep as high mean pressure as<br>
possible without the crusher risking to be damaged mechanically. In the step 20 shown in<br>
Fig. 2, measurement is commenced of the instantaneous hydraulic fluid pressure in the<br>
adjusting device 7, 8, 9, 15 by means of the pressure transducer 13, The measurement of<br>
the instantaneous hydraulic fluid pressure started in step 20 continues as long as the<br>
crusher is in operation. The signal from the pressure transducer 13 is received by the<br>
control device 11. In step 22, the supply of material to the crusher is commenced. In step<br>
24, the highest hydraulic fluid pressure that has been receded during a period of time of<br>
0.2 s is stored in the control device 11. The highest hydraulic fluid pressure measured in<br>
step 24 forms, together with the correspond ing values for the four closest preceding<br>
periods of time, a sequence of repeated measurements of highest hydraulic fluid pressures,<br>
hi step 26. a representative value is calculated in the form of a mean peak pressure as a<br>
mean value of the highest hydraulic fluid pressures included in said sequence, which thus<br>
have been measured during each one of the five periods of time which are contained<br>
within the latest 1.0 s. Said mean peak pressure is thereby a value that is representative of<br>
(he highest measured instantaneous hydraulic fluid pressures. The calculated mean peak<br>
pressure is compared with a desired value in step 28, the difference between the mean peak<br>
pressure and the desired value being calculated. The difference between the desired value<br>
and the calculated mean peak pressure obtained in step 28 is utilized in step 30 in order to<br>
determine if the pump 8 should reduce or increase the hydraulic fluid pressure in the<br>
adjusting device, the period of time the pump should be in operation and if any time<br>
should pass before a pressure alteration should be started. In step 32, the control device 11<br>
emits a control signal to the pump 8, if the conditions for such a control signal are met and<br>
a new sequence of measurements is initiated by step 24 again being commenced When the<br>
hydraulic fluid pressure is increased or reduced the shaft 1, and thereby the inner shell 4,<br>
will be raised or lowered, the gap 6 becoming more slender or wider, respectively. Thus,<br><br>
1 3<br>
the hydraulic pressure alteration will affect the width of the gap 6 and thereby the load on<br>
the crusher.<br>
The occasions when the pump 8 should be taken into operation, "pump", and how<br>
long it should pump hydraulic fluid to or from the piston 15, is thus controlled by the<br>
control device 11, The pumping takes place during a certain space of time, the length of<br>
which is proportional in steps to the difference between the current mean peak pressure<br>
and the desired value, i.e., if the current mean peak pressure is within a certain interval at a<br>
certain distance from the desired value, pumping is effected during a certain time, while if<br>
the current mean peak pressure is in an interval which is closer to the desired value, the<br>
pumping is effected during a shorter space of time.<br>
Fig, 3 schematically shows a curve P of measured hydraulic fluid pressure during a<br>
period of 2 s. Within each period of time of 0.2 s, the highest hydraulic fluid pressure is<br>
recorded during that period of time. In Fig 3, the periods of time have been numbered from<br>
1 to 10 and the highest hydraulic fluid pressure in each period of time, which hydraulic<br>
fluid pressure is stored in the control device 11 in step 24, has for period of time 1 to 5<br>
been marked with an arrow. The mean peak pressure mentioned in step 26 is calculated as<br>
a mean value of the highest hydraulic fluid pressures from the respective period of time 1<br>
to 5, which are included in a first sequence S1 of repeated measurements of highest<br>
hydraulic fluid pressures. In the iteration following next, i.e., when step 24 again has been<br>
commenced, the highest hydraulic fluid pressure in period of time no. 6 will be stored in<br>
the control device 11, a new mean peak pressure being calculated from the highest<br>
hydraulic fluid pressures from the respective period of time 2 to 6, which are included in a<br>
second sequence S2 and so on. Thus, a new mean peak pressure will be calculated five<br>
times per second and said mean peak pressure will be based on the respective highest<br>
hydraulic fluid pressures which have been measured during the five latest periods of time.<br>
Fig. 4 schematically shows an even more preferred embodiment, wherein a<br>
sifting of the respective highest hydraulic fluid pressures is made before a mean peak<br>
pressure is calculated. In this even more preferred method, step 26 has been configured<br>
according to the following. The respective highest hydraulic fluid pressures from the latest<br>
10 periods of time are compared, the two highest values and the five lowest values being<br>
sifted away. A mean peak pressure is then calculated as a mean value of the remaining 3<br>
periods of time and is utilized in step 28. Fig 4 shows a schematic illustration of how the<br>
sifting has taken place in 3 sequence S3 of repeated measurements of highest hydraulic<br>
fluid pressures. The periods of time which have the two highest and the five lowest values,<br><br>
14<br>
respectively, of highest hydraulic fluid pressure have been sifted away, which is<br>
symbolized, by they having been crossed over in Fig. 4. Thanks to the fact that more of the<br>
lowest than of the highest values of highest hydraulic fluid pressure are excluded, the mean<br>
peak pressure, which later is correlated to the desired value, will be more sensitive to the<br>
highest pressures. Thus, the control system will react faster on pressure increases than on<br>
pressure reductions, which decreases the risk of mechanical breakdowns caused by too<br>
high pressures. Thus, the mean peak pressure is calculated as a mean value of the highest<br>
hydraulic fluid pressures during those periods of time of the periods of time 1 to 10 that<br>
have not been silled away. Table 1 below indicates how the analysis, which lakes place in<br>
the control device 11, may look like:<br><br>
The control device 11 suitably also measures the mean hydraulic fluid<br>
pressure. The mean hydraulic fluid pressure is a measure of the load of the crusher and<br>
should be as high as possible. In Fig- 3 and Fig. 4, the mean hydraulic fluid pressure has<br>
been marked with a dashed curve A. Thus, the mean hydraulic fluid pressure is an average<br>
of all measured instantaneous hydraulic fluid pressures during the preceding 2.0 s. In<br>
efficient operation of the crusher, the mean hydraulic fluid pressure, i.e., curve A, should<br>
be close to the calculated mean peak pressure, i.e., the mean value of the highest hydraulic<br>
fluid pressures measured during respective period of time. Accordingly, it is desirable to<br>
keep the hydraulic fluid pressure on an even and high level. In such an operation, the<br>
crusher will be utilized maximally for crushing without the risk of increasing mechanical<br>
breakdowns,<br><br>
15<br>
Fig. 5 shows a typical geometry of a hydraulic pressure curve P in an<br>
efficiently operating crusher. In this case, the desired value of mean peak pressure was<br>
predetermined to 5.0 MPa. The mean peak pressure M varies between approx. 4.5 and 5.5<br>
MPa As is seen in Fig. 5, the mean hydraulic fluid pressure A is approx. 4 MPa, i.e., only<br>
somewhat below the calculated mean peak pressure M. This is provided by the fact that the<br>
supply of material to the crusher is handled in such a way that the flow of material is even<br>
and contains material having approximately the same size distribution, moisture content<br>
and hardness.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a typical geometry of a hydraulic fluid pressure curve P for a<br>
crusher of the same type as above but at substantially varying load, which, for instance,<br>
may depend on the amount of material and/or the size distribution of the material varying<br>
relatively much. The desired value of mean peak pressure was aiso in this case 5.0 MPa.<br>
The mean peak pressure M varies between approx. 4.5 and 5.5 MPa. Thus, the control<br>
device 11 can, also on substantially varying load, keep the mean peak pressure M within<br>
narrow margins, wherein mechanical breakdowns may be avoided also, for instance, upon<br>
uneven supply and operational disturbances. As is seen in Fig. 6, the mean hydraulic fluid<br>
pressure A is on approx. 3.2 MPa, which is considerably below the mean peak pressure M<br>
and, therefore, the crusher operates with relatively low efficiency,<br>
Fig, 7 shows a pointer instrument 40, which visually shows how efficiently the<br>
operation of the crusher is. The pointer instrument 40 has a dial 42 and two pointers in the<br>
form of needles 44,46. A first needle 44 shows a comparative value in the form of the<br>
mean hydraulic fluid pressure in the crusher. A second needle 46 shows a representative<br>
value in the form of the mean peak pressure, i.e., the mean value of the highest hydraulic<br>
fluid pressures that have been measured during a number of periods of time, which<br>
accordingly is a value which is representative of the highest measured instantaneous<br>
hydraulic fluid pressures and which has been calculated according to the above. The<br>
distance between the first needle 44 and the second needle 46 is an indication of how<br>
efficiently the crusher operates. The desired value of the mean peak pressure has been<br>
marked with a line 48 on the dial 42 of the pointer instrument. In the position that is shown<br>
in fig. 7, the mean peak pressure, which is shown by the second needle 46, is incidentally<br>
lower than the desired value. Thus, the control device 11 will instruct the pump 8 to pump<br>
in more hydraulic fluid so that the crushing head 3 is raised and the hydraulic fluid<br>
pressure increases again.<br><br>
1.6 <br>
In Fig. 7, a third pointer is also shown in the form of a dashed third needle 50 ,<br>
which is included in an alternative design at the pointer instrument 40. The needie 50 is<br>
utilized in order to show a. difference calculated by the control device 11 between the mean<br>
hydraulic fluid pressure and the mean peak pressure with the purpose of more clearly<br>
illustrating how efficiently the crusher operates.<br>
In Fig. 7. also a fourth pointer is shown in the form of a dashed and dotted fourth<br>
needle 52, which is included in an additional alternative design of the pointer instrument<br>
40. The needle 52 is utilized in order to show a comparative value calculated by the<br>
control device 11 in the form of a mean bottom pressure. The mean bottom pressure is<br>
ealculated according ro the same principle as has been described above for the mean peak<br>
pressure, but is instead based on the lowest measured hydraulic fluid pressures. Thus, the<br>
mean bottom pressure is calculated as a mean value of the lowest hydraulic fluid pressures<br>
that have been measured during a number of consecutive periods of time, and thereby<br>
represents the lowest loads on the crusher. The distance between the fourth needle 52,<br>
which shows the mean bottom pressure, and the second needle 46, which shows the mean,<br>
peak pressure, thus illustrates how large the variation in load on the crusher is. The fourth<br>
needle 52 may he used together with the first needle 44, which shows the mean pressure,<br>
or replace the same, wherein the needle 52 will work as a first pointer that then, together<br>
with the second needle 46, which shows the mean peak pressure, illustrates the operation<br>
condition in the crusher, It is also possible to calculate the difference between the mean<br>
peak pressure and the mean bottom pressure and let a fifth pointer, not shown in Fig. 7,<br>
show this difference.<br>
Fig. 8a shows another embodiment hi the form of a pointer instrument 140. The<br>
same pointer instrument 140 is formed as a virtual window, which is shown on a display<br>
device, for instance a display device included in the control device 11. The pointer<br>
instrument has a dial 142, a first pointer 144, which shows the mean hydraulic fluid<br>
pressure, and a second pointer 146, which shows the mean peak pressure, i.e., the mean<br>
value of the highest hydraulic fluid pressures which have been measured during a number<br>
of periods of time- The first and the second pointer 144 and 146, respectively, form<br>
between themselves a sector 150 that has another color, for instance black, than the dial<br>
142 find therefore is clearly seen- Thus, the extension of the sector 150 on the dial 142<br>
becomes a visually easy-to-read measure of how efficiently the crusher operates. The<br>
position of the first pointer 144 is updated each time a new mean hydraulic fluid pressure<br>
has been calculated and the position of the second pointer 146 is updated each time a new<br>
mean peak pressure has been calculated. The pointer instrument 140 shown in Fig. 8a<br><br>
17<br>
illustrates the condition in the crasher, the hydraulic fluid pressure curve P of which is<br>
shown in Fig. 5, i.e., an efficiently operating crusher,<br>
The pointer instrument 140 has also a virtual display 152 that, tor instance, may<br>
display the current mean peak pressure, mean hydraulic fluid pressure or the difference<br>
between these pressures.<br>
In Fig. 8b, a pointer instrument 140 is shown of the same type as the one shown in<br>
Fig. &amp;a. However, the pointer instrument 140 shown in Fig. 8b illustrates the condition in<br>
the crusher, the hydraulic fluid pressure curve P of which is shown in Fig. 6, i.e., a crusher<br>
which does not operate efficiently by virtue of substantially varying load. As is seen in Fig.<br>
8b, the sector 150 has a large extension on the dial 142 since the mean hydraulic fluid<br>
pressure, which is shown by the pointer 144, is considerably lower than the mean peak<br>
pressure, which is shown by the pointer 146, which clearly indicates to the operator that<br>
measures needs to be taken in order to increase the efficiency of the crusher.<br>
Fig, 9 schematically shows a gyratory crusher that is of another type than the<br>
crusher shown in Fig. 1. The crusher shown in Fig. 9 has a shaft 201, which carries a<br>
crushing head 203 having a first crushing means in the form of an inner crushing shell 204<br>
mounted thereon. Between the inner shell 204 and a second crushing means in the form of<br>
an outer crushing shell 205, a crushing gap 206 is formed. The outer crushing shell 205 is<br>
attached to a case 207 that has a trapezoid thread 208, The thread 208 mates with a<br>
corresponding thread 209 in a crusher frame 216. Furthermore, a motor 210 is connected<br>
to the crusher, which is arranged to bring the shaft 201, and thereby the crushing head 203,<br>
to execute a gyratory movement during operation. When the ease 207 is turned by an<br>
adjustment motor 215 around the symmetry axis thereof, the outer crushing shell 205 will<br>
be moved vertically, the width of the gap 206 being changed. In this type of gyratory<br>
crusher, accordingly the case 207, the threads 208,209 as well as the adjustment motor<br>
215 constitute a adjusting device for adjusting of the width of the gap 206, Upon control of<br>
the load on a crusher of this type by means of a control device 211, it is according to the<br>
invention possible to utilize a transducer 212, which measures the instantaneous power<br>
generated by the motor 210. From the highest measured powers during a number of<br>
periods of time, subsequently a mean peak power may be calculated and compared with a<br>
desired value. Depending on said comparison, the load on the crusher is controlled. The<br>
same control may, for instance, consist of the adjustment motor 215 being instructed to<br>
time the case 207 in order to alter the width of the gap 206. ti is also possible to alter the<br><br>
18<br>
supply of material, the number of revolutions of the motor 210 and/or the stroke of the<br>
shaft 201 in the horizontal direction.<br>
An alternative method to measure the load, which method works both in crushes<br>
having hydraulic adjusting devices and crushes of the type which is shown in Fig. 9, is to<br>
measure a mechanical stiess or tension in the proper crusher. As is seen in Fig. 9, a strain<br>
gauge 213 has been placed on the crusher frame 216. The strain gauge 213, which<br>
measures the instantaneous strain in the part of the frame 216 to which it is attached, is<br>
suitably placed on a location on the frame 216 which gives a representative picture of the<br>
mechanical load on the crusher- From the highest measured strains, possibly converted to<br>
corresponding tensions, during a number of periods of time, a mean peak strain or tension<br>
may then be calculated and utilized in order to control the load on the crusher.<br>
Fig. 10 schematically shows a jaw crusher. The jaw crusher has a frame 316 and a<br>
movable jaw 303 movably mounted therein. The movable jaw 303 carries a first crushing<br>
means in the form of a first crushing plate 304. The frame 316 carries a second crushing<br>
means in the form of a second crushing plate 305. A crushing gap 306 is formed between<br>
the first crushing plate 304 and the second crushing plate 305. The jaw 303 is rotatably and<br>
eccentrically secured at its upper end to a flywheel 30 L The flywheel 301 is driven via a<br>
belt 302 by a driving device in the form of a motor 310 and thereby gets the upper portion<br>
of the jaw 303 to describe a substantially elliptical movement, which causes material fed<br>
into the gap 306 to be crushed by the crushing plates 304, 305. The lower end of the jaw<br>
303 is supported by a toggle plate 307. The toggle plate 307 has a hydraulic cylinder 308,<br>
which makes it possible to adjust the width of the gap 306. At this type of crusher the<br>
toggle plate 307 and (he hydraulic cylinder 308 an adjusting device for adjustment of the<br>
width of the gap 306. At control of the load on a crusher of this type by means of the<br>
control device 311 it is according to the present invention possible to use a gauge 312 that<br>
measures the instantaneous povveT that develops at the motor 310 and sends a signal to the<br>
control device 311 A mean peak power can then be calculated from the highest measured<br>
powers during a number of periods of time in accordance with what has been described<br>
above and be compared to a desired value. The load on the crusher is controlled depending<br>
of this comparison. This control may for example consist in the control device 311 orders<br>
the hydraulic cylinder 308 to change the width of the gap 306. It is also possible to order<br>
change of feed of material to the crusher or of the rotational speed of the motor 310.<br>
It is also possible to measure e mechanical load or tension in the crusher itself. As<br>
is apparent from Fig. 10 a strain gauge 313 has been positioned on the crusher frame 316.<br><br>
19<br>
The strain gauge 313 that measures the instanlaneous strain in the portion of the frame 316<br>
on which it is secured, can be used in a similar way as described above regarding the gauge<br>
213. Another possibility is to position a strain gauge 314 on the toggle plate 307 for<br>
measuring the instantaneous load on the toggle plate 307 and to send a signal to the control<br>
device 311 that uses that signal for controlling the crusher. It is also possible to measure<br>
the hydraulic fluid pressure in the hydraulic cylinder 308 of the toggle plate 307 and to use<br>
said pressure as a measure on the load on the crusher. It is understood that the toggle plate<br>
307 is schematically shown and that other devices and other types of toggle plates may be<br>
used for adjusting the width of the gap 306.<br>
It will be appreciated that a number of modifications of the above-described<br>
umbodiments are feasible within the scope of the invention, such as it is defined by the<br>
appended claims,<br>
The representative value that is representative of the highest measured<br>
instantaneous loads may, for instance, be calculated as a mean peak pressure according to<br>
what has been described above. There are, however, a plurality of other methods to<br>
calculate said representative value. For instance, a standard deviation from the mean load<br>
may be calculated and utilized ss said value. A small standard deviation is then an<br>
indication of the crusher operating efficiently. An additional alternative is to take both the:<br>
height and duration of the respective load peak into consideration. For instance, the<br>
extension of the peaks In time and height may be calculated by integration, said value<br>
being calculated as a mean value of a number of integrated peaks.<br>
Two consecutive sequences of data may either partly overlap each other, such as<br>
has been described above, or follow immediately upon each other insiead of partly<br>
utilising the same data.<br>
It will be appreciated that a person skilled in the art by experiments can derive<br>
lengths of the periods of time suitable for certain specific operation conditions, how many<br>
periods of time that should be included in a sequence, how many data in a sequence that<br>
should be retrieved from a preceding sequence and if any data should be sifted away before<br>
calculation of mean values and that the above-described statements constitute a preferred<br>
example. For instance, a suitable kngth of each period of time has turned out to be 0:05 to<br>
1.s.<br><br>
20<br>
Above is described how the control device 11 controls the hydraulic fluid pressure<br>
depending on a comparison of said representative value, which, for instance, may be a<br>
mean peak pressure, with a desired value of the pressure. However, the control device 11<br>
may also be arranged to lake the load of the motor 10 into consideration. If the signal from<br>
the transducer 12, which measures the load of the motor 10, indicates that the load oa the,<br>
motor 10 exceeds an allowed load value, the control device 11 will instruct the pump 8 to<br>
decrease the hydraulic fluid pressure, also if the mean peak pressure does not exceed the<br>
desired value of pressure, in order to avoid overload of the motor 10.<br>
Above a method for controlling the crusher is described where it is desirable to<br>
keep highest feasible load and size reduce the material as much as possible. The control<br>
device 11 aims, in that connection, at keeping a high hydraulic fluid pressure and makes<br>
this by continuously keeping the gap 6 as narrow as possible, the supplied material being<br>
exposed to a maximum size reduction. In certain cases, il is instead ofinterest to keep a<br>
fixed width of the gap 6 in order to provide a certain size of the crushed product, In such a<br>
case, the control device 11 ean instead be utilized as a safety function that incidentally<br>
increases the gap somewhat in order to reduce the hydraulic fluid pressure when the<br>
calculated mean peak pressure during any shorter period exceeds the desired value of<br>
pressure. Therefore, in this way, a larger quantity of supplied material can be crushed to a<br>
certain desired size without risk of mechanical breakdown. It also becomes considerably<br>
simpler to maximize the quantity of material that can be crushed to the desired size. An<br>
additional possibility is to let the crusher altematingly operate in control towards<br>
maximum load and in control to a fixed gap. It is also possible to keep the width of the gap<br>
6 constant and instead control the load on the crusher by means of some other parameter,<br>
for instance the amount of supplied material.<br>
It is understood the width of the crushing gap 6,206, 306 can be adjusted in<br>
different ways and that the above-described methods, reference being had to Figs. 1, 9 and<br>
10, are non-limiting examples.<br>
The above-described pointer instruments 40; 140 are provided with needles 44,46<br>
and pointers 144,146, respectively, which may be mechanical or be shown on a display<br>
device. It is however also possible instead to utilize digital display of the actual numbers<br>
concerning the mean hydraulic fluid pressure and mean peak pressure, which have been<br>
calculated. Thus, in this case, the pointer of the pointer instrument will consist of displays<br>
that, suitably digitally, show calculated numbers. It is, as is mentioned above, also possible<br>
to calculate the difference between the mean hydraulic fluid pressure and the mean peak<br><br>
21<br>
pressure and let a third pointer, which may be a needle 50 or a display showing the number<br>
in question, show said difference. The difference between mean hydraulic fluid pressure<br>
and mean peak pressure may thereby be used, for following-up of the operation of the<br>
crusher- a small difference meaning, as mentioned above, that the crusher operates effi-<br>
ciently- It is also possible to combine display with needles and display of numbers in<br>
question and to in that connection utilize needles in order to show mean hydraulic fluid<br>
pressure and mean peak pressure and a display in order to show the calculated difference<br>
between the same.<br>
It is also possible to form a pointer instrument having a sector that is formed<br>
between a second pointer, which shows the mean peak pressure, and a fourth pointer,<br>
which shows the mean bottom pressure. A first pointer, which shows the mean pressure,<br>
may be imparted another color than the sector and is placed on top of the same in order to<br>
also show the mean pressure in the adjusting device.<br><br>
