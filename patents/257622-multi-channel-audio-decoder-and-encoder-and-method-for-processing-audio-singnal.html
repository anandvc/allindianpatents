Concept for bridging the gap between parametric multi-channel<br>
audio coding and matrixed-surround multi-channel coding<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to multi-channel audio coding<br>
and transmission, and in particular to techniques to encode<br>
multi-channel audio in a manner that is fully backwards com-<br>
patible with stereo devices and formats, allowing for an ef-<br>
ficient coding of multi-channel audio.<br>
Background of the invention and prior art<br>
Parametric coding of multi-channel audio signals is an ongo-<br>
ing topic of research. Generally two approaches to encode<br>
multi-channel audio signals can be distinguished. The Moving<br>
Pictures Experts Group (MPEG), a subgroup of the Interna-<br>
tional Organization for Standardization (ISO), is currently<br>
working on the standardization of technology for the recon-<br>
struction of multi-channel audio content from stereo or even<br>
mono down-mix signals by adding only a small amount of helper<br>
information to the down-mix signals.<br>
In parallel stereo to multi-channel up-mix methods are being<br>
developed which do not need any additional side-information<br>
that is not already (implicitly) contained in the down-mix<br>
signal in order to reconstruct the spatial image of the ori-<br>
ginal multi-channel audio signal.<br>
Existing methods for stereo-compatible multi-channel trans-<br>
mission without additional side-information that gained prac-<br>
tical relevance can mostly be characterized as matrixed-<br><br>
surround methods, such as Dolby Pro Logic (Dolby Pro Logic<br>
II) and Logic-7, as described in more detail in "Dolby Sur-<br>
round Pro Logic II Decoder - Principles of Operation",<br>
http://www.dolby.com/assets/pdf/tech_library/209_Dolby_Surrou<br>
nd_Pro_Logic_II_Decoder_Principles_of_Operation.pdf and in<br>
"Multichannel Matrix Surround Decoders for Two-Eared Listen-<br>
ers", Griesinger, D., 101st AES Convention, Los Angeles, USA,<br>
1996, Preprint 4402. The common principle of these methods is<br>
that they make use of dedicated ways of multi-channel or ste-<br>
reo down-mixing where the encoder applies phase shifts to the<br>
surround channels prior to mixing them together with front<br>
and centre channels to form a stereo down-mix signal. The<br>
generation of the down-mix signal (Lt, Rt) is depicted in the<br>
following equation:<br><br>
The left down-mix signal (Lt) consists of the left-front sig-<br>
nal (Lf), the centre signal (C) multiplied by a factor q, the<br>
left-surround signal (Ls) phase rotated by 90 degrees (, j' )<br>
and scaled by a factor a, and the right-surround signal (Rs)<br>
which is also phase rotated by 90 degrees and scaled by a<br>
factor b. The right down-mix signal (Rt) is generated simi-<br>
larly. Typical down-mix factors are 0.707 for q and a, and<br>
0.408 for b. The rationale for the different signs of the<br>
surround channels for the right down-mix signal (Rt) and the<br>
left down-mix signal (Lt) is, that it is advantageous to mix<br>
the surround channels in anti-phase in the down-mix pair (Lt,<br>
Rt). This property helps the decoder to discriminate between<br>
front and rear channels from the down-mix signal pair. Hence<br><br>
the down-mix matrix allows for a partial reconstruction of a<br>
multi-channel output signal out from the stereo down-mix<br>
within the decoder by applying a de-matrixing operation. How<br>
close the re-created multi-channel signal resembles the<br>
original encoder input signal, however, depends on the spe-<br>
cific properties of the multi-channel audio content.<br>
An example for a coding method adding helper information, al-<br>
so called side information, is MPEG Surround audio coding.<br>
This efficient way for parametric multi-channel audio coding<br>
is for example described in "The Reference Model Architecture<br>
for MPEG Spatial Audio Coding", Herre, J., Purnhagen, H.,<br>
Breebaart, J., Faller, C., Disch, S., Kjoerling, K. , Schui-<br>
jers, E., Hilpert, J., Myburg, F., Proc. 118th AES Conven-<br>
tion, Barcelona, Spain, 2005 and in "Text of Working Draft<br>
for Spatial Audio Coding (SAC)", ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11<br>
(MPEG), Document N7136, Busan, Korea, 2005.<br>
A schematic overview of an encoder used in spatial audio cod-<br>
ing is shown in Fig. 6. The encoder splits incoming signals<br>
10 (input 1, ... input N) in separate time-frequency tiles by<br>
means of Quadrature Mirror Filters 12 (QMF) . Groups of the<br>
resulting frequency tiles (bands) are referred to as "parame-<br>
ter bands". For every parameter band, a number of spatial pa-<br>
rameters 14 are determined by a parameter estimator 16 that<br>
describes the properties of the spatial image, e.g. level<br>
differences between pairs of channels (CLD), cross correla-<br>
tion between pairs of channels (ICC) or information on signal<br>
envelopes (CPC). These parameters are subsequently quantized,<br>
encoded and compiled jointly into a bit-stream of spatial<br>
data. Depending on the operation mode, this bit-stream can<br>
cover a wide range of bit-rates, starting from a few kBit/s<br><br>
for good quality multi-channel audio up to tenths of kBit/s<br>
for near-transparent quality.<br>
Besides the extraction of parameters, the encoder also gener-<br>
ates a mono or stereo down-mix from the multi-channel input<br>
signal. Moreover, in case of a stereo down-mix, the user has<br>
the choice of a conventional (ITU-style) stereo down-mix or<br>
of a down-mix that is compatible with matrixed-surround sys-<br>
tems. Finally, the stereo down-mix is transferred to the<br>
time-domain by means of QMF synthesis banks 18. The resulting<br>
down-mix can be transmitted to a decoder, accompanied by the<br>
spatial parameters or the spatial parameter bit-stream 14.<br>
Preferably, the down-mix is also encoded before transmission<br>
(using a conventional mono or stereo core coder), while the<br>
bit-streams of the core coder and the spatial parameters<br>
might additionally be combined (multiplexed) to form a single<br>
output bit-stream.<br>
A decoder, as sketched in Fig. 7, in principle performs the<br>
reverse process of the encoder. An input-stream is split into<br>
a core coder bit-stream and a parameter bit-stream. This is<br>
not shown in Fig. 7. Subsequently, the decoded down-mix 20 is<br>
processed by a QMF analysis bank 22 to derive parameter bands<br>
that are the same as those applied in the encoder. A spatial<br>
synthesis stage 24 reconstructs the multi-channel signal by<br>
means of control data 26 (i.e., the transmitted spatial pa-<br>
rameters) . Finally, the QMF-domain signals are transferred to<br>
the time domain by means of a QMF synthesis bank 27 that de-<br>
rives the final multi-channel output signals 28.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a simple example of a QMF analysis, as it is<br>
performed within the prior art encoder in Fig. 6 and the<br>
prior art decoder in Fig. 7. An audio sample 30, sampled in<br><br>
the time domain and having four sample values is input into a<br>
filter bank 32. The filter bank 32 derives three output sam-<br>
ples 34a, 34b and 34c having four sample values each. In an<br>
ideal case, the filter bank 32 derives the output samples 34a<br>
to 34c such that the samples within the output signals do on-<br>
ly comprise information on discrete frequency ranges of the<br>
underlying audio signal 30. In the case shown in Fig. 8, the<br>
sample 34a has information on the frequency interval ranging<br>
from fO to fl, the sample 34b has information of the fre-<br>
quency interval [fl, f2] and the sample 34c has information<br>
on the frequency interval [f2, f3] . Although the frequency<br>
intervals in Fig. 8 do not overlap, in a more general case<br>
the frequency intervals of the output samples coming out of a<br>
filter bank may very well have a frequency overlap.<br>
A prior art encoder can, as already described above, deliver<br>
either an ITU-style down-mix or a matrixed-surround compati-<br>
ble down-mix, when a two-channel down-mix is desired. In the<br>
case of a matrixed-surround compatible down-mix (using for<br>
example the matrixing approach given in Equation 1), one pos-<br>
sibility would be that the encoder generates a matrixed-<br>
surround compatible down-mix directly.<br>
Fig. 9 shows an alternative approach to generate a matrixed-<br>
surround compatible down-mix using a down-mix post processing<br>
unit 30 working on a regular stereo down-mix 32. The ma-<br>
trixed-surround processor 30 (MTX encoder) modifies the regu-<br>
lar stereo down-mix 32 to make it matrixed-surround compati-<br>
ble guided by the spatial parameters 14 extracted by the pa-<br>
rameter extraction stage 16. For transmission, a matrixed-<br>
surround compatible down-mix 34 is transferred to the time<br>
domain by a QMF synthesis using the QMF synthesis bank 18.<br><br>
Deriving the matrixed-surround compatible signal by post-<br>
processing a regular stereo down-mix has the advantage that<br>
the matrixed-surround compatibility processing can be fully<br>
reversed at a decoder side if the spatial parameters are a-<br>
vailable.<br>
Although both of the approaches are suited to transmit a mul-<br>
ti-channel signal, there are specific drawbacks of state of<br>
the art systems. Matrixed-surround methods are very efficient<br>
(since no additional parameters are required) at the price of<br>
a very limited multi-channel reconstruction quality.<br>
Parametric multi-channel approaches on the other hand require<br>
a higher bit-rate due to the side information, which becomes<br>
a problem when a limit is set as a maximum acceptable bit-<br>
rate for the parametric representation. When the encoded pa-<br>
rameters require a comparatively high amount of bit-rate, the<br>
only possible way to stay within such a bit-rate limit is to<br>
decrease the quality of an encoded down-mix channel by in-<br>
creasing the compression of the channel. Hence, the result is<br>
a general loss in audio quality, which may be unacceptably<br>
high. In other words, for parametric multi-channel ap-<br>
proaches, there is often a hard limit of the minimum bit-rate<br>
that is required for the spatial parameter layer, which may<br>
in some cases be unacceptably high.<br>
Although principle backwards compatibility between matrixed-<br>
surround methods and spatial audio methods can be achieved by<br>
a prior art encoder as illustrated in Fig. 9, no additional<br>
bit-rate can be saved with this approach when only matrix-<br>
based decoding is required. Even then the full set of spatial<br>
parameters has to be transmitted, wasting transmission band-<br>
width.<br><br>
Whereas the bit-rate that has to be spent when applying the<br>
parametric method may be too high in case of certain applica-<br>
tion scenarios, the audio quality delivered by the methods<br>
without transmission of side-information might not be suffi-<br>
cient .<br>
The US Patent Application 2005157883 is showing an apparatus<br>
for constructing a multi-channel audio signal using an input<br>
signal and parametric side information, the input signal in-<br>
cluding the first input channel and the second input channel<br>
derived from an original multi-channel signal, and the para-<br>
metric side information describing interrelations between<br>
channels of the multi-channel original signal.<br>

representation includes first parametric data for a first<br>
portion of the multi-channel signal and wherein for a second<br>
portion of the multi-channel signal no parametric data or<br>
second parametric data is included in the parametric repre-<br>
sentation, the second parametric data requiring less informa-<br>
tion units than the first parametric data when describing an<br>
identical portion of the multi-channel signal.<br>
In accordance with an eighth aspect of the present invention,<br>
this object is achieved by a transcoder for generating a pa-<br>
rametric representation of a multi-channel audio signal using<br><br>
spatial parameters describing the spatial properties of the<br>
multi-channel audio signal, comprising: a parameter generator<br>
to generate the parametric representation such that the para-<br>
metric representation includes first parametric data being<br>
derived from the spatial parameters for a first portion of<br>
the multi-channel signal and wherein for a second portion of<br>
the multi-channel signal no parametric data or second para-<br>
metric data is included in the parametric representation, the<br>
second parametric data requiring less information units than<br>
the first parametric data when describing an identical por-<br>
tion of the multi-channel signal.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that a multi-<br>
channel audio signal can be efficiently represented by a pa-<br>
rametric representation, when a first deriving rule is used<br>
for deriving first parametric data of the parametric repre-<br>
sentation describing a first portion of the multi-channel<br>
signal, and when for a second portion of the multi-channel<br>
signal second parametric data or no parametric data is in-<br>
cluded in the parametric representation, whereas the second<br>
parametric data is requiring less information units than the<br>
first parametric data when describing an identical portion of<br>
the multi-channel signal.<br>
Thus, a first portion of the multi channel signal is repre-<br>
sented by first parameters allowing for a reconstruction of<br>
the multi channel signal with higher quality and a second<br>
portion can be represented by second parameters allowing for<br>
a reconstruction with slightly lower quality. The bit-rate<br>
consumed by the first parametric data is consequently higher<br>
than the bit rate consumed by the second parametric data when<br>
both parametric data is to describe the same portion of a<br>
multi-channel signal. In other words, the first parameters<br>
require more bit rate per signal portion than the second pa-<br>
rameters.<br><br>
The purpose of the invention is to bridge the gap between<br>
both prior art worlds by gradually improving the sound of the<br>
up-mix signal while raising the bit-rate consumed by the<br>
side-information starting from 0 up to the bit-rates of the<br>
parametric methods. That is, the present invention aims at<br>
bridging the gap in bit-rates and perceptual quality between<br>
fully parametric methods and matrixed-surround methods. More<br>
specifically, it provides a method of flexibly choosing an<br>
"operating point" somewhere between matrixed-surround (no si-<br>
de-information, limited audio quality) and fully parametric<br>
reconstruction (full side-information rate required, good<br>
quality). This operating point can be chosen dynamically<br>
(i.e. varying in time) and in response to the permissible<br>
side-information rate, as it is dictated by the individual<br>
application.<br>
By dynamically choosing the size of the first portion of the<br>
multi-channel audio signal which is the part of the multi-<br>
channel audio signal that is represented by the spatial audio<br>
parameters, the demanded bit-rate can be varied within a<br>
broad range. Representing major parts of a multi-channel sig-<br>
nal by the spatial audio parameters will consume a compara-<br>
tively high bit-rate at the benefit of a good perceptual<br>
quality. Since for the second portion of the multi-channel<br>
audio signal a parameter deriving rule is chosen that results<br>
in parameters consuming less bit-rate, the resulting total<br>
bit-rate can be decreased by increasing the size of the sec-<br>
ond portion of the multi-channel signal. In a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention, no parametric data at<br>
all is transmitted for the second portion of the multi-<br>
channel signal, which is of course most bit-saving.<br>
Therefore, by dynamically shifting the size of the first<br>
portion with respect to the size of the second portion, the<br>
bit-rate (or the perceptual quality) can be dynamically<br>
adjusted to the needs.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a down-<br>
mix signal is derived in a matrix compatible way. Therefore,<br>
the first portion of the multi-channel audio signal can be<br>
reproduced with high perceptual quality using the spatial au-<br>
dio parameters and the second portion of the multi-channel<br>
signal can be reproduced using matrix-based solutions. This<br>
allows for a high-quality reproduction of parts of the sig-<br>
nals requiring higher quality. At the same time, the overall<br>
bit-rate is decreased by relying on a matrix-based reproduc-<br>
tion for signal parts less vital for the quality of a repro-<br>
duced signal.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the inventive concept is applied on the decoder side within a<br>
QMF representation of a received down-mix signal. The up-<br>
mixing process can principally be sub-divided into three<br>
steps:<br>
Pre-processing of the input signals (down-mix signals<br>
received in the QMF domain) by application of a pre-de-<br>
correlator matrix;<br>
de-correlation of part of the pre-processed signals; and<br>
mixing the thus derived signals (pre-processed signals<br>
and de-correlated signals) within a mix matrix, the out-<br>
put of the mixing being the channels of the up-mix sig-<br>
nal .<br>
Both, the pre-de-correlator matrix as well as the mixed-<br>
matrix are two-dimensional matrices with the dimensions "num-<br>
ber of time slots" on the one hand and "number of parameter<br>
bands" on the other hand. Within a decoding process, the ele-<br><br>
merits of these matrices are filled up with values that are<br>
derived from the parameters read from the spatial bit-stream,<br>
i.e. by the first parametric data. When the first parametric<br>
data is only received for a first portion of the multi-<br>
channel signal, only that portion of a reconstruction of a<br>
multi-channel signal can be derived using the first paramet-<br>
ric data submitted. The matrix elements for deriving the sec-<br>
ond part of the reconstruction of the multi-channel signal<br>
are, according to the present invention, derived using matrix<br>
compatible coding schemes. These matrix elements can there-<br>
fore either be derived based only on knowledge achieved from<br>
the down-mix signal or be replaced by pre-defined values.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a multi-channel audio decoder ac-<br>
cording to the present invention recognizes by the amount of<br>
the transmitted first parametric data, which part of the ma-<br>
trix or which part of the multi-channel audio signal is to be<br>
processed by the rule depending on the spatial parameters and<br>
which part is to be processed by the matrix based solution.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, an audio en-<br>
coder creates window information, indicating which parts of a<br>
multi-channel signal are being processed by the matrix based<br>
solution or by the spatial audio compatible approach. The<br>
window information is included in the parametric representa-<br>
tion of a multi-channel signal.<br>
An inventive decoder, therefore, is able to receive and to<br>
process the window information created to apply the appropri-<br>
ate up-mixing rules on the portions of the multi-channel au-<br>
dio signal indicated by the window information.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the in-<br>
ventive concept is applied in the QMF domain during the sig-<br>
nal processing, i.e. in a domain where the signals are repre-<br>
sented by multiple representations each representation hold-<br>
ing information on a certain frequency band.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the side-information free method (matrix based approach) is<br>
applied only to the higher frequency parts while applying<br>
(explicit) parametric information (i.e. the first encoding<br>
and decoding rule) for a proper reproduction of the low-<br>
frequency parts. This is advantageous due to the property of<br>
the human hearing to notice small deviations of two similar<br>
signals (e.g. phase deviations) a lot easier for low frequen-<br>
cies than for high frequencies.<br>
A great benefit of the present invention is that a backwards<br>
compatibility of a spatial audio encoding and decoding scheme<br>
with matrix based solutions is achieved without having to in-<br>
troduce additional hard- or software when the encoding and<br>
decoding rules of the spatial audio coders are chosen appro-<br>
priately.<br>
Furthermore, the compatibility is achieved without having to<br>
transmit additional data, as it is the case in other prior<br>
art attempts. The coding scheme according to the present in-<br>
vention is furthermore extremely flexible, as it allows a<br>
seamless adjustment of the bit-rate or the quality, i.e. a<br>
smooth transition between full matrix based coding to full<br>
spatial audio coding of a given signal. That is, the coding<br>
scheme applied can be adjusted to the actual needs, either<br>
with respect to the required bit-rate or with respect to the<br>
desired quality.<br><br>

Detailed description of the preferred embodiments<br>
Fig. 1 shows an inventive multi-channel encoder. The multi-<br>
channel encoder 100 is having a parameter generator 102 and<br>
an output interface 104.<br>
A multi-channel audio signal 106 is input into the encoder<br>
100, where a first portion 108 and a second portion 110 of<br>
the multi-channel signal 106 are processed. The parameter ge-<br>
nerator 102 receives the first portion 108 and the second<br>
portion 110 and derives spatial parameters describing spatial<br>
properties of the multi-channel signal 106.<br>
The spatial parameters are transferred to the output inter-<br>
face 104 that derives a parametric representation 112 of the<br>
multi-channel signal 106 such that the parametric representa-<br>
tion 112 includes first parametric data for a first portion<br>
108 of the multi-channel signal and wherein for a second por-<br>
tion 110 of the multi-channel signal 106 second parametric<br>
data requiring less information than the first parametric<br>
data or no parametric data is included in the parametric<br>
representation 112.<br>
Several variations of the multi-channel encoder 100 are pos-<br>
sible to achieve the same goal. For example, the parameter<br>
generator 102 can apply two different parameter deriving ru-<br>
les on the first portion 108 and on the second portion 110<br>
that result in different parameter sets that are then trans-<br>
ferred to the output interface 104 that combines the differ-<br>
ent parameter sets into the parametric representation 112. A<br>
special and preferred case is that for the second portion 110<br>
no parameters are included in the parametric representation<br><br>
(and therefore not derived by the parameter generator 102)<br>
since on a decoder side the decoder derives the required de-<br>
coding parameters by some heuristic rules.<br>
Another possibility is that the parameter generator 102 de-<br>
rives a full set of spatial audio parameters as well for the<br>
first portion 108 as for the second portion 110. Hence, the<br>
output interface 104 would have to process the spatial pa-<br>
rameters such that the second parametric data require less<br>
bits than the first parametric data.<br>
Furthermore, the output interface 104 could add an additional<br>
window signal to the parametric representation 112 that shall<br>
signal to a decoder, how the multi-channel signal 106 was<br>
split into the first portion 108 and into the second portion<br>
110 during the encoding. In a modification of the preferred<br>
embodiment of a multi-channel encoder 100, the multi-channel<br>
encoder 100 may additionally have a portion decider for de-<br>
ciding, which part of the multi-channel signal 106 is used as<br>
the first portion 108 and which part is used as the second<br>
portion 110, the decision being based on a quality criterion.<br>
The quality criterion can be derived with respect to a re-<br>
sulting total bit-rate of the parametric representation 112<br>
or with respect to quality aspects, taking into account the<br>
perceptual quality of a reproduction of the multi-channel<br>
signal 106 based on the parametric representation 112.<br>
A major advantage is that the bit-rate consumed by the para-<br>
metric representation can thus be varied in time, assuring<br>
that the quality criterion is met at any time during the en-<br>
coding while allowing for an overall reduction of the re-<br>
quired bit-rate compared to prior art methods.<br><br>
Fig. 2 shows an example of a parametric representation 112<br>
created by an inventive encoder.<br>
As mentioned above, the processing of the audio signals is<br>
done block-wise, i.e. a number of subsequent samples of the<br>
multi-channel signal in the time domain, building a so-called<br>
frame, is processed in one step. Fig. 2 shows a parameter<br>
bit-stream, i.e. a parametric representation for two consecu-<br>
tive frames. The parameter bit-stream is having a representa-<br>
tion of a high-quality frame 120 and a representation of a<br>
lower quality frame 122. During the encoding of the high-<br>
quality frame 120, the decision was taken that the first por-<br>
tion 108 , which is being represented by parametric data has<br>
to be big compared to the second portion, which may for exam-<br>
ple be the case if the audio scene to encode is rather com-<br>
plex. The parameter bit-stream of Fig. 2 is furthermore cre-<br>
ated under the assumption that a preferred embodiment of an<br>
inventive encoder is used that does not derive any parametric<br>
data for the second portion 110 of the multi-channel signal<br>
106. As can be seen in Fig. 2, 28 spatial parameters ICC and<br>
ICLD are included in the parametric representation to de-<br>
scribe the high-quality frame 120. For example, the 28 spa-<br>
tial parameters describe the lower frequency bands of a QMF<br>
representation of the multi-channel signal. <br>
The lower quality frame 122 comprises only 21 spatial parame-<br>
ter sets having ICC and ICLD parameters as this was found to<br>
be sufficient for the desired perceptual quality.<br>
Fig. 2a shows an inventive transcoder 150. The inventive<br>
transcoder receives as an input an input bit stream 152 hav-<br>
ing a full set of spatial parameters describing a first<br><br>
frame 154 and a second frame 156 of a multi-channel audio<br>
signal.<br>
The transcoder 150 generates a bit stream 158 holding a para-<br>
metric representation representing the spatial properties of<br>
the multi-channel audio signal. In the example shown in<br>
Fig. 2a, the transcoder 150 derives the parametric represen-<br>
tation such that for the first frame the number of parame-<br>
ters 160 is only slightly decreased. The number of parame-<br>
ters 162 describing the second frame corresponding to the in-<br>
put parameters 156 are strongly decreased, which reduces the<br>
amount of bit rate needed by the resulting parametric repre-<br>
sentation significantly. Such an inventive transcoder 150 can<br>
therefore be used to post-process an already existing bit<br>
stream of spatial parameters to derive an inventive paramet-<br>
ric representation requiring less bit rate during transmis-<br>
sion or less storage space when stored on a computer-readable<br>
medium. It should be noted here that it is of course also<br>
possible to implement a transcoder for transcoding in the<br>
other direction, i.e. using the parametric representation to<br>
generate spatial parameters.<br>
The inventive transcoder 150 can be implemented in various<br>
different ways, as for example by reducing the amount of pa-<br>
rameters with a given rule or by additionally receiving the<br>
multi-channel audio signal to analyze the reduction of bit<br>
rate possible without disturbing the perceptual quality be-<br>
yond an acceptable limit.<br>
Fig. 3 shows an inventive multi-channel audio decoder 200 ha-<br>
ving a processor 202.<br><br>
The processor is receiving as an input a down-mix signal 204<br>
derived from a multi-channel audio signal, first parametric<br>
data 206 describing a first portion of the multi-channel sig-<br>
nal and, for a second portion of the multi-channel signal,<br>
optional second parametric data 208 reguiring less bits than<br>
the first parametric data 206. The processor 202 is deriving<br>
an intermediate signal 210 from the down-mix signal 204 using<br>
a first deriving rule for deriving a high-quality portion 212<br>
of the intermediate signal, wherein the high-quality portion<br>
212 of the intermediate signal 212 is corresponding to the<br>
first portion of the multi-channel audio signal. The proces-<br>
sor 202 is using a second deriving rule for a second portion<br>
214 of the intermediate signal 210, wherein the second deriv-<br>
ing rule is using the second parametric data or no parametric<br>
data and wherein the first deriving rule is depending on the<br>
first parametric data 206.<br>
The intermediate signal 210 derived by the processor 202 is<br>
built from a combination of the high-quality portion 212 and<br>
of the second portion 214.<br>
The multi-channel audio decoder 200 may derive by itself,<br>
which portions of the down-mix signal 204 are to be processed<br>
with the first parametric data 206 by applying some appropri-<br>
ate rules, for example counting the number of spatial parame-<br>
ters included in the first parametric data 206. Alterna-<br>
tively, the processor 202 may be signalled the fractions of<br>
the high-quality portion 212 and of the second portion 214<br>
within the down-mix signal 204 by some additional window in-<br>
formation which is derived on an encoder side and that is ad-<br>
ditionally transmitted to the multi-channel audio decoder<br>
200.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, the second parametric data 208 is<br>
omitted and the processor 202 derives the second deriving<br>
rule from information already contained in the down-mix sig-<br>
nal 204.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a further embodiment of the present invention<br>
that combines the inventive feature of matrix compatibility<br>
in a spatial audio decoder. The multi-channel audio decoder<br>
600 comprises a pre-de-correlator 601, a de-correlator 602<br>
and a mix-matrix 603.<br>
The multi-channel audio decoder 600 is a flexible device al-<br>
lowing to operate in different modi depending on the configu-<br>
ration of input signals 605 input into the pre-de-correlator<br>
601. Generally, the pre-de-correlator 601 derives intermedi-<br>
ate signals 607 that serve as input for the de-correlator 602<br>
and that are partially transmitted unaltered to form, to-<br>
gether with decorrelated signals calculated by the de-<br>
correlator 602, input signals 608. The input signals 608 are<br>
the signals input into the mix-matrix 603 that derives output<br>
channel configurations 610a or 610b, depending on the input<br>
channel configuration 605.<br>
In a 1-to-5 configuration, a down-mix signal and an optional<br>
residual signal is supplied to the pre-de-correlator 601,<br>
that derives four intermediate signals (el to e4) that are<br>
used as an input of the de-correlator, which derives four de-<br>
correlated signals (d1 to d4) that form the input parameters<br>
608 together with a directly transmitted signal m derived<br>
from the input signal.<br>
It may be noted, that in the case where an additional resid-<br>
ual signal is supplied as input, the de-correlator 602 that<br><br>
is generally working in a sub-band domain, may be operative<br>
to simply forward the residual signal instead of deriving a<br>
de-correlated signal. This may also be done in a frequency<br>
selective manner for certain frequency bands only.<br>
In the 2-to-5 configuration the input signals 605 comprise a<br>
left channel, a right channel and optionally a residual sig-<br>
nal. In that configuration, the pre-de-correlator matrix 601<br>
derives a left, a right and a center channel and in addition<br>
two intermediate channels (el, e2). Hence, the input signals<br>
to the mix-matrix 603 are formed by the left channel, the<br>
right channel, the centre channel, and two de-correlated sig-<br>
nals (d1 and d2).<br>
In a further modification, the pre-de-correlator matrix may<br>
derive an additional intermediate signal (e5) that is used as<br>
an input for a de-correlator (D5) whose output is a combina-<br>
tion of the de-correlated signal (d5) derived from the signal<br>
(e5) and the de-correlated signals (dl and d2). In this case,<br>
an additional de-correlation can be guaranteed between the<br>
centre channel and the left and the right channel.<br>
The inventive audio decoder 600 implements the inventive con-<br>
cept in the 2-to-5 configuration. The transmitted parametric<br>
representation is used in the pre-de-correlation matrix 601<br>
and in the mix-matrix 603. There, the inventive concept can<br>
be implemented in different ways as shown in more detail in<br>
Fig. 5.<br>
Fig. 5 shows the	pre-de-correlator, implemented as pre-<br>
decorrelator-matrix	601 and the mix-matrix 603 in a principle<br>
sketch, wherein the	other components of the multi-channel au-<br>
dio decoder 600 are omitted.<br><br>
The matrix used to perform the pre-de-correlation and the<br>
mixing has columns that represent time slots, i.e. the indi-<br>
vidual time samples of a signal and rows that represent the<br>
different parameter bands, i.e. each row is associated with<br>
one parameter band of an audio signal.<br>
According to the concept of the present invention, the matrix<br>
elements of the matrices 601 and 603 are only partly derived<br>
from transmitted parametric data, wherein the remaining ma-<br>
trix elements are derived by the decoder, based for example<br>
on knowledge of the down-mix signal. Fig. 5 shows one example<br>
where below a given frequency border line 622 the elements of<br>
the pre-de-correlator matrix 601 and the mix-matrix 603 are<br>
derived from parameters 620 that are read from the bit-<br>
stream, i.e. based on information transmitted from the en-<br>
coder. Above the frequency borderline 622 the matrix elements<br>
are derived in the decoder based on knowledge of the down-mix<br>
signal only.<br>
The border frequency (or in general: the amount of matrix e-<br>
lements derived from transmitted data) can be freely adapted<br>
according to the quality and/or bit-rate constraints that ha-<br>
ve to be met for the particular application scenario.<br>
It is preferred for the novel coding method outlined here<br>
that a side-information free up-mix process may be performed<br>
with the same structure that has been outlined in the MPEG<br>
Spatial Audio Coding Reference Model 0. This invention may<br>
consist in describing a method for side-information free up-<br>
mix, but preferably provides a method for seamless and advan-<br>
tageous combination of such concepts with methods for side-<br>
information assisted up-mix.<br><br>
In contrary to the MPEG Spatial Audio Coding Reference Model<br>
0, in the side-information free up-mix process the elements<br>
of the matrices Ml (601) and M2(603) are preferably not de-<br>
rived from data transmitted in a bit-stream but by different<br>
means without the help of side-information, e.g. by applying<br>
heuristic rules based only on knowledge achieved from the<br>
down-mix signal.<br>
In this way it is possible to achieve a gradual scaling be-<br>
tween both techniques - in terms of bit-rate as well as in<br>
terms of sound quality - by acquiring only parts of the ma-<br>
trices based on the transmitted parameters and applying the<br>
rules of the method without side-information to fill up the<br>
remaining parts. Conceptually speaking, this corresponds to<br>
transmitting for certain parts of the matrices the spatial<br>
parameters and for other parts generating them at the de-<br>
coder.<br>
The determination of the parts of matrices that are to be de-<br>
rived from either the one ore the other method can be done in<br>
a lot of different ways, such as<br>
•	deriving the parts of the matrices below a given hori-<br>
zontal border line by one method and above this border<br>
line by the other method;<br>
•	deriving the parts of the matrices left of a given ver-<br>
tical border line by one method and right from this bor-<br>
der line by the other method;<br>
•	determining arbitrary time-frequency tiles within both<br>
matrices the elements of which are derived by one method<br>
and deriving the elements of the remaining time-<br>
frequency tiles by means of the other method.<br><br>
It has been detailed in the above paragraphs that it is ad-<br>
vantageous to describe all frequency parts of a multi-channel<br>
signal up to a certain border frequency by spatial parameters<br>
whereas the remaining frequency parts of the multi-channel<br>
signal are not represented by spatial parameters. This takes<br>
into account the characteristics of the human ear that has a<br>
better perception of lower frequencies than of higher fre-<br>
quencies. Of course, the present invention is by no means li-<br>
mited to this splitting of the multi-channel signal into a<br>
first portion and a second portion as it may also be advanta-<br>
geous or appropriate to describe higher frequency parts of<br>
the signal with better accuracy. This may especially be the<br>
case when in the lower frequency region only little energy is<br>
contained in the signal since most of the energy is contained<br>
in a high-frequency domain of the audio signal. Due to mask-<br>
ing effects the low-frequency part will be mostly dominated<br>
by the high frequency parts then and it may be advantageous<br>
to provide the possibility for a high-quality reproduction of<br>
the high-frequency part of the signal.<br>
Depending on certain implementation requirements of the in-<br>
ventive methods, the inventive methods can be implemented in<br>
hardware or in software. The implementation can be performed<br>
using a digital storage medium, in particular a disk, DVD or<br>
a CD having electronically readable control signals stored<br>
thereon, which cooperate with a programmable computer system<br>
such that the inventive methods are performed. Generally, the<br>
present invention is, therefore, a computer program product<br>
with a program code stored on a machine readable carrier, the<br>
program code being operative for performing the inventive<br>
methods when the computer program product runs on a computer.<br>
In other words, the inventive methods are, therefore, a com-<br>
puter program having a program code for performing at least<br><br>
one of the inventive methods when the computer program runs<br>
on a computer.<br>
While the foregoing has been particularly shown and described<br>
with reference to particular embodiments thereof, it will be<br>
understood by those skilled in the art that various other<br>
changes in the form and details may be made without departing<br>
from the spirit and scope thereof. It is to be understood<br>
that various changes may be made in adapting to different em-<br>
bodiments without departing from the broader concepts dis-<br>
closed herein and comprehended by the claims that follow.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
TITLE : "MULTI-CHANNEL AUDIO DECODER AND ENCODER AND METHOD<br>
FOR PROCESSING AUDIO SIGNAL"<br>
The invention relates to a multi-channel audio decoder for processing an audio<br>
signal and for processing first parametric data describing a first portion of a<br>
multi-channel signal, wherein for a second portion of the multi-channel signal no<br>
parametric data or second parametric data is processed, the second parametric<br>
data requiring less information units than the first parametric data when<br>
describing an identical portion of the multi-channel signal, comprising: a<br>
processor for deriving an intermediate signal from the audio signal, using a first<br>
deriving a first portion of the intermediate signal, the first portion of the<br>
intermediate signal corresponding to the first portion of the multi-channel audio<br>
signal, wherein the first deriving rule is depending on the first parametric data;<br>
and using a second deriving rule for deriving a second portion of the<br>
intermediate signal, the second deriving rule using no parametric data or the<br>
second parametric data, wherein the processor is operative to calculate the<br>
second deriving rule from information on the audio signal or from the second<br>
parametric data.</td>
