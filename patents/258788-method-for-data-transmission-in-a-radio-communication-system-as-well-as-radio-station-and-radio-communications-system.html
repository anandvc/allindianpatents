Description<br>
The invention concerns a method for data transmission via an air interface in a radio communication system as well as a respective first radio station and a respective radio commu-. nications system.<br>
For conventional joint transmission, e.g. in a radio communi-cation system, a central unit receives data from a backbone network for all connected terminals (e.g. mobile stations), which are simultaneously scheduled to receive the data from radio stations over an air interface, and calculates depend-ent on the overall channel matrix H an according weighting matrix W - e.g. for zero forcing (ZF) the pseudo inverse of H for pre processing of the data before transmission. The cen-tral unit includes the common medium access control (MAC) as well as the MU-MIMO (Multi User-Minimum Input Maximum Output) pre-processing for all radio stations transmitting the data.<br>
A cooperative antenna system based on joint transmis-sion/joint detection, for example the service area concept as described in T. Weber, M. Meurer, W. Zirwas, "Low Complexity Energy Efficient Joint Transmission for OFDM Multiuser Downlinks", Proc. IEEE PIMRC 2004 Barcelona, Spain, is essen-tially a distributed MU-MIMO system involving several advan-tages.<br>
Firstly a cooperative antenna system exploits the free avail-able spatial dimension as well known for all MIMO systems. In case of spatial multiplexing the capacity may be enhanced by factors. MU-MIMO systems have the additional advantage of low cost terminals, e.g. mobile stations, which might be equipped with only one or two antenna elements.<br>
2<br><br>
Due to the distributed nature of e.g. the service area con-cept where several adjacent ~ but geographically far off placed - radio stations, e.g. base stations, are used as transmit antennas full macro diversity gains are available. The most important advantage for cellular radio systems is probably the avoidance of inter cell interference (ICI) be-tween radio stations of a service area due to the cooperation in the central unit. In conventional cellular radio communi-cation systems the overall spectral efficiency is signifi-cantly decreased compared to the spectral efficiency of a single cell due to the ICI especially at cell border. For a service area with joint transmission ICI increases spectral efficiency even beyond that of a single isolated cell due to rank enhancement, i.e. the number of uncorrelated transmis-sion channels and therefore the rank of the channel matrix increases.<br>
In spite of these many advantages there is still some reluc-tance to apply such system concepts. One of the main reasons is the required central unit, which would require a hierar-chical network structure. The vision of network planers is a flat hierarchy which allows for economy of scale for the hardware of radio stations and which is fast and easily de-ployable.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an improved method for data transmission via an air interface in a radio communication system, which enables joint transmission even in radio communications systems with a flat hierarchy. It is a further object of the invention to provide a respective first radio station as well as a respective radio communica-tions system.<br>
The object is achieved by a method for data transmission via an air interface in a radio communication system, a first ra-dio station and a radio communications system according to independent claims.<br>
3<br><br>
Advantageous embodiments are subject matter of dependent claims.<br>
According to the inventive method for data transmission via an air interface in a radio communication system, a first signal containing at least first data multiplied by a first weight factor is transmitted from a first radio station to at least a first terminal. The first weight factor is calculated taking into account at least a second weight factor to be used by a second radio station for transmission of a second signal containing at least the first data multiplied by the second weight factor such that simultaneous reception of at least both the first signal and the second signal at the first terminal will cause the first data to be substantially cancelled. According to the invention, the first weight vec-tor is calculated by the first radio station taking into ac-count at least first and second channel state information re-ceived from the first terminal, the first channel state in-formation relating to a first transmission channel from the first radio station to the first terminal and the second channel state information relating to a second transmission channel from the second radio station to the first terminal.<br>
By substantially cancelling the first data at the first ter-minal, interference caused by first data transmitted by the second radio station can at least be reduced or even can-celled completely. If the first radio station transmits fur-ther data simultaneously with the weighted first data, the further data is received at the first terminal with at least reduced interference. Therefore decoding of the further data is facilitated.<br>
4<br><br>
Advantageously the first signal contains second data multi-plied by a third weight factor, the third weight factor being calculated taking into account at least a fourth weight fac-tor to be used by the second radio station for  transmission of the second signal additionally containing the second data multiplied by  the fourth weight factor, such that simultane-ous reception of at least both the first signal and the sec-ond signal at the second terminal causes the second data to be substantially cancelled while the first data can be de-coded by the second terminal, and the third weight factor is calculated by the first radio station taking into account third and fourth channel state information received from the second terminal, the third channel state information relating to a third transmission channel from the second radio station .to the second terminal and the fourth channel state informa-tion relating to a fourth transmission channel from the first radio station to the first terminal.<br>
The first radio station is enabled to transmit the second data to the second terminal such that simultaneous reception of the second data transmitted from the second radio station substantially cancel each other out at the second station. This enables the first radio station to transmit the first data without interference to the second.terminal while the second radio station transmits the second data.<br>
Advantageously simultaneous reception of at least the first signal and the second signal enables the first terminal to decode the second data.<br>
Advantageously the second weight factor and the fourth weight factor are calculated by the second radio station taking into account the first and second channel state information re-<br>
5<br><br>
ceived by the first terminal and the third and fourth channel state information received by the second terminal in the same manner as being done by the first radio station to calculate the first weight factor and the third weight factor.<br>
Advantageously the first radio station broadcasts first pilot signals to be used for channel estimation together with a first identifier of the first terminal and/or the second ra-dio station broadcasts second pilot signals to be used for channel estimation together with a second identifier of the second terminal.<br>
According to an embodiment the first radio station addition-ally broadcasts a third identifier to identify the first ra-dio station and/or the second radio station additionally broadcasts a fourth identifier to identify the second radio station.<br>
Advantageously the first, second, third, and fourth channel state information are received via broadcast transmissions.<br>
Preferably third pilot signals of the first terminal and fourth pilot signals of the second terminal are received via broadcast transmissions, the third pilot signals and the fourth pilot signals being used for estimation of transmis-sion channels.from the first terminal and the second terminal to the first radio station and second radio station.<br>
According to a further embodiment - after simultaneous recep-tion of the first signal and the second signal at the first terminal and at the second terminal - a first feedback signal relating to an amount of interference from first data not cancelled by the simultaneous reception of the first signal<br>
6<br><br>
and the second signal  is  received  from the first terminal at the first radio station or/and. a second feedback signal re-lating to an a'mount of interference from second data not can-celled by the simultaneous reception of the first signal and the second signal is received from the second terminal at the second radio station.<br>
Advantageously the first radio station uses the first feed-back signal to change the first weight factor for a subse-quent transmission of first data multiplied by the changed first weight factor, whereas the first weight factor is changed such that the subsequent transmission would cause the first data to be completely cancelled at the first terminal provided the respective transmission channels as well as the second weight factor used by the second radio station remain unchanged or/and the second radio station uses the second feedback signal to change the fourth weight factor for a sub-sequent transmission of second data multiplied by the changed fourth weight factor, whereas the fourth weight factor is changed such that the subsequent transmission would cause the second data to be completely cancelled at the second terminal provided the respective transmission channels as well as the third weight factor used by the first radio station remain unchanged.<br>
Advantageously the first feedback signal additionally indi-cates that the first terminal has not been able to correctly decode the second data and/or the second feedback signal ad-ditionally indicates that the second terminal has not been able to correctly decode the first data.<br>
The inventive first radio station for a radio communications system, comprises means for transmitting a first signal con-<br>
7<br><br>
taining at least first data multiplied by a first weight fac-tor from the first radio station to at least a first termi-nal, means for calculating the first weight factor taking into account at least a second weight factor to be used by a second radio station for transmission of a second signal con-taining at least the first data multiplied by the second weight factor, such that simultaneous reception of at least both the first signal and the second signal at the first ter minal will cause the first data to be substantially can-celled. Further, the means for calculation the first weight vector are configured such that the first weight vector is calculated taking into account at least first and second channel state information received from the first terminal, the first channel state information relating to a first transmission channel from the first radio station to the first terminal and the second channel state information re-lating to a second transmission channel from the second radio station to the first terminal.<br>
The inventive first radio station particularly comprises all means necessary to perform all method steps according to em-bodiments of the inventive method.<br>
The inventive radio communication system comprises at least an inventive first radio station, a second radio station, a first terminal and a second terminal, having all means neces-sary to perform the inventive method.<br>
In the following the invention is described according to em-bodiments shown in figures:<br>

A radio station is for example a base station of a radio com-munications system.<br>
A terminal is for instance a mobile radio terminal, particu-larly a mobile phone or a flexible of fixed device, for transmission of picture data and/or sound data, for fax, short message service (SMS) messages and/or E-mail messages, and/or for internet access.<br>
The invention can advantageously be used in any kind of com-munications system. A communications system is for example a computer network or a radio communications system.<br>
Radio communications systems are systems in which a data transmission between terminals is performed over an air in-terface. The data transmission can be both bidirectional and unidirectional. Radio communications systems are particularly cellular radio communication systems, e.g. according to the GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) standard or the UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System) standard. Also future mobile radio communications systems, e.g. accord-ing to the fourth generation, as well as ad-hoc-networks shall be understood as radio communication systems. Radio<br>
9<br><br>
communication systems are also wireless local area networks (WLAN) according to standards from the Institute of Electri-cal and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) like 802.11a-i, Hiper-LAN1 and HiperLAN2 (High Performance Radio Local Area Net-work) as well as Bluetooth-Networks.<br>
In the following, the invention is described in a radio com-munication system with synchronized OFDM, i.e. all radio sta-tion and terminals are synchronized in frequency and time. But even in an unsynchronized system the invention can be used, provided that radio stations and terminals involved in a joint transmission according to the invention are synchro-nized before performing the inventive method, e.g. by trans-mission of synchronization signals from a backbone network to the respective radio stations and terminals, e.g. by insert-ing the synchronization signals into data to be transmitted.<br>
Figure 1 shows a first radio station BS1 comprising a first Processor PI and a second radio station BS2 comprising a sec-ond processor P2, the processors PI, P2 being used for con-trolling the respective operation, particularly data recep-tion, data transmission and data processing, of the first ra-dio Station BS1 and the second radio station BS2. The first radio station BS1 and the second radio station BS2 are part of a radio communication system using e.g. OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex) and OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) for data transmission and for sepa-ration of terminals. The'first radio station BS1 and the sec-ond radio station BS2 are connected via a backbone network RAN, e.g. a radio access network, using e.g. cables or fi-bers. Data transmission in the backbone network RAN supports multicasting of data packets and is for example based on IP (Internet Protocol), STM (Synchronous Transfer Mode), ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) or Ethernet.<br>
A first terminal MSI is assigned to the first radio station BS1 and is supposed to receive second data X1 over a first<br><br><br>
transmission channel mathematically described by a first channel state information h11. A second terminal MS2 is as-signed to the second radio station BS2 and is supposed to re-ceive first data x2 over a third transmission channel mathe-matically described by a third channel state information h22. The first terminal MSI comprises a third processor P3 and the second terminal MS2 comprises a fourth processor P4, the processors P3, P4 being used for controlling operation of the first terminal MSI and the second terminal MS2. The first terminal MSI will also receive signals transmitted from the second radio station BS2 to the second terminal MS2 over a second transmission channel mathematically described by a second channel state information h21. Further, the second terminal MS2 will receive signals transmitted from the first radio station BS1 to the first terminal MSI over a fourth transmission channel mathematically described by a fourth channel state information h12.<br>
To substantially cancel interference caused by first data x2 at the first terminal MS1 and caused by second data x1 at the second terminal MS2, joint transmission is used. The first radio station BS1 transmits a first signal x10 containing the second data x1 multiplied by a third weight factor w21 and the first data x2 multiplied by a first weight factor w22 while the second radio station BS2 simultaneously transmits a sec-ond signal containing the first data x3 multiplied by a sec-ond weight factor w22 and the second data x1 multiplied by a fourth weight factor wi2. So as a first step the first radio station BS1 and the second radio station BS2 both have to store the first data and the second data  e.g. in a FIFO (First In First Out) memory. For this purpose a multicast connection is installed from the backbone network RAN to the first radio station BS1 and the second radio station BS2. As according to the invention no central unit is present, each radio station BS1, BS2 calculates its weight matrix contain-ing the weight factors w11, wi2, w21, w22 independently.<br><br><br>
The main formulas (1) for a 2x2 joint transmission system e,g. with zero forcing according to Figure 1 is given below (all variables complex):<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
A first receive signal at the first terminal MS1 is given by r1 and a second receive signal at the second terminal MS2 is given by r2. The first receive signal and the second receive signal are for simplicity given without noise but the inven¬tion is certainly equivalently applicable with noise. The goal of the zero forcing joint transmission is to maximize<br>
T<br>
for [r1 r2] the diagonal elements and to  set the off-diagonal elements (interference terms) to zero. To calculate the weight factors w11, W12, w21, w22 each radio station BS1, BS2 has to estimate all radio channels from each radio station BS1, BS2 to each terminal MSI, MS2, i.e. all channel state information h11 h12 h21,   h22.<br>
For clarity reasons, the invention is described with two ra-dio stations and two terminals each having one antenna for transmission and reception. The invention is certainly not limited to this number of radio stations and terminals and can be equivalently implemented with more than two radio sta-tions and more than two terminals each having more than one antenna for transmission and/or reception. In this case only the matrices used for calculations will have additional rows and or columns representing the additional radio stations, terminals and/or antennas.<br>
12<br><br>
A time diagram including channel estimation and joint trans-mission is shown in Figure 2. Besides channel  estimation autonomous scheduling at the first and second radio station BS1, BS2 is a major challenge of the distributed approach ac-cording to the invention. To accomplish this, the MAC layer and the physical layer are separated.<br>
In a first step the first radio station BS1 decides to sched-ule the first terminal MSI for reception of the second data x1 in a first transmission time interval (TTI) while the sec-ond radio station BS2 decides to schedule the second terminal for reception of the first data X2 in the first transmission time interval. The decision which terminal is  scheduled in the first transmission time interval is taken independently by the first and the second radio station BS1, BS2 and de-pends e.g. from parameters as channel quality, quality of service classes of terminals or buffer length of a buffer used to store data to be transmitted.<br>
In a next step he first radio station BS1 broadcasts first pilot signals PS1 to be used for channel estimation together with a first identifier IDMSl of the first terminal MSI which indicates the first terminal MSI to be scheduled in the first transmission time interval while the second radio station BS2 broadcasts second pilot signals PS2 to be used for channel estimation together with a second identifier IDMS2 of the second terminal MS2 which indicates the second terminal MS2 to be scheduled in the first transmission time interval. The first and second pilot signals PS1, PS2 are for example or-thogonal pilot grids as shown in Figure 3, i.e. the first and second pilot signals PSl, PS2 use different sub-carriers. It is certainly also within the scope of the invention to use more or even less than, two sub-carriers as first and/or sec-ond pilot signals PSl, PS2.<br>
According to figure 3 orthogonal pilot grids are used to en-able the first and second terminal to distinguish pilot sig-<br>
13<br><br>
nals of the first and second radio station. According to an-other embodiment, not shown in the figures, a third identi-fier to identify the first radio station BS1 and a fourth identifier to identify the second radio station BS2 is addi-tionally broadcasted by the first and second radio station BSl, BS2 respectively instead of orthogonal pilot grids used according to figure 3.<br>
Reception of the first and second pilot signals PS1, PS2 pro-vides the first terminal MSI with a first and second analogue receive signals h11 and h'22 which can be used to estimate the first and second channel state information h11 and h21 The second terminal MS2 is provided with third and fourth analogue receive signals h'22 and h'l2 which can be used to estimate the third and fourth channel state information h22 and h12 In the following step the first and second terminal MSI, MS2 broadcast their analogue receive signals h'n, h'21 h'22 and hf 12 together with own pilot signals PS3, PS4 over orthogonal pilot grids according to Figure 4. Additionally the first terminal MSI transmits the first identifier IDMS1 and the second terminal MS2 transmits the second identifier IDMS2. Further, information is broadcasted which enables the first and second radio station BSl, BS2, to identify from . which pilot signals PS1, PS2 a broadcasted analogue receive signal originates, e.g. a respective identifier of the first or second radio station BSl, BS2 is broadcasted together with the respective analogue receive signal (not shown in the fig-ure) .<br>
As especially the transmission channels from the first radio station BSl to the second terminal MS2 and from the second radio station BS2 to the first terminal MSI might be weak, having e.g. high path losses, the broadcasts send by the first and second terminal MSI, MS2 can use higher power than regular data transmission, e.g. + 20dB, and/or a more robust transmission mode, e.g. by repetition of the broadcast over several time frames or sub-carriers, can be chosen.<br>
14<br><br>
The first and second radio station BSl, BS2 each performs an estimation of all channel state information ]  and calculates the four weight factors  The<br>
first radio station BSl calculates and transmits the first signal   and the second radio station BS2 calculates and transmits the second signal e.g. according to formulas (1). The first terminal MSI simultaneously receives the first and the second signal  as the first receive signal , decodes the second data  and measures a first interference value IF1 relating to interference from the first data x2 contained in the first receive signal . The second terminal MS2 simultaneously receives the first and the second signal<br>
  as the second receive signal r2, decodes the first data " and measures a second interference value IF2 relating to interference from the second data Xi contained in the sec-ond receive signal r2. A measure for the respective interfer-ence value is e.g. the variance of the respective receive signal in respect of constellation points according to a modulation scheme (e.g. 2n QAM [Quadrature Amplitude Modula-tion]) used for data transmission. Additionally or. alterna-tively, the terminals can be provided with predefined time slots in each of which data is only transmitted from one ra-dio station to a single terminal, so that measurements at the other terminals give directly the respective interference value. The number of predefined time slots has to be the same as the number of terminals involved in the joint transmis-sion. It is further possible to use predefined time slots in which a terminal retransmits an analogue receive signal back to its serving radio station, the analogue receive signal re-lating to data transmitted beforehand from its serving radio station. The serving radio station knows which data it has transmitted and therefore can calculate the interference con-tained in the analogue receive signal after having estimated the data. Instead of the analogue receive signal, the termi-nal can preferably estimate the data itself, retransmit the estimated data and by comparison of estimated data and trans-<br>
15<br><br>
mitted data, the serving radio station can calculate the in-terference, e.g. a respective correction vector.<br>
As the first and second signal are not calculated by a cen-tral unit it is possible that the first and second radio sta-tion BS1, BS2 calculate different channel state information<br>
  and therefore also different weight factors   . This results in the first and second inter-ference values IF1, IF2 measured by the first and second ter-minal MSI, MS2.<br>
The first terminal MSI transmits a first feedback signal FBI related to the first interference value IF1 to the first ra-dio station BS1, e.g. using a dedicated channel. The first feedback signal FBI is either the first interference value IF1 itself or it is used by the first radio station BS1 to calculate the first interference value IF1. According to the interference deduced from the first feedback value the first radio station BS1 changes the first weight factor W21 for a subsequent transmission of first data, e.g. in the next transmission time interval, such that the subsequent trans-mission would cause the first data to be completely cancelled at the first terminal MSI provided the respective transmis-sion channels as well as the second weight factor w22 used by the second radio station remain unchanged.<br>
The second terminal MS2 transmits a second feedback signal FB2 related to the second interference value IF2 to the sec-ond radio station BS1, e.g. using a dedicated channel. The second feedback signal FB2 is either the second interference value IF2 itself or it is used by the second radio station BS2 to calculate the second interference value IF2. According to the interference deduced from the second feedback value FB2 the second radio station BS2 changes the fourth weight factor W12 for a subsequent transmission of second data, e.g. in the next transmission time interval, such that the subse-quent transmission would cause the second data to be com-<br>

pletely cancelled at the second terminal MS2 provided the re-spective transmission channels as well as the third weight factor w11 used by the first radio station BS1 remain un-changed.<br>
First data and/or second data transmitted in the subsequent transmission is either the first and/or second data  transmitted in the first time interval or new data supposed to be received substantially interference free at the first and the second terminal respectively.<br>
Transmission of first and second feedback signals  can be done after each reception of data by the terminals, but to reduce signalling load it is preferred to transmit first and/or second feedback signals regularly but not in every transmission time interval.<br><br>
A time scale  usable for transmission of first and/or second feedback signals is implicitly given, if the feedback signals additionally indicate if a retransmission-of the first and second data is necessary. To enable retransmission of the first and second data X2, xi an embodiment not shown in the figures uses the first and second feedback signals addition¬ally as NACK (Not-Acknowledged) messages, whereas reception of a feedback signal indicates to the respective radio sta-tion BS1, BS2 that the first terminal MSI has not been able to correctly decode the second data and that the second terminal MS2 has not been able to decode the first data x2. After reception of a feedback signal the respective radio station changes the according weight factor and retransmits the data which has not been correctly decoded. In this em-bodiment feedback signals are only transmitted, if decoding in the respective terminal failed. No transmission and there-fore no reception of feedback signals indicate the respective radio station that the respective data has been correctly de-coded.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

It should be mentioned that this proposal supports TDD (Time Division Duplex) as well as FDD (Frequency Division Duplex) radio communication systems. For TDD the pilot signals of the terminals can be used to directly estimate channel state in-5  formation for the respective downlink channels while for FDD the pilot signals are used for determining the uplink chan-nels of the terminals for correctly detecting e.g. the ana-logue receive signals or for correctly decoding the estimated channel state information which in both cases are retransmit-10  ted by the terminals.<br>
