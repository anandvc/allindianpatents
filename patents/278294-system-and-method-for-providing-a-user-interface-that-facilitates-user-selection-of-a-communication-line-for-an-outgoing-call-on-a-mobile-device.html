				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING A USER INTERFACE THAT FACILITATES USER SELECTION OF A COMMUNICATION LINE FOR AN<br>
OUTGOING CALL ON A MOBILE DEVICE<br>
[0001]	Embodiments described herein relate generally to user interfaces<br>
provided by mobile device applications, and more specifically to mobile devices that allow outgoing calls to be made by a user on a communication line selected from a plurality of communication lines.<br>
[0002]	Many modern mobile devices are multi-functional. They may be<br>
configured to allow users to engage in both electronic mail ("e-mail") communications and telephone communications, for example. Additionally, it is common for a user to utilize the mobile device for different purposes. For example, a user may operate a single mobile device to engage in communications relating to both business and personal uses.<br>
[0003]	Phone-equipped mobile devices may be adapted to accommodate<br>
an Alternate Line Service (ALS) or similar service. With respect to these mobile devices, two (or more) phone numbers may be associated with a mobile device, with each phone number being associated with a different communication line. A user may wish to place an outgoing call on a specific communication line so that when the call is received by a receiving party, the phone number associated with that communication line will be identified on the receiving party's phone where "call display" functionality has been enabled on that phone. Use of multiple communication lines may also be useful for line-specific tracking purposes (e.g. to facilitate separate billing for long distance calls relating to business and personal uses).<br>
[0004]	Typically, in mobile device applications, only one communication line<br>
Is deemed to be "active" at any given time. Outgoing calls are placed on the active line until an alternate communication line is selected. Outgoing calls are generally initiated by a user from a call screen provided by an application (e.g. a phone application) residing and executing on the mobile device. When a user wishes to make an outgoing call on an alternate communication line, the user may need to change the current active line using a different application or in a separate screen, and then return to the call screen to place the call on the alternate communication line after the change is made.<br>
 <br>
General<br>
[0005]	In a broad aspect, there may be provided a method of providing a<br>
user interface that facilitates user selection of a communication line for an outgoing call on a mobile device, the mobile device providing access to a plurality of communication lines on which outgoing calls may be made by a user, the method comprising the steps of: displaying a call screen on a display of the mobile device; displaying data identifying a first of the plurality of communication lines in a first display field of the call screen; receiving a first input from the user, the first input comprising a direction to display, on the call screen, a line selection menu, wherein the line selection menu comprises data identifying at least a subset of the plurality of communication lines; displaying the line selection menu on the call screen after receiving the first input; receiving a second input from the user, the second input identifying a user-selected second communication line of the subset; and updating the first display field by displaying data identifying the second communication line in the first display field.<br>

Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
[0007]	Embodiments described herein are generally directed to a system<br>
and method for providing a user interface that allows mobile device users to<br>
change the active line on which an outgoing call may be placed.<br>
[0008]	In a broad aspect, there is provided a method of providing a user<br>
interface that facilitates user selection of a communication line for an outgoing call on a mobile device, the mobile device providing access to a plurality of communication lines on which outgoing calls may be made by a user, the method comprising the steps of: displaying a call screen on a display of the mobile device; displaying data identifying a first of the plurality of communication lines in a first display field of the call screen; receiving a first input from the user, the first input comprising a direction to display, on the call screen, a line selection menu, wherein the line selection menu comprises data identifying at least a subset of the plurality of communication lines; displaying the line selection menu on the call screen after receiving the first input; receiving a second input from the user, the second Input identifying a user-selected second communication line of the subset; and updating the first display field by displaying data identifying the second communication line in the first display field,<br>
[0009]	These and other aspects and features of various embodiments will<br>
be described in greater detail below.<br>
[0010]	Some embodiments described herein make use of a mobile station.<br>
A mobile station is a two-way communication device with advanced data communication capabilifies having the capability to communicate with other computer systems, and is also referred to herein generally as a mobile device. A mobile device may also include the capability for voice communications. Depending on the functionality provided by a mobile device, it may be referred to as a data messaging device, a two-way pager, a cellular telephone with data messaging capabilities, a wireless Internet appliance, or a data communication device (with or without telephony capabilities). A mobile device communicates with other devices through a network of transceiver stations.<br>
 <br>
[0011]	To aid the reader in understanding the structure of a mobile device<br>
and how it communicates with other devices, reference is made to FIGS. 1 through 3.<br>
[0012]	Referring first to FIG. 1, a block diagram of a mobile device in one<br>
example implementation is shown generally as 100. Mobile device 100 comprises a number of components, the controlling component being microprocessor 102. Microprocessor 102 controls the overall operation of mobile device 100. Communication functions, including data and voice communications, are performed through communication subsystem 104. Communication subsystem 104 receives messages from and sends messages to a wireless network 200. In this example implementation of mobile device 100, communication subsystem 104 is configured in accordance with the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) and General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) standards. The GSM/GPRS wireless network is used worldwide and it is expected that these standards will be superseded eventually by Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS). New standards are still being defined, but it is believed that they will have similarities to the network behaviour described herein, and it will also be understood by persons skilled in the art that the invention is intended to use any other suitable standards that are developed in the future. The wireless link connecting communication subsystem 104 with network 200 represents one or more different Radio Frequency (RF) channels, operating according to defined protocols specified for GSM/GPRS communications. With newer network protocols, these channels are capable of supporting both circuit switched voice communications and packet switched data communications.<br>
[0013]	Although the wireless network associated with mobile device 100 is<br>
a GSM/GPRS wireless network in one example implementation of mobile device 100, other wireless networks may also be associated with mobile device 100 in variant implementations. Different types of wireless networks that may be employed include, for example, data-centric wireless networks, voice-centric wireless networks, and dual-mode networks that can support both voice and data communications over the same physical base stations. Combined dual-mode networks include, but are not limited to, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) or<br>
 <br>
CDMA2000 networks, GSM/GPRS networks (as mentioned above), and future third-generation (3G) networks like EDGE and UMTS. Some older examples of data-centric networks include the Mobitex™ Radio Network and the DataTAC™ Radio Network. Examples of older voice-centric data networks include Personal Communication Systems (PCS) networks like GSM and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems.<br>
[0014]	Microprocessor 102 also interacts with additional subsystems such<br>
as a Random Access Memory (RAM) 106, flash memory 108, display 110,<br>
auxiliary input/output (I/O) subsystem 112, serial port 114, keyboard 116, speaker ■<br>
118, microphone 120, short-range communications 122 and other devices 124.<br>
[0015]	Some of the subsystems of mobile device 100 perform<br>
communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide "resident" or on-device functions.   By way of example, display 110 and keyboard 116 may be used for both communication-related functions, such as entering a text message for transmission over network 200, and device-resident functions such as a calculator or task list. Operating system software used by microprocessor 102 is typically stored in a persistent store such as flash memory 108, which may alternatively be a read-only memory (ROM) or similar storage element (not shown). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the operating system, specific device applications, or parts thereof, may be temporarily loaded into a volatile store such as RAM 106.<br>
[0016]	Mobile device 100 may send and receive communication signals<br>
over network 200 after required network registration or activation procedures have . been completed. Network access is associated with a subscriber or user of a mobile device 100. To identify a subscriber, mobile device 100 requires a Subscriber Identity Module or "SIM" card 126 to be inserted in a SIM interface 128 in order to communicate with a network. SIM 126 is one type of a conventional "smart card" used to identify a subscriber of mobile device 100 and to personalize the mobile device 100, among other things. Without SIM 126, mobile device 100 is not fully operational for communication with network 200. By inserting SIM 126 into SIM interface 128, a subscriber can access all subscribed services. Services could include: web browsing and messaging such as e-mail, voice mail, Short Message Service (SMS), and Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS). More<br>
 <br>
advanced services may include: point of sale, field service and sales force automation. SIM 126 includes a processor and memory for storing information. Once SIM 126 is inserted in SIM interface 128, it Is coupled to microprocessor 102. In order to identify the subscriber, SIM 126 contains some user parameters such as an International Mobile Subscriber identity (IMSI). An advantage of using SIM 126 is that a subscriber is not necessarily bound by any single physical mobile device. SIM 126 may store additional subscriber information for a mobile device as well, including datebook (or calendar) information and recent call information.<br>
[0017]	Mobile device 100 is a battery-powered device and includes a<br>
battery interface 132 for receiving one or more rechargeable batteries 130. Battery interface 132 is coupled to a regulator (not shown), which assists battery 130 in providing power V+ to mobile device 100. Although current technology makes use of a battery, future technologies such as micro fuel cells may provide the power to mobile device 100.<br>
[0018]	Microprocessor 102, in addition to its operating system functions,<br>
enables execution of software applications on mobile device 100. A set of applications that control basic device operations, including data and voice communication applications, will normally be installed on mobile device 100 during its manufacture. Another application that may be loaded onto mobile device 100 would be a personal information manager (PIM). A PIM has functionality to organize and manage data items of interest to a subscriber, such as, but not limited to, e-mail, calendar events, voice mails, appointments, and task Items.   A PIM application has the ability to send and receive data items via wireless network 200. PIM data items may be seamlessly integrated, synchronized, and updated via wireless network 200 with the mobile device subscriber's corresponding data items stored and/or associated with a host computer system. This functionality creates a mirrored host computer on mobile device 100 with respect to such items. This can be particularly advantageous where the host computer system is the mobile device subscriber's office computer system.<br>
[0019]	Additional applications may also be loaded onto mobile device 100<br>
through network 200, auxiliary I/O subsystem 112, serial port 114, short-range<br>
 <br>
communications subsystem 122, or any other suitable subsystem 124. This flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of mobile device 100 and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using mobile device 100.<br>
[0020]	Serial port 114 enables a subscriber to set preferences through an<br>
external device or software application and extends the capabilities of mobile device 100 by providing for information or software downloads to mobile device 100 other than through a wireless communication network. The alternate download path may, for example, be used to load an encryption key onto mobile device 100 through a direct and thus reliable and trusted connection to provide secure device communication.<br>
[0021]	Short-range communications subsystem 122 provides for<br>
communication between mobile device 100 and different systems or devices, without the use of network 200. For example, subsystem 122 may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components for short-range communication. Examples of short range communication would include standards developed by the Infrared Data Association (IrDA), Bluetooth, and the 802.11 family of standards developed by IEEE.<br>
[0022]	In use, a received signal such as a text message, an e-mail<br>
message, or web page download will be processed by communication subsystem<br>
104 and input to microprocessor 102. Microprocessor 102 will then process the<br>
received signal for output to display 110 or alternatively to auxiliary I/O subsystem<br>
112. A subscriber may also compose data items, such as e-mail messages, for<br>
example, using keyboard 116 in conjunction with display 110 and possibly<br>
auxiliary I/O subsystem 112. Auxiliary subsystem 112 may include devices such<br>
as: a touch screen, mouse, track ball, infrared fingerprint detector, or a roller<br>
wheel with dynamic button pressing capability. Keyboard 116 is an alphanumeric<br>
keyboard and/or telephone-type keypad. A composed item may be transmitted<br>
over network 200 through communication subsystem 104.<br>
[0023]	For voice communications, the overall operation of mobile device<br>
100 is substantially similar, except that the received signals would be output to<br>
 <br>
speaker 118, and signals for transmission would be generated by microphone 120. Alternative voice or audio I/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on mobile device 100. Although voice or audio signal output is accomplished primarily through speaker 118, display 110 may also be used to provide additional information such as the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.<br>
[0024]	Referring now to FIG. 2, a block diagram of the communication<br>
subsystem component 104 of FIG. 1 is shown. Communication subsystem 104<br>
comprises a receiver 150, a transmitter 152, one or more embedded or internal<br>
antenna elements 154, 156, Local Oscillators (LOs) 158, and a processing<br>
module such as a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) 160.<br>
[0025]	The particular design of communication subsystem 104 is<br>
dependent upon the network 200 in which mobile device 100 is intended to operate, thus it should be understood that the design illustrated in FIG, 2 serves only as one example. Signals received by antenna 154 through network 200 are input to receiver 150, which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, and analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion. A/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in DSP 160. In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, by DSP 160. These DSP-processed signals are input to transmitter 152 for digital-to-analog (D/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification and transmission over network 200 via antenna 156. DSP 160 not only processes communication signals, but also provides for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in receiver 150 and transmitter 152 may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in DSP 160.<br>
[0026]	The wireless link between mobile device 100 and a network 200<br>
may contain one or more different channels, typically different RF channels, and associated protocols used between mobile device 100 and network 200. A RF<br>
 <br>
channel is a limited resource that must be conserved, typically due to limits in<br>
overall bandwidth and limited battery power of mobile device 100,<br>
[0027]	When mobile device 100 is fully operational, transmitter 152 is<br>
typically keyed or turned on only when it is sending to network 200 and is otherwise turned off to conserve resources. Similarly, receiver 150 is periodically turned off to conserve power until it is needed to receive signals or information (if at all) during designated time periods.<br>
[0028]	Referring now to FIG. 3, a block diagram of a node of a wireless<br>
network is shown as 202. In practice, network 200 comprises one or more nodes 202. Mobile device 100 communicates with a node 202 within wireless network 200. In the example implementation of FIG. 3, node 202 is configured in accordance with General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and Global Systems for Mobile (GSM) technologies. Node 202 includes a base station controller (BSC) 204 with an associated tower station 206, a Packet Control Unit (PCU) 208 added for GPRS support in GSM, a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) 210, a Home Location Register (HLR) 212, a Visitor Location Registry (VLR) 214, a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) 216, a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) 218, and a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 220. This list of components is not meant to be an exhaustive list of the components of every node 202 within a GSM/GPRS network, but rather a list of components that are commonly used in communications through network 200.<br>
[0029]	In a GSM network, MSC 210 is coupled to BSC 204 and to a<br>
landline network, such as a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) 222 to satisfy circuit switched requirements. The connection through PCU 208, SGSN 216 and GGSN 218 to the public or private network (Internet) 224 (also referred to herein generally as a shared network infrastructure) represents the data path for GPRS capable mobile devices. In a GSM network extended with GPRS capabilities, BSC 204 also contains a Packet Control Unit (PCU) 208 that connects to SGSN 216 to control segmentation, radio channel allocation and to satisfy packet switched requirements. To track mobile device location and availability for both circuit switched and packet switched management, HLR 212 is shared between MSC 210 and SGSN 216. Access to VLR 214 is controlled by MSC 210.<br>
 <br>
[0030]	Station 206 is a fixed transceiver station. Station 206 and BSC 204<br>
together form the fixed transceiver equipment. The fixed transceiver equipment<br>
provides wireless network coverage for a particular coverage area commonly<br>
referred to as a "cell". The fixed transceiver equipment transmits communication<br>
signals to and receives communication signals from mobile devices within its cell<br>
via station 206. The fixed transceiver equipment normally perfonns such<br>
functions as modulation and possibly encoding and/or encryption of signals to be<br>
transmitted to the mobile device in accordance with particular, usually<br>
predetermined, communication protocols and parameters, under control of its<br>
controller. The fixed transceiver equipment similarly demodulates and possibly<br>
decodes and decrypts, if necessary, any communication signals received from<br>
mobile device 100 within its cell. Communication protocols and parameters may<br>
vary between different nodes. For example, one node may employ a different<br>
modulation scheme and operate at different frequencies than other nodes.<br>
[0d31]	For all mobile devices 100 registered with a specific network,<br>
permanent configuration data such as a user profile is stored in HLR 212. HLR<br>
212 also contains location information for each registered mobile device and can<br>
be queried to determine the current location of a mobile device. MSC 210 is<br>
responsible for a group of location areas and stores the data of the mobile devices<br>
currently in its area of responsibility in VLR 214. Further VLR 214 also contains<br>
information on mobile devices that are visiting other networks. The information in<br>
VLR 214 includes part of the permanent mobile device data transmitted from HLR -<br>
212 to VLR 214 for faster access. By moving additional information from a remote<br>
HLR 212 node to VLR 214, the amount of traffic between these nodes can be<br>
reduced so that voice and data services can be provided with faster response<br>
times and at the same time requiring less use of computing resources.<br>
[0032]	SGSN 216 and GGSN 218 are elements added for GPRS support;<br>
namely packet switched data support, within GSM. SGSN 216 and MSC 210 have similar responsibilities within wireless network 200 by keeping track of the location of each mobile device 100. SGSN 216 also performs security functions and access control for data traffic on network 200. GGSN 218 provides internetworking connections with external packet switched networks and connects to one or more SGSNs 216 via an Internet Protocol (IP) backbone network<br>
 <br>
operated within the network 200. During normal operations, a given mobile device 100 must perform a "GPRS Attach" to acquire an IP address and to access data services. This requirement is not present in circuit switched voice channels as Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) addresses are used for routing incoming and outgoing calls. Currently, all GPRS capable networks use private, dynamically assigned IP addresses, thus requiring a DHCP server 220 connected to the GGSN 218. There are many mechanisms for dynamic IP assignment, including using a combination of a Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server and DHCP server. Once the GPRS Attach is complete, a logical connection is established from a mobile device 100, through PCU 208, and SGSN 216 to an Access Point Node (APN) within GGSN 218, The APN represents a logical end of an IP tunnel that can either access direct Internet compatible services or private network connections. The APN also represents a security mechanism for network 200, insofar as each mobile device 100 must be assigned to one or more APNs and mobile devices 100 cannot exchange data without first performing a GPRS Attach to an APN that it has been authorized to use. The APN may be considered to be similar to an Internet domain name such as "myconnection.wireless.com".<br>
[0033]	Once the GPRS Attach is complete, a tunnel Is created and all traffic<br>
is exchanged within standard IP packets using any protocol that can be supported<br>
in IP packets. This includes tunneling methods such as IP over IP as in the case<br>
with some IPSecurity (IPsec) connections used with Virtual Private Networks<br>
(VPN). These tunnels are also referred to as Packet Data Protocol (POP)<br>
Contexts and there are a limited number of these available in the network 200. To<br>
maximize use of the PDP Contexts, network 200 will run an idle timer for each<br>
PDP Context to determine if there is a lack of activity. When a mobile device 100<br>
is not using its PDP Context, the PDP Context can be de-allocated and the IP<br>
address returned to the IP address pool managed by DHCP server 220.<br>
[0034]	Referring now to FIG. 4, a block diagram illustrating further aspects<br>
of mobile device 100 of FIG. 1 is shown generally as 300. As noted earlier with reference to FIG. 1, microprocessor 102, in addition to its operating system functions, enables execution of software applications on mobile device 100. A set of applications that control basic device operations, including data and voice<br>
 <br>
communication applications, will normally be installed on mobile device 100 during its manufacture. Operating system software and other software applications are typically stored in a persistent store (e.g. flash memory 106) or other store, on mobile device 100 or on a device coupled thereto. It will be understood that the operating system, software applications or parts thereof, may be temporarily loaded in a volatile store such as RAM 106. Other instructions and/or data received by the mobile device 100 and subject to processing may also. be temporarily stored in RAM 106.<br>
[0035]	Software applications that are loaded or stored on mobile device<br>
100 may be implemented as functional components or modules 310. Modules<br>
310 interact with various components of mobile device 100.   For instance, as<br>
shown byway of example in FIG. 4, modules 310 may interact with<br>
communication subsystem 104, RAM 106, flash memory 108, display 110,<br>
auxiliary I/O device(s) 112, and keyboard 116. Modules 310 may comprise, for<br>
example, an address book module 312, a messaging module 314 (e.g. for e-mail<br>
and/or SMS or MMS messaging), and a phone application module 316.<br>
[0036]	Address book module 312 is generally configured to allow contact<br>
information (e.g. individual contact and company names, telephone numbers,<br>
messaging addresses, and other information) to be stored and managed.<br>
Messaging module 314 facilitates the sending and receiving of electronic<br>
messages over a wireless network 200 and/or other network.<br>
[0037]	Phone application module 316 is generally configured to facilitate<br>
voice communication between the user and other parties, including the placement of outgoing calls by the user and the reception of incoming calls on the mobile device 100.<br>
[0038]	Calls may be placed and received on a communication line<br>
specifically configured for voice communications. In certain embodiments, calls may alternatively or additionally be placed and received on other types of communication lines, including a communication line generally configured for data communications, or a communication line configured for both voice and data communications, for example. For example, mobile device 100 may be configured to provide Voice over IP (VoIP), Enterprise Voice, and/or video phone functionality.<br>
 <br>
[0039]	Embodiments described herein are generally applicable to mobile<br>
devices that provide access to multiple (i.e. two or more) communication lines on<br>
which outgoing calls may be placed, as initiated by a mobile device user.<br>
Typically, these mobile devices will also be configured to allow incoming calls to<br>
be received by the user over the same communication lines.<br>
[0040]	In example embodiments, each of the multiple communication lines<br>
has a different telephone number associated therewith. For example, a user may have a business phone number and a different personal phone number. When a user places an outgoing call on a specific communication line, the phone number associated with that communication line may be identified on a receiving party's phone that is equipped with "call display" functionality.<br>
[0041]	Referring again to FIG. 4, a line selection module (e.g. alternate line<br>
service (ALS) module) 318 is provided to facilitate selection of the communication line to be used by phone application module 316 for placing an outgoing call, for example. The line selection module 318 is configured to select a communication line to be used by phone application module 316, based upon line selection data stored on mobile device 100 (e.g. configuration settings that define a default communication line), and/or based upon input received by the user. It will be understood that the functionality of line selection module 318 may be provided or otherwise integrated with phone application module 316 or with a different module on mobile device 100.<br>
[0042]	The currently selected communication line on which an outgoing call<br>
may be placed at any given time is also referred to herein as the "active" line. Outgoing calls will be placed on the active line by phone application module 316 until an alternate communication line is selected.<br>
[0043]	When a user wishes to initiate an outgoing call, the user will typically<br>
be required to access a call screen provided by an application (e.g. phone application module 316) on mobile device 100. Data identifying the active line will be displayed to the user in a first display field (e.g. "My Number" field, or phone status field) of the call screen, allowing the user to quickly identify the communication line on which an outgoing call will be placed should the user choose to initiate such call. This display field may also be referred to as an active line data display field. The data identifying the active line typically comprises a<br>
 <br>
telephone number, but may alternatively or additionally comprise some other communication line identifier(s), such as a line descriptor, alias and/or other identifier, for example.<br>
[0044]	Should the user wish to initiate an outgoing call to be placed on an<br>
alternate communication line, the user may need to change the current active line using a different application or in a separate screen, and then return to the call screen to place the call on the alternate communication line after the change is made,<br>
[0045]	Embodiments described herein are generally directed to a system<br>
and method for providing a user interface on a mobile device that allows users to<br>
change the active line on which an outgoing call may be placed.<br>
[0046]	In example embodiments, a direction to display a line selection<br>
menu on the call screen is received from the user, where the line selection menu is comprised of data identifying one or more of the multiple communication lines that accessible at the mobile device. For example, for each communication line on which the user may place an outgoing call, the telephone number associated with the respective communication line may be displayed in the line selection menu. As a further example, one or more line descriptors, aliases and/or other identifiers may be displayed, in addition to or instead of the telephone number. In response to a direction received from the user, the line selection menu is displayed on the call screen, and an input identifying a user-selected communication line is received. A display field in which data identifying the active line is displayed is updated accordingly.<br>
[0047]	In one embodiment, the direction to display a line selection menu on '<br>
the call screen is received from the user when the user moves a selection element<br>
(e.g. a highlight bar, pointer, cursor, or other means to identify and select menu or<br>
list items) displayed on the call screen to a position within the first display field<br>
(e.g. "My Number" field or phone status field) in which data identifying the active<br>
line (e.g. the telephone number associated with the active line) is displayed.<br>
While the selection element is settled in this first display field, a direction to<br>
display the line selection menu can be provided by the user.<br>
[0048]	In one embodiment, the direction to display the line selection menu<br>
may be provided by the user by depressing a navigation tool such as a mouse<br>
 <br>
button, track ball, track wheel, or a pre-programmed key, for example. Upon<br>
providing this direction, the line selection menu is displayed on the call screen.<br>
[0049]	In a variant embodiment, an intermediate options menu is to be<br>
navigated by the user prior to the display of the line selection menu. For example, the direction to display the line selection menu may be similarly provided by the user (e.g, by depressing a navigation tool such as a mouse button, track ball, track wheel, or a pre-programmed key); however, upon providing this direction, an options menu is first displayed, where the options menu provides an option to display the line selection menu to the user. Only after this option to display the line selection menu is selected from the options menu by the user will the line selection menu be displayed on the call screen.<br>
[0050]	In a variant embodiment, the user may direct the options menu to be<br>
displayed without first moving a selection element displayed on the call screen to a position within the first display field (e.g. by pressing an options or menu key). However, it may be more intuitive for the user to direct that the options menu be displayed after the selection element is moved to a position within the first display field.<br>
[0051]	In a variant embodiment, if one pre-determined input is provided by<br>
the user while the selection element is settled in the display field (e.g. depressing<br>
a track ball or track wheel), the line selection menu may be displayed without<br>
requiring an options menu to be navigated; whereas if a different pre-determined<br>
input is provided by the user (e.g. pressing an options or menu key), an options<br>
menu is provided, where the line selection menu may be displayed only after the<br>
corresponding option is selected from the options menu.<br>
[0052]	In one embodiment, after a line selection menu is displayed on the<br>
call screen, an input identifying a user-selected communication line is received from the user. This input is generated when the selection element displayed on the call screen is moved by the user to highlight data identifying the desired communication line (e.g. by highlighting a telephone number associated with the desired communication line shown as a menu item in the line selection menu), and the communication line is selected by the user by depressing a navigation tool such as a mouse button, track ball, track wheel, or a pre-programmed key, for example.<br>
 <br>
[0053]	In one embodiment, data associated with outgoing calls previously<br>
made on the mobile device and/or with received calls (e.g. a call log) may be<br>
displayed to the user in a second display field of the call screen.<br>
[0054]	In a variant embodiment, only the data for calls made and/or<br>
received on the communication line that is identified by the data currently displayed in the first display field (i.e. on the communication line currently identified as the active line) would be displayed in the second display field at any given time.<br>
[0055]	In one embodiment, data that is displayed in the first display field<br>
may comprise one or more line-specific calling feature icons, which provide<br>
information associated with the active line to users. For example, a calling feature<br>
icon may be displayed in association with the active line if an incoming call on the<br>
active line was unanswered by the user, if a voicemail message associated with<br>
the active line has been stored, if a "call forwarding" feature and/or other calling<br>
feature has been activated or enabled for the active line, and/or other status<br>
indicator associated with the active line. While a calling feature icon may be<br>
displayed to Indicate that a particular feature has been activated or enabled for<br>
the active line, a calling feature icon may also be displayed to indicate that a<br>
particular calling feature has been disabled for the active line.<br>
[0056]	Similarly, in one embodiment, with respect to each communication<br>
line (typically including the active line) for which data is displayed in a line selection menu, the data for each communication line may comprise one or more line-specific calling feature icons as noted above, which provide information associated with the respective line to users.<br>
[0057]	In one embodiment, in addition to employing line-specific calling<br>
feature icons, one or more general calling feature icons (or "ribbon indicators") are<br>
displayable In a display field for such icons. This display field may be referred to<br>
as a general calling feature icon display field. The placement of this display field<br>
within the user interface can vary depending on the implementation. For example,<br>
the general calling feature icons may be displayed in its own header or ribbon,<br>
above where the data identifying the active line is displayed.<br>
[0058]	The general calling feature icons are not intended to identify the<br>
specific communication lines for which certain calling features are enabled (or<br>
 <br>
disabled), for example. The general calling feature icons (e.g. a general voicemail<br>
icon, a general call forwarding icon) indicate that the status of a particular calling<br>
feature applies to at least one of the multiple communication lines accessible at<br>
the mobile device. The user can rely instead on information provided by the line-<br>
specific calling feature icons (e.g. as shown in the display field where data<br>
identifying the active line is displayed, or in entries of the line selection menu) to<br>
determine the status of a particular calling feature for a given communication line.<br>
[0059]	Referring now to FIG. 5, a flowchart illustrating steps of a method of<br>
providing a user interface that facilitates user selection of a communication line for an outgoing call on a mobile device in accordance with at least one embodiment is shown generally as 400. Additional details of some of the features described below in respect of the steps of method 400 may be described earlier in the present specification.<br>
[0060]	In one embodiment, the steps of method 400 are performed at the<br>
mobile device by an application (e.g. phone application module 316 of FIG. 4) that executes and resides on the mobile device (e.g. mobile device 100 of FIG. 1). The application need not be a stand-alone application, and the functionality described herein may be implemented in one or more applications executing and residing on the mobile device.<br>
[0061]	At step 410, a call screen is displayed to the user on a display (e.g.<br>
display 110 of FIG. 1) of the mobile device. A user may access the call screen when the user wishes to initiate an outgoing call. This may require first activating a phone application or other application on the mobile device, by selecting a corresponding item or icon from a menu or home screen, for example (not shown).<br>
[0062]	The mobile device provides access to multiple communication lines<br>
on which outgoing calls may be placed.<br>
[0063]	At step 420, data identifying a first of the multiple communication<br>
lines accessible at the mobile device is displayed in a first display field ("active line data display field") of the call screen. The first display field may be referred to as a "My Number" field or a "phone status" field, and data displayed therein identifies the active line, allowing the user to quickly identify the line on which an outgoing call will be placed should the user choose to initiate one such call.<br>
 <br>
[0064]	The data identifying the active line typically comprises a telephone<br>
number associated with the active line, but may alternatively or additionally comprise some other communication line identifier(s), such as. for example, one or more aliases, identifiers and/or other descriptors (e.g. "My Business Line", "My Personal Line"), which may be user-defined.<br>
[0065]	In one embodiment, one or more line-specific calling feature icons<br>
associated with the active line may also be displayed in the first display field of the call screen. Similarly, one or more general calling feature icons are optionally displayed in a display field of the call screen.<br>
[0066]	Subsequently, an input comprising a direction to display a line<br>
selection menu on the call screen is received from the user.<br>
[0067]	In one embodiment, the step of receiving the input comprising a<br>
direction to display a line selection menu on the call screen comprises: detecting<br>
when a selection element (e.g. a highlight bar, pointer, cursor, or other means to<br>
identify and select menu or list items) displayed on the call screen has been<br>
moved into the first display field as shown at 430, and subsequently detecting<br>
when the user provides the direction to display the line selection menu while the<br>
selection element is settled in the first display field as shown at 440.<br>
[0068]	The selection element may be re-positioned at the direction of the<br>
user, using an input device such as a track wheel, track ball, keyboard, mouse, or<br>
other input device. For example, the user may use a track wheel or track ball on<br>
the mobile device, where provided, to manipulate a highlight bar shown in the<br>
display. In particular, by rotating the track wheel or track ball in this example, the<br>
highlight bar may be re-positioned to highlight the data displayed in the first<br>
display field (e.g. the telephone number associated with the active line) of the call<br>
screen. Once data identifying the active line is highlighted, by manipulating the<br>
track wheel or track ball so that the highlight bar settles in the first display field,<br>
the user may then take further action. For example, the user may depress the<br>
track wheel or track ball to direct that the line selection menu be displayed.<br>
[0069]	In a variant embodiment, the step of receiving the input comprising a<br>
direction to display a line selection menu on the call screen comprises: optionally detecting when the selection element (e.g. a highlight bar, pointer, cursor, or other means to identify and select menu or list items) displayed on the call screen has<br>
 <br>
been moved into the first display field as shown at 430, subsequently detecting when the user provides a direction to display an options menu while the selection element is settled in the first display field as shown at 432, and displaying the options menu as shown at 434. The options menu provides the user with an option to display the line selection menu, and the flow of method steps proceeds to step 440, to detect when the user provides the direction to display the line selection menu by selecting the corresponding option,<br>
[0070]	In some embodiments, the user may be able to provide the direction<br>
to display the line selection menu through the display options menu; in other embodiments, the options menu is not provided to the user (in which case, steps 432 and 434 would not be performed). In other embodiments, the user may be able to provide the direction to display the line selection menu with or without the benefit of the options menu as determined by the specific input provided by the user.<br>
[0071]	At step 450, the line selection menu is displayed to the user in<br>
response to the input comprising a direction to display a line selection menu on the call screen received from the user, as detected at step 440. The line selection menu comprises data identifying at least a subset of the multiple communication lines accessible at the mobile device. For example, the line selection menu identifies all the communication lines on which the user may make an outgoing call.<br>
[0072]	In one embodiment, data identifying the currently active line appears<br>
first in the line selection menu.<br>
[0073]	In one embodiment, the line selection menu overlaps the fi'^st display<br>
field, such that data in the first display field is not visible to the user when the line selection menu is displayed.<br>
[0074]	It may be the case that the mobile device provides access to<br>
multiple communication lines, but not all are activated for use, the use of certain lines has been restricted in some manner (e.g. as configured by a security policy), or certain lines are otherwise unavailable, for example. In one embodiment, the line selection menu comprises data identifying only the communication lines that have been activated and on which the user is permitted to place an outgoing call.<br>
 <br>
[0075]	The data for any given communication line represented In the line<br>
selection menu typically comprises a telephone number, but may alternatively or additionally comprise some other communication line identjfier(s), such as, for example, one or more aliases, identifiers and/or other descriptors (e.g. "My Business Line", "My Personal Line"), which may be user-defined. One or more Hne-specific calling feature icons associated with the respective communication line may also be displayed in association with the corresponding menu item in the line selection menu,<br>
[0076]	A selection element (e.g. a highlight bar, pointer, cursor, or other<br>
means to identify and select menu or list items) is displayed within the line selection menu and may be re-positioned at the direction of the user, using an input device such as a track wheel, track ball, keyboard, mouse, or other input device. For example, the user may use a track wheel or track ball on mobile device, where provided, to manipulate a highlight bar shown in the display. In particular, by rotating the track wheel or track ball in this example, the highlight bar may be re-positioned to highlight the data associated with a particular communication line (e.g, the telephone number associated with one of the subset of the multiple communication lines) displayed in the line selection menu. Once the user highlights a desired communication line, by manipulating the track wheel or track ball so that the highlight bar settles on the associated data, the user may then take further action. For example, the user may depress the track wheel or track ball to select the desired communication line.<br>
[0077]	Accordingly, at step 460, an input identifying a user-selected second<br>
communication line from the communication lines for which associated data is<br>
displayed in the line selection menu at step 450, is received from the user.<br>
[0078]	At step 470, the first display field is updated with data identifying the<br>
user-selected communication line. Accordingly, the user-selected communication line is identified to the user as the current active line. For example, the "My Number" field or phone status field may be updated with the telephone number of the user-selected communication line in one embodiment. Where provided, line-specific calling feature icons associated with the active line are also updated at this step, wherein for each calling feature, a line-specific calling feature icon is<br>
 <br>
only displayed in the first display field if the respective calling feature applies to the user-selected communication line.<br>
[0079]	In one embodiment, data associated with outgoing calls previously<br>
made on the mobile device and/or with received calls (e.g. a call log) may be displayed to the user in a second display field of the call screen. In a variant embodiment, data in the second display field is also updated when data in the first display field is updated, so that data associated for calls made and/or received on the communication line now identified by the data currently displayed in the first display field (i.e. the "new" active line) would be displayed to the user (step not shown).<br>
[0080]	At step 480, an outgoing call is initiated on the user-selected<br>
communication line, identified from the line selection menu at step 460, as directed by the user. The outgoing call is initiated from the call screen in known manner.<br>
[0081]	Referring now to FIGS. 6A to 6D, screenshots of a user interface<br>
provided to a user in one example implementation of an embodiment of the method of FIG. 5 are shown.<br>
[0082]	In FIG. 6A, screenshot 500a illustrates a user interface displayed in<br>
a display 110 of a mobile device 100 (shown in FIG. 1), namely for a call screen from which the user can place outgoing calls. Call screen 500a is displayed to the user, awaiting user input (e.g. a number to be dialed). A number entry field 502 is provided, and cursor 504 is settled within number entry field 502, indicating that the user may provide a call number (e.g. using a keyboard or keypad). General indicators may be displayed on call screen 500a, including for example, time 506, date 508, network indicator 510, signal strength 512, battery strength 514, charging indicator 516, alarm indicator 518, service provider indicator 520, ringer indicator 522, and/or Bluetooth™ indicator 524.<br>
[0083]	An active line data display field 530 is also provided, which contains<br>
data identifying the active line. This data may include a line descriptor 532 (e.g. "Personal:", "Business:"), an associated telephone number 534, and/or possibly one or more line-specific calling feature icons. In this presently described example embodiment, a voicemail icon 536 is shown indicating that a voicemail message associated with an incoming call received on the active line is awaiting<br>
 <br>
consideration by the user. Further, in this example embodiment, a call forwarding icon 538 is shown indicating that a "call forwarding" feature has been activated for the active line.<br>
[0084]	One or more general calling feature icons are also provided in<br>
general calling feature icon display field 540 of call screen 500a. The icons shown in display field 540 indicate, for example, which line-specific calling features have been activated for at least one communication line provided by the mobile device 100. In this manner, if certain line-specific calling feature icons are not displayed in display field 530 with respect to the active line but the corresponding general calling feature icon is displayed in display field 540, the user will know that certain calling features have been activated for a communication line other than the active line.<br>
[0085]	In this example embodiment, call screen 500a also provides a call<br>
log field 550 in which data associated with previously placed outgoing calls and received calls (e.g. including answered and missed calls) is displayed. For each such call, the associated date 552 of the call, an icon 554 indicating the nature of the call (e.g. outgoing, answered, missed), and call information (e.g. telephone number and/or contact name 556, line descriptor 558) is provided. In this particular example, call information for calls previously placed or received using the mobile device 100 is shown, which does not depend on the currently active line for which data is displayed in display field 530. However, this may differ in variant embodiments.<br>
[0086]	In FIG. 6B, screenshot 500b illustrates similar elements as shown in<br>
FIG. 6B, except that cursor 504 has been re-positioned by the user (e.g. by using a track wheel or track ball of the mobile device), to highlight the data associated with the active line as displayed in display field 530. Cursor 504 is now shown as a highlight bar 560 settled in display field 530.<br>
[0087]	In FIG. 6C, screenshot 500c illustrates similar elements as shown in<br>
FIG. 6B, except that the user has directed that a line selection menu 570 be<br>
displayed (e.g. by depressing the track wheel or track ball of the mobile device).<br>
[0088]	Highlight bar 560 is shown initially highlighting data associated with<br>
the current active line 572 provided in line selection menu 570. Line selection menu 570 also comprises further items (where the user can access one or more<br>
 <br>
alternate lines on which an outgoing call may be placed) that provide data associated with an alternate communication line 574. For each item of line selection menu 570, where each item is associated with a different communication line, the data may similarly include a line descriptor (e.g. "Personal:", "Business:"), an associated telephone number, and/or possibly one or more line-specific calling feature icons. In the example shown in FIG. 6C, the "Business" line does not have "call forwarding" activated, nor is a voicerriail waiting for the user in respect of that communication line.<br>
[0089]	The user may move the highlight bar 560 to select a different item in<br>
line selection menu 570, thereby selecting a different communication line as the<br>
active line. More specifically, the user highlights the data associated with the<br>
alternate communication line 574 (e.g. using the track wheel or track ball) and<br>
selects the alternate communication line (e.g. by depressing the track wheel or<br>
track ball). When the alternate communication line has been selected by the user,<br>
the data associated with the active line as shown in display field 530 is updated to<br>
reflect the selection, as shown in screenshot 500d of FIG. 6D. Cursor 504 is<br>
settled within number entry field 502, indicating that the user may then provide a<br>
call number. Outgoing calls will be placed on the communication line identified by<br>
the data shown in display field 530 (unless the active line is changed again).<br>
Accordingly, selection of the desired communication line identified at 572 or 574<br>
to initiate an outgoing call is performed in the same call screen without requiring<br>
the user to select the communication line identified at 572 or 574 in one screen<br>
and to subsequently initiate the outgoing call in a separate call screen.<br>
[0090]	Referring now to FIGS. 7A to 7E, screenshots of a user interface<br>
provided to a user in an example implementation of another embodiment of the method of FIG. 5 are shown.<br>
[0091]	In this example, FIGS, 7A, 7B, 7D, and 7E correspond to FIGS. 6A,<br>
6B, 6C, and 6D respectively. Features of the screenshots shown in FIGS. 7A, 7B, 7D, and 7E have been generally described in preceding paragraphs with reference to the corresponding figure of FIGS. 6A to 6D.<br>
[0092]	In this embodiment, the user may direct that the line selection menu<br>
570 (shown in FIG. 7D) be displayed through an options menu 562 as shown in screenshot 500e of FIG. 7C (which would appear after screenshot 500b and<br>
 <br>
before screenshot 500c in a typical sequence of operations). For example, the<br>
user may have directed that a line selection menu 570 (shown in FIG. 7D) be<br>
optionally displayed via the options menu 562 by depressing a pre-programmed<br>
menu or options key on the mobile device (e.g, or by depressing the track wheel<br>
or track ball of the mobile device depending upon the configuration).<br>
[0093]	Options menu 562 provides an option to display the line selection<br>
menu 570, shown in this example as a "Change Line" option 564 in FIG. 7C.<br>
Other options (e.g. to request help, call voice mail using the currently identified<br>
active line, edit communication line information, switch to a different application,<br>
and/or close the options menu 562) may also be provided in options menu 562,<br>
The user can navigate the options menu 562 by moving a highlight bar or other<br>
cursor for example, to select the desired option in known manner (e:g. by<br>
depressing the track wheel or track ball of the mobile device so as to make a<br>
selection).<br>
[0094]	In this example, upon selection of option 564 from options menu<br>
562, the line selection menu 570 is displayed, as shown in FIG. 7D.<br>
