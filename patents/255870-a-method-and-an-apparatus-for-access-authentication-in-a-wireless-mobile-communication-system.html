				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ACCESS AUTHENTICATION<br>
IN WIRELESS MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method and Apparatus for Access<br>
Network Authentication, Authorization and Accounting server (hereinafter<br>
referred to as AN-AAA)in a High Rate Packet Data (hereinafter referred to<br>
as HRPD) network, especially to the AN-AAA method of HRPD network<br>
that simultaneously supports the CAVE and MD5 algorithms.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Code Division Multiple Access 2000 (hereinafter referred to as cdma2000)<br>
network has been widely applied commercially all over the world. In this<br>
kind of network, a Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol<br>
(hereinafter referred to as CHAP) based on the Cellular Authentication and<br>
Voice Encryption (hereinafter referred to as CAVE) algorithm has been<br>
adopted to identify the legitimacy of the access terminals. This<br>
authentication system has relatively perfect methods on illegal<br>
attack-protecting. A Mobile Station's (hereinafter referred to as MS) privacy<br>
key (A-key) and the CAVE algorithm are stored . in this MS and the<br>
cdma2000 network's authentication center respectively. The authentication<br>
process mainly includes such two procedures as the update of Shared Secret<br>
Data (SSD) and the implementation of authentication. Part A of the Shared<br>
Secret Data (SSD_A) is used for access authentication. According to<br>
specific conditions, the network sends a message including a segment of<br>
random numbers to the MS and the authentication center respectively to<br>
update the SSD_A data. After this message is received by the MS and the<br>
authentication center respectively, the included random numbers, the A-key<br>
and other parameters are together input into the "SSDGENEREATION<br>
PROCEDURE" to generate an SSD_A through calculation. After<br>
conforming the correctness, the old SSD_A is replaced with the new one<br>
which will be used as the key for the access authentication. When an<br><br>
authentication is needed to be done on a terminal terminal, the network<br>
sends an authentication request message to the MS and the authentication<br>
center, including a segment of random numbers. After this message is<br>
received by the MS and the authentication center respectively, the<br>
authentication result will be calculated with the random numbers included<br>
in this message, the SSD_A and other parameters according to the CAVE<br>
algorithm. The MS sends authentication results to the authentication center.<br>
By comparing the differences between the authentication results, the MS<br>
can be authenticated to be valid . To prevent any vicious terminal from<br>
stealing others' keys, the SSD_A (which is used as the temporary privacy<br>
key) can be updated frequently. Therefore, this authentication mode has<br>
very high level of security. In practice, the A-key can be stored in two<br>
modes. One is that it is stored in the MS, and the corresponding CAVE<br>
algorithm is also implemented in the MS which the card can not be<br>
separated from the MS. The other is that the A-key is stored in the<br>
Removable User Identification Module (hereinafter referred to as the<br>
R-UIM card), and the corresponding CAVE algorithm is also implemented<br>
in the R-UIM card which the card is separatable from the MS. At present,<br>
only the MSs that the card is separatable from the MS are in service in<br>
China, while the MSs that the card can not be separated from the MS are in<br>
service in most foreign countries. The HRPD network is the upgrade of<br>
cdma2000 network and has been gradually adopted in commercial<br>
application all over the world. The HRPD network's access authentication<br>
server is called AN-AAA. As prescribed in the corresponding standard of<br>
the 3G Partnership Project 2 (hereinafter referred to as 3GPP2), if the access<br>
authentication is adopted by the HRPD network, the authentication mode<br>
should also be the CHAP authentication, but no detailed encryption<br>
algorithm is specified explicitly, which can be specified by the concrete<br>
operator. As the cdma2000 network, according to the location where the<br>
privacy key is stored, HRPD's access terminals (referred to as AT) can be<br>
divided into such two kinds as the one that the card is separatable from the<br>
AT and the one that the card can not be separated from the AT.<br>
The HRPD network and the cdma2000 network are independent of each<br>
other. The structure of cdma2000 network is illustrated in figure 6 in which<br>
the information is transferred by terminals. Terminals(610) are linked with<br>
base stations(620) via over -the-air interface. The base stations(620) and<br><br>
base station controllers(630) constitute a radio access network for the<br>
conversion and process of the terminal's signalling and data. A mobile<br>
switch center(640) is responsible for user data and service exchange and is<br>
linked with the radio access network via interface A. A visitor location<br>
register(640) is used for the management of user's location information and<br>
implements the function of local authentication. In practice, it is often set<br>
cooperatively with the mobile switch center. A home location register(650)<br>
is responsible for saving user's permanent information and resolving the<br>
problem of user roaming. The authentication centre(650) is responsible for<br>
authentication tasks. In general, local authentication is implemented by the<br>
visitor location register(640). In practice, the home location register(650) is<br>
often set cooperatively with the authentication centre(650). The visitor<br>
location register is linked with the home location register via the interface D<br>
under the mobile application protocol ANSI-41.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates the structure of the HRPD network in which the<br>
information is transferred by terminals(710). The access network(720)<br>
offers the function of radio access for users. It is used for the conversion<br>
and process of terminal's signalling and data. Terminals(710) are linked<br>
with the access network(720) via the over-the-air interface, and the<br>
AN-AAA{730) is used for the tasks of authentication, authorization and<br>
accounting.<br>
In practice, no information exchanges between the cdma2000 network and<br>
the HRPD network except that they share the same packet data core<br>
network. Because the HRPD network mainly provides terminals with data<br>
service, the terminals can share the services through the dual-mode<br>
terminals that simultaneously support cdma2000 network and the HRPD<br>
network, and this category of terminal is the main cluster of terminals of the<br>
HRPD network. In the context, except specifically pointed out, the<br>
dual-mode terminals refer to the cdma2000/HRPD ones.<br>
In order to better illustrating the present invention, figure 2, figure 3 and<br>
figure 4 are used to describe the operation process in the MS side during the<br>
cdma2000 network's authentication process, and figure 5 is used to describe<br>
the message stream which is defined in 3GPP2 when the access<br>
authentication is carried out in the HRPD network.<br>
1) The process in the MS side during the existing cdma2000 network's<br>
authentication process.<br><br>
The operation process in the MS side during the existing cdma2000<br>
network's authentication process consists of two processes: SSD_A update<br>
procedure and the authentication procedure.<br>
The SSD_A update process is used for improving the authentication<br>
system's capability of attack-protecting. The basic operation process is<br>
illustrated in figure 2:<br>
a HLR/AC in the system sends a Shared Secrete Data Update Message<br>
to a mobile terminal, including RANDSSD which is a 56-bit long random<br>
number in step 201;<br>
after receiving the message mentioned above, the mobile terminal<br>
initiates a SSD_A generation process. The A-key and the random number<br>
above are input into this process to generate a new shared secret data (SSD),<br>
which contains part A and part B in step 202;<br>
The same operation is performed in the system side in step 203;<br>
The correctness of the operations performed above must be verified for<br>
the mobile terminal and the system. For this end, the mobile terminal<br>
generates a segment of random number and sends it to the system<br>
simultaneously in step 206. In the terminal side, both this segment of<br>
random number and the new SSD_A are input into the authentication<br>
signature program to generate a result in the terminal side in step 204;<br>
In the system side, the same authentication signature program is<br>
performed to obtain a result of the base station side and the system sends<br>
the result of the base station to the terminal in step 205; and<br>
The terminal compares the result from the Base Station with the result<br>
calculated by itself. If they are just the same, the SSD_A update process<br>
completes successfully, and the terminal and the system adopts the new<br>
SSD simultaneously, otherwise, the original SSD should be still in service<br>
in step 206.<br>
During the process above, the A-key is 64-bit long, which is allocated to<br>
an MS by the operator. Only the corresponding MS and the network<br>
authentication centre (AuC) know the corresponding A-key. In a practical<br>
network, the AuC cooperates with the Home Location Register (i.e., HLR)<br>
as the HLR/AuC.<br>
The process of generating the SSD is illustrated in figure 3. The<br>
parameters including the 56-bit long random number RANDSSD(310), the<br>
32-bit long electronic serial number (in the case of using R-UIM card,<br><br>
which can be the R-UIM ID)(320), and the 64-bit long terminal's password<br>
A-key(330) are input into the SSD generation procedure(360). The SSD<br>
generation procedure is carried out to generate the part A(340) and part<br>
B(350) of the new 64-bit long SSD.<br>
The authentication process is the process of a terminal's legitimacy<br>
verification whose basic operations are illustrated in figure 4.<br>
The AuC sends a Challenge message to the MS, including a 32-bit long<br>
random number RAND in step 410. The MS takes the RAND and the<br>
SSD_A as the inputs of the CAVE algorithm to calculate an 18-bit long<br>
result AUTH in step 430. Then the MS sends the AUTH to the<br>
authentication center by an Authentication Challenge Response message in<br>
step 440, and the AuC compares the AUTH with the result worked out by<br>
itself with the same method. If they are just the same, the authentication<br>
passes, otherwise, this MS is rejected to access the network in step 450.<br>
Because of the roaming problem, the SSD_A is generally shared<br>
between the HLR/AuC and the Visitor Location Register (hereinafter<br>
referred to as VLR) which is nearer the terminal to speed up the access<br>
authentication and reduce network transmission in network<br>
implementations. The connection between the VLR and the HLR/AuC is<br>
realized via the interface D in the Mobile Application Protocol (MAP)<br>
ANSI-41 prescribed by the American National Standards institute (ANSI),<br>
through which an ANSI-41 message is transmitted.<br>
(2) The message flows of the existing HRPD network's access<br>
authentication<br>
The HRPD network's access authentication includes following message<br>
flows, as shown in figure 5:<br>
The access network (AN) sends a CHAP Challenge message to the<br>
access terminal (AT), including the random number "Random text"in step<br>
501.<br>
The terminal receives the Chap Challenge message, and then calculates<br>
an authentication parameter 1 with the received random number. In the<br>
figure, the encryption algorithm MD5 is taken as an example to make<br>
further explanationsin step 502.<br>
The terminal sends a Chap Response message to the AN, including<br>
information of AT's Network Access ID (NAI), random number "text", the<br>
authentication parameter 1 and so on in step 503.<br><br>
After receiving the Chap Response message from the terminal, the AN<br>
sends a Radius Access Request message to the AN-AAA, including the<br>
three parameters included in the Chap Response message in step 504.<br>
The AN-AAA inputs the random text and the local Password (AN-AAA<br>
Password and the AT's Password are just the same) into the MD5 algorithm<br>
to calculate an authentication parameter 2 in step 505.<br>
The AN-AAA compares the authentication parameter 1 with the<br>
authentication parameter 2 in step 506.<br>
If they are just the same, it sends a Authentication Access Accept<br>
message to the AN, indicating that the authentication passes. In this<br>
message, the IMSI corresponding to the NAI of this AT is included, which<br>
is used for subsequent flows by the AN in step 507.<br>
If the authentication parameter 1 is not the same as the authentication<br>
parameter 2, the AN-AAA sends a Authentication Access Reject message to<br>
AN to reject the terminal in step 508.<br>
After receiving the Authentication Access Accept message, the AN<br>
sends a Chap Success message to the terminal, indicating that the<br>
authentication process succeeds in step 509.<br>
And after receiving the Authentication Access Rejeet message, the AN<br>
sends a Chap Failure message to the terminal, indicating that the<br>
authentication process fails in step 510.<br>
In the procedures mentioned above, the encryption algorithm MD5 is<br>
adopted by the terminal and the AN-AAA. No specification on the adoption<br>
of encryption algorithms is given in the international standards while it can<br>
be specified by the operator.<br>
In practice, the voice service is provided by means of the cdma2000<br>
network and the data service is provided by means of the HRPD network.<br>
Therefore, the dual-mode terminals that support not only the cdma2000<br>
network but also the HRPD network will take up a sizable share. Because<br>
the cdma2000 network is generally established ahead of the HRPD network,<br>
some terminals of the HRPD network are upgraded from that of the<br>
cdma2000 network. In general, the existing MSs whose cards is separatable<br>
from them support only the CAVE algorithm during the authentication<br>
process. To support the dual-mode operation, the MSs' R-UIM cards should<br>
be upgraded to the multi-mode ones, and make them support not only the<br>
CAVE algorithm but also the HRPD network's access authentication<br><br>
algorithms like the MD5 algorithm, etc., so as to support this two kinds of<br>
networks' authentication simultaneously. Because of a great deal of<br>
terminals, the fees spent on the upgrade of R-UIM cards will be very huge,<br>
and this operation will bring much inconvenience to the terminals as well,<br>
and by far, no multi-mode R-UIM card is on sale yet.<br>
Therefore, as the cdma2000 network has been launched into operation<br>
and holds a lot of terminals, how to realize the dual-mode terminal's access<br>
authentication with the cost as low as possible is a challenge to the HRPD<br>
network construction.<br>
The existing R-UIM cards only support CAVE algorithm, not only the<br>
network must be upgraded but also the R-UIM cards must be upgraded to<br>
multi-mode ones to upgrade to the HRPD network.However, following<br>
problems exsits: 1) no multi-mode R-UIM card is on sate by far; 2)<br>
considerable fees should be spent on upgrading the R-UIM cards; and 3) it<br>
is inconvenient for the terminals to replace the their R-UIM card.<br>
Although the problems mentioned above will be avoided when the<br>
authentication problem can be overcome in terms of the network side, no<br>
function or operation flow of authenticating in terms of the HRPD network<br>
side is launched to revolve the problems above by far. Thus the present<br>
invention is proposed for it.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method for access<br>
authentication in a HRPD network without modifying HRPD message<br>
streams, which can support the HRPD network access authentication of<br>
dual-mode terminals that adopt CAVE algorithm. In addition, another object<br>
of the present invention is to provide an authentication function with which<br>
a terminal can realize the HRPD network access authentication by directly<br>
inserting an original R-UIM card which is in service in the cdma2000<br>
network into a dual-mode terminal.<br>
To acchieve the object mentioned above, a method for access<br>
authentication in a HRPD network comprising steps of:<br>
after receiving a Radius Access Request message from a HRPD AN, an<br>
AN-AAA judging a terminal's home location according to a NAI value<br><br>
included in the received message;<br>
forwarding the access request to the AN-AAA of the terminal's home<br>
location for authentication if the AN-AAA determine that the terminal is<br>
roaming;<br>
for a local terminal, the AN-AAA judging the terminal type according to<br>
the relevant information such as the NAI value;<br>
for a cdma2000/HRPD dual-mode terminal, the AN-AAA generating a<br>
random number "RAND" that is necessary to calculate the authentication<br>
parameter 2 by using the "Random text" included in the Radius Access<br>
Request message and calculating an authentication parameter 2 with the<br>
RAND with a CAVE algorithm;<br>
the AN-AAA comparing the authentication parameter 2 with the<br>
authentication parameter 1 that is sent from the terminal through the Radius<br>
Access Request message, and if they are just the same, the authentication<br>
passes, otherwise, the terminal is rejected; and<br>
for an HRPD single-mode terminal, the AN-AAA adopting a MD5<br>
algorithm to perform authentication , calculating the authentication<br>
parameter 2 with the user password and this random number and comparing<br>
the authentication parameter 2 with the authentication parameter 1 that is<br>
sent from the terminal through the Radius Access Request message, if they<br>
are just the same, the authentication passes, otherwise, the terminal is<br>
rejected.<br>
In the steps above, the SSD_A in the AN-AAA is obtained from the<br>
cdma2000 network. The AN-AAA obtains the SSD_A in virtue of the<br>
HLR/AuC of the cdma2000 network. In this case, an ANSI-41 channel is<br>
needed to be established between the AN-AAA and the HLR/AuC. The<br>
AN-AAA is regarded as a virtual VLR of the cdma2000 network, and the<br>
sharing of the SSD_A between the AN-AAA and the HLR/AuC is realized<br>
by the ANSI-41 messages. Figure 8 illustrates the network connection in the<br>
case that the SSD_A is shared between the AN-AAA and the HLR/AC, and<br>
figure 9 illustrates a message flow in the case that the SSDA is shared<br>
between the AN-AAA and the HLR/AC. When it is necessary to share the<br>
SSD_A, the AN-AAA should construct the Authentication Request Call<br>
message according to the contents of the Radius Access Request message<br>
and then sends it to the HLR/AC. In the corresponding domains of this<br>
message, the support to the CAVE authentication and the sharing of SSD<br><br>
must be specified. If the Chap response message contains the parameter<br>
SSD, the AN-AAA will extract the SSD and store for CAVE authentication.<br>
The present invention is adapted to resolve the HRPD network access<br>
authentication problem for the cdma2000/HRPD dual-mode terminals based<br>
on CAVE authentication algorithm. In this invention, the HRPD network's<br>
message flow is not needed to be modified, i.e., neither modification is<br>
needed to be done to existing HRPD network access equipments, nor the<br>
R-UIM card is needed to be replaced. The AN-AAA realized according to<br>
the description of the present invention can implement a terminal's HRPD<br>
network access authentication.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The main object of the present invention is to realize the HRPD<br>
network's authentication without modifying the large quantities of R-UIM<br>
cards used in the existing cdma2000 MSs and the HRPD network's<br>
authentication flow. With the AN-AAA according to the present solution,<br>
the R-UIM cards can be still in service after the cdma2000 terminals are<br>
upgraded to the cdma2000/HRPD dual-mode ones. In general, with the<br><br>
present solution, marked benefits will be gained at very little cost.<br>
The present invention is based on following facts that: the HRPD<br>
network does not support the CAVE algorithm, because no message flow<br>
that exists in the HRPD network can support the SSD update. However, the<br>
existing terminals' R-UIM cards provide only the CAVE algorithm. The<br>
main idea of the present invention is to make the existing HRPD message<br>
flows support the CAVE algorithm with the method for HRPD network<br>
access authentication, and in virtue of the SSD update result of the<br>
cdma2000 network and the terminals, the object of not changing existing<br>
terminals' R-UIM cards will be acchieved.<br>
The authentication problem also can be well resolved for the HRPD<br>
single-mode terminals that support the MD5 algorithm according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
To enable the HRPD network's AN-AAA to support CAVE-based and<br>
MD5-based HRPD access authentications simultaneously without<br>
modifying the HRPD's existing message flow, following aspects should be<br>
performed by the AN-AAA:<br>
(1)	judging whether the terminal is a roaming one by the AN-AAA.<br>
The Radius Access Request message is sent from the HRPD AN for<br>
terminal authentication, which includes three parameters of the NAI, the<br>
Random text and the Result 1. After receiving the Radius Access Request<br>
message from the HRPD AN, the AN-AAA determines the terminal's home<br>
location according to the NAI domain included in the received message. In<br>
the present solution, the NAI value should be formed in the form of<br>
IMSI@domain name. According to the domain name in the NAI, the<br>
AN-AAA can determine whether this terminal roams from any other<br>
operator . If it determines that the terminal roams from any other network,<br>
the AN-AAA transmits this terminal's authentication information to the<br>
corresponding home network. If it determines that the terminal is local, the<br>
AN-AAA will further determine whether the terminal is roaming from<br>
another place according to the IMSI in the NAI. If it determines that the<br>
terminal is from another place, the AN-AAA will transmit the terminal's<br>
authentication information to the AN-AAA of the terminal's home location<br>
according to the IMSI.<br>
(2)	judging whether the terminal is in single-mode or dual-mode by the<br><br>
AN-AAA.<br>
Since the NAI value is a terminal's unique ID (they are not consistent<br>
with one another), the AN-AAA can judge whether the terminal is in<br>
single-mode or dual-mode according to the IMSI in the NAI value. If the<br>
operator can allocate different IMSI number segmentes to a single-mode<br>
terminal and a dual-mode terminal respectively, the AN-AAA can judge the<br>
terminal's type according to the number segment which the IMSI belongs to,<br>
and a terminal's type judgment can also be made by retrieving special flag<br>
bits stored in the AN-AAA in advance according to the IMSI.<br>
(3)	processing the access authentication of an HRPD single-mode<br>
terminal by the AN-AAA.<br>
For the HRPD single-mode terminal, it is necessary for the AN-AAA to<br>
store the terminal's password in advance. The AN-AAA calculates the<br>
authentication parameter 2 by the MD5 algorithm with the terminal's<br>
password and the "Random text" included in the Radius Access Request<br>
message, and compares this result with the authentication parameter 1<br>
fetched by the Result domain of the Radius Access Request message. If they<br>
are just the same, the authentication passes, otherwise, the authentication<br>
fails.<br>
(4)	processing the access authentication of a cdma2000/HRPD<br>
dual-mode terminal by the AN-AAA.<br>
4.1 obtaining a terminal's SSD_A in the AN-AAA<br>
To support the CAVE algorithm, the AN-AAA obtains the terminal's<br>
SSD_A from the cdma2000 network. The AN-AAA shares the SSD_A via<br>
the HLR/AuC of the cdma2000 network. The AN-AAA is regarded as a<br>
virtual VLR of the cdma2000 network and the ANSI-41 MAP D interface is<br>
established between the AN-AAA and the HLR/AuC. The AN-AAA shares<br>
the SSD_A with the cdma2000 network by the normal ANSI-41 messages.<br>
4.2 processing the parameter domain "Random text" included in the Radius<br>
Access Request message by the AN-AAA.<br>
The AN-AAA obtains the 32-bit random number according to the<br>
Random text. The Random text is a character string presented by octets<br>
with lengh of over 32-bit. It is necessry to convert the octets into binary<br>
format and extract 32 bits. No specification is given on the extraction of the -<br>
32 bits but the consistency must be kept between the AT and the AN-AAA<br>
at all. The AN-AAA calculates the authentication parameter 2 by the CAVE<br><br>
algorithm with the 32-bit random number and the SSD_A obtained with the<br>
approach above and other parameters, then compares it with the<br>
authentication parameter 1. If they are just the same, the authentication on<br>
the terminal passes, otherwise, the terminal is rejected to access the<br>
network.<br>
4.3 processing the parameter domain "Result" in the Radius Access<br>
Request message by the AN-AAA.<br>
The dual-mode terminal obtains the authentication parameter 1 through<br>
the CAVE algorithm, which is carried by the Result domain. Since the<br>
Result domain is relatively large, for the format in which the authentication<br>
parameter 1 is stored in the Result domain, consistency should be<br>
prescribed for the AN-AAA and the dual-mode terminals.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the method for access authentication in the HRPD<br>
network. Now the operation steps will be explained in more detail.<br>
The AN-AAA receives the Radius Access Request message from the<br>
HRPD AN, in which parameters of the Network Access ID (NAI), the<br>
Random text, the authentication parameter 1 (Result 1) and so on are<br>
included in step 101.<br>
The AN-AAA judges whether the terminal is roaming according to the<br>
NAI. The AN-AAA judges whether the terminal belongs to the network<br>
according to the second half of the NAI. If so, further judgment is made to<br>
determine whether the terminal is a local one according to the first half of<br>
the NAI in step 102.<br>
If the terminal is roaming, the AN-AAA transmits its authentication<br>
information to its home location in step 103.<br>
If the terminal is a local one, the AN-AAA judges the type of the<br>
terminal according to the IMSI in the NAI value in step 104.<br>
If the terminal is in single-mode, the AN-AAA calculates the<br>
authentication parameter 2 (Result 2) with the MD5 algorithm in step 105.<br>
If the terminal is in dual-mode, the AN-AAA calculates the Result 2<br>
with the CAVE algorithm. Here, the SSD_A is obtained with the previously<br>
described approaches by the AN-AAA, and 32 bits extracted out of the<br>
random number included in the Radius Access Request message serve as<br>
the random number for the CAVE algorithm in step 106.<br>
The Result 1 is compared with the Result 2 in step 107.<br>
If they are equal to, the authentication passes, and the AN-AAA sends a<br><br><br>
Radius Access Request Accept message to the HRPD AN in step 108.<br>
If they are different, the authentication fails, and the AN-AAA sends a<br>
Radius Access Request Reject message to the HRPD AN. Till now, the<br>
authentication flow completes, in step 101.<br>
