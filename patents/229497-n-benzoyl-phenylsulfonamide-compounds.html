				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates t<. n- compounds.></.>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In recent years fundamental adv ances have been made in the development of<br>
chemical agents and regimens of theraf y to combat neoplastic diseases. Despite these<br>
continuing advances, cancers continue o exact intolerable levels of human pain and<br>
suffering. The need for new and better methods of treating malignant neoplasms and<br>
leukemias continues to fuel efforts to c reate new classes of compounds, especially in the area<br>
of inoperable or metastatic solid tumors. The recent avalanche of information regarding the<br>
basic biological processes involved in neoplasms has led to a deeper understanding of the<br>
heterogeneity of tumors. It is because of this extreme heterogeneity among populations of<br>
neoplastic cells that new chemotherap eutic agents should have a wide spectrum of activity<br>
and an acceptable therapeutic index, ln addition, such agents must be chemically stable and<br>
compatible with other agents. It is also important that any chemotherapeutic regimen be as<br>
convenient and painless as possible to the patient.<br>
Chemotherapy and radiation are frequently used in the treatment of cancer and,<br>
although they often produce some re sponse in the malignant disease, they are rarely<br>
curative. Most solid tumors increase in mass through the proliferation of malignant cells<br>
and stromal cells, including endothe ial cells. In order for a tumor to grow larger than 2-3<br>
millimeters in diameter, it must form a vasculature, a process known as angiogenesis.<br>
Suppression of tumor-induced angic genesis by angiostatin and endostatin has been reported<br>
to result in antitumor activity (O'Reilly, et al., Cell, 88, 277-285 (1997)). Because<br>
angiogenesis is a critical componen of the mass expansion of most solid tumors, the<br>
development of new agents for the nhibition of this process represents a promising<br>
approach for antitumor therapy. Th s approach to antitumor therapy may lack the toxic side<br>
effects or drug resistance-inducing properties of conventional chemotherapy (Judah<br>
I'olkman, Endogenous Inhibitors o Angiogenesis, The Harvey Lectures, Series 92, pages<br>
65-82, Wiley-Liss Inc., (1998)).<br>
The N-[bcnzoylj-phenylsulfonamides are well known in the agricultural chemical<br>
arts as insecticides and herbicides DE 2744137). The use of N-[benzoyI]-<br>
phenylsulfonamides as antitumor; agents generally, or as inhibitors of angiogenesis<br>
specifically, were heretofore not a opredated.<br><br><br>

The compounds of the preser t invention are acidic in nature and accordingly may<br>
react with any of a number of inorganic and organic bases, including amines and<br>
quaternary ammonium bases, to form. pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts. It<br>
is preferable to convert the compounds of Formula II to their pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
base addition salts for ease of admin; stration when aqueous solutions of the subject<br>
compound are required. The Formula II compounds can react with basic materials such as<br>
alkali metal- or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, carbonates, and bicarbonates including,<br>
without limitation, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium hydroxide, calcium<br>
hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, etc. to form pharmaceutically acceptable salts such as the<br>
corresponding sodium, potassium, li hium, or calcium salt. The sodium and potassium<br>
salts are especially preferred.<br>
Examples of amines suitable for forming salts are: primary, secondary and<br>
tertiary aliphatic and aromatic amines, such as methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine,<br>
i-propylamine, the four isomeric but /lamines, dimethylamine, diethylamine,<br>
diethanolamine, dipropylamine, diisopropylamine, di-n-butylamine, pyrrolidine,<br>
piperidine, morpholine, trimethylam ne, triethyiamine, tripropylamine, quinuclidine,<br>
pyridine, quinoline and isoquinoline especially ethyl-, propyl-, diethyl- or<br>
tri ethyl amine, but particulary isopropylamine and diethanolamine.<br>
Examples of quaternary amn onium bases are in general the cations of<br>
haloammonium salts, for example the tetramethylammonium cation, the<br>
trimethylbenzylammonium cation, the triethylbenzylammonium cation, the<br><br>
tetraethylammonium cation or the trimethylethylammonium cation, but also the<br>
ammonium cation.<br>
The compounds of the present i invention may be prepared by methods well known<br>
to one of ordinary skill in the art. Generally, the iV-[benzoyl]-phenylsulfonamides of<br>
Formula II are prepared by coupling an appropriately substituted phenylsulfonamide with<br>
an appropriately substituted benzoic ac id or benzoic acid derivative as illustrated in the<br>
following scheme. The variables R1, F 2, R2a, R2b, R3, R3a, and R4 are as previously<br>
defined and Z is OH, Cl, Br, methanesulfonyloxy, or trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy.<br><br>
When Z is OH, the corresponding benzoic acid is coupled to the<br>
phenylsulfonamide under standard peptide coupling conditions well known to the skilled<br>
artisan. Specifically, the phenylsulfor amide and the benzoic acid are coupled in the<br>
presence of a peptide coupling reagen , optionally in the presence of a catalyst. Suitable<br>
peptide coupling reagents include N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), N,N'-<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), l-( 3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide<br>
hydrochloride (EDC), and l-(3-(l-pyirolidinyl)propyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (PEPC).<br>
Polymer supported forms of EDC (Tetrahedron Letters. 34(48), 7685 (1993)) and PEPC<br>
(U.S. Patent #5,792,763) have been described, and are very useful for the preparation of<br>
the compounds of the present invention. Suitable catalysts for the coupling reaction<br>
include N,N-dimethyl-4-aminopyridine (DMAP). All of the reagents are combined in a<br>
suitable solvent, typically dichlorome thane, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, or<br>
diethyl ether and are stirred for from . to 72 hours at a temperature of from ambient to<br>
about the reflux temperature of the solvent. The desired product may be isolated by<br>
standard extractive and crystallization techniques, and purified by chromatography or<br><br>
crystallization as necessary or desired. Where polymer-bound reagents are employed,<br>
they may be conveniently removed fron the reaction mixture by filtration.<br>
Alternatively, the sulfonamide may be reacted with a benzoic acid derivative, such<br>
as compounds where Z is chloro, bromo, methanesulfonyloxy, or trifluoromethanesul-<br>
fonyloxy, in the presence of an acid sea /enger such as pyridine, triethylamine, or a basic<br>
resin, optionally in the presence of a catalyst. The reagents are combined, and products<br>
isolated, essentially as described supra.<br>
One skilled in the art would appreciate that compounds of Formula II where X is<br>
NH may be prepared as illustrated in Sc heme U where R1, R2, R2a, R2b, R3, R3a, and R4 are<br>
as previously defined.<br><br>
An appropriately substituted be azamidine is reacted with sulfonyl derivatives,<br>
such as compounds where Z' is chloro, bromo, methanesulfonyloxy, or<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy, in the pre sence of an acid scavenger such as pyridine,<br>
triethylamine, or a basic resin, optional (y in the presence of a catalyst. The reagents are<br>
combined, and products isolated, essentially as described supra.<br>
The requisite benzoic acids, benzoic acid derivatives, benzamidines, sulfonyl<br>
derivatives and sulfonamides are either commercially available or may be prepared by<br>
methods well known to the skilled arti: an.<br><br>

ESI-MS m/e 410.96 / 410.0 [M+-H]<br>
The compounds of EXAMPLES 119-130 are prepared essentially as described in<br>
the procedure for EXAMPLE 118.<br><br><br><br>
All of the compounds concerned are orally available and are normally<br>
administered orally, and so oral administration is preferred. However, oral administration<br>
is not the only route or even the only preferred route. For example, transdermal<br>
administration may be very desirable for patients who are forgetful or petulant about<br>
taking oral medicine, and the i ltravenous route may be preferred as a matter of<br>
convenience or to avoid poten ial complications related to oral administration.<br>
Compounds of Formula II ma / also be administered by the percutaneous, intramuscular,<br>
intranasal or intrarectal route n particular circumstances. The route of administration<br>
may be varied in any way, lin ited by the physical properties of the drugs, the convenience<br>
of the patient and the caregiver, and other relevant circumstances (Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, Mack Publishing Co. (1990)).<br><br>
The pharmaceutical compositic ns are prepared in a manner, well known in the<br>
pharmaceutical art. The carrier or excibient may be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material<br>
that can serve as a vehicle or medium for the active ingredient. Suitable carriers or<br>
excipients are well known in the art. The pharmaceutical composition may be adapted for<br>
oral, inhalation, parenteral, or topical use and may be administered to the patient in the<br>
form of tablets, capsules, aerosols, inhalants, suppositories, solutions, suspensions, or the<br>
like.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be administered orally, for example,<br>
with an inert diluent for capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral<br>
therapeutic administration, the compounds may be incorporated with excipients and used<br>
in the form of tablets, troches, capsufes, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, chewing<br>
gums and the like. These preparatic ns should contain at. least 4% of the compound of the<br>
present invention, the active ingredient, but may be varied depending upon the particular<br>
form and may conveniently be between 4% to about 70% of the weight of the unit. The<br>
amount of the compound present in compositions is such that a suitable dosage will be<br>
obtained. Preferred compositions and preparations of the present invention may be<br>
determined by methods well known to the skilled artisan.<br>
The tablets, pills, capsules, troches, and the like may also contain one or more of<br>
the following adjuvants: binders such as povidone, hydroxypropyl cellulose,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, or gelatin, excipients or diluents such as:  starch, lactose,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose or dicalcium phosphate; disintegrating agents such as:<br>
croscarmellose, crospovidone, sodium starch glycolate, corn starch and the like; lubricants<br>
such as: magnesium stearate, steric acid, talc or hydrogenated vegetable oil; glidants such<br>
as colloidal silicon dioxide; wetting agents such as: sodium lauryl sulfate and polysorbate<br>
80 (CAS No.9005-65-6); and sweetening agents such as: sucrose, aspartame or saccharin<br>
may be added or a flavoring agent such as: peppermint, methyl salicylate or orange<br>
flavoring. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials<br>
of the above type, a liquid carrier such as polyethylene glycol or a fatty oil. Other dosage<br>
unit forms may contain other va ious materials that modify the physical form of the<br>
dosage unit, for example, as coatings. Thus, tablets or pills may be coated with sugar,<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose polymethacrylates, or other coating agents. Syrups may<br>
contain, in addition to the present compounds, sucrose as a sweetening agent and certain<br><br>
preservatives, dyes and colorings and. flavors. Materials used in preparing these various<br>
compositions should be pharmaceuty cally pure and non-toxic in the amounts used.<br>
Injections for parenteral adrr frustration include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous<br>
solutions, suspensions and emulsions. Aqueous solutions and suspensions may include<br>
distilled water for injection or phys ological salt solution. Non-aqueous solutions and<br>
suspensions may include propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oil such as<br>
olive oil, alcohol such as ethanol or polysorbate 80. Injections may comprise additional<br>
ingredients other than inert diluents e.g. preserving agents, wetting agents, emulsifying<br>
agents, dispersing agents, stabilizing agents (such as lactose), assisting agents such as<br>
agents to assist dissolution (e.g. g utamic acid or aspartic acid). They may be sterilized<br>
for example, by filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, by incorporation of sterilizing<br>
agents in the compositions or by rradiation. They may also be manufactured in the form<br>
of sterile solid compositions whi :h may be dissolved in sterile water or some other sterile<br>
diluent(s) for injection immedial ely before use.<br>
The compounds of Formula II are generally effective over a wide dosage<br>
range. For example, dosages pe r day normally fall within the range of about 10 to<br>
about 300 mg/kg of body weight. In some instances dosage levels below the lower<br>
limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still<br>
larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, and therefore<br>
the above dosage range is not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way.<br>
It will be understood that the amount of the compound actually administered will be<br>
determined by a physician, in he light of the relevant circumstances, including the<br>
condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound or<br>
compounds administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, and<br>
the severity of the patient's s&gt; mptoms.<br>
Inhibition of HUVEC Prolife ration<br>
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC; BioWhittaker/Clonetics,<br>
Walkersville, MD) were mai ntained in endothelial cell growth medium (EGM) containing<br>
basal medium (EBM) with bovine brain extract, human epidermal growth factor,<br>
hydrocortisone, gentamicin, amphotericin B and 2% fetal bovine serum. For the assay,<br>
HUVEC (5 x 103) in EBM (200 µl) with 0.5% fetal bovine serum were added to wells in a<br><br>
96-well cell culture plate and incubaced at 37°C for 24 hr in humidified 5% carbon<br>
dioxide/air. The test compounds were serially diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in<br>
concentrations from 0.0013 to 40 µvl and added to the wells in 20 µl. Then human<br>
vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF) (20 ng/mL in wells; R&amp;D Systems,<br>
Minneapolis, MN) prepared from a stock solution of 100 µ,g/mL in phosphate buffered<br>
normal saline containing 0.1 % bovine serum albumin,, was added to the wells. The<br>
HUVBC were incubated at 37°C for 72 hr in humidified 5% carbon dioxide/air. WSX-1<br>
cell proliferation reagent (20 µl; Foehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) was added to<br>
the wells and the plates returned to the incubator for 1 hr. The absorbance of each well at<br>
440 nra was measured. The growth fraction was determined from the absorbance of<br>
treated wells with and without VEGF divided by the absorbance obtained from control<br>
wells set to zero and 1.0. The exemplified compounds were tested in this assay and all<br>
exhibited an IC50 
Rat Corneal Micropocket Assa'<br>
Fisher 344 female rats ( 145-155 grams; Taconic, Inc., Germantown, NY) were<br>
anesthesized with acepromazine (2.5 mg/kg, ip) 20 minutes prior to initiation of 2-3%<br>
isoflurane/oxygen inhalation. The body temperature was maintained with a circulating<br>
hot water pad. The surgery was performed using an ophthalmic operating microscope<br>
(OMS.75 Operating Microscope, TopCon Corporation, Japan). A scalpel blade (#15) was<br>
vsed to make a vertical half-tldckness linear corneal incision just lateral to the center of<br>
the eye. The tip of the scalpe blade was used to gently undermine the superior corneal<br>
layer of the cornea nearest to the limbus. A pocket was formed in the cornea using blunt<br>
dissection with corneal scissors (Roboz, Rockville, MD). Nitrocellulose filters (0.45 µn,<br>
Millipore, Bedford, MA) were cut into small disks using a 20 gauge needle punch. The<br>
disks were soaked in 2 µ1 of ouman VEGF solution (0.82 vg/µl; R&amp;D Systems) or human<br>
basic fibroblast growth factor (0.20 µg/µl; R&amp;D Systems) for 10 minutes on ice. Using<br>
forceps, the disks impregnated with the angiogenic factor (VEGF or bFGF) were inserted<br>
into the corneal pocket so th at the disk is firmly covered with corneal epithelium. The<br>
animals were treated with th e compound of Example 110 (160 mg/kg) administered orally<br>
by gavage in phosphate buftered saline once per day on days 1 through 10 post<br>
implantation of the disks. The eyes were photographed on days 7 and 14 post<br><br>
implantation of the disks. For photography, the animals were treated with atropine sulfate<br>
(AmTech Group, Inc., Phoenix Scier tific, Inc., St. Joseph, MO) topically for mydriasis<br>
and anesthetized with 2-3% isoflurane/oxygen. The eyes were photographed using the<br>
ophthalmic microscope and the images were saved using Image Pro-Plus software. The<br>
images were analyzed by converting the area of interest to high contrast black and white<br>
reversed image and counting the bnght pixels as a determination of the vascular area. The<br>
data are images from at least 6 eyes. The compound of Example 110 was a very effective<br>
inhibitor of VEGF-induced neoangiogenesis, but was not an effective inhibitor of bFGF-<br>
induced neoangiogenesis.<br>
HCT116 Colon Cajnginoma Cell Growth Inhibition<br>
Human HCT116 colon carcinoma ceils were grown monolayer culture in RPMI<br>
1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin<br>
(GibcoBRL, Grand Island, NY). HCT116 cells in exponential growth phase were<br>
exposed to various coneentratiot s of the test compounds at 37°C for 72 hr in 5% carbon<br>
dioxide/air. After exposure to the agent, the cells were washed with 0.9% phosphate<br>
buffered saline. Growth inhibition was determined using WST-1 cell proliferation reagent<br>
as described above. The results are expressed as the growth fraction of treated cells<br>
compared with control cultures. Representative compounds of the present invention were<br>
tested for efficacy against the human colon HCT116 tumor cells. The data from these<br>
experiments are summarized in TABLE I.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Conventional Murine Tumor andHnman Tumor Xenograft Assays<br>
Inhibition of tumors transplanted into mice is an accepted procedure for studying<br>
the efficacy of antitumor agents (Corbett, et al., In vivo Methods for Screening and<br>
Preclinical Testing; Use of roden solid tumors for drug discovery In: Anticancer Drug<br>
Development Guide; Preclinical Screening, Clinical Trials, and Approval, B. Teichcr<br>
(ed), Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ, Chapter 5, pages 75-99 (1997); (Corbett, et al., Int<br>
J. Pharmacog., 33, Supplement, 102-122 (1995)). Murine tumors or human xenographs<br>
were implanted essentially as described by Corbett in In vivo Methods for Screening and<br>
Preclinical Testing; Use of rode at solid tumors for drug discovery. Briefly, the murine<br>
tumor or human xenograph was implanted subcutaneously using either 12-gauge trocar<br>
implants or counted number of cells. The location for the trocar insertion is midway<br>
between the axillary and inguir at region along the side of the mouse. The trocar is<br>
slipped approximately 3/4 of a I inch subcutaneously up toward the axilla before<br>
discharging the tumor fragment, and pinching the skin as the trocar is removed.<br>
Alternatively, human tumor cells prepared from a brie of donor tumors (5 x 106 cells)<br>
were implanted subcutaneousl y in a hind-leg of a male or female nude mouse (Charles<br>
River). Either a test compoun i in vehicle or vehicle alone was administered by<br>
intravenous bolus injection (iv), intraperitoneal injection (ip), or oral gavage (po). Each<br>
treatment group, as well as a group of untreated control animals, consisted of five animals<br>
per group in each experiment. Subcutaneous tumor response was monitored by tumor<br>
volume measurement pcrforrr ed twice each week over the course of the experiment (60-<br>
i 20 days). Body weights were taken as a general measure of toxicity. The subcutaneous<br>
tumor data were analyzed by ietermining the median tumor weight for each treatment<br>
group over the course of the experiment and calculating the tumor growth delay as the<br><br>
difference in days for the treatment versus the control tumors to reach a volume of either<br>
500 or 1000 mm3.<br>
The compound of Example 1 0 was tested against a variety of murine and human<br>
tumors substantially as described surra. The data from these tests are summarized in<br>
TABLES n-XIII. The parameters measured in each experiment are summarized in the<br>
following paragraphs.<br>
Tumor Weight(mg) = (a x b ')/2 where a =tumor length (mm) and b = tumor width<br>
(mm).<br>
Tumor Growth Delay = T - C where T is the median time (days) required for the<br>
treatment group tumors to each a predetermined size, and C is the median time<br>
(days) for the control group tumors to reach the same size. Tumor-free survivors<br>
are excluded from this caleulation, and are tabulated separately (Tumor Free).<br>
Log Kill = Tumor Growth Delay<br>
(3.32)(Td)<br>
where Tumor Growth Delay is as previously defined and Td is tumor volume<br>
doubling time (days), estimated from the best fit straight line from a log-linear<br>
growth plot of the contrc 1 group of tumors in exponential growth (100-800 mg<br>
range)<br>
%T/C mass - The treatr lent and control groups are measured when the control<br>
group tumors reach app oximately 700 to 1200 mg in size (median group). The<br>
median tumor weight o ' each group is determined (including zeros). The T/C<br>
value in percent is an ir dication of antitumor effectiveness. A T/C 
considered significant antitumor activity. A T/C 
highly significant antitu mor activity.<br>
Body weight Loss Nadir - A body weight loss nadir (mean of group) of greater<br>
than 20% or drug deaths greater than 20% are considered to indicate an<br>
excessively toxic dosa ge in single course trials.<br><br>
Activity Rating - the Activity Rating is derived from the Log Kill according to the<br>
following table:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
