				<td>TWO-PART HAIR DYE<br>
Field of the Invention [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a two-part hair dye.<br>
Background of the Invention [0002]<br>
Conventionally, hair dye compositions in a form of liquid or cream have been broadly used, however it is not easy to apply them to hair evenly. When a consumer herself applies a dye to her own hair root or the back of her own head, not only skills in a hair blocking or two-mirror technique and the like are required, but also a careful manipulation is required for uniform application. [0003]<br>
To simplify the dyeing procedure, it has been proposed to discharge the dye in the form of foam, and two-part aerosol dyes and one-part non-aerosol dyes have been known. Concerning the two-part aerosol dyes, there have been the following problems that: a mixture ratio of the first part and the second part is not constant and uneven bleaching or uneven dyeing is likely to take place; a high pressure metallic vessel may be corroded by oxidation by hydrogen peroxide; and the internal pressure of the high pressure vessel may rise excessively by decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Concerning the one-<br>
part non-aerosol dyes, there have been the following problems that: due to non- or weak bleaching ability, it is difficult to change a color tone substantially with a single dyeing operation; and to dye to a brilliant color tone, it is required to leave the dye on the hair for a long period of time after application or repeat the operation thereby making the dyeing operation rather cumbersome. [0004]<br>
On the other hand, two-part hair dye compositions to be discharged in the form of foam from a non-aerosol foamer vessel have been proposed (Patent Document 1 and Patent Document 2). By discharging a liquid mixture of the first and second parts from the non-aerosol foamer vessel in the form of foam, the mixture ratio thereof can be more constant than the conventional two-part aerosol dyes, and sufficient bleaching ability and dyeability compared with the conventional one-part non-aerosol dyes can be obtained. [0005]<br>
Patent Document 1: JP-A-2004-339216 Patent Document 2: JP-A-2006-124279<br>
Summary of the Invention [0006]<br>
The present invention provides a two-part hair dye including a first part containing an alkali agent, a second part containing hydrogen peroxide and a non-<br>
aerosol foamer vessel to discharge in the form of foam a liquid mixture of the first part and the second part, wherein the liquid mixture contains anionic surfactant(s) selected from the following components (Al) to (A3):<br>
(Al) a carboxylate type anionic surfactant;<br>
(A2) a sulfonate type anionic surfactant; and<br>
(A3) a phosphate type anionic surfactant. [0007]<br>
The present invention further provides a two-part hair dye including a first part containing an alkali agent, a second part containing hydrogen peroxide and a non-aerosol foamer vessel to discharge in the form of foam a liquid mixture of the first part and the second part, wherein the liquid mixture contains the following components (A4) and (A5):<br>
(A4) an ionic surfactant; and<br>
(A5) a fatty acid alkanolamide. [0008]<br>
The present invention further provides a method for dyeing hair, including the steps of discharging in the form of foam the aforedescribed liquid mixture in the two-part hair dye from a non-aerosol foamer vessel; applying the foam to the hair; and foaming again the foam on the hair.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention [0009]<br>
The present invention relates to a two-part hair dye in the form of foam superior in preservation stability, ease of application to the hair and low irritation to the scalp while maintaining the advantages of good bleaching ability and dyeability according to Japanese Patent 1 and Japanese Patent 2, and to a two-part hair dye in the form of foam superior in a foaming property also at a lower temperature and resistant to drip from the application of the liquid mixture to the hair until being washed away.<br>
[0010]<br>
The present inventors have discovered that with a non-aerosol two-part hair dye by use of a specific surfactant in the liquid mixture of the first and second parts the aforedescribed object can be achieved, thereby accomplishing the present invention.<br>
[0011]<br>
According to the present invention, the liquid mixture of the first and second parts can be discharged in the form of foam and applied to the hair evenly and easily. The discharged foam of the liquid mixture is compatible to the hair so that a large amount can be applied; is free from irritation to the scalp, spattering of the liquid, or dripping of the liquid; and has sufficient bleaching ability or dyeability.  Consequently, the two-part hair dye of the present invention can realize easily and comfortably a uniform and less uneven bleaching or dyeing.<br>
[0012]<br>
The liquid mixture discharged in the form of foam by gas/liquid mixing using the non-aerosol foamer vessel can reach easily the hair root without forming a liquid pool spreading appropriately over a part of the hair to be bleached or dyed. Consequently, extreme blonding at the hair root or uneven bleaching or dyeing caused by unevenness in the coated amount of the liquid mixture does not occur as in the case of a conventional liquid or cream type dye. Therefore the two-part hair dye of the present invention can be applied to the hair at new growth areas near a part or a face line, so that color difference between the new growth area and previously dyed area can be eliminated to achieve a natural finish. Further, since the liquid mixture can be applied to the hair in an appropriate amount, damages to the hair can be reduced.<br>
[0013]<br>
If the anionic surfactant selected from the components (Al) to (A3), or the components (A4) and (A5) as surfactants are contained in the first part containing the alkali agent, or in the second part containing hydrogen peroxide, the preservation stability is good and preferable quality of foam can be maintained for a long time.<br>
[0014]<br><definitions><br>
A hair means herein a hair fixed on the head, and a hair separated from the head, such as a wig or a tress, is excluded. Although there is no restriction on a hair, from a doll's hair to an animal hair, a human hair is preferable.<br>
[0015]<br>
Herein a simple expression of a "two-part dye" refers to a broad concept including also a non-aerosol foamer vessel. Further, the two-part dye refers to a concept including both a hair dye containing a dyestuff, and a bleach not containing a dyestuff. Furthermore, a "liquid mixture in the two-part dye" means the liquid mixture of the first and second parts. A method for dyeing the hair refers to a concept including a method for bleaching the hair.<br>
[0016]<br><alkali agent><br>
As the alkali agent to be contained in the first part, for example, ammonia, an alkanolamine such as ethanolamine, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide can be used. Further, as a buffer, an ammonium salt, such as ammonium hydrogencarbonate and ammonium chloride, and a carbonate, such as potassium carbonate and sodium hydrogen carbonate may be appropriately added.<br>
[0017]<br>
The pH of the liquid mixture of the first and second parts of the two-part hair dye of the present invention is preferably 8 to 11, more preferably 9 to 11, and the amount of the alkali agent for use is adjusted appropriately so that the pH of the liquid mixture fall within the above range.<br>

(A2) a sulfonate type anionic surfactant; and (A3) a phosphate type anionic surfactant; a two-part hair dye in the form of foam superior in preservation stability, ease of application to the hair and low irritation to the scalp while exerting good bleaching ability and dyeability can be obtained.<br>

[0081]<br>

In case the higher alcohol is added to the second part, the content therein is preferably 0.01 to 2% by mass, more preferably 0.1 to 1.5% by mass and even more preferably 0.5 to 1% by mass.<br>
[0089]<br>
If the two-part hair dye of the present invention uses the combination of (A4) the ionic surfactant and<br>
(A5) the fatty acid alkanolamide, in view of the foaming property at a lower temperature, the higher alcohol should be preferably not contained or contained in a small amount. From this view point, the content of the higher alcohol in the liquid mixture of the first and second parts of such a two-part hair dye is preferably 0 to 0.8% by mass, more preferably 0.01 to 0.7% by mass, and even more preferably 0.1 to 0.6% by mass.<br>
[0090]<br><nonvolatile hydrophilic solvent><br>
Preferably either of the first part and the second part contains also a nonvolatile hydrophilic solvent. Owing thereto, the irritation to the scalp caused by the concentration of irritating components such as hydrogen peroxide due to the evaporation of water from the hair dye, while the applied two-part hair dye of the present<br>
invention is left on the hair, can be reduced. As the nonvolatile hydrophilic solvent, polyols and lower alkyl<br>
(C1 to C4)   ethers thereof not having anti-foaming activity are preferable. For polyols, those with C2 to C6 are preferable. Examples thereof include glycerin, diglycerin, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, 1,3-butanediol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, isoprene glycol, and sorbitol. Examples of the lower alkyl ethers of the polyols include a mono- lower alkyl ether and a poly- lower alkyl ether (e.g. di- lower alkyl ether) of the polyol.

[0091]<br>
The content of the nonvolatile hydrophilic solvent in the liquid mixture of the first and second parts is preferably 0.01 to 4% by mass, more preferably 0.1 to 3% by mass, and even more preferably 0.2 to 2% by mass in order to decrease the irritation to the scalp and to obtain the quality foam at a lower temperature.<br>
[0092] <dye><br>
The two-part hair dye of the present invention can be used for bleaching the hair, when the liquid mixture of the first and second parts does not contain a dye, and<br>
used for dyeing the hair, when the liquid mixture contains an oxidation dye or a direct dye.  For dying purpose, the first part contains the oxidation dye or the direct dye. Examples of the oxidation dye include a dye precursor, such as p-phenylenediamine, p-aminophenol, toluene-2,5-diamine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-p-phenylenediamine, 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)-p-phenylenediamine, 4-amino-3-methylphenol, 6-amino-3-methylphenol, o-aminophenol, and l-hydroxyethyl-4,5-diaminopyrazole; and a coupler, such as resorcinol, 2-methylresorcinol, m-aminophenol, p-amino-o-cresol, 5-(2-hydroxyethylamino)-2-methylphenol, m-phenylenediamine, 2,4-<br>

In order to keep the discharged foam stable for a long time, it is desirable that the two-part hair dye of the present invention does not contain a silicone in the liquid mixture of the first and second parts. However, to make the foam smooth and compatible to the hair and to impart a high conditioning effect to the hair, the liquid mixture may contain also a silicone within a certain range. Examples of the silicones include<br>
dimethylpolysiloxane, methylphenylpolysiloxane, polyether modified silicone, amino modified silicone, oxazoline<br>
modified silicone elastomer and emulsions dispersing the same in water using a surfactant. Among them, polyether modified silicone, amino modified silicone, and the emulsions thereof are preferable, because they can be dispersed in water stably without using a thickener.<br>
[0094]<br>
Polyether modified silicone includes an end-modified type and a side chain-modified type, such as a pendant<br>
(pectinate) type, a both end-modified type, a one end-modified type. Examples of the modified silicone include a dimethylsiloxane/methyl(polyoxyethylene)siloxane copolymer, a<br>
dimethylsiloxane/methyl(polyoxypropylene)siloxane copolymer, and a dimethylsiloxane/methyl(polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene)siloxane copolymer. The HLB of the polyether modified silicone is preferably 10 or higher, more preferably 10 to 18, in view of compatibility with water. Thereby the HLB values are to be determined by the phenol index (the phenol index is an index correlated with HLB, applicable to an ether type nonionic surfactant).<br>
[0095]<br>
Although the amino modified silicone having an amino group or an ammonium group is usable, amodimethicone is preferred.<br>
[0096]<br>
If the silicone is added in the liquid mixture of the first and second parts, the content thereof is<br>
preferably 2% by mass or less, more preferably 0.005 to 1% by mass, and even more preferably 0.01 to 0.5% by mass in order not to interfere with foaming, and to make the foam smooth and compatible to the hair, and to impart a high conditioning effect to the hair.<br>
[0097]<br><other components><br>
The first part and the second part may contain as necessary a perfume, a UV absorber, a metal chelating agent such as edetic acid, an antibacterial agent, an antiseptic agent such as methyl-p-hydroxybenzoate, a stabilizer, such as phenacetin, etidronic acid, or oxyquinoline sulfate, an organic solvent, such as ethanol, benzyl alcohol, or benzyloxy ethanol, a water-soluble polymer such as hydroxyethyl cellulose, and a humectant. The liquid mixture of the first and second parts contains preferably a medium composed mainly of water.<br>
[0098]<br>
Further, a persulfate such as ammonium persulfate may be added in the liquid mixture as the third part in order to improve the bleaching activity.<br>
[0099] <viscosity><br>
The viscosity (25°C) of the first part is preferably 1 to 50 mPa-s, more preferably 3 to 40 mPa-s, and even more preferably 5 to 30 mPa-s.  The viscosity (25°C) of the second part is preferably 1 to 300 mPa-s, more preferably 3 to 2 00 mPa-s, and even more preferably 5 to<br>
100 mPa-s. The viscosity (25°C) of the liquid mixture of the first and second parts is preferably 1 to 3 00 mPa-s, more preferably 1 to 100 mPa-s, even more preferably 3 to 100 mPa-s, even more preferably 3 to 80 mPa-s, even more preferably 3 to 50 mPa-s, even more preferably 5 to 50 mPa-s, even more preferably 5 to 3 0 mPa-s, and even more preferably 10 to 3 0 mPa-s. The viscosity is measured by a B-type rotational viscometer (Model TV-10 from Tokimec Inc.) using a rotor No. 1 which is rotated for 1 min. before the measurement.  If the viscosities of subjects to be measured are 10 0 mPa-s or below, between 10 0 and 200 mPa-s or between 200 and 50 0 mPa-s, the measurement is conducted at the rotation speeds of 60 rpm, 30 rpm, and 12 rpm, respectively. By adjusting the viscosity of the liquid mixture in the above range, the liquid mixture can be mixed uniformly without foaming, which can form uniform foams easily applicable to the hair, compatible to the hair, and resistant to drip after the application. [0100]<br>
By adjusting the viscosity in the above range, the foam easily applicable and compatible to the hair and resistant to drip after the application to the hair can be obtained, and discharge of the foam from the non-aerosol foamer vessel becomes easy. For adjusting the viscosity within such range, a water-soluble solvent such as ethanol is added, or the contents and types of a surfactant, a polyol, or a higher alcohol should be appropriately adjusted.<br>
[0101]<br><air mixing ratio></air>
The air/liquid mixing ratio (air/the liquid mixture) of the foam discharged from the foamer vessel is preferably 10 to 50 mL/g, more preferably 15 to 40 mL/g, and even more preferably 2 0 to 3 0 mL/g in view of compatibility and easy applicability of the foam to the hair. Thereby the air/liquid mixing ratio is measured as follows.<br>
[0102]<br>
The air/liquid mixing ratio is determined by measuring the mass and the volume of the foam discharged at 25°C.  In the foamer vessel 100 g of the liquid mixture is poured and 20 g of foam is discharged into a 1,000 mL-measuring cylinder and the volume thereof is measured 1 min. after the start of discharging. The discharged foam volume (mL) is divided by the mass of 20 g to give the air/liquid mixing ratio (mL/g).<br>
[0103]<br><foamer vessel><br>
The foamer vessel of the present invention is a non-aerosol vessel that discharges in the form of foam the two-part hair dye by mixing it with air without using a propellant. Moreover, with the use of the foamer vessel, spattering of the discharged dye can be prevented. A non-aerosol vessel can be produced at a lower cost compared with an aerosol vessel, can be regulated easily for the discharging speed, is recyclable with certain<br>
treatment, and can be handled safely during the product distribution because a high pressure propellant gas is not involved. [0104]<br>
As the foamer vessel, any non-aerosol vessel with a foam discharging means, such as a pump foamer vessel and a squeeze foamer vessel publicly known and having a foam discharging means, can be used. [0105]<br>
The pump foamer or squeeze foamer vessel has a foam generating part such as a net, whose thickness is preferably thin so that clogging caused by the dried-up liquid mixture of the first and second parts can be immediately removed at the next discharge by the foam flow dissolving the clogged sold. Thereby the mesh size of the net is preferably 50 to 280 mesh, more preferably 90 to 250 mesh, and even more preferably 13 0 to 22 0 mesh. By use of the net with such mesh size, creamy foam can be generated. Preferable examples of a material for the net include nylon, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, Teflon (registered trade name), carbon fibers, and stainless steel.  More preferable are nylon, polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyester, and even more preferable is nylon. [0106]<br>
The foamer vessel to be used for the two-part hair dye of the present invention is provided with at least one of such net, preferably a plurality of the same, and<br>
more preferably 2 of the same in view of economy and stability of the foam. Thereby the mesh size of the net that the liquid first passes is coarser than or same as the net passed next.<br>
[0107]<br>
A part of the foamer vessel that contacts the content (e.g. the inner wall of the vessel, the inner wall of the foaming discharging means) is preferably composed of a material that is not corroded by alkali or hydrogen peroxide, and is permeable to oxygen generated by decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide.<br>
[0108]<br>
As a product form of the two-part hair dye of the present invention composed of the first part, the second part and the foamer vessel, the first part and the second part may be filled in respective vessels separated from the foamer vessel and they are transferred to the foamer vessel before use to be mixed, or either part may be filled in the foamer vessel, while the other part is packaged in a separate vessel, which is transferred to the foamer vessel before use. Thereby the second part is preferably filled in the foamer vessel constituted of a vessel with gas permeability so that the increase of the vessel inner pressure by the oxygen generated by the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide can be prevented, more preferably filled in the foamer vessel constituted with a material having oxygen permeability (e.g. polypropylene and polyethylene).  In contrast, for the<br>
first part an oxygen nonpermeable vessel should be used<br>
to prevent oxidation of the oxidation dye.<br>
[0109]<br><method for dyeing hair><br>
In the method for dyeing the hair according to the present invention, the hair should preferably be combed in advance of application of the discharged foam, which suppresses the hair to tangle during a refoaming treatment and prevents the hair dye from spattering. Further, after combing the hair, the blocking procedure as commonly conducted is not required, and the omission of the blocking procedure is preferable. This makes the step of applying the hair dye to the hair and the step of refoaming described below easier. [0110]<br>
The hair to be treated by the hair dye should preferably have not been treated with a hair dressing immediately before the dyeing treatment, so that dripping is prevented, uniform dyeing and a sufficient dyeing effect can be obtained. Further the hair should be preferably dry so that the liquid mixture is not diluted, dripping is prevented, and uniform dyeing and a sufficient dyeing effect can be obtained.  If the hair is shampooed immediately before the hair dyeing treatment, the hair should be preferably dried before the dyeing treatment. Thereby drying the hair means to remove a liquid composed mainly of water attached to the hair by reason of the shampooing, to the extent that the liquid<br>
does not spontaneously drip.  Specifically, towel-drying or blow-drying is preferable.<br>
[0111]<br>
The liquid mixture of the first and second parts discharged in the form of foam is, after once receiving the same by hand or a brush, or directly, applied to the hair.  If it is received by hand, it is preferable to wear gloves. Since by the method for dyeing the hair according to the present invention, the blocking procedure as commonly conducted in applying the hair dye can be omitted, the foam can be applied quickly. Consequently, application can start at an arbitrary location of the hair, differently from the rule for a conventional liquid or creamy two-part hair dye, that the application need not start from the hair at the neckline. The application may start at a location of interest, and preferably start at the hairline or the part.<br>
[0112]<br>
It is preferable to discharge the foam approximately to a lemon size, because the size is appropriate to receive by one hand and to apply the same to the hair by the hand.  In this case, the procedure to discharge the foam is conducted by a hand, which is received by the other hand. After the once received foam is applied to the hair, the procedures of the discharge of the foam to the hand and the application thereof to the hair are repeated. This series of the procedures can be carried out very easily and quickly.<br>
[0113]<br>
The applied range of the foam may be the entirety of the hair or only a specific part thereof. [0114]<br>
Next, the applied foam is foamed up again on the hair. This refoaming may be conducted by gas injection, by use of an instrument, such as a vibrator or a brush, or by fingers, however use of fingers is preferable, because thereby the two-part hair dye can be spread also to the hair root adequately. The refoaming speed with the vibrator, the brush or the fingers should be preferably so regulated, that the foam does not splash around. [0115]<br>
Thereby the refoaming may be conducted after the foam has completely disappeared, or during the foam is disappearing, or before the applied foam starts to change. Further, it may be conducted after the foam is applied to all the intended area, or halfway in the application. The refoaming may be conducted once continuously, or intermittently repeated more than once. Thereby continuous refoaming means the vibrator, the brush or the fingers used for refoaming continue to touch a part of the hair, or retouch the same within 1 sec, even if the contact is lost once.  In short, observing the applied region, the foam should be refoamed appropriately at latest before the dripping of a liquid from the applied foam should take place. By refoaming the disappearing<br>
foam, the dripping can be prevented irrespective of the nature of the foam. Furthermore, despite of a difference in the nature of a foam caused by a difference in a structure of the foamer vessel or the composition of the two-part hair dye, the nature of the foam can be modified to that suitable for hair dyeing by the refoaming. Although it may be possible to obtain the foam maintaining stably the quality suitable for hair dyeing without dripping by selecting specifically a structure of the foamer vessel and the composition of the two-part hair dye, it is still desirable in such a case to refoam at least once as soon as possible after the completion of the application of the form. The refoaming at an earlier stage can prevent unevenness in color over the region to be applied. The timing thereof is preferably within 5 min. after the completion of the application of the discharged foam to the hair, more preferably within 3 min., and even more preferably within 1 min.. [0116]<br>
Specific examples of the preferable stepwise procedure of discharging the foam, applying the same to the hair, and refoaming will be described separately for partial dyeing and whole head dyeing. [0117] [Partial dyeing]<br>

to the whole head, the refoaming over the whole head is<br>
conducted 2 to 30 times each time for 3 sec. to 10 min.,<br>
preferably 5 sec. to 3 min., totally spending 6 sec. to<br>
20 min., preferably 10 sec. to 5 min.<br>
7)	An appropriate amount of the foam is discharged onto a brush, which is applied to a part of the hair. The procedure is repeated to apply the foam to the whole head and refoamed with the same brush over the whole head for 3 sec. to 10 min., preferably for 5 sec. to 5 min.<br>
8)	An appropriate amount of the foam is discharged onto a brush, which is applied to a part of the hair and refoamed once with the same brush or by hand over 3 sec. to 10 min., preferably for 5 sec. to 3 min. The procedure is repeated to apply the foam to the whole head. After the completion of the application to the whole head, the refoaming is conducted once with the same brush or by hand for 3 sec. to 10 min., preferably 5 sec. to 5 min.<br>
[0119]<br>
The refoaming may be conducted over the whole hair or over a limited region.  If the refoaming is conducted<br>
over the whole hair, even when the foam be failed to be applied to an unseeable part such as the hair at the back of the head, the foam can be distributed totally and an undyed area can be eliminated.  If the refoaming is carried out at a certain limited area by a partial dyeing, the border of the dyed area can be gradated to give a natural finish. Furthermore, after refoaming the distribution of the foam becomes easily seeable, and existence of an undyed part in the area to be dyed can be avoided. [0120]<br>
The foam is washed off about 3 to 6 0 min., preferably about 5 to 4 5 min. after the completion of the application thereof. Thereby the time after the completion of the application of the form is the total required time from the completion of the application of the foam to the whole head or the intended area, until the washing, namely a concept including the time for being left on the hair as well as the time required for refoaming. Thereafter the hair is appropriately shampooed, rinsed, washed with water and dried.<br>
[Examples] [0121] Examples 1 to 12 and Comparative Example 1<br>
The first part and the second part of each two-part hair dye according to the compositions listed in Tables 1 to 3 were prepared, and 40 g of the first part and 60 g<br>
of the second part were filled in a squeeze foamer vessel (Daiwa Can Co., internal volume: 150 mL, mesh size: 150 mesh (mixing chamber side), 200 mesh (discharge port side), material: nylon (both)) and mixed.<br>
Comparative evaluations between the two-part hair dyes in the form of foam of Examples 1 to 12, and Comparative Example 1 on "applicability of the foam" and "compatibility of the foam" were carried out by 10 test subjects as follows: To the wig of the same hairstyle with the hair cut on the chin line (Beaulax Co., Ltd., No. 775S) , the subjects were asked to carry out the following application procedure starting from the dry state of the hair, with the respective two-part hair dyes in the form of foam. [0122]<br>
1.	To the vessel of the squeeze foamer containing<br>
60 g of the second part, 40 g of the first part was added, and the liquid mixture of the first and second parts is mixed avoiding foaming and the squeeze foamer is mounted.<br>
2.	After wearing gloves, the squeeze vessel standing upright is squeezed by one hand to discharge the liquid mixture in the form of foam onto the palm of the other hand.<br>
3.	The liquid mixture in the form of foam is applied to the dry hair.<br>
4.	Repeating the steps 2 and 3, 80 g of the liquid mixture is applied to the whole hair.<br>
5.	The applied liquid mixture is refoamed by-massaging the whole hair with fingers for 15 sec.<br>
6.	Leave it for 10 min.<br>
7.	The applied liquid mixture is refoamed by-massaging the whole hair with fingers for 25 sec.<br>
8.	After the completion of the refoaming according to the step 7, leave it for 20 min.<br>
9.	The whole hair is washed with warm water, followed by shampooing, rinsing and drying successively. [0123]<br>
The rating points are defined as below relative to Comparative Example 1 as the bench mark (containing Na laureth sulfate as an anionic surfactant, as in the example of Patent Document 1), and the sums of the rated points are shown also in Tables 1 to 3. [0124] [Rating points]<br>

Furthermore, each mixture of the first part and the second part at the ratio by mass of 1:1.5 was applied to each goat hair tress (10 cm, about 1 g, from Beaulax Co., Ltd.) at the bath ratio of 1:1, left thereon for 3 0 min., and then washed with water and shampooed. After drying, the color of the tress was measured by a colorimeter (CR400 from Konica Minolta Sensing Inc.) and the "dyeability" was evaluated by the color difference (AE) from that of the goat hair tress before dyeing. The average value of the evaluation results (N = 3) was used for comparison. [0127] [Table 1]  (Table Removed) <br>
