				<td>Description<br>
Engine Lubrication System<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an engine lubrication<br>
system and more particularly to an engine lubrication system<br>
adapted to effectively perform the lubrication of a transmission<br>
disposed within a crankcase with a simple construction.<br>
Background Art<br>
Conventionally, as an engine lubrication system, there<br>
exists an engine lubrication system in which an oil supply<br>
passageway is formed in a main shaft and a drive shaft of a<br>
transmission, respectively, lubricating oil is supplied into<br>
the oil supply passageways by a lubricating oil pump and the<br>
lubricating oil so supplied is then supplied to sliding surfaces<br>
of the shafts over which change-speed gears slide from branch<br>
holes formed in the main shaft and the drive shaft, whereby<br>
the sliding surfaces are lubricated.<br>
Incidentally, in lubricating the transmission, while it<br>
is important to lubricate meshing surfaces of the change-speed<br>
gears, conventionally, it is a generally adoptedmethod in which<br>
part of the change-speed gears is submerged in lubricating oil<br>
stored within a transmission case, whereby the meshing surfaces<br>
are lubricated.<br>
In the method in which lubricating oil is stored within<br>
the transmission case, however, a resistance generated when<br>
the change-speed gears stir the lubricationoil cannot be ignored,<br>
and there is also caused a problem that the deterioration of<br>
lubricating oil is promoted.<br>
Then, as is described in, for example, JP-B-6-27494, there<br>
is provided an engine lubrication system in which lubricating<br>
oil is supplied directly to meshing surfaces of the change-speed,<br>
gears. In this related art, a main shaft 13 and a drive shaft<br>
14 are disposed on separate mating surfaces of a crankcase 1<br>
which is divided vertically into an upper case 2 and a lower<br>
case 3, a by-pass tube 36 for establishing communication between<br>
lubricating oil passageways 34 and 35 which are formed in axial<br>
side walls is arranged in parallel with the main shaft and the<br>
like in the upper case 2, and an injection port 38 is formed<br>
in the by-pass tube 36 for supplying lubricating oil to groups<br>
of change-speed gears.<br>
In this related art described in the Japanese Examined<br>
Patent Publication, however, since a construction is adopted<br>
in which the by-pass tube 36 constituted by a separate part<br>
is disposed, the number of parts is increased by the addition<br>
of the by-pass tube 36, and a space where the by-pass tube 36<br>
is disposed needs to be secured, leading to a possibility that<br>
the enlargement of the crankcase is called for. Furthermore,<br>
since a construction is adopted in which the by-pass tube 36<br>
is inserted from the outside of the crankcase into the upper<br>
case 2, sealing needs to be provided between the by-pass tube<br>
36 and an insertion hole, resulting in a problem that the<br>
construction is made complex.<br>
The invention was made in view of the problems inherent<br>
in the related art and an object thereof is to provide an engine<br>
lubrication system which can implement the lubrication of<br>
meshing portions of change-speed gears of a transmission easily<br>
and securely without causing the problems that the construction<br>
is made complex and that the number of parts is increased.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, an embodiment of the invention will be<br>
described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figs. 1 to 21 are drawings for describing an embodiment<br>
of the invention. In the drawings, reference numeral 1 denotes<br>
a water-cooled, 4-cycle, single cylinder, 5-valve engine, and<br>
in general, the engine has a construction in which a cylinder<br>
body 3, a cylinder head 4 and a cylinder head cover 5 are stacked<br>
on and fastened to a crankcase 2, and a piston 6 slidably disposed<br>
in a cylinder bore 3a in the cylinder body 3 is connected to<br>
a crankshaft 8 via a connecting rod 7.<br>
The cylinder body 3 and the crankcase 2 are securely<br>
connected together by screwing four case bolts 30a which pass<br>
through a lower flange portion (a case side flange portion)<br>
3b into a cylinder side mating surface 2e of the crankcase 2.<br>
To be more specific, the case bolts 30a are screwed into bolt<br>
connectingportions (connectingbossportions) 12c of iron alloy<br>
bearing brackets 12, 12' (which will be described later on)<br>
embedded in left and right wall portions of the aluminum alloy<br>
crankcase 2, respectively, through insert casting. Note that<br>
reference numeral 31a denotes a positioning dowel pin for<br>
positioning the crankcase 2 and the cylinder body 3.<br>
In addition, the cylinder body 3 and the cylinder head<br>
4 are connected together with two short head bolts 30b and four<br>
long head bolts 30c. The short head bolt 30b is screwed to<br>
be planted in a portion below an induction port 4c and a portion<br>
below an exhaust port in the cylinder head 4, extends downwardly<br>
to pass through an upper flange portion 3f of the cylinder block<br>
3 and protrudes downwardly therefrom. Then, a cap nut 32a is<br>
screwed on the downwardly protruding portion of the short head<br>
bolt 30b, whereby the upper flange portion 3f and hence the<br>
cylinder body 3 are fastened to a cylinder side mating surface<br>
4a of the cylinder head 4.<br>
In addition, the longheadbolt 30c is screwed to be planted<br>
in the lower flange portion 3b of the cylinder body 3, extends<br>
upwardly to pass from the upper flange portion 3f of the cylinder<br>
block 3 through a flange portion 4b of the cylinder head 4 and<br>
protrudes upwardly therefrom. Then, a cap nut 32b is screwed<br>
on the upwardly protruding portion of the long head bolt 30c,<br>
whereby the lower flange portion 3b and hence the cylinder body<br>
are fastened to the cylinder side mating surface 4a of the<br>
cylinder head 4.<br>
Thus, in connecting the cylinder body 3 and the cylinder<br>
head 4 together, since not only the upper flange portion 3f<br>
of the cylinder body 3 is fastened to be fixed to the cylinder<br>
head 4 with the short head bolts 30b and the cap nuts 32 but<br>
also the long head bolts 30c are planted in the lower flange<br>
portion 3b which is fastened to be securely connected to the<br>
mating surface 2e of the crankcase 2, so that the cylinder body<br>
3 is fastened to be fixed to the flange portion 4b of the cylinder<br>
head 4 with the long head bolts 30c and the cap nuts 32b, a<br>
tensile load generated by a combustion pressure comes to be<br>
borne by the cylinder body 3 and the four long head bolts 30c,<br>
so that a load applied to the cylinder body 3 can be reduced<br>
accordingly or by such an extent that the load is so borne by<br>
the cylinder body 3 and the long head bolts 30c. As a result,<br>
a stress generated at, in particular, an axially intermediate<br>
portion of the cylinder body 3 can be reduced, thereby making<br>
it possible to secure a required durability even in case the<br>
thickness of the cylinder body 3 is reduced.<br>
Incidentally, in the event that only the upper flange<br>
portion 3f of the cylinder body 3 is connected to the cylinder<br>
head 4, an excessively large tensile stress is generated at<br>
the axially intermediate portion of the cylinder body 3, and<br>
in an extreme case, there occurs a concern that a crack is<br>
generated at the portion in question. In the embodiment,<br>
however, the generation of the excessively large stress at the<br>
intermediate portion of the cylinder body can be avoided due<br>
to the presence of the long head bolts 30c, thereby making it<br>
possible to prevent the generation of a crack.<br>
In addition, in planting the long head bolts 30c in the<br>
lower flange portion 3b, since the long head bolts are disposed<br>
in the vicinity of the crankcase fastening case bolts 30a,<br>
respectively, the load generated by the combustion pressure<br>
can be transmitted from the cylinder head 4 to the crankcase<br>
2 via the long head bolts 30c and the cylinder body in an ensured<br>
fashion, thereby making it possible to improve the durability<br>
against the load in this respect.<br>
Here, the right-side bearing bracket 12' has, as shown<br>
in Figs. 5, 16, a boss portion 12b in which the right-side bearing<br>
lla' of the crankshaft 8 is inserted to be fitted in the bearing<br>
hole 12a through press fit. Then, the bolt connecting portions<br>
12c, 12c extend upwardly from front and rear portions which<br>
hold the crankshaft 8 therebetween as seen in a direction in<br>
which the crankshaft 8 extends to the vicinity of the<br>
cylinder-side mating surface of the crankcase 2.<br>
In addition, in the left-side bearing bracket 12, as shown<br>
in Figs. 5, 17, the bolt connecting portions 12c, 12c extend<br>
from front and rear portions which hold the crankshaft 8<br>
therebetween as seen in the direction in which the crankshaft<br>
8 extends to the vicinity of the cylinder-side mating surface<br>
2e of the crankcase 2. In addition, a collar hole 12e is formed<br>
in the boss portion 12b into which an iron bearing collar 12d<br>
having an outside diameter larger than that of a balancer driving<br>
gear 25a, which will be described, later on, is press fitted.<br>
And, a left-side crankshaft bearing lla is inserted to be fitted<br>
in the bearing hole 12a of the bearing collar 12d.<br>
Here, the bearing collar 12d is provided to facilitate<br>
the assembly of the crankshaft 8 in the crankcase 2 with a gear<br>
unit 25 having the balancer driving gear 25a being press fitted<br>
on the crankshaft 8.<br>
In addition, as shown in Fig. 5, a seal plate 25d is<br>
interposed between the gear unit 25 on a left shaft portion<br>
8c of the crankshaft 8 and the bearing lla. An inside diameter<br>
side portion of the seal plate 25d is held by the gear unit<br>
25 and an inner race of the bearing lla, and a slight gap is<br>
provided between an outside diameter side portion thereof and<br>
an outer race of the bearing lla for avoiding the interference<br>
therebetween. In addition, an inner circumferential surface<br>
of a flange portion 12h of the bearing collar 12d is brought<br>
into sliding contact with an outer circumferential surface of<br>
the seal plate 25d.<br>
Furthermore, a seal tube 17i is interposed between the<br>
bearing lla' of a right shaft portion 8c' of the crankshaft<br>
8 and a cover plate 17g. An inner circumferential surface of<br>
the seal tube 17i is fixedly fitted on the right shaft portion<br>
8c'. In addition, a seal groove having a labyrinth construction<br>
is formed in an outer circumferential surface of the seal tube<br>
17i, and the outer circumferential surface of the seal tube<br>
17 i is brought into sliding contact with an inner circumferential<br>
surface of a seal bore 2p formed in the right case portion 2b.<br>
Thus, the leakage of pressure within a crank compartment<br>
2c is prevented by interposing the seal plate 25d and the seal<br>
tube 17i on the outside of the bearings lla, lla' of the left-<br>
and right-side bearing portions 8c, 8c' of the crankshaft 8,<br>
respectively.<br>
Thus, according to the embodiment, since the bolt<br>
connecting portions (connecting boss portion) 12c, 12c which<br>
extend toward the cylinder body 3 side are formed integrally<br>
on the both sides across a cylinder bore axis A of each of the<br>
crankshaft supporting bearing members 12, 12' of an iron alloy<br>
which are cast in the crankcase 2 of an aluminum alloy and the<br>
case bolt 30a for connecting the cylinder body 3 to the crankcase<br>
2 is screwed into the bolt connecting portion 12c, the load<br>
due to the combustion pressure can uniformly borne by the two<br>
front and rear bolt connecting portions 12c which are disposed<br>
across the cylinder bore axis A, thereby making it possible<br>
to increase the connecting rigidity between the cylinder body<br>
3 and the crankcase 2.<br>
In addition, since the balance shafts 22, 22' , which are<br>
disposed in the vicinity of the crankshaft 8 in parallel<br>
therewith, are supported by the iron alloy bearing members 12,<br>
12' at at least one end portions thereof, the supporting rigidity<br>
of the balance shafts 22, 22' can be enhanced.<br>
Furthermore, since the upper end faces 12f the bolt<br>
connecting portions 12c are positioned inwardly of each of the<br>
iron alloy bearing brackets 12, 12' so that the upper end faces<br>
12f are not exposed to the cylinder-side mating surface 2e of<br>
the crankcase 2 in embedding the iron alloy bearing brackets<br>
12, 12' in the interior of the crankcase 2, there is no case<br>
where metallic members which are different in hardness and<br>
material exist at the joint between the crankcase 2 and the<br>
cylinder block 3 in an mixed fashion, and hence the reduction<br>
in sealing capability can be avoided. Namely, in the event<br>
that the upper end face 12f of the iron alloy bolt connecting<br>
portion 12c is brought into abutment with the case-side mating<br>
surface 3c formed on the lower flange 3b of the aluminum alloy<br>
cylinder body 3, the sealing capability is lowered due to the<br>
difference in thermal expansion coefficient or the like.<br>
In addition, since, in the left-side bearing bracket 12,<br>
the bearing collar 12d whose outside diameter is larger than<br>
balancer driving gear 25a ismountedon the outer circumferential<br>
surface of the bearing lla, when assembling the crankshaft 8<br>
in the crankcase 2 with the balancer driving gear 25a being<br>
mounted by way of press fit or the like to be fixed thereto<br>
(or, there is, of course, no problem even in the event that<br>
the gear 25a is formed as an integral part of the crankshaft<br>
8) , there is no risk that the balancer driving gear 2 5a interferes<br>
with a smallest inside diameter portion of the boss portion<br>
12b of the bearing bracket 12, and hence the crankshaft 8 can<br>
be assembled properly without any problem.<br>
The crankcase 2 is a two-piece type in which the crankcase<br>
2 is divided into the left and right case portions 2a, 2b. A<br>
left case cover 9 is detachably attached to the left case portion<br>
2a, and a space surrounded by the left case portion 2a and the<br>
left case cover 9 constitutes a flywheel magnet compartment<br>
9a. A flywheel magnetic generator 35 attached to the left end<br>
portion of the crankshaft 8 is accommodated in this flywheel<br>
magnet compartment 9a. Note that the flywheel magnet<br>
compartment 9a communicates with a camshaft arranging<br>
compartment via chain compartments 3d, 4d, which will be<br>
described later on, whereby most of the lubricating oil which<br>
has been used to lubricate camshafts falls into the flywheel<br>
magnet compartment 9a via the chain compartments 3d, 4d.<br>
In addition, a right case ccver 10 is detachably attached<br>
to the right case portion 2b, and a space surrounded by the<br>
right case portion 2b and the right case cover 10 constitutes<br>
a clutch compartment 10a.<br>
The crank compartment 2c and a transmission compartment<br>
2d are formed at front and rear portions of the crankcase 2,<br>
respectively. The crank compartment 2c is made to open to the<br>
cylinder bore 3a but is defined substantially to be separated<br>
from the other compartments such as the transmission compartment<br>
2d. Due to this, the pressure within the transmission<br>
compartment 2d is caused to fluctuate as the piston reciprocates<br>
vertically, thereby allowing the transmission compartment 2d<br>
to function as a pump.<br>
The crankshaft 8 is arranged such that left and right<br>
arm portions 8a, 8a and left and right weight portions thereof<br>
are accommodated in the crank compartment 2c. The crankshaft<br>
8 is an assembly including a left crankshaft portion into which<br>
the left arm portion 8a, weight portion 8b and shaft portion<br>
8c are integrated and a right crankshaft portion into which<br>
the right arm portion 8a, weight portion 8b and shaft portion<br>
8c' are integrated, the left crankshaft portion and the right<br>
crankshaft portion being connected integrally through a tubular<br>
crank pin 8d.<br>
The left and right shaft portions 8c, 8c' are rotationally<br>
supported on the left and right case portions 2a, 2b via the<br>
crankshaft bearings lla, lla' . 7^.s has been described above,<br>
the bearings lla, lla' are press fitted in the bearing holes<br>
12a in the iron alloy bearing brackets 12, 12' which are insert<br>
cast in the left and right case portions 2a, 2b of aluminum<br>
alloy.<br>
A transmission 13 is accommodated and arranged in the<br>
transmission compartment 2d. The transmission 13 is such as<br>
to have a constant mesh construction in which a main shaft 14<br>
and a drive shaft 15 are provided and arranged in parallel with<br>
the crankshaft 8, and first-speed to fifth-speed gears 1p to<br>
5p attached to the main shaft 14 are made to constantly mesh<br>
with first-speed to fifth-speed gears 1w to 5w attached to the<br>
drive shaft 15.<br>
The main shaft 14 is rotationally supported by the left<br>
and right case portions 2a, 2b via main shaft bearings 11b,<br>
11b, whereas the drive shaft 15 is rotationally supported by<br>
the left and right case portions 2a, 2b via drive shaft bearings<br>
lie, lie.<br>
A right end portion of the main shaft 14 passes through<br>
the right case portion 2b and protrudes to the right side, and<br>
a clutch mechanism 16 is attached to the protruding portion,<br>
and this clutch mechanism 16 is located within the clutch<br>
compartment 10a. Then, a large reduction gear (an input gear)<br>
16a of the clutch mechanism 16 meshes with a small reduction<br>
gear 17 fixedly attached to the right end portion of the<br>
crankshaft 8.<br>
A left end port ion of the drive shaft 15 protrudes outwardly<br>
from the left caseportion 2a anda driving sprocket 18 is attached<br>
to the protruding portion. This driving sprocket 18 is<br>
connected to a driven sprocket on a rear wheel.<br>
A balancer unit 19 according to the embodiment includes<br>
front and rear balancers 20, 20' disposed opposite across the<br>
crankshaft 8 and having substantially the same construction.<br>
The front and rear balancers 20, 20' include the balance shaft<br>
22, 22' which do not rotate and weights 24, 24 which are<br>
rotationally supported on the balance shat via bearings 23,<br>
23.<br>
Here, the balance shafts 22, 22' are made to double as<br>
the case bolts (the connecting bolts) for connecting the left<br>
and right case portions 2a, 2b together in the direction in<br>
which the crankshaft extends. The respective balance shafts<br>
22, 22' is also used to connect the left and right case portions<br>
together by causing flange portions 22a formed on insides of<br>
the rotationally supported weights 24 in a transverse direction<br>
of the engine to abut with outer end faces of boss portions<br>
12g integrally formed on the bearing brackets 12', 12 which<br>
are insert cast into the left and right case portions 2a, 2b<br>
and screwing fixing nuts 21a, 21b on opposite ends of the<br>
respective balance shafts.<br>
The weight 24 includes a semi-circular weight main body<br>
24a and a circular gear supporting portion 24b which is<br>
integrally formed on the weight main body, and a ring-shaped<br>
balancer driven gear 24c is fixedly attached to the gear<br>
supporting portion 24b. Note that reference numeral 24b<br>
denotes a hole made in a part of the weight 24 which is situated<br>
opposite to the weight main body 24a so as to reduce the weight<br>
of the part to as low a level as possible.<br>
The balancer driven gear 24c attached to the rear balancer<br>
20' meshes with the balancer driving gear 25a which is<br>
rotationally attached relative to the gear unit 25 which is<br>
securely attached to the left shaft portion 8c of the crankcase<br>
8 through press fit.<br>
Note that reference numeral 25b denotes a timing chain<br>
driving sprocket integrally formed on the gear unit 15 and has,<br>
as shown in Fig. 11, an aligning or timingmark 25c for alignment<br>
of timing marks for valve timing. The gear unit 25 is press<br>
fitted on the crankshaft 8 such that the timing mark 25c aligns<br>
with the cylinder bore axis A as viewed in the direction in<br>
which the crankshaft extends when the crankshaft 8 is situated<br>
at a top dead center of a compression stroke.<br>
In addition, the balancer driven gear 24c attached to<br>
the front balancer 20 meshes with a balancer driving gear 17a<br>
which is supported rotationally relative to the small reduction<br>
gear 17 which is fixedly attached to the right shaft portion<br>
8c' of the crankshaft 8.<br>
Here, the rear balancer driving gear 25a is supported<br>
rotationally relative to the gear unit 25, and the front balancer<br>
driving gear 17a is supported rotationally relative to the small<br>
reduction gear 17. Then, U-shaped damper springs 33 each made<br>
up of a plate spring are interposed between the balancer driving<br>
gears 25a, 17a and the gear unit 25 and the small reduction<br>
gear 17, respectively, to thereby restrain the transmission<br>
of impact generated due to a torque fluctuation occurring in<br>
the engine to the balancers 20, 20' is restrained from being<br>
transmitted.<br>
Here, while the balancer driving gear 17a for driving<br>
the front balancer 20 will be described in detail by reference<br>
to Fig. 14, the same description would be given if the balancer<br>
driving gear 25a for driving the rear balancer were described.<br>
The balancer driving gear 17a is formed into a ring shape and<br>
is supported by a sliding surface 17b formed so as to have a<br>
smaller diameter than the small reduction gear 17 rotationally<br>
relative to a side of the small reduction gear 17. Then, a<br>
number of U-shaped spring retaining grooves 17c are formed in<br>
the sliding surface 17b by setting them back into the surface<br>
thereof in a radial fashion about the center of the crankshaft,<br>
and the U-shaped damper springs 33 are arranged to be inserted<br>
in place within the spring retaining grooves 17c. Opening side<br>
end portions 33a, 33a of the damper spring 33 are locked at<br>
front and rear stepped portions formed in a locking recessed<br>
portion 17d formed in an inner circumferential surface of the<br>
balancer driving gear 17a.<br>
When a relative rotation is generated between the small<br>
reduction gear 17 and the balancer driving gear 17a due to a<br>
torque fluctuation, the damper springs 33 resiliently deform<br>
in a direction in which the space between the end portions 33a,<br>
33a narrows so as to absorb the torc[ue fluctuation so generated.<br>
Note that reference numeral 17g denotes a cover plate for<br>
retaining the damper springs 33 within the retaining grooves<br>
17c, reference numeral 17h denotes a key for connecting the<br>
small reduction gear 1 with the crankshaft 8, and reference<br>
numerals 17e, 17f denote, respectively, alignment marks for<br>
use in assembling the small reduction gear 17 and the balancer<br>
driving gear 17a.<br>
Amechanism for adjusting a backlash between the balancer<br>
driven gears 24c, 24c and the balancer driving gears 25a, 17a<br>
is provided on the balancers 20, 20'. This adjusting mechanism<br>
is constructed such that the balancer axis of the balance shaft<br>
22, 22' slightly deviates from the rotational center of the<br>
balancer driven gear 24c. Namely, when the balance shaft 22,<br>
22' is made to rotate about the balancer axis, the space between<br>
the rotational center line of the balancer driven gear 24c and<br>
the rotational center line of the balancer driving gear 25a,<br>
17a changes slightly, whereby the backlash is changed.<br>
Here, a mechanism for rotating the balance shaft 22, 22'<br>
differs between the front balancer 20 and the rear balancer<br>
20' . Firstly, in the rear balancer 20' , a hexagonal locking<br>
protruding portion 22b is formed on a left end portion of the<br>
rear balance shaft 22', and a spline-like (apolygonal star-like)<br>
locking hole 26a formed in one end of a rotational lever 26<br>
is locked on the locking protruding portion 22b. In addition,<br>
an arc-like bolt hole 26b is formed in the other end portion<br>
of the rotational lever 2 6 in such a manner as to extend about<br>
the balancer axis.<br>
A fixing bolt 27 passed through the bolt hole 2 6b is planted<br>
in a guide plate 28. The guide plate 28 is generally formed<br>
into an arc-like shape and is fixedly bolted to the crankcase<br>
2. Note that the guide plate 28 has also a function to control<br>
the flow of lubricating oil.<br>
The adjustment of the backlash of the rear balancer 20'<br>
is implemented by rotating the rotational lever 26 so as to<br>
bring the backlash to an appropriate state with the fixing nut<br>
21a being loosened and thereafter by fixing the rotational lever<br>
26 with the fixing bolt 27a and a fixing nut 27b, and thereafter,<br>
the fixing nut 21a is refastened,<br>
A grip portion 22f having an oval cross section, which<br>
is formed by forming a flat portion 22e on both sides of a<br>
cross-sectionally circular shape, is formedona left endportion<br>
of the front balance shaft 22 (refer to Fig. 12). A collar<br>
29a having an inner circumferential shape which matches an outer<br>
circumferential shape of the grip portion 22f is attached to<br>
the grip portion 22f, and furthermore, a holding portion 29b<br>
of a holding lever 29 is attached to an outside of the collar<br>
29a in such a manner as to move axially but as not to rotate<br>
relatively. A distal end portion 29e of the holding lever 29<br>
is fixed to a boss portion 2f of the left case portion 2a with<br>
a bolt 29f. In addition, a tightening slit 29c is formed in<br>
the holding portion 29b of the holding lever 29, so that the<br>
rotation of the collar 29 and hence of the balance shaft 22<br>
is prevented by tightening up the fixing bolt 29d. Furthermore,<br>
the fixing nut 21b is screwed on the balance shaft 22 to an<br>
outer side of the collar 29 so as to be secured thereto via<br>
washer.<br>
The adjustment of the backlash of the front balancer 20<br>
is implemented by loosening the fixing nut 21b or preferably<br>
removing the same, griping the grip portion 22f of the balance<br>
shaft 22 with a tool to rotate the shaft so as to bring the<br>
backlash to an appropriate state, and thereafter tightening<br>
up the fixing bolt 29d, and thereafter, the fixing nut 21b is<br>
fastened.<br>
In addition, a lubricating oil introducing portion 22c<br>
is formed in an upper portion of the locking protruding portion<br>
22b by cutting out the upper in an arc. A guide bore 22d is<br>
made to open to the introducing portion 22c, and the guide bore<br>
extends into the balance shaft 22 and passes therethrough to<br>
below an outer circumferential surface of the balance shaft<br>
22, whereby the lubricating oil introducing portion 22c is made<br>
to communicate with an inner circumferential surface of the<br>
balancer bearing 23. Thus, lubricating oil that has fallen<br>
in the lubricating oil introducing portion 22c is supplied to<br>
the balancer bearing 23.<br>
Here, while the weight 24 and the balancer driven gear<br>
24c are disposed at the right end portion along the direction<br>
in which the crankshaft extends in the front balancer 20, in<br>
the rear balancer 20' , they are disposed at the left end portion.<br>
In addition, the balancer driven gear 24c is located rightward<br>
relative to the weight 24 in both the front and rear balancers<br>
20, 20', and therefore, the weight. 24 and the balancer driven<br>
gear 24c are set into the same configuration in both the front<br>
and rear balancers.<br>
Thus, according to the embodiment, since the weight main<br>
body 24a and the balancer driven gear 24c of the balancer 20<br>
are disposed on the right-hand side (one side) of the front<br>
balance shaft (the primary balance shaft) 22 along the direction<br>
in which the crankshaft extends and the weight main body 24a<br>
and the balancer driven gear 24c are disposed on the left-hand<br>
side (the other side) of the rear balance shaft (the secondary<br>
balance shaft) 22' along the direction in which the crankshaft<br>
extends, the reduction in balance in weight in the crankshaft<br>
direction that would result when providing a two-shaft balancer<br>
unit can be avoided.<br>
In addition, since the front and rear balance shafts 22,<br>
22' are made to double as the case bolts for connecting the<br>
left and right case portions 2a, 2b together, when adopting<br>
a two-shaft balancer unit, the connecting rigidity of the<br>
crankcase can be enhanced while restraining the construction<br>
of the engine from becoming complex and the number of components<br>
from being increased.<br>
Additionally, since the balancer weight main body 24a<br>
and the balancer driven gear 24c are made integral and are<br>
supported rotationally by the balance shafts 22, 22',<br>
respectively, only the weight made up of the balancer weight<br>
main body 24a and the balancer driven gear 24c may be driven<br>
to rotate, and therefore, the engine output can be attempted<br>
to be used effectively to such an extent that the balance shafts<br>
themselves do not need to be driven to rotate.<br>
In addition, the degree of freedom in assembling can be<br>
improved when compared with an engine construction in which<br>
a balancer weight and a balance shaft are made integral.<br>
Additionally, since the rotational center lines of the<br>
balancer driven gears 24c are caused to deviate relative to<br>
the axes of the balance shafts 22, 22', the backlash between<br>
the balancer driven gears 24c and the balancer driving gears<br>
25a, 27a on the crankshaft 8 side can be adjusted by the simple<br>
construction or only by a simple operation of rotating the<br>
balance shafts, thereby making it possible to prevent the<br>
generation of noise.<br>
On the front balance shaft 22, the backlash adjustment<br>
is implemented by gripping the grip portion 22f formed on the<br>
left-hand side of the balance shaft 22 with a tool so as to<br>
rotate the balance shaft 22, and on the rear balance shaft 22',<br>
the backlash adjustment is implemented by rotating the<br>
rotational lever 2 6 provided on the left-hand side of the balance<br>
shaft 22' . Thus, on either of the front and rear balance shafts<br>
22, 22', the backlash can be adjusted from the left-hand side<br>
of the engine, and hence the backlash adjusting work can be<br>
implemented efficiently.<br>
Additionally, since the balancer driving gear 17a on the<br>
crankshaft 8 side which meshes with the balancer driven gear<br>
24c is constructed to be disposed in such a manner as to rotate<br>
relatively to the sliding surface 17b of the small reduction<br>
gear 17 which is fixed to the crankshaft 8 and the U-shaped<br>
damper springs 33 are disposed in the spring retaining grooves<br>
17c formed by setting them back from the sliding surface 17b,<br>
the impact generated due to the torque fluctuation in the engine<br>
can be absorbed by the compact construction so that the balancer<br>
unit can be operated smoothly. Note that the same description<br>
can be made with respect to the balancer drive gear 25a.<br>
Furthermore, a coolant pump 48 is disposed at the right<br>
end portion of the front balance shaft 22 coaxially therewith.<br>
A rotating shaft of the coolant pump 48 is connected to the<br>
balance shaft 22 by an Oldham's coupling which has a similar<br>
construction to that of a lubricating oil pump 52, which will<br>
be described later on, in such a mariner that a slight deviation<br>
between the centers of the rotating shaft and the balance shaft<br>
22 can be absorbed.<br>
In a valve train device of the embodiment, an intake<br>
camshaft 3 6 and an exhaust camshaft 37 which are disposed within<br>
the cylinder head cover 5 are constructed to be driven to rotate<br>
by the crankshaft 8. To be specific, a crankshaft sprocket<br>
25b of the gear unit 25 press fitted on the left shaft portion<br>
8c of the crankshaft 8 so as to be attached thereto and an<br>
intermediate sprocket 38a rotationally supported by a support<br>
shaft 39 planted in the cylinder head 4 are connected by a timing<br>
chain 40, and an intermediate gear 38 formed integrally on the<br>
intermediate sprocket 38a and having a smaller diameter than<br>
that of the intermediate sprocket 38a meshes with intake and<br>
exhaust gears 41, 42 secured to end portions of the intake and<br>
the exhaust camshafts 36, 37. Note that the timing chain 40<br>
is disposed so as to pass through the chain compartments 3d,<br>
4d formed on the left walls of the cylinder block 3 and the<br>
cylinder head 4.<br>
The intermediate sprocket 38a and the intermediate gear<br>
38b are rotationally supported by the support shaft 39 which<br>
passes through the chain compartment 4d on the cylinder head<br>
4 in the direction in which the crankshaft extend along the<br>
cylinder bore axis A via two sets of needle bearings 44. The<br>
support shaft 39 is fixed at a flange portion 39a thereof to<br>
the cylinder head 4 with two bolts 39b. Note that reference<br>
numerals 39c, 39d denote a sealing gasket, respectively.<br>
Here, commercially available (standard) bearings are<br>
adopted for the two sets of needle bearings 44, 44. A space<br>
adjusting collar 4 4a is disposed between the respective bearings<br>
44, 44, and thrust washers 44b, 44b for receiving thrust load<br>
are provided at ends of the bearings. The thrust washer 44b<br>
is formed into a stepped shape having a large diameter portion<br>
which is brought into sliding contact with an end face of the<br>
intermediate sprocket and a stepped portion which protrudes<br>
axially toward the needle bearing 44.<br>
Thus, since the space adjusting collar 44a is interposed<br>
between the two sets of bearings 44, 44, commercially available<br>
standard bearings can be adopted for the needle bearings by<br>
adjusting the length of the collar 44a, thereby making it<br>
possible to reduce costs.<br>
In addition, since the washer having the stepped<br>
configuration is adopted as the thrust washer 44b, the assembling<br>
work of the intermediate sprocket 38a can be improved. Namely,<br>
in assembling the intermediate sprocket 38a, while the support<br>
shaft 39 is inserted from the outside in a state in which the<br>
intermediate sprocket 38a and the intermediate gear 38b are<br>
disposed within the chain compartment 4d with the thrust washers<br>
being positioned at the ends of the intermediate sprocket 38a<br>
and the intermediate gear 38b in such a manner as not to fall<br>
therefrom, the thrust washer 44b can be prevented from falling<br>
by allowing the stepped portion of the thrust washer 44b to<br>
be locked in a shaft hole in the intermediate sprocket 38a,<br>
and hence the assembling properties can be improved.<br>
In addition, an oil hole 39e is formed in the support<br>
shaft 39 for supplying lubricating oil introduced from the cam<br>
compartment via an oil introducing bore 4e formed in the cylinder<br>
head 4 to the needle bearing 44.<br>
Additionally, four weight reduction holes 38c and two<br>
inspection holes 38c' adapted to be used at the time of assembling<br>
and made to double as weight reduction holes are formed at<br>
intervals of 60 degrees. Then, an alignment or timing mark<br>
38d is stamped on a tooth situated substantially at the center<br>
of the inspection hole 38c' for the intermediate gear 38b, and<br>
timing marks 41a, 42a are also stamped on two teeth of intake<br>
and exhaust camshaft gears 41, 42 which correspond to the timing<br>
marks 38d. Here, when aligning the left and right timing marks<br>
38d, 38d with the timing marks 41a, 42a, the intake and exhaust<br>
camshafts gears 41, 42 are located at positions, respectively,<br>
which correspond to a top dead center of a compression stroke.<br>
Furthermore, timing marks 38e, 38e are also formed at<br>
portions of the intermediate sprocket 38a which are situated<br>
on a cover side mating surface 4f of the cylinder head 4 when<br>
the timing marks 38d align with 41a, 42a.<br>
To align valve timings, firstly, the crankshaft 8 is held<br>
at a top dead center of a compression stroke by aligning the<br>
timing mark 25c (refer to Fig.11) with the cylinder bore axis<br>
A. In addition, the intermediate sprocket 38a and the<br>
intermediate ear 38b which are attached to the cylinder head<br>
4 via the support shaft 39 are positioned so that the timing<br>
mark 38e of the intermediate sprocket 38a aligns with the cover<br>
side mating surface 4f, and in this state, the crankshaft<br>
sprocket 2 5b and the intermediate sprocket 38a are connected<br>
by the timing chain 40. Then, the intake and exhaust camshaft<br>
gears 41, 42 on the intake and exhaust camshafts 36, 37 are<br>
brought into mesh engagement with the intermediate gear 38b<br>
while confirming through the inspectionhole 38c' that the timing<br>
marks 41a, 42a align with the timing mark 38don the intermediate<br>
gear 38b, and the intake and exhaust camshafts 36, 37 are fixed<br>
to an upper surface of the cylinder head 4 via cam carriers.<br>
Thus, since the inspection holes 38c' made to double as<br>
the weight reduction holes to reduce the weight of the large<br>
diameter intermediate sprocket 38a are provided in the<br>
intermediate sprocket 38a, so that the alignment of the timing<br>
marks 38d on the small diameter intermediate gear 38b which<br>
is set on the back of the intermediate sprocket 38a with the<br>
timingmarks 41a, 42aon the camshaft gears 41, 42 canbe confirmed<br>
through the inspection holes 38c', the meshing positions of<br>
the intermediate gear 38b with the camshaft gears 41, 42 can<br>
visually confirmed in an easy and ensured fashion while the<br>
small diameter intermediate gear 38b is placed on the back of<br>
the large diameter intermediate sprocket 38a, thereby making<br>
it possible to align the valve timings without any problem.<br>
In addition, since the intermediate gear 38b can be<br>
disposed on the back side of the intermediate sprocket 38a,<br>
the dimension from the camshaft gears 41, 42 which mesh with<br>
the intermediate gear 38b to a cam nose 36a can be made shorter,<br>
whereby the torsional angle of the camshaft can be made smaller<br>
to such an extent that the dimension is made so shorter, thereby<br>
making it possible to make compact an area surrounding the<br>
camshafts.<br>
Namely, for example, in a case where the intermediate<br>
gear 38b is disposed on a front side of the intermediate sprocket<br>
38a, while the valve timings can easily be aligned, the dimension<br>
from the camshaft gears 41, 42 to the cam nose becomes long,<br>
and the torsional angle of the camshafts becomes large to such<br>
an extent that the dimension is extended, thereby reducing the<br>
control accuracy of valve opening and closing timings.<br>
In addition, in a case where the intermediate gear 38b<br>
is disposed in front of the intermediate sprocket 38a, a space<br>
between the intermediate sprocket support shaft 39 and the<br>
camshafts 36, 37 needs to be expanded in order to avoid any<br>
interference between the intermediate sprocket 38a and the<br>
camshaft 36, 37, this causing a concern that the area surrounding<br>
the camshafts is enlarged.<br>
Here, a backlash adjusting mechanism is provided between<br>
the intermediate gear 38b and the camshaft gears 41, 42. This<br>
adjusting mechanism has a construction in which the intake<br>
camshaft gear 41 and the exhaust camshaft gear 42 are made up<br>
of two gears such as a driving gear (a power transmission gear)<br>
46 and a shift gear (an adjusting gear) 45 and the angular<br>
positions of the driving gear 4 6 and the shift gear 45 can be<br>
adjusted.<br>
Namely, the shift gear 45 and the driving gear 4 6 are<br>
fixed to flange portions 36b, 37b formed at end portions of<br>
the camshafts 36, 37, respectively, in such a manner that the<br>
angular positions thereof can be adjusted by four<br>
circumferentially long elongated, holes 45a, 4 6a and four long<br>
bolts 68a. A clearance portion 46b is cut and formed in the<br>
driving gear 4 6 that is disposed, outwardly, and only the shift<br>
gear 45 is fixed in such a manner that the angular position<br>
thereof can be adjusted two elongated holes 45b and two short<br>
bolts 68b by making use of the clearance portion 46.<br>
A backlash adjustment is implemented according to the<br>
following procedure. Note that in the engine according to the<br>
embodiment, the intermediate gear 38b rotates counterclockwise<br>
as shown in Fig. 3 when viewed from the left-hand side of the<br>
engine. Consequently, both the intake camshaft gear 41 and<br>
the exhaust camshaft gear 42 rotate clockwise. In addition,<br>
here, while the backlash adjustment will be described with<br>
respect to the intake camshaft gear 41, the same description<br>
would be made with respect to the exhaust camshaft gear 42.<br>
Firstly, all the fixing bolts 68a, 68b of the intake<br>
camshaft gear 41 are loosened, and the shift gear 45 is rotated<br>
clockwise so that front side surfaces of teeth of the shift<br>
gear 45 in the clockwise direction slightly abut with rear side<br>
surfaces of teeth of the intermediate gear 38b in the<br>
counterclockwise direction. In this state, the shift gear 45<br>
is fixed to the flange portion 36b of the camshaft 36 with two<br>
short bolts 68b. Then, the driving gear 4 6 is rotated<br>
counterclockwise in such a manner that front side surfaces<br>
(driven surfaces) of teeth of the driving gear 46 in the<br>
counterclockwise direction abut with front side surfaces<br>
(driving surfaces) of the intermediate gear 38b in the<br>
counterclockwise direction so as to obtain a required backlash,<br>
and in this state, four long bolts 68a are tightened up, whereby<br>
the driving gear 4 6 and the shift gear 45 are fixed to the intake<br>
camshaft 36.<br>
Thus, since the intake and exhaust camshaft gears 41,<br>
42 are made up of the driving gear (power transmission gear)<br>
46 and the shift (adjusting gear ) 45 adapted to rotate relatively<br>
to the driving gear, respectively, the backlash can be adjusted<br>
by rotating the shift gear 45 relatively to the driving gear<br>
4 6 forward or backward in the rotating directions.<br>
Note that while, in this embodiment, both the driving<br>
gear 4 6 and the shift gear 45 which constitute the camshaft<br>
gears 41, 42 are described as being able to rotate relatively<br>
to the camshafts, one of the driving gear 46 and the shift gear<br>
45 may be adapted to rotate relatively and the other gear may<br>
be integrated into the camshaft. In this case, it is desirable<br>
that the gear integrated into the camshaft constitutes the power<br>
transmission gear. Even if constructed in this way, similar<br>
function and advantage to those obtained by the embodiment can<br>
be obtained.<br>
In addition, while in the embodiment, the invention is<br>
described as being applied to the construction in which the<br>
chain drive method is adopted, the invention can of course be<br>
applied to a drive method using a toothed belt.<br>
Next, a lubricating construction will be described.<br>
A lubrication system 50 of the engine according to the<br>
embodiment is constructed such that lubricating oil stored<br>
within a separate lubricating oil tank 51 is picked up and<br>
pressurized by a lubricating oil pump 52 via a down tube 56c<br>
on a vehicle body frame, lubricating oil discharged from the<br>
pump 52 is divided into three systems such as a cam lubricating<br>
system 53, a transmission lubricating system 54 and a crank<br>
lubricating system 55 so as to be supplied to parts needing<br>
to be lubricated at the respective systems, and lubricating<br>
oil used for lubricating the respective parts needing<br>
lubrication is returned to the lubricating oil tank 51 by making<br>
use of pressure fluctuation occurring within the crank<br>
compartment 2c as the piston 6 reciprocates vertically.<br>
The lubricating oil tank 51 is formed integrally within<br>
a space surrounded by a head pipe 56a, a main tube 56b, the<br>
down tube 56c and a reinforcement bracket 56d of the vehicle<br>
body frame 56. This lubricating oil tank 51 communicates with<br>
a cross pipe 56e which connects lower portions of the down tube<br>
56c via the down tube 56c.<br>
Then, the cross pipe 56e is connected to a pick-up port<br>
of the lubricating oil pump 52 via an outlet tube 56f connected<br>
thereto, anoilhose 57a, a jointpipe 57b and a pick-uppassageway<br>
58a formed in a crankcase cover. A discharge port of the<br>
lubricating oil pump 52 is connected to an oil filter 59 via<br>
an oil discharge passageway 58b, an external portion connecting<br>
compartment 58c and an oil passageway 58d, and is divided into<br>
three lubrication systems 53, 54,, 55 on a secondary side of<br>
the oil filter 59.<br>
The oil filter 59 is constructed such that an oil element<br>
59e is disposed in a filter compartment 59ddef inedby detachably<br>
attaching a filter cover 47 to a filter recessed portion 10b<br>
provided in the right case cover 10 by setting part thereof<br>
further back from the rest.<br>
The cam lubricating system 53 has a construction which<br>
is generally constructed such that a lower end of a vertical<br>
member 53a of a T-shaped lubricating oil pipe is connected to<br>
a cam side outlet 59a of an oil passageway formed to extend<br>
from the filter cover portion 47a to the outside of the filter<br>
recessedportion 10b, whereas left and right ends of a horizontal<br>
member 53b of the lubricating oil pipe are connected to a camshaft<br>
oil supply passageway 53c, so that lubricating oil is supplied<br>
to parts such as bearings of camshafts 36, 37 which need to<br>
be lubricated via the passageway 53c.<br>
The transmission lubricating system 54 has the following<br>
construction. A right transmission oil supply passageway 54a<br>
formed in the right case portion 2b is connected to a transmission<br>
side outlet 59b of the oil filter 59, and the right transmission<br>
oil supply passageway 54a communicates with the interior of<br>
a main shaft bore (an in-main shaft lubricating oil passageway)<br>
14a formed along the axial center of the main shaft 14 via a<br>
left transmission oil passageway 54b formed in the left case<br>
portion 2a. Then, this main shaft bore 14a communicates with<br>
sliding surfaces of the main shaft 14 and change-gears via a<br>
plurality of branch holes (lubricating oil supply holes) 14b,<br>
whereby lubricating oil supplied to the main shaft bore 14a<br>
is supplied to the sliding surfaces through the branch holes<br>
14b.<br>
In addition, a portion of the left transmission oil supply<br>
passageway 54b situated along the length thereof communicates<br>
with a bolt bore 60a into which a case bolt 60 for connecting<br>
the left and right case portions 2a, 2b together is inserted.<br>
This bolt bore 60a is constructed such that a bore having an<br>
inside diameter which is slightly larger than the outside<br>
diameter of the case bolt 60 is formed in tubular boss portions<br>
60c, 60c which are formed in such a manner as to extend inwardly<br>
from left and right side walls of the left and right case portions<br>
2a, 2b, respectively, so as to abut with each other face-to-face<br>
at mating surfaces of the left and right case portions 2a, 2b,<br>
and a gap between an inner circumferential surface of the bolt<br>
bore 60a and an outer circumferential surface of the case bolt<br>
constitutes a lubricating oil passageway.<br>
The boss portions 60c are situated above intermediate<br>
portions of the main shaft 14 and the drive shaft 15 and in<br>
the vicinity of meshing portions of gear trains on the respective<br>
shafts. In addition, an appropriate number of branch holes<br>
(lubricating oil supply holes) 60b are formed in the boss<br>
portions 60c for injecting lubricating oil in the holt hole<br>
60a toward the meshing portions or surfaces of teeth of the<br>
respective gears.<br>
Here, while, in Fig. 19, the case bolts 60 are illustrated<br>
as being deployed into both the left case portion (an upper<br>
portion in the drawing) and the right case portion (a lower<br>
portion in the drawing) , these bolts constitute the same bolt.<br>
The case bolt 60 is inserted and screwed into the case portions<br>
from the clutch compartment 10a side in such a manner that a<br>
distal threaded portion 60d thereof is not exposed to the outside<br>
from a wall portion of the left case portion 2a. In addition,<br>
a proximal head portion 60e of the case bolt 60 is situated<br>
within the clutch compartment 10a and abuts with a seat surface<br>
2b' formed on a side wall of the ::ight case portion 2b which<br>
constitutes a bulkhead of the clutch compartment 10a.<br>
Furthermore, the inside diameter of a portion of the bolt<br>
bore 60a which is immediately close to the head portion 60e<br>
is set smaller than that of the other portion of the bolt bore<br>
60a which corresponds to the lubricating oil passageway so that<br>
a gap between the portion and the case bolt 60 is reduced. In<br>
addition, a right end portion of the bolt bore 60a communicates<br>
with a drive shaft bore (an in-drive shaft lubricating oil<br>
passageway) formed along the axial center of the drive shaft<br>
15 via a communication hole 54c formed in a side wall of the<br>
right case portion 2b. Then, this drive shaft bore 15a<br>
communicates with sliding surfaces of the drive shaft 15 and<br>
the drive gears via a plurality of branch holes (lubricating<br>
oil supply holes) 15b. Thus, lubricating oil supplied to the<br>
drive shaft bore 15a is supplied to the sliding portions of<br>
the respective gears through the branch holes 15b.<br>
Thus, as has been described heretofore, since the tubular<br>
boss portions 60c are formed in the vicinity of the main shaft<br>
14 and the drive shaft 15 which constitute the transmission,<br>
and the case bolt 60 for connecting the crankcase together is<br>
inserted into the bolt bore 60a extending through the boss<br>
portions 60c so that the space between the inner circumferential<br>
surface of the bolt bore 60a and the outer circumferential<br>
surface of the case bolt 60 is made to constitute the lubricating<br>
oil passageway, and the branch holes (the lubricating oil supply<br>
holes ) 60b directed to the change-speed gears are formed in<br>
the boss portions 60c, lubricating oil can be supplied to the<br>
meshing surfaces of the change-speed gears without providing<br>
exclusive lubricating oil supply passageways.<br>
In addition, since the left and right boss portions 60c<br>
are extended in a tubular fashion so as to abut with each other<br>
face-to-face, and the left and right case portions 2a, 2b are<br>
connected together with the connecting bolt 60 that is inserted<br>
into the boss portions 60c, there is caused no risk that the<br>
side walls of the left and right case portions 2a, 2b are deformed<br>
by virtue of a connecting force so applied, and as a result,<br>
the connecting force of the laterally separable crankcase can<br>
be enhanced. In addition, since the connecting bolt 60 and<br>
the boss portions 60c are disposed at the position close to<br>
the main shaft 14 and the drive shaft 15, the portions close<br>
to the shafts are connected together, whereby the connecting<br>
force of the left and right case portions 2a, 2b can be enhanced<br>
from this point of view.<br>
Additionally, since the connecting bolt 60 and the tubular<br>
boss portions 60c are disposed above the intermediate portions<br>
of the main shaft 14 and the drive shaft 15, and the lubricating<br>
oil supply bores 14b, 15b are formed so as to be directed toward<br>
the groups of change-speed gears on the main shaft and the drive<br>
shaft, the lubricating oil can be supplied to the gears of both<br>
the main shaft and the drive shaft via the single lubricating<br>
oil passageway 60a. In addition, since the connecting bolt<br>
60 is disposed between the gears of the main shaft 14 and the<br>
drive shaft 15, the connecting bolt 60 can be made to be situated<br>
close to the both shafts, whereby the crankcase can be made<br>
smaller in size.<br>
In addition, since the head portion 60e of the connecting<br>
bolt 60 is made to be located within the clutch compartment<br>
10a, even in the event that lubricating oil leaks from a gap<br>
between the head portion 60e of the connecting bolt 60 and the<br>
seat surface 2b', there is no risk that the lubricating oil<br>
that has so leaked falls within the clutch compartment 10a.<br>
Furthermore, since the lubricating supply port is formed<br>
on the screwed portion 60d side of the connecting bolt 60 which<br>
is not exposed to the outside portion, whereas the discharge<br>
port is formed on the head portion 60e side, there is naturally<br>
caused no risk of lubricating oil leakage from the lubricating<br>
oil supply port side portion of the lubricating oil passageway<br>
which provides a higher lubricating oil pressure. Moreover,<br>
since the lubricating oil pressure is lower on the discharge<br>
port side of the lubricating oil passageway which provides a<br>
higher risk that lubricating oil leaks from between the head<br>
portion 60e of the connecting bolt 60 and the seat surface 2b' ,<br>
the amount of lubricating oil that so leaks can be suppressed.<br>
In addition, since the portion of the bolt bore 60a which<br>
is immediately close to the head portion 60e is set smaller<br>
in diameter than that of the other portion of the bolt bore<br>
60a which corresponds to the lubricating oil passageway so that<br>
a gap between the portion and the case bolt 60 is reduced, the<br>
seat surface 2b' with which the headportion 60e of the connecting<br>
bolt 60 is allowed to abut can be secured with ease and the<br>
amount of lubricating oil that so leaks can be suppressed.<br>
Additionally, since the lubricating oil discharge port<br>
of the lubricating oil passageway 60a is made to communicate<br>
with the in-drive shaft lubricating oil passageway 15 and the<br>
lubricating oil supply port thereof is made to communicate with<br>
the in-main shaft lubricating oil passageway 14a, lubricating<br>
oil can be supplied to the surfaces of the drive shaft 15 and<br>
the main shaft 14 over which the change-speed gears are allowed<br>
to slide without providing any exclusive lubricating oil<br>
passageway.<br>
The crankshaft lubricating system 55 has the following<br>
construction. A crankshaft oil passageway 55a is formed in<br>
the filter cover 47 in such amanner as to extend from a crankshaft<br>
side outlet 59c toward the lubricating oil pump 52, the oil<br>
passageway 55a is made to communicate with a communication bore<br>
62a formed in a rotating shaft of the lubricating oil pump 52<br>
in such a manner as to pass therethrough along the axial center<br>
thereof, and furthermore, the communication bore 62a is made<br>
to communicate with a crankshaft oil supply passageway 8e formed<br>
in the crankshaft 8 along the axial center thereof via a<br>
connecting pipe 64 . Then, the crankshaft oil supply passageway<br>
8e communicates with the interior of a pin bore 65a in a crank<br>
pin 65 via a branch hole 8f, and the pin hole 65a is made to<br>
open to a rotating surface of a needle bearing 7b at a bit end<br>
portion 7a of a connecting rod 7 via a branch hole 65b. Thus,<br>
lubricating oil that has been filtered by the oil filter 59<br>
is supplied to the rotating surface of the needle bearing 7b.<br>
The lubricating oil pump 52 has the following general<br>
construction. A pump compartment 61c is provided in a right<br>
case 61b of a two-piece casing made up of left and right cases<br>
61a, 61b in such a manner as to set a relevant portion of the<br>
case further back from the rest, and rotor 63 is disposed<br>
rotationally within the pump compartment 61. The rotating<br>
shaft 62 is inserted and disposed so as to pass through the<br>
axial center of the rotor 63, and the rotating shaft 62 and<br>
the rotor 63 are fixed together with a pin 63a. Note that the<br>
oil pick-up passageway 58a and an oil discharge passageway 58b<br>
are connected to a pump compartment upstream side and a pump<br>
compartment downstream side of the left case 61a, respectively.<br>
In addition, reference numeral 66 denotes a relief valve for<br>
holding the discharge pressure of the lubricating oil pump 52<br>
equal to or smaller than a predetermined value and the relief<br>
valve is adapted to relieve the pressure on the discharge side<br>
of the lubricating oil pump 52 toward the oil pick-up passageway<br>
58a side when the pressure on the discharge side reaches or<br>
exceeds the predetermined value.<br>
The rotating shaft 62 is a tubular shaft which passes<br>
through the pump case 61 in the axial direction and opens to<br>
the crank oil supply passageway 55a at a right end portion thereof<br>
as shown in the drawing. In addition, a power transmitting<br>
flange portion 62b is formed integrally at a left end portion<br>
of the rotating shaft 62 as shown in the drawing. The flange<br>
portion 62b faces a right end face of the crankshaft 8, and<br>
the flange portion 62b and the crankshaft 8 are connected<br>
together by an Oldham' s coupling 67 in such a manner as to absorb<br>
a slight deviation of the centers of the shafts.<br>
Todescribe in detail, theOldham' s shaft 67 is constructed<br>
such that a couplingplate 67a is disposedbetween the crankshaft<br>
8 and the flange portion 62b, a pin 67b planted in the end face<br>
of the crankshaft 8 and a pin 67c planted in the flange portion<br>
62b are inserted into a communicating bore 67d in the coupling<br>
plate 67a.<br>
In addition, the connecting pipe 64 is such as to establish<br>
a communication between the right end opening of the crankshaft<br>
8 and the left end opening of the rotating shaft 62, and a gap<br>
between inner circumferences of the crankshaft opening and the<br>
rotating shaft opening and an outer circumference of the<br>
connecting pipe 64 is sealed with an oil seal 64a.<br>
Here, as has been described above, the crank compartment<br>
2c is defined separately from the other transmission compartment<br>
2d, the flywheel magnet compartment 9a and the clutch compartment<br>
10a, whereby an oil return mechanism is constructed in which<br>
the pressure within the crank compartment 2c is fluctuated to<br>
be positive and negative as the piston 6 strokes, so that<br>
lubricating oil in the respective compartments is returned to<br>
the lubricating oil tank 51 by virtue of the pressure<br>
fluctuation.<br>
To describe this in detail, a discharge port 2g and a<br>
suction or pick-up port 2h are foirmed in the crank compartment<br>
2c. A discharge port reed valve 69 adapted to open when the<br>
pressure within the crank compartment is positive is disposed<br>
in the discharge port 2g, and a pick-up port reed valve 70 adapted<br>
to open when the pressure within the crank compartment is<br>
negative is disposed in the pick-up port 2h.<br>
Then, the discharge port 2g communicates with the clutch<br>
compartment 10a from the crank compartment 2c via a communication<br>
bore 2i and then communicates with the transmission compartment<br>
2d from the clutch compartment 10a via a communication bore<br>
2 j . Furthermore, the transmission compartment 2d communicates<br>
with the flywheel magnet compartment 9a via a communication<br>
bore 2k. A return port 2m formed so as to communicate with<br>
the flywheel magnet compartment 9a communicates with the<br>
lubricating oil tank 51 via a return hose 57c, an oil strainer<br>
57d and a return hose 57e.<br>
Here, a guide plate 2n is provided at the return port<br>
2m. This guide plate 2n has a function to ensure the discharge<br>
of lubricating oil by modifying the return port 2m so as to<br>
provide a narrow gap a between a bottom plate 2p and itself<br>
and to secure a wide width b.<br>
In addition, an oil separating mechanism is connected<br>
to the lubricating oil tank 51 for separating oil mists contained<br>
in the air within the tank by virtue of centrifugal force so<br>
as to return oil mists so separated to the crank compartment<br>
2c. This oil separating mechanism has a construction in which<br>
an introduction hose 72a which is connected to an upper portion<br>
of the lubricating oil tank 51 at one end thereof is tangentially<br>
connected to an upper portion of a cone-shaped separating<br>
compartment 71 at the other end and a return hose 72b connected<br>
to a bottom portion of the separating compartment 71 is connected<br>
to the pick-up port 2h of the crank compartment 2c. Note that<br>
the air from which the oil mists are separated is discharged<br>
to the atmosphere via an exhaust hole 72c.<br>
Thus, according to the embodiment, since the crank chamber<br>
2c is made to be a substantially closed space so that the pressure<br>
therein fluctuates as the piston 6 reciprocates vertically,<br>
whereby lubricating oil that has flowed into the crank<br>
compartment 2c is sent back to the lubricating oil tank 51 by<br>
virtue of pressure fluctuation within the crank compartment<br>
2c, the necessity of an exclusive oil sending pump (a scavenging<br>
pump) can be obviated, and hence the construction of the engine<br>
can be simplified and costs can be attempted to be reduced.<br>
Inaddition, since thedischarge port reed valve (an outlet<br>
side check valve) 69 adapted to open when the pressure in the<br>
crank compartment increases and to close when the pressure lowers<br>
is disposed in the vicinity of where the oil sending passageway<br>
is connected to the crank compartment 2c, the lubricating oil<br>
within the crank compartment 2c can be sent back to the<br>
lubricating oil storage tank 51 in a more ensured fashion.<br>
In addition, since an portion above the oil level within<br>
the lubricating oil storage tank 51 is connected to the crank<br>
compartment 2 via the return hoses 72a, 72b and the discharge<br>
port reed valve (a pick-up side check valve) 70 adapted to open<br>
when the pressure in the crank compartment 2c lowers and to<br>
close when the pressure increases is provided in the vicinity<br>
where the return hoses are connected to the crank compartment<br>
2c, air required is picked up into the crank compartment 2c<br>
when the piston 6 moves upwardly, whereas the inside pressure<br>
of the crank compartment 2c increases as the piston 6 lowers,<br>
whereby lubricating oil within the crank compartment 2c can<br>
be sent tout in a more ensured fashion.<br>
Incidentally, in a case where there is provided no air<br>
supply path from the outside to the interior of the crank<br>
compartment 2c, only a negative pressure or a lower positive<br>
pressure is formed inside the crank compartment, this causing<br>
a concern that there occurs a case where oil cannot be sent<br>
out properly.<br>
Furthermore, since the centrifugal lubricating oil mist<br>
separating mechanism 71 for separating lubricating oil mist<br>
is interposed at the intermediate position along the length<br>
of the return passageways 72a, 72b, so that lubricating oil<br>
mist so separated is returned to the crank compartment 2c via<br>
the return hose 72b, whereas air from which the mist content<br>
is removed is discharged to the atmosphere, only lubricating<br>
oil mist can be returned to the crank compartment, whereby the<br>
reduction in oil sending efficiency can be avoided which would<br>
occur when an excessive amount of air is allowed to flow into<br>
the crank compartment, thereby making it possible to send out<br>
lubricating oil in the crank compartment in an ensured fashion<br>
while preventing the atmospheric pollution.<br>
In addition, since the lubricating oil pump 52 is connected<br>
to one end of the crankshaft 8 and the discharge port of the<br>
lubricating oil pump 52 is made to communicate with the<br>
crankshaft oil supply bore (an in-crankshaft oil supply<br>
passageway) 8e formed in the crankshaft 8 via a communicating<br>
bore (an in-pump oil supply passageway) 62e formed in the<br>
lubricating oil pump 52 and the connecting pipe 64, lubricating<br>
oil can be supplied to the parts needing lubrication of the<br>
crankshaft 8 with the simple and compact construction.<br>
Additionally, since the crankshaft 8 and the lubricating<br>
oil pump 52 are connected with the Oldham' s coupling 67 which<br>
can absorb the deviation in a direction normal to the axes of<br>
the shafts, the communication hole 62a and the crankshaft oil<br>
supply passageway 8e are made to communicate with each other<br>
via the connecting pipe 64, and the resilient 0 ring 64a is<br>
interposed between the connectingpipe 64, and the communication<br>
hole 62a and the crankshaft oil supply bore 8e, even in the<br>
event that a slight deviation in center takes places between<br>
the crankshaft 8 and the pump shaft 62, lubricating oil can<br>
be supplied to theparts needing lubricationwithout anyproblem,<br>
thereby making it possible to secure required lubricating<br>
properties.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
According to the first aspect of the invention, since<br>
the space between the bolt bores of the left and right boss<br>
portions into which the connecting bolt is inserted and the<br>
connecting bolt is made to constitute the lubricating oil<br>
passageway and the lubricating oil supply holes directed to<br>
the change-speed gears are formed in the boss portions in such<br>
a manner as to branch off from the lubricating the oil passageway,<br>
lubricating oil can be supplied to the meshing surfaces of the<br>
change-speed gears without providing, for example, an exclusive<br>
lubricating oil passageway, and the space where the system is<br>
arranged is made smaller in size when compared with a case where,<br>
for example, an exclusive lubricating pipe is provided, and<br>
as a result, the enlargement of the crankcase can be avoided.<br>
In addition, since the left and right boss portions are extended<br>
in the tubular fashion so as to be brought into abutment with<br>
each other face-to-face and the left and right case portions<br>
are connected together with the connecting bolt that is inserted<br>
thereinto, the connecting force of the laterally separable<br>
crankcase can, as a result, be enhanced without a risk that<br>
the side walls of the left and right case portions are deformed<br>
by virtue of the connecting force. In addition, since the<br>
connecting bolt and the boss portions are disposed in the<br>
vicinity of the main shaft and the drive shaft, the crankcase<br>
is connected together at the portions in the vicinity of the<br>
shafts, and the connecting force of the left and right case<br>
portions can be enhanced from this point of view.<br>
According to the second aspect of the invention, since<br>
the connecting bolt and the tubular boss portions are disposed<br>
above the intermediate portions of the main shaft and the drive<br>
shaft and the lubricating oil supply holes are formed so as<br>
to be directed toward the change-speed gears on the main shaft<br>
and the drive shaft, lubricating oil can be supplied to the<br>
change-speed gears on both the main shaft and the drive shaft<br>
by the single lubricating oil passageway. In addition, since<br>
the connecting bolt is disposed between the gears on the both<br>
shafts, the connecting bolt is allowed to be made close to the<br>
both shafts, thereby making it possible to make the crankcase<br>
smaller in size.<br>
According to the third aspect of the invention, since<br>
the head portion of the connecting bolt is situated in the clutch<br>
compartment, even in case lubricating oil leaks from the gap<br>
between the head portion of the connecting bolt and the seat<br>
surface, the lubricating oil that has so leaked falls into the<br>
clutch compartment, causing no problem.<br>
According to the fourth aspect of the invention, since<br>
the lubricating oil supply port is formed in the screwed side<br>
of the connecting bolt, whereas the lubricating oil discharge<br>
port is formed in the head portion side thereof, the lubricating<br>
oil supply port side where the pressure of lubricating oil in<br>
the lubricating oil passageway is high is completely closed,<br>
while since the pressure of lubricating oil is low which resides<br>
on the discharge port side where there exists a possibility<br>
of lubricating oil leaking from the gap between the head portion<br>
of the connecting bolt and the seat surface, the amount of<br>
lubricating oil that will leak can be suppressed.<br>
According to the fifth aspect of the invention, since<br>
the portion of the bolt bore which is situated immediately close<br>
to the head portion of the connecting bolt is formed smaller<br>
in diameter so that the gap between the portion and the connecting<br>
bolt becomes narrower than the one along the portion thereof<br>
which correspond to the lubricating oil passageway, the seat<br>
surface with which the head portion of the connecting bolt is<br>
brought into abutment can be easily secured, and the amount<br>
of lubricating oil that will leak can be suppressed.<br>
According to the sixth aspect of the invention, since<br>
the lubricating oil discharge port is made to communicate with<br>
the in-drive shaft lubricating oil passageway, and a formed<br>
within the drive shaft and according to the seventh aspect of<br>
the invention, since the lubricatingoil supplyport side portion<br>
of the lubricating oil passageway is made to communicate with<br>
the in-main shaft lubricating oil passageway, lubricating oil<br>
can be supplied to the sliding surfaces of the drive shaft and<br>
