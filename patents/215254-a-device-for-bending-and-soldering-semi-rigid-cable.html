				<td>The present invention relates to a device for pending soldering semi rigid cable used<br><br>
for bending the semi regid cable to the desired shape and angle.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention resides in soldering the SMA connector to the semi rigid cable.<br>
The semi rigid cable mailing tool of the present invention helps in bending the cables without doing any mathematical calculations and also facilitates bending of the cable in all axial directions.<br>
Another feature of the semi rigid cable making tool of the present invention is that the cables not only can be bended in any axial direction but can also be bended at any desired angle. The tool of the subject invention enables the bending of the semi rigid cable in two as well as in three dimensions.<br>
The tool of the present invention also helps in soldering the SMA connector to the Semi Rigid Cable making tool unaided. This tool of the present invention can also be used for solder straight and right angled connectors.<br>
Semi rigid cable used is a co-axial cable, having a centre copper conductor surrounded by a dielectric material which is further jacketed by a copper tube. This cable can be used within various frequency ranges. Bending or forming these cables is preferably done with a lot of care without affecting the cross section of the cable. A<br><br>
wrong bending causes rejection of the cable thereby emphasising the requirement of flawless and accurate bending. The semi rigid cable  making tool of the subject invention bends the semi rigid cable to the required shape and angle. It also helps in soldering the SMA connector to the cable while keeping the connector in the same plane.<br>
The semi rigid cable making tool of the present invention has a fixed roller on one end which is of the desired diameter. The bending radius of the SMA connector to the cable depends on the cable diameter. Therefore the precise requirements of the bended cable determines the diameter of the roller and the bending radius.<br>
There are provisions within the semi rigid cable making tool of the present invention for selecting the diameter of the cable. The difference in the cable diameter can be achieved by replacing the rollers on the fixed and movable arm of the tool. The said fixed first roller is grooved to accomodate the cable diameter where the centre of the cable matches the outer edge of the roller. Means for supporting are provided on the protractor used for bending the cables at different angles. These means for supporting are preferably supporting bars. Another roller is provided on the movable arm of the tool. The roller is supported by the supporting means especially provided beside such second roller. The movable arms of the semi rigid cable making tool of the present invention are provided with fine and coarse movement controls. The distance of the moving arm is preferably set with respect to the scale provided at the bottom of the tool. The movable arms can be fixed in the desired position with the help of the fine adjustment provisions provided in the system.<br><br>
To bend the cable at different angles a protractor is provided which is suitably placed in the tool of the present invention. Supporting means are provided to maintain the position of the protractor being used.<br>
Further features of the tool of the present invention include a panel mounted female SMA connector attached to the other arm of the tool. Means are provided to hold the cable in place. Further to solder the right angled connectors in the same plane and also at the desired pitch, two panel mounted connectors are provided which are attached to the two arms respectively.<br>
This invention is useful in making the cable without doing any mathematical calculations. The tool of the subject invention is operator friendly. Once the pitch of the two SMA connectors is known than the cablo can be made faster and accuartely with the help of the said tool. Normally, while soldering two right angles connectrors, the coplanarity is required to be maintained. This is difficult to do without the tool, semi rigid cable bending tool helps to accomplish this task unaided.<br>
According to the present invention thereis provided a device for bending and soldering semi rigid cable, comprising a base having a scale mounted longitudinally on the said base having two fixed arms placed adjacently near the ends of the said base characterized in that a beam is provided joining the said two fixed arms having a moving arm moving freely on the said beam, a fine tuning device movably attached to the said moving arm, a pair of bending means fixed to one of the said first fixed arm and said moving arm, a plurality of guiding means provided on the said first fixed arm and on the said moving arm around the said bending means, a removable protractor provided at the fixed arm, the said second fixed arm is provided with the means for the soldering connectors to the said cable.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The semi rigid cable bending device is comprising a base having a scale mounted longitudinally on the said base. On the said base two fixed arms are placed adjacently near the ends of said base. Out of these two arms which are L shaped, the elongation/ protrusion on one arm is facing towards the other fixed arm, while the elongation / protrusion on the second fixed arm is facing outward. These two fixed arms are connected by a rectangular beam. A moving arm is fixed on the said beam to adjust both the coarse and line movement control by means of fine adjustments wheels. The movable arm is locked at the desired position after making fine adjustments by means of locking screw placed on the movable arm. The said moving arm is attached to the fine tuning device by means of a screw. There is provided a pair of rollers rigidly fixed, one on the moving arm and another on the fixed arm.There is provided plurality of guiding means . A pair of guiding means are fixed on the fixed arm and a supplementary guiding means is fixed on the said moving arm.<br>
The lower end of the movable arm is pointed to act as pointer on the said scale placed longitudinally on the said base. The fine tuning device comprises a moving rectangular attachment having dimensions in conformity to the said fixed beam and an adjusting means at the lower end. The lower end of the tuning device is tapered at the lower end having a cavity for the insertion of the screw , which connects the moving arm with the fine tuning device. The screw is provided with a fine adjustment wheel to provide finer adjustments, while moving the moving arm. On the upper end of the said device is provided a knob for the coarser movements of the moving arm. After<br><br>
the coarser and finer adjustments the locking means are provided on said movable arm to fix said movable arm at the desired place.<br>
The main guiding means placed horizontally at the fixed arm, is larger in size as compared to the other guiding means on the said arm. The said guiding arms are having protrusion to accomodate the center of the semi rigid cable and to hold the cable in position while bending. The guding means are rectangular in shape and are provided with a pair of Dowel pins. The first fixed arm is provided with holes around the bending means for the insertion of said Dowel pins of said guiding means.<br>
The pair bending means which are rigidly fixed on the first fixed arm and moving arm are grooved circular reels. The grooves in the said reels are to accomodate the dimensions of the said cable.<br>
The soldering means are provided on the said second fixed arm. Said means comprises a vertical rod having a moving gripping attachment to hold the semi rigid cable. The said second fixed arm is also provided with a fixed holding means for the placement of connectors for said soldering.<br>
The tool (1) of the figure 1 has a fixed roller on one end, which is of a desired diameter. For different diameters, the radius of bend is changed by replacing the rollers on the fixed and movable arm (2 and 3) of the tool. The bending means (6 and 9) are grooved to accommodate the cable diameter. The centre of the cable matches with the outer edge of the roller. The guiding means (5) are provided at right angles<br><br>
to each other. These are cross hair marked deep on the top of the roller at 90° angle. The supporting bars are located with the help of Dowel pins.<br>
The second bending means (9) is on the movable arm of the tool. There is a supporting bar on one side of the roller. The movable arm (3) has both course and fine movement control.
