SYSTEM, DEVICE, AND METHODS FOR UPDATING SYSTEM-<br>
MONITORING MODELS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the priority of U.S. provisional patent application<br>
number 60/605,346, titled "MODEL ASSOCIATION IN FLEET MONITORING<br>
SYSTEM FOR LARGE POWER PLANTS," filed August 27, 2004.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is related to the field of sensor-based monitoring, and,<br>
more particularly, to monitoring multi-element systems using multiple sensors.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Multi-element systems such as a power generation plant can involve<br>
the complex integration of multiple elements cooperatively performing a<br>
variety of tasks in order to attain a desired output or goal. Owing to this<br>
complexity, the monitoring of such a system so as to prevent or mitigate a<br>
failure or less-than desired level of performance can itself be a complex task.<br>
One monitoring technique in such an environment utilizes estimation<br>
models and sensors. According to this technique, the sensors generate<br>
signals from which are derived sensor vectors based on sensed measures of<br>
physical or other inputs to the system and outputs generated by the system in<br>
response to the inputs. The sensor vectors are initially used to statistically<br>
"train" the estimation model. The model provides a mathematical or statistical<br>
relationship between the inputs to the system and the corresponding outputs<br>
generated by the system. During subsequent monitoring of the system, raw<br>
data from the sensors are input into the model and compared with estimated<br>
values obtained by applying the model. A large deviation between actual<br>
values of the sensor data and the estimated values generated by the model<br>
can indicate that a system fault has occurred.<br>
Sensor-based monitoring can be used in a variety of settings. Power<br>
generation plants, manufacturing processes, complex medical equipment, and<br>
a host of other systems and devices involving the coordinated functioning of a<br><br>
large number of interrelated components or processes can often be efficiently<br>
monitored and controlled through sensor-based monitoring. Indeed, sensor-<br>
based monitoring can be advantageously employed in virtually any<br>
environment in which various system-specific parameters need to be<br>
monitored over time under varying conditions.<br>
An electrical power generation plant provides a useful example of a<br>
system that can efficiently employ sensor-based monitoring. Electrical power<br>
generation involves the complex integration of multiple power generation<br>
components that function cooperatively to generate electrical power. These<br>
components can include gas turbines, heat recovery steam generators, steam<br>
turbines, and electrical generators that in combination convert fuel-bound<br>
energy via mechanical energy into electrical energy. Important operating<br>
variables that should be closely monitored to assess the performance of the<br>
entire power plant, or one or more of its components such as a gas turbine,<br>
include pressure and temperature in various regions of the system as well as<br>
vibrations and other important parameters that reveal the condition of the<br>
equipment of the system.<br>
Regardless of the environment in which sensor-based monitoring is<br>
utilized, the accuracy of the model employed can be a critical factor in<br>
whether the monitoring is accurate. A model's accuracy often times depends<br>
on whether the model is appropriately updated to reflect structural or other<br>
changes in the system monitored with the model. Additionally, new models<br>
may be developed that would enhance monitoring of a system. More than<br>
one model may be applied with respect to a monitored system.<br>
The task of updating system-monitoring models is made more complex<br>
when more than one system is monitored on the basis of multiple models. If a<br>
property of an underlying model that applies to two or more systems is<br>
updated, then modifying each of the models in accordance with the updated<br>
property typically requires loading each model on one or more computing<br>
devices that perform the various model calculations for each particular<br>
system. Thus, updating estimation model properties and modification of<br>
estimation models in response to the updating typically must be performed<br>
with respect to each system separately.<br><br>
Performing these tasks separately for an estimation model as it is<br>
applied to different systems can be an arduous, time consuming task for a<br>
diagnostic engineer or technician. This is especially so given that in many<br>
situations, engineers and technicians in diagnostic centers may be charged<br>
with monitoring hundreds of systems continuously or on a frequent basis.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for a way to more effectively and efficiently<br>
update estimation properties and modify system-monitoring models in<br>
response to the updates when such estimation models are used in the<br>
monitoring of large numbers of systems.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a model association and a related<br>
mechanism for updating system-monitoring models across a large number of<br>
systems. The invention can be electronically implemented to effect savings in<br>
time and resources needed to update models applied to the various systems.<br>
One embodiment of the invention is an electronically-implemented<br>
model association method for updating estimation models used for system<br>
monitoring. The method can include determining an association between a<br>
particular monitored system and at least one of a plurality of estimation<br>
models for each of a plurality of monitored systems. Each estimation model<br>
can be based upon one of a plurality of distinct sets of estimation properties,<br>
and each set can uniquely correspond to a particular estimation model.<br>
The method can further include updating at least one of the estimation<br>
properties and propagating the at least one updated estimation property to<br>
each estimation model that corresponds to a distinct set containing the at<br>
least one estimation property that is updated. Additionally, the method can<br>
include modifying each estimation model that corresponds to a distinct set<br>
containing the at least one estimation property that is updated.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is a system for updating a<br>
plurality of monitoring models. The system can include a model association<br>
module that for each of a plurality of monitored systems determines an<br>
association between a particular monitored system and at least one of a<br>
plurality of estimation models, wherein each estimation model is based upon<br><br>
one of a plurality of distinct sets of estimation properties, and wherein each<br>
set uniquely corresponds to a particular estimation model.<br>
Additionally, the system can include an updating module that updates<br>
at least one of the estimation properties and propagates the at least one<br>
updated estimation property to each estimation model that corresponds to a<br>
distinct set containing the at least one estimation property that is updated.<br>
The system further can include a model modification module that modifies<br>
each estimation model that corresponds to a distinct set containing the at<br>
least one estimation property that is updated.<br>
Still another embodiment of the invention is a computer-readable<br>
storage medium comprising computer instructions. The computer instructions<br>
can include instructions for determining for each of a plurality of monitored<br>
systems an association between a particular monitored system and at least<br>
one of a plurality of estimation models. The computer instructions also can<br>
include updating at least one of the estimation properties.<br>
The computer instructions further can include instructions for<br>
propagating at least one updated estimation property to each estimation<br>
model that corresponds to a distinct set containing the at least one estimation<br>
property that is updated. Additionally, the computer instructions can include<br>
instructions for modifying each estimation model that corresponds to a distinct<br>
set containing the at least one estimation property that is updated.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
FIG. 1 is an exemplary environment 100 in which a system 102 for<br>
updating a plurality of monitoring models, according to one embodiment of the<br>
invention, can be used. The environment 100 includes a plurality of<br>
monitored systems 104a, 104b, 104c. Although three such monitored<br>
systems are explicitly shown, it is to be understood that in alternative<br>
embodiments the environment 100 can comprise more or fewer such<br>
monitored systems. The monitored systems 104a, 104b, 104c more<br>
particularly, can comprise power generation systems, processing plants,<br>
multi-component medical devices, or other such systems characterized by the<br>
cooperative functioning of multiple or complex components in the generation<br>
of one or more measurable outputs in response to one or more measurable<br>
inputs.<br>
Each of the monitored systems 104a, 104b, 104c is illustratively<br>
monitored by a plurality of sensors 106a, 106b, 106c, respectively. The<br>
various sensors 106a, 106b, 106c can comprise transducers that generate<br>
electrical signal responses to various physical phenomena corresponding to<br>
the inputs and outputs of the respective systems. For example, in the context<br>
of power generation, if each of the monitored systems 104a, 104b, 104c<br>
comprises a power generation plant, sensor-measured output includes not<br>
only electrical power, but other outputs that are inevitable by-products of<br>
electrical power generation. The other outputs can include, for example,<br><br>
temperatures, pressures and vibrations of the main power generation<br>
components such as gas turbines, boilers, steam turbines, and electrical<br>
generators. In the same context, inputs to the power generation plant can<br>
include, for example, gas, air, and/or steam.<br>
The response signals generated by each of the plurality of sensors<br>
106a, 106b, 106c provide data, or sensor vectors, that can be used for<br>
monitoring and detecting faults in the monitored systems 104a, 104b, 104c.<br>
The sensor-generated signals can be processed to produce quantifiable data.<br>
For example, the sensor-generated signals can be digitized and manipulated<br>
by a digital signal processor to generate the sensor vectors. Other known<br>
processing techniques, including analog signal processing, can alternatively<br>
or additionally be used for generating quantifiable data corresponding to the<br>
operation of the monitored systems 104a, 104b, 104c.<br>
The sensor vectors resulting from the sensor-generated signals are<br>
illustratively described here in the context of inferential sensing. Inferential<br>
sensing entails the construction of estimation models that mathematically or<br>
statistically model the operation of the monitored systems 104a, 104b, 104c.<br>
Such estimation models provide correlations among the various measured<br>
inputs and outputs of the monitored systems 104a, 104b, 104c. As will be<br>
readily understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, an estimation model<br>
generates estimated values that can be compared to actual values to<br>
determine one or more residuals and to ascertain acceptable ranges for the<br>
residuals. A fault is indicated if a residual determined during operation of a<br>
monitored system falls outside its acceptable range.<br>
The models that can be used for such inferential system include<br>
standard regression models such as least squares as well as newer ones<br>
such as different variants of kernel regression models and ones based on<br>
neural networks. It will be apparent from the description herein that the<br>
system 102 according to the invention is not limited by the nature of the<br>
particular models used for monitoring the monitored systems 104a, 104b,<br>
104c. Regardless of the particular model employed, construction of the model<br>
is typically accomplished during a training phase in which raw data is used to<br>
"train" a particular model for creation of sensor estimates, as will be<br><br>
understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. During a subsequent monitoring<br>
phase, newly-generated sensor data is input to the model or models so<br>
trained in order to detect faults in a corresponding one of the plurality of<br>
monitored systems 104a, 104b, 104c.<br>
The system 102 is illustratively connected to a plurality of sensor-<br>
system interfaces 108a, 108b, 108c, which, in turn are each connected<br>
to a particular subset of the plurality of sensors 106a, 106b, 106 that<br>
monitor one of the plurality of monitored systems 104a, 104b, 104c.<br>
Sensor-generated signals are illustratively supplied by each of the<br>
plurality of sensors 106a, 106b, 106c to a corresponding one of the<br>
plurality of monitored systems 104a, 104b, 104c. The sensor-system<br>
interfaces 108a, 108b, 108c perform the function, already described, of<br>
converting the signals into quantifiable data. Accordingly, the sensor-<br>
system interfaces 108a, 108b, 108c can include one or more<br>
multiplexers for multiplexing a plurality of sensor-generated signals.<br>
The sensor-system interfaces 108a, 108b, 108c, according to still<br>
another embodiment, can comprise digital signal processors for<br>
processing digitized signals derived from the sensor-generated signals.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, these signal processing functions are<br>
performed by elements included within the system 102 itself. Moreover,<br>
the plurality of sensors 106a, 106b, 106 alternatively can connect<br>
directly to the system 102. According to any of these various<br>
embodiments, the processed signals are used to construct estimation<br>
models, as described above.<br>
As schematically illustrated, the monitored systems 104a, 104b,<br>
104c are remotely monitored by the system 102. Thus, the system can<br>
be located a distance away from the monitored systems at, for example,<br>
a diagnostic center (not shown) that is remote from the various systems<br>
that it monitors. With remote monitoring, the sensor vectors, which here<br>
comprise the operational data pertaining to the monitored systems<br>
104a, 104b, 104c, are transferred to the system 102 continuously or,<br><br>
alternatively, in batch deliveries with each batch comprising data that<br>
encompasses the performance of a monitored system during the time<br>
since the last batch delivery of data. Although the system 102 is<br>
illustrated here as remotely monitoring various monitored systems 104a,<br>
104b, 104c, it is to be understood that the system 102 alternatively can<br>
comprise multiple systems deployed locally at separate monitored<br>
systems. The locally deployed systems can be linked, for example, via<br>
a data communications network such that local monitoring can be<br>
coordinated. Moreover, a single system can be deployed locally to<br>
monitor multiple components of a monitored system in the same<br>
manner described.<br>
Referring additionally now to FIG. 2, a particular embodiment of<br>
the system 102 for updating a plurality of monitoring models is<br>
schematically illustrated. The system 102 illustratively includes a model<br>
association module 202, an updating module 204, and a model<br>
modification module 206, each in communication with the other.<br>
According to one embodiment, one or more of the modules are<br>
implemented in one or more dedicated hardwired circuits for performing<br>
the respective functions described below. Alternatively, one or more of<br>
the modules can be implemented in machine-readable code configured<br>
to run on a general-purpose or application-specific device. In still<br>
another embodiment, one or more of the modules are implemented in a<br>
combination of hardwired circuitry and machine-readable code.<br>
Operatively, for each of the plurality of monitored systems 104a-c,<br>
the model association module 202 determines an association between<br>
the monitored systems and a plurality of estimation models constructed<br>
as described above. Thus, each particular one of the monitored<br>
systems 104a, 104b, 104c is associated with at least one such<br>
estimation model. One or more of the monitored systems 104a, 104b,<br>
104c, however, can be associated by the model association module<br>
with more than one estimation model. For example, one monitored<br><br>
system 104a might be associated with a regression-type model alone.<br>
Another monitored system 104b might be associated with a regression<br>
model, a model based on auto-associative neural network, and/or a<br>
kernel regression model. Yet another monitored system 104c might be<br>
associated with only two such models.<br>
A more generalized example of the model association scheme 300<br>
performed by the model association module 202 is schematically illustrated in<br>
FIG. 3. The model association scheme 300 associates a plurality of J<br>
monitored systems, S1, S2, . . ., SJ, with a plurality of K estimation models,<br>
M1, M2, .. ., MK. As depicted in this example, a first system, S1, is modeled<br>
by and, therefore, associated with only one model, M1. A second system, S2,<br>
is associated with three different models, M1, M2, and M3, which, though<br>
distinct models, are each applicable to the second system, S2. The J-th<br>
system, SJ, is associated with the second of the K models, M2, as well as<br>
the K-th model, each providing different modeling aspects of the system, SJ.<br>
From this example, it will be readily apparent that the model association<br>
scheme 300 performed by the model association module 202 is sufficiently<br>
general to encompass various other possible combinations. The particular<br>
associative combination, of course, is primarily dictated by the nature of the<br>
systems monitored as well as the different models used.<br>
As further illustrated by the schematic of FIG. 3, each particular<br>
estimation model is based upon one of a plurality of distinct sets of estimation<br>
properties,  , The estimation,<br>
properties can include, for example, a sensor list, sensor thresholds, training<br>
periods, an estimation model algorithm, and/or various algorithm parameters.<br>
All or some combination of particular ones of these estimation properties can<br>
be applicable to each of the different models. Accordingly, even though one<br>
or more of the estimation properties may apply with respect to more than one<br>
model, each set of estimation properties uniquely corresponds to a particular<br>
estimation model.<br><br>
The updating module 204 updates one or more of the estimation<br>
properties in response to user input. When an estimation property is updated,<br>
the updating module 204 then propagates the updated estimation property to<br>
each estimation model that corresponds to a distinct set containing the<br>
estimation property, which has now been updated. An updated estimation<br>
property replaces the pre-updated version in the set.<br>
Once one or more updated estimation properties is propagated by the<br>
updating module 204 to the one or more estimation models that correspond to<br>
a unique set of estimation properties that include at least one of the now-<br>
updated estimation properties, those estimation models to which are<br>
propagated updated estimation properties need to be revised or updated.<br>
The modifying is performed by the model modification module 206, which<br>
modifies each estimation model that corresponds to a distinct set containing<br>
at least one estimation property that is updated. As described more<br>
particularly below, an estimation model that has been modified in response to<br>
an updating of one or more of the estimation properties contained in the set of<br>
properties corresponding to the estimation model can subsequently be<br>
"retrained" to create new sensor-generated sensor vectors.<br>
In a particular instance, it may be that an estimation model used to<br>
model one or more of the monitored systems 104a, 104b, 104c is deemed to<br>
perform insufficiently with respect to one of the monitored systems. This<br>
could be due, for example, to a change in the underlying structure of one of<br>
the monitored systems 104a, 104b, 104c. Conversely, changes in system<br>
structure or other circumstances may lead to a model becoming better suited<br>
for monitoring one of the monitored systems 104a, 104b, 104c to which the<br>
model formerly was not applied. Additionally, new models may be developed<br>
for use with one or more of the monitored systems 104a, 104b, 104c.<br>
Thus, according to another embodiment of the invention, the model<br>
association module 202 is configured to update associations between the<br>
monitored systems and the associated estimation models in response to<br>
changes in system structure and other circumstances, as well as to the<br>
addition of new models or elimination of old ones.<br><br>
Referring additionally now to FIG. 4, the associations between M<br>
different systems and N estimation models, at any given instance, can be<br>
concisely presented by a fleet table 400. The fleet table 400 can be<br>
implemented as an M x N matrix, with M being an integer greater than one<br>
corresponding to the number of monitored systems, and N being an integer<br>
equal to the number of estimation models associated with the different<br>
monitored systems. An association between the i -th system and the j'-th<br>
model is represented by the i,j -th element of the matrix being assigned a<br>
value of 1; in the absence of an association, the i, j-th element of the matrix is<br>
zero. The fleet table 400 is easily modified by changing ones and zeros as<br>
the model association module 202 updates associations in response to<br>
changing circumstances such as system structural changes and/or the<br>
addition or elimination of estimation models.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 5, an alternative embodiment of a system 500 for<br>
updating a plurality of monitoring models further includes a training module<br>
508. The training module 508 trains system-specific versions of each<br>
estimation model for each monitored system. The training is performed using<br>
sensor data generated by the sensors communicatively linked to a particular<br>
system for which a particular system-specific version of an estimation model<br>
is trained. The training module 508 is illustratively in communication with a<br>
model association module 502, an updating module 504, and a model<br>
modification module 506.<br>
The model association module 502, updating module 504, and model<br>
modification module 506 each perform the functions previously described.<br>
Accordingly, in yet another embodiment, the training module 508 can be<br>
configured to cooperatively function with each of the other modules to retrain<br>
each system-specific version of each estimation model that has been modified<br>
as a result of the operations performed by the other modules.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is an electronically-implemented<br>
model association method 600 for updating estimation models, as<br>
schematically illustrated by the exemplary steps of FIG. 6. Each of the<br>
estimation models can comprise one of various models used for inferential<br>
sensing as already described. The method 600, at step 602, illustratively<br><br>
includes determining an association between a particular monitored system<br>
and at least one of a plurality of estimation models. Each of the estimation<br>
models is based upon one of a plurality of distinct sets of estimation<br>
properties, and each set uniquely corresponds to a particular estimation<br>
model.<br>
The method 600 additionally includes updating at least one of the<br>
estimation properties at step 604. At step 606, the method 600 further<br>
includes propagating updated estimation properties to each estimation model<br>
that corresponds to a distinct set containing the at least one estimation<br>
property that is updated. The method 600 includes, at step 608, modifying<br>
each estimation model that corresponds to a distinct set containing at least<br>
one estimation property that is updated. The method illustratively concludes<br>
at step 610.<br>
According to yet another embodiment, the method 600 can include<br>
updating at least one association between a monitored system and an<br>
associated estimation model. The additional step can be optionally performed<br>
at any point during a procedure for updating a plurality of system monitoring<br>
models according to the steps already described.<br>
Referring now to the flowchart of FIG. 7, an electronically-implemented<br>
model association method 700 according to yet another embodiment is<br>
illustrated. The method 700, at step 702, illustratively includes determining an<br>
association between a particular monitored system and at least one of a<br>
plurality of estimation models. Each associated estimation is trained at step<br>
704. Each model is trained individually for each system that it models using<br>
sensor vectors supplied by sensors communicatively linked to the particular<br>
system. Each model so trained, defines a system-specific version of the<br>
estimation model corresponding to the system for which it is trained.<br>
The method 700 further includes updating at least one of the estimation<br>
properties at step 706. The method 700 also includes, at step 708,<br>
propagating updated estimation properties to each estimation model that<br>
corresponds to a distinct set containing the at least one estimation property<br>
that is updated. The method 700 includes, at step 710, modifying each<br>
estimation model that corresponds to a distinct set containing at least one<br><br>
estimation property that is updated. At step 712, the method 700 includes<br>
retraining each system-specific version of each estimation model that has<br>
been modified. As with the training of a model, the retraining of the model is<br>
based upon sensor data generated by sensors communicatively linked to a<br>
particular system for which a particular system-specific version of an<br>
estimation model is retrained. The method illustratively concludes at step<br>
712.<br>
As noted throughout, the invention can be realized in hardware,<br>
software, or a combination of hardware and software. The invention also can<br>
be realized in a centralized fashion in one computer system, or in a distributed<br>
fashion where different elements are spread across several interconnected<br>
computer systems. Any kind of computer system or other apparatus adapted<br>
for carrying out the methods described herein is suited. A typical combination<br>
of hardware and software can be a general-purpose computer system with a<br>
computer program that, when being loaded and executed, controls the<br>
computer system such that it carries out the methods described herein.<br>
The invention can be embedded in a computer program product, which<br>
comprises all the features enabling the implementation of the methods<br>
described herein, and which when loaded in a computer system is able to<br>
carry out these methods. Computer program in the present context means<br>
any expression, in any language, code or notation, of a set of instructions<br>
intended to cause a system having an information processing capability to<br>
perform a particular function either directly or after either or both of the<br>
following: a) conversion to another language, code or notation; b)<br>
reproduction in a different material form.<br>
This invention can be embodied in other forms without departing from<br>
the spirit or essential attributes thereof. Accordingly, reference should be<br>
made to the following claims, rather than to the foregoing specification, as<br>
indicating the scope of the invention.<br><br>
