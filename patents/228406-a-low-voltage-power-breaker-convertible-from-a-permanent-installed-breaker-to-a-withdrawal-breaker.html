				<td>The abovementioned embodiment of the busbars makes it possible<br>
for them to be arranged directly on the permanently installed<br>
breaker for use in a permanently installed breaker, but it is<br>
also possible for these busbars to be arranged permanently on the<br>
withdrawable part rack of a withdrawable breaker when the<br>
permanently installed breaker is converted to a withdrawable<br>
breaker once said busbars have been removed from the permanently<br>
installed breaker, with the result that the conversion of a<br>
permanently installed brealer to a withdrawable breaker entails<br><br>
a minimum amount of complexity in terms of materials since only-<br>
one additional withdrawable part rack is required for this<br>
conversion. Owing to the contact region provided, the busbars<br>
can be arranged directly on the withdrawable part rack. In this<br>
case, the surfaces of the contact region should end evenly with<br>
the surface of the withdrawable part rack with which contact is<br>
to be made. As a result of the fact that the busbars have an<br>
accommodating region for retaining means, it is possible for<br>
them to be permanently provi.ded with a retaining means and, as<br>
a result, to be permanently locked on the withdrawable part<br>
rack of a power breaker.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, both the first and the<br>
second busbar have identical dimensions. This advantageously<br>
makes it possible for the same contact arrangements, which are<br>
preferably in the form of isolating contact arrangements, to be<br>
used both for the first busbar and for the second busbar.<br>
In accordance with a further preferred embodiment, the busbars<br>
can be arranged on the withdrawable part rack such that the<br>
withdrawable part rack has the same installation depth as the<br>
busbars in a permanently installed breaker. This ensures that<br>
the busbars need be arranged permanently on the withdrawable<br>
breaker merely using retaining means in the regions of sald<br>
busbars which are provided 1 or this purpose in order to convert<br>
the permanently installed breaker to a withdrawable breaker. As<br>
a result of the fact that the busbars arranged on a<br>
withdrawable part rack have the same installation depth as the<br>
busbars in the case of a permanently installed breaker, no<br>
further adaptation or conversion work is required.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the busbars are in the<br>
form of plates or blades.<br><br>
The invention will be explained in more detail below with<br>
reference to exemplary embodiments which are at least partially<br>
/<br>
accompanying<br>
figures, in which:<br>
figure 1 shows a low-voltage power breaker according to the<br>
invention which is in the form of a permanently<br>
installed breaker having closed contacts;<br>
figure 2 shows a low-voltage power breaker according to the<br>
invention which is in the form of a permanently<br>
installed breaker having open contacts;<br>
figure 3 shows a low-voltage power breaker according to the<br>
invention having a corresponding withdrawable part<br>
rack, and<br>
figure 4 shows a low-voltage power breaker according to the<br>
invention which is in the form of a withdrawable<br>
breaker.<br>
As can be seen in figure 1, a low-voltage power breaker 10 has<br>
a first contact arrangement 24 which produces a connection<br>
between a first stationary contact 18, which is arranged on a<br>
connection rail 17, and a first busbar 22. Furthermore, the<br>
power breaker 10 has a second contact arrangement 3 4 for the<br>
purpose of connecting a second busbar 3 0 to an opposing contact<br>
16 which is arranged on a contact lever 14. The low-voltage<br>
power breaker 10 is in the form of a permanently installed<br>
breaker in figure 1 by the two busbars 22 and 30, which serve<br>
the purpose of producing a connection to system-side busbars<br>
which are not further illustrated, being fixed to the outside<br>
of the rear wall of the power breaker 10. First retaining means<br>
12, which pass through first accommodating regions 2 0 of the<br>
busbars, are used for this fixing. The connection to the<br>
system-side busbars takes place using second retaining means<br><br>
(not illustrated) which pass through second accommodating<br>
regions 13 of the busbars 22 and 30.<br>
In order to reduce the variety of breaker parts required	and<br>
thus to save on production costs, the connection rail 17	and<br>
the busbars 22 and 30 are of identical design,	the<br>
accommodating region 13 of: the connection rail 17 serving	the<br>
purpose of accommodating a fourth retaining means 15.	The<br>
fourth retaining means 15 serves the purpose of fixing an<br>
arcing horn 19 on the connection rail 17.<br>
The first busbar 22 and the second busbar 30, which according<br>
to the invention have the accommodating region 2 0 for retaining<br>
means and a contact regicn 3 8 for the purpose of arranging the<br>
busbars 22, 3 0 on a withdrawable part rack 11 of the power<br>
breaker 10, make contact with the power breaker 10 with their<br>
side which faces the power breaker 10. The accommodating region<br>
20 is in the form of a through-hole. The contact region 3 8 is<br>
located on that side of the busbars 22, 3 0 which is remote from<br>
the power breaker 10.<br>
The contact region 3 8 makes it possible to remove the busbars<br>
22, 30 according to the invention of a permanently installed<br>
breaker, as illustrated in figure 1 and figure 2, from the<br>
permanently installed breaker and to arrange them on a<br>
withdrawable part rack 11 of a power breaker 10, as is<br>
illustrated in figure 3 Furthermore, the busbars 22, 30 which<br>
are arranged in this manner on the withdrawable part rack 11<br>
can be permanently locked by means of third retaining means 35.<br>
The retaining means being about a permanent, force-fitting<br>
connection between the busbars 22, 30 and the withdrawable part<br>
rack 11 (as is illuscrated in figure 4) by means of the<br>
accommodating regions 2) for retaining means.<br>
As has been described above, conversion of the power breaker<br>
according to the invention from a permanently installed power<br><br>
breaker to a withdrawable power breaker can be realized in a<br>
particularly advantageous manner. The busbars 22, 30, which are<br>
locked<br><br>
and arranged on the withdrawable part rack, of the power<br>
breaker which is in the form of a withdrawable power breaker<br>
advantageously have the same installation depth as the busbars<br>
of a power breaker which is in the form of a permanently<br>
installed breaker, in its operating position. For this purpose,<br>
the busbars 22 and 30 are arranged on the inside of the<br>
withdrawable part rack which is associated with the<br>
withdrawable power breaker such that they make contact with the<br>
power breaker with their side which faces the power breaker<br>
when the withdrawable power breaker is pushed in, as is also<br>
the case with the power breaker in figures 1 and 2 which is<br>
designed for permanent installation.<br>
The position of the busbars 22 and 30 with respect to the<br>
contact arrangements 2 1 and 34 and with respect to the system-<br>
side busbars (not illustrated) is therefore the same in the<br>
case of the power breaker in figures 1 and 2, which is in the<br>
form of a permanently installed power breaker, as in the case<br>
of the power breaker in figures 3 and 4, which is in the form<br>
of a withdrawable power breaker.<br><br>
