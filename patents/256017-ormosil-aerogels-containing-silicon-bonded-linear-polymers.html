This application claims benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Patent<br>
Application 60/534,803, filed January 6,2004, which is hereby incorporated in its entirety as '<br>
if fully set forth.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inventions described herein relate to producing solvent filled,<br>
nanostructured gel monolith and flexible blanket composite sheet materials. These materials<br>
become nanoporous aerogel bodies after all mobile phase solvents are extracted via a process<br>
such as hypercritical solvent extraction (supercritical fluid drying). Formulations and<br>
manufacturing processes relating to the composites and aerogel bodies are provided, along<br>
with methods of using them based on their improved mechanical properties.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Aerogels describe a class of material based upon their structure, namely low<br>
density, open cell structures, large surface areas (often 900 m2/g or higher) and sub-<br>
nanometer scale pore sizes. Supercritical and subcritical fluid extraction technologies are<br>
commonly used to extract the fluid from the fragile cells of the material. A variety of<br>
different aerogel compositions are known and they maybe inorganic, organic and<br>
inorganic/organic hybrid (see N. Husing and U Schubert, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1998, 37,<br>
22-45). Inorganic aerogels are generally based upon metal alkoxides and include materials<br>
such as silica, carbides, and alumina. Organic aerogels include, but are not limited to,<br>
urethane aerogels, resorcinol formaldehyde aerogels, and polyimide aerogels.<br>
Organic/inorganic hybrid aerogel were mainly organically modified silicate (organically<br>
modified silica or "ormosil"). The organic components are covalently bonded to the silica<br>
network. In other words, the organic and inorganic phase are chemically bonded to each<br>
other in the inorganic/organic hybrid aerogels.<br><br>
Low-density aerogel materials (0.01-0.3 g/cc) are widely considered to be the<br>
best solid thermal insulators, better than the best rigid foams with thermal conductivities of<br>
10 mW/m-K and below at 100°F and atmospheric pressure. Aerogels function as thermal<br>
insulators primarily by minimizing conduction (low density, tortuous path for heat transfer<br>
through the solid nanostructure), convection (very small pore sizes rrdniniize convection),<br>
and radiation (IR absorbing or scattering dopants are readily dispersed throughout the aerogel<br>
matrix). Depending on the formulation, they can function well at cryogenic temperatures to<br>
550°C and above. Aerogel materials also display many other interesting acoustic, optical,<br>
mechanical, and chemical properties that make them abundantly useful. The methods<br>
described in this invention represent advances in gel formations that will facilitate production<br>
and improved properties of these aerogel materials.<br>
Low-density insulating materials have been developed to solve a number of<br>
thermal isolation problems in applications in which the core insulation experiences<br>
significant compressive forces. For instance, polymeric materials have been compounded<br>
with hollow glass microspheres to create syntactic foams, which are typically very stiff,<br>
compression resistant materials. Syntactic materials are well known as insulators for<br>
underwater oil and gas pipelines and support equipment. Syntactic materials are relatively<br>
inflexible and of high thermal conductivity relative to flexible aerogel composites (aerogel<br>
matrices reinforced by fiber). Aerogels can be formed from flexible gel precursors. Various<br>
flexible layers, including flexible fiber-reinforced aerogels, can be readily combined and<br>
shaped to give pre-forms that when mechanically compressed along one or more axes, give<br>
compressively strong bodies along any of those axes. Aerogel bodies that are compressed in<br>
this manner exhibit much better thermal insulation values than syntactic foams. Methods to<br>
improve performance of these materials such as density, thermal conductivity and dustiness<br>
will facilitate large-scale use of these materials in underwater oil and gas pipelines as external<br>
insulation.<br>
Silica aerogel monolith will find use as insulating transparencies, such as<br>
double-glazing windows in buildings. Because these gel materials are normally stiff and<br>
inflexible when they are composed of a ceramic or cross-linked polymer matrix material with<br>
 intercalated solvent (gel solvent) in the absence of fiber reinforcement, these materials need<br>
to be handled with great care.<br>
Although the diffusion of polymer chains and subsequent solid network<br>
growth are significantly slowed within the viscous gel structure after the gelation point, the<br><br>
maintenance of the original gel liquid (mother liquor) for a period of time after gelation is<br>
essential to obtaining an aerogel that has the best thermal and mechanical properties. This<br>
period of time that the gel "ages" without disturbance is called "syneresis". Syneresis<br>
conditions (time, temperature, pH, solid concentration) are important to the aerogel product<br>
quality.<br>
Conventional methods for gel monolith and/or fiber-reinforced composite gel<br>
production formed via sol-gel chemistry described in the patent and scientific literature<br>
invariably involve batch casting. Batch casting is defined herein as catalyzing one entire<br>
volume of sol to induce gelation simultaneously throughout that volume. Gel-forming<br>
techniques are well-known to those trained in the art: examples include adjusting the pH<br>
and/or temperature of a dilute metal oxide sol to a point where gelation occurs (R. K. I1er,<br>
Colloid Chemistry of Silica and Silicates, 1954, chapter 6; R. K. Her, The Chemistry of<br>
Silica, 1979, chapter 5, C. J. Brinker and G. W. Scherer, Sol-Gel Science, 1990, chapters 2<br>
and 3). Suitable materials for forming inorganic aerogels are oxides of most of the metals<br>
that can form oxides, such as silicon, aluminum, titanium, zirconium, hafnium, yttrium,<br>
vanadium, and the like. Particularly preferred are gels formed primarily from alcohol<br>
 solutions of hydrolyzed silicate esters due to their ready availability and low cost (alcogel).<br>
It is also well known to those trained in the art that organic aerogels can be<br>
made from melamine formaldehydes, resorcinol formaldehydes, and the like (see for instance<br>
N. Husing and U Schubert, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1998,37,22-45).<br>
The availability of fiber reinforced aerogel composites opened up many<br>
application areas for aerogel materials. Since large pieces of aerogel composite materials<br>
have been successfully manufacture by this method, which can be widely used in all type of<br>
thermal and acoustic insulation applications. Yet it is inherently impossible to produce<br>
transparent aerogel composite, due to the presence of macro scale phase separation in these<br>
materials. A different reinforcement method is needed to produce stronger transparent<br>
aerogel monoliths, for the other insulation applications such as insulating transparencies in<br>
double glazing windows. In the past two decades, many investigators have attempted to<br>
improve the mechanical properties of silica in order to reduce its tendency to crack during the<br>
formation of its monoliths, by the incorporation of a secondly polymeric phase directly<br>
bonded to silica network. These led to the formations of numerous ormosil type of inorganic<br>
organic hybrid materials. Some of the most noticeable examples are as follows:<br><br>
H. Schmidt, J. Non-Cryst. Solid, 73, 681,1985, reported the incremental<br>
improvement of the mechanical properties of silica xerogel by the incorporation of PMMA or<br>
epoxy based polymer.<br>
Mackenzie, et. al. J. Non-Crystalline solid 147&amp;148 (1992), 271-279, J.<br>
Mater. Science, 27, (1992), 4415-4420, Mark, et al. Macromolecules, (1984), 11, 2613-2616,<br>
Macromolecules, 20, (1987), 1322-1330, O. Foussaier, M. Menetrier, J. Videau, E. Duguet,<br>
Mater. Lett. 42, 305, 2000, reported the improvement of the tensile properties of silica<br>
xerogel, by the incorporation of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) linear polymer.<br>
H. Huang, G. L.Wilkes and J. G. Carlson, Polymer, 30, 1989,2001-2012,<br>
reported the improvement on the tensile properties of silica xerogel by the incorporation of<br>
polyurethane linear polymer in the silioxane network.<br>
It has been claimed that linear polymer such as PDMS appear to increase the<br>
flexible properties of the rigid silica aerogels. (S. J. Kramer, F. Rubio-Alonso and J. D.<br>
Mackenzie, MRS Proc. Vol 435,295-300,1996).<br>
To distinguish between aerogels and xerogels, it is pointed out that aerogels<br>
are a unique class of materials characterized by their low densities, high pore volumes, and<br>
nanometer pore sizes. Because of the high pore volumes and nanometer pore sizes of<br>
aerogels, they typically have high surface areas and low thermal conductivities. The high<br>
porosity leads to a low solid thermal conductivity, and the nanometer pore sizes cause partial<br>
suppression of gaseous thermal conduction because the cells are smaller than the mean free<br>
path of gases. This structural morphology of an aerogel is a major advantage in thermal<br>
insulation applications. For instance, thermal conductivities have been measured to be less<br>
than 20 mW/m-K (J. Fricke and T. Tillotson, Thin Solid Films, 297 (1997) 212-223), and<br>
sometimes as low as 10-12 mW/m-K, at ambient conditions for silica aerogels. Thermal<br>
conductivities as low as 8-10 mW/m-K for organic aerogels (such as those composed of<br>
resorcinol-formaldehyde) have been measured. (R. W. Pekala and L. W. Hrubesh,<br>
US5731360). This is in sharp contrast to xerogels, which have higher densities than aerogels<br>
and are used as a coating such as a dielectric coating.<br>
The sol-gel process has been used to synthesize a large variety of inorganic<br>
and hybrid inorganic-organic xerogels, aerogels and nanocomposite materials. Relevant<br>
precursor materials for silica based aerogel synthesis include, but are not limited to, sodium<br>
silicates, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), tetramethylorthosilicate (TMOS), monomeric<br>
alkylalkoxy silanes, bis trialkoxy alkyl or aryl silanes, polyhedral silsesquioxanes, and others.<br><br>
Various polymers have been incorporated into silica gels to improve mechanical properties of<br>
the resulting gels, xerogels (see J. D. Mackenzie, Y. J. Chung and Y. Hu, J. Non-Crystalline<br>
solid 147&amp;148 (1992), 271-279; and Y. Hu and J. D. Mackenzie. J. Mater. Science, 27,<br>
(1992)), and aerogels (see S. J. Kramer, F. Rubio-Alonso and J. D. Mackenzie, MRS Proc.<br>
Vol 435, 295-300, 1996). Aerogels are obtained when the gels are dried in a manner that<br>
does not alter or causes minimal changes to the structure of the wet gel. This is typically<br>
accomplished by removing the solvent phase from the gel above the critical point of the<br>
solvent or mixture of solvents if a co-solvent is used to aid the drying process.<br>
Wet gels frequently exhibit structures with mass fractal features consisting of<br>
co-continuous solid and pore liquid phases where the pore liquid phase can occupy as much<br>
as 98% of the sample volume. Aerogels have structures that are very similar to that of the<br>
original gel because they are dried by supercritical processes that minimize or eliminate<br>
capillary forces that cause the gel structure to collapse. The structure of xerogels, in contrast,<br>
is significantly modified during drying due to the capillary forces acting on the solid network<br>
during the evaporative drying process. The magnitude of the capillary pressure exerted on<br>
the solid network during evaporation is inversely proportional to pore dimensions (e.g. pore<br>
radius), and thus can be extremely large when pore features are in the nanometer (10-9<br>
meters) range. These surface tension forces created during evaporative drying cause the gel<br>
network to fold or condense during xerogel manufacture as the coordination number of the<br>
particles increases.<br>
Stated differently, a xerogel is formed upon conventional drying of wet gels,<br>
that is by increase in temperature or decrease in pressure with concomitant large shrinkage<br>
(and mostly destruction) of the initially uniform gel body. This large shrinkage of a gel body<br>
upon evaporation of the pore liquid is caused by capillary forces acting on the pore walls as<br>
the liquid retreats into the gel body. This results in the collapse of the filigrane, the highly<br>
porous inorganic network of the wet gels. Collapse of the structure stops when the gel<br>
network becomes sufficiently strong to resist the compressive forces caused by the surface<br>
tension.<br>
The resulting xerogel typically has a close packing globular structure and no<br>
 larger pores observable by TEM, which suggests that they are space filling. Thus the dried<br>
xerogel structure (which comprises both the skeletal and porous phases) is a contracted and<br>
distorted version of the original wet gel's structure. Because of the difference in drying<br>
procedures, xerogels and aerogels have very different structures and material properties. For<br><br>
instance, the number of reactive groups directly associated with a typical Si atom is<br>
significantly higher on average in an aerogel structure (dried supercritically) than in the<br>
corresponding xerogel structure made with the same starting formulation but dried<br>
evaporatively. Stated differently, the solutions or mixtures generally used to prepare a<br>
xerogel cannot be used to prepare an aerogel simply by altering the drying conditions because<br>
the resultant product will not automatically have a density of an aerogel. Thus there are<br>
fundamental compositional differences between xerogels and aerogels that greatly affects<br>
their surface area, reactivity, pore volume, thermal conductivity, compressibility, mechanical<br>
strength, modulus, and many other properties.<br>
Thus compared to xerogels, aerogels are expanded structures that often more<br>
closely resemble to the structure of wet gel. TEM micrographs of aerogels often reveal a<br>
tenuous assemblage of clusters that bound large interstitial cavities. Porosity measurement<br>
by nitrogen sorption also reveals the structural difference in nanometer size level, compared<br>
to the corresponding xerogel, the aerogel often contains over twice the pore volume and<br>
average the pore size is considerably greater as is evident from the larger amount of<br>
adsorption that occurs at high relative pressures (&gt;0.9). See C. J. Brinker and G. W. Scherer,<br>
Sol-Gel Science, 1990, Chapter 9. Due to the structural difference between aerogel and<br>
xerogels, there is significant difference in the physical properties of these two classes of<br>
materials, such as dielectric constant, thermal conductivities, etc. Therefore, and even if of<br>
identical elemental composition, an aerogel and its corresponding xerogel are completely<br>
different materials, somewhat analogous to sugar granules and cotton candy, both of which<br>
are composed of the same sugar molecules.<br>

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides methods for producing solvent filled,<br>
nanostructured gel monolith as well as flexible blanket composite sheet materials produced<br>
therefrom via fiber reinforcement. The composite sheets result after all mobile phase<br>
solvents are extracted using a hypercritical solvent extraction (supercritical fluid drying).<br>
This novel organically modified silica (sometimes referred to as an "ormosil") formulation<br><br>
can lead to the improvement of various physical and mechanical properties in the resulting<br>
aerogel monolith and aerogel composite.<br>
The ormosil matrix materials described in this invention are best derived from<br>
sol-gel processing, preferably composed of polymers (inorganic, organic, or<br>
inorganic/organic hybrid) that define a structure with very small pores (on the order of<br>
billionths of a meter). Fibrous materials added prior to the point of polymer gelation<br>
reinforce the matrix materials described in this invention. The preferred fiber reinforcement<br>
is preferably a lofty fibrous structure (batting of web), but may also include individual<br>
randomly oriented short microfibers, and woven or non-woven fibers. More particularly,<br>
preferred fiber reinforcements are based upon either organic (e.g. thermoplastic polyester,<br>
high strength carbon, aramid, high strength oriented polyethylene), low-temperature<br>
inorganic (various metal oxide glasses such as E-glass), or refractory (e.g. silica, alumina,<br>
aluminum phosphate, aluminosilicate, etc.) fibers.<br>
Thus in a first aspect, the invention provides ormosil aerogels containing a<br>
linear polymer as a reinforcing component within the structure of the aerogel. The preferred<br>
embodiment is to have the polymer covalently bonded to the inorganic structures. The<br>
present invention is thus based on the linear polymer reinforcement concept. A number of<br>
different linear polymers have been incorporated into the silica network to improve the<br>
mechanical properties of the resulting ormosils. Transparent monoliths more compliant than<br>
silica aerogels have been produced. They are strong enough to resistant the tendency of<br>
cracking during wet gel handling and extraction. The improvement in elasticity of these<br>
ormosil materials also improve the flexibility and reduce its dustiness in its fiber-reinforced<br>
composite. The formulation describe in this invention thus improves the flexibility of the gel<br>
monolith, which will lead to the improvement on the handling of monolith during aerogel<br>
productions.<br>
The invention thus provides for the incorporation of flexible nano<br>
reinforcement component into silica network to improve the tensile properties of the resulting<br>
aerogel monolith. This reduces the chance of cracking caused by the brittleness of silica.<br>
The improvement of the elasticity of silica aerogel will also reduce its tendency to break apart<br>
from the fiber in the fiber reinforcement composite aerogel, leading to the reduction of<br>
dustiness of the aerogel composite material.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for co-condensation<br>
of trialkoxysilyl end capped linear polymer with a silica precursor, such as (but not limited<br><br>
to) hydrolyzed tetraalkoxysilane, via a sol-gel process. The flexible linear polymeric chain is<br>
thus covalently bonded into the rigid silica network, as illustrated in Figure 1. The<br>
introduction of the organic polymeric phase will not lead to phase separation in the resulting<br>
ormosil gel. Unlike most ormosil materials, this ormosil gel with low polymer content<br>
(
flexibility of the family of ormosil gels provided by the present invention will improve the<br>
ease of handling their monolith counterparts during the preparation process, and reduce to<br>
tendency of cracking during CO2 extraction.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention also provides a method for making a linear<br>
polymer bonded ormosil fiber reinforced flexible composite. The introduction of silicon<br>
bonded linear polymers further increases the flexibility of the resulting aerogel composite.<br>
The dustiness of the silica aerogel composite caused by the brittleness of silica material can<br>
also be reduce significantly in this case, without sacrificing other inherent properties of the<br>
aerogel materials, such as low thermal conductivity and low density.<br>
Thus the invention provides an organically modified silica (ormosil) aerogel<br>
composition comprising an ormosil aerogel reinforced with linear polymer (or linear polymer<br>
chains). Such a composition has a linear polymer covalently bonded at one or both ends to<br>
the silica network of the aerogel through a C-Si bond between a carbon atom of the polymer<br>
and a silicon atom of the network. The polymer may be covalently bonded at both ends to<br>
one silicon containing molecule of the network, and thus be intramolecularly linked, or<br>
covalently bonded at the two ends to two separate silicon containing molecules of the<br>
network, and thus be intermolecularly linked. The invention of course includes compositions<br>
with both intramolecularly and intermolecularly linked polymers. An aerogel of the<br>
invention preferably has a density from about 0.01 to about 0.3 g/cc, preferably about 0.02, or<br>
about 0.05, or about 0.1,or about 0.15 or about 0.2, or about 0.25 g/cc.<br>
The linear polymer chains are trialkoxysilylterminated and may be a member<br>
of the polyether family or selected from trialkoxysilylterminated polydimethylsiloxane,<br>
polyoxyalkylene, polyureane, polybutadiane, polyoxypropylene, or polyoxylpropylene-<br>
copolyoxyethylene. Stated differently, the linked linear polymer may be generated from a<br>
trialkoxysilyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane, trialkoxysilyl terminated polyoxyalkylene,<br>
trialkoxysilyl terminated polyurethane, trialkoxysilyl terminated polybutadiene, trialkoxysilyl<br>
teiminated polyoxypropylene, trialkoxysilyl terminated polyoxypropylene-<br>
copolyoxyethylene, or trialkoxysilyl terminated members of the polyether family.<br><br>
The alkoxy groups in the terminal trialkoxysilyl moieties contain less than<br>
about 4 carbons. Thus the alkoxy groups in the terminal trialkoxysilyl moieties are<br>
preferably selected from methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, or butoxy.<br>
The chain lengths have an average molecular weight ranging from about 200<br>
to about 1,000,000 or from about 300 to about 10,000 or from about 400 to about 9000 or<br>
from about 500 to about 8000 or from about 600 to about 7000 or from about 700 to about<br>
6000 or from about 800 to about 5000 or from about 900 to about 4000 or from about 1000 to<br>
about 3000 or about 2000. The weight percentage of the polymer chains may range (w/w)<br>
from about 1 to about 49 or 50%, about 3 to about 30%, about 5 to about 25%, about 7 to<br>
about 20%, about 9 to about 15%, or about 10 to about 13%. Preferred embodiments have<br>
less than 50%, such as from about 1 to less than 50%, about 1 to about 45%, about 1 to about<br>
40%, about 1 to about 35%, about 1 to about 30%, about 1 to about 25%, about 1 to about<br>
20%, about 1 to about 15%, about 1 to about 10% or about 1 to about 5%.<br>
The invention also provides a method of preparing an aerogel composition of<br>
the invention by reacting a trialkoxysilyl terminated linear polymer with a silica precursor at<br>
ambient temperature and conditions as described herein. Preferably, the trialkoxysilyl<br>
terminated linear polymer is prepared by a method comprising reacting 3-isocyanatopropyl<br>
triethoxylsilane with an amino (NH) terminated linear polymer in a suitable solvent at<br>
ambient temperature. Solvents free of OH or NH moieties are preferred. Examples of the<br>
solvent include THF, ether dioxane and others Anhydrous alcohols can be used in limited<br>
cases where the resulting product are to be used in a short period of time. The concentration<br>
of the 3-isocyanatopropyl triethoxylsilane is at least about 1% w/w, but preferably higher<br>
than about 50% w/w, which allows for a fast reaction at ambient temperature. Preferred<br>
amine terminated linear polymers include amine terminated polyoxyethylene-co-<br>
polyoxypropylene, amine terminated polyoxyethylene, and amine terminated<br>
polyoxypropylene.<br>
Additionally, the invention provides a method of preparing trialkoxysilyl<br>
terminated linear polymer, by reacting 3-glycidoxypropyl triethoxylsilane with NH<br>
terminated linear polymer in a non-reactive solvent. Hydrocarbon solvents free of OH or NH<br>
moieties are the preferred solvents for the reaction. The NH terminated linear polymer is<br>
preferably an amine terminated polyether such as amine terminated polyoxyethelene-co-<br>
polyoxylpropylene, amine terminated polyoxyethelene, or amine terminated<br>
polyoxylpropylene.<br><br>
Moreover, the invention provides a method of preparing trialkoxysilyl<br>
terminated linear polymer, by reacting 3-isocyanatopropyl triethoxylsilane with OH<br>
terminated linear polymer in a suitable solvent. Hydrocarbon solvents free of OH or NH<br>
moieties are the preferred solvents for the reaction. The OH terminated linear polymer may<br>
be, but is not limit to, dihydroxyl terminated polybutadiene, polyethylene glycol,<br>
polypropylene glycol. The concentration of the 3-isocyanatopropyl triethoxylsilane is at least<br>
about 1% w/w, but preferably higher than about 50% w/w, which allows for a fast reaction at<br>
ambient temperature. Preferred hydroxy terminated linear polymers include dihydroxyl<br>
terminated polybutadiene, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol.<br>
The invention further provides a method of preparing trialkoxysilyl terminated<br>
linear polymer, by reacting amrnopropyl triethoxylsilane or aminopropyl trimethoxylsilane<br>
with isocyanate terminated linear polymer in a non-reactive solvent. Hydrocarbon solvents<br>
free of OH or NH moieties are the preferred solvents for the reaction. The isocyanate<br>
terminated linear polymer may be, but is not limited to, polyhexamethylene diisocyanate and<br>
potymethyldiphenyldiisocyanate.<br>
Further still, the invention provides a method of co-condensing trialkoxysilyl<br>
terminated linear polymer with a silica precursor, such as, but not limited to, hydrolyzed<br>
tetramethoxysilane. The method may be advantageously used to prepare a transparent, or<br>
translucent (incompletely transparent) aerogel as described below. A transparent ormosil gel<br>
monolith with about 1 to about 20 weight % (preferably about 5 to about 10%) loading of<br>
linear polymer was formed after the addition of condensation catalyst, according to the<br>
scheme illustrated in Figure 1. The catalyst may be NH4OH, NH4F, HF, or HC1 as non-<br>
limiting examples. The monolith remains transparent after CO2 supercritical extraction.<br>
Non-limiting examples of the silica precursor include alkoxysilanes and partially hydrolyzed<br>
alkoxysilanes. The alkoxysilane maybe selected from tetraethoxylsilane, tetramethoxysilane,<br>
and tetra-n-propoxysilane as non-limiting examples. Partially hydrolyzed alkoxysilanes<br>
include, but are not limited to, Silbond H5, Silbond 40 and its product family; Dynasil 40 and<br>
its family product.<br>
The highly transparent material has up to 90% or more transmittance in the<br>
visible spectrum for thicknesses between 0.5 and 1.5cm. The composition would include a<br>
linear polymer as described herein without decreasing the optical quality of the resulting<br>
aerogel. Preferably, the weight % of linear polymer should be less than about 30%, less than<br>
about 25%, less than about 20%, less than about 15%, less than about 10%, or less than about<br><br>
5% in the composition. The resultant highly transparent monolith may have high recovery<br>
strain up to 95% or more (or up to about 90% or more, or up to about 85% or more) under<br>
20% compression. The improved compressive and flexural resilience of the gel compositions<br>
described by the invention allow for creation of larger crack free monolithic structures<br>
compared to pure silica aerogel produced under the same processing conditions. This<br>
improvement offers a significant advantage for producing crack-free transparencies such as<br>
insulated window inserts between glazings and the like. Preferably, such an aerogel of the<br>
invention has thermal conductivity between about 10 and about 16 mW/m.K under ambient<br>
conditions<br>
In a typical silica aerogel, silica networks when exposed to normal<br>
mechanical handling conditions can disintegrate to a small extent making the resultant<br>
aerogel product dusty. The invention thus further provides a gel composition which is less<br>
dusty under mechanical handling conditions compared to silica aerogel. The polymer grafted<br>
silica aerogel material may also be fiber reinforced, with low dust properties and thermal<br>
conductivity between about 10 to about 16 mW/m-K (including about 11, about 12, about 13,<br>
about 14, and about 15 mW/m-K).<br>
The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the<br>
accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages<br>
of the invention will be apparent from the drawings and detailed description, and from the<br>
claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF MODES OF PRACTICING THE INVENTION<br>
The linear polymer for use in the present invention includes, but is not limited<br>
to, trialkoxylsilyl terminated polydimethosiloxane, polyether, polyethylene, polypropylene,<br>
polyester, polyurethane, polyalcohol, polybutadiene, etc.<br>
There are multiple ways to terminate, or end cap, linear polymer with<br>
trialkoxysilyl functions. As a non-limiting example, SiH terminated polydimethysiloxane can<br>
react with vinyltrialkoxysilane in the presence of Pt catalyst to form trialkoxysilyl terminated<br>
polydimethysiloxane, similarly, Si-Vinyl terminated polydimethysiloxane can react with<br>
trichlorosilane under the presence of Pt catalyst to form trialkoxysilyl terminated<br>
polydimethysiloxane.<br>
Linear polymer chains maybe end capped with trialkoxysilyl functions<br>
through the formation of polyurea linkages as part of the present invention.<br>
Polyhexamethylene diisocyanate (PHD1) was reacted with 3-aminopropyltrimethoxylsilane<br>
or 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane to form trialkoxysilyl terminated polyhexamethylene.<br>
Polymethyldiphenyldiisocyanate (PMDI) was reacted with 3-arninopropyltrrmethoxylsilane<br>
or 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane to form trialkoxysilyl terminated Polymethyldiphenyllene.<br>
An OH terminated polymer chain such as one of the polyol family can be end<br>
capped by trialkoxysilane, via reaction with 3-isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane. The polyol<br>
family includes, but is not limited to, dihydroxyl terminated polybutadiene, polyethylene<br>
glycol, and polypropylene glycol.<br>
Amine terminated polyethers were used herein as non-limiting examples. This<br>
class of linear polymers are commercially available from Huntsman corporation under the<br>
trade name of Jeffamine® series of products. The general structure for these polyethers is<br>
illustrated in Figure 2. The amine groups are situated in both ends of the polyether chain. In<br>
the multi-arnine substituted polyether JeffamineT series, additional amine groups will graft as<br>
a side group on the polyether chain, as well as end capped in both ends of the polyether chain.<br>
The average molecular weight of these amine terminated polyethers are from about 100 to<br>
about 1,000,000. Preferred molecular weights for use in the invention are in the range of<br>
about 50 to about 10,000 (while molecular weights of about 100, about 500, about 1000,<br>
about 2000, about 4000, and about 8000 may also be used). Amine terminated<br>
polyoxypropylenes with 2000 and 4000 weight average molecular weight (Jeffamine®<br>
D2000 and Jeffamine® XTJ-510), and amine terrninated polyoxyethlene-co-<br><br>
polyoxypropylenes with 600 weight average molecular weight (Jeffamine® XTJ500) were<br>
used for the preparations as illustrated in some of the examples below.<br>
3-Glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane and 3-Isocyanatopropyl triethxoylsilane<br>
are used in the present invention to convert the terminating amine group into triethoxysilyl<br>
moieties. 3-Isocyanatopropyl triethxoylsilane was used for the production of many of the<br>
examples herein. In this case, a urea bridge was formed to ensure the polyether chains of<br>
variable lengths were grafted to the sol-gel active triethoxysilyl group. The reaction between<br>
3-isocyanatopropyl triethxoylsilane and amine terminated polyether is illustrated in Figure 3.<br>
OH or NH free anhydrous ether, THF, hexane, dioxane, toluene, pentane, benzene were used<br>
as described herein for this reaction, with THF and dioxane as preferred solvents.<br>
The above urea formation was conducted at room temperature within 1 hour.<br>
The completion of this reaction is detectable by IR spectroscopy as the disappearance of the<br>
isocyanate band at 2274 cm"1.<br>
To ensure a fast reaction at ambient temperature, the reactant concentration in<br>
THF solution should be in the range between about 5 to about 95%, preferably from about 40<br>
to about 70%, about 50 to about 60%, or about 55%.<br>
Generally the principal synthetic route for the formation of an ormosil<br>
(organically modified silica) aerogel is the hydrolysis and condensation of an appropriate<br>
silicon alkoxide, together with an organotrialkoxysilane. The most suitable silicon alkoxides<br>
are those having about 1 to about 6 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to about 3 carbon atoms<br>
in each alkyl group. Specific examples of such compounds include tetraethoxysilane<br>
(TEOS), tetramethoxysilane (TMOS), and tetra-n-propoxysilane. These materials can also be<br>
partially hydrolyzed and stabilized at low pH as polymers of polysilicic acid esters such as<br>
polydiethoxysiloxane. These materials are commercially available in alcohol solution, for<br>
example Silbond®40, Silbond®25, Silbond® H5. Higher molecular weight silicone resin<br>
can also be used in this ormosil formulation. The silicone resin includes, but is not limit to,<br>
Dow Corning Fox series, Dow Corning Z6075, Dow Corning MQ, etc. Due to the presence<br>
of the highly reactive trialkoxysilyl end group, the co-condensation of these linear polymers<br>
with silica precursor was very effective, no additional energy such as heat and other form of<br>
 radiation is needed to assist the incorporation of this linear polymer into the silica network.<br>
It is understood to those skilled in the art that gel materials formed using the<br>
sol-gel process can be derived from a wide variety of metal oxide or other polymer forming<br>
species. It is also well known that sols can be doped with solids (IR opacifiers, sintering<br><br>
retardants, microfibers) that influence the physical and mechanical properties of the gel<br>
product. Suitable amounts of such dopants generally range from about 1 to about 40% by<br>
weight of the finished composite, preferably about 2 to about 30 % using the casting methods<br>
of this invention.<br>
Variable parameters in the ormosil aerogel formation process include the type<br>
of alkoxide, solution pH, and alkoxide/alcohol/water ratio, and the mole ratio of the<br>
organotrialkoxysilane/silica precursor. Control of the parameters can permit control of the<br>
growth and aggregation of the matrix species throughout the transition from the "sol" state to<br>
the "gel" state. While properties of the resulting aerogels are strongly affected by the mole<br>
ratio of the organotrialkoxysilane/silica precursor, any molar ratio that permits the formation<br>
of gels may be used in the present invention.<br>
Generally, the solvent will be a lower alcohol, i.e. an alcohol having 1 to 6<br>
carbon atoms, preferably 2 to 4, although other equivalent solvents can be used as is known<br>
in the art. Examples of other useful liquids include, but are not limited to, ethyl acetate, ethyl<br>
acetoacetate, acetone, dichloromethane, and the like.<br>
For convenience, the alcogel route of forming ormosil gels and composites is<br>
provided below as a representative embodiment to illustrate how to create the precursors<br>
utilized by the invention. This is not intended to limit the present invention to the<br>
incorporation of any specific type of linear polymer into silica network. The invention is<br>
applicable to other ormosils with other similar concept structures.<br>
After identification of the gel material to be prepared using the methods of this<br>
invention, a suitable silica alkoxide/triethoxylsilyl grafted polyether linear alcohol solution is<br>
prepared. The preparation of silica aerogel-forming solutions is well known in the art. See,<br>
for example, S.J. Teichner et al, Inorganic Oxide Aerogel, Advances in Colloid and Interface<br>
Science, Vol. 5,1976, pp 245-273, and L.D. LeMay, et al., Low-Density Microcellular<br>
Materials, MRS Bulletin, Vol. 15,1990, p 19. For producing ormosil gel monoliths, typically<br>
preferred ingredients are tetramethoxysilane (TMOS), triethoxysilyl grafted linear polyether<br>
(TESGP) water, and methanol (MeOH). The preferred ratio of TMOS to water is about 0.2<br>
to about 10:1, the preferred ratio of TMOS to MeOH is about 0.02 to about 0.5:1, and the<br>
preferred TMOS/TESGP ratio is about 1 to about 10/1. The natural pH of a solution of the<br>
ingredients is about 5. While any acid may be used to obtain a lower pH solution, HC1,<br>
H2SO4 or HF are preferred acids. To generate a higher pH, NH4OH is the preferred base.<br><br>
A transparent ormosil gel monolith with about 1 to about 20-weight % loading<br>
of linear polyether was formed after the addition of condensation catalyst. The catalyst may<br>
be NH4OH, NH4F, HF, or HC1 as non-limiting examples. The monolith will remain<br>
transparent after CO2 supercritical extraction. The resulting ormosil aerogel monoliths have<br>
density range from about 0.05 to about 0.30, and thermal conductivity range from about 12 to<br>
about 16 mW/m .K. The maximum dimension of transparent crack-free ormosil aerogel<br>
monolith was 11.5x11.5x0.5 (inches) with multiple smaller volumes that were crack-free.<br>
The highly transparent material has up to 90% or more transmittance in the visible spectrum<br>
for thicknesses between 0.5 and 1.5cm<br>
For fiber-reinforced containing ormosil aerogel composites, pre-polymerized<br>
silica precursors (e.g. Silbond® 40 and its family) are preferred as the silica precursor. The<br>
effect of the other variation factors is similar to those in the preparation of ormosil monoliths.<br>
As used herein, a lofty batting is defined as a fibrous material that shows the<br>
properties of bulk and some resilience (with or without full bulk recovery). Non-limiting<br>
examples of lofty battings that may be used are described in published U.S. Patent<br>
Application document US 2002/0094426. In preferred embodiments of the invention, a<br>
batting for use in the present invention is "lofty" if it contains sufficiently few individual<br>
filaments (or fibers) that it does not significantly alter the thermal properties of the reinforced<br>
composite as compared to a non-reinforced aerogel body of the same material. Generally,<br>
and upon looking at a cross-section of a final aerogel composite comprising such batting, the<br>
cross-sectional area of the fibers is less than about 10% of the total surface area of that cross<br>
section, preferably less than about 8%, and most preferably less than about 5%.<br>
The preferred form is a soft web of this material. The use of a lofty batting<br>
reinforcement material minimizes the volume of unsupported aerogel while avoiding<br>
substantial degradation of the thermal performance of the aerogel. Batting preferably refers<br>
to layers or sheets of a fibrous material, commonly used for lining quilts or for stuffing or<br>
packaging or as a blanket of thermal insulation.<br>
Batting materials that have some tensile strength are advantageous for<br>
introduction to the conveyor casting system, but are not required. Load transfer mechanisms<br>
can be utilized in the process to introduce delicate batting materials to the conveyor region<br>
prior to infiltration with prepared sol flow.<br>
Suitable fibrous materials for forming both the lofty batting and the x-y<br>
oriented tensile strengthening layers include any fiber-forming material. Particularly suitable<br><br>
materials include: fiberglass, quartz, polyester (PET), polyethylene, polypropylene,<br>
polybenzimid-azole (PBI), polyphenylenebenzo-bisoxasole (PBO), polyetherether ketone<br>
(PEEK), polyarylate, polyacrylate, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), poly-metaphenylene<br>
diamine (Nomex), poly-paraphenylene terephthalamide (Kevlar), ultra high molecular weight<br>
polyethylene (UHMWPE) e.g. SpectraTM, novoloid resins (Kynol), polyacrylonitrile (PAN),<br>
PAN/carbon, and carbon fibers.<br>
Having now generally described the invention, the same will be more readily<br>
understood through reference to the following examples which are provided by way of<br>
illustration, and are not intended to be limiting of the present invention, unless specified.<br>

were first aged in ammonia ethanol solution (4.85wt%) at ambient temperature and<br>
subsequently in an ethanolic solution of hexamethyldisilazane (5% v/v) solution for 1 day at<br>
ambient temperature. The average thermal conductivity of the fiber-reinforced aerogel<br>

of ethanol, following by 2 hours mixing at ambient temperature. After addition of 3.0g of<br>
 ammonia ethanol solution (15.4wt % ammonia) to catalyze gelation, the mixture was<br>
infiltrated into a 3M G80 polyester fiber batting sheet (prior to gelation). The resultant gels<br>
were first aged in ammonia ethanol solution (4.85wt%) for 1 day at ambient temperature,<br>
followed by aging for 1 day in an ethanolic solution of hexamethyldisilazane (5% v/v) at<br><br>
ambient temperature. The average thermal conductivity of the fiber reinforced aerogel<br>
coupons was 12.0 mW/m-K under ambient conditions, and the average density of these<br>
coupons was 0.08 g/cm3.<br>
Example 12.<br>
This example illustrates the formation of a triethoxysilyl terminated polyether<br>
from polyether polyol, 40g of 3-isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane (Aldrich) was added to a<br>
mixture of 200g of polyether polyol (Arcol® R-2744, Mn=2200, commercially available<br>
from Lyondell corporation), 100ml of anhydrous THF, and 0.05g of dibubutyltim dilaurate.<br>
The above mixtures were fluxed at 85 to 95°C for 8 hours. The completion of this reaction<br>
can be monitored by IR spectroscopy. It was observed that the strong and narrow band at<br>
2274 cm" assigned to the vibration of isocyanate group of the to 3-<br>
isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane disappeared at the end of the reaction. Example 12 serves as<br>
an exemplary source of the linear polymer.<br>
Example 13.<br>
This example illustrates the formation of a polyether modified silica aerogel<br>
fiber reinforced composite with 20wt% loadings of polyether (Mn 2200). 17.2g of water<br>
were added to a mixture of 72.0g Silbond®H5, 4.94 g of the polymer from Example 12 and<br>
125g of ethanol, following by 1 hour mixing at ambient temperature. After addition of 3.5g<br>
of aqueous ammonia (28-30% by weight of NH3, Aldrich) and 75g of ethanol, the mixture<br>
was infiltrated into a 3M G80 polyester batting fiber sheet prior to gelation (4.5 minutes in<br>
this example). The resultant gels were aged in an ethanolic solution of hexamethyldisilazane<br>
(5% v/v) for 1 day at ambient temperature before COz supercritical extraction. The average<br>
thermal conductivity of the fiber-reinforced aerogel coupons was 13.7 mW/m*K under<br>
ambient conditions, and the average density of these coupons was 0.10 g/cm .<br>
