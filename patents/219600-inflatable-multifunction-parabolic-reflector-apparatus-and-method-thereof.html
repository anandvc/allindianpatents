b.       Advantages Thereover<br>
The instant device is superior to the related art in at least six very significant respects. First, the instant device is superior to the related art as a result of its highly multifunctional, multi-purpose nature. It is noted that both the first and second embodiments of the instant device have numerous electromagnetic and (non-electromagnetic) utilities. In contrast, all related art is significantly more limited with respect to utilities and applications thereof.<br>
7<br><br>
Second, the instant device is superior to the related art as a result of its extremely lightweight and compactly foldable construction, which greatly facilitates portage and storage. As an example, note that a pocket-sized version of the instant device with a mass of approximately 125 grams and measuring only 9. Ocm by12. Ocm by 1.0 cm when fully collapsed can be inflated to yield a fully deployed device having a 120cm diameter primary reflector providing 1000 watts of highly concentrated broad-spectrum radiant energy when utilized terrestrially as a solar concentrator device.<br>
It is noted that such a device can thus provide an unprecedented mass-specific power output approximating 8000 watts per kilogram.<br>
Third, the instant device is superior to the related art as a result of its precisely pre-formed reflective membranes and other optional features, which greatly increase the operational safety of the device. More specifically, the use of pre¬formed parabolic reflective membranes (instead of planar membranes as generally used in related art) allows the device to have (and can limit the device to) relatively short focal lengths, thereby enabling the user to maintain greater control over the location of any potentially dangerous, high concentrations of radiant energy.<br>
In addition, the use of pre-formed, non-parabolic reflective membranes may be used to limit the degree of energy concentration to safer levels. Furthermore, the use of optional integral safety cages and covers reduces the risk of accidental exposure to high concentrations of electromagnetic radiation.<br>
Fourth, the instant device is superior to the related art in that it is easier to deploy (inflate) as a result of its preformed reflective membranes. Note that by using pre¬formed reflective membranes, such reflective membranes can be fully deployed<br>
8<br><br>
using significantly less differential pressure across the membranes, thereby facilitating proper inflation.<br>
Fifth, the first embodiment of the instant device is more efficient in that it eliminates a plurality of losses inherent in the super-ambient reflector chamber designs of the related art.<br>
Note that by employing a sub-ambient pressure reflector chamber in the first embodiment of the instant device, sunlight or other electromagnetic radiation can travel, unobstructed, from the energy source to the reflector and then to the target.<br>
Accordingly, the first embodiment of the instant device causes no (zero) losses of radiant electromagnetic energy as such energy travels to and from the reflector. In contrast, in the related art, sunlight or other electromagnetic radiation must pass through the transparent membrane of the super-ambient reflector chamber on its way to and from the reflector, thereby resulting in a plurality of losses. These losses include the reflection, absorption, and diffusion of electromagnetic radiation as it travels to and from the reflector.<br>
In greater detail, as light travels to the reflector, some of the light is reflected by the outer surface of the transparent membrane, through which the light must pass on its way to the reflector. As the remaining light travels through the thickness of the transparent membrane, additional energy is absorbed and/or diffused as a result of molecular interaction. Next, as the remaining light reaches the interior surface of the transparent membrane, additional light is reflected back through the membrane because of a difference between the indices of refraction of the transparent membrane and the gas (typically air) inside the reflector chamber. These three processes are repeated for light that has been reflected off<br>
9<br><br>
the mirror, thus resulting in a total of six significant transmission losses. Furthermore, light which does manage to successfully pass through the transparent membrane is still subject to unwanted diffusion or dispersion due to the optically imperfect surfaces of the transparent membrane.<br>
Ultimately, the transparent membranes of the super-ambient reflector chambers of the related art are typically responsible for reducing the efficiency of such devices by twenty percent, or more.<br>
Sixth, the instant device is superior to the related art as a result of its extremely simple, highly integrated structure, which makes the device very economical. Note that the designs specified in the related art do not demonstrate the high degree of integration and resulting simplicity of construction that is specified herein for the instant device. Also note that the relative simplicity of the instant device is due, in part, to the fact that its reflective membranes can be deformed into precise concave parabolic surfaces using only the surrounding ambient pressure (and partial evacuation of the reflector chamber) to concavely deform its reflective membranes.j In contrast, related art relies on complex mechanical arrangements or electrostatic systems to concavely deform the reflective membranes.<br>
As one reads subsequent sections of this document, it will become quite clear that the first and second embodiments of the instant device are also superior to the related art in a variety of other ways including, among other items, various methods of manufacture.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention, in its preferred embodiments, is a portable, multifunction, multipurpose,   inflatable   parabolic   reflector  device   (apparatus)   made  from<br><br><br>
pressure-deformable membranes, of which at least one is reflective, supported by an inflatable ring for focusing electromagnetic energy from radio frequency (RF) radiation through ultraviolet(W) radiation including broad-spectrum solar energy for (1) heating and cooking, (2) generating thermal or electrical power, (3) enhancing the transmission or reception of radio signals, (4) enhancing vision in-low-light environments, and/or (5) the projection of optical signals or images. The multifunctional device also offers numerous non-electromagnetic functions such as (1) the collecting and/or storage of water, (2) use as a water flotation device, (3) use as a gurney or cast, (4) use as a portable fermentor apparatus, and/or (5) the directional amplification of sound.<br>
Arfirst main embodiment utilizes two pressure-deformable membranes, at least one of which is reflective, to form a central reflector chamber, which can be inflated to either sub-ambient (preferred) or super-ambient pressures to deploy the reflective membranes. A second main embodiment utilizes at least one" reflective membrane and at least one transparent membrane to form a central reflector chamber, which can be inflated only to superambient pressures. Both embodiments employ reflective membranes which are pre-formed into the shape" of a paraboloid to enhance safety and facilitate operation. However, the use of nonpreformed, i. e. planar, reflective membranes is contemplated to enable a variable focal length. Furthermore, the use of preformed, non-parabolic, i. e. spherical, undulating, or series of conic sections, reflective membranes is contemplated to limit the maximum degree of concentration to further enhance safety.<br>
Specific portable devices and apparatuses are shown for both main embodiments which further facilitate or enable a wide range of useful applications such as (1) the concentration and collection of broad-spectrum solar<br><br><br>
energy for cooking, heating, distillation, and power generation; (2) the reception and transmission of radio signals; (3) the illumination of interior, subterranean, and underwater environments; (4) the collection and storage of water or other liquids; and/or (5) the directional amplification of sound. Fabrication processes are disclosed for forming the products with multiple pressure-deformable membranes.<br>
Accordingly, it is a principal object of the invention to provide a highly portable, multi-function, multi-purpose apparatus and fabrication methods thereof, which is typically (but optionally) configured for use as a parabolic reflector to focus electromagnetic energy from radio frequency radiation (RF) through ultraviolet radiation(W) including solar radiation, but which can also be used for numerous other electromagnetic and non-electromagnetic utilities.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The basic device, in its preferred embodiments, is a radiant electromagnetic energy concentrating, focusing, and beaming type apparatus which manipulates radiant energy through the implementation of at least two pressure deformable membranes, at least one of which must be reflective, supported by an inflated toroid or ring. The device is effective over a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum from radio frequency (RF) through the ultraviolet(UV). It<br>
33<br><br>
should be noted that this highly multifunctional device is also amenable to numerous non-electromagnetic applications.<br>
A first preferred main embodiment of the basic device illustrated in FIGS.1 through 49L has at least one reflective membrane which is part of an inflatable pressure envelope (reflector chamber) inflated to a sub-ambient pressure to form a concave-concave reflector configuration supported by an inflatable toroid or ring, and has an effective efficiency exceeding 90% and the ability to concentrate sunlight by factors in excess of 10,000. The second main embodiment of the basic device illustrated in FIGS. 50A through FIG. 57G has at least one reflective membrane and at least one transparent membrane comprising a pressure envelope (reflector chamber) which are inflated to a super ambient pressure to form a convex-convex lens configuration supported by an inflatable ring. This embodiment has an effective efficiency of75-85W. The fabrication of the membranes and ring supports by joining different numbers of pieces is illustrated for both main embodiments. It should be noted that both main embodiments of the device can be fabricated from commercially available materials using well-established manufacturing processes. Further, most of the various applications shown for the first main embodiment also apply to the second main embodiment.<br>
In FIGS. 1 and 2 the first main embodiment 10 having only reflective membranes is illustrated as a toroid or ring support element 12 having a circular cross-section and supporting an upper frontal elastic reflecting membrane 14 and a lower rear redundant elastic reflecting membrane  16. The figures show that the support element 12 is<br>
34<br><br>
circular. However, it is noted that the invention can be practiced using other types of supports including those having cross-sectional shapes of a hexagon, square, rectangle, ellipse, and others. The membrane 14 has a centered inflation valve 18 (as an example of an inflation means for inflating the reflector chamber). The inflatable toroidal support structure 12 also has a gas valve 18 (as an example of an inflation means for inflating the support ring) for inflation to form a rigid ring (two valves are shown for separate inflation of the ring support and the center reflector chamber).<br>
The reflective membranes 14 and 16 are pre-formed (during fabrication) into the shape of a paraboloid to provide a short focal length for safety purposes, and to reduce the differential pressure required to fully deform and smooth the reflective membranes 14 and 16. However, as shown below, the invention can be practiced using planar (non-pre-formed) membranes to yield a device capable of providing a variable focal length as a function of the differential pressure imposed across the reflective membranes 14 and 16.<br>
The reflective membranes 14 and 16 in conjunction with the inner portion of the toroidal support structure provide a reflector chamber 20 with a double parabolic concave-concave reflector configuration. Seams 22 are shown for forming the toroid 12 as one example of forming the toroid. The membranes 14, 16 are adhesively or heat bonded to the toroid 12.<br>
Alternatively, as shown below, a reflective membrane and the toroid elements can be one-piece on each side. The membranes 14,16 are<br>
35<br><br>
made, for example, from Mylar , a polyethylene terephthalate plastic composition. Reflective surfaces 24 are provided by coating the outer side of the membranes 14,16 with vapor deposited aluminum and the like reflective material. The plastic reflective membranes can have reflective particles homogeneously incorporated or can contain an integral conductive wire or mesh.<br>
The toroid 12 is made from thin sheets of a high-straincapable material (i. e. a material having high strength and low elastic modulus) such as vinyl, which is necessary for allowing the inner potion of a toroid fabricated from flat annular sheets to strain (stretch) sufficiently so as not to impede full inflation of the toroid ring structure.<br>
As seen depicted in FIGS. 3A and 3B, the adjustment of the focal point 26 of the solar radiation 28 is illustrated by increasing the inflation pressure within the reflector chamber 20 to increase the focal distance 30.<br>
FIG. 4 shows the first embodiment having a pressure-deformable device having two reflective outer membranes and a non-reflective center membrane 15 serving to form a redundant reflector chamber.<br>
FIG. 5 shows the appendages which can be added to the toroid 12 to implement a stable position and to attach other elements.<br>
A pair of handles 32 are positioned diametrically on the sides of the toroid 12. An apertured tab 34 is provided on a side equidistantly between the handles 32 for hanging up when in storage or the like. A pair of hanging straps 36 are attached on either side of the apertured tab 34. A storage pouch 38 is provided for storing the deflated and<br>
36<br><br>
folded apparatus 10. A pair of bottom pouches 40 is provided for filling with dense material to stabilize an upright apparatus 10.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates a flexible plug valve 42 having an integrated plug 44 on the toroid 12 as exemplary of the valve for also the reflecting membrane 14. It is noted that these valves can be low profile valves and can be threaded to increase the integrity of the seal. FIG. 7A depicts a tongue-and-groove ziploc®-type valve 46 with the conventional tongue-and-groove ziploc® portion 48 on the toroid 12. FIG. 7B shows a valve 50 clamped to close by either a clamp or tie 52.<br>
FIG. 8 depicts various attachment devices on the first main apparatus embodiment 10 such as a clevis, shackle, clip or bracket 54 for tying a line support 56, and hook-and-loop fastening patches 58 and a mounting stud 60 for attaching other elements. A centered socket 62 is shown to insert an antenna 64 in the upper frontal reflecting membrane 14.<br>
FIG. 9 shows a different usage for the first embodiment apparatus 10 modified to form apparatus 66 by adding four (or any other number) ports to carry water or to add weights. The internal ports 68 in the toroid 12 abutting the reflector chamber 20 allow water to flow from the toroid 12 into the reflector chamber 20. Larger loading covers 70 on the toroid 12 and on the upper membrane 14 are shaped either as squares, rectangles or circles, hinged at 72, and fastened shut by peripheral hook-and-loop fasteners 58 (or any other type of fasteners).<br>
37<br><br>
FIG. 10 depicts a rain collecting apparatus 74 having a centered outlet duct 76, i. e. a modified valve and/or membrane shaped like a funnel to facilitate draining, in the upper membrane 14 passing rain effluent 78 to the reflector chamber 20.<br>
FIG. 11 shows a modified rain collecting apparatus 80, wherein the centered funnel 82 passes through the lower membrane 16 to a conduit 84 and a collection container 86. This configuration allows the device to be rapidly converted between various modes of operation, i. e. between rain collecting and cooking. It should be noted that this configuration can be implemented by the user by connecting an opposing pair of funnels/valves contained in the opposing reflective membranes 14 and 16. In the event it is necessary to increase the volume of the apparatus for rain collecting (or any other purpose described in the instant application), additional rings 12 may be used to increase the height of the walls.<br>
FIG. 12 illustrates the collection of rain water R or other liquids in the apparatus 88 which has an additional inflated collection ring 90 having a generally, but not necessarily, smaller diameter which is inflated and attached on top of the toroid 12. The ring 90 thus increases the water collection volume. It reduces the losses due to impact splatter and reduces spillage, especially if positioned on an inclined surface (hill) or moving surface (deck of a rocking boat).<br>
The major diameter of the collection ring 90 can be enlarged to increase the effective capture area. In the event it is necessary to increase the external volume of the apparatus for liquid collecting (or<br>
38<br><br>
any other purpose described in the instant application, such as supporting an item at the focal point on a rod diametrically spanning the ring 90), additional collection rings 90 may be attached to the device to increase the height of the walls. In the event it is necessary to increase the internal volume of the apparatus for liquid storage, additional toroid support structure rings 12 may be incorporated into the device between the reflective membranes 14, 16.<br>
FIG. 13 shows the apparatus 92 collecting water 94 in a peripheral gutter 96 and draining the water into a collection container 86 via a conduit 84. It should be noted that the peripheral gutter 96 can be located at the outer edge of the toroid 12, and that it can be fabricated from extensions of the membranes comprising the toroid 12.<br>
FIGS. 14A and 14B illustrate the addition of several circular elastic bands 98 such as rubber to the membranes 14,16 as a safety factor to prevent the apparatus 100 from creating potentially dangerous concentrations of energy by distorting the surface. FIG. 14B shows the elastic band 98 being secured within the reflector chamber by spaced plastic strips 102, which are thermally or otherwise bonded to the inner surface of the reflective membrane.<br>
FIG. 15 depicts an apparatus 104 having a circular plastic cover 106 capable of being rolled up to the attachment point 108 on the toroid 12. Cover 106 may optionally have hook and loop patches to allow it to be held in either rolled or deployed condition. The purpose of the cover is to protect the mirror and prevent unintentional dangerous concentration of energy when not in use.<br>
39<br><br>
FIG. 16 illustrates an apparatus 110 modified to insert a centered transparent patch 112 in both membranes 14, 16 having a pair of cross-hair configured members 114 as well as another pair of members 114 in the toroid 12 to aid in alignment of the apparatus 110 with an electromagnetic source.<br>
FIG. 17 shows a satellite dish reception apparatus 116 comprising an inflated base ring 118 which supports a hemispherical mounting and stabilization component element 120 made from gores 122 within which the first main apparatus embodiment 10 is couched. This apparatus 116 may require an accessory receiver (not shown) when used to receive satellite transmissions. It is noted that the reflector may also be made of multiple gores.<br>
It is also noted that other methods of support include resting the hemispherical mounting in a ground depression, such as that which may be dug in sand, or a plurality of tapered support rings used to incline the device for proper orientation to a source and/or target. The support rings may also serve a leveling function when the device is resting on an inclined surface or hill.<br>
FIG. 18 depicts an inflatable, height adjustable, dipody support structure 124 for supporting the first main apparatus 10 by two support tubes 126 having inflatable compartments 128 with individual gas inflation valves 18. Thus, these support tubes 126 are adjustable in height for placing on uneven terrain by controlling the amount of air inserted in each compartment of each support tube. The support tubes 126 are tied on top to the top of the inclined apparatus 10 by the<br>
40<br><br>
hanging straps 36, as shown in FIG. 5, or any other well-known fastening means.
