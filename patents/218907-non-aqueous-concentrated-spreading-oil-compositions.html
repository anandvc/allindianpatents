This invention concerns a non-aqueous, storage stable spreading oil (SO) formulation for crop protection active compounds and their use for combating pests, in particular for use in the application of a pesticide to aquatic environments.<br>
However, hitherto pesticides have usually been applied to paddy-fields in the form of soluble, dispersible or absorbent granules which release the active ingredient into the water, or pour-on liquids, in particular emuisifiable concentrate fonnulations which disperse the active ingredient on the surface of the water (e.g. EP 0 206 987).<br>
The European Patent Application EP 0 415 569 suggests a fungicidal composition for application to an aquatic environment comprising a solid carrier, fungicidal azoxystrobin (EP 0 382 375) as active ingredient and an oil in which said active ingredient is miscible or in which it is capable of being dispersed.<br>
It is well known that the efficacy of plant protection agent can be higher if the active ingredient is applied in dissolved form rather than in a particulate form. One environmentally friendly way to apply an active ingredient in such a form would be dissolved in a plant oil. Unfortunately, most plant protection agents do not exhibit high solubilities in plant oils.<br><br>
In view of an easy and safe handling and the necessity to improve the efficacy of plant protection agents it is desirable to develop SO formulations for application in paddy-fields which contain comparably high concentrations of plant protection agents in a spreadable oil.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a single-phase non-aqueous concentrated SO for   application   of crop   protection   active   compounds   in   aquatic   environments consisting of<br>
(a)	15 to 400 g/L of one or more crop protection active compounds wherein said crop protection agents (a) are essentially insoluble in water and have a solubility of less than 50 g/L in pure plant oils (b) and wherein said crop protection agents (a) are selected from the group consisting of fertilizers, herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, nematicides, algicides, molluscicides, rodenticides, virucides, compounds inducing resistance into plants, viruses, bacteria, nematodes, fungi, microorganisms, repellents of birds and animals, and plant growth regulators, or mixtures thereof;<br>
(b)	300 to 700 g/L of one or more plant oils, wherein said plant oil is a triglyceride or a mixture of triglycerides consisting essentially of the following fatty acids, palmitic acid, palmoleic acid, stearic fatty, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linoleneic acid;<br>
(c)	30 to 200 g/L of one or more polar aprotic organic solvents selected from the group consisting of N-C1-18 alkylpyrrolidone, N-C5-8 cycloalkylpyrrohdone, y-butyrolactone and cyclohexanone;<br>
(d)	optionally one or more methylated plant oils, wherein said methylated plant oil is a methylated fatty acid;<br><br>
(e) 0 to 100 g/L of one or more conventional additives selected from the group consisting of defoamers, corrosion inhibitors) stabilizers, penetrants and stickers, and anionic and/or nonionic dispersant(s); wherein the sum of all ingredients in the formulation adds up to one liter. Another aspect of the present invention is a process for the preparation of such a SO formulation.<br>
Furthermore the invention relates to a method for the control of diseases and/or pests in aquatic environments which comprises treating water with the inventive SO formulation, whereupon an oily film spreads over the water surface and subsequently contacts the plants, which are grown or planted before or later in this aquatic environment with the active ingredient(s) contained in said SO formulation.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a method for the enhancement of the efficacy of fungicidal triazolopyrimidines (e.g. EP 0 550 113), in particular the compounds of formula I<br><br>
against rice diseases on paddy rice. Said method comprises applying a SO formulation as defined above wherein said crop protection active compounds (a) comprise at least one compound of formula (I) on the aquatic environment of said rice plants.<br>
Those and other objects and features of the invention will become more apparent fi-om the detailed description set forth hereinbelow.<br><br>

Methylated plant oils, which are used as nonpolar, water immiscible cosolvents (d) according to the present invention, are as a rule methyl esters obtainable from medium chained fatty acids by esterification with methanols or by transesterification of the corresponding plant oils preferably in the present of a lipase. Preferred fatty acids of these plant oils have 5 to 20, in particular 6 to 15 carbon atoms. As a rule they are mixtures of fatty acids having different chain lengths, mixtures in which the main component, i.e., more than 50 percent of said mixture, has 10 carbon atoms are particularly preferred, In a preferred embodiment the methylated plant oil used is the methyl ester of palm kernel oil, caprylic/carpic acid or of capric acid having less than 5 percent of fatty acids having chain lengths different from 10. Particularly preferred methylated plant oils are Witconol® 1095 and Witconol® 2309 which are commercially available from the Witco Corporation, Houston, Texas, USA or Edenor® ME C 6-10 and Edenor® ME C 12 70 which are commercially available from Henkel KGaA, Dusseldorf, Germany. As a rule the non-aqueous SO according to the invention comprises at least 100 g/L, preferably 150 to 450 g/L, in particular 250 to 400 g/L of one or more methylated plant oils (d).<br>
The appropriate relative amounts of active ingredient (a) and the plant oil (b) lie, in accordance with the invention, between 1:50 and 1:1, preferably between 1:30 and 1:5 and; m particular, between 1:20 and 1:10.<br>
Recommended doses for various applications are known for the plant protection active compounds (a) where the efficacy can be enhanced in accordance with the invention. Application in form of a SO fomiulation as suggested here can (depending on the active ingredient, the solvent and the cosolvent(s) and their amounts) reduce the amount of active ingredient per hectare required in these recommendations by half 
 <br>
or mors, whereby it becomes possible to control additional diseases at reasonable doses.<br>
An important advantage is the rapid onset and the high persistency of activity on use of the new SO formulation. This enlarges the period for application of the pesticide and makes its use more flexible.<br>
The pesticidal SO formulations according to the present invention can be used protectively and curatively.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment according to this invention the non-aqueous SO essentially consists of<br>
(a)	15 to 400 g/L, preferably 20 to 200 g/L, of one or more crop protection active compounds, in particular a compound of formula I;<br>
(b)	300 to 700 g/L, preferably 350 to 600 g/L, of one or more plant oils selected from the group consisting of olive oil and sunflower oil;<br>
(c)	30 to 200 g/L, preferably 50 to 150 g/L, of at least one polar aprotic solvent, in particular N-octylpyrrolidone or N-dodecylpyrrolidone<br>
(d)	optionally up to 450 g/L, preferably 200 to 400 g/L of one or more methylated plant oils, in particular methyl esters of caprylic and/or capric acid;<br>
The solvents (b), (c) and (d) and the pesticidal active compounds (a) are processed to the SO formulations according to the invention by well-established procedures. For example, the solution can be formed by dissolving (a) in an adequate mixture of (b), (c) and (d), if necessary in the presence of a volatile solvent to aid dissolution.<br>
SO formulations according to the present invention are usually produced so as to obtain a stable liquid product and usually contain 1.5 to 40% w/v active ingredient(s), 30 to 70 % w/v of plant oil(s), 3 to 20 % w/v of polar aprotic solvent(s), 0 to 45 % w/v methylated plant oils, and 0 to 10% w/v of other additives such as defoamers. corrosion inhibitors, stabilizers, penetrants and stickers, and anionic and/or nonionic dispersant(s).<br>
The finished non-aqueous SO formulations according to the invention are stable in storage, i.e. even on storage over a relatively long<br><br>
period. The SOs according to the present invention allow high loadings of one or more pesticidal active ingredients to be included in the formulation and, therefore, offer the advantage of an optimized and easy-to-use formulation of the crop protection active compound.<br>
The solubility of the active ingredients (a) in the formulation according to the invention depends not only on the structure of the active ingredient but also on the amount of the cosolvent (c). The relative amount of active ingredient (a) increases by about 40 to 60 % when 10 to 15 % cosolvent (c) is incorporated into the formulation.<br>
■The SO formulation according to the invention is preferably sprayed or poured onto the surface of the aquatic environment of paddy rice fields, in particular using the so-called Shaker Bottle Application.<br>
The formulation spreads well as a monolayer on the surface of water and sticks to the lipophilic leaf surface of the rice plants.<br>
Solid granules in which the SO formulation according to the invention is adsorbed onto a solid carrier, as for example disclosed e.g. by EP 0 415 569, also lie within the scope of the invention.<br>
The SO formulation as hereinbefore described containing a fungicide as active ingredient (a) preferably has fungicidal effects against one or more of the following diseases; bacterial leaf blight {Xanthomonas campestris pv. or/zae), blast (Pyricularia oryzae), brown spot {Cochliobolus miyabeanus), bakanae disease and foot rot {Gibberella fujikuroi), sheath blight {Rhiioctonia solani) and seedling blight {Corticium rolfsii). As used herein the phrase "fungicidal effect" means that the active ingredient displays activity against a fungal disease.<br>
For a more clear understanding of the invention, specific examples are set forth below. These examples are merely illustrations and are not to be understood as limiting the scope and underlying principles of the invention in any way. Various modifications of the invention in addition to those shown and described herein will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following examples and foregoing description. Such<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 4<br>
The following SO formulation according to the invention is prepared by dissolving the active ingredient in a mixture of the solvents (b), (c) and<br><br>
Control of Pvricularia orvzae<br>
Paddy-rice plants of the variety "Koshihikari" were grown in nursery boxes, and were transplanted to the greenhouse in plots of 457 cm2(4 plants/pot). 3 days after transplanting, different formulations of (S)-azolopyrimidine C were added to the water. The plants were inoculated with spore solution of Pyricularia oryzae at 45 days after treatment with the active ingredient. Untreated plots were included in the test.<br>
A      Rice Leaf Blast<br>
52 days after the treatment 63 % of the leaf area of the untreated rice plants (controls) were infected with the rice blast disease. The disease level (% infected leaf area) was also assessed in the treated plants, and the efficacy (in %) of the treatment was measured. The effects of the SO formulation according to the invention and a granular formulation are given in Table 1.<br><br><br>
B      Rice Panicle Blast<br>
126 days after the treatment 60 % of the panicles of the untreated rice plants (controls) were infected with the rice blast disease. The disease level (% infected panicles) was also assessed in the treated plants, and the efficacy (in %) of the treatment was measured. The effects of the SO formulation according to the invention and a granular formulation are given in Table II.<br><br><br>
These tests clearly prove that a dose reduction of about 50% for equivalent disease control can be achieved with the SO fonmulation according to this invention connpared to a conventional granule formulation.<br>
In addition, phytotoxicity has been negligible at the tested application rates.<br>
Moreover, the inventive SO formulations are more environmentally friendly than conventional formulations and have improved toxicity profiles which renders the handling of these formulation safer.<br><br><br>
