				<td>The present invention relates to a catalyst<br>
for production of cycloolefins by the partial<br>
hydrogenation of a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, a<br>
process for production of the catalyst and a process<br>
for production of cycloolefins. Specifically, the<br>
present invention relates to a catalyst for production<br>
of cycloolefins, formed so that the catalyst comprises<br>
zirconia as a carrier, and has an average primary<br>
particle diameter from 3 to 50 nm and an average<br>
secondary particle diameter from 0.1 to 30 µm.<br>
Additionally, the present invention relates to a<br>
process for production of the catalyst and a process<br>
for production of cycloolefins, characterized in that<br>
the catalyst is used for the partial hydrogenation in<br>
the liquid phase of a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
in the presence of water.<br>
[BACKGROUND ART]<br>
[0002]<br>
Conventionally, a ruthenium catalyst has<br>
generally been employed as the catalyst for producing<br><br>
cycloolefins through the partial hydrogenation of a<br>
monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. Further, for such<br>
ruthenium catalysts, processes typically used water and<br>
a metal salt. As production processes using a well-<br>
known catalyst, examples of processes which carry out a<br>
reaction by using fine particles of ruthenium metal<br>
unchanged are disclosed in patent documents 1 to 3.<br>
Examples of processes which carry out a reaction by<br>
adding at least one kind of metal oxide in addition to<br>
fine particles of ruthenium metal are disclosed in<br>
patent documents 4 to 6. Examples of processes which<br>
employ a catalyst supporting ruthenium on a carrier of<br>
silica, alumina, silica-zirconia and the like are<br>
disclosed in patent documents 7 to 10. Additionally,<br>
an example of a process which employs a catalyst<br>
supporting ruthenium on a mesoporous silica material is<br>
disclosed in patent document 11.<br>
[0003]<br>
The conventional processes, however, have a<br>
number of problems. In the case of carrying out a<br>
reaction by using fine particles of ruthenium metal<br>
unchanged as the catalyst, or the case of carrying out<br>
a reaction by adding at least one kind of metal oxide<br>
in addition to fine particles of ruthenium metal,<br>
catalytic activity decreases due to agglomeration of<br>
the catalyst particles in the reaction system. Thus,<br>
cycloolefin productivity is decreased.<br>
[0004]<br><br>
On the other hand, catalysts having ruthenium<br>
loaded on a carrier of silica, alumina, silica-zirconia<br>
or the like have a problem in that its selectivity for<br>
cycloolefin is very low, although it is initially<br>
highly active with respect to ruthenium. Another<br>
problem exists in that the carrier dissolves under<br>
reaction conditions where water and a metal salt are<br>
present (hydrothermal and acidic). Dissolution of the<br>
carrier causes peeling of the supported active<br>
hydrogenation component from the carrier, which leads<br>
to a dramatic decrease in activity and a drop in<br>
selectivity. An additional problem arises in that the<br>
eluted carrier contaminates the reaction system. For<br>
these reasons, there is a demand for a technology which<br>
can stabilize catalytic performance and stably maintain<br>
the reaction system.<br>

[DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
[0006]<br>
One characteristic of the present invention<br>
is its use as a carrier of zirconia which does not<br>
dissolve even under the hydrothermal and acidic<br>
reaction conditions that are present in cycloolefin<br>
production. Using a carrier that does not dissolve<br>
allows the carrier to remain as a solid even if the<br>
reaction system is a liquid phase. This is<br>
advantageous in that the reaction system is not<br>
contaminated and that the carrier can be handled easily<br>
when separating/recovering it.<br>
[0007]<br>
Even if a carrier that does not dissolve<br>
under hydrothermal and acidic reaction conditions is<br>
used, physical properties of the catalyst change during<br>
the preparation of the catalyst or under the reaction<br>
conditions depending on the physical properties of the<br>
carrier used. Peeling or agglomeration of the catalyst<br>
component on the carrier may occur, thereby causing a<br>
decrease in activity or selectivity. Furthermore, if<br>
the reaction temperature or pressure is high, the<br>
decrease in catalytic performance increases has a<br>
greater impact. Additionally, the size of the catalyst<br>
or carrier particles influences the reaction<br>
performance of the catalyst as well as dispersion and<br><br>
handleability.<br>
[0008]<br>
While catalyst dispersion within the reaction<br>
system improves if the catalyst particles are small,<br>
separation and recoverability worsen because the<br>
catalyst particles are so fine. On the other hand,<br>
while separation and recoverability improve if the<br>
catalyst particles are large, the large particles can<br>
cause other problems. Such problems include, for<br>
 example, causing a reduction in crushing strength or a<br>
reduction in reaction performance. The support<br>
component for supporting onto the carrier is small in<br>
comparison to the carrier weight. Usually, the size of<br>
the catalyst particles is generally equal to the size<br>
	of the carrier. The catalyst for cycloolefin<br>
production according to the present invention, however,<br>
can have its physical properties change depending on<br>
the characteristics that the carrier possesses, as the<br>
catalyst preparation process and employed reaction<br>
 conditions are hydrothermal and acidic conditions. For<br>
this reason, it is necessary to define the catalyst<br>
particles. In addition, the carrier must not only not<br>
dissolve under the conditions used, but it must also<br>
possess the physical properties of improving catalytic<br>
 performance and being able to stably maintain the<br>
catalyst component on the carrier, as well as being<br>
excellent in handleability.<br>
[0009]<br><br>
The present invention defines composition<br>
parameters, such as the size of catalyst particles. It<br>
is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
catalyst for cycloolefin production which possesses<br>
high activity and high selectivity for its catalytic<br>
performance and which also improves catalyst life and<br>
handleability through the use of a defined carrier.<br>
[Means to Solve the Problems]<br>
[0010]<br>
As a result of earnest research for achieving<br>
the above-described object, the present inventors have<br>
found that the below-described catalyst exhibits high<br>
performance in the areas of activity, selectivity, life<br>
stability and handleability during production of a<br>
cycloolefin by partial hydrogenation of a monocyclic<br>

[EFFECT OF THE INVENTION]<br>
[0012]<br>
An active hydrogenation catalyst according to<br>
the present invention is supported on a zirconia<br>
carrier. The catalyst is characterized in that the<br>
particle diameter of the catalyst is defined. Unlike<br>
conventional catalysts, the present catalyst exhibits<br>
excellent performance. For example, there is no<br>
dissolution of the carrier under hydrothermal and<br>
acidic conditions, or conferral of a positive influence<br>
on diffusion within the catalyst of the cycloolefin<br>
undergoing reaction. Additionally, the catalyst has<br>
the ability to suppress peeling and agglomeration on<br>
the carrier of the supported active hydrogenation<br>
component. The present catalyst also improves<br><br>
handleability during separation and recovery of the<br>
solid catalyst. In comparison with conventional<br>
catalysts, using the active hydrogenation catalyst<br>
according to the present invention allows for the<br>
stable production of cycloolefins having high activity<br>
and high selectivity over a long period of time.<br>
[BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION]<br>
[0013]<br>
The present invention will now be described<br>
in detail.<br>
The active hydrogenation catalyst according<br>
to the present invention uses zirconia as a carrier,<br>
and has catalyst particles in which the primary<br>
particles have an average particle diameter of 3 to 50<br>
nm. The secondary particles formed therefrom have an<br>
average particle diameter of 0.1 to 30 µm. More<br>
preferably, the primary particles have an average<br>
particle diameter of 4 to 20 nm, and the secondary<br>
particles formed therefrom have an average particle<br>
diameter of 0.2 to 10 µm.<br>
[0014]<br>
The catalyst according to the present<br>
invention uses zirconia as the carrier because<br>
zirconia materials are very durable.<br>
[0015]<br>
"Catalyst average primary particle diameter",<br>
as used in the present invention, indicates the average<br><br>
size of the single particles contained in the catalyst<br>
and the carrier. In addition, "average secondary<br>
particle diameter" refers to the size of a mass of<br>
agglomerated primary particles, and indicates the<br>
average value of the size of what is usually called an<br>
"agglomerate". The primary particles of the catalyst<br>
according to the present invention are formed from a<br>
granular catalyst component and single zirconia<br>
particles, and secondary particles are formed from<br>
those primary particles.<br>
[0016]<br>
The size of the particles constituting the<br>
catalyst is an important design matter for improving<br>
the reactivity and stability of catalytic performance.<br>
The size of the particles also strongly influences the<br>
handleability of the catalyst. A catalyst structure<br>
defined by primary particle diameter and secondary<br>
particle diameter can control the pores of the catalyst<br>
from its structural characteristics. Such pore<br>
function improves the reaction selectivity of the<br>
desired product. For example, it exerts a positive<br>
influence on substance mobility of the reaction<br>
substrate. In addition, a catalyst in which the<br>
primary particle diameter and secondary particle<br>
diameter are defined according to the present invention<br>
exhibits greatly improved activity and catalyst life<br>
performance. For example, a catalyst in which the<br>
primary and secondary particle diameters are defined<br><br>
according to the present invention has high dispersion<br>
of the active catalyst component, securely fixes and<br>
holds the active catalyst component on the carrier,<br>
allows the active catalyst component to act<br>
effectively, and suppresses sintering of the active<br>
catalyst component.<br>
[0017]<br>
If the catalyst average primary particle<br>
diameter is less than 3 nm, agglomeration of the<br>
catalyst tends to occur under hydrothermal and acidic<br>
conditions. Furthermore, agglomeration of the zirconia<br>
particles used as the carrier tends to progress, and<br>
the specific surface area of the catalyst decreases.<br>
The active catalyst component then becomes contained<br>
within the carrier, and single-particles, mobile<br>
agglomerates and the like form. As a result, the<br>
stability of the catalytic performance cannot be<br>
maintained. If the catalyst primary particle diameter<br>
is greater than 50 nm, the active catalyst component<br>
supported on the carrier and the co-catalyst component<br>
for improving selectivity tend to move. These<br>
components may form mobile agglomerates, causing<br>
catalytic activity and selectivity to deteriorate.<br>
[0018]<br>
If the catalyst average secondary particle<br>
diameter is less than 0.1 Jim, suitable pore volume and<br>
pore structure cannot be maintained. The active<br>
hydrogenation component supported on the secondary<br><br>
particle surface is thus exposed, causing a<br>
deterioration in catalytic activity and selectivity.<br>
Furthermore, handleability, such as separation and<br>
recovery of the catalyst, worsens. Increasing the<br>
catalyst secondary average particle diameter to more<br>
than 30 µm results in a negative impact on intra-pore<br>
diffusion of the reaction substrate during cycloolefin<br>
production, and reactivity deteriorates. Furthermore,<br>
problems with catalyst shape-stability and<br>
handleability also occur. For example, the catalyst<br>
becomes more susceptible to pulverization under the<br>
conditions used.<br>
[0019]<br>
The catalyst according to the present<br>
invention exhibits an advantageous effect wherein the<br>
particle diameter of primary particles and secondary<br>
particles which constitute the catalyst control<br>
movement of the substrate undergoing reaction within<br>
the catalyst. Additionally, the particle diameters<br>
also play a part in fixing the active catalyst<br>
component in the catalyst on the carrier. The<br>
geometrical action which occurs when primary particles<br>
agglomerate to form a secondary particle realizes high<br>
selectivity and high activity, while suppressing<br>
peeling, movement and agglomeration of the supported<br>
active catalyst component. Thus, the catalyst particle<br>
diameters improve stability. Further, if the catalyst<br>
particle diameters have the physical properties of said<br><br>
range, additional effects are produced. For example,<br>
it is more difficult for the secondary particles to<br>
fragment under the conditions used, the catalyst<br>
sedimentation rate increases, and the carrier is more<br>
easily separated and recovered from the reaction layer.<br>
[0020]<br>
In the present invention, although the<br>
primary particle diameter of the catalyst is defined in<br>
terms of average particle diameter, the catalyst<br>
primary particles need not be particles of a uniform<br>
size, and particle size distribution is not restricted.<br>
The particle size distribution of the primary particles<br>
can be broad, and the particle size distribution does<br>
not have to be uniform. For example, particles having<br>
a primary particle diameter of 30 nm or more and<br>
particles having a primary particle diameter of 4 nm or<br>
less can be mixed together.<br>
[0021]<br>
The pore structure of the catalyst according<br>
to the present invention possesses an average pore<br>
diameter in the range of from 2.5 to 15 nm. The pore<br>
volume in this pore diameter range is such that the<br>
catalyst is preferably 50% or more, by volume, of the<br>
total pore volume of pore diameters 2 to 150 nm. More<br>
preferably, the catalyst possesses an average pore<br>
diameter in the range of from 3 to 10 nm, and the pore<br>
volume in this pore diameter range is such that the<br>
catalyst is preferably 50% or more, by volume, of the<br><br>
total pore volume of pore diameters 2 to 150 nm.<br>
[0022]<br>
Pore characteristics of a supported catalyst<br>
have an effect on control of particle growth of the<br>
supported active hydrogenation component.<br>
Additionally, the pore characteristics influence intra-<br>
pore mass transfer of the raw material substances and<br>
generated product during the reaction. If the average<br>
pore diameter is 2.5 nm or less, however, mass transfer<br>
of the reaction substrate does not occur effectively.<br>
As a result, selectivity and activity tend to<br>
deteriorate. Further, this very often leads to a<br>
situation where the active hydrogenation component is<br>
not stably dispersed on the carrier, and catalyst life<br>
is shortened. If the average pore diameter is larger<br>
than 15 nm, the active catalyst component loaded in a<br>
dispersed state sinters because of high-temperature and<br>
hydrothermal conditions or similar. This large pore<br>
diameter is unfavorable because it results in decreased<br>
activity. Preferably, pore distribution is narrow and<br>
uniformwithin the distribution range.<br>
[0023]<br>
The present invention may support a metal or<br>
a metal compound, or a mixture thereof as the<br>
hydrogenation active catalyst component on the zirconia<br>
carrier. Components capable of hydrogenation catalysis<br>
are well-known in the conventional art. Ruthenium is<br>
particularly preferable among hydrogenation active<br><br>
catalyst components.<br>
[0024]<br>
"Ruthenium", as mentioned in the present<br>
invention, includes ruthenium metal, ruthenium<br>
compounds and the like. It is used under conditions<br>
including a metal or a charged state, or a state<br>
possessing both characteristics. The average<br>
crystallite diameter of the supported ruthenium is<br>
preferably from 2 to 15 nm, as this diameter of<br>
ruthenium results in improved stability in the carrier<br>
pore interior. With an average crystallite diameter of<br>
less than 2 nm, movement within the carrier pores tends<br>
to occur, and agglomeration of the active hydrogenation<br>
component progresses. As a result, catalytic<br>
performance cannot be stably maintained. If the<br>
average crystalline diameter exceeds 15 nm, dispersion<br>
is poor, and activity with respect to the active<br>
catalyst component is also poor. Thus, the size of the<br>
pore diameter and active component being of the same<br>
order as that of the catalyst primary particle diameter<br>
improves the stability and activity of catalytic<br>
performance.<br>
[0025]<br>
The amount of ruthenium supported on the<br>
carrier is preferably in the range of 2 to 30% by<br>
weight of the carrier weight converted into ruthenium<br>
metal. It is more preferable 'to have an amount of<br>
ruthenium in the range of from 4 to 22% by weight. The<br><br>
amount of ruthenium most preferable is in the range of<br>
from 8 to 18% by weight. If the amount of ruthenium is<br>
under 2% by weight, although activity increases with<br>
respect to active catalyst component, activity with<br>
respect to catalyst deteriorates. Thus, the total<br>
catalyst content, including the carrier, has to be<br>
increased. While the amount of the active catalyst<br>
component actually used can be decreased, this is not<br>
preferable. When the amount of active catalyst<br>
component is decreased, the catalyst becomes more<br>
susceptible to the impact of toxic substances stemming<br>
from the raw materials or the reactor material. On the<br>
other hand, if the active hydrogenation component<br>
exceeds 30% by weight, it becomes more difficult to<br>
carry out uniform support in practice.<br>
[0026]<br>
The present invention can use, as a component<br>
which is supported on the carrier, ruthenium alone, or<br>
another co-supported metal component in addition to<br>
ruthenium. Examples of raw materials for the ruthenium<br>
supported on the carrier include halides, nitrates and<br>
hydroxides of ruthenium, ruthenium carbonyl and<br>
ruthenium complexes such as ruthenium amine complexes.<br>
[0027]<br>
Further, examples of the component which can<br>
be used for co-supporting with ruthenium include zinc,<br>
nickel, iron, copper, cobalt, manganese, alkaline-earth<br>
elements, and rare-earth elements such as lanthanum,<br><br>
cerium, samarium and terbium. The raw material for<br>
these examples includes the various compounds of the<br>
co-supporting component, such as halides, nitrates,<br>
acetates and sulfates of the respective metal, and<br>
complexes containing the respective metal. These co-<br>
supporting components with ruthenium provide effects in<br>
reaction activity and selectivity performance of the<br>
catalyst. Additionally, they have an effect on the<br>
stability of catalyst life. Among them, zinc is a most<br>
preferable co-supporting component. Preferably, the<br>
content thereof is 5 moles or less of zinc atoms per 1<br>
mole of ruthenium atoms, and the range of from 0.01 to<br>
3 moles is particularly preferable.<br>
[0028]<br>
The specific surface area of the catalyst<br>
according to the present invention is preferably in the<br>
range of from 20 to 300 m2/g. A specific surface area<br>
in the range of from 30 to 150 m2/g is more preferable,<br>
and the range of from 50 to 120 m2/g is most preferable.<br>
To maintain a high dispersion of active hydrogenation<br>
component, a preferable range for the specific surface<br>
area exists. Within that range, the reaction stability<br>
of the catalyst can be maintained.<br>
[0029]<br>
The present invention is characterized by<br>
using an interstitial-pore type porous zirconia<br>
material as its carrier for the catalyst. In the<br>
zirconia material, the average particle diameter of the<br><br>
primary particles and the average particle diameter of<br>
the secondary particles are defined. The meaning of<br>
"carrier average primary particle diameter", as used in<br>
the present invention, refers to the average size of<br>
zirconia single particles which constitute the carrier.<br>
In addition, "average secondary particle diameter"<br>
refers to the size of a mass of agglomerated primary<br>
particles, and indicates the average value of the<br>
carrier particle size (agglomerate size).<br>
"Interstitial-pore type porous zirconia material"<br>
refers to zirconia comprising a large number of pores<br>
which are formed as gaps between the primary particles.<br>
These pores are produced when the zirconia primary<br>
particles (single particles) agglomerate to create a<br>
secondary particle.<br>
[0030]<br>
The carrier according to the present<br>
invention is an interstitial-pore type porous zirconia<br>
material constituted from secondary particles in which<br>
primary particles have agglomerated. The carrier<br>
serves to disperse the catalyst component, to fix and<br>
hold the catalyst component on the carrier, to allow<br>
the catalyst activity site to work effectively, and<br>
greatly contributes to improving activity and catalyst<br>
life performance by suppressing sintering and the like.<br>
Pore action of the carrier also has a large effect on<br>
reaction selectivity of the desired product, such as by<br>
exerting an influence on substance mobility of the<br><br>
reaction substrate.<br>
[0031]<br>
When preparing a solid catalyst, the size of<br>
the particles constituting the carrier is an important<br>
design consideration for improving the reactivity and<br>
stability of catalytic performance. Size also has a<br>
strong effect on the handleability of the catalyst.<br>
[0032]<br>
By defining the size of the zirconia primary<br>
particles and secondary particles which constitute the<br>
carrier, the supported active hydrogenation component<br>
exhibits excellent performance. For example, it<br>
suppresses peeling from the carrier and agglomeration<br>
on the carrier. The strength with which the supported<br>
 component is fixed to the carrier reflects the size of<br>
the particles which constitute the carrier. The<br>
geometrical action which occurs when primary particles<br>
agglomerate to form a secondary particle contributes to<br>
an improvement in stability.<br>
 [0033]<br>
By using a porous zirconia material, which<br>
has its physical properties defined according to the<br>
present invention, as a carrier, catalyst physical<br>
properties can be achieved which approximate the<br>
 physical properties of the carrier, and preferable<br>
physical properties as a catalyst can be maintained.<br>
The reason for this is that the porous zirconia<br>
material used in the present invention has high<br><br>
chemical resistance and is not readily affected by<br>
heat, and the physical properties of the carrier are<br>
not readily susceptible to a large changes due to<br>
subjecting the active catalyst component to the support<br>
process. The particle diameter of the active catalyst<br>
component supported on the porous zirconia material is<br>
minute. Thus, by preparing the amount of component to<br>
be supported in the range of 3 to 30% by weight, the<br>
physical properties of the carrier supporting the<br>
active catalyst component dramatically affect the<br>
physical property values of the catalyst. Therefore,<br>
the primary particles and secondary particles of the<br>
porous zirconia material used as the carrier are<br>
present without great change even after the preparation<br>
of the catalyst. The physical properties, such as<br>
particle size of the catalyst, are approximately the<br>
same value as those of the porous zirconia material<br>
used as the carrier.<br>
[0034]<br>
The carrier used in the present invention is<br>
a porous zirconia material constituted from particles<br>
having an average primary particle diameter of 3 to 50<br>
nm, and an average secondary particle diameter of 0.1<br>
to 30 µm. More preferably, the porous zirconia<br>
material is constituted from particles having an<br>
average primary particle diameter of 4 to 20 nm, and an<br>
average secondary particle diameter of 0.2 to 10 µm.<br>
[0035]<br><br>
If the average primary particle diameter is<br>
small, agglomeration of the zirconia particles tends to<br>
proceed under hydrothermal and acidic conditions. As a<br>
result, the specific surface area of the carrier<br>
decreases, the catalyst component becomes contained<br>
within the carrier single-particles and mobile<br>
agglomerates and the like form. As a result, the<br>
stability of the catalytic performance cannot be<br>
maintained. If the particle diameter is too large, the<br>
active hydrogenation component loaded within the pore<br>
and the co-catalyst component for improving selectivity<br>
tend to move and agglomerate. This leads to a<br>
deterioration in catalytic activity and selectivity.<br>
Thus, the primary particle diameter influences the<br>
stability of the physical properties of the carrier, as<br>
well as the stability of the component supported on the<br>
carrier.<br>
[0036]<br>
In the present invention, while the primary<br>
particle diameter of the carrier is defined in terms of<br>
average particle diameter, the carrier primary<br>
particles need not be uniform particles, and particle<br>
size distribution of the primary particles is not<br>
restricted. The particle size distribution of the<br>
primary particles can be broad, and the particle size<br>
distribution does not have to be uniform. For example,<br>
particles having a size of 50 nm or more and particles<br>
having a primary particle diameter of 3 nm or less can<br><br>
be mixed together.<br>
[0037]<br>
On the other hand, if the average secondary<br>
particle diameter is less than the above-described<br>
range, suitable pore volume and pore structure cannot<br>
be maintained. The active hydrogenation component<br>
supported on the secondary particle surface is exposed,<br>
and results in a deterioration in catalytic activity<br>
and selectivity. Furthermore, handleability, such as<br>
separation and recovery of the catalyst, worsens. If<br>
the secondary average particle diameter increases and<br>
exceeds the above-described range, intra-pore diffusion<br>
of the reaction substrate during cycloolefin production<br>
is negatively impacted, and reactivity deteriorates.<br>
Furthermore, problems with catalyst shape-stability and<br>
handleability also occur. For example, the catalyst<br>
becomes more susceptible to pulverization under the<br>
conditions used.<br>
[0038]<br>
The porous zirconia material according to the<br>
present invention is an interstitial-pore type porous<br>
material, having secondary particles formed from an<br>
agglomeration of primary particles. As the pore<br>
characteristics of such porous material, the average<br>
pore diameter is in the range of from 2.5 to 15 nm,<br>
wherein the pore volume in this pore diameter range is<br>
such that the porous zirconia material is preferably<br>
50% or more, by volume, of the total pore volume of<br><br>
pore diameters 2 to 150 nm.<br>
[0039] Pore characteristics in a supported catalyst<br>
have an impact on controlling particle growth of the<br>
supported active catalyst component, and influence<br>
intra-pore mass transfer of the raw material substances<br>
and generated product during the reaction. While a<br>
carrier for a catalyst component is still feasible when<br>
the average pore diameter is less than 2 nm, this is<br>
not preferable because the intra-pore mass transfer of<br>
raw material substances and the generated product is<br>
restricted, resulting in deterioration in the reaction<br>
activity and selectivity. If the average pore diameter<br>
is large and exceeds the above-described range, the<br>
dispersibly supported catalyst component sinters<br>
because of high-temperature and hydrothermal conditions<br>
or similar. This large pore diameter is unfavorable<br>
because it results in decreased activity. Preferably,<br>
pore distribution is narrow and uniform within the<br>
distribution range.<br>
[0040]<br>
To maintain the catalyst supported amount in<br>
a preferable range, the pore volume of the porous<br>
zirconia material according to the present invention is<br>
preferably a pore volume of 0.1 cm3/g or more per 1 g of<br>
carrier. The pore volume is important in maintaining<br>
the carrier amount of the catalyst component in the<br>
preferable range, and more preferably within the range<br><br>
of 0.15 to 0.6 cm3/g. Under a pore volume of 0.1 cm3/g,<br>
only a minute amount of the active hydrogenation<br>
component can be supported in the pores. On the other<br>
hand, if the pore volume is too large, the pores and<br>
secondary particles are susceptible to physical<br>
destruction.<br>
[0041]<br>
The specific surface area of the porous<br>
zirconia material according to the present invention is<br>
preferably in the range of from 20 to 300 m2/g. More<br>
preferable is a specific surface area in the range of<br>
from 30 to 150 m2/g, and most preferable is in the range<br>
of from 50 to 120 m2/g. If the specific surface area is<br>
less than 20 m2/g, it is difficult to maintain a high<br>
dispersion of the active hydrogenation component, and<br>
the activity with respect to active hydrogenation<br>
component is reduced. On the other hand, if the<br>
specific surface area exceeds 300 m2/g, the porous<br>
zirconia material has poor physical stability under<br>
 long-term reaction conditions, and it is difficult to<br>
stably maintain the synergetic effects of the ruthenium<br>
of the active hydrogenation component and the co-<br>
catalyst zinc.<br>
[0042]<br>
	The particle shape of the specific surface<br>
area of the carrier is simple and the surface roughness<br>
is small. When dispersed, a correlation between<br>
particle diameter and specific surface area can be<br><br>
obtained. In practice, however, they do not exactly<br>
match because the primary particles contain holes and<br>
cracks. These holes and cracks cause agglomeration and<br>
condensation among the particles. For this reason, the<br>
specific surface area of the carrier, which affects the<br>
degree of dispersion of the supported active catalyst<br>
component, is an important catalyst design indicator.<br>
[0043]<br>
The porous zirconia material preferably<br>
possesses thermal stability. An index of the thermal<br>
stability is such that the weight loss during calcining<br>
at 250°C is preferably not more than 10% of that prior<br>
to calcination. The porous zirconia material according<br>
to the present invention preferably includes hafnium<br>
oxide, and a preferable content thereof is from 0.2 to<br>
5% by weight.<br>
[0044]<br>
The porous zirconia material used as the<br>
carrier for the catalyst according to the present<br>
invention preferably possesses crystallinity in the<br>
same manner as commercially available products which<br>
are commonly used as ceramic materials or catalyst<br>
carriers. The effects of possessing crystallinity are<br>
that, in terms of crystallographic structure, the<br>
structure becomes stable and less susceptible to<br>
volumetric shrinkage of the pores. For these reasons,<br>
the supported active catalyst component can be stably<br>
held in the pores. As a result, catalyst deterioration<br><br>
under the reaction conditions is less likely to occur.<br>
[0045]<br>
In addition to monoclinic systems, tetragonal<br>
systems, cubic systems and such similar systems exist<br>
for zirconia crystal structures. Among these crystal<br>
structures, however, a monoclinic system is preferable.<br>
Because crystallization speeds up deterioration of the<br>
specific surface area and mechanical strength of the<br>
carrier, the degree of crystallization should not be<br>
too high. A preferable crystallinity of the zirconia<br>
should be one so that some crystals can be identified<br>
with respect to crystalline orientation, but others<br>
cannot be identified under observation at about 500,000<br>
times magnification by transmission electron microscopy<br>
(TEM), and crystal peaks of zirconia can be observed<br>
under X-ray analysis.<br>
[0046]<br>
Synthesis of the porous zirconia material<br>
according to the present invention can use a well-known<br>
conventional method, such as sedimentation method, a<br>
hydrolysis method or a hydrothermal method. For<br>
example, synthesis can be carried out by thermal<br>
processing of a zirconia sol obtained from hydrolysis<br>
through heating. Alternatively, synthesis can be<br>
carried out by neutralization by an alkaline chemical,<br>
such as ammonia or the like, of an aqueous solution of<br>
a water-soluble zirconium salt. Furthermore, a<br>
commercially-available zirconia sol can be employed as<br><br>
a raw material to yield a powder precursor by gelation<br>
using an acid or an alkali, or to yield a powder by<br>
subjecting to thermal processing.<br>
Examples of the water-soluble zirconium salts<br>
that can be used in the present invention include<br>
zirconium chloride, zirconium acetate, zirconium<br>
oxalate, potassium hexafluorozirconate (IV), sodium<br>
hexafluorozirconate (IV), zirconium (IV) oxychloride,<br>
zirconium (IV) oxynitrate, zirconium (IV) nitrate,<br>
zirconium (IV) sulfate and the like.<br>
[0047]<br>
The size and shape of the zirconia particles<br>
can be controlled by the formation conditions, such as<br>
the solution concentration, PH, temperature and the<br>
like at the time of synthesis. Generally speaking,<br>
methods can be employed for controlling primary<br>
particle diameter by using liquid-phase processing at a<br>
temperature of 200°C or less for several hours to<br>
several minutes. Methods can also be employed for<br>
controlling secondary particle diameter under liquid-<br>
phase or gas-phase at a temperature of 800°C or less.<br>
However, a negative impact on catalytic performance may<br>
result if the secondary particles are synthesized by<br>
agglomeration of primary particles under acidic<br>
conditions. Thus, it is preferable to synthesize the<br>
secondary particles under neutral conditions or<br>
alkaline conditions, or to subject the primary<br>
particles to a thorough washing treatment prior to<br><br>
agglomeration.<br>
[0048]<br>
The zirconia used as the carrier is<br>
preferably of high purity, as the inclusion of organic<br>
matter or minerals in the agglomerate of the carrier<br>
particles leads to a decrease in catalytic performance.<br>
Conventional processes which employ a template (for<br>
example, JP-A-5-254827 and the process disclosed in<br>
"Studies in Surface Science and Catalysis", 143, pp.<br>
1035-1044 (2002)) are processes which construct<br>
zeolite-type or wormhole-type pores in the carrier.<br>
However, these processes have problems with the<br>
constructed pore attributes and the removal of the<br>
template. Thus, as these processes are not suitable,<br>
as the carrier design required for the present catalyst<br>
is difficult, and the pore design and interstitial-pore<br>
type porous material formed from agglomeration of the<br>
primary particles according to the present invention is<br>
technologically different. A catalyst which uses as a<br>
zirconia carrier obtained under a preparation process<br>
employing a template does not always have sufficient<br>
long-term stability under hydrothermal and acidic<br>
conditions. Further, when such a preparation process<br>
is used, a deterioration in catalytic performance, such<br>
as cycloolefin selectivity or catalytic activity, can<br>
be observed.<br>
[0049]<br>
A process which is generally used for a<br><br>
supported catalyst preparation process can be used as<br>
the process for supporting the active catalyst<br>
component on the carrier. Since, in terms of achieving<br>
high activity, it is important to thoroughly disperse<br>
the catalyst component in the carrier, it is preferable<br>
to use a process which fixes to the carrier walls. For<br>
example, preferable processes include impregnating or<br>
adsorbing the catalyst component into the carrier pores<br>
or surfaces.<br>
[0050]<br>
Alternatively, processes such as an<br>
evaporating-to-dryness process, a liquid-phase<br>
adsorption process, a dipping process, a pore-filling<br>
process, a spray process and the like, can be<br>
preferably employed using a solution in which a<br>
ruthenium compound is dissolved in a suitable solvent.<br>
For a co-precipitation process or mixing process,<br>
however, thorough dispersion of the catalyst component<br>
and realization of high-performance catalytic<br>
performance are difficult, even if limits are not<br>
placed on the pore volume of the carrier, the surface<br>
area, or the supported amount of active catalyst<br>
component. When co-supporting zinc and ruthenium, they<br>
may be supported separately or may be supported<br>
simultaneously. The zinc and ruthenium supported on<br>
the carrier are preferably located in proximity to each<br>
other.<br>
[0051]<br><br>
Thus, the ruthenium-containing active<br>
catalyst component which is dispersibly supported on<br>
the carrier is subjected to reduction treatment in gas<br>
phase or liquid phase. Conventional well-known<br>
reducing agents, such as hydrogen, hydrazine, formalin,<br>
sodium borohydride, formic acid and the like, can be<br>
used as the reducing agent. Hydrogen or hydrazine can<br>
be preferably used. Further, reduction may also be<br>
carried out prior to charging the catalyst into the<br>
reaction system, carried out after charging in the<br>
reaction system, or carried out during the reaction.<br>
The reduction temperature is usually between 50 and<br>
450°C, and preferably from 80 to 250°C.<br>
[0052]<br>
It is thought that several factors contribute<br>
to the solid catalyst of the present invention being<br>
able to maintain long-term catalytic performance with<br>
higher activity and higher selectivity than that of<br>
conventional catalysts as a monocyclic aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon partial hydrogenation catalyst. Such<br>
factors include the carrier being stable, even under<br>
hydrothermal and acidic reaction conditions; the active<br>
hydrogenation component being uniformly and highly<br>
dispersibly supported in the pores of the carrier; the<br>
catalyst not being susceptible to catalyst degradation<br>
from sintering, even under hydrothermal conditions, due<br>
to the fact that the active catalyst component of the<br>
pores is firmly adhered to the carrier; and less<br><br>
susceptibility to poisoning effects than conventional<br>
low support-ratio catalysts since the amount of<br>
catalyst supported per 1 g of carrier can be increased.<br>
[0053]<br>
As the type of usage for the catalyst<br>
according to the present invention, processes that<br>
employ common solid catalysts may be used. Such<br>
processes include a slurry-suspension process or a<br>
fixed-bed flow process employing the catalyst as a<br>
 molded catalyst. In the present invention, water is<br>
required to be present in the reaction system. While<br>
the water content depends on the reaction form, usually<br>
water of from 0.01 to 100 times the weight of the<br>
monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon can be used. It is<br>
 preferable, however, that the liquid phase which<br>
comprises organic material, in which the raw materials<br>
and the generated product are the main constituents<br>
under the reaction condition, and water, forms a two-<br>
liquid phase. In practice, water is preferably from<br>
 0.5 to 20 times the weight of the aromatic hydrocarbon.<br>
[0054]<br>
Further, in the present invention, a process<br>
can be used wherein a metal compound other than the<br>
catalyst component is present in the reaction system.<br>
 Examples of such a metal compound include metal<br>
compounds of periodic law group 1 elements such as<br>
lithium, sodium and potassium; group 2 elements such as<br>
magnesium, calcium and strontium; rare-earth elements<br><br>
such as lanthanum, cerium, samarium and terbium;<br>
manganese, iron, nickel, cobalt, zinc, copper and the<br>
like. The kinds of metal compounds which can be used<br>
include carbonates, acetates, hydrochlorides, sulfates,<br>
nitrates, oxides and hydroxides.<br>
[0055]<br>
The amount of these compounds present in the<br>
reaction system can be appropriately selected depending<br>
on the respective component characteristics and<br>
reaction form. The metal compound may be used singly<br>
or 2 or more kinds may be used simultaneously. The<br>
presence of zinc salts, in particular, greatly improves<br>
catalytic performance. As effective compounds thereof,<br>
zinc sulfate, zinc hydroxide and zinc oxide are<br>
preferable. Among these, zinc sulfate is most<br>
preferable. If an aqueous zinc sulfate is used, the<br>
concentration range is preferably within 0.1 to 30% by<br>
weight as zinc sulfate in the aqueous solution. In<br>
addition, basic zinc salts which are hardly soluble<br>
zinc compounds can also coexist as the zinc compound in<br>
the reaction system.<br>
[0056]<br>
"Hardly soluble zinc compounds" indicates<br>
zinc salts which include a hydroxyl group or an oxygen<br>
atom which are considered as a separate negative<br>
constituent to the conjugate base residue of the<br>
various acids; or zinc compounds which do not readily<br>
dissolve in the reaction system. Examples include the<br><br>
double salt of zinc sulfate and zinc hydroxide. It is<br>
not necessary for these hardly-soluble zinc compounds<br>
to completely dissolve in the reaction system. The<br>
amount used when employing such a hardly-soluble zinc<br>
compound should be no more than 3 times the weight of<br>
the catalyst amount including the carrier. The metal<br>
compound present in the reaction system may completely<br>
exist as ions, exist as a compound, or in a state<br>
wherein the two are mixed.<br>
[0057]<br>
In the present invention, the co-existing<br>
water phases are preferably reacted while being kept<br>
under neutral or acidic conditions. If a water phase<br>
becomes alkaline, the reaction rate dramatically<br>
decreases and, thus, is not preferable. A water phase<br>
PH of from 0.5 to less than 7 is preferable, and more<br>
preferable is from 2 to 6.5.<br>
[0058]<br>
The "monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon" which<br>
serves as a raw material to be used in the production<br>
process of a cycloolefin according to the present<br>
invention refers to benzene, toluene, xylene and lower-<br>
alkyl benzenes. The conditions for the partial<br>
hydrogenation reaction may be appropriately selected<br>
depending on the type and amount of the catalyst and<br>
additives to be used. The hydrogen pressure is from<br>
0.1 to 20 MPa, and preferably from 1 to 10 Mpa. The<br>
reaction temperature is in the range of from 50 to<br><br>
250°C, and preferably from 100 to 200°C. The reaction<br>
time can be appropriately selected by setting an actual<br>
goal for the selectivity and yield of the desired<br>
cycloolefin. Although there are no particular<br>
restrictions, the reaction time is usually from several<br>
seconds to several hours.<br>
[0059]<br>
The present invention will now be explained<br>
in more detail by referring to examples; however, the<br>
present invention is in no way to be restricted to<br>
these examples. In addition, the evaluation methods of<br>
the various physical properties will be described in<br>
the following.<br>
[0060]<br>
(Carrier Particle Diameter Measurement)<br>
Measurement of the carrier particle diameter<br>
was carried out by observation using a Hitachi HD-2000<br>
electron microscope and by using a Nikkiso Microtrac<br>
UPA. Measurement of the average primary particle<br>
diameter determined the length (Martin diameter) of<br>
segments that divided the projected area of the<br>
particles into two in a fixed direction, based on a<br>
projected image observed using an electron microscope.<br>
Specifically, the same number of each of 20 or more<br>
large, medium and small points were observed from a<br>
500,000 times or more magnified projected image,<br>
wherein the number average diameter based on the<br>
measured results of a total of not less than 60 points<br><br>
was taken as the average primary particle diameter.<br>
(Catalyst Particle Diameter Measurement)<br>
Catalyst particle diameter measurement was<br>
carried out in the same manner as that for the above-<br>
described carrier particle diameter measurement.<br>
[0061]<br>
(Average Ruthenium Crystallite Diameter Measurement)<br>
Average ruthenium crystallite diameter<br>
measurement was measured using a Mac Science MPX18 X-<br>
ray diffractometer. Specifically, the half-width of<br>
the diffraction peak at a diffraction angle (29) 44° of<br>
the ruthenium metal obtained from X-ray diffractometer<br>
measurement was measured, for determination using the<br>
Scherrer formula.<br>
[0062]<br>
(Other Measurements)<br>
Pore diameter, specific surface area and pore<br>
volume were measured using a Yuasa-Ionics Autosorb 3MP<br>
apparatus and selecting nitrogen as the adsorption gas.<br>
Specific surface area used desorption data obtained<br>
from the BET method. Pore diameter and pore<br>
distribution used desorption data obtained from the BJH<br>
method, and pore volume employed the adsorption data<br>
from P/PO at Max. The catalyst metal composition was<br>
measured using Rigaku fluorescent X-ray analyzer.<br>
Measurement of the elution component in the reaction<br>
field was measured using a Rigaku JY-138-ICP emission<br>
analyzer.<br><br>
[0063]<br>
(Catalyst Reaction Performance Evaluation)<br>
Reaction evaluation was carried out using a<br>
batch method employing an autoclave, wherein reaction<br>
solution removed from time to time was analyzed using a<br>
gas chromatograph (GC-14B manufactured by Shimadzu<br>
Corporation) equipped with an FID detector. The below-<br>
described benzene conversion ratio and cyclohexene<br>
selectivity were calculated using the following<br>
calculation formulae (1) and (2) based on the<br>
experiment concentration analysis values.<br>
[0064]<br>
[Expression 1]<br><br>
Further, "activity with respect to ruthenium"<br>
expresses the benzene conversion rate (g/Hr) with<br>
respect to Ru metal (g) contained in the catalyst,<br><br>
which was calculated using the following calculation<br>
formula (3) with a conversion ratio of 50% as a<br>
reference.<br>

[Example 1]<br>
(1) Porous zirconia material Synthesis<br>
While stirring 500 g of a hafnium oxide-<br>
10 containing zirconia sol (nitric acid stabilizer-<br>
solution with a 10 wt% zirconia content; manufactured<br>
by Newtecks Co., Ltd.) at 40°C, 25% ammonia water was<br>
slowly charged thereto. This solution was stirred for<br>
1 hour under heating at 80°C, and then subjected to<br>
15 reduced-pressure drying at 90°C using an evaporator to<br>
thereby form a solid. This mass of solidified powder<br>
was ground, then, using 0.5 N sodium hydroxide, mixed<br>
under stirring into an aqueous alkali solution for 1<br>
hour at 60°C. The resulting solution was then<br>
20 repeatedly washed with water and filtered. The<br>
resulting filtrate was then dried at 110°C using a<br>
vacuum dryer, which was then calcined at 250°C to yield<br>
47 g of a white powder. Results of measurement of the<br><br>
specific surface area and pore distribution of this<br>
white powder using a nitrogen adsorption and desorption<br>
method showed 1.5 wt% hafnium oxide-containing zirconia<br>
which had a specific surface area of 229 m2/g. The pore<br>
volume was 0.31 cm3/g and the average pore diameter was<br>
3.5 ran. The pore volume of pore diameters 2.5 to 15 nm<br>
was 85.1% by volume of the total pore volume of pore<br>
diameters 2 to 150 nm. It was learned from observation<br>
using an electron microscope and particle size<br>
distribution measurement that the physical properties<br>
of the powder were an average primary particle diameter<br>
of 4.7 nm and an average secondary particle diameter of<br>
2.3 µm.<br>
[0068]<br>
(2) Catalyst Preparation<br>
An aqueous solution in which 8.9 g of zinc<br>
nitrate was dissolved was charged with 20 g of the<br>
hafnium oxide-containing zirconia porous material<br>
obtained above, which solution was then subjected to<br>
reduced-pressure drying at 80°C using an evaporator.<br>
After calcining the resulting product for 2 hours at<br>
350°C and supporting a zinc component thereon, the<br>
product was subjected to, in order, alkali treatment,<br>
washing and drying in the same manner as the porous<br>
zirconia material. The resulting powder was charged in<br>
an aqueous solution containing 22.24 g of aqueous<br>
ruthenium chloride (9.99% by weight ruthenium content<br>
solution) in distilled water, wherein after a<br><br>
supporting operation of the ruthenium component was<br>
carried out in the same manner as the zinc support<br>
described above. The resulting product was then<br>
reduced under a hydrogen atmosphere at 200°C, to thereby<br>
yield a catalyst having a solid weight of 17 g.<br>
Analysis of this catalyst using an X-ray diffractometer<br>
showed an average crystallite diameter of the ruthenium<br>
of 2.5 nm. The results of measurement of the ruthenium<br>
and zinc content using a fluorescent X-ray analyzer are<br>
shown in Table 1. Measurement of the catalyst<br>
properties other than those described above was carried<br>
out in the same manner as that for the physical<br>
property measurement of the porous zirconia material,<br>
wherein primary particles were 5.5 nm and secondary<br>
particles were 2.3 µm. Average pore diameter was 3.5<br>
nm and the pore volume of pore diameters 2.5 to 15 nm<br>
was 8 6.7% by volume of the total pore volume. It was<br>
also learned that the catalyst had a specific surface<br>
area of 201 m2/g.<br>
[0069]<br>
(3) Benzene Partial Hydrogenation<br>
A 1 liter autoclave was charged with 2 g of<br>
the above-described solid catalyst and 280 ml of an<br>
aqueous 10% by weight zinc sulfate solution, and purged<br>
with hydrogen while stirring. The temperature was<br>
raised to 150°C, and then hydrogen was further added<br>
under pressure to give a total pressure of 5 MPa. The<br>
resulting solution was left in this state for 22 hours<br><br>
then subjected to reaction pre-processing of the<br>
catalyst slurry. The autoclave pressure was<br>
subsequently once lowered to 3 MPa, then 140 ml of<br>
benzene were added under pressure along with hydrogen.<br>
The resulting solution was reacted under high-speed<br>
stirring at a total pressure of 5 MPa. Reaction<br>
solution was removed from time to time to obtain<br>
reaction selectivity and activity from the results of<br>
analysis of the liquid-phase composition by gas<br>
chromatography. Cyclohexene selectivity and the<br>
activity with respect to ruthenium when the ratio of<br>
benzene conversion was 50% are shown in Table 1. The<br>
post-reaction catalyst was removed from the autoclave,<br>
whereupon results of X-ray analysis showed that the<br>
ruthenium average crystal diameter was 2.7 nm, which<br>
was almost unchanged from that before reaction.<br>
[0070]<br>
[Example 2]<br>
A hafnium oxide-containing porous zirconia<br>
material was synthesized in the same manner as that of<br>
(1) in Example 1, except that 45 g of white powder was<br>
yielded by charging the above-describe zirconia sol<br>
into a 1 liter autoclave, wherein the synthesis time<br>
was extended to 10 hours at 120°C, and the calcining<br>
conditions were changed to 400°C. Results of<br>
measurement of the specific surface area and pore<br>
diameter of this white powder using a nitrogen<br>
adsorption and desorption method showed a specific<br><br>
surface area of 109 m2/g, a pore volume of 0.34 cm3/g,<br>
and an average pore diameter of 5.9 nm. The pore<br>
volume of pore diameters 2.5 to 15 nm was 66.4% by<br>
volume of the total pore volume of pore diameters 2 to<br>
150 nm. It was learned from observation using an<br>
electron microscope and particle size distribution<br>
measurement for seeing the particle structure of this<br>
powder that the physical properties of the powder were<br>
an average primary particle diameter of 10.1 nm and an<br>
average secondary particle diameter of 4.1 |µm. Next,<br>
using this hafnium oxide-containing porous zirconia<br>
material, a catalyst was prepared using the same<br>
catalyst preparation process as that of (2) in Example<br>
1. The primary particles of this catalyst were 9.5 nm<br>
and the secondary particles were 3.9 µm. The average<br>
pore diameter was 6.2 nm, and the pore volume of pore<br>
diameters 2.5 to 15 nm was 61.7% by volume of the total<br>
pore volume. It was also learned that the catalyst had<br>
a specific surface area of 111 m2/g. Furthermore, using<br>
this catalyst, after pre-processing of the catalyst in<br>
the same manner as that in (3) of Example 1, a reaction<br>
evaluation was performed. The ruthenium content and<br>
zinc content of the prepared catalyst, and the reaction<br>
results are shown in Table 1. The pre- and post-<br>
reaction ruthenium average crystallite diameter were<br>
2.6 nm, wherein no change was observed.<br>
[0071]<br>
[Example 3]<br><br>
A 1 liter autoclave was charged with 4 g of<br>
the solid catalyst prepared in Example 2 and 280 ml of<br>
an aqueous 10% by weight zinc sulfate solution, and<br>
purged with hydrogen while stirring. The temperature<br>
was raised to 170°C, and then hydrogen was further added<br>
under pressure to give a total pressure of 5 MPa. The<br>
resulting solution was left in this state for 140 hours<br>
then subjected to reaction pre-processing of the<br>
catalyst slurry. The autoclave temperature was<br>
subsequently lowered to 150°C and the pressure to 3 MPa,<br>
then 140 ml of benzene were added under pressure along<br>
with hydrogen. The resulting solution was reacted<br>
under high-speed stirring at a total pressure of 5 MPa.<br>
Reaction solution was removed from time to time to<br>
obtain the analysis of the oil-phase composition by gas<br>
chromatography. Cyclohexene selectivity and the<br>
activity with respect to ruthenium were measured when<br>
the ratio of benzene conversion was 50%. The reaction<br>
results are shown in Table 1. The post-reaction<br>
catalyst was removed from the autoclave, whereupon<br>
results of X-ray diffraction showed that the ruthenium<br>
average crystallite diameter was 2.8 nm, which was<br>
almost unchanged from that before reaction.<br>

[Comparative Example 1]<br>
(1) Porous Zirconia Material Synthesis<br>
A mixed solution containing 140.1 g of 70%<br>
zirconium tetrapropoxide (manufactured by Aldrich<br><br>
Corp.), 150 ml of ethanol and 6 ml of acetyl acetone<br>
was slowly dropped under stirring into a solution<br>
containing 150 ml of distilled water, 150 ml of<br>
ethanol and 32.7 g of cethyltrimethyl ammonium<br>
bromide. The resulting solution was thoroughly mixed<br>
under stirring at room temperature, and left to stand.<br>
This resulting solution was transferred into an<br>
autoclave, stirred at 120°C, then filtered and washed.<br>
After drying, the resulting mixture was washed with<br>
ethanol, and again dried to yield 28.8 g of a white<br>
powder. Results of measurement of the specific<br>
surface area and pore distribution of this white<br>
powder using a nitrogen adsorption and desorption<br>
method showed a specific surface area of 501 m2/g, a<br>
pore volume of 0.93 cm3/g, and an average pore diameter<br>
of 6.7 nm. The pore volume of pore diameters 2.5 to<br>
15 nm was 38.1% by volume of the total pore volume of<br>

observation using an electron microscope and particle<br>
size distribution measurement that the physical<br>
properties of the powder were an average primary<br>
particle diameter of 2.2 nm and an average secondary<br>
particle diameter of 2.5 urn.<br>

Hydrogenation<br>
Using the above-described porous zirconia<br>
material, a catalyst was prepared using the same<br>
catalyst preparation process as that of (2) in Example<br><br>
1. Using the catalyst, pre-processing of the catalyst<br>
slurry was carried out in the same manner as that in<br>
Example 3, and the reaction was evaluated.- In<br>
contrast to the pre-reaction ruthenium average<br>
crystallite diameter of 2.5 run, post-reaction<br>
ruthenium average crystallite diameter was 5.5 nm,<br>
whereby it was clear from these results that the<br>
ruthenium average crystallite diameter had increased.<br>
The ruthenium content and zinc content of the prepared<br>
catalyst, and the reaction results are shown in Table<br>

electron microscope and particle size distribution<br>
measurement that the physical properties of the powder<br>
were an average primary particle diameter of 82.3 nm<br>
and an average secondary particle diameter of 9.5 µm.<br>
Results of measurement of the physical properties after<br>
catalyst preparation showed an average primary particle<br>
diameter of 59.5 nm and an average secondary particle<br>
diameter of 6.6 µm of this catalyst. In addition, the<br>

volume of the total pore volume. Specific surface area<br>
was 19 m2/g. Results of measurement of the post<br>
catalysis ruthenium average crystallite diameter using<br>
an X-ray diffractometer were 4.6 nm. The catalyst<br>
after reaction was recovered. The ruthenium average<br>
crystallite diameter was 6.5 nm. That is, it was<br>
learned that the ruthenium was subjected to sintering<br>
in the reaction field.<br>
[0075]<br>
[Comparative Example 3]<br>
Catalyst preparation was carried out in the<br>
same manner as that of (2) in Example 1, except that<br><br>
zirconium hydroxide from Kojundo Chemical Laboratory<br>
Co., Ltd., was made to serve as the carrier. The<br>
catalyst was evaluated through reaction according to<br>
the same procedure as those of Example 3. The reaction<br>
results are shown in Table 1. In addition to<br>
measurement of the specific surface area and pore<br>
distribution of the zirconium hydroxide obtained in the<br>
same manner as that described above, the post-catalysis<br>
ruthenium and zinc were also measured for their<br>

catalyst analysis results, the average crystallite<br>
diameter of post-catalysis ruthenium was measured at<br>
2.8 nm. The post-reaction catalyst was recovered,<br>
wherein the results of measurement of the ruthenium<br>
average crystallite diameter using an X-ray<br>

distilled water, 160 g of ethanol and 20 g of<br>
cethyltrimethyl ammonium bromide, which were made to<br>
dissolve under stirring. The resulting solution was<br><br>
slowly charged with 85 g of tetraethyl ortho-silicate,<br>
thoroughly mixed under stirring, and left to stand at<br>
room temperature. The resulting solution was filtered,<br>
washed and then dried to obtain 22.1 g of a white<br>
powder by calcining at 550°C. Results of measurement of<br>
the physical properties of this white powder showed a<br>
specific surface area of 830 m2/g and a pore volume of<br>
1.78 cm3/g. Subsequently, 20 g of the above-described<br>
white powder was soaked in an aqueous solution in which<br>
18 g of zirconium oxychloride octahydrate was<br>

electron microscope and particle size distribution<br>
measurement that the physical properties of the powder<br>

Using the above-described zirconia surface-<br>
modified silica porous material, a catalyst was<br>
prepared using the same catalyst preparation process as<br>
that of (2) in Example 1, and this catalyst was used<br>
for reaction evaluation using the same method as that<br>
of Example 3. The pre-reaction physical properties of<br>
the catalyst were an average primary particle diameter<br>
of 4.3 nm and an average secondary particle diameter of<br>
8.9 µm The average pore diameter was 4.8 nm, and the<br>
pore volume of pore diameters 2.5 to 15 nm was 64.2% by<br>

was 251 m2/g, while the average crystallite diameter of<br>
the ruthenium could not be measured from the X-ray<br>
diffraction image since it was 2 nm or less. The<br>
average crystallite diameter of the post-reaction<br>
ruthenium was 3.3 nm, whereby ruthenium crystal growth<br>
was observed. The ruthenium content and zinc content<br>
of the prepared catalyst, and the reaction results, are<br>
shown in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
[0079]<br>

the hafnium oxide-containing zirconia material<br>
synthesized in (2) of Example 1 and 100 g of an aqueous<br>
10% by weight zinc sulfate solution, and stirred for 3<br>
hours at 60°C. The stirred solution was then filtered<br>
using a 0.2 µm membrane filter, and the resulting<br>
filtrate was sampled to determine the zirconium elution<br>
amount contained in the filtrate. The results showed<br>
that the amount of zirconium in the aqueous solution<br>
was at the analytical method detection limits of 2 ppm<br>
or less. For comparison, 5 g of the zirconia surface-<br>
modified silica material synthesized in (1) of<br>
Comparative Example 4 were processed in the same manner<br>
to determine the silicon elution amount contained in<br>
that filtrate. Those results showed that the amount of<br>
silicon in the aqueous solution was 330 PPM.<br>

porous zirconia material used in Example 2. The<br>
resulting solution was dried under reduced pressure at<br>
80°C, and then the dried residue was subjected to<br>

room temperature. The resulting product was then<br>
subjected to, in order, alkali treatment for 1 hour at<br>
60°C, washing at room temperature, filtering and drying<br>
under reduced pressure at 110°C. After drying, the<br>
catalyst was not subjected to a reduction operation.<br>

was 119 m2/g. Using this catalyst, after pre-processing<br>
of the catalyst using the same process as that of (3)<br>
of Example 1, the reaction was evaluated under the same<br>
conditions. The reaction results and the ruthenium<br>
content of the catalyst are shown in Table 2. The<br>
post-reaction catalyst was removed, and results of<br>
measuring the X-ray diffraction showed an average<br>
crystallite diameter of the ruthenium of 2.7 nm.<br>
Further, the average primary particle diameter of the<br>
recovered catalyst was 8.5 nm and the average secondary<br>
particle diameter of the same was 3.3 µm.<br>

containing solution with a 10 wt% zirconia content;<br>
manufactured by Newtecks Co., Ltd.), and then charged<br>
with a 5 wt.% aqueous solution of lanthanum acetate<br>
under stirring. After this solution was thoroughly<br>
stirred at room temperature, a spray dryer was used for<br>
spray drying, then the resulting powder was calcined to<br>
obtain 410 g of a white powder which supported 20% by<br>
weight of lanthanum by oxide conversion. This powder<br>
had a specific surface area of 64 m2/g, a pore volume of<br>
0.32 cm3/g and an average pore diameter of 22.7 nm. The<br>
pore volume of pore diameters 2.5 to 15 nm was 18.6% by<br>
volume of the total pore volume of pore diameters 2 to<br>

solution, and purged with hydrogen under stirring.<br>
After the temperature was raised to 170°C, hydrogen was<br>
further added under pressure to give a total pressure<br>
of 5 MPa. The resulting solution was left in this<br>
state for 140 hours then subjected to reaction pre-<br>
processing of the catalyst slurry. The autoclave<br>
temperature was subsequently lowered to 150°C and the<br>
pressure to 3 MPa, then 140 ml of benzene were added<br>
under pressure along with hydrogen, and the resulting<br>
solution was reacted under high-speed stirring at a<br>
total pressure of 5 MPa. Reaction solution was removed<br>
from time to time for analysis of the oil-phase<br>
composition by gas chromatography. Cyclohexene<br>
selectivity and the activity with respect to ruthenium<br>
