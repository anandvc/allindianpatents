BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Bibliographic details of references provided in the subject specification are listed at the end of the specification<br>
Reference to any prior art m this specification is not, and should not be taken as, an acknowledgment or any form of suggestion that this prior art forms part of the common general knowledge in any country<br>
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, encoded by the CSF-3 gene) is a hematopoietic growth factor that regulates the production of granulocytes (Nicola et al, Nature 314 625, 1985, Metcalf, International Journal of Cancer 25 225, 1980, Nicola et al, Journal of Biological Chemistry 258 9017, 1983) G-CSF mediates its effects through interaction with the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR, encoded by the CSFR-3 gene), a member of the type I cytokine receptor superfamily (Demetri et al, Blood 78   2791-2808, 1991)  Major biological actions of G-CSF in humans and mice,<br><br>

include increasing the production and release of neutrophils from the bone marrow (Souza et al, Science 232 61, 1986, Lord et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 86 9499-9503, 1989), mobilizing hematopoietic progenitor cells from the marrow into the peripheral Wood (Bungart et al, British Journal of Haematology 22 1156, 1990, de Haan et al, Blood 86 2986-2992, 1995, Roberts et al, Blood 89 2736-2744, 1997), and modulating the differentiation and effector functions of mature neutrophils (Yong et al, European Journal of Haematology 49 251-259, 1992, Colotta et al, Blood 80 2012-2020, 1992, Rex et al, Transfusion 35 605-611, 1995, Gencke et al, Journal of Leukocyte Biology 57 455-461, 1995, Xu et al, British Journal of Haematology 93 558-568, 1996, Yong, British Journal of Haematology 94 40-47, 1996, Jacob et al, Blood 92 353-361,1998) G-CSF is used to treat neutropema, as well as mobilisation of haemopoietic stem cells (HSC) for autologous and allogenic stem cell transplantation (Welte et al, Blood 88  1907-1929, 1996)<br>
Use of G-CSF for HSC mobilization can cause exacerbations of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (Snowden et al, Bone Marrow Transplantation 22   1035-1041, 1998) G-CSF along with colony stimulating factors, GM-CSF  and M-CSF  are produced by human  synovial fibroblasts and chondrocytes in response to IL-1 and TNF in vitro (Leizer et al, Blood 76 1989-1996, 1990, Hamilton et al, Blood 79   1413-1419, 1992), and G-CSF has been found in the serum and synovial fluid of RA patients (Tanabe et al, Rheumatology International 16 67-76, 1996, Nakamura et al, Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology 18   713-718, 2000)  Systemic administration of G-CSF has been shown to exacerbate munne collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) with increased severity and incidence of disease in DBA/1 mice (Campbell et al, Journal of Leukocyte Biology 68  144-150, 2000), as well as a passive transfer model  of CIA in lats (Miyahara et al,  Clinical Immunology and Immunopathology  69   69-76,   1993)   G-CSF  transgenic  mice  have  increased  bone resorption and reduced bone formation (Takahashi et al, Laboratory Investigation 74 827-834, 1996), indicating that G-CSF may have a role in bone turnover<br>
G-CSF is able to expand a monocyte/macrophage subset and induce anti-inflammatory cytokines that can protect against endotoxemia in mice (Gorgen et al, Journal of Immunology 149   918, 1992)  G-CSF has also been reported to impair allogeneic and<br><br>

rnitogenic T cell responses in both humans and mice (Foster et al, Transplantation 59 1557, 1995, Pan et al, Blood 86 4422, 1995), and to cause a shift of the T cell cytokine profile towards Th2 cytokine production, with a corresponding reduction in Thl IFN-? expression (Pan et al, 1995, supra, Franzke et al, Blood 102 734-739) In munne studies, this deviation to Th2 cytokine production has been associated with protection against acute graft-versus-host disease, experimental autoimmune encephalomyehtis (EAE) and spontaneous systemic lupus erythematosus (Pan et al, 1995, supra, Zavala et al, Journal of Immunology 163 5125-5132, 1999, Zavala et al, Journal of Immunology 168 2011-2019, 2000) Mice deficient in G-CSF were protected from neutrophi1-mediated glomerulonephritis, but not T cell/macrophage-mediated glomerulonephntis (Katching et al, Journal of the American Society ofNephrologh 13 350-358, 2000)<br>
G-CSF is, therefore, a pleiotropic molecule with a range of functions There is a need to more fully characterize these functions and to elucidate if modulation of these functions can lead to health benefits<br><br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Throughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word "comprise", or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated element or integer or group of elements or integers but not the exclusion of any other element or integer or group of elements or integers<br>
The role of neutrophils was studied in a murine model of arthritis The murine model included use of antibodies to deplete neutrophils as well as the use of a G-CSF knockout mouse It was determined that these mice were highly resistant to the induction of acute arthritis, but this effect did not seem to be explained by the lower neutrophil counts It was similarly found that G-CSF could directly induce joint inflammation by local administration and that systemic G-CSF could substitute for IL-1 in the model of acute arthritis<br>
Collagen induced arthritis (CIA) is a chionic autoimmune model widely used to investigate rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis and for evaluation of prospective therapies To examine the requirement for endogenous G-CSF in chronic joint disease, G-CSF% and wild-type (WT) mice were immunized with chick Type II collagen (CII) in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) to induce CIA There was marked protection from disease in mice deficient in G-CSF, identifying a major role for G-CSF in CIA T cell responses to CII were normal in G-CSF knockout mice<br>
Collectively, this shows that endogenous G-CSF plays a major role in inflammatory arthritis Down-regulating G-CSF activity, locally or systemically or reducing levels of G-CSF or inhibiting or down-regulating the G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR), is proposed to be a useful mechanism to treat or reduce the seventy of inflammatory conditions such as chronic inflammatory arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis or other chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease conditions<br>
Accordingly, the present invention contemplates a method for the prophylaxis and/or<br><br>

treatment of an inflammatory condition by administering to a subject an agent which inhibits the activity of, or reduces the level of, an inflammatory cytokine such as but not limited to G-CSF or its functional equivalents or homologs or its receptor (G-CSFR)<br>
The therapeutic efficacy of administration of a neutralising monoclonal antibody (mAb) to G-CSF was tested in the acute arthritis model Inhibition of G-CSF during acute arthritis resulted in a dose dependent reduction in myeloid lineage cells in the BM, neutropema in the peripheral blood and reduced cellular infiltration of the involved joint<br>
The present invention further provides agents and pharmaceutical compositions comprising such agents which inhibit the activity of or down-regulate expression of a gene encoding G-CSF and/or other inflammatory cytokines and/or their receptors<br>
The present invention further provides an animal model for studying chronic inflammation and its use in screening for agents useful in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of an inflammatory condition such as inflammatory arthritis<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is predicated in part on the further elucidation of the role of inflammatory cytokines in the inflammatory process More particularly, the role of G-CSF is postulated to have an effect on inflammatory conditions such as chronic immune-mediated inflammation In accordance with the present invention, therefore, inhibiting the activity of the inflammatory cytokine locally or systemically and/or down-regulating expression of a gene encoding an inflammatory cytokine is proposed to be useful in the treatment or prophylaxis of an inflammatory condition<br>
Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention contemplates a method for the treatment or prophylaxis of an inflammatory condition in an animal or avian species, said method comprising administering to said animal or avian species an effective amount of an agent which inhibits the activity of an inflammatory cytokine or its receptor and/or which reduces the level of expression of the gene encoding said inflammatory cytokine or its receptor<br>
The present invention is particularly directed to G-CSF and its homologs and derivatives Reference to "G-CSF" or its full name "granulocyte-colony stimulating factor" includes it homologs and derivatives A "homolog" or "derivative" includes polymorphic variants of G-CSF Reference herein to G-CSF may also be read as applying to other inflammatory cytokines<br>
Accordingly, another aspect of the present invention provides a method for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of an inflammatory condition in an animal or avian species, said method comprising administering to said animal an agent which inhibits the activity of G-CSF and/or which reduces the level of expression of the gene encoding G-CSF or G-CS1 R<br><br>

The administration may be systemic or local Local administration is particularly useful in the treatment of localized or inflammatory conditions such as arthritis However, as it is likely that G-CSF exerts effects on haemopoietic cells, systemic administration may be useful in modulating the immune system in general Reference to "systemic" includes intra-articuiar, intravenous, intrapentoneal, subcutaneous and intrathecal administration as well as administration via oral, rectal and nasal routes<br>
The term "inflammatory condition' is used in its broadest context but particularly encompasses immune system-mediated inflammatory condition In a particularly important embodiment, the inflammatory condition is inflammatory arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis (RA)<br>
Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, the present invention contemplates a method for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of an inflammatory arthritis or other chronic immune-mediated inflammatory condition in an animal or avian species, said method comprising administering to said animal or avian species an agent which inhibits the activity of G-CSF or G-CSFR and/or which reduces the level of expression of the gene encoding G-CSF or G-CSFR<br>
The preferred animals are mammals such as humans and other primates, livestock animals (e g sheep, cows, horses, donkeys, pigs), laboratory test animals (e g rabbits, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs), companion animals (e g dogs, cats) and captive wild animals Avian species include poultry birds (e g chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, bantams), game birds (e g ducks, emus, pheasants) and caged avian birds Humans are the most preferred animals of the primates Horses are particularly preferred of the livestock animals<br>
In a preferred embodiment, therefore, the present invention provides a method for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of an inflammatory condition in a human, said method comprising administering to said human an agent which inhibits the activity of G-CSF or G-CSFR and/or which reduces the level of expression of the gene encoding G-CSF or G-CSFR<br><br>

The agents may be proteinaceous, non-proteinaceous (e g chemical entities) or nucleic acid molecules<br>
Protemaceous and non-proteinaceous molecules include peptides, polypeptides and proteins, small, intermediate or large chemical molecules as well as molecules identified from natural product screening or the screening of chemical libraries Natural product screening includes the screening of extracts or samples from plants, microorganisms, soil river beds, coral, aquatic environments and extraterrestrial environments for molecules or groups of molecules which have an affect on G-CSF activity or the level of G-CSF gene expression These molecules may also affect G-CSF/G-CSFR interaction<br>
One example of an agent is an antibody to G-CSF or G-CSFR or epitopes thereon This could be used systemically or locally<br>
The use of monoclonal antibodies is particularly preferred because of the ability to produce them in large quantities and the homogeneity of the product The preparation of hybridoma cell lines for monoclonal antibody production derived by fusing an immortal cell line and lymphocytes sensitized against the immunogemc preparation can be done by techniques which are well known to those who are skilled in the art (See, for example, Domllard and Hoffman, Basic Facts about Hybridomas, in Compendium of Immunology Vol II, ed by Schwartz, 1981, Kohler and Milstein, Nature 256 495-499, 1975, Kohler and Milstein, European Journal of Immunology 6 511-519, 1976)<br>
Another example of a useful agent is a soluble form of the G-CSFR which competes with G-CSF interaction with the membrane-associated G-CSFR<br>
Alternatively, agents can be screened for their ability to bind to G-CSF or G-CSFR-genetic materials In one embodiment, G-CSF- or G-CSFR- encoding cDNA or genomic DNA or mRNA transcript or portion thereof such as an EST or SAGE tag is immobilized to a solid support such as a nanoparticle or microsphere   Potential agents are then brought into<br><br>

contact with the immobilized nucleic acid molecules and binding detected by change in radiation, emissions, atom excitation, mass and/or density<br>
Once identified, the agent is eluted off the nucleic acid molecule and characterized in more detail For example, agents which bind to G-CSF/G-CSFR genetic material may inhibit expression (transcription and/or translation)<br>
The present invention further contemplates using chemical analogs of G-CSF or G-CSFR as antagonists of G-CSF or its receptors As indicated above, soluble G-CSF receptors may also be employed<br>
Chemical analogs contemplated herein include, but are not limited to, modifications of side chains, incorporation of unnatural ammo acids and/or their derivatives during peptide, polypeptide or protein synthesis and the use of crosshnkers and other methods which impose conformational constraints on the proteinaceous molecule or their analogs<br>
Examples of side chain modifications contemplated by the present invention include modifications of ammo groups such as by reductive alkylation by reaction with an aldehyde followed by reduction with NaBH4 amidination with methylacetimidate, acylation with acetic anhydride, carbamoylation of amino groups with cyanate, tnmtrobenzylation of amino groups with 2, 4, 6-tnnitrobenzene sulphomc acid (TNBS), acylation of ammo groups with succinic anhydride and tetrahydrophthahc anhydride, and pyndoxylation of lysine with pyridoxal-5-phosphate followed by reduction withNaBH4<br>
The guanidine group of arginine residues may be modified by the formation of heterocyclic condensation products wilh reagents such as 2,3-butanedione, phenylglyoxal and glyoxal<br>
The carboxyl group may be modified by carbodumide activation via O-acylisourea formation followed by subsequent denvitisation, for example, to a corresponding amide<br><br>
WO 2004/017727	PCT/AU2003/001078<br>
-16-<br>
Sulphydryl groups may be modified by methods such as carboxyrnethylation with lodoacetic acid or lodoacetamide, performic acid oxidation to cysteic acid, formation of a mixed disulphides with other thiol compounds, reaction with maleimide, maleic anhydride or other substituted maleimide, formation of mercurial derivatives using 4-chloromercunbenzoate, 4-chloromercuriphenylsulphonic acid, phenylmercury chloride, 2-chloromercun-4-rutrophenol and other mercurials, carbamoylation with cyanate at alkaline pH<br>
Tryptophan residues may be modified by, for example, oxidation with N-bromosuccinimide or alkylation of the indole ring with 2-hydroxy-5-mtrobenzyl bromide or sulphenyl hahdes Tyrosine residues on the other hand, may be altered by nitration with tetramtromethane to form a 3-mtrotyrosine derivative<br>
Modification of the imidazole ring of a histidine residue may be accomplished by alkylation with odoacetic acid derivatives or N-carbethoxylation with diethylpyrocarbonate<br>
Examples of incorporating unnatural amino acids and derivatives during peptide synthesis include, but are not limited to, use of norleucine, 4-amino butyric acid, 4-ammo-3-hydroxy-5-phenylpentanoic acid, 6-aminohexanoic acid, t-butylglycine, norvahne, phenylglycine, ornithine, sarcosme, 4-ammo-3-hydroxy-6-methylheptanoic acid, 2-thienyl alanine and/or D-isomers of ammo acids A list of unnatural amino acid, contemplated herein is shown in Table 2<br><br>

Crosshnkers can be used, for example, to stabilize 3D conformations, using homo-bifunctional crosshnkers such as the bifunctional lmido esters having (CH2)n spacer groups with n=l to n=6, glutaraldehyde, N-hydroxysuccmimide esters and hetero-bifunctional reagents which usually contain an amino-reactive moiety such as N-hydroxysuccinimide and another group specific-reactive moiety such as maleimido or dithio moiety (SH) or carbodnmide (COOH) In addition, peptides can be conformationally constrained by, for example, incorporation of C( and N (-methylammo acids, introduction of double bonds between C( and C atoms of amino acids and the formation of cyclic peptides or analogs by introducing covalent bonds such as forming an amide bond between the N and C termini, between two side chains or between a side chain and the N or C terminus<br>
Nucleic acid molecules such as RNA or DNA are particularly useful for inducing gene silencing by antisense- or sense-mediated mechanisms Sense-mediated gene silencing is also referred to as co-suppression and involves a range of mechanisms including the induction of RNAi<br>
The terms "nucleic acids", "nucleotide" and "polynucleotide" include RNA, cDNA, genomic DNA, synthetic forms and mixed polymers, both sense and antisense strands, and may be chemically or biochemically modified or may contain non-natural or derivatized nucleotide bases, as will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art Such modifications include, for example, labels, methylation, substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog (such as the morphohne ring), internucleotide modifications such as uncharged linkages (e g methyl phosphonates, phosphotnesters, phosphoamidates, carbamates, etc), charged linkages (e g phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc), pendent moieties (e g polypeptides),  intercalators (e g acndine, psoralen, etc ), chelators, alkylators and modified linkages (e g (-anomenc nucleic acids, etc)   Also  included  are synthetic molecules  that  mimic<br><br>

polynucleotides in their ability to bind to a designated sequence via hydrogen binding and other chemical interactions Such molecules are known in the art and include, for example, those in which peptide linkages substitute for phosphate linkages in the backbone of the molecule<br>
Antisense polynucleotide sequences, for example, are useful in silencing transcripts of the G-CSF genetic sequence or the G-CSFR genetic sequence Furthermore, polynucleotide vectors containing all or a portion of the G-CSF gene locus may be placed under the control of a promoter in either the sense or antisense orientation and introduced into a cell Expression of such a sense or antisense construct within a cell interferes with target transcription and/or translation Furthermore, co-suppression (1 e using sense-suppresion) and mechanisms to induce RNAi or siRNA may also be employed Alternatively, antisense or sense molecules may be directly administered In this latter embodiment, the antisense or sense molecules may be formulated in a composition and then administered by any number of means to target cells<br>
A variation on antisense and sense molecules involves the use of morphohnos, which are oligonucleotides composed of morpholine nucleotide derivatives and phosphorodiamidate linkages (for example, Summerton and Weller, Antisense and Nucleic Acid Drug Development 7 187-195, 1997) Such compounds are injected into embryos and the effect of interference with mRNA is observed.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention employs compounds such as oligonucleotides and similar species for use in modulating the function or effect of nucleic acid molecules encoding G-CSF or G-CSFR, i e the ohgonucleotides induce transcnptional or post-transcnptional gene silencing This is accomplished by providing oligonucleotides which specifically hybridize with one or more nucleic acid molecules encoding the inhibitor The oligonucleotides may be provided directly to a cell or generated within the cell As used herein, the terms "target nucleic acid" and "nucleic acid molecule encoding G-CSF or G-CSFR" have been used for convenience to encompass the encoding DNA, RNA (including pre-mRNA and mRNA or portions thereof) transcribed from such DNA, and also cDNA<br><br>

denved from such RNA The hybridization of a compound of the subject invention with its target nucleic acid is generally referred to as "antisense" Consequently, the preferred mechanism believed to be included in Ihe practice of some preferred embodiments of the invention is referred to herein as "antisense inhibition" Such antisense inhibition is typically based upon hydrogen bonding-based hybridization of ohgonucleotide strands or segments such that at least one strand or segment is cleaved, degraded, or otherwise rendered inoperable In this regard, it is presently preferred to target specific nucleic acid molecules and their functions for such antisense inhibition<br>
The functions of DNA to be interfered with can include replication and transcription Replication and transcription, for example, can be from an endogenous cellular template, a vector, a plasmid construct or otherwise The functions of RNA to be interfered with can include functions such as translocation of the RNA to a site of protein translation, translocation of the RNA to sites within the cell which are distant from the site of RNA synthesis, translation of protein from the RNA, splicing of the RNA to yield one or more RNA species, and catalytic activity or complex formation involving the RNA which may be engaged in or facilitated by the RNA<br>
In the context of this invention, "hybridization" means the pairing of complementary strands of oligomenc compounds In the present invention, the preferred mechanism of pairing involves hydrogen bonding, which may be Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, between complementary nucleoside or nucleotide bases (nucleobases) of the strands of oligomeric compounds For example, ademne and thymme are complementary nucleobases which pair through the formation of hydrogen bonds hybridization can occur under varying circumstances<br>
An antisense compound is specifically hybndizable when binding of the compound to the target nucleic acid interferes with the normal function of the target nucleic acid to cause a loss of activity, and there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the antisense compound to non-target nucleic acid sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired<br><br>
WO 2004/017727	PCT/AU2003/001078<br>
-23-<br>
uComplementary" as used herein, refers to the capacity for precise pairing between two nucleobases of an ohgomenc compound For example, if a nucleobase at a certain position of an oligonucleotide (an ohgomeric compound), is capable of hydrogen bonding with a nucleobase at a certain position of a target nucleic acid, said target nucleic acid being a DNA, RNA, or oligonucleotide molecule, then the position of hydrogen bonding between the oligonucleotide and the target nucleic acid is considered to be a complementary position The oligonucleotide and the further DNA, RNA, or oligonucleotide molecule are complementary to each other when a sufficient number of complementary positions in each molecule are occupied by nucleobases which can hydrogen bond with each other Thus, "specifically hybndizable" and "complementary" are terms which are used to indicate a sufficient degree of precise pairing or complementarity over a sufficient number of nucleobases such that stable and specific binding occurs between the oligonucleotide and a target nucleic acid<br>
According to the present invention, compounds include antisense ohgomeric compounds, antisense ohgonucleotides, nbozymes, external guide sequence (EGS) ohgonucleotides, alternate splicers, primers, probes, and other oligomeric compounds which hybridize to at least a portion of the target nucleic acid As such, these compounds may be introduced in the form of single-stranded, double-stranded, circular or hairpin ohgomenc compounds and may contain structural elements such as internal or terminal bulges or loops. Once introduced to a system, the compounds of the invention may elicit the action of one or more enzymes or structural proteins to effect modification of the target nucleic acid One non-limiting example of such an enzyme is RNAse H, a cellular endonuclease which cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA DNA duplex It is known in the art that single-stranded antisense compounds which are "DNA-hke" elicit RNAse H  Activation of RNase H, therefore, results in cleavage of the RNA target, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of ohgonucleotide-mediated  inhibition of gene expression   Similar roles have been postulated for other ribonucleases such as those in the RNase III and nbonuclease L family of enzymes<br><br>

While the preferred form of antisense compound is a single-stranded antisense oligonucleotide, in many species the introduction of double-stranded structures, such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules, has been shown to induce potent and specific antisense-mediated reduction of the function of a gene or its associated gene products<br>
In the context of the subject invention, the term "oligomeric compound" refers to a polymer or oligomer comprising a plurality of monomenc units In the context of this invention, the term "ohgonucleotide" refers to an oligomer or polymer of ribonucleic acid (RNA) or deoxynbonucleic acid (DNA) or mimehcs, chimeras, analogs and homologs thereof This term includes oligonucleotides composed of naturally occurring nucleobases, sugars and covalent internucleoside (backbone) linkages as well as oligonucleotides having non-naturally occurring portions which function similarly Such modified or substituted oligonucleotides are often preferred over native forms because of desirable properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake, enhanced affinity for a target nucleic acid and increased stability m the presence of nucleases<br>
While oligonucleotides are a preferred form of the compounds of this invention, the present invention comprehends other families of compounds as well, including but not limited to ohgonucleotide analogs and mimetics such as those herein described<br>
The open reading frame (ORF) or "coding region" which is known in the art to refer to the region between the translation initiation codon and the translation termination codon, is a region which may be effectively targeted Within the context of the present invention, one region is the intragenic region encompassing the translation initiation or termination codon of the open reading frame (ORF) of a gene<br>
Other target regions include the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR), known in the art to refer to the portion of an mRNA in the 5' direction from the translation initiation codon, and thus including nucleotides between the 5' cap site and the translation initiation codon of an mRNA (or corresponding nucleotides on the gene), and the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR), known in the art to refer to the portion of an mRNA in the 3' direction from the<br><br>

Other target regions include the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR), known in the art to refer to the portion of an mRNA in the 5' direction from the translation initiation codon, and thus including nucleotides between the 5' cap site and the translation initiation codon of an mRNA (or corresponding nucleotides on the gene), and the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) known in the art to refer to the portion of an mRNA in the 3' direction from the<br><br>

translation termination codon, and thus including nucleotides between the translation termination codon and 3' end of an mRNA (or corresponding nucleotides on the gene) The 5' cap site of an mRNA comprises an N7-methylated guanosine residue joined to the 5'-most residue of the mRNA via a 5'-5' tnphosphate linkage The 5' cap region of an mRNA is considered to include the 5' cap structure itself as well as the first 50 nucleotides adjacent to the cap site It is also preferred to target the 5' cap region<br>
Although some eukaryotic mRNA transcripts are directly translated, many contain one or more regions, known as "introns", which are excised from a transcript before it is translated The remaining (and, therefore, translated) regions are known as "exons" and are spliced together to form a continuous mRNA sequence Targeting splice sites, i e intron-exon junctions or exon-intron junctions, may also be particularly useful in situations where aberrant splicing is implicated in disease, or where an overproduction of a particular splice product is implicated in disease Aberrant fusion junctions due to rearrangements or deletions are also preferred target sites mRNA transcripts produced via the process of splicing of two (or more) mRNAs from different gene sources are known as "fusion transcripts" It is also known that introns can be effectively targeted using antiscnsc compounds targeted to, for example, DNA or pre-rnRNA<br>
As is known in the art, a nucleoside is a base-sugar combination The base portion of the nucleoside is normally a heterocyclic base The two most common classes of such heterocyclic bases are the purines and the pynmidines Nucleotides are nucleosides that further include a phosphate group covalently linked to the sugar portion of the nucleoside For those nucleosides that include a pentofuranosyl sugar, the phosphate group can be linked to either the 2' 3' or 5' hydroxyl moiety of the sugar In forming ohgonucleotides, the phosphate groups covalently link adjacent nucleosides to one another to form a linear polymeric compound In turn, the respective ends of this linear polymeric compound can be further joined to form a circular compound, however, linear compounds are generally preferred In addition, linear compounds may have internal nucleobase complementarity and may, therefore, fold in a manner as to produce a fully or partially double-stranded compound  Within ohgonucleotides, the phosphate groups are commonly referred to as<br><br>

forming the internucleoside backbone of the oligonucleotide The normal linkage or backbone of RNA and DNA is a 3' to 5' phosphodiester linkage<br>
For topical delivery of antisense compounds, these oligonucleotides may contain modified backbones or non-natural internucleoside linkages As defined in this specification, oligonucleotides having modified backbones include those that retain a phosphorus atom in the backbone and those that do not have a phosphorus atom in the backbone For the purposes of this specification, and as sometimes referenced in the art, modified oligonucleotides that do not have a phosphorus atom in their internucleoside backbone can also be considered to be oligonucleosides<br>
Preferred modified ohgonucleotide backbones containing a phosphorus atom therein include, for example, phosphorothioates, chiral phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, phosphotriesters,   aminoalkylphosphotnesters,   methyl   and   other   alkyl   phosphonates including 3'-alkylene phosphonates, 5'-alkylene phosphonates and chiral phosphonates, phosphinates,      phosphor ami dates      including      3'-amino      phosphoramidate      and aminoalkylphosphoramidates,        thionophosphoramidates,        thionoalkylphosphonates, thionoalkylphosphotriesters, selenophosphates and boranophosphates having normal 3'-5' linkages, 2'-5' linked analogs of these, and those having inverted polarity wherein one or more internucleotide linkages is a 3' to 3', 5' to 5' or 2' to 2' linkage   Preferred oligonucleotides having inverted polarity comprise a single 3' to 3' linkage at the 3'-most internucleotide linkage i e  a single inverted nucleoside residue which may be abasic (the nucleobase is missing or has a hydroxyl group in place thereof) Various salts, mixed salts and free acid forms are also included<br>
In an alternative embodiment, genetic constructs including DNA "vaccines" are used to generate antisense or sense molecules mammalian cells Furthermore, many of the preferred features described above are appropriate for sense nucleic acid molecules<br>

Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or diluents include any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutical active substances is well known in the art and except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the modulator, their use in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions<br>
As indicated above, administration may be by any means For the treatment of arthritis or local inflammations, intra-articular or subcutaneous administration is particularly preferred<br>
The composition may also comprise genetic molecules such as a vector capable of transfecting target cells where the vector carries a nucleic acid molecule capable of encoding a modulator, when the modulator is a proteinaceous molecule The vector may, for example, be a viral vector In this regard, a range of gene therapies are contemplated by the present invention including isolating certain cells, genetically manipulating and returning the cell to the same subject or to a genetically related or similar subject<br>
The present invention further provides an animal model for inflammation useful for screening for agents capable of inhibiting G-CSF or G-CSFR and thereby amelonate the effects of inflammation. Animal models are contemplated which produce high or low levels of G-CSF or G-CSFR Such animals are useful for screening for agents which ameliorate the symptoms of inflammation or which prevents its occurrence Furthermore, in animals with reduced levels of G-CSF, other cytokines or endogenous molecules may emerge to compensate G-CSF's absence These then become targes for further therapeutic molecules<br>
Accordingly, another aspect of the present invention provides a genetically modified animal wherein said animal produces low amounts of G-CSF or G-CSFR relative to a non-genetically modified animal of the same species<br><br>
WO 2004/017727	PCT/AU2003/001078<br>
-30-<br>
Preferably, the genetically modified animal is a mouse, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, pig, sheep or goat More preferably, the genetically modified animal is a mouse or rat Most preferably, the genetically modified animal is a mouse<br>
Accordingly, a preferred aspect of the present invention provides a genetically modified mouse wherein said mouse produces low amounts of G-CSF or G-CSFR relative to a non-genetically modified mouse of the same strain<br>
The animal models of the present invention may be in the form of the animals or may be, for example, in the form of embryos for transplantation The embryos are preferably maintained in a frozen state and may optionally be sold with instructions for use<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention provides a targeting vector useful for inactivating a gene encoding G-CSF or G-CSFR, said targeting vector comprising two segments of genetic material encoding said G-CSF or G-CSFR flanking a positive selectable marker wherein when said targeting vector is transfected into embryonic stem (ES) cells and the marker selected, an ES cell is generated in which the gene encoding said G-CSF or G-CSFR is inactivated by homologous recombination<br>
Preferably, the ES cells are from mice, rats, guinea pigs, pigs, sheep or goats Most preferably, the ES cells are from mice<br>
Still yet another aspect of the present invention is directed to the use of a targeting vector as defined above in the manufacture of a genetically modified animal substantially incapable of producing G-CSF or G-CSFR<br>

WO 2004/017727	PCT/AU2003/001078<br>

Preferably, the vector is DNA A selectable marker in the targeting vector allows for selection of targeted cells that have stably incorporated the targeting DNA This is especially useful when employing relatively low efficiency transformation techniques such as electroporation, calcium phosphate precipitation and hposome fusion where typically fewer than 1 in 1000 cells will have stably incorporated the exogenous DNA Using high efficiency methods, such as microinjection into nuclei, typically from 5-25% of the cells will have incorporated the targeting DNA, and it is, therefore, feasible to screen the targeted cells directly without the necessity of first selecting for stable integration of a selectable marker Either isogenic or non-isogemc DNA may be employed<br>
Examples of selectable markers include genes conferring resistance to compounds such as antibiotics, genes conferring the ability to grow on selected substrates, genes encoding proteins that produce detectable signals such as luminescence A wide variety of such markers are known and available, including, for example, antibiotic resistance genes such as the neomycin resistance gene (neo) and the hygromycin resistance gene (hyg) Selectable markers also include genes conferring the ability to grow on certain media substrates such as the tk gene (thymidine kinase) or the hprt gene (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase) which confer the ability to grow on HAT medium (hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine), and the bacterial gpt gene (guanme/xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase) which allows growth on MAX medium (mycophenolic acid, adenme and xanthine) Other selectable markers for use in mammalian cells and plasmids carrying a variety of selectable markers are described in Sambrook et al, Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbour, New York, USA, 1990<br>
The preferred location of the marker gene in the targeting construct will depend on the aim of the gene targeting For example, if the aim is to disrupt target gene expression, then the selectable marker can be cloned into targeting DNA corresponding to coding sequence in the target DNA Alternatively, if the aim is to express an altered product from the target gene, such as a protein with an amino acid substitution, then the coding sequence can be modified to code for the substitution, and the selectable marker can be placed outside of the coding region, for example, in a nearby intron<br><br>
WO 2004/017727	PCT/AU2O03/0O1078<br>
-32-<br>
The selectable marker may depend on its own promoter for expression and the marker gene may be derived from a very different organism than the organism being targeted (e g prokaryotic marker genes used in targeting mammalian cells) However, it is preferable to replace the original promoter with transcnptional machinery known to function in the recipient cells A large number of transcnptional initiation regions are available for such purposes including, for example, metallothionein promoters, thymidine kinase promoters, (-actm promoters, immunoglobulin promoters, SV40 promoters and human cytomegalovirus promoters A widely used example is the pSV2-neo plasmid which has the bacterial neomycm phosphotransferase gene under control of the SV40 early promoter and confers in mammalian cells resistance to G418 (an antibiotic related to neomycm) A number of other variations may be employed to enhance expression of the selectable markers in animal cells, such as the addition of a poly(A) sequence and the addition of synthetic translation initiation sequences Both constitutive and inducible promoters may be used<br>
The DNA is preferably modified by homologous recombination The target DNA can be in any organelle of the animal cell including the nucleus and mitochondria and can be an intact gene, an exon or intron, a regulatory sequence or any region between genes<br>
Homologous DNA is a DNA sequence that is at least 70% identical with a reference DNA ^sequence  An indication that two sequences are homologous is that they will hybridize with each other under stringent conditions (Sambrook el al, 1990, supra)<br>
The present invention further contemplates co-suppression (l e sense suppression) and antisense suppression to down-regulate expression of G-CSF or G-CSFR This would generally occur in a target test animal such as to generate a disease model<br><br>

EXAMPLE 10<br>
Joint inflammation develops in response to direct intra-articular administration of G-CSF<br>
It was first investigated whether granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) has pro-inflammatory properties in joints by intra-articular injection of rHuG-CSF (0 1, 0 5, &amp; 1 fag) into the knee joint of wild type (WT) C57BL/6 mice over three consecutive days Controls included intra-articular injection of IL-1 (IL-1, 25ng) and vehicle (0 5% [v/v] normal mouse serum in normal saline)   On day 3 joints were taken for histological assessment It was found that G-CSF induced inflammation in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1), although the response was significantly less than that induced with IL-1  This result shows that exogenous G-CSF has pro-inflammatory effects within the normal joint<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>

joint compartment Despite this reduction in inflammatory features in G-CSF-/- mice, there was no difference in articular cartilage proteoglycan loss (Figure 2B), suggesting that IL-I can directly damage cartilage<br>
Peripheral blood, BM and synovial infiltrate analysis<br>
To examine the effects of G-CSF deficiency on the inflammatory response induced by mBSA and 1L-1, peripheral blood, BM and synovium were taken from B6 and G-CSF-/-mice treated 1 a with mBSA and s c with either IL-1 or saline vehicle, at days 0, 3 and 7 of this model Results are shown in Table 2 and 3, and in Figure 6 G-CSF deficiency resulted in a blunted neutrophihc response to mBSA/IL-1 BM cellularity in both B6 and G-CSF-/- mice was reduced by IL-1 administration (Table 2), reflecting the mobilisation of BM cells into the blood When compared with B6 mice, G-CSF-/- mice had significantly reduced numbers of metamyelocytes and polymorphs, as well as fewer promyelocytes and myelocytes in the BM compartment (Table 2) both basally and in response to IL-1 B6 mice developed a marked peripheral neutrophiha during the course of acute arthritis In sharp contrast, G-CSF-/- mice exhibited a significant neutropema over the course of the model (Table 3), indicating that the neutrophiha induced by IL-1 is G-CSF dependent<br>
Investigation of the cellular composition of the inflamed synovium of mBSA/IL-1 -treated G-CSF-/- mice also revealed a reduction in infiltrating leukocytes at day 3 and 7 (Figure 6A-C) Cell counts of synovial tissue digests revealed approximately 2-fold reduction in total cellularity at day 7 in mBSA/IL-1-treated G-CSF-/- joint synovial tissue, compared to mBSA/IL-1-treated synovial tissue from B6 mice (1 87 ± 0.07 x 10s cells/ B6 mBSA/sahne joint versus 3 13 ± 0 10 x 105 cells/ B6 mBSA/IL-1 joint versus 1 66 ± 0 05 x 105 cells/ G-CSF-/- mBSA/IL-1 joint) In particular, there were significant reductions in the percentages and numbers of neutrophils (GRl hi CD1 lbhi) at both time points, as well as reductions in the percentage and number of infiltrating macrophage/monocytes (GRllo CD11 bhi)    Other   phenotypic   changes   included   lower   percentages   of  M-CSFR<br><br>

CD16/CD32+ and CD44+ cells m the synovial tissues of G-CSF-/- mice with acute arthritis, suggesting that G-CSF may be required for the full induction of these activation markers on synovial cells<br>
Staining of non-adherent leukocytes after overnight culture also revealed a reduction in CD4+ lymphocyte infiltration at day 7, suggesting that G-CSF ts required for trafficking of not only neutrophils and macrophages into the joint but also of CD4+ T lymphocytes (Figure 6C)<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
Depletion of neutrophils in G-CSF and WT mice in acute inflammatory arthritis<br>
To investigate whether the reduction in mBSA/lL-1 -induced arthritis in G-CSF"'" mice was simply a result of neutropema (Lieschke et al, 1994, supra), neutrophils were depleted using the monoclonal antibody (mAb), RB6 8C5 WT and G-CSF-/' mice were injected intra-pentoneally (I p) with anti-neutrophil mAb (RB6 8C5) or isotype control mAb (GL121) Peripheral blood was analyzed for neutrophil levels on days 0, 2 and 7 by differential cell count analysis (Figure 7A) In WT animals treated with anti-neutrophil mAb, &gt;90% depletion was observed at all times compared to isotype control mAb treated animals (which developed a marked neutrophiha) Neutrophil depletion of WT mice did not abrogate development of arthritis (Figure 7B), although it did significantly decrease the joint space exudate In contrast, G-CSF'-/-mice were relatively resistant to disease and additional neutrophil depletion did not further reduce disease seventy This indicates that the reduction in neutrophils in the G-CSF'" mice is not solely responsible for protection from mBSA/IL-1 -induced arthritis<br>
EXAMPLE 13<br>
 Exogenous G-CSF can partly substitute for IL-1 in acute inflammatory arthritis<br>
Joints of mice treated with mBSA and G-CSF (mBSA/G-CSF) developed inflammatory and destructive arthritis, although this was less severe than mBSA/IL-1-treated animals<br><br>

-42-<br>
(Figure 4A-B) The major cells infiltrating joints of the rnBSA/G-CSF-treated animals were monocyte/macrophages, compared to the predominantly granulocytic infiltrate in mBSA/IL-1 -induced arthritis These results show that systemic administration of exogenous G-CSF can at least partially substitute for systemic IL-1 in driving this model of acute arthritis and that G-CSF leads to the recruitment of monocyte/macrophages into the joint<br>
EXAMPLE 14 <br>
G-CSF deficiency impairs collagen-induced arthritis (CIA)<br>
G-CSF-deficient mice have reduced acute inflammatory arthritis<br>
In view of the pro-inflammatory effects of I a injection and systemic filgrashm on joint disease, we attempted to determine the absolute dependence of the acute arthritis model on G-CSF, using G-CSF-/- mice G-CSF-/- and B6 mice were injected i a with mBSA (day 0) and se in the footpad with IL-1 on days 0, 1 and 2 Histological assessment of disease at day 7 revealed a significant reduction in inflammatory and destructive features (Figure 5A &amp; B) Saframn O staining for cartilage proteoglycan content revealed a major reduction in cartilage proteoglycan loss in G-CSF-/- mice compared to B6 mice (Figure 5C) Therefore, endogenous G-CSF is an important mediator of inflammation and destruction in this model of acute arthritis<br>
G-CSF deficiency reduces the incidence and seventy of CIA<br>
CIA is a chronic autoimmune arthritis that is widely used to study RA To examine the contribution of G-CSF to CIA, B6 WT and G-CSF-/- mice were immunised with CII in CFA, followed by a boost injection 21 days later (Lieschke et al, Blood 84 1737-46, 1994), and disease incidence and severity compared The onset of CIA in G-CSF-/- mice was delayed and mice developed disease at a markedly reduced incidence and seventy compared to WT mice (Figure 8A &amp; B) The reduction of disease incidence and severity in<br><br>

G-CSF-/' mice suggests a pivotal role for endogenous G-CSF in chronic autoimmune arthritis<br>
EXAMPLE 15<br>
 Histological analysis of CIA in G-CSF-/- mice<br>
Histological assessment of H&amp;E stained sections of paws from four B6 and G-CSF-/- mice with the highest clinical scores during CIA was performed Individual joints were scored from 0 normal to 3 (see EXAMPLE 18) and the percentage of normal and arthritic joints determined There was a significantly greater percentage of normal joints in G-CSF-/- mice compared to WT mice (Figure 9 A), and of the small number of affected paws in the G-CSF-/- mice, none was severe (Figure 9B) In contrast, joints from WT mice had a range of histological features indicative of mild to severe arthritis (Figure 9A &amp; B) These histological observations are concordant with the clinical assessment outlined herein<br>
EXAMPLE 16<br>
In vitro T cell proliferation &amp; cytokine production to CII<br>
To assess the cellular immune response to CII, in vitro T cell proliferative responses and T cell cytokine (IFNy and IL-2) production were measured in G-CSF-/- mice and compared to WT Single cell suspensions were prepared from inguinal LN from mice immunised with CII in CFA and stimulated for 72h in vitro with 0-100 u.g/ml of denatured CII T cell responses were measured by tntiated TdR uptake in the last 8 h of culture Figure 10A depicts the stimulation indices observed in G-CSF-/- and WT mice, which were comparable Production of T cell cytokines IFN- ? and IL-2 by G-CSF-/- LN cells appeared relatively normal (Figure 10B)<br>
EXAMPLE 17 <br>
	Impaired anti-CII isotype switching from IgM to IgG in G-CSF-/- mice<br>
Induction of CIA is dependent on both humoral and cellular immune responses to CII (Campbell et al, 2000, supra) It was examined whether G-CSF deficiency altered serum<br><br>
WO 2004/017727	PCT/AU2003/U01078<br>
-44-<br>
levels of anti-CII Ab production during CIA (day 30 and 62) Despite comparable levels of anti-CII IgM in WT and G-CSF-/- mice at days 30 and 62, there was a reduction in the level of total anti-CII IgG (Figure 11) Analysis of anti-CII IgG isotypes revealed reduced production of all isotypes - IgG2b, IgG2c, IgG3 and IgGl This suggests that there is a defect in isotype switching in G-CSF-/- mice that may contribute to protection against CIA This observation suggests that endogenous G-CSF plays a role in Ab production by B cells, at least in response to immunisation with antigen in CFA<br>
EXAMPLE 18<br>
Increased basal levels of lg in naive G-CSF-/- mice and increased total IgG in CII/CFA-<br>
immunised mice<br>
Investigation of the humoral immune response to CII revealed that G-CSF-/- mice have defective switching from an IgM to IgG response To determine whether this defect reflected pre-existing defects in circulating Ab, sera from naive mice were analysed for total IgG, IgM and IgG isotypes Analysis of serum Ab levels revealed significantly greater production of total IgG and isotypes IgG2b and IgG2c in naive G-CSF-/- mice compared to naive B6 mice and normal baseline production of IgM, IgGl, IgG3 and IgA (Figure 12A) Furthermore, in CII/CFA-immunised G-CSF-/- mice, levels of non-specific total IgG were markedly enhanced (Figure 12B) These observations suggest G-CSF plays a role in B cell maturation, antibody production and isotype switching, at least in response to immunisation with antigen in CFA<br>
EXAMPLE 19 <br>
Normal T-dependent and T-independent Ag B cell responses in G-CSF-/- mice<br>
To determine whether the impairment of Ab production in response to CII/CFA was due to a defect in T-dependent or T-independent Ag responses, B6 and G-CSF-/- mice were challenged with the T-dependent antigen NP-KLH in alum, or with the T-independent antigen, DNP-Dextran in PBS  G-CSF-/- mice developed a normal response to both T-<br><br>

dependent and T-independent Ag (Figure 13), demonstrating that the impaired B cell response in CIA is specific to challenge with C1I in CFA<br>
EXAMPLE 20<br>
G-CSF depletion causes a peripheral blood neutropenia and reduces inflammation in<br>
acute (mBSA/Il~l) arthritis<br>
To assess the therapeutic application of G-CSF blockade in WT mice, B6 mice were injected prior to the induction of acute arthritis (day 0) with 50 or 250 (g of rat anti-G-CSF mAb (clone 67604, R&amp;D systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) or isotype control (GL113) mAb mAb was also administered on days 1, 2, 3 and 5  Peripheral blood was taken at days 4 and 7 and subjected to differential analysis (Figure 14A) Mice receiving the high dose (250 ug) anti-G-CSF mAb had a significant reduction in peripheral blood neutrophils compared to isotype control mAb mBSA/lL-1 -treated mice on both days Mice receiving the lower dose of anti-G-CSF mAb had a significant reduction in neutrophils at day 7 only Analysis of BM populations also showed a significant reduction in myeloid lineage cells in G-CSF-depleted mBSA/lL-1-treated mice (data not shown) Macroscopic assessment of arthritic joints of mice treated with anti-G-CSF or isotype control mAb revealed a reduction in disease in anti-G-CSF mAb (250 (g) treated mice (Figure 14B) There was reduced synovial tissue cellulanty (Figure 14C), and a reduced percentage of infiltrating leukocytes, especially neutrophils (GRl/hi CD11bhi,  Figure 14D), in mice receiving the higher dose of anti-G-CSF mAb   These results show a dose-dependent reduction in disease features of acute arthritis in response to G-CSF inhibition in wild type mice<br><br>
