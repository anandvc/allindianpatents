				<td>TUNABLE ANTENNAS FOR HANDHELD DEVICES<br>
This application claims priority to United<br>
States patent application No. 11/516,433, filed september<br>
5, 2006.<br>
Background<br>
This invention can relate to antennas, and more<br>
particularly, to compact tunable antennas used in<br>
wireless handheld electronic devices.<br>
Wireless handheld devices, such as cellular<br>
telephones, contain antennas. As integrated circuit<br>
technology advances, handheld devices are shrinking in<br>
size. Small antennas are therefore needed.<br>
A typical antenna for a handheld device is<br>
formed from a metal radiating element. The radiating<br>
element may be fabricated by patterning a metal layer on<br>
a circuit board substrate or may be formed from a sheet<br>
of thin metal using a foil stamping process. These<br>
techniques can be used to produce antennas that fit<br>
within the tight confines of a compact handheld device.<br>
Modern handheld electronic devices often need<br>
to function over a number of different communications<br>
bands. For example, quad-band cellular telephones that<br>
use the popular global system for mobile (GSM)<br><br>
communications standard need to operate at four different<br>
frequencies (850 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, and 1900 MHz).<br>
Although multi-band operation is desirable, it<br>
is difficult to design a compact antenna that functions<br>
satisfactorily over a wide frequency range. This is<br>
because small antennas tend to operate over narrow<br>
frequency ranges due to the small dimensions of their<br>
radiating elements.<br>
Antennas with tunable capacitive loading have<br>
been developed in an attempt to address the need for<br>
compact multi-band antennas. By varying the amount of<br>
capacitive loading that is applied to the radiating<br>
element, the resonant frequency of the antenna can be<br>
adjusted. This allows an antenna with a relatively<br>
narrow frequency range to be tuned sufficiently to cover<br>
more than one band.<br>
The adjustable capacitive loading that is<br>
placed on this type of antenna leads to unwanted power<br>
loss. As a result, capacitively-tuned antennas tend to<br>
exhibit less-than-optimal efficiencies.<br>
It would be desirable to be able to provide<br>
ways in which to improve the performance of tunable<br>
antennas for handheld electronic devices.<br>
Summary<br>
In accordance with the present invention,<br>
tunable multiport antennas are provided. Handheld<br>
devices that use the tunable multiport antennas and<br>
methods for calibrating and using the tunable multiport<br>
antennas are also provided.<br>
A tunable multiport antenna can have a ground<br>
terminal and multiple feed terminals. Each feed terminal<br><br>
can be used with the ground terminal to form a separate<br>
antenna port. By selecting which antenna port is active<br>
at a given time, the antenna's operating frequencies can<br>
be tuned.<br>
Tunable multiport antennas contain radiating<br>
elements. The radiating elements may be formed, for<br>
example, by a foil stamping process or by patterning a<br>
conductive layer on a substrate such as a printed circuit<br>
board or flex circuit. Each radiating element can<br>
resonate at a fundamental frequency range. The<br>
dimensions of the radiating element may be chosen to<br>
align the antenna*s fundamental operating frequency range<br>
with at least one communications band. If desired, the<br>
radiating element may also be used at one or more<br>
harmonic frequency ranges.<br>
The radiating element can be coupled to a<br>
printed circuit board on which electronic components for<br>
a handheld electronic device are mounted. The printed<br>
circuit board can contain conductive traces that connect<br>
the components to the ground and feed terminals of the<br>
antenna. Electrical connecting structures, such as<br>
springs and spring-loaded pins, can be used to<br>
electrically connect the conductive traces on the printed<br>
circuit board to the ground and feeds of the radiating<br>
element.<br>
Handheld electronic devices can contain radio-<br>
frequency transceivers and switching circuitry. The<br>
radio-frequency transceivers can have input-output paths<br>
that are used to transmit and receive signals associated<br>
with different communications bands. The switching<br>
circuitry can selectively connects the input-output paths<br>
to the ports of the antenna. During operation of a<br><br>
handheld electronic device, control circuitry on the<br>
device can direct the switching circuitry to activate a<br>
desired one of the antenna ports. By selecting which<br>
antenna port is active, the control circuitry can tune<br>
the antenna so that one or more of the antenna's<br>
operating frequency ranges aligns with one or more<br>
desired communications bands.<br>
Because the antenna can be tuned, it is not<br>
necessary to enlarge the dimensions of the radiating<br>
element to broaden the bandwidth of the radiating<br>
element's resonant frequencies. This allows the antenna<br>
to be implemented with a small footprint. The use of<br>
multiple feeds in the radiating element permits tuning<br>
without the use of adjustable capacitive loading, which<br>
reduces reactive antenna losses and enhances antenna<br>
efficiency.<br>
Further features of the invention, its nature<br>
and various advantages will be more apparent from the<br>

Detailed Description<br>
The present invention can relate to tunable<br>
antennas for portable electronic devices, such as<br>
handheld electronic devices. The invention can also<br>
relate to portable devices that contain tunable antennas<br>
and to methods for testing and using such devices and<br>
antennas.<br>
A tunable antenna in accordance with the<br>
invention can have a radiating element with multiple<br>
antenna feeds and a ground. The radiating element may be<br>
formed using any suitable antenna structure such as a<br>
patch antenna structure, a planar inverted-F antenna<br>
structure, a helical antenna structure, etc.<br>
The portable electronic devices may be small<br>
portable computers such as those sometimes referred to as<br><br>
ultraportables. With one particularly suitable<br>
arrangement, the portable electronic devices are handheld<br>
electronic devices. The use of handheld devices is<br>
generally described herein as an example.<br>
The handheld devices may be, for example,<br>
cellular telephones, media players with wireless<br>
communications capabilities, handheld computers (also<br>
sometimes called personal digital assistants), remote<br>
controllers, and handheld gaming devices. The handheld<br>
devices of the invention may also be hybrid devices that<br>
combine the functionality of multiple conventional<br>
devices. Examples of hybrid handheld devices include a<br>
cellular telephone that includes media player<br>
functionality, a gaming device that includes a wireless<br>
communications capability, a cellular telephone that<br>
includes games and email functions, and a handheld device<br>
that receives email, supports mobile telephone calls, and<br>
supports web browsing. These are merely illustrative<br>
examples. Any suitable device may include a tunable<br>
multi-feed antenna, if desired.<br>
Illustrative antenna and control circuitry 10<br>
that may be used in a handheld device in accordance with<br>
the invention is shown in FIG. 1. Circuitry 10 can<br>
include control circuitry 28. Control circuitry 28 may<br>
include one or more integrated circuits such as<br>
microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal<br>
processors, field programmable gate arrays, power<br>
amplifiers, and application-specific integrated circuits.<br>
Control circuitry 28 may also include passive RF<br>
components such as duplexers, diplexers, and filters.<br>
Control circuitry 28 may be mounted to one or<br>
more printed circuit boards 30 or other suitable mounting<br><br>
structures. Circuit board 30 may be, for example, a<br>
dual-sided circuit board containing patterned conductive<br>
traces.<br>
Control circuitry 28 can send and receive RF<br>
signals. The RF signals may be provided to an antenna<br>
module. The antenna module can contain a radiating<br>
element 12. Radiating element 12 may be formed from a<br>
highly-conductive material, such as copper, gold, alloys<br>
containing copper and other metals, high-conductivity<br>
non-metallic conductors (e.g., high-conductivity organic-<br>
based materials, high-conductivity superconductors,<br>
highly-conductive liquids), etc. in the example of FIG.<br>
1, the radiating element 12 can have a thin planar<br>
profile, which facilitates placement of the radiating<br>
element 12 within a handheld device. The use of a<br>
radiating element with a planar structure is, however,<br>
merely illustrative. The radiating element 12 may be<br>
formed in any suitable shape.<br>
In the FIG. 1 example, slot 14 can be formed in<br>
radiating element 12, which increases the effective<br>
length of the radiating element 12, while maintaining a<br>
compact footprint. Radiating element 12 may be formed<br>
using any suitable manufacturing technique. With one<br>
suitable arrangement, the so-called foil stamping method<br>
can be used to form radiating element 12. with foil<br>
stamping techniques, a foil stamping machine is used to<br>
generate numerous radiating elements from a thin copper<br>
foil. Another suitable technique for forming radiating<br>
element can involve printing or etching the antenna<br>
pattern onto a fixed or flexible substrate. Flexible<br>
substrates that may be used during these patterning<br>
processes include so-called flex circuits (e.g., circuits<br><br>
formed from metals such as copper that are layered on top<br>
of flexible substrates such as polyimide). if desired,<br>
other techniques may be used to form radiating elements<br>
12.<br>
The radiating element 12 can have a ground<br>
signal terminal and two or more corresponding positive<br>
signal terminals. The positive signal terminals can be<br>
called antenna feeds. In the example of FIG. l,<br>
radiating element 12 can have three elongated portions<br>
16, 18, and 20. Elongated portion 16 may serve as<br>
ground. Elongated portion 18 may serve as a first feed.<br>
Elongated portion 20 may serve as a second feed. In<br>
general, there may be any suitable number of feeds in the<br>
antenna (e.g., two feeds, three feeds, four feeds, more<br>
than four feeds, etc.).<br>
Control circuitry 28 may include input-output<br>
terminals, such as ground input-output terminal 32 and<br>
positive input-output terminals 34 and 36. Conductive<br>
paths such as paths 22, 24, and 26 may be used to<br>
electrically connect the input-output terminals of<br>
control circuitry 28 to radiating element 12. Paths 22,<br>
24, and 26 may be patterned conductive traces (e.g.,<br>
metal traces) formed on printed circuit board 30. Paths<br>
24 and 26 may be used to electrically connect positive<br>
input-output terminals 34 and 36 to elongated portions 18<br>
and 20, respectively. A path such as path 2 2 may be used<br>
to connect the ground input-output terminal 32 to the<br>
ground portion 16 of radiating element 12. If desired,<br>
the upper and lower portions of printed circuit board 30<br>
may also be connected to ground. The elongated portions<br>
16, 18, and 20 may be soldered or otherwise electrically<br>
connected to paths 22, 24, and 26.<br><br>
In the example of FIG. l, the elongated<br>
portions 16, 18, and 20 are shown as being formed as an<br>
integral portion of radiating element 12 and paths 22,<br>
24. and 26 are shown as being formed from circuit board<br>
traces. This is merely one suitable arrangement for<br>
connecting the ground and feeds of the radiating element<br>
12 to the circuitry of the handheld device. Other<br>
suitable arrangement include contact arrangements based<br>
on external spring-loaded pins and spring connectors.<br>
Regardless of the particular type of arrangement that is<br>
used to convey signals into and out of the radiating<br>
element, the radiating element structure that is<br>
associated with ground is commonly referred to as the<br>
antenna's and radiating element's ground pin, ground<br>
terminal, or ground and the radiating element, structure<br>
that is associated with positive antenna signals is<br>
commonly referred to as the antenna's and radiating<br>
element's feed pin, feed terminal, or feed.<br>
The antenna formed from radiating element 14<br>
has a resonant frequency f0 at which it can transmit and<br>
receive signals. The operating frequency range<br>
surrounding f0 is sometimes referred to as the fundamental<br>
band or fundamental operating frequency range of the<br>
antenna. If, as an example, fo is at 850 MHz, the<br>
antenna's fundamental frequency range can be used to<br>
cover a 850 MHz communications band. Antennas also<br>
generally resonate at higher frequencies that are<br>
harmonics of f0. With this type of arrangement, an<br>
antenna can cover two or more bands. For example, an<br>
antenna may be designed to cover both the 850 MHz band<br>
(using the antenna's fundamental frequency range centered<br>
on fo) and the 1800 MHz band (using a harmonic frequency<br><br>
range).<br>
The bandwidth associated with an antenna's<br>
operating frequency is influenced by the geometry of the<br>
radiating element 12. Antennas that are compact tend to<br>
have narrow bandwidths. Unless the bandwidth of the<br>
antenna is widened (e.g., by increasing its physical<br>
size), the antenna will not be able to cover nearby bands<br>
without tuning.<br>
As an example, consider the GSM cellular<br>
telephone standard, which uses bands at 850 MHz, 900 MHz,<br>
1800 MHz, and 1900 MHz. These bands may have bandwidths<br>
of about 70-80 MHz (for the 850 MHz and 900 MHz bands),<br>
170 MHz (for the 1800 MHz band), and 140 MHz (for the<br>
1900 MHz band). Each band may contain two associated<br>
subbands for transmitting and receiving data. For<br>
example, in the 850 MHz band, a subband that extends from<br>
824 to 84 9 MHz may be used for transmitting data from a<br>
cellular telephone to a base station and a subband that<br>
extends from 869 to 894 MHz may be used for receiving<br>
data from a base station. The 850 MHz and 1900 MHz bands<br>
may be used in countries such as the United States. The<br>
900 MHz and 1800 MHz may be used in countries such as the<br>
European countries.<br>
A compact antenna that is designed to cover the<br>
850 MHz band may have a harmonic that allows it to<br>
simultaneously cover a higher band (e.g., 1900 MHz), but<br>
a compact antenna that has a narrow bandwidth will not be<br>
able to cover both the 850 MHz and 900 MHz bands unless<br>
it is tuned.<br>
In accordance with the present invention,<br>
control circuitry 28 may be used to select between<br>
different feeds to tune the antenna formed from radiating<br><br>
element 12. When, for example, signals are transmitted<br>
or received using ground terminal 32 and input-output<br>
terminal 34, the antenna covers one band. When signals<br>
are transmitted on received using ground terminal 32 and<br>
input-output terminal 36, the antenna covers a different<br>
band.<br>
Each feed (and its associated ground) may serve<br>
as an antenna port. An antenna such as an antenna formed<br>
from radiating element 12 of FIG. 1 therefore can have<br>
multiple ports and can be tuned by proper port selection.<br>
The control circuitry 28 can be used to determine which<br>
port is used. When access to a particular band is<br>
desired, the control circuitry 2 8 ensures that the proper<br>
port is active. By using multiple ports, a compact<br>
antenna with potentially narrow resonances can be tuned<br>
to cover all bands of interest.<br>
A graph containing an illustrative plot of<br>
return loss versus frequency for a tunable multi-port<br>
antenna in accordance with the present invention is shown<br>
in FIG. 2. Return loss is at a minimum at the antenna's<br>
fundamental operating frequency range. No harmonic<br>
frequency ranges are shown in FIG. 2.<br>
When signals are transmitted and received<br>
through a first antenna port (i.e., ground terminal 32,<br>
path 22, and radiating element extension 16 and positive<br>
input-output terminal 34, path 24, and radiating element<br>
extension 18), the antenna covers the frequency range<br>
centered at frequency fa, as shown by the solid line in<br>
FIG. 2 When signals are transmitted and received through<br>
a second antenna port (i.e., ground terminal 32, path 22,<br>
and radiating element extension 16 and positive input-<br>
output terminal 36, path 26, and radiating element<br><br>
extension 20), the antenna covers the frequency range<br>
centered at frequency fb, as shown by the dashed line in<br>
PIG. 2. This allows the control circuitry 28 to tune the<br>
antenna as needed, when it is desired to send or receive<br>
data in the fa range, the control circuitry 28 uses the<br>
first port. When the second port is used, the antenna's<br>
response is tuned to higher frequencies, so that the<br>
antenna covers a range of frequencies centered at fb.<br>
By using intelligent port selection, the<br>
coverage of an antenna can be extended to cover all<br>
frequency bands of interest. Because compact radiating<br>
elements tend to have small sizes, an antenna that is<br>
tuned by selecting a desired antenna port can be made<br>
more compact than would otherwise be possible, while<br>
still ensuring that all desired bands are covered.<br>
Moreover, tuning through the use of port selection can be<br>
more efficient than antenna tuning through adjustable<br>
capacitive loading schemes. Such capacitive loading<br>
schemes introduce reactive losses, which reduce antenna<br>
efficiency. An antenna with multiple feeds need not be<br>
tuned using variable capacitive loading because tuning<br>
can be performed through proper port selection.<br>
A schematic diagram of an illustrative handheld<br>
electronic device 38 containing a tunable multi-port<br>
antenna is shown in FIG. 3. Handheld device 38 may be a<br>
mobile telephone, a mobile telephone with media player<br>
capabilities, a handheld computer, a game player, a<br>
combination of such devices, or any other suitable<br>
portable electronic device.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, handheld device 38 may<br>
include storage 40. Storage 40 may include one or more<br>
different types of storage such as hard disk drive<br><br>
storage, nonvolatile memory (e.g., FLASH or electrically-<br>
programmable -read-only memory), volatile memory (e.g.,<br>
battery-based static or dynamic random-access-memory),<br>
etc.<br>
Processing circuitry 4 2 may be used to control<br>
the operation of device 38. Processing circuitry 42 may<br>
be based on a processor such as a microprocessor and<br>
other suitable integrated circuits.<br>
Input-output devices 44 may allow data to be<br>
supplied to device 38 and may allow data to be provided<br>
from device 38 to external devices. Input-output devices<br>
can include user input-output devices 4 6 such as buttons,<br>
touch screens, joysticks, click wheels, scrolling wheels,<br>
touch pads, key pads, keyboards, microphones, cameras,<br>
etc. A user can control the operation of device 38 by<br>
supplying commands through user input devices 46.<br>
Display and audio devices 48 may include liquid-crystal<br>
display (LCD) screens, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and<br>
other components that present visual information and<br>
status data. Display and audio devices 48 may also<br>
include audio equipment such as speakers and other<br>
devices for creating sound. Display and audio devices 48<br>
may contain audio-video interface equipment such as jacks<br>
for external headphones and monitors.<br>
Wireless communications devices 50 may include<br>
communications circuitry such as RF transceiver circuitry<br>
formed from one or more integrated circuits, power<br>
amplifier circuitry, passive RF components, antennas such<br>
as the multiport antenna of FIG. 1, and other circuitry<br>
for generating RF wireless signals. wireless signals can<br>
also be sent using light (e.g., using infrared<br>
communications).<br><br>
The device 3 8 can communicate with external<br>
devices such as accessories 52 and computing equipment<br>
54, as shown by paths 56. Paths 56 may include wired and<br>
wireless paths. Accessories 52 may include headphones<br>
(e.g., a wireless cellular headset or audio headphones)<br>
and audio-video equipment (e.g., wireless speakers, a<br>
game controller, or other equipment that receives and<br>
plays audio and video content). Computing equipment 54<br>
may be a server from which songs, videos, or other media<br>
are downloaded over a cellular telephone link or other<br>
wireless link. Computing equipment 54 may also be a<br>
local host (e.g., a user's own personal computer), from<br>
which the user obtains a wireless download of music or<br>
other media files.<br>
As described in connection with FIG. 1, the<br>
multiport antenna used in the handheld device can be<br>
formed from any suitable radiating element 12. An<br>
example of a radiating element 12 that is formed from a<br>
rectangular patch antenna structure is shown in FIG. 4.<br>
The antenna structure of FIG. 4 and the other radiating<br>
element structures are preferably about one quarter of a<br>
wavelength in size (e.g., several centimeters for most<br>
cellular telephone wavelengths).<br>
The radiating element 12 of FIG. 4 may have a<br>
ground terminal 16, a first feed 18, a second feed 20,<br>
and potentially more feeds (shown by dotted feed<br>
structure 21). In general, any radiating element 12 may<br>
have more than two feeds, but only the radiating element<br>
12 of FIG. 4 shows the additional feeds to avoid overcomplicating<br>
the drawings.<br>
Different fundamental resonant frequencies are<br>
associated with each of the different antenna ports and<br><br>
are influenced by the geometry of the radiating element<br>
12. As shown in FIG. 4, when feed 18 is used, there is<br>
an inductive path in the antenna between feed 18 and<br>
ground 16. This path is shown schematically by dotted<br>
line 60. When feed 20 is used, there is a different<br>
inductive path in the antenna, shown by dotted line 58.<br>
Inductances L1 and L2 are associated with paths 60 and 58,<br>
respectively. The inductance L2 is generally larger than<br>
the inductance L1, so the port formed using feed 20<br>
resonates at a higher frequency (e.g., frequency fb of<br>
PIG. 2) than the port formed using feed 18 (e.g.,<br>
frequency fa of FIG. 2).<br>
An illustrative radiating element 12 that is<br>
formed from a rectangular patch antenna structure<br>
containing a slot 14 is shown in FIG. 5. Because of the<br>
presence of slot 14, the antenna of FIG. 5 will exhibit<br>
harmonics that are shifted with respect to the harmonics<br>
of the patch antenna structure of FIG. 4. This allows<br>
the antenna designer to place harmonics at desired<br>
communications bands.<br>
If desired, antenna ports may be formed on the<br>
shorter side of a rectangular patch. An illustrative<br>
structure of the type shown in FIG. 1 in which feeds have<br>
been placed on the shorter size of the rectangular patch<br>
is shown in FIG. 6.<br>
Another illustrative radiating element 12 is<br>
shown in FIG. 7. With the arrangement of FIG. 7, the<br>
rectangular patch structure has a cut-away portion 68.<br>
The cut-away portion 68 may be formed to accommodate a<br>
cellular telephone camera, a button, a microphone,<br>
speaker, or other component of the handheld device.<br>
Ports may be formed on the long side of the element 12<br><br>
(e.g., using ground 16 and feeds 18 and 20) or on the<br>
short side of element 12 (e.g., using ground 16 and feeds<br>
18a and 20a) . As shown in FIG. 8, the cut-away portion<br>
68 need not be formed in the center of the radiating<br>
element 12.<br>
FIG. 9 shows how the sides of a radiating<br>
element may be bent downwards. Portions of the radiating<br>
element 12 such as portions 7 0 and 72 may be formed<br>
during a foil stamping process or by using a flex<br>
circuit. Portions 70 and 72 may serve as a fixed source<br>
of capacitive loading. Using bent-down portions in this<br>
type of arrangement tends to decrease the footprint of<br>
the radiating element for a given operating frequency.<br>
If desired, other forms of capacitive loading may be used<br>
with radiating element. Capacitive loading can be used<br>
with the patch antenna structure of PIG. 7 (as shown in<br>
the example of FIG. 9) or with any other suitable<br>
radiating element structure.<br>
If desired, a radiating element 12 may be<br>
formed from a flex circuit or other flexible substrate.<br>
In the example of FIG. 10, radiating element 12 is formed<br>
from a conductive element 62 that is formed in a<br>
serpentine pattern on flex circuit substrate 64. After<br>
the serpentine pattern is formed on substrate 64, the<br>
substrate 64 is curled to form the cylindrical shape of<br>
FIG. 10. The cylindrical antenna of FIG. 10 has a ground<br>
16 and two feeds 18 and 20.<br>
In the illustrative arrangement of FIG. 11,<br>
radiating element 12 is formed from a patch antenna<br>
having a serpentine slot 14. in general, one or more<br>
slots of any suitable shape may be formed in the<br>
radiating element 12.<br><br>
FIG. 12 shows an illustrative arrangement for a<br>
radiating element 12 that is based on an L-shaped planar<br>
antenna arrangement. The radiating element 12 of FIG. 12<br>
has a ground 16 and feeds 18 and 20.<br>
In FIG. 13, the ground terminal 16 is formed<br>
using a separate conductor from the conductive element<br>
that contains feeds 18 and 20.<br>
FIG. 14 shows an illustrative radiating element<br>
12 that is formed from a separate ground element 16 and<br>
serpentine element 66. Feeds 18 and 20 are formed at<br>
different locations in the serpentine element 66.<br>
The radiating element structures show in FIGS.<br>
1 and 4-14 are merely illustrative. In general, any<br>
suitable radiating element structures with multiple feeds<br>
may be used.<br>
As shown in FIG. 15, a printed circuit board<br>
such as printed circuit board 30 of FIG. 1 may have an<br>
upper surface of conductive material 74 and a lower<br>
surface of conductive material 76 separated by an<br>
insulating printed circuit board layer 78. The upper and<br>
lower conductive surfaces may contain a patterned metal<br>
such as copper. The lower surface may be relatively<br>
unpatterned and may be used to form a ground plane.<br>
Ground wires on the upper surface may be connected to the<br>
lower surface ground plane using conductive vias 80.<br>
When mounting the radiating element 12 to the printed<br>
circuit board 30, the patterned conductors on the upper<br>
surface of printed circuit board 30 may be used to form<br>
electrical contact with the radiating element.<br>
Electrical contact may be made using any<br>
suitable electrical connecting structures. In the<br>
example of FIG. 16, an elongated portion of radiating<br><br>
element 12 (e.g., a ground or feed element of the type<br>
shown in FIG. 1) is shown as forming a spring 82. When<br>
the antenna is mounted in proximity to the circuit board,<br>
the spring portion B2 presses against a conductive trace<br>
84 on the upper surface 74 of circuit board 30. This<br>
forms an electrical contact between trace 84 (which is<br>
connected to control circuitry 28 of FIG. 1) and the<br>
radiating element 12.<br>
If desired, spring-loaded pins may be used to<br>
make electrical contact between a radiating element 12<br>
and circuit board 30. One commonly-available spring-<br>
loaded pin is the so-called pogo pin. A cross-sectional<br>
side view of a spring-loaded pin 86 is shown in FIG. 17.<br>
Pin 86 has a reciprocating member 88 with a head portion<br>
90 that reciprocates within a hollow cylindrical pin<br>
housing 98. A spring 92 bears against the inner surface<br>
94 of pin housing 98 and the upper surface 96 of head 90.<br>
When member 88 is withdrawn within housing 98, spring 92<br>
is compressed and biases reciprocating member 88 in<br>
direction 100. This drives the tip 102 of member 88<br>
against a conductive element such as a portion of a<br>
circuit board or a radiating element.<br>
FIG. 18 shows an arrangement in which a spring-<br>
loaded pin 86 has been soldered to a radiating element 12<br>
with solder 104. The tip 102 of the pin presses against<br>
a conductor on the surface of circuit board 30.<br>
In the arrangement of FIG. 19, the spring-<br>
loaded pin 86 has been soldered to a circuit board 3 0 and<br>
is pressing upward against the radiating element 12, so<br>
that the tip 102 of reciprocating member 88-makes<br>
electrical contact with the radiating element.<br>
FIG. 20 shows an arrangement in which a spring<br><br>
108 has been soldered to a circuit board 30 with solder<br>
106. A portion 112 of radiating element 12 has been bent<br>
downward. The portion 112 of radiating element 12 may be<br>
formed during a metal foil stamping process (as an<br>
example). As shown in FIG. 20, spring 108 is compressed<br>
and bears against the portion 112, thereby forming<br>
electrical contact between radiating element 12 and<br>
circuit board 30.<br>
The arrangement of FIG. 21 is similar to the<br>
arrangement of FIG. 20, but involves forming an<br>
electrical connection to a radiating element 12 that is<br>
fabricated from a flex circuit. The radiating element 12<br>
has a post 110. As shown in FIG. 21, a spring 108 that<br>
has been soldered to circuit board 30 with solder 106<br>
bears against post 110 to form electrical contact.<br>
The pins and springs of FIGS. 18, 19, 20, and<br>
21 need not be soldered to the circuit board or radiating<br>
element 12. Arrangements in which the connecting<br>
electrical structure is not soldered are said to be<br>
floating. FIGS. 22 and 23 show floating pin arrangements<br>
in which pin 86 forms an electrical connection between<br>
radiating element 12 and circuit board 30. In the<br>
arrangement of FIG. 22, the tip 102 of pin 86 presses<br>
against the radiating element 12. In the arrangement of<br>
FIG. 23, the tip 102 of pin 86 presses downward against a<br>
conductor on circuit board 30.<br>
Any suitable circuit architecture may be used<br>
to interconnect the control circuitry 28 with the feeds<br>
of the antenna and radiating element 12.<br>
Consider, as an example, the arrangement of<br>
FIG. 24. As shown in FIG. 24, an RF transceiver<br>
integrated circuit 114 is connected to ground 16. RF<br><br>
transceiver integrated circuit 114 is also connected to<br>
two antenna feeds 18 and 20 using input-output data paths<br>
115 and switching circuitry formed from switches 116.<br>
Switches 116 may be formed from PIN diodes, high-speed<br>
field-effect transistors (FETs), or any other suitable<br>
switch components. The switches for each feed are<br>
complementary and work in tandem. The state of each<br>
switch is the inverse of the other. When switch SW1 is<br>
on, switch SW2 is off and a first antenna port is active<br>
while a second antenna port is inactive. when switch<br>
SW1 is off, switch SW2 is on and the first antenna port<br>
is inactive while the second antenna port is active.<br>
Using this type of arrangement ensures that only one feed<br>
is active at a time. feed1 is active and feed2 is<br>
inactive when switch SW1 is on and switch SW2 is off.<br>
Feed2 is active and feed1 is inactive when switch SW2 is<br>
on and switch SW1 is off.<br>
The graph of FIG. 25 shows the frequency<br>
response of the radiating element 12 in two conditions.<br>
The solid line shows the return loss of the radiating<br>
element at its fundamental operating frequency range when<br>
the first port is active. In this configuration, the<br>
antenna is tuned so that it operates at the frequency fa.<br>
The dashed line in FIG. 25 shows the return loss of the<br>
radiating element when the second port is active, in<br>
this configuration, the antenna is tuned so that it<br>
operates at frequency fb.<br>
In the arrangement of FIG. 26, switch SW1 may<br>
handle two different bands (fa and fb), whereas switch SW2<br>
may handle frequency band fc. Switch SW1 has three<br>
states, in its first state, input-output signal path 118<br>
is connected to feed1 and the antenna operates at<br><br>
frequency fa. as shown in FIG. 27. In its second state,<br>
input-output signal path 12 0 is connected to feed1 and<br>
the antenna operates in band fb. As described in<br>
connection with FIG. 24, switch SW2 is off whenever<br>
switch SW1 is on. When it is desired to tune the<br>
antenna, the control circuitry 2 8 places switch SW1 in a<br>
third state in which lines 118 and 12 0 are disconnected<br>
from feed1 (i.e.-, switch SW1 is off). When switch SW1 is<br>
turned off, switch SW2 is turned on, so the antenna<br>
operates at shifted fundamental frequency fc (FIG. 27).<br>
As shown in FIGS. 28 and 29, passive RF<br>
components such as duplexers and diplexers may be used to<br>
couple RF transceiver 114 to the antenna feeds. A<br>
duplexer can be used to combine or separate RF signals<br>
that are in adjacent bands (e.g., 850 MHz and 900 MHz).<br>
A diplexer can be used to combine or separate RF signals<br>
that are in distant bands (e.g., 850 MHz and 1800 MHz).<br>
As shown in FIG. 28, duplexer 122 may be<br>
coupled between data paths 118 and 12 0 and switch SW1.<br>
Switch SW2 is coupled between data path 126 and feed2.<br>
When it is desired to use feed1, switch SW1 is turned on<br>
and switch SW2 is turned off. This tunes the antenna so<br>
that it operates according to the solid line of FIG. 29.<br>
In this state, RF transceiver 114 can use paths 118 and<br>
120 to transmit and receive in either frequency band fa or<br>
frequency band fb, because the radiating element 12 of the<br>
antenna is designed to have a sufficiently large<br>
bandwidth in its fundamental operating frequency range to<br>
handle the adjacent bands fa and fb. When it is desired<br>
to tune the antenna by using feed2, switch SW1 is turned<br>
off and switch SW2 is turned on. In this state, path 126<br>
is connected to feed2 and transceiver 114 can transmit<br><br>
and receive signals using band fc, as shown by the dotted<br>
line in FIG. 29.<br>
In the arrangement of FIG. 30, a diplexer 124<br>
is used in place of a duplexer. The radiating element 12<br>
in this scenario is designed to have a harmonic at fb-<br>
Because a diplexer 124 is being used, the signals<br>
associated with paths 118 and 120 must be more widely<br>
separated than in the duplexer arrangement of FIG. 28.<br>
As shown by the solid line in FIG. 31, when feed1 is<br>
switched into use by turning on SW1 and turning off SW2,<br>
transceiver 114 can use paths 118 and 120 to transmit and<br>
receive in either fundamental frequency band fa or<br>
harmonic frequency band fb. When it is desired to tune<br>
the antenna by using feed2, switch SW1 is turned off and<br>
switch SW2 is turned on. In this state, path 126 is<br>
connected to feed2 and transceiver 114 can transmit and<br>
receive signals using band fc, as shown by the dotted line<br>
in FIG. 31.<br>
The bands used in GSM communications each have<br>
two subbands, one of which contains channels for<br>
transmitting data and the other of which contains<br>
channels for receiving data. As shown in FIG. 32, a<br>
switch 116 can be used to connect an appropriate transmit<br>
or receive data path to its associated feed 128. Paths<br>
118a and 118b are connected to the RF transceiver. In<br>
GSM communications, signals are either transmitted or are<br>
received. Simultaneous transmission and reception is not<br>
permitted. When the RF transceiver has data to transmit,<br>
switch 116 connects the transmit line 118a to feed 128.<br>
In receive mode, the switch 116 is directed to connect<br>
feed 128 to path 118b. When it is desired to inactivate<br>
the feed 128, switch 116 may be turned off. In the<br><br>
example of FIG. 32, paths 118a and 118b are labeled 850T<br>
(850 MHz transmit) and 8S0R (850 MHz receive). The same<br>
principal applies to all GSM bands. The input-output<br>
data paths connected to the RF transmitter 114 in FIGS.<br>
24, 26, 28, and 30 are shown as single bidirectional<br>
paths rather than as separate transmit and receive paths<br>
to avoid over-complicating the drawings.<br>
An arrangement in which a duplexer 122 may be<br>
used to couple an RF transceiver to a feed 128 is shown<br>
in FIG. 33. When incoming data is received on feed 128<br>
or when outgoing data is being transmitted, switch 116 is<br>
on. Switch 116 is off when it is desired to tune the<br>
antenna by using a different feed. Duplexer 12 2 is<br>
frequency sensitive. Incoming data (e.g., on the 850R<br>
subband) is routed to line 118b by the passive RF<br>
components in duplexer 122. When outgoing data is<br>
transmitted on line 118a, duplexer 12 2 routes those<br>
signals to line 128 via switch 116.<br>
When architectures of the type shown in FIGS.<br>
24, 26, 28, and 30 are used for GSM-type communications,<br>
an active subband switching arrangement of the type shown<br>
in FIG. 32 or a passive subband routing arrangement of<br>
the type shown in FIG. 33 may be used. In either case,<br>
switching circuitry 116 is used to ensure that the<br>
appropriate antenna feed is active.<br>
In some communications protocols such as those<br>
based on code division multiple access (CDMA) technology,<br>
signals can be transmitted and received simultaneously.<br>
There is therefore no need for a switch to actively<br>
switch between transmit and receive bands. Examples of<br>
communications schemes that use CDMA technology include<br>
CDMA cellular telephone communications and 3G data<br><br>
communications over the 2170 MHz band (commonly referred<br>
to as UMTS or Universal Mobile Telecommunications<br>
System). With CDMA-based arrangements, a duplexer<br>
arrangement of the type shown in FIG. 33 may be used to<br>
separate transmitting and receiving frequencies from each<br>
other.<br>
Some handheld devices need to cover many bands.<br>
An example of an arrangement that may be used to cover<br>
five bands (e.g., the four GSM bands plus the UMTS band)<br>
using a two port antenna is shown in FIG. 34. A graph<br>
showing the placement of each of the bands is shown in<br>
FIG. 35. The antenna is designed to have a fundamental<br>
operating frequency range 128 at about 850-900 MHz and a<br>
harmonic operating frequency range 13 0 at about 1800-<br>
1900. When switch SW1 is on and switch SW2 is off, feed1<br>
is active and the antenna's response is as shown by the<br>
solid line in FIG. 35. The antenna is designed to have a<br>
relatively broad bandwidth at its fundamental and<br>
harmonic operating frequencies. As a result, the antenna<br>
covers both the 850 MHz and 900 MHz GSM bands in the<br>
fundamental operating frequency range 128 and covers both<br>
the 1800 MHz and 1900 MHz GSM bands using the harmonic<br>
operating frequency range 130. When switch SW2 is on and<br>
switch SWl is off, feed 2 is active and the antenna is<br>
tuned. This shifts the harmonic operating frequency<br>
range 13 0 to a higher frequency, so that it covers the<br>
UMTS band at 2170 MHz.<br>
An example of an arrangement that may be used<br>
to cover four bands (e.g., the four GSM bands) using a<br>
two port antenna is shown in FIG. 36. Diplexers 124 are<br>
used to couple RF transceiver 114 to switching circuitry<br>
116. One diplexer 124 handles the 850 MHz and 1800 MHz<br><br>
bands while the other diplexer 124 handles the 900 MHz<br>
and 1900 MHz bands. A graph showing the placement of<br>
each of the bands is shown in FIG. 37. The antenna is<br>
designed to have a fundamental operating frequency range<br>
128 at about 850 MHz and a harmonic operating frequency<br>
range 130 at about 1800. When switch SW1 is on and<br>
switch SW2 is off, feed1 is active and the antenna's<br>
response is as shown by the solid line in FIG. 37. The<br>
antenna has a narrow bandwidth that covers a single band<br>
at each resonant frequency.<br>
As shown by the solid line in FIG. 37, when<br>
feed1 is used, the antenna can cover both the 850 MHz and<br>
1800 MHz bands. When it is desired to tune the antenna,<br>
switches 116 are adjusted so that feed2 is used. This<br>
shifts both the fundamental operating range 128 and the<br>
harmonic operating frequency range 13 0 to higher<br>
frequencies, so as to cover the 900 MHz and 190 0 MHz<br>
bands, respectively, as shown by the dashed line in FIG.<br>
37.<br>
An example of an arrangement that may be used<br>
to cover five bands (e.g., the four GSM bands and the<br>
UMTS band) using a three port antenna is shown in FIG.<br>
38. Diplexers 124 are used to couple RF transceiver 114<br>
to switching circuitry 116. One diplexer 124 handles the<br>
850 MHz and 1800 MHz bands while the other diplexer 124<br>
handles the 900 MHz and 1900 MHz bands. The placement of<br>
each of the bands is shown in the graph of FIG. 39. When<br>
feed1 is used, the antenna is has a fundamental operating<br>
frequency range 128 at about 850 MHz and a harmonic<br>
operating frequency range 130 at about 1800 MHz. when<br>
switch SW1 is on and switches SW2 and SW3 are off, feed1<br>
is active and the antenna's response is as shown by the<br><br>
solid line in FIG. 39.<br>
As shown by the solid line in FIG. 39, when<br>
feed1 is used, the antenna covers both the 8 50 MHz and<br>
1800 MHz bands. Due to the relatively narrow bandwidth<br>
of the antenna, adjacent bands are not covered without<br>
tuning. When it is desired to tune the antenna to cover<br>
the 900 MHz and 1900 MHz bands, switches 116 are adjusted<br>
so that feed2 is used. This shifts both the fundamental<br>
operating range 128 and the harmonic operating frequency<br>
range 130 to higher frequencies, so as to cover the 900<br>
MHz and 1900 MHz bands, respectively, as shown by the<br>
dashed line in FIG. 39.<br>
When it is desired to tune the antenna to cover<br>
the 2170 MHz band, switches 116 are adjusted so that<br>
feed3 is switched into use. As a result, the fundamental<br>
operating range 128 and the harmonic operating frequency<br>
range 130 are shifted to higher frequencies. With this<br>
antenna tuning configuration, the harmonic operating<br>
frequency range 130 covers the 2170 MHz band, as shown by<br>
the dot-and-dashed line in FIG. 39.<br>
FIG. 40 shows details of an arrangement of the<br>
type described in FIGS. 34 in which five bands are<br>
covered (e.g., the four GSM bands and the UMTS band)<br>
using two antenna ports.<br>
Processing circuitry 42 can generate data to be<br>
transmitted and can provide this data to RF module 132 in<br>
wireless communications circuitry 50 using a path such as<br>
path 140. Data that is received by the handheld device<br>
may be routed from RF module 132 to processing circuitry<br>
42 via path 142. Transceiver 114 can be coupled to<br>
radiating element 12 in antenna module 134 via feed1,<br>
feed2, and ground. Switching circuitry 116 can be used<br><br>
to regulate which antenna port is active. Switch sw1 can<br>
be used to select a desired GSM signal path to connect to<br>
feed1 when feed1 is active and is used to disconnect<br>
feed1 from the RF transmitter when feed1 is inactive.<br>
Switch SW2. which is on when switch SWl is inactive, can<br>
used to seletively activate feed2. Switch SW2 can<br>
receive transmitted signals from RF transceiver 114 and<br>
can deliver received signals to RF transceiver 114<br>
through duplexer 122, which can handle the transmit and<br>
receive subbands for a 2170 MHz UMTS band.<br>
A power amplifier integrated circuit 136 may be<br>
used to boost outgoing signal levels. Power amplifier<br>
integrated circut 136 contains power amplifiers 138. The<br>
power amplifiers may be provided as separate integrated<br>
circuits if desired.<br>
A testing arrangement that may be used to<br>
calibrate an RF module 132 during the process of<br>
manufacturing a handheld device 38 is shown in FIG. 41.<br>
During testing, tester 144 can apply power and control<br>
signals to processing circuitry 42 using a path such as<br>
path 14 7. The control signals may direct the processing<br>
circuitry 42 to transmit signals to antenna module 134.<br>
Each feed can be calibrated in turn. Tester 144 has a<br>
cable and test probe that can be connected to either RF<br>
switch connector 152 (when the cable and probe are in the<br>
position indicated by line 148) or RF switch connector<br>
156 (when the cable and probe are in the position<br>
indicated by line 150). During testing, the probe taps<br>
into the signals that would otherwise be transmitted over<br>
antenna module 134.<br>
RF switch connectors 152 and 156 have two<br>
operating conditions. A cross-section of an illustrative<br><br>
RF switch connector 166 is shown in FIGS. 42 and 43.<br>
When no test probe is inserted, as shown in FIG. 42,<br>
input 160 is connected to output 162 via conductor 164.<br>
When the tip of a test probe 168 is inserted into switch<br>
connector 166, conductor 164 is pressed downwards, which<br>
opens the circuit between conductor 164 and output 162<br>
and electrically connects input 160 to the test probe<br>
168.<br>
RF switch connector 152 may be used to tap into<br>
signals that would normally pass from data path 154 to<br>
feed1, whereas RF switch connector 156 may be used to tap<br>
into signals that would normally pass from data path 158<br>
to feed2. During calibration, tester 144 measures the<br>
signal strenth received on each feed for a variety of<br>
output power settings. Using curve fitting techniques,<br>
tester 144 determines which calibration settings should<br>
be stored in the circuitry 10. The calibration settings<br>
are loaded into non-volatile memory 40 such as flash<br>
memory over a path such as path 146. Later, during<br>
normal operation, processing circuitry 42 uses the stored<br>
calibration settings to make calibrating adjustments to<br>
the output signal levels of the RF module 132.<br>
Illustrative steps involved in testing and<br>
fabricating handheld devices with tunable multi-port<br>
antennas are shown in FIG. 44.<br>
At step 170, a circuit board assembly<br>
containing the RF moudule 132 and antenna module 134 can<br>
be fabricated.<br>
At step 172, tester 144 of FIG. 41 may send<br>
control signals to processing circuitry 42 via path 147.<br>
The control signals direct the processing circuitry 42 to<br>
use transceiver 114 and switching circuitry 116 to<br><br>
transmit suitable test signals to the antenna on feeds IB<br>
and 20. Each feed is excercised separately. To ensure<br>
accurate measurements, test signals may be transmitted<br>
using several different power settings while tester 144<br>
gathers associated test measurements.<br>
At step 174, the tester 144 can process the<br>
test measurements (e.g., using curve-fitting routines)<br>
and generates corresponding calibration settings. The<br>
calibration settings indicate what adjustments need to be<br>
made by RF module 132 during normal operation to ensure<br>
that the transmitted RF power levels are accurate.<br>
The tester 144 can store the calibration<br>
information in memory 40 at step 176. With one suitable<br>
arrangement, the calibration information is stored in a<br>
non-volatile memory such as a flash memory to ensure that<br>
the calibration information will be retained in the event<br>
of a loss of power by the handheld electronic device 38.<br>
During steps 178 and 180, the handheld<br>
electronic device 38 may be used by a user to place<br>
cellular telephone calls, to upload or download data over<br>
a 36 link, or to otherwise wirelessly transmit and<br>
receive data.<br>
During step 178, the processing circuitry 42<br>
(FIG. 41) retrieves the calibration settings data from<br>
memory 40 and uses the retrieved calibration settings to<br>
adjust the power output of the handheld device so that<br>
the output power is calibrated. The processing circuitry<br>
42 calibrates each port separately, so the output power<br>
is accurate regardless of which antenna port is being<br>
used.<br>
During step 180, the user can transmit and<br>
receive data using the antenna. The processing circuitry<br><br>
42 tunes the antenna as needed by selecting an<br>
appropriate antenna feed using switching circuitry 116.<br>

overlapping transmit and receive subbands.<br><br>
A compact tunable antenna for a handheld electronic device and methods for calibrating and using compact tunable<br>
antennas are provided. The antenna can have multiple ports. Each port can have an associated feed and ground. The antenna design<br>
can be implemented with a small footprint while covering a large bandwidth. The antenna can have a radiating element formed from<br>
a conductive structure such as a patch or helix. The antenna can be shaped to accommodate buttons and other components in the<br>
handheld device. The antenna may be connected to a printed circuit board in the handheld device using springs, pogo pins, and other<br>
suitable connecting structures. Radio- frequency switches and passive components such as duplexers and diplexers may be used to<br>
couple radio- frequency transceiver circuitry to the different feeds of the antenna. Antenna efficiency can be enhanced by avoiding<br>
the use of capacitive loading for antenna tuning.</td>
