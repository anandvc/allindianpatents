BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	 Field of the Invention<br>
		The present invention relates to a vehicle that makes<br>
a motion such as turning while tilting the body, and in particular,<br>
it relates to a vehicle including a fuel pump inside a fuel<br>
tank.<br>
2.	 Description of the Related Art<br>
		A motorcycle fuel tank disclosed in JP-A-2002-160665 uses<br>
the rear half of the fuel tank as the main chamber, in which<br>
a fuel pump is mounted. The fuel tank has a float fuel level<br>
gauge on the top of the fuel pump, in which an arm pivotally<br>
attached to the body of the gauge is disposed such that the<br>
free end pivots above the fuel pump. This eliminates the need<br>
for a gauge insertion opening in the fuel Lank separate from<br>
that for the fuel pump, reducing the limitation to the place<br>
of installation of the fuel pump.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
		However, since the foregoing motorcycle fuel tank has<br>
a float fuel level gauge at the top of the fuel pump, and<br>
the arm pivotally attached to the body of the gauge is disposed<br>
such that the free end pivots above the fuel pump, the pivot<br>
nge of the float at the free end of the arm does not reach<br><br>
- 1 -<br><br>
the bottom of the main chamber, making it impossible to measure<br>
the amount of fuel in the main chamber eccurately.<br>
	In order to solve the above problem, the present invention<br>
has as an object the provision of a vehicle capable of accurate<br>
fuel measurement without increasing the ontside dimensions<br>
of a fuel tanl in which the shape of the fuel tank is devised<br>
so that the float of the fuel gauge can pivot from the bottom<br>
to the top of the fuel tank, and in which the fuel gauge is<br>
disposed in the rear center of the bottom of the fuel tank.<br>
	A vehicle according to the invention includes: a body<br>
frame; a fuel tank supported by the body frame; and a fuel<br>
gauge having pivotally an arm that supports a float rising<br>
and falling depending on the amount of fuel in the fuel tank.<br>
The fuel tank is disposed such that the front right part and<br>
the front left part of the bottom are located in positions<br>
lower than the front central part, the uppermost part of the<br>
upper surface is located in a position higher than the front<br>
of the bottom, and the rear central part of the bottom is<br>
located in a position lower than the front central part. The<br>
fuel gauge is disposed in the rear central part of the bottom<br>
in the fuel tank such that the float rises and falls at the<br>
front right part or the front left part.<br>
	The invention allows accurate fuel measurement without<br>
increasing the outside dimensions of a fuel tank by devising<br>
the shape of the fuel tank so that the float of the fuel gauge<br><br>
 -2-<br><br>
can pivot from the bottom to the top of the fuel tank, end<br>
disposing the fuel gauge in the rear center of the bottom<br>
of the fuel tank.<br>

view of the structure of another fuel pump and a fuel gauge.<br>
		Referring first to Fig. 1, the structure of the motorcycle<br>
will be described. In Fig. 1, the motorcycle 1 includes a<br>
head pipe 2, to which a main frame 4 extending backward and<br>
diagonally downward and a down tube 5 extending downward are<br><br>
- 4 -<br><br>
connected. To the main frame 4 is connected a subframe 6<br>
extending backward substantially in parallel therewith at a<br>
given angle. A space surrounded by the main frame 4, the down<br>
tube 5, and the subframe 6 encloses a transmission-integrated<br>
engine unit 7 . The main frame 4 and the subframe 6 are located<br>
in the center of the breadth of the vehicle and construct a<br>
body frame 3.<br>
	The engine unit 7 is constructed such that the cylinder<br>
axis of a cylinder block 8 inclines slightly toward the front<br>
of the vehicle, and a transmission case 9, which is located<br>
under the cylinder block 8 and encloses a crankshaft and a<br>
transmission, is suspended by the main frame 4 and the down<br>
tube 5 along the breadth of the vehicle. The upper end of<br>
the engine unit 7 is fixed to a bracket 10 fixed to the main<br>
frame 4. Engine power is transmitted to a rear wheel 11 via<br>
a drive sprocket (not shown) firmly fixed to the drive shaft<br>
of the engine unit 7 and a chain (not shown) wound around the<br>
drive sprocket.<br>
	To the cylinder block 8 is connected an injector 12, an<br>
intake pipe 13, and an exhaust pipe 14. The injector 12, whose<br>
upper end is connected to a fuel feed pipe 15, emits a jet<br>
of fuel into the cylinder under the control of a control unit<br>
40. The intake pipe 13 connects to a throttle body 16, through<br>
which the air supplied from an air cleaner (not shown) is drawn<br>
into the cylinder with the amount controlled by a throttle<br><br>
- 5 -<br><br>
valve (not shown) in the throttle body 16. An intake port<br>
(not shown) in the intake pipe 13 connects to an intake pressure<br>
sensor 17. The intake pressure sensor 17 has the function<br>
of sensing the intake pressure in the intake port and outputting<br>
its intake-pressure signal to the control unit 40.<br>
	A steering shaft (not shown) rotatably passes through<br>
the head pipe 2. To the upper end of the steering shaft is<br>
mounted a steering handle (not shown). The upper end of a<br>
front fork 18 is attached to the steering shaft. The lower<br>
end of the front fork 18 rotatably supports a front wheel 19.<br>
	A fuel tank 20 is provided on the main frame 4 and the<br>
subframe 6. A tandem seat 30. is provided behind the fuel tank<br>
20. As shown in the enlarged left side view of the fuel tank<br>
and the body frame in Fig. 2, the bottom 21 of the fuel tank<br>
20 has a bottom-front central part 21a in the front center,<br>
and a flat portion 21b in the rear center of the bottom, in<br>
a position lower than the bottom-front central part 21 a, and<br>
in parallel with the parallel part of the subframe 6, in the<br>
side view of the vehicle in the drawing. As shown in Fig.<br>
3, on the front left and right sides of the bottom-front central<br>
part 21a are provided a bottom-front left part 2lc and a<br>
bottom-front right part 21d which project downward from the<br>
bottom-front central part 21a. The fuel tank 20 is disposed<br>
such that the uppermost portion 21e of the upper surface is<br>
located above the front of the bottom. The "side view of the<br><br>
- 6 -<br><br>
vehicle" means a view in which the left is the front (or the<br>
rear) of the vehicle and the right is the rear (or the front)<br>
as viewed from the side, which also applies to the following.<br>
	The bottom-front left part 21c and the bottom-front right<br>
part 21d of the fuel tank 20 have laterally U-shaped guide<br>
brackets 22 which are open forward (leftward in the drawing)<br>
and which project from the side walls facing the main frame<br>
4. The main frame 4 has positioning members 23 projecting<br>
from the side walls facing the guide brackets 22. The front<br>
of the fuel tank 20 is supported by the main frame 4 by inserting<br>
the guide brackets 22 projecting from the side walls of the<br>
bottom-front left part 21c and the bottom-front right part<br>
21d into the positioning members 23 projecting from the<br>
corresponding positions of the main frame 4.<br>
	The bottom-front left part 21c and the bottom-front right<br>
part 21d of the fuel tank 20 and the projecting positions of<br>
the positioning members 23 of the main frame 4 are determined<br>
so as to form a clearance A between the bottom-front central<br>
part 21a of the fuel tank 20 and the upper surface of the main<br>
frame 4 when the front of the fuel tank 20 is positioned.<br>
	A bracket 24 for fixing the rear end of the fuel tank<br>
20 to the subframe 6 is mounted to the rear end (on the right<br>
in the drawing) of the flat portion 21b of the fuel tank 20.<br>
	The subframe 6 has a positioning member 25 projecting from<br>
the position facing the bracket 24. The rear end of the fuel<br><br>
- 7 -<br><br>
tank 20 is supported by the subframe 6 by fixing the bracket<br>
24 to the positioning member 25 of the subframe 6 via a rubber<br>
damper 26 with a bolt 31.<br>
	Since the rear end of the fuel tank 20 is supported by<br>
the subframe 6 with the bracket 24 and the positioning member<br>
25 of the subframe 6, a clearance B is formed between the flat<br>
portion 21b of the fuel tank 20 and the upper surface of the<br>
subframe 6, as shown in the cross-sectional view in Fig. 4<br>
taken on line B-B of Fig. 2.<br>
	The clearance A and the clearance B are connected with<br>
each other by supporting the front of the fuel tank 20 by the<br>
main frame 4 and supporting the rear end of the fuel tank 20<br>
by the subframe 6. As a result, the continuous clearances<br>
A and B formed between the bottom 21 of the fuel tank 20 and<br>
the upper surfaces of the main frame 4 and the subframe 6 can<br>
enclose multiple components.<br>
	The Fuel tank 20 can be maintained by taking off the bracket<br>
24 at the rear end from the positioning member 25 and lifting<br>
the rear end with the guide brackets 22 and the positioning<br>
members 23 at the front as the pivot center.<br>
	As shown in the enlarged left side view showing the structure<br>
of the interior of the fuel tank of Fig. 5, a fuel pump 27<br>
for feeding the fuel in the fuel tank 20 to the fuel feed pipe<br>
15 is provided upright from the flat portion 21b such that<br>
the part except a fuel delivery portion 27a and a power supply<br><br>
- 8 -<br><br>
portion 27c mounted to the lower end thereof is enclosed in<br>
the fuel tank 20. The fuel pump 27 stands upright such that<br>
its fuel intake port (not shown) is exposed upward from the<br>
flat portion 21b in the fuel tank 20 and the fuel delivery<br>
portion 27a and the power supply portion 27c are exposed downward<br>
from the flat portion 21b outside the fuel tank 20.<br>
	To the side 27b of the fuel pump 27 is integrated a fuel<br>
gauge 28 for measuring the amount of fuel in the fuel tank<br>
20. The fuel gauge 23 includes an arm 28b whose base end is<br>
pivotally attached to a pivot shaft 28a and a float 28c attached<br>
to the end of the arm 28b.<br>
	The fuel gauge 28 measures the amount of fuel in such<br>
a way that the arm 28b that supports the float 28c pivots depending<br>
on the change in fuel level in the range from the vicinity<br>
of the bottom of the bottom-front left part 21c on the front<br>
left side of the fuel tank 20 to the vicinity of the uppermost<br>
part 2le of the upper surface, shown in Fig. 3, and the change<br>
of the pivot position is converted to a change in the angle<br>
of the pivot shaft 28a. The fuel gauge 28 has a signal/power<br>
cable (not shown) that is connected from the flat portion 21b<br>
of the fuel tank 20 to the power supply portion 27c mounted<br>
outside the flat portion 21b. The signal/power cable is<br>
connected to an inner contact terminal (not shown) of the power<br>
supply portion 27c inside the fuel tank 20 and is connected<br>
to a main harness 50 via a harness 51 connected to an outer<br><br>
-9 -<br><br>
contact terminal (not shown) of the power supply portion 27c<br>
outside the fuel tank 20. The signal/power cable outputs a<br>
fuel measurement signal to the control unit 40 via the harness<br>
51 and the main harness 50. The signal /power cable slso supplies<br>
power supplied from a relay 45 to the fuel pump 27 via the<br>
harness 51 and the main harness 50.<br>
	As shown in the plan view of Fig . 6 which shows the position<br>
of the fuel gauge in the fuel tank shown in Fig. 3, the fuel<br>
gauge 28 is mounted on the left of the fuel tank 20, with the<br>
pivot shaft 28a inclined backward at an angle a relative to<br>
the center line C that passes through the center of the fuel<br>
pump 27 in the drawing, or relative to the width of the vehicle<br>
in plan view. The fuel gauge 28 is thus mounted to the fuel<br>
pump 27. Accordingly, when the float 28c rises and falls at<br>
the bottom-front left part 21c in the fuel tank 20, the float<br>
28c moves toward the center when rising and pivots in arc shape<br>
along the side of the botto-front left part 21c. As a result,<br>
the pivot range of the float 28c becomes larger than that of<br>
conventional one, from the vicinity of the bottom of the<br>
bottom-front left part 21c to the vicinity of the uppermost<br>
part 21e of the upper surface, allowing accurate fuel measurement.<br>
	The "plan view of the vehicle" means a view in which the left<br>
is the front (or the rear) of the vehicle and the right is<br>
the rear (or the front), as viewed from the top, which also<br>
applies to the following.<br>
- 10 -<br><br>
	As shown in Fig. 4, the cross section taken along B-B<br>
of Fig. 2, the fuel feed pipe 15 is mounted to the fuel delivery<br>
portion 27a of the fuel pump 27. The fuel feed pipe 15 passes<br>
through the bottom 21 of the fuel tank 20 while using the clearance<br>
B, extends from the bottom 21 to the front left upper position<br>
outside the fuel tank 20, forms a bent portion 15a in the vicinity<br>
of the pivot center of the fuel tank 20, and connects to the<br>
injector 12. The fuel feed pipe 15 also has a bent portion<br>
15b on the side from the fuel delivery portion 27a to the bottom<br>
of the fuel tank 20.<br>
	The connections of the fuel feed pipe 15 with the fuel<br>
delivery portion 27a and the injector 12 are made of metal;<br>
the intermediate portions of the fuel feed pipe 15 that construct<br>
the bent portions 15a and 15b are made of plastics such as<br>
rubber.<br>
	The control unit 40 for controlling the direction of the<br>
motorcycle 1 is fixed to the upper surface of the main frame<br>
4 in the clearance A between the bottom-front central part<br>
21a of the bottom 21 of the fuel tank 20 and the upper surface<br>
of the main frame 4. The control unit 40 connects to a harness<br>
52 via the main harness 50 across the injector 12, the throttle<br>
body 16, the intake pressure sensor 17, the fuel gauge 28,<br>
and so forth, and controls the operation of various actuators<br>
for the engine unit 7 on the basis of the detection signals<br>
from various senses. In the clearance A, the relay 45 for<br><br>
- 11 -<br><br>
controlling power supply to the control system of the motorcycle<br>
1 is fixed to the upper surface of the main frame 4 with a<br>
mounting member 46. The relay 45 connects to a harness 53.<br>
	The harness 53 connects to the main harness 50. The relay<br>
45 supplies power to the injector 12, the throttle body 16,<br>
the intake pressure sensor 17, the fuel gauge 28, the control<br>
unit 40, and so forth via the harness 53 and the main harness<br>
50. The main harness 50 is disposed along the side of the<br>
main frame 4 and the subframe 6.<br>
	Since the bottom-front left part 21c and the bottom-front<br>
right part 21d, which project downward from the bottonrt-front<br>
central part 21a, and the uppermost part 21e are provided at<br>
the front of the fuel tank 20, a sufficient height of the fuel<br>
tank 20 can be provided without increasing the outside dimensions.<br>
	Since the fuel gauge 28 is disposed on the flat portion 21b<br>
in the rear center, in a position lower than the bottom-front<br>
central part 21a of the fuel tank 20, the fuel gauge 28 can<br>
be disposed without increasing the outside dimensions of the<br>
fuel tank 20. Since the fuel gauge 28 is disposed so that<br>
the float 28c can move vertically at the bottom-front left<br>
part 21c in the fuel tank 20, where a sufficient downward height<br>
is provided, a large pivotal angle of the arm 28b can be provided,<br>
allowing accurate fuel measurement without increasing the<br>
outside dimensions of the fuel tank 20.<br>
	Since the fuel gauge 28 is disposed on the flat portion<br><br>
- 12 -<br><br>
21b at the rear center such that the pivot shaft 28a of the<br>
arm 28b is inclined backward at an angle a relative to the<br>
width of the vehicle in plan view, the float 28c moves close<br>
to the center when rising or falling, allowing the pivot angle<br>
of the arm 28b to be increased over conventional one to permit<br>
accurate fuel measurement without increasing the outside<br>
dimensions of the upper or lower part of the fuel tank 20.<br>
	Since the fuel gauge 28 is disposed on the left of the<br>
fuel pump 27, and the fuel gauge 26 and the fuel pump 27 are<br>
united to one, the pivot shaft 28a of the fuel gauge 28 can<br>
be disposed in a desired position without increasing the outside<br>
dimensions of the fuel tank 20 and with a simple structure,<br>
allowing more accurate fuel measurement.<br>
	Since the fuel pump 27 is disposed in the fuel tank 20<br>
such that the length or the line perpendicular to the flat<br>
portion 21b of Fig. 5 is substantially along the vertical<br>
direction, the upper surface of the rear of the fuel tank 20<br>
can be located lower than the front, allowing the rear of the<br>
fuel tenk 20 to be formed to the riding position of a rider<br>
to improve ride comfort.<br>
	While the embodiment shows a case in which the fuel pump<br>
27 is disposed substantially vertically in the fuel tank 20,<br>
a fuel pump 50 may be disposed substantially horizontally in<br>
the fuel tank 20 such that the length of the fuel pump 50 is<br>
along the flat portion 21b at the rear center, as shown in<br><br>
- 13 -<br><br>
Figs. 7 and 8. In this case, a fuel gauge 60 is mounted on<br>
the left side of the fuel pump 50 and has an arm 60b whose<br>
base end is pivotally mounted to a pivot shaft 60a, and a float<br>
60c mounted to the end of the arm 60b. The reference numeral<br>
61 in the drawings indicates s filter.<br>
	The fuel gauge 60 measures the amount of fuel, as with<br>
the fuel gauge 28, in such a way that the arm 60b that supports<br>
the float 60c pivots depending on the change in fuel level<br>
in the range from the vicinity of the bottom of the bottom-front<br>
left part 21c at the front left side of the fuel tank 20 to<br>
the vicinity of the uppermost part 21e, shown in Fig. 3, the<br>
change of the pivot position is converted to a change in the<br>
angle of the pivot shaft 60a.<br>
	Thus, since the fuel gauge 60 is also arranged at the<br>
bottom-front left part 21c in the fuel tank 20 so that the<br>
float 60c rises and falls in a space with a sufficient downward<br>
height, a large pivot angle of the float 60c can be provided,<br>
allowing accurate fuel measurement without increasing the<br>
outside dimensions of the fuel tank 20 Since the fuel gauge<br>
60 is disposed in the fuel tank 20 such that the length is<br>
substantially along the horizontal direction, the upper surface<br>
of the rear of the fuel tank 20 can be further lowered.<br>
Consequently, the limitation due to the shape of the fuel tank<br>
can be circumvented in arrangement of the fuel pump in the<br>
fuel tank.<br>
- 14 -<br><br>
	When the bottom is inclined as a slope 70a that is inclined<br>
downward from the front toward the rear, as in a fuel tank<br>
70 of Fig. 9, a fuel pump 81 integrated vith a fuel gauge 80<br>
may be disposed at the rear of the slope 70a. The front left<br>
and right parts of the fuel tank 70 have bottom-front left<br>
and right parts (not shown).<br>
	In this Case, the fuel gauge 80 mounted on the left side<br>
of the fuel pump 81 has an arm 80b whose base end is pivotally<br>
mounted to a pivot shaft 80a, and a float 80c mounted to the<br>
end of the arm 80b.<br>
	Thus, since the fuel gauge 80 is also arranged at the<br>
bottom-front left part in the fuel tank 70 so that the float<br>
80c rises and falls in a space with a sufficient downward height,<br>
a large pivot angle of the float 80c can be provided, allowing<br>
accurate fuel measurement without increasing the outside<br>
dimensions of the fuel tank 70.<br>
	While the embodiments show a case in which the float of<br>
the fuel gauge rises snd falls above the bottom-front left<br>
part in the fuel tank, the invention is not limited to that<br>
but the float may move vertically above the bottom-front right<br>
part. In this caSe, the fuel gauge can be mounted on the right<br>
side of the fuel pump.<br>
	A vehicle according to the invention includes: a body<br>
frame; a fuel tank supported by the body frame; and a fuel<br>
gauge having an arm that pivotally supports a float rising<br><br>
- 15 -<br><br>
and falling depending on the amount of fuel in the fuel tank.<br>
	The fuel tank is disposed such that the front right part and<br>
the front left part of the bottom are located in positions<br>
lower than the front central part, the uppermost part of the<br>
upper surface is located in a position higher than the front<br>
of the bottom, and the rear central part of the bottom is located<br>
in a position lower than line front central part. The fuel<br>
gauge is disposed in the rear central part of the bottom in<br>
the fuel tank such that the float rises and falls above the<br>
front right part or the front left part.<br>
	With such a structure, the front left and right parts<br>
projecting downward and the uppermost part are provided at<br>
the front of the fuel tank, a sufficient height can be provided<br>
without increasing the outside dimensions of the fuel tank.<br>
Since the fuel gauge is disposed in the rear center lower<br>
than the bottom-front central part, the fuel gauge Ceii be disposed<br>
without increasing the outside dimensions of the fuel tank.<br>
Since the fuel gauge is disposed so that the float rises and<br>
falls at the front left and right parts in the fuel tank, where<br>
a sufficient downward height can be provided, a large pivot<br>
angle of the arm can be provided, allowing accurate fuel<br>
measurement without increasing the outside dimensions of the<br>
fuel tank.<br>
	The vehicle according to the invention may have a structure<br>
in which the fuel tank is disposed such that the reer central<br><br>
- 16 -<br><br><br>
part is located in a position higher than the lowermost of<br>
at least one of the front right part and the front left part.<br>
	With such a structure, the fuel tank is disposed such<br>
that the rear central part is located in a position higher<br>
than the lowermost of at least one of the front right part<br>
and the front left part. This increases the pivot angle of<br>
the arm, allowing accurate fuel measurement without increasing<br>
the outside dimensions of the fuel tank.<br>
	The vehicle according to the invention preferably may<br>
have a structure in which the fuel gauge is disposed at the<br>
rear central part such that the pivot shaft of the arm is inclined<br>
backward relative to the width of the vehicle in plan view.<br>
	With such a structure, the fuel gauge is disposed at the<br>
rear central part such that the pivot shaft of the arm is inclined<br>
backward relative to the width of the vehicle in plan view.<br>
	Thus, the float moves close to the center when rising or falling,<br>
increasing the pivot angle of the arm to allow accurate fuel<br>
measurement without increasing the outside dimensions of the<br>
upper or lower part of the fuel tank.<br>
	Preferably, the vehicle according to the invention further<br>
includes a fuel pump disposed in the rear central part of the<br>
bottom in the fuel tank. The fuel gauge may be disposed on<br>
the side of the fuel pump. The fuel gauge and the fuel pump<br>
may be united to one.<br>
	With such a structure, the vehicle further includes a<br><br>
- 17 -<br><br>
fuel pump disposed in the rear central part of the bottom in<br>
the fuel tank. The fuel gauge is disposed on the side of the<br>
fuel pump. The fuel gauge and the fuel pump are united to<br>
one. Thus, the pivot shaft can be disposed in a desired position<br>
without increasing the outside dimensions of the fuel tank<br>
and with a simple structure, allowing accurate fuel measurement.<br>
	The vehicle according to the invention may have a structure<br>
in which the fuel pump is disposed such that the length is<br>
substantially along the vertical direction in the fuel tank.<br>
	This structure can lower the upper surface of the rear<br>
of the fuel tank than the front, allowing the rear of the fuel<br>
tank to be shaped to the riding position of the rider to improve<br>
rider comfort.<br>
	The vehicle according to the invention is capable of<br>
accurate fuel measurement without increasing the outside<br>
dimensions of the fuel tank, and in particular, it is useful<br>
for motorcycles and so forth whose frame is disposed in the<br>
center of the breadth of the body.<br>
