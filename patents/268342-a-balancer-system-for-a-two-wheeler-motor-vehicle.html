				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>^This invention relates to a balancer system for a two wheeler motor vehicle.<br>
Two wheeler motor vehicles, such as, motorcycles and scooters are unstable at low speeds, because speed is one of important factors influencing the balance of the rider. Thus, whenever the rider on a motorcycle or scooter has to slow down in traffic or for any other reason, there is a tendency for the vehicle to wobble and this situation is sought to be countered by the rider by rapidly turning the handle; bar of the vehicle from side to side for retaining his balance on the vehicle. Such a situation also distracts the rider from surrounding traffic conditions, inasmuch as his attention will be riveted on retaining balance in the midst of traffic snarls, rendering his life and limb in danger.<br>
This invention therefore proposes a balancer system which obviates the possibility of the rider losing balance or even overturning of the vehicle in conditions such as those outlined above.<br>
"" The balancer system proposed herein has the advantage that it goes into operation automatically without any volition on the part of the rider. In other words, whenever an unstable equilibrium situation arises, and the vehicle leans to one side or the other the balancer system goes into operation straightaway without the rider's intervention, steadying the vehicle; and whenever the situation comes back to normal, the system is ready to go into operation once again, if need be, leaving the rider tension-free to fully concentrate on the traffic<br>
The balancer system proposed herein is detachably attachable to the vehicle at any convenient point on its undercarriage. One of the regions of attachment will be the centre stand of the vehicle.<br>
Whenever, the need to use the balancer system does not arise, it can be detached from the vehicle and stowed away. Later on, it can be re-attached to the vehicle, if required, by a simple procedure of<br>
tightening nuts on bolts which can be taken up by | the average layman with an ordinary spanner.<br>
This invention thus ensures that it is user-friendly in installation on the vehicle, in its operation, and during its detachment from the vehicle.<br>
Various other features of this invention will be apparent from its further description to follow.<br>
The balancer system for a two wheeler motor vehicle, according to this invention, comprises a set of two wheels respectively attachable to, and detachable from, the two opposed sides of the undercarriage of the vehicle, such that the said wheels, in their attached state, with the vehicle in its upright position, are located just above, and out of contact with, the ground, on both sides of the vehicle, and such that the said attached wheels, with the vehicle in an inclined position, are located with one of said wheels alone in contact with the ground, op the downwardly inclined side of the vehicle, to lend the requisite support for maintaining balance.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example, and not by way of limitation, one of various embodiments of the balancer system proposed herein,<br>
Fig. 1 illustrating the known scooter<br>
Fig. 2 illustrating a side view of the known scooter<br>
fitted with the embodiment<br>
Fig. 3 illustrating a rear view of the embodiment<br>
illustrated in Fig.2<br>
Fig. 4 illustrating a closeup view of. a part of the embodiment attached to the centre stand. Fig.5 illustrating the attachment of the wheels at the sides of the undercarriage of the embodiment Fig. 6 illustrating the embodiment in an inclined position with one of the wheels touching the ground for providing balance<br>
A set of two wheels W1 and W2 are respectively attachable to, and detachable from, the two opposed sides of the undercarriage of the vehicle, such that the said wheels, in their attached state, are located just above, and out of contact with, the ground, on both<br>
sides of the vehicle, leaving a gap G, whenever the ^vehicle is in its upright position. The wheels, for instance, are attachable to the centre stand C (which is part of the undercarriage) of the vehicle as illustrated in Fig. 4 so that whenever the vehicle is ON STAND the wheels are raised completely off the ground, there being no use then for them; and so that whenever the vehicle is OFF STAND the wheels are located, and become operative, as already described above. One of various alternative arrangements for attaching the wheels is illustrated in Fig.5 wherein the wheels are shown to be attached to the sides of the undercarriage of the vehicle at T.<br>
Now, whenever the vehicle, at a low speed, tends to lose balance and leans to one side (Fig. 6), that is, tends to occupy an inclined position, one of the wheels alone (in this case Wl) comes into contact with the ground, on the downwardly inclined side of the vehicle, to lend the requisite support for maintaining balance. Under such conditions, the other wheel W2 gets automatically raised above the ground, leaving a gap H between the said wheel W2 and the ground,<br>
said gap being of size bigger than the gap G. Similar conditions, mutatis mutandis, apply when the vehicle is inclined downwards on its other side.<br>
It will be appreciated from the foregoing that various other embodiments of the balancer system proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
. A balancer system for a two wheeler motor vehicle, comprising a set of two wheels respectively attachable to, and detachable from, the two opposed sides of Ihe undercarriage of the vehicle, such that the said wheels, in their attached state, with the vehicle in its upright position, are located just above, and out of contact with, the ground, on both sides of the vehicle, and such that the said attached wheels, with the vehicle in an inclined position, are located with one of said wheels alone in contact with the ground, on the downwardly inclined side of the vehicle, to lend the requisite support for maintaining balance.<br>
2.	A balancer system as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the two wheels are respectively attachable to, and detachable from, the sides of the undercarriage of the vehicle.<br>
3.	A balancer system as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the two wheels are respectively attachable to, and detachable from, the centre stand of the vehicle.<br>
4.A balancer system for a two wheeler motor vehicle substantially as herein described with reference to, and as illustrated in, the accompanying drawings.<br></td>
