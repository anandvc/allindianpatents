				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to polymer exfoliated phyllosilicate nanocomposites compositions and process for preparation thereof. More particularly it relates to polymer-exfoliated phyllosilicate nanocomposite compositions, comprising: (a) a matrix polymer; (b) a phyllosilicate selected from the group consisting of hydrophilic synthetic phyllosiiicates and natural phyllosilicates, wherein the phyllosilicate has a surface; and (c) a modifier, an alkylonium ion with reactive moiety associated with the surface of the phyllosilicate and capable of compatiblize or covalently link to the matrix polymer chains. The phyllosilicate is substantially homogeneously dispersed and/or exfoliated throughout the polymer matrix as nanosized particles and the alkylonium ion is substantially covalently linked to the matrix polymer chains.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Nanocomposites are defined as the particle filled composites of which the particle should have atleast one dimension in the nanometer range. Phyllosilicates when dispersed in the polymer matrix will have a plate like structure in which the thickness of the plate is one nanometre. These nanocomposites are ideally classified into conventional composites, intercalated nanocomposites, intercalated-flocculated nanocomposites and exfoliated nanocomposites.<br>
It is known that organophilic phyllosilicates prepared, for example, by ion exchange, can be used as fillers for thermoplastic materials and also for thermosets, giving nanocomposites. When suitable organophilic phyllosilicates are used as fillers, the physical and mechanical properties of the moldings thus produced are considerably improved. A particular interesting feature is the increase in stiffness with no decrease in toughness. Nanocomposites, which comprise the phyllosilicate in exfoliated form, have particularly good properties.<br>
Nanocomposites have been demonstrated to produce dramatic improvements in mechanical properties, heat resistance, thermal stability, and<br>
reduced gas permeability of the base polymer without loss of impact strength. Due to their enhanced barrier properties and clarity, nanocomposites are well suited for use as gas transport barriers in packaging applications. Examples include nylon-based nanocomposites for food and beverage packaging, which incorporate the nanocomposite layer within single or multi-layer films. Reduction in gas diffusion is attributed to the presence of the clay particles, which act to increase diffusion path length.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,810,734 has disclosed that phyllosilicates can be treated with a quaternary or other ammonium salt of a primary, secondary or tertiary linear organic amine in the presence of a dispersing medium. During this there is ion exchange or cation exchange, where the cation of the ammonium salt becomes embedded into the space between the layers of the phyllosilicate. The organic radical of the absorbed amine makes phyllosilicates modified in this way organophilic. When this organic radical comprises functional groups the organophilic phyllosilicate is able to enter into chemical bonding with a suitable monomer or polymer.<br>
There are many examples in the patent literature of polymer/clay nanocomposites prepared from monomers and treated clays. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,739,007 discloses the preparation of Nylon-6/clay nanocomposites from caprolactam and alkyl ammonium-treated montmorillonite.<br>
However the above-mentioned phyllosilicates which are modified with alkylammonium cations undergo degradation at the temperatures above 250 °C as illustrated in the published literature, Xie et. al., Chemistry of Materials, 2001 13, 2979 -2990, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein. The decomposition of these modifiers during the preparation of nanocomposites or during processing leads to degradation of the polymers by chain scission reactions, color formation etc. The formation of decomposition products can lead to emissions and to impairment of mechanical properties, for example impact strength. For the preparation of polymer/clay nanocomposites wherein the polymer resins such as polycarbonates, polyethylene terepthalate, or any other polymer whose   processing   temperatures  are  above  the  250   °C,   requires<br>
treatment with modifiers, which are thermally stable. The use of thermally stable modifiers based on cyclic amidinium ions is disclosed in the US. Pat. Nos. 5530052, 5707439, 6197849, 20040033392A1, the disclosure of which are incorporated by reference herein. The use of thermally stable modifiers based on phosphonium ions is disclosed in US. Pat. Nos. 6057035, 6287992, 6262162, 6359052, the disclosure of which are incorporated by reference herein. However the dispersion of layered phyllosilicates, which are modified with such amidinium or phosphonium based surfactants, in the polymer resin was poor and always resulted in intercalated nanocomposites wherein the clay platelets are still remain intact and polymer chains have intercalated in between the clay gallery and increase the interlayer distance. Polycarbonate nanocomposites, as disclosed in US. Pat. Nos. 2004/0030021 A1, have resulted in only intercalated nanocomposites and sometimes decrease in interlayer distance for the phyllosilicate due to deintercalation of the modifier itself. It is shown that maximum improvement in the properties can be exploited only when the platelets are completely delaminated/exfoliated in the polymer resin matrix. It is also shown that when the modifier is capable of anchoring the polymer chains will enhance interaction of the polymer resin with the phyllosilicate layered platelets and under suitable process in making the nanocomposite result in fully exfoliated nanocomposites.<br>
Objectives of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide nanocomposite compositions in which the intercalated layered material (organophyllosilicate) is completely dispersed or exfoliated into the matrix polymer.<br>

In an embodiment of the present invention, the process for the preparation of polymer -exfoliated phyllosilicate nanocomposite compositions involves preparation by contacting, and thereby intercalating, a layered silicate material, e.g., a phyllosilicate, such as a smectite clay, with an alkylonium ion having atleast one reactive moiety and co-intercalation of the layered material with a co-intercalant (as co-intercalant polymerizable reactants, or as the oligomer co-intercalant or polymer co-intercalant) to form nanocomposite materials.

The layered material then filtered and can be washed with suitable solvent to remove the excess alkylonium ion having the reactive moiety and the displaced metal ions. It is then dried thoroughly prior to the incorporation of the co-intercalating polymer or polymerizable oligomer or monomers. The resulting alkylonium ion having reactive moiety intercalated layered material is sufficiently organophilic and are capable of covalently linking the matrix polymer chains during in-situ polymerization while dispersing the layered material in the polymer matrix.<br>

31)A nanocomposite composition as claimed in claim 31, wherein the layered silicate material used is first intercalated with alkylonium ions having reactive moiety prior to intercalating the layered material with the polymer of bisphenol and diphenylcarbonate.<br>
32) A process for the preparation of polymer-phyllosilicate nanocomposite composition comprising<br>
(a)    10-99.95 % by weight of a matrix polymer and<br><br>
intercalated layered silicate material with a solution or dispersion of an oligomer or polymer to intercalate the oligomer or polymer between the adjacent layers of the said layered silicate material to expand the spacing between the adjacent layers by at least an additional 3 A and mixing the layered silicate material, having said alkylonium ions having reactive moiety and said oligomer or polymer intercalated between adjacent layers and/or exfoliated, with an oligomer or polymer matrix material.<br>
36)The process of claim 40, wherein the oligomer or polymer intercalated between adjacent layers of said layered silicate material or exfoliated is the same oligomer or polymer matrix material mixed with said intercalate.<br>
37)A polymer-phyllosilicate nanocomposite composition and a process for the preparation thereof substantially as herein described with reference to the examples.</td>
