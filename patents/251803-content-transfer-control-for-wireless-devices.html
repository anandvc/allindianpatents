CONTENT TRANSFER CONTROL FOR WIRELESS<br>
DEVICES<br>
Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. §119<br>
[0001] The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application No. 60/684,660 entitled "CONTENT TRANSFER CONTROL FOR WIRELESS DEVICES" filed May 25, 2005, and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Field <br>
[0002]   The disclosed embodiments relate to content transfer control for wireless<br>
devices.<br>
Background <br>
[0003] Advances in technology have resulted in smaller and more powerful personal computing devices. For example, there currently exist a variety of portable personal computing devices, including wireless computing devices, such as portable wireless telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and paging devices that are each small, lightweight, and can be easily carried by users. More specifically, the portable wireless telephones, for example, further include cellular telephones that communicate voice and data packets over wireless networks. Further, many such cellular telephones are being manufactured with relatively large increases in computing capabilities, and as such, are becoming tantamount to small personal computers and hand-held PDAs. However, these smaller and more powerful personal computing devices are typically severely resource constrained. For example, the screen size, amount of available memory and file system space, amount of input and output capabilities and processing capability may each be limited by the small size of the device. Because of such severe resource constraints, it is often typically desirable, for example, to maintain a limited size and quantity of software applications and other information residing on such remote personal computing devices (client devices).<br>
[0004] FIG. 1 depicts a high level communication architecture for wireless devices in which wireless devices 100, 102 are connected to a wireless network 104 and a server 108 by way of the communication network. Server 108 stores content 110 in a storage medium (not shown), e.g., hard disk, memory, floppy disk, or other storage mechanism. Content 110 includes, for example, audio and video files, text files, application files,<br><br>
WO 2006/128077	 	PCT/US2006/020638<br>
address book contents, etc., for transfer between server 108 and wireless device 100 or between wireless devices 100, 102. Wireless device 100 stores content 112 which may be content 110 obtained from server 108 via wireless network 104 or content (not shown) transferred to the wireless device by a user of the wireless device using a wired, e.g., cable connection, or wireless, e.g., infra-red protocol, Bluetooth wireless protocol, WiFi protocol, etc. connection to a processing device such as a computer system (not shown). For example, the user may transfer audio files from a home computer system to the wireless device.<br>
[0005] FIG. 2 depicts a message sequence chart of operation of the transfer of content 110 from server 108 to wireless device 100. Wireless device 100 establishes a network connection (message sequence 200) with wireless network 104. After establishment of the network connection, wireless device 100 requests content 110 from server 108 (message sequence 202) by issuing a content request message. Responsive to receipt of the content request message from wireless device 100, server 108 transmits (message sequence 204) content 110 to wireless device 100 using network 104. After receipt of content 110, wireless device 100 may store the content in a storage medium (not shown) of the wireless device for later use.<br>
[0006] If content transfer controls are not in place on wireless device 100, content transferred to wireless device 100, whether from server 108 or a computer system of the user (not shown), may be transferred to other wireless devices, such as wireless device 102, without regard for any potential licensing issues. For example, content 110 may be a purchased audio file with terms restricting further distribution or use beyond wireless device 100.<br>
Summary <br>
[0007]   The present embodiments provide content transfer control for wireless devices. [0008]   A content transfer control system for a wireless device includes a content transfer control component arranged to (a) detect licensed content and (b) transfer a content source indicating a source of the licensed content responsive to detection of licensed content.<br>
[0009] A method embodiment includes transmitting content from the wireless device if the content is not determined to be licensed content and transmitting a content source from the wireless device if the content is determined to be licensed content.<br><br>

Detailed Description <br>
[0012] FIG. 3 depicts an embodiment for controlling content transfer between wireless devices 300, 302 connected to a wireless network 304, e.g., a code division multiple access (CDMA) network, a general packet radio service (GPRS) network, a universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) network, or other network. As depicted, wireless device 300 includes a content transfer control (CTC) application 306 used to obtain content 308 from server 310, e.g., purchase ring-tones, songs, or other audio, video, mixed media, or other content files, via wireless network 304. After obtaining content 308, execution of CTC application 306 by wireless device 300 enables control of the transfer of the content to other wireless devices, e.g., wireless device 302. <br>
[0013] According to an embodiment, the CTC application 306 provides a mechanism for controlling communication of content 308 between wireless devices 300, 302 using wireless network 304. In particular, the present embodiments enable wireless devices 300, 302 to set up CTC application-controlled communication transfers to exchange content, e.g., audio, text, video, and other content.<br>
[0014] A CTC application 306, i.e., a set of executable instructions, resident on each wireless device 300, 302, is executable to effect control of the exchange of content 308 between wireless devices 300, 302. As depicted, communication of content 308 between wireless devices 300, 302 occurs under control of CTC application 306. Further, as depicted, wireless device 302 may include content 308 (dash-dot line) for communication to wireless device 300.<br>
[0015] Execution of CTC application 306, described more fully below in conjunction with FIGs. 4A, 4B, and 5, by wireless device 300 causes the creation of a content container 312 corresponding to the combination of content 308 and a CTC application-generated header 314. In an embodiment, CTC application 306 generates a header 314 for each content 308 obtained from server 310. ■ In another embodiment, CTC application 306 generates a header 314 for each instance of content 308 without regard for the origination of the content, e.g., whether or not the content is obtained from server 310, a user computer system, or other mechanism. In another embodiment, content container 312 is encrypted and signed.<br>
[0016] Header 314 includes a license identifier (ED) 316 specifying one or more of different license types applicable to content 308, a content source 318 specifying a location on wireless network 304 of the content associated with the header, and an optional content ID 320 (dotted line) specifying an identifier, e.g., an International<br><br>
WO 2006/128077	 	PCT/US2006/020638<br>
Standard Book Numbering (ISBN) value, an International Standard Music Number (ISMN) value, an European Article Numbering (EAN) value, etc., identifying the content. License ID 316 may be an alphanumeric, numeric, alphabetic, or other representation of the license type applicable.<br>
[0017] Subsequent to creation of header 314, a user causes execution of CTC application 306 by wireless device 300 to transfer content 308 to wireless device 302 via wireless network 304. In another embodiment, direct communication between wireless devices 300, 302 is contemplated. For example, a peer-to-peer communication mechanism, such as an infra-red, WiFi, Bluetooth, or other wireless device-to-wireless device server-less communication mechanism may be used.<br>
[0018] Prior to transferring content 308, CTC application 306 determines whether license ID 316 of header 314 associated with content 308 permits transfer of content 308 to wireless device 302. If license ID 316 allows transfer of content 308, CTC application 306 enables the transfer of the content from wireless device 300 to wireless device 302. Conversely, if license ID 316 restricts transfer of content. 308, CTC application 306 disables the transfer of the content between wireless devices 300, 302. Further, if the transfer of content 308 between wireless devices 300, 302 is restricted, CTC application 306 enables the transfer of content source 318 between wireless devices 300, 302 instead of content 308. In this manner, wireless devices 300, 302 are prevented from transferring license-restricted content 308; however, wireless device 302 is provided information, i.e., content source 318, enabling the wireless device to connect to server 310 and obtain licensed content 308.<br>
[0019] For example, wireless device 302 receiving content source 318 from wireless device 300 enables the user of the receiving wireless device to navigate to server 310 to obtain the licensed content, e.g., by purchasing and transferring content 308 from server 310 to wireless device 302. In another embodiment, if the transfer of content 308 between wireless devices 300, 302 is restricted, CTC application 306 enables the transfer of header 314 between wireless devices 300, 302.<br>
[0020] In an embodiment, if no header 314 corresponds to content 308, CTC application 306 enables the transfer of the content between wireless devices 300, 302. In another embodiment, if no header 314 corresponds to content 308, CTC application 306 disables the transfer of the content between wireless devices 300, 302. <br>
[0021] In another embodiment, content ID 320 enables the wireless devices 300, 302 to perform a search, e.g., using a search engine on server 310, to locate a lower cost<br><br>
WO 2006/128077	 	PCT/US2006/020638<br>
source of content 308. That is, wireless device 302 may be used to shop for content 308 on other servers (not shown) accessible via wireless network 304. In this manner, a user of wireless device 300 is able to more easily search for content using content ID 320. [0022] FIG. 4A depicts operation of the FIG. 3 embodiment in the form of a message sequence diagram. Originating wireless device 300 establishes a network connection (message sequence 400). After establishment of the network connection, wireless device 300 requests content 308 from server 310 (message sequence 401) by issuing a content request message. Responsive to receipt of the content request message from wireless device 300, server 310 transmits (message sequence 402) content 308 to wireless device 300 using network 304. After receipt of content 308, wireless device 300 may store the content in a storage medium (not shown) of the wireless device for later use.<br>
[0023] Wireless device 302 establishes a network connection (message sequence 403). When the user of wireless device 300 desires to transfer content 308 to wireless device 302, the user manipulates the wireless device causing the execution of CTC application 306. Execution of CTC application 306 by wireless device 300 causes the CTC application to determine, based on license ID 316 in header 314 corresponding to content 308, if content 308 is able to be transferred between wireless devices 300, 302. After CTC application 306 determines content 308 is able to be transferred between wireless devices 300, 302, wireless device 300 transfers content 308 to wireless device 302 (message sequence 404). In another embodiment, CTC application 306 determines, based on the absence of a corresponding header 314 or license ID 316 corresponding to content 308 that the content is able to be transferred between wireless devices 300, 302. In an alternate embodiment, CTC application 306 determines, based on the absence of a corresponding header 314 or license ID 316 corresponding to content 308, that the content is restricted from being able to be transferred between wireless devices 300, 302.<br>
[0024] FIG. 4B depicts operation of the FIG. 3 embodiment in the form of a message sequence diagram. Originating wireless device 300 establishes a network connection (message sequence 400). After establishment of the network connection, wireless device 300 requests content 308 from server 310 (message sequence 401) by issuing a content request message. Responsive to receipt of the content request message from wireless device 300, server 310 transmits (message sequence 402) content 308 to wireless device 300 using network 304.  In this case, content 308 is licensed such that<br><br>
WO 2006/128077	 	PCT/US2006/020638<br>
the content is restricted from being able to be transferred to other wireless devices, e.g., wireless device 302. After receipt of content 308, wireless device 300 may store the content in a content container 312 in storage medium (not shown) of the wireless device for later use. In storing content 308, CTC application 306 generates a header 314 corresponding to the content and specifying the license restrictions specified by server 310.<br>
[0025] Wireless device 302 establishes a network connection (message sequence 403). When the user of wireless device 300 desires to transfer content 308 to wireless device 302, the user manipulates the wireless device causing the execution of CTC application 306. Execution of CTC application 306 by wireless device 300 causes the CTC application to determine, based on license ID 316 in header 314 corresponding to content 308, if content 308 is able to be transferred between wireless devices 300, 302. After CTC application 306 determines content 308 is restricted from being transferred between wireless device 300, 302, wireless device 300 transfers content source 318 from header 314 corresponding to content 308 to wireless device 302 (message sequence 406).<br>
[0026] After receipt of content source 318, wireless device 302 is able to issue a content request (message sequence 407) to server 310 requesting content 308 identified by content source 318. After receipt of the content request from wireless device 302, server 310 transfers (message sequence 408) content 308 to wireless device 302. <br>
[0027] FIG. 5 depicts a high level functional flow chart of a portion 500 of the process flow of operation of wireless device 300 in accordance with the FIG. 3 embodiment. As depicted in FIG. 5, wireless device 300 process flow begins operation in an idle state 502. After wireless device 300 receipt of content 308 from server 310, the flow transitions to generate header step 504. During step 504, execution of CTC application 306 by wireless device 300 generates a header 314 including license ID 316, content source 318, and optional content ID 320 as depicted in FIG. 3. License ID 316 is received from server 310 and content source 318 is specified based on the location of content 308 on server 310. After generating header 314, wireless device 300 stores the generated header along with received content 308 and the process flow transitions back to the idle step 502.<br>
[0028] After wireless device 300 is manipulated to attempt to transfer content 308 to wireless device 302 by the user of the device, the flow transitions to step 506. During step 506, execution of CTC application 306 by wireless device 300 causes the CTC<br><br>
WO 2006/128077	 	PCT/US2006/020638<br>
application to determine based on header 314, and more specifically license ID 316, the restrictions associated with content 308. If in step 506 CTC application 306 determines based on license ID 316 that transfer of content 308 is licensed, the flow transitions to step 508 and transfer of the content is enabled from wireless device 300 to wireless device 302. After content 308 transfers between wireless devices 300, 302, the flow transitions back to idle step 502. In another embodiment, if there is no license 316 corresponding to content 308, the determination at step 506 results in a licensed transfer determination, i.e., the flow transitions to step 508.<br>
[0029] If in step 506 CTC application 306 determines that transfer of content 308 is not licensed, the flow transitions to step 510 and transfer of content is disabled and transfer of content source 318 is enabled between wireless devices 300, 302. It will be understood that in different embodiments different sequences of steps and 'transitions may be used to accomplish the embodiments described above. For example, determination of licensed or unlicensed content 308 in step 506 may entail decryption and/or signature verification performed by CTC application 306 or other supporting executable instructions executed by wireless device 300.<br>
[0030] Further, in other embodiments, the presence or absence of license ID 316 indicates whether or not content 308 is licensed for the step 506 determination. <br>
[0031] Further, although the foregoing discussion describes the transfer of content 308 from an origination wireless device to a destination wireless device, the transfer direction may, in one or more embodiments, occur in the other direction and/or bi-directionally. That is, destination wireless device 302 may connect to and transfer content 308 to originating wireless device 300 and/or the wireless devices 300, 302 may transfer content to each other. Further still, in one or more embodiments, the origination wireless device may transfer content 308 to a network 304 connected computing device, e.g., a personal desktop or laptop computer, server, etc. <br>
[0032] Some of the personal computing devices utilize application programming interfaces (APIs), sometimes referred to as runtime environments and software platforms, that are installed onto their local computer platform and which are used, for example, to simplify operations of such devices, such as by providing generalized calls for device specific resources. Further, some such APIs are also known to provide software developers the ability to create software applications that are fully executable on such devices. In addition, some of such APIs are known to be operationally located between the computing device system software and the software applications such that<br><br>
WO 2006/128077	 	PCT/US2006/020638<br>
the computing device computing functionality is made available to the software applications without requiring the software developer to have the specific computing device system source code. Further, some APIs are known to provide mechanisms for secure communications between such personal devices (i.e., clients) and remote devices (i.e., servers) using secure cryptographic information.<br>
[0033] Examples of such APIs, some of which are discussed in more detail below, include versions of the Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless® (BREW®) developed by Qualcomm, Inc., of San Diego, California. BREW® is sometimes described as a thin veneer existing over a computing device's (typically a wireless cellular phone) operating system, which, among other features, provides interfaces to hardware features particularly found on personal computing devices. BREW® is further characterized by, at least, the one advantage of being able to be provided on such personal computing devices at a relatively low cost with respect to demands on such device resources and with respect to the price paid by consumers for devices containing the BREW ® API. Other features known to be associated with BREW ® include its end-to-end software distribution platform that provides a variety of benefits for wireless service operators, software developers and computing device consumers. At least one such currently available end-to-end software distribution platform includes logic distributed over a server-client architecture, where the server performs, for example, billing, security and application distribution functionality, and the client performs, for example, application execution, security and user interface functionality. <br>
[0034] One or more embodiments are used in conjunction with a runtime environment (API) executing on the computing device. One such runtime environment (API) is Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless® (BREW®) software previously discussed. However, one or more of the described embodiments can be used with other types of runtime environments (APIs) that, for example, operate to control the execution of applications on wireless client computing devices.<br>
[0035] FIG. 6 illustrates a block diagram of one exemplary embodiment of a wireless system 600. System 600 can contain client devices, such as a cellular telephone, e.g., wireless device 300, in communication across a wireless network 304 with at least one application download server 606 that selectively transmits software applications and components to wireless devices, such as wireless devices 300, 302, across a wireless communication portal or other data access to the wireless network 304. As shown here, the wireless (client) device can be a cellular telephone, e.g., wireless device 300, a<br><br>

personal digital assistant 608, a pager 610, which is shown here as a two-way text pager, or even a separate computer platform 612 that has a wireless communication portal. For example, wireless device 300 includes a transceiver or communication device for transmitting and receiving data, a processor for executing instructions and controlling operation of the wireless device, and a memory for storing the executable instructions, content container 312, and content 308 (FIG. 3). The embodiments can thus be realized on any form of client device including a wireless communication portal, e.g., a communication device, including without limitation, wireless modems, PCMCIA cards, personal computers, access terminals, telephones, or any combination or subcombination thereof.<br>
[0036] The application download server 606 is shown here on a network 616 with other computer elements in communication with the wireless network 304. There can be a stand-alone server 622, and each server can provide separate services and processes to the client devices 300, 608, 610, 612 across the wireless network 304. System 600 may also include at least one stored application database 618 that holds the software applications, e.g., a content transfer control (CTC) application 306, that are downloadable by the wireless devices 300, 608, 610, 612 (the CTC application is indicated as being downloadable to the wireless devices by a dashed line). However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the configuration illustrated in Fig. 6 is merely exemplary. Accordingly, other embodiments can include one of more servers that can each perform all the described functions and contain all necessary hardware and software, or can contain only selected functionality.<br>
[0037] In FIG. 7, a block diagram is shown that more fully illustrates system 600, including the components of the wireless network 304 and interrelation of the elements of the exemplary embodiments. System 600 is merely exemplary and can include any system whereby remote client devices, such as wireless client computing devices 300, 608, 610, 612 communicate over-the-air between and among each other and/or between and among components connected via a wireless network 304, including, without limitation, wireless network carriers and/or servers. The application download server 606 and the stored application database 618 communicate with a carrier network 700, through a data link, such as the Internet, a secure LAN, WAN, or other network. Stored application database 618 includes a CTC application 306 according to the above-described embodiments for download to each of the wireless client computer devices 300, 608, 610, 612.  Wireless client computer devices 300, 608, 610, 612 download a<br><br>
WO 2006/128077	 	PCT/US2006/020638<br>
copy of CTC application 306 (dashed line) from stored applications database 618. In the embodiment shown, a server 620 can include the application download server 606, distribution server 622 and the stored application database 618. However, these servers can also be independent devices.<br>
[0038] Still referring to the embodiment of FIG. 7, carrier network 700 controls messages (generally being data packets) sent to a messaging service controller ("MSC") 702. Carrier network 700 communicates with the MSC 702 through another communications link, such as another network, the Internet, and/or POTS ("plain ordinary telephone system"). Typically, the network or Internet connection between carrier network 700 and MSC 702 transfers data, and the POTS transfers voice information. MSC 702 may be connected to multiple base stations ("BTS") 704, such as by at least one communications link, including both a data network and/or the Internet for data transfer and POTS for voice information. BTS 704 ultimately broadcasts messages wirelessly to the wireless communications devices, such as cellular telephones 602, in an over-the-air protocol such as short messaging service ("SMS"), etc.<br>
[0039] In the embodiment of FIG. 7, each wireless device 300 may include a computer platform 706 that can receive and execute software applications and display data transmitted from computer system 620 or other network servers 622. Computer platform 706 may include an application-specific integrated circuit ("ASIC") 708, or other chipset, processor, microprocessor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. ASIC 708 may be installed at the time of manufacture of wireless device 300. ASIC 708 or other processor may execute an application programming interface ("API") layer 710 that interfaces with any resident programs, e.g., CTC application 306, in a memory 712 of the wireless device. API 710 is a runtime environment executing on the computing device, or wireless device 300 in this case. One such runtime environment is Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless® (BREW®) software, although other runtime environments may be utilized that, for example, operate to control the execution of applications on wireless computing devices. Memory 712, for example, can be comprised of at least one of read-only and random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EPROM, EEPROM, flash cards, and any memory common to computer platforms. The computer platform 706 may also include a local database 714 that can hold the software applications, e.g., CTC application 306,content 308, content container 312, files, or data not actively used in memory 712. Local database 714 may include at least one of flash<br><br>
WO 2006/128077	 	PCT/US2006/020638<br>
memory cells, magnetic media, EPROM, EEPROM, optical media, tape, a soft disk, a hard disk, and any other type of secondary or tertiary memory. Thus, in the embodiment of FIG. 7, each wireless device 300 may be loaded with applications such as CTC application 306, content container 312, content 308, and/or data from computer system 620 in accordance with system 600.<br>
[0040] It will be readily seen by one of ordinary skill in the art that the disclosed embodiments fulfill one or more of the advantages set forth above. After reading the foregoing specification, one of ordinary skill will be able to affect various changes, substitutions of equivalents and various other embodiments as broadly disclosed herein. It is therefore intended that the protection granted hereon be limited only by the definition contained in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.<br><br>
