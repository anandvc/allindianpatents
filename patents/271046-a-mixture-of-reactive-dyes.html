Mixtures of reactive dyes and their use<br>
The present invention relates to mixtures of reactive dyes, which mixtures are suitable for dyeing or printing nitrogen-containing or hydroxyl-group-containing fibre materials and yield dyeings or prints having good all-round fastness properties.<br>
The practice of dyeing has recently led to higher demands being made on the quality of the dyeings and the economic efficiency of the dyeing process. As a result, there continues to be a need for novel, readily obtainable dyeing compositions having good properties, especially in respect of their application.<br>
Dyeing today requires reactive dyes that, for example, have sufficient substantivity and at the same time exhibit good ease of washing-off of unfixed dye. In addition, they should exhibit a good colour yield and a high reactivity, the objective being especially to provide dyeings having high degrees of fixing. In many cases, the build-up behaviour of reactive dyes is not sufficient to meet the demands, especially in the dyeing of very deep shades, so that it is necessary for the dyer to use combinations of suitable reactive dyes.<br>
The dye mixtures described in the prior art, such as, for example, in US 5 456 728,<br>
US 5 632 783 and US 5 704 951, still have certain disadvantages in respect of the required<br>
properties.<br>
The problem underlying the present invention is accordingly to provide novel mixtures of reactive dyes, which mixtures are especially suitable for dyeing and printing fibre materials and possess the above-described qualities to a high degree. They should also yield dyeings having good all-round fastness properties, for example fastness to light and to wetting.<br><br><br>

The dyes of formulae (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) are known or can be prepared according to<br>
methods known perse. Dyes of formula (1) are described, for example, in US 4 885 360 and<br>
GB 1 155 149. Dyes of formula (2) are disclosed, for example, in DE 960 534,<br>
DE 31 13 989 A1, EP 0 063 276 A2 and EP 0 122 600 A1. Dyes of formula (3) are known, for<br>
example, from US 3 558 621, US 4 631 341, US 4 754 023. GB 2 034 731 A and<br>
EP 0 064 250 A1. Dyes of formula (4) are described, for example, in US 4 336 190,<br>
US 4 754 023 and US 5 936 072. Dyes of formula (5) are known, for example, from<br>
US 5 451 665.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention can be prepared, for example, by mixing the individual dyes. Such a mixing process is carried out, for example, in suitable mills, for example ball mills or pin mills, and also in kneaders or mixers.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention may, where appropriate, comprise further auxiliaries that, for example, improve handling or increase storage stability, such as, for example, buffers, dispersants or anti-dusts. Such auxiliaries are known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention are suitable for dyeing and printing an extremely wide variety of materials, especially hydroxyl-group-containing or nitrogen-containing fibre materials. Examples are paper, silk, leather, wool, polyamide fibres and polyurethanes and also, especially, cellulose-containing fibre materials of all kinds. Such fibre materials are, for example, the natural cellulosic fibres, such as cotton, linen and hemp, and also cellulose and regenerated cellulose. The dye mixtures according to the invention are also suitable for dyeing or printing hydroxyl-group-containing fibres present in blend fabrics, e.g. mixtures of cotton with polyester fibres or polyamide fibres.<br><br>
The present invention accordingly relates also to the use of the dye mixtures according to the invention in the dyeing or printing of hydroxyl-group-containing or nitrogen-containing, especially cellulose-containing, fibre materials.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention can be applied to the fibre material and fixed to the fibre in a variety of ways, especially in the form of aqueous dye solutions and dye print pastes. They are suitable both for the exhaust method and for dyeing in accordance with the pad-dyeing method; they can be used at low dyeing temperatures and require only short steaming times in the pad-steam process. The build-up behaviour is very good, the degrees of fixing are high and unfixed dye can be washed off easily, the difference between the degree of exhaust and the degree of fixing being remarkably small, that is to say the soaping loss is very low. The dye mixtures according to the invention are also suitable for printing, especially on cotton, but are equally suitable also for printing nitrogen-containing fibres, for example wool or silk or blend fabrics that contain wool.<br>
The dyeings and prints produced using the dye mixtures according to the invention can be reproduced very well, have a high tinctorial strength and a high fibre-to-dye binding stability in both the acidic and the alkaline range, and furthermore have good fastness to light and very good wet-fastness properties, such as fastness to washing, to water, to sea water and to cross-dyeing and, especially, very good fastness to perspiration and to chlorine and nitrogen oxides. The dyeings obtained exhibit fibre levelness and surface levelness.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention are also suitable as colorants for use in recording systems. Such recording systems are, for example, commercially available Inkjet printers for paper or textile printing, or writing instruments, such as fountain pens or ballpoint pens and especially Inkjet printers. For that purpose, the dye mixture according to the invention is first brought into a form suitable for use in recording systems. A suitable form is, for example, an aqueous ink that comprises the dye mixture according to the invention as colorant. The inks can be prepared in customary manner by mixing together the individual constituents in the desired amount of water.<br>
Substrates that come into consideration include the above-mentioned hydroxyl-group-containing or nitrogen-containing fibre materials, especially cellulose-containing fibre materials.<br><br>
The dyes used in the aqueous inks should preferably have a low salt content, that is to say they should have a total content of salts of less than 0.5 % by weight, based on the weight of the dyes. Dyes that have relatively high salt contents as a result of their preparation and/or as a result of the subsequent addition of diluents can be desalted, for example, by membrane separation procedures, such as ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis or dialysis.<br>
The inks preferably have a total content of dyes of from 1 to 35 % by weight, especially from 1 to 30 % by weight and preferably from 1 to 20 % by weight, based on the total weight of the ink. The preferred lower limit in this case is a limit of 1.5 % by weight, preferably 2 % by weight and especially 3 % by weight.<br>
The inks may comprise water-miscible organic solvents, for example C1-C4alcohols, e.g. methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, sec-butanol, tert-butanol or iso-butanol; amides, e.g. dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide; ketones or ketone alcohols, e.g. acetone, diacetone alcohol; ethers, e.g. tetrahydrofuran or dioxane; nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, e.g. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone or 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidone, poly-alkylene glycols, e.g. polyethylene glycol or polypropylene glycol; C2-C6alkylene glycols and thioglycols. e.g. ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, triethylene glycol, thio-diglycol, hexylene glycol and diethylene glycol; other polyols, e.g. glycerol or 1.2,6-hexane-triol; and C1-C4alkyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols, e.g. 2-methoxyethanol, 2-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)ethanol, 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethanol, 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethanol or2-[2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethanol; preferably N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, diethylene glycol, glycerol or especially 1,2-propylene glycol, usually in an amount of from 2 to 30 % by weight, especially from 5 to 30 % by weight and preferably from 10 to 25 % by weight, based on the total weight of the ink.<br>
In addition, the inks may also comprise solubilisers, e.g. e-caprolactam.<br>
The inks may comprise thickeners of natural or synthetic origin inter alia for the purpose of adjusting the viscosity.<br>
Examples of thickeners that may be mentioned include commercially available alginate thickeners, starch ethers or locust bean flour ethers, especially sodium alginate on its own or   <br><br>
in admixture with modified cellulose, e.g. methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, methyl hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose or hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, especially with preferably from 20 to 25 % by weight carboxymethyl cellulose. Furthermore, synthetic thickeners that may be mentioned are, for example, those based on poly(meth)acrylic acids or poly(meth)acrylamides and also polyalkylene glycols having a molecular weight of e.g. from 2000 to 20 000, for example polyethylene glycol or polypropylene glycol or the mixed polyalkylene glycols of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide.<br>
The inks comprise such thickeners, for example, in an amount of from 0.01 to 2 % by weight, especially from 0.01 to 1 % by weight and preferably from 0,01 to 0.5 % by weight, based on the total weight of the ink.<br>
The inks may also comprise buffer substances, e.g. borax, borates, phosphates, polyphosphates or citrates. Examples that may be mentioned include borax, sodium borate, sodium tetraborate, sodium dihydrogeh phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium pentapolyphosphate and sodium citrate. They are used especially in amounts of from 0.1 to 3 % by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 1 % by weight, based on the total weight of the ink, in order to establish a pH value of, for example, from 4 to 9, especially from 5 to 8.5.<br>
As further additives, the inks may comprise surfactants or humectants.<br>
Suitable surfactants include commercially available anionic or non-ionic surfactants. As humectants in the inks according to the invention there come into consideration, for example, urea or a mixture of sodium lactate (advantageously in the form of a 50 % to 60 % aqueous solution) and glycerol and/or propylene glycol in amounts of preferably from 0.1 to 30 % by weight, especially from 2 to 30 % by weight.<br>
Preference is given to inks having a viscosity of from 1 to 40 mPa-s, especially from 1 to 20 mPas and more especially from 1 to 10 mPas.<br><br>
Furthermore, the inks may in addition comprise customary additives, e.g. anti-foams or especially preservatives that inhibit fungal and/or bacterial growth. Such additives are usually used in amounts of from 0.01 to 1 % by weight, based on the total weight of the ink.<br>
Preservatives that come into consideration include formaldehyde-yielding agents, e.g. paraformaldehyde and trioxane, especially aqueous, approximately 30 to 40 % by weight formaldehyde solutions, imidazole compounds, e.g. 2-(4-thiazolyl)benzimidazole, thiazole compounds, e.g. 1,2-benzisothia2olin-3-one or 2-n-octyMsothiazolin-3-one, iodine compounds, nitriles, phenols, haloalkylthio compounds and pyridine derivatives, especially 1,2-ben2isothiazolin-3-one or 2-n-octyl-isothiazolin-3-one. A suitable preservative is e.g. a 20 % by weight solution of 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one in dipropyjene glycol (Proxel® GXL).<br>
The inks may also comprise further additives, such as fluorinated polymers or telomers. e.g. polyethoxyperfluoroalcohols (Forafac® or Zonyl® products) in an amount of e.g. from 0.01 to 1 % by weight, based on the total weight of the ink.<br>
In Inkjet printing, individual droplets of the ink are sprayed onto a substrate in a controlled manner from a nozzle. For that purpose, predominantly the continuous Inkjet method and the drop-on-demand method are used. In the continuous Inkjet method, the droplets are produced continuously and any droplets not required for the printing are conveyed to a collecting vessel and recycled, whereas in the drop-on-demand method droplets are produced and printed as required, that is to say droplets are produced only when required for the printing. The production of the droplets can be effected, for example, by means of a piezo-inkjet head or by means of thermal energy (bubble jet). Printing by means of a piezo-inkjet head and printing in accordance with the continuous Inkjet method are preferred.<br>
