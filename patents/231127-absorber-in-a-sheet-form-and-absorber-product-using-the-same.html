DESCRIPTION ABSORBER IN A SHEET FORM AND ABSORBER PRODUCT USING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an absorbent product and more specifically to an absorbent sheet to be used in a urine pad, an incontinent product, a diaper and the like.<br>
Background Art<br>
Conventionally, as means for preventing leakage from the sides of an absorbent product of urine are known such methods as disposing gathers in a three-dimensional structure and folding back an absorbent body to form an anti-leakage wall.<br>
Said method for folding back an absorbent body is effective in that, as urine is absorbed, absorbent polymer contained inside swells and thus the absorbent body is made to stand up to make the firmness of the wall stronger. As the result that the swelling of the absorbent polymer, however, is in all directions, and thus does not stand up changing its shape in any one direction as desired, the standing up of the absorbent polymer is gradual and slow and in many cases urine may overflow before it is checked.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is securely to improve the effect of preventing the leakage of urine, in an absorbent body which may form a leakage prevention wall by standing up as absorbs liquid, by raising the speed of such portion of the absorbent body as forms the leakage prevention wall standing up.<br>
The present invention covers each of the following inventions:<br>
An absorbent sheet having concave and convex portions on its surface and spontaneously exhibiting a three-dimensional structure in that a concave-convex structure is formed wherein when the difference in level between the concave and the convex portion is A mm in a state where water is not absorbed (dry state) the difference in level between the concave and the convex portion becomes 2A or more after water is absorbed, due to the bulging in parts caused by absorption of<br><br>
water and resultant swelling.<br>
In a form of the present invention, a leakage prevention wall may be formed by an absorbent body, whereby in case the absorbent body is applied in an absorbent product, an elastic member for forming a leakage prevention system is no required unlike a conventional absorbent product.<br>
Preferred examples of the above-mentioned invention are given below:<br>
When said difference in level between the concave and the convex portion when no water is absorbed yet is A mm, said difference in level between the concave and the convex portion after water is absorbed becomes 3A mm or more. In the present form of the invention, a leakage prevention wall of a more preferred form may be formed than the form described above.<br>
Said difference in level between the concave and the convex portion when no water is absorbed yet is 0.2 mm~2.0 mm. In the present form of the invention, no feeling of physical disorder is caused by the concavity-convexity when worn.<br>
Said absorbent sheet comprises a P sheet forming an absorbent layer containing super absorbent polymer (SAP) on one side of its substrate sheet, and the content of said SAP inside said absorbent layer is 50 wt.%~ 95 wt.%. In the present form of the invention, a good function of spontaneously providing a three-dimensional structure may be provided for forming a leakage prevention wall.<br>
Said P sheet is 2.0 mm or less thick when no water is absorbed yet. In the present form of the invention, an extremely thin sheet may be obtained for forming a leakage prevention wall.<br>
On said P sheet are formed absorbent layers on either side of said substrate sheet formed in bands at given intervals. In the present form of the invention, an absorbent sheet may be obtained which may be well processed.<br>
On said P sheet a Q sheet is laminated for supporting and fixing said P sheet. In the present form of the invention, an absorbent sheet which is dimensionally stable may be obtained.<br>
Said P sheet and said Q sheet are bonded together intermittently at given<br><br>
intervals. In the present form of the invention, a sheet having such concave and convex portions as uniformly bulge by absorbing liquid and accordingly swelling may be obtained.<br>
The bonding spacing between said P sheet and said Q sheet is 5 mm or more. In the present form of the invention, an absorbent sheet which may be well processed and have concave and convex portions capable of forming a state where a firm stand-up is formed may be obtained.<br>
Said P sheet is bonded to said Q sheet at the portion where no absorbent layers are formed. In a mode of the present invention an absorbent sheet excellent in processability and having convex and concave portions forming a firm standing up condition may be obtained.<br>
Said concave and convex portions are formed by folding back said absorbent sheet. In the present form of the invention, a leakage prevention wall may be formed which stands up much due to the absorbent sheet being bent back by absorbing of liquid and accordingly swelling.<br>
Said concave and convex portions are formed by bonding to said Q sheet intermittently at given intervals while said P sheet is given some slackening. In the present form of the invention, an absorbent sheet having the concave and the convex portion which are more different in level between the two portions before and after liquid is absorbed may be obtained.<br>
Said P sheet is bonded to said Q sheet at the portion where no absorbent layers are formed, in a mode of the present invention an absorbent sheet excellent in processability and having convex and concave portions forming a firm standing up condition may be obtained.<br>
On to said P sheet a laminated structure is formed where an absorbent sheet with an absorbent layer formed containing said SAP on the surface of said absorbent substrate sheet is laminated at least in one layer and bonded intermittently to each other, and said P sheet and said Q sheet are bonded to each other intermittently. In the present form of the invention, an absorbent sheet having such concave and convex portions as are further more different in level<br><br>
before and after liquid is absorbed may be obtained.<br>
Said absorbent layer contains super absorbent polymer (SAP) and its bonding agent, i.e., microfibrillated cellulose (MFC). In the present form of the invention, an absorbent sheet where SAP hardly falls off may be obtained.<br>
Said substrate sheet of said P sheet comprises hydrophilic and water diffusive wood pulp, rayon-based non-woven fabric, cotton-based non-woven fabric, or at least one kind of non-woven fabrics made hydrophilic selected from a group consisting of polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate and polyvinyl alcohol fibers. In the present form of the invention, since the P sheet is hydrophilic and water diffusive, an absorbent sheet which is excellent in absorbency and diffusion may be obtained.<br>
Said Q sheet comprises at least one kind of hydrophobic non-woven fabrics selected from a group consisting of a spun bonded or a spun bonded/melt blown/spun bonded composite comprising polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate and polyvinyl alcohol fibers. In the present form of the invention, since the Q sheet is made of a flexible material, an absorbent sheet may be obtained which is apt to fit the body of a wearer.<br>
Said Q sheet comprises a film or an apertured film selected from a group consisting of polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate and polyvinyl alcohol types or a composite of any of such films with a non-woven fabric. In the present form of the invention, since the Q sheet is made of a rigid material, an absorbent sheet may be obtained which has a good tendency to stand up.<br>
In addition, the present invention is an absorbent product comprising a liquid permeable top sheet, a liquid impermeable leakage prevention sheet and an absorbent body for absorbing and retaining liquid as disposed between the sheets and having a guarding function against liquid on both side edges and/or on the flange ends of the front body and the back body, wherein said absorbent body comprises an absorbent sheet having either function of spontaneously becoming three-dimensional.   In the  present form  of the  invention,  since  a  leakage<br><br>
prevention wall may be formed by means of an absorbent body, no elastic member for forming a leakage prevention system is required unlike a conventional absorbent product and an absorbent product excellent in the leakage prevention effect on the side edges and the peripheral edge may be obtained.<br>
Preferred forms of the above-describe invention are given below:<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention An absorbent sheet according to the present invention has small concave and convex portions formed on the surface. These concave and convex portions are characterized in that they do not have differences in levels so large as to give rise to any uncomfortable feeling to a wearer before liquid is absorbed, but, once liquid is absorbed, such differences in level are made suddenly large as liquid is absorbed. Such differences in level are formed by using an absorbent sheet having an absorbent layer containing a lot of super absorbent polymer (SAP).<br>
An absorbent sheet according to the present invention involves an embodiment where, by virtue of concave and convex portions formed on the surface of the sheet, the convex portions are formed by folding the sheet and the fiat portions not as folded are made concave portions.<br><br>
In addition, another embodiment is involved where, for forming concave and convex portions, convex portions are formed by laminating another absorbent sheet onto an absorbent sheet and such portions where an absorbent sheet is not thus laminated are made concave portions.<br>
Furthermore, an embodiment is also contained where for making differences in level between concave and convex portions by causing an absorbent sheet to swell in much different degrees, two elements different in expansion coefficient are stuck together by means of which effects of some bending being caused in a given direction different by differences in deformation caused by liquid being absorbed.<br>
A fundamental principle underlying such structure of an absorbent sheet may be the same as a bimetal principle applied as an electric contact and a crimp generating principle as seen in a two component side by side fiber.<br>
In case an absorbent sheet having concave and convex portions according to the present invention is used to make an absorbent product, the absorbent sheet may be made to serve as a leakage preventing wall to prevent leakage from the side edges and peripheral edges of the absorbent product. Since the absorbent sheet functions as a leakage preventing wall, a three-dimensional gathers need not be formed using an elastic material as in a conventional absorbent product.<br>
An absorbent sheet according to the present invention is characterized in that, when the difference in level between concave and convex portions is made A mm with liquid yet to be absorbed (in a dry state), the difference in level between the concave and convex portions become 2A mm or more, preferably 3A mm or more, due to bulging in parts after liquid is absorbed when physiological saline (hereinafter "liquid is (or being) absorbed" meaning "physiological saline is (or being) absorbed" )is absorbed so that the absorbent sheet is expanded. Also, the difference (A) in level between the concave and convex portions before liquid is yet to be absorbed is preferably 0.2 mm ~ 2.0 mm. If such difference is less than 0,2 mm, the effect of the absorbent sheet as a leakage preventing wall becomes<br><br>
less than desired, and, on the other hand, if such difference in level is more than 2.0 mm, uncomfortable feeling is caused to a wearer due to the large difference in level.<br>
Furthermore, the thickness of an absorbent sheet before liquid is absorbed is preferably 2.0 mm or less. If such thickness becomes more than 2.0 mm, the concave and convex portions cannot appropriately be processed.<br>
An absorbent sheet according to the present invention is preferably made with two kinds of sheets different in expansion coefficient in water being stuck together in a not expanded state. In other words, by sticking together a P sheet of high expandability with an absorbent layer containing a high concentration of SAP formed on one side of a substrate sheet and a Q sheet holding and fixing said P sheet containing little or non SAP thereby a swelling and expanding function is provided inherent in SAP when water is absorbed so that a three-dimensional structure may be imparted to an absorbent sheet.<br>
In the present invention, said three-dimensional structure being imparted is called as a spontaneous three-dimensional structure being imparted since it is imparted spontaneously as accompanied by the water swelling phenomenon.<br>
The forms of such spontaneous three-dimensional structure depend much on the nature and shape of the P sheet, the nature and shape of the Q sheet to be bonded to the P sheet and the bonding state of both sheets.<br>
In an absorbent sheet according to the present invention, the forms of such spontaneous three-dimensional structure are classified into two groups as follows:<br>
In the first embodiment, P sheets and Q sheets are bonded together intermittently at certain intervals. In this embodiment, as a P sheet a substrate sheet is used where on the substrate sheet absorbent-layer-existent-regions and absorbent-layer-non-existent-regions are alternately formed to make the sheet flexible and easy to bond, and as a Q sheet, a sheet of no swelling and of dimensional stability is used, and an absorbent sheet is thus advantageously made where in the regions of no absorbent layer in existence of the P sheet, the P<br><br>
sheet is bonded to the Q sheet intermittently at certain intervals by means of such methods as thermal fusion.<br>
If such absorbent sheet is made to absorb water to be swollen, the water absorbing and swelling capacity is restricted to the bonding range and at the same time the sheet is made to bulge due to its ease to deform and by virtue of tonicity caused thereby the sheet is caused to be much three-dimensional.<br>
Also, a P sheet and a Q sheet are bonded at the interval of 5 mm or more, preferably, of 5 - 50 mm. If the bonding interval is less than 5 mm, the bonding interval becomes too narrow thereby its water absorbing and swelling capacity is impeded and thus the function of making a spontaneous three-dimensional structure becomes insufficient. On the other hand, the bonding interval gets wider, more than 50 mm, the bulging capacity caused by the water absorbing and swelling is dissipated so that a strong three-dimensional structure cannot be obtained.<br>
Furthermore, a P sheet and a Q sheet may be bonded not only as they are stuck together as extended but also, with the P sheet being molded as folded, slackened or channeled to be stuck together with the Q sheet, sufficient space for swelling is provided thereby even a small swelling capacity may make the sheet easier to be of three-dimensional structure.<br>
Also, by laminating at least one layer of a substrate sheet made water absorbent with an absorbent layer containing SAP formed on its surface to said P sheet thereby a laminated structure where both sheets are bonded in parts is formed in which said P sheet and said Q sheet are bonded to each other in parts so that the sheets are thus made to be easy to expand.<br>
A second embodiment of a spontaneous three-dimensional structure may be that a P sheet and a Q sheet are continuously bonded and folded in that the P sheet side is made to come inside so that such folded part is made a convex portion. In other words, an absorbent sheet deforms as warped toward a Q sheet even if a P sheet absorbs liquid to swell since the liquid absorbing and swelling capability of the Q sheet is small, and thus if beforehand the absorbent sheet is<br><br>
folded with the P sheet made to come inside, the absorbent sheet with the difference in level between the concave and convex portions which is small before liquid is absorbed may be made to provide a large leakage prevention wall with the folded portion getting warped as liquid being absorbed. In this case, if both sheets are bonded intermittently, the effect becomes low so that the sheets are preferably bonded continuously.<br>
Also, if as a P sheet a sheet with an absorbent-layer-existent-region and an absorbent-layer-non-existent-region formed alternately on a substrate sheet is used and the P sheet is folded in the absorbent-layer-non-existent-region, an absorbent sheet which can be processed appropriately may be obtained.<br>
The forms of folding an absorbent sheet may be such that the sheet is folded with its both side edge being made to come inside, or the sheet is folded with its both side edges being made to come inside and then is made to have a Z-shaped cross sectional form with the folded portion folded back midway.<br>
As a substrate sheet constituting a P sheet according to the present invention,<br>
a sheet may be used comprising wood pulp, rayon-based non-woven fabric, or<br>
cotton-based non-woven fabric, which is hydrophilic and diffusive. Also, spun<br>
bonded or spun bonded/melt blown/spun bonded composite non-woven fabric<br>
comprising	polyethylene-based,	polypropylene-based,<br>
polyethylene-terephthalate-based, polyvinyl-alcohol-based fibers may be used after they are treated to be hydrophilic.<br>
An absorbent layer constituting a P sheet contains preferably SAP of 50 wt%~95wt%. If the SAP content is less than 50wt%, a spontaneous three-dimensional structure may not be sufficiently obtained. If the SAP content is more than 95wt%, SAP may be likely to fall off so that an absorbent sheet cannot be appropriately processed.<br>
As the coating materials constituting an absorbent layer, such coating materials as contains SAP and microfibrillated fiber (MFC) as the bonding agent of SAP is preferable. For example, a P sheet formed by applying this type of coating to a non-woven fabric may be made extremely thin so that it may<br><br>
extremely easily be folded and laminated. Also, a P sheet may be used which is made with 2 or more layers laminated.<br>
A Q sheet which may be used for the present invention is a sheet containing little or no SAP. The Q sheet may be at least one type of hydrophobic non-woven fabrics selected from spun bonded and spun bonded/melt blown/spun bonded composites comprising polyethylene-based, polypropylene-based, polyethyiene-terephthalate-based, and polyvinyl-alcohol-based fibers. Furthermore, film or an apertured film or zygote of any such film and a non-woven fabric selected from polyethylene-based, polypropylene-based, poiyethylene-terephthalate-based, and polyvinyl-alcohol-based fibers.<br>
If as a material constituting a Q sheet such sheet material as is flexible and easy to deform is used, a Q sheet also deforms according to the deformation and bulging of a P sheet so that an absorbent sheet fitting the bodily contour of a wearer may be obtained. Also, if a sheet material which is dimensionally stable and rigid is used as a material constituting a Q sheet, an absorbent sheet obtained will not be fitting the bodily contour of a wearer although the deformation and bulging of a P sheet is likely to happen. In general, wrapping tissue for an absorbent body or a back sheet used in an absorbent product are advantageously used as a Q sheet, and an apertured film having a relatively high rigidity may be disposed as a Q sheet between a back sheet and a P sheet.<br>
A P sheet and a Q sheet may be bonded by thermal fusion such as a thermal seal, by adhesive bonding such as hot melt or by a polyethylene sheet disposed in between.<br>
Said absorbent sheet according to the present invention may be utilized in or for a variety of absorbent products, and as the sheet is applied in a baby diaper and an incontinent diaper for an adult, gathering function such as waist gather may be realized by giving an absorbent structure form without using any elastic member.<br>
An absorbent sheet according to the present invention may be used as an absorbent body used in an absorbent product having a liquid permeable top sheet,<br><br>
a liquid impermeable leakage preventing sheet and an absorbent body disposed between both sheets for absorbing and holding liquid, which absorbent sheet absorbs bodily fluids and at the same time functions as a guard member for preventing liquid leakage at the side edges and/or the peripheral edges of the &gt;     front and the back body of the absorbent product.<br>
In other words, the absorbent body is sectioned into a middle portion and side edge portions. Said side edge portions have each a laminated structure having a difference in level in terms of thickness of 1.0 mm or less as compared with said central portion when no liquid is absorbed yet, and function as a side guard bank as said edge portions are made to stand up when they absorb liquid to swell with difference in level in terms of thickness of 2.0 mm or more as compared with said central portion.<br>
In addition, an absorbent sheet according to the present invention may be made as its absorbent body is sectioned into a central portion and side portions. Each of said side portions has a folded structure and, when no liquid is absorbed yet, has a difference in level being 2 mm or less thicker than said central portion and, as it absorbs liquid to swell, it is made to stand up as has a difference in level in terms of thickness of 5 mm or more compared with said central portion so that it functions as a three dimensional side guard bank.<br>
Furthermore, an absorbent body may be sectioned into the peripheral edge portions of the front and the back body and the central portion. Each of said peripheral edge portion has a laminated structure having a difference in level in terms of thickness of 1.0 mm or less when no liquid is absorbed compared with said central portion and, as it absorbs liquid to swell, it is made to stand up as has a difference in level in terms of thickness of 5 mm or more compared with said central portion so that it functions as a three dimensional end guard bank.<br>
Also, an absorbent body may be sectioned into the peripheral edge portions of the front and the back body and the central portion. Each of said peripheral edge portion has a folded structure having a difference in level formed in terms of thickness of 2.0 mm or less when no liquid is absorbed compared with said<br><br>
central portion and, as it absorbs liquid to swell, it is made to stand up as has a difference in level in terms of thickness of 5 mm or more compared with said central portion so that it functions as a three dimensional side guard bank.<br>
