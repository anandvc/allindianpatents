The present invention relates to the use of L-carnitine and/or one<br>
or more alkanoyl L-carnitines for the preparation of a physiological<br>
supplement or medicament in the form of eye-drops useful for the<br>
treatment of corneal diseases.<br>
The cornea is the transparent, dome-shaped window covering the<br>
front of the eye. It is a powerful refracting surface, providing 2/3 of the<br>
eye's focusing power. Like the crystal on a watch, it gives us a clear<br>
window to look through.<br>
The cornea is extremely sensitive - there are more nerve endings<br>
in the cornea than anywhere else in the body.<br>
The adult cornea is only about 1/2 millimeter thick and is<br>
arranged in three main regions, or layers:<br>
-	Epithelium: it functions primarily to block the passage of<br>
foreign material such as dust or water into the eye, and other layers of<br>
the cornea, and provide a smooth surface that absorbs oxygen and<br>
other needed cell nutrients that are contained in tears. This layer,<br>
which is about five cells deep, is filled with thousands of tiny nerve<br>
endings that make the cornea extremely sensitive to pain when rubbed<br>
or scratched.<br>
-	Stroma: is located behind the epithelium, the stroma comprises<br>
about 90 percent of the cornea. It consists primarily of water and<br>
layered protein fibers that give the cornea its strength, elasticity, and<br>
form; and cells that nourish it. The unique shape, arrangement, and<br>
spacing of the protein fibers are essential in producing the cornea's<br>
light-conducting transparency.<br><br>
WO 2007/003481	PCT/EP2006/062919<br>
2<br>
Endothelium: this single layer of cells is located between the<br>
stroma and the aqueous humor. Because the stroma tends to absorb<br>
water, the endothelium's primary task is to pump excess water out of<br>
the stroma. Without this pumping action, the stroma would swell with<br>
water, become hazy, and ultimately opaque.<br>
Many diseases can damage this delicate structures.<br>
The main causes of impairment of the epithelial structure of the<br>
cornea are dry eye syndrome; corneal abrasions and injuries due to,<br>
for example, the application of contact lenses; and refractive laser<br>
surgery.<br>
Other diseases of the cornea are associated with impairment of<br>
the normal transparency of the corneal surface, caused, for example,<br>
by damage in the aftermath of keratitis, particularly bacterial, viral or<br>
fungal keratitis; by damage resulting from trauma and refractive laser<br>
surgery; as well as degenerative or hereditary diseases such as<br>
chronic and acute keratocono.<br>
The tear film, which coats the corneal epithelium and is essential<br>
for the homeostasis of the eye surface, performs an important optical<br>
function, acting as a lubricant between the eyelids and the eyeball and<br>
as a vehicle for oxygen, guaranteeing the metabolism of the cells of the<br>
corneal epithelium; it also performs a flushing function, ensuring the<br>
removal of external agents.<br>
Also important is its function as a carrier for growth factors,<br>
neuropeptides, and neuromodulators that regulate the activation,<br>
proliferation and differentiation of corneal and conjunctival epithelial<br><br>
WO 2007/003481	PCT/EP2006/062919<br>
3<br>
cells. It also transports immunoglobulins (IgA, IgAs, IgG, IgE, IgM),<br>
complement factors (C3, C4, C5), metalloproteases (MMP-2, 4, 9),<br>
enzymes (lysozyme, lactoferrin) and immune system cells (limphocyte),<br>
thus performing a fundamental defensive function against infections.<br>
Dry eye syndrome is characterised by a quantitative<br>
(hypolacrimation) and/or qualitative (dyslacrimation) impairment of<br>
the tear film of multifactorial origin which may or may not cause<br>
clinically significant damage to the eye surface. The prevalence of dry<br>
eye syndrome ranges from 10 to 40% in the adult population and there<br>
is a highly significant correlation with age.<br>
In the United States the prevalence of mild-to-moderate dry eye<br>
syndrome is up to approximately 10 million people (Am. J. Ophthalmol:,<br>
1997; 124:723-728; Arch Ophthalmol, 2000; 118: 1264-1268).<br>
Various studies conducted in order to understand the<br>
mechanisms activated in this disease have shown that the tears of<br>
subjects affected by dry eye syndrome present: an increased<br>
evaporation rate, increased surface tension, reduced vitamin A<br>
concentration, increased osmolarity, reduced concentration of a<br>
number of proteins (lysozyme, lactoferrin), insufficient mucus<br>
production or qualitative changes in mucus production, with<br>
consequent inadequate reconstruction of the mucus layer, reductions<br>
in a number of growth factors (EGF, TGF-Î±, aFGF-bFGF, LG-F, HGF)<br>
(Contactologia, 1982; 4: 34-37), changes in concentration of inorganic<br>
elements, reduced androgens and dysregulation of T lymphocyte<br><br>
WO 2007/003481	PCT/EP2006/062919<br>
4<br>
activity (Cornea, 2005; 24: 1-7). Among the mechanisms activated in<br>
this disease the use of contact lenses has to be mentioned.<br>
The clinical signs regarded as being most closely related to this<br>
pathological condition are reduced break-up time (BUT test) and<br>
Schirmer test results (Pescosolido N.: Le alterazioni del film lacrimale. In<br>
Stendler P.: "il sistema lacrimale", Fabiano editore, Canelli (AT), 2000;<br>
pag. 237-330; hereinafter this reference will be referred to as<br>
Pescosolido 2000).<br>
The BUT test has to do with the mucin content of the tear film<br>
and, in the dry eye, yields only values below 5 seconds. The Schirmer<br>
test, on the other hand, has to do with the water content of the tear<br>
film and, in the dry eye, yields values below 5 millimetres in 5<br>
minutes.<br>
The patient presents the following symptoms: foreign body<br>
sensation, burning, difficulty blinking, bruit on opening the eyelids,<br>
itching, eye fatigue, photophobia, blurred vision, and mucus<br>
extravasation at the inner canthi.<br>
The treatment of this syndrome is based on the use of the<br>
following: tear substitutes whose task is the regular moisturising of the<br>
cornea, but which do not exert any action on the basic causes of the<br>
disease and are endowed only with very short-lasting efficacy; inserts<br>
(plugs) in the lacrimal canaliculus; immunoregulators such as topical<br>
cyclosporin; topical steroids; anti-inflammatory agents (rumexilone<br>
and loteprednol); autologous serum (cytokine inhibitors); topical or<br>
systemic androgens; mucus (HETE eicosanoid) and aqueous (P2Y2<br><br>
WO 2007/003481	PCT/EP2006/062919<br>
5<br>
agonists) secretogenic substances; acquaporins and agents such as<br>
antibiotics and detergents for the treatment of a disease often<br>
concomitant, blepharitis (Cornea, 2005; 24:1-7).<br>
Also used is treatment with iodide iontophoresis owing to its<br>
scavenger activity as a reducing agent and electron donor (Adv. Clin.<br>
Path., 2000; 4:11-17; Br. J. Ophthalmol, 2005; 89: 40-44).<br>
Even these latter treatments, despite exerting an action which<br>
may be regarded as more relevant to treating the causes of the disease,<br>
have failed to yield the anticipated results.<br>
The normal transparency of the corneal surface can be impaired<br>
by the aftermath of numerous diseases acquired, degenerative or<br>
congenital that damage the delicate structure of the various<br>
constituent components. The acquired disease conditions most<br>
commonly implicated are post-keratitis damage, particularly after<br>
herpetic keratitis, and damage occurring in the aftermath of trauma<br>
and laser refractive surgery. The minimum common denominator is<br>
the formation of corneal opacities (leucomas) that functionally<br>
jeopardise vision. The events involved in wound healing that occur in<br>
the corneal tissue after infection, caustic damages, injury and<br>
refractive ablative surgery are have a profound effect on the final<br>
morphological and refractive outcomes of the restitutio ad integrum<br>
process.<br>
The acute epithelial and stromal corneal lesions occurring<br>
immediately after injury and laser ablation are probably involved in the<br>
regulation of the subsequent corneal tissue repair events, and, among<br><br>
WO 2007/003481	PCT/EP2006/062919<br>
6<br>
the latter, keratocyte apoptosis probably plays a major role (Cornea,<br>
2000;19:S7-12). This event is responsible for the corneal repair process<br>
since keratocyte apoptosis is the prime mover of the reproliferative<br>
stimulus. The stroma keratocytes underlying the initial acellular<br>
stroma therefore represent the cell source that mediates the<br>
subsequent healing of the surface stroma beneath the epithelium. As a<br>
result of the cellular repopulation, the activated keratocytes undergo<br>
myofibroblastic transformation (Invest. OphthalmoL Vis. Sci.,<br>
1998;39:487-501), thus proving responsible for the production of<br>
collagen fibres and of basic substances involved in the restituito ad<br>
integrum process.<br>
A recent scar is very similar to foetal tissue, it is rich in foetal<br>
and type III collagen with thick fibrils, wide interfibrillary spaces and a<br>
hydrophilic stroma. This explains the characteristic opacity. It also<br>
contains fibrinogen, fibronectin, laminin and weakly sulphurised<br>
keratan sulphate. The keratan sulphate/condroitin sulphate is<br>
reduced in the scar stroma.<br>
The myofibroblasts disappear in a few weeks to a few months.<br>
Gradually the scar changes and becomes less opaque. The resistance<br>
of the stromal scar tissue is 20% compared with normal tissue after<br>
three weeks, 60% after 1 year and 70% after 3-4 years. Corneal<br>
reinnervation is very slow. The cytokines play an important role in<br>
these events. IL-la, produced by the corneal epithelium, stimulates<br>
metalloprotease and collagenase synthesis through the keratocytes<br>
and the myofibroblasts. The TGF-Î² reduces the production of<br><br>
WO 2007/003481	PCT/EP2006/062919<br>
7<br>
collagenase and is involved in the formation of haze. IL-6 reduces the<br>
synthesis of metalloprotease thus increasing collagen synthesis.<br>
This process, however, is not self-controlled and, in many cases,<br>
abnormal, excessive healing occurs followed by a greater production of<br>
collagen type III, an increase of jaluronic acid, and an increase in<br>
lamellar disorganisation (Arch. Ophthalmol, 1990; 108: 665-675; Exp.<br>
Eye Res., 2004; 78 : 553-560; Ophthalmology, 2000; 107 : 1235-1245)<br>
or an accumulation keratocytes e dei myofibroblasts as shown by<br>
confocal microscopy (Progr. Retin. Eye Res., 1999; 18:311-356; J.<br>
Cataract Refract. Surg., 2000; 26 : 432-447; Exp. Eye Res., 2004; 78 :<br>
553-560).<br>
These abnormalities are involved in the pathogenesis of the most<br>
feared complication of stromal regeneration after photorefractive<br>
keratectomy (PRK), namely, haze, with consequent impairment of the<br>
functional outcome. Haze is classified according to Heitzmann in 5<br>
degrees on the basis of the visual impairment due to the reduced<br>
corneal transparency (Ophthalmology, 1998; 35 : 1411-1421); or<br>
according to the Fantes scale (Arch. Ophthalmol, 1990; 108 : 665-675)<br>
which distinguish 6 degrees of haze (0; 0.5; 1+; 2+; 3+; and 4+).<br>
Though the incidence of haze has been substantially reduced over<br>
recent years, as a result of the technological advances in the field of<br>
excimer lasers, it is still a fairly frequent complication even today and,<br>
in rare cases, would appear hard to reverse, even after months of<br>
cortisone therapy (0,5% of the eye with myopia not exceeding 6<br>
diopters and 3-17% in the eye with myopia exceeding 10 diopters<br><br>
WO 2007/003481	PCT/EP2006/062919<br>
8<br>
(Ophthalmol. Clin. North. Am., 2001, 14 : 359-376). In cases of<br>
persistent haze (more than 15-18 months) which fails to respond to<br>
medical cortisonic therapy [an event that can occur with late-onset<br>
haze (4-12 months after the operation (Ophthalmology, 1997; 104 :<br>
369-374; Cornea, 2004, 23 : 350-355), as the only feasible procedure is<br>
phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) with an excimer laser, a procedure<br>
used for the laser-assisted surgical removal of superficial stromal<br>
opacities combined with 0.02% mitomycin (J. Refract. Surg.,<br>
2003; 19:40-43; J. Refract Surg., 2003,19:449-454). The use of the<br>
activator of plasminogen and of TGF-al is still undergoing animal<br>
studies (J. Refract. Surg., 1997; 13:356-361; Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.<br>
Sci., 2004;45:1329-1333), while INFp-2b, tested on man, has produced<br>
poor results (J. Refract. Surg., 1996;22:891-900).<br>
Indeed, while low degree haze is generally asymptomatic, or only<br>
causes a slight reduction in sensitivity to contrast, serious forms of<br>
haze can interfere with refraction and be accompanied by myopic<br>
regression due to exuberant scarring (J. Refract. Surg., 1995; 11.341-<br>
347; Ophthalmology, 2000; 107:1235-1245).<br>
The corneal dystrophies (Bietti, 1971; Oftalmologia geriatrica) are<br>
rare disorders. They are defined as primitive corneal disorders not<br>
associated with trauma, earlier inflammation or systemic diseases.<br>
They affect both eyes, are hereditary and, for the most part, have an<br>
autosomal dominant trait.<br>
Corneal degeneration is far more common than dystrophies but<br>
the symptoms are generally less obvious. It is not hereditary, can be<br><br>
WO 2007/003481	PCT/EP2006/062919<br>
9<br>
unilateral or bilateral and the course is gradual or relatively stable. In<br>
each case, it is, by definition, permanent, or does not resolve itself<br>
spontaneously.<br>
Usually it involves more than one layer of the cornea.<br>
Distinctions can be drawn between primary or idiopathic and<br>
secondary forms. The first are often connected with ageing without<br>
being preceded by any specific pathological process, the second ones<br>
are always associated with eye diseases which precede them, whether<br>
acute, chronic, infectious or inflammatory in nature. Keratoconus is<br>
one of the most typical degenerative diseases.<br>
Keratoconus is a non-inflammatory ectasia of the paracentral<br>
portion of the cornea which evolves over time and takes a progressively<br>
conical form, with tapering of the tip. This corneal deformation results<br>
in severe astigmatism, often irregular, corrected wherever possible with<br>
hard gas-permeable corneal lenses. Only rarely are epikeratoplasty,<br>
photorefractive keratectomy or the use of intracorneal rings (INTACTS)<br>
considered (Cornea, 1987;6:131-139; Ophthalmology, 1992;99:1187-<br>
1192; Surv. Ophthalmol., 1998;42:297-319;J. Cataract. Surg., 2000;<br>
26 : 1117-1122; J. Refract.Surg., 2001;17:69-73) or also the use of<br>
hard gas-permeable lenses combined with INTACTS. All these<br>
techniques only correct the refractive defects but do not resolve the<br>
cause of the corneal ectasia and therefore do not stop the progress of<br>
keratoconus, which in its most severe form means a corneal transplant<br>
(Cornea, 1997;16:623-629; Cornea, 1997;16:414-419; Cornea,<br>
1998; 17:468-470; Cornea, 2002;21:152-155 ).<br><br>
WO 2007/003481	PCT/EP2006/062919<br>
10<br>
Keratocomis starts at puberty and in 20% of cases perforating<br>
keratoplasty has to be performed (Ophthalmology, 1994; 101 : 439-<br>
447).<br>
Past studies have not produced relevant results leading to an<br>
understanding of the physiopathology of the disease but only more<br>
recently, with the development of molecular techniques, have advances<br>
been made in understanding this abnormality.<br>
At present, however, we are not able to say that the presence of<br>
keratoconus is due to uniform anomalies which are specific to the<br>
extracellular matrix. There are areas where the elements of the basal<br>
membrane are absent indicating on-going proteolytic activity, and<br>
there are areas in which there are deposits of fibrotic substance which<br>
is also found in other pathologies. A cornea with keratoconus has low<br>
levels of inhibitory enzymes (TIMP) and greater activity of the enzymes<br>
which are capable of degrading the extracellular matrix. The TIMP play<br>
a predominant role in the thickness of the stroma and in the stability<br>
of Bowman's membrane, which is characteristically interrupted in<br>
keratoconus. Furthermore the decrease in one of these inhibitors,<br>
TIMP-1, could play an important role in apoptosis or in the anomalous<br>
behaviour of the cells found in keratoconus.<br>
Apoptosis is the programmed death of the cells. This death is<br>
necessary for reconstructing damaged cells and for the normal turn-<br>
over of many tissues.<br><br>
WO 2007/003481	PCT/EP2006/062919<br>
11<br>
In keratoconus, apoptosis is more frequently found in the stroma<br>
(Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci., 1998; 39 : 220-226) than in other<br>
corneal layers (Cornea, 2002; 21 : 206-209).<br>
This observation is important because a cornea with keratoconus<br>
is subject to chronic irritation caused by hard gas-permeable contact<br>
lenses, to greater friction and to moderate or severe atopy. Wilson<br>
suggests that mechanical trauma on the epithelium could cause<br>
apoptosis in the stromal cells of keratoconus (Exp. Eye Res., 1999; 69 :<br>
225-266;Cornea, 2000; 19 : S7-S12). Furthermore, an increase in the<br>
levels of leukocytes commonly correlated to the LAR protein antigen<br>
present in keratoconus but not in normal corneas can be seen (Exp.<br>
Eye Res., 1999;68:283-293).<br>
LAR is a transmembrane phosphotyrosine transferase capable of<br>
stimulating apoptosis (Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA, 1994;91:10868-<br>
10872; J. Neurobiol., 2000;42:477-486). A third triggering mechanism<br>
of apoptosis is that it is inhibited by TIMP-1 (J. Clin. Invest.,<br>
1998;102:2002-2010; Blood, 1998;92:1342-1349) which in<br>
keratoconus proves to be reduced, as has been reported previously.<br>
In practice, given these statements, the phenomenon of apoptosis<br>
could play an important role in the pathogenesis of keratoconus.<br>
Sodium hyaluronate is a very well known compound used to<br>
protect corneal epithelial cells, especially in patients with dry eye<br>
syndrome or with Sjogren's syndrome. The action of sodium<br>
hyaluronate is due not only to its protective role of a mechanical type<br>
exerted on the epithelial cells as a result of its viscoelasticity, in<br><br>
WO 2007/003481	PCT/EP2006/062919<br>
12<br>
situations of reduced tear production, but also to the positive effects of<br>
its particular biological function on corneal epithelial cells by<br>
stimulating their migration (Exp. Eye Res., 1991 ;53:753-758).<br>
Taurine (or 2-aminoethanesulphonic acid) is considered an<br>
amino acid, even though it does not possess the characteristic<br>
carboxyl group (COOH) but the SO3H group. Taurine is only present in<br>
the animal realm, whereas vegetable foods do not possess this amino<br>
acid.<br>
Vitamin E is the main antioxidant of the cell membranes, and is<br>
found in the human body in 4 forms consisting of Î±-tocopherol, Î²-<br>
tocopherol, Î³-tocopherol and Î´-tocopherol. Of these the a form is the<br>
most frequent in the retina and in plasma and is the one with the<br>
greatest antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity.<br>
Vitamin A is essential for cell vitality, cytoskeletal organisation, it<br>
regulates the expression of proteins of the extracellular matrix, cell<br>
adhesion and wound repair (J. Cel.l Biochem., 2003; 89 : 837-847).<br>
Vitamin A is also involved in the production of angiogenic (inactivation)<br>
and anti-angiogenic (activation) factors in the endothelial cells (Exp.<br>
Eye Res., 2004; 78 : 945-955). Some of these, stromal derived factor 1<br>
(SDF-1) are secreted under the effect of proinflammatory signals (IL-<br>
l,TNF-a, bacteria and viruses) and, in cooperation with other factors,<br>
are involved in the proliferation of the vascular endothelial cells. SDF-1<br>
and its receptor CXCR4 have been found in human keratocytes (Mol.<br>
Vis. , 2003;9:96-102). Two other systems are also involved in corneal<br>
angiogenesis: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast<br><br>
WO 2007/003481	PCT/EP2006/062919<br>
13<br>
growth factor b (b FGF). Anti-angiogenetic factors contrast these<br>
cytokines as the pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF) (Mol. Vis.,<br>
2001, 7 : 154-163). IL-4 and TGF-Î² are also known to inhibit corneal<br>
angiogenesis in vivo (Acta Ophthalmol. Scand., 2002;80:238-247).<br>
Metalloproteases are able to intervene in the regulation of angiogenesis<br>
with inhibitory or potentiating effects. In the absence of vitamin A, the<br>
corneal epithelium becomes keratinised. Retinol and retinic acid<br>
(Vitamin A), which help to avoid the keratinisation of the corneal<br>
epithelium, are supplied by the tears. Nuclear receptors with retinoids<br>
are present in the epithelium and in the stroma.<br>
Cytidine-5'-diphosphate choline (CDP-choline), commonly known<br>
by the name of citicholine, is a precursor of phosphatidyl choline, the<br>
main phospholipid of the cell membranes. Due to the effect of the<br>
activation of certain lytic enzymes, the phospholipases, the catabolism<br>
of the membrane phospholipids is accelerated and, if the resynthesis<br>
mechanism is inadequate, toxic substances accumulate, such as the<br>
ceramides, which can activate the metabolic pathways which lead to<br>
cell apoptosis. A deterioration in the turn-over of the phospholipids<br>
adversely affects the validity of the membrane protection systems and<br>
puts cell function at risk.<br>
The use of inorganic elements is well known in the medical field,<br>
and a number of these are essential for the stability of the tear film<br>
(Pescosolido 2000).<br>
Previous uses of carnitine in the ophthalmological field are<br>
already known.<br><br>
WO 2007/003481	PCT/EP2006/062919<br>
14<br>
US Patent 5,037,851 describes the use of acetyl L-carnitine for<br>
the treatment of cataract.<br>
US 5,145,871 and 5,432,199 describe the use of acetyl D-<br>
carnitine for the treatment of glaucoma.<br>
US 5,883,127 describes the use of acetyl L-carnitine for the<br>
treatment of maculopathy and macular degeneration.<br>
Further uses of carnitine are also known.<br>
In Res 1992;18(8):355-365 the use of L-carnitine in the<br>
cardiological field is described.<br>
US 5,543,556 describes the use of acyl L-carnitine esters with<br>
gamma-hydroxybutyric acid for the inhibition of neuronal degeneration<br>
and in the treatment of coma.<br>
US 5811457 describes the use of propionyl L-carnitine for the<br>
treatment of chronic obliterating arteriopathy.<br>
None of the above-cited patents or publications describes or<br>
suggests the use of L-carnitine or of alkanoyl L-carnitine for the<br>
treatment of diseases of the cornea.<br>
In the medical field there is still a strongly perceived need for the<br>
availability of therapeutic agents or physiological supplement useful<br>
for the treatment of the above-mentioned corneal diseases.<br>
It has now been found that L-carnitine and/or one or more<br>
alkanoyl L-carnitines, or one of their pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts, are useful agents for the preparation of a physiological<br>
supplement or medicament in the form of eye-drops for the treatment<br>
of diseases of the cornea.<br><br>
WO 2007/003481	PCT/EP2006/062919<br>

What is meant by pharmaceutically acceptable salt of L-carnitine<br>
is any salt of the latter with an acid that does not give rise to toxic or<br>
side effects.<br>
These acids are well known to pharmacologists and to experts in<br>
pharmacy. Non-limiting examples of such salts are: chloride, bromide,<br>
orotate, aspartate, acid aspartate, acid citrate, magnesium citrate,<br>
phosphate, acid phosphate, fumarate and acid fumarate, magnesium<br>
fumarate, lactate, maleate and acid maleate, oxalate, acid oxalate,<br>
pamoate, acid pamoate, sulphate, acid sulphate, glucose phosphate,<br>
tartrate and acid tartrate, glycerophosphate, mucate, magnesium<br>
tartrate, 2-amino-ethanesulphonate, magnesium 2-amino-<br>
ethanesulphonate,	methanesulphonate,	choline tartrate,<br>
trichloroacetate, and trifluoroacetate.<br>
What is meant by pharmaceutically acceptable salt of L-carnitine<br>
is also a salt approved by the FDA and listed in the publication Int. J.<br>
of Pharm. 33 (1986), 201-217, which is incorporated herein by way of a<br>

The following examples illustrate the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A clinical trial was conducted in which 43 patients suffering from<br>
dry eye syndrome were recruited.<br>
The patients recruited were all women aged from 35 to 77 years<br>
(mean age: 59.5 Â± 10.4 years), 33 of whom were suffering from<br><br>
WO 2007/003481	PCT/EP2006/062919<br>
18<br>
Sjogren's syndrome, diagnosed on the basis of Fox et al.'s criteria<br>
(Arthritis Rheum, 1986; 29: 577-584; 1986).<br>
Patients were selected on the basis of the BUT test, the Schirmer<br>
test, the fiuorescein test and the rose bengal test (Pescosolido 2000;<br>
Arch. OphthalmoL, 1969;82: 10-14).<br>
The BUT test had to yield results â¤ 5 seconds, while the Schirmer<br>
test did not contraindicate inclusion in the trial.<br>
Damage to the surface of the eye was evaluated by means of the<br>
rose bengal staining test and the fiuorescein test. Damage in the rose<br>
Bengal staining test was determined by reference to the van Bijsterveld<br>
evaluation (Arch. OphthcdmoL, 1969;82: 10-14), dividing the exposed<br>
surface into 3 zones, with a score of 0 to 3 per zone.<br>
For abnormality of the fiuorescein test score both the affected<br>
surface (A) and the damage density (D) were evaluated, with a range<br>
from 0 to 3 (low and high) on the basis of severity Jap. Clin.<br>
Ophthalmol; 1994; 48: 183-188).<br>
On the basis of the test score results, patients were divided into 3<br>
subgroups, namely, those with mild dry eye (A1D1, A1D2, A2D1),<br>
those with moderate dry eye (A1D3, A2D2, A3D1) and those with<br>
severe dry eye (A2D3, A3D2, A3D3).<br>
The right eye (R) of patients was treated with the eye-drops<br>
according to the invention, consisting of 1% L-carnitine, 0.5% taurine,<br>
0.2% sodium hyaluronate, 0.2% water-soluble vitamin E, 1.02 mg/L<br>
zinc, 0.051 mg/L manganese, 30 mg/L sodium, and 9 mg/L<br>
potassium.<br><br>
WO 2007/003481	PCT/EP2006/062919<br>
19<br>
The left eye (L), which served as the control eye, the baseline<br>
values of which were no different from those of the right eye (R), was<br>
treated with 0.2% hyaluronic-acid-based eye-drops.<br>
Treatment efficacy was determined after 30 days, 4 hours after<br>
the last treatment.<br>
The results obtained are presented in Tables 1-3.<br><br><br>

EXAMPLE 2<br>
In this clinical trial the patient sample recruited consisted of 16<br>
patients, 8 men and 8 women, ranging in age from 21 to 32 years<br>
(mean age: 25 Â± 4.2 years), who had been submitted to refractive laser<br>
surgery (PRK) in both eyes with myopia not exceeding 6 diopters.<br>
The right eye (R) was treated for 3 months with the eye-drops<br>
according to the present invention, while the left eye (L), which served<br>
as a control, was treated with 0.2% hyaluronic-acid-based eye-drop<br>
Both eyes were treated with antibiotic eye-drops for 5 days. A surface<br>
cortisonic was also administered in the left eye 5 days after the<br>
operation for 3 months.<br>
The efficacy of adequate re-epithelialisation after PRK was<br>
evaluated by means of biomicroscopy and the contrast sensitivity test.<br>
Biomicroscopy was performed with first vertical and then<br>
horizontal light target orientation, after 2, 3, 5 and 7 days of<br>
treatment, calculating the de-epithelialisation area.<br>
For the purposes of evaluating the optimal result after PRK,<br>
denoting normal re-epithelialisation and stromal repair, the<br>
contrast sensitivity test was performed (Pescosolido N., Guida<br>
automobilistica ed efficacia visiua; Canelli (AT), Fabva.no Ed., 2001;<br>
herinafter this reference will be referred to as Pescosolido 2001).<br>
Since the vision of an object or image cannot be limited to<br>
mimirnum separable perception (visual acuity), one important<br>
parameter evaluated was the contrast of the object. To study this<br>
parameter, the perception threshold was measured for a whole<br><br>
WO 2007/003481	PCT/EP2006/062919<br>
22<br>
range of objects of various sizes with increasingly reduced<br>
contrasts. The resulting assessment was the spatial contrast<br>
sensitivity function (spatial CSF) (Pescosolido 2001). For this<br>
function, test images were mainly used consisting of stripes with a<br>
sinusoidal luminance profile. These bars, alternating dark and<br>
light, were defined by their spatial frequency [cycles per degree<br>
(CPD) or number of pairs of stripes (black/white) per degree of<br>
visual angle] and by their contrast. The inverse of contrast (C) was<br>
contrast sensitivity (S) (S=1/C). Contrast is often expressed in<br>
terms of percentages, 98% being very high, and 3% very low<br>
{Pescosolido 2001).<br>
The contrast sensitivity test was performed using the Optec<br>
6500 vision tester capable of receiving ETDRS and FACT test scores<br>
and software for the management and analysis of contrast<br>
sensitivity data. The system was capable of simulating the way in<br>
which the patient actually saw things. Moreover, it was capable of<br>
comparing patient simulations with standard representations. The<br>
examination was performed first after 10 days and then at 3 and 6<br>
months postoperatively. Patients started treatment immediately<br>
after PRK. The right eye (R) was treated with the eye-drops<br>
according to the present invention mentioned in example 1 (2<br>
drops, 4 times daily), while the left eye, which served as a control,<br>
was treated with 0.2% hyaluronic-acid-based eye-drops and surface<br>
cortisonic after postoperative day 5 (the latter only for the first 3<br>
months, 3 times daily).<br><br>
WO 2007/003481	PCT/EP2006/062919<br>
23<br>
Single-dose antibiotic eye-drops was instilled in both eyes 4<br>
times daily and a hydrogel contact lens was applied to both eyes<br>
after PRK for the first 5 days postoperatively.<br>
Two days after the operation (PRK) the patients treated with<br>
the eye-drops according to the present invention presented a de-<br>
epithelialisation area of 6.0 mm2 Â±6.8 mm, whereas in the control<br>
eyes the de-epithelialisation area measured 8.4 mm2 Â± 9.2 mm.<br>
After 3 days complete re-epithelialisation in the treated eyes was<br>
77% as against 61% in the control eyes. After 5 days complete re-<br>
epithelialisation was 100% as against 90% in the control eyes. After<br>
7 days re-epithelialisation was 100% in both eyes.<br>
Evaluation of the variation in contrast after 6 months'<br>
treatment in the eyes treated with the eye-drops according to the<br>
present invention (R) compared to the control eyes (L) showed a<br>
statistically significant difference.<br>
