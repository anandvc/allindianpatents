FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
Present invention relates to development of a high strength (more than 1500 MPa)<br>
austempered ductile iron, also known as ADI, suitable for manufacture of various high<br>
performance components in steel plants /rolling mills for different service conditions and<br>
also at high temperatures, due to its excellent combination of superior mechanical and<br>
metallurgical properties. Such properties are obtained through a selective process of heat<br>
treatment cycles to which the as cast ductile iron is subjected, with controlled process<br>
parameters comprising austenitizing and the austempering at preferred temperatures and<br>
durations, favoring achieving desired microstructure with selective alloy chemistry. The<br>
tensile strength was achieved upto a maximum of 3 times higher than existing to about 152<br>
kg/mm2 and elongation of about 4.5%. The invention is also directed to an alternative heat<br>
treatment process with selective alloy chemistry to achieve high ductility of 11% and a<br>
moderate tensile strength of 105 kg/mm2 in the resulting ductile iron. This material (ADI)<br>
has a potential for replacement of high value forged and heat-treated components of steel<br>
and non-ferrous material. ADI is 10% less dense than steel and an ADI component<br>
consumes 50% less energy than a steel casting and almost 80% less energy than a steel<br>
forging. Traditional cast irons often cannot meet these stringent demands and designers<br>
have been forced to specify expensive forging in place of castings. The trend toward<br>
reduced size and power output in the present design has placed great demands on<br>
component materials. ADI can be used as an alternative to steel, alloyed and white irons,<br>
bronze and other non-ferrous materials. The advantage of this material is that it is made<br>
through casting process and thus can be tailor-made to suit any particular application. The<br>
ADI is therefore a cost effective material consuming less energy compared to the forged<br>
steel and other materials, making it an economic alternative material for a variety of<br>
industrial applications.<br>
BACKGROUND ART:<br>
Use of austempered ductile iron has emerged as a new class of engineering materials in the<br>
recent past. ADI, as it is alternatively known, refers to a family of ductile irons whose<br>
properties can be varied over a wide range by the correct choice of heat-treatment variables<br>
corresponding to the selective alloy chemistry used. It has excellent combination of<br>
properties making it suitable for manufacturing of various high performance components. It<br>
is well known in the art of making ductile iron and as the name suggests, the as cast<br><br>
microstructure of ductile iron consists of nodular graphite in ferritic matrix and thus giving a<br>
relatively low tensile strength but high % elongation/ductility. Thus there had been an<br>
increased demand and newer use of austempered ductile iron, necessitated for inducing<br>
higher strength for making it suitable for applications in mechanical components like<br>
connecting rods, crankshafts and gears, screen plates, chain sprockets, bushes, slide<br>
bearings, wear guides, digger teeth, brake blocks to be made from this material.<br>
Conventional as cast ductile iron fails to provide these properties and meet the application<br>
specific requirements, there by forcing the designers to select more expensive alloy steel<br>
forgings as an alternative material.<br>
In our earlier granted Indian Patent 199279 there was disclosed a process for producing ADI<br>
having strength properties upto about less than 1500 MPa. However, there is a continuing<br>
need in the art to achieve further strength properties beyond 1500 MPa for variety of other<br>
end use and applications involving superior mechanical and metallurgical properties in the<br>
end product.<br>
Present invention is thus directed to developing a process of selectively using heat<br>
treatment parameters with selective design of alloy chemistry, of the as cast ductile iron<br>
such as to obtain preferred microstructure induce the required mechanical strength and<br>
ductility properties to suit various applications as said exceeding those provided by the<br>
existing variety of ADI the range of mechanical properties such as 95-140 kg/mm2 coupled<br>
with 3-10% elongation.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The basic object of the present invention is thus directed to obtaining a high strength (&gt;<br>
1500 MPa) austempered ductile iron(ADI) and preferably 152 kg/mm2 with moderate<br>
ductility such as 4.5 % elongation for desired variety of use of the ADI for high<br>
performance components in different engineering applications.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to obtaining ADI by the use of selective<br>
alloy chemistry favoring obtaining said desired mechanical properties in the resulting<br>
austempered ductile iron, by providing selective chemistry.<br><br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to obtaining a high strength<br>
(&gt;1500MPa) austempered ductile iron (ADI) and favorable ductility for different engineering<br>
applications has an alternative process by altering the parameters such as the properties<br>
obtained in the end product is having a moderate tensile strength of 105kg/mm2 and<br>
ductility in the range of about 11%.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to obtaining a high strength (&gt;1500<br>
MPa) austempered ductile iron (ADI) and favorable ductility for different engineering<br>
applications, said desired properties of the ADI were obtained while tested at room<br>
temperature and also the testing of the material conducted at elevated temperature viz at<br>
about 300°C and the said desired properties maintained at satisfactory levels.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to obtaining a high strength (&gt;1500<br>
MPa) austempered ductile iron (ADI) and favorable ductility for different engineering<br>
applications, such that a low cost alternative material is obtained at lower energy<br>
consumption, to substitute expensive alloy steel forgings wherever used for the purpose of<br>
higher strength properties, hardness or ductility in specific applications.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO ACCOMPANYING<br>
EXAMPLES AND ILLUSTRATIONS:<br>
Austempered ductile iron (ADI) are used for various engineering applications in any<br>
integrated steel plant and rolling mills because of its high strength and toughness, moderate<br>
hardness and favorable ductility with superior microstructure/metallurgical properties,<br>
suitable for different service conditions and also at high temperature. ADI has the potential<br>
for replacement of high value forged and heat treated component of steel and non-ferrous<br>
materials. The material can be advantageously obtained in the form of casting as tailor-<br>
made to suit any application. Moreover, it is cost effective and also consumes low energy<br>
compared to forged steel and other materials.<br>
EXAMPLE:<br>
Investigation work was carried out to develop austempered ductile iron of the present<br>
invention. The selection of process variables for heat treatment such as heat-treating<br>
temperature (austenisation temperature and austempering temperature), time duration and<br>
alloy composition were found to play a very important role on achieving the mechanical and<br>
metallurgical properties. The selective composition of the as cast grade of the ductile iron<br>
identified as given in the following Table I:<br><br>
The effect of heat treatment parameters was studied in detail for various alternatives. The<br>
design of experiments for such study comprised: (i) design of heat treatment cycle-<br>
austenizing and austempering, (ii) design of alloy chemistry for the ductile iron and (iii)<br>
development of the desired high-strength(greater than 1500 MPa) austempered ductile iron.<br>
The tensile strength, hardness and other mechanical properties of various samples were<br>
evaluated. The accompanying figure 1 representing the flow process chart for the<br>
production stages for the processes for ductile iron making and its subsequent heat<br><br>
treatment and pouring into test bars to study the results obtained in terms of mechanical<br>
and metallurgical properties of the ADI.<br>
It is well known that the as cast micro-structure of ductile iron is nodular graphite in ferritic<br>
matrix so as to instill in it the soft yet tough and ductile behaviour. However to improve<br>
upon the strength and hardness properties, the micro-structure of austempered ductile iron<br>
is processed to consist of bainitic ferrite, retained austenite, nodular graphite and carbide in<br>
desired proportions/distribution. During the experimentation and trials, a number of heat<br>
treatment cycles were studied to find out the effect of heat treatment parameters on the<br>
mechanical properties. It has been observed that austenitizing at 900°C for one hour and<br>
austempering at 280°C preferably for two hours followed by air cooling, is suitable for high<br>
strength application. The micrographs of typical heat treated ADI sample following<br>
austenitisation at 900°C for 1 hr and austempering at 280°C for 2 hrs is shown in<br>
accompanying figure 2 and figure 3 with varied magnification. For the present invention,<br>
the tensile strength has remarkably improved by about three times from 48 kg/mm2 for as<br>
cast value to about 152 kg/mm2 with 4.5% elongation in the ADI obtained. High<br>
temperature tensile test was also carried out with the same material at about 300°C.<br>
And the test results obtained were satisfactory and improvement over the existing grades of<br>
ADI earlier developed. Austanisation at 880°C for one hour and subsequent austempering at<br>
400°C for two hours followed by air cooling can also be successfully used such that high<br>
ductility viz 11% elongation and moderate tensile strength of about 105kg/mm2 was<br>
achieved for suitable industrial application. Properties of as cast and austempered ductile<br>
iron tested at room temperature and also for high temperature test data, following the<br>
protocol as follows:<br>
i)	The room temp, tensile testing has been carried out in Instron-1135 with attachment<br>
for measuring elongation. This is a ISO certified testing machine which is being used<br>
world wide.<br>
ii) The hardness measurement has been carried out in vickers testing machine which is<br>
also ISO certified and calibrated.<br>
iii) The high temperature tensile testing at 300° C has been carried out in MTS-8110<br>
mechanical testing system. MTS dynamic testing machine MTS-810 which is also<br>
used world wide and ISO certified.<br>
The room temperature and also for high temperature test data are presented in the<br>
accompanying Table II below.<br><br><br>
It is thus possible by way of the present invention, obtaining a high strength and preferably<br>
UTS greater than 1500 MPa with moderate hardness and ductility so as to favor<br>
austempered ductile iron (ADI) obtained by following the controlled parameters of the<br>
austenitizing and austempering process of the present invention, with micro-structure<br>
comprising bainitic ferrite, retained austenite, nodular graphite and carbide in preferred<br>
proportions and distribution suitable for use of the material for high performance<br>
components in various engineering applications in steel plants, rolling mills and the like,<br>
because of having excellent combination of properties in said ADI according to the<br>
invention.<br><br>
