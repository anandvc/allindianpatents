				<td>This invention relates to a process for the Preparation of Cyclic Acetals of glycosides of Podophyllotoxin.<br>
Particularly it relates to a process for the synthesis of acetals of glycosides of podophyllotoxin of general formula III of the drawing accompanying this specification where in R=H or CH3 R'=alkylor hetero cyclo alkyledene. More particularly it relates to a preparation of podophyllotoxin -4-O-(4",6"-O-α- fur-furylidene-S -D-glucopyranoside) of the formula(8), 4'-demethylpodophyllotoxin-4-O-(4",6"-O-α-furfurylidene-ß-D-glucopyranoside of the formula(9), podophyllotoxin-4-0-(4",6"-O-isobutyrylidene -ß-D-glucopyranoside) of the formula (10) and 4'-demethylpodophyllotoxin-4-O-(4",6"-O-isobutyrylidene-ß-D-glucopyranoisde) of the formula (11) .<br>
The podophyllotoxins are a particular class of natural products which have found extensive usage in the design and synthesis of potential anticancer agents based upon natural product prototype. They have long and fascinating history as medicinals. The aryltetralin lignans have acquired.considerable importance because of their cytotoxic and antitumor activity, De Swet. P.A.G.M.et al . [Adverse effects of herbal Drugs, Vol.2.Springer Verlog Berlin Heildelberg, 1993 ]. Podophyllotoxin and some other structurally closely related lignan &amp; lignan glucosides isolated from roots\rhizomes of P.emodi \ P.hexandrum exert a power-<br>
ful and specific inhibition of mitosis. Evaluated with<br>
systemic application as tumor damaging agents these<br>
natural products failed to act satisfactarily in clini¬<br>
cal trials due to non specific side effects.	However<br>
the lignan podophyllotoxin present in podophyllum<br>
species has been chemically modified to produce the<br>
clinically useful drugs namely etoposide [4'-demethyie-<br>
pipodophyllotoxin-4 -O- (4",6"-O-ethylidene-i3-D-<br>
glucopyranoside)] of the formula 1 and teniposide [<br>
4'- demethylepipodophyllotoxin -4- 0- (4",6"-O-α-<br>
thenylidene- ß-D-glucopyranoside)] of the general<br>
formula   1  where  in R=H or CH3   and R'=(Formula Removed)or  CH3.<br>
It     has     been     shown     by     Stahelin      [Planta Medica,22,336(1972),   Eur.J.Cancer  6,   303(1970),   ibid   9, 215    (1973),   ibid  12.,   925    (1976)]    that   etoposide   (VM-26) and  teniposide    (VP-16-273)    at   low  concentrations    (e.g. 0.005-0.01   fig/ml)   apparently  prevent   cells   from   enter¬ing  mitosis   and  arrest   cells   in   the     S   or  G2   phase   of cell   cycle,   Grieder    [   Cancer   Res.,34,    1788    (1974)    ] ; Huang    [   Cancer   Res.33,    3121(1973)    ],    Krishnan    [ J.Cell.Bio. ,-66,    521    (1975)];    Loike    [Biochemistry   15, 5435,    5443    (1976)    ].    The   class   of   4' -demethylated epipodophyllotoxin  examplified  by  clinical   prototypes etoposide    (VM-26)    and   teniposide    (VP-16-273)    have emerged  into  the  forefront   of  antitumour drug  develop¬ment .<br>
Scattered early attempts by largely unsuccessful use of podophyllotoxin to treat human neoplasia were summarized by Kelly and Hartwell [ J.Nat 1.Cancer Inst.,14., 967 (1954) ]. The glucosides of podophyllo¬toxin and 4'demethylpodophyllotoxin were found (by workers-at Sandoz Laboratories Basel, Switzerland), to generally inhibit the growth of cell culture as well as experimentally induced tumors in mice: Emmenegeer et al., [ Arzneim, Forsch 11, 327, 459 (1961) ] reported that in vitro the glucosides were found to be 10-10 times less active than their corresponding aglycones, but only 5-20 times less active against Ehrlich's murine ascites tumors. In dose displaying pronounced cytostatic effect, the podophyllotoxin glucosides did not produce the noxious side effects, such as nausea, vomitting, diarrhoea and damage to normal tissue as compared to their corresponding aglycones.<br>
However, these glucosides did not act satisfacto¬rily in clinical trials because of non-specific side effects. Kuhn and von Wartburg [ Helv. Chim. Acta.,. 51, 163 (1968) ibid; 51, 1631 (1968)] developed a new procedure for the synthesis of previously unknown glucosides of epipodophyllotoxin type. They also ob¬served that when podophyllotoxin is glucosidated under same conditions inversion of configuration at C-4 of the aglycone moiety occurs leading to epi glucoside. This is presumed to proceed through a common carbonium<br>
ion at C-4 by Lewis acid with subsequent substitution by the pyranose group from the less hindered side to give exclusively the epi derivative and reaction was found to be useful for synthesis of glucosides of epipodophyllotoxin as well as 4'-demefehyl-epipodophyl-lotoxin series.<br>
The first step of the method reported in litera¬ture (glucosidation with BF3 etherate) gives exclusive¬ly epi isomer thus altering the stereochemistry of the molecule at C-4. The synthesis of cyclic acetals and ketals was achieved; Juslen,C.K. [ J.of Medicinal Chemistry, 14,936 (1971) ] by reaction of the glucoside of epipodophyllotoxin-4-O-ß-D-glucopyranoside or 4'-demethyl-epipodophyllotoxin-4-O- ß'-D-glucopyranoside with the corresponding carbonyl compounds in the presence of Lewis acids such as ZnCl2, BF3 etherate, AlCl3, ion exchange resin. The carbonyl compounds could also be replaced by their acetals or ketals. The con¬densation reaction took place generally with the -OH groups at C-4 and C-6 of the hexapyranose moiety. In the case of aldehydes the formation of two stereoiso¬mers, differing from another in the configuration of newly introduced asymmetric C, is to be expected. However, isomer with an equatorial bond of the aldehyde residue predominates almost exclusively; the isomer with an axial substituent is produced only in minimal amounts and is usually lost during the purification of<br>
the main reaction product. The actual configuration of sugar acetals of this type could be recognised espe¬cially with acetals of aromatic aldehydes, by a charac¬teristic chemical shift of the axial proton in the nmr spectrum Bagget,N. [Chemistry &amp; Industry (London), 1832 (1964)   ] .<br>
In our copending application No.1457/DEL/95 dated<br>
4-8-95 we have described a method for the isolation of<br>
glycosides of podophyllotoxin of general formula II<br>
where in R=CH3 or H [podophyllotoxin-4-O-ß-D-glucopyra-<br>
noside and 4'-demethylpodophyllotoxin- 4-O-ß-D-glucopy-<br>
ranoside] from roots/rhizomes of Podophyllum emodi. The<br>
mixture was separated on silica gel column by elution<br>
with chloroform-methanol 90:10 to yield podophyllotox-<br>
in-4-O-ß-D-glucopyranoside(3)followed by elution with<br>
chloroform-methanol 85:15 to yield 4'-demethylpodo-<br>
phyllotoxin-4-O-ß-D-glucopyranoside(4).In our copending<br>
application No.1620/DEL/94 dated 14.12.1994 we have<br>
described a method to convert glucosides of general<br>
formula II to stereoisomers of etoposide methyl ether<br>
of general formula I such as, etoposide and teniposide<br>
viz. podophyllotoxin-4-O-(4",6"-O-ethylidene -ß-D-<br>

where	R = H	and	R"=CH3	and<br>

-6-D-   gluco-pyranoside),   where  R=H  &amp;  R' =	In<br>
this   patent   we   have   described   a   method   to   convert<br>
glucosides (II) to the acetals of formula III<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and the cytotoxity has been reported for these com¬pounds .<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of cyclic acetals of glycosides of Podophyliotoxin.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of cyclic acetals of glyco¬sides of Podophyliotoxin of general formula III of the drawing accompanying this specification where in R=H, CH3 and R'=alkyl, heterocyclo alkyledene which com¬prises reacting glycosides of podophyliotoxin of gener¬al foirmula II wherein R=H or CH3 in an organic solvent with a compound like alkyl or heterocyclo alkyledene having aldehyde group in presence of a lewis acid catalyst such as herein described at a temperature in the range of 15-30°C under inert atmosphere for a period in the range of 4-6 hr, recovering the compound of general formula III by known methods.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention glyco¬sides of Podophyllotoxin used may be such as podophyl-lotoxin-4-O--D-glucopyranoside, 4'-demethylpodophyllo¬toxin 4-O- -D-glucopyranoside.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the organic solvent used may be such as nitromethane, acetonitrile, dimethylsulphoxide.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present inven¬tion the lewis acid catalyst used may be such as p-toulene sulphonic acid, BF3-ehterate, ZnCl2, AlCl3.<br>
In yet still another ambodiment of the present invention the compound having aldehyde group used may be such as furfuraldehyde, isobutyraldehyde.<br>
The present invention provides a simple process for the synthesis of cyclic acetals from natu¬rally occuring glucosides of podophyllotoxin and 4'-demethylpodophyllotoxin such as podo-phyllotoxin -4-O-(4",6"-O-α- furfurylidene- -D-glucopyranoside), 4'-demethylpodophyllotoxin -4 -O- (4",6"-O-α-furfurylidene - -D-glucopyranoside, podo-phyllotoxin-4-O-(4",6"-isobutyrylidene- -D-glucopyranoside) and 4'-demethyl-4-O-(4" , 6"-O-isobutyrylidene- -D-glucopyranoisde) . Synthesis of these compounds has been achieved by the condensation reaction of the glucosides of podo¬phyllotoxin and 4'-demethylpodophyllotoxin respec¬tively with the apropriate liquid alicyclic or heterocyclic  aldehydes.  The   above  glucosides<br>
were suspended in excess of carbonyl compound and stirred after the addition of lewis acid as catalyst at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere. Usual workup and purification over silica gel and elution with chloroform methanol mixture yielded the pure product. Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the synthesis of podophy11otoxin -4-O-{4",6"-o-furfurylidene-ß-D-glucopyranoside} ,4'-demethyl podophyllotoxin-4-O- {4" , 6" -O-ar-furfurylidene--D-glucopyranoside}, podophyllotoxin-4-O-{4",6"-O-isobutyrylidene -ß-D-glucopyranoside} and 4'-demethylpodo phyllotoxin - 4-O-{4",6"-O-isobutyryli-dene- -D-glucopyranoside}. Synthesis of these com¬pounds has been acheived by the condensation reaction of the glucosides of podophyllotoxin and 4'-demethyl-podophyllotoxin respectively with the appropriate liquid acyclic or heterocyclic aldehydes. The above glucosides were suspended in excess of carbonyl com¬pound and stirred after the addition of lewis acid as catalyst at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere. Usual workup and purification over silica gel and elution with chloroform methanol mixture yielded the pure product.<br>
Accordingly the present invention describes in detail a process for the synthesis of podophyllotoxin -4-O-(4", 6"-O- furfurylidene-JS-D-glucopyranoside) , 4'-demethyl-podophyllotoxin -4-O- (4", 6" -O-α-furfurylidene-<br>
-D-glucopyranoside, podophyllotoxin -4-O-(4",6"-O-isobutyrylidene -ß-D-glucopyranoside) and 4'-demethyl -4-O-(4",6"-O-isobutyrylidene -ß-D-glucopyranoisde) respectively. The reaction is conducted by the conden¬sation of glycosides of podophyllotoxin of general formula II with furfuraldehyde or isobutyraldehyde in the presence of p-toulene sulfonic acid or a lewis acid like anhydrous zinc chloride, boron triflouride ether-ate, anhydrous aluminium chloride in an inert atmos¬phere and an organic solvent, passing the reaction over silica gel and an organic solvent, passing the reaction mixture over silica gel and eluting with a mixture of chloroform: methanol. The inert atmosphere may be maintained by using inert gases like nitrogen, argon and the like. The lewis acids which have been used to catalyse the reaction are p-toulene sulphonic acid, anhydrous zinc chloride, boron triflouride etherate, anhydrous aluminium chloride and ion exchange resin (Dowex 50) . The mixture of solvents used for elution may be selected from chloroform:methanol , chloroform:ethyl acetate, chloroform:acetone and the like.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the novel feature lies in the process for the synthesis of hitherto unknown series of probable anticancer com pounds. Yet another feature of the invention, which has been described in detail in the examples provided below, lies in the approach for the synthesis of final<br>
product which is simple and yields are quite high, and therefore economically viable.<br>
