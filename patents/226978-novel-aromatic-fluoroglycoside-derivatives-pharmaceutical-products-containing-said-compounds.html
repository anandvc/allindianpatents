Novel aromatic fluoroglycoside derivatives, pharmaceutical products containing said compounds and the use thereof<br>
The invention relates to substituted aromatic fluoroglycoside derivatives, their physiologically tolerated salts and physiologically functional derivatives.<br>
Several classes of substances having an SGLT effect have already been disclosed in the literature. The model for all these structures was the natural product phlorizin. From this were derived the following classes which are described in the property rights below:<br>
-	propiophenone glycosides of Tanabe (WO 0280936, WO 0280935, JP 2000080041 and EP 850948)<br>
-	2-(glucopyranoslyoxy)benzylbenzenes of Kissei (WO 0244192. WO 0228872 and WO 0168660)<br>
glucopyranosyloxypyrazoles of Kissei and Ajinomoto (WO 0268440, WO 0268439, WO 0236602 and WO 0116147) O-glycoside benzamides of Bristol-Myers Squibb (WO 0174835 and WO 0174834)<br>
-	and C-aryl glycosides of Bristol-Myers Squibb (WO 0127128 and<br>
US 2002137903).<br>
All the known structures contain glucose as a very important structural element.<br>
Furthermore, diaryl sulfide compounds for the treatment of inflammatory and immune diseases are known from US 2002/132807. EP 0 953 357 A1 describes in general glycoside compounds as renal drug carriers and WO 95/23780 describes 4-hydroxyphenoxy-heterocycloalkyl compounds as skin lighteners.<br>
The invention was based on the object of providing novel compounds with which it is possible to prevent and treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We have now surprisingly found that aromatic fluoroglycoside derivatives increase the effect on SGLT. These compounds are therefore particularly suitable for preventing and treating type 1 and type 2 diabetes.<br><br>

The alkyl radicals in the substituents R4, R5, R6, R7, R8 and R9 may be either straight-chain or branched. Halogen means F, CI, Br or I, preferably F or CI.<br><br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are, because their solubility in water is greater than that of the initial or basic compounds, particularly suitable for medical applications. These salts must have a pharmaceutically acceptable anion or cation. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the invention are salts of inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic, phosphoric, metaphosphoric, nitric and sulfuric acid, and of organic acids such as, for example, acetic acid, benzenesuifonic, benzoic, citric, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glycolic, isethionic, lactic, lactobionic, maieic, malic, methanesulfonic, succinic, p-toluenesulfonic and tartaric acid. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable basic salts are ammonium salts, alkali metal salts (such as sodium and potassium salts), alkaline earth metal salts (such as magnesium and calcium salts), trometamol (2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol). diethanolamine, lysine or ethylenediamine.<br>
Salts with a pharmaceutically unacceptable anion such as, for example, trifluoroacetate likewise belong within the framework of the invention as useful intermediates for the preparation or purification of pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or for use in nontherapeutic, for example in vitro, applications.<br>
The term "physiologically functional derivative" used herein refers to any physiologically tolerated derivative of a compound of the formula I of the invention, for example an ester, which on administration to a mammal such as, for example, a human is able to form (directly or indirectly) a compound of the formula I or an active metabolite thereof.<br>
Physiologically functional derivatives include prodrugs of the compounds of the invention, as described, for example, in H. Okada et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1994, 42, 57-61. Such prodrugs can be metabolized in vivo to a compound of the invention. These prodrugs may themselves be active or not. Carbonates at the 6 position of the sugar (see WO 0280936 and WO 0244192) are preferred, particularly preferably methyl carbonate and ethyl carbonate.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also exist in various polymorphous forms, for example as amorphous and crystalline polymorphous forms. All polymorphous forms<br><br>
cf the compounds of the invention belong within the framework of the invention and are a further aspect of the invention.<br>
All references to "compound(s) of formula I" hereinafter refer to compound(s) of the formula I as described above, and their salts, solvates and physiologically functional derivatives as described herein.<br>
The compound(s) of formula (I) may also be administered in combination with other active ingredients.<br>
The amount of a compound of formula I necessary to achieve the desired biological effect depends on a number of factors, for example the specific compound chosen, the intended use, the mode of administration and the clinical condition of the patient. The daily dose is generally in the range from 0.3 mg to 100 mg (typically from 3 mg and 50 mg) per day and per kilogram of bodyweight. for example 3-10 mg/kg/day. An intravenous dose may be, for example, in the range from 0.3 mg to 1.0 mg/kg, which can suitably be administered as infusion of 10 ng to 100 ng per kilogram and per minute. Suitable infusion solutions for these purposes may contain, for example, from 0.1 ng to 10 mg, typically from 1 ng to 10 mg, per milliliter. Single doses may contain, for example, from 1 mg to 10 g of the active ingredient. Thus, ampoules for injections may contain, for example, from 1 mg to 100 mg, and single-dose formulations which can be administered orally, such as, for example, tablets or capsules, may contain, for example, from 1.0 to 1000 mg, typically from 10 to 600 mg. For the therapy of the abovementioned conditions, the compounds of formula I may be used as the compound itself, but they are preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition with an acceptable carrier. The carrier must, of course, be acceptable in the sense that it is compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and is not harmful for the patient's health. The carrier may be a solid or a liquid or both and is preferably formulated with the compound as a single dose, for example as a tablet, which may contain from 0.05% to 95% by weight of the active ingredient. Other pharmaceutically active substances may likewise be present, including other compounds of formula I. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be produced by one of the known pharmaceutical methods, which essentially consist of mixing the ingredients with pharmacologically acceptable carriers and/or excipients.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are those suitable for oral, rectal, topical, peroral (for example sublingual) and parenteral (for example subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal or intravenous) administration, although the most suitable mode of administration depends in each individual case on the nature and severity of the condition to be treated and on the nature of the compound of formula I used in each case. Coated formulations and coated slow-release formulations also belong within the framework of the invention. Preference is given to acid- and gastric juice-resistant formulations. Suitable coatings resistant to gastric juice comprise cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthaiate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate and anionic polymers of methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical compounds for oral administration may be in the form of separate units such as, for example, capsules, cachets, suckable tablets or tablets, each of which contain a defined amount of the compound of formula I; as powders or granules; as solution or suspension in an aqueous or nonaqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. These compositions may, as already mentioned, be prepared by any suitable pharmaceutical method which includes a step in which the active ingredient and the carrier (which may consist of one or more additional ingredients) are brought into contact. The compositions are generally produced by uniform and homogeneous mixing of the active ingredient with a liquid and/or finely divided solid carrier, after which the product is shaped if necessary. Thus, for example, a tablet can be produced by compressing or molding a powder or granules of the compound, where appropriate with one or more additional ingredients. Compressed tablets can be produced by tableting the compound in free-flowing form such as, for example, a powder or granules, where appropriate mixed with a binder, glidant, inert diluent and/or one (or more) surface-active/dispersing agent(s) in a suitable machine. Molded tablets can be produced by molding the compound, which is in powder form and is moistened with an inert liquid diluent, in a suitable machine.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions which are suitable for peroral (sublingual) administration comprise suckable tablets which contain a compound of formula I with a flavoring, normally sucrose and gum arabic or tragacanth, and pastilles which comprise the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerol or sucrose and<br><br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for parenteral administration comprise preferably sterile aqueous preparations of a compound of formula I, which are preferably isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. These preparations are preferably administered intravenously, although administration may also take place by subcutaneous, intramuscular or intradermal injection.

Preparation of brush border membrane vesicles from the small intestine of rabbits. rats and pigs<br>
Preparation of brush border membrane vesicles from the intestinal cells of the small intestine was carried out by the so-called Mg2+ precipitation method. The mucosa of the small intestine was scraped off and suspended in 60 ml of ice-cold Tris/HCI buffer (ph 7.1)/300 mM mannitol, 5 mM EGTA. Dilution to 300 ml with ice-cold distilled water was followed by homogenization with an Ultraturrax (18 shaft, IKA Werk Staufen. FRG) at 75% of the max. power for 2 x 1 minute, while cooling in ice. After addition of 3 ml of 1M MgCI2 solution (final concentration 10 mM), the mixture is left to stand at 0CC for exactly 15 minutes. Addition of Mg2+ causes the cell membranes to aggregate and precipitate with the exception of the brush border membranes. After centrifugation at 3 000-x g (5 000 rpm, SS-34 rotor/for 15 minutes, the precipitate is discarded and the supernatant, which contains the brush border membranes, is centrifuged at 26 700 x g (15 000 rpm, SS-34 rotor) for 30 minutes. The supernatant is discarded, and the precipitate is rehomogenized in 60 ml of 12 mM Tris/HCI buffer<br><br>
(ph 7.1)/60 mM mannitol, 5 mM EGTA using a Potter Eivejhem homogenizer (Braun,<br>
Melsungen, 900 rpm, 10 strokes). Addition of 0.1 ml of 1M MgCI2 solution and<br>
incubation at 0Â°C for 15 minutes is followed by centrifugation again at 3 000 x g for<br>
15 minutes. The supernatant is then centrifuged again at 46 000 x g (20 000 rpm.<br>
SS-34 rotor) for 30 minutes. The precipitate is taken uo In 30 ml of 20 mM Tris/Hepes<br>
buffer (pH 7.4)/280 mM mannitol and homogeneously resuspended by 20 strokes in a<br>
Potter Elveihem homogenizer at 1 000 rpm. After centrifugation at 48 000 x g (20 000<br>
rpm, SS-34 rotor) for 30 minutes, the precipitate was taken up in 0.5 to 2 ml of<br>
Tris/Hepes buffer (pH 7.4)/280 mM mannitol (final concentration 20 mg/ml) and<br>
resuspended using a tuberculin syringe with a 27 gauge needle.<br>
The vesicles were either used directly after preparation for labeling or transport<br>
studies or were stored at -196Â°C in 4 mg portions in liquid nitrogen.<br>
To prepare brush border membrane vesicles from rat small intestine, 6 to 10 male<br>
Wistar rats (bred at Kastengrund, Aventis Pharma) were sacrificed by cervical<br>
dislocation, and the small intestines were removed and rinsed with cold isotonic<br>
saline. The intestines were cut up and the mucosa was scraped off. The processing<br>
to isolate brush border membranes took place as described above. To remove^<br>
cytoskeletal fractions, the brush border membrane vesicles from rat small intestine<br>
were treated with KSCN as chaotropic ion.		_  .<br>
To prepare brush border membranes from rabbit small intestine, rabbits were sacrificed by intravenous injection of 0.5 ml of an aqueous solution of 2.5 mg of tetracaine HCI, 100 mg of m-butramide and 25 mg of mebezonium iodide. The small intestines were removed, rinsed with ice-cold physiological saline and stored frozen in plastic bags under nitrogen at -80Â°C and 4 to 12 weeks. For preparation of the membrane vesicles, the frozen intestines were thawed at 30Â°C in a water bath and then the mucosa was scraped off. Processing to give membrane vesicles took place as described above.<br>
To prepare brush border membrane vesicles from pig intestine, jejunum segments from a freshly slaughtered pig were rinsed with ice-cold isotonic saline and frozen in plastic bags under nitrogen at -80Â°C. Preparation of the membrane vesicles took place as described above.<br><br>
Preparation of brush border membrane vesicles from the renal cortex of the rat kidney<br>
Brush border membrane vesicles were prepared from the cortex of the rat kidney by the method of Biber et al. The kidneys from 6 to 8 rats (200 to 250 g) were removed and the cortex was cut off each kidney as a layer about 1 mm thick. The kidneys were taken up in 30 ml of ice-cold 12 mM Tris/HC1 buffer (pH 7.4)/300 mM mannitoi and homogenized with an Ultraturrax shaft (level 180 V) for4 x 30 seconds while cooling in ice. Addition of 42 ml of ice-cold distilled water was followed by addition of 850 (ul of a 1M MgCI2 solution. Incubation at 0Â°C for 15 minutes was followed by centrifugation at 4 500 rpm (Sorvall SS-34 rotor) for 15 minutes. The precipitate was discarded, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 16 000 rpm for 30 minutes. Resuspension of the precipitate in 60 ml of 6 mM Tris/HCI buffer (pH 7.4)/150 mM mannitol/2.5 mM EGTA by 10 strokes in a Potter-Elvejhem homogenizer (900 rpm) and addition of 720 |il of 1 mM MgCI2 solution was followed by incubation at 0Â°C for 15 minutes. The supernatant resulting after centrifugation at 4 500 rpm (SS-34 rotor) for 15 minutes was centrifuged at 16 000 rpm for 30 minutes. The supernatant was homogenized by 10 strokes in 60 ml of 20 mM Tris/Hepes buffer (pH 7.4)/280 mM mannitoi, and the resulting.suspension was then centrifuged at 20 000 rpm for 30 minutes. The precipitate was resuspended in 20 mM Tris/HCI buffer (pH 7.4)/280 mM mannitoi using a tuberculin syringe with a 27 gauge needle and was adjusted to a protein concentration of 20 mg/ml.<br>
Measurement of the glucose uptake by brush border membrane vesicles<br>
The uptake of [14C]-labeled glucose into brush border membrane vesicles was measured by the membrane filtration method. 10Âµl of the brush border membrane vesicle suspension in 10 mM Tris/Hepes buffer (pH 7.4)/300 mM mannitoi were added at 30Â°C to 90 Âµl of a solution of 10 |j.M [14C]D-glucose and the appropriate concentrations of the relevant inhibitors (5-200ÂµM) in 10 mM Tris/Hepes buffer (pH 7.4)/100 mM NaCI/100 mM mannitoi.<br>
After incubation for 15 seconds, the transport process was stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold stop solution (10 mM Tris/Hepes buffer (pH 7.4)/150 mM KCI) and the vesicle suspension was immediately filtered with suction through a cellulose nitrate<br><br>
membrane filter (0.45Âµm, 25 mm diameter, Schieiche- &amp; Schull) under a vacuum of from 25 to 35 mbar. The filter was washed with 5 ml c* ce-cold stop solution. Each measurement was carried out as duplicate or triplicate determination. To measure the uptake of radiolabeled substrates, the membrane fiiter wvas dissolved in 4 ml of an appropriate scintillator (Quickszint 361, Zinsser Anaiyr-s GmbH, Frankfurt am Main), and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintilla: on measurement. The measured values were obtained as dpm (decompositicns per minute) after calibration of the instrument using standard samples and after correction for any chemiluminescence present. )<br>
