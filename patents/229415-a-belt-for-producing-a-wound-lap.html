				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a belt of an apparatus for winding up fibrous material which is present in the form of a non-woven material or a lap onto a core held in a rotationally movable manner in order to form a wound lap, with the belt which is provided with an endless arrangement being guided in a loop about the core and over several deflection rollers, of which at least one of said rollers is in connection with a drive and at least one further thereof is connected with a tensioning apparatus.<br>
Such a winding apparatus for producing a wound lap is known from EP-A2-878 568, with the wound lap being formed by using a flat belt. A loop of the belt is placed about a tube (core) which is rotatably held on a stationary shaft, which loop adjusts in its size with the increasing diameter of the wound lap and wraps nearly completely around the wound lap at the end of the winding process. In order to form the wound lap, a web is introduced between two deflection rollers into the loop of the belt and supplied to the surface of the tube.<br>
A lap disk is disposed on either side and coaxially to the tube in order to support the lateral edges of the web during the winding process. As a result of this support, clean face surfaces of the finished wound lap are formed during the winding. The belt guided between the lap disks is provided with a small distance to the inner face surfaces of said lap disks.<br>
In order to prevent any displacement of the belt between the lap disks and thus a jamming of fibers, it was proposed in this prior publication to provide a running surface of the belt with a profiling which engages in a counter-profiling of the deflection rollers. A lateral displacement of the belt between the lap disks was prevented with this measure. Fewer fibers were pulled out of the edge zones of the web, which also reduced the soiling of the belt, especially in the edge zone. It was managed to achieve an improvement of the formed face surfaces of the wound lap with this measure. However, bulges were still present in the edge zone of the wound lap which were produced by the system during the build-up of the wound lap. During the winding process the fiber material tends to yield to the edge zone of the wound lap or the lateral lap disks due to the pressing force produced by the belt. This leads to an increased counter-pressure on the edge zones of the belt in the edge zones of the wound lap which can lead to the consequence that the belt deforms in a wave-like manner in this zone. As a result, there<br><br>
are unevenly wound edge zones of the wound lap since the pressing pressure of the belt occurs unevenly on the outer layers of the wound lap in said edge zones.<br>
In order to prevent this effect (wave-like deformation of the belt), it was proposed in an as yet unpublished Swiss patent application CH-1105/00 of 5 June 2000 that the belt is provided in the zone of its outer ends (as seen in the longitudinal direction of the belt) with a lower extension than in the middle zone of the belt. It was proposed to incorporate further fiber strands (pulling strands) in the edge zone of the belt in order to especially prevent any bulging of the belt in the zone of the deflection points. Although this proposal led to improvements in the zone of the deflection points, and especially with respect to the deflection rollers, it did not solve the problem that occurs in the edge zone during the formation of the wound lap.<br>
The invention is now based on the object of avoiding the described disadvantages of known solutions and to propose means with which it is possible to produce a wound lap with clean and even edge sections which is wound up on a machine forming a wound lap by using a belt.<br>
For the process of subsequent further processing on the combing machine it is necessary to supply an even wound lap with a web which is even as seen over the width. In order to achieve this object it is proposed that the belt of an apparatus for winding up fibrous material is provided with a bending modulus of higher than 243 MPa transversally to its longitudinal direction. Preferably, the bending modulus can be between 250 and 330 MPa (Mega Pascal).<br>
The bending modulus can be equated with the modulus of elasticity and is a relevant factor in determining the bending or flexural stiffness of the belt.<br>
The bending stiffness of a specimen of the belt which is clamped on one side is obtained from the following formula:<br><br>
With c = bending stiffness, L = length of specimen; E = bending modulus; I = geometrical moment of inertia of the specimen.<br><br>
By using such a belt it is prevented as a result of the thus resulting bending stiffness that a yielding of the belt occurs into the edge zone of the wound lap to be formed. This also prevents the wave-like deformation of the belt in this zone. The belt can thus be arranged in such a way that the forces of reaction produced by the material displacement can be absorbed over the entire width of the belt structure.<br>
In order to ensure a smooth deflection of the belt on the deflection rollers despite the increased bending or buckling stiffness in the transversal direction, it is proposed further that the bending modulus in the longitudinal direction of the belt is smaller than in its transversal direction. The bending modulus can be between 200 and 280 MPa in this case.<br>
Preferably, a composite belt is proposed for the belt which is provided with at least one tensile layer which is embedded between two fabric or plastic layers. The three described layers are rigidly and undetectably connected with each other.<br>
The tensile layer through which the tensile force applied on the belt is transmitted can be made for example of one or more layers or strands of plastic, preferably of polyamide.<br>
The fabric or plastic layers can be made of a polyamide fabric for example which are used especially to absorb or compensate the forces of reaction arising in the edge zone of the wound lap. It is proposed further to provide at least one surface of the belt with a layer resistant to wear and cutting. It can be made of polyurethane for example and is used to increase the service life of the belt and to prevent any adherence of fibers. In order to ensure a favorable guidance of the belt about the deflection rollers it is proposed further to provide adjacently to one of the fabric layers an elastic carrier layer made of rubber or caoutchouc for example which is covered with a further fabric layer made of plastic material.<br>
For the lateral guidance of the belt in the zone between the lap disks it is proposed to apply a layer onto the further fabric layer which is provided with a profiling. Said profiling, which can be made of polyurethane for example, can cooperate with a respective counter-profile of the deflection rollers from which the belt loop extends downwardly and thus ensure the lateral guidance.<br><br>
As a result of the bending modulus as proposed in accordance with the invention and of thus achieving a high buckling stiffness it is possible, instead of the described profiling, to provide additional guide elements for lateral guidance on which the edge zones of the belt can rest without any yielding or buckling of the belt occurring transversally to the conveying direction.<br>
Rotationally movable arranged rollers can be used as guide elements whose rotational shafts are disposed in a plane which intersects with the belt surface at an angle of approx. 90°. Further advantages of the invention are now explained and described in closer detail by reference to the following embodiments shown in the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>

g. 2:	shows a schematic sectional view of the winding apparatus in the zone of the lap disks;<br>

Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of a winding apparatus 10 for producing a wound lap 12. Principally, such a winding apparatus 10 can be used to wind up a non-woven material, a fibrous web or a lap made of fiber material into a roll before the fiber material is subjected to further processing in subsequent processing stages. Thus, the winding apparatus can be used in a combing room for receiving a non-woven material coming from a drafting arrangement via reversing plates, calendar rollers and/or the like, with the produced wound lap then being supplied to a combing machine for further processing. Reference is merely made to a lap hereinafter in connection with the supplied fiber material, which shall not be understood as limiting in any way however.<br>
The winding apparatus 10 is supplied with a lap 14 via a lap feed 16 which in the present case is<br>
formed by a guide plate which extends in a downwardly bent manner on	<br><br>
the exit side. The lap 14 is wound up on a tube H which is used as a core, which bobbin is rotatably held about a fixed shaft A. Said tube H is driven by a revolving endless belt 18 which forms a loop 20 between two deflection rollers R1 and R2 in which the tube H is received.<br>
In the present case, the wound lap 12 is driven by the belt 18 in a counter-clockwise manner, as Is indicated by the arrow F. The loop 20 of belt 18 which wraps around the wound lap 12 becomes larger with the increasing wound lap 12, with the belt 18 being tensioned by a tensioning device 22 during the entire winding process. Said tensioning device 22 comprises a tension roller R4 which is displaceable held via a tensioning element (e.g. one or two cylinders; not shown in closer detail) in a linear guidance means 24.<br>
The belt 18 is guided via further deflection rollers R3 and R5 and the tension roller R4 which is adjustable linear guide means 24 in such a way that it is tensioned via tension roller R4 in a plane which is parallel to the plane containing the axes of the two deflection rollers R1 and R2. Fig. 1 shows the axis on which the tension roller R4 is held adjustably as the X-axis.<br>
The deflection rollers R1, R2 and R5 are held stationarily in a rotatable manner, whereas the deflection roller R2 is held swivel ably via a swivel arm 26 about the axis of the deflection roller R5. This swiveling movement (indicated with the arrow) is used for ejecting the finished wound lap 12. In order to monitor the formation of the wound lap a sensor 30 is attached which initiates the ejection process. The signals of the sensor 30 are sent via a line SI to a central control unit.<br>
Fig. 1 further shows a monitoring sensor 40 which monitors the feed of lap 14 to the loop 20. The lap 14 is supplied to the tube H within the loop 20 at the feed point 42. During the feeding process of the lap a pressure below atmospheric is produced in the interior on the tube H which is provided with a perforation 3 (fig. 4) in order to securely apply the first layer. Further details on the mode of operation of this winding device are described in DE-A1-195 39 365, with reference being hereby made thereto.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a sectional view of the winding apparatus 10 according to fig. 1 in the zone of the bobbin clamping of the tube H. One of the two deflection rollers R2 is shown from which a belt loop 20 extends downwardly for the formation of the wound lap. A schematically indicated web 14 is transferred to the circumferential zone of a tube H on<br><br>
the belt 18 which is deflected downwardly via the roller R2. The tube H is provided on its outer circumference with openings 3 which are shown in fig. 4, which openings are connected with the interior space of the tube, on which - as has already been described - a pressure below atmospheric is applied during the start-winding process. The tube H is clamped via noses 11 and 13 between two stationarily held and horizontally displaceable lap disks 7 and 8. The lap disks 7, 8 are held rotatably via the shafts A. As is also shown in fig. 2, a web 14 for forming a wound lap 12 has already been wound up on the tube H. The belt 18 can be provided with a toothed profile 15 which is shown in fig. 7 for example. Said toothed profile engages in a respective profile (not shown in closer detail) of the deflection rollers R2 + R1, so that the lateral guidance of the belt 18 with respect to the lap disks 7, 8 is ensured. This means that the intended distance a from the lateral edges S of the belt 18 to the face surfaces SF of the lap disks 7, 8 remains constant during the entire winding process. Merely the width B of the web 14 increases as a result of the applied pressing pressure PD via the belt 18, so that the outer edges of the web 14 come to lie on the inner face surfaces SF of the lap disk 7, 8, as is shown in closer detail in fig. 4 for example.<br>
Fig. 4 shows an enlarged partial view according to fig. 2. Four layers of wound lap 14 have already been wound up on the tube 14. The more individual layers of lap 14 are wound up on the bobbin H, the more the fiber material has the tendency, as a result of the pressing force PD exerted by belt 18, to shift in the lateral direction, as is indicated by the arrow W, towards the face surfaces SF of the lap disks 8 and 7, respectively. This leads to the forces of reaction P by the fiber material as indicated in fig. 3 with the curve KP, which forces are increased in the edge zones RB (fig. 3) as a result of the described effect. In the middle zone MB the force of reaction by the fiber material remains approximately constant. These increased forces of reaction by the fiber material in the edge zones RB need to be absorbed especially by the belt 18 in cooperation with the face surfaces SF of the lap disks. If belt 18 is not provided with sufficient bending stiffness, the edge zone RB will bend up to the position as shown in fig. 4 with the broken line. This bending effect will lead to the deformation of the belt in the longitudinal direction in a wave-like manner in said edge zones RB, so that an uneven pressing force arises through the belt on the outermost winding layer of lap 14 in said edge zones RB. This leads to an uneven lap position of the formed wound lap 12 in its edge zones RB.<br>
As is shown schematically in fig. 4 through arrows DK and ZK, a tensile force ZK is produced by the force of reaction P in the zone of the contact surface of the belt on its<br><br>
inner side and a pressure force DK on the surface of belt 18 which is averted from the lap 14. If the belt 18 (as claimed in accordance with the invention) is provided with a respective bending modulus transversally to its longitudinal direction, the arising forces can be absorbed by the belt 18 also in said edge zones, so that there is no bulging (as shown with the broken line). This means that the belt must be configured in such a way that the arising forces DK, ZK can be absorbed or compensated over the entire width of the belt 18. Embodiments of such belts are shown in the following figures 5 through 7. Fig. 5 shows a cross section of a belt 18, with a tensile layer 33 being provided which, as is shown schematically, can consist of individual layers 34 (made of polyamide for example) which are laid above one another. The tensile layer, which is used especially for transmitting the applied tensile force, is enclosed on both sides by a fabric layer 36 which can also be made of a polyamide material. These two fabric layers 36 are used in particular to ensure the bending stiffness of the belt 18 transversally to the longitudinal direction L so as to absorb the forces ZK, DK arising in fig. 4.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a further embodiment of a belt 18. A layer 38 made of rubber is attached to the lower fabric layer 36, which layer 38 is connected with a further fabric layer 36a. This rubber layer 38 ensures in particular that the belt 18 can be deflected and guided securely on the deflection rollers. This embodiment can also ensure a respective bending stiffness transversally to the longitudinal direction L of the belt 18 in order to absorb the forces as described above.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a further embodiment of a belt 18 which corresponds substantially to the embodiment according to fig. 6. A further layer 44 is disposed below the fabric layer 36a, which further layer is provided with a toothed profile 15 extending in the longitudinal direction L of the belt 18. The layer 44 can be formed of polyurethane for example. The belt is guided with the toothed profile 15 on the deflection roller R2 for example which is provided with a respective counter profile on its circumference in which the toothed profile 15 engages. As a result, the belt 18 can be guided precisely in its lateral position.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a further possibility of a lateral belt guidance which can be used especially when the belt 18 is not provided with any additional lateral guiding means according to the embodiment shown in fig. 7. As a result of the proposed bending modulus and the thus achieved bending and buckling stiffness in the transversal direction of the bend, it is possible to laterally guide the belt 18 on its lateral edges S via rotatably held rollers 46, 47. The rollers 46 and 47 are rotatably held in supports 48 which are connected with<br><br>
the frame of the winding apparatus 10. As is indicated by the oblong holes in the supports 48 as shown in broken lines, the rollers 47, 48 are adjustably fastened in the horizontal direction on the support 48 with respect to the lateral edges S of the belt 18. In this way it is possible to optimally set the horizontal position of the rollers 47, 48 with respect to the lateral edges S of the belt 18. In the shown arrangement according to fig. 8, said lateral guiding means is attached shortly before the deflection roller R2. It is also possible, however, to attach said lateral guiding means also at other locations of the winding apparatus 10. The lateral guidance could also occur by attaching small revolving guide leather tapes which are guided on the rollers 47 or 48 and one further roller.<br>
Fig. 9 shows a perspective side of a roller 46, 47, with the belt 18 being guided approximately in the middle with respect to the width of the roller. It is also possible to provide profiled rollers instead of a roller with a smooth surface in which the lateral edges S of the belt 18 are guided in a respective manner. If the wear ability of the lateral edges S of belt 18 are not impaired, it is also possible to provide fixed lateral guide means. The shafts Y of the rollers 46 and 47 are situated in a plane E which intersects the plane of surface OB of belt 18 at an angle of approx. 90°.<br>
The proposed arrangement of the belt ensures on the one hand the formation of a homogeneous wound lap also in its edge zones. The lateral guidance of the belt can be performed by respective elements without producing any yielding or upward bending of the belt in its edge zones RB.<br><br><br>
