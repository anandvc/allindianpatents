				<td>IMIDAZOLIDINONYL AMINOPYRIMIDINE COMPOUNDS FOR THE TREATMENT OF CANCER<br><br>
-1-<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
Plkl belongs to a small family of protein kinases characterized by a phosphoserine/threonine binding domain known as the polo box domain. Plkl plays a central role in the regulation of the cell cycle. Among other functions, Plkl is thought to regulate initiation, progression, and exit from mitosis, the stage when cancer cells divide. Consequently, blocking Plkl in cancer cells prevents their division or mitosis.<br><br>
Potent anticancer agents have been identified that interfere with mitosis such as the vinca alkaloids (NAVELBINE®), taxoids (TAXOTERE®) and topoisomerase II inhibitors (ADRIAMYCIN®). VELCADE® is an antineoplastic agent that inhibits the 26S proteosome. However, these drugs cause considerable side effects upon normal, non-dividing cells. PIk inhibitors specifically target dividing cells and may be able to avoid the undesirable toxicities. Inhibitors of Plkl are known in the art. See for example, WO 06/066172.<br><br>
Additionally, WO 06/021548 discloses certain dihydropteridinone analogs (e.g., BI-2536) as inhibitors of Plkl. Currently, BI-2536 is in phase II clinical trials but has high clearance (CL &gt;1000 mL/min) and is dose limited by myelosupression in man. There is still a need for further compounds that inhibit Plkl which possess improved potency or pharmacokinetic properties. It would also be advantageous to have a Plkl inhibitor that could be dosed orally.<br><br>
The present invention provides novel imidazolidinonyl aminopyrimidine compounds believed to have clinical use for treatment of cancer through inhibiting Plkl. Certain of these compounds are believed to have improved potency over compounds disclosed in WO 06/066172. Additionally, certain of these compounds are believed to have improved pharmacokinetic properties over BI-2536. Further, due to the oral bioavailability of the compounds of the present invention that were tested, it is believed that certain of these compounds could be dosed orally.<br><br>

SCHEMES<br><br>
The skilled artisan will appreciate that not all of the substituents in the compounds of the present invention will tolerate certain reaction conditions employed to synthesize the compounds. These moieties may be introduced at a convenient point in the synthesis, or may be protected and then deprotected as necessary or desired. The skilled artisan will appreciate that the protecting groups may be removed at any convenient point in the synthesis of the compounds of the present invention. Methods for introducing and removing nitrogen and oxygen protecting groups are well known in the art; see, for example, Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Ed., John Wiley and Sons, New York, Chapter 7 (1999). Furthermore, the skilled artisan will appreciate that in many circumstances, the order in which moieties are introduced is not critical. The particular order of steps required to produce the compounds of the present invention <br><br>
-5-<br><br>
can be dependent upon the particular compound being synthesized, the starting compound, and the relative lability of the substituted moieties.<br><br>
Compounds of the present invention can be prepared by carrying out at least two variants discussed below. In the schemes below all substituents, unless otherwise indicated, are as previously defined and suitable reagents are well known and appreciated in the art. In Scheme 2, Y is halo and Z is boronic acid.<br><br>
Scheme 1<br><br>
A compound of Formula (1) is reacted with 2-(amino-ethyl)-l,3-dihydro- imidazol-one (2) to give a compound of Formula (5) via a nucleophilic displacement reaction. Such reactions are carried out in a suitable solvent, such as w-butanol, dioxane, N-methylpyrolidin-2-one (?MP), and the like. Generally, the reactions are carried out at temperatures of from about 120 0C to 150 0C using an oil bath or a microwave reactor. Typical stoichiometry for this reaction is based on the compound of Formula (3) and about 2 equivalents of 2-(amino-ethyl)-l,3-dihydro-imidazol-one are used. Amine bases, such as triethyl amine, diisopropylethyl amine, and the like, can be used.<br><br>
Scheme 2<br><br><br>
(3) (4) <br><br>
-6-<br><br>
A compound of Formula (3) is reacted with a compound of Formula (4) in a Suzuki reaction using a suitable palladium catalyst, such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), [1,1 '- bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]dichloropalladium(II), and the like in the presence of a base, such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, and the like. Such reactions are carried out in a suitable solvent, such as THF, dioxane, water, and the like. Generally, the reactions are carried out at temperatures of from about 100 0C to 150 0C using an oil bath or a microwave reactor.<br><br>
In an optional step, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of the present invention is formed. The formation of such salts is well known and appreciated in the art.<br><br>
As will be readily appreciated compounds of Formulas (1) and (3) can be readily prepared by methods similar to those described herein by procedures that are well-known and established in the art. For example, compounds of Formula (1) are prepared by coupling an optionally substituted pyridinyl compound with an optionally substituted benzothiophenyl compound by Suzuki coupling methods, as described above. The resulting Suzuki adduct is boronylated by methods well known in the art and further coupled to an optionally substituted pyrimidine halide via Suzuki coupling methods, as described above. Compounds of Formula (3) are prepared by boronylation of an optionally substituted benzothiophenyl compound by methods well known in the art followed by addition of 2-(amino-ethyl)-l,3-dihydro-imidazol-one (2) to the resulting boronic acid/ester via nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Also, it is recognized that the steps required to prepare a compound of Formula (1) or (3) can be carried out in any order including reaction of a partial compound of Formula (1) or (3) with a compound of Formula (2) and/or Formula (4), such that the later carried out carbon-carbon bond formation, coupling reaction, etc, provide a compound of the present invention.<br><br>
The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples and preparations. These examples and preparations are illustrative only and are not intended to limit the invention in any way. The terms used in the examples and preparations have their normal meanings unless otherwise designated. The example compounds below were named using ChemDraw®, Version 10. <br><br>

Furthermore, Plkl expression has prognostic significance in non-small cell lung, oropharyngeal, oesophageal, melanoma, colorectal, hepatoblastoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma cancers (Strebhardt, K. and A. Ullrich<br><br>
(2006). Nature Reviews Cancer 6(4): 321-30). Plkl phosphorylated substrates regulate progression of mitosis by coordinating centrosome maturation, entry into mitosis, sister chromatid separation and cytokinesis (Eckerdt and Strebhardt 2006; Strebhardt and Ullrich 2006; van de Weerdt, B. C. and R. H. Medema (2006). Cell Cycle 5(8): 853-64). Inhibiting Plkl function using antibody injection, expression of a dominant negative Plkl, and antisense mRNA reduction produces monopole spindles and anaphase arrest leading to mitotic cell death in tumor cell lines but reversible G2 arrest in normal non- transformed primary cell lines.<br><br>
Additionally, it has been reported that PIk may be useful m the treatment of rhabdoid tumors, (M?rozov A., et ah, Clinical Cancer Research. 13(16Y.472.1-30, (Aug 15, 20071<br><br>
BI-2536 has demonstrated activity in preclinical models using HCTl 16, A549 and NCIH460 murine xenografts (Baum, A., P. Garin-Chesa, et al. (2006). #C191 In vivo activity of BI 2536, a potent and selective inhibitor of the mitotic kinase PLKl, in a range of cancer xenografts. AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on "Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics", Philidelphia, PA).<br><br>
The results of the following assays demonstrate evidence that the compounds of the present invention are useful as anticancer agents.<br><br>
Expression and purification of Plkl.<br><br>
Human Plkl cDNA, which may be obtained from a number of sources, such as Incyte (accession number: NM_005030), may be directly linked at one of its termini with <br><br>
-33-<br><br>
a polynucleotide sequence expressing a Hisß tag, such as the C-terminal FLAG-Hisß tag, and inserted into an appropriate expression vector, such as a pFastBac™ vector (Invitrogen) and transfected into an appropriate system, such as baculovirus similar to what has been reported by Yue-Wei Qian, et al, Science 282, 1701 (1998) for xPlkkl. If a viral expression system is used, then the virus (e.g., baculovirus bearing a Plkl-Flag- Hisß tag polynucleotide construct) is infected into a culture of a suitable host cell, such as Sf9 cells. When sufficient amounts of the Plkl-Flag-Hisß tag fusion protein have been expressed, for example, at about 46 hours after infection, the culture should be treated with okadaic acid (0.1 µM) for a sufficient period of time (e.g., 3 hours). The Plkl-Flag- Hisß tag fusion is purified from cell pellets using a metal affinity resin, such as TALON™ (Clontech, Catalog# 635503) using methods well known in the art. Purified Plkl-Flag- Hisß tag fusion is stored in a suitable medium, such as 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.01% TRITON® X-100, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 % glycerol, pH 7.5, at -80 0C in small aliquots until use. The identity of the purified Plkl-Flag-Hisß tag fusion protein is confirmed by MALDI (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization).<br><br>
Expression and purification of GST-Cdc25C(l-206).<br><br>
Human Cdc25C cDNA, which may be obtained from any appropriate source, such as Incyte (accession number: AY497474), may be expressed in any convenient expression system, after which purification is effected by well known methods similar to that described by Bin Ouyang et al, Oncogene, 18, 6029 -6036 (1999). One convenient system involves overnight growth at 18 0C of E.coli BL21 tranformed with the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham) into which the cDNA for human Cds25C has been engineered for induced expression using 1 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside. The expressed GST-Cdc25C(l-206), the substrate for Plkl, may be purified by GLUTATHIONE<br><br>
SEPHAROSE® 4B and stored in an appropriate solution, such as 10 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 in small aliquots at -80 0C.<br><br>
Plkl Inhibition Assay Plkl kinase reactions contain Plkl-Flag-Hisß tag fusion enzyme (0.2 ng/µL) in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 1.0 mM dithiothreitol, 5.0 µM ATP, 10 mM<br><br>
MgCl2, 0.01% TRITON® X-100, 0.4 µCi 33P_ATP, and 0.06 µg/µL GST-Cdc25c (1- <br><br>
-34-<br><br>
206) peptide. Compounds are provided as 10 mM stocks in DMSO. Compounds are serially diluted 1:3 in 20 % DMSO to create a 10-point concentration-response curve and subsequently are diluted 1:5 (20 µM to 0.001 µM final in 4 % final DMSO concentration) in the reaction mixture to determine compound activity. The reaction is carried out at room temperature for 60 min and then quenched by adding 60 µL of 10.0 % H3PO4. The reaction mixture (85 µL) is transferred to a 96 well phosphocellulose filter plate pre- wetted with 30 µL of 10.0 % H3PO4, incubated at room temperature for 20-30 min and then washed 3X with 0.5 % H3PO4. Wells are dried before addition of 40 µL of MicroScintTM20 (Packard) and then counted on a Wallac MICROBETA ® Jet. The percentage inhibition values from the 10-point concentration response data are subsequently analyzed, for example, using ACTIVITY BASE™ software (IDBS), using a 4-parameter logistic equation. Absolute IC50 values are calculated from the resulting curve fit. All exemplified compounds have an IC50 less than 100 nM with a Minimum Significant Ratio (MSR) of 3.6. For example, Example 13 has an IC50 of about 23 nM.<br><br>
pHH3(S10), mitotic cells, and DNA content Assays<br><br>
HeLa Cells from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) are plated at 200 cells/well in 96 well Beckman Dickinson BIOCO AT™ plates, and are incubated in MEM (Minimum Essential Medium, e.g., GIBCO, catalog #11095) with 10% FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum) in 37 0C, 5 % CO2 for 24 hours. Cells are treated by adding compound (in 0.25 % DMSO) to the medium, dosing at 10 points across the range 0.5 µM to 0.0098 µM. After 23 hours exposure to the compounds, cells are fixed, for example with the PREFER™ fixative [Anatech LTD., Catalog #414] for 30 min then are permeablized with 0.1% TRITON® XlOO in phospate buffered saline (PBS) solution for 15 min. Cells are washed 3 times with PBS then digested with 50 µg/mL RNAse. Primary antibody, phosphohistone H3 (Upstate Cat#06-570), is added at 1 :500 in PBS with 1 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) to the cells over night at 4 0C. After 3 PBS washes, cells are incubated with Alexa488 labeled secondary antibody (Invitrogen cat # Al 1008) for 1 hour at room temperature. Again they are washed 3 times with PBS, and then 15 µM propidium iodide (Molecular Probes cat # P3566) is added for 30 min to stain nuclei. Fluorescence Plates are scanned with ACUMEN EXPLORER™ [Laser-scanning fluorescence microplate cytometer (comprising of 488 nm argon ion laser excitation and <br><br>
-35-<br><br>
multiple photomultiplier tube detection), manufactured by TTP LABTECH LTD] to measure phosphohistone H3, DNA content and mitotic cells as measured by DNA condensation. Image analyses are based on cellular fluorescent signals for identifying cells in different subpopulations. pHH3(S10) positive cells are identified by mean intensity at 500-530 nm above the threshold. Total intensity at 655-705 nm from propidium iodide/DNA is used to identify individual cells (cells with DNA content from 2N to 4N) and subpopulations in cell cycle (2N cells, 4N cells). Peak intensity at 575-640 nm is used to identify DNA condensation that is used as the marker to identify mitotic cells among 4N cells. Assay outputs are percentage of each identified subpopulations, %pHH3, % 2N, %4N, %mitotic and total cell number. The EC50 is determined by curve fitting to a four parameter logistic for each output using ACTIVITY BASE™. The resulting EC50S for PHH3(sl0), DNA content, and mitotic have an MSR of 2.6, 2.4 and 2.5, respectively. For example, Example 13 has a pHH3(sl0) EC50 = 42 nM (n=2), DNA content EC50 = 40 nM (n=2) and mitotic EC50 = 45 nM (n=l).<br><br>
Antiproliferative Assay.<br><br>
The effects of compounds on cell proliferation can be determined using cells and cell proliferation methods well-known in the art (Robert C. Squatrito et ah, Gynecological Oncology, 58, 101-105, (1995)). For example, HCTl 16 cells, which may be obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, may be seeded at -2000 cells/well in 96-well plates and allowed to attach overnight in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37 0C. Following the 20-24 hour incubation, half-log serially diluted compounds are added and the plates are returned to the incubator. After an appropriate length of exposure (e.g., 72 hours), cell proliferation is estimated using well-known methods. In one method, 10 µL of a tetrazolium salt, such as Alamar Blue™ is added to the cell plates. After an appropriate exposure to the dye, fluorescence (530 nm excitation, 580 nm emission) is determined. The resulting ICsohas an MSR of 3.1. For example, Example 13 has an IC50 of 11 nM (n=3).<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention are preferably formulated as pharmaceutical compositions administered by a variety of routes. Most preferably, such compositions are for oral administration. Such pharmaceutical compositions and <br><br>
-36-<br><br>
processes for preparing same are well known in the art. See, e.g., REMINGTON: THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF PHARMACY (A. Gennaro, et al, eds., 19th ed., Mack Publishing Co., 1995).<br><br>
The compounds of Formula I are generally effective over a wide dosage range. For example, dosages per day normally fall within the range of about 0.01 to about 20 mg/kg of body weight, more preferably 0.1 to 20 mg/kg of body weight. In some instances dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, and therefore the above dosage range is not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. It will be understood that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound or compounds administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, and the severity of the patient's symptoms. <br><br>
