				<td>AUTOMATIC TRANSFER SWITCH<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to electrical switches and, more particularly, to<br>
automatic transfer switches.<br>
Many businesses use transfer switches for switching power sources, for example,<br>
from a public utility source to a private secondary supply, automatically within a<br>
matter of seconds Critical load businesses, such as, for example, hospitals, airport<br>
radar towers, high volume data centers are dependent upon automatic transfer<br>
switches to provide continuous power. Transfer switches typically utilize a plurality<br>
of contacts that can be open or closed.<br>
Typically, it is desired that a transfer switch remain closed during a fault or<br>
overcurrent condition. During a fault condition, a large and quick influx of electrical<br>
energy causes a blow open force between the contacts. Therefore, if not locked<br>
together, the contacts will interfere with upstream protection (i.e. circuit breakers)<br>
and upset coordination between devices. Known transfer switches incorporate a<br>
"toggle" locking of an external mechanism to keep the switch closed during a fault<br>
condition. However, this external locking is distant from the contacts of the switch<br>
and, accordingly, a play exists in the structure between the lock and the contacts.<br>
This play and a shaft torque allow the contacts to separate slightly during a fault<br>
condition due to the blow open force. When the contacts are separated slightly, an<br>
arcing across the contacts occurs damaging the contacts.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect, a method for locking contacts in an automatic transfer switch is<br>
provided. The automatic transfer switch includes a plurality of pole units including a<br>
plurality of contact pairs. The method includes mounting an interior linking device<br><br>
in at least one pole unit and locking at least one contact pair individually with the<br>
interior locking device housed in that contact pair's pole unit.<br>
In another aspect, a pole unit for an automatic transfer switch is provided. The pole<br>
unit includes a housing, a load lug housed in the housing, and an interior locking<br>
device mounted in the housing to electrically couple to the load lug in a first position<br>
and in a second position. The pole unit further includes a plurality of source lugs<br>
including a first source lug and a second source lug mounted in the housing, wherein<br>
each source lug is electrically isolated from each other and the load lug, and the<br>
interior locking device is configured to electrically couple at least one of the first<br>
source lug and the second source lug to the load lug.<br>
In another aspect, an automatic transfer switch is provided. The automatic transfer<br>
switch includes a plurality of pole units including a bore therethrough, wherein the<br>
housing units are connected with the bores aligned. The switch further includes at<br>
least one interior locking device mounted in at least one of the units, the interior<br>
locking device comprising a bore therethrough, wherein the bore of the locking<br>
device is aligned with the bores of the units. The automatic transfer switch further<br>
includes an end wall comprising a bore aligned with the bores of the units and a shaft<br>
axially mounted in the interior locking device bore and the housing unit bore. The<br>
shaft extends through the end wall and includes an extended portion, and a flywheel is<br>
mounted on the extended portion of the shaft.<br>
In a further aspect, a pole unit for an automatic transfer switch includes a housing and<br>
at least one of a dual disk and a conjugate cam mounted in the housing. The<br>
conjugate cam has a tri-lobal shape and is within a conductor assembly. The dual<br>
disk includes a driving disk and a driven disk, wherein the driving disk includes a<br>
cammed surface configured to engage at least one locking tab.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE IN VENT1ON<br>
Figure 1 is an exploded perspective view of a dual disk 10 including a driving disk 12<br>
and a driven disk 14 including a plurality of chambers 16 sized to receive a plurality<br>
of resilient members 18 Driving disk 12 includes a first centering finger 20 that is<br>
positioned in a first gap 22 between a first resilient member 24 and a second resilient<br>
member 26 when dual disk 10 is assembled Driving disk 12 further includes a<br>
second centering finger (not shown) opposite first centering finger 20 that is<br>
positioned in a second gap (not shown) between a thud resilient member 28 and a<br>
fourth resilient member 30<br>
Driven disk 14 further includes a plurality of slots 32 to receive a conductor 34 having<br>
a plurality of contacts 36 mounted thereon Slots 32 are in flow communication via a<br>
plurality of arcuate channels 38 Conductor 34 includes a first member 40 and a<br>
second member 42 that is substantially identical to first member 40 and is attached to<br>
first member 40. First member 40 includes a first end portion 44 and extends from<br>
first end portion 44 substantially in a first plane to a first bend 46 and then extends<br>
arcuately to a second bend 48 after which first member 40 extends in the first plane to<br>
a second end portion 50<br>
First member 40 is attached to second member 42 such that arcuate sections of<br>
members 40 and 42 form a substantially circuiat opening 51 Each end portion 44<br>
and SO has a contact 36 mounted thereon Driving disk 12 further includes a<br>
polygonal shaped bore to receive a shaft (not shown). The bore is defined by a<br>
plurality of inner walls 54. In an exemplary embodiment, the polygonal shaped bore<br>
is a hexagonal shaped bore. Inner walls 54 extend radially outward to a cylindrical<br><br>
surface 56 which extends longitudinally from a bottoin surface (not shown) of driving<br>
disk 12 forming a cylinder 58 Driven disk 14 includes a substantially circular bore<br>
60 to receive cylinder 58.<br>
During operation of an assembled dual disk 10 a rotation of the shall exerts a<br>
rotational force on inner walls 54 causing driving disk 12 to rotate. First and second<br>
centering fingers 20 exert a rotational force on resilient members 18 causing driven<br>
disk 14 and conductor 34 to rotate When any particular contact 36 on conductor 34<br>
contacts an object, conductor 34 stops rotating while driving disk 12 continues to<br>
rotate and, depending upon direction of rotation, either first and third resilient<br>
members 24 and 28 are compressed or second and fourth resilient members 26 and 30<br>
are compressed causing a biasing of that particular contact against the object. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, resilient members 18 are springs.<br>
Figure 2 is a perspective view of a pole unit 80 with dual disk 10 (shown in Figure 1)<br>
positioned therein. Pole unit 80 includes a first source lug 82, a second source lug 84,<br>
and a load lug 86 electrically connected to a first load contact 88 and a second load<br>
contact 90. Pole unit 80 further includes a first source contact 92 electrically<br>
connected to first source lug 82 and a second source contact (not shown) electrically<br>
connected to second source lug 84 Conductor 34 includes a first contact 94. a second<br>
contact 96, a third contact 98. and a fourth contact 100 mounted thereon Pole unit 80<br>
further includes a housing 95 including a first slot 97 substantially adjacent first<br>
source lug 82, a second slot 99 substantially adjacent second source lug 84. and a<br>
third slot 101 substantially adjacent load lug 86 Housing 95 is fabricated from non-<br>
conductive material and electrically isolates first source lug 82, second source lug 84.<br>
and load lus 86.<br>
During operation of pole unit 80 a shaft (not shown) passes through bore 52 (shown<br>
in Figure 1) and a bore (not shown) of pole unit 80 When the shaft is rotated to a<br>
first position (not shown in Figure 2), dual disk 10 rotates clockwise and first contact<br>
94 contacts first source contact 92 forming a first contact pair with a slight wiping<br>
motion which causes an abrading of the surfaces (not shown) of first contact 94 and<br>
first source contact 92 Approximately simultaneously with forming the first contaci.<br><br>
third contact 98 contacts second load contact 90 forming a second contact pair with a<br>
slight wiping motion which causes an abrading of the surfaces (not shown) of third<br>
contact 98 and second load contact 90.<br>
After first and second contact pairs are formed, driven disk 14 remains substantially<br>
stationary but driving disk 12 continues to rotate causing first and third resilient<br>
members 24 and 28 to compress individually locking first and second contact pairs in<br>
their contacted positions In an alternative embodiment, dual disk 10 includes a<br>
cammed surface 102 that locks by engaging a plurality of locking labs (not shown)<br>
extending from a back side 104 of pole unit 80 and a terminal plate (not shown in<br>
Figure 2). Beneath cammed surface 102 is a cammed resilient member (not shown)<br>
that allows cammed surface 102 to be depressed slightly and biased back to an<br>
uncompressed position after the locking tab clears a raised cam portion !06 of<br>
cammed surface 102. In an exemplary embodiment the cammed resilient member is<br>
a wave washer. Slots 97, 99, and 101 provide for overpressure relief during a fault<br>
condition by allowing heated gases to escape pole unit 80 without enhancing ingress<br>
of foreign material.<br>
Figure 3 is a perspective view of an automatic: transfer switch 120 including a<br>
plurality of pole units 80 (shown in Figure 2) Pole units 80 are positioned such that<br>
bores 52 of their respective dual disks 10 are aligned and a shaft (not shown) extends<br>
from a first side 122 of switch 120 through bores 52 ro a second side 124 of switch<br>
120. The shaft extends from first side 122 to a flywheel 126 that is biased in a first<br>
position by a switch resilient member 128<br>
In an exemplary embodiment switch resilient member 128 is a spring Flywheel 126<br>
is connected to a solenoid 130 that is controlled by a controller (not shown)<br>
electrically connected to a limit switch !32 Solenoid 130 includes a plunger 134<br>
First side 122 includes a termination plate 136 including at least one locking tab on an<br>
interior side (not shown) of termination plate Because each pole unit 80 has a back<br>
side 104 including at least one locking tab, and termination plate ! 36 has a locking<br>
tab in conjunction with the stacked axial placement of each pole unit 80. each<br>
cammed surface 102 is positioned against a surface having at least one locking tab<br><br>
Accordingly, each contact pair is locked in close proximity to the contact pair by an<br>
interior locking device. Dual disc 10 is interior to pole unit 80 and locks the contact<br>
pairs together and, according!) dual disc 10 is an interior locking device Since an<br>
interior locking device locks the contact pairs, as parts wear out and play develops,<br>
the contact pairs maintain rigid contact together<br>
In operation, transfer switch 120 receives electrical power from first source lugs 82<br>
and delivers that power to load iugs 86 under normal operating conditions, first<br>
source contact 92 contacts first contact 94 forming a first contact pair and first load<br>
contact 88 contacts third contact 98 forming a second contact pair The contact pairs<br>
are locked together by resitrent members 18 and by the engagement of cammed<br>
surface 102 with the locking labs.<br><br>
Accordingly, during a short or overload condition the pairs do not separate and no<br>
arcing occurs which can damage the contacts When the controller senses that the<br>
available power from first source lugs 82 is below a pre-set amount, the controller<br>
causes solenoid 130 to actuate causing plunger 134 to move linearly which causes<br>
flywheel 126 to rotate against switch resilient member 128 and breaiks the contact pair<br>
of first source contact 92 with first contact 94 and. nearly simultaneously, breaks the<br>
contact pair of first load contact 88 with third contact 98. As flywheel 126 continues<br>
to rotate, second contact 96 contacts the second source contact forming a third contact<br>
pair and, nearly simultaneously, fourth contact 100 contacts second load contact 90<br>
forming a fourth contact pair and restoring electrical power to load lug 86<br>
After the third and fourth contact pairs are formed flywheel 126 continues to rotate<br>
further and locks the third and fourth pairs together by compressing resilient members<br>
18 and engaging cammed surface 102 with the locking tabs. During a short or<br>
overcurrent condition when load lug 86 is electrically connected to second source tug<br>
84, the contacts are protected from damaging electrical arcs by dual disc 10 being an<br>
interior locking device. Accordingly, dual disc 10 is a cost-efficient and effective<br>
interior locking device which reduces the amount of play in an automatic transfer<br>
switch and, therefore, reduces damaging arcs providing for a long lasting and reliable<br>
automatic transfer switch<br><br>
Figure 4 is a perspective view of a pole unit 150 including a conjugate cam 152<br>
Conjugate cam 152 is shaped tri-lobal with three apexes 154 and three arcuate<br>
sections 156. Each arcuare section 156 extends between two apexes 154 Conjugate<br>
cam 152 further includes a shaft receiving section 158 proximate one apex 154 Shaft<br>
receiving section 158 includes a polygonal bore to receive a shaft (not shown) In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, the polygonal bore is a hexagonal bore.<br>
Pole unit 150 includes a first source lug 160. a second source lug 162 and a load lug<br>
164. Pole unit 150 further includes a housing 166 fabricated from a non-conductive<br>
material. Housing 166 electrically isolates first -source lug 160, second source lug<br>
162 and load lug 164 from each other Pole unit 150 further includes a first source<br>
contact 168 electrically connected to first source lug 160. a first load contact 170<br>
electrically connected to load lug 164, a second source contact 172 electrically<br>
connected to second source lug 162 and a second load contact 174 electrically<br>
connected to load lug 164.<br>
A contact assembly 176 is slideably mounted within pole unit 150. A first conductor<br>
178 and a second conductor 180 extend from assembly 176. First conductor 178 is<br>
electrically connecred rn second conductor 180 First conductor 178 includes, a first<br>
contact 182 and a second contact 184 mounted theteon Second conductor 180<br>
includes a third contact 186 and a fourth contact 188 mourned thereon Housing 166<br>
includes a first slot 190 substantially adjacent firs! source lug 160, a second slot !92<br>
substantially adjacent second source lug 162 and a thud slot 194 substantially<br>
adjacent load lug 164. Contact assembly 176 further includes an inner surface 200<br>
including two parallel sections 202 joined by two arcuate sections 204<br>
A plurality of pole units 150 are assembled to fabricate an automatic transfer switch<br>
(not shown) substantially similar to switch 124 (shown in Figure 3) except pole units<br>
80 are replaced with pole units 50. In operation, rhe transfer switch receives<br>
electrical power from first source lugs 160 and delivers that power to load lugs 164<br>
Under normal operating conditions, first source contact 168 contacts first contact 182<br>
forming a first contact pair and first load contact 170 contacts third contact 186<br>
forming a second contact pair.<br><br>
The contact pairs are locked together by a locking engagement between inner surface<br>
200 of contact assembly 176 and apexes 154 and arcuate sections 156 ot conjugate<br>
cam 152. Accordingly, during a short or overload condition the pairs do not separate<br>
and no arcing occurs which can damage the contacts When a controller senses thar<br>
the available power from first source lugs 160 is below a pre-set amount, the<br>
controller causes a solenoid to actuate causing a plunge! to move linearly which<br>
causes a flywheel to rotate against a switch resilient member When the flywheel<br>
rotates, conjugate cam 152 rotates counter-clockwise and after a sufficient rotation.,<br>
conjugate cam 152 rotates against parallel portion 202 distal from load lug 164<br>
causing assembly 176 to move away from first source lug 160 breaking the contact<br>
pair of first source contact 168 with first contact 182 and, nearly simultaneously,<br>
breaking the contact pair of first load contact 170 with third contact 186<br>
As the flywheel continues to rotate, conjugate cam 176 continues to rotate thus<br>
moving assembly 176 closer to second source lug 162 until second contact 184<br>
contacts second source contact 172 forming a third contact pair and. nearly<br>
simultaneously, fourth contact 188 contacts second load contact 174 forming a fourth<br>
contact pair and restonng electrical power to load lug 164. After, the third and fourth<br>
contact pairs are formed, assembly 176 is stationary, but conjugate cam 176 continues<br>
to rotate further providing a positive lock for the third and fourth pairs During a<br>
short or overcurrent condition when load lug 164 is electrically connected to second<br>
source lug !62, the contacts are protected from damaging electrical arcs by conjugate<br>
cam 152 being an interior locking device.<br>
Accordingly, conjugate cam 152 is a cost-efficient and effective interior locking<br>
device which reduces the amount of play in an automatic transfer switch and,<br>
therefore, reduces damaging arcs providing for a Song lasting and reliable automatic<br>
transfer switch.<br>
