PIVOTING SLIDING DOOR FOR VEHICLES<br>
The invention relates to a pivoting sliding door for<br>
vehicles, particularly rail vehicles or lift cabins, having at<br>
least one door wing which, in the closed position, is arranged<br>
in the vehicle wall and which, in the open position, is<br>
arranged on the exterior side in front of the vehicle wall and.<br>
in the process leaves a door opening free, driving devices as<br>
well as transversal guiding devices and longitudinal guiding<br>
devices being provided which permit a movement	of the at least<br>
one door wing transversely to the vehicle wall	and along the<br>
vehicle wall, the longitudinal guiding devices	being moved by<br>
means of the transversal guiding devices.<br>
A door drive of this type is known, for example, from<br>
European Patent Document EP 0 820 889 A. In the case of this<br>
door drive as well as in the case of many other door drives,<br>
almost the entire driving device, which is mounted on a<br>
carriage, moves along the transversal guiding devices, and it<br>
is therefore necessary to fix at least the longitudinal<br>
guiding devices but in most cases also all other driving<br>
components in the moved-out end position in order to ensure<br>
that the door wings do not strike by means of their interior<br>
side against the exterior side of the vehicle wall. Likewise,<br>
it has to be ensured that toward the end of the closing<br>
1<br><br>
movement of the door wings along the longitudinal guiding<br>
devices the fixing is eliminated and the transversal guiding<br>
devices cause the pull-in movement of the longitudinal guiding<br>
devices and therefore also of the door wings and, in most<br>
embodiments, of the entire carriage.<br>
In the state of the art, this sequence of movements is<br>
achieved by mean of a separate guide rail which is<br>
stationarily arranged with respect to the door portal and thus.<br>
the car body and satisfactorily solves this problem.<br>
Another problem is a result of the prerequisite that, in<br>
event of a power failure of the door drive, it is nevertheless<br>
ensured that the door is not opened by persons or objects<br>
striking against the door wing. Usually, in the normal closed<br>
condition of the door, the door drive is also switched to a<br>
powerless, in the case of an electric drive, to a currentless<br>
state. In this condition, even if mechanical locks are still<br>
present, it must not be possible to open the door by<br>
exercising force upon the door wing or by operating the door<br>
handle, but the door has to remain firmly and reliably closed.<br>
When the door drive is without power, it should only be<br>
possible to open the door by operating a door emergency<br>
operating device.<br>
In the state of the art, this requirement is met by a so-<br>
called over-dead-center mechanism, in which case a rotating or<br>
2<br><br>
pivoting part of the door drive, which is rotatably connected<br>
with a second pivoting component, in the course of the closing<br>
movement, moves along the connection line of the axes of<br>
rotation of the two components and then takes up its end<br>
position close to this so-called dead center. When force is<br>
exercised on the door wing and thus on this pivoting part,<br>
because of the rest position of the pivoting part, this force<br>
can result only in a moment which acts upon the pivoting part<br>
in the closing direction.<br>
As reliably as such devices prevent the unintentional or<br>
unauthorized opening of the doors, this mechanism is<br>
disadvantageous when the door is, in fact, to be opened by the<br>
door emergency operating device, particularly if this should<br>
take place by untrained persons and/or in the event of panic.<br>
Specifically, it is very probable in these situations that<br>
pressure is already exercised on the door wings in the opening<br>
direction while it is attempted to bring the driving mechanism<br>
over the dead center by means of the door emergency operating<br>
device. What is a safety feature in the normal operation now<br>
counteracts the desired opening operation and extraordinary<br>
forces are required for moving the door drive over the dead<br>
center in this case. After the dead center has been overcome,<br>
the pressing persons or objects naturally initiate and aid the<br>
opening movement.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a door drive<br>
3<br><br>
of the initially mentioned type Which does not have these<br>
disadvantages but, independently of the momentary loading of<br>
the door wing, ensures an opening of the door in the, event of<br>
an emergency by means of the door emergency operating device<br>
always under the same kinematic and mainly dynamic conditions<br>
and, in the process, requires neither more space, than the<br>
currently used over-dead-center mechanism, nor results in<br>
higher investment costs.<br>
According to the invention, these objects are achieved in<br>
that the pivoting part has a guiding part interacting with a<br>
guide, and in that, in the area in which the pivoting part in<br>
the closed position of the door interacts with the door, the<br>
guide has a circular-arc section about the axis of rotation of<br>
the pivoting part.<br>
As a result of this measure, the forces acting upon the<br>
door wing generate no moment on the pivoting part and.the<br>
locking takes place in an arc section which, with respect to<br>
its size, corresponds to the arc section of conventional over-<br>
dead-center mechanisms but in a neutral manner. In order to<br>
prevent that, in the course of. shocks, vibrations,<br>
inclinations of the vehicle, etc., the pivoting part reaches a<br>
position in which this neutral range is left, the pivoting<br>
part is either form-lockingly or force-lockingly held in this<br>
position, for example, by means of a spring. For the opening,<br>
only the form-locking securing has to be eliminated or the<br>
4<br><br>
force-locking securing which always acts with a constant and<br>
low force, has to be overcome by the door emergency operation,<br>
so that the portion of the pivoting part which interacts with<br>
the guide, leaves the neutral range, whereby the opening of<br>
the door in the event of an emergency can be opened (can take<br>
place? translator) independently of the amount of the forces<br>
acting upon the door wing in the opening direction.<br>
In the following, the invention will be explained in<br>
detail by means of the drawing.<br>
Figure 1 is a vertical sectional view normal with respect<br>
to the exterior wall of the vehicle (?) the upper door area in<br>
the closed position of the door;<br>
Figure 2 is a sectional view according to Figure 1 with a<br>
moved-out door wing;<br>
Figure 3 is a view of the representation according to<br>
Figure 1 with a slightly displaced sectional plane, so that<br>
the move-out mechanism is visible; and<br>
Figure 4 in an enlarged view of the new...(something<br>
seems to be missing in the German - translator) the area of<br>
the dead-center mechanism in different positions during the<br>
opening movement.<br>
5<br><br>
Figure 1 is a vertical sectional view in the edge area of<br>
a door having the reference number 1 as a whole. In the case<br>
of conventional doors of vehicles, for example, rail- vehicles,<br>
in which the doors are arranged in the side walls of the<br>
vehicle body 6, this section therefore extends at least<br>
essentially normal with respect to the longitudinal vehicle<br>
axis. Figure 1 shows the area of the door mechanism 2 which<br>
essentially in its entirety, together with the at least one<br>
door wing 3, is arranged on a carriage 4 which is displaceable.<br>
by means of rollers in guides 5 which are fixedly fastened on<br>
the vehicle body 6, as required, on a portal or frame fixedly<br>
connected with the vehicle body 6.<br>
In the closed position illustrated in Figure 1, the<br>
exterior surface F of the door wing 3 corresponds essentially<br>
to the exterior surface A of the vehicle body 6, as customary<br>
in the case of pivoting sliding doors. The illustrated<br>
embodiment shows a telescopable door. Here, a telescope 7<br>
consisting of at least three parts is, on the one side,<br>
connected with the carriage 4, on the other side, with the<br>
door wing 3 and therefore permits the displacement of the door<br>
wing 3 along the exterior side of the vehicle body 6. In the<br>
case of conventional doors arranged on the side of the vehicle<br>
body, the displacement direction therefore extends parallel to<br>
the longitudinal axis of the vehicle (in the case of lift<br>
doors, these relationships have a correspondingly different<br>
orientation).<br>
6<br><br>
This part of the door mechanism 2 is not directly related<br>
to the invention and will therefore not be discussed, in<br>
detail. Thus, instead of a telescope, a different sliding<br>
system can be provided, and the like. It is only important<br>
that the door wing 3 or wings are finally mounted on the<br>
carriage 4, in which case it should not be overlooked that<br>
guides, locks, sensors, etc. are also additions to the<br>
illustrated telescope which, however, are only marginally<br>
related to the invention and will be described here only as<br>
far as required by the essence of the invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows the door of Figure 1 in the same sectional<br>
view in the moved-out position. In this case, the carriage 4<br>
is displaced in or along the guide 5 toward the exterior<br>
vehicle side, so that the door wing 3 also comes to be<br>
situated with its interior surface I outside the exterior<br>
vehicle side A an can be moved along the telescope 7 (normal<br>
with respect to the plane of the representation), without<br>
ramming the vehicle body 6.<br>
Returning to Figure 1, it should be noted that, also in<br>
the case of a powerless door drive, it has to be ensured that<br>
the door wing 3 is not opened by forces acting upon it but<br>
that a locking has to exist here which can be eliminated only<br>
by the proper activating of the door drive or by operating a<br>
door emergency operating device. The locking device according<br>
7<br><br>
to the invention which, as a whole, has the reference number<br>
8, consists essentially of a locking lever 10 swivellably<br>
about an axis of rotation 9 disposed on the carriage 4 This<br>
locking lever 10 carries a roller 11 on one end which is<br>
displaceably or rollably disposed in a groove 12 stationary<br>
with respect to the vehicle body 6. The operatiqn of this<br>
locking mechanism will be explained in detail below.<br>
Figure 3 is a sectional view parallel to the sectional<br>
view of Figure 1 in the same position of the door and<br>
illustrates the actual door drive 13. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, a gear 14 is non-rotatably connected with the<br>
output shaft of an electric motor. Another gear 14 is non-<br>
rotatably connected with the housing of the electric motor<br>
rotatably suspended about its output shaft. The gear 14<br>
meshes with a gear 15 rotating in a non-rotatable manner with<br>
the locking lever 10 and thereby together with it about its<br>
axis of rotation 9 The gear 14 meshes with a gear 16 non-<br>
rotatably connected with a spindle 17 (Figure 2), the spindle<br>
17, in turn, together with a nut fittingly connected with the<br>
door wing 3 being responsible for the longitudinal movement of<br>
the door wing.<br>
The method of operation of the device is as follows:<br>
When, starting from the position illustrated in Figure 3, the<br>
motor starts to rotate in the opening direction, a guide (not<br>
shown) prevents the movement of the door wing 3 along the<br>
8<br><br>
telescope 7 and thus any rotation of the spindle 17 and<br>
therefore also of the gears 16 and 14 so that, as a result of<br>
the moment of reaction of the motor, the latter, together with<br>
the gear 14, rotates in the opposite direction and thus<br>
rotates the gear 15 about the axis of rotation 9. Since the<br>
gear 15 is fixedly connected with the locking lever 10, the<br>
latter swivels (clockwise in Figure 3) and thereby displaces<br>
the roller.11 in the groove 12.<br>
The groove 12 has an at least essentially linear section<br>
12a and, starting at a transition point 18 (Figure 4), an<br>
adjoining curved section 12b. When the door is closed (in the<br>
locfked position) , the roller 11 is situated in the curved<br>
section 12b. The curvature of the section 12b corresponds at<br>
least essentially to the curvature which a circle has in the<br>
center at the point at which the axis of rotation 9 is<br>
situated when the door is closed. Thus, at the start of the<br>
rotating movement of the locking lever 10 about its axis of<br>
rotation 9, a movement of the roller 11 occurs in the groove<br>
which is adapted to the shape of the groove 12b, this movement<br>
not causing any noticeable reaction forces between the roller<br>
and the wall of the groove. Since there are no such forces,<br>
no displacement of the carriage 4 occurs in the guides 5.<br>
When, as a result of the progressing rotation of the<br>
locking lever 10, the roller 11 arrives in the linear section<br>
12a of the groove 12, it attempts to continue the rotating<br>
9<br><br>
movement and in the process presses against the ("lower" or<br>
"right") groove wall, which leads to a reaction force upon the<br>
roller and thus upon the locking lever.As a result. the axis<br>
of rotation 9 and with it the entire carriage 4 together with<br>
the door drive 13 and the door mechanism 2 and the door wing 3<br>
is displaced (move-out movement) until finally the situation<br>
of Figure 2 has been reached.<br>
This move-out movement is shown in greater detail in<br>
Figures 4 to 9, where, on the one hand, the scale of the<br>
representation is enlarged and, on the other hand, all<br>
components situated on the door side of the carriage were<br>
omitted for reasons of clarity. The locking lever 10 has a<br>
different shape than in Figures 1 to 3, which is not<br>
important, however. The position of the individual parts in<br>
Figure 4 now corresponds to that in Figure 1: The carriage 4<br>
is in the position in which it is pushed the farthest into the<br>
interior of the vehicle body; the locking lever 10 takes up a<br>
position which cannot be rotated counterclockwise or can<br>
hardly be rotated farther; and the roller 11 is situated in<br>
the curved part 12b of the connecting link or of the groove 12<br>
at some, although narrow distance from the transition point<br>
18.<br>
In Figure 4 and in the figures which follow, the shape of<br>
the groove 12 is indicated by the center line 12'; the<br>
transition between the linear section 12a and the curved<br>
10<br><br>
section 12b is marked by a small circle around the transition<br>
point 18. It is also clearly illustrated that the center line<br>
12 of the groove 12 in the curved section has the shape of a<br>
circular arc around the axis of rotation 9 in this position of<br>
the carriage 4. Furthermore, it is shown that the center 11<br>
of the roller 11 is situated already in the curved section 12b<br>
and therefore has a distance from the transition point 18; in<br>
the illustrated example, the indicated 5°.<br>
The special significance of this shaping and this<br>
position is now that forces acting upon the door wing - this<br>
does not apply to driving and guiding forces during the<br>
operation but to forces which are exercised intentionally or<br>
unintentionally upon the door wing by passengers (impacting<br>
during cornering, leaning by persons, use of standing room,<br>
acts by vandals, pressure differences when traveling through<br>
tunnels or during passing of trains, etc.) if the resultant<br>
force is aimed at least approximately horizontally upon the<br>
door wing toward the outside - exercise a force upon the<br>
carriage 4 in the direction of the arrow H. Vertical<br>
components, which are transmitted to the carriage 4, are taken<br>
over by the guide 5 in which the carriage is disposed by means<br>
of rollers in the illustrated embodiment.<br>
The only reaction forces which can act against the<br>
horizontal force H are the forces occurring between the roller<br>
11 and the wall groove 12. These may occur (friction<br>
11<br><br>
neglected) only normally on the joint tangential plane in the<br>
contact area between the surface of the roller 11 and the<br>
surface of the groove wall (direction N) Which, howeyer,<br>
because of the described geometrical conditions, coincides<br>
with the straight connection line in the direction R between<br>
the axis of rotation 9 and the axis 11 of rotation of the<br>
roller: R=N. This means that, also when large forces H occur,<br>
no moment is created at the locking lever 10, so that the<br>
carriage cannot start moving and therefore the door wing 3<br>
can also not move in the opening direction. The horizontal<br>
component of the normal force N balances the applied<br>
horizontal force H: The door is locked.<br>
When the normal opening movement is now initiated, as<br>
illustrated in Figure 5, by means of the torque exercised on<br>
the locking lever 10, the axis 11 of rotation of the roller<br>
11 arrives at the transition 18 between the linear section 12a<br>
and the bent section 12b of the groove 12 and thus at the<br>
boundary of the area in which the above-mentioned facts apply.<br>
During the rotation about the, in the illustrated embodiment,<br>
5° between the end position according to Figure 4 and the<br>
neutral limit position according to Figure 5, the carriage,<br>
indicated at the axis of rotation of the motor (Figure 3),<br>
carries out no lift; that is, that this movement is not made<br>
more difficult by any large forces H in the horizontal<br>
direction.<br>
12<br><br>
This is an important contrast to the previously known<br>
over-dead-center mechanisms, in the case of Which, in the<br>
course of the movement from the locked end position to the<br>
boundary position, it had always been necessary to "overcome<br>
the dead center", which, applied to the illustrated<br>
embodiment, corresponds to a low but still noticeable movement<br>
of the carriage 4 against the force N so that, in the event<br>
of panic or simply high forces, this overcoming of the dead<br>
center is made difficult and in the case of a manual opening,<br>
specifically when panic occurs, is made almost impossible.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates how, during the entry into the<br>
linear section 12a of the groove, the lift movement starts, on<br>
the one hand, and, on the other hand, as a result of the<br>
gapping of the normal force N between the roller 11 and the<br>
groove wall, on the one hand, and of the radial direction R as<br>
the connection line between the axis of rotation 9 and the<br>
roller axis 11 by the horizontal force H, a torque, caused by<br>
the tangential force T upon the locking lever 10, acts in the<br>
opening direction.<br>
In the case of a further progressing lift, Figure 7 shows<br>
the locking lever in an almost normal direction to the guide<br>
5; Figure 8 shows the situation in the case of a more rotated<br>
locking lever 10 which has started to move out of the groove<br>
12 again.<br>
13<br><br>
Figure 9 finally shows the fully moved-out end position.<br>
The roller 11 again arrives at the or in the curved area 12b,<br>
but this is not important with respect to the locking because<br>
of the completely displaced position of the axis of rotation 9<br>
which moves along with the carriage 4.<br>
In the course of the move-out movement illustrated in<br>
Figures 4 to 9, the displacement of the door wing. 3 also<br>
starts with the telescope 7 (Figure 1) . The sequence of<br>
these two movements is caused in a known manner by a guide<br>
which is fixedly arranged with respect to the vehicle body 6<br>
and which also (unless other stop mechanisms, for example, in<br>
the guide 5 are provided) causes the end of the move-out<br>
movement of the carriage 4. As a result of this fixing of the<br>
carriage 4, the moment, which is required for rotating the<br>
spindle 17 (Figure 2), becomes smaller than the holding moment<br>
by the fixed carriage acting upon the motor housing (gear<br>
14), so that the rotating movement of the spindle starts.<br>
Naturally, it is also conceivable to implement the displacing<br>
movement of the door in a different manner. The plurality of<br>
the known drives can be combined together with the locking<br>
device according to the invention for the door in the closed<br>
position.<br>
The closing movement of the door takes place in precisely<br>
the reverse sequence as previously the opening movement:<br>
First, by means of the motor, whose housing and the gear 14'<br>
14<br><br>
connected therewith is fixed, a rotation of the spindle is<br>
caused in the closing direction; when the door wing<br>
approaches its closed position, the guide (not shown), which<br>
is fixedly connected with the vehicle body 6, has the result<br>
that the carriage 4 can be moved in the direction away from<br>
the exterior vehicle side A, whereupon the moment of reaction<br>
at the gear 14' initiates this movement which now, in the<br>
sequence of Figures 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 and finally 4, reestablishes<br>
the closed position in the locked position.<br>
As illustrated here by a comparison Between Figures 5 and<br>
4, during the movement of the connection line between the axis<br>
of rotation 9 and the roller axis 11' by way of the transition<br>
point 18 of the guide 12, the coinciding of reaction forces<br>
originating from the horizontal force H and the radial force R<br>
with the resulting normal force N is ensured so that a locking<br>
takes place without the exceeding of a dead center.<br>
As initially mentioned, the position of the locking lever<br>
10 is secured in the position illustrated in Figure 4, for<br>
example, by a weak torsion spring in the bearing of the<br>
locking lever 10 about the axis 9 or by a form-locking locking<br>
by a pin or the like, which projects into the groove at the<br>
fitting point. Such securing devices are also necessary in<br>
the case of the known excess pressure mechanisms, because the<br>
latter reliably remain in the locked position only in the case<br>
of a continuously applied force in the opening direction,<br>
15<br><br>
while, in the completely unloaded condition, they may unlock<br>
in an undesirable manner as a result of vibrations or the<br>
like.<br>
Concerning the different shape of the locking lever in<br>
Figures 1 to 3 and Figures 4 to 9, it should also be noted<br>
that, in Figures 1 to 3, this lever is also used for operating<br>
a holding device for the door wing 3 arranged at the lower<br>
door end. As illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, in the course of<br>
the opening of the door, the upper linkage point of the<br>
operating rod 19 moves upward, so that a holding or release<br>
movement can be derived therefrom. It is also conceivable to<br>
construct this operating lever 19 as part of an emergency<br>
operating device. As a result of such an emergency operating<br>
device, the moment required for the opening can be applied<br>
directly to the locking lever 10, independently of the actual<br>
motor.<br>

WO 2004/065154			PCT/EP2003/014724<br>
CLAIMS:<br>
1. Pivoting sliding door for vehicles, particularly rail<br>
vehicles or lift cabins, having at least one door, wing (3)<br>
which, in the closed position, is arranged in the vehicle wall<br>
and which, in the open position, is arranged on the exterior<br>
side (A) in front of the vehicle wall and in the process<br>
leaves a door opening free, driving devices (2) as well as<br>
transversal guiding devices (4, 5) and longitudinal guiding<br>
devices (7) being provided which permit a movement of the at<br>
least one door wing (3) transversely to the vehicle wall and<br>
along the vehicle wall, the longitudinal guiding devices<br>
moving by means of the transversal guiding devices in the<br>
transverse direction, the door, in the closed position, being<br>
locked by a pivoting part which engages in a guide,<br>
characterized in that the pivoting part (10) has a guiding<br>
part (11) which interacts with a guide (12), and in that the<br>
guide (12), in the area in which the pivoting part (10) in the<br>
closed position of the door interacts with it, has a circular<br>
arc section 12b around the momentary position of the. axis of<br>
rotation (9) of the pivoting part (10).<br>
2. Pivoting sliding door according to Claim 1,<br>
characterized in that the guide, in the section (12a) in which<br>
the pivoting part (10) interacts with it when the pivoting<br>
17<br><br>
part is outside the closed position of the door, extends in a<br>
straight line.<br>
3.	Pivoting sliding door according to Claim 1 or 2,<br>
characterized in that, in the closed position of the door, the<br>
guiding part (11) of the pivoting part (10) is positioned at a<br>
distance from the transition point (18) connecting the two<br>
guiding sections (12a, 12b).<br>
4.	Pivoting sliding part according to one of the<br>
preceding claims,<br>
characterized in that the pivoting part (10) is rotatably<br>
about the axis of rotation (9) arranged on a carriage (4)<br>
carrying out the transversal movement.<br>
5.	Pivoting sliding part according to Claim 4,<br>
characterized in that the pivoting part (10) is pivoted about<br>
its axis of rotation (9) by the moment of reaction of the .<br>
driving motor acting upon the longitudinal guiding device and<br>
arranged on the carriage.<br><br>
18<br><br><br>
The invention relates to a pivoting sliding door for vehicles, comprising a door wing (3), drive devices (2), transversal<br>
guiding devices (4, 5), and longitudinal guiding devices (7), which enable the at least one door wing (3) to move transversal to the<br>
vehicle wall and along the vehicle wall. The longitudinal guiding devices move in a transverse direction by means of the transversal<br>
guiding devices. When closed, the door is locked by a pivot part (10), which engages inside a guide (12) whereby preventing the<br>
door from being unintentionally opened. The invention is characterized in that the pivot pan (10) has a guide part (11) that interacts<br>
with a guide (12) and that the guide, in the area in which the pivot part (10) interacts with the guide when the door is closed, has a<br>
circular arc section (12b) around the actual position of the rotation axis (9) of the pivot part (10).<br></td>
