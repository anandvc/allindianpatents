"A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION COMPRISING GABAPENTIN"<br>
TEVA PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES, LTD., of 5 Basel Street, P.O. Box 3190, Petah Tiqva 49131, Israel<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
Cross-reference to Related Applications<br>
This  invention relates  to  PCT Application No.   WO 98/28255,   filed July 2,   1998,   also assigned to the  assignee of the present  invention and incorporated herein by reference;   the present  invention also  claims  priority to U.S.   Provisional Application No.   60/211,966,   filed  June  16, 2000.<br>
Field of the  Invention<br>
The present invention relates to  a pharmaceutical composition  containing therapeutically effective  amount  of gabapentin and its  derivatives in combination with effective carriers.     More particularly,   the present  invention relates to  a  stable  composition and a process   for manufacturing pure and stable gabapentin having a pH in the range  of  6.8  to 7.3.<br>
Background of  the Invention<br>
Gabapentin is  1-(aminomethyl)-1-cyclohexaneacetic  acid, having the chemical structure of formula I:<br><br>
Gabapentin is used for treating cerebral diseases  such as  epilepsy,   faintness attacks,   hypokinesis  and  cranial traumas.     United States Patent No.   4,024,175  to  Satzinger et al.,   incorporated herein by reference,   discloses  that<br><br>
gabapentin of formula (I) shows hypothermal and, in some cases, narcosis-potentiating or sedating properties as well as protective effect against cardiozole cramp in animals. Finally, gabapentin has been found especially useful in treating geriatric _patients.  As such, there has been a need for producing pure and stable gabapentin.<br>
United States Patent No. 6,054,482 to Augart et al. discloses that preparation and long-term storage of gabapentin presents several problems since (i) during the preparation the compounds shows considerable variations without apparent reason, and (ii) the long-term storage of even very pure gabapentin showed differing stabilities with progressively long storage times.  Augart further discloses that the toxic lactam compound of formula (II)<br><br>
forms during the preparation and storage of gabapentin. According to Augart, because the lactam has higher toxicity than gabapentin, its presence in gabapentin should be limited if not eliminated.  To combat the lactam formation and provide product stability, Augart stresses the importance of (i) starting with gabapentin raw material that contains 0.5% or less of corresponding lactam, (ii) not allowing the anion of a mineral acid in the composition to exceed 20 ppm, and (iii) using a specifically selected adjuvant that is not adverse to gabapentin stability.<br>
According to Augart, the following adjuvants (or excipients) had. no noticeable influence on the stability of<br><br>
gabapentin,   and as  such,   they were  taught  to be acceptable adjuvants  for use with  gabapentin:<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,   polyvinylpyrrolidone, crospovidon,   poloxamer  407,   poloxamer  188,   sodium starch glycolate,   copolyvidone,   maize  starch,   cyclodextrin, lactose,   talc,   as well  as  co-polymers  of dimethylamino-methacrylic  acid and neutral methacrylic acid ester.<br>
Conversely,   Augart  discloses  that the  following adjuvants reduce the  stability of  gabapentin  and should be<br>
i<br>
avoided: modified maize starch, sodium croscarmelose, glycerol behenic acid ester, methacrylic acid co-polymers (types A and C) , anion exchangers titanium dioxide and silica gels such as Aerosil 200.<br>
The composition and method disclosed in Augart are industrially impractical and technically unnecessary.  It has now been found that Augart's reliance on maintaining the anion of a mineral acid as not exceeding 20 ppm is misplaced.  Thus, gabapentin and pharmaceutical formulations of gabapentin can be prepared and stored such that initially they do not contain more than 0.5% of the lactam and even after one year of storage at 25 °C and 60% atmospheric humidity, the conversion of gabapentin to its corresponding lactam does not exceed 0.2% by weight of gabapentin.  That is, gabapentin and pharmaceutical formulations of gabapentin have been found to be stable even though such formulations do not meet Augart's requirements (ii) and (iii).<br>
The specific mineral acid disclosed by Augert is hydrochloric acid (column 3, lines 61-63; column 5, lines 24-29; exampes 1 and 2). The specification states, in particular<br>
The active materials of formula (I) [including gabapentin] must be prepared as highly purified, nonderivatized free amino acids, for example, from the<br><br>
corresponding hydrochloride by ion exchange.     The proportion of  remaining hydrochloride admixtures  should thereby not  exceed 20  ppm.<br>
(Column  5,   lines  24-29).<br>
20 ppm of gabapentin hydrochloride corresponds to roughly 3  ppm of chloride ion,   due to the higher molecular weight of  gabapentin.<br>
Augert's  claims  require gabapentin with "less than 20 ppm of the  anion of a mineral acid",   e.g.   chloride.<br>
Summary of the  Invention<br>
Accordingly,   the present invention relates  to a pharmaceutical  composition containing a pharmaceutically effective  amount of gabapentin having a pH in the range of 6.8 to  7.3  and which initially contains  less than 0.5%  of a corresponding  lactam and after one year of  storage at  25   °C and  60%  atmospheric  humidity the conversion of  gabapentin  to its corresponding  lactam does not exceed 0.2%  by weight  of gabapentin.<br>
The present  invention also relates  to  a process  for preparing  a  stable pharmaceutical formulation  containing gabapentin  having pH in the range of 6.8-7.3,   more preferably  in the range of 7.0-7.2,   initially containing less than  0.5%  of a  corresponding lactam and after storage for one year at  25   °C and 60%  atmospheric humidity the conversion  of gabapentin to  its corresponding lactam does not exceed  0.2% by weight of gabapentin.<br>
Detailed Description of  the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The  subject  invention will now be described in greater detail  for preferred embodiments of the invention,   it being understood that these  embodiments are intended only as illustrative examples  and the invention is not  to be limited<br><br>
thereto.<br>
As will be illustrated through exemplary embodiments 1-16, gabapentin may be prepared from the hydrochloride salt of gabapentin (gabapentin hydrochloride) and that in purified form gabapentin may have a pH in the range of 6.8-7.3, and preferably in the range of 7.0-7.2.  The gabapentin formulation may also contain more than 20 ppm of chloride ion in the composition as measured by the amount of chloride ion in the composition.<br>
Exemplary embodiments 17-19 illustrate formulations of gabapentin containing varying amounts of chloride ion, some of which are greater than 20 ppm and some less, and all of which initially contain less than 0.5% of lactam and after one year of storage at 25 °C and 60% humidity, the conversion of gabapentin to its corresponding lactam is measured not to exceed 0.2% by weight of gabapentin.<br>
Commonly known adjuvants (also referred to as excipients) which can be utilized in a gabapentin formulation of the present invention may include for example, modified maize starch, sodium croscarmelose, titanium dioxide, and silica gels such as Aerosil 200. Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, crospovidon, poloxamer 407, poloxamer 188, sodium starch glycolate, copolyvidone, maize starch, cyclodexterin, lactose, talc, co-polymers of dimethylamino-methacrylic acid and neutral methacrylic acid ester may also be used.  The list of adjuvants is not an exhaustive list and it would be within the scope of the claimed invention to use any known adjuvant that would behave similar to those enumerated herein.<br>
Certain specific representative embodiments of the invention are described in detail below, the materials,<br><br>
apparatus and process  steps being understood as  examples that are intended for illustrative purposes   only. Consequently,   it will be noted that the  invention  is not intended to be limited to  the methods,   materials, conditions,   precess parameters,   apparatus  and the  like specifically recited herein.<br>
In the eKamples below chloride ion concentration is measured by any commonly  known method,   such  as   for example, by titration with AgNO3 pH electrode or chromatography.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The following raw material were used:<br><br>
Gabapentin hydrochloride	18.2   g<br>
Isopropanol for dissolution	160 ml<br>
Active carbon SX1		1.1   g<br>
Ethylacetate		268  ml<br>
Tributylamine		19.5  g<br>
Methanol  for washing		23  ml<br>
A) Preparation of Crude gabapentin<br>
Gabapentin hydrochloride was dissolved in 130 ml of dry isopropanol at 25°C by mixing.  Next, 1.1 grams of active carbon was added and the suspension was heated to 40°C and maintained at this temperature for 2 hours.  The suspension was then filtered at 40°C and the filter cake was washed twice with additional 15 ml of isopropanol each time.  The washings were added to the already separated solution of gabapentin hydrochloride in isopropanol.  The solution was concentrated to dryness in vacuum (Approximately 10 mm Hg) to a constant weight.     The temperature of the heating bath was maintained (maximally) at 35°C during this operation. Thereafter, 245 ml of ethylacetate was added to the dry residue of gabapentin hydrochloride and the solution was<br><br>
mixed.  After half an hour of mixing at 25°C, an amount of 19.5 grams of tributylamine was added during the subsequent 30 minutes.  The mixing continued for an additional two hours at the same temperature.<br>
The gabapentin base which was formed during this operation was separated from the suspension through filtration.  The filter cake was washed with 23 ml of ethylacetate and 23 ml of methanol to give crude gabapentin.<br>
B) Gabapentin Purification<br>
The following raw material were used:<br>
Methanol for suspending      52.5 ml<br>
Methanol for washing	2x15 ml<br>
Wet crude gabapentin prepared according to Step A    was suspended in 52.5 ml of methanol for 14 hours at approximately 25°C and stirred.  Thereafter, the solid gabapentin was separated from the suspension by filtration. The filter cake was washed twice with 15 ml of methanol and than dried under vacuum giving pure gabapentin.  The yield was 72%.<br>
The following data regarding the chlorine anion content of the above-prepared gabapentin were obtained:<br>

D	40	6.97<br>
E	35	6.92<br>
F	15	6.84<br>
Gabapentin purified according to these procedures contains less than 0.5% lactam as measured by HPLC vs.<br><br>
standard.     After  a  year of storage  at 25°C and 60%  relative humidity,   the  conversion of gabapentin to its. corresponding lactam is measured not to exceed 0.2% by weight of gabapentin.<br>
For a better  control  of the pH of pure gabapentin several basic agents were added.     Some examples  of added basic agents are  given in  the  following Examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The following raw material were used:<br>
Methanol for suspending     52.5 ml<br>
Methanol for washings      2x15 ml<br>
Tributylamine	-0.3 equivalents<br>
The wet crude gabapentin (as in Step 1A) was suspended in 52.5 ml of methanol for 14 hours and at 25°C and stirred. Tributylamine was added to the suspension.  After 14 hours of stirring the solid gabapentin was separated from the suspension by filtration.  The filter cake was then washed twice, each time with 15 ml of methanol and than dried under vacuum resulting in pure gabapentin with a yield of 87%, pH of 7.15 and chlorine anion content of 50 ppm.  Gabapentin so prepared initially contained less than 0.5% by weight of lactam, and, after a year of storage at 25°C and 60% relative humidity, the conversion of gabapentin to its corresponding lactam is measured not to exceed 0.2% by weight of gabapentin.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
The following raw material were used:<br>
Methanol for suspending      52.5 ml<br><br>
Methanol for washing	2x15 ml<br>
Sodium methoxide	-0.001 equivalents<br>
The wet crude gabapentin (as in Example 1, step A) was suspended in 52.5 ml of methanol for 14 hours and kept at 25°C.  Sodium methoxide was added to the suspension.  After 14 hours of stirring, the solid gabapentin was separated from the suspension by filtration.  The filter cake was then washed twice with 15 ml of methanol, then dried under vacuum, resulting in pure gabapentin having a yield of 85%, pH of 6.8, and chlorine anion content of 50 ppm. Gabapentin so prepared contained less than 0.5% by weight of lactam, and, after a year of storage at 25°C and 60% relative humidity, the conversion of gabapentin to its corresponding lactam is measured not to exceed 0.2% by weight of gabapentin.<br>
It should be noted that the solvents and the base used in Example 1A were not unique.  In addition, it should be noted that in Examples 4-9 gabapentin pure was always prepared as in Example IB and the results (CI" content and yield) refer to gabapentin pure.<br>

active  carbon was  added and the suspension was heated  to   40° C  and maintained at  this temperature for 2 hours.     The suspension was   filtered at  40°  C and the  filter cake was then washed twice,   each time with an additional  15 ml  of isopropanol.     The washings were added to  the already separated  solution  of gabapentin hydrochloride in isopropanol.     After half an hour of mixing at 25°   C,   19.5 grams  of tributylamine was added during half an hour and the mixing was  continued for two hours at the same temperature. The  formed gabapentin base was  separated from the  suspension by filtration  and washed with 23 ml of methanol to give gabapentin  crude.     After reslurry as in Example  IB gabapentin pure was  obtained at a yield of 58.8%  and chloride  anion  content  of 7  ppm C1-.<br>
Gabapentin so prepared contained less than 0.5%  by weight  of  lactam,   and,   after a year of storage at  25°C and 60% relative humidity,   the conversion of gabapentin to its corresponding  lactam is  found not to exceed 0.2% by weight of  gabapentin.<br>

additional 15 ml of isopropanol each time.  The washings were added to the already separated solution of gabapentin hydrochloride in isopropanol. The solution was concentrated to dryness in vacuum (-10 mm Hg) to constant weight.  The temperature of the heating bath was maintained at maximum 35° C during this operation.  Next, 245 ml of isopropylacetate was added to the dry residue of gabapentin hydrochloride and mixing commenced. After half an hour of mixing at 25°C, an amount of 19.5 g of tributylamine was added during half an hour and the mixing was continued for two hours at the same temperature. The formed gabapentin base was separated from the suspension by filtration.  The filter cake was washed with 23 ml of isopropylacetate and 23 ml of methanol to give gabapentin crude.  After reslufry as in Example IB, gabapentin pure was obtained having a yield of 57.9% and an anion content of 142 ppm.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
(The neutralization reaction as in Example 1, however, the reslurry in methanol is replaced by a crystallization in methanol.)<br>
The following raw material were used:<br>
Methanol for dissolution     180 ml<br>
Methanol for washing    2x12 ml<br>
The gabapentin crude (Step 1A) was suspended in 180 ml of methanol at 25° C.  The suspension was heated while mixing to 55°C when gabapentin was dissolved.  The solution was then cooled slowly for an hour to 25°C. At 25° C the solution was concentrated to a volume of 50 ml. The suspension was stirred for twelve hours at 25°C.  After 12 hours, the solid gabapentin was separated from the suspension by filtration.  The filter cake was washed twice<br><br>
with 12 ml of methanol then dried under vacuum to  give gabapentin pure   (yield:   72%) .     Following Cl- contents  of gabapentin and pH values were obtained and tabulated in TABLE 2 as  follows:<br>

EXAMPLE  17<br>
The following gabapentin tablet formulation is prepared using gabapentin containing chloride ion ranging from 5 to 40 ppm and pH in the range of 6.84 - 7.04 according to Example 1.  The following material is used:<br><br>
 Ingredients 	Amounts   <br>
gabapentin	125 g<br>
Corn Starch NF	200 g<br>
Cellulose, Microcrystalline	46  g<br>
Sterotex Powder HM	4 g <br>
Purified Water	q.s. or 300 ml<br><br><br>
Combine corn starch,   cellulose,   and  gabapentin together in a mixer and mix  for 2-4 minutes.     Add water  to  this combination and mix  for an addition  1-3 minutes.     The resulting mix is  spread on trays  and dried in  convection oven  at  45-55  °C until a moisture  level  of  1  to  2%  is obtained.     The dried mix is then milled and added back to the mill mixture and the total  is  blended  for  additional  4-5 minutes.     Compressed tables  of  150 mg,   375 mg  and  750 mg are formed using appropriate punches  from the  total mix.<br>
The  formulation is measured to  contain  less   than  0.5% lactam and after one year of  storage  at   25   °C  and  60% atmospheric humidity,   the  conversion  of  gabapentin to its corresponding lactam is measured not  to  exceed  0.2% by weight  of gabapentin.<br>
EXAMPLE   18<br>
Gabapentin of Example 2 (having chloride ion content of 50 ppm and pH of 7.15) is used to formulate tablets as in EXAMPLE 17, except that corn starch is replaced in each sample by one of the following adjuvants: pregelatinized starch, croscarmelose sodium, silica gel, titanium dioxide, talc, modified maize starch and maize starch.<br>
The resulting gabapentin tablet of each sample is initially measured to have 0.5 % by weight of a corresponding lactam, more than 50 ppm of chloride anion, and pH exceeding 6.8-  The tablet is stored for one year at 25 °C and 60% atmospheric humidity and the conversion of gabapentin to its corresponding lactam is found not to exceed 0.2% by weight of gabapentin.<br>
EXAMPLE 19<br>
EXAMPLE 18 is repeated except that gabapentin of Example 4, having chloride ion of 7 ppm is used for<br><br><br>
formulating tablets.  The resulting gabapentin tablet of each sample is initially measured to have 0.5 % by weight of lactam and approximately 7 ppm of chloride anion.  The tablet is stored for one year at 25 °C and 60% atmospheric humidity and the increase in the lactam concentration is found not to exceed 0.2% by weight.<br>
Examples 17-19 show that, contrary to Augart's disclosure, the presence of anion of a mineral acid in an amount greater than 20 ppm does not adversely affect the stability of gabapentin when stored for one year at 25 °C and 60% humidity (or higher) .  In addition, the  Examples also show that gabapentin having pH in the range of 6.8 to 7.3, and preferably in the range of 7.0-7.2 is stable when stored for one year at 25 °C and 60% humidity.  Further, the examples show that the gabapentin formulations prepared in accordance with the invention showed equally stable result regardless of the type of adjuvant that were used.<br><br>
