				<td>CONJUGATHS HAVING A DEGKADABLK LINKAGE AND POLYMERIC REAGENTS USEFUL IN PREPARING SUCH CONJUGATES<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates generally to polymeric reagents useful in<br>
providing a conjugate having a degradable linkage between a polymer and another moiety. In addition, the. invention relates to, among other things, conjugates of the polymeric reagents, methods for synthesizing the polymeric reagents and methods for conjugating the polymeric reagents to active agents and other moieties.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Scientists and clinicians lace a number of challenges in their attempts to<br>
develop active agents info forms suited for delivery to a patient. Active agents that are polypeptides, for example, are often delivered via injection rather than orally. In this way, the polypepticlc is introduced into the systemic circulation without exposure to the proteolytic environment of the stomach. Injection of polypeptides, however, has several drawbacks.<br>
[0003]	For example, many polypeptides have a relatively short half-life, thereby<br>
necessitating repealed injections, which are often inconvenient and painful. Moreover, some polypeptides can elicit one or more immune responses with the consequence that the patient's immune system attempts to destroy or otherwise neutralize the immunogenic polypeptide. Of course, once the polypeptide has been destroyed or otherwise neutralized, the polypeptide cannot exert its intended pharmacodynamic activity. Thus, delivery of active agents such as polypeptides is often problematic even when these agents are administered by injection.<br>
[0004J	Some success has been achieved in addressing the problems of<br>
delivering active agents via injection. For example, conjugating the active agent to a water-soluble polymer has resulted in polymer-active agent conjugates having reduced<br>
immunogenicity and antigenicity. In addition, these polymer-active agent conjugates often have greatly increased half-lives compared to their unconjugated counterparts as a result of decreased clearance through the kidney and/or decreased enzymatic degradation in the systemic circulation. As a result of having a greater half-life, the polymer-active agent conjugate requires less frequent dosing, which hi turn reduces the overall number of painful injections and inconvenient visits with a health care professional. Moreover, active agents that were only marginally soluble demonstrate a significant increase in water solubility when conjugated to a water-soluble polymer,<br>
[0005]	Due to its documented safety as well as its approval by the FDA for both<br>
topical and internal use, polyethylene glycol has been conjugated to active agents. When an active agent is conjugated to a polymer of polyethylene glycol or "PEG," the conjugated active agent is conventionally referred to as "PEGylated." The commercial success of PEGylated active agents such as PEGAS'YS® PEGylated interfcron alpha-2a (Hoffmann-La Roche, Nutley, NJ), PEG-INTRON® PEGylated interferon alpha-2b (Schering Corp., Kennilworth, NJ). and NEULASTA™ PEG-filgrastim (Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA) demonstrates that administration of a conjugated form of an active agent can have significant advantages over the unconjugated counterpart. Small molecules such as distearoylphosphatidylethanoliimine (Zalipsky (1993) Bioconjug, Chem. 4(4):296-299) and ffuorouracll (Ouchi el al. (1992) Drug Des. Discov.9(\):93-105) have also been PEGylated. Harris et al. have provided a review of the effects of PEGylution on pharmaceuticals. Harris et al. (2003) Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2(3):214-221,<br>
[0006]	Despite these successes, conjugation of a polymer to an active agent to<br>
result in a commercially relevant drug is often challenging. For example, conjugation can result in the polymer being attached at or near a site on the active agent that is necessary for pharruacologic activity (e.g., at or near a binding site). Such conjugates may therefore have unacceptably low activity due to, for example, the stc-ric effects introduced by the polymer. Attempts to remedy conjugates having unacceplably low activity can be frustrated when the active agent has few or no other sites suited for attachment to a polymer. Thus, additional PEGylation alternatives have been desired.<br>
 [0007]	One suggested approach for solving this and other problems is<br>
"reversible PEGylation" wherein the native active agent (or a moiety having increased activity compared to the PEGylated active agent) is released. For example, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0079155 describes conjugates using reversible linkages, As described in this publication, reversible linkages can be effected through the use of an enzyme substrate moiety. It has been pointed out, however, that approaches relying tin enzymatic activity are dependent on the availability of enzymes. See Pelcg-Schulman (2004) J, Med. Chem. 47:4897-4904. Thus, additional approaches that do not rely on enzymatic processes for degradation have been described as being desirable.<br>
[0008]	One .such approach for reversible PEGylation describes a polymeric<br>
reagent comprising a fluorcne moiety upon which a branched polymer is attached using maleimide chemistry. Id. See Peleg-Schulman (2004) J. Med. Chem. 47:4897-4904 and WO 2004/089280.   The synthetic approach used to form the described polymeric reagent is complex, requiring many steps. Consequently, alternative polymeric reagents that do not require such complex synthetic schemes are needed.<br>
[0009]	Another reversible conjugation approach is described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,5.14,491. The structures described in this patent include those wherein a water soluble, non-pcptidio polymer is attached to an aromatic group via a single attachment point. Although providing degradable linkages within the conjugate, there is a need to provide still further polymeric reagents that can form degradable linkages with a conjugate.<br>
[0010]	Thus, further polymeric reagents useful in providing conjugates having a<br>
degradable linkage between a polymer and another moiety remains needed. In addition, there remains a need to provide a range of polymeric reagents useful in providing ccnjiiji.aU;;; having a range of release rates. Thus, the present invention seeks to solve these and other needs in the art.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0045]	Before describing the present invention in detail, it is to be understood<br>
that this invention is not limited to the particular polymers, synthetic techniques, active agents, and the like, as such may vary.<br>
 [0046]	It must be noted that, as used in this specification and the claims, the<br>
.singular forms "a," ".in," and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to a "polymer" includes a single polymer as well as two or more of the same or different polymers, reference to a "conjugate" refers to a single conjugate as well as two or more of the same or different conjugates, reference to an "excipienl" includes a single excipient as well as two or more of the same or different excipients, and the like.<br>
10047]	In describing and claiming the present invention, the following<br>
terminology will be used in accordance with the definitions described below.<br>
[0048]	"PEG," "polyethylene glycol" and "poly(ethylene gjycol)" as used<br>
herein, are meant to encompass any water-soluble poly(ethylene oxide). Typically, PEGs for use in accordance with the invention comprise the following structure "-O(CH2CH2O)m-" where (m) is 2 to 4000. As used herein, PEG also includes "-CH2CH2-O(CH2CH2O)m- CH2CH2-" and "-(CH2CH2O)m-.." depending upon whether or not the terminal oxygens have been displaced. When the PEG further comprises a spacer moiety (to be described in greater detail below), the atoms comprising the spacer moiety, when covalently attached to a water-soluble polymer segment, do not result in the formation of an oxygen-oxygen bond (i.e., an "-O-O-" or peroxide linkage). Throughout (lie specification and claims, it should be remembered that the term "PEG" includes structures having various terminal or "end capping" groups and so forth. The term "PEG" also means a polymer that contains a majority, that is to say, greater than 50%, of -CH2CH2O- monomeric subunits. With respect to specific forms, the PEG can take any number of a variety of molecular weights, as well as structures or geometries such as "branched," "linear," "forked," "multifunctional," and the like, to be described in greater detail below.<br>
[0049]	The terms "end capped" or "terminally capped" are interchangeably<br>
used herein to refer to a terminal or endpoint of a polymer having an end-capping moiety. Typically, although not necessarily, the end-capping moiety comprises a hydroxy or C1-20 alkoxy group. Thus, examples of end-capping moieties include alkoxy (e.g., methoxy, ethoxy and benzyloxy), as well as aryl, heteroaryl. cyclo, heterocyclo,<br>
and the like. In addition, saturated, unsaturated, substituted and unsubstituted forms of each of the foregoing are envisioned. Moreover, the end-capping group can also be a silane. The end-capping group can also advantageously comprise a detectable label. When the polymer has an end-capping group comprising a detectable label, the amount or location of the polymer and/or the moiety (e.g., active agent) of interest to which the polymer is coupled to can be determined by using a suitable detector. Such labels include, without limitation, fluorescers, chemiluminescers, moieties used in enzyme labeling, colorimetric (e.g., dyes), metal ions, radioactive moieties, and the like. Suitable detectors include, photometers, films, spectrometers, and the like.<br>
[0050]	"Non-naturally occurring" with respect to a polymer or water-soluble<br>
polymer means a polymer that in its entirety is not found in nature. A non-naturally occurring polymer or water-soluble polymer may, however, contain one or more subunils or portions of a subunit that are naturally occurring, so long as the overall polymer structure is not found in nature.<br>
[0051]	The term "water-soluble: polymer" is any polymer that is soluble in<br>
water at room temperature. Typically, a water-soluble polymer will transmit at least about 75%, more preferably at least about 95% of light, transmitted by the same solution after filtering. On a weight basis, a water-soluble polymer will preferably be at least about 35% (by weight) soluble in water, more preferably at least about 50% (by weight) soluble in water, still more preferably about 70% (by weight) soluble in water, and still more preferably about 85% (by weight) soluble in water. It is still more preferred, however, that the water-soluble polymer is about 95% (by weight) soluble in water and most preferred that the water-soluble polymer is completely soluble in water.<br>
[0052]	Molecular weight in the context of a water-soluble polymer of the<br>
invention, such as PEG. can be expressed as either a number average molecular weight or a weight average, molecular weight. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to molecular weight herein refer to the weight average molecular weight. Both molecular weight determinations, number average and weight average, can be measured using gel permeation chromalography or other liquid chromatography techniques. Other methods for measuring molecular weight values can also be used, such as the use of<br>
end-group analysis or the measurement of colligative properties (e.g., freezing-pint depression, boiling-point elevation, or osmotic pressure) to determine number average molecular weight or the use of light scattering techniques, ultracentrifugation or viscometry to determine weight average molecular weight. The polymers of the invention are typically polydisperse (i.e., number average molecular weight and weight average molecular weight of the polymers are nol: equal), possessing low polydispersity values of preferably less than about 1,2, more preferably less than about 1.15, still more preferably less than about 1.10, yet still more preferably less than about 1.05, and most preferably less than about 1.03.<br>
 [0053]	As used herein, the term "carboxylic acid" is a moiety having a — C-OH<br>
functional group [also represented as a "-COOH" or -C(O)OH], as well as moieties that are derivatives of a carboxylic acid, such derivatives including, for example, protected carboxylic acids. Thus, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, the term carboxylic acid includes not only the acid form, but corresponding esters and protected forms as well, With regard to protecting groups suited for a carboxylic acid and any other functional group described herein, reference is made to Greene et al, "PROTECTIVE GROUPS IN ORGANIC: SYNTHESIS" 3rd Edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1999.<br>
[0054]	The form "reactive" or "activated" when used in conjunction with a<br>
particular functional group, refers to a reactive functional group that reacts readily with an electrophile or a nucleophile on another molecule. This is in contrast to those groups that require strong catalysts or highly impractical reaction conditions in order to react (i.e., a "nonreactive" or "inert" group).<br>
[0055]	The terms "protected" or "protecting group" or "protective group" refer<br>
to the presence of a rnoiety (i.e., the, protecting group) that prevents or blocks reaction of a particular chemically reactive functional group in a molecule under certain reaction conditions. The projecting group will vary depending upon the type of chemically reactive functional group being protected as well as the reaction conditions to be<br>
employed and the presence of additional reactive or protecting groups in the molecule, if any. Protecting groups known in the art ean be found in Greene et al,, supra.<br>
[0056]	As used herein, the term "functional group" or any synonym thereof is<br>
meant, to encompass protected forms thereof.<br>
[0057]	The terms "spacer" or "spacer moiety" are used herein to refer to an<br>
atom or a collection of atoms optionally used to link one moiety to another, such as a water-soluble polymer segment to an aromatic-containing moiety. The spacer moieties of the invention may be hydro!ytically stable or may include one or more physiologically hydrolyzable or enzymatically degradable linkages.<br>
[0058]	An "organic radical" as used includes, for example, alkyl, substituted<br>
alkyl, alkeayl, substituted alkenyl, alkynyl, substituted alkynyl, aryl and substituted aryl.<br>
10059J	"Alkyl" refers to a hydrocarbon chain, typically ranging from about 1 to<br>
20 atoms in length. Such hydrocarbon chains are preferably but not necessarily saturated and may be branched or straight chain, although typically straight chain is preferred. Exemplary alkyl groups include ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, 1-melhylbutyl, 1 -ethylpropyl, 3-meihylpentyl, and the like. As used herein, "alkyl." includes cycloalkyl when three or more carbon atoms are referenced and lower alkyl.<br>
[0060]	"Lower alkyl" refers to an alkyl group containing from 1 to 6 carbon<br>
atoms, and may be straight chain or branched, as exemplified by methyl, ethyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, and tert-butyl.<br>
[0061]	"Cycloalkyl" refers to a saturated or urisaturated cyclic hydrocarbon<br>
chain, including bridged, fused, or spiro cyclic compounds, preferably made up of 3 to about. 12 carbon atoms, more preferably 3 to about 8,<br>
[0062]	"Non- interfering subslituents" are those groups that, when present in a<br>
molecule, are- typically non-reactive with other functional groups contained within the<br>
molecule.<br>
[0063]	The term "substituted" as in, for example, "substituted alkyl," refers to a<br>
moiety (c.g , an alkyl group) substituted with one or more non-interfering substitucnts, such as, but not limited to: C3-C8 cycloalkyl, e.g., cyclopropyl, cyciobutyl, and the like; halo, e.g., fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo; cyano; alkoxy, lower phenyl (e.g., 0-2 substituted phenyl); substituted phenyl; and the like. "Substituted aryl" is aryl having one or more non-interfcring groups as a subsrituent. For substitutions on a phenyl ring, the substitucnts may be in any orientation (i.e., ortho, meta, or para).<br>
[0064]	"Alkoxy" refers to an -O-R group, wherein R is alkyl or substituted<br>
alkyl, preferably (,Y C1-C20 alkyl (e.g., mcthoxy, cthoxy, propyloxy, benzyl, etc.), preferably C1-C7 alkyl.<br>
[0065]	As used herein, "alkenyl" refers to a branched or unbranched<br>
hydrocarbon group of 1 to 15 atoms in length, containing at least one double bond, such as etheuyl, n-propenyl, isopropenyl, n-butenyl. isobutenyl, octenyl, decenyl, tetradecenyl, and the like.<br>

hydrocarbon group of 2 to 15 atoms in length, containing at least one triple bond, ethynyl, n-bulynyl, i.sopentynyl, octynyl, decynyl, and so form.<br>
[0067]	"Ary!" means one or more aromatic rings, each of 5 or 6 core carbon<br>
atoms. Aryl includes multiple aryl rings that may be fused, as in naphthyl or unfused, as in biphenyl. Aryl lings may also be fused or unfused with one or more cyclic hydrocarbon, hoterouryl, or heterocyclic rings. As used herein, "aryl" includes heteroaryl. An aromatic moiety (e.g., Ar1, Ar2 , and so forth), means a structure containing aryl.<br>
[0068]	"Heteroaryl" is an aryl group containing from one to four heteroatorns,<br>
preferably N, O, or S, or a combination there of. Heteroaryl rings may also be fused with one or more cyclic hydrocarbon, heterocyclic, aryl, or heteroaryl rings.<br>
[0069]	"Heterocycle" or "heterocyclic" means one or more rings of 5-12 atoms,<br>
preferably 5 •7 atoms, with or without unsaturation or aromatic character and having at<br>
least one ring atom which i.s not a carbon. Preferred heteroatoms include sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen.<br>
[0070]	"Substituted heteroaryl" is heteroaryl having one or more non-interfering<br>
groups as substituonfs.<br>
[0071]	"Substituted heterocycie" is a heterocycle having one or more side<br>

[0073]	"Nneleophile" refers to an ion or atom or collection of atoms that may<br>
be ionic having a rmcleophilic center, i.e., a center that is seeking an eleclrophilic center or with an electrophile.<br>
[0074]	A "physiologically clcavablc" or "hydrolyzable" bond is a relatively<br>
weak bond that reacts with water (i.e., is hydrolyxed) under physiological conditions. The tendency of a bond to hydrolyze in water will depend not only on the general type of linkage connecting two central atoms but also on the substituents attached to these central atoms. Appropriate hydrolytically unstable or weak linkages include, but are not limited to, carboxylate est«r, phosphate ester, anhydrides, acetals, ketala, acyloxyalkyl ether, iniines, ortho esters, peptides and oligonucleotides.<br>
[0075]	A "dcgradable linkage" includes, but is not limited to, a physiologically<br>
cleavablo bond , a hydrolyzable bond, and an enzymatically degradable linkage. Thus, a "degradable linkage" is a linkage that may undergo either hydrolysis or cleavage by some other mechanism (e.g., enzyme-catalyzed, acid-catalyzed, base-catalyzed, and so forth) under physiological conditions. For example, a "degradable linkage" can involve an elimination reaction that has a base abstraction of a proton, (e.g., an ionizable hydrogen atom, Hα), as the driving force.<br>
[0076]	An "enx.ymalically degnulable linkage" means a linkage that is subject to<br>
degradation by one or more enzymes.<br>
[0077]	A "hydrolytically stable" linkage or bond refers to a chemical bond,<br>
typically a covalent bond, that is substantially stable in water, that is to say, does not undergo hydrolysis under physiological conditions to any appreciable extent over an extended period of time. Examples of hydrolytically stable linkages include but are not limited to the following: carbon-carbon bonds (e.g., in aliphatic chains), ethers, amides, urcthancs (carbamates), and the like. Generally, a hydrolytically stable linkage is one that exhibits a rate of hydrolysis of less than about 1-2% per day under physiological conditions. Hydrolysis rates of representative chemical bonds can be found in most standard chemistry textbooks. It must be pointed out that some linkages can he hydrolyticaJly stable or hydrolyzable, depending upon (for example) adjacent and neighboring atoms and ambient conditions. One of ordinary skill in the art can determine whether a given linkage or bond is hydrolytically stable or hydrolyzable in a given context by, for example, placing a linkage-containing molecule of interest under conditions of interest and testing for evidence of hydrolysis (e.g., the presence and amount of two molecules resulting from the cleavage of a single molecule). Other approaches known to those; of ordinary skill in the art for determining whether a given linkage or bond is liydrolytically stable or hydrolyzable can also be used.<br>
[0078]	The terms "active agent," "biologically active agent" and<br>
"pharmacologically active agent" are used interchangeably herein and are defined to include any agent, drug, compound, composition of matter or mixture that provides some pharmacology, often beneficial, effect that can be demonstrated in vivo or in vitro. This includes foods, food supplements, nutrients, nutriceuticals, drugs, proteins, vaccines, antibodies, vitamins, and other beneficial agents. As used herein, these terms further include any physiologically or pharmacologically active substance that produces a localized or systemic effect in a patient.<br>
[0079]	"Pharmaceutically acceptable excipicnt" or "pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier" refers to an excipient that can be included in the compositions of the invention and that causes no significant adverse toxicological effects to the patient.<br>
[0080]	"Pharmacologically effective amount," "physiologically effective<br>
amount," and "therapeutically effective amount" are used interchangeably herein to<br>
mean the amount of a polymer active agenl conjugate — typically present in a pharmaceutical preparation -- that is needed to provide a desired level of active agent and/or conjugate in the bloodstream or in a target tissue. The exact amount will depend upon numerous factors, e.g., the particular active agent, the components and physical characteristics of the pharmaceutical preparation, intended patient population, patient considerations, and the like, and can readily he determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, based upon the information provided herein and available in the relevant literature.<br>
[0081]	"Multifunctional" in the context of a polymer of the invention means a<br>
polymer having 3 or more functional groups contained therein, where the functional groups may be the same or- different. Multifunctional polymers of the invention will typically coutain from about 3-100 functional groups, or from 3-50 functional groups, or from 3-25 functional groups, or from 3-15 functional groups, or from 3 to 10 functional groups, or will contain 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 functional groups within the polymer. A "difunctional" polymer means a polymer having two functional groups contained therein, either the same (i.e., homodifmictional) or different (i.e., heterodifunctional).<br>
[0082]	"Branched," in reference to the geometry or overall structure of a<br>
polymer, refers to polymer having 2 or more polymer "arms." A branched polymer may posses:; 2 polymer arms, 3 polymer arms, 4 polymer arms, 6 polymer arms, 8 polymer array or more. One particular type of highly branched polymer is a dendritic polymer or dendrimer, which, for the purposes of the invention, is considered to possess a structure distinct from that of a branched polymer.<br>
[0083]	A "dendrimcr" or dendritic polymer is a globular, size ruonodisperse<br>
polymer in which all bonds emerge radially from a central focal point or core with a regular branching pattern and with repeat units that each contribute a branch point. Dendrimers exhibit certain dendritic state properties such as core encapsulation, auiking them unique from other types of polymers.<br>
[0084]	A basic or acidic readmit described herein includes neutral, charged, and<br>
any corresponding salt forms thereof.<br>
 [0085]	The term "patient," refers to a living organism suffering from or prone to<br>
a condition that can be prevented or treated by administration of a conjugate as provided berem, and includes both humans and animals.<br>
[0086]	As used herein, the term "ionizable hydrogen atom" ("Hα") means a<br>
hydrogen atom thai: can be removed in the presence of a base, often a hydroxide or amine bast.'. Typically, the "ionizable. hydrogen atom" ("Hα") will be a hydrogen atom attached to a carbon atom that, in turn, is attached to one or more aromatic moieties or another group or groups that in some way stabilize the carbanion that would form from loss of the ionizable hydrogen atom as a proton (or the transition state leading to said carbanion).<br>
[0087]	As used herein, "drug release rate" means a rate (stated as a half-life) in<br>
which half of the total amount of polymer- active agent conjugates in a system will cleave into the active agent and a polymeric residue.<br>
|0088j	"Optional" and "optionally" mean that the subsequently described<br>
circumstance may or may not occur, so that die description includes instances where the circumstance occurs and instances where it does not.<br>
[0089]	As used herein, the "halo" designator (e.g., fluoro, chloro, iodo, bromo,<br>
and so forth) is generally used when the halogen is attached to a molecule, while the suffix "ide" (e.g., fluoride, chloride, iodide, bromide, and so forth) is used when the halogen exists in its independent ionic form (e.g., such as when a leaving group leaves a molecule).<br>
[0090]	In the context of the present discussion, it should be recognized that the<br>
definition of a variable provided with respect to one structure or formula is applicable to the same variable repeated in a different structure, unless the context dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, the definition of "POLY," "spacer moiety," "Rel" and so forth with respect to a polymeric reagent is equally applicable to a conjugate provided herein.<br>
 [0091]	As previously stated, the present invention comprises (among other<br>
things) polymeric reagents useful in providing conjugates having a degradable linkage between a polymer and another moiety. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the conjugates are believed to degrade in such as way as to minimize or eliminate entirely any residue or "tag" of the polymeric reagent used to form the conjugate. As a consequence, it is possible — upon hydrolysis of a conjugate formed from the reaction of a polymeric reagent described herein with an amine-containing active agent — to regenerate or recover the original unconjugated and unmodified form of the active agent.<br>
[0092]	As discussed herein and as evidenced by the formulae provided herein,<br>
the polymeric reagents of the invention comprise one or more water-soluble polymers (e.g., "POLY1" and "POLY2" as set forth in various formulae provided herein), an<br>
aromatic-containing moiety bearing an ionizable hydrogen atom, Hα; (e.g., "	<br>
as set forth in various formulae provided herein), and a functional group capable of reacting with an ammo group of an active agent to form a degradable linkage [e.g., "(FG)" as set forth in various formulae provided herein]. In addition, various components of the described polymeric reagents can be attached to the rest of the polymeric reagent through an optional spacer moiety (e.g., as "X", "X1", "X " and "X " as set forth in various formulae provided herein). In addition one, two, three, four or more electron altering groups (e.g., "Re", "Rel", "Re2", Re3", "Re4" and so forth as set forth in various formulae provided herein) can be attached to the aromatic-containing moiety (in both the polymeric reagent as well as the conjugate).<br>
[0093]	Before describing exemplary polymeric reagents of the invention,<br>
embodiments of a water-soluble polymer, an aromatic moiety, a functional group capable of reacting with an amino group of an active, agent to form a degradable linkage, such as a carbarnute linkage, an electron altering group, and a spacer moiety will first be discussed. The following descriptions of a water-soluble polymer, an aromatic moiety, an electron altering group, and a spacer moiety are applicable not only to the polymeric reagent, hut to the corresponding conjugates formed using the described polymeric reagents.<br>
[0094]	With respect to a given water-soluble polymer, each water-soluble<br>
polymer (e.g., POLY, POLY1 and POLY2) can comprise any polymer so long as the polymer is water-soluble and non-peptidie. Although preferably a poly(ethylene glycol), a water soluble polymer for use herein can be, for example, other water-soluble polymers such as oilier poly(alkylene glycols), such as polypropylene glycol) ("PPG"), copolymers of ethylene glyco! and propylene glycol and the like, poly(olefinic alcohol), poly(vinylpyrrolidoue), poly(hydroxyalkylrnethacrylamide),<br>
poly(hydroxyalkyhnethacrylate), poly(saccharides), poly(a-hydroxy acid), poly(vinyl alcohol), polypbospha/ene, polyoxazoHne, poly(N-acryloylmorpholine), such as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,629,384. The water soluble polymer can be a homopolymer, copolymer, terpolyraer, nonrandorn block polymer, and random block polymer of any of the foregoing. In addition, a water-soluble polymer can be linear, but can also be in oilier forms (e.g., branched, forked, and the like) as will be described in further detail below. In the context of being present within an overall structure, a water-soluble polymer has from 1 to about 300 termini.<br>
[0095]	In instances where the polymeric reagent comprises two or more<br>
water-soluble polymers, each water-soluble polymer in the overall structure can be the same or different. It is preferred, however, that all water-soluble polymers in the overall structure are of the same type. For example, it is preferred that all water-soluble polymer;; within a given structure are each a poly(ethylene glycol).<br>
[0096]	Al though the weight, average molecular weight of any individual<br>
water-soluble polymer can vary, the weight average molecular weight of any given water-soluble polymer will typically he, in the following range: 100 Daltons to about 150,000 Daltons. lixemplary ranges, however, include weight-average molecular weights in the following ranges: about 880 Daltons to about 5,000 Daltons; in the range of greater than 5,000 Daltons to about 100,000 Daltons; in the range of from about 6,000 Daltons to about 90,000 Daltous; in the range of from about 10,000 Daltons to about 85,000 Daltons; in the range of greater than 10,000 Daltons to about 85,000 Dal tons; in the range o. from about 20,000 Daltons to about 85,000 Daltons; in the range of from about 53,000 Daltons to about 85,000 Daltons; in the range of from about 25,000 Daltons lo about 120,000 Daltons; in the range of from about 29,000 Daltons to<br>
about 120,000 Daltons; in the range of from about 35,000 Daltons to about 120,000 Daltons; in the range of about 880 Dalrons to about 60,000 Daltons; in the range of about 440 Daltons ro about 40,000 Daltons; in the range of about 440 Daltons to about 30,000 Daltons; and. in the range of from about 40,000 Daltons to about 120,000 Daltons. For any given water-soluble polymer, PEGs having a molecular weight in one or more of these ranges are preferred.<br>
[00.97]	Exemplary weight-average .molecular weights for the water-soluble,<br>
polymer include about 100 DaJtons, about 200 Daltons, about 300 Daltons, about 400 Daltons, about 440 Daltons, about 500 Daltons, about 600 Daltons, about 700 Daltons, about 750 Daltons, about 800 Daltons, about 900 Daltons, about 1,000 Daltons, about 1,500 Daltons, about 2,000 Daltons, about 2,200 Daltons, about 2,500 Daltons, about 3,000 Daltons, about 4,000 Daltons, about 4,400 Daltons, about 4,500 Daltons, about 5,000 Daltons, about 5,500 Daltons, about 6,000 Daltons, about 7,000 Daltons, about 7,500 Daltons, about 8,000 Daltons, about 9,000 Daltons, about 10,000 Daltons, about 11,000 Daltons, about 12,000 Daltons, about 13,000 Daltons, about 14,000 Daltons, about 15,000 Daltons, about 16,000 Daltons, about 17,000 Daltons, about 1.8,000 Daltons, about 19,000 Daltons, about 20,000 Daltons, about 22,500 Daltons, about 25,000 Daltons, about 30,000 Daltons, aboul 35,000 Daltons, about 40,000 Daltons, about 45,000 Daltons, about 50,000 Daltous, about 55,000 Daltons, about 60,000 Daltons, about 65,000 Daltons, about 70,000 Daltons, and about 75,000 Daltons. Branched versions of the water-soluble polymer (e.g., a branched 40,000 Dalton water-soluble polymer comprised of two 20,000 Dalton polymers) having a total weight average molecular weight of any of the foregoing can also be used.<br>
[0098]	In one or more embodiments of the invenlion, the polymeric reagent will<br>
comprise a water-soluble polymer having a size in the range suited for the desired rate of release of the conjugate formed therefrom. For example, a conjugate having a relatively long release rate can be prepared from a polymeric reagent having a size .suited for (a) extended circulation prior to degradation of the conjugate, and (b) moderately rapid in vivo clearance of the water-soluble polymer remainder upon degradation of the conjugate. Likewise, when the conjugate has a relatively fast release rate, then the polymeric reagent would typically have a lower molecular weight,<br>
 [0099]	When a PEG is used as the water-soluble polymer in the polymeric<br>
reagent, the PUG typically comprises a number of (OCH2CH2) monomers [or (CH2CH2O) monomers, depending on how the PEG is defined]. As used throughout the description, the number of repeating units is identified by the subscript "n" in "(OCH2CH2),..."   Thus, the value of (n) typically falls within one or more of the following ranges: from 2 to about 34-00, from about 4 to about 1500, from about 100 to ubout 2300, from about 100 to about 2270, from about 136 to about 2050, from about 225 to about 1930, from about 450 to about 1930, from about 1200 to about 1930, from about 568 to about 2727, from about 660 to about 2730, from about 795 to about 2730, from about 795 to about 2730, from about 909 to about 2730, and from about 1,200 to about 1,900. For any given polymer in which the molecular weight is known, it is possible to determine the number of repeating units (i.e., "n") by dividing the total weight-average molecular weight of the polymer by the molecular weight of the repeating monomer.<br>
[0100]	Bach water-soluble polymer is typically biocompatible and<br>
non-imrnunogenic.  With respect to biocompatibility, a substance is considered biocompatible il" the beneficial effects associated with use of the substance alone or with another substance (e.g., an active agent) in connection with living tissues (e.g., administration to a patient) outweighs any deleterious effects as evaluated by a clinician, e.g., a physician. With respect to non-imniununogenicity, a substance is considered non-imniunogenic if use of the substance alone or with another substance in connection with living tissues does not produce an immune response (e.g., the formation of antibodies) or, if an immune response is produced, that such a response is not deemed clinically significant or important as evaluated by a clinician. It is particularly preferred that the water-soluble polymers, described herein as well as conjugates of active agents and the polymers arc biocompatible andnon-immunogenic.<br>
[0101]	In one form useful, iree or nonbound PEG is a linear polymer terminated<br>
at each end with hydimyl groups:<br>
HO CH2CH2O-(CH2CH20)m-CH2CH2-OH<br>
wherein (m1) typically ranges from zero to about 4,000, preferably from about 20 to about 1,000.<br>
[0102]	The above polymer, alpha-,omega-dihydroxylpoly(ethylene glycol), can<br>
be represented in brief form as IIO-PEG-OH. where it is understood that the -PEG-symbol can represent the following structural unit:<br>
-CH2CH?.O- •(CH2CH2O)m'-CH2CH2-<br>
where (m1) is as defined as above.<br>
[0103]	Another type of free or nonbound PEG useful in the present invention is<br>
methoxy-PEG-OH, or mPRG in brief, in which one terminus is the relatively inert methoxy group, while the other terminus is a hydroxyl group. The structure of mPEG is given below.<br>
where (m') is as described above.<br>
[0104]	Multi-armed or branched PEG molecules, such as those described in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,932,462, can also be used as the PEG polymer. For example, PEG can have the stracture:<br>
(Stracture Removed)<br>
wherein:<br>
poly;i and polyt are PEG backbonevS (eitlier the same or different), such as<br>
methoxy po!y(ethylene glycol);<br>
R" is a nonractive moiety, such as H, methyl or a PEG backbone; and<br>
P and Q arc-, nonreactive linkages. Ir; a preferred embodiment, the branched<br>
PEG polymer is methoxy poly(ethylenc glycol) disubstituted lysine.<br>
[0105]	In addition, the PEG can comprise a forked PEG. An example of a free<br>
or nonbound forked Pl;G is represented by the following formula: <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein: X is a spacer moiety and each Z is an activated terminal group linked to CH by a chain of atmos of defined length. The chain of atoms linking the Z functional groups to the branching carbon atom serve as a tethering group and may comprise, for example, alkyl chains, ether chains, ester chains, amide chains and combinations thereof- U.S. Patent No. 6,362,254, discloses various forked PEG structures capable of use in the present invention.<br>
[0106J	The PEG polymer may comprise a pendant PEG molecule having<br>
reactive groups, such as carboxyl, covalentiy attached along the length of the PEG rather than at the end of the PFG chain. The pendant reactive groups can be attached to (lie PEG directly or through a spacer moiety, such as an aikyiene group,<br>
[0107]	In addition to the above-described forms of PEG, each water-soluble<br>
polymer in the polymeric reagent can also be prepared with one or more weak or degntdable linkages in the polymer, including any of the above described polymers. For example, PEG can be prepared with ester linkages in the polymer that are subject to hydrolysis. As shown below, this hydrolysis results in cleavage of die polymer into fragments of lower molecular weight:<br>
-PEG-CO2-PEG--+-H2O →  -PEG-CO2H + HO-PEG-<br>
[0108]	Other hydrojyticully degradable linkages, useful as a degradable linkage<br>
within a polymer backbone, include carbonate linkages; inline linkages resulting, for example, from reaction of an amine and an aldehyde (see, e.g., Ouchi etal. (1997) Polymer Preprints 38(1);582-3); phosphate ester linkages formed, for example, by reacting an alcohol with a phosphate group; hydrazonc linkages which are typically fanned by reaction of a hydrazide and an aldehyde; acetal linkages that are typically<br>
formed by reaction between an aldehyde and an alcohol; ortho ester linkages that are, tor example, formed by reaction between a formate and an alcohol; amide linkages formed by an amine group, e.g., at an end of a polymer such as PEG, and a carboxyl group of another PEG chain; urethane linkages formed from reaction of, e.g., a PEG with a terminal i.socyanate group and a PEG alcohol; peptide linkages formed by an amine group, e.g., at an end of a polymer such as PEG, and a carboxyl group of a peptide; and oligonucleotide linkages formed by, for example, a phosphoramidite group, e.g., at the end of a polymer, and a. 5' hydroxyl group of an oligonucleotide.<br>
[0109]	It is understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the term<br>
poly(efhylenc glycol) or PEG represents or includes all the above forms of PEG.<br>
[0110]	Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the foregoing<br>
discussion concerning substantially water-soluble polymers is by no means exhaustive and is merely illustrative, and that all polymeric materials having the qualities described above an; contemplated. As used herein, die term "water-soluble polymer" refers both to a molecule as well as the residue of water-soluble polymer that has been attached to another rnoiely.<br>
[0111]	Bach water-soluble polymer is attached (either directly or through a<br>
spacer moiety comprised of one or more atoms) to an aromatic-containing moiety bearing an ionizablc hydrogen atom. Thus, the aromatic-containing moiety serves as a point of attachment for one or more water-soluble polymers.<br>
[0112]	Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed to be<br>
advantageous to have the aromatic-containing moiety serve as a point of attachment for one or more water-soluble polymers. Specifically, by having each water-soluble polymer attached (either directly or through a spacer moiety) to the aromatic-containing moiety, the often toxic effects associated with aromatic species may be reduced through a steric or blocking effect provided by the water-soluble polymer. This steric or blocking effect can reduce or eliminate potentially damaging metabolic processes that potentially occur when administering some aromatic substances. Thus, the presently described polymeric reagents having two or more water-soluble polymers can provide conjugates that are believed to have reduced toxicity. Such an advantage is believed to<br>
differeritiate over other polymeric reagents (and corresponding conjugates) wherein, for example, a single branched water-soluble polymer is attached to an aromatic-containing moiety.<br>
[0113]	Although most any aromatic-containing moiety bearing an ionizable<br>
hydrogen atom can he used, the aromatic-containing rnoiety must provide a site or sites for attachment of various components. In addition, it must be recognized that the aromatic-containing moiety does not itself have to completely aromatic. The aromatic -containing moiety can, for example, contain one or more separate aromatic moieties optionally linked to each other directly or through a spacer moiety comprising one or more atoms.<br>
[0114]	In some instances the aromatic-moiety bearing an ionizable hydrogen<br>
atom will take the form of one of the following structures: <br>
(Structure Removed) <br>
wherein: Ar is a first aromatic moiety, Ar" is a second aromatic moiety, X' is a spacer moiety, and Z is an electron altering group, relative to H. Such electron altering groups groups are explained in further detail below. Preferred Z groups include, but are not limited to, -CF3, -CH2CF3, -CH2C6F3, -CN, -NO2, -S(O)R, -S(O)Aryl, -S(O2.)R, -S(O2)Aryl, -S(O2)OR, -S(O2)OAryl,, -S(O2)NHR, -S(O2)NHAryl, -C(O)R, -C(O)Aryl, -C(O)OR, -C(O)NHR, and the like, wherein R is H or an organic radical.<br>
[0115]	Exemplary aromatic moieties (which can be further substituted with one<br>
or more electron altering groups as will be former explained herein) include the following (where, in each case, the ionizable hydrogen atom of interest is a hydrogen attached to an aliphatic carbon adjacent to one or more of (lie aromatic rings, i.e. it is benzylic or benzylic like): <br>

and     ""G1      wherein each of G1, G2.G3G4, and G5 is<br>

wherein each<br>
of G1, G2,G3,G4,  and G5 is independently N, C-H or substituted carbon with the proviso that where any of G1, G2, G3, G4. and G5 of G is N, the adjacent atom must be C-H or a substituted carbon,<br>
10116.)	In one or more embodiments, the aromatic-containing moiety bearing an<br>
ionizable hydrogen atom optionally includes one or more electron altering groups ("Re", "Rel", "Rc2', and so forth). An electron altering group is a group that is either electron donating1 (and therefore referred to as an "electron donating group"), or electron withdrawing (and therefore referred to as an "electron withdrawing group"). When attached to the aromatic-containing moiety bearing an ionizable hydrogen atom, an electron donating group is a group having the ability to position electrons away from itself and closer to or within the aromatic-containing moiety. When attached to the aromatic-containing moiety bearing an ionizable hydrogen atom, an electron withdrawing group is a group having the ability to position electrons toward itself and away from the aromatic-containing moiety. Hydrogen is used as the standard for comparison in the determination of whether a given group positions electrons away or toward itself.<br>
[0117]	While not wishing to be bound by theory, electron altering groups — by<br>
changing the position of electrons (i.e., the "electron density") of the aromatic-containing moiety bearing an ionizable hydrogen atom — influence die ease by which the-- ionizable hydrogen atom ionizes. Thus, it is believed that electron withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the ionizable hydrogen atom while electron donating groups decrease the acidity of the ionizable hydrogen atom. Blectron donating and withdrawing groups affecting the acidity of the ionizable hydrogen atom include groups contained within the spacer moieties (e.g., X1, X2, X3 and so forth) serving to link various constituents of the structures provided herein.<br>
[0118]	Exemplary electron withdrawing groups include halo (e.g., bromo,<br>
fluoro, chloro, and iodo), nitro, carboxy, ester, formyl, keto, azo, amidocarbonyl, araJdosulfonyi, carboxaraido. sulfonoxy, sulfonamide, ureido, and aryl. Exemplary electron donating groups include hydroxyl, lower alkoxy (e.g., methoxy, ethoxy and the like), lower alkyl (such as methyl, ethyl, and the like), arnino, lower alkylamino, di-lower alkylamino, arvloxy (such as phenoxy and the like), arylalkoxy (such as phenoxy and the like), aminoarylt; (such as p-dimethylaminophenyl and the like), mercapto, and alkyl thio.<br>
[0119]	In one or more embodiments, the aromatic-containing moiety may<br>
include (in addition to one or more water-soluble polymers) one, two three, four, or more electron altering groups. Exemplary instances where the aromatic-containing moiety includes two electron altering groups are shown in the following structures below:<br>
(Structures Removed)<br>
wherein   —    is an aromatic -con!ahiiug moiety, Ar1 is a first aromatic moiety, Ar2 is a second aromatic moiety, Rel is an electron altering group, and Re is an electron altering group, while the ionizable hydrogen atom (i.e., H,,), the one or more water-soluble; polymers, and any other constituents that may be present are not shown. When each of Rel and RL'2 is different, (a) Rel and Rc2 can be different electron withdrawing groups, (b) Rcl and Re can be different electron donating groups, (c) or Rcl and Rc2 can be such that one is an electron withdrawing group and the other is an electron donating group. In many circumstances, however, each of Re and Re will be the same.<br>
[0120]	Typically, but not necessarily, placement of an electron altering group<br>
on the aromotic containing rnoiety bearing an ionizable hydrogen atom is often determined by the prol'erred entry point of electron altering groups added through<br>
aromatic electrophilic or nucleophilic substitution processes. For example, with a fluoreue ring, typical positions tor addition of electron altering groups by electrophilic aromatic substitution are the "2" and "7" positions. If these positions are occupied by a spacer moiety (which is attached to a water-soluble polymer) other positions on the fluorene ring will be substituted based on factors such as (a) the directing ability of the spacer moiety (e.g., X1 and X2), and (b) steric influences.   Often, however, the "4" and "5" positions of a fJuorene ring represent the more likely sites for attachment when trie "2" and "7" positions arc unavailable and especially when the alpha carbon, i.e., the 9-position in flnorene (i.e., the carbon bearing an ionizable hydrogen atom, Hα), is substituted. For illustration, the positions in the flnorene ring are identified on the following structure:<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
wherein, each of POLY1, POLY2, X1, X2, R\ R2, Hα and (FG) is as defined with respect to Formula I, infra. Although exemplary positions of electron altering groups and other groups have been referred to with respect to a fluorene ring, the present discussion of positional location of electron altering groups is applicable to other aromatic systems as well. One of ordinary skill in the art can determine the positional locations in other ring systems.<br>
[0121]	As previously indicated, electron altering groups can influence the<br>
acidity of the ionizable hydrogen atom of the aromatic-containing moiety in different ways depending on the nature of the particular electron altering group. For example, due to the proximity of electron altering groups at positions "1" and "8" to the ionizable hydrogen, atom in the flurocne ring shown above, electron altering groups at these positions would have the greatest influence through bond (inductive) effects. When the POLY1-X1- and POI.Y2-X2- are attached at the 2 and 7 positions, however, addition of<br>
an electron altering group at the 4 or 5 positions is more likely, for the reasons mentioned above (i.e., directing effects of the spacer moieties and steric effects). Electron altering groups that interact with the ring through resonance effects, such as amido, carboxy, nitro, and alkoxy groups, can provide the resonance effect at a significant distance from the alpha hydrogen. As a consequence, their placement relatively close to the ionizablc hydrogen atom may be less important. From another perspective, it may be advantageous to leave relatively close positions (e.g., the "1" and "4" positions) unsubstituted as the ionizable hydrogen atom that will ultimately become removed will likely be retarded by steric effects of electron altering groups at these positions. Again, til though exemplary positions of electron altering groups and other groups have been referred to with respect to a fiuorene ring, the present discussion of positional location is applicable to other ring systems as well; one of ordinary skill in the art can determine the corresponding positional locations in other ring systems.<br>
[0122]	To better understand the release reaction of a conjugate formed with a<br>
polymeric reagent of the invention (and to also demonstrate effect of electron altering groups on that process) and without any intent of being bound by theory, a proposed mechanism of the release process is provided. A schematic of the proposed mechanism is shown below utilizing a fiuorene moiety as the aromatic-containing moiety. In the schematic., an exemplary conjugate of the invention is shown wherein a carbamate linkage connects the residue of the active agent ("Drug") to the rest of the molecule. The variables "TOLY1," "POLY2," "X1," "X2," "R1" and "R2" are as previously defined.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
 [0123]	The release process is typically initiated by the attack of a basic<br>
molecule, ion, or species that has the capacity to accept a proton in a transfer process ("B:" as shown in the schematic). In vivo, this may be any one of several kinds of ionic species or a protein, which has several basic atoms. Elimination occurs to form a substituted fulvene moiety (or corresponding structure when a non-fluorene structure is employed), thereby leleasing the active agent or "drag" species, which may initially be attached to a carboxy group, which is rapidly lost under physiological conditions.<br>
[0124]	The release process can be concerted or stepwise. Regardless of the<br>
exact nature of the proton removal step, either a carbanion is formed as an intermediate or a transition state having carbanionic character is involved. Tims, electron donating groups attached to the aromatic rings, which retard the formation of carbanions, will retard the carbauion-formation process, thereby decreasing the release rate. Conversely, electron withdrawing groups, which facilitate the formation of carbanionic species and stabilize carbauiom'c transition states, will accelerate the carbanion formation process, thereby increasing the release rate.<br>
[0125]	Advantageously, by including one or more electron altering groups to<br>
the aromatic-containing moiety, it is possible to more closely provide the desired rate of the release of the active agent. By including one or more electron withdrawing groups<br>
on the aromatic- conlaining moiety, release is believed to increase, while the presence of one or more electron donating group is believed to decrease the rate of release. Thus, it is believed that the presence of one or more electron altering groups can provide relative stability or instability of a charged intermediate or transition state that may be involved in the release reaction. Accordingly, by including one or more such electron altering groups on the aromatic-containing moiety, it is possible to better customize a desired rate of release of the original active agent that was conjugated to a polymeric reagent of the invention.<br>
[0126)	It is possible to determine what effect such an electron altering group<br>
will have on the drug release tate of the conjugate by preparing a polymeric reagent having the proposed electron altering group, preparing a conjugate using this polymeric reagent, testing the conjugate for drug release rate over time, and comparing the drug release rate to n conjugate prepared with a control polymeric reagent.<br>
[0127]	To determine relative release rates of a conjugate in vitro, a conjugate<br>
can be prepared and studied. ,See Example 5, infra. The preparation of a glycine. conjugate is illustrated in the scheme below (where m-PEGO and OPEG-m each are defined as -O-Cll2Cll2-(OCn2CH2)irOCH3, wherein each n is from 4 to 1500).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
 [0128]	The release rate of this conjugate was studied under simulated in vivo<br>
conditions by observing the reaction in a buffered medium at a near-neutral pH. By following the appearance of the fulvene-containing moiety over time, one may calculate a half-life for the reaction resulting in release. This release rate can be<br>
qualitutively compared to the release rates of other glycine conjugates that differ by the number and/or type of electron altering groups. In doing so, one can determine the release rate for auy given species.<br>
[0129]	The functional group of the polymeric reagents described herein is a<br>
functional group capable of reacting with an arnino group of an active agent to form a degradabie linkage, such as a carbamate linkage. The invention is not limited with reaped to specific functional group so long as the functional group is capable of reacting with an amino group of an active agent to form a degradable linkage, such as a carbaiaatc linkage.  Exemphiry functional groups capable of reacting with an amino group of an active agent include those functional groups selected from the group consisting of active carbonates such as N-succinimidyl, 1-benzotriazolyl, imidazole, carbonate haiidcs (such as carbonate chloride and carbonate bromide), phenolates (such as p-nitrophenolatc) and so forth. Also, as a special case, if the active agent is available with the active aminc group converted into aa isocyantate or isothiocyanate group, then the functional group of the polymeric reagent can be hydroxyl as the reaction of these components provide' a degradable caibainult; linkage.<br>
[0130]	A spacer moiety (e.g., "X", "X1", "X2", "X3", and so forth) is any atom<br>
or series of atoms connecting one part of a molecule to another. For purposes of the present disclosure, however, a series of atoms is not a spacer moiety when the series of atoms is immediately adjacent to a polymer and the series of atoms is but another monomer such that the proposed spacer moiety would represent a mere extension of the polymer chain. For example, given the partial structure "POLY-X-," and POLY is defined as "CH3O(CH2CH2O)m,-" wherein (m) is 2 to 4000 and X is defined as a spacer moiety, the spacer moiety cannot bo deiined as "-CH2CH2O-" since such a definition would merely represent an extension of the polymer. In such a case, however, an acceptable spacer moiety could be defined as "-C<br>

Other specific spacer moieties have the following structures: -C(O)-NH-(CH2)1-6-NH-C(O)-, -NH-C(O)-NH-(CH2)1-6-NH-C(O)-, and -O--C(O)-NH-(CH2)1-6-NH-C(O)-, wherein the subscript values following each methylenc indicate the number ot'niethylenes<br>
contained in the structure, e.g., (CH2)1-6 means that the structure can contain 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 methyleaes. Additionally, any of the above spacer moieties may further include an ethylene oxide oiigoiner chain comprising 1 to 20 ethylene oxide monomer units [i.e., --(CH2CH2O)].20). That is, the ethylene oxide oiigoiner chain can occur before or after the spacer moiety, and optionally in between any two atoms of a spacer moiety comprised of two or more atoms. Also, the oligomcr chain would not be considered part of the spacer moiety if the oligomer is adjacent to a polymer segment and merely represent an extension of the polymer segment. Finally, it is noted that some spacer moieties include an atom or group of atoms that also function as an electron altering group; in such a cases, the inclusion of one or more additional "discrete" (i.e., not a part of a spacer moiety) electron altering groups may not be desired or necessary.<br>

[0168]	The polymeric reagents of the invention can be prepared in any number<br>
of ways. Consequently, the polymers provided herein are not limited to the specific technique or approach used in their preparation. Exemplary approaches for preparing the presently described polymer reagents, however, will be discussed in detail below<br>
[0169]	In one method for preparing a polymeric reagent, the method comprises:<br>
(a) providing an aromatic-containing moiety bearing a first attachment site, a second attachment site and an optional third attachment site; (b) reacting a functional group reagent with the first attachment site to result in the first attachment site bearing a functional group capable of reacting with an amino group of an active agent and result in a degiadable linkage, such as a carbamate; and (c) reacting a water-soluble polymer bearing a reactive group with the .second attachment site and, when present, the optional third attachment site to result in (i) the second attachment site bearing a<br>
water-soluble polymer through a spacer moiety, wherein the spacer moiety does not O.<br>
include a     °	moiety, and (ii) the optional third attachment site, when present,<br>
bearing a second water-soluble polymer through a spacer moiety, wherein the spacer<br>
moiety docs not include a not include a     0	moiety. In some instances, (b) is<br>
performed before step (c) while in other instances, (c) is performed before step (b).<br>
[0.1.70]	Thus, in this method for preparing a polymeric reagent, a required step is<br>
(a) providing an aromatic-containing moiety bearing a first attachment site, a second attachment site and an optional third attachment site. In the context of a synthetic preparation, it is understood that "providing" a material means to obtain the material (by, for example, synthesizing it or obtaining it commercially). An exemplary aromaHc-containing moiety, for illustrative purposes, is 9-hydroxyinelhyl-2,7-diaminoliuorene, as shown below.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
 [0171]	This aromatic-containing moiety,<br>
9-hydroxymethyl 2,7-diaminofluorenc, is an example of an aromatic-containing moiety having three attachment sites: a hydroxy] group at the 9 position and amino groups at each of the 2 and 7 positions. The aromatic-containing moiety can be provided in a base or salt form. With respect to 9-hydroxymethyl-2,7-diaminofluorene, it is possible to use the dihydrochloride form.<br>
[0172]	Having provided the aromatic-containing moiety, another step in the<br>
method broadly includes the step of reacting a water-soluble polymer bearing a reactive group with the attachment site(s) on the aromatic-containing moiety. Here, any art-known approach for attaching a water-soluble polymer to one or more attachment sites<br>
on the aromatic-containing moiety can be used and the method is not limited to the specific approach. For example, an amine reactive PEG (such as an N-succinimidyl ester-terminated rnPEG, formed, for example, from the reaction of N-hydroxysuccinimide and CH3O-CH2CH2-(OCH2CH2)-OCH2CH2-OCH2COOH with dicyclohexyl carbodiirnide (DCC) or diisopropyl carbodiirnide (DIG) as condensing agent and optionally in the presence of a base) can be reacted with amine bearing aromatic-containing moiety such as 9-hydroxymethyl-2,7-diaminofluorene.<br>
[0173]	In some instances, reaction of the water-soluble polymer bearing a<br>
reactive group with the aromatic-containing moiety will result in all possible attacluueut sites having water-soluble polymer attached thereto. In such circumstances it is necessary to remove at least one water-soluble polymer so that an attachment site is made available for reaction with a functional group reagent. Thus, for example, reaction of the N-succinimidyl ester-terminated mPEG discussed in the previous paragraph with 9-hydroxymcthyl~2,7-diaminofluorene  results in a mixture comprising (a) a species hearing two water- soluble polymers, one at each of the two amhie sites, and (b) a species bearing three water-soluble polymers, one at each of the two amine sites, and one at the hydroxyl site. Here, it is possible to remove and collect higher molecular weight species by using size-cxclusion chromatography. In addition it is possible to treat the mixture to high pH [treating, for example, the mixture to lithium hydroxide (LiOII), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH)], followed by ioa-exchange chromatography (IEC). In either case, the result is a composition containing mostly 9-hydroxymethyl-2,7-diaminofluorene bearing two water-soluble polymers, one at each of the two amine sites. A third hydroxyl site is thereby available for reaction with a functional group reagent.<br>
[0174]	The final step is reacting a reactive site of the aromatic-containing<br>
moiety with a functional group reagent, A preferred approach is to react the hydroxyl-conlaining 9-hydroxyniethyl-2,7-diaminoflnoreno bearing two water-soluble, polymers, one at each of the two amine sites with triphosgcne followed by treatment with N-hydroxysucciniinidf.   In this way, a functional group capable of reacting with an amino group of an active agent to form a degradable linkage, such as a carbamatc<br>
linkage (in this case, an "activated carbonate") is formed on the hydroxyl-containing reactive site,<br>
[0175]	The steps of the method take place in an appropriate solvent. One of<br>
ordinary skill in the art can determine whether any specific solvent is appropriate for any given reaction. I'ypically, however, the solvent is preferably a nonpolar solvent or a polar aprotic solvent. Nonlimithlg examples of nonpolar solvents include benzene, xylene, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran (THF), f-butyl alcohol and toluene. Particularly preferred nonpolar solvents include toluene, xylene, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, and /-butyl alcohol, iixemplary polar aprotic solvents include, but are not limited to, DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), HMPA (hexamethylphosphoramide), DMF (dimelhylformauiide), DMA (dimethylacetamide), NMP (Ar-rnethyrpyrrolidiaone).<br>
[0176]	An alternative approach starts with fluorene diarnine, a readily available<br>
stalling material. A schematic of the reaction (showing the synthetic steps sufficient to provide a conjugate) is shown below<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
[0177]	In tins approach, carboxyl methyl-terminated PEG ("PEG-CM"<br>
available from Nektar Therapeutics) can be reacted with the fluorene diamine to provide an intermediate that can subsequently be used to form a conjugate with an active agent ("Drug-NH2"). The fluorene diamine has two amido groups attached to the aromatic nucleus and hence has a mild effect (relative to the hydrogens these groups replaced) on the. acidity (i.e., pKa value) of the ionizable hydrogen atom (i.e., Hα). Thus, the release rate of drug is moderate to slow.<br>
[0178]	Likewise, in another approach based on an amine reagent such as the<br>
commercially available mPEG propionic acid ester, "mPEG-SPA," the synthesis is slightly different but the net result on the drug release rate is minimal. A schematic of<br>
this approach (showing the synthetic steps sufficient to provide a conjugate) is shown below.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
[0179]	The difference in drug release rate is minimal because the aromatic ring<br>
substituents resulting from reaction with mPEG-CM and mPEG-SPA are similar.<br>
[0180]	One can modify the synthetic method significantly by augmenting the<br>
amine group by reaction will) a reagent like succinic anhydride or glutaric anhydride to give a terminal carboxylic acid. A schematic (showing the synthetic steps sufficient to provide a conjugate) of this approach is shown below.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
 [0181]	In this approach, the result allows for the use of a PEG amine as the<br>
PHGylating reagent as opposed to a PEG carhoxylic acid or active ester. Thus, it is possible to achieve yet another method for synthesis of the reagent but the net result on the release rate of the drug is not substantially changed, as the aromatic ring substituent remains an arnido group.<br>
[0182]	A significant change in drug release rate can be made to occur if one or<br>
more of the aromatic ring of the three reagents above, at some stage in the synthesis, is augmented by further substitution. For example, one may bring about ring substitution with, for example, a sulfonic acid group or a nitro group. Either of these groups, being strongly electron withdrawing, would have a significant effect on the acidity (pKa value) of the ionizable hydrogen atom (Hα).<br>
 [0183]	Another example to demonstrate the ability to influence the drug release<br>
rate in the final reagent-drug conjugate is illustrated below.<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
 [0184]	Here, the starting fluorene derivative contains a carboxylic acid group.<br>
This readily available raw material can be subjected to reaction conditions that allow introduction of an amino group in the remote aromatic ring. Then, using chemistry similar to that in the examples above, it is possible to provide a reagent that has an amido group on one aromatic ring and a carboxarnide group on the other ring. This combination of ring substitueiits is net electron withdrawing compared to those examples above iiial have two amido groups and hence the effect on the the acidity (pKa value) of the ionizuble hydrogen atom (Hα) is such that the drug release rate is enhanced.<br>
[0185]	A more significant enhancement to the drug release rate can be achieved<br>
by using a different type of amide linkage. It is possible to prepare sulf'onamides using the series of reactions illustrated below (showing the synthetic steps sufficient to provide a conjugate<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
[0186]	The sulfonyl groups attached to each ring, being highly electronegative<br>
groups, affect the. acidity (pKa value) of the ionizable hydrogen atom (Ha).  Hence, the drug release rates ot" these conjugates would be relatively fast.<br>
[0187]	In another example, a drug conjugate with an intermediate release rate is<br>
illustrated (showing the synthetic steps sufficient to provide a conjugate). <br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
|0188]	ln this case, using the commercially available isocyanate raw material, a<br>
ureido group and sulfonamido group are attached to the aromatic nuclei. The ureido group, like the aniido group above, has a mild effect but the sultbnamido group has a strong effect. The net result is that conjugates prepared from this reagent would have a release rate in between that of the bis sulfouaraidr. just discussed and the other conjugates discussed earlier.<br>
[0189]	One advantage that some synthetic routes have over others is the<br>
optional use of ion exchange chromatography to purify the reagent at an intennediate stage. Because there may be several impurities formed along the way, this may be a quite significant advantage to a method.<br>
[0190]	An example is shown below of the insertion via chemical reaction of an<br>
electron withdrawing sult'ouic acid group at an intennediate stage in the preparation of the glutaric anhydride modified diaminofluorene, from a synthesis illustrated above "m-PEG" and "PEG-m" represent methoxy poly(ethylene glycol).<br>
 (Figure &amp; Table Removed)<br><br>
[0191]	In this case, it is possible to block the hydroxyl group to prevent<br>
formation of the sulfate esler and then carry out an electrophiiic aromatic sulfonation process using chlorosulfonic acid. A mixture of mono- and disulfonation products may result. This mixture, if it forms, may be readily purified to provide either form in a rather pure state. Also, since that synthesis did not have an optional chromatography step already in place, this provides an opportunity to remove neutral impurities that may have been carried along from earlier steps.<br>
[0192]	An example of using a sulfonyl group both to enhance the acidity of the<br>
alpha hydrogen and as a site for addition of the polymer chain is shown in the schematic below. In this case the aromatic moiety contains a single pyridine ring in the commercially available alcohol, which serves as the starting point for making the polymeric reagent The presence of the nitrogen in the aromatic ring makes this ring more electron withdrawing, compared to a phenyl ring, and thus the acidity of the alpha hydrogen is increased. However, the acidity of the alpha hydrogen can be further increased to make it relatively more, removable. Attachment of a sulfonyl group increases the acidity of the hydrogen. The steps required to add the sulfonyl group are provided in the schematic below [wherein diBTC is di(l-benzotriazolyl)carbonate and BTC is a beiizotdazulyl radical].<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
 [0193]	The approach shown above demonstrates the addition of an electronic<br>
altering group (on a single ringed aromatic moiety and for a polymeric reagent containing a single water-soluble polymer. While two water-soluble polymers are preferred in some embodiments, other embodiments will prefer incorporation of a single, water-soluble, polymer (e.g., when the total size of the polymeric reagent is desired to be relatively small).<br>
[0194]	Other electron altering groups may be added in a similar fashion. For<br>
example, aromatic nitration by combining nitric acid in the presence of snlfuric acid results in a mtro gamp (.i.e., -NO2) being attached to the aromatic system. In addition, halogeaation methods such as combining the aromatic system with a halogen in the present of a metal catalyst (such as iron) results in a halo group being attached to the aromatic system. With regard to halogeuation niethods wherein a metal ion is present, it is preferred (for reasons explained herein) to first carry out the step of adding the halo group to the aromatic system and subsequently remove any metal ions and then attach one or more water-soluble polymers to the aromatic system. Further, alkylation and acylation methods such as a Friedcl-Crafts reaction can be used to add an electron altering alkyl or acyl group (respectively) to the aromatic system by adding an alkyl halide (e.g., isobutyl chloride) or acyl halidc (e.g., propionyl chloride) to the aromatic system in the presence of a metal catalyst (such as aluminum). Again, because a metal catalyst is typically icquired to carry out such reactions, it is preferred to first carry out the step of adding the alkyl gamp to the aromatic system, and subsequently remove any metal ions and then attach one or more water-soluble polymers to the aromatic system.<br>
[0195]	During preparation and handling of the polymeric reagents (as well the<br>
preparation and handling of the corresponding conjugates), it is preferred to prevent the introduction of nietal ions. For example, because metal ions are well known to be coordinated by PEGs, the avoidance of nietal ions is preferred. In addition, metal ions are known to catalyze PEG chain oxidation. In particular, when PEG is attached to an electron rich aromatic system, the presence of a metal ion coordinated to the PEG chain may provide a route for electron transfer from the aromatic nucleus to the PEG-metal ion complex and facilitate PEG chain cleavage. Thus, the invention includes methods and compositions wherein metal ions are substantially absent.<br>
[0196]	These and other approaches for preparing the polymeric reagents<br>
described herein can be used.<br>
[0197]	Once prepared, the polymeric reagents can be isolated. Known methods<br>
can be used to isolate the polymeric reagent, but it is particularly preferred to use chromatography, e.g., size exclusion chromatography. Alternately or in addition, the method includes the step of purifying the polymeric reagent once it is formed. Again, standard art known purification methods can be used to purify the polymeric reagent.<br>
[0198]	The polymeric reagents of the invention are sensitive to moisture and<br>
oxygen and are ideally stored under an inert atmosphere, such as under argon or under nitrogen, and at low temperature. In this way, potentially degradative processes associated vvith, for example, atmospheric oxygen, are reduced or avoided entirely. In some cases, to avoid oxidative degradation, antioxidants, such as butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT), can be added to the polymeric reagent prior to storage. In addition, it is preferred to minimize the amount of moisture associated with the storage conditions to reduce potentially damaging reactions associated with water, e.g. hydrolysis of the active ester. Moreover, it is preferred to keep the storage conditions dark in order to prevent certain degradative processes that involve light. Thus, preferred storage conditions include, one or more of the following: storage under dry argon or another dry inert gas; storage at temperatures below about -15 °C; storage in the absence of light; and storage, with a suitable amount (e.g., about 50 to about 500 parts per million) of an antioxidant such as BHT.<br>
[0199]	The above-described polymeric reagents are useful for conjugation to<br>
biologically active agents. For example, an ami.no group (e.g., primary amine) on an active agent will react with the functional group capable of reacting with an amino group of an active ap.ent to form a degradable linkage, such as a carbamate linkage. Thus, the invention comprises a conjugate formed with any polymeric reagent described herein.<br>

wherein each (n) is from 4 to 1500.<br>
[0227]	The biologically active agent to which a polymeric reagent as described<br>
herein can be conjugated, is an amine-containing biologically active agent. In some embodiments, the biologically active agent will be n small molecule (e.g., a biologically active agent that has a molecular weight of less than about 3,500 Daltons. In other<br>
embodiments, the biologically active agent will be a macromolecule, such as a polypeptide, having a molecular weight greater than about 3,500 Daltons. Pharmacologically active polypeptides represent a preferred type of biologically active agent. It should be understood that for purposes of the present discussion, the term "polypeptide" will be. generic for oligopeptides and proteins. With regard to polypeptides, the amine to which the polymeric reagent couples to can be on the N-terminus or an amine-containing side chain of an amino acid (such as lysine) within the polypeptide.<br>
[0228]	The invention also provides for a method of preparing a conjugate<br>
comprising the step of contacting a polymeric reagent of the invention with a biologically active agent under conditions suitable to form a covalent attachment between the polymer and the biologically active agent. Typically, the polymer is added to the active agent or surface at an equimolar amount (with respect to the desired number of groups suitable for reaction with the reactive group) or at a molar excess. For example, the polymeric reageni: can be added to the target active agent at a molar ratio of about 1:1 (polymeric reagent:acllve agent), 1.5:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 8:1, or 10:1. The conjugation reaction is allowed to proceed until substantially no further conjugation occurs, which can generally be determined by monitoring the progress of the reaction over time. Progress of the reaction can be monitored by withdrawing aliquots from the reaction mixture at various time points and analyzing the reaction mixture by SDS-PAGE or MALD1-TOF mass spectrornetry or any other suitable analytical method. Once a plateau is reached with respect to the amount of conjugate formed or the amount of unconjugated polymer remaining, the reaction is assumed to be complete. Typically, the conjugation reaction takes anywhere from minutes to several hours (e.g., from 5 minuter, to 24 hours or more). The resulting product mixture is preferably, but not necessarily purified, to separate out excess reagents, unconjugated reactants (e.g., active agent) undesired multi-conjugated species, and free or unreacted polymer. The resulting conjugates can then be further characterized using analytical methods such as MALDI, capillary electrophoresis, gel electrophoresis, and/or chromatography.<br>
 [0229]	With respect to polymer-active agent conjugates, the conjugates can be<br>
purified to obtain/isolate different conjugated species. Alternatively, and more preferably for lower molecular weight (e.g., less than about 20 kiloDaltons, more preferably less than about 10 kiloDaltons) polymers, the product mixture can be purified to obtain the distribution of water-soluble polymer segments per active agent. For example, the product mixture can be purified to obtain an average of anywhere from one to five PEGs per active agent (e.g., polypeptide). The strategy for purification of the final conjugate reaction mixture will depend upon a number of factors, including, for example, the molecular weight of the polymer employed, die particular active agent, the desired dosing regimen, and the residual activity and in vivo properties of the individual conjugare(s).<br>
[0230]	If desired, conjugates having different molecular weights can be isolated<br>
using gel filtration chromatography. That is to say, gel filtration chromatography is used to fractionate differently numbered polymer-to-active agent ratios (e.g., 1-mer, 2-mer, 3-mer, and so forth, wherein "1-mer" indicates 1 polymer to active agent, "2-mer" indicates two polymers to active agent, and so on) on the basis of their differing molecular weights (where the difference corresponds essentially to the average molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer segments). For example, in an exemplary reaction where a 100 kDa protein is randomly conjugated to a polymeric reagent having a molecular weight of about 20 kDa, the resulting reaction mixture will likely contain unmodified protein (MW 100 kDa), mono-PEGylated protein (MW 120 kDa), di-PEGylated protein (MW 140 kDa), and so forth. While this approach can be used to separate PEG and other polymer conjugates hnving different molecular weights, this approach is generally ineffective for separating positional isomers having different polymer attachment: sites within the protein. For example, gel filtration chromatography can be used to separate from each other mixtures of PEG 1-mers, 2-iners, 3-mers, and so forth, although each of the recovered PEG-mer compositions may contain PEGs attached to different reactive amino groups (e.g., lysine residues) within the active agent.<br>
[0231]	Gel filtration columns suitable for carrying out this type of separation<br>
include Superdox™ and Sephadex™ columns available from Amersham Biosciences<br>
 (Piscataway, NJ). Selection of a particular column will depend upon the desired frnctionation range de-sired. Elation is generally cnrried out using a suitable buffer, such as phosphate, acetate, or the like. The collected fractions may be analyzed by a number of different methods, for example, (i) optical density (OD) at 280 nm for protein content, (ii) bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein analysis, (iii) iodine testing for PEG content [Suns er al.(1980) Anal. Biochem, 107:60-63], and (iv) sodium dodecyl sulfphate polyacrylarnide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE), followed by staining with barium iodide.<br>
[0232]	Separation of positional isotners is carried out by reverse phase<br>
chromatography using a reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) C18 column (Amersnam Bioscierices or Vydac) or by ion exchange chromatography using an ion exchange column, e.g., a Sepharose™ ion exchange column available from Amersham Bioscienees. Either approach can be used to separate polymer-active agent isomers having the same molecular weight (positional isomers).<br>
[0233]	Following conjugation, and optionally additional separation steps, the<br>
conjugate mixture can be concentrated, sterile filtered, and stored at a low temperature, typically from about -20 °C to about -80 °C.   Alternatively, the conjugate may be lyophilized, either with or without residual buffer and stored as a lyophilized powder. In some instances, it. is preferable to exchange a buffer used for conjugation, such as sodium acetate, 1'or a volatile buffer such as ammonium carbonate or ammonium acetate, that can be readily removed during lyophilizatiou, so that the lyophilized powder is absent retridual buffer. Alternatively, a buffer exchange step may be used employing a formulation buffer, so that the lyophilized conjugate is in a form suitable for reconstitution into a formulation buffer and ultimately for administration to a mammal.<br>

[0236]	The present invention also includes pharmaceutical preparations<br>
comprising a conjugate as provided herein in combination with a pharmaceutical excipient. Generally, the conjugate itself will be in a solid form (e.g., a precipitate.), which can be combined with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient that can be in either solid or liquid form.<br>
[0237]	Exemplary excipients include, without limitation, those selected from<br>
the group consisting of carbohydrates, inorganic salts, antimicrobial agents, antioxidants, surfactants, buffers, acids, bases, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0238]	A carbohydrate such as a sugar, a derivatized sugar such as an alditol,<br>
aldonic acid, an esterified sugar, and/or a sugar polymer may be present as an excipient. Specific carbohydrate excipients include, for example: monosaccharides, such as fructose, maltose, galactose, glucose, D-niannose, sorbose, and the like; disaccharides, such as lactose, sucrose, trehalose, cellobiose, and the like; polysaccharides, such as<br>

[0244]	The pharmaceutical preparations encompass all types of formulations<br>
and in particular those that are suited for injection, e.g., powders that can be reconstituted as well as suspensions and solutions. The amount of the conjugate (i.e., the conjugate formed between the active agent and the polymer described herein) in the composition will vary depending on a number of factors, but will optimally be a therapeutically' effective dose when the composition is stored in a unit dose container (e.g., a vial). In addiliou, the pharmaceutical preparation can be housed in a syringe. A therapeutically effective dose can be determined experimentally by repeated administration of increasing amounts of the conjugate in order to determine which amount produces a clinically desired endpoint.<br>
[0245]	The amount of any individual excipient in the composition will vary<br>
depending on the activity of the excipient and particular' needs of the composition. Typically, the optimal amount of any individual excipient is determined through routine experimentation, i.e., by preparing compositions containing varying amounts of the excipient (ranging from low to high), examining the stability and other parameters, and then determining the range at which optimal performance is attained with no significant adverse effects.<br>
[0246]	Generally, however, the excipient will be present in the composition in<br>
an amount of about 1% to about 99% by weight, preferably from about 5%-98% by weight, more preferably from about 15-95% by weight of the excipient, with concentrations less than 30% by weight most preferred.<br>

[0248]	The pharmaceutical preparations of the present invention are typically,<br>
although not necessarily, administered via injection and are therefore generally liquid solutions or suspensions immediately prior to administration.

Other modes of administration are also included, such as pulmonary, rectal, transdennal, transmucosal, oral, intrathecal, subcutaneous, bitra-arterial, and so forth.<br>
[0249]	As previously described, the conjugates can be administered parenterally<br>
by intravenous injection, or less preferably by intramuscular or by subcutaneous injection. Suitable formulation types for parenteral administration include ready-for-injection solutions, dry powders for combination with a solvent prior to use, suspensions ready for injection, dry insoluble compositions for combination with a vehicle prior to use, and emulsions and liquid concentrates for dilution prior to administration, among others.<br>
[0250]	The invention also provides a method for administering a conjugate as<br>
provided herein to a patient suffering from a condition that is responsive to treatment with conjugate. The method comprises administering, generally via injection, a therapeutically effective amount of the conjugate (preferably provided as part of a pharmaceutical preparation). The method of administering may be used to treat any condition that can be remedied or prevented by administration of the particular conjugate. Those of ordinary skill in the art appreciate which conditions a specific conjugate can effectively treat. The actual dose to be administered will vary depend upon the age, weight, and general condition of the subject as well as the severity of the condition being treated, the judgment of the health care professional, and conjugate being administered. Therapeutically effective amounts are known to those skilled in the art and/or are described in the pertinent reference texts and literature, Generally, a therapeutically effective amount will range from about 0.001 mg to 100 mg, preferably<br>
in doses from 0.01 mg/day to 75 ing/day, and more preferably in doses from 0.10<br>
mg/day to 50 mg/day.<br>
[0251]	The unit dosage of any given conjugate (again, preferably provided as<br>
part of a pharmaceutical preparation) can be administered in a variety of dosing schedules depending on the judgment of the clinician, needs of the patient, and so forth. The specific dosing schedule will be known by those of ordinary skill in the art or can be determined experimentally using routine methods. Exemplary dosing schedules include, without limitation, administration five times a day, four times a day, three times a day, twice daily, once daily, three times weekly, twice weekly, once weekly, twice monthly, once monthly, and any combination thereof. Once the clinical endpoint has been achieved, dosing of the composition is halted.<br>
[0252]	It is to be understood that while the invention has been described in<br>
conjunction with the preferred specific embodiments thereof, that the foregoing description as well a.s the experimental that follow are intended to illustrate and not limit the scope of the invention. Other aspects, advantages and modifications within the scope of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains.<br>

conventional techniques of organic synthesis and the like, which are understood by one of ordinary skill in the art and are explained in the literature. In the following examples, efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to numbers used (e.g., amounts, temperatures, and so forth), but some experimental error and deviation should be accounted for. Unless otherwise indicated, temperature is in degrees Celsius and pressure is at or near atmospheric pressure at sea level. All reagents were obtained commercially unless otherwise indicated.

Preparation of an Exemplary Polymer-Protein Conjugate: Preparation of G2PEG2Fmoc2ok-Ntar-GLP-l<br>
[0331]	An illustrative polymeric reagent, G2PEG2Fmoc20k-NHS, was<br>
covalently attached to the N-terminus of an illustrative polypeptide, GLP-1, to provide a prodrug form of the protein wherein a releasable PEG-moiety is attached. The two-arm nature of the polymeric reagent provides increased stability to the GLP-1 moiety subsequent to administration, to thereby provide a sustained release formulation whereby GLP-1 is released from the conjugate via hydrolysis to provide the native or unmodified GLP-1 precursor. The structure of G2PEG2Pmoc20k-Ntar-GLP-1 is provided below (in the structure, "GLP-1" represents a residue of GLP-1). Other polypeptides and proteins can be substituted for GLP-1. <br>

In-Vivo Study in Mice to Examine the Blood-Glucose Lowering Effects of Illustrative GLP-1 Polymer Conjugates<br>
[0347]	Male diabetic mice (BKS.Cg-+Lepr db/+Lepr db/0laHsd) were<br>
purchased from Harlan Laboratories, Ltd. (Jerusalem, Israel). The 8-9 week old animals (30-40 gm) were placed in mouse cages (two animals per cage), and allowed at least 48 hours of acclimatization before the start of the study.<br>
[0348]	Preparation of G2PEG2Fmoc20k-Ntar-GLP-l (Example 6),<br>
G2PEG2Fmoc40k-Ntar-GLP-1 (Example 7), G2PEG2Fmoc20k-Lys-GLP-l (Example 8), and G2PEG2Fmoc40ok- Lys-GLP-1 (Example 9), were described in the preceding examples. Each compound was accurately weighed into a glass vial and dissolved in normal saline in order to prepare a concentration that would accommodate for the dose (based on GLP-1 equivalents) and the injection volume of 100 µL,<br>
[0349]	The study was divided into two phases: a feasibility phase and an<br>
evaluation phase.<br>
[0350]	In the feasibility phase, the feasibility of using diabetic db/db mice to<br>
test the effectiveness of GLP-1 was first evaluated. In carrying out the feasibility phase, several groups of mice were used wherein four mice were used in each group. Data on the baseline glucose levels were gathered for each mouse for 2-3 days prior to drug dosing. This was performed to identify any outliers in the group of animals. On the day of treatment (Day 0) each animal was weighed. A time 0 day blood sample (5 to 10 µL) was collected from the tail vein. The glucose level (mg/dL) was measured using a glucose analyzer. Each animal was then dosed subcutaneously (SC) below the skin on the back. The amount of test article and the dose (60 and 120 µg/mouse) administered was based on the average body weight of the animal, and the total volume of the dose did not exceed 10 mL/kg, The animals were then allowed to return into their cages. Blood samples of 5 to 10 µL (
tested for its glucose level. At the end of the study, the animals were humanely euthanized by carbon-dioxide asphyxiation.<br>
[0351]	In the evaluation phase, the results from the feasibility phase were used<br>
to select the appropriate doses required to attain a sustained delivery of GLP-1 for a 3-5 day effect In carrying out the evaluation phase, eight mice were used in each group. Data on the baseline glucose levels were gathered for each mouse three days prior to drug dosing. On the day of treatment (Day 0) each animal was weighed. A time 0 day blood sample (5 to 10 uL) was collected from the tail vein. The glucose level (mg/dL) was measured using a glucose analyzer. Each animal was then dosed subcutaneously (SC) below the skin on the back. The amount of test article administered was based on the average body sveight of the animal, and the total volume of the dose did not exceed 10 mL/kg. The animals were then allowed to return into their cages. Blood samples of 5 to 10 µL (

(Table Removed)<br>
 [0353]	The data from the study was collected and analyzed. It was noted that<br>
the animals tolerated the single subcutaneous dose. As illustrated in FIG. 14, the blood glucose-lowering effect of GLP-1 and each of the G2PEG2Fmoc20K-Lys-GLP-l (designated as "PEG20-Lys-GLPl" in the figure) and G2PEG2Fmoc40K-Lys-GLP-1 (designated as "PEG40-Lys-GLPl" in the figure) conjugates was confirmed. It can he seen from the pharmacudynamic (PD) measurements that GLP-1 was cleared rapidly from the mouse, but that the GLP-1 conjugates released the peptide over a period of 3 to 4 days. That is to say, the exemplary GLP-1 degradable conjugates of the invention function somewhat like a molecular pump, releasing intact GLP-l over time by in-vivo hydrolysis. The covalently attached hydrophilic polymer (i.e., PEG) functions not only to stabilize the GLP-1 in-vivo (i.e., by protecting the protein from enzymatic degradation), but also to extend its circulating half-life by slowly releasing the protein into the bloodstream over an extended period of 3 to 4 days. The 40 kiloDalton PEG conjugate was also observed to have a small but extended PD effect when compared to the 20 kiloDalton PEG conjugate,<br>
[0354]	The data from FIG. 14 suggest that: (a) GLP-1 is released into the<br>
mouse blood from the site of injection by diffusion and by hydrolysis from the PEGylated conjugate; and (b) the blood glucose-lowering activity of the lysine conjugated PEG-GLPl may be due to the combination of the activity of the intact conjugates and the apparent in-vivo release of the peptide from the subject conjugates.<br>
[0355]	FIG. 15 illustrates the blood glucose-lowering effect of GLP-1 and<br>
G2PEG2Fmoc-20K-Ntar-GLP-l (designated as "PEG20-His-GLPl" in the figure) and G2PEG2Fmoc40K-Ntar-GLP-l (designated as "PEG40-His-GLPl" in the figure). It is evident from the phannacodynamic (PD) measurements that GLP-1 is cleared rapidly from the mouse, but the PEG GLP-1 conjugates release the peptide over a period of 3 to 4 days. It is also observed that the PEG 40 kilodalton conjugate had a small but extended PD effect when compared to the PEG 20 kilodalton conjugate.<br>
[0356]	This set of data (FIG. 15) suggest that: (a) GLP-1 is released into the<br>
mouse blood from the site of injection by diffusion and by hydrolysis from the PEGylated conjugate; and (b) the Iristidine-conjugated PEG-GLPl is not active, and the<br><br>
blood glucose-lowering activity observed is the result of release of the peptide from the conjugate.<br>
[0357]	This study demonstrates that one injection of PEGylated GLP-1 as<br>
described herein can be used to control diabetes over an extended period of more than 48 hours. This study also demonstrates the sustained release property of the G2PEG2Fmoc reagents when conjugated to GLP-1. This study also showed that GLP-1 can be PEGylated at the N-terminus to provide a product for parenteral administration.<br>

= At/Amax (A, is HPLC peak area of released GLP-1 at time of t (hr) and Amox is HPLC peak area of GLP-1 reached its maximum release). Because the reaction kinetics represent a first order reaction due to the linearity of the plot, it can be concluded that lnl/(l-Y) = kt, where k is the slope, t1/2 = In2/k.<br>

The reaction flask was placed in a room temperature bath and succinic anhydride (5.72 g, 0.057 mol) was carefully added. The reaction was stirred for five hours and then cooled to 0 °C. The reaction was very carefully quenched by the slow portion-wise addition of 3 M HC1 (Caution! The reaction can react violently when HCl is added too rapidly.)   The final well mixed suspension was acidic and not reactive to additional HCl solution. The organic solvent was removed at reduced pressure and the product was filtered and washed well with water. The crude product was dissolved in warm NaOH solution (approximately ≤1M NaOH), filtered and precipitated with the addition of concentrated HCl.
