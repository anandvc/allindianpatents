EACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ART<br>
The present invention relates to parametric coding of the ste-<br>
reo image of an audio signal. Typical parameters used for de-<br>
scribing stereo image properties are inter-channel intensity<br>
difference (IID), inter-channel time difference (ITD), and in-<br>
ter-channel coherence (IC). In order to re-construct the stereo<br>
image based on these parameters, a method is required that can<br>
re-construct the correct level of correlation between the two<br>
channels, according to the IC parameter. This is accomplished<br>
by a de-correlation method.<br>

method for achieving this is by using a constant delay. How-<br>
ever, using a delay, or any other LTI all-pass functions, will<br>
result in non-all-pass response after adding the non-processed signal. In the case of a delay, the result will be a typical<br>

CROSS REFERENCE<br>
The instant Indian Patent Application constitutes a divisional application divided<br>
out from Indian Patent Application no. 2162/KOLNP/05 of 28.10.2005 which is<br>
now been granted of Indian Patent No. 242206.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to audio source coding systems but the same<br>
methods could also be applied in many other technical fields. Different<br>
techniques that are useful for audio coding systems using parametric<br>
representations of stereo properties are introduced.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to parametric coding of the stereo image of an<br>
audio signal. Typical parameters used for describing stereo image properties are<br>
inter-channel intensity difference (IID), inter-channel time difference (ITD), and<br>
inter-channel coherence (IC). In order to re-construct the stereo image based on<br>
these parameters, a method is required that can re-construct the correct level of<br>
correlation between the two channels, according to the IC parameter. This is<br>
accomplished by a de-correlation method.<br><br>
There are a couple of methods available for creation of decorrelated signals.<br>
Ideally, a linear time invariant (LTI) function with all-pass frequency response is<br>
desired. One obvious method for achieving this is by using a constant delay.<br>
However, using a delay, or any other LTI all-pass functions, will result in non-all-<br>
pass response after adding the non-processed signal. In the case of a delay, the<br>
result will be a typical comb-filter. The comb-filter often gives an undesirable<br>
"me-<br><br>
tallic" sound that, even if the stereo widening effect can be<br>
efficient, reduces much naturalness of the original.<br>
Frequency domain methods for generating a de-correlated signal<br>
by adding a random sequence to the IID values along the fre-<br>
quency axis, where different sequences are used for the differ-<br>
ent audio channels, are also known from prior art. One problem<br>
with frequency domain decorrelation by the random sequence<br>
modifications is the introduction of pre-echoes. Subjective<br>
tests have shown that for non-stationary signals, pre-echoes<br>
are by far more annoying than post-echoes, which is also well<br>
supported by established psycho acoustical principles. This<br>
problem could be reduced by dynamically adapting transform<br>
sizes to the signal characteristics in terms of transient con-<br>
tent. However, switching transform sizes is always a hard<br>
(i.e., binary) decision that affects the full signal bandwidth<br>
and that can be difficult to accomplish in a robust manner.<br>
United States patent application publication US 2003/0219130 Al<br>
discloses a coherence-based audio coding and synthesis. In par-<br>
ticular, an auditory scene is synthesized from a mono audio<br>
signal by modifying, for each critical band, an auditory scene<br>
parameter such as an inter-aural level difference (ILD) and/or<br>
an inter-aural time difference (ITD) for each subband within<br>
the critical band, where the modification is based on an aver-<br>
age estimated coherence for the critical band. The coherence-<br>
based modification produces auditory scenes having object<br>
widths, which more accurately match the widths of the objects<br>
in the original input auditory scene. Stereo parameters are the<br>
well-known BCC parameters, wherein BCC stands for binaural cue<br>
coding. When generating two different decorrelated output chan-<br>
nels, frequency coefficients as obtained by a discrete Fourier-<br>
transform are grouped together in a single critical band. Based<br>
on the inter-channel coherence measure, weighting factors are<br><br>
multiplied by a pseudo-random sequence which is preferably chosen such that<br>
the variance is approximately constant for all critical bands, and the average is<br>
"0" within each critical band. The same sequence is applied to the spectral<br>
coefficients of each different frame.<br>
Other examples of prior art are given in the patent applications WO 91 20167 A<br>
and WO 03 007656 A.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a decoding concept for<br>
parametrically encoded multi-channel signals or an encoding concept for<br>
generating such signals which result in a good audio quality and a good coding<br>
efficiency.<br>
This object is achieved by an apparatus for generating a decorrelation signal in<br>
accordance with claim 1, a multi-channel de-coder in accordance with claim 13, a<br>
method of generating a decorrelation signal in accordance with claim 20, a<br>
method of multi-channel decoding in accordance with claim 21, an apparatus for<br>
encoding a stereo signal in accordance with claim 22 or a method of encoding a<br>
stereo signal in accordance with claim 26 or a computer program in accordance<br>
with claim 27.<br><br>
The present invention is based on the finding that, on the decoding side, a good<br>
decorrelation signal for generating a first and a second channel of a multi-<br>
channel signal based on the input mono signal is obtained, when a reverberation<br>
filter is used, which introduces an integer or preferably a fractional delay into the<br>
input signal. Importantly, this reverberation filter is not applied to the whole<br>
input signal. Instead, several reverberation filters are applied to several<br>
subbands of the original input signal, i.e., the mono signal so that the<br>
reverberation filtering using the reverberation filters is not applied in a time<br>
domain or in the frequency domain, i.e., in<br><br>
the domain which is reached, when a Fourier transform is ap- plied. Inventively, the reverberation filtering using rever-<br>
beration filters for the subbands is individually performed in<br>
the subband domain.<br>
A subband signal includes a sequence of at least two subband<br>
samples, the sequence of the subband samples representing a<br>
bandwidth of the subband signal, which is smaller than the<br>
bandwidth of the input signal. Naturally, the frequency band-<br>
width of a subband signal is higher than a frequency bandwidth<br>
attributed to a frequency coefficient obtained by Fourier<br>
transform. The subband signals are preferably generated by<br>
means of a filterbank having for example 32 or 64 filterbank<br>
channels, while an FFT would have, for the same example, 1.024<br>
or 2.048 frequency coefficients, i.e., frequency channels.<br>
The subband signals can be subband signals obtained by subband-<br>
filtering a block of samples of the input signal. Alterna-<br>
tively, the subband filterbank can also be applied continuously<br>
without a block wise processing. For the present invention,<br>
however, block wise processing is preferred.<br>
Since the reverberation filtering is not applied to the whole<br>
signal, but is applied subband-wise, a "metallic" sound caused<br>
by comb-filtering is avoided.<br>
In cases, in which a sample period between two subsequent sub-<br>
band . samples of the subband is too large for a good sound im-<br>
pression at the, decoder end, it is preferred to use fractional<br>
delays in a reverberation filter such as a delay between 0.1<br>
and 0.9 and preferably 0.2 to 0.8 of the sampling period of the<br>
subband signal. It is noted that in case of critical sampling,<br>
and when 64 subband signals are generated using a filterbank<br>
having 64 filterbank channels, the sampling period in a subband<br><br>
signal is 64 times larger than the sampling period of the original input signal.<br>
It is to be noted here that the delays are an integral part of<br>
the filtering process used in the reverberation device. The<br>
output signal constitutes of a multitude of delayed versions of<br>
the input signal. It is preferred to delay signals by fractions<br>
of the subband sampling period, in order to achieve a good re-<br>
verberation device in the subband domain.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the delay,<br>
and preferably the fractional delay introduced by each rever-<br>
beration filter in each subband is equal for all subbands. Nev-<br>
ertheless, the filter coefficients are different for each sub-<br>
bands. It is preferred to use IIR filters. Depending on the ac-<br>
tual situation, fractional delay and the filter coefficients<br>
for the different filters can be determined empirically using<br>
listening tests.<br>
The subbands filtered by the set of reverberation filters con-<br>
stitute a decorrelation signal which is to be mixed with the<br>
original input signal, i.e., the mono signal to obtain a de-<br>
coded left channel and decoded right channel. This mixing of a<br>
decorrelation signal with the original signal is performed<br>
based on an inter-channel coherence parameter transmitted to-<br>
gether with the parametrically encoded signal. To obtain dif-<br>
ferent left and right channels, i.e., different first and sec-<br>
ond channels, mixing of the decorrelation signal with a mono<br>
signal to obtain the first output channel is different from<br>
mixing the decorrelation signal with the mono signal to obtain<br>
the second output channel..<br>
To obtain higher efficiency on the encoding side, multi-channel<br>
encoding is performed using an adaptive determination of the<br><br>
stereo parameter set. To this end, an encoder includes, in ad-<br>
dition to a means for calculating the mono signal and in addi-<br>
tion to a means for generating a stereo parameter set, a means<br>
for determining a validity of stereo parameter sets for subse-<br>
quent portions of the left an right channels. Preferably, the<br>
means for determining is operative to activate the means for<br>
generating, when it is determined that the stereo parameter set<br>
is not valid anymore so that a second stereo parameter set is<br>
calculated for portions of the left and right channels starting<br>
at a second time border. This second time border is also deter-<br>
mined by the means for determining a validity.<br>
The encoded output signal then includes the mono signal, a<br>
first stereo parameter set and a first time border associated<br>
with the first parameter set and the second stereo parameter<br>
set and the second time border associated with the second ste-<br>
reo parameter set. On the decoding side, the decoder will use a<br>
valid stereo parameter set until a new time border is reached.<br>
When this new time border is reached, the decoding operations<br>
are performed using the new stereo parameter set.<br>
Compared to prior art methods, which did a block wise process-<br>
ing and, therefore, a block wise determination of stereo pa-<br>
rameter sets, the inventive adaptive determination of stereo<br>
parameter sets for different encoder-side determined time bor-<br>
ders provides a high coding efficiency on the one hand end and<br>
a high coding quality on the other hand. This is due to the<br>
fact that for relatively stationary signals, the same stereo<br>
parameter set can be used for many blocks of the samples of the<br>
mono signal without introducing audible errors. On the other<br>
hand, when non-stationary signals are concerned, the inventive<br>
adaptive stereo parameter determination provides an improved<br>
time resolution so that each signal portion has its optimum<br>
stereo parameter set.<br><br>
 The present invention provides a solution to the prior art<br>
problems by using a reverberation unit as a de-correlator im-<br>
plemented with fractional delay lines in a filterbank, and us-<br>
ing adaptive level adjustment of the de-correlated reverberated<br>
signal.<br>
Subsequently, several aspects of the present invention are out-<br>
lined.<br>
One aspect of the invention is a method for delaying a signal<br>
by: filtering a real-valued time domain signal through the<br>
analysis part of complex filterbank; modifying the complex-<br>
valued subband signals obtained from the filtering; and fil-<br>
tering the modified complex-valued subband signals through the<br>
synthesis part of the filterbank; and taking the real part of<br>
the complex-valued time domain output signal, where the output<br>
signal is the sum of the signals obtained from the synthesis filtering.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a method for modifying the<br>
complex valued subband signals by filtering each complex-valued<br>
subband signal with a complex valued finite impulse response<br>
filter where the finite impulse response filter for subband<br>
number n is given by a discrete time Fourier transform of the<br>
form  where the parame-<br>
ter T=T/L, and where the synthesis filter bank has L subbands<br>
and the desired delay is T measured in output signal sample<br>
units.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a method for modifying the<br>
complex valued subband signals by filtering where the filter<br>
Gr(ω) approximately satisfies  where<br><br>
  is the discrete time Fourier transform of the sequence<br>
  and p(l)is the prototype filter of said<br>
complex filterbank and A is an appropriate real normalization<br>
factor.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a method for modifying the<br>
complex valued subband signals by filtering where the filter<br>
  satisfies   such that even indexed impulse<br>
response samples are real valued and odd indexed impulse re-<br>
sponse samples are purely imaginary valued.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a method for coding of ste-<br>
reo properties of an input signal, by at an encoder, calculate<br>
time grid parameters describing the location in time for each<br>
stereo parameter set, where the number of stereo parameter sets<br>
are arbitrary, and at a decoder, applying parametric stereo<br>
synthesis according to that time grid.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a method for coding of ste-<br>
reo properties of an input signal, where the time localisation<br>
for the first stereo parameter set is, in the case of where a<br>
time cue for the stereo parameter set coincides with the begin-<br>
ning of a frame, signalled explicitly instead of signalling the<br>
time pointer.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a method for generation of<br>
stereo decorrelation for parametric stereo reconstruction, by<br>
at a decoder, applying an artificial reverberation process to<br>
synthesise the side signal.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a method for generation of<br>
stereo decorrelation for parametric stereo reconstruction by,<br>
at the decoder, the reverberation process is made within a com-<br><br>
plex modulated filterbank using phase delay adjustment in each filter bank channel.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a method for generation of<br>
stereo decorrelation for parametric stereo reconstruction by,<br>
at the decoder, the reverberation process utilises a detector<br>
designed for finding signals where the reverberation tail could<br>
be unwanted and let the reverberation tail be attenuated or re-<br>
moved.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The below-described embodiments are merely illustrative for<br>
the principles of the present invention for parametric stereo<br>
coding. It is understood that modifications and variations of<br>
the arrangements and the details described herein will be ap-<br>
parent to others skilled in the art. It is the intent, there-<br>
fore, to be limited only by the scope of the impending patent<br>
claims and not by the specific details presented by way of de-<br>
scription and explanation of the embodiments herein.<br>
Delaying a signal by a fraction of a sample can be achieved by<br>
several prior art interpolation methods. However, special cases<br>
arises when the original signal is available as oversampled<br>
complex valued samples. Performing fractional delay in the qmf<br>
bank by only applying phase delay by a factor for, each qmf<br>
channel corresponding to a constant time delay, results in se-<br>
vere artefacts.<br>
This can efficiently be avoided by using a compensation filter<br>
according to a novel approach allowing high quality approxima-<br>
tions to arbitrary delays in any complex-exponential-modulated<br>
filterbank. A detailed description follows below.<br>
A continuous time model<br><br>
For ease of computations a complex exponential modulated L-<br>
band filterbank will be modelled here by a continuous time win-<br>
dowed transform using the synthesis waveforms<br><br>
where n,kare integers with &gt; 0 and θ is a fixed phase term. Re-<br>
sults for discrete-time signals are obtain by suitable sampling<br>
of the t-variable with spacing 1/L . It is assumed that the real<br>
valued window v(t) is chosen such that for real valued signals<br>
x(t) it holds to very high precision that<br><br>

where * denotes complex conjugation. It is also assumed that<br>
v(t)is essentially band limited to the frequency interval<br>
  Consider the modification of each frequency band n by<br>
filtering the discrete time analysis samples cn(k) with a filter<br>
with impulse response <br><br>
Then the modified synthesis<br><br>
can be computed in the frequency domain to be<br><br>

where  denotes Fourier transforms of f(t) and<br><br><br>
Here,  is the discrete time Fourier trans-<br>
form of the filter applied in frequency band n for n &gt; 0 and<br><br>
Observe here that the special case Hn (ω) =1 leads to H(ω)=1 in<br>
(7) due to the special design of the window v(t) . Another case<br>
of interest is  which gives  , so that<br><br>
The proposed solution<br>
In order to achieve a delay of size r, such that y(t) = x(t-r),<br>
the problem is to design filters Hn(ω) for n &gt; 0 such that<br><br>
(9)<br>
where H(ω) is given by (7) and (8) . The particular solution<br>
proposed here is to apply the filters<br><br>

Here  implies consistency with (8) for all n.<br>
Insertion of (10) into the right hand side of (7) yields<br><br>
(11)<br>
where   with  . Elementary<br>
computations show that   is the discrete time Fourier<br>
transform of<br><br>
Very good approximations to the perfect delay can be obtained<br>
by solving the linear system<br><br><br>
in the least squares sense with a FIR filter<br>
  In terms of filter coefficients, the<br>
equation (13) can be written<br><br>
where   for K = 0and for k=0.<br>
In the case of a discrete time L-band filter bank with proto-<br>
type filter p(k), the obtained delay in sample units is Lr and<br>
the computation (12) is replaced by<br><br>
where T is the integer closest to Lr . Here p(k) is extended by<br>
zeros outside its support. For a finite length prototype fil-<br>
ter, only finitely many vr(k) are different from zero, and (14)<br>
is system of linear equations. The number of unknowns gr{k) is<br>
typically chosen to be a small number. For good QMF filter bank<br>
designs, 3-4 taps already give very good delay performance.<br>
Moreover, the dependence of the filter taps  on the delay<br>
parameter r can often be modelled successfully by low order<br>
polynomials.<br>
Signalling adaptive time grid for stereo parameters<br>
Parametric stereo systems always leads to compromises in terms<br>
of limited time or frequency resolution in order to minimise<br>
conveyed data. It is however well known from psycho-acoustics<br>
that some spatial cues can be more important than others, which<br>
leads to the possibility to discard the less important cues.<br>
Hence, the time resolution does not have to be constant. Great<br>
gain in bitrate could be achieved by letting the time grid syn-<br><br>
chronise with the spatial cues. It can easily be done by send-<br>
ing. a variable number of parameter sets for each data frame<br>
that corresponds to a time segment of fixed size. In order to<br>
synchronise the parameter sets with corresponding spatial cues,<br>
additional time grid data describing the location in time for<br>
each parameter set has to be sent. The resolution of those time<br>
pointers could be chosen to be quite low to keep the total<br>
amount of data minimised. A special case where a time cue for a<br>
parameter set coincides with the beginning of a frame could be<br>
signalled explicitly to avoid sending that time pointer.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates an inventive apparatus for performing pa-<br>
rameter analysis for time segments having variable and signal<br>
dependant time borders. The inventive apparatus includes means<br>
401 for dividing the input signal into one or several time seg-<br>
ments. The time borders that separate the time segments are<br>
provided by means 402. Means 402 uses a detector specially de-<br>
signed for extracting spatial cues that is relevant for decid-<br>
ing where to set the time borders. Means 401 outputs all the<br>
input signal divided into one or several time segments. This<br>
output is input to means 403 for separate parameter analysis<br>
for each time segment. Means 403 outputs one parameter set per<br>
time segment' being analysed.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates an example of how the time grid generator<br>
can perform for a hypothetical input signal. In this example<br>
one parameter set per data frame is used if no other time bor-<br>
der information is present. Hence, when no other time border<br>
information is present, the inherent time borders of the data<br>
frame is used. The in Fig. 5 depicted time borders are the out-<br>
put from means 402 in Fig. 4. The in Fig. 5 depicted time seg-<br>
ments are provided by means 401 in Fig. 4.<br><br>
The apparatus for encoding a stereo signal to obtain a mono<br>
output signal and the stereo parameter set includes the means<br>
for calculating the mono signal by combining a left and a right<br>
channel of the stereo signals by weighted addition. Addition-<br>
ally, a means 403 are generating a first stereo parameter set<br>
using a portion of the left channel and a portion of the right<br>
channel, the portions starting at a first time border is con-<br>
nected to the means for determining the validity of the first<br>
stereo parameter set for subsequent portions of the left chan-<br>
nel and the right channel.<br>
The means for determining is collectively formed by the means 402 and 401 in Fig. 1.<br>
Particularly, the means for determining is operative to gener-<br>
ate a second time border and to activate the means for generat-<br>
ing, when it is determined that this first stereo parameter set<br>
is not valid anymore so that a second stereo parameter set for<br>
portions of the left and right channels starting at the second<br>
time border is generated.<br>
Not shown in Fig. 4 are means for outputting the mono signal,<br>
the first stereo parameter set and the first time border asso-<br>
ciated with the first stereo parameter set and the second ste-<br>
reo parameter set and the second time border associated with<br>
the second stereo parameter set as the parametrically encoded<br>
stereo signal. The means for determining a validity of a stereo<br>
parameter set can include a transient detector, since the prob-<br>
ability is high that, after a transient, a new stereo parameter<br>
has to be generated, since a signal has changed its shape sig-<br>
nificantly. Alternatively, the means for determining a validity<br>
can include an analysis-by-synthesis device, which is adapted<br>
for decoding the mono signal and the stereo parameter set to<br>
obtain a decoded left and a decoded right channel, to compare<br><br>
the decoded left channel and the decoded right channel to the left channel and to the right channel, and to activate the<br>
means for generating, when the decoded left channel and the de-<br>
coded right channel are different from the left channel and the<br>
right channel by more than the predetermined threshold.<br>
Data frame 1: The time segment corresponding to parameter set 1<br>
starts at the beginning of data frame 1 since no other time<br>
border information is present in this data frame.<br>
Data frame 2: Two time borders are present in this data frame.<br>
The time segment corresponding to parameter set 2 starts at the<br>
first time border in this data frame. The time segment corre-<br>
sponding to parameter set 3 starts at the second time border in<br>
this data frame.<br>
Data frame 3: One time border is present in this data frame.<br>
The time segment corresponding to parameter set 4 starts at the<br>
time border in this data frame.<br>
Data frame 4: One time border is present in this data frame.<br>
Thi.s time border coincides with the start border of the data<br>
frame 4 and does not have to be signalled since this is handled<br>
by the default case. Hence, this time border signal can be re-<br>
moved. The time segment corresponding to parameter set 5 starts<br>
at the beginning of data frame 4, even without signalling this<br>
time border.<br>
Using artificial reverberation as decorrelation method for pa-<br>
rametric stereo reconstruction<br>
One vital part of making the stereo synthesis in a parametric<br>
stereo system is to decrease the coherence between the left and<br><br>
right channel in order to create wideness of the stereo image.<br>
It can be done by adding a filtered version of the original<br>
mono signal to the side signal, where the side and mono signal<br>
is defined by:<br>
mono = (left + right) / 2, and<br>
side = (left - right) / 2, respectively.<br>
In order to not change the timbre too much, the filter in ques-<br>
tion should preferably be of all-pass character. One successful<br>
approach is to use similar all-pass filters used for artificial<br>
reverberation processes. Artificial reverberation algorithms<br>
usually requires high time resolution to give an impulse re-<br>
sponse that is satisfactory diffuse in time. There are great<br>
advantages in basing an artificial reverberation algorithm on a<br>
complex filter bank such as the complex qmf bank. The filter-<br>
bank provides excellent possibilities to let the reverberation<br>
properties be frequency selective in terms of for example re-<br>
verberation equalisation, decay time, density and timbre. How-<br>
ever, the filter bank implementations usually exchanges time<br>
resolution for higher frequency resolution which normally makes<br>
it hard to implement a reverberation process that is smooth<br>
enough in time. To deal with this problem a novel method would<br>
be to use a fractional delay approximation by only applying<br>
phase delay by a factor for, each qmf channel corresponding to<br>
a constant time delay. This primitive fractional delay method<br>
introduces severe time smearing that fortunately is very much<br>
desired in this case. The time smearing contributes to the time<br>
diffusion which is highly desirable for reverberation algo-<br>
rithms and gets bigger as the phase delay approaches pi/2 or -<br>
pi/2.<br>
Artificial reverberation processes are for natural reasons<br>
processes with an infinite impulse response, and offers natural<br>
exponential decays. In [PCT/SE02/01372] it is pointed out that<br><br>
if a reverberation unit is used for generating a stereo signal, the reverberation decay might sometimes be unwanted after the<br>
very end of a sound. These unwanted reverb-tails can however<br>
easily be attenuated or completely removed by just altering the<br>
gain of the reverb signal. A detector designed for finding<br>
sound endings can be used for that purpose. If the reverbera-<br>
tion unit generates artefacts at some specific signals e.g.,<br>
transients, a detector for those signals can also be used for<br>
attenuating the same.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates an inventive apparatus for the de-<br>
correlation method of signals as used in a parametric stereo<br>
system. The inventive apparatus includes means 101 for provid-<br>
ing a plurality of subband signals. The providing means can be<br>
a complex QMF filterbank, where every signal is associated with<br>
a subband index.<br>
The subband signals output by the means 101 from Fig 1. are in-<br>
put into a means 102 for providing a de-correlated signal 102,<br>
and into a means 103 and 106 for modifying the subband signal.<br>
The output from 102 is input into a means 104 and 105 for modi-<br>
fying the of the signal, and the output of 103, 104, 105 and<br>
106 are input into a means for adding, 107 and 108, the subband<br>
signals.<br>
In the presently described embodiment of the invention, the<br>
means for modifying 103,104, 105 and 106, the subband signals,<br>
adjusts the level of the de-correlated signal and the un-<br>
processed signal being the output of 101, by multiplying the<br>
subband signal with a gain factor, so that every sum of every<br>
pair results in a signal with the amount of de-correlated sig-<br>
nal given by the control parameters. It should be noted that<br>
the gain factors used in the means for modifying, 103 - 106,<br><br>
are not limited to a positive value. It can also be a negative<br>
value.<br>
The output from the means for adding subband signals 107 and<br>
108, is input to the means for providing a time-domain signal<br>
109	and 110. The output from 109 corresponds to the left chan-<br>
nel of the re-constructed stereo signal, and the output from<br>
110	corresponds to the right channel of the re-constructed ste-<br>
reo signal. In the here described embodiment the same de-<br>
correlator is used for both output channels, while the means<br>
for adding the de-correlated signal with the un-processed sig-<br>
nal are separate for the two output channels. The presently de-<br>
scribed embodiment thereby ensures that the two output signals<br>
can be identical as well as completely de-correlated, dependent<br>
on the control data provided to the means for adjusting the<br>
levels of the signals, and the control data provided to the<br>
means for adding the signals.<br>
In Fig. 2 a block diagram of the means for providing a de-<br>
correlated signal is displayed. The input subband signal is in-<br>
put to the means for filtering a subband signal 201. In the<br>
presently described embodiment of the present invention the<br>
filtering step is a reverberation unit incorporating all-pass<br>
filtering. The filter coefficients used are given by the means<br>
for providing filter coefficients 202. The subband index of the<br>
currently processed subband signal is input to 202. In one em-<br>
bodiment of the present invention different filter coefficients<br>
are calculated based on the subband index provided to 202. The<br>
filtering step in 201, relies on delayed samples of the input<br>
subband signal as well as delayed samples of intermediate sig-<br>
nals in the filtering procedure.<br>
It is an essential feature of the present invention that means<br>
for providing integer subband sample delay and fractional sub-<br><br>
band sample delay are provided by 203. The output of 201 is in-<br>
put to a means for adjusting the level of the subband signal<br>
204, and also to a means for estimating signal characteristics<br>
of the subband signal 205. In a preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention the characteristics estimated is the tran-<br>
sient behaviour of the subband signal. In this embodiment a de-<br>
tected transient is signalled to the means for adjusting the<br>
level of a subband signal 204, so that the level of the signal<br>
is reduced during transient passages. The output from 204 is<br>
the de-correlated signal input to 104 and 105 of Fig. 1.<br>
In Fig. 3 the single analysis filterbank and the two synthesis<br>
filterbanks are shown. The analysis filterbank 301,. operates on<br>
the mono input signal, while the synthesis filterbanks 302 and<br>
303 operate on the re-constructed stereo signals.<br>
Fig. 1, therefore, shows the inventive apparatus for generating<br>
a decorrelation signal which is indicated by reference 102. As<br>
it is shown in Fig. 1 or 3, this apparatus includes means for<br>
providing a plurality of subband signals, wherein a subband<br>
signal includes the sequence of at least two subband samples,<br>
the sequence of the subband samples representing a bandwidth of<br>
the subband signal which is smaller than a bandwidth of the in-<br>
put signal. Each subband signal is input into the means 201 for<br>
filtering. Each means 201 for filtering includes a reverbera-<br>
tion filter so that a plurality of reverberated subband signals<br>
are obtained, wherein the plurality of reverberated subband<br>
signals together represent the decorrelation signal. Prefera-<br>
bly, as it is shown in Fig. 2, there can be a subband-wise<br>
postprocessing of reverberated subband signals which is per-<br>
formed by block 204, which is controlled by block 205.<br>
Each reverberation filter is set to a certain delay, and pref-<br>
erably a fractional delay, and each reverberation filter has<br><br>
several filter coefficients, which, as it is shown in Fig. 2,<br>
"depend on the subband index. This means that it is preferred to<br>
use the same delay for each subband but to use different sets<br>
of filter coefficients for the different subbands. This is sym-<br>
bolized by means 203 and 202 in Fig. 2, although it is to be<br>
mentioned here that delays and filter coefficients are prefera-<br>
bly fixedly determined when shipping a decorrelation device,<br>
wherein the delays and filter coefficients may be determined<br>
empirically using listening tests etc.<br>
A multi-channel decoder is shown by Fig. 1 and includes the in-<br>
ventive apparatus for generating the correlation signal, which<br>
is termed 102 in Fig. 1. The multi-channel decoder shown in<br>
Fig. 1 is for decoding a mono signal and an associated inter-<br>
channel coherence measure, the inter-channel coherence measure<br>
representing a coherence between a plurality of original chan-<br>
nels, wherein the mono signal is derived from the plurality of<br>
original channels. Block 102 in Fig. 1 constitutes a generator<br>
for generating a decorrelation signal for the mono signal.<br>
Blocks 103, 104, 105, 106 and 107 and 108 constitute a mixer<br>
for mixing the mono signal and the decorrelation signal in<br>
accordance with the first mixing mode to obtain a first decoded<br>
output signal and in accordance with the second mixing mode to<br>
obtain a second decoded output signal, wherein the mixer is op-<br>
erative to determine the first mixing mode and the second mix-<br>
ing mode based on the inter-channel coherence measure transmit-<br>
ted as a side information to the mono signal.<br>
The mixer is preferably operative to mix in a subband domain<br>
based on separate inter-channel coherence measures for differ-<br>
ent subbands. In this case, the multi-channel decoder further<br>
comprises means 109 and 110 for converting the first and second<br>
decoded output signals from the subband domain in a time domain<br>
to obtain a first decoded output signal and. a second decoded<br><br>
output signal in the time domain. Therefore, the inventive means 102 for generating a decorrelation signal and the inven-<br>
tive multi-channel decoder as shown in Fig. 1 operate in the<br>
subband domain and perform, as the very last step, a subband<br>
domain to time domain conversion.<br>
Depending on the actual situation, the inventive device can be<br>
implemented in hardware or in software or in a firmware includ-<br>
ing hardware constituents and software constituents. When im-<br>
plemented in software partially or fully, the invention also is<br>
a computer program having a computer-readable code for carrying<br>
out the inventive methods when running on a computer.<br><br>
