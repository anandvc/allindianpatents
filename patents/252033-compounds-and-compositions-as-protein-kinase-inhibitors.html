CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional<br>
Patent Application Number 60/578,491, filed 10 June 2004. The full disclosure of this application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]	The invention provides a novel class of compounds, pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising such compounds and methods of using such compounds to treat or prevent diseases or disorders associated with abnormal or deregulated kinase activity, particularly diseases or disorders that involve abnormal activation of the Abl, BCR-Abl, PDGF-R, trkB, c-SRC, BMX, FGFR3, b-RAF, SGK, Tie2, Lck, JNK2cc2, MKK4, c-RAF, MKK6, SAPK2oc and SAPK2p kinases.<br>
Background<br>
[0003]	The protein kinases represent a large family of proteins, which play a<br>
central role in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular processes and maintaining control over cellular function.

Aberrant kinase activity has been observed in many disease states<br><br>
including benign and malignant proliferative disorders as well as diseases resulting from<br>
inappropriate activation of the immune and nervous systems.<br>

[0023]	Further preferred compounds of the invention are detailed in the Examples<br>
and Table I, infra.<br><br>
Pharmacology and Utility<br>
[0024]	Compounds of the invention modulate the activity of kinases and, as such,<br>
are useful for treating diseases or disorders in which kinases, contribute to the pathology and/or symptomology of the disease. Examples of kinases that are inhibited by the compounds and compositions described herein and against which the methods described herein are useful include, but are not limited to, Abl, BCR-Abl (wild-type and mutant forms), PDGF-R, trkB, c-SRC, BMX, FGFR3, b-RAF, SGK, Tie2, Lck, JNK2o2, MKK4, c-RAF, MKK6, SAPK2a and SAPK2p[0025]	Abelson tyrosine kinase (i.e. Abl, c-Abl) is involved in the regulation of<br>
the cell cycle, in the cellular response to genotoxic stress, and in the transmission of<br>
information about the cellular environment through integrin signaling. Overall, it appears<br>
that the Abl protein serves a complex role as a cellular module that integrates signals from<br>
various extracellular and intracellular sources and that influences decisions in regard to cell<br>
cycle and apoptosis. Abelson tyrosine kinase includes sub-types derivatives such as the<br>
chimeric fusion (oncoprotein) BCR-Abl with deregulated tyrosine kinase activity or the v-   .<br>
Abl. BCR-Abl is critical in the pathogenesis of 95% of chronic myelogenous leukemia<br>
(CML) and 10% of acute lymphocytic leukemia. STI-571 (Gleevec) is an inhibitor of the<br>
oncogenic BCR-Abl tyrosine kinase and is used for the treatment of chronic myeloid<br>
leukemia (CML). However,-some patients in the blast crisis stage of CML are resistant to<br>
STI-571 due to mutations in the BCR-Abl kinase. Over 22 mutations have been reported to<br>
date with the most common being G250E, E255V, T315I, F317L and M351T.<br>
[0026]	Compounds of the present invention inhibit abl kinase, especially v-abl<br>
kinase. The compounds of the present invention also inhibit wild-type BCR-Abl kinase and mutations of BCR-Abl kinase and are thus suitable for the treatment of Bcr-abl-positive cancer and tumor diseases, such as leukemias (especially chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, where especially apoptotic mechanisms of action are found), and also shows effects on the subgroup of leukemic stem cells as well as potential for the purification of these cells in vitro after removal of said cells (for example, bone marrow removal) and reimplantation of the cells once they have been cleared of cancer cells (for example, reimplantation of purified bone marrow cells).<br><br>
[0027]	The Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway mediates cellular response to<br>
growth signals. Ras is mutated to an oncogenic form in ~15% of human cancer. The Raf<br>
family belongs to the serine/threonine protein kinase and it includes three members, A-Raf,<br>
B-Raf and c-Raf (or Raf-1). The focus on Raf being a drug target has centered on the<br>
relationship of Raf as a downstream effector of Ras. However, recent data suggests that B-<br>
Raf may have a prominent role in the formation of certain tumors with no requirement for an<br>
activated Ras allele (Nature 417, 949 - 954 (01 Jul 2002). In particular, B-Raf mutations<br>
have been detected in a large percentage of malignant melanomas.<br>
[0028]	Existing medical treatments for melanoma are limited hi their<br>
effectiveness, especially for late stage melanomas. The compounds of the present invention<br>
also inhibit cellular processes involving b-Raf kinase, providing a new therapeutic<br>
opportunity for treatment of human cancers, especially for melanoma.<br>
[0029]	The compounds of the present invention also inhibit cellular processes<br>
involving c-Raf kinase. c-Raf is activated by the ras oncogene, which is mutated in a wide<br>
number of human cancers. Therefore inhibition of the kinase activity of c-Raf may provide a<br>
way to prevent ras mediated tumor growth [Campbell, S. L., Oncogene, 17,1395 (1998)].<br>
[0030]	PDGF (Platelet-derived Growth Factor) is a very commonly occurring<br>
growth factor, which plays an important role both in normal growth and also in pathological cell proliferation, such as is seen in carcinogenesis and in diseases of the smooth-muscle cells of blood vessels, for example in atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Compounds of the invention can inhibit PDGF receptor (PDGFR) activity and are, therefore, suitable for the treatment of tumor diseases, such as gliomas, sarcomas, prostate tumors, and tumors of the colon, breast, and ovary.<br>
[0031]	Compounds of the present invention, can be used not only as a tumor-<br>
inhibiting substance, for example in small cell lung cancer, but also as an agent to treat non-malignant proliferative disorders, such as atherosclerosis, thrombosis, psoriasis, scleroderma and fibrosis, as well as for the protection of stem cells, for example to combat the hemotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic agents, such as 5-fluoruracil, and in asthma. Compounds of the invention can especially be used for the treatment of diseases, which respond to an inhibition of the PDGF receptor kinase.<br><br>
[0032]	Compounds of the present invention show useful effects in the treatment of<br>
disorders arising as a result of transplantation, for example, allogenic transplantation,<br>
especially tissue rejection, such as especially obliterative bronchiolitis (OB), i.e. a chronic<br>
rejection of allogenic lung transplants. In contrast to patients without OB, those with OB<br>
often show an elevated PDGF concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids.<br>
[0033J	Compounds of the present invention are also effective in diseases<br>
associated with vascular smooth-muscle cell migration and proliferation (where PDGF and PDGF-R often also play a role), such as restenosis and atherosclerosis. These effects and the consequences thereof for the proliferation or migration of vascular smooth-muscle cells in vitro and in vivo can be demonstrated by administration of the compounds of the present invention, and also by investigating its effect on the thickening of the vascular ultima following mechanical injury in vivo.<br>
[0034]	The trk family of neurotrophin receptors (trkA, trkB, trkC) promotes the<br>
survival, growth and differentiation of the neuronal and non-neuronal tissues. The TrkB protein'is expressed fa neuroendocrine-type cells hi the small intestine and colon, in the alpha cells of the pancreas, in the monocytes and macrophages of the lymph nodes and of the spleen, and in the granular layers of the epidermis (Shibayama and Koizumi, 1996). Expression of the TrkB protein has been associated with an unfavorable progression of Wilms tumors and of neuroblastomas. TkrB is, moreover, expressed in cancerous prostate cells but not in normal cells. The signaling pathway downstream of the trk receptors<br>
v<br>
involves the cascade of MAPK activation through the She, activated Ras, ERK-1 and ERK-2<br>
genes, and the PLC-gammal transduction pathway (Sugimoto et al., 2001).<br>
[0035]	The kinase, c-Src transmits oncogenic signals of many receptors. For<br>
example, over-expression of EGFR or HER2/neu in tumors leads to the constitutive<br>
activation of c-src, which is characteristic for the malignant cell but absent from the normal<br>
cell. On the other hand, mice deficient in the expression of c-src exhibit an osteopetrotic<br>
phenotype, indicating a key participation of c-src in osteoclast function and a possible<br>
involvement in related disorders.<br>
[0036]	The Tec family kinase, Bmx, a non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase,<br>
controls the proliferation of mammary epithelial cancer cells.<br><br>
[0037]	Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 was shown to exert a negative<br>
regulatory effect on bone growth and an inhibition of chondrocyte proliferation. Thanatophoric dysplasia is caused by different mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3, and one mutation, TDH FGFR3, has a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity which activates the transcription factor Statl, leading to expression of a cell-cycle inhibitor, growth arrest and abnormal bone development (Su et al., Nature, 1997, 386,288-292). PGFR3 is also often expressed in multiple myeloma-type cancers. Inhibitors of FGFR3 activity are useful in the treatment of T-cell mediated inflammatory or autoimmune diseases including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), collagen II arthritis, multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), psoriasis, juvenile onset diabetes, Sjogren's disease, thyroid disease, sarcoidosis, autoimmune uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's and ulcerative colitis), celiac disease and myasthenia gravis.<br>
[0038]	The activity of serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK), is<br>
correlated to perturbed ion-channel activities, in particular, those of sodium and/or potassium<br>
channels and compounds of the invention can be useful for treating hypertension.<br>
[0039]	Lin et al (1997) J. Clin. Invest. 100, 8: 2072-2078 and P. Lin (1998) PNAS<br>
95, 8829-8834, have shown an inhibition of tumor growth and vascularization and also a decrease in lung metastases during adenoviral infections or during injections of the extracellular domain of Tie-2 (Tek) in breast tumor and melanoma xenograft models. Tie2 inhibitors can be used in situations where neovascularization takes place inappropriately (i.e. in diabetic retinopathy, chronic inflammation, psoriasis, Kaposi's sarcpma, chronic neovascularization due to macular degeneration, rheumatoid arthritis, infantile haemangioma and cancers).<br>
[0040]	Lck plays a role in T-cell signaling. Mice that lack the Lck gene have a<br>
poor ability to develop thymocytes. The function of Lck as a positive activator of T-cell signaling suggests that Lck inhibitors may be useful for treating autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
[0041]	JNKs, along with other MAPKs, have been implicated in having a role in<br>
mediating cellular response to cancer, thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, immunodeficiency disorders, autoimmune diseases, cell death, allergies, osteoporosis and heart disease. The therapeutic targets related to activation of the INK pathway include<br><br>
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, osteoarthritis, ischemia, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. As a result of the importance of INK activation associated with liver disease or episodes of hepatic ischemia, compounds of the invention may also be useful to treat various hepatic disorders. A role for JNK in cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure has also been reported as it has been shown JNK mediates hypertrophic responses to various forms of cardiac stress. It has been demonstrated that the JNK cascade also plays a role hi T-cell activation, including activation of the IL-2 promoter. Thus, inhibitors of JNK may have therapeutic value in altering pathologic immune responses. A role for JNK activation in various cancers has also been established, suggesting the potential use of JNK inhibitors in cancer. For example, constitutively activated JNK is associated with HTLV-1 mediated tumorigenesis [Oncogene 13:135-42 (1996)].  JNK may play a role in Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Other proliferative effects of other cytokines implicated in KS proliferation, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), IL-6 and TNFa, may also be mediated by JNK. In addition, regulation of the c-jun gene in p210 BCR-ABL transformed cells corresponds with activity of JNK, suggesting a role for JNK inhibitors in the treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) [Blood 92:2450-60 (1998)].<br>
[0042]	Certain abnormal proliferative conditions are believed to be associated<br>
with raf expression and are, therefore, believed to be responsive to inhibition of raf expression. Abnormally high levels of expression of the raf protein are also implicated in transformation and abnormal cell proliferation. These abnormal proliferative conditions are also believed to be responsive to inhibition of raf expression.  For example, expression of the c-raf protein is believed to play a role in abnormal cell proliferation since it has been reported that 60% of all lung carcinoma cell lines express unusually high levels of c-raf mRNA and protein. Further examples of abnormal proliferative conditions are hyper-proliferative disorders such as cancers, tumors, hyperplasia, pulmonary fibrosis, angiogenesis, psoriasis, atherosclerosis and smooth muscle cell proliferation in the blood vessels, such as stenosis or restenosis following angioplasty. The cellular signaling pathway of which raf is a part has also been implicated in inflammatory disorders characterized by T-cell proliferation (T-cell activation and growth), such as tissue graft rejection, endotoxin shock, and glomerular nephritis, for example.<br><br>
[0043]       -       The stress activated protein kinases (SAPKs) are a family of protein kinases that represent the penultimate step in signal transduction pathways that result in activation of the c-jun transcription factor and expression of genes regulated by c-jun. In particular, c-jun is involved in the transcription of genes that encode proteins involved in the repair of DNA that is damaged due to genotoxic insults. Therefore, agents that inhibit SAPK activity in a cell prevent DNA repair and sensitize the cell to agents that induce DNA damage or inhibit DNA synthesis and induce apoptosis of a cell or that inhibit cell proliferation.<br>
[0044]	Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are members of conserved<br>
signal transduction pathways that activate transcription factors, translation factors and other<br>
target molecules in response to a variety of extracellular signals. MAPKs are activated by<br>
phosphorylation at a dual phosphorylation motif having the sequence Thr-X-Tyr by mitogen-<br>
activated protein kinase kinases (MKKs), to higher eukaryotes, the physiological role of<br>
MAPK signaling has been correlated with cellular events such as proliferation, oncogenesis,<br>
development and differentiation. Accordingly, the ability to regulate signal transduction via<br>
these pathways (particularly via MKK4 and MKK6) could lead to the development of<br>
treatments and preventive therapies for human diseases associated with MAPK signaling,<br>
such as inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases and cancer.<br>
[0045]	The family of human ribosomal S6 protein kinases consists of at least 8<br>
members (RSK1, RSK2, RSK3, RSK4, MSK1, MSK2, p70S6K and p70S6 Kb). Ribosomal protein S6 protein kinases play important pleotropic functions, among them is a key role in the regulation of mRNA translation during protein biosynthesis (Eur. J. Biochem 2000 November; 267(21): 6321-30, Exp Cell Res. Nov. 25, 1999; 253 (l):100-9, Mol Cell Endocrinol. May 25,1999;151(l-2):65-77). The phosphorylation of the S6 ribosomal protein by p70S6 has also been implicated in the regulation of cell motility (Irnmunol. Cell Biol. 2000 August;78(4):447-51) and cell growth (Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol., 2000;65:101-27), and hence, may be important in tumor metastasis, the immune response and tissue repair as well as other disease conditions.<br>
[0046]	The SAPK's (also called "jun N-terminal kinases" or "JNK's") are a family<br>
of protein kinases that represent the penultimate step in signal transduction pathways that result in activation of the c-jun transcription factor and expression of genes regulated by c-<br><br>
jun. In particular, c-jun is involved in the transcription of genes that encode proteins<br>
involved in the repair of DNA that is damaged due to genotoxic insults. Agents that inhibit<br>
SAPK activity in a cell prevent DNA repair and sensitize the cell to those cancer therapeutic<br>
modalities that act by inducing DNA damage.<br>
[0047]	BTK plays a role in autoimmune and/or inflammatory disease such as<br>
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, multiple vasculitides, idiopathic<br>
thrombocytopenic purpura (FTP), myasthenia gravis, and asthma.. Because of BTK's role in<br>
B-cell activation, inhibitors of BTK are useful as inhibitors of B-cell mediated pathogenic<br>
activity, such as autoantibody production, and are useful for the treatment of B-cell<br>
lymphoma and leukemia.<br>
[004S]	CHK2 is a member of the checkpoint kinase family of serine/threonine<br>
protein kinases and is involved in a mechanism used for surveillance of DNA damage, such<br>
as damage caused by environmental mutagens and endogenous reactive oxygen species. As<br>
a result, it is implicated as a tumor suppressor and target for cancer therapy.<br>
[0049]	CSK influences the metastatic potential of cancer cells, particularly colon<br>
cancer.<br>
[0050]	Fes is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that has been implicated in a<br>
variety of cytokine signal transduction pathways, as well as differentiation of myeloid cells.<br>
Fes is also a key component of the granulocyte differentiation machinery.<br>
[0051]	Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase activity is implicated in leukemias and<br>
myelodysplastic syndrome. In approximately 25% of AML the leukemia cells express a<br>
constitutively active form of auto-phosphorylated (p) FLT3 tyrosine kinase on the cell<br>
surface. The activity of p-FLT3 confers growth and survival advantage on the leukemic<br>
cells. Patients with acute leukemia, whose leukemia cells express p-FLT3 kinase activity,<br>
have a poor overall clinical outcome. Inhibition of p-FLT3 kinase activity induces apoptosis<br>
(programmed cell death) of the leukemic cells.<br>
[0052]	Inhibitors of IKKa and IKKp (1 &amp; 2) are therapeutics for diseases which<br>
include rheumatoid arthritis, transplant rejection, inflammatory bowel disease, osteoarthritis,<br>
asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atherosclerosis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis,<br>
stroke, systemic lupus erythematosus, Alzheimer's disease, brain ischemia, traumatic brain<br>
injury, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, subarachnoid hemorrhage or other<br><br>
diseases or disorders associated with excessive production of inflammatory mediators in the brain and central nervous system.<br>
[0053]	Met is associated with most types of the major human cancers and<br>
expression is often correlated with poor prognosis and metastasis. Inhibitors of Met are<br>
therapeutics for diseases which include cancers such as lung cancer, NSCLC (non small cell<br>
lung cancer), bone cancer, pancreatic cancer, skin cancer, cancer of the head and neck,<br>
cutaneous or intraocular melanoma, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, rectal cancer, cancer of<br>
the anal region, stomach cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, gynecologic tumors (e. g.,<br>
uterine sarcomas, carcinoma of the fallopian tubes, carcinoma of the endometrium,<br>
carcinoma of the cervix, carcinoma of the vagina or carcinoma of the vulva), Hodgkin's<br>
Disease, cancer of the esophagus, cancer of the small intestine, cancer of the endocrine<br>
system (e. g., cancer of the thyroid, parathyroid or adrenal glands), sarcomas of soft tissues,<br>
cancer of the urethra, cancer of the penis, prostate cancer, chronic or acute leukemia, solid<br>
tumors of childhood, lymphocytic lymphomas, cancer of the bladder, cancer of the kidney or<br>
ureter (e. g., renal cell carcinoma, carcinoma of the renal pelvis), pediatric malignancy,<br>
neoplasms of the central nervous system (e. g., primary CNS lymphoma, spinal axis tumors,<br>
brain stem glioma or pituitary adenomas), cancers of the blood such as acute myeloid<br>
leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, etc, Barrett's esophagus (pre-malignant syndrome)<br>
neoplastic cutaneous disease, psoriasis, mycoses fungoides and benign prostatic<br>
hypertrophy, diabetes related diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, retinal ischemia and<br>
retinal neovascularization, hepatic cirrhosis, cardiovascular disease such as atherosclerosis,<br>
immunological disease such as autoimmune disease and renal disease. Preferably, the<br>
disease is cancer such as acute myeloid leukemia and colorectal cancer.<br>
[0054]	The Nima-related kinase 2 (Nek2) is a cell cycle-regulated protein kinase<br>
with maximal activity at the onset of mitosis that localizes to the centrosome. Functional<br>
studies have implicated Nek2 in regulation of centrosome separation and spindle formation.<br>
Nek2 protein is elevated 2- to 5-fold in cell lines derived from a range of human tumors<br>
including those of cervical, ovarian, prostate, and particularly breast.<br>
[0055]	p70S6K-mediated diseases or conditions include, but are not limited to,<br>
proliferative disorders, such as cancer and tuberous sclerosis.<br><br>
{0056}	In accordance with the foregoing, the present invention further provides a<br>
method for preventing or treating any of the diseases or disorders described above in a subject in need of such treatment, which method comprises administering to said subject a therapeutically effective amount (See, "Administration and Pharmaceutical Compositions ", infra) of a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. For any of the above uses, the required dosage will vary depending on the mode of administration, the particular condition to be treated and the effect desired.<br>
Administration and Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
[0057]	In general, compounds of the invention will be administered in<br>
therapeutically effective amounts via any of the usual and acceptable modes known in the<br>
art, either singly or in combination with one or more therapeutic agents. A therapeutically<br>
effective amount may vary widely depending on the severity of the disease, the age and<br>
relative health of the subject, the potency of the compound used and other factors. In<br>
general, satisfactory results are indicated to be obtained systemically at daily dosages of<br>
from about 0.03 to 2.5mg/kg per body weight. An indicated daily dosage in the larger<br>
mammal, e.g. humans, is in the range from about 0.5mg to about lOOmg, conveniently<br>
administered, e.g. in divided doses up to four times a day or in retard form. Suitable unit<br>
dosage forms for oral administration comprise from ca. 1 to 50mg active ingredient.<br>
[0058]	Compounds of the invention can be administered as pharmaceutical<br>
compositions by any conventional route, in particular enterally, e.g., orally, e.g., in the form of tablets or capsules, or parenterally, e.g., in the form of injectable solutions or suspensions, topically, e.g., in the form of lotions, gels, ointments or creams, or in a nasal or suppository form. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the present invention in free form or in a pharmaceutically acceptable salt form in association with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent can be manufactured in a conventional manner by mixing, granulating or coating methods. For example, oral compositions can be tablets or gelatin capsules comprising the active ingredient together with a) diluents, e.g., lactose, dextrose, sucrose, rnannitol, sorbitol, cellulose and/or glycine; b) lubricants, e.g., silica, talcum, stearic acid, its magnesium or calcium salt and/or polyethyleneglycol; for tablets<br><br>
also c) binders, e.g., magnesium aluminum silicate, starch paste, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose and or polyvinylpyrrolidone; if desired d) disintegrants, e.g., starches, agar, alginic acid or its sodium salt, or effervescent mixtures; and/or e) absorbents, colorants, flavors and sweeteners. Injectable compositions can be aqueous isotonic solutions or suspensions, and suppositories can be prepared from fatty emulsions or suspensions. The compositions may be sterilized and/or contain adjuvants, such as preserving, stabilizing, wetting or emulsifying agents, solution promoters, salts for regulating the osmotic pressure and/or buffers. In addition, they may also contain other therapeutically valuable substances. Suitable formulations for transdermal applications include an effective amount of a compound of the present invention with a carrier. A carrier can include absorbable pharmacologically acceptable solvents to assist passage through the skin of the host. For example,, transdermal devices are in the form of a bandage comprising a backing member, a reservoir containing the compound optionally with carriers, optionally a rate controlling barrier to deliver the compound to the skin of the host at a controlled and predetermined rate over a prolonged period of time, and means to secure the device to the skin. Matrix transdermal formulations may also be used. Suitable formulations for topical application, e.g., to the skin and eyes, are preferably aqueous solutions, ointments, creams or gels well-known in the art. Such may contain solubilizers, stabilizers, tonicity enhancing agents, buffers and preservatives.<br>
(0059]	Compounds of the invention can be administered in therapeutically<br>
effective amounts in combination with one or more therapeutic agents (pharmaceutical combinations). For example, synergistic effects can occur with other immunomodulatory or anti-inflammatory substances, for example when used in combination with cyclosporin, rapamycin, or ascomycin, or immunosuppressant analogues thereof, for example cyclosporin A (CsA), cyclosporin G, FK-506, rapamycin, or comparable compounds, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, brequinar, leflunomide, mizoribine, mycophenolic acid, mycophenolate mofetil, 15-deoxyspergualin, immunosuppressant antibodies, especially monoclonal antibodies for leukocyte receptors, for example MHC, CD2, CDS, CD4, CD7, CD25, CD28, B7, CD45, CD58 or their ligands, or other immunomodulatory compounds, such as CTLA41g. Where the compounds of the invention are administered in conjunction with other therapies, dosages of the co-administered<br><br>
compounds will of course vary depending on the type of co-drug employed, on the specific drug employed, on the condition being treated and so forth.<br>
[0060]	The invention also provides for a pharmaceutical combinations, e.g. a kit,<br>
comprising a) a first agent which is a compound of the invention as disclosed herein, in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, and b) at least one co-agent. The kit can comprise instructions for its administration.<br>
[0061]	The terms "co-administration" or "combined administration" or the like as<br>
utilized herein are meant to encompass administration of the selected therapeutic agents to a<br>
single patient, and are intended to include treatment regimens in which the agents are not<br>
necessarily administered by the same route of administration or at the same time.<br>
[0062]	The term "pharmaceutical combination" as used herein means a product<br>
that results from the mixing or combining of more than one active ingredient and includes both fixed and non-fixed combinations of the active ingredients. The term "fixed combination" means that the active ingredients, e.g. a compound of Formula I and a co-agent, are both administered to a patient simultaneously in the form of a single entity or dosage. The term "non-fixed combination" means that the active ingredients, e.g. a compound of Formula I and a co-agent, are both administered to a patient as separate entities either simultaneously, concurrently or sequentially with no specific time limits, wherein such administration provides therapeutically effective levels of the 2 compounds in the body of the patient. The latter also applies to cocktail therapy, e.g. the administration of 3 or more active ingredients.<br>
Processes for Making Compounds of the Invention<br>
[0063]	The present invention also includes processes for the preparation of<br>
compounds of the invention. In the reactions described, it can be necessary to protect reactive functional groups, for example hydroxy, amino, imino, thio or carboxy groups, where these are desired in the final product, to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions. Conventional protecting groups can be used hi accordance with standard practice, for example, see T.W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", John Wiley and Sons, 1991.<br><br>
[0064]	Compounds of Formula I can be prepared by proceeding as in the<br>
following Reaction Scheme I:<br>
Reactions Scheme I<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
in which Rj, Rj, RS, RI, n and m are as defined for Formula I in the Summary of the Invention. A compound of Formula I can be prepared by reacting a compound of formula 2 with a compound of formuJa 3 in the presence of a suitable base (e.g., DIPEA, or the like) and a suitable solvent (e.g., butanol, THF, DMF, or the like). The reaction proceeds in a temperature range of about 80 to about 120Â°C and can take up to about 20 hours to complete.<br>
[0065]	A detailed example of the synthesis of a compound of formula I can be<br>
found in the Examples, infra.<br>
Additional Processes for Making Compounds of the Invention<br>
[0066]	A compound of the invention can be prepared as a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable acid addition salt by reacting the free base form of the compound with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acid. Alternatively, a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable base addition salt of a compound of the invention can be prepared by reacting the<br>
free acid form of the compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic<br>
base. Alternatively, the salt forms of the compounds of the invention can be prepared using<br>
salts of the starting materials or intermediates.<br>
[0067]	The free acid or free base forms of the compounds of the invention can be<br>
prepared from the corresponding base addition salt or acid addition salt from, respectively.<br><br>
For example a compound of the invention in an acid addition salt form can be converted to<br>
the corresponding free base by treating with a suitable base (e.g., ammonium hydroxide<br>
solution, sodium hydroxide, and the like). A compound of the invention in a base addition<br>
salt form can be converted to the corresponding free acid by treating with a suitable acid<br>
(e.g., hydrochloric acid, etc.).<br>
[0068]	Compounds of the invention in unoxidized form can be prepared from N-<br>
oxides of compounds of the invention by treating with a reducing agent (e.g., sulfur, sulfur<br>
dioxide, triphenyl phosphine, lithium borohydride, sodium borohydride, phosphorus<br>
trichloride, tribromide, or the like) in a suitable inert organic solvent (e.g. acetonitrile,<br>
ethanol, aqueous dioxane, or the like) at 0 to 80Â°C.<br>
[0069]	Prodrug derivatives of the compounds of the invention can be prepared by<br>
methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art (e.g., for further details see Saulnier et<br>
al., (1994), Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, Vol. 4, p. 1985). For example,<br>
appropriate prodrugs can be prepared by reacting a aon-derivatized compound of the<br>
invention with a suitable carbamyiating agent (e.g., 1,1-acyloxyalkylcarbanochloridate, para-<br>
nitrophenyl carbonate, or the like).<br>
{0070]	Protected derivatives of the compounds of the invention can be made by<br>
means known to those of ordinary skill hi the art. A detailed description of techniques<br>
applicable to the creation of protecting groups and their removal can be found in T. W.<br>
Greene, "Protecting Groups in Organic Chemistry", 3rd edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc.,<br>
1999.<br>
[0071]	Compounds of the present invention can be conveniently prepared, or<br>
formed during the process of the invention, as solvates (e.g., hydrates).  Hydrates of<br>
compounds of the present invention can be conveniently prepared by recrystallization from<br>
an aqueous/organic solvent mixture, using organic solvents such as dioxin, tetrahydrofuran<br>
or methanol.<br>
[0072]	Compounds of the invention can be prepared as their individual<br>
stereoisomers by reacting a racemic mixture of the compound with an optically active<br>
i resolving agent to form a pair of diastereoisomeric compounds, separating the diastereomers<br>
and recovering the optically pure enantiomers. While resolution of enantiomers can be carried out using covalent diastereomeric derivatives of the compounds of the invention,<br><br>
dissociable complexes are preferred (e.g., crystalline diastereomeric salts). Diastereomers have distinct physical properties (e.g., melting points, boiling points, solubilities, reactivity, etc.) and can be readily separated by taking advantage of these dissimilarities.  The diastereomers can be separated by chromatography, or preferably, by separation/resolution techniques based upon differences in solubility. The optically pure enantiomer is then recovered, along with the resolving agent, by any practical means that would not result in racemization. A more detailed description of the techniques applicable to the resolution of stereoisomers of compounds from their racemic mixture can be found in Jean Jacques, Andre Collet, Samuel H. Wilen, "Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions", John Wiley And Sons, Inc., 1981.<br>
[0073]	In summary, the compounds of Formula I can be made by a process, which<br>
involves:<br>
(a)	those of reaction schemes I and II, for example coupling compounds of formula<br>
8 with ReYOH according to reaction scheme I; and<br>
(b)	optionally converting a compound of the invention into a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt;<br>
(c)	optionally converting a salt form of a compound of the invention to a non-salt<br>
form;<br>
(d)	optionally converting an unoxidized form of a compound of the invention into<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable N-oxide;<br>
(e)	optionally converting an N-oxide form of a compound of the invention to its<br>
unoxidized form;<br>
(f)	optionally resolving an individual isomer of a compound of the invention from<br>
a mixture of isomers;<br>
(g)	optionally converting a non-derivatized compound of the invention into a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug derivative; and<br>
(h) optionally converting a prodrug derivative of a compound of the invention to its non-derivatized form.<br>
[0074]	Insofar as the production of the starting materials is not particularly<br>
described, the compounds are known or can be prepared analogously to methods known in the art or as disclosed in the Examples hereinafter.<br><br>
[0075]	One of skill in the art will appreciate that the above transformations are<br>
only representative of methods for preparation of the compounds of the present invention, and that other well known methods can similarly be used.<br>
