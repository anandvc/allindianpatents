[Title of the Invention] STORAGE BOX AND FUEL TANK STRUCTURE ON A MOTORCYCLE<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a storage box and fuel tank structure on a motorcycle.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
[0002]<br>
As a conventional storage box and fuel tank structure on a motorcycle, there is known a structure in which a storage box and a fuel tank positioned in the rear of the storage box are mounted on a vehicle frame (for example, see Patent Document 1) .<br>
[Patent Document 1] JP-A No. 167143/1998<br>
[0003]<br>
The Patent Document 1 discloses, as exactly shown by FIG. 3 of the document, a storage box 14 and a fuel tank 15 positioned in the rear thereof are mounted on a vehicle frame 1 of a motorcycle (reference numerals are used as they are as shown in the Patent Document 1), and an auxiliary machine cover 25, which is integrally provided in the rear part of the storage box 14, covers the fuel tank 15 from above.  "22" indicates a seat being provided in such a manner as to be openable and closable above the storage box 14 and the fuel tank 15.<br>
[0004]<br>
Furthermore, the Patent Document 1 discloses, as exactly shown by FIG. 8, the auxiliary machine cover 25 which covers<br><br>
the fuel tank almost entirely from above, is integrally provided<br>
in the rear part of the storage box 14.  "23" indicates a hinge<br>
provided in front part of the storage box 14 to install the<br>
seat in such manner as to be openable and closable, "32"<br>
indicates a through-hole opened on the front part of the<br>
auxiliary machine cover 25 so as to penetrate a striker (not<br>
illustrated) provided on the rear part of the seat, "27"<br>
indicates a cap hole allowing a cap to protrude outwardly, the<br>
cap being provided so as to close a fill opening of the fuel<br>
tank 15.<br>
[Disclosure  of   the   Invention]<br>
[Problem  to  be   Solved by   the   Invention]<br>
[0005]<br>
Since the auxiliary machine cover 25 is intended for covering the fuel tank 15 almost entirely from above, the area needs to be large, resulting that the storage box 14 and the auxiliary machine cover 25 become bulky and heavy as a whole.<br>
Furthermore, since the through-hole 32 to penetrate the striker and the cap hole 27 to allow the cap to protrude therefrom are opened, a shape of the auxiliary machine cover 25 becomes more complicated. [0006]<br>
In addition, when the fuel tank 15 is provided with a fuel pump of tank built-in type, for example, an installation area of the fuel pump to the fuel tank 15 may protrude outwardly (a part to connect a fuel hose, a connector for energizing the fuel pump, or the like) , and it is also desired that this part is protected.<br><br>
[0007]<br>
A subject of the present invention is to develop a storage box and fuel tank structure of a motorcycle, the storage box being small in size and reduced in weight and more simplified in shape, and to protect the outwardly projecting part of the fuel pump.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem] [0008]<br>
The invention as defined in claim 1 is directed to a storage box and a fuel tank provided on a motorcycle, the storage box being below a seat and the fuel tank being in the rear of the storage box, characterized in that a fuel pump is mounted on a fitting plane provided on an upper surface of the fuel tank, and an appentice portion extending backwardly from the rear part of the storage box covers the fuel pump from above. [0009]<br>
Since the fuel pump is covered from above by the appentice portion extending backwardly from the rear part of the storage box, the fuel pump is not exposed outwardly. Since the appentice portion covers only above the fuel pump, the storage box integrally provided with the appentice portion can be made smaller in size and reduced in weight.  Furthermore, it is not necessary to provide a hole to penetrate the striker or a hole to allow the cap to protrude as disclosed by the conventional art.  In addition, even when an installation area of the fuel pump to the fuel tank 15 protrudes outwardly, this projecting part can be protected by the appentice portion. [0010]<br><br>
The invention as defined in claim 2 is characterized in that the fitting plane of the fuel pump is provided one-stage lower than the upper surface of the fuel pump.<br>
By lowering the fitting plane of the fuel pump one-stage lower than the upper surface of the fuel tank, it is not necessary to form the appentice portion particularly at a high position.  Furthermore, the outwardly projecting part can be made lower than the surroundings thereof. [0011]<br>
The invention as defined in claim 3 is characterized in that the appentice portion is extended up to the front of a fill opening provided on a rear upper surface of the fuel tank.<br>
By extending the appentice portion up to the front of the fill opening provided on the rear upper surface of the fuel tank, it is not necessary to provide a hole and the like to protrude the cap, compared to the conventional art in which the fill opening is covered from above. [0012]<br>
The invention as defined in claim 4 is characterized in that the fuel pump is offset with respect to the vehicle center.<br>
It is possible for the appentice portion to cover only above the fuel pump which is offset with respect to the vehicle center. [0013]<br>
The invention as defined in claim 5 is characterized in that the fuel pump is offset to the air cleaner side.<br>
It is possible for the fuel pump to be positioned closer to an intake system of an engine.  In the case where a side stand<br>
is provided, since the air cleaner is positioned on the side of the side stand, the fuel pump can be positioned on the side to which the vehicle body is inclined. [Effect of the Invention] [0014]<br>
According to the invention as defined in claim 1, since the appentice portion extended backwardly from the rear part of the storage box covers the fuel pump from above, it is sufficient for the appentice portion to cover only above the fuel pump. Therefore, the storage box to which the appentice portion is integrally provided can be made smaller in size and reduced in weight. [0015]<br>
Furthermore, it is not necessary that the appentice portion is provided with a hole to penetrate the striker or a hole to allow the cap to protrude as disclosed by the conventional art.  Therefore, a shape of the appentice portion can be simplified.  In addition, even when the installation area of the fuel pump to the fuel tank projects outwardly, the projecting part can be securely protected by the appentice portion, thereby enhancing the reliability of the motorcycle. [0016]<br>
According to the invention as defined in claim 2, since the fitting plane of the fuel pump is provided one-stage lower than the upper surface of the fuel pump, it is not necessary to form the appentice portion particularly at a high position, and the shape of the appentice portion can be made substantially flat.  Therefore, the shape of the storage box can be simplified<br>
and cost for the storage box can be reduced.  In addition, since the outwardly projecting part of the fuel pump is placed at a lower position, the projecting part can be protected more securely. [0017]<br>
According to the invention as defined in claim 3, the appentice portion is extended up to the front of the fill opening provided on a rear upper surface of the fuel tank. Therefore, it is not necessary to provide a hole and the like to protrude the cap, compared to the conventional art in which the fill opening is covered from above, whereby a shape of the storage box can be simplified, and cost for that can be reduced. [0018]<br>
According to the invention as defined in claim 4, since the fuel pump is offset with respect to the vehicle center, it is sufficient for the appentice portion to cover only the fuel pump from above, which has been offset with respect to the vehicle center, whereby the appentice portion can be made smaller. [0019]<br>
According to the invention as defined in claim 5, since the fuel pump is offset to the side of the air cleaner, the fuel pump can be positioned closer to the intake system of the engine and a fuel line can be shortened. In addition, the air cleaner side is on the side of the side stand and thus the vehicle body is inclined thereto. Therefore, even when the fuel in the fuel tank is low in amount, the fuel can be supplied to the intake system favorably.<br>
 [Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention] [0020]<br>

[0027]<br>
The fuel hose 83 extends almost forwardly from the delivery opening 82, then extending substantially in the lower direction along the rear surface 85 of the storage box 13, and further it passes below the bottom surface 86 of the storage box 13, so as to be connected to the suction opening 87 of the intake manifold 48. [0028]<br>
FIG. 3 is a perspective view showing a fuel tank structure relating to the present invention.  The fuel tank 14 forms a pump fitting plane 77 by depressing the upper surface 76, specifically, a portion left sided of the inclined plane 91 provided in the front part of the upper surface 76, in substantially semicircle shape, and the upper end of the fuel pump 72 is installed almost in the central part of the pump fitting plane 77. [0029]<br>
The upper surface 76 is provided with a substantially horizontal flat plane 92 having the fill opening 74, an inclined plane 91 being gradually lower as it goes forward from the flat plane 92, and the pump fitting plane 77.  It is to be noted that<br>
"76a"   indicates  a  side  wall.<br>
[0030]<br>
As thus described, the pump fitting plane 77 is formed by depressing the upper surface 76, whereby positions of the delivery opening 82, the fuel hose 83, and connector 88<br>
(connected to a motor, not illustrated, within the fuel pump 72, and functioning to energize the motor from outside) and the like, which are projecting from the upper end of the fuel pump 72, are placed lower than the surroundings, that is, the inclined plane 91 and the flat plane 92. Accordingly, in addition to a protection by the aforementioned appentice portion 71 (see FIG. 2), effects in protecting the delivery opening 82, fuel hose 83 (see FIG. 2), connector 88 and the like can be enhanced.<br>
[0031]<br>
Here, "93" indicates a seat support bar which supports the seat 16 (see FIG. 1) by being fitted on the brackets 12g, 12h (only numeral 12g on the near side is shown. See also FIG. 2) provided on both sides of the rear frame 12, respectively via bolts 12j, "94", "95" (only numeral 94 on the near side is shown) indicate grab rail support parts mounted in the vicinity of the installation area of the seat support bar 93 to the rear frame 12, so as to install a grab rail 96 (see FIG. 1) which is grabbed by a passenger, "94a", "95a" (only numeral 94a on the near side is shown) are grab rail fitting holes opened on the grab rail support parts 94, 95, "97" indicates a cross pipe passed over the both sides in the rear part of the rear frame 12, and "98" indicates a lock plate constituting a lock<br>
unit to lock opening or closing of the seat 16. [0032]<br>
FIG. 4 is a plan view showing an installed status of the storage box and fuel tank relating to the present invention. The appentice portion 71 is a portion obtained by extending backwardly a width of storage portion 73 of the storage box 13 (here, for ease of recognizing the shape, it is denoted by a heavy line) so that it almost agrees with the width of the fuel tank 14, and further the rear end 101 of the appentice portion 71 is located in front of the filler cap 79 of the fuel tank 14. In addition, the rear end 101 is also located in front of the seat support bar 93. Therefore, the fuel tank 14 in the rear of the seat support bar 93 can be expanded, for example upwardly, whereby it is possible to increase a capacity of the fuel tank 14. It is to be noted here that "12m", "12n" denote brackets, which are provided on the rear frame 12 to install the lower part of the storage portion 73 on the rear frame 12, "12p", "12p" are fitting bolts for fitting the storage box 13 onto the rear frame 12, and "12q", "12q" are fitting bolts for fitting the rear part of the storage portion 73 onto the rear frame 12. [0033]<br>
The fuel hose 83 extends to the left side of the vehicle from the delivery opening 82 of the fuel pump 72, passes between the fuel tank 14 and the storage box 13, and subsequently, passes below the throttle body 46 under the storage portion 73 . Then, the fuel hose 83 further extends almost forward, then goes in the right direction, further goes forward, subsequently makes<br>
U-turn and extends backwardly, so as to be connected to the suction opening 87 of the intake manifold 48 (see FIG. 2) . In addition, since the fuel hose 83 passes below the throttle body 46, there is no possibility of interference with the storage box 13. [0034]<br>
FIG. 5 is a cross sectional view taken along line 5-5 of FIG. 4, showing that bent sections 106, 107 are formed by bending downwardly the both ends of the appentice portion 71 respectively, and the fuel pump 72 is positioned so that the<br>
center line 72a is offset by the offset amount 6, towards left side of the vehicle (represented by arrow "LEFT" in the figure) with respect to the center line 108 drawn vertically in the center of both sides of the fuel tank 14. It is also shown that the left part Ilia and the right part 111b of the bottom surface 111 of the fuel tank 14 are made lower than the central part 111c, and the fuel pump 72 is positioned above the left part Ilia. It is to be noted that "113" denotes a sealing member that seals between the opening 114 provided on the pump fitting plane 77 of the fuel tank 14 and the fuel pump 72 inserted into the opening 114. [0035]<br>
Operations of the storage box and fuel tank structure of the motorcycle according the above descriptions will be explained.<br>
In FIG. 2, in the condition that the seat 16 is closed, the seat 16 covers the storage box 13 and the fuel tank 14 entirely.  In this situation, the seat support bar 93 mounted<br>
on the rear frame 12 supports the bottom plate 116 provided under the seat 16, whereby the seat support bar 93 is capable of receiving a load applied onto the seat 16. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the storage box 13 including appentice portion 71 and the fuel tank 14 from being subjected to a large load.<br>
[0036]<br>
When the seat 16 is opened from the status as shown in FIG. 2, by turning the seat counterclockwise about the seat support part 13a provided on the front end of the storage box 13, it is possible to load/unload a stored item on/from the storage portion 73 of the storage box 13, and to refuel the fuel tank 14 by opening the filler cap 79 . At this timing, since the appentice portion 71 covers the fuel pump 72 from above, there is no interference with the upper part of the fuel pump 72 and the fuel hose 83 at the time of loading/unloading of the stored item or at the time of refueling.<br>
[0037]<br>
In addition, the fuel pump 72 is mounted on the pump fitting plane 77 provided on the concave portion of the fuel tank 14.  Therefore, even when the appentice portion 71 is distorted downwardly due to a downward pressing force, the appentice portion 71 abuts against the inclined plane 91 and the flat plane 92, and the appentice portion 71 will not interfere with the projecting portion (delivery opening 82, fuel hose 83, connector 88 and the like), thereby protecting the fuel pump 72 more securely.<br>
[0038]<br>
As explained with reference to FIG. 1 to FIG. 3, the present invention is firstly characterized in that in a motorcycle 10 with the storage box 13 provided below the seat 16 and the fuel tank 14 in the rear of the storage box 13, the fuel pump 72 is mounted on the pump fitting plane 77 as a fitting plane provided on the upper surface 76 of the fuel tank 14, and the appentice portion 71 extending backwardly from the rear part of the storage box 13 covers the fuel pump 72 from above. [0039]<br>
Since the fuel pump 72 is covered from above by the appentice portion 71 extending backwardly from the rear part of the storage box 13, it is sufficient for the appentice portion 71 to cover only the fuel pump 72 from above. Therefore, the storage box 13 integrally provided with the appentice portion 71 can be made smaller in size and reduced in weight. [0040]<br>
Furthermore, since it is not necessary to provide the appentice part 71 with a hole to penetrate the striker or a hole to allow the cap to protrude as in a conventional art, a shape of the appentice portion 71 can be simplified. In addition, even if the installation area of the fuel pump 72, specifically the delivery opening 82, fuel hose 83, connector 88 and the like, on the fuel tank 14 projects outwardly, this projecting part can be protected by the appentice portion 71 securely, thereby enhancing reliability of the motorcycle 10. [0041]<br>
The present invention is secondly characterized in that<br>
the fitting plane 77 of the fuel pump 72 is provided one-stage lower than the upper surface of the fuel pump 72, specifically the flat plane 92.<br>
Since the fitting plane 77 to install the fuel pump 72 is made one-stage lower than the flat plane 92 of the fuel tank 14, it is not necessary to form the appentice portion 71 particularly in high position and it is possible to make the appentice portion 71 substantially flat.  Furthermore, the shape of the storage box 13 can be simplified and cost for the storage box 13 can be reduced.  In addition, since the outwardly projecting part of the fuel pump 72, in particular the upwardly projecting part (the delivery opening 82, fuel hose 83, connector 88 and the like) is placed at lower position, the projecting part can be protected more securely. [0042]<br>
The present invention is thirdly characterized in that the appentice portion 71 is extended up to the front of the fill opening 74 provided on the flat plane 92 as a rear upper surface of the fuel tank 14.<br>
By extending the appentice portion 71 up to the front of the fill opening 74 provided on the flat plane 92 of the fuel tank 14, it is not necessary to provide a hole and the like to protrude the cap, compared to the conventional art that covers the fill opening from above, thereby simplifying the shape of the storage box 13 and reducing cost. [0043]<br>
The present invention is fourthly characterized in that the fuel pump 72 is offset with respect to the center line 108<br>
as the vehicle center.<br>
Since the fuel pump 72 is offset with respect to the center line 108 as the vehicle center, it is sufficient for the appentice portion 71 to cover only the fuel pump 72 from above, which has been offset with respect to the center line 108, and it is also possible to make the appentice portion 71 smaller. [0044]<br>
The present invention is fifthly characterized in that the fuel pump 72 is offset to the side of air cleaner 44.<br>
Since the fuel pump 72 is offset to the side of the air cleaner 44, the fuel pump 72 can be positioned closer to the intake system of the engine 51, for example, the intake manifold 48, and the fuel hose 83 can be shortened. In addition, the air cleaner 44 is positioned on the side of the side stand. Since the vehicle body is inclined, it is possible to supply the fuel to the intake system favorably, even when the fuel in the fuel tank is low in amount. [0045]<br>
In the present embodiment, it is disclosed that the storage box and the fuel tank are covered with a seat from above, but the present invention is not limited to this embodiment. It is further possible that only the storage box is covered from above with the seat, the fuel tank in the rear of the storage box is exposed outside without being covered with the seat, and the appentice portion is extended backwardly from the storage box integrally, so that the fuel pump mounted on the fuel tank is covered from above with such exteriorly exposed appentice portion.<br>
 [Industrial Applicability]<br>
[0046]<br>
The storage box and fuel tank structure according to the<br>
present invention is suitable for a motorcycle, in particular,<br>
for a scooter type vehicle. [Description of Reference Numerals]<br>
