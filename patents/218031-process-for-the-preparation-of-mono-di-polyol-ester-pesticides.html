				<td>The invention relates to a process for the preparation of novel mono/di/polyol ester pesticides. More particularly, it relates to substituted mono-, di-, and polyol esters as effective pesticides such as fungicides, nematicides, and the like.<br>
Background of invention<br>
Public has become concerned about the toxic pesticide residues that might be found in food, ground water, and the environment. There is therefore an urgent need to identify new pest control chemicals, compositions and methods that are safe to the environment and non-target organisms. Recent research in plant resistance to insect pests has demonstrated that secondary plant products such as glycolipids, glycerolipids as well as free fatty acids and esters present in plant exudates not only provide in-built plant resistance to invading pests, but also exhibit activity against certain phytophagous insects and pathogens. Being highly safe, some of the related esters such as sucrose esters of palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids find wide application in food industry as emulsifiers in cakes, biscuits, shampoos etc or as stabilizers, wetting agents, and solubilizers for poorly water-soluble drugs/chemicals. These reports have aroused interest in the synthesis and development of structurally similar mono-, di- and polyol esters as benign pest control agents. So far no literature reports are available employing mono/di or polyalkanoate moiety in such molecules for pest control purposes.<br>
Prior art<br>
The literature is replete with examples of naturally occurring lower and higher chain fatty acids (Lalonde,R.T., Morris, C.D., Wong, C.F.,Gardener, L.C., Eckert, D.J., King Drand Zimmermann, R.H. J. Chem Ecol. 1979, 5:371), glycerolipids such as 1,2-diacyl, 1,3-diacyl-and 1,2,3-triacylglycerol (Matsuzaki T., Shinozaki, Y., Hagimori, M., Tobita, T., Shigematsu,, H. and Koiwa, A. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1992, 56: 1565-1569), and glycolipids such as sugar esters (Severson R.F., Arrendale, R.F., Chortyk, O.T., Green, C.R., Thome, F.A., Stewart, J.L., and Johnson, A.W. J. Agric. Food. Chem. 1985, 33:870-875) exhibiting pest control properties. US patent 6,608,039 describes chemically synthesized sugar esters that are effective for the control of soft-bodied arthropods. In another US Patent 6,103,768, Savage et al describes fatty acids and their derivatives to control plant infections and pests. The use of fatty acid esters and alcohols has been earlier described for the control of powdery mildew on apple buds (US patent 3,931,413). US patent 4,002,775 describes microbiocidal food additives comprising 1 or 2-monolaurin polyol esters. Wax esters have also been reported to deter feeding of Locusta migratoria on sorghum (Atkin, D.S.J., Hamilton, R.J., and Bernays, E.A. J. Nat. Prod., 1982, 45: 694) and turnip rootfly on Brassica species (Shepherd, T., Robetson, G.W., Griffiths, D.W., and Birch, A.N.E. Phytochemistry 1997: 46: 83). Monoesters of alkenyl/alkynyl substituted glycols and glycerols obtained from idioblast cells of avocado (Persea americand) are also known to exhibit significant antifungal and insect growth inhibitory and feeding deterrent properties. Further naturally occurring alicyclic diol and polyol esters such as ryanodines, agarofuran and quassinoids derivatives are well known for their pest control properties. The availability of such natural esters in meager quantities has, however, been a serious constraint in their large-scale use. A need has, therefore, been felt to synthesize environmentally benign mono-, di-, and polyol esters with pesticidal activity.<br>
The present invention reports a process for the preparation of novel alkyl/aryl mono-, di-, polyol esters having unsubstituted or substituted alkyl aryl, aralkyl. cycloalkyl groups of varying chain lengths. The derivatives so obtained have been found as potential pesticides, particularly fungicides and nematicides.<br>
Objective of the invention<br>
An objective of the invention is to prepare novel pesticidal mono-, di- and/or polyol ester pesticides. Another objective is to establish bioactivity of these derivatives against various pests such as fungi, nematodes and others.<br>
The invention<br>
This invention relates to the development of a process for the preparation of novel pesticidal mono-, di- and/or polyol esters represented by the general formula I Ar/R-CO-O-RrOH, and formula II, Ar/R-CO-O-Ri-OCO-R/Ar, characterized by the reaction of compound(s) containing the diol moiety such as HO-RrOH or polyol moiety such as monosaccharide, disaccharide, and the like in I and II, with another compound bearing acyl moiety such as RCOC1 and/or ArCOCl to form a link -CO-O-R,-OH in I and CO-O-R1O-CO- in II , wherein the reaction is carried out in an inert aprotic solvent in a need based presence of a catalyst at temperature range of 15-100 °C and wherein the linkage in reference is formed as a result of condensation of these moieties yielding mono, di, or poly alkanoate esters. Esters so formed are exclusively mono, di, tri or poly alkanoate or mixture of two or more of such products.<br>
In the above generic formulae I, and II 'R' represents unsubstituted or substituted alkyl, alkenyl, or alkylyl group of varying chain lengths (C-l to C-18), aralkyl, cycloalkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxyalkyl, aryloxyalkyl, 'Ar' is substituted or unsubstituted aryl, alkylaryl, alkoxyalkyl, alkoxyaryl, phenoxyphenyl or the like group. 'Ri' in diols used to prepare esters of formulae I, and II are substituted or unsubstituted short and long chain alcohols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, methylalkane diols, butanediol, pentanediol, hexanediol, cyclohexanediol, heptanediol, cyclohexyloxy cyclohexane diol, catechol, resorcinol, phloroglucinol, phenoxyphenols, monosaccharides such as pentoses and hexoses, and/or disaccharides such as sucrose, maltose and the like. Diol functions in alicyclic and/or aromatic rings are located at 1,2-; 1,3-, or 1,4-positions.<br>
Acid chlorides [RCOC1, ArCOCl or ClOC-Ar-COCl] employed in the reaction are those obtained by the action of acids such as acetic-, chloroacetic-, cyclopropane carboxylic-, propionic, butyric, isobutyric, pentanoic, isopentanoic, hexanoic, 2-ethylhexanoyl, heptanoyl, octanoyl, pelargonyl, decanoyl, fatty acids, 2(4-chlorophenyl-3-methylbutanoic-, phenoxyaetic-, chlorophenoxyacetic, and substituted or unsubstituted phenylacetic, benzoic or phenoxy benzoic, with thionyl chloride. The structure of the diol/polyol esters have been confirmed by 'H NMR and mass spectroscopy.<br>
Typical reactions for the preparation of the said compound(s) of types I and II are given below.<br>

The reaction mixture was then filtered and the filtrate evaporated under vacuo to yield sucrose dibutanoate as pale yellow liquid (Yield 65%).<br>
Bioassay<br>
Anti-nemic and anti-fungal activities were assessed against the root knot nematode Meloidogynae incognita, the reniform nematode Rotylenchulus reniformis and the phytophagous fungi Rhizoctonia solani and Sclerotium rolfsii causing extensive damage to agricultural crops. The compounds exhibited outstanding activity against the test organisms.<br>
Nematicidal activity against the reniform nematode Rotylenchulus reniformis: Pesticidal alkane diol/polyol mono/di/polyalkanoates of the general formulae 1 to 3 were screened for their nematicidal activity against the reniform nematode Rotylenchulus reniformis. The nematodes originally isolated from a single egg mass from castor roots were cultured, multiplied and maintained on cowpea plants raised in 30 cm earthen pots containing sterilized soil-sand mixture. The egg masses were handpicked and kept on two layers of tissue paper supported by aluminum wire gauge (8-10 µ size) in 10 cm size Petri dishes were filled with fresh water. After 4 days, the population of R. reniformis emerged in the suspension was determined by counting J 4 in one ml aliquot three times and the average of three counts was taken as pot population in one ml suspension.<br>
The test solution of different diol/polyol esters (1500, 750, 500, 250, and 125 ppm) were prepared by serial dilution of the stock solution (3000ppm) in 0.5% emulsified water. Suspension of J 4 was diluted with water to 100 ml to get approximately 50 juveniles/ml. To one ml of this nematode suspension in Petri dish, equal volume of test solutions was added separately to get the desired test concentrations of 750, 500, 250, 125 and 62.5 ppm respectively. Juveniles kept in water with ethanol served as control. For each count, three replicates were taken and treated for 72 hr to observe juvenile immobility. Revival test was performed for each treatment by decanting off the test solution and adding distilled water to the Petri dishes. The number of revived juveniles were counted and deducted from the number of immobile juveniles obtained in the previous reading taken after 72 hr. Juveniles found immobile after the revival test were considered as dead.<br>
Antifungal activity against Rhizoctonia solani and Sclerotium rolfsii: The alkane diol/polyol esters were screened for their antifungal activity by the poisoned food technique using potato- dextrose-agar (PDA) medium. Cultures of the test fungi were maintained on PDA slants at 25°C and were sub-cultured in Petri dishes prior to testing. The ready-made medium (39g) was suspended in distilled water (1000 ml) and heated to boiling until it had dissolved completely. The medium and the Petri dishes were autoclaved and stock solutions were prepared by dissolving the test materials (130 mg) in acetone (2 ml). The dilution of 1,<br>
0.5, 0.25 and 0.125 ml of this solution in 65 ml of PDA medium gave test solutions of approximately 250, 100, 25 and 5 mg litre-1, respectively. Acetone (1 ml) served as control. The medium was poured in to a set of two Petri dishes (two replications) under aseptic conditions in a laminar flow hood and a 5 mm thick disc of fungus (spores and mycelium) cut from earlier sub-cultured Petri dishes, was placed at the center of the semi-solid medium and the lids of the dishes were replaced. The treated and control dishes were kept in a BOD incubator at 26 (± 2) °C till the fungal growth in the control dishes was almost complete (3-4 days). The mycelial growth of fungus (mm) in both treated and control Petri dishes was measured diametrically in three different directions and EC50 values (effective concentration for 50 % inhibition; mg ml-1) were calculated for inhibition of fungal growth using Basic LD50 Program, version 1.1.<br><br>
