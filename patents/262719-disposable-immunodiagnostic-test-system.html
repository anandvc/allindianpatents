 FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the field of<br>
immunodiagnostic test systems, kits, and devices, and more<br>
particularly to a disposable immunodiagnostic test system for<br>
testing for the presence of marker proteins in a liquid sample<br>
analyte.<br>
s<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Various diagnostic testing methods and kits have<br>
been used in clinical environments, such as, for example,<br>
immunochromatographic assays, multi-immunoassay diagnostic<br>
systems that test for the presence of antigens and/or<br>
antibodies, assay sample analyzing devices, and rapid<br>
immunoassay test strips. Other rapid assay test devices and<br>
methodologies may be known to a greater or lesser extent in<br>
the art, and these may be categorized into one of a number of<br>
formats, depending on whether the sample being tested flows<br>
through the device, and possibly also depending on the manner<br>
and/or direction of any such flow. For example, test devices<br>
may have a dipstick, a flow-through, and/or a lateral flow<br>
format.<br>
There is, however, a continuing need for a test<br>
device that may provide quicker and more accurate test<br>
results, that may not require the purchase of additional<br>
specialized equipment nor the supplemental training of already<br>
highly qualified testing personnel, and/or that may enable a<br>
single analyte sample to be tested on a substantially<br>
contemporaneous basis for the presence of any of a plurality<br><br>
of causative agents. There is likewise a need for an<br>
immunodiagnostic test system, kit and/or device (which may,<br>
hereinafter, simply be referred to as an "immunodiagnostic<br>
test system") that is effective and simple to use, and may be<br>
quickly administered.<br>
There is also a pressing need - one that has not<br>
been adequately addressed by previous devices' - for a test<br>
system that might be readily used and/or disposed of at the<br>
"point of care" and/or "in the field" (that is, outside of<br>
traditional clinical environments whether, for example, as<br>
part of a temporary outreach program, emergency response<br>
effort, in a field hospital, and/or in an actual field tending<br>
to a plant crop.or a herd of afflicted livestock).<br>
Additionally, there is a need for a test system that<br>
may be manufactured and/or assembled in the field and/or in a<br>
manufacturing facility that is specifically designed for that<br>
purpose. There is also a need for such a system that might<br>
also involve lower production and packaging costs.<br>
A further need exists for a test system that may be<br>
selectively adaptable to provide either qualitative and/or<br>
quantitative results, depending on user preferences and/or the<br>
nature of the test to be conducted.<br>
Previously, the disposal of "point of care"<br>
immunodiagnostic systems may have posed a significant<br>
difficulty or problem for those workers given this duty. In<br>
the past, such a device (that had been potentially<br>
contaminated device following its use) would typically have<br>
been sent to a landfill for disposal, thus giving rise to a<br>
whole host of environmental costs and concerns, including the<br>
potential that, over time, contaminants from the device might<br>
seep into the landfill and its surrounding regions. Landfill<br>
disposal of some currently marketed immunodiagnostic test<br><br>
systems has heretofore been substantially necessitated by the<br>
fact that such systems have typically been primarily composed<br>
of materials (such as plastic) that cannot be safely burned or<br>
incinerated without generating harmful and/or toxic fumes.<br>
The disposal of test systems in landfills has also typically<br>
involved additional transportation and disposal costs and<br>
efforts. Partially because of this last fact, field workers<br>
have been required to carry portable waste containers suited<br>
to securely transporting and disposing of such potentially<br>
contaminated- test systems.Such waste procedures may have<br>
involved sterile glassware, plastic ware, laboratory ware, and<br>
the like, as well as correspondingly stringent sterilizing and<br>
handling regimes. Accordingly, there is a continuing and<br>
acutely felt need for a test system that might be readily<br>
disposed of in a simple yet ecologically responsible manner,<br>
such as, for example, by incineration over an open fire.<br>
There is also a need for a test system that may be<br>
selectively adaptable to detect for viral, fungal, bacterial,<br>
and/or vector induced infections, any or all of these tests<br>
possibly being performed using a single sample.<br>
In addition to all of the foregoing,' there is a need<br>
for a test system that provides visually discernable test<br>
results and/or results within a relatively short period of<br>
time, such as, for example, within sixty to ninety seconds.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to<br>
obviate, mitigate, and/or address one or more of the above<br>
mentioned needs, shortcomings and/or disadvantages associated<br>
with the prior art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is<br><br>
disclosed a disposable immunodiagnostic test system for<br>
testing for the presence of marker proteins in a liquid sample<br>
analyte. The test system includes a substantially planar<br>
passage layer comprised of a first material having a<br>
substantially non-porous structure that is shaped so as to<br>
define at least one aperture therethrough. The test system<br>
also includes a protein layer comprised of a second material<br>
that is adapted to enable, in an operative configuration,<br>
substantial immobilization of combinable proteins thereon.<br>
The protein layer has a substantially porous structure so as<br>
to enable a portion of the liquid sample analyte to pass<br>
substantially therethrough. The protein layer is in intimate<br>
contacting relation with the passage layer so as to. define an<br>
active surface area on the protein layer that is substantially<br>
adjacent to, and substantially aligned with, the aperture of<br>
the passage layer. The test system also includes an absorbent<br>
layer comprised of a third material that enables absorption of<br>
at least a portion of the liquid sample analyte. The<br>
absorbent layer is in intimate contacting relation with the<br>
protein layer. In the operative configuration, the combinable<br>
proteins are substantially immobilized on the protein layer as<br>
aforesaid, and the liquid sample analyte is introduced onto<br>
the protein layer through the at least one aperture of the<br>
passage layer. In a positive result configuration the marker<br>
proteins are bound to the combinable proteins and<br>
substantially immobilized relative to the protein layer. In a negative result configuration, at least a portion of the<br>

adapted to display a control reading both in the positive<br>
result configuration and in the negative result configuration,<br>
so as to operatively confirm that the test system has been<br>
used properly.<br>
According to an additional aspect of a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, the test system may preferably<br>
further comprise a housing substantially encapsulating the<br>
passage layer, the protein layer, and the absorbent layer. A<br>
lower housing portion of the housing is in intimate contacting<br>
relation with the absorbent layer. An upper housing portion<br>
of the housing is in intimate contacting relation with the<br>
passage layer. . The upper housing portion is shaped so as to<br>

embodiments of the invention, the visible portion of the<br>
active surface area may preferably further comprise a second<br>
test surface area. In the operative configuration, second<br>
combinable proteins are substantially immobilized on the<br>
second test ' surface area. In the positive result<br>
configuration, the marker proteins are bound to the second<br>
combinable proteins and substantially immobilized relative to<br>

DETA3XED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring now to Figures 1A, IB, 5A and 5B of the<br>
drawings, there is shown a preferred embodiment of a<br>
disposable immunodiagnostic test system 70, according to the<br>
invention, for testing for the presence of marker proteins.<br><br>
(alternatively referred to as "analytes") in a liquid sample<br>
analyte (not shown, but alternately referred to as a "liquid<br>
sample"} . As best seen in Figure 5A, one of the preferred<br>
embodiments, of the test system 70 includes a combined testing<br>
subassembly 50 and a housing 60.<br>
It is also noted that, as best seen in Figures 1A<br>
and IB, the test system 70 may simply include the combined<br>
testing subassembly 50, without the housing 60.<br>
Kith further .reference to Figure IB, the combined<br>
testing subassembly 50 will be seen to include a substantially<br>
planar passage layer 12, a protein layer 14, and an absorbent<br>
layer 16, each of which is preferably constructed of a<br>
combustible material that produces non-toxic by-products upon<br>
incineration. For this reason, among others, the combined<br>
testing subassembly 50 may be easily disposed of in an<br>
environmentally responsible manner, such as, for example, by<br>
incineration over an open flame.<br>
As aforesaid, the passage layer. 12 is substantially<br>
planar and has an aperture 24 therethrough that is defined by<br>
a corresponding inner edge 26 of the passage layer 12. While<br>
the preferred embodiment shown in Figures 1A, IB, 5A and 5B<br>
has . a single aperture 24 through the passage layer 12, the<br>
passage layers of other embodiments (see, for example, Figures<br>
2D through 2F which are discussed in further detail<br>
hereinbelow) may be provided with more than one aperture 24.<br>
The passage layer 12 has a substantially non-porous structure,<br>
such that it will preferably have a substantially impermeable,<br>
non-sponge, and unwoven nature. The passage layer 12 may<br>
preferably, but not necessarily, be constructed of a densely<br>
packed paper material, such as cardboard. Other relatively<br>
rigid materials, such as, for example, tree bark and/or packed<br>
leaf materials, may also be used in the construction of the<br><br>
.passage layer 12 according to the invention. Thus, whether as<br>
a result of its preferably densely packed nature, the inherent<br>
properties of its material of construction, or otherwise, the<br>
- passage layer 12 preferably provides a measure of rigidity to<br>
the test system 70. The passage layer 12 is preferably,<br>
though not necessarily, between about 0.2 and 10 millimeters<br>
in thickness, with an even more preferred thickness being<br>
substantially within the range of between about 2 and 4<br>
millimeters=<br>
As best seen in Figures 1A and IB, the protein layer<br>
14 is in intimate contacting relation with the passage layer<br>
12. The protein layer 14 has an active surface area 30 that<br>
is substantially adjacent to said aperture 24 of said.passage<br>
layer 12, and substantially aligned therewith (as indicated<br>
generally by phantom line "A" in Figure IB). As best seen in<br>
Figure 1A, at least a portion 31 of the active surface area 30<br>
is preferably visible through the aperture 24.<br>
The protein layer 14 may preferably, though not<br>
necessarily, be constructed from nitrocellulose, nylon, and/or<br>
acetate, and indeed from any such other material upon which<br>
reactant . and/or combinable proteins might be bound or<br>
immobilized (alternately, hereinafter ■ "substantially<br>
immobilized"). In biotechnology, the terms "immobilization"<br>
and ".immobilized'7 may be generally regarded as referring to<br>
the technique used for, and/or the state of, physical or<br>
chemical fixation of cells, organelles, enzymes, or other<br>
proteins (e.g., monoclonal antibodies) onto a solid support,<br>
into a solid matrix, and/or retained by a" membrane, among<br>
other things,, in order, to increase their stability and/or for<br>
various other purposes. It is thought, though not essential to<br>
the working of the test system 70, that nitrocellulose is an<br>
effective protein-binding material that might be used in the<br><br>
protein layer 14. Suitable commercially available<br>
nitrocellulose membranes may be cast on a supporting thin<br>
paper backing and used in the protein layer 14 according to. a<br>
preferred embodiment the present invention. The protein layer<br>
14 is preferably, though not necessarily, no greater than<br>
about 5 millimeters in thickness, with an even more preferred<br>
thickness being substantially within the range of between<br>
about 0.5 and 2.0 millimeters.<br>
The protein layer 14 has a substantially porous<br>
structure, meaning that it is preferably provided v?ith a<br><br>
plurality of pores (not shown) therethrough. In the case of<br>
nitrocellulose membranes and some of the other preferred<br>
protein layer 14 materials, it is now believed, though not<br>
essential to the working of the test system 70, that the<br>
provision of larger sized pores in the protein, layer 14 will<br>
afford correspondingly lower protein binding capabilities<br>
and/or capacities. As discussed in further detail<br>
hereinbelow, a protein layer 14 having lower protein binding<br>
capabilities may lower the sensitivity of any test performed<br>
using the system 70. A nitrocellulose protein layer 14 will<br>
preferably, though not necessarily, have pore sizes between<br>
about 0.1 microns and 25 microns in diameter, with an even<br>
more preferred diametrical size being substantially within the<br>
range of between about 0.4 and 2.0 microns. It is believed<br>
that protein layers 14 having pores (not shown) that are sized<br>
substantially within . the aforesaid range may afford an<br>
improved protein binding capacity.<br>
As best seen in Figure IB, the absorbent layer 16 is<br>
in intimate contacting relation with the passage layer 12. As<br>
its name suggests, the absorbent layer 16 is constructed of an<br>
absorbent material that is preferably adapted, depending on<br>
the nature of the test to be performed, to take in or absorb<br>
at least a portion (more preferably, an excess portion) of the<br>
liquid sample analyte that is to be tested. The absorbent<br>
layer 16 may preferably be formed from a- sponge material, or<br>
indeed any other material capable of taking in or absorbing at<br>
least a portion of the liquid sample analyte (not shown). For<br>
example, the absorbent layer 16 may be constructed from a<br>
paper towel and/or an acetate material. The absorbent layer<br>
16 is preferably, though not necessarily, between about 1 and<br>
50 millimeters in thickness, with an even more preferred<br>
thickness being substantially within the range of between<br><br>
about 5 and 20 millimeters. Preferably, the absorbent layer<br>
16 will be adapted so that it might absorb and retain three<br>
times, or more, of the volume of the liquid sample analyte<br>
that is to be administered during a single test.<br>
As aforesaid, the absorbent layer 16 is in intimate<br>
contacting relation with the protein layer 14, and the protein<br>
layer 14 is in intimate contacting relation with the passage<br>
layer 12. Preferably, though not essential to the basic<br>
working of the test system 70, the passage layer 12 and the<br>
protein layer 14 may be held together in the aforesaid<br>
intimate contacting relation with the aid of a sealant (not<br>
shown) that is substantially juxtaposed therebetween.<br>
Likewise, the protein layer 14 and the passage layer 16 may<br>
preferably be held together in the aforesaid intimate<br>
contacting relation with the aid of the same or a different<br>
sealant (not shown) that is substantially juxtaposed<br>
therebetween. Suitable sealants according• to the invention<br>
may preferably, but not necessarily, include glue and other<br>
adhesives, as well as the use of stapling, stitching, and<br>
thermal and/or ultrasound sealing methodologies, or indeed any<br>
other material or process that is suitable to ensure that the<br>
layers 12, 14, 16 are substantially maintained in the<br>
aforesaid intimate contacting relation with one another. It<br>
is contemplated that, for ease of manufacture, a conventional<br>
thermal sealer or glue intended for domestic use may suffice<br>
to provide sufficient sealing properties according to the<br>
invention-.	<br>
As best seen in Figures 1A and 5A, the combined<br>
testing subassembly 50 may preferably also include a<br>
subassembly peripheral sealing 34. As shown in Figures 1A and<br>
5A, the subassembly—peripherarr— seating—34 - - in a preferred—<br>
embodiment of the test system 70 may securely engage<br><br>
peripheral edge portions of each of the layers 12, 14, 16.<br>
The subassembly peripheral sealing -34 may be constructed of<br>
the same or a yet different sealant as that which is discussed<br>
hereinabove. For example, the subassembly peripheral sealing<br>
34 may consist of an adhesive material™ that Ttiay^ be adhered to-<br>
the peripheral edge portions of the layers 12, 14, 16. In<br>
addition to the aforesaid, sealants, and. .sealing .methodologies.,- _<br>
the subassembly peripheral sealing 34 may alternately be<br>
constructed of any material or indeed in:-a-form that-provides -<br>
physical compression of the layers 12, 14, 16 (possibly<br>
substantially, adjacent to their peripheral edge portions) to<br>
ensure -that" they are maintained in intimate contacting<br>
relation with one another. For ~ example,	the ~ subassembly- ~<br>
peripheral sealing 34 may consist of a clamping member (not<br>
shown) that engages the peripheral edge portion of the passage<br>
layer 12 and the absorbent layer 16 so as to apply a<br>
compressive force to all three layers 12, 14, 16 in intimate<br>
contacting relation with one another.<br>
As best seen in Figures 5A and 5B, the housing 60<br>
substantially encapsulates the passage layer 12, the protein<br>
layer 14, and the absorbent layer 16, as they may together be<br>
preferably, but not necessarily, assembled to form the<br>
combined testing subassembly 50. The housing 60 may<br>
preferably include an upper housing portion 10 and a lower<br>
housing portion 18. The upper housing portion 10 and the<br>
lower housing portion 18 may be preferably, but not<br>
necessarily, in intimate contacting relation with the passage<br>
layer 12 and the absorbent layer 16 respectively. Preferably,<br>
the upper housing portion 10 and the passage layer 12 may be<br>
held together in the aforesaid intimate contacting relation<br>
with the aid of. the same or a different sealant (not shown) as<br>
that aforesaid, which sealant is substantially juxtaposed<br><br>
therebetween. Likewise, the lower housing portion 18 and the<br>
absorbent layer 16 may preferably be held together in the<br>
aforesaid intimate contacting relation with the aid of the<br>
same or a still different sealant (not shown) that is<br>
substantially juxtaposed therebetween.<br>
As . best seen in Figure 5B, the . housing 60 may<br>
preferably be further provided with housing edge portions 36<br>
that are substantially contiguous with one or more peripheral<br>
edges of each of the upper and lower housing portions 10, 18.<br>
The housing edge portion 36 in a preferred embodiment of the<br>
test system 70 may securely engage peripheral edge portions 34<br>
of the combined testing subassembly 50 (as shown in Figure<br>
5B), and/or it may engage the peripheral edge portions of each<br>
of the layers 12, 14, 16 (as shown in Figures 2A, 2D and 3,<br>
and discussed in further detail hereinbelow). The housing<br>
edge portion 36 may be constructed~~ of """the same - ~or~ -&amp;-- yet<br>
different -sealant as that--which- is--discussed hereinabove,<br>
including any of the 'alternate sealant materials,<br>
methodologies, and/or forms that are mentioned hereinabove<br>
with reference to the subassembly peripheral sealing 34,<br>
preferably so as to maintain the combined testing subassembly<br>
50 in intimate contacting relation with the housing 60.<br>
As best seen in Figures 5A and 5B (and as also shown<br>
in Figures 2A, 2B, 2D, 2E and 3, wherein other preferred<br>
embodiments of the test system 70 are depicted, as may be<br>
discussed in further detail hereinbelow), the upper housing<br>
portion 10 is provided with a housing aperture 20 therethrough<br>
that is defined by a corresponding inner edge 22 of the upper<br>
housing portion 10. The housing 60 -is preferably constructed<br>
from substantially non-porous materials, meaning ones that are<br>
preferably substantially impermeable, and/or of a non-<br>
absorbing and/or unwoven construction.<br><br>
All portions of the housing 60 are preferably<br>
constructed of materials that produce non-toxic by-products<br>
upon incineration-, so-~as- to better- ensure- that- -the test system<br>
70 might be disposed of in an environmentally responsible<br>
manner, such as, for example, by combustion. Paper is one<br>
preferred material that may be suitable for the construction<br>
of the housing 60. Other like materials-may-also-be-used for -<br>
the housing 60 according to the invention, and such materials<br>
might include cloth, nylon, silk, and/or biodegradable<br>
membranes. Each of the upper and lower housing portions 10,<br>
18 is preferably, though not necessarily, between about 0.1<br>
and 3 millimeters in thickness, with an even more preferred<br>
thickness being substantially within the range of between<br>
about 0.2 and 0.4 millimeters.<br>
Preferably, but not necessarily, the dimensions of a<br>
single test system 70 adapted for the testing of a single<br>
liquid analyte sample will be substantially in the order of<br>
about 20mm x 20mm x 10mm.<br>
As shown in Figure 5B, the upper housing portion 10<br>
of the housing 60 preferably includes an exterior surface<br>
portion 46 with labeling indicia 11 marked thereon.<br>
Preferably, the labeling indicia 11 may be visible to the<br>
unaided human eye, and may include sequentially numbered<br>
barcode indicia 13 and/or text indicia 15. In embodiments not<br>
including the housing 60, the labeling indicia 60 may<br>
alternately be directly marked (not shown) on an exterior<br>
surface portion of the passage layer 12. In either event, the<br>
labeling indicia 11 may be marked on the exterior surface<br>
portion by way of printing, adhering or being written.<br>
Sequentially numbered barcode indicia 13 may preferably, but<br>
not necessarily, be provided to enable the tracking of each<br>
test system 70 and for other purposes, including, for example.<br><br>
quality control purposes. Similarly, text indicia 15 may<br>
include information and data about the disposable<br>
immunodiagnostic test system 70 and its intended uses, such<br>
as, for • example., the name of the intended test, expiration<br>
dates, instructions, storage conditions, disposal<br>
instructions, and/or the like. It is to be further<br>
appreciated that the labeling indicia 11 may also consist of<br>
color coding (not shown) to identify each different the type<br>
of specific test system 70.<br>
As best seen in Figure 5A, the test system 70 may be<br>
assembled by preferably, but not necessarily, inserting the<br>
combined testing subassembly 50 in the hollow housing 60. The<br>
housing aperture 20 may preferably be in substantially<br>
vertical registration with the underlying aperture 24 in the<br>
passage layer 12. The housing 60 may thereafter preferably be<br>
sealed at each of its open ends with the housing edge portion<br>
36. As aforesaid, the material from which the housing edge<br>
portion 36 is formed may or may not be the same sealant<br>
material as that used for the subassembly peripheral sealing<br>
34. In the aforesaid manner, the disposable immunodiagnostic<br>
test system 70 (as best seen in Figure 5B) may preferably, but<br>
not necessarily, be completely assembled.<br>
Figures _ 2A ^through „4E_ depict alternate. _ preferred. %_<br>
embodiments of the test system 70 wherein, as is the case with<br>
all of the drawings, similar reference numerals have been used<br>
to designate like elements of the present invention, where<br>
possible, in the various views for ease of reference. The<br>
embodiment of the test system 70 that is shown in Figures 2A,<br>
2B, 2C, and 3 is in most respects identical to that which has<br>
been discussed hereinabove, save that the upper and lower<br>
housing layers 10, 18 each consist of substantially planar and<br><br>
substantially more discrete layer portions that the more<br>
pillow-shaped embodiment that is shown in Figures 5A and 5B.<br>
It may be appreciated from all of the foregoing, and<br>
as best seen in Figure 2B, the housing aperture 20 is<br>
substantially aligned with the passage layer aperture 24 (as<br>
generally indicated by phantom lines "B" in Figure 2B).<br>
As best seen in Figure 2C, the upper surface of the<br>
protein layer 14 may preferably, but not necessarily, be<br>

In accordance with yet further preferred embodiments<br>
of the invention which are shown in Figures 6 and 7 of the<br>
drawings, the disposable immunodiagnostic test system 70 may<br>
be provided-i-in' *a«*fflul-feLpie=^teesfc y£^oamtaSs^-i^Sn&gt;ss©Gh^emB3"dMrer^s^i^i;<br>
individual test systems 70 may be arranged in side-by-side<br>
removably connected and/or frangible relation by means of<br>
tearable housing perforations 38 that may be torn by an end<br>
user (not shown), • who might determine the number of test<br>
systems 70 that are' required for any particular or intended<br>
use. The individual test systems 70 that are shown in Figure<br>
6 may each substantially correspond with those shown elsewhere<br><br>
Similarly, in a veterinary -setting,... the^system 70- -<br>
may be used to detect for the presence of various diseases in<br>
animals and/or household pets, such as dogs or cats. For<br>
example, the system 70 might be used to detect for the<br>
presence of heartworm disease and/or other diseases, such as,<br>
for example, leishmaniasis, parvo viral infections, and/or<br>
lyme disease. 	<br>
By way of yet another example, the system 70 may<br>
preferably, but not necessarily, also be used to detect for<br>
the presence of various environmental pollutants,' such as, for<br>
example, gasoline additives like methyl tertiary butyl ether.<br>
In the case of such gasoline additives, and while they may<br>
typically be used to benefit ~ ~air quality - by - ~ reducing^ "<br>
automobile emissions, they may also problematically find their<br>
way to groundwater supplies- that - may ultimately be destined<br>
for human consumption.<br>
By way of yet a further example, the test system 70<br>
may also be used to detect for the presence of various<br>
diseases common to humans that may be caused by any number of<br>
pathogens. For example, the test system 70 of the .present<br>
invention may be capable of use to simultaneously detect for<br>
the presence of causative agents associated with a number of<br>
diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases. In the case of<br>
cardiovascular- diseases, the causative agents may include a<br>
wide number of differing pathogens, such as, for example,<br>
agents of viral, fungal and/or bacterial origin. In such a<br>
test, the system 70 might also ^be~ used" to "test~ for- the—<br>
presence of antibodies to healthy cell markers, such as, for<br>
example, the.protein myosin which is found in heart muscles,<br>
and/or to any of the causative agents listed hereinabove.<br>
The particular applications of the test system 70<br>
which are discussed herein are merely intended to serve as<br><br>
examples of the testing capabilities of the invention, and are<br>
not intended to limit the potential applications of the test<br>
system 70 and its varied uses in conjunction with various<br>
liquid sample analytes.	<br>
Operatively, the protein layer 14 of the test device<br>
70 will preferably have combinable proteins (not shown) bound<br>
to and/or substantially immobilized thereon. Within the scope<br>
of the invention, the combinable proteins may be stuck onto a<br>
surface of the protein layer 14 and/or they might be<br>
substantially embedded therein. Indeed, a wide variety of<br>
different manners of binding and/or affixation of the<br>
combinable proteins to the protein layer 14 - will preferably<br>
fall within the scope of the invention.<br>
The combinable proteins that are operatively bound<br>
to the protein layer 14 of the test system 70 may preferably<br>
be specifically selected to correspond with the test to be<br>
conducted and/or so as to ensure binding with the sought-after<br>
marker proteins that may be present in the particular liquid<br>
sample analyte that is to be tested. For example, and without<br>
limitation, if the test system 70 is intended to test for the<br>
presence of HIV 1, then combinable proteins that are<br>
particularly well suited to bind with HIV 1 and/or its marker<br>
proteins might be substantially immobilized on the protein<br>
layer 14. Similarly, if the test system 70 is to be used to<br>
test for Hepatitis C, then combinable proteins that are<br>
particularly well suited to bind with Hepatitis C and/or its<br>
marker proteins might be substantially immobilized on the<br>
protein layer 14.<br>
As stated above, the test system 70 may preferably,<br>
but not necessarily, be used to simultaneously detect for the<br>
presence of causative agents for a wide number of diseases,<br>
including, for example, agents of viral, fungal and/or<br><br>
bacterial origin, with corresponding combinable proteins<br>
immobilized on the protein layer 14-in such instances. That<br>
is the combinable proteins may comprise proteins which are<br>
adapted to be bound to fungal marker proteins, viral marker<br>
proteins, bacterial marker proteins, and/or vector-induced<br>
marker proteins, as may be present in the tested liquid sample<br>
analyte.<br>
It may be appreciated that the protein layer 14 is<br>
a "reaction zone" of the test system 70. In an operative<br>
configuration according to the invention, the combinable<br>
proteins will preferably be substantially immobilized on the<br>
protein layer 14, and more preferably, on the active surface<br>
area 30 and visible portion 31 of the protein layer 14.<br>
According to the invention, the nitrocellulose or other<br>
protein layer 14 of the test system 70 may preferably be<br>
provided to the end user (not shown) with the combinable<br>
proteins already substantially immobilized thereon.<br>
Alternately, the combinable proteins may also preferably be<br>
immobilized on the protein layer' 14 at, or near, the time of<br>
testing. In either event, and as aforesaid, the combinable<br>
proteins-_w.i 11 -preferably,-be—those _ to..which . the- sought-after . .._<br>
marker proteins, if present in the tested subject liquid<br>
sample analyte, will affix such as by sticking or binding.<br>
It is contemplated,though not essential -to the<br>
working of the system 70, that the combinable proteins may<br>
preferably be immobilized directly onto the protein layer 14<br>
in the general vicinity of the active surface area 30, and<br>
more preferably in the visible portion 31 of the active<br>
surface area 30. The combinable proteins may be immobilized<br>
in the visible portion 31 of the active surface area 30 in any<br>
desired pattern, shape or design, even after the test system<br>
70 has been fully assembled. For example, and without<br><br>
limitation, after assembly of the test system 70, HIV 1<br>
combinable proteins might preferably be immobilized on the<br>
active surface area 30 in the visually discernable form of a<br>
numeral "1" (not shown), and likewise, Hepatitis C combinable<br>
proteins might preferably be immobilized thereon in the form<br>
of the letter "C". Of course, any such other format might be<br>
used to suit the user and/or manufacturer of the test system<br>
70.<br>
According to the invention, combinable proteins may'<br>
be. substantially immobilized on the protein layer 14 by<br>
applying and/or depositing a combinable protein solution (not<br>
shown) onto the active surface area 30 of the protein layer<br>
14, such as, for example, by ink jet spraying, by physically<br>
using a pipette, and/or by touching the combinable protein<br>
solution onto the designated area of the nitrocellulose<br>
membrane or other protein layer 14, such that the combinable<br>
proteins might then be absorbed onto the protein layer 14 by<br>
suction and/or capillary action.<br>
It should therefore be appreciated that, prior to<br>
testing, when the test system 70 is assembled in the operative<br>
configuration, combinable proteins for the detection of a<br>
plurality of different marker proteins in the liquid sample ~<br>
analyte may preferably be selected and/or immobilized, in any<br>
useful pattern on the protein layer 14, substantially in the<br>
region of the active surface area 30.<br>
With the combinable proteins ' substantially<br>
immobilized to the active surface area 30 of the protein layer<br>
14, marker proteins (not shown) in the liquid sample analyte<br>
may be permitted, in some of the contemplated uses discussed<br>
hereinbelow, to become substantially immobilized relative to<br>
the protein layer 14.<br><br>
As best seen in Figures 4A and 4B, the active<br>
surface area 30 is preferably viewable, by'the user, through<br>
the housing , aperture 20 and the aperture 24 in the passage<br>
layer. In the embodiment shown in Figures 4A and 4B, the<br>
active surface area 30 includes a first test surface area 32<br>
and a procedural control surface area 28.— In the operative<br>
configuration, the combinable proteins immobilized on the<br>
protein layer 14 are substantially immobilized on the first<br>
test surface area 32. The procedural control surface area 28<br>
is adapted to display a control reading both in a positive<br>
result configuration (as shown in Figures 4A and 4B) and in a<br>
negative result configuration (not shown) of the test system<br>
70, so as to preferably confirm that it has been used, handled<br>
and/or stored properly.<br>
More specifically, and as best seen in Figures 4A<br>
and 4B, if the test system 70 has been used, handled and<br>
stored properly, a control reading may preferably be generated<br>
in and displayed from the procedural control surface area 28.<br>
The control reading may preferably, but not necessarily, take<br>
the form of a color or other indication that may correspond to<br>
a pattern of the •combinable proteins that are operatively<br>
immobilized on the active surface area 30 of the protein layer<br>
14, as discussed above.<br>
The absence of a control reading in the procedural<br>
control surface area 28 might preferably indicate that any<br>
test performed using the system 70. may be invalid	It-should- _.<br>
be appreciated that, while the procedural control surface area<br>
28 need not, strictly speaking, be present in the test system<br>
70 according to the invention, it is preferably present.<br>
If a single type of qualitative marker protein test<br>
is to be performed using the system 70, the procedural control<br>
surface area 28 may preferably, but not necessarily, be<br><br>
arranged irv relation■-t-o- the first test surface area 32 in the<br>
manner depicted in Figure 4A.<br>
Alternately, if a quantitative marker protein test<br>
is to be performed using the system 70, the procedural control<br>
surface area 28 may preferably, but not necessarily, be<br>
located in a substantially central location of the active<br>
surface area 30, as shown in Figure 4B. In Figure 4B, the<br>
active surface area 30 may preferably further comprise a<br>
supplemental first test surface area 32a. The =same combinable<br>
proteins are preferably operatively immobilized on both the<br>
first test surface area 32 and the supplemental first test<br>
surface area 32a, albeit in preferably, though not<br>
necessarily, different concentrations. For example, a<br>
substantially higher concentration of combinable proteins may "<br>
be substantially immobilized on the supplemental first test<br>
area 32a relative to a concentration of the combinable<br>
proteins on the first test surface area 32.<br>
Likewise, and as best seen in Figure 4C, if the user<br>
wishes to-test for the presence of multiple marker proteins at<br>
substantially the same time using a single system 70, the<br>
procedural control surface area 28 may preferably, but not<br>
necessarily, be located in a substantially central location of<br>
the active surface area 30. As shown in Figure 4C, the active<br>
surface area 30 may additionally include a second test surface<br>
area 33, with a second set of different combinable proteins<br>
(not shown) operatively immobilized thereon. The second set<br>
of combinable proteins may preferably be selected and/or<br>
adapted --to detect for the presence of different marker<br>
proteins than those of the (first set of) combinable proteins.<br>
Likewise, the second set of combinable proteins may<br>
immobilized in any useful pattern on the protein layer 14.<br><br>
In addition to the first test surface area 32, the<br>
supplemental first test surface area 32a, and the second test<br>
surface area 33, and as shown in Figure 4C, the active surface<br>
area 30 may also include a supplemental second test surface<br>
33a. The same combinable proteins are preferably operatively<br>
immobilized on both the second test surface area 33 and the<br>
supplemental second test surface area 33a, albeit in<br>
preferably, though not necessarily, different concentrations.<br>
For example, a substantially higher concentration of<br>
combinable proteins may be substantially immobilized on the<br>
supplemental second test area 33a relative -to a concentration<br>
of the combinable proteins on the second test surface area 33.<br>
As best seen in Figure 4C, the first test surface<br>
area 32 and the supplemental first test surface area 32a may<br>
preferably, but not necessarily, together notionally define a<br>
substantially planar first test ring 40. Each of the first<br>
test surface area 32 and the supplemental first test surface<br>
area 32a are preferably, but not necessarily, notionally<br>
situated therewithin. In such a configuration, the'procedural<br>
control surface area 28 may preferably, but not necessarily,<br>
be substantially circumscribed within the first test ring 40.<br>
The second test surface area 33 and the supplemental<br>
second test surface area 33a may also preferably, but not<br>
necessarily, together notionally define a substantially planar<br>
second test ring 42. Each of the second test surface area 33<br>
and the supplemental second test surface area 33a are<br>
preferably, but not necessarily, notionally situated<br>
therewithin. In such embodiments, and as best seen in Figure<br>
4C, the second test ring 42 may preferably, but not<br>
necessarily, substantially circumscribe the first test ring<br>
40.<br><br>
Alternatively, the first test surface area 32, the<br>
supplemental first test surface area 32a, the second test<br>
surface area 33, the supplemental second test surface area<br>
33a, and the procedural control surface area 28 may together<br>
notionally define various configurations, such as, for<br>
example, various other concentric and/or non-concentric<br>
geometric shapes. Of course, other geometric shapes may be<br>
formed that may, for example, comprise differing a multiple<br>
number of concentric shapes.<br>
In another contemplated embodiment of the invention,<br>
the first and/or the second test surface area 32, 33 may<br>
. consist of 'mimicry surface_ areas.1; More specifically, the<br>
combinable proteins substantially immobilized on the first<br>
and/or second test surface areas 32, 33 may be native proteins<br>
that are biosynthesizable by substantially healthy cells in<br>
the liquid sample analyte and/or-a-species furnishing same.<br>
The embodiment of the test system 70 that is shown<br>
in Figures 4D and 4E is perhaps deserving of some additional<br>
explanation. In this embodiment, and as aforesaid (i.e.,<br>
corresponding generally to the discussion of Figures 2D<br>
through 2F hereinabove), the passage layer 12 is formed with<br>
first and second apertures 24a, 24b, and a control aperture<br>
24c therethrough. As may be best appreciated from a<br>
consideration of Figures 2E and 4E, the first apertures 24a<br>
are substantially aligned "A" with the first test ring 40, the<br>
second apertures -24b are substantially aligned witrhrirhe second ~<br>
test ring 42, and the control aperture 24c is substantially<br>
aligned with the procedural control surface area 28 on the<br>
protein layer 14.<br>
The use of the test system 70 will now be described<br>
with reference to the various embodiments which are depicted<br>
in the drawings. It should, however, be appreciated, that the<br><br>
following discussion of use may also preferably, but not<br>
necessarily, apply generally to other embodiments which are<br>
not illustrated, but which may fall within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
In a typical test, and prior to applying and/or<br>
testing the liquid sample analyte, a first drop of wash buffer<br>
is preferably added to the test system 70 through the housing<br>
aperture 20 of the upper housing portion 10, to wet the<br>
visible portion 31 of the active surface area 30 on the<br>
protein layer 14, and is allowed to adsorb. The wash buffer<br>
will preferably, but not necessarily, act as a blocker for any<br>
areas on the active surface area 30 where no combinable<br>
proteins have been immobilized, so as to provide an inactive<br>
protein wash bound area 44 (as seen in, for example, Figure 4A<br>
and 4B), thus preferably preventing the indiscriminate<br>
affixation of marker and/or other proteins from the liquid<br>
sample analyte thereon.<br>
The liquid sample analyte may preferably then be<br>
introduced, using a pipette or the like, through the housing<br>
aperture 20 of the test system 70. The housing aperture 20 is<br>
in operative fluid communication with the passage layer<br>
aperture 24, such that the liquid sample analyte may<br>
preferably be deposited onto the active surface area 30 of<br>
protein layer 14 through the at least one aperture 24 of the<br>
passage layer 12. The liquid sample analyte may be<br>
operatively introduced through the housing aperture 20 in a<br>
quantity that is preferably, though not necessarily,<br>
sufficient to cover the visible portion 31.<br>
As aforesaid, the test system 70 of the present<br>
invention tests for the presence of marker proteins in the<br>
liquid sample analyte. In a positive result configuration,<br>
and as best shown in Figures 4A through 4E, use of the test<br><br>
system 70 will preferably reveal that the sought-after marker<br>
proteins are actually present in the liquid sample analyte.<br>
In the positive result configuration, one or more marker<br>
proteins from the liquid sample analyte will preferably be<br>
bound to the combinable proteins and substantially immobilized<br>
relative to active surface area 30 of the protein layer 14.<br>
In the event that the analyte contains both first<br>
and second sought-after marker proteins, and in the- further<br>
event that the active surface area 30 includes both first and<br>
second test surface -areas-32-,--33, the first and second test<br>
surface areas 32, 33 may preferably have the first and second<br>
marker proteins respectively bound thereto in the positive<br>
result configuration.<br>
In the event that, as aforesaid, the combinable<br>
proteins comprise native proteins substantially immobilized on<br>
the mimicry surface area, in the positive result<br>
configuration, the marker proteins may preferably be bound to<br>
the native proteins and substantially immobilized relative to<br>
the protein layer. 	<br>
Conversely, in a negative result configuration, the<br>
use of the test system 70 will preferably not reveal the<br>
presence of any of the marker proteins in the liquid sample<br>
analyte. In the negative result configuration (not shown), at<br>
least a portion and preferably most and/or substantially all<br>
of the liquid sample analyte will pass substantially through<br>
the protein layer 14, without affixing to any of the<br>
combinable proteins immobilized thereon.<br>
In any event, and whether due in part to gravity or<br>
under an influence of another force (such as, for example,<br>
inertial forces which may be created in a centrifuge), a<br>
portion of the liquid, sample analyte _may preferably^ Jtrav_erse__<br><br>
substantially vertically through the test system 70, and/or<br>
across the protein layer 14, away from its point of entry.<br>
Preferably, a sufficient quantity of the liquid<br>
sample analyte will be introduced onto the protein layer 14 so<br>
as to ensure that any sought-after marker proteins which may<br>
be contained therein become substantially immobilized relative<br>
to the protein layer 14 (in a positive result configuration)<br>
or not (in a negative result configuration).<br>
The aforesaid substantially- porous structure of the<br>
protein layer 14 preferably enables a portion of the liquid<br>
sample analyte to pass therethrough. In the event of liquid<br>
sample analytes that contain particulate matter (such as whole<br>
blood), that are lipaemic, and/or that may require further<br>
clarification or amplification .may.-not.....filter through _pore_<br>
sizes smaller than about 5 to 6 microns in the protein layer<br>
14, such liquid sample analytes may preferably, but not<br>
necessarily, be clarified and/or broken down prior to testing.<br>
Liquid sample analytes- that--may -be tested without further<br>
clarification and/or amplification may preferably include, for<br>
example, serum, plasma, urine, perspiration and/or exudates.<br>
Other aqueous extracts that may preferably be clarified by<br>
filtration and/or centrifugation may also form a part of the<br>
analyte to be tested using with test system 70.<br>
Thereafter, a "drop or other necessary- -quantity- o:f -a - - -<br>
reagent may prefer ably then be added, in a preferred quantity<br>
that covers the visible portion 31 of the active surface area<br>
30. The reagent is particularly selected and/or adapted to<br>
operatively bind to any marker proteins that may have been<br>
substantially immobilized relative to the protein layer 14 in<br>
the^ positive, result, configuration.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the reagent (not<br>
shown) may preferably comprise a visually tagging substance<br><br>
that, when specifically bound to any marker proteins affixed<br>
to the combinable protein that are immobilized on the protein<br>
layer 14, provides colored indicia indicating and/or<br>
confirming that the test system 70 is in the positive result<br>
configuration- The visually tagging substance (not shown) may<br>
comprise any one or more of a variety of substances, such as,<br>
for example, a radioactive isotope substance, a fluorescent<br>
substance, a DV absorbing substance, and/or a colored<br>
substance. The colored visually tagging substances may<br>
consist of a colloidal carbon conjugate substance, a colloidal<br>
gold conjugate substance, a dyed latex bead substance, and/or<br>
the like-<br>
Preferably, for analytes. in nanogram to femtogram<br>
quantities, amplifications by enzyme conjugates may be<br>
necessary. Situations where amplifications by enzyme<br>
conjugates may be preferable might include, for example, IgE<br>
detection in allergy diagnosis, and/or detection for drug .<br>
abuse, industrial and environmental pollutants, diseases in<br>
plants, hormones, cancer markers, arthritis markers, and/or<br>
the like.<br>
Where these and/or other quantities of analytes are<br>
to be used, the aforesaid reagent may comprise a protein<br>
enzyme conjugate substance (not• shown). As with the other<br>
reagents used according to the invention, the protein enzyme<br>
conjugate substance is particularly selected and/or adapted to<br>
operatively bind to any marker proteins that may have been<br>
substantially immobilized relative to the protein layer 14 in<br>
the positive result configuration.<br>
At that point, an additional drop of the same or a<br>
different wash buffer may then preferably be added to the<br>
active surface area 30 to preferably," but not necessarily,<br>
wash away any unbound material. At this point, the wash buffer<br><br>
may be allowed to adsorb into the protein layer 14.<br><br>
In situations where the aforesaid reagent comprises<br>
a protein enzyme conjugate substance, an enzyme substrate<br>
substance (not shown) may then be preferably added.<br>
Thereafter, the user will wait for a suitable period of time<br>
to elapse, possibly in the order of approximately 10 to 60<br>
seconds, during which period the enzyme substrate substance<br>
will be afforded an opportunity to operatively bind to the<br>
protein enzyme conjugate substance in the positive result<br>
configuration. The protein enzyme conjugate substance and the<br>
enzyme substrate substance are together selected and/or<br>
adapted to operatively display coloured indicia indicating<br>
and/or confirming that the test system 70 is in the positive<br>
result configuration. In this embodiment of the test system<br>
70, an additional drop of wash buffer may preferably then be<br>
added through housing aperture 20, and allowed to traverse<br>
substantially vertically away from its point of entry into the<br>
test system 70 and through the multiple layers of the test<br>
system, as aforesaid, before the results are read.<br>
All materials, possibly including any excess marker<br>
proteins, that do not become immobilized relative to the<br>
protein layer 14 by affixation (e.g., by sticking or binding)<br>
to the combinable proteins that are already immobilized<br>
thereon may preferably, though not necessarily, traverse<br>
through the protein layer 14 to be ultimately captured,<br>
trapped and/or absorbed by the absorbent layer 16.<br>
Additional drops of wash buffer may thereafter be<br>
required and/or preferentially applied to clear the background<br>
of the visible portion 31 of the protein layer 14 so as to<br>
provide more unequivocal test result readings.<br>
To recapitulate, and generally speaking, a liquid<br>
sample analyte (not shown) may preferably be introduced onto<br>
the protein layer 14 through the at least one aperture 24 of<br><br>
the passage layer 12 of the combined testing subassembly. 50.<br>
Whether under the influence of gravity or some other force,<br>
the liquid sample analyte passes through the protein layer 14,<br>
and subsequently into the absorbent layer 16.<br>
After the disposable immunodiagnostic-test system 7-0-<br>
has been used, it may preferably be allowed to dry, after<br>
which it may be disposed of in an ecologically responsible<br>
mode of disposal, such as, for example, by incineration.<br>
It is generally thought, though not essential to the<br>
basic working of the test system 70, that the denser and more<br>
impermeable the passage layer 12, the lower the likelihood of<br>
lateral diffusion of added liquid sample analytes.<br>
When the test system 70 is assembled, with the<br>
housing aperture 24 substantially aligned "B" with the passage<br>
layer 12, the liquid sample analyte is permitted, in use, to<br>
traverse through the test system 70.<br>
Though not essential to the invention, it is<br>
believed that the upper housing portion 10, the layers 12, 14,<br>
16, and/or the lower housing portion 18 of test system 70<br>
should preferably be assembled in intimate contacting relation<br>
with one another, and/or in non-loose fitting relation, so as<br>
to provide the test system 70 with improved integrity. It is<br>
further believed, though not essential to the invention, that<br>
the test system 70 may function effectively so long as the<br>
assembled layers are positioned in sufficient intimate<br>
contacting relation to cause a liquid sample analyte added to<br>
traverse away from its point of entry into the test system 70<br>
and substantially vertically therethrough, under the influence<br>
of gravity and/or another similar force.<br>
It is also generally thought, though not essential<br>
to the basic working of the test system 70, that the intimate<br>
contacting relation of the various layers 10, 12, 14, 16, 18<br><br>
and the use of interstitial and/or peripheral sealing enables<br>
the liquid sample analyte to- traverse- substantially vertically<br>
away from its point of entry, and/or traversing the one or<br>
more of layers 12, 14, 16 of the test system 70, with any<br>
excess being preferably absorbed by the absorbent layer 16.<br>
The substantially contemporaneous testing of a<br>
single liquid sample analyte for the presence of- multiple<br>
marker proteins, using a single test system 70, may offer<br>
significant advantages. These advantages may preferably<br>
include a quicker total administration time, and lower cost of<br>
materials, when compared to the corresponding administration<br>
of four or a like number of separate tests that may otherwise<br>
be required on multiple testing systems, along with<br>
corresponding controls.<br>
Use of the test system 70 will preferably be simple<br>
to use and quick to administer and for provide quick and -<br>
highly accurate and effective test results, without requiring<br>
the purchase of additional specialized equipment' 'nox~~ the- ~<br>
supplemental training of already highly qualified testing<br>
personnel. As aforesaid, its use preferably also enables a<br>
single analyte sample to be tested on a substantially<br>
contemporaneous basis for the presence of any of a plurality<br>
of causative agents. The test system 70 may preferably be<br>
used in a clinical setting, at the point of care, and/or in<br>
the field. In fact, the test system 70 preferably may be<br>
manufactured and/or assembled in the field and/or in a<br>
manufacturing facility that is specifically designed---fox- that<br>
purpose, and as such, it preferably also involves lower<br>
production and packaging costs. The test system 70 is<br>
preferably selectively adaptable to provide qualitative and/or<br>
quantitative results, depending on the user's preferences<br>
and/or the nature of the test to be conducted.<br><br>
In addition to all of the foregoing, the. test system<br>
70 may preferably be readily disposed of in a simple yet<br>
ecologically responsible manner, such as, for example, by<br>
incineration over an open fire. As aforesaid, the test system<br>
70 may preferably be selectively adaptable to detect for<br>
viral, fungal, bacterial, and/or vector induced infections.<br>
Lastly, the test system 70 preferably provides visually<br>
discernable test results and/or results within a relatively<br>
short period of time.<br>
Of course, other modifications and alterations may<br>
be used in design and manufacture of embodiments according to<br>
the disposable immunodiagnostice test system 70 without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For<br>
example, and without limitation, the housing 60 and/or the<br>
various layers 12, 14, 16 of the test system 70 may be<br>
configured in various geometric shapes, such as, for example,<br>
in a square, rectangular, circular, and/or spherical shapes.<br>
Similarly, the test system 70 may be provided with a<br>
plurality of test surface areas (not shown) apart from the<br>
first and second test surface areas 32, 33 which are described<br>
above. In such embodiments, the visible portion 31 of the<br>
active surface . area. .30 ..might _ further „compri.se„ _a.„plurality^ _af	<br>
supplemental test surface areas that may, in combination, also<br>
be configured in various geometric shapes.<br>
In addition, while an upper surfaces of the passage<br>
and protein layers 12, 14 may be shaped so as to define their<br>
respective concave portions 56, 58, the, passage and protein<br>
layers 12, 14 may also each- define respective convex, or such<br>
other-shaped, portions as well.<br>
Furthermore, the labeling indicia 11 may be marked<br>
on the upper housing portion 10 or on the passage layer 12 in<br><br>
a manner that is not restricted to being printed, adhered or<br>
written thereon.<br>
Moreover, while the above description only describes<br>
the presence of one housing aperture 20, multiple respective<br>
housing apertures (not shown) may be present for each test<br>
system 70.<br>
Furthermore, the units of the disposable<br>
immunodiagnostic test system may be arranged in "multiple<br>
packs", or in any such other removably connected or frangible<br>
relation that may be desired by the end user (i.e., other than<br>
in the representative- side-by—side removably-connected<br>
relation format shown in Figures 6 and 7).<br>
Similarly, the disposable immunodiagnostic test<br>
system 70 may be assembled without an upper housing portion<br>
10, and in such embodiments, it would be comprised of at least<br>
the passage layer 12 (possibly with certain labeling indicia<br>
11 marked on its exterior surface), the protein layer 14, the<br>
absorbent layer 16, the lower housing portion 18, and the<br>
housing side portions 36.<br>
Likewise, only the lower housing portion 18 may be<br>
eliminated, such that the disposable immunodiagnostic test<br>
system 70 would then be comprised of at least the upper<br>
housing portion 10, the passage layer 12 (ensuring that the<br>
housing aperture 20 is aligned in substantial vertical<br>
registration with the aperture 24 in the passage layer 12),<br>
the protein layer 14,- the -absorbent-Jlay-ex-J. &amp;,- tand _the -housing<br>
side portions 36.<br>
Moreover, while the~ test~ system 70--may sometimes	<br>
hereinabove have been described as a rapid assay test in a<br>
flow through format, it may instead be constructed in a<br>
lateral flow format as well.<br><br>
The test systems 70 discussed hereinabove are<br>
preferably disposable and cost-effective immunodiagnostic test<br>
systems that are utilizable for detection of one or more<br>
marker proteins in a liquid sample analyte or matrix. As the<br>
present invention may be used to test for multiple marker<br>
proteins in a single test, as may preferably be administered<br>
through the use of a single liquid sample analyte, there is<br>
preferably a reduced wait time before the results might be<br>
obtainable.<br>
While the present invention is contemplated to be<br>
used primarily as an immunodiagnostic system, it may also be<br>
manufactured - - for- . -use	in. — the _ detection	of_ _ various. ^marJcex .<br>
proteins and such other materials as may be present in tissue<br>
culture fluids, plant extracts, seed extracts, soil extracts,<br>
and/or water and other aqueous extracts.<br>
As aforesaid, the disposable immunodiagnostic test<br>
system 70 according to the present invention may preferably be<br>
disposed of in an ecologically responsible and inexpensive<br>
manner, such as, for example, by incineration or burning in an<br>
open fire.	,<br>
The disposable immunodiagnostic test system 70 may<br>
preferably have lower costs of production and disposal<br>
associated with it, in comparison to other analyte testing<br>
devices that may be presently available.<br><br>
