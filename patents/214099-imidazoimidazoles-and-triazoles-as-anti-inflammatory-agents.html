THE PATENT RULES, 2003 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"IMIDAZOIMIDAZOLES AND TRIAZOLES AS ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENTS"<br>
BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of USA, of 900 Ridgebuiy Road, P.O. Box 368, Ridgefield, Connecticut 06877, USA.<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a series of novel small molecules, their synthesis<br>
and their use in the treatment of inflammatory disease.<br>
10      Background of the invention<br>
Research spanning the'last decade has helped to elucidate the molecular events attending cell-cell interactions in the body, especially those events involved in the movement and activation of cells in the immune system. See generally, Springer, T. Nature, 1990, 346, 425-434. Cell surface proteins, and especially the Cellular Adhesion Molecules ("CAMs") 15     and "Leukointegrins", including LFA-1, MAC-1 and gp 150.95 (referred to in WHO nomenclature as CD18/CD1 la, CD18/CD1 lb, and CD18/CDllc, respectively) have correspondingly been the subject of pharmaceutical research and development having as its goal the intervention in the processes of leukocyte extravasation to sites of injury and leukocyte movement to distinct targets. For example, it is presently believed that prior to<br>
20     the leukocyte extravasation, which is a mandatory component of the inflammatory response, activation of integrins constitutively expressed on leukocytes occurs and is followed by a tight ligand/receptor interaction between integrins (e.g., LFA-1) and one or several distinct intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) designated ICAM-1, ICAM-2, ICAM-3 or ICAM-4 which are expressed on blood vessel endothelial cell surfaces and on<br>
25     other leukocytes. The interaction of the CAMs with the Leukointegrins is a vital step in the normal functioning of the immune system. Immune processes such as antigen presentation, T-cell mediated cytotoxicity and leukocyte extravasation all require cellular adhesion mediated by ICAMs interacting with the Leukointegrins. See generally Kishimdto, T. K.; Rothlein; R. R. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994,25, 117-138 and Diamond, M.;<br>
30     Springer, T. Current Biology, 1994, 4, 506-532.<br><br>
A group of individuals has been identified which lack the appropriate expression of<br>
Leukointegrins, a condition termed "Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency" (Anderson, D. C; et<br>
al, Fed. Proc. 1985, 44, 2671-2677 and Anderson, D. C; et al., J. Infect. Dis. 1985,152,<br>
668-689). These individuals are unable to mount a normal inflammatory and/or immune <br>
response(s) due to an inability of their cells to adhere to cellular substrates. These data    <br>
show that immune reactions are mitigated when lymphocytes are unable to adhere in a<br>
normal fashion due to the lack of functional adhesion molecules of the CD 18 family. By <br>
virtue of the fact that LAD patients who lack CD 18 cannotjnount aq inflammatory	<br>
response, it is believed that antagonism of CD 18, CD11/ICAM interactions will also<br>
Tnhibit an inflammatory response.	<br>
It has been demonstrated that the antagonism of the interaction between the CAMs and the Leukointegrins can be realized by agents directed against either component. Specifically, blocking of the CAMs, such as for example ICAM-1, or the Leukointegrins, such as for example LFA-1, by antibodies directed against either or both of these molecules effectively inhibits inflammatory responses. In vitro models of inflammation and immune response inhibited by antibodies to CAMs or Leukointegrins include antigen or mitogen-      i induced lymphocyte proliferation, homotypic aggregation of lymphocytes, T-cell mediated cytolysis and antigen-specific induced tolerance. The relevance of the in vitro studies are supported by in vivo studies with antibodies directed against ICAM-1 or LFA-1. For example, antibodies directed against LFA-1 can prevent thyroid graft rejection and prolong heart allograft survival in mice (Gorski, A.; Immunology Today, 1994,15, 251-255). Of greater significance, antibodies directed against ICAM-1 have shown efficacy in vivo as anti-inflammatory agents in human diseases such as renal allograft rejection and rheumatoid arthritis (Rothlein, R. R.; Scharschmidt, L., in: Adhesion Molecules; Wegner, C. D., Ed.; 1994,1-38, Cosimi, C. B.; etal.,J. Immunol 1990,144,4604-4612 and Kavanaugh, A.; et al, Arthritis Rheum. 1994,37, 992-1004) and antibodies directed against LFA-1 have demonstrated immunosuppressive effects in bone marrow transplantation and in the prevention of early rejection of renal allografts (Fischer, A.; et al, Lancet, 1989,2, 1058-1060 and Le Mauff, B.; et al, Transplantation, 1991, 52, 291-295).<br><br><br><br><br><br>
It has also been demonstrated that a recombinant soluble form of ICAM-1 can act as an inhibitor of the ICAM-1 interaction with LFA-1. Soluble ICAM-1 acts as a direct antagonist of CD18,CD11/ICAM-l interactions on cells and shows inhibitory activity in in 5     vitro models of immune response such as the human mixed lymphocyte response,<br>
cytotoxic T cell responses and T cell proliferation from diabetic patients in response to islet cells (Becker, J. C; et al.t J. Immunol. 1993,151, 7224 and Roep, B. O,; et al, Lancet, 1994,543,1590).<br>
10     Thus, the prior art has demonstrated that large protein molecules which antagonize the binding of the CAMs to the Leukointegnns have therapeutic potential in mitigating inflammatory and immunological responses often associated with the pathogenesis of many autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. However proteins have significant deficiencies as therapeutic agents, including the inability to be delivered orally and<br>
15     potential immunoreactivity which limits the utility of theses molecules for chronic administration. Furthermore, protein-based therapeutics are generally expensive to produce.<br>
Several small molecules have been described in the literature which affect the interaction 20 of CAMs and Leukointegnns. A natural product isolated from the root of Trichilia rubra        was found to be inhibitory in an in vitro cell binding assay (Musza, L. L.; et al,<br>
Tetrahedron, 1994,50, 11369-11378). One series of molecules (Boschelli, D. H.; et al, J. Med. Chem. 1994, 37, 111 and Boschelli, D. H.; et al, J. Med. Chem. 1995,38,4597-4614) was found to be orally active in a reverse passive Arthus reaction, an induced model 25     of inflammation that is characterized by neutrophil accumulation (Chang, Y. H.; et al, Eur. J. Pharmacol 1992,69,155-164). Another series of molecules was also found to be orally active in a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction in rats (Sanfilippo, P. J.; et al, J. Med. Chem. 1995,38, 1057-1059). All of these molecules appear to act nonspecifically, either by inhibiting the transcription of ICAM-1 along with other proteins or act 30     intracellularly to inhibit the activation of the Leukointegnns by an unknown mechanism. None of the molecules directly antagonize the interaction of the CAMs with the<br><br><br>
Leukointeerins. Due to lack of potency, lack of selectivity and lack of a specific mechanism of action, the described small molecules are not likely to be satisfactory for therapeutic use.<br>
5     It follows that small molecules having the similar ability as large protein molecules to directly and selectively antagonize the binding of the CAMs to the Leukointegrins would make preferable therapeutic agents. WO9839303 discloses a class of small molecule 'inhibitors of the interaction of LFA-1 and ICAM-1. W09911258 discloses that the fungal metabolite mevinolin and derivatives bind to LFA-1 and disrupt the interaction of LFA-1 10     and ICAM-1. W09949856 discloses a class of peptidomimetic inhibitors of ICAM binding to LFA-1 and Mac-1.'<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A first aspect of the invention comprises a method for treating or preventing inflammatory __ and immune cell-mediated diseases by the administration of certain novel small molecules. These compounds act by inhibiting the interaction of cellular adhesion molecules, specifically by antagonizing the binding of human intercellular adhesion molecules (including ICAM-1, ICAM-2 and ICAM-3) to the Leukointegrins (especially CD18/CD1 la). A second aspect of the invention comprises novel small molecules having<br>
the above-noted therapeutic activities. A third aspect of the invention comprises methods<br>

desired. If desired, intermediates and products may be purified by chromatography on silica gel and/or recrystallization, and characterized by one or more of the following techniques: NMR, mass spectroscopy and melting point. Starting materials and reagents are either commercially available or may be prepared by one skilled in the art using methods described in the chemical literature.<br>
Intermediates used in the preparation of the compounds of formula I may be prepared by the method described below and outlined in Scheme I. Scheme I<br><br>
An appropriate amino acid (III) is dissolved in aqueous base (such as, for example, NaOH, KOH, Na2CO3, NaHCO3 K2CO3 or KHCO3) and warmed to between about 20 and 90<br>
°C. An appropriate isocyanate (IV) is added to this mixture and the resulting solution is 15     stirred until the reaction essentially reaches completion. Upon cooling, the mixture is acidified and the resulting ureidoacetic acid is isolated by filtration or by extraction into<br><br><br>
WO 01/07440<br><br>
PCT/US00/18884<br><br>
organic solvent. Removal of solvent produces the intermediate ureidoacetic acid. In the manner reported by Sauli (US Patent 4,099,008), the intermediate ureidoacetic acid is cyclized by heating in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid (such as, for example, sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid or hydrochloric acid) in an 5     organic or aqueous solvent, to produce the desired hydantoin (V). Workup consists of collection of the hydantoin by filtration and purification by, for example, silica gel chromatography or recrystallization.<br>
If the thiocarbonyl VII is desired, several reagents are known in the literature which will 10     convert carbonyls to thiocarbonyls. A typical sequence involves heating the substrate with a reagent such as P2S3 in a high boiling solvent such as tetralin for between 1 and 48 h. Isolation of the product follows relatively standard conditions such as the dilution of the mixture into an organic solvent such as EtOAc and washing this mixture with water and saturated aqueous NaCl followed by drying and concentration. Purification is 15     accomplished by silica gel chromatography or recrystallization, to afford VI.<br>
Intermediate VI can be selectively hydrolyzed to the desired monothiocarbonyl compound depending on the choice of conditions. In general the thiocarbonyl at the 4-position of the ring is more susceptible to nucleophilic conditions. It can be converted to the 4-oxo-20     species (VII) by treatment with aqueous ethanolamine followed by acid hydrolysis. Purification is easily performed by silica gel chromatography or recrystallization.<br>
Alternatively, the methyl or ethyl ester of III may be reacted with an aryl thioisocyanate (IV: -NCS instead of-NCO) in a suitable solvent, such as 1,4-dioxane, under an inert 25     atmosphere at about 50-100 °C for about 1 - 24 h to provide VII.<br>
If one uses the racemic III or ester of III, the product (V or VII) is racemic at the asymmetric carbon. By starting with a single enantiomer of III or ester of III, one obtains the single enantiomer of V or VII.<br><br><br>

Description of Biological Properties<br>
The biological properties of representative compounds of the formula I were investigated 5     by way of the experimental protocol described below.<br>
Assay to Determine Inhibition of LFA-1 Binding to ICAM-1<br>
Purpose of Assay: Jo     This assay protocol is designed to study the direct antagonism, by a test compound, of the interaction of the CAM, ICAM-1 with the Leukointegrin CD18/CD1 la (LFA-1).<br>
Description of Assay Protocol:<br>
LFA-1 is immunopurified using the TS2/4 antibody from a 20 g pellet of human JY or 15     SKW3 cells, utilizing a protocol previously described (Dustin, M. J.; et al„ J, Immunol. 1992,148,2654-2660). The LFA-1 is purified from SKW3 lysates by immunoaffinity chromatography on TS2/4 LFA-1 mAb Sepharose and eluted at pH 11.5 in the presence of 2 mM MgCl2 and 1% octylglucoside. After collection and neutralization of fractions from          the TS2/4 column, samples are pooled and precleared with Protein G agarose.<br>
20          A soluble form of ICAM-1 is constructed, expressed, purified and characterized as previously described (Marlin, S.; et al., Nature, 1990,344, 70-72 and see Arruda, A.; et a!., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992,36,1186-1192). Briefly, isoleucine 454 which is located at the putative boundary between domain 5 of the ectodomain and the<br>
25     transmembrane domain, is changed to a stop codon using standard oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. This construction yields a molecule identical with the first 453 amino acids of membrane bound ICAM-1. An expression vector is created with a hamster dihydrofolate reductase gene, a neomycin-resistance marker, and the coding region of the sICAM-1 construct described above, along with the promoter, splice signals, and<br>
polyadenylation signal of the SV40 early region. The recombinant plasmid is transfected into CHO DUX cells using standard calcium phosphate methods. Cells are passaged in<br><br>
WO 01/07440<br><br>
PCT/US00/18884<br><br>
selective media (G418) and colonies secreting sICAM-1 are amplified using methotrexate. sICAM-1 is purified from serum-free media using traditional non-affinity chromatographic techniques, including ion exchange and size exclusion chromatography.<br>
LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1 is monitored by first incubating sICAM-1 at 40 μg/mL in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline with calcium and magnesium, additional 2 mM MgCl2 and 0.1 mM PMSF (Diluting Buffer) in a 96-well plate for 30 min at room<br>
temperature. Plates are then blocked by the addition of 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in<br>
Diluting Buffer for 37 °C for 1 h. Blocking solution is removed from wells, and test compounds are diluted and then added followed by the addition of approximately 25 ng of immunoaffinity purified LFA-1. The LFA-1 is incubated in the presence of test compound<br>
and ICAM-1 at 37 °C for 1 h. Wells are washed 3 times with Diluting Buffer. The bound LFA-1 is detected by the addition of a polyclonal antibody directed against a peptide corresponding to the CD 18 cytoplasmic tail in a 1:100 dilution with Diluting Buffer and<br>
1% BSA and allowed to incubate for 45 min at 37 °C. Wells are washed 3 times with Diluting Buffer and the bound polyclonal antibody is detected by the addition of a 1:4000 dilution of horse radish peroxidase conjugated to goat immunoglobulin directed against<br>
rabbit immunoglobulin. This reagent is allowed to incubate for 20 min at 37 °C, wells are washed as above and the substrate for the horse radish peroxidase is added to each well to develop a quantitative colorimetric signal proportional to the amount of LFA-1 bound to sICAM-1. Soluble ICAM-1 (60 μg/mL) is used as a positive control for inhibition of the LFA-l/ICAM-1 interaction. The lack of the addition of LFA-1 to the binding assay is used as a background control for all samples. A dose-response curve is obtained for all test compounds.<br>
All compounds made in the above examples were tested in this assay and each found to have a Kd

Description ofTherapeutic Use<br>
The novel small molecules of formula I provided by the invention inhibit the ICAM-1/LFA-l dependent homotypic aggregation of human lymphocytes and human lymphocyte adherence to ICAM-1. These compounds have therapeutic utility in the modulation of 5     immune cell activation/proliferation, e.g., as competitive inhibitors of intercellular ligand/receptor binding reactions involving CAMs and Leukointegrins. To be more specific, the compounds of the invention may be used to treat certain inflammatory conditions, including conditions resulting from a response of the non-specific immune system in a mammal (e.g., adult respiratory distress syndrome, shock, oxygen toxicity,<br>
10     multiple organ injury syndrome secondary to septicemia, multiple organ injury syndrome secondary to trauma, reperfusion injury of tissue due to cardiopulmonary bypass, myocardial infarction or use with thrombolysis agents, acute glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, reactive arthritis, dermatosis with acute inflammatory components, stroke, thermal injury, hemodialysis, leukapheresis, ulcerative colitis, necrotizing enterocolitis and granulocyte<br>
15     transfusion associated syndrome) and conditions resulting from a response of the specific immune system in a mammal (e.g., psoriasis, organ/tissue transplant rejection, graft vs. host reactions and autoimmune diseases including Raynaud's syndrome, autoimmune thyroiditis, dermatitis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease including Crohn's disease and ulcerative<br>
20     colitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus). The compounds of the invention may also be used in treating asthma or as an adjunct to minimize toxicity with cytokine therapy in the treatment of cancers. In general these compounds may be employed in the treatment of those diseases currently treatable through steroid therapy.<br>
25     Thus, another aspect of the invention is the provision of a method for the treatment or prophylaxis of the above-described conditions through the adminstration of therapeutic or prophylactic amounts of one or more compounds of the formula I.<br>
In accordance with the method provided by the invention, the novel compounds of formula 30     I may be admimstered for either a prophylactic or therapeutic purpose either alone or with other immunosuppressive or antiinflammatory agents. When provided prophylactically,<br><br>
/O 01/07440                                                                                                     PCTAJSOO/1884<br>
the immunosuppressive compound(s) are provided in advance of any inflammatory response or symptom (for example, prior to, at, or shortly after the time of an organ or tissue transplant but in advance of any symptoms of organ rejection). The prophylactic administration of a compound of the formula I serves to prevent or attenuate any subsequent inflammatory response (such as, for example, rejection of a transplanted organ or tissue, etc.). The therapeutic administration of a compound of the formula I serves to attenuate any actual inflammation (such as, for example, the rejection of a transplanted organ or tissue). Thus, in accordance with the invention, a compound of the formula I can be administered either prior to the onset of inflammation (so as to suppress an anticipated inflammation) or after the initiation of inflammation.                                                                                                               The novel compounds of the formula I may, in accordance with the invention, be administered in single or divided doses by the oral, parenteral or topical routes. A suitable oral dosage for a compound of formula I would be in the range of about 0.1 mg to 10 g per day. In parenteral formulations, a suitable dosage unit may contain from 0.1 to 250 mg of said compounds, whereas for topical administration, formulations containing 0.01 to 1% active ingredient are preferred. It should be understood, however, that the dosage administration from patient to patient will vary and the dosage for any particular patient will depend upon the clinician's judgement, who will use as criteria for fixing a proper dosage the size and condition of the patient as well as the patient's response to the drug.                                                When the compounds of the present invention are to be administered by the oral route, they may be administered as medicaments in the form of pharmaceutical preparations which contain them in association with a compatible pharmaceutical carrier material. Such carrier material can be an inert organic or inorganic carrier material suitable for oral administration. Examples of such carrier materials are water, gelatin, talc, starch, magnesium stearate, gum arabic, vegetable oils, polyalkylene-glycols, petroleum jelly and the like.                 The pharmaceutical preparations can be prepared in a conventional manner and finished dosage forms can be solid dosage forms, for example, tablets, dragees, capsules, and the<br><br>

The pharmaceutical preparations may be subjected to conventional pharmaceutical operations such as sterilization. Further, the pharmaceutical,preparations may contain conventional adjuvants Such as preservatives, stabilizers, emulsifiers, flavor-improvers, wetting agents, buffers, salts for varying the osmotic pressure and the like. Solid carrier material which can be used include, for example, starch, lactose, mannitol, methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, talc, silica, dibasic calcium phosphate, and high molecular weight polymers (such as polyethylene glycol).                                                      For parenteral use, a compound of formula I can be administered in an aqueous or non¬aqueous solution, suspension or emulsion in a pharmaceutically acceptable oil or a mixture of liquids, which may contain bacteriostatic agents, antioxidants, preservatives, buffers or other solutes to render the solution isotonic with the blood, thickening agents, suspending agents or other pharmaceutically acceptable additives. Additives of this type include, for example, tartrate, citrate and acetate buffers, ethanol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, complex formers (such as EDTA), antioxidants (such as sodium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, and ascorbic acid), high molecular weight polymers (such as liquid polyethylene oxides) for viscosity regulation and polyethylene derivatives of sorbitol anhydrides. Preservatives may also be added if necessary, such as benzoic acid, methyl or propyl paraben, benzalkonium chloride and other quaternary ammonium compounds.                                                                                                                                                      The compounds of this invention may also be administered as solutions for nasal application and may contain in addition to the compounds of this invention suitable buffers, tonicity adjusters, microbial preservatives, antioxidants and viscosity-increasing agents in an aqueous vehicle.
