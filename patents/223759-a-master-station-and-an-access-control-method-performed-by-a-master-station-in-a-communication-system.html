				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
MASTER STATION OF COMMUNUICATION SYSTEM AND ACCESS CONTROL METHOD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a roaster station of a<br>
communication system and an access control method, more<br>
particularly, relates to an access control method, which is used<br>
in a plurality of communication systems sharing the same channel,<br>
for preventing interference between the plurality of communication<br>
systems from occurring.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Conventionally, as a technique for reducing interference<br>
between a plurality of communication systems sharing the same<br>
channel, there exists an access control method for reducing the<br>
influence of interference signals by transmission power control.<br>
For example, there exists Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication<br>
No. 2002-198834 (patent document 1), Japanese Laid-Open Patent<br>
Publication No. 2003-37556 (patent document 2), or Japanese<br>
Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2001-53745 (patent document 3).<br>
Patent document 1 discloses a method for attenuating a signal<br>
power and an interference power by an attenuator provided in a<br>
base station, and compensating a power of a wireless signal inputted<br>
to a receiver with a transmis sion power of a transmitter of a terminal<br>
station so that a power level of the wireless signal becomes a<br>
reference level.<br>
Also, patent document 2 discloses a method by which a base<br>
station, which has detected interference signals, notifies<br>
interference information to another base station transmitting the<br>
interference signals via a local communication network for causing<br>
the notified base station to reduce a transmission power based<br>
on the interference information.<br>
Further, patent document 3 discloses the following method.<br>
Firstly, a frequency resource is allocated to a wireless station<br>
from which high priority data is to be transmitted. Also, a timing<br>
and a frame length in use for transmission of the high priority<br>
data are allocated thereto. When the high priority data is<br>
transmitted from an access point (AP) in accordance with the<br>
allocated timing and frame length, the wireless station checks<br>
channel availability by performing physical carrier sense before<br>
transmission, and transmits the high priority data only if channel<br>
availability is verified (i.e., the channel is idle).<br>
However, in the case where the above-described communication<br>
system is a power line communication system, depending on the<br>
configuration of a device connected to a network, an amount of<br>
signal attenuation in one communication system may substantially<br>
exceed an amount of signal attenuation which interferes with the<br>
other communication systems due to the characteristics of a power<br>
line transmission path. That is, in the case where patent document<br>
1 or patent document 2 is applied to the power line communication<br>
system and interference between the communication systems is<br>
performed by power control, there is a possibility that, depending<br>
on the device configuration, some devices may be unable to perform<br>
device communication in the system due to reduced signal intensity.<br>
Also, in the case of wireless communications, the similar<br>
phenomenon, that is, signal intensity is suddenly reduced despite<br>
the physical closeness, may occur due to attenuation of the signal<br>
intensity, which is caused by a shield.<br>
The above-described conventional configuration does not<br>
allow one communication system to maintain the quality of<br>
communications performed therein by transmission power control<br>
while reducing interference with the other communication systems.<br>
Thus, throughput of each communication system is substantially<br>
reduced due to the interference between the communication systems,<br>
and it is difficult to perform communication bandwidth control.<br>
Also, in the case where the control disclosed in patent<br>
document 3 is employed, the interference between the communication<br>
systems can be reduced by virtual carrier or physical carrier sense.<br>
However, it is impossible to assure quality of service (QoS) of<br>
a communication bandwidth.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a master station and an access control method being capable of<br>
easily avoiding interference between communication systems while<br>
assuring QoS of a communication bandwidth of each communication<br>
system without performing transmission power control in a plurality<br>
of communication systems sharing the same channel.<br>
The present invention is directed to a master station used<br>
in a communication system in a system environment in which a<br>
plurality of communication systems, each of which is composed of<br>
at least one slave station and the master station managing the<br>
slave station, shares the same channel. In order to solve the<br>
above problems, the master station of the present invention<br>
includes a communication section, an acquisition section, and a<br>
determination section.<br>
The communication section divides a communication bandwidth<br>
into a beacon period in which all master stations compete for<br>
transmission of a beacon packet, a first carrier sense multiple<br>
access (CSMA) period in which only authorized specific stations<br>
are allowed to compete for access, and a second CSMA period in<br>
which all stations are allowed to compete for access, and repeatedly<br>
communicates on a periodic basis. The acquisition section<br>
acquires a status of use of communication bandwidths in the other<br>
communication systems. The determination section calculates a<br>
communication bandwidth available in the communication system,<br>
to which the master station belongs, in the first CSMA period based<br>
on the status of use of the communication bandwidths acquired by<br>
the acquisition section, and determines whether communication<br>
requested by the slave station is accepted or rejected in accordance<br>
with the calculated communication bandwidth.<br>
Typically, the beacon packet includes system information<br>
providing at least allocated times of the beacon period, the first<br>
CSMA period, and the second CSMA period. The presence or absence<br>
of beacon packet transmission by another master station is checked<br>
after a random back-off process for each cycle of the beacon period.<br>
If the absence is confirmed, the beacon packet is transmitted.<br>
On the other hand, if the presence is confirmed, the beacon packet<br>
is not transmitted.<br>
Also, the acquisition section may acquire a status of use<br>
of communication bandwidths in the other communication systems<br>
by information exchange with the other master stations using the<br>
second CSMA period, or may acquire a status of use of communication<br>
bandwidths in the other communication systems from a beacon packet<br>
received from any of the other master stations in the beacon period.<br>
In this case, it is preferable that a total available<br>
bandwidth is obtained with respect to a communication bandwidth<br>
in the first CSMA period based on CSMA access efficiency and a<br>
retransmission bandwidth, and that an access request from the slave<br>
station is restricted so that the communication bandwidth to be<br>
calculated by the master station does not exceed the total available<br>
bandwidth. Also, each of the authorized specific stations<br>
preferably performs transmission time management in the first CSMA<br>
period so that a transmission bandwidth does not exceed a previously<br>
specified requested bandwidth. Further, an allocated time AT in<br>
the first CSMA period may be calculated using an expression<br>
AT=(STn+M)xa, based on communication bandwidths Tn requested in<br>
the communication systems of the other master stations, a<br>
communication bandwidth M requested in the communication system<br>
to which the master station belongs, and a predetermined<br>
coefficient a.<br>
Also, the beacon packet may include system information<br>
providing at least a start time of the beacon period and a<br>
transmission time of the beacon packet in accordance with a timer<br>
value of the master station transmitting the beacon packet. In<br>
this case, preferably, a transmission time of the beacon packet<br>
is acquired from the received beacon packet, and a timer value<br>
thereof is corrected based on the acquired beacon packet<br>
transmission time. Especially, it is efficient to calculate an<br>
intermediate value between a timer value thereof and the<br>
transmission time of the beacon packet of any of the other master<br>
stations, thereby correcting the timer value to the intermediate<br>
value.<br>
The processes performed by each component of the<br>
above-described master station can be considered as an access<br>
control method providing a series of procedures. This method is<br>
provided in the form of a program causing a computer to execute<br>
the series of procedures. This program may be introduced to the<br>
computer via a computer-readable recording medium. Also, each<br>
component of the above-described master station may be realized<br>
as an LSI, which is an integrated circuit.<br>
As described above, based on the present invention, a<br>
communication bandwidth is divided into the following three<br>
periods: a beacon period, a first CSMA period, and a second CSMA<br>
period, and an allocation for the first CSMA period is determined<br>
based on information about a currently used communication bandwidth<br>
of each communication system. As a result, even if a plurality<br>
of communication systems share the same channel, it is possible<br>
to easily avoid interference between communication systems and<br>
assure QoS of a communication bandwidth of each communication<br>
system without performing transmission power control. Also,<br>
different access modes do not affect each other.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter, with reference to the drawings, embodiments<br>
of the present invention will be described in detail.<br>
FIG. 1 is an illustration showing an exemplary communication<br>
system environment to which the present invention is applied. FIG.<br>
1 shows an exemplary environment including three communication<br>
systems 11 to 13 which interfere with each other. The communication<br>
system 11 includes a master station 111 and a slave station 112,<br>
the communication system 12 includes a mater station 121 and slave<br>
stations 122 and 123, and the communication system 13 includes<br>
a master station 131 and slave stations 132 and 133.<br>
Each of the master stations and slave stations includes,<br>
as shown in FIG. 2, a bandwidth managing section 21, a control<br>
section 22, a data buffer section 23, a frame transmitting section<br>
24, a frame receiving section 25, and a host interface section<br>
26. The bandwidth managing section 21 manages various information<br>
about a communication bandwidth. The control section 22 controls<br>
the entirety of the station. The data buffer section 23 temporarily<br>
stores various packets. The frame transmitting section 24<br>
transmits the packet stored in the data buffer section 23. The<br>
frame receiving section 25 causes the data buffer section 23 to<br>
store a received packet. The host interface section 26 is, for<br>
example, an interface with a host or an interface with another<br>
medium (e.g., communication system) such as a bridge configuration.<br>
The determination section is composed of the bandwidth managing<br>
section 21 and the control section 22. Also, the acquisition<br>
section is composed of the data buffer section 23, the frame<br>
transmitting section 24, and the frame receiving section 25.<br>
Further, a communication section is composed of the control section<br>
22, the frame transmitting section 24, and the frame receiving<br>
section 25.<br>
One of the features of the present invention is that a<br>
communication bandwidth used by the communication systems 11 to<br>
13 is previously divided into the following three periods: a beacon<br>
period, a Controlled-CSMA period, and a Normal-CSMA period, each<br>
of which has a defined role. During a beacon period, all master<br>
stations compete for transmission of a beacon packet. During a<br>
Controlled-CSMA period (first CSMA period), only authorized<br>
specific stations are allowed to compete for access. That is,<br>
the Controlled-CSMA period is a carrier sense multiple access<br>
(CSMA) period to which access restriction is applied. During a<br>
Normal-CSMA period (second CSMA period), all stations are allowed<br>
to compete for access. That is, the Normal-CSMA period is a CSMA<br><br>
period to which no access restriction is applied. These three<br>
periods are periodically repeated (see FIG. 3).<br>
The master stations 111, 121, and 131 manage a beacon period,<br>
a Controlled-CSMA period, and a Normal-CSMA period in accordance<br>
with a timer provided in each control section 22, for example.<br>
Typically, system information indicating an allocated time of each<br>
period is transmitted as information stored in a beacon packet.<br>
Hereinafter, an access control method using the<br>
above-described master and slave stations will be described below.<br>
(first embodiment)<br>
FIG. 4 is a timing chart for describing an access control<br>
method according to a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Note that, in the present embodiment, a case in which start times<br>
of the beacon periods are the same (i.e., start times of the beacon<br>
periods are previously synchronized) will be described. In order<br>
to synchronize start and end times of the beacon periods, a method<br>
which will be described in a third embodiment may be used, for<br>
example. Also, assume that information about a communication<br>
bandwidth used by a communication system is transmitted as<br>
information stored in a beacon packet. FIG. 5 is a flowchart for<br>
describing the access control method (bandwidth managing method)<br>
according to the first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, each of the control sections 22 included<br>
in the respective master stations 111, 121, and 131 performs a<br>
random back-off process within a beacon period for transmitting<br><br>
its own beacon at a start time of the beacon period. The control<br>
sections 22 of the master stations 111, 121, and 131 perform a<br>
random back-off process for transmitting beacon packets 401, 404,<br>
and 407. respectively. When the random back-off process is<br>
completed, each of the control sections 22 of the master stations<br>
111, 121, and 131 performs carrier sense in order to check (i.e.,<br>
check a medium) if another beacon packet is being transmitted from<br>
any of the other master stations, and transmits its own beacon<br>
packet only if another beacon packet is not being transmitted from<br>
any of the other master stations. That is, only a master station<br>
whose random back-off process is first completed can transmit its<br>
own beacon packet.<br>
In the example as shown in FIG. 4, the master station 121,<br>
which completes the random back-off process first, generates the<br>
beacon packet 404 in the data buffer section 23, and transmits<br>
the generated beacon packet 404 using the frame transmitting<br>
section 24. This beacon packet includes, as system information,<br>
a beacon packet transmission time, a start time of a beacon period,<br>
a start time of a Controlled-CSMA period, and a start time of a<br>
Normal-CSMA period, etc., based on the timer. Note that themaster<br>
stations 111 and 131 detecting transmission of the beacon packet<br>
404 by carrier sense stop transmission of the beacon packets 401<br>
and 407, respectively.<br>
When the beacon packet 404 is received from the master station<br>
121 via the frame receiving section 25 (step S501), the master<br><br>
stations 111 and 131 temporarily store the beacon packet 404 in<br>
the data buffer section 23. Each of the control sections 22 of<br>
the master stations 111 and 131 extracts information about a<br>
communication bandwidth used by the communication system 12 from<br>
the stored beacon packet, and stores it in the bandwidth managing<br>
section 21 (step S502). When the new information is stored in<br>
the bandwidth managing section 21, each of the master stations<br>
111 and 131 determines whether or not a new request is generated<br>
in each communication system (step S503). In the case where a<br>
new request is generated, each of the master stations 111 and 131<br>
newly calculates a communication bandwidth available in its own<br>
communication system based on the stored information, and compares<br>
it with the sum of the communication bandwidth currently used by<br>
its own communication system and a communication bandwidth of the<br>
new request (step S504). As a result of the above comparison,<br>
if the sum is smaller than the newly calculated communication<br>
bandwidth, each of the master stations 111 and 131 accepts the<br>
new request (step S505). On the other hand, if the sum is greater<br>
than the newly calculated communication bandwidth, the new request<br>
is rejected (step S506).<br>
Here, a method performed at step S504 for calculating a<br>
communication bandwidth available in one communication system<br>
based on the communication bandwidths used by other communication<br>
systems will be described using a specific example. For example,<br>
in the case where the maximum bandwidth in the Controlled-CSMA<br><br>
period is 30Mbps and the sum of the communication bandwidths used<br>
by other communication systems is 6Mbps, the efficiency of CSMA<br>
is 0.65 and a percentage of a redundant bandwidth (a margin) for<br>
retransmission, for example, is 20% based on the characteristics<br>
as shown in FIG. 6. In this case, the total communication bandwidth<br>
available in the entirety of the communication systems (total<br>
available bandwidth) is 15.6Mbps (-30x0.65x0.8). Thus, a<br>
communication bandwidth available in one communication system is<br>
9.6Mbps (=15.6-6.0). As a result, in this example, a new request<br>
is accepted if a communication bandwidth thereof is equal to or<br>
smaller than 9.6Mbps.<br>
Other than the above-described method utilizing a beacon<br>
period, information about communication bandwidths used by other<br>
communication systems may be acquired by a method utilizing a<br>
Normal-CSMA period. Such a method will be described using FIGS.<br>
7 and 8.<br>
For example, in the case where the slave station 122 has<br>
to assure QoS, the slave station 122 transmits a QoS request packet<br>
611 to the master station 121 included in the same communication<br>
system (step S801). The master station 121, which has received<br>
the packet 611 via the frame receiving section 25, temporarily<br>
stores the received packet 611 in the data buffer section 23. Then,<br>
the control section 22 of the master station 121 transmits status<br>
request packets 612 and 614 to the master stations 111 and 131,<br>
respectively, whose presence in its neighborhood is detected by<br><br>
the beacon packet stored in the data buffer section 23 (step S802).<br>
Specifically, the control section 22 of the master station 121<br>
generates the packets 612 and 614 in the data buffer section 23,<br>
and transmits the generated packets 612 and 614 to the master<br>
stations 111 and 131, respectively, via the frame transmitting<br>
section 24.<br>
Each of the frame receiving sections 25 of the master stations<br>
111 and 131, which have received the packets 612 and 614,<br>
respectively, stores the received packet in the data buffer section<br>
23. Then, the control sections 22 of the master stations 111 and<br>
131 transmit status reply packets 613 and 615 including the<br>
information about the currently-used communication bandwidth<br>
stored in the bandwidth managing section 21 to the master station<br>
121, respectively. Specifically, the control sections 22 of the<br>
master stations 111 and 131 generate the packets 613 and 615,<br>
respectively, in the data buffer section 23, and transmit the<br>
generated packets to the master station 121 via the frame<br>
transmitting section 24.<br>
When the packets 613 and 615 are received from the master<br>
stations 111 and 131, respectively (step S803), the control section<br>
22 of the master station 121 determines whether or not the request<br>
from the slave station 122 is acceptable based on the currently-used<br>
communication bandwidth information included in the packets, the<br>
above-described maximum bandwidth in the Controlled-CSMA period,<br>
and the margin (step S804). Then, based on the determination<br><br>
results, the control section 22 of the master station 121 generates<br>
a QoS reply packet 616 indicating acceptance or rejection of the<br>
request in the data buffer section 23, and transmits it to the<br>
slave station 122 via the frame transmitting section 24 (steps<br>
S805 and S806).<br>
The control section 22 of the slave station 122, which has<br>
received the packet 616 indicating acceptance of the request,<br>
transmits a data packet by a typical CSMA process during a<br>
Controlled-CSMA period. That is, a transmitting station<br>
transmits a data packet after carrier sense, and a receiving station,<br>
which has received the data packet, sends back an acknowledgement<br>
packet. In the case where the transmitting station cannot receive<br>
the acknowledgement packet due to a collision or an error, etc.,<br>
a random back-off process is performed and a data packet is<br>
retransmitted. Specifically, when data such as an IP (Internet<br>
Protocol) packet is stored in the data buffer section 23 via the<br>
host interface section 26, the control section 22 of the slave<br>
station 122 determines whether or not the stored data is QoS data.<br>
In the case where the stored data is QoS data, the control section<br>
22 of the slave station 122 verifies that there is no other data<br>
frame, etc., by carrier sense after performing a random back-off<br>
process during a Controlled- CSMA period, and transmits a data frame<br>
using the frame transmitting section 24. Note that, in the case<br>
where the stored data is not QoS data, the control section 22 of<br>
the slave station 122 performs a similar process during a<br><br>
Normal-CSMA period, and transmits a data frame.<br>
Even if the control section 22 of the slave station 122 has<br>
many pieces of transmission data, the control section 22 restricts<br>
the maximum amount of data transmission in the Controlled-CSMA<br>
period. For example, in the case where a rate is calculated in<br>
system periods, the maximum data transmission amount is restricted<br>
up to 20% greater than the requested bandwidth. Also, as shown<br>
in FIG. 9, a restriction is imposed by setting the maximum<br>
transmission opportunity (TXOP), for example. In the case where<br>
a TXOP is set as shown in FIG. 9, the control section 22 sequentially<br>
transmits a data packet. In this case, control is performed so<br>
that the minimum packet interval is maintained and other stations<br>
cannot perform transmission unless an interval longer than the<br>
minimum packet interval is detected.<br>
Note that the control section 22 may include a typical RTS<br>
(Request To Send) or CTS (Clear To Send) process before transmitting<br>
a data packet, whereby it is possible to solve a hidden terminal<br>
problem. Also, virtual carrier duration information, etc., may<br>
be included in a packet in order to perform virtual carrier sense,<br>
thereby reducing collision frequency. Also, a master station may<br>
transmit a polling packet during a Controlled-CSMA period to set<br>
a TXOP, whereby a slave station transmits a data packet in response<br>
to the polling. It will be understood that a RTS/CTS sequence<br>
may be included. In the case where a data packet, an<br>
acknowledgement packet, or a RTS packet is not sent back in response<br><br>
to the polling, retransmission of a polling packet or polling to<br>
a next station may be performed.<br>
(second embodiment)<br>
In a second embodiment, with reference to FIGS. 10 to 14,<br>
a specific example of a case in which the access control method<br>
described in the first embodiment is applied to a power line<br>
communication system will be described. FIGS. 10 to 14 are<br>
illustrations showing a format of a beacon packet (beacon frame)<br>
used for power line communications for storing allocation<br>
information and announcing the information to the system.<br>
Assume that TINF information included in VF (Variant Field)<br>
inframe control stores information about communication bandwidths<br>
Tl to Tn, which are necessary for assuring QoS and accepted by<br>
a plurality of master stations 1 to n (n is an arbitrary integer),<br>
respectively. Also, as shown in FIG. 14, schedule information<br>
SI included in a data body section of a beacon packet stores<br>
information about an allocated time of a beacon period, an allocated<br>
time AT of a Controlled-CSMA period, and an allocated time of a<br>
Normal-CSMA period. In the present embodiment, assume that a<br>
beacon cycle is 50ms.<br>
The master station 111 receives a beacon packet from other<br>
master stations 121 and 131, and stores the received packet in<br>
the data buffer section 23. The master station 111 analyzes the<br>
beacon packet stored in the data buffer section 23, extracts TINF<br>
information, and stores a set of an address of the master station<br><br>
121 or 131 and the TINF information in the bandwidth managing section<br>
21. In the case where there already exists the TINF information,<br>
update of the information is performed. In the present embodiment,<br>
assume that the TINF information of the master station 121 is 5ms,<br>
and the TINF information of the master station 131 is 8ms. Note<br>
that the TINF information is not updated in the case where a beacon<br>
packet is undetectable due to a collision or an error, etc. Thus,<br>
the control section 22 uses the previously received TINF<br>
information. In this case, it is preferable to set a time period<br>
during which the data is valid.<br>
The master station 111 generates a beacon packet in which<br>
a communication bandwidth M requested by its communication system<br>
is set. Like in this example, in the case where a communication<br>
bandwidth request from the slave station 112 belonging to the same<br>
communication system is not accepted, the communication bandwidth<br>
M is Oms. Thus, the master station 111 generates a beacon packet<br>
in which a communication bandwidth M is set to "0". The master<br>
station 111 determines an allocated time AT of a Controlled-CSMA<br>
period using the TINF information of the master stations 121 and<br>
131 and its own communication bandwidth information. For example,<br>
in the case where a predetermined coefficient a is 1.3, the allocated<br>
time AT of a Controlled-CSMA period is calculated as follows:<br>
(STn+M) xa=(5+8+0)x1.3=16.9ms, and is set as schedule information<br>
SI.<br>
Similarly, each of the master stations 121 and 131 determines<br><br>
an allocated time AT of a Controlled-CSMA period using the TINF<br>
information acquired from other master stations, stores it in the<br>
schedule information SI, and generates a beacon. Note that the<br>
above-described a coefficient and expression are illustrative only,<br>
and other expression may be used in the case where the RTS/CTS<br>
sequence or polling is used, for example.<br>
Next, a sequence in the case where a bandwidth request is<br>
sent from the slave station 112 to the master station 111 will<br>
be described.<br>
Before sending a communication bandwidth request, the<br>
control section 22 of the slave station 112 sends a test pattern<br>
to a communication destination station to check the channel<br>
conditions therebetween, thereby determining a transmission rate.<br>
Specifically, a test pattern is set in the data buffer section<br>
23, and a channel checking frame is transmitted using the frame<br>
transmitting section 24. When the channel checking frame is<br>
received, the frame receiving section 25 of the destination station<br>
determines an optimum modulation scheme and an optimum transmission<br>
rate for the channel based on SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio), etc.<br>
The control section 22 of the communication destination station<br>
generates a channel checking result frame based on the above<br>
determination results in the data buffer section 23, and transmits<br>
it to the slave station 112. When the channel checking result<br>
frame is received, the slave station 112 analyzes the frame, and<br>
acquires the modulation scheme and the transmission rate necessary<br><br>
for the communication.<br>
Assume that the transmission rate is 48Mbps, for example.<br>
In this case, if the slave station 112 has to assure a bandwidth<br>
of 6Mbps, the control section 22 of the slave station 112 generates<br>
a bandwidth request frame including a transmission rate and a<br>
requested bandwidth, and transmits it to the master station 111.<br>
In the case where the transmission rate is smaller than the requested<br>
bandwidth, the bandwidth request frame is not transmitted since<br>
allocation is impossible. In this example, a 6Mbps bandwidth is<br>
requested in the transmission rate 48Mbps. Thus, the bandwidth<br>
is assured if 6.25ms is allocated to each beacon cycle 50ms. Note<br>
that this calculation may be performed by the control section 22<br>
of the master station 111, or may be performed by the control section<br>
22 of the slave station 112 and is notified to the master station<br>
111.<br>
When the bandwidth request frame is received, the master<br>
station 111 stores it in the data buffer section 23. The control<br>
section 22 of the master station 111 re-calculates an allocated<br>
time AT of a Controlled-CSMA period using data in the bandwidth<br>
request frame, and obtains AT=25.025 (=1.3x(5+8+6.25). Assume<br>
that the upper limit of a Controlled-CSMA period is 40ms. In this<br>
case, it is determined that the request is acceptable since the<br>
allocated time AT obtained by the above calculation is smaller<br>
than 40ms. Thus, the control section 22 of the master station<br>
111 generates a request acceptance completion frame, and transmits<br><br>
it to the slave station 112. In the case where the request is<br>
rejected, the control section 22 of the master station 111 transmits<br>
a request rejection frame in a similar manner.<br>
Also, in the case where the request is accepted, the control<br>
section 22 of the master station 111 updates data in the bandwidth<br>
managing section 21, sets the TINF information to 6.25ms, generates<br>
a beacon packet in which the schedule information SI is updated<br>
to 25.025ms, and transmits it periodically. When the beacon packet<br>
is received, the slave station 112 analyzes data of the packet.<br>
The slave station 112 acquires the schedule information SI and<br>
detects a Controlled-CSMA period, thereby transmitting a data frame<br>
requiring bandwidth assurance by using a CSMA process during a<br>
period of 25.025ms stored in the schedule information SI. Note<br>
that a data frame requiring no bandwidth assurance is transmitted<br>
during a Normal-CSMA period.<br>
(third embodiment)<br>
In a third embodiment, a process for synchronizing start<br>
and end times of the beacon periods, the process being usable in<br>
combination with the access control method described in the first<br>
embodiment, will be described. FIG. 15 is a flowchart showing<br>
a procedure of an access control method according to the third<br>
embodiment of the present invention (master station side). FIG.<br>
16 is a flowchart showing a procedure of an access control method<br>
according to the third embodiment of the present invention (slave<br>
station side).<br><br>
Each master station individually determines whether or not<br>
a beacon packet is newly received (step S1501). In the case where<br>
the beacon packet is not received, the master station acquires<br>
a value of its own timer (step S1502). The master station<br>
determines whether or not the acquired timer value reaches a start<br>
time of a beacon period (step S1503). If a start time is not reached,<br>
a process is returned to step S1501. If a start time is reached,<br>
the master station starts a random back-off process (step S1504).<br>
In the case where a beacon packet is received from another<br>
master station in the course of the random back-off process (step<br>
S1505, YES), the master station acquires a value of its own timer<br>
(step S1508). Next, the master station extracts a beacon period<br>
start time from the received beacon packet, and adds a predetermined<br>
offset time (DelayOff set) to this beacon period start time, thereby<br>
obtaining a beacon packet transmission time in another master<br>
station (step S1509). See FIG. 17. Then, the master station<br>
calculates an intermediate value between the obtained beacon packet<br>
transmission time and its own timer value, and sets the timer to<br>
the intermediate value (step S1510). For example, in the case<br>
where a value of a beacon packet transmission time in another master<br>
station is "1200 counts" and its own timer value is "1300 counts" ,<br>
a value of the timer is set to "1250 counts" , which is an intermediate<br>
value therebetween.<br>
On the other hand, in the case where the random back-off<br>
process is completed without receiving a beacon packet from any<br><br>
of the other master stations (step S1506, YES), the master station<br>
generates a beacon packet to which a beacon period start time based<br>
on its own timer and a predetermined offset time are added, and<br>
transmits it to the other master stations (step S1507).<br>
Each master station acquires a start time of a beacon period,<br>
a start time of a Controlled-CSMA period, and a start time of a<br>
Normal-CSMA period, which are included in a beacon packet, and<br>
detects a timing. Note that a start time of a next beacon period<br>
is acquired by adding a SystemPerlod, which is a generation cycle<br>
of a beacon period, to a start time of the beacon period.<br>
When each slave station receives a beacon packet from a master<br>
station of a communication system to which it belongs (step S1601),<br>
the slave station extracts a beacon packet transmission time from<br>
the received beacon packet (step S1602). Then, each slave station<br>
sets a timer value to the extracted beacon packet transmission<br>
time (step S1603).<br>
As such, based on the access control method according to<br>
the present invention, a communication bandwidth is divided into<br>
the following three periods: a beacon period, a Controlled-CSMA<br>
period, and a Normal-CSMA period, and an allocation for the<br>
Controlled-CSMA period is determined based on information about<br>
a currently-used communication bandwidth of each communication<br>
system. As a result, even if a plurality of communication systems<br>
share the same channel, it is possible to easily avoid interference<br>
between communication systems and assure QoS of a communication<br><br>
bandwidth of each communication system without performing<br>
transmission power control. Also, different access modes do not<br>
affect each other.<br>
Also, a timer of each station is corrected based on a beacon<br>
packet transmission time, whereby it is possible to synchronize<br>
the systems with ease. Especially, a system time of each station<br>
is corrected by obtaining an intermediate value between a beacon<br>
packet transmission time of any of the other stations and its own<br>
timer value. Thus, even if there may be a station whose timer<br>
is way out of sync, it is possible to synchronize the systems by<br>
repeatedly performing a process.<br>
Note that each of the above-described embodiments is realized<br>
by a CPU performing interpretation execution for predetermined<br>
program data, which is stored in a storage device (a ROM, a RAM,<br>
and a hard disk, etc.) and is executable of the above-described<br>
procedure. In this case, the program data may be introduced to<br>
the storage device via a recording medium, or may be executed<br>
directly from the recording medium. Note that the recording medium<br>
includes a ROM, a RAM, a semiconductor memory such as a flash memory,<br>
a magnetic disk memory such as a flexible disk and a hard disk,<br>
an optical disk such as a CD-ROM, a DVD, and a BD, a memory card,<br>
or the like. Also, the recording medium is a concept including<br>
a communication medium such as a telephone line and a carrier line.<br>
Also, the entirety or a portion of the functional blocks<br>
composing the master station of the present invention is realized<br><br>
as an LSI (referred to as an IC. a system LSI, a super LSI, or<br>
an ultra LSI, etc., depending on a degree of integration), which<br>
is typically an integrated circuit. Each functional block may<br>
be separately constructed in chip form, or may be constructed in<br>
chip form so that a portion or the entire portion thereof is included.<br>
Also, a method of integration is not limited to LSI, and<br>
may be realized by a dedicated circuit or a general purpose processor.<br>
Also, an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array), which is an LSI<br>
that can be programmed after manufacture, or a reconfigurable<br>
processor enabling connections and settings of the circuit cells<br>
in the LSI to be reconfigurated may be used.<br>
Further, in the case where another integration technology<br>
replacing LSI becomes available due to improvement of a<br>
semiconductor technology or due to the emergence of another<br>
technology derived therefrom, integration of the functional blocks<br>
may be performed using the above new integration technology. For<br>
example, biotechnology may be applied to the above-described<br>
integration.<br>
Hereinafter, an example in which the invention described<br>
in the above-described embodiments is applied to an actual network<br>
system will be described. FIG. 18 is an illustration showing an<br>
exemplary network system in which the present invention is applied<br>
to a high-speed power line transmission. In FIG. 18, a power line<br>
is connected to an IEEE1394 interface and a USB interface, etc.,<br>
provided in a multimedia device such as a personal computer, a<br><br>
DVD recorder, a digital television, and a home server system via<br>
a module having a function of the present invention. As a result,<br>
it is possible to configure a network system being capable of<br>
transmit digital data such as multimedia data at high speed via<br>
a power line. This system increases user-friendliness due to<br>
reduced cost and easy installability since it is possible to use<br>
a power line, which has already been installed in a home and an<br>
office, etc., as a network line without the need for installation<br>
of a network cable required in a conventional cable LAN.<br>
In the above-described configuration, an example in which<br>
an existing device is applied to a power line communication via<br>
an adapter converting a signal interface of the existing multimedia<br>
device to an interface of the power line communication has been<br>
described. However, it will become possible to perform data<br>
transmission between devices via a power cord of a multimedia device<br>
by realizing a multimedia device having a built-in function of<br>
the present invention. As shown in FIG. 18, it eliminates the<br>
need for the adapter, the IEEE1394 cable, and the USB cable, whereby<br>
wiring becomes simplified. Also, it is possible to connect to<br>
the Internet via a router and connect to a wireless/cable LAN using<br>
a hub, etc., whereby a LAN system using the high-speed power line<br>
transmission system of the present invention can be extended. Also.<br>
by a power line transmission method, transmission data flows via<br>
a power line, whereby it is possible to eliminate leakage and<br>
interception of data, which become a problem of a wireless LAN.<br><br>
Thus, the power line transmission method is effective in protecting<br>
data due to improved security. It will be understood that data<br>
transmitted over a power line is protected by an IPSec, which is<br>
an extended IP protocol, encryption of contents, other DRM scheme,<br>
and the like.<br>
As such, it is possible to perform a high-quality power<br>
line transmission of AV contents by realizing a copyright<br>
protection function by the encryption of contents and a QoS function<br>
including an effect of the present invention (improved throughput<br>
and bandwidth allocation responding flexibly to increased<br>
retransmission and traffic fluctuations).<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The control method according to the present invention can<br>
be applied to a case in which a plurality of communication systems<br>
share the same channel, for example. Especially, the control<br>
method is effective in a case, for example, in which interference<br>
between communication systems is easily avoided and QoS of a<br>
communication bandwidth of each communication system is assured<br>
without performing transmission power control.<br>
