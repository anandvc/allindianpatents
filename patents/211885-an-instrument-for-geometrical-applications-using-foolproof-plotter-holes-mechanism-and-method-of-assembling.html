FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention in general relates to the geometrical applications such as drawing lengths, circles, arcs, concentric circles, degrees, angles, and triangles. More particularly this invention relates to geometrical application by the novel idea as foolproof mechanism of plotter holes. That is performing the geometrical applications directly with out doing any measuring activities with a center leg assembly and plotter holes bodies provided with plotter holes. PRIOR ART<br>
The following description explains various prior art technologies and the constraints in the technology. The object of the invention is to over come the impediments in the technology.<br>
Present conventional geometrical instruments in use of the entire world such as (1) Scales for measuring and drawing lengths, (2) Compasses for measuring and drawing arcs cum circles, (3) Protractors for measuring and drawing angles are all made and performed with the conventional practice, to meet out the geometrical applications. That is in the present traditional practice, the geometrical applications are all performed by the use of the above instruments vide two laborious operations in two stages as measuring and drawing. Especially while drawing the circles, arcs, concentric circles, concentric arcs and triangles, it is essential to use two individual instruments as scale and compass separately. Instated a newly invented center leg assembly attached with the respective plotter body and formed as a single instrument that it self will do both the functions of scale and compass as described in the document. They are made with the application of the novel idea as foolproof mechanism of plotter holes and that perform the geometrical applications in a single operation with out doing any measuring activities. The foolproof mechanism of plotter holes is an entirely new mechanism of applications for making such new instruments and not at all in practice of the entire world. Hence, there is no exact prior art for this new invention. However, since the new invention replaces all the present conventional geometrical instruments such as scales, compasses and protractors, the same are taken as the prior art for our new invention.<br><br>

Millions of people all over the world in all the fields like education and industries are using the present conventional geometrical instruments such as scales, compasses and protractors for measuring and drawing the lengths, circles- arcs-concentric circles-triangles, degrees and angles respectively towards meeting their geometrical applications. While using these conventional instruments the users are experiencing uncomfortable and - consuming more time with minimum efficiency to meet out their geometrical requirements. Especially the studying kids and children are feeling more strain and laborious while using these instruments and they are not expressing the above problems to others. The reason may be, that the users are all in the opinion that the existing scales, compasses and protractors are all attained their final form and there is no scope for further invention on these instruments.

The novel idea of foolproof mechanism of plotter holes for making new instruments in order to perform the geometrical applications with out doing measuring activities as follows.<br>
'As per the present conventional practice with the existing geometrical instruments, it is essential to do measuring activity separately by using the scale or protractor, prior to drawing the lines circles, arcs, and angles etc., instead, by not doing any measuring activity the same may be drawn for the major measurements, directly through the small plotter holes, those are provided in the body of the instrument itself with suitable size, shape, location, degrees and with complete foolproof mechanism. Another foolproof mechanism may be also provided in the instrument, to get the required additional or fractional or extended measurement to all the above said major measurements for drawing the same very easily, very quickly, very accurately and without any strain."<br>
One (common) center leg assembly and different configuration of plotter bodies as A, B, C, D, E, F, G&amp; H are made by the application of the above novel idea as foolproof mechanism of plotter holes in order to perform the geometrical applications with out doing measuring activities. The newly invented center leg assembly and different configuration of plotter bodies A, B, C, D, E, F, G &amp;H as shown in figures 1 to 8 all are made by the application of the above said novel idea as 'foolproof mechanism of plotter holes' are submitted for grant of patent. The new instruments are all made to draw the lines, circles cum arcs, concentric circles, triangles, degrees and angles by performing with out doing measuring activities. Especially while using the newly formed instrument in order to draw circles cum arcs, concentric circles and triangles there is no need to perform two individual operations separately with two individual instruments as scale and compass. That is not like the conventional method of measuring the dimensions as one operation by the use of scale and drawing the circle or arc as another operation by the use of compass individually. Instead, the geometrical applications are done directly through the plotter holes provided in the newly formed instruments very easily and quickly with out spending time and effort for measuring activities.<br>
The circular plotter holes provided in the instruments could be also made as rectangular or triangular or any suitable shape, and the size depends upon the plotter (marker) that is<br><br>
to be preferred like pen or pencil or ballpoint pen or micro tips or metallic pin or sketch pen or any other marking, drawing and cutting tools. The instruments could be made for FPS (measurement graduations in inches) system also.<br>
The invention is described in the following pages and the salient future of the instrument is described fully and completely.<br>
The center leg assembly is the prime and common one vertical unit. The same is integrated with replaceable second horizontal portions and formed as new instruments. The horizontal portions are named as plotter bodies acting as plotting tool. They are all made with plotter holes and foolproof mechanism. The plotter holes are provided in the plotter bodies it self by a novel idea. By connecting the single vertical portion of center leg assembly (and by changing the second horizontal portions for the required applications with the same leg assembly) with second horizontal portion of plotter bodies and formed complete new instruments for the respective geometrical applications. Depends upon the application and required accuracy level, anyone of the plotter bodies of the different configurations is selected and attached with the center leg assembly. Performing the geometrical applications with the newly formed instruments will completely eliminate the measuring activities and the efforts spending prior to drawing or drafting the lines, circles cum arcs and concentric circles cum arcs, triangles and angles. That is to meet out the geometrical applications directly with out doing any measuring activities. The new and novel features are not at all available in any other instrument of the entire world.<br>
Refer figure l.The parts of the newly invented (common) central leg assembly (1) are made-up of metallic, non-metallic, or plastic materials. The center leg assembly (1) comprising a sleeve and a spring loaded center metallic needle or pointer (4). The sleeve (part no.9) is a hollow tube of strong material. The bottom of the sleeve is closed, and has a small opening at its center provided with metallic internal threading to screwed the sleeve with the matching part as metallic guide (3). The metallic guide is also one of the parts of the respective plotter bodies. The center metallic needle (4) or metallic pointer is<br><br>
inserted through a metallic helical spring (7). Both are inserted in the exact center of the sleeve (9) and a screw cap (10) is screwed to close the sleeve at the top also. The cap also has a small opening at its center. The top end of the metallic needle is inserted rigidly in to a metallic or non-metallic stump (8) and the stump is passes through the center opening of the screwed cap and connected with a press button (13). Thereby the center metallic leg inserted in to the helical spring is fully covered. This metallic needle becomes the center leg of the complete instrument formed, after connected with the respective plotter bodies. The metallic guide (3) is the connecting part of the respective plotter bodies and respective slide housings. The connecting end of the metallic guide has external threading to screw with the bottom of the sleeve of center leg assembly. The center metallic leg pointer passes through its center also. The center metallic leg pointer inside the sleeve could move up and down in Z-axis vertically, by pressing the press button and releasing the same from the top due to spring action. The center leg assembly is connected with the plotter body (2) by a slide mechanism. The plotter (2) body is a small strip made-up of any strong and slightly flexible material such as metallic, non-metallic, or plastic strip. The center leg assembly (1), slide (6) and slide housing (5) are all connected by the metallic guide (3) and formed as a complete single instrument for drawing or drafting the arcing and circling applications. The plotter body-A (2) is connected to the slide housing rigidly by a screw and the same is easily detachable or attachable. The slide housing and slide are made-up of metallic, nonmetallic, or plastic material. Part no  11 &amp; 12 are metal washer, and rubber washer respectively. This formation of new instrument by the novel idea is working with two different ftmctions. FIRST FUNCTION: The plotter holes are provided for the major measurements on the entire length of the plotter body. That is the plotter holes are provided in the strip itself with an exact distance of 0.5 centimeters pitch to each other (pitch), from the 0 position (from the center leg of instrument at its 0 position) to +x direction in X axis with complete   foolproof   mechanism   to   get   the   required   major   measurements   as 5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45 millimeters and so on. The drawing and drafting tools like pencil or ballpoint pen or micro tip pen or micro tip pencil etc., may be directly inserted through these plotter holes, and drawing or drafting of the circles cum arcs and concentric circles cum arcs are done directly in a single setting it self, very easily, very quickly, very<br><br>
accurately and without any parallax error to the respective all major measurements by not<br>
doing any measuring activity. Due to the very easy arrangement of plotter holes any type<br>
of drawing, drafting, and cutting tools (like pencil or ballpoint pen, micro tip pen or<br>
micro tip pencil, sketch pen and needle cutters for papers and rappers etc.,) may be used<br>
by changing them very easily and very quickly with the same instrument. The plotter<br>
holes are made with more accuracy and coated with metallic or non-metallic beading for<br>
the easy  access  of any  type of drawing or drafting or cutting  tools.  SECOND<br>
FUNCTION: Another foolproof mechanism that is a slide mechanism is also provided in<br>
the instrument, to move the center metallic leg of the instrument from 0 position, to a<br>
maximum travel length equal to the pitch of the major plotter holes of the plotter body for<br>
the required additional measurement to -X direction in the same axis. That is as the<br>
extension measurement to all the above major measurements of respective plotter holes,<br>
the minor measurements of 0.5,1,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5,4,4.5 and 5 millimeters may be also<br>
added. In addition, the required fractional increment of measurement between all the<br>
minor measurements may be also added, to the highest accuracy. The slide mechanism is<br>
made in such a way as to move the whole center leg assembly as to and fro (left and<br>
right) movement from 0 position to -X direction in the same axis to the travel length<br>
equal to the pitch of the major plotter holes of the plotter body. That is due to the<br>
movement of slide in Y axis (top and bottom) in a prefixed Y: X ratio, the center of the<br>
metallic leg pointer fixed in to the center of the leg assembly is moved along with center<br>
leg assembly horizontally in X axis to the required fraction of centimeter. A locking<br>
mechanism is also provided in the assembly to fix the center leg assembly rigidly at the<br>
required fractional measurement position .The slide may be also made by changing the Y:<br>
X ratio conveniently, so that the travel length of slide may be also altered, thereby the<br>
required accuracy level may be increased.<br>
Refer figure 2. The center leg assembly is attached with a plotter body-B (2) and dial &amp; screw assembly mechanism and formed as a complete single instrument for further more accuracy. Wherein, instead of the slide mechanism, a dial&amp;screw assembly mechanism is provided. In this, the metallic guide (3) is connected with a horizontal metallic screw (3A), and the screw is run through a metallic or non-metallic dial (6) which has the<br><br>
metallic internal threading at it center. Due to this mechanism the rotational movement of the dial over the screw makes the horizontal movement of the center leg assembly to -X direction from its 0 position in the same axis to a maximum travel length equal to the pitch of the major plotter holes of the plotter body. Since the pitch of the screw and internal threading of dial is preferred as 1 millimeter, for every one complete rotation of the dial the center point along with center leg assembly is moved horizontally to 1 millimeter very accurately in -X direction in the same axis. For the required fractional horizontal movement of the leg assembly the dial is further subdivided in to the required equal parts for the required partial rotation of the dial. The pitch of screw and dial may be made with more then 1 millimeter resulting, the total no of full rotation of the dial may be also reduced for the horizontal travel of the leg assembly for the same travel length equal to the pitch of the major plotter holes of the plotter boy. The connecting end of the plotter body is provided with a small slotted hole for the easy movement of center metallic pointer without any interference. This detachable plotter body-B attached with slide housing by a small screw for rigid fixing of the same as said earlier or suitable connection mechanism could be also provided.<br>
The new and novel idea of the slide mechanism and screw assembly mechanism is for the foolproof, accurate, smooth, and quick movement of the center metallic leg to the required location of the fractional measurement. That is to shift the whole center leg assembly in order to locate the metallic center leg pointer to the required fractional measurement, very accurately, very easily, and very quickly. The instrument may be made with other mechanism like gear assembly or lever assembly or cam assembly or eccentric circle assembly mechanism or any other mechanism in order to extend the major plotter holes measurements to the required fractional measurements as the additional measurement.<br>
The new formation of instrument with (common) center leg assembly connected with plotter bodies, wherein unlike the conventional compasses, where the two arms of the compass i.e. the center pointer leg and the drawing tools holder leg are hinged at the top end. During operation, the legs will open and close like an elbow depends upon the increased or decreased measurement, but in the above formation of new instrument, only<br><br>
one center leg assembly is available. There is no second leg at all. The drawing or drafting tools like pencil or ballpoint pen or micro tip pen or micro tip pencil etc may be directly inserted in to the plotter holes and during operation, the center leg, and drawing tool (Inserted in to any of the plotter hole) are vertical and parallel, that is independent to the center metallic pointer and working freely in to the plotter holes with running fit and there is no necessity to attach them rigidly with the instrument .So that higher length of applications is very easy without any additional attachments and eliminate laborious measuring activity. The center leg of the instrument where in the entire center metallic leg is fully covered throughout its length by a sleeve (9), also spring (7) loaded and has movement in Z axis vertically. Another very important feature is, the center metallic leg of the instrument could move horizontally towards -X direction in the same axis from 0 position to the required fractional measurement also, as the extension measurement to all the major measurements with foolproof mechanism. All these arrangements for the respective purpose are completely novel and that are, not at all available in any of the conventional instrument and prior art.<br>
Refer figure 3. The center leg assembly (1) is attached through a metallic guide with the plotter body-C (3) and slide housing (5) and forms a complete single instrument. Wherein the horizontal movement of the leg assembly towards -x direction from its 0 position in X-axis to a maximum travel of 5 mm is done directly.<br>
Refer figure 4. The center leg assembly (1) is attached through a metallic guide (3) with a plotter body-D (2) and a slide housing (5) and forms a complete single instrument. Wherein the horizontal movement of center leg assembly is avoided and fixed the same at the center it self, at 0 position. Here the plotter body is moved towards +x direction from its 0 position in x axis to a maximum travel of 5mm. For this purpose, the connecting end of plotter body-D is provided with a small metallic fork. That slides in to the slide housing horizontally to the maximum travel of 5mm.<br>
Refer figure 5. The center leg assembly (1) is attached through a metallic guide (3) with a plotter body-E (3) and a slide housing (5) and forms a complete single instrument.<br><br>
Wherein the horizontal movement of center leg assembly is avoided and fixed at the center it self at 0 position. Here the entire length of plotter body-E it self is moved horizontally, so that, the only one plotter hole provided in the body is moved away from the center of center leg assembly or towards to the same and fixed at required position. The plotter body is marked with the required dimensions.<br>
Refer figure 6. The newly invented instrument, where in plotter holes are provided in a metallic or non-metallic or plastic body. Major dimensional plotter holes are provided from 0 position towards + x direction for 10, 20,30,40,50 mm and so on. Minor dimensions plotter holes are provided from 0 position towards - x direction for 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9 mm, those are for the extended dimensions of respective major dimensions. Center leg assembly (1) is directly inserted through these minor dimensional plotter holes of the plotter body-F (3) and through major dimensional plotter holes, the arcs and circles are drawn. By increasing the plotter holes suitably, further more fractional dimensions could be also possible.<br>
Refer figure 7. The center leg assembly is attached with a plotter body-G (2) by metallic guide (4) and forms a complete single instrument' for drawing lines, arcs and circles. From the center of the metallic pointer (2), plotter holes are provided with respect to all the individual dimensions (distance) starting from 5mm to 150 mm. The plotter holes are arranged in a novel and systematic manner in order to identify them for the required dimensional plotter hole very easily. Through them, the required dimensions are drawn directly with out any parallax error and with out doing any laborious measuring activities, resulting increased efficiency and timesaving. By increasing the plotter holes suitably, further more fractional dimensions could be also possible<br>
Refer figure 8. The center leg assembly (1) is attached with a plotter body-H (2) by a metallic guide at its center and formed a complete single instrument for marking degrees and drawing angles. Wherein the marking degrees for drawing angles is done directly through the plotter holes of the new instrument by not doing any measuring activity and without parallax error. That is unlike by measuring the same with the conventional<br><br>
protractors with parallax error, resulting increased efficiency, and time saving. In this plotter body, plotter holes are provided in a metallic, non-metallic, or plastic body. Major degrees plotter holes H-0 are provided for 0,10,20,30,40,50 degrees up to 360 degrees in the outer orbit as one set and other major degrees plotters holes H-I are provided for 5,15,25,35,45,55 degrees up to 355 degrees in the inner orbit as another set. Minor plotter holes M-L &amp; M-R are provided in the left and right ends, for 0.5,1,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5,4 and 4.5 degrees from the 0 degree and 180 degrees positions for clockwise and anticlockwise applications those are all for the extended degrees of respective all major degrees. Through them, the required fractional degrees for every increase of 0.5 degrees to the maximum of 5 degree in addition to major degrees are marked directly with maximum accuracy and without any parallax error and by not doing any laborious measuring activity, resulting increased efficiency and time saving. The plotter body for circling and plotter body for degrees may be also integrated for the circular and angular applications as a single plotter body and the same may be connected with the newly invented common center leg assembly. That is plotter holes for drawing circles, plotter holes for drawing angles are all could be made in a single plotter body, and the same may be connected with the common center leg assembly<br>
