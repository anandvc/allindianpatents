				<td>The present invention relates to liquid crystal display apparatus, and in particular to liquid crystal display apparatus wherein a flexible printed circuit board with a pattern formed on one surface is bent approximately at the center in two thus configuring a first pattern surface and a second pattern surface at the rear of the first pattern surface.<br>
Portable terminal apparatus such as a portable telephone set and a PHS (Personal Handy phone System) terminal is getting more compact and lightweight year by year. Recently, a low-profile design and a large liquid crystal display have been key points for marketability of a product.<br>
A plastic casing of liquid crystal display apparatus instead of a conventional glass casing has been contributed to a lightweight and low-profile design.<br>
The plastic liquid crystal display apparatus, however, cannot accept the thermal crimping method at joints; thus the liquid crystal display apparatus cannot use flexible printed circuit boards {flexible boards) via the TAB (Tape Attach Bonding) method employed for a conventional glass liquid crystal display apparatus.<br>
As the number of displayed characters increases, the number of joints with the main printed circuit board increases .<br><br>
This allows jointing via the thermal crimping method by using a COF {Chip On Film) flexible printed circuit board and reduces the number of joint poles with the main printed circuit board.<br>
Fig. 4 is a side sectional view of conventional liquid crystal display apparatus assembled to configure a unit.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, liquid crystal display apparatus having a flexible board (for example a COF flexible board) 31 is assembled so as to be wrapped by a holding member 32 to-form a unit. In the unit, contacts 33 provided on the flexible board 31 come in contact with connectors 35 provided on a printed circuit board 34.<br>
Fig. 5 is a perspective plan view of conventional liquid crystal display apparatus. The liquid crystal display (LCD) portion is arranged below the apparatus shown In Fig. 5. Referring to Fig. 5, the liquid crystal display apparatus is composed of a liquid crystal display device (LCD) 36 and a flexible board 31 such as a COF flexible board. The flexible board 31 such as a COF flexible board is provided with positioning holes 39 and mounts contacts 33 to make contact with connectors 35 on the printed circuit board and associated parts 40 related to liquid crystal display operation.<br>
Fig. 6 is a side sectional view of another conventional liquid crystal display apparatus assembled to configure a unit.<br>
Referring to Fig. 6, liquid crystal display apparatus having a TAB 41 is assembled so as to be wrapped by a holding<br><br>
member to form a unit. In the unit, associated parts provided on the TAB 41 are attached to the TAB 41 via bonding.<br>
Fig. 7 is a front sectional view of conventional liquid crystal display apparatus shown in Fig. 4 assembled to configure a unit.<br>

As shown in Fig. 5, in case the contact method is used for jointing with the main printed circuit board, there is a problem that the chip-mounted surface of the flexible printed circuit board mates oppositely with the contacts on the main printed circuit board, from the viewpoint of the design of the main unit.<br>
The COF flexible printed circuit board uses a single-sided pattern. Thus there is a problem that the chip-mounted surface of the flexible printed circuit board mates oppositely with the contacts on the main printed circuit board.<br>
