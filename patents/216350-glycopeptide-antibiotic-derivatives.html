FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The field of the invention relates to novel glycopeptide antibiotic derivatives,processes for their<br>
preparation, their use as a medicine, their use to treat or prevent viral infections and tneir use to<br>
manufacture a medicine to treat or prevent viral infections. The present invention relates to the<br>
use of glycopeptide antibiotics and their semisynthetic derivatives to treat or prevent viral<br>
infections and their use to manufacture a medicine to treat or prevent viral infections of<br>
subjects, more in particular infections with viruses belonging to Retroviridae (i.e. Lentivirinae),<br>
Herpes viridae, Flaviviridae and the Coronaviridae, like HIV (human immunodeficiency virus),<br>
HCV (hepatitis C virus), BVDV (bovine viral diarrhoea virus), SARS (severe acute respiratory<br>
syndrome) causing virus, FCV (feline coronavirus), HSV (herpes simplex virus), VZV<br>
(varicella zoster virus) and CMV (cytomegalovirus).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Viral infections remain a major medical problem worldwide because of a lack of therapy,<br>
prevention or vaccination strategy and because of the rapid development of resistance. Viruses<br>
can be devided into two big groups, RNA-viruses and DNA-viruses, according to their genetic<br>
composition, which can then further be subdivided. Human pathogens include Adenovirus,<br>
Cytomegalovirus, Dengue virus, Ebola virus, Enterovirus, Epstein Bar Virus, Hantavirus,<br>
Hepatitis A virus, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, Herpes Simplex virus, Human Herpes<br>
Virus 8, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Human Metapneumovirus, Human Papilloma Virus,<br>
Influenza virus, La Crosse Virus, Marburg virus, Nipah virus, Parvovirus B19, Polyoma BK<br>
virus, Polyoma JC virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Variola, Coxsackie virus and others.<br>
HIV- I (human immunodeficiency virus -1) is one of these problematic viral infections with an<br>
estimated 40 million people infected worldwide. There are several strains of HIV. The two<br>
main ones are HIV-1 and HIV-2, the latter one producing a less severe disease than the first<br>
one. The number of cases of HIV and AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) has risen<br>
rapidly. In 1999, 5.6 million new infections were reported, and 2.6 million people died from<br>
AIDS. Currently available drugs for the treatment of HIV include nucleoside reverse<br>
transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (i.e.zidovudine, didanosine, stavudine, lamivudine, zalcitabine<br>
and abacavir), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (i.e. nevirapine, delavirdine and<br>
efavirenz), peptidomimetic protease inhibitors (i.e. saquinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir,<br>
amprenavir and lopinavir) and the entry inhibitor enfuvirtide. A relatively new target that is<br>
focussed on lately is the integrase enzyme of HIV, while also many other proteins acting as<br>
enzymes or co-factors are being investigated. Each of the currently available drugs can only<br>
transiently restrain viral replication if used alone. However, when used in combination, these<br>
drugs have a profound effect on viremia and disease progression. In fact, significant reductions<br>
in death rates among AIDS patients have been recently documented as a consequence of the<br>
widespread application of combination therapy. However, despite these impressive results, 30<br>
to 50% of patients ultimately fail combination drug therapies. Insufficient drug potency,<br>
noncompliance, restricted tissue penetration and drug-specific limitations within certain cell<br>
types (e.g. some nucleoside analogs cannot be efficiently phosphorylated in resting cells) may<br>
account for the incomplete suppression of sensitive viruses. Furthermore, the high replication<br>
rate and rapid turnover of HIV-1 combined with the frequent incorporation of mutations, leads<br>
to the appearance of drug-resistant variants and treatment failures when sub-optimal drug<br>
concentrations are present.<br>
Many other virusses and virus families causing problematic disorders can be identified. The<br>
family of the Flaviviridae for example consists of 3 genera, the pestiviruses, the flaviviruses<br>
(i.e. Dengue virus) and the hepaciviruses (also containing the hepatitis G virus (HGV/GBV-C)<br>
that has not yet been assigned to a genus) which can be responsible for severe diseases.<br>
Pestiviruses such as the Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV), the Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus<br>
(BVDV) and the Border Disease Virus (BDV) cause infections of domestic livestock<br>
(respectively pigs, cattle and sheep) and are responsible for significant economic losses worldwide. <br>
BVDV, the prototypic representative of the pestivirus genus is ubiquitous and causes a<br>
range of clinical manifestations, including abortion, teratogenesis, respiratory problems, chronic<br>
wasting disease, immune system dysfunction, and predisposition to secondary viral and<br>
bacterial infections and may also cause acute fatal disease. Foetuses of cattle can be infected<br>
persistently with BVDV, these animals remain viremic throughout life and serve as continuous<br>
sources for virus spread in herds. Vaccines are used in some countries with varying degrees of<br>
success to control pestivirus disease (Leyssen P, et al., Clin Microbiol Rev. 2000 Jan;13(l):67-<br>
82).<br>
The World Health Organization estimates that world-wide 170 million people (3% of the<br>
world"s population) are chronically infected with HCV (Leyssen P, et al., Clin Microbiol Rev.<br>
2000 Jan;13(l):67-82). These chronic carriers are at risk of developing cirrhosis and/or liver<br>
cancer. In studies with a 10 to 20 year follow-up, cirrhosis developed in 20 - 30 % of the<br>
patients, 1 to 5% of whom may develop liver cancer during the next ten years (Dutta et al,<br>
Hum. Pathol. 1998 Nov,29(11): 1279-84). The only treatment option available today is the use<br>
of interferon a-2 (or its pegylated from) either alone or combined with ribavirin. However,<br>
sustained response is only observed in about 40% of the patients and treatment is associated<br>
with serious adverse effects (reviewed in Leyssen et al., 2000). There is thus an urgent need for<br>
potent and selective inhibitors of the replication of HCV in order to treat infections with HCV.<br>
Furthermore, the study of specific inhibitors of HCV replication has been hampered by the fact<br>
that it is not possible to propagate HCV (efficiently) in cell culture. Since HCV and pestiviruses<br>
belong to the same virus family and share many similarities (organisation of the genome,<br>
analogous gene products and replication cycle), pestiviruses have been adopted as a model and<br>
surrogate for HCV. For example BVDV is closely related to hepatitis C virus (HCV) and used<br>
as a surrogate virus in drug development for HCV infection (Zitzmann N. et al0, Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA, 96, 11878-11882 and Bukhtiyarova,-M et al., Antiviral Chem. Chemother.<br>
2001 Nor, 12(6): 367-73).One compound VP32947 or (3-[((2-dipropylamino)ethyl)thio]-5H-<br>
l,2,4-triazino[5,6-b]indole has been reported to selectively inhibit the replication of BVDV and<br>
other pestiviruses (Baginski SG et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000 Jul 5;97(14):7981-6).<br>
Currently, there is no treatment strategy available for controlling infections caused by<br>
pestiviruses.<br>
The genus of the Flavivirusses comprises the pathogens Dengue virus, Yellow Fever virus and<br>
the West Nile virus which are causing major health problems woriwide (Asia, Africa, America)<br>
and for which currently no therapy is available.<br>
The family of the Herpesviridae includes important human pathogens like Herpes simplex virus<br>
(HSV) type 1 and 2, Herpes Zoster virus (VZV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein Bar virus<br>
(EBV) and human Herpes virus type 6 and 8 (i.e. HHV- 6 and -8). These viruses cause<br>
disorders like Herpes Labialis, Herpes Genitalis, Herpes Encephalitis, Kaposi-sarcoma,<br>
Varicella, Zona, lymfomas and others. Current treatments consist of Vidarabine, Acyclovir,<br>
Gancyclovir, Brivudin, Cidofovir and some other products.<br>
Coronaviridae now approximately comprises 15 species, which infect not only man but also<br>
cattle, pigs, rodents, cats, dogs and birds (some are serious veterinary pathogens, especially<br>
chickens and cats). Coronavirus infection is very common and occurs worldwide. The incidence<br>
of infection is strongly seasonal, with the greatest incidence in children in winter. In humans,<br>
they cause respiratory infections (including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS),<br>
enteric infections and rarely neurological syndromes. SARS is a form of viral pneumonia where<br>
infection encompasses the lower respiratory tract. The true cause appears to be a novel<br>
coronavirus with some unusual properties. The SARS virus can be grown in Vero cells, a novel<br>
property for Human Coronavirusses, most of which cannot be cultivated. In these cells, virus<br>
infection results in a cytopathic effect, and budding of coronavirus-like particles from the<br>
endoplasmic reticulum within infected cells ( Zhang et al, Acta Bioch. Bioph. Sinica 2003, 35,<br>
587-591). There is currently no antiviral drug available that has been shown to be consistently<br>
successful in treating SARS or any coronavirus infection, nor is there any vaccine against<br>
SARS.<br>
As a conclusion, for many pathogenic viral infections, no efficient treatment is currently<br>
available and moreover, the available anti-viral therapies or preventive measures are not<br>
sufficient in order to able to cure, prevent or ameliorate the respective viral infections due to<br>
many reasons, like the occurence of resistance and unfavorable pharmacokinetic or safety<br>
profiles.<br>
Therefore, there is still a stringent need in the art for potent inhibitors of viruses, such as HIV,<br>
HCV, SARS-causing virus, CMV, Herpes virusses, etc. Therefore a goal of the present<br>
invention is to satisfy this urgent need by identifying efficient and non-harmful<br>
pharmaceutically active ingredients and combination of ingredients for the treatment of viral<br>
infections in mammals and in humans. In the case of HIV for example, there is still a need for<br>
compounds which either complement existing drugs such that the resulting cocktail has<br>
improved drug resistance suppression or compounds which are themselves effective against a<br>
virus, including many or all viable mutations of a virus.<br>
The glycopeptide, or vancomycin, class of antibiotics consists of compounds of relatively high <br>
molecular weight. Structurally, they comprise a polypeptide core aglycone structure having<br>
phenolic amino acids and one or more peripheral carbohydrate moieties (Williams et al., Topics<br>
in Antibiotic Chemistry, Volume 5, pages 119-158). Known members of this class include<br>
vancomycin (McCormick et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,067,099), ristocetin (Philip et al., U.S. Pat. No.<br>
2,990,329), A35512 (Michel et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,083,964), avoparcin (Kunstmann et al., U.S.<br>
Pat No. 3,338,786) teicoplanin (Bardone et al., J. Antibiot, Volume 31, page 170, 1978),<br>
actaplanin (Raun, U.S. Pat. No. 3,816,618), AAD-216 (Bowie et al., EP-ANo. 132118), A477<br>
(Raun et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,928,571), OA7633 (Nishida et al., U.S. Pat No. 4,378,348), AM<br>
374 (Kunstmann et al., U.S. Pat No. 3,803,306), K288 (J. Antibiotics, Series A, Volume 14,<br>
page 141 (1961), also known as actinoidin), ristomycin and others.<br>
Some glycopeptide antibiotics, such as vancomycin and teicoplanin are vital therapeutic agents<br>
used world-wide for the treatment of infections with gram-positive bacteria. Other antibiotics of<br>
this type (eremomycin, chloroeremomycin, ristocetin, teicoplanin aglycon and some others) are<br>
also highly active against gram-positive microorganisms including methicillin-resistant<br>
staphylococci (Nagarajan, R. Glycopeptide Antibiotics. New york: Marcel Dekker. 1994). In<br>
addition, many have been demonstrated to increase animal feed utilization efficiency and,<br>
therefore, to be useful to promote animal growth, to improve milk production in ruminants and<br>
to treat and to prevent ketosis in ruminants. The glycopeptide antibiotics are well known as<br>
powerful antibacterial but until now there are no data available about anti-viral, anti-retroviral<br>
or anti-HIV activity of such compounds.<br>
Emerging bacterial resistance to vancomycin, which has recently become a major public health<br>
threat, is a stimulus for the synthesis and investigation of various derivatives of glycopeptide<br>
antibiotics (Malabarba, A et al Med. Res. Rev. 17: 69-137, 1997 and Pavlov AY. &amp;<br>
M.N.Preobrazhenskaya. Russian Journal of Bioorganic Chemistry. 24:570 - 587, 1998).<br>
EP00265071 and WO00/69893 for example describe novel glycopeptide antibiotics related to<br>
vancomycin with antibacterial activity. However, none of these compounds or their derivatives<br>
have been demonstrated to have antiviral properties or to be suitable to inhibit or prevent viral<br>
infections.<br>
Several natural peptide antibiotics such as complestatins and chloropeptins with activity against<br>
HIV-1 (K. Matsuzara, H. et al J.Antibiotics 1994, V.47, N.10, p. 1173-1174) and kistamycins<br>
with activity against influenza virus (N. Naruse, O, et al J. Antibiotics 1993, V.46, N.12,<br>
p. 1812-1818) have been described. However, the structures of these hexa- or heptapeptide<br>
antibiotics and the structures of glycopeptide antibiotics and of the aglycons of glycopeptide<br>
antibiotics differ greatly in both amino acid sequence and stereochemistry. All kystamycins,<br>
complestatin and chloropeptins contain a tryptophan moiety linked to central amino acid No 4,<br>
whereas it is represented by a substituted phenylalanine moiety in vancomycin, eremomycin,<br>
chloreremomycin, teicoplanin, DA-40926 and other antibacterial glycopeptides.<br>
Synthesis methods for glycopeptide antibiotic derivatives have also already been described as in<br>

Aglycone. J. Antibiot 1996, 49,1157-1161 and in Malabarba, A. et al Structural modifications<br>

Within the present invention, new anti-viral compounds have been obtained that are active<br>
against a wide range of viruses belonging to different families.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the present invention, new selective anti-viral compounds are being provided. The<br>
compounds are glycopeptide antibiotics from natural resources and their semisynthetic analogs<br>
and derivatives and it has been shown that they possess a broad anti-viral activity. Members of<br>
the Retroviridae (i.e. Lentivirinae), Flaviviridae, Herpesviridae and of the Coronaviridae<br>
families are being inhibited. The present invention demonstrates that the compounds inhibit the<br>
replication of BVDV, HIV, HSV, CMV, VZV, FCV and the SARS virus. Furthermore, the anti-<br>
HIV activity of the compounds is based on an activity in a early stage of the HIV infection<br>
cycle and are potential entry-inhibitors. Therefore, these glycopeptide antibiotics and their<br>
semisynthetic derivatives constitute a new potent class of anti-viral compounds that can be used<br>
in the treatment and prevention of viral infections in animals, mammals and humans, more<br>
specifically for the treatment and prevention of BVDV, HCV, HIV, CMV, FCV, SARS virus,<br>
HSV and VZV infections.<br>
The present invention relates to glycopeptide antibiotics from natural resources or<br>
semisynthetically prepared. The present invention also relates to semisynthetic glycopeptide<br>
antibiotic derivatives. The invention further relates to compounds having anti-viral activity,<br>
more specifically to glycopeptide antibiotics and derivatives that inhibit the replication of<br>
viruses. Most particularly, the invention relates to glycopeptide antibiotics and derivatives<br>
which inhibit the replication of viruses of the family of the retroviridae (i.e. Lentivirinae),<br>
Flaviviridae, Herpesviridae and Coronaviridae and yet more specifically to compounds that<br>
inhibit the replication of BVDV (Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus), HIV (human immunodeficiency<br>
virus), Herpes virus infections like HSV (herpes simplex virus), Varizella Zoster virus (VZV)<br>
infections, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Feline corona virus (FCV) and the virus causing Severe<br>
acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Present invention furthermore relates to the use of the<br>
compounds as a medicine and more specifically to use the compounds as an anti-viral. The<br>
invention also relates to methods for preparation of all such compounds and pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising them. The invention further relates to methods of structurally<br>
modifying said compounds for increasing the antiviral activity and methods of structurally<br>
modifying said compounds for decreasing or removing antibacterial activity while maintaining<br>
antiviral activity. The invention further relates to the use of said compounds in the manufacture<br>
of a medicament useful for the treatment of viral infections, more in particular of BVDV, HCV,<br>
HIV, FCV, HSV, CMV, VZV infections and infections of the virus causing SARS, as well as<br>
for treatment of other retroviral, lentiviral and viral infections. The present invention also<br>
relates to a method of treatment of viral infections, by using said compounds.<br>
The present invention relates thus to glycopeptide antibiotics and their derivatives, including<br>
various semisynthetic derivatives of natural glycopeptide antibiotics such as vancomycin,<br>
eremomycin, chloreremomycin, teicoplanin, Deacyl-40926, Demannosyl-DA40926, ristocetin,<br>
A35512, avoparcin, actaplanin, AAD-216, A477, OA7633, AM 374, actinoidin, ristomycin and<br>
others, their aglycons and also products of their partial degradation with the peptide core<br>
destroyed or modified in peptide core and in sugar moieties. The present derivatives are useful<br>
as anti-viral compounds.<br>

compounds, for example compounds with many free hydroxyl functions are useful in<br>
hydrophylic affinity separations.<br>
The present invention includes a class of natural glycopeptide antibiotics and their<br>
derivatives and a class of compounds with structural similarity to said natural glycopeptide<br>
antibiotics which possess antiviral activity such as the anti-retroviral activity, anti-flaviviral,<br>
anti-herpes and anti-coronaviral activity of presented examples. Such compounds can be natural<br>
glycopeptide antibiotics, with structures as for instance disclosed in K.C.Nicolaou, C.N.C. et al.<br>
Chem. Int. Ed., 1999, V.38, p.2096-2152 and B.Cavalleri &amp; F.Parenti. Encyclopedia of<br>
Chemical Technology, 1992, V.2, p.995-1018. The invention also includes derivatives of<br>
glycopeptide antibiotics, which have been structurally engineered or modified to decrease or<br>
remove completely or partially the antibacterial activity while still comprising antiviral activity.<br>
Several compounds of the invention were tested for their antibacterial activity and showed to be<br>
not or less active as anti-bacterial than the parent compound. Antibacterial assays that can be<br>

semisynthetic or biosynthetic derivatives of natural glycopeptide antibiotics of the general<br>
formula Z, or I, II, El or IV, V and VI. The above mentioned compounds may be engineered to<br>
be less active or inactive antibacterials at therapeutically effective antiviral doses and it also has<br>
been demonstrated by this invention that they can be engineered to have no mammalian cell<br>
toxicity at therapeutically effective antiviral doses. The compounds are selected for antiviral<br>
activity and low mammalian cell toxicity and eventually may be selected as additional property<br>
antibacterial inactivity in antiviral activity assays such as the anti-HIV assays of present<br>
invention, a cytostatic activity assay of the state of the art or the cytostatic activity assay on the<br>
mammalian cell lines (L1210, Molt4/C8 or CEM) of present invention and additional<br>
antibacterial assays of the state of the art.<br>
The compounds of the invention are employed for the treatment or prophylaxis of viral<br>
infections, more particularly flaviviral, retroviral, herpes or coronaviral infections, in particular,<br>
HCV, BVDV, HIV, HSV, CMV, YFV, FCV, VZV and SARS virus. When using one or more<br>
glycopeptide antibiotics or their derivatives, or more particularly derivatives of the formula Z or<br>
I, II and III as defined herein:<br>
- the active ingredients of the compound(s) may be administered to the mammal (including a<br>
human) to be treated by any means well known in the art, i.e. orally, intranasally,<br>
subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intradermally, intravenously, intra-arterially, parenterally<br>
or by catheterization.<br>
- the therapeutically effective amount of the preparation of the compound(s), especially for<br>
the treatment of viral infections in humans and other mammals, preferably is a flaviviral,<br>
retroviral, herpes or coronaviral enzyme inhibiting amount. More preferably, it is a<br>
flaviviral, retroviral, herpes or coronaviral replication inhibiting amount or a flaviviral,<br>
retroviral, herpes or coronaviral enzyme inhibiting amount of the derivative(s) of formula Z<br>
or I, n and HI as defined herein corresponds to an amount which ensures a plasma level of<br>
between 1µg/ml and 100 mg/ml, optionally of 10 mg/ml. This can be achieved by<br>
administration of a dosage of in the range of 0.001 mg to 20 mg, preferably 0.01 mg to 5<br>
mg, preferably 0.1mg to 1 mg per day per kg bodyweight for humans. Depending upon the<br>
pathologic condition to be treated and the patient"s condition, the said effective amount may<br>
be divided into several sub-units per day or may be administered at more than one day<br>
intervals.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method for preventing or treating a viral<br>
infections in a subject or patient by administering to the patient in need thereof a therapeutically<br>

therapeutically effective amount of the preparation of the compound(s), especially for the<br>
treatment of viral infections in humans and other mammals, preferably is a flaviviral, retroviral,<br>
herpes or coronaviral enzyme inhibiting amount. More preferably, it is a flaviviral, retroviral,<br>
herpes or coronaviral replication inhibiting amount or a flaviviral, retroviral, herpes or<br>
coronaviral enzyme inhibiting amount of the glycopeptide antibiotics and their derivatives,<br>
more particularly of the derivative(s) of formula Z or I, II and III as defined herein. Suitable<br>
dosage is usually in the range of 0.001 mg to 20 mg, preferably 0.01 mg to 5 mg, preferably<br>
O.lmg to 1 mg per day per kg bodyweight for humans. Depending upon the pathologic<br>
condition to be treated and the patient"s condition, the said effective amount may be divided<br>
into several sub-units per day or may be administered at more than one day intervals.<br>
As is conventional in the art, the evaluation of a synergistic effect in a drug combination<br>
may be made by analyzing the quantification of the interactions between individual drugs, using<br>
the median effect principle described by Chou et al. in Adv. Enzyme Reg. (1984) 22:27. Briefly,<br>
this principle states that interactions (synergism, additivity, antagonism) between two drugs can<br>
be quantified using the combination index (hereinafter referred as CI) defined by the following<br>
equation:<br><br>
wherein EDX is the dose of the first or respectively second drug used alone (1a, 2a), or in<br>
combination with the second or respectively first drug (1c, 2c), which is needed to produce a<br>
given effect. The said first and second drug have synergistic or additive or antagonistic effects<br>
depending upon CI  1, respectively.<br>
Synergistic activity of the pharmaceutical compositions or combined preparations of this<br>
invention against viral infection may also be readily determined by means of one or more tests<br>
such as, but not limited to, the isobologram method, as previously described by Elion et al. in J.<br>
Biol. Chem. (1954) 208:477-488 and by Baba et al. in Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. (1984)<br>
25:515-517, using EC50 for calculating the fractional inhibitory concentration (hereinafter<br>
referred as FIC). When the minimum FIC index corresponding to the FIC of combined<br>
compounds (e.g., FICX + FICy) is equal to 1.0, the combination is said to be additive; when it is<br>
beween 1.0 and 0.5, the combination is defined as subsynergistic, and when it is lower than 0.5,<br>
the combination is by defined as synergistic. When the minimum FIC index is between 1.0 and<br>
2.0, the combination is defined as subantagonistic and, when it is higher than 2.0, the<br>
combination is defined as antagonistic.<br>
This principle may be applied to a combination of different antiviral drugs of the<br>
invention or to a combination of the antiviral drugs of the invention with other drugs that<br>
exhibit anti-retroviral, anti-flaviviral, anti-herpes or anti-coronaviral activity.<br>
The invention thus relates to a pharmaceutical composition or combined preparation having<br>
synergistic effects against a viral infection and containing:<br>
Either:<br>
A)<br>
(a) a combination of two or more of the glycopeptide antibiotics, their derivatives or more<br>
particularly compounds according to formula Z or I, II and III of the present invention, and<br>
(b) optionally one or more pharmaceutical excipients or pharmaceutically acceptable carriers,<br>
for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in the treatment or prevention of a viral infection<br>
or<br>
B)<br>
(c) one or more anti-viral agents, and<br>
(d) at least one of the glycopeptide antibiotics, their derivatives or more particularly compounds<br>
according to formula Z or I, II and III of the present invention, and<br>
(e) optionally one or more pharmaceutical excipients or pharmaceutically acceptable carriers,<br>
for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in the treatment or prevention of a viral infection.<br>
Suitable anti-viral agents for inclusion into the synergistic antiviral compositions or<br>
combined preparations of this invention include, for instance, interferon-alfa (either pegylated<br>
or not), nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (i.e. zidovudine, didanosine, stavudine,<br>
lamivudine, zalcitabine and abacavir), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (i.e.<br>
nevirapine, delavirdine and efavirenz), protease inhibitors (i.e. saquinavir, indinavir, ritonavir,<br>
nelfinavir, amprenavir and lopinavir), fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide, ribavirin, vidarabine,<br>
acyclovir, gancyclovir, amantadine, rimantadine and other selective inhibitors of the replication<br>
of BVDV, HCV, HIV, HSV, VZV, CMV, FCV and SARS virus.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition or combined preparation with synergistic activity against<br>
viral infection according to this invention may contain glycopeptide antibiotics, their<br>
derivatives or more particularly compounds according to formula Z or I, II and HI of the present<br>
invention over a broad content range depending on the contemplated use and the expected<br>
effect of the preparation. Generally, the content of the glycopeptide antibiotics, their derivatives<br>
or more particularly compounds according to formula Z or I, II and III of the present invention<br>
of the combined preparation is within the range of 0.1 to 99.9% by weight, preferably from 1 to<br>
99% by weight, more preferably from 5 to 95% by weight.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, the compounds of the invention<br>
may be employed in combination with other therapeutic agents for the treatment or prophylaxis<br>
of flaviviral, retroviral, herpes or coronaviral infections, such as for example also<br>
corticosteroids in the case of SARS. The invention therefore relates to the use of a composition<br>
comprising:<br>
(a) one or more glycopeptide antibiotics, their derivatives or more particularly compounds<br>
according to formula Z or I, II and III of the present invention, and<br>
(b) one or more flaviviral, retroviral, herpes or coronaviral enzyme inhibitors as biologically<br>
active agents in respective proportions such as to provide a synergistic effect against a viral<br>
infection, particularly a flaviviral, retroviral, herpes or coronaviral infection in a mammal,<br>
for instance in the form of a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential<br>
use in viral infection therapy, such as of HCV, BVDV, HIV, HSV, VZV, YFV, FCV, CMV<br>
and SARS virus. Examples of such further therapeutic agents for use in combinations<br>
include agents that are effective for the treatment or prophylaxis of these infections,<br>
including interferon alpha, ribavirin, and other mentioned before. More examples are<br>
compounds falling under the scope of patents or patent applications handling with inhibitors<br>
of viral infections, more particularly flaviviral, retroviral, herpes and coronaviral infections.<br>
For example, compounds falling within the scope of disclosure EP1162196, WO<br>
03/010141, WO 03/007945 and WO 03010140 , a compound falling within the scope of<br>
disclosure WO 00/204425, and other patents or patent applications within their patent<br>
families or all the foregoing filings and/or an inhibitor of flaviviral protease and/or one or<br>
more additional flavivirus polymerase inhibitors, can be used.<br>
When using a combined preparation of (a) and (b):<br>
- the active ingredients {a) and (b) may be administered to the mammal (including a human)<br>
to be treated by any means well known in the art, i.e. orally, intranasally, subcutaneously,<br>
intramuscularly, intradermally, intravenously, intra-arterially, parenterally or by<br>
catheterization.<br>
- the therapeutically effective amount of the combined preparation of (a) and (b), especially<br>
for the treatment of viral infections in humans and other mammals, particularly is a<br>
flaviviral, retroviral, herpes or coronaviral enzyme inhibiting amount. More particularly, it<br>
is a flaviviral, retroviral, herpes or coronaviral replication inhibiting amount of derivative<br>
(a) and a flaviviral, retroviral, herpes or coronaviral enzyme inhibiting amount of inhibitor<br>
(b). Still more particularly when the said flaviviral, retroviral, herpes or coronaviral enzyme<br>
inhibitor (b) is a polymerase inhibitor, its effective amount is a polymerase inhibiting<br>
amount. When the said flaviviral or pioornaviral enzyme inhibitor (b) is a protease inhibitor,<br>
its effective amount is a protease inhibiting amount.<br>
- ingredients (a) and (b) may be administered simultaneously but it is also beneficial to<br>
administer them separately or sequentially, for instance within a relatively short period of<br>
time (e.g. within about 24 hours) in order to achieve their functional diffusion in the body to<br>
be treated.<br>
The invention also relates to the glycopeptide antibiotics and their derivatives, more particularly<br>
compounds of formula Z or I, II and III of this invention being used for inhibition of the<br>
replication of other viruses than BVDV, HCV, HIV, YFV, HSV, CMV, VZV, FCV or SARS<br>
virus, particularly for the inhibition of other flaviviruses, herpes viruses, retroviruses or<br>
coronaviruses or picornaviruses, with in particular Dengue virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis G<br>
virus, Classical Swine Fever virus or the Border Disease Virus, epstein bar virus and also for<br>
other viral families such as the Picornaviruses (i.e. enterovirus, rhinovirus, Coxsackie virus),<br>
orthomyxoviridae (i.e. influenza), paramyxoviridae (i.e. parainfluenza, human<br>
metapneumavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)), rhabdoviridae (i.e. rabies), bunyaviridae<br>
(i.e. hantavirus), filoviridae (i.e. marburg, ebola), Poxviridae (i.e. variola), Adenoviridae,<br>
Papovaviridae (i.e. human papilloma virus) and others.<br>
The present invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one active<br>
ingredient as above defined together with a veterinary carrier therefor, for example in the<br>
treatment of BVDV or FCV. Veterinary carriers are materials useful for the purpose of<br>
administering the composition and may be solid, liquid or gaseous materials which are<br>
otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with the active ingredient.<br>
These veterinary compositions may be administered orally, parenterally or by any other desired<br>
route.<br>
More generally, the invention relates to glycopeptide antibiotics and their derivatives, more<br>
particularly compounds of formula Z or I, II and III of this invention being useful as agents<br>
having biological activity (particularly antiviral activity) or as diagnostic agents. Any of the<br>
uses mentioned with respect to the present invention may be restricted to a non-medical use, a<br>
non-therapeutic use, a non-diagnostic use, or exclusively an in vitro use, or a use related to cells<br>
remote from an animal.<br>
Those of skill in the art will also recognize that the compounds of the invention may exist in<br>
many different protonation states, depending on, among other things, the pH of their<br>
environment. While the structural formulae provided herein depict the compounds in only one<br>
of several possible protonation states, it will be understood that these structures are illustrative<br>
only, and that the invention is not limited to any particular protonation state, any and all<br>
protonated forms of the compounds are intended to fall within the scope of the invention.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" as used herein means the therapeutically active<br>
non-toxic salt forms which the glycopeptide antibiotics and their derivatives, more particularly<br>
compounds of formula Z or I, II and III of this invention are able to form. Therefore, the<br>
compounds of this invention optionally comprise salts of the compounds herein, especially<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic salts containing, for example, Na+, Li+, K+, Ca+2 and<br>
Mg+2. Such salts may include those derived by combination of appropriate cations such as<br>
alkali and alkaline earth metal ions or ammonium and quaternary amino ions with an acid anion<br>
moiety, typically a carboxylic acid. The compounds of the invention may bear multiple positive<br>
or negative charges. The net charge of the compounds of the invention may be either positive or<br>
negative. Any associated counter ions are typically dictated by the synthesis and/or isolation<br>
methods by which the compounds are obtained. Typical counter ions include, but are not<br>
limited to ammonium, sodium, potassium, lithium, halides, acetate, trifluoroacetate, etc., and<br>
mixtures thereof. It will be understood that the identity of any associated counter ion is not a<br>
critical feature of the invention, and that the invention encompasses the compounds in<br>
association with any type of counter ion. Moreover, as the compounds can exist in a variety of<br>
different forms, the invention is intended to encompass not only forms of the compounds that<br>
are in association with counter ions (e.g., dry salts), but also forms that are not in association<br>
with counter ions (e.g., aqueous or organic solutions). Metal salts typically are prepared by<br>
reacting the metal hydroxide with a compound of this invention. Examples of metal salts which<br>
are prepared in this way are salts containing Li+, Na+, and K+. A less soluble metal salt can be<br>
precipitated from the solution of a more soluble salt by addition of the suitable metal<br>
compound. In addition, salts may be formed from acid addition of certain organic and inorganic<br>
acids to basic centers, typically amines, or to acidic groups. Examples of such appropriate acids<br>
include, for instance, inorganic acids such as hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric or<br>
hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like; or organic acids such<br>
as, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, 2-hydroxypropanoic, 2-oxopropanoic, lactic,<br>
pyruvic, oxalic (i.e. ethanedioic), malonic, succinic (i.e. butanedioic acid), maleic, fumaric,<br>
malic, tartaric, citric, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic,<br>
cyclohexanesulfamic, salicylic (i.e. 2-hydroxybenzoic), p-aminosalicylic and the like.<br>
Furthermore, this term also includes the solvates which glycopeptide antibiotics and their<br>
derivatives, more particularly compounds of formula Z or I, II and III of this invention as well<br>
as their salts are able to form, such as for example hydrates, alcoholates and the like. Finally, it<br>
is to be understood that the compositions herein comprise compounds of the invention in their<br>
unionized, as well as zwitterionic form, and combinations with stoichiometric amounts of water<br>
as in hydrates.<br>
Also included within the scope of this invention are the salts of the parental compounds with<br>
one or more amino acids, especially the naturally-occurring amino acids found as protein<br>
components. The amino acid typically is one bearing a side chain with a basic or acidic group,<br>
e.g., lysine, arginine or ghitamic acid, or a neutral group such as glycine, serine, threonine,<br>
alanine, isoleucine, or leucine.<br>
The compounds of the invention also include physiologically acceptable salts thereof. Examples<br>
of physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention include salts derived from<br>
an appropriate base, such as an alkali metal (for example, sodium), an alkaline earth (for<br>
example, magnesium), ammonium and NX4+ (wherein X is C1-C4 alkyl). Physiologically<br>
acceptable salts of an hydrogen atom or an amino group include salts of organic carboxylic<br>
acids such as acetic, benzoic, lactic, fumaric, tartaric, maleic, malonic, malic, isethionic,<br>
lactobionic and succinic acids; organic sulfonic acids, such as methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic,<br>
benzenesulfonic and p-toluenesulfonic acids; and inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric,<br>
sulfuric, phosphoric and sulfamic acids. Physiologically acceptable salts of a compound<br>
containing a hydroxy group include the anion of said compound in combination with a suitable<br>
cation such as Na+ and NX4+ (wherein X typically is independently selected from H or a Cl-<br>
C4 alkyl group). However, salts of acids or bases which are not physiologically acceptable may<br>
also find use, for example, in the preparation or purification of a physiologically acceptable<br>
compound. All salts, whether or not derived form a physiologically acceptable acid or base, are<br>
within the scope of the present invention.<br>
As used herein and unless otherwise stated, the term "enantiomer" means each individual<br>
optically active form of a compound of the invention, having an optical purity or enantiomeric<br>
excess (as determined by methods standard in the art) of at least 80% (i.e. at least 90% of one<br>
enantiomer and at most 10% of the other enantiomer), preferably at least 90% and more<br>
preferably at least 98%.<br>
Each compound of the present invention may be a pure stereoisomer coupled at each of its<br>
chiral centers or it may be inverted at one or more of its chiral centers. It may be a single<br>
stereoisomer or a mixture of two or more stereoisomers. If it is a mixture, the ratio may or may<br>
not be equimolar. In a particular embodiment, the compound is a single stereoisomer and in a<br>
more particular embodiment, the stereochemistry of the peptide core of the compounds of the<br>
invention containing six amino acids (2-7) is 2(R), 3(5), 4(R), 5(R), 6(5) and 7(S).<br>
The term "isomers" as used herein means all possible isomeric forms, including tautomeric and<br>
sterochemical forms, which glycopeptide antibiotics and their derivatives, more particularly<br>
compounds of formula Z or I, II and III of this invention may possess, but not including<br>
position isomers. Typically, the structures shown herein exemplify only one tautomeric or<br>
resonance form of the compounds, but the corresponding alternative configurations are<br>
contemplated as well. Unless otherwise stated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes<br>
the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms, said mixtures containing all<br>
diastereomers and enantiorners (since the glycopeptide antibiotics and their derivatives, more<br>
particularly compounds of formula Z or I, II and III of this invention may have at least one<br>
chiral center) of the basic molecular structure, as wel as the stereochemically pure or enriched<br>
compounds. More particularly, stereogenic centers may have either the R- or S-configuration,<br>
and multiple bonds may have either cis- or trans-configuration.<br>
Pure isomeric forms of the said compounds are defined as isomers substantially free of other<br>
enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms of the same basic molecular structure. In particular, the<br>
term "stereoisomerically pure" or "chirally pure" relates to compounds having a stereoisomeric<br>
excess of at least about 80% (i.e. at least 90% of one isomer and at most 10% of the other<br>
possible isomers), preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 94% and most preferably at<br>
least 97%. The terms "enantionierically pure" and "diastereomerically pure" should be<br>
understood in a similar way, having regard to the enantiomeric excess, respectively the<br>
diastereomeric excess, of the mixture in question.<br>
Separation of stereoisomers is accomplished by standard methods known to those in the art.<br>
One enantiomer of a compound of the invention can be separated substantially free of its<br>
opposing enantiomer by a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active<br>
resolving agents ("Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds," (1962) by E. L. Eliel, McGraw<br>
Hill; Lochmuller, C. H., (1975) J. Chromatogr., 113 :(3) 283-302). Separation of isomers in a<br>
mixture can be accomplished by any suitable method, including: (1) formation of ionic,<br>
diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other<br>
methods, (2) formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents,<br>
separation of the diastereomers, and conversion to the pure enantiomers, or (3) enantiomers can<br>
be separated directly under chiral conditions. Under method (1), diastereomeric salts can be<br>
formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine,<br>
strychnine, a-methyl-b-phenylethylamine (amphetamine), and the like with asymmetric<br>
compounds bearing acidic functionality, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The<br>
diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic<br>
chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral<br>
carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic<br>
acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts. Alternatively, by method (2), the<br>
substrate to be resolved may be reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a<br>
diastereomeric pair (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S. (1994) Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds,<br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., p. 322). Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting<br>
asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents, such as<br>
menthyl derivatives, followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the<br>
free, enantiomerically enriched compound. A method of determining optical purity involves<br>
making chiral esters, such as a menthyl ester or Mosher ester, a-methoxy-a-<br>
(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetate (Jacob III. (1982) J. Org. Chem. 47:4165), of the racemic<br>
mixture, and analyzing the NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric<br>
diastereomers. Stable diastereomers can be separated and isolated by normal- and reverse-phase<br>
chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl-isoquinolines<br>
(Hoye, T, WO 96/15111).Under method (3), a racemic mixture of two asymmetric enantiomers<br>
is separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Suitable chiral stationary<br>
phases are, for example, polysaccharides, in particular cellulose or amylose derivatives.<br>
Commercially available polysaccharide based chiral stationary phases are ChiralCeI™ CA, OA,<br>
OB5, OC5, OD, OF, OG, OJ and OK, and ChiralpakTM AD, AS, OP(+) and OT(+).<br>
Appropriate eluents or mobile phases for use in combination with said polysaccharide chiral<br>
stationary phases are hexane and the like, modified with an alcohol such as ethanol, isopropanol<br>
and the like. ("Chiral Liquid Chromatography" (1989) W. J. Lough, Ed, Chapman and Hall,<br>
New York; Okamoto, (1990) "Optical resolution of dihydropyridine enantiomers by High-<br>
performance liquid chromatography using phenylcarbamates of polysaccharides as a chiral<br>
stationary phase", J. of Chromatogr. 513:375-378).<br>
The terms cis and trans are used herein in accordance with Chemical Abstracts nomenclature<br>
and include reference to the position of the substituents on a ring moiety. The absolute<br>
stereochemical configuration of the compounds of formula Z or I, II and III may easily be<br>
determined by those skilled in the art while using well-known methods such as, for example, X-<br>
ray diffraction.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be formulated with conventional carriers and excipients,<br>
which will be selected in accord with ordinary practice. Tablets will contain excipients,<br>
glidants, fillers, binders and the like. Aqueous formulations are prepared in sterile form, and<br>
when intended for delivery by other than oral administration generally will be isotonic.<br>
Formulations optionally contain excipients such as those set forth in the "Handbook of<br>
Pharmaceutical Excipients" (1986) and include ascorbic acid and other antioxidants, chelating<br>
agents such as EDTA, carbohydrates such as dextrin, hydroxyalkylcellulose,<br>
hydroxyalkylmethylcellulose, stearic acid and the like.<br>
Subsequently, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" as used herein means any material<br>
or substance with which the active ingredient is formulated in order to facilitate its application<br>
or dissemination to the locus to be treated, for instance by dissolving, dispersing or diffusing<br>
the said composition, and/or to facilitate its storage, transport or handling without impairing its<br>
effectiveness. The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier may be a solid or a liquid or a gas which<br>
has been compressed to form a liquid, i.e. the compositions of this invention can suitably be<br>
used as concentrates, emulsions, solutions, granulates, dusts, sprays, aerosols, suspensions,<br>
ointments, creams, tablets, pellets or powders.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical carriers for use in the said pharmaceutical compositions and their<br>
formulation are well known to those skilled in the art, and there is no particular restriction to<br>
their selection within the present invention. They may also include additives such as wetting<br>
agents, dispersing agents, stickers, adhesives, emulsifying agents, solvents, coatings,<br>
antibacterial and antifungal agents (for example phenol, sorbic acid, chlorobutanol), isotonic<br>
agents (such as sugars or sodium chloride) and the like, provided the same are consistent with<br>
pharmaceutical practice, i.e. carriers and additives which do not create permanent damage to<br>
mammals. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be prepared in any<br>
known manner, for instance by homogeneously mixing, coating and/or grinding the active<br>
ingredients, in a one-step or multi-steps procedure, with the selected carrier material and, where,<br>
appropriate, the other additives such as surface-active agents, may also be prepared by<br>
inicronisation, for instance in view to obtain them in the form of microspheres usually having a<br>
diameter of about 1 to 10 gm, namely for the manufacture of microcapsules for controlled or<br>
sustained release of the active ingredients.<br>
Suitable surface-active agents, also known as emulgent or emulsifier, to be used in the<br>
pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are non-ionic, cationic and/or anionic<br>
materials having good emulsifying, dispersing and/or wetting properties. Suitable anionic<br>
surfactants include both water-soluble soaps and water-soluble synthetic surface-active agents.<br>
Suitable soaps are alkaline or alkaline-earth metal salts, unsubsthuted or substituted ammonium<br>
salts of higher fatty acids (C10-C22), e.g. the sodium or potassium salts of oleic or stearic acid, or<br>
of natural fatty acid mixtures obtainable form coconut oil or tallow oil. Synthetic surfactants<br>
include sodium or calcium salts of polyacrylic acids; fatty sulphonates and sulphates;<br>
sulphonated benzimidazole derivatives and alkylarylsulphonates. Fatty sulphonates or sulphates<br>
are usually in the form of alkaline or alkaline-earth metal salts, unsubsthuted ammonium salts<br>
or ammonium salts substituted with an alkyl or acyl radical having from 8 to 22 carbon atoms,<br>
e.g. the sodium or calcium salt of lignosulphonic acid or dodecylsulphonic acid or a mixture of<br>
fatty alcohol sulphates obtained from natural fatty acids, alkaline or alkaline-earth metal salts of<br>
sulphuric or sulphonic acid esters (such as sodium lauryl sulphate) and sulphonic acids of fatty<br>
alcohol/ethylene oxide adducts. Suitable sulphonated benzimidazole derivatives preferably<br>
contain 8 to 22 carbon atoms. Examples of alkylarylsulphonates are the sodium, calcium or<br>
alcanolamine salts of dodecylbenzene sulphonic add or dibutyl-naphtalenesulphonic acid or a<br>
naphtatene-sulphonic acid/formaldehyde condensation product. Also suitable are the<br>
corresponding phosphates, e.g. salts of phosphoric acid ester and an adduct of p-nonylphenol<br>
with ethylene and/or propylene oxide, or phospholipids. Suitable phospholipids for this purpose<br>
are the natural (originating from animal or plant cells) or synthetic phospholipids of the<br>
cephalin or lecithin type such as e.g. phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine,<br>
phosphatidylglycerine, lysolecitnin, cardiolipin, dioctanylphosphatidyl-choline,<br>
dipalmitoylphoshatidyl -choline and their mixtures.<br>
Suitable non-ionic surfactants include polyethoxylated and polypropoxylated derivatives of<br>
alkylphenols, fatty alcohols, fatty acids, aliphatic amines or amides containing at least 12<br>
carbon atoms in the molecule, alkylarenesulphonates and dialkylsulphosuccinates, such as<br>
polyglycol ether derivatives of aliphatic and cycloaliphatic alcohols, saturated and unsaturated<br>
fatty acids and alkylphenols, said derivatives preferably containing 3 to 10 glycol ether groups<br>
and 8 to 20 carbon atoms in the (aliphatic) hydrocarbon moiety and 6 to 18 carbon atoms in the<br>
alkyl moiety of the alkylphenol. Further suitable non-ionic surfactants are water-soluble adducts<br>
of polyethylene oxide with poylypropylene glycol, ethylenediaminopolypropylene glycol<br>
containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, which adducts contain 20 to 250<br>
ethyleneglycol ether groups and/or 10 to 100 propyleneglycol ether groups. Such compounds<br>
usually contain from I to 5 ethyleneglycol units per propyleneglycol unit. Representative<br>
examples of non-ionic surfactants are nonylphenol -polyethoxyethanol, castor oil polyglycolic<br>
ethers, polypropylene/polyethylene oxide adducts, tributylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol,<br>
polyethyleneglycol and octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol. Fatty acid esters of polyethylene<br>
sorbitan (such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan trioleate), glycerol, sorbitan, sucrose and<br>
pentaerythritol are also suitable non-ionic surfactants<br>
Suitable cationic surfactants include quaternary ammonium salts, particularly halides, having 4<br>
hydrocarbon radicals optionally substituted with halo, phenyl, substituted phenyl or hydroxy;<br>
for instance quaternary ammonium salts containing as N-substituent at least one C8-C22 alkyl<br>
radical (e.g. cetyl, lauryl, palmityl, myristyl, oleyl and the like) and, as further substituents,<br>
unsubstituted or halogenated lower alkyl, benzyl and/or hydroxy-lower alkyl radicals.<br>
A more detailed description of surface-active agents suitable for this purpose may be found for<br>
instance in "McCutcheon"s Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual" (MC Publishing Crop.,<br>
Ridgewood, New Jersey, 1981), "Tensid-Taschenbucw", 2 d ed. (Hanser Verlag, Vienna, 1981)<br>
and "Encyclopaedia of Surfactants, (Chemical Publishing Co., New York, 1981).<br>
Compounds of the invention and their physiologically acceptable salts (hereafter collectively<br>
referred to as the active ingredients) may be administered by any route appropriate to the<br>
condition to be treated, suitable routes including oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including ocular,<br>
buccal and sublingual), vaginal and parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular,<br>
intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural). The preferred route of administration may<br>
vary with for example the condition of the recipient.<br>
While it is possible for the active ingredients to be administered alone it is preferable to present<br>
them as pharmaceutical formulations. The formulations, both for veterinary and for human use,<br>
of the present invention comprise at least one active ingredient, as above described, together<br>
with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers therefore and optionally other,<br>
therapeutic ingredients. The carriers) optimally are "acceptable" in the sense of being<br>
compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient<br>
thereof. The formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal<br>
and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous,<br>
intradermal, intrathecal and epidural) administration. The formulations may conveniently be<br>
presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art<br>
of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient<br>
with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the<br>
formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active<br>
ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary,<br>
shaping the product.<br>
Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as<br>
discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of<br>
the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid<br>
or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion.<br>
The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste.<br>
A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory<br>
ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the<br>
active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a<br>
binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets<br>
may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound<br>
moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may<br>
be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein. For<br>
infections of the eye or other external tissues e.g. mouth and skin, the formulations are<br>
optionally applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredients) in an<br>
. amount of for example, 0.07S to 20% w/w (including active ingredients) in a range between<br>
0.1% and 20% in increments of 0.1% w/w such as 0.6% w/w, 0.7% w/w, etc), preferably 0.2 to<br>
15% w/w and most preferably 0.5 to 10% w/w. When formulated in an ointment, the active<br>
ingredients may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base.<br>
Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream<br>
base. If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include, for example, at least 30%<br>
w/w of a polyhydric alcohol, i.e. an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as<br>
propylene glycol, butane 1,3-diol, raannitol, sorbrtol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol<br>
(including PEG400) and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may desirably include a<br>
compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or<br>
other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethylsulfoxide<br>
and related analogs.<br>
The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from known ingredients in<br>
a known manner. While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier (otherwise known as an<br>
emulgent), it desirably comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with<br>
both a fat and an oil. Optionally, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic<br>
emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat.<br>
Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizers) make up the so-called emulsifying wax,<br>
and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base<br>
which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations.<br>
The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic<br>
properties, since the solubility of the active compound in most oils likely to be used in<br>
pharmaceutical emulsion formulations is very low. Thus the cream should optionally be a non-<br>
greasy, non-staining and washable product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from<br>
tubes or other containers. Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esters such as di-<br>
isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl<br>
myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2-ethylhexyl palmhate or a blend of<br>
branched chain esters known as Crodamol CAP may be used, the last three being preferred<br>
esters. These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties required.<br>
Alternatively, high melting point lipids such as white soft paraffin and/or liquid paraffin or<br>
other mineral oils can be used.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the<br>
active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent<br>
for the active ingredient. The active ingredient is optionally present in such formulations in a<br>
concentration of 0.5 to 20%, advantageously 0.5 to 10% particularly about 1.5% w/w.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the<br>
active ingredient in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles<br>
comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and<br>
acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>
Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base<br>
comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate. Formulations suitable for nasal<br>
administration wherein the carrier is a solid include a coarse powder having a particle size for<br>
example in the range 20 to 500 microns (including particle sizes in a range between 20 and 500<br>
microns in increments of 5 microns such as 30 microns, 35 microns, etc), which is administered<br>
in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e. by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a<br>
container of the powder held close up to the nose. Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a<br>
liquid, for administration as for example a nasal spray or as nasal drops, include aqueous or oily<br>
solutions of the active ingredient. Formulations suitable for aerosol administration may be<br>
prepared according to conventional methods and may be delivered with other therapeutic<br>
agents.<br>
Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons,<br>
creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient<br>
such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.<br>
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile<br>
injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which<br>
render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-<br>
aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The<br>
formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed<br>
ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only<br>
the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to<br>
use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile<br>
powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.<br>
A specific formulation for glycopeptide antibiotics is the combination with cyclodextrin as<br>
described in WO01/82971<br>
Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, as<br>
herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of an active ingredient.<br><br>
It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the<br>
formulations of this invention may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to<br>
the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may<br>
include flavoring agents.<br>
Compounds of the invention can be used to provide controlled release pharmaceutical<br>
formulations containing as active ingredient one or more compounds of the invention<br>
("controlled release formulations") in which the release of the active ingredient can be<br>
controlled and regulated to allow less frequency dosing or to improve the pharmacokinetic or<br>
toxicity profile of a given invention compound. Controlled release formulations adapted for oral<br>
administration in which discrete units comprising one or more compounds of the invention can<br>
be prepared according to conventional methods.<br>
Additional ingredients may be included in order to control the duration of action of the active<br>
ingredient in the composition. Control release compositions may thus be achieved by selecting<br>
appropriate polymer carriers such as for example polyesters, polyamino acids, polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
protamine sulfate and the like. The rate of drug release and duration of action may also be<br>
controlled by incorporating the active ingredient into particles, e.g. microcapsules, of a<br>
polymeric substance such as hydrogels, polylactic acid, hydroxymethylcelhilose, polyniethyl<br>
methacrylate and the other above-described polymers. Such methods include colloid drug<br>
delivery systems like liposomes, microspheres, microemulsions, nanoparticles, nanocapsules<br>
and so on. Depending on the route of administration, the pharmaceutical composition may<br>
require protective coatings. Pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectionable use include sterile<br>
aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation<br>
thereof. Typical carriers for this purpose therefore include biocompatible aqueous buffers,<br>
ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and the like and mixtures thereof.<br>
In view of the fact that, when several active ingredients are used in combination, they do not<br>
necessarily bring out their joint therapeutic effect directly at the same time in die mammal to be<br>
treated, the corresponding composition may also be in the form of a medical kit or package<br>
containing the two ingredients in separate but adjacent repositories or compartments. In the<br>
latter context, each active ingredient may therefore be formulated in a way suitable for an<br>
administration route different from that of the other ingredient, e.g. one of them may be in the<br>
form of an oral or parenteral formulation whereas the other is in the form of an ampoule for<br>
intravenous injection or an aerosol.<br>

methods described below. All the compounds shown in tables 1 to 8 were prepared by<br>
following these methods of preparation.<br>
All reagents and solvents can be purchased from Aldrich (Milwaukee), Fluka (Deisenhofen,<br>
Germany), Sigma Corporation (St. Louis, MO) and Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). The novel<br>

To a stirred solution of 0.5 mmol of antibiotic or its degradation product and 4 mmol of an<br>
appropriate amine in 10 ml of an acetonitrile-water 1 : 1 mixture was added 3 mmol of 37%<br>
aqueous formaldehyde. If a salt of amine was used 1n NaOH was added to pH 10. The reaction<br>
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 h and then 100 ml of water was added. After<br>
adjusting the reaction mixture at pH 3 with 1n HC1, the resulting solution (or suspension) was<br>
extracted with n-BuOH (~ 25 ml x 2); the organic layer was washed with water (~ 15 ml x 2)<br>
and then concentrated at 45 °C in a vacuum to a small volume (~3 ml). On adding ether (~ 100<br>
ml), the precipitated solid was collected and dried in vacuum at room temperature for 4 h. Then<br>
it was dissolved in a minimal amount of MeOH and applied to a chromatographic column with<br>
Sephadex LH-20 (2 x 100 cm) preequilibrated with MeOH. The column was developed with<br>
MeOH at a rate of 10 ml/h, while collecting 5 ml fractions. The suitable fractions were<br>
combined and concentrated to a small volume (~ 3 ml). After adding ether (-100 ml) the<br>
precipitate formed was collected, rinsed with ether and dried in vacuum at room temperature.<br>

The methods for introducing chemical modifications in the sugar moieties of the glycopeptide<br>
antibiotic derivatives, at the amide part, at the resorcinol fragment and at the N-end of the<br>
antibacterial glycopeptide antibiotics were elaborated earlier, and used for the preparation of a<br>
variety of semisynthetic glycopeptides (Malabarba, A; Nicas, T.I. and Thompson, R.S.<br>

of the glycopeptide antibiotics such has vancomycin can be performed as described in Nicas,<br>
T.I. et al. (Antimicrobial agents and Chemotherapy, 1996,40, 2194-2199.)<br>
Degradation products, the aglycon antibiotics can be obtained through chemical degradation as<br>
described as examples hereunder.<br>

 Malkova, I.V.; Orlova, G.I. Structure and Antimicrobial Activity of Products of Partial<br>
Degradation of Antibiotic Eremomycin. Antibiotics and Chemotherapy (Bus) 1991, 36, 28-31).<br>
1000 mg (0.6 mmol) of eremomycin sulfate were dissolved in 20 ml of HC1 (concentrated) and<br>
were kept at a room temperature for S h. Then 60 ml of water were added to precipitate<br>
eremomycin aglycon. The mixture was cooled to 5 °C and kept in refrigerator for 3 h. The solid<br>
was filtered off, washed with 10 ml of cool water, then with aceton and dried in vacuum. The<br>
solid was dissolved in 6 ml of DMSO and was added to 60 ml of acetone. The precipitate was<br>
filterred off, washed with aceton and dried to yield S30 mg of a crude eremomycin aglycon.<br>
The water filtrate was passed through column (2x10 cm) of Dowex 50x2 resin (H+-form),<br>
which was washed with water and eluted with 50 ml of 0.25 N NH4OH. The eluates were<br>
concentrated in vacuum with n-BuOH to minimal volume and precipitated with 50 ml acetone.<br>
The precipitate was collected, washed with acetone and dried in vacuum to give a crude<br>
eremomycin aglycoa The samples were analyzed by TLC on the Merck Silica Gel 60F254<br>
plates in systems EtOAc-PrOH-25% NH4OH 2:2:3 with UV control.<br>
The solids were combined and dissolved in 10 ml of 0.05 M AcONH4-EtOH 9:1 mixture while<br>
acidified with 2 N HCl to pH 3 and applied to a chromatographic column with CM 32<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose (Whatman, Greate Britane) (45 cm x 2 cm) preequilibrated with 0.05<br>
M AcONH4-EtOH 9:1 mixture (pH 6.7). The column chromatography was carried out with 0.05<br>
M AcONH4-EtOH 9:1 mixture (pH 6.7) (300 ml), 0.1 M AcONH4-EtOH 9:1 mixture (pH 6.7)<br>
(700 ml), then 0.15 M AcONH4-EtOH 9:1 mixture (pH 6.7) (700 ml) at a flow rate 30 ml/h.<br>
The fractions containing eremomycin aglycon were combined, acidified with 6 N HC1 to pH 3<br>
and passed through column (2x10 cm) of Dowex 50x2 resin (H+-form), which was washed with<br>
water and eluted with 50 ml of 0.25 N NH4OH. The eluates were concentrated in vacuum with<br>
n-BuOH to minimal volume, acidified whh 0.05 N HC1 to pH 5 and precipitated with 50 ml<br>
acetone. The precipitate was collected, washed with acetone and dried in vacuum to give 310<br>
mg (0.28mmol) oferemomycin aglycon (46.7 %).<br>
Des-(N-methyI-D-leucyl) eremomycin aglycon was obtained from eremomycin aglycon as<br>
described in Miroshnikova, O.V. et al. (Miroshnikova, O.V.; Berdnikova, T.F.; Olsufyeva,<br>
E.N.; Pavlov, AY.; Reznikova, M.I.; Preobrazhenskaya, M.N.; Ciabatti, R.; Malabarba, A.;<br>
Colombo, L. A Modification of the N-Terminal Amino Acid in the Eremomycin Aglycone. J.<br>
Antibiot 1996, 49,1157-1161.<br>
Teicoplanin aglycon was obtained as described in Malabarba, A. et al. (Malabarba, A.; Ferrari,<br>
P.; Gallo, G.G.; Kettenring, J.; Cavalleri, B. Teicoplanin, Antibiotics from Actinoplanes<br>
teichomyceticus nov. sp. VII. Preparation and NMR Characteristics of the Aglycone of<br>
Teicoplanin. J. Antibiotics 1986, 39, 1430-1442). The starting compound N-terminal<br>
phenykhiohydantoin-derivative of teicoplanin aglycon, was obtained by Edman degradation of<br>
teicoplanin aglycon. To a solution of teicoplanin aglycon (100mg, -0.08 mmol) in a mixture of<br>
Py/H2O (6:1, 4 mL), triethyl amine (0.26 mL, 2 mmol) and PhNCS (0.02 mL, ~0.16 mmol)<br>
were added at room temperature under argon. The reaction mixture was stirred for 16 h, then 8<br>
mL of H2O were added and the reaction mixture was evaporated with n-BuOH to dryness. The<br>
precipitate was dissolved in the mixture of TFA-CH2Cl2, 1:1 (3 mL) at 0-5 °C and then was<br>
stirred at this temperature for 1h. Water (3 mL) was then added and the mixture was<br>
neutralized with 25 % NH4OH, washed with EtOAc (3 mL x 3), and the aqueous fraction was<br>
concentrated in vacuum with the addition of n-BuOH and applied to a column of silanized silica<br>
gel (2 x 100 cm), previously equilibrated with 0.01M acetic acid. The column was eluted with<br>
acetic acid (0.01M) at a flow rate of 30 mL/h for elution of compound N-terminal<br>
phenylthiohydantoin-derivative of teicoplanin aglycon. Fractions were pooled, concentrated<br>
with the addition of n-BuOH in vacuum, and acetone (50 mL) was added to yield the<br>
precipitate, which was filtered off, washed with acetone and dried to yield 68 mg (54 %).<br>
The homogeneity, purity and identity of the compounds obtained was assessed by HPLC and,<br>
ESI mass-spectrometry. Analytical reverse phase HPLC was carried out on a Shimadzu HPLC<br>
instrument of the LC 10 series on a Diasorb C16 column (particle size 7 µm) at an injection<br>
volume of 10 mL and a wavelength 280 nm. The sample concentration was 0.05-0.2 mg/mL.<br>
Two systems were used to control the final compounds: System A comprised of 0.1 M<br>
NH4H2PO4 at pH 3.75 and acetonitrile, the proportion of acetonitrile increased linearly from 15<br>
to 40 % within 15 min and then the ratio of acetonitrile was kept constant during 25 min with a<br>
flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. System B comprised of 0.2 % HCOONH4 and 45% acetonitrile, with a<br>
flow rate of 0.07 mL/miaMass spectra were determined by Electrospray Ionisation (ESI) on a<br>

Example 3: Methodology for determination of antiviral (HIV, BVDV, HCV. HSV. VZV, CMV,<br>
FCV. SARS) and cytostatic activity<br>
Anti-HIV activity assays<br>
Inhibition of HIV-1(IIIb, HE, HN) and HIV-2(ROD, EHO, RF)-induced cytopathicity in CEM<br>
or C8166 or Molt4/C8 cells was measured in microtiter 96-well plates containing ~ 3 x 103<br>
CEM cells/ml, infected with 100 CCID50 of HIV per ml and containing appropriate dilutions of<br>
the test compounds. After 4 to 5 days of incubation at 37°C in a CXVcontrolled humidified<br>
atmosphere, CEM, C8166 or Molt4/C8 giant (syncytium) cell formation was examined<br>
microscopically. The EC50 (50% effective concentration) was defined as the concentration of<br>
compound required to inhibit HIV-induced giant cell formation by 50%.<br>
Cytostatic activity assays<br>
All assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates. To each well were added 5 - 7.5 x 104<br>
cells and a given amount of the test compound. The cells were allowed to proliferate for 48 h<br>
(murine leukemia L1210) or 72 h (human lymphocyte CEM and Molt4/clone 8) at 37°C in a<br>
humidified CO2-controlled atmosphere. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were<br>
counted in a Coulter counter. The IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) was defined as the<br>
concentration of the compound that reduced the number of cells by 50%.<br>
Anti-BVDV assay<br>
Cells and viruses: Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) cells were maintained in Dulbecco"s<br>
modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with BVDV-free 5% fetal calf serum<br>
(DMEM-FCS) at 37°C in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere. BVDV-1 (strain PE515) was used<br>
to assess the antiviral activity in MDBK cells. Vero cells (ATCC CCL81) were maintained in<br>
MEM medium supplemented with 10% inactivated calf serum, 1% L-glutamine and 0.3%<br>
bicarbonate.<br>
Anti-BVDV assay: Ninety-six-well cell culture plates were seeded with MDBK cells in DMEM-<br>
FCS so that cells reached 24 hr later confluency. Then medium was removed and serial S-fold<br>
dilutions of the test compounds were added in a total volume of 100 ul, after which the virus<br>
inoculum (100 ul) was added to each well. The virus inoculum used resulted in a greater than<br>
90% destruction of the cell monolayer after 5 days incubation at 37°C. Uninfected cells and<br>
cells receiving virus without compound were included in each assay plate. After 5 days,<br>
medium was removed and 90 ml of DMEM-FCS and 10 ul of MTS/PMS solution (Promega)<br>
was added to each well. Following a 2 hr incubation period at 37°C the optical density of the<br>
wells was read at 498 nm in a microplate reader. The 50% effective concentration (EC50) value<br>
was defined as the concentration of compound that protects 50% of the cell monolayer from<br>
virus-induced cytopathic effect.<br>
Anti-HCV assay/ Replicon assay<br>
Huh-5-2 cells [a cell line with a persistent HCV replicon D891uc-ubi-neo/NS3-3"/5.1; replicon<br>
with firefly luciferase-ubiquitin-neomycin phosphotransferase fusion protein and EMCV-IRES<br>
driven NS3-5B HCV polyprotein] van be cultured in RPMI medium (Gibco) supplemented with<br>
10% fetal calf serum, 2mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies), lx non-essential amino acids<br>
(Life Technologies); 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml G418<br>
(Geneticin, Life Technologies). Cells can be seeded at a different densities, particularly in a<br>
density of 7000 cells per well in 96 well View Plate™ (Packard) in medium containing the<br>
same components as described above, except for G418. Cells than can be allowed to adhere and<br>
proliferate for 24 hr. At that time, culture medium can be removed and serial dilutions of the<br>
test compounds can be added in culture medium lacking G418. Interferon alfa 2a (500 IU) can<br>
be included as a positive control. Plates can further be incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 72<br>
hours. Replication of the HCV replicon in Huh-5 cells results in luciferase activity in the cells.<br>
Luciferase activity is measured by adding 50 ul of 1 x Glo-lysis buffer (Promega) for 15<br>
minutes followed by 50 ul of the Steady-Glo Luciferase assay reagent (Promega). Luciferase<br>
activity can be measured with a luminometer and the signal in each individual well is expressed<br>
as a percentage of the untreated cultures. Parallel cultures of Huh-5-2 cells, seeded at a density<br>
of 7000 cells/ well of classical 96- well cel culture plates (Becton-Dickinson) can be treated in a<br>
similar fashion except that no Go-lysis buffer or Steady-Glo Luciferase reagent is added.<br>
Instead the density of the culture can be measured by means of the MTS method (Promega).<br>
Anti-Coxsackie virus assay<br>
Ninety-six-well cell culture plates can be seeded with Vero cells in DMEM medium containing<br>
10 fetal calf serum (FCS) so that cells reache confluency 24 -48 hr later. Medium can then be<br>
removed and serial S-fold dilutions of the test compounds can be added in a total volume of 100<br>
ul, after which the virus inoculum (100 ml) can be added to each well. The virus inoculum used<br>
results normally in a 90 - 100 % destruction of the cell monolayer after 5 days incubation at<br>
37°C. Uninfected cells and cells receiving virus without compound can be included in each<br>
asay plate. After 5 days, the medium can be removed and 90 ml of DMEM-FCS and 10 ml of<br>
MTS/PMS solution (Promega) was added to each well. Following a 2 h incubation period at<br>
37°C, the optical density of the wells can be read at 498 nm in a microplate reader. The 50%<br>
effective concentration (EC50) value can than be defined as the concentration of compound that<br>
protects 50% of the cell monolayer from virus-induced cytopathic effect.<br>
Anti-Herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus and cytomegalovirus assays<br>
The antiviral assays HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, CMV were based on inhibition of virus-induced<br>
cytopathicity in HEL cell cultures. Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were<br>
inoculated with 100 CCID50 of virus, 1 CCID50 being the virus dose required to infect 50% of<br>
the cell cultures. After a 1- to 2-h virus adsorption period, residual virus was removed, and the<br>
cell cultures were incubated in the presence of varying compound concentrations of the test<br>
compounds. Viral cytopathicity was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control<br>
virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds.<br>
Feline corona virus assay<br>
Feline Crandel kidney cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates at 24,000 cells/well. Then,<br>
24 hrs later, an appropriate inoculum of FCV is added together with 5-fold dilutions of the test<br>
compounds. After 4 days, a MTS/PMS solution was added to each well. Following a 90 rain<br>
incubation period at 37°C, the optical density of the wells was read at 498 nm in a microplate<br>
reader.<br>
SARS virus assay<br>
Vero cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates and grown till confluency. Then, an<br>
appropriate inoculum of SARS virus able to kill the cell culture (cytopathicity) within 72 hrs is<br>
added together with S-fold dilutions of the test compounds. After 3 days, a MTS/PMS solution<br>
was added to each well. Following a 3 hr incubation period at 37°C the optical density of the<br>
wells was read at 498 run in a microplate reader.<br>
Example 4: Evaluation of the anti-HIV activity of the compounds of the invention<br>
A variety of glycopeptide antibiotic derivatives of vancomycin, eremomycin and teicoplanin<br>
including their aglycon derivatives were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against HIV-<br>
1(IIIB) and HIV-2(ROD) in CEM cell cultures.<br>
The vancomycin derivatives 1 and 2 for example were inhibitory to HIV-1 at an EC50 of 5.5 and<br>
12 mM, respectively. The eremomycin derivative 5 proved very inhibitory to HIV-1 replication<br>
(EC50:0.43 mM) being cytotoxic against the CEM cells at a 100-fold higher concentration (IC50:<br>
40 mM).<br>
As another example, the eremomycin aglycon derivatives 6 to 8 all invariably inhibited both<br>
HIV-1 and HIV-2 at EC50 values ranging between 3.5 and 12 mM. This is at compound<br>
concentrations that were at least 15- to 20-fold lower than required for the eremomycin<br>
aglycon. They were non-toxic (IC50 ) 100 mM for CEM cells). The Des-(N-methyl-D-leucyl)-<br>
eremomycin aglycon 9 was also active against HIV (13-20 mM) and not toxic at 250 mM<br>
(Scheme 1, Table 1).<br>
Further examples are antibiotic A40 926 derivatives 10 to 14 containing no N"-acyl substituent<br>
and mannose moiety at ring 6 which also displayed anti-HIV-1 activity between 3.5 and 12 mM.<br>
Other examples are the teicoplanin aglycon derivatives which showed pronounced anti-HIV-1<br>
and anti-HIV-2 activity, often with a trend of being slightly more active against HIV-1 than<br>
HIV-2. The most active congeners were inhibitory against HIV-1 in the range of 1.3 to 4.5 mM<br>
(compounds 15,19, 21,22, 25, 27,31,23,35-40,42 and 52). A number of them, i.e. 52,31,19,<br>
15 were not cytotoxic at 100-500 mM. This means that the most selective compounds 19 and 31<br>
had selectivity indices (ratio IC50/EC50) that were = 200. The teicoplanin aglycon showed also<br>
anti-HIV activity, but the derivatives showed an improved activity over the unsubstituted<br>
teicoplanin aglycon (ECjo: 17-20 mM; IC50: &gt; 500 µM).<br>
Further examples comprise compounds 53 and 54 that lack the ring systems 1 and 3 and have<br>
only two macroring structures showed activity against HIV-1 and HIV-2 at an EC50 between 17<br>
and 37 uM. Also, compound 55 showed an antiviral activity of 13 and 17 µM against HIV-1<br>
and HIV-2, respectively<br>
It is clear that in general, the aglycon derivatives of vancomycin, eremomycin and teicoplanin<br>
gain anti-HIV activity compared to their glycosylated parent compounds. Also, substituents on<br>
the aglycons of vancomycin, eremomycin and teicoplanin that increase the lipophilicity of the<br>
aglycon derivatives, also markedly increase the anti-HIV activity of the compounds. In some<br>
cases, just the simple aglycon showed already measurable anti-HIV activity, but hydrophobic<br>
derivatives were, as a rule, markedly more (10- to 100-fold) inhibitory to HIV. Among the<br>
teicoplanin derivatives, both low hydrophobic and highly hydrophobic compounds showed<br>
prominent anti-HIV activity.<br>
Seven compounds (6,19,30,31,35, 46 and 51) were evaluated against a variety of HIV strains<br>
in different cell lines, and it was found that they all maintained a similar antiviral potency<br>
regardless of the nature of the cell line or virus strain.<br>
A time of addition experiment was performed for the highly selective compound 30. Compound<br>
30, like the virus adsorption inhibitor dextran sulfate, cannot be added later than 1 h post<br>
infection without significant loss of antiviral activity. In contrast, administration of a reverse<br>
transcriptase inhibitor (AZT, zidovudine) could be delayed for at least 3 hours without loosing<br>
its antiviral activity. A very early event in the replication (infection) cycle of HIV is the<br>
antiviral target for these glycopeptide antibiotics and novel antibiotic derivatives. In agreement<br>
with these observations, it is an important noting that the compounds kept their antiviral<br>
efficacy against HIV-1 strains that contain mutations in the reverse transcriptase that result in<br>
resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs).<br>
Extensive attempts (= 9 weeks) to select resistant virus strains against 15, 19 and 35 failed<br>
under experimental conditions that easily resulted in the emergence of nucleoside RT inhibitors<br>
(NRTI)- (ie. lamivudine) or NNRTI- (i.e. nevirapine) resistant virus strains.<br>
In conclusion, novel classes of modified antibiotics have been discovered that were active and<br>
selective against HIV in cell culture. The most active members of these antibiotic derivatives<br>
had an EC50 of 1-3 µM and were non-toxic in cell culture (IC50 = 200-500 µM). Their antiviral<br>
mechanism of action is located at an early event in the infection cycle of HIV (most likely<br>
adsorption and/or fusion), and is clearly different from the molecular mechanism of antibacterial <br>
activity. The compounds efficiently suppress drug-resistant HIV-1 strains, and<br>
resistance development in cell culture is difficult to engender. Therefore, the (lipophilic)<br>
aglycon antibiotic derivatives are important new antiretroviral compounds for the treatment of<br>
HIV infections. In addition, their early intervention in the infection cycle of HIV also make<br>
these compounds potential candidate drugs for prevention of HIV spread [i.e. as a microbicide<br>
when given locally (i.e. intravaginally)].<br>

Example 8. Evaluation of the compounds for their anti-viral activity against many other<br>
virusses (BVDV. HSV. FCV. CMV. VZV. SARS virus, etc.)<br>
Several virusses are inhibited by antibiotics that still contained a sugar moiety. For example the<br>
vancomycine derivative, 59 was endowed with a marked anti-VZV activity (EC50: 0.87-0.89<br>
µM) at a concentration that was &gt; 50-fold lower than its cytostatic concentration, and S- to 20-<br>
fold lower than its cytotoxic concentration (5 to 7 day assay). Compound 1 showed some<br>
antiviral activity against feline and human corona virus (FCV) and SARS virus (ECso: 30-43<br>
uM). As an example, the eremomycin derivatives (3-5 and 60-87), 68, 76, 77 and 81 showed<br>
activity (EC50: 0.7-7 µM) against VZV. Compound 5, 63 and 64 were active against FCV in<br>
Feline Crandel Kidney cells (FCK) with a selectivity of S to 10 and 86 and 87 proved clearly<br>
active against BVDV. The teicoplanin derivatives 89 and 90 were for example active against<br>
VZV (EC50: 1.1 and 50 µM, respectively).<br>
A variety of lipophylic aglycon derivatives of vancomycine, eremomycin, ristomycin, DA40,<br>
and teicoplanin have also been made and tested. The vancomycin type aglycons showed<br>
pronounced activity against VZV and FCV (i.e. compounds 6, 7, 8, 98 (VZV) and compounds<br>
5, 7, 9, 13, 99, 100, 101 and 109 (FCV). Compound 98, for example was also endowed with<br>
anti-herpes virus activity (EC50 HSV-1 and HSV-2: 24 µM). Teicoplanin aglycons showed also<br>
activity against VZV (i.e. 113, 121-128, 137, 143, 145, 146), HSV (i.e. 132 and 146 against<br>
both HSV-1 and HSV-2), BVDV (i.e. 126) and FCV (i.e. 125,157-163,165-167). All antiviral<br>
activities were observed at subtoxic concentrations in the respective cell cultures. Also<br>
teicoplanin aglycon derivatives with eliminated ammo acids 1 and 3, with a disrupted bond<br>
between amino acids 1 and 2, or with a disrupted bond between amino acids 6 and 7 showed<br>
activity against FCV. It should be noticed that all compounds that were active against the two<br>
wild-type VZV strains, showed also an equal inhibitory effect against two thymidine kinase-<br>
deficient (strains 07/1 and YS/R) VZV strains. Further examples of anti-viral activity include<br>
the anti-CMV activity of for example compounds 21, 25, 26, 27,31, 59,124 and 125.<br>
In conclusion, among the glycopeptide antibiotic derivatives studied, many compounds showed<br>
inhibitory activity against several DNA viruses (i.e. herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus and<br>
varicella-zoster virus) and RNA viruses [i.e. HIV, BVDV (a virus that belongs to the same<br>
family as hepatitis C virus), and FCV (a feline corona virus that belongs to the same family as<br>
the human SARS corona virus)]. Moreover, most compounds that were found active against<br>
FCV were also inhibitory against the SARS virus.<br>
