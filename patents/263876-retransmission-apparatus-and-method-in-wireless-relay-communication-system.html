RETRANSMISSION APPARATUS AND METHOD IN<br>
WIRELESS RELAY COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for performing<br>
Automatic Retransmission reQuest (ARQ) in a wireless communication system, and in<br>
particular, to an apparatus and method for performing ARQ in a multihop relay<br>
wireless communication system.<br>
Background Art<br>
Wireless data communications are subject to error depending on a channel condition<br>
of a radio resource interval. Error control and recovery technologies can be divided<br>
largely into Automatic Retransmission reQuest (ARQ) scheme and Frame Error Check<br>
(FEC) scheme. ARQ scheme requests retransmission of the errored data to a<br>
transmitter. FEC scheme corrects the error of corrupted data.<br>
Particularly, in the ARQ scheme, error check result (e.g., Cyclic Redundancy Check<br>
(CRC)) has to be transmitted from a receiver to a transmitter. For instance, when the<br>
transmitter initially sends a packet, the receiver decodes the received packet. When the<br>
packet is not corrupted, the receiver sends Acknowledgment (ACK) signal to the<br>
transmitter. When the packet is corrupted, the receiver sends Negative Ac-<br>
knowledgement (NACK) signal to the transmitter.<br>
Upon receiving the ACK signal, the transmitter sends a new packet. When receiving<br>
the NACK signal, the transmitter retransmits the previous packet.<br>
In general, two retransmission schemes are utilized for stable data transfer in the<br>
wireless communication system. One is Media Access Control (MAC) ARQ in MAC<br>
layer, and the other is Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) in the physical (PHY) layer. In the<br>
following, the conventional MAC ARQ scheme is described.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a conventional signal exchange procedure according to the ARQ<br>
scheme in a wireless communication system using an analog repeater (hereafter,<br>
referred to as a repeater).<br>
The conventional wireless communication system includes one or more Base<br>
Stations (BSs), one or more repeaters, and one or more terminals. For a better un-<br>
derstanding, BS 10, repeater 11, and terminal 12 are shown. It is assumed that two<br>
Protocol Data Units (PDUs) of the MAC layer are transmitted from BS 10 to terminal<br>
12, and that terminal 12 receives data via repeater 11.<br>
In FIG. 1, BS 10 generates one physical layer data (PHY DATA 1) with two MAC<br>
PDUs and sends it to repeater 11 in step 101. MAC PDU, which is the data<br><br>
transmission unit of the MAC layer, includes MAC header, payload containing real<br>
data, and an error check code (e.g., CRC code) for checking error of the payload. PHY<br>
DATA includes at least one MAC PDU.<br>
Repeater 11 merely amplifies the amplitude of the PHY DATA 1 signal received<br>
from BS 10 and relays the amplified data to terminal 12 in step 103.<br>
Tenninal 12 decomposes the MAC PDUs in the PHY DATA 1 received from<br>
repeater 11 and checks error with respect to each MAC PDU in step 105. The error is<br>
checked using the error check code (CRC code) of the MAC PDU. Terminal 12<br>
generates an error check code with the payload of the received MAC PDU and<br>
determines whether there exists error by comparing the generated error check code<br>
with the received error check code. In doing so, it is assumed that MAC PDU 2 among<br>
the decomposed MAC PDUs is corrupted.<br>
When MAC PDU 1 is errorless and MAC PDU 2 is incorrect among the received<br>
data, terminal 12 sends a control message for responding to MAC PDU 1 with ACK<br>
and MAC PDU 2 with NACK to repeater 11 in step 107. Repeater 11 amplifies the<br>
signal amplitude of the control message received from terminal 12 and relays the<br>
amplified message to BS 10 in step 109.<br>
BS 10 recognizes the retransmission-requested MAC PDU by analyzing the control<br>
message from repeater 11 in step 109. That is, BS 10 recognizes the retransmission<br>
request of MAC PDU 2. Accordingly, BS 10 generates PHY RETRANSMISSION<br>
DATA with the retransmission-requested MAC PDU 2 and sends it to repeater 11 in<br>
step 111. Repeater 11 amplifies the signal amplitude of PHY RETRANSMISSION<br>
DATA from BS 11 and relays the amplified data to tenninal 12 in step 113. As such,<br>
terminal 12 requests the retransmission of the incorrect data to BS 11 via repeater 11<br>
and receives the retransmission data via repeater 11.<br>
As discussed above, the repeater in the wireless communication system functions to<br>
amplify and relay the analog signals transmitted and received between the BS and the<br>
terminal. However, since the repeater currently developed has both the MAC layer and<br>
the PHY layer, it can interpret messages transceived between the transmitter and<br>
receiver. Thus, the mere signal amplification and relay may be quite inefficient.<br>
Therefore, what is needed is an ARQ method using an improved repeater in the<br>
wireless communication system.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described herein below with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well-known<br>
functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the<br>
invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
The present invention provides a technique for performing Automatic Re-<br>
transmission reQuest (ARQ) in a wireless relay communication system. Herein, the<br>
ARQ is Media Access Control (MAC) ARQ applied in MAC layer or Hybrid ARQ<br>
applied in physical (PHY) layer.<br>
A relay station (RS) receives data from a transmitter and relays the received data to a<br>
receiver. When communication with the transmitter is not smooth, the receiver can<br>
receive data from the transmitter using the RS. A plurality of RSs may reside within a<br>
cell. A provider can install the RS or a user terminal can function as the RS. The RS is<br>
divided into a reception part for receiving a signal from the transmitter and a<br>
transmission part for transmitting a signal to the receiver. The transmission part and the<br>
receiving part work independently of each other. Yet, it is assumed that data queues of<br>
the transmitting part and the receiving part are shared internally.<br><br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a wireless relay communication system according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
In FIG. 2, Mobile Station (MS) 170 belonging to a service coverage 151 of Base<br>
Station (BS) 150 receives service in a directional link to BS 150. However, MS 170,<br>
which travels on the edge (in the cell boundary) of the service coverage of BS 150, is<br>
subject to a poor channel condition and thus cannot provide a high-speed data channel.<br>
Hence, BS 150 provides a high-speed data channel to the MS under the poor channel<br>
condition among MSs belonging to service coverage 151 of BS 150 by way of Relay<br>
Station (RS) 160. Since MS 170 belongs to service coverage 151 of BS 150, it receives<br>
a control signal and a low-speed data channel through the direct link to BS 150. In<br>
addition, MS 170 receives a high-speed data channel from BS 150 via RS 160.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a system for retransmitting a downlink (DL) signal in a wireless<br>
relay communication system according to the present invention. It is assumed that BS<br>
200 has n-ary data to be sent to MS 220, and that BS 200 is able to transmit k-ary data<br>
at one time.<br>
BS 200 of FIG. 3 sends schedule information (e.g., DL MAP) for transmitting DL<br>
data to RS 210 and MS 220 in step 230. For instance, BS 200 sends the scheduling in-<br>
formation to RS 210. Next, RS 210 relays the scheduling information received from<br>
BS 200 to MS 220. Alternatively, BS 200 sends the scheduling information to MS 220.<br>
In this case, RS 210 can listen to the scheduling information transmitted from BS 200<br>
to MS 220.<br>
In step 231, BS 200 transmits k-ary data of n-ary data to RS 210 according to the<br>
scheduling information.<br>
When receiving the data from BS 200 through a receiving part 212 in step 233, RS<br>
210 checks data error using Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) code of the data in step<br>
235. If j-ary data are errored among the k-ary data, RS 210 stores (k-j&gt;ary errorless<br>
data to its data queue in step 237. RS 210 does not store the j-ary errored data.<br>
In step 239, RS 210 sends ACK/NACK control message to the BS 210 in response to<br>
the received data. Specifically, RS 210 sends ACK control message relating to the<br>
correctly received data and NACK control message relating to the incorrect data to BS<br>
200.<br>
The RS can construct the ACK/NACK control message as shown in Table 1.<br>
Table 1<br><br><br>
The ACK/NACK control message includes Connection ID (CID) of RS which sends<br>
the ACK/NACK control message, ACK type for designating a response type, Block<br>
Sequence Number (BSN) for designating a sequence number of ARQ block, and ACK<br>
MAP for designating reception success or reception failure for each ARQ block when<br>
the response type is selective. The CID is RS ID or ID of a specific service provided to<br>
the RS. The BS identifies the RS and the service using the CID. The ACK type<br>
includes a selective method or a cumulative method. There may be other kinds of ACK<br>
type.<br>
BS 200 sends scheduling information (e.g., DL MAP) to RS 210 and MS 220 in step<br>
241. For instance, BS 200 sends the scheduling information to RS 210. Next, RS 210<br>
relays the scheduling information received from BS 200 to MS 220. Alternatively, BS<br>
200 sends the scheduling information to MS 220. In this case, RS 210 can listen to the<br>
scheduling information transmitted from BS 200 to MS 220.<br>
A transmission part 214 of RS 210 transmits data in the data queue to MS 220<br>
according to the scheduling information provided from BS 200 in step 247. In other<br>
words, RS 210 forwards the data successfully received from BS 200 to MS 220<br>
according to the scheduling information.<br>
Independent of transmission part 214, receiving part 212 of RS 210 receives data or<br>
retransmission data from BS 200 in steps 243 ~ 245. BS 200 recognizes the j-ary<br>
incorrect data from the ACK/NACK control message received from RS 210. Next, BS<br>
200 retransmits the j-ary corrupted data in step 243. In doing so, BS 200 transmits not<br>
only the retransmission data but also (k-j)-ary data among (N-k)-ary new data<br>
remaining in its data queue to RS 210.<br>
Receiving the data from BS 200, receiving part 212 of RS 210 checks whether the<br>
received data is corrupted or not by examining the CRC code of the received data. If<br>
the received data is errorless, the data is stored in the data queue. Next, BS 200 and RS<br>
210 repeat the above process until N-ary data stored in the data queue of BS 200 is<br><br>
successfully received at RS 210 in step 245.<br>
When receiving the data from transmitting part 214 of RS 210 in step 249, MS 220<br>
checks the error by examining the CRC code of the data in step 251. If p-ary data of<br>
the received data is corrupted, MS 220 sends ACK control message with respect to the<br>
errorless data and NACK control message with respect to the incorrect data to BS 220<br>
in step 253. In doing so, MS 220 can transmit the ACK/NACK control message<br>
directly to BS 200. Alternatively, MS 220 can transmit the ACK/NACK control<br>
message to BS 200 by way of RS 210.<br>
The MS can construct the ACK/NACK control message as shown in Table 2.<br>
Table 2<br>
[Table 2]<br><br>
The ACK/NACK control message includes CID of MS which sends the ACK/NACK<br>
control message, ACK type for designating a response type, BSN for designating a<br>
sequence number of ARQ block, and ACK MAP for designating reception success or<br>
reception failure for each ARQ block when the response type is selective. The CID is<br>
MS ID or ID of a specific service provided to the MS. That is, the BS identifies the MS<br>
and the service using the CID.<br>
By checking the ACK/NACK control message received from MS 220, BS 200<br>
confirms the incorrect data and the errorless data among the data received at MS 220.<br>
Next, BS 200 sends information relating to the incorrect data to RS 210 in step 255. In<br>
detail, BS 200 sends NACK indication message containing the information relating to<br>
the incorrect data to RS 210.<br>
The BS can construct the NACK indication message as shown in Table 3.<br>
Table 3<br><br><br>
The NACK indication message includes MS service CID to be retransmitted by the<br>
RS, the number of ARQ blocks to be retransmitted, and BSN for designating sequence<br>
numbers of the retransmitted ARQ blocks.<br>
When performing the ARQ of the MAC layer, the BS sends the NACK indication<br>
message constituted as shown in Table 3 to the RS.<br>
When performing the HARQ, the BS generates NACK indication message including<br>
MS sendee CID to be retransmitted by the RS, HARQ Channel ID (ACID) information<br>
indicative of a unique number of HAQR data channel to represent unique sequence<br>
values of data blocks to be retransmitted, and Sub Packet ID (SPED) indicative of<br>
unique numbers of sub data blocks within the ACID, and then sends the generated<br>
NACK indication message to the RS.<br>
Next, BS 200 sends scheduling information (e.g., DL MAP) to RS 210 and MS 220<br>
in step 257. For instance, BS 200 sends the scheduling information to RS 210. RS 210<br>
relays the scheduling information provided from BS 200 to MS 220. Alternatively, BS<br>
200 sends the scheduling information to MS 220. In this case, RS 210 can listen to the<br>
scheduling information transmitted from BS 200 to MS 220.<br>
RS 210 checks the incorrect data at MS 220 from the NACK indication message<br>
provided from BS 200. In step 259, RS 210 retransmits the corrupted data to MS 220<br>
according to the scheduling information provided from BS 200. At mis time, RS 210<br>
transmits not only the retransmission data but also new data remaining in its data queue<br>
to MS 220.<br>
Upon receiving the data from transmission part 214 of RS 210 in step 261, MS 220<br>
checks whether error occurs by examining the CRC code of the data in step 263. If the<br>
received data is incorrect, MS 220 requests the retransmission of the corrupted data to<br>
BS200.<br>
Next, MS 220 repeats the above process until all data in the data queue of RS 210 are<br><br>
received in step 265.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a system for retransmitting DL signal in a wireless relay com-<br>
munication system according to the present invention. It is assumed that BS 300 has N-<br>
ary data to be sent to MS 320 and is capable of transmitting k-ary data at one time.<br>
In FIG. 4, BS 300 sends schedule information (e.g., DL MAP) for transmitting DL<br>
data to RS 310 and MS 320 in step 330. For instance, BS 300 sends the scheduling in-<br>
formation to RS 310. Next, RS 310 relays the scheduling information received from<br>
BS 300 to MS 320. Alternatively, BS 300 sends the scheduling information to MS 320.<br>
In this case, RS 310 can listen to the scheduling information transmitted from BS 300<br>
to MS 320.<br>
In step 331, BS 300 transmits k-ary data of N-ary data to RS 310 according to the<br>
scheduling information.<br>
When receiving the data from BS 300 through a receiving part 312 in step 333, RS<br>
310 checks data error using CRC code of the data in step 335. If j-ary data are<br>
corrupted among the k-ary data, RS 310 stores (k-j)-ary errorless data to its data queue<br>
in step 337. RS 310 does not store the j-ary corrupted data.<br>
In step 339, RS 310 sends ACK/NACK control message to BS 310 in response to the<br>
received data. Specifically, RS 310 sends ACK control message relating to the<br>
correctly received data and NACK control message relating to the errored data to BS<br>
300. RS 310 constitutes the ACK/NACK control message as shown in Table 1 and<br>
transmits the generated message to BS 300.<br>
BS 300 sends scheduling information (e.g., DL MAP) to RS 310 and MS 320 in step<br>
341. For instance, BS 300 sends the scheduling information to RS 310. Next, RS 310<br>
relays the scheduling information received from BS 300 to MS 320. Alternatively, BS<br>
300 sends the scheduling information to MS 320. In this case, RS 310 can listen to the<br>
scheduling information transmitted from BS 300 to MS 320.<br>
A transmitting part 314 of RS 310 transmits data in the data queue to MS 320<br>
according to the scheduling information provided from BS 300 in step 347. In other<br>
words, RS 310 forwards the data successfully received from BS 300 to MS 320<br>
according to the scheduling information.<br>
Independent of the transmitting part 314, a receiving part 312 of RS 310 receives<br>
data or retransmission data from BS 300 in steps 343 ~ 345. BS 300 recognizes the j-<br>
ary corrupted data from the ACK/NACK control message provided from RS 310.<br>
Next, BS 300 retransmits the j-ary corrupted data in step 343. In doing so, BS 300<br>
transmits not only the retransmission data but also (k-j)-ary data among (N-k)-ary new<br>
data remaining in its data queue to RS 310.<br>
Receiving the data from BS 300, receiving part 312 of RS 310 checks whether the<br>
received data is corrupted or not by examining the CRC code of the received data. If<br><br>
the received data is errorless, the data is stored in the data queue. Next, BS 300 and RS<br>
310 repeat the above process until N-ary data stored to the data queue of BS 300 is<br>
successfully received at RS 310 in step 345.<br>
When receiving the data from transmitting part 314 of RS 310 in step 349, MS 320<br>
checks the error by examining the CRC code of the data in step 351. If p-ary data of<br>
the received data is corrupted, MS 320 sends ACK control message with respect to the<br>
errorless data and NACK control message with respect to the errored data to BS 300 in<br>
step 353. In doing so, MS 320 can transmit the ACK/NACK control message directly<br>
to BS 300. Alternatively, MS 320 can transmit the ACK/NACK control message to BS<br>
300 by way of RS 310. MS 320 can constitute the ACK/NACK control message as<br>
shown in Table 2 and transmit it to BS 300.<br>
By checking the ACK/NACK control message received from MS 320, BS 300<br>
confirms the corrupted data and the errorless data among the data received at MS 320.<br>
Next, BS 300 sends information relating to whether the data sent from RS 310 to MS<br>
320 is corrupted, to RS 310 in step 355. Specifically, BS 300 sends ACK/NACK<br>
indication message containing the information as to the errorless data and the in-<br>
formation as to the incorrect data to RS 310. The ACK/NACK indication message<br>
from BS 300 can include ACK/NACK information relating to the data as shown in<br>
Table 1.<br>
Next, BS 300 sends scheduling information (e.g., DL MAP information) to RS 310<br>
and MS 320 in step 357. For instance, BS 300 sends the scheduling information to RS<br>
310. RS 310 relays the scheduling information provided from BS 300 to MS 320. Al-<br>
ternatively, BS 300 sends the scheduling information to MS 320. In this case, RS 310<br>
can listen to the scheduling information transmitted from BS 300 to MS 320.<br>
RS 310 checks the data corrupted at MS 320 from the ACK/NACK indication<br>
message provided from BS 300. In step 359, RS 310 retransmits the corrupted data to<br>
MS 320 according to the scheduling information provided from BS 300. At this time,<br>
RS 310 transmits not only the retransmission data but also new data remaining in its<br>
data queue to MS 320.<br>
When receiving the information as to the data correctly received at MS 320, RS 310<br>
discards the corresponding data from the data queue.<br>
Upon receiving the data from transmitting part 314 of RS 310 in step 361, MS 320<br>
checks whether error occurs by examining the CRC code of the data in step 363. If the<br>
received data is corrupted, MS 320 requests the retransmission of the corrupted data to<br>
BS300.<br>
Next, MS 320 repeats the above process until all data in the data queue of RS 310 are<br>
received in step 365.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a system for retransmitting DL signal in a wireless relay com-<br><br>
munication system according to the present invention. It is assumed that BS 400 has N-<br>
aiy data to be sent to MS 420 and is able to transmit k-ary data at one time.<br>
In FIG. 5, BS 400 sends schedule information (e.g., DL MAP) for transmitting DL<br>
data to RS 410 and MS 420 in step 430. For instance, BS 400 sends the scheduling in-<br>
formation to RS 410. Next, RS 410 relays the scheduling information provided from<br>
BS 400 to MS 420. Alternatively, BS 400 sends the scheduling information to MS 420.<br>
In this case, RS 410 can listen to the scheduling information transmitted from BS 400<br>
to MS 420.<br>
In step 431, BS 400 transmits k-ary data of N-ary data to RS 410 according to the<br>
scheduling information.<br>
When receiving the data from BS 400 through a receiving part 412 in step 433, RS<br>
410 checks data error using CRC code of the data in step 435. If j-ary data are incorrect<br>
among the k-ary data, RS 410 stores (k-j)-ary errorless data to its data queue in step<br>
437. RS 410 does not store the j-ary corrupted data.<br>
In step 439, RS 410 sends ACK/NACK control message relating to the received data<br>
to BS 410. Specifically, RS 410 sends ACK control message relating to the correctly<br>
received data and NACK control message relating to the corrupted data to BS 400. RS<br>
410 constitutes the ACK/NACK control message as shown in Table 1 and transmits<br>
the generated message to BS 400.<br>
BS 400 sends scheduling information (e.g., DL MAP) to RS 410 and MS 420 in step<br>
441. For instance, BS 400 sends the scheduling information to RS 410. Next, RS 410<br>
relays the scheduling information received from BS 400 to MS 420. Alternatively, BS<br>
400 sends the scheduling information to MS 420. In this case, RS 410 can listen to the<br>
scheduling information transmitted from BS 400 to MS 420.<br>
A transmitting part 414 of RS 410 transmits data in the data queue to MS 420<br>
according to the scheduling information provided from BS 400 in step 447. In other<br>
words, RS 410 forwards the data successfully received from BS 400 to MS 420<br>
according to the scheduling information.<br>
Independent of transmitting part 414, a receiving part 412 of RS 410 receives data or<br>
retransmission data from BS 400 in steps 443 ~ 445. BS 400 recognizes the j-ary<br>
corrupted data from the ACK/NACK control message provided from RS 410. Next, BS<br>
400 retransmits the j-ary corrupted data in step 443. In doing so, BS 400 transmits not<br>
only the retransmission data but also (k-j)-ary data among (N-k)-ary new data<br>
remaining in its data queue to RS 410.<br>
Receiving the data from BS 400, receiving part 412 of RS 410 checks whether the<br>
received data is corrupted or not by examining the CRC code of the received data. If<br>
the received data is errorless, the data is stored to the data queue. Next, BS 400 and RS<br>
410 repeat the above process until N-ary data stored to the data queue of BS 400 is<br><br>
successfully received at RS 410 in step 445.<br>
When receiving the data from transmitting part 414 of RS 410 in step 449, MS 420<br>
checks the error by examining the CRC code of the data in step 451. If p-ary data of<br>
the received data is corrupted, MS 420 sends ACK control message with respect to the<br>
errorless data and NACK control message with respect to the incorrect data to BS 400<br>
in step 453. In doing so, MS 420 can transmit the ACK/NACK control message to BS<br>
400 by way of RS 410. Alternatively, MS 420 can transmit the ACK/NACK control<br>
message directly to BS 400. If MS 420 sends the ACK/NACK control message directly<br>
to BS 400, RS 410 can listen to the ACK/NACK control message. Specifically,<br>
assuming that RS 410 can determine the radio source (e.g., channel) information<br>
allocated to transmit the ACK/NACK control message from MS 420 to BS 400, RS<br>
410 can receive the ACK/NACK control message using the radio resource. The ACK/<br>
NACK control message can be constituted as shown in Table 2.<br>
By checking the ACK/NACK control message received from MS 420, BS 400<br>
confirms the corrupted data and the errorless data among the data received at MS 420.<br>
Next, BS 400 sends scheduling information to RS 410 and MS 420 in step 455. For<br>
instance, BS 400 sends the scheduling information to RS 410. RS 410 relays the<br>
scheduling information provided from BS 400 to MS 420. Alternatively, BS 400 sends<br>
the scheduling information to MS 420. In this case, RS 410 can listen to the scheduling<br>
information transmitted from BS 400 to MS 420.<br>
Upon receiving the scheduling information from BS 400, RS 410 retransmits the data<br>
corrupted at MS 420 to MS 420 in step 457. At this time, RS 410 transmits not only<br>
the retransmission data but also new data remaining in its data queue to MS 420.<br>
Also, upon receiving the scheduling information from BS 400, RS 410 discards the<br>
data not corrupted at MS 420 among the data stored in the data queue.<br>
When receiving the data from transmitting part 414 of RS 410 in step 459, MS 420<br>
checks whether error occurs by examining the CRC code of the data in step 461. If the<br>
received data is corrupted, MS 420 requests the retransmission of the corrupted data to<br>
BS400.<br>
Next, MS 420 repeats the above process until all data in the data queue of RS 410 are<br>
received in step 463.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates a system for retransmitting an uplink (UL) signal in a wireless relay<br>
communication system according to the present invention. It is assumed that MS 520<br>
has N-ary data to be sent to BS 500 and is able to transmit k-ary data at one time.<br>
In FIG. 6, BS 520 sends schedule information (e.g., UL MAP) for transmitting UL<br>
data to RS 510 and MS 500 in step 530. For instance, BS 520 sends the scheduling in-<br>
formation to RS 510. Next, RS 510 relays the scheduling information received from<br>
BS 520 to MS 500. Alternatively, BS 520 sends the scheduling information to MS 500.<br><br>
In this case, RS 510 can listen to the scheduling information transmitted from BS 520<br>
to the MS 500.<br>
In step 531, MS 500 transmits k-ary data of N-ary data to RS 510 according to the<br>
scheduling information.<br>
When receiving the data from MS 500 through a receiving part 512 in step 533, RS<br>
510 checks data error using CRC code of the data in step 535. If j-ary data are<br>
corrupted among the k-ary data, RS 510 stores (k-j)-ary errorless data to its data queue<br>
in step 537. RS 510 does not store the j-ary corrupted data.<br>
In step 539, RS 510 sends ACK/NACK in response to the received data to BS 520.<br>
RS 510 sends the ACK control message relating to the correctly received data and the<br>
NACK control message relating to the corrupted data to BS 520. BS 520 forwards the<br>
ACK/NACK control message from RS 510 to MS 500 in step 541.<br>
BS 520 sends scheduling information (e.g., UL MAP) to RS 510 and MS 500 in step<br>
543. For instance, BS 520 sends the scheduling information to RS 510. Next, RS 510<br>
relays the scheduling information received from BS 520 to MS 500. Alternatively, BS<br>
520 sends the scheduling information to MS 500. In this case, RS 510 can listen to the<br>
scheduling information transmitted from BS 520 to MS 500.<br>
Receiving part 512 of RS 510 receives data or retransmission data from MS 500 in<br>
steps 545 ~ 547. MS 500 recognizes the j-ary corrupted data among the data sent to RS<br>
510 from the ACK/NACK control message provided from BS 520.<br>
Hence, MS 500 retransmits the j-ary corrupted data to RS 510 according to the<br>
scheduling information provided from BS 520 in step 545. In doing so, MS 500<br>
transmits not only the retransmission data but also (k-j)-ary data among (N-k)-ary new<br>
data remaining in its data queue to RS 510.<br>
Receiving part 512 of RS 510 checks whether the data is corrupted by examining<br>
CRC code of the data received from MS 500. If the data is correctly received, the data<br>
is stored in the data queue of RS 510. Next, MS 500 and RS 510 repeat the above<br>
process until N-ary data stored to the data queue of MS 500 are successfully received<br>
at RS 510 in step 547.<br>
Independent of the receiving part 512, transmitting part 514 of RS 510 sends the data<br>
in the data queue to BS 520 according to the scheduling information provided from BS<br>
520 in step 549. That is, RS 510 transmits the data successfully received from MS 500<br>
to BS 520 based on the scheduling information.<br>
Receiving the data from transmitting part 514 of RS 510 in step 551, BS 520 checks<br>
error by examining CRC code of the data in step 553.<br>
In step 555, BS 520 sends scheduling information (e.g., UL MAP) to RS 510 and MS<br>
500. When sending the scheduling information to RS 510, BS 520 adds NACK<br>
indication message containing the information as to the corrupted data. Although it is<br><br>
not shown in FIG. 6, if BS 520 does not forward the ACK/NACK control message<br>
received from RS 510 to MS 500 in step 541, BS 520 can transmit the scheduling in-<br>
formation and the ACK/NACK control message provided from RS 510 to MS 500 in<br>
step 555. BS 520 can constitute the ACK/NACK control message from RS 510 as<br>
shown in Table 2 and send it to MS 500.<br>
RS 510 confirms the data corrupted at BS 520 based on the scheduling information<br>
containing the NACK indication message received from BS 520. Next, RS 510 re-<br>
transmits the corrupted data to BS 520 according to the scheduling information in step<br>
557. RS 510 sends not only the retransmission data but also new data remaining its<br>
data queue to BS 520.<br>
Upon receiving the data from transmitting part 514 of RS 510 in step 559, BS 520<br>
checks error by examining CRC code of the data in step 561. If the received data is<br>
corrupted, BS 520 requests retransmission of the corrupted data to RS 510.<br>
BS 520 repeats the above process until all data in the data queue of RS 510 are<br>
received in step 563.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates a system for retransmitting UL signal in a wireless relay com-<br>
munication system according to the present invention. It is assumed that BS 620 has N-<br>
ary data to be sent to MS 600 and is able to transmit k-ary data at one time.<br>
In FIG. 7, BS 620 sends schedule information (e.g., UL MAP) for transmitting UL<br>
data to RS 610 and MS 600 in step 630. For instance, BS 620 sends the scheduling in-<br>
formation to RS 610. Next, RS 610 relays the scheduling information received from<br>
BS 620 to MS 600. Alternatively, BS 620 sends the scheduling information to MS 600.<br>
In this case, RS 610 can listen to the scheduling information transmitted from BS 620<br>
to MS 600.<br>
In step 631, MS 600 transmits k-ary data of N-ary data to RS 610 according to the<br>
scheduling information.<br>
When receiving the data from MS 600 through a receiving part 612 in step 633, RS<br>
610 checks data error using CRC code of the data in step 635. If j-ary data are<br>
corrupted among the k-ary data, RS 610 stores (k-j)-ary errorless data to its data queue<br>
in step 637. RS 610 does not store the j-ary corrupted data.<br>
In step 639, RS 610 sends ACK/NACK to BS 620 in response to the received data.<br>
RS 610 sends the ACK control message relating to the correctly received data and the<br>
NACK control message relating to the corrupted data to BS 620. BS 620 forwards the<br>
ACK/NACK control message from RS 610 to MS 600 in step 641.<br>
BS 620 sends scheduling information (e.g., UL MAP) to RS 610 and MS 600 in step<br>
643. For instance, BS 620 sends the scheduling information to RS 610. Next, RS 610<br>
relays the scheduling information received from BS 620 to MS 600. Alternatively, BS<br>
620 sends the scheduling information to MS 600. In this case, RS 610 can listen to the<br><br>
scheduling information transmitted from BS 620 to MS 600.<br>
Receiving part 612 of RS 610 receives data or retransmission data from MS 600 in<br>
steps 645 ~ 647. MS 600 recognizes the j-ary corrupted data among the data sent to RS<br>
610 from the ACK/NACK control message provided from BS 620.<br>
Hence, MS 600 retransmits the j-ary corrupted data to RS 610 according to the<br>
scheduling information provided from BS 620 in step 645. In doing so, MS 600<br>
transmits not only the retransmission data but also (k-j)-ary data among (N-k)-ary new<br>
data remaining in its data queue to RS 610.<br>
Receiving part 612 of RS 610 checks whether the data is corrupted by examining<br>
CRC code of the data received from MS 600. If the data is correctly received, the data<br>
is stored to the data queue of RS 610. Next, MS 600 and RS 610 repeat the above<br>
process until N-ary data stored to the data queue of MS 600 are successfully received<br>
at RS 610 in step 647.<br>
Independent of receiving part 612, transmitting part 614 of RS 610 sends the data in<br>
the data queue to BS 620 according to the scheduling information provided from BS<br>
620 in step 649. That is, RS 610 forwards the data successfully received from MS 600<br>
to BS 620 based on the scheduling information.<br>
Receiving the data from transmitting part 614 of RS 610 in step 651, BS 620 checks<br>
error by examining CRC code of the data in step 653.<br>
In step 655, BS 620 sends scheduling information (e.g., UL MAP) to RS 610 and MS<br>
600. When sending the scheduling information to RS 610, BS 620 adds ACK/NACK<br>
indication message containing the information as to the corrupted data and the in-<br>
formation as to the errorless data into the ACK/NACK indication message. Although it<br>
is not shown in FIG. 7, if BS 620 does not forward the ACK/NACK control message<br>
received from RS 610 to MS 600 in step 641, BS 620 can transmit the scheduling in-<br>
formation and the ACK/NACK control message provided from RS 610 to MS 600 in<br>
step 655. BS 620 can constitute the ACK/NACK control message of RS 610 as shown<br>
in Table 2 and send it to MS 600.<br>
RS 610 confirms the data corrupted at BS 620 based on the scheduling information<br>
containing the ACK/NACK indication message received from BS 620. Next, RS 610<br>
retransmits the corrupted data to BS 620 according to the scheduling information in<br>
step 657. RS 610 sends the retransmission data together with new data remaining its<br>
data queue to BS 620.<br>
Upon receiving the data from transmitting part 614 of RS 610 in step 659, BS 620<br>
checks error by examining CRC code of the data in step 661. If the received data is<br>
corrupted, BS 620 requests retransmission of the corrupted data to RS 610.<br>
BS 620 repeats the above process until all data in the data queue of RS 610 are<br>
received in step 663.<br><br>
FIG. 8 illustrates a system for retransmitting UL signal in a wireless relay com-<br>
munication system according to the present invention. It is assumed that MS 700 has<br>
N-ary data to be sent to BS 720 and is able to transmit k-ary data at a time.<br>
In FIG. 8, BS 720 sends schedule information (e.g., UL MAP) for transmitting UL<br>
data to RS 710 and MS 700 in step 730. For instance, BS 720 sends the scheduling in-<br>
formation to RS 710. Next, RS 710 relays the scheduling information received from<br>
BS 720 to MS 700. Alternatively, BS 720 sends the scheduling information to MS 700.<br>
In this case, RS 710 can listen to the scheduling information transmitted from BS 720<br>
to MS 700.<br>
In step 731, MS 700 transmits k-ary data of N-ary data to RS 710 according to the<br>
scheduling information.<br>
Upon receiving the data from MS 700 at a receiving part 712 in step 733, RS 710<br>
checks data error using CRC code of the data in step 735. If j-ary data are corrupted<br>
among the k-ary data, RS 710 stores (k-j)-ary errorless data to its data queue in step<br>
737.<br>
In step 739, RS 710 sends ACK/NACK in relation to the received data to BS 720. In<br>
detail, RS 710 sends the ACK control message relating to the correctly received data<br>
and the NACK control message relating to the corrupted data to BS 720.<br>
BS 720 sends scheduling information (e.g., UL MAP) to RS 710 and MS 700 in step<br>
743. For instance, when RS 710 sends the ACK control message to BS 720, BS 720<br>
sends ACK control message to MS 700 in step 741. BS 720 also sends data scheduling<br>
information to RS 710. RS 710 forwards the data provided from MS 700 to BS 720<br>
according to the data scheduling information. When RS 710 sends the NACK control<br>
message to BS 720, BS 720 sends NACK control message to MS 700 in step 741.<br>
Also, BS 720 sends scheduling information for the data retransmission to MS 700.<br>
Receiving part 712 of RS 710 receives data or retransmission data from MS 700 in<br>
steps 745 - 747. MS 700 recognizes the j-ary corrupted data among the data sent to RS<br>
710 based on the ACK/NACK control message provided from BS 720.<br>
Hence, MS 700 retransmits the j-ary corrupted data to RS 710 according to the<br>
scheduling information provided from BS 720 in step 745.<br>
Receiving part 712 of RS 710 checks whether the data is corrupted by examining<br>
CRC code of the data received from MS 700. If the data is correctly received, the data<br>
is stored in the data queue of RS 710. When the data is corrupted, RS 710 requests re-<br>
transmission of the corrupted data to MS 700 via BS 720.<br>
Next, MS 700 and RS 710 repeat the above process until N-ary data stored to the<br>
data queue of MS 700 are successfully received at RS 710 in step 747.<br>
Independent of receiving part 712, transmitting part 714 of RS 710 sends the data in<br>
the data queue to BS 720 according to the scheduling information provided from BS<br><br>
720 in step 749. That is, RS 710 forwards the data successfully received from MS 700<br>
to BS 720 based on the scheduling information.<br>
Receiving the data from the transmitting part 714 of RS 710 in step 751, BS 720<br>
checks the error by examining CRC code of the data in step 753.<br>
Assuming that p-ary data of the received data is corrupted, BS 720 sends ACK<br>
control message relating to the correctly received data and NACK control message<br>
relating to the p-ary errored data to RS 710 in step 755. If BS 720 does not forward the<br>
ACK/NACK control message provided from RS 710 to MS 700 in step 741, BS 720<br>
can send the ACK/NACK control message provided from RS 710 to MS 700 in step<br>
755. BS 720 can constitute the ACK/NACK control message as shown in Table 2 and<br>
send it to MS 700.<br>
In step 757, BS 720 sends scheduling information (e.g., UL MAP) to RS 710 and MS<br>
700.<br>
RS 710 confirms the corrupted data sent to BS 720 based on the ACK/NACK control<br>
message provided from BS 720. Next, RS 710 retransmits the corrupted data to BS 720<br>
according to the scheduling information provided from BS 720 in step 759. RS 710<br>
transmits the retransmission data together with new data remaining in its data queue to<br>
BS 720.<br>
Upon receiving the data from transmitting part 714 of RS 710 in step 761, BS 720<br>
checks for errors by examining CRC code of the data in step 763. If the received data<br>
is corrupted, BS 720 requests retransmission of the corrupted data to RS 710.<br>
BS 720 repeats the above process until all data in the data queue of RS 710 are<br>
received in step 765.<br>
FIGs. 9 to 11 are state transition diagrams of a transmitter according to the present<br>
invention. The transmitter represents BS in the DL and MS in the UL. Yet, the<br>

Referring first to FIG. 9, data in Tx. Que 800 indicates that data to be sent from the<br>
transmitter to RS is stored in the queue. When data is transmitted to the RS in Data in<br>
Tx. Que 800, the transmitter transits to Wait R-ACK 801 and waits to receive ACK/<br>
NACK message from the RS.<br>
When receiving NACK message in relation with part or all of the transmitted data<br><br>
from the RS in Wait R-ACK 801, the transmitter shifts to Waiting for Retransmission<br>
804. After moving to Waiting for Retransmission 804, the transmitter retransmits the<br>
retransmission-requested data to the RS and returns to Wait R-ACK 801.<br>
] When receiving ACK message in relation with the transmitted data from the RS in<br>
Wait R-ACK 801, the transmitter transits to Wait ACK 802 and waits to receive ACK/<br>
NACK message from the receiver. The ACK/NACK message received from the<br>
receiver contains information as to whether the data transmitted from the RS to the<br>
receiver are corrupted or not<br>
| After receiving ACK message in relation with part or all of the data transmitted by<br>
the RS from the receiver in Wait ACK 802, the transmitter transits to Done 805 and<br>
completes the transmission of the successfully sent data. At this time, the transmitter<br>
stops a lifetimer with respect to the data transmitted to the receiver.<br>
| After completing the data transmission to the receiver, the transmitter transits to Data<br>
Discard 803 and discards the transmitted data from the data queue.<br>
| In case that the NACK message is received from the receiver with respect to part or<br>
all of the data transmitted by the RS in Wait ACK 802, the transmitter shifts to Waiting<br>
for NACK indication transmission 806. Next, the transmitter sends NACK indication<br>
message to the RS and returns to Wait ACK 802.<br>
| Each data has a lifetimer. When the continual retransmission fails and a preset<br>
lifetimer expires, the transmitter shifts to Data Discard 803 and discards the cor-<br>
responding data from the queue.<br>
In FIG. 10, data in Tx. Que 800 indicates that data to be sent from the transmitter to<br>
the RS is stored in the queue. When data is transmitted to the RS in Data in Tx. Que<br>
800, the transmitter moves to Wait R-ACK 801 and waits to receive ACK/NACK<br>
message from the RS.<br>
When receiving NACK message with respect to part or all of the transmitted data<br>
from the RS in Wait R-ACK 801, the transmitter shifts to Waiting for Retransmission<br>
804. Next, the transmitter retransmits the retransmission-requested data to the RS and<br>
returns to Wait R-ACK 801.<br>
In the mean time, when receiving ACK message in relation with the transmitted data<br>
in Wait R-ACK 801, the transmitter moves to Wait ACK 802 and waits to receive<br>
ACK/NACK message from the receiver. The ACK/NACK message received from the<br>
receiver contains information as to whether the data sent from the RS to the receiver<br>
are corrupted or not.<br>
Receiving ACK message from the receiver in relation to all of the data transmitted by<br>
the RS in Wait ACK 802, the transmitter shifts to Done 805 and completes the<br>
transmission of the successfully received data. At this time, the transmitter stops the<br>
lifetimer in relation with the data completely transmitted to the receiver.<br><br>
Upon completing the data transmission to the receiver, the transmitter shifts to Data<br>
Discard 803 and discards the completed data from the data queue.<br>
After receiving NACK message with respect to part or all of the data transmitted by<br>
the RS or ACK message with respect to part of the transmitted data from the receiver<br>
in Wait ACK 802, the transmitter shifts to Waiting for ACK/NACK indication<br>
transmission 806. Next, the transmitter sends ACK/NACK indication message to the<br>
RS and goes back to Wait ACK 802. Hie transmitter shifts from Waiting for ACK/<br>
NACK indication transmission to Data Discard 803 to discard the data corresponding<br>
to the ACK message among the data sent from the RS to the receiver.<br>
Each data has its lifetimer. Accordingly, when the continual retransmission fails and<br>
a preset lifetimer expires, the transmitter transits to Data Discard 803 and discards the<br>
corresponding data from the queue.<br>
In FIG. 11, data in Tx. Que 800 indicates that data to be sent from the transmitter to<br>
the RS is stored in the queue. When data is transmitted to the RS in Data in Tx. Que<br>
800, the transmitter moves to Wait R-ACK 801 and waits to receive ACK/NACK<br>
message from the RS.<br>
After receiving NACK message from the RS with respect to part or all of the<br>
transmitted data in Wait R-ACK 801, the transmitter shifts to Waiting for Re-<br>
transmission 804. Next, the transmitter retransmits the retransmission-requested data to<br>
the RS and returns to Wait R-ACK 801.<br>
When receiving ACK message with respect to the transmitted data from the RS in<br>
Wait R-ACK 801, the transmitter shifts to Wait ACK 802 and waits to receive ACK/<br>
NACK message from the receiver. The ACK/NACK message received from the<br>
receiver contains information as to whether the data received from the RS to the<br>
receiver are corrupted or not<br>
When receiving the ACK message from the receiver with respect to part or all of the<br>
data transmitted by the RS in Wait ACK 802, the transmitter shifts to Done 80S and<br>
completes the transmission of the data successfully received at the receiver. In doing<br>
so, the transmitter stops the lifetimewith respect to the completed transmission of data<br>
to the receiver.<br>
Upon completing the data transmission to the receiver, the transmitter moves to Data<br>
Discard 803 and discards the completely transmitted data from the queue.<br>
If NACK message is received from the receiver with respect to part or all of the data<br>
transmitted by the RS in the Wait ACK 802, the transmitter stays in Wait ACK 802.<br>
Each data block has a life timer. Accordingly, when the continual retransmission fails<br>
and a preset life timer expires, the transmitter shifts to Data Discard 803 and discards<br>
the corresponding data blocks.<br>
FIG. 12 is a state transition diagram of a receiver according to the present invention.<br><br>
The receiver is MS in the downlink and BS in the uplink. ARQ state of the receiver<br>
includes Wait Data 900, Data Decoding 902, and Done 904.<br>
Wait Data 900 of FIG. 12 is the state for waiting to receive data from RS. Upon<br>
receiving data from the RS in Wait Data 900, the receiver shifts to Data Decoding 902<br>
and decodes the received data. In doing so, the receiver determines whether the data is<br>
corrupted by checking CRC of the data.<br>
When the data is not corrupted, the receiver transmits ACK message to the<br>
transmitter and shifts to Done 904. When part or all of the data is corrupted, the<br>
receiver sends NACK message to the transmitter and returns to Wait Data 900.<br>
FIGs. 13 to 15 are state transition diagrams of RS according to the present invention.<br>
ARQ state of the RS can be divided to Tx mode and Rx mode. Rx mode includes Wait<br>
Data 1000, Data Decoding 1001, and Store in RS Rx. Que 1002. Tx mode includes<br>
Data in RS Tx. Que 1003, Wait ACK/NACK indication 1004, Data Discard 1005,<br>
Waiting for Retransmission 1006, and Done 1007.<br>

transition diagram of the RS of FIGs. 4 and 7, and FIG. 15 is the state transition<br>
diagram of the RS of FIGs. 5 and 8.<br>
Wait data 1000 in FIG. 13 is the state for wailing to receive data from the transmitter.<br>
When receiving data from the transmitter in Wait Data 1000, the RS shifts to Data<br>
Decoding 1001 and decodes the received data. In doing so, the RS determines whether<br>
the data is corrupted by checking CRC of the data.<br>
When the data is not corrupted, the RS sends ACK message to the BS, shifts to Store<br>
Data in RS Rx. Que 1002, and stores the successfully received data to in Rx queue.<br>
When part or all of the data is corrupted, the RS sends NACK message to the BS and<br>
returns to Wait Data 1000.<br>
To relay the data stored in the Rx queue to the receiver, the RS duplicates the data to<br>
Tx queue and shifts to Data in RS Tx. Que 1003. If the Rx queue and the Tx queue are<br>
physically separated, the RS duplicates the data stored to the Rx queue into the Tx<br>
queue. If the Rx queue and Tx queue are unified, the RS does not duplicate the data.<br>
After transitioning to Data in RS Tx. Que 1003, the RS sends the data stored to the<br>
Tx queue to the receiver and operates a life timer. Next, the RS shifts to Wait NACK<br>
indication 1004 and waits to receive NACK indication message from the BS. The<br>
NACK indication message received from the BS contains information relevant to the<br>
occurrence of error in the data sent from the RS to the receiver.<br>
When receiving NACK indication message from the BS in Wait NACK indication<br>
1004, the RS shifts to Waiting for Retransmission 1006. Next, the RS retransmits data<br>
corresponding to the NACK indication message to the receiver and goes back to Wait<br>
ACK indication 1004.<br><br>
The data has a life timer. Accordingly, when continual retransmission fails and a<br>
preset life timer expires, the RS shifts to Data Discard 1005 and discards the cor-<br>
responding data from the queue. As such, the RS retransmits the data to the receiver<br>
under the control of the BS.<br>
Wait Data in FIG. 14 is the state for waiting to receive data from the transmitter.<br>
Upon receiving data from the transmitter in Wait Data 1000, the RS shifts to Data<br>
Decoding 1001 and decodes the received data. In doing so, the RS determines whether<br>
the data is corrupted or not by checking CRC of the data.<br>
When the data is correctly received, the RS sends ACK message to the BS, shifts to<br>
Store Data in RS Rx. Que 1002, and stores the successfully received data to Rx queue.<br>
When part or all of the data is corrupted, the RS sends NACK message to the BS and<br>
returns to Wait Data 1000.<br>
The RS duplicates the data to Tx queue to relay the data stored to Rx queue to the<br>
receiver, and then transitions to Data in RS Tx. Que 1003. If the Rx queue and the Tx<br>
queue are physically separated, the RS duplicates the data stored to the Rx queue into<br>
the Tx queue. If the Rx queue and Tx queue are unified, the RS does not duplicate the<br>
data.<br>
After transitioning to Data in RS Tx. Que 1003, the RS sends the data stored to the<br>
Tx queue to the receiver and operates a life timer. Next, the RS shifts to Wait ACK/<br>
NACK indication 1004 and waits to receive ACK/NACK indication message from the<br>
BS. The ACK/NACK indication message received from the BS contains information<br>
relevant to the occurrence of error in the data sent from the RS to the receiver.<br>
When receiving ACK indication message from the BS in Wait ACK/NACK<br>
indication 1004, the RS shifts to Done 1007 and completes the transmission of the data<br>
successfully received at the receiver. In doing so, the RS stops the life timer with<br>
respect to the data completely transmitted to the receiver.<br>
When the data transmission to the receiver is completed, the RS shifts to Data<br>
Discard 1005 and discards the successfully transmitted data from the queue.<br>
Meanwhile, after receiving NACK indication message from the BS in Wait ACK/<br>
NACK indication 1004, the RS shifts to Waiting for Retransmission 1006. Next, the<br>
RS retransmits the data blocks corresponding to the NACK indication message to the<br>
receiver and goes back to Wait ACK/NACK indication 1004.<br>
Each data has a life timer. Accordingly, when the continual retransmission fails and a<br>
preset life timer expires, the RS shifts to Data Discard 1005 and discards the cor-<br>
responding data from the queue. As such, the RS retransmits data to the receiver under<br>
the control of the BS.<br>
Wait Data in FIG. 15 is the state for waiting to receive data from the transmitter.<br>
Upon receiving data in Wait Data 1000, the RS moves to Data Decoding 1001 and<br><br>
decodes the received data. In doing so, the RS determines whether the data is corrupted<br>
by checking CRC of the data.<br>
When the data is correctly received, the RS sends ACK message to the BS, moves to<br>
Store Data in RS Rx. Que 1002, and stores the successfully received data to Rx queue.<br>
When part or all of the data is corrupted, the RS sends NACK message to the BS and<br>
returns to Wait Data 1000.<br>
The RS duplicates the data to Tx queue to relay the data stored to the Rx queue to the<br>
receiver and men shifts to Data in RS Tx. Que 1003. If the Rx queue and the Tx queue<br>
are physically separated, the RS duplicates the data stored to the Rx queue into the Tx<br>
queue. If the Rx queue and Tx queue are unified, the RS does not duplicate the data.<br>
After transiting to Data in RS Tx. Que 1003, the RS sends the data stored to the Tx<br>
queue to the receiver and operates a life timer. Next, the RS shifts to Wait ACK 1004<br>
and waits to receive ACK/NACK message from the receiver. The ACK/NACK<br>
message is ACK/NACK message transmitted from the receiver to the transmitter. At<br>
this time, assuming that the RS knows radio resource information for sending ACK/<br>
NACK message from the receiver to the transmitter, the RS receives the ACK/NACK<br>
message transmitted from the receiver to the transmitter using the resource in-<br>
formation.<br>
When receiving the ACK message with respect to the data sent to the receiver in<br>
Wait ACK 1004, the RS shifts to Done 1007 and completes the transmission of the<br>
successfully received data. The RS stops the life timer in relation with the data.<br>
Upon completing the data transmission to the receiver, the RS moves to Data Discard<br>
1005 and discards the data successfully received at the receiver.<br>
By contrast, when receiving the NACK message in relation to the data sent to the<br>
receiver in Wait ACK 1004, the RS transits to Waiting for Retransmission 1006. Next,<br>
the RS, upon receiving MAP message from the BS, retransmits the data corresponding<br>
to the NACK message to the receiver and goes back to Wait ACK 1004.<br>
Each data has a life timer. Accordingly, when the continual retransmission fails and a<br>
preset life timer expires, the RS shifts to Data Discard 1005 and discards the cor-<br>
responding data from the queue.<br>
FIG. 16 illustrates a retransmission method in the wireless relay communication<br>
system according to the present invention and particularly, the wireless communication<br>
method for the retransmission using the RS of FIGs. 3 and 4.<br>
Among data stored in the data queue in step 1111, transmitter 1100 of FIG. 16<br>
transmits data to RS 1102 in step 1113. In doing so, transmitter 1100 operates a timer<br>
to check a lifetime of the transmitted data.<br>
When receiving the data from transmitter 1100 in the waiting state, RS 1102 decodes<br>
the received data and checks whether the data is corrupted using CRC code in step<br><br>
1115. When the data is corrupted, RS 1102 sends NACK control message to<br>
transmitter 1100 in step 1117. Although not shown in FIG. 16, when the data is not<br>
corrupted, RS 1102 sends ACK control message to transmitter 1100.<br>
Upon receiving the NACK control message from RS 1102 in step 1119, RS 1102 re-<br>
transmits the data corresponding to the NACK control message to RS 1102 in step<br>
1121. Transmitter 1100 can send new data stored to the data queue together with the<br>
retransmission data to RS 1102.<br>
Receiving the retransmission data from transmitter 1100, RS 1102 decodes the data<br>
and checks the error occurrence using CRC code in step 1123. When the data has no<br>
error, RS 1102 sends ACK control message to transmitter 1100 in step 1125 and stores<br>
the errorless data to the data queue of RS 1102. Although not shown in FIG. 16, when<br>
the data is corrupted, RS 1102 sends NACK control message to transmitter 1100.<br>
Receiving the ACK control message from RS 1102, transmitter 1100 waits to receive<br>
ACK/NACK control message from receiver 1104 in step 1127.<br>
The transmitting part of RS 1102 sends the data stored in the data queue in step 1127<br>
to receiver 1104 in step 1131. In doing so, RS 1102 operates a timer to check a lifetime<br>
of the transmitted data.<br>
Upon receiving the data from RS 1102, the receiver 1104 decodes the data and<br>
checks for errors in step 1133.<br>
When the data is found to be incorrect, receiver 1104 sends NACK control message<br>
to transmitter 1100 in step 1135.<br>
Receiving the NACK control message from receiver 1104, transmitter 1100 checks<br>
whether the data transmitted from RS 1102 to receiver 1104 is corrupted in step 1127.<br>
Next, transmitter 1100 sends information as to whether the data sent from RS 1102 to<br>
receiver 1104 is corrupted and ACK/NACK indication message to RS 1102 in step<br>
1137. For instance, transmitter 1100 sends the information relating to the re-<br>
transmission-requested data and the ACK/NACK indication message to RS 1102 as<br>
shown in FIG. 3. Alternatively, the transmitter sends the errorless data and the in-<br>
formation relating to the retransmission-requested data to RS 1102 as shown in FIG. 4.<br>
RS 1102 confirms the corrupted data sent to receiver 1104 based on the NACK<br>
indication message provided from transmitter 1100. Next, RS 1102 retransmits the<br>
corrupted data to receiver 1104 in steps 1139 - 1143. RS 1102 can send the re-<br>
transmission data together with new data stored in the data queue to receiver 1104.<br>
After receiving the information as to the errorless data from transmitter 1100, RS<br>
1102 discards the errorless data from the data queue. Specifically, receiving the in-<br>
formation as to the errorless data from transmitter 1100 as shown in FIG. 4, RS 1102<br>
discards the errorless data from the data queue; not receiving the information as to the<br>
errorless data as shown in FIG. 3, RS 1102 discards the data from the data queue when<br><br>
the timer of the data expires.<br>
Upon receiving the retransmission data from RS 1102, receiver 1104 decodes the<br>
data and checks for errors in step 1145. When the data is correctly received, receiver<br>
1104 sends ACK control message to transmitter 1100 in step 1147.<br>
Transmitter 1100, receiving the ACK control message from the receiver, terminates<br>
the data transmission, the data retransmission, and the timer operation, and then<br>
discards the data sent to RS 1102 and receiver 1104 from the data queue in step 1149.<br>
FIG. 17 illustrates a retransmission method in the wireless relay communication<br>
system according to the present invention and particularly, the wireless communication<br>
method for the retransmission using the RS of FIG. 5.<br>
Of data stored in the data queue in step 1211, transmitter 1200 of FIG. 17 sends data<br>
transmittable at a time to RS 1202 in step 1213. In doing so, transmitter 1200 operates<br>
a timer to check a lifetime of the transmitted data.<br>
Upon receiving the data from transmitter 1200 in the waiting state, RS 1201 decodes<br>
the received data and checks the data for errors using CRC code in step 1215. When<br>
the data is corrupted, RS 1201 sends NACK control message to transmitter 1200 in<br>
step 1217. Although not shown in FIG. 17, when the data is correctly received, RS<br>
1201 sends ACK control message to the transmitter.<br>
Upon receiving the NACK control message from RS 1202 in step 1219, transmitter<br>
1200 retransmits the data corresponding to the NACK control message to RS 1202 in<br>
step 1221. In doing so, transmitter 1200 can transmit the retransmission data together<br>
with new data stored in the data queue to RS 1202.<br>
Receiving the retransmission data from transmitter 1200, RS 1202 decodes the data<br>
and checks the data for errors using the CRC code in step 1223. When the data is<br>
correctly received, RS 1202 sends ACK control message to transmitter 1200 in step<br>
1225 and stores the errorless data to its data queue. Although not shown in FIG. 17,<br>
when the data is corrupted, RS 1202 sends NACK control message to transmitter 1200.<br>
After receiving the ACK control message from RS 1202, transmitter 1200 waits to<br>
receive ACK/NACK control message from receiver 1204 in step 1227.<br>
The transmitting part of RS 1202 sends the data stored in the data queue in step 1229<br>
to receiver 1204 in step 1231. In doing so, RS 1202 operates the timer to check the<br>
lifetime of the transmitted data.<br>
Upon receiving the data from RS 1202, receiver 1204 decodes the data and checks<br>
for error in step 1233.<br>
When the data is corrupted, receiver 1204 sends NACK control message to<br>
transmitter 1200 in step 1235. RS 1202 recognizes the corrupted data transmitted to<br>
receiver 1204 by listening to the ACK/NACK control message sent from receiver 1204<br>
to transmitter 1200.<br><br>
Receiving the NACK control message from receiver 1204, the transmitter 1200<br>
checks whether the data sent from RS 1202 to the receiver 1204 is corrupted or not in<br>
step 1227.<br>
Next, RS 1202, upon receiving scheduling information from transmitter 1200, sends<br>
the corrupted data of the data received at receiver 1204 to receiver 1204 in steps 1237<br>
~ 1239. RS 1202 can transmit the retransmission data together with new data stored to<br>
the data queue to receiver 1204.<br>
When receiving the data from RS 1202, receiver 1204 decodes the data and checks<br>
for errors in step 1241. When the data is correctly received, receiver 1204 sends ACK<br>
control message to transmitter 1200 in step 1243. In doing so, RS 1202 stops the data<br>
transmission, the data retransmission, and the timer operation by listening to the ACK<br>
control message sent from receiver 1204 to transmitter 1200. Also, RS 1202 discards<br>
the data successfully received at receiver 1204 from the data queue in step 1245.<br>
Upon receiving the ACK control message from receiver 1204, the transmitter stops<br>
the data transmission, the data retransmission, and the timer operation. Also, the<br>
transmitter 1200 discards the data successfully received at receiver 1204 via RS 1202<br>
from the data queue in step 1247.<br>
FIG. 18 is a flow chart of retransmission operations of the RS according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
RS of FIG. 18 receives data from the transmitter and decodes the data in step 1301.<br>
After decoding the data, the RS checks for the occurrence of errors from the CRC<br>
code of the decoded data in step 1303.<br>
When the data is corrupted, the RS sends NACK control message relating to the<br>
corrupted data to the BS in step 1307. The RS returns to step 1301 and receives re-<br>
transmission data from the transmitter in response to the NACK control message. For<br>
instance, in case of the downlink, the BS retransmits data corresponding to the NACK<br>
control message received from the RS to the RS. In case of the uplink, the BS relays<br>
the NACK control message provided from the RS to the MS. Next, the MS retransmits<br>
the data corresponding to the NACK control message of the RS provided from the BS<br>
to the RS.<br>
By contrast, when the data is correctly received, the RS sends ACK control message<br>
in relation to the errorless data to the BS in step 1305.<br>
After sending the ACK control message, the RS stores the errorless data in its data<br>
queue in step 1309.<br>
In step 1311, the RS sends the data stored in the data queue to the receiver.<br>
After sending the data, the RS checks whether ACK indication message is received<br>
from the transmitter in step 1313.<br>
When the ACK indication message is received from the BS, the RS determines the<br><br>
completion of the data transmission to the receiver corresponding to the ACK<br>
indication message in step 1315. Thus, the RS terminates the data transmission and the<br>
data retransmission. The RS discards the completed data transmission to the receiver<br>
from the data queue.<br>
Next, the RS terminates this process.<br>
In contrast, when the NACK indication message is received from the BS, the RS<br>
determines the data error corresponding to the NACK indication message and checks<br>
whether the lifetime of the data has expired in step 1317.<br>
When the lifetime of the data has not expired, the RS retransmits to the receiver the<br>
data corresponding to the NACK indication message in step 1311. In doing so, the RS<br>
can transmit the retransmission data together with new data stored in the data queue of<br>
the receiver.<br>
When the lifetime of the data has expired, the RS discards the data corresponding to<br>
the NACK indication message from the data queue in step 1319.<br>
Next, the RS terminates this process.<br>
FIG. 19 is a flow chart of retransmission operations of the RS according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
RS of FIG. 19 receives data from the transmitter and decodes the data in step 1401.<br>
After decoding the data, the RS checks the data for the occurrence of errors from<br>
CRC code of the decoded data in step 1403.<br>
When the data is corrupted, the RS sends NACK control message (R-NACK which<br>
inferred Relay NACK) in relation to the corrupted data to the BS in step 1407. Next,<br>
the RS returns to step 1401 and receives retransmission data from the transmitter in<br>
response to the NACK control message. For instance, in case of the downlink, the BS<br>
retransmits data corresponding to the NACK control message provided from the RS to<br>
the RS. In case of the uplink, the BS relays the NACK control message provided from<br>
the RS to the MS. The MS retransmits data corresponding to the NACK control<br>
message of the RS provided from the BS to the RS.<br>
When the data is correctly received, the RS sends ACK control message(R-ACK<br>
which inferred Relay ACK) to the transmitter in step 1405 and stores the errorless data<br>
in its data queue in step 1409.<br>
In step 1411, the RS sends to the receiver the data stored in the data queue.<br>
After sending the data to the receiver, the RS examines the information indicating the<br>
occurrence of error in the data by checking whether ACK control message is received<br>
from the receiver in step 1413. For instance, in case of the downlink, the RS examines<br>
the information indicating the occurrence of error in the data sent to the MS by<br>
listening to ACK/NACK control message transmitted from the MS to the BS.<br>
In case of the uplink, the RS examines the information indicating the occurrence of<br><br>
error in the data sent to the BS by receiving ACK/NACK control message from the BS.<br>
Upon receiving the ACK control message from the receiver, the RS determines the<br>
completion of the data transmission to the receiver corresponding to the ACK control<br>
message in step 1415. Thus, the RS terminates the transmission and the retransmission<br>
of the data successfully received at the receiver. Also, the RS discards the data<br>
completely transmitted to the receiver from the data queue.<br>
Next, the RS terminates this process.<br>
In contrast, when the NACK control message is received from the receiver, the RS<br>
determines the data error corresponding to the NACK control message and checks<br>
whether the lifetime of the data has expired in step 1417.<br>
When the lifetime of the data has not expired, the RS retransmits the data cor-<br>
responding to the NACK control message to the receiver in step 1411. In doing so, the<br>
RS can transmit the retransmission data together with new data stored in the data queue<br>
to the receiver.<br>
When the lifetime of the data has expired, the RS discards the data corresponding to<br>
the NACK control message from the data queue in step 1419.<br>
Next, the RS terminates this process.<br>
Now, the structure of the RS for the retransmission is described. FIG. 20 is a block<br>
diagram of the RS for performing ARQ of the MAC layer in the wireless com-<br>
munication system, and FIG. 21 is a block diagram of the RS performing HARQ of the<br>
PFIY layer in the wireless communication system.<br>
FIG. 20 is a block diagram of the RS for the retransmission according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
The RS of FIG. 20 includes an antenna part 1501, a receiving part 1503, a<br>
transmitting part 1505, and ARQ part 1507.<br>
Antenna part 1501 controls to share a single antenna by receiving part 1503 and<br>
transmitting part 1505. There may be two or more receiving parts 1503 and two or<br>
more transmitting parts 1505.<br>
Receiving part 1503 includes Radio Frequency (RF) receiver 1511, PHY layer<br>
decoder 1513, MAC PDU decoder 1515, and MAC payload decoder 1517.<br>
RF receiver 1511 down-converts a high-frequency signal received from the<br>
transmitter through antenna part 1501 to a baseband signal.<br>
PHY layer decoder 1513 interprets PHY layer data in the baseband signal fed from<br>
RF receiver 1511.<br>
MAC PDU decoder 1515 analyzes the header of the data fed from PHY layer<br>
decoder 1513 and checks whether the data is corrupted. For instance, MAC PDU<br>
decoder 1515 includes MAC header detector 1521, MAC CRC checker 1523, and<br>
MAC payload detector 1525. MAC header detector 1521 determines whether the<br><br>
payload of the MAC PDU contains control information or traffic by analyzing the<br>
header of the MAC PDU fed from PHY layer decoder 1513.<br>
MAC CRC checker 1523 checks for the occurrence of error in the payload of the<br>
MAC PDU using the error check code (e.g., CRC) of the MAC PDU. In doing so,<br>
MAC CRC checker 1523 reports the error occurrence information of the MAC PDU<br>
payload to ARQ part 1505.<br>
MAC payload detector 1525 detects the payload from the MAC PDU. MAC payload<br>
detector 1525 detects only the payload, which is errorless at MAC CRC checker 1523,<br>
from the MAC PDUs.<br>
When the errorless payload contains control information, MAC PDU decoder 1515<br>
provides the payload to MAC control message decoder 1531 of MAC payload decoder<br>
1517.<br>
When the payload does not contain control information, MAC PDU decoder 151<br>
provides the payload to Rx data queue 1533 of MAC payload decoder 1517.<br>
MAC payload decoder 1517 includes the MAC control message decoder 1531 and<br>
the Rx data queue 1533.<br>
MAC control message decoder 1531 interprets the control message contained in the<br>
errorless payload of the MAC PDU fed from MAC PDU decoder 1515. MAC control<br>
message decoder 1531 reports ARQ related control message such as ACK or NACK in<br>
the interpreted control message to ARQ part 1507.<br>
Rx data queue 1533 stores the traffic contained in the errorless payload of the MAC<br>
PDU provided from MAC PDU decoder 1515. The data stored in Rx data queue 1533<br>
is duplicated and stored into Tx data queue 1571 under the control of ARQ part 1507.<br>
While the Rx data queue 1533 and the Tx data queue 1571 are separately illustrated,<br>
they can share a single device.<br>
Transmitting part 1505 includes RF transmitter 1551, PHY layer encoder 1553,<br>
MAC PDU encoder 1555, and MAC payload encoder 1557.<br>
MAC payload encoder 1557 generates MAC payload with the data stored to Tx data<br>
queue 1571 and outputs the generated MAC payload to MAC PDU encoder 1555.<br>
MAC payload encoder 1557 also generates and outputs MAC control message such as<br>
ACK/NACK under the control of ARQ part 1507.<br>
MAC PDU encoder 1555 generates the MAC payload fed from the MAC payload<br>
encoder 1557 as MAC PDU of the same form as the data received from the transmitter<br>
using ACK type or BSN information of the data, which is received from the transmitter<br>
and provided from ARQ part 1507. That is, transmitting part 1505 sends the MAC<br>
PDU of the same form as in the transmitter to the receiver.<br>
PHY layer encoder 1553 generates PHY layer data with the MAC PDU fed from<br>
MAC PDU encoder 1555.<br><br>
RF transmitter 1551 up-converts the PHY layer data of the baseband fed from PHY<br>
layer encoder 1553 to a high-frequency signal and outputs the high-frequency signal.<br>
ARQ part 1507 includes ARQ state machine 1541, ARQ timer 1543, and ARQ<br>
controller 1545.<br>
ARQ state machine 1541 manages ARQ state with respect to the retransmitted data.<br>
Specifically, ARQ state machine 1541 manages the lifetimer of the transmitted data.<br>
ARQ controller 1545 controls the overall ARQ operation in association with ARQ<br>
state machine 1541 and ARQ timer 1543. For instance, when receiving a response<br>
message for the MAC PDUs sent to the receiver, ARQ controller 1545 analyzes the<br>
response messages and retransmits data corresponding to NACK. ARQ controller 1545<br>
controls to discard data corresponding to ACK from Tx data queue 1571.<br>
Also, ARQ controller 1545 controls the data retransmission of the RS. Specifically,<br>
ARQ controller 1545 controls transmitting part 1503 to send ACK/NACK message to<br>
the transmitter in relation to the received data. Additionally, upon receiving ACK/<br>
NACK indication message from the transmitter, ARQ controller 1545 controls to read<br>
and retransmit MAC data corresponding to the NACK indication message and to<br>
discard MAC data corresponding to the ACK from the buffer.<br>
FIG. 21 is a block diagram of the RS for the retransmission according to the present<br>
invention. Although a transmitting part 1700 and a receiving part 1720 use different<br>
antennas, they can use a single antenna.<br>
The RS of FIG. 21 includes transmitting part 1700, receiving part 1720, ARQ<br>
controller 1740, ARQ state part 1750, ARQ timer 1760, and a channel estimator 1770.<br>
Transmitting part 1700 includes a data generator 1701, a channel encoder 1703, CRC<br>
generator 1705, a modulator 1707, Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) processor<br>
1709, and RF processor 1711.<br>
Data generator 1701 gathers data stored to a first data queue 1713 and a control<br>
message generated at a message generator 1717 at Service Data Unit (SDU) generator<br>
1715 and generates the garnered data as single data for PHY layer transmission.<br>
Message generator 1717 generates ACK control message when the data received from<br>
the transmitter through receiving part 1720 has no error. By contrast, when the data has<br>
error, message generator 1717 generates NACK message.<br>
Channel encoder 1703 codes the data fed from data generator 1701 according to the<br>
corresponding modulation level (e.g., Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) level).<br>
CRC generator 1705 generates CRC code and appends the CRC code to the data fed<br>
from channel encoder 1703.<br>
Modulator 1707 modulates and outputs the data fed from CRC generator 1705<br>
according to the corresponding modulation level (e.g, MCS level).<br>
IFFT processor 1709 processes the frequency-domain data provided from modulator<br><br>
1707 and converts it to a time-domain signal.<br>
RF processor 1711 up-converts the baseband signal fed from DFFT processor 1709 to<br>
a RF signal and outputs the RF signal to the transmitter or the receiver over the<br>
antenna. For instance, RF processor 1711 transmits ACK/NACK control message in<br>
relation to the data received from the transmitter to the BS. Also, RF processor 1711<br>
forwards the data provided from the transmitter to the receiver.<br>
Receiving part 1720 includes RF processor 1721, FFT processor 1723, a demodu<br>
lator 1725, CRC eliminator 1727, a channel decoder 1729, and a data processor 1731.<br>
RF processor 1721 down-coverts the RF signal received from the transmitter over an<br>
antenna to a baseband signal.<br>
FFT processor 1723 processes the time-domain signal fed from RF processor 1721<br>
and converts it to a frequency-domain signal.<br>
Demodulator 1725 demodulates and outputs the signal fed from FFT processor 1723<br>
according to a corresponding modulation level. Demodulator 1725 outputs the de-<br>
modulated signal to CRC eliminator 1727 and channel estimator 1770.<br>
CRC eliminator 1727 determines whether the signal has errors by checking the CRC<br>
code of the signal provided from demodulator 1725. CRC eliminator 1727 eliminates<br>
the CRC code from the signal fed from demodulator 1725.<br>
Channel decoder 1729 decodes and outputs the errorless signal provided from CRC<br>
eliminator 1727 according to a corresponding modulation level.<br>
SDU processor 1735 of data processor 1731 separates data and control message from<br>
the PHY layer signal provided from channel decoder 1729. Next, SDU processor 1735<br>
provides and stores the data in a second data queue 1737. SDU processor 1735<br>
provides the control message to a message processor 1733 to decode and confirm it.<br>
While first data queue 1713 and second data queue 1727 are separately illustrated, they<br>
can be constituted as a single data queue.<br>
Message processor 1733 decodes ACK/NACK indication message received from the<br>
BS and informs ARQ controller 1740. That is, message processor 1733 informs ARQ<br>
controller 1740 of information relating to the retransmission-requested data from the<br>
BS.<br>
Message processor 1733 listens to ACK/NACK control message from the receiver to<br>
the transmitter and provides ARQ controller 1740 with ACK/NACK information<br>
relating to the data sent to the receiver.<br>
ARQ state part 1750 manages ARQ state in relation to the retransmitted data. ARQ<br>
timer 1760 manages the lifetime for the retransmission of the RS.<br>
ARQ controller 1740 controls overall ARQ operation of the RS in association with<br>
ARQ state part 1750 and ARQ timer 1760. For instance, upon receiving ACK/NACK<br>
indication message information from message processor 1733, ARQ controller 1740<br><br>
discards data corresponding to the ACK indication message from first data queue 1713<br>
according to the ACK/NACK indication message information. ARQ controller 1740<br>
controls data generator 1701, channel encoder 1703, and CRC generator 1705 to<br>
retransmit to the receiver data corresponding to the NACK indication message.<br>
As another example, upon receiving the listened ACK/NACK control message in-<br>
formation from message processor 1733, ARQ controller 1740 controls data generator<br>
1701, channel encoder 1703, and CRC generator 1705 to retransmit to the receiver data<br>
corresponding to the NACK control message according to the scheduling information<br>
provided from the BS.<br>
When a lifetime expiration message is received from ARQ timer 1760 in the process<br>
of the retransmission, ARQ controller 1740 stops the retransmission of the cor-<br>
responding data.<br>
While the wireless communication system provides the relay service using the single<br>
RS as above, a multihop relay wireless communication system can work the same.<br>
As set forth above, since the wireless communication system including RS with the<br>
MAC layer and the PHY layer performs the ARQ, the RS merely relays the errorless<br>
data to the receiver. Therefore, the reliability of the data received at the receiver can be<br>
enhanced. The load on the RS can be reduced because the BS controls the ARQ.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain preferred<br>
embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various<br>
changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and<br>
scope of the invention as further defined by the appended claims.<br><br>
