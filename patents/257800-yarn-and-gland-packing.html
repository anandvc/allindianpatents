Description YARN AND GIAND PACKING Technical Field<br>
[0001]      The present invention relates to a yarn and a gland packing, and more particularly to a yarn which is to be used in a braided type gland packing, a string-like gasket, refractory cloth, or the like, and a gland packing which is produced by using the yarn. Background Art<br>
[0002] As a conventional art relating to a gland packing which is to be used in a shaft seal part of a fluid appa¬ratus or the like, and a yarn used in the packing, known is a technique in which expanded graphite is used as a base material as disclosed in Patent Reference 1 and Pat¬ent Reference 2. Patent References 1 and 2 disclose that a yarn for a gland packing is formed by filling the inte¬rior of a tubular member configured by knitting or braid¬ing a fibrous material (knitting, braiding, or the like), with a long expanded graphite sheet. A gland packing is produced by twisting or braiding using plural yarns which are thus produced (for example, eight-strand square braid¬ing which uses eight yarns). [0003] The conventional art which uses a thus configured yarn made of expanded graphite is conducted with the in¬tention that, since the outer periphery of the expanded<br><br>
graphite base material is covered by knitting with a rein¬forcing material, or the like, the tubular member config¬ured by knitting or braiding the reinforcing material counters a tensile or torsion force which is generated in each yarn when the gland packing is produced by braiding the plural yarns, and the expanded graphite base material in the tubular member is prevented from being broken. Patent Reference 1: Japanese Patent Application Laying-Open No. 63-1863<br>
Patent Reference 2:  Japanese Patent Publication No.  6-27546<br>
Disclosure of the Invention Problems to be Solved by the Invention [0004]      In the case where a gland packing i s produced by braiding which uses yarns of the conventional art, however, there may sometimes arise a disadvantage that the expanded graphite is partly broken and missed and only reinforcing fibers exist in the portion.   This is caused because of the following reason.  In the case where a yarn is bent or twisted in order to be subjected to twisting or braiding, the expanded graphite sheet in the tubular member has a part which cannot follow the bending or twisting.  Such a part protrudes from between the fibrous materials forming the tubular member.   This disadvantage is caused by the phenomenon that the minimum bend radius of a yarn is not<br><br>
greatly reduced.<br>
[0005]      When plural yarns in a state where expanded graphite partly protrudes from between fibrous materials are sub¬jected to twisting or braiding to be formed as a gland packing, therefore, rubbing between adjacent yarns due to the process causes a disadvantage that the expanded graph¬ite protruding from between fibrous materials is shaved off.  When a disadvantage such as described above occurs, the sealing property of the disadvantageous portion or i.e. the missing part of the expanded graphite is reduced. This is disadvantageous.<br>
[0006] It is an object of the invention to further improve a yarn which is formed by filling the interior of a tubular member configured by knitting or braiding a fibrous mate¬rial with expanded graphite functioning as a base material, whereby a yarn mainly configured by expanded graphite is improved to be so highly flexible that the expanded graph¬ite does not protrude in a usual bending process, in order to prevent partial missing of the expanded graphite from occurring when the yarn is twisted or braided to produce a gland packing. It is another object to obtain a gland packing which is formed by the improved yarn, and which has an excellent sealing property. Means for Solving the Problems<br>
[000 7]      The invention set forth in claim 1 is characterized<br><br>
in that a yarn 1 is formed by filling the interior of a tubular member 3 configured by knitting or braiding a fi¬brous material 2, with fibrous expanded graphite 4 having<br>
a section in which an aspect ratio h is set to 1 to 5, the aspect ratio being a value obtained by dividing the width w by the thickness t.<br>
[0008] The invention set forth in claim 2 is characterized in that, in the yarn 1 according to claim 1, the aspect ratio h of the section is set to 1.0 to 3.<br>
[0009] The invention set forth in claim 3 is characterized in that, in the yarn 1 according to claim 1 or 2, the thickness t of the fibrous expanded graphite 4 is set to 0.25 mm to 0.50 mm.<br>
[0010]      The invention set forth in claim 4 is characterized in that a gland packing 5 is configured into a string-like shape by bundling plural yarns 1 according to any one of claims 1 to 3, and twisting or braiding the bundled yarns. Effects of the Invention<br>
[0011] According to the invention set forth in claim 1, provided is means for using the fibrous expanded graphite 4 having a section in which the aspect ratio is set to 1 to 5 as expanded graphite to be filled into the tubular member configured by knitting or braiding a fibrous mate¬rial. It has been checked that, according to the configu¬ration, the minimum bend (particularly, bend in the width<br><br>
direction) radius of a yarn is definitely reduced as com¬pared with a conventional yarn (see Fig. 4) . In the case where the yarn is bent or twisted in order to be subjected to twisting or braiding, therefore, an expanded graphite sheet in the tubular member can sufficiently follow the bending or twisting, protruding from between fibrous mate¬rials is eliminated, and the disadvantage that, when plu¬ral yarns are subjected to twisting or braiding to be formed as a gland packing, rubbing between adjacent yarns causes expanded graphite protruding from between fibrous materials to be shaved off does not. occur. Consequently, the reduction of the sealing property due to missing of the expanded graphite in the gland packing is prevented from occurring. [0012] As a result, a yarn mainly configured by expanded graphite can be provided as a yarn which is improved to be so highly flexible that the expanded graphite does not protrude in a usual bending process, in order to prevent partial missing of the expanded graphite from occurring when the yarn is twisted or braided to produce a gland packing. When plural yarns are bundled and then twisted or braided to configure a string-like shape as set forth in claim 4, it is possible to provide an improved gland packing in which the reduction of the sealing property due to missing of the expanded graphite is prevented from oc-<br><br>
curring,   and which  has   an   excellent  sealing property   for  a<br>
long term.<br>
[0013] According to the invention set forth in claim 2, it is checked that, when the aspect ratio of the section of the fibrous expanded graphite is set to 1 to 3, the above-described minimum bend radius is remarkably reduced, and it is possible to provide a yarn in which the function and effects of the invention set forth in claim 1 are further enhanced. In this case, when the thickness of the fibrous expanded graphite is set to 0.25 mm to 0.50 mm as set forth in claim 3, it is possible to configure a desirable yarn which is suitable to practical use.

[0016] Hereinafter, an embodiment of the yarn of the invention and a gland packing using it will be described with reference to the drawings. Fig. 1 is a diagram sche¬matically showing a manner of producing the yarn, Fig. 2 is a view showing a gland packing produced by using the yarn of Fig. 1, Fig. 3 is an enlarged view showing section dimensions of fibrous expanded graphite, Figs. 4 and 5 are views showing relational data of an aspect ratio and bend radius of the fibrous expanded graphite, and Fig. 6 is a view showing an example of use of the gland packing.<br>
[0017]      As shown in Fig. 1, the yarn 1 for a gland packing<br><br>
according to the invention is formed by filling the inte¬rior of a tubular member 3 configured by braiding a fi¬brous material 2 with fibrous expanded graphite 4 having a section in which an aspect ratio h is set to 1 to 5 (1 
 <br>
ble. [0019] In a yarn in which an expanded graphite sheet having a flat section shape of an aspect ratio h of 10 is used, for example, a difference is easily produced between stresses at the both ends, when a tensile force in the longitudinal direction is applied, because the width di¬rection which is the longitudinal direction in the section shape is long. Therefore, the yarn has a property that the section shape is naturally changed to a curved shape such as a C-like shape in accordance with that the tensile force acts to relax the internal stress. In a state where an expanded graphite sheet is filled into a tubular member, however, the expanded graphite sheet is in a situation where it is physically difficult to individually change a section of the sheet into a circular shape. In a conven¬tional yarn, when a tensile force is increased, therefore, the internal stress cannot be relaxed, and hence the yarn has no choice but to be broken. In the yarn 1 of the in¬vention, therefore, the fibrous expanded graphite 4 in which the aspect ratio h of a section shape is 5 or less is used as described above, and hence internal stress can be relaxed to some extent without requiring a change to a curved section shape associated with pulling, and sliding between adjacent fibrous expanded graphites is improved. Consequently, it is considered that the yarn 1 having a<br><br>
bending performance which is practically sufficient has been realized.<br>
[0020] As seen from the table of Fig. 4 and the graph of Fig. 5, when the aspect ratio h of the fibrous expanded graph¬ite 4 is 5 or less, a minimum bend radius which is practi¬cally durable is obtained, and it is known that, when the aspect ratio h is 3 or less, the minimum bend radius is extremely reduced. Therefore, it is preferable that the range of the aspect ratio h is set to a range of 1.0 to 3.0 (1.0 
[0021] The gland packing 5 shown in Fig. 2 is configured into a string-like shape by bundling eight (an example of a plural number) yarns 1 described above in the periphery of a core member S (the core member S may be omitted), and twisting or braiding (eight-strand square braiding or the like) the bundled yarns. The shape is continuously rounded to be compression-molded, whereby a gland packing G in which a section has a rectangular shape, and the<br><br>
whole shape has a doughnut-like annular shape can be formed. As shown in Fig. 6, for example, the gland pack¬ing G is attached to a packing box 7 in a state where plu¬ral gland packings are arranged in the axial direction of a rotation shaft 6, and pressed by a packing gland 8 in the axial direction, thereby enabling the packing to exert a sealing function on the outer peripheral face 6a of the rotation shaft 6. [0022] [Example 1]<br>
A yarn of Example 1 is produced in the following manner. A large number of fibrous expanded graphites 4 which have a rectangular section shape of a thickness of 0.38 mm x a width of 1.0 mm, and which have a length of about 200 mm are inserted into the tubular member 3 con¬figured by braiding (knitting) using an inconel wire (or a stainless steel wire or the like) having a diameter of about 0.1 mm serving as the fibrous material 2, with shifting their end portions from one another by 20 mm, thereby forming the yarn 1 having a circular (round) sec¬tion shape. In the first yarn 1 of Example 1, the aspect ratio h of the fibrous expanded graphite 4 was h = 1.0/0.38 ^ 2.63, and the weight of the first yarn 1 was 5<br>
g/m. [0023]      Fig. 2 shows the gland packing 5 configured by using the first yarn 1 of Example 1.   The gland packing 5 was<br><br>
produced by braiding (eight-strand square braiding or the like) eight yarns 1 of Example 1, and then applying graph¬ite over the surface, thereby producing the gland packing 5 having a square section of 8 mm in length and 8 mm in width. [0024] [Example 2]<br>
A yarn of Example 2 is produced in the following manner. Fibrous expanded graphites 4 having a section size of a thickness of 0.38 mm, a width of 1.0 mm, and a length of 200 mm are bundled with shifting their end por¬tions from one another by 30 mm, thereby forming a long product. The outer periphery of the product is covered by the tubular member 3 configured by knitting the fibrous material 2 configured by an inconel wire having a diameter of 0.1 mm, thereby forming the yarn 1 having a circular (round) section shape. In the second yarn 1 of Example 2, the aspect ratio h of the fibrous expanded graphite 4 was h = 1.0/0.38 ^ 2.63, and the weight of the second yarn 1<br>
was 4 g/m. [0025]      Eight yarns 1 of Example 2 were braided, and graphite was then applied over the surface, thereby producing the<br>
gland packing 5 having a square section of 6.5 mm in length and 6.5 mm in width (see Fig. 2). [0026]      For reference, Fig.  7 shows a comparison table of characteristics between the above-described yarns of Exam-<br><br>
pies 1 and 2 of the invention and yarns of Conventional products 1 to 5 having a conventional structure. The con¬ventional products are schematically configured in the following manner. The yarn of Conventional product 1 has a structure in which plural expanded graphite sheets hav¬ing a small width are stacked and the outer periphery of the stack is reinforced by a fiber. The yarn of Conven¬tional product 2 has a structure in which the outer pe¬riphery of a string-like member configured by folding an expanded graphite tape having a large width is reinforced by a fiber. The yarn of Conventional product 3 has a structure in which an expanded graphite tape having a large width reinforced by a fiber is folded or heated. The yarn of Conventional product 4 has a structure in which the outer periphery of the yarn of Conventional product 3 is further reinforced by a fiber. The yarn of Conventional product 5 has a structure in which a tubular member formed by a fiber is filled with a strip-like ex¬panded graphite sheet.<br>
[0027] From the comparison table of characteristics of Fig. 7, it can be seen that the elongations of the yarns 1 of Examples 1 and 2 are definitely superior to all of the yarns of Conventional products 1 to 5, and show a high-level performance.<br>
[0028]      From the above, the yarn 1 of the invention, and the<br><br>
gland packing 5 configured by it have the following advan¬tages . 1. When the number of accommodated fibrous ex¬panded graphites is changed, a yarn having an arbitrary thickness can be produced. 2. Sliding between fibrous ex¬panded graphites is excellent, and hence expanded graphite is not broken, and can largely elongate. 3. A section of a fiber bundle is easily deformed to a round shape, and hence the adhesiveness to a reinforcing material is excel¬lent, and bending easily occurs. 4. A long material is not used, and therefore production can be easily performed. 5. A yarn can be produced without using an adhesive agent.<br><br><br>
