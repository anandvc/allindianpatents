METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR HYDROLYTIC<br>
SACCHARIFICAT1ON OF A CELLULOSIC BIOMASS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a hydrolyzing method<br>
and system for efficiently producing saccharides from biomasses,<br>
particularly cellulosic biomasses, used as raw materials.<br>
Description of the Related Art,<br>
As part of biomass energy utilization, attempts have<br>
been made to obtain ethanol (bioethanol) by hydrolyzing cellulose or<br>
hemicellulose, which are major constituents of plants. Ethanol<br>
thus obtained is planned to be utilized as a fuel to be mixed into an<br>
automotive fuel or as an alternative fuel for gasoline.<br>
Major constituents of plants include cellulose (a polymer<br>
of glucose, which is a C6 saccharide comprising six carbon atoms),<br>
hemicellulose (a polymer of a C5 saccharide comprising five carbon<br>
atoms and a C6 saccharide), lignin, starch, and the like. Ethanol is<br>
produced from saccharides, such as a C5 saccharide, C6 saccharide,<br>
and oligosaccharide which is a complex of these saccharides, used as<br>
raw materials, by the fermentation action of yeast fungi or the like.<br>
Three methods of hydrolyzing a cellulosic biomass<br><br>
2<br>
comprising cellulose, hemicellulose or the like into saccharides are<br>
about to be utilized industrially, which include: 1) a method of<br>
hydrolyzing such a biomass by the oxidative power of a strong acid,<br>
such as sulfuric acid; 2) a method of hydrolyzing such a biomass by<br>
yeast; and 3) a method utilizing the oxidative power of supercritical<br>
water, subcritical water or the like. However, the hydrolytic<br>
method 1) using the acid indispensably requires a treatment for<br>
neutralizing the added acid after hydrolysis of cellulose or<br>
hemicellulose into saccharides and before fermentation of the<br>
saccharides into ethanol because the added acid acts as an inhibitor<br>
against the fermentation by yeast or the like. The cost of such a<br>
treatment makes it difficult to put this method into practice in view<br>
of the economical aspect.<br>
The outlook for industrial-scale realization of the<br>
hydrolyzing method 2) using yeast is still vague in view of the cost<br>
efficiency because an effective yeast for the method 2) has not been<br>
found yet and, if found, such a yeast is expected to incur a high<br>
production cost thereof, though the method 2) can be realized by a<br>
normal-temperature and normal-pressure process.<br>
As the method 3) of hydrolyzing cellulose or the like into<br>
saccharides by using supercritical or subcritical water, patent<br>
document 1 has disclosed a method of producing water-insoluble<br>
polysaccharides, which is characterized by hydrolysis of cellulosic<br>
powder by bringing the powder into contact with pressurized hot<br><br>
3<br>
water at 240 to 340°C. Patent document 2 has disclosed a method<br>
including: hydrolyzing biomass chips with hot water pressurized to<br>
a saturated vapor pressure or more at 140 to 230°C for a<br>
predetermined time period to extract hemicellulose; and then<br>
conducting hydrolysis using pressurized hot water heated to a<br>
temperature not less than the cellulose hydrolyzig temperature to<br>
extract cellulose. Patent document 3 has disclosed a method of<br>
producing glucose and/or water-soluble cello-oligosaccharide, which<br>
is characterized in that cellulose having a mean polymerization<br>
degree of not less than 100 is hydrolyzed by the steps of: bringing<br>
the cellulose into contact with supercritical or suberitical water at a<br>
temperature of not lower than 250°C and not higher than 450°C and<br>
a pressure of not less than 15 Mpa and not more than 450 MPa for a<br>
time period of not less than 0.01 seconds and not more than 5<br>
seconds; cooling the cellulose; and then bringing the cellulose into<br>
contact with subcritical water at a temperature of not lower than<br>
250°C and not higher than 350°C and a pressure of not less than 15<br>
Mpa and not more than 450 MPa for a time period of not less than 1<br>
seconds and not more than 10 minutes.<br>
On the other hand, patent document 4 has disclosed a<br>
method of treating a biomass-type waste, which includes: placing a<br>
subject for treatment containing a solvent comprising low-<br>
molecular-weight alcohol as a major component and the biomass-<br>
type waste into a closed vessel; and treating the subject by<br>
pressurizing and heating the interior of the closed vessel so that the<br><br>
4<br>
low-molecular-weight alcohol reaches its supercritical condition.<br>
Also, patent document 5 has disclosed a method of hydrolyzing and<br>
liquefying a biomass, which includes treating a cellulosic biomass by<br>
using a mixed solvent prepared by adding 5"20% by volume of water<br>
to a C1 to C8 aliphatic alcohol under the supercritical or subcritical<br>
condition of the alcohol.<br>

As compared with the hydrolytic method using a strong<br>
acid, the method of hydrolytic saccharification of cellulose and<br>
hemicellulose as major constituents of a biomass by using high-<br>
temperature and high-pressure supercritical or subcritical water<br>
requires a lower processing cost and is a more environment friendly<br>
because this method does not require any acid neutralizing<br>
treatment. However, this method has a drawback that without<br>
cooling immediately after the completion of hydrolysis, saccharides<br>
produced thus far would degrade into organic acids or the like<br><br>
5<br>
because the use of supercritical or subcritical water causes cellulose<br>
and hemicellulose to hydrolyze into saccharides completely in<br>
several seconds to several minutes by its strong oxidative power.<br>
With a laboratory-scale small system for hydrolysis, it<br>
seems that such degradation can be prevented by rapidly cooling<br>
supercritical or subcritical water in the heating vessel. With an<br>
industrial-scale hydrolysis system, however, it is very difficult to<br>
cool a large amount of supercritical or subcritical water in a short<br>
time. For this reason, the cellulosic biomass hydrolysing method<br>
using high-temperature and high-pressure supercritical or<br>
subcritical water, when applied to a plant-scale system, will give a<br>
low yield of saccharides, which forms one of the factors that prevent<br>
this method from being put to practice.<br>
In using a large amount of supercritical or subcritical<br>
water, the slurry has to be heated with a large amount of energy,<br>
which forms a factor raising the processing cost. The cellulosic<br>
biomass hydrolyzing method, which subjects a slurry containing<br>
alcohol or the like as a solvent to hydrolysis under a supercritical or<br>
subcritical condition, requires a very high vapor pressure, hence,<br>
requires a larger amount of energy and has to use a system having a<br>
high pressure resistance.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
method and system for hydrolyzing cellulose and/or hemicellulose<br><br>
6<br>
contained in a biomass into monosaccharides and oligosaccharides<br>
(hereinafter will be referred to as "saccharides") by using high-<br>
temperature and high-pressure water in a subcritical condition,<br>
which method and system is excellent in thermal efficiency and<br>
yields of saccharides.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inventor of the present invention has found out that<br>
in hydrolyzing cellulose or hemicellulose into saccharides by using<br>
high-temperature and high-pressure water in a subcritical condition<br>
it is possible to cool a large amount of slurry to a temperature not<br>
higher than the cellulose hydrolyzing temperature thereby<br>
preventing saccharides from degrading into organic acids or the like<br>
as well as to save energy by recovery of thermal energy, by<br>
subjecting the slurry contained in a pressure vessel under a high-<br>
temperature and high-pressure condition to flash evaporation in a<br>
pressure vessel that is charged with a slurry of a cellulosic biomass<br>
and heated halfway. Thus, the present invention has been<br>
accomplished.<br>
Specifically, the present invention is directed to a method<br>
of hydrolytic saccharification of a cellulosic biomass with use of<br>
plural pressure vessels, the method comprising a charging step, a<br>
heating-up step, a hydrolyzing step, a temperature lowering step,<br>
and a discharging step, which are performed sequentially by each of<br><br>
7<br>
the pressure vessels, wherein:<br>
the charging step is a step of charging a slurry prepared<br>
by grinding the cellulosic biomass and then mixing the cellulosic<br>
biomass thus ground with water (hereinafter will be referred to as<br>
"slurry") into each of the pressure vessels;<br>
the heating-up step is a step of hermetically closing the<br>
pressure vessel and heating up the slurry;<br>
the hydrolyzing step is a step of hydrolyzing cellulose<br>
and/or hemicellulose contained in the cellulosic biomass into<br>
saccharides by an oxidative power of high-temperature and high-<br>
pressure water;<br>
the temperature lowering step is a step of flash-<br>
evaporating the high-temperature and high-pressure slurry<br>
contained in the pressure vessel to flash evaporation to lower the<br>
temperature thereof;<br>
the discharging step is a step of removing the slurry out<br>
of the pressure vessel;<br>
while any one of the plural pressure vessels performs the<br>
charging step, any one of the other pressure vessels performs the<br>
discharging step so as to allow heat exchange to occur between the<br>
slurry to be charged into the pressure vessel performing the<br>
charging step and the slurry to be discharged from the pressure<br>
vessel performing the discharging step; and<br>
while any one of the plural pressure vessels performs the<br>
heating-up step, any one of the other pressure vessels performs the<br>
temperature lowering step and allows heat recovery to be made by<br><br>
8<br>
supplying flash vapor discharged from the pressure vessel<br>
performing the temperature lowering step to the pressure vessel<br>
performing the heating-up step (claim 1).<br>
The present invention is also directed to a system for<br>
hydrolytic saccarification of a cellulosic biomass, comprising plural<br>
pressure vessels each configured to perform sequential steps<br>
including:<br>
a charging step of charging a slurry prepared by grinding<br>
the cellulosic biomass and then mixing the cellulosic biomass thus<br>
ground with water into the pressure vessel;<br>
a heating'up step of hermetically closing the pressure<br>
vessel and heating up the pressure vessel;<br>
a hydrolyzing step of hydrolyzing cellulose and/or<br>
hemicellulose contained in the cellulosic biomass into saccharides by<br>
an oxidative power of high-temperature and high-pressure water;<br>
a temperature lowering step of flash-evaporating the<br>
high-temperature and high-pressure slurry contained in the<br>
pressure vessel to lower the temperature thereof; and<br>
a discharging step of removing the slurry out of the<br>
pressure vessel, wherein:<br>
while any one of the plural pressure vessels performs the<br>
charging step, any one of the other pressure vessels performs the<br>
discharging step so as to allow heat exchange to occur between the<br>
slurry to be charged into the pressure vessel performing the<br>
charging step and the slurry to be discharged from the pressure<br><br>
9<br>
vessel performing the discharging step; and<br>
while any one of the plural pressure vessels performs the<br>
heating-up step, any one of the other pressure vessels performs the<br>
temperature lowering step and allows heat recovery to be made by<br>
supplying flash vapor discharged from the pressure vessel<br>
performing the temperature lowering step to the pressure vessel<br>
performing the heating-up step (claim 23).<br>
In the method and system for hydrolytic saccharification<br>
of a cellulosic biomass according to the present invention, five<br>
process steps are performed in each of the plural pressure vessels.<br>
By connecting the pressure vessel at the temperature lowering step<br>
to another pressure vessel at the heating-up step, the slurry in the<br>
pressure vessel at the temperature lowering step can be rapidly<br>
cooled by flash evaporation. At the same time, the slurry in the<br>
pressure vessel performing the heating-up step can be heated by<br>
high-temperature flash vapor, whereby the energy required to heat<br>
the slurry can be saved.<br>
By reducing the internal pressure of the pressure vessel<br>
from the gas phase portion, there is no danger that the dissolved<br>
components and solid contents of the slurry move to clog the nozzle<br>
and piping for passage of flash vapor. Further, there is no need to<br>
provide a special temperature controller or the like. In supplying<br>
the preheated side (i.e., the pressure vessel at the heating-up step)<br>
with flash vapor, the preheating of the slurry becomes more effective<br><br>
10<br>
by supplying flash vapor into the slurry.<br>
The method and system for hydrolytic saccharification of<br>
a cellulosic biomass according to the present invention allows heat<br>
exchange to occur between the slurry to be discharged (drained)<br>
from the pressure vessel at the discharging step and the slurry to be<br>
charged into another pressure vessel at the charging step, thereby<br>
making it possible to further save the energy required to heat the<br>
slurry.<br>
The present invention is also directed to a method of<br>
hydrolytic saccharification of a cellulosic biomass with use of plural<br>
pressure vessels, the method comprising a charging step, a heating-<br>
up step, a hydrolyzing step, a temperature lowering step, and a<br>
discharging step, which are performed sequentially by each of the<br>
pressure vessels, wherein:<br>
the charging step is a step of charging the cellulosic<br>
biomass into a water-permeable vessel and then encapsulating the<br>
water-permeable vessel and water into each of the pressure vessels;<br>
the heating-up step is a step of hermetically closing the<br>
pressure vessel and heating up the cellulosic biomass and water;<br>
the hydrolyzing step is a step of hydrolyzing cellulose<br>
and/or hemicellulose contained in the cellulosic biomass into<br>
saccharides by an oxidative power of high-temperature and high-<br>
pressure water;<br>
the temperature lowering step is a step of flash-<br><br>
11<br>
evaporating high-temperature and high-pressure water contained in<br>
the pressure vessel to lower the temperature thereof;<br>
the discharging step is a step of removing the water and<br>
the water-permeable vessel out of the pressure vessel;<br>
while any one of the plural pressure vessels performs the<br>
charging step, any one of the other pressure vessels performs the<br>
discharging step so as to allow heat exchange to occur between<br>
water to be charged into the pressure vessel performing the<br>
charging step and high-temperature water to be discharged from the<br>
pressure vessel performing the discharging step; and<br>
while any one of the plural pressure vessels performs the<br>
heating-up step, any one of the other pressure vessels performs the<br>
temperature lowering step and allows heat recovery to be made by<br>
supplying flash vapor discharged from the pressure vessel<br>
performing the temperature lowering step to the pressure vessel<br>
performing the heating-up step (claim 2).<br>
The present invention is also directed to a system for<br>
hydrolytic saccarification of a cellulosic biomass, comprising plural<br>
pressure vessels each configured to perform sequential steps<br>
including:<br>
a charging step of encapsulating water and a water-<br>
permeable vessel charged with the cellulosic biomass into the<br>
pressure vessel;<br>
a heating-up step of hermetically closing the pressure<br>
vessel and heating up the pressure vessel<br><br>
12<br>
a hydrolyzing step of hydrolyzing cellulose and/or<br>
hemicellulose contained in the cellulosic biomass into saccharides by<br>
an oxidative power of high-temperature and high-pressure water;<br>
a temperature lowering step of flash-evaporating high-<br>
temperature and high-pressure water contained in the pressure<br>
vessel to lower the temperature thereof; and<br>
a discharging step of removing a residue of the cellulosic<br>
biomass out of the pressure vessel, wherein:<br>
while any one of the plural pressure vessels performs the<br>
charging step, any one of the other pressure vessels performs the<br>
discharging step so as to allow heat exchange to occur between<br>
water to be charged into the pressure vessel performing the<br>
charging step and high-temperature water to be discharged from the<br>
pressure vessel performing the discharging step; and<br>
while any one of the plural pressure vessels performs the<br>
heating-up step, any one of the other pressure vessels performs the<br>
temperature lowering step and allows heat recovery to be made by<br>
supplying flash vapor discharged from the pressure vessel<br>
performing the temperature lowering step to the pressure vessel<br>
performing the heating-up step (claim 24).<br>
In hydrolyzing cellulose or hemicellulose into saccharides<br>
by using high-temperature and high-pressure water in a subcritical<br>
condition, the cellulosic biomass is charged into the water-<br>
permeable vessel having perforations, apertures or the like for<br>
allowing water to move from the exterior to the interior of the<br><br>
13<br>
water-permeable vessel and vice versa and then the water-<br>
permeable vessel and water are encapsulated into each pressure<br>
vessel (compressive and dense encapsulation). By so doing, the<br>
vessels and associated piping can be prevented from being<br>
contaminated with fine residue of slurry.<br>
In cases where equal time is required to complete<br>
respective of all the aforementioned five steps, the number of the<br>
pressure vessels used is preferably a multiple of five (claims 3 and<br>
25). With this feature, the sequential steps can be performed<br>
smoothly while performing heat recovery twice.<br>
In cases where equal time is required to complete<br>
respective of all the four steps other than the hydrolyzing step and<br>
the time required to complete the hydrolyzing step is n times (where<br>
n is a natural number) as long as the time required to complete<br>
respective of all the other four steps, the number of the pressure<br>
vessels used is preferably a multiple of (4+n) (claims 4 and 26).<br>
Where the time required to complete the hydrolyzing step is n times<br>
as long as that required to complete any other step, the number of<br>
pressure vessels to perform the hydrolyzing step is preferably n<br>
times as large as the number of pressure vessels to perform the<br>
other steps. With this feature, the sequential steps can be<br>
performed smoothly while performing heat recovery twice.<br>
When the hydrolyzing step is performed at a temperature<br><br>
14<br>
of not lower than 140°C and not higher than 180°C, hemicellulose<br>
can be hydrolyzed into saccharides (mainly including C5<br>
monosaccharides) (claims 5 and 6). A biomass containing a large<br>
amount of hemicellulose is preferably processed under relatively<br>
moderate conditions because high-temperature processing causes C5<br>
monosaccharides and the like to degrade into organic acids and the<br>
like.<br>
Thereafter, the slurry resulting from the discharging step<br>
is subjected to solid-liquid separation; a solid content produced after<br>
elution of hydrolyzed hemicellulose to the solvent side is separated<br>
out for use as a fresh raw slurry; the raw slurry is subjected to the<br>
charging step again; and the hydrolyzing step is performed at a<br>
temperature of not lower than 240°C and not higher than 280oC.<br>
By so doing, cellulose can be hydrolyzed into saccharides (mainly<br>
including C6 monosaccharides) (claim 7).<br>
Alternatively, by subjecting the water-permeable vessel<br>
having been subjected to the discharge step to the charging step<br>
again and performing the hydrolyzing step at a temperature of not<br>
lower than 240°C and not higher than 280°C, it is possible to<br>
hydrolyze cellulose into saccharides (claim 8).<br>
Hemicellulose contained in the biomass is first<br>
hydrolyzed into saccharides at a temperature of not lower than<br>
140°C and not higher than 180°C and then the biomass is subjected<br><br>
15<br>
to solid-liquid separation. By so doing, cellulose can be separated<br>
out as a solid. A slurry comprising the cellulose thus obtained is<br>
subjected to the charging step and then to the hydrolyzing step at a<br>
temperature of not lower than 240°C and not higher than 280°C.<br>
By so doing, the cellulose can be hydrolyzed into saccharides. This<br>
process is effective for a biomass containing cellulose and<br>
hemicellulose in substantially equal amounts.<br>
When the hydrolyzing step is performed at a temperature<br>
of not lower than 240°C and not higher than 280°C, cellulose can be<br>
hdrolyzed into saccharides (mainly including C6 monosaccharides)<br>
(claim 9). In the case of a biomass having a high cellulose content,<br>
a process for hydrolyzing only cellulose into saccharides at a<br>
relatively high temperature is more effective because the necessity<br>
to take degradation of hemicellulose into consideration is low.<br>
Preferably, the charging step includes addition of ethanol<br>
in an amount of not less than 2 mol% and not more than 10 mol% to<br>
the raw slurry or to water to be encapsulated in the pressure vessel<br>
step (claims 10 and 11). The addition of a small amount of ethanol<br>
to the raw slurry causes the reaction rate of hydrolysis of cellulose<br>
and/or hemicellulose into saccharides by subcritical water to be<br>
lowered. Thus, the cellulose and/or hemicellulose hydrolysis time<br>
in the hydrolyzing step can be adjusted so as to facilitate inhibition<br>
of degradation into organic acids and the like, thereby raising the<br>
yield.<br><br>
16<br>
The present invention is also directed to a method of<br>
hydrolytic saccharification of a cellulosic biomass with use of plural<br>
pressure vessels, the method comprising a discharging and charging<br>
step, a heating-up step, a hydrolyzing step, and a temperature<br>
lowering step, which are performed sequentially by each of the<br>

and<br>

high-temperature and high-pressure slurry contained in the<br>
pressure vessel to lower the temperature thereof, wherein<br>
while any one of the plural pressure vessels performs the<br>
heating-up step, any one of the other pressure vessels performs the<br>

supplying flash vapor discharged from the pressure vessel<br>
performing the temperature lowering step to the pressure vessel<br><br>
18<br>
performing the heating-up step (claim 27).<br>
The present invention is also directed to a method of<br>
hydrolytic saccharification of a cellulosic biomass with use of plural<br>
pressure vessels, the method comprising a discharging and charging<br>
step, a heating-up step, a hydrolyzing step, and a temperature<br>
lowering step, which are performed sequentially by each of the<br>
pressure vessels, wherein:<br>
the discharging and charging step is a step of removing a<br>
cellulosic biomass residue out of each of the pressure vessels after<br>
the temperature lowering step and encapsulating water and a water-<br>

supplying flash vapor discharged from the pressure vessel<br>
performing the temperature lowering step to the pressure vessel<br><br>
19<br>
performing the heating-up step (claim 13).<br>
The present invention is also directed to a system for<br>
hydrolytic saccarification of a cellulosic biomass, comprising plural<br>
pressure vessels each configured to perform sequential steps<br>
including:<br>
a discharging and charging step of removing a cellulosic<br>
biomass residue out of the pressure vessel after a temperature<br>
lowering step and encapsulating water and a water-permeable<br>
vessel charged with the cellulosic biomass into the pressure vessel;<br>
a heating-up step of hermetically closing the pressure<br>
vessel and heating up the pressure vessel;<br>
a hydrolyzing step of hydrolyzing cellulose and/or<br>
hemicellulose contained in the cellulosic biomass into saccharides by<br>
an oxidative power of high-temperature and high-pressure water;<br>
and<br>
the temperature lowering step of flash-evaporating high-<br>
temperature and high-pressure water contained in the pressure<br>
vessel to lower the temperature thereof, wherein<br>
while any one of the plural pressure vessels performs the<br>
heating-up step, any one of the other pressure vessels performs the<br>
temperature lowering step and allows heat recovery to be made by<br>
supplying flash vapor discharged from the pressure vessel<br>
performing the temperature lowering step to the pressure vessel<br>
performing the heating-up step (claim 28).<br><br>
20<br>
By thus performing the discharging step and the<br>
charging step in one pressure vessel, it is possible to reduce the<br>
total number of process steps to four and the total number of<br>
pressure vessels used to four (or a multiple of four) and shorten the<br>
processing time. For this reason, this method and system has the<br>
advantage of improving the production capacity. With the<br>
hydrolytic saccharification method and system having four steps in<br>
total according to the present invention, heat exchange between the<br>
high-temperature slurry to be discharged from each vessel and the<br>
slurry (raw slurry) to be charged into the same pressure vessel is<br>
possible in the discharging and charging step.<br>
Similarly, with the hydrolytic saccharification method<br>
and system having four process steps in total according to the<br>
present invention, heat exchange between high-temperature water<br>
be discharged from each vessel and water to be charged into the<br>
same pressure vessel is possible in the discharging and charging<br>
step.<br>
In cases where equal time is required to complete<br>
respective of all the aforementioned four steps, the number of<br>
pressure vessels used is preferably a multiple of four (claims 14 and<br>
29). With this feature, the sequential steps can be performed<br>
smoothly while performing heat recovery twice.<br>
In cases where equal time is required to complete<br><br>
21<br>
respective of all the three steps other than the hydrolyzing step and<br>
the time required to complete the hydrolyzing step is n times (where<br>
n is a natural number) as long as the time required to complete each<br>
of the other three steps, the number of pressure vessels used is<br>
preferably a multiple of (3+n) (claims 15 and 30). In cases where<br>
the time required to complete the hydrolyzing step is n times as long<br>
as that required to complete any other step, the number of pressure<br>
vessels to perform the hydrolyzing step is preferably n times as<br>
large as the number of pressure vessels to perform the other steps.<br>
With this feature, the sequential steps can be performed smoothly<br>
while performing heat recovery twice.<br>
When the hydrolyzing step is performed at a temperature<br>
of not lower than 140°C and not higher than 180°C, the hydrolytic<br>
saccharification method including four process steps in total is also<br>
capable of hydrolyzing hemicellulose into saccharides (mainly<br>
including C5 monosaccharides) (claims 16 and 17).<br>
The slurry resulting from the discharging and charging<br>
step is subjected to solid-liquid separation; a solid content produced<br>
after elution of hydrolyzed hemicellulose to the solvent side is<br>
separated out for use as a fresh raw slurry; the raw slurry is<br>
charged into the same pressure vessel again in the discharging and<br>
charging step; and the hydrolyzing step is performed at a<br>
temperature of not lower than 240°C and not higher than 280°C.<br>
By so doing, cellulose can be hydrolyzed into saccharides (mainly<br><br>
22<br>
including C6 monosaccharides) (claim 18).<br>
Alternatively, by subjecting the water-permeable vessel<br>
having been subjected to the discharge step to the charging step<br>
again and performing the hydrolyzing step at a temperature of not<br>
lower than 240°C and not higher than 280°C, it is possible to<br>
hydrolyze cellulose into saccharides (claim 19).<br>
When the hydrolyzing step is performed at a temperature<br>
of not lower than 240°C and not higher than 280°C, cellulose can be<br>
hydrolyzed into saccharides (mainly including C6 monosaccharides)<br>
(claim 20).<br>
Preferably, the discharging and charging step includes<br>
addition of ethanol in an amount of not less than 2 mol% and not<br>
more than 10 mol% to the raw slurry or to water to be encapsulated<br>
into each pressure vessel (claims 21 and 22). The reasons that the<br>
aforementioned temperature conditions and the addition of ethanol<br>
are preferable are as stated above for the charging step of the<br>
hydrolytic saccharification method including five process steps in<br>
total.<br>
Ethanol added to the raw slurry is mostly transferred to<br>
flash vapor in the temperature lowering step and then collected into<br>
the slurry in another pressure vessel performing the heating-up step.<br>
The aqueous solution containing saccharides, which is removed out<br><br>
23<br>
of each pressure vessel by the discharging step, is subjected to<br>
ethanol fermentation and thereby converted to bioethanol. If<br>
ethanol remains in the initial phase of ethanol fermentation,<br>
fermentation by yeast is inhibited by such residual ethanol. The<br>
inventions according to claims 10, 11, 21 and 22 have the feature<br>
that ethanol fermentation is difficult to inhibit because the method<br>
can reduce the amount of ethanol in the slurry containing cellulose<br>
and/or hemicellulose which is obtained after the discharging step<br>
while keeping a desired ethanol concentration in the hydrolyzmg<br>
step.<br>
As disclosed in patent document 4 or 5, when the medium<br>
comprising alcohol or the like as a major component is brought into<br>
its subcritical condition, the internal pressure of the pressure vessel<br>
becomes as high as or higher than 12 MPa at 280°C for example.<br>
With the invention according to claim 7, in contrast, the internal<br>
pressure of the pressure vessel reaches no more than about 7.5 to<br>
about 9.7 MPa at 280°C, which the same temperature. Thus, the<br>
method according to this invention is capable of saving the<br>
pressurizing energy while allowing the pressure resistance of the<br>
pressure vessel to lower, thereby offering an economical merit.<br>
The foregoing and other objects, features and attendant<br>
advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from<br>
the reading of the following detailed description of the invention in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
24<br>
[Advantage of the Invention]<br>
According to the present invention, cellulose and/or<br>
hemicellulose contained in a cellulosic biomass can be hydrolyzed<br>
into saccharides in a high yield at a low cost with use of plural<br>
pressure vessels. Also, the present invention can save the required<br>
calorie by about 60% and hence has a very excellent economical<br>
merit because waste heat can be easily recovered from a pressure<br>
vessel performing another step and utilized for preheating to a<br>
suitable temperature for hydrolytic saccharification reaction.<br>
By charging a cellulosic biomass into the water-<br>
permeable vessel and encapsulating the water-permeable vessel and<br>
water into each pressure vessel, it is possible to prevent piping and<br>
the like from being stained as well as to improve the operating<br>
efficiency further.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will<br>
be described with appropriate reference to the drawings. It is to be<br>
noted that the present invention is not limited to the embodiments<br>
described below.<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, description will be made of a<br>
procedure for operating a hydrolytic saccharification system<br>
configured to perform five process steps in total and use five<br>
pressure vessels according to embodiment 1.<br>
First, a cellulosic biomass (for example, a vegetation<br>
biomass comprising bagasse, sugar beet residue, straws or the like)<br><br>
26<br>
is ground to sizes of not more than several millimeters and then<br>
mixed with water or a dilute ethanol aqueous solution (2 to 10<br>
mol%) to prepare a slurry having a solid matter concentration of<br>
about 30%. The slurry thus obtained (raw slurry) is charged into<br>
pressure vessel No. 1, as shown in FIG. 1(a) (charging step). Since<br>
there is no thermal energy released from any other pressure vessel<br>
at the time the hydrolytic saccharfication system starts operating,<br>
the raw slurry cannot be preheated by heat exchange.<br>
Pressure vessels Nos. 1 to 5 each repeatedly perform the<br>
sequence of process steps: charging step → heating-up step →<br>
hydrolyzing step → temperature lowering step → discharging step,<br>
and four pressure vessels Nos. 2 to 5 each operate with a time lag<br>
corresponding to one process step. In the case of FIGs. 1(a) to 1(e),<br>
when pressure vessel No.1 is at the charging step, pressure vessels<br>
Nos. 2 to 5 are at the discharging step, temperature lowering step,<br>
hydrolyzing step and heating-up step, respectively.<br>
In FIGs. 1(a) to 1(e), the terms "preheat and charge",<br>
"preheat and heat-up", "heat-up", "flash" and "drainage" represent<br>
the charging step, heating-up step, hydrolyzing step, temperature<br>
lowering step and discharging step, respectively.<br>
In cases where the hydrolytic saccharification system is<br>
already in operation and the second or later charging step is to be<br>
performed by pressure vessel No. 1, heat exchange is allowed to<br><br>
27<br>
occur between a slurry (containing saccharides) to be discharged (or<br>
drained) from pressure vessel No. 2 at the discharge step and the<br>
raw slurry to be charged into pressure vessel No. 1, thereby<br>
preheating the raw slurry.<br>
Subsequently, pressure vessel No. 1 is closed<br>
hermetically (heating-up step). At that time pressure vessel No. 4<br>
is at the temperature lowering step as shown in FIG. l(b). For this<br>
reason, high-temperature gas present in an upper portion of<br>
pressure vessel No. 4 is supplied as flash vapor to pressure vessel<br>
No. 1 in order to recover heat. (As described above, flash vapor is<br>
preferably supplied into the aqueous solution contained in the<br>
pressure vessel.) As a result, the temperature of the slurry<br>
contained in pressure vessel No. 1 is raised further, whereby the<br>
energy required to bring the slurry into its subcritical condition can<br>
be saved.<br>
Subsequently, the interior of pressure vessel No. 1 is<br>
heated using a heat source, such as high-temperature steam, to<br>
bring the slurry into its subcritical condition, as shown in FIG. 1(c)<br>
(hydrolyzing step). Preferably, ethanol is previously added to the<br>
raw slurry to a concentration of not less than 2 mol% and not more<br>
than 10 mol%. The addition of ethanol allows the hydrolysis<br>
reaction rate to be lowered, thereby making it easy to control the<br>
hydrolysis reaction of cellulose or hemicellulose in the hydrolyzing<br>
step.<br><br>
28<br>
The "hydrolyzing step", as used in the present invention,<br>
is meant to include not only the time during which the slurry is in<br>
the subcritical condition but also the time required to heat the<br>
slurry having been raised in temperature by the heating-up step<br>
until the slurry is brought into the subcritical condition.<br>
If ethanol is added to the raw slurry to a concentration of<br>
more than 10 mol%, the hydrolysis time becomes longer than<br>
necessary while at the same time the pressure vessel needs to have<br>
a higher pressure resistance. In addition, the slurry discharged (or<br>
drained) by the discharging step contains a high concentration of<br>
residual ethanol. For these reasons, the addition of too much<br>
ethanol impairs the practical value of the invention.<br>
Subsequently, pressure vessel No. 1 having passed a<br>
proper hydrolysis time is connected to pressure vessel No. 3 at the<br>
preheating step in order to supply, as flash vapor, the high-<br>
temperature slurry present in a lower portion of pressure vessel No.<br>
1 into pressure vessel No. 3, as shown in FIG. 1(d). By so doing,<br>
the interior of pressure vessel No. 1 is rapidly cooled to a<br>
temperature below the hydrolytic saccharification temperature,<br>
thereby making it possible to stop degradation reaction of<br>
saccharides into organic acids or the like. At the same time, the<br>
temperature of the slurry in pressure vessel No. 3 is raised.<br><br>
29<br>
In order for hemicellulose contained in the biomass to be<br>
hydrolytically saccharificated in the hydrolyzing step, the<br>
temperature of the slurry is adjusted to within the temperature<br>
range of from 140°C to 180°C which allows only hemicellulose to be<br>
hydrolytically saccharificated, without being raised to within the<br>
temperature range (240°C to 280°C) which allows cellulose to be<br>
hydrolytically saccharificated. On the other hand, in order for<br>
cellulose contained in the biomass to be hydrolytically<br>
saccharificated, the temperature of the slurry is raised to within the<br>
temperature range (240°C to 280°C) which allows cellulose to be<br>
hydrolytically saccharificated.<br>
Subsequently, pressure vessel No. 1 of which the<br>
temperature has lowered and of which the pressure has lowered to a<br>
normal pressure or a pressure close to the normal pressure is<br>
opened and the slurry containing saccharides is discharged (or<br>
drained) therefrom, as shown in FIG. l(e) (discharging step). In<br>
the case of the slurry having been subjected to a temperature of<br>
from 240°C to 280°C in the hydrolyzing step, the temperature of the<br>
slurry in the discharging step is about 110°C to about 150°C. For<br>
this reason, heat exchange is allowed to occur between the slurry in<br>
pressure vessel No. 1 at the discharging step and the slurry to be<br>
charged into pressure vessel No. 5. By so doing, it is possible to<br>
preheat the slurry to be charged into pressure vessel No. 5 as well<br>
as to cool the slurry to be removed out of pressure vessel No. 1.<br><br>
30<br>
While description has been made mainly of the operating<br>
procedure for pressure vessel No. 1 with reference to FIGs. 1(a) to<br>
l(e), pressure vessels Nos. 2 to 5 are each operated according to the<br>
same procedure. With respect to the pressure vessels other than<br>
pressure vessel No. 1, the waste heat recovery (i.e., heat exchange)<br>
operations using flash vapor and high-temperature slurry are partly<br>
omitted from FIGs. l(a) to (e). However, it is needless to say that<br>
waste heat recovery (i.e., heat exchange) is performed for each of<br>
these pressure vessels in the same manner as for pressure vessel No.<br>
1.<br>
Saccharides and residual solid content coexist in the<br>
slurry discharged (or drained) by the discharging step and cooled by<br>
heat exchange. Where the hydrolyzing step temperature is within<br>
the range of from 140°C to 180°C, the residual solid content<br>
comprises cellulose and lignin as major components. Where the<br>
hydrolyzing step temperature is within the range of from 240°C to<br>
280°C, the residual solid content comprises lignin as a major<br>
component.<br>
After the residual solid content of the slurry has been<br>
removed away by solid-liquid separation, the resulting liquid is<br>
subjected to ethanol fermentation utilizing the fermentation action<br>
and the like of yeast, thus giving bioethanol. Since such an ethanol<br>
fermentation technique is well-known, description thereof is omitted<br>
herein. Saccharides obtained by the present invention can be<br><br>
31<br>
converted to bioethanol by a known fermentation process other than<br>
yeast fermentation.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, description will be made of a time<br>
schedule for operating the hydrolytic saccharification system using<br>
the five pressure vessels shown in FIGs. 1(a) to 1(b) as a sequencing<br>
batch system. In FIG. 2, the time required to complete each<br>
process step is five minutes.<br>
Initially, pressure vessel No. 1 performs the charging<br>
step and. subsequently, pressure vessels Nos. 2 to 5 perform the<br>
charging step sequentially with a time lag of five minutes from one<br>
pressure vessel to the next one. Each pressure vessel repeats the<br>
five sequential steps: [C] → [PH] → [GL] → [F] → [DC] and,<br>
accordingly, one cycle of the hydrolytic saccharification process for a<br>
cellulosic biomass is 5 min x 5 steps = 25 minutes. Pressure<br>
vessels Nos. 1 to 5 perform this cycle sequentially with a time lag of<br>
five minutes from one pressure vessel to the next one.<br>
Flashing vapor contained in pressure vessel No. 1 at the<br>
temperature lowering step is supplied to pressure vessel No. 2 at<br>
the heating-up step, thus making heat recovery. Likewise, flashing<br>
vapor contained in each of pressure vessels Nos. 2 to 5 at the<br>
temperature lowering step is supplied to a respective one of<br>
pressure vessels Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 1, thus making heat recovery.<br><br>
32<br>
The slurry to be discharged (or drained) from pressure<br>
vessel No. 1 at the discharging step exchanges heat with the slurry<br>
to be charged into pressure vessel No. 5 at the charging step.<br>
Likewise, the high-temperature slurry contained in each of pressure<br>
vessels Nos. 2 to 5 at the discharge step exchanges heat with the<br>
slurry to be charged into a respective one of pressure vessels Nos. 1<br>
to 4 at the charging step.<br>
Such a sequencing batch system makes it possible to<br>
hydrolytically saccharificate a biomass in a short time with the<br>
required energy saved.<br>
Embodiment 2<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, description will be made of a time<br>
schedule for operating a hydrolytic saccharification system as a<br>
sequencing batch system, the hydrolytic saccharification system<br>
being configured to perform four steps in total and use four pressure<br>
vessels each configured to perform the discharging step and the<br>
charging step in parallel as a discharging and charging step in a<br>
steady operation. In FIG. 3, the time required to complete each<br>
step is five minutes.<br>
Initially, pressure vessel No. 1 performs the first<br>
charging step Co and, subsequently, pressure vessels Nos. 2 to 4<br>
perform the first charging step Co sequentially with a time lag of<br>
five minutes from one pressure vessel to the next one. When the<br><br>
33<br>
system starts operating, the system performs the same charging<br>
step as does the hydrolytic saccharification system shown in FIG. 1.<br>
For this reason, the discharging and charging step performed first is<br>
referred to as "first charging step Co" in FIG. 3. In steady<br>
operation, each pressure vessel repeats the four sequential steps:<br>
[C] → [PH] → [GL] → [F] and, accordingly, one cycle of the<br>
hydrolytic saccharification process for a cellulosic biomass is 5 min<br>
x 4 steps = 25 minutes. Pressure vessels Nos. 1 to 4 perform this<br>
cycle sequentially with a time lag of five minutes from one pressure<br>
vessel to the next one.<br>
Plashing vapor contained in pressure vessel No. 1 at the<br>
temperature lowering step is supplied to pressure vessel No. 2 at<br>
the heating-up step, thus making heat recovery. Likewise, flashing<br>
vapor contained in each of pressure vessels Nos. 2 to 4 at the<br>
temperature lowering step is supplied to a respective one of<br>
pressure vessels Nos. 3 to 5 at the heating-up step, thus making<br>
heat recovery.<br>
The slurry is removed out of pressure vessel No. 1 at the<br>
discharging and charging step after the temperature lowering step<br>
and then a raw slurry is charged into the same pressure vessel.<br>
That is, pressure vessel No. 1 having completed the temperature<br>
lowering step performs the discharging step and the charging step<br>
in parallel. When the temperature of the slurry to be discharged is<br>
sufficiently high, heat exchange with the raw slurry to be charged<br><br>
34<br>
may be made.<br>
In terminating the operation, pressure vessel No. 1<br>
having completed the last temperature lowering step performs the<br>
last discharging step Cx and, subsequently, pressure vessels Nos. 2<br>
to 4 perform the last discharging step Cx sequentially with a time<br>
lag of five minutes from one pressure vessel to the next one. In<br>
terminating the operation of the system, the system performs the<br>
same discharging step as does the hydrolytic saccharification system<br>
shown in FIG. 1. For this reason, the discharging and charging<br>
step performed last is referred to as "the last discharging step Cx"<br>
in FIG. 3.<br>
This sequencing batch system is capable of achieving<br>
continuous hydrolytic saccharification in a shorter time with fewer<br>
pressure vessels than the hydrolytic saccharification system shown<br>
in FIGs. 1 and 2.<br>
[Effect of the addition of ethanol in the hydrolyzing step]<br>
Effect of the addition of ethanol on hydrolytic<br>
saccharification of reagent cellulose under the subcritical condition<br>
was studied with the reagent cellulose used as a biomass. FIG. 4<br>
shows the result of an experiment in which pure water and 5wt%<br>
(2mol%) ethanol aqueous solution, which were at the same<br>
temperature of 280°C, were each passed through the above-noted<br>
cellulose.<br><br>
35<br>
FIG. 4 shows the relationship between the reaction time<br>
and the yield of saccharides (%). The addition of ethanol was found<br>
to have substantially no effect on the maximum yield of saccharides.<br>
With respect to the saccharide production rate and the hydrolisis<br>
rate, however, they were apparently lowered by the addition of<br>
ethanol. For example, the time required to reach the maximum<br>
yield was increased about three times (0.7 min→ 2.0 min) by the<br>
addition of ethanol.<br>
It is difficult for an industrial-scale system to control the<br>
reaction time under the subcritical condition to the second. For<br>
this reason, the addition of ethanol to a raw slurry was confirmed<br>
effective in raising the yield of saccharides.<br>
Embodiment 3<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, description will be made of a time<br>
schedule for operating a hydrolytic saccharification system as a<br>
sequencing batch system, the hydrolytic saccharification system<br>
being configured to perform five steps in total and use eight<br>
pressure vessels. This system is adapted to cases where a<br>
cellulosic biomass is difficult to hydrolytically saccharificate under<br>
the subcritical condition and, hence, the hydrolyzing step cannot but<br>
be performed for a longer time than the other four steps. In FIG. 5,<br>
the time required to complete the hydrolyzing step is 20 minutes<br>
and that required to complete any other step is five minutes.<br><br>
36<br>
Initially, pressure vessel No. 1 performs the charging<br>
step and, subsequently, pressure vessels Nos. 2 to 8 perform the<br>
charging step sequentially with a time lag of five minutes from one<br>
pressure vessel to the next one. Each pressure vessel repeats the<br>
five sequential steps: [C] → [PH] → [GL] → [F] → [DC]. Here, the<br>
time required to complete the step of hydrolyzing a cellulosic<br>
biomass into saccharides is 20 minutes and, accordingly, one cycle of<br>
the hydrolytic saccharification process is (5 min x 4 steps) + (20 min<br>
x 1 step) = 40 minutes. Pressure vessels Nos. 1 to 8 perform this<br>
cycle sequentially with a lime Jag of five minutes from one pressure<br>
vessel to the next one.<br>
With the sequencing batch system shown in FIG. 5, the<br>
time required to complete the hydrolyzing step is four times as long<br>
as that required to complete any other process step. Therefore, if<br>
five pressure vessels, the number of which corresponds to the five<br>
process steps, are used, the thermal energy of flash vapor and that<br>
of high-temperature slurry cannot be recovered unless each of the<br>
process steps other than the hydrolyzing step takes 20 minutes as<br>
does the hydrolyzing step. For this reason, the processing time<br>
would be very long. In view of such an inconvenience, the<br>
hydrolytic saccharification system according to the present<br>
embodiment uses eight pressure vessels to realize effective heat<br>
recovery while taking five minutes for any other process step than<br>
the hydrolyzing step as does the foregoing system and 20 minutes<br><br>
37<br>
for the hydrolyzing step.<br>
When pressure vessel No. 1 is at the temperature<br>
lowering step, flashing vapor contained in pressure vessel No. 1 is<br>
supplied to pressure vessel No. 6 at the heating-up step. Likewise,<br>
flashing vapor contained in each of pressure vessels Nos. 2 to 8 at<br>
the temperature lowering step is supplied to a respective one of<br>
pressure vessels Nos. 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, thus making heat<br>
recovery.<br>
The high-temperature slurry to be discharged (or<br>
drained) from pressure vessel No. 1 at the discharging step<br>
exchanges heat with the slurry to be charged into pressure vessel<br>
No. 8 at the charging step. Likewise, the high-temperature slurry<br>
to be discharged from each of pressure vessels Nos. 2 to 8 at the<br>
discharge step exchanges heat with the slurry to be charged into a<br>
respective one of pressure vessels Nos. 1 to 7.<br>
In cases where equal time is required to complete<br>
respective of the four steps other than the hydrolyzing step and the<br>
time required to complete the hydrolyzing step is n times (where n<br>
is a natural number; n is four in this example) as long as the time<br>
required to complete each of the other four steps, the number of<br>
pressure vessels used is preferably a multiple of (4+n). The system<br>
thus arranged a sequencing batch system is capable of achieving<br>
continuous hydrolytic saccharification of a cellulosic biomass in a<br><br>
38<br>
short time with the required energy saved, like embodiment 1.<br>
While embodiment 3 uses eight pressure vessels, the<br>
hydrolytic saccharification system, when comprising two sequencing<br>
bath systems, may use 16 pressure vessels in total. The hydrolytic<br>
saccharification system configured to perform four process steps in<br>
total may be operated in a similar manner as above.<br>
Embodiment 4<br>
With respect to the foregoing embodiments 1 to 3,<br>
description has been directed to the cases where a cellulosic biomass<br>
is ground and then mixed with water to prepare a slurry, which is<br>
then charged into a pressure vessel in the charging step or the<br>
discharging and charging step. In the charging step or the<br>
discharging and charging step according to the present invention,<br>
however, a cellulosic biomass need not necessarily be slurried.<br>
Hydrolysis saccharification of a cellulosic biomass can be achieved<br>
also by such a charging step or discharging and charging step which<br>
includes: charging a cellulosic biomass, such as bagasse, into a<br>
water-permeable vessel having perforations, apertures or the like<br>
for allowing water to move from the exterior to the interior of the<br>
water-permeable vessel and vice versa; and encapsulating the water-<br>
permeable vessel and water into each pressure vessel (compressive<br>
and dense encapsulation).<br>
Though there is no limitation on the material of the<br><br>
39<br>
water-permeable vessel as long as the material can withstand<br>
elevated temperatures in the pressure vessel, the material is<br>
preferably stainless steel and a like material having a high<br>
endurance. Also, there is no limitation on the shape of the water-<br>
permeable vessel," for example, a rectangular-parallelepiped shape, a<br>
cylindrical shape or the like may be appropriately selected for the<br>
water-permeable vessel. However, the same shape as the internal<br>
shape (cylindrical shape) of each pressure vessel is preferable in<br>
view of its high volumetric efficiency. Any means for ensuring the<br>
water-permeability may be employed without any particular<br>
limitation as long as the water-permeable vessel allows water to<br>
move from the exterior to the interior of the water-permeable vessel<br>
and vice versa; for example, the water-permeable vessel may be<br>
partially or entirely reticulated; the water-permeable vessel may be<br>
formed with slits or circular perforations; or the water-permeable<br>
vessel may have open top.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates an example in which dried bagasse as a<br>
cellulosic biomas is charged into the water-permeable vessel. In<br>
this figure, the water-permeable vessel to be charged with bagasse<br>
has a cylindrical shape (with open top) having a bottom surface and<br>
a peripheral surface, which are formed with multiple perforations.<br>
In this case there is no need to grind the dried bagasse. The dried<br>
bagasse may be used with its length left as it is or cut to an<br>
appropriate length.<br><br>
40<br>
After charging, it is preferable to compress the dried<br>
bagasse within the water-permeable vessel from above by means of a<br>
pressing machine or the like. The dried baggase in a previously<br>
compressed condition may be charged into the water-permeable<br>
vessel. The dried bagasse, which has a bulk specific gravity of<br>
about 5 to about 10 kg/m3 before compression, can be compressed to<br>
a bulk specific gravity of not less than 50 kg/m3. The dried bagasse<br>
in this compressed condition is encapsulated into each pressure<br>
vessel and then water is poured into the pressure vessel to capacity.<br>
By so doing, the interior of the pressure vessel has a solid matter<br>
concentration of about several %, which is the same level of solid<br>
matter concentration as the slurry. Therefore, the pressure vessel<br>
has substantially the same volumetric efficiency as with the dried<br>
bagasse in the form of slurry.<br>
In compressing dried bagasse within the water-permeable<br>
vessel, it is preferable that the water-permeable vessel is<br>
compressively and densely charged with dried bagasse as much as<br>
possible by repeating the introduction of dried bagasse into the<br>
water-permeable vessel and the pressing operation. The pressing<br>
operation may be performed only once as long as a sufficient amount<br>
of dried bagasse can be compressively and densely charged into the<br>
water-permeable vessel.<br>
The bulk specific gravity of a cellulosic biomass, such as<br>
dried baggase, is preferably adjusted to a value of not less than 50<br><br>
41<br>
kg/m3 and not more than 300 kg/m3, more preferably not less than<br>
100 kg/m3 and not more than 200 kg/m3, before encapsulation into<br>
the pressure vessel. If the bulk specific gravity of the cellulosic<br>
biomass is too low, the solid matter concentration becomes lower<br>
than that of the cellulosic biomass in the form of slurry, which<br>
results in a lowered volumetric efficiency. On the other hand, if the<br>
bulk specific gravity of the cellulosic biomass is too high, it is<br>
difficult for water to penetrate into the cellulosic biomass and,<br>
hence, the hydrolysis reaction of the cellulosic biomass occurs with<br>
difficulty.<br>
In slurrying a cellulosic biomass such as dried bagasse,<br>
the energy required to pulverize the cellulosic biomass is about 0.5<br>
to 2 kW per 1 kg of the raw material. Such a pulverizing operation<br>
is eliminated in the present embodiment. Even if grinding is<br>
necessary, pulverization is not required. The amount of work<br>
required to pretreat the cellulosic biomass is reduced to 1/10 to 1/2.<br>
In charging the cellulosic biomass in the form of slurry<br>
into a pressure vessel, it is required that the solid matter<br>
concentration be lowered or the cellulosic biomass be pulverized in<br>
order to prevent the piping from being clogged. The cellulosic<br>
biomass has a relatively high water content. For this reason, even<br>
when the solid matter concentration of the slurry is about 10% with<br>
the water content of the cellulosic biomass taken into consideration,<br>
the flowability of the slurry is low. However, by encapsulating the<br><br>
42<br>
water-permeable vessel charged with the cellulosic biomass into the<br>
pressure vessel together with water, the solid matter concentration<br>
within the pressure vessel can be made substantially equal to that<br>
of the slurry, as described above.<br>
With the cellulosic biomass in the form of slurry, solid<br>
matter is sometimes deposited on the inner wall of the piping as<br>
well as on the inner wall of the pressure vessel and remains thereon<br>
as residual solid matter. Such residual solid matter not only<br>
causes the volumetric efficiency of each of the piping and the<br>
pressure vessel but also mixes, as reacted fine powder, into<br>
unreacted slurry. Therefore, such residual solid matter causes the<br>
frequency of cleaning to increase. However, such a problem will not<br>
arise by virtue of the step of encapsulating the water-permeable<br>
vessel charged with the cellulosic biomass into the pressure vessel<br>
together with water, followed by heating because only water passes<br>
through the piping with the cellulosic biomass left within the water-<br>
permeable vessel.<br>
Further, in cases where the cellulosic biomass is heated<br>
at a temperature of not lower than 140°C and not higher than 180°C<br>
to hydrolyze hemicellulose into saccharides and then the residual<br>
solid matter is heated at a temperature of not lower than 240°C and<br>
not higher than 280°C to hydrolyze cellulose into saccharides, it is<br>
required that the solid content obtained after the hydrolysis of<br>
hemicellulose be separated out by solid-liquid separation and then<br><br>
43<br>
mixed with water again to form a slurry when the charging step or<br>
the discharging and charging step includes charging the cellulosic<br>
biomass in the form of slurry into the pressure vessel. However,<br>
with the process of encapsulating the water-permeable vessel<br>
charged with the cellulosic biomass into the pressure vessel together<br>
with water and then heating the pressure vessel, there are<br>
advantages that it is sufficient to discharge water containing<br>
saccharides and that the water-permeable vessel serves also as the<br>
means for solid-liquid separation. By collecting water containing<br>
saccharides that remains together with the biomass residue in the<br>
water-permeable vessel by washing the biomass residue, it is<br>
possible to collect saccharides more efficiently.<br>
In cases where the water-permeable vessel charged with<br>
the cellulosic biomass is encapsulated into the pressure vessel<br>
together with water in the charging step or the discharging and<br>
charging step, the discharging step or the discharging and charging<br>
step includes: discharging high-temperature water containing<br>
saccharides; removing the water-permeable vessel out of the<br>
pressure vessel; and removing a solid residue (which is a residual<br>
solid matter left after hydrolysis of cellulose and/or hemicellulose<br>
contained in the cellulosic biomass and comprising lignin and an ash<br>
content as major components), followed by disposal.<br>
Since this residue can be utilized as a fuel for heating<br>
the interior of the pressure vessel, the present embodiment,<br><br>
44<br>
according to which the solid matter concentration within the<br>
pressure vessel can be raised and, hence, the amount of residue<br>
removed out of the pressure vessel can be increased, is capable of<br>
suppressing the amount of fuel to be used, such as petrol.<br>
In the temperature lowering step, high-temperature<br>
water contained in the pressure vessel is flash-evaporated to<br>
exchange heat with water to be charged into the pressure vessel<br>
performing the charging step. Other features are similar to the<br>
corresponding features of the method and system in which the<br>
cellulosic biomass in the form of slurry is charged by the charging<br>
step or the discharging and charging step.<br>
For example, in the case of the charging step in which the<br>
cellulosic biomass is charged into the water-permeable vessel and<br>
then encapsulated into the pressure vessel together with water, the<br>
"water and water-permeable vessel charged with the cellulosic<br>
biomass" is equivalent to the "raw slurry" appearing in FIG. 1<br>
illustrating the procedure for operating the hydrolytic<br>
saccharification system of embodiment 1.<br>

27.	A system for hydrolytic saccharification of a cellulosic<br>
biomass, comprising plural pressure vessels each configured to<br>
perform sequential steps including:<br>
a discharging and charging step of removing a slurry out<br>
of the pressure vessel after a temperature lowering step and<br>
charging a slurry prepared by grinding said cellulosic biomass and<br>
then mixing said cellulosic biomass thus ground with water into the<br>
same pressure vessel;<br>
a heating-up step of hermetically closing the pressure<br>
vessel and heating up the pressure vessel;<br>
a hydrolyzing step of hydrolyzing cellulose and/or<br>
hemicellulose contained in said biomass into saccharides by an<br>
oxidative power of high-temperature and high-pressure water; and<br>
the temperature lowering step of flash-evaporating the<br>
high-temperature and high-pressure slurry contained in the<br>
pressure vessel to lower the temperature thereof, wherein<br>
while any one of said plural pressure vessels performs<br>
said heating-up step, any one of the other pressure vessels performs<br>
said temperature lowering step and allows heat recovery to be made<br>
by supplying flash vapor discharged from the pressure vessel<br>
performing said temperature lowering step to the pressure vessel<br>
performing said heating-up step.<br>
28.	A system for hydrolytic saccarification of a cellulosic<br>
biomass. comprising plural pressure vessels each configured to<br><br>
57<br>
perform sequential steps including:<br>
a discharging and charging step of removing a cellulosic<br>
biomass residue out of the pressure vessel after a temperature<br>
lowering step and encapsulating water and a water-permeable<br>
vessel charged with said cellulosic biomass into the pressure vessel;<br>
a heating-up step of hermetically closing the pressure<br>
vessel and heating up the pressure vessel;<br>
a hydrolyzing step of hydrolyzing cellulose and/or<br>
hemicellulose contained in said cellulosic biomass into saccharides<br>
by an oxidative power of high-temperature and high-pressure water;<br>
and<br>
the temperature lowering step of flash-evaporating high-<br>
temperature and high-pressure water contained in the pressure<br>
vessel to lower the temperature thereof, wherein<br>
while any one of said plural pressure vessels performs<br>
said heating-up step, any one of the other pressure vessels performs<br>
said temperature lowering step and allows heat recovery to be made<br>
by supplying flash vapor discharged from the pressure vessel<br>
performing said temperature lowering step to the pressure vessel<br>
performing said heating-up step.<br>
29.	The system according to claim 27 or 28, wherein<br>
equal time is required to complete respective of all the four steps<br>
and the number of the pressure vessels used is a multiple of four.<br>
30.	The system according to claim 27 or 28, wherein:<br>
equal time is required to complete respective of all the three steps<br>
other than said hydrolyzing step; the time required to complete said<br><br>
58<br>
hydrolyzing step is n times (where n is a natural number) as long as<br>
the time required to complete each of the other three steps; and the<br>
number of the pressure vessels used is a multiple of (3+n).<br><br>
A method and system for hydrolyzing cellulose and/or hemicellulose<br>
contained in a biomass into monosaccharides and oligosaccharides<br>
by using high-temperature and high-pressure water in a subcritical<br>
condition, is provided which is excellent in thermal efficiency and<br>
yields of saccharides. In hydrolyzing cellulose or hemicellulose into<br>
saccharides by using high-temperature and high-pressure water in a<br>
subcritical condition, a large amount of slurry is cooled into a<br>
condition below the subcritical condition by subjecting the slurry<br>
contained in a pressure vessel under a high-temperature and high-<br>
pressure condition to flash evaporation in a pressure vessel that is<br>
charged with a slurry of a cellulosic biomass and heated halfway,<br>
whereby it is possible to prevent saccharides from degrading into<br>
organic acids or the like as well as to save energy by recovery of<br>
thermal energy. It is possible that the cellulosic biomass is charged<br>
into a water-permeable vessel and then the water-permeable vessel<br>
is encapsulated into the pressure vessel together with water.</td>
