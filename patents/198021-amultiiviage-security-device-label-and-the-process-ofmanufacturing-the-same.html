COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br><br>
	'A'MULTIMAGE    SECURITY    DEVICE/LABEL'<br>
MANUFACTURING THE SAME.<br><br>
AND    -THE    PROCESS     OF<br><br><br>
PRS Solutions Private Limited, a Company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 and haying its office at 63, Bombay Samachar Marg, Mumbai - 400 001 Maharashtra State, India, India.<br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION.<br>
	This invention relates to'"A'Multimage  Security Device/Label"  and the process  of<br>
manufacturing the same. The invented label is a novel "Tamper Evident Label" having a unique type of security ink which gives a two-tone or a "Flip-Flop" effect when viewed at varying angle.<br>
This unique label provides an end customer with the benefit of 'seal of guarantee' to help in to protect the value of his brand/franchise and prevent the "Counterfeiters" from unintended use of such device/label. '<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Traditionally there are several other means and ways of attaching security devices/labels to the products. Presently two dimensional/three dimensional holographic labels are available and used by various parties. The said labels can be reproduced and reused. The conventional labels are not two-tone types. Some other labels are made of papers or other substrates with low strength.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
A new concept of combining the tamper evidence by means of transfer along with other additional feature like Flip-Flop effect incorporated in this security device making that as unique in nature.<br>
Invention provides a "new generation security device" to various industries which are selling/marketing goods/products their components/parts and assembly as well as the manufacturers of various measuring instruments such as energy meters etc. who wants to safe guard their brand or avoid duplication and counterfeiting and thereby protecting their brand image, and simultaneously achieve monitory savings by means of stoppage to counterfeiting.<br><br>
The application details/construction of the invention will become more apparent from the descriptions, which have been provided below:-<br>
A process for manufacturing Multimage Security Device/Label comprising of taking a thermoplastic film of desired dimensions and then sequentially coating the same with different layers consisting of release material, depositions of colours with different shades as required, two tone ink and thereafter followed by depositing printing ink, high grab adhesive and release liner in line with pre-determined design, as required, to get the final device/label with the desired features. All the above referred coating/printings are carried out by using conventional coating/printing methods and the same are carried out either manually and/or by machines with intermittent air/oven drying after each step.<br>
Following are the steps involved in obtaining Multimage Security Device/Label.<br><br>
1)	FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF<br>
2)	RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR<br>
3)	PIPIPIPIPIPIPIPIPIPIPI<br>
4)	P2P2P2P2P2P2P2P2P2P2P2<br>
5)	PMPMPMPMPMPMPMPM<br>
6)	PCOPCOPCOPCOPCOPCO<br>
7)	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>
8)	LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL<br><br>
Thermoplastic Film<br>
Release type of material (optional)<br>
First color- as required by customer<br>
Second color- as required by customer<br>
Two-tone ink<br>
Printing ink.<br>
High Grab Adhesive<br>
Release liner.<br><br>
The thermoplastic film such as polyester, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, polystyrene, poly carbonate etc. The said film does not react with the subsequent coats and inks, which are printed on to it. The said film may have thickness ranging from 0.012 to 0.150 mm.<br>
There is a coat of release material which is optionally given as per customers specified need. If a customer needs predetermined image/message transferring out while removing the label, the release coating is required. The release material has a good film forming property and it does not react/combine with material being coated printed in subsequent<br><br>
layers and it repels or releases the material coated on to it. It can be from a family of silicones / carbamate or esters of natural products.<br>
This invention relates to printing of multicoloured inks with the help of multistations printing machine. A few stations have to be reserved for printing with two tone inks and printing ink to give the desired effect. However, any number of customs built colours and shades can be incorporated in this security device.<br>
Printing inks which are solvent base, emulsion based or ultra violate cure type with known and excellent weathering resistance are used to print as per the custom built design /color scheme required by the user mainly as first color and second color. The third color has to be necessarily the printing ink, which is responsible for the "Flip-Flop" effect followed by a printing ink. This color has to be a darkest shade so as to provide an opaque background and by all choices it turns out to be black color which gives highest effect.<br>
The last important layer is the high grab specially formulated pressure sensitive adhesive depicted just in the same manner and admeasuring to the image area by means of printing/coating machines. A suitable release liner in the form of singled sided siliconised polyester film or single sided silicone coated paper is applied to secure the label if adhesive is printed.<br>
The labels are then punched to desired shape and the waste is stripped-off<br>
Multimage security device/label comprises of a specially formulated multimage ink and a co-colour of the multimage ink through a unique process of printing that creates a new generation security device.<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A process of manufacturing a Multimage Security Device/Label comprising the<br>
following steps: -<br>
(a)	thermoplastic film of required dimensions is coated with release material by conventional method;<br>
(b)	the said film with release coating is printed with different colours and two tone ink by conventional methods;<br>
(c)	thereafter the said film is printed with logo, device or matter as required;<br>
(d)	the above referred coating/printing are carried out with intermittent air/oven drying after each step;<br>
(e)	the printed side of the said film is affixed on the high grab adhesive contained with the release liner and then cut to pre-determined design, to get the final device/ label having desired features.<br>
2.	A process for manufacturing a Multimage Security Device/Label as claimed in Claim<br>
1, wherein the thermoplastic film is made up of polyester, polypropylene, polyvinyl<br>
chloride, polyethylene, polystyrene, poly carbonate with a thickness ranging from 0.012<br>
to 0.150 mm.<br>
3.	A process for manufacturing a Multimage Security Device/Label as claimed in Class 1 &amp; 2, wherein a coat of release material may optionally be applied as per the requirements /needs of predetermined image/message transferring out while removing the release coating material;.<br>
4.	"A Multimage Security Device/Label" which is obtained by the process as claimed in Claims 1, 2 &amp; 3 above.<br>
