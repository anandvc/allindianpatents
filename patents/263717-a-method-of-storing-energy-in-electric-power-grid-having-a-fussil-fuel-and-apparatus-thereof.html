				<td>ENERGY MANAGEMENT IN A POWER GENERATION PLANT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to energy management methods in utilities burning solid<br>
fossil fuel.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Power-producing utilities struggle with uneven demand for electricity during each<br>
daily cycle. During one-day period, demand changes on an hourly basis, with peak<br>
demand periods typically in the morning and evening and low demand during the night.<br>
The gap between the high demand and low demand levels can reach over 30% of the<br>
high demand level. Since electricity is a commodity that cannot be stored in its raw<br>
form, a great deal of a utility's generation capacity is not efficiently utilized. In addition,<br>
frequent large fluctuations in generation levels are costly in terms of operating costs and<br>
mechanical wear, particularly in power plants burning solid fossil fuel such as coal.<br>
Electric power utilities burning fossil fuel are operating a process that converts<br>
heat contained in the fuel to steam, which then drives a turbine that generates electricity.<br>
A coal-fired utility process contains coal handling and coal preparation units, boilers with<br>
burners, ash and emission treatment units, turbine and generation related facilities, water<br>
treatment units and auxiliaries.<br>
The coal handling and preparation systems include off-loading facilities for trains,<br>
barges or other transportation means, coal stockyard which typically stores coal for 1.5-2<br>
months production, materials handling facilities to drive coal from the stockyard to the<br>
plant, coal feeders, pulverization plant and feeding facilities to the boilers' burners.<br>
Coal-fired power generation plants are expensive and complex to operate with<br>
very slow process dynamics. A coal-fired power plant requires many hours of<br>
preparation before generation of electricity can commence, making it uneconomical to<br>
switch off during low demand periods. At the same time, power generation units must be<br>
tightly synchronized with their load for plant integrity and operation safety<br>
considerations. If the demand is reduced to a level below a critical value, coal fuel alone<br>
cannot sufficiently maintain the necessary thermal conditions of the boiler, and other<br>
fuels such as diesel must be used together with coal to keep the boiler at the appropriate<br>
conditions. This is an undesired condition that increases operating expense.<br>
To reduce the gap in load between high demand and low demand periods in order<br>
to even out demands, utilities implement an aggressive time-of-use pricing strategy to<br>
encourage customers to reduce consumption during high demand periods and to increase<br>
consumption during low demand periods. Although the price for electricity in highdemand<br>
periods may be several times the price for electricity in a low-demand period,<br>
this strategy alone is not always sufficient to bridge the demand gap.<br>
Many different solutions have been proposed to store excess electricity generated<br>
during low-demand periods for use during high-demand periods. Among the solutions<br>
that have been proposed is pumping water to high elevations during low demand and the<br>
use of this water in reverse to power hydroelectric units during high-demand periods.<br>
This method is known as "pumped storage" and is used in a few locations around the<br>
world including the USA. Pumped storage requires large capital costs and has a large<br>
impact on the environment.<br>
US 3,631,673 suggests accumulating energy in off-peak hours by storing<br>
compressed air. In peak hours, the compressed air drives a gas turbine. US 5,491,969<br>
suggests that the compressed air is used for combusting fuel in a gas turbine (regular<br>
compressors are then switched off). US 3,849,662 discloses a power plant burning coal<br>
gas obtained by coal gasification, in a steam turbine. Coal gas produced during off-peak<br>
hours is stored in a pressurized holder and is burnt in a gas turbine during peak hours.<br>
Over 30% of electric power in the US is generated from coal. Coal production in<br>
the US is 1.1 billion short tons per year. More than 90% of this coal is used for<br>
generating electricity. America has coal reserves which will last for 250 years at the<br>
current consumption levels.<br>
The quality of coal can be assessed in terms of various attributes such as heat<br>
value, moisture content, volatile matter content, ash content, and sulfur content. Each<br>
attribute, to a greater or lesser extent, affects the manner in which the coal is used, its<br>
burning characteristics and hence its economic value. These attributes vary from coal<br>
deposit to coal deposit and moreover, within a given deposit, the characteristics of the<br>
coal can vary substantially.<br>
Deposits, such as those encountered in the Powder River Basin (PRB) in the<br>
states of Wyoming and Montana, as well as in other similar deposits throughout the<br>
world, contain coal which is commonly known as "low rank" coal. Low rank coal<br>
includes sub-bituminous and lignite coals and is also known as brown coal. The water<br>
content of these coals is considerable, and reaches levels of well over 30%.<br>
In connection with moisture content of coal, the following definitions and standard<br>
methods set forth by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) will be relied<br>
on in the present application.<br>
Total moisture means the measure of weight loss in an air atmosphere under<br>
rigidly controlled conditions of temperature, time and air flow, as determined according<br>
to either § 870.19(a) or § 870.20(a), incorporated herein by reference;<br>
Inherent moisture means moisture that exists as an integral part of the coal seam<br>
in its natural state, including water in pores, but excluding that present in<br>
macroscopically visible fractures, as determined;<br>
Excess moisture means the difference between total moisture and inherent<br>
moisture, calculated according to § 870.19 for high-rank coals or according to § 870.20<br>
for low-rank coals, both incorporated herein by reference. "Excessive moisture" will be<br>
referred to in the present application as "surface moisture";<br>
Low-rank coals means sub-bituminous C and lignite coals;<br>
High-rank coals means anthracite, bituminous, and sub-bituminous A and B<br>
coals.<br>
Laboratory procedure for estimation of inherent moisture is outlined in ASTM<br>
D1412-93 incorporated herein by reference. Collection of coal samples for the estimation<br>
is also determined in ASTM documents.<br>
In brief, the laboratory procedure is as follows. The coal is ground to fine powder,<br>
and exposed to the open air for a certain period of time so that the surface moisture of the<br>
coal is mostly dried, and the residual surface moisture of the coal equals the ambient<br>
moisture. The assumption is that the residual moisture in the coal is inherent moisture.<br>
Coal is then heated in an oven and the inherent moisture content is calculated from the<br>
loss in mass.<br>
There are two distinct types of moisture in coal: surface moisture and inherent<br>
moisture. Surface moisture is the water contained in a coal particle that may be the result<br>
of wetting the coal by physically pouring water on it under normal conditions, such as in<br>
the case of rain or spraying systems. Exposing the coal particle to a source of heat such<br>
as the sun or a flow of hot gases or physical drying mechanisms such as centrifugals, can<br>
drive this moisture off.<br>
Inherent moisture is the water that is locked inside the coal particle, mostly since<br>
its formation, or which penetrated the coal particle in a process that takes a long period of<br>
time and high pressure. Inherent moisture is typically locked in the coal particle in<br>
capillaries or is chemically bounded to the coal and is impossible to drive out by<br>
processes which are used for drying Surface moisture, unless more extreme forces are<br>
used in the form of high temperature and/or high pressure.<br>
Traditional coal dewatering or drying processes for inherent moisture are<br>
complex and are conducted in extreme conditions. Most of these processes are based on a<br>
technique in which coal particles are heated by conventional heating and pressure is<br>
introduced or built in the system. The combined force in the process expels the inherent<br>
moisture from the coal particles. The final moisture content of coal treated in this type of<br>
process is mostly dependent on the ambient conditions prevailing inside the process. The<br>
end result is that drying inherent moisture in coal to low levels requires a great deal of<br>
energy and a long residence time of the coal in the drying process.<br>
Existing dewatering techniques make use of conventional heat transfer processes<br>
to evaporate the water off the coal particles. A disadvantage of these processes is the fact<br>
that the coal particles are heated from the outside inwards in order to evaporate the water.<br>
Coal is known to be a heat insulator, with a very high resistance for heat transfer that<br>
leads to inefficiency, as much heat is wasted on heating each coal particle and its<br>
environment, while the temperature gradient must be big enough to overcome the high<br>
resistance of the coal particle to heat transfer. Such heating is risky and requires special<br>
care, as exposing coal to high temperature can ignite it.<br>
The dewatering process for upgrading of low-rank high inherent moisture coals<br>
has historically been faced with two major drawbacks, which limited the deployment of<br>
industrial dewatering systems on a large scale. Low-rank upgraded coal produced to date<br>
has exhibited low auto-ignition points and spontaneous combustion that occurs faster<br>
than in other coals, including low-rank raw coal. It was found in tests that when a pile of<br>
dewatered coal is exposed to airflow for a number of hours (typically less than 72 hours),<br>
the coal reaches temperatures at which spontaneous combustion or auto-ignition occurs.<br>
Spontaneous heating and spontaneous combustion of coal particles have been common<br>
problems of high inherent moisture content raw coals, but such events usually occur after<br>
longer open-air exposure periods of days and weeks. This phenomenon is aggravated by<br>
the dewatering process which substantially increases the surface-area-to-volume ratio,<br>
hence making the coal particles more active in absorbing air moisture, further reducing<br>
the upgraded coal shelf life.<br>
Another problem observed in dewatering coal is the production of large quantities<br>
of coal fines. Each transfer of dried coal after it leaves the process degrades the coal<br>
particle size further and produces more coal dust, as dried coal is more brittle. Dried coal<br>
does not have the inherent ability to trap small particles on its surfaces like moist coal.<br>
This causes dust-size particles to be released and become lost in transportation, and has a<br>
high risk of causing fires or explosions.<br>
An article in The Australian Coal Review, October 1999, p.27, treats dry cleaning<br>
of coal, i.e. separation of coal from rejects (rocks) without water floatation. In the dry<br>
cleaning process, the moisture content of feed coal should not reach a level where the<br>
particles stick together, which is a function of the surface moisture. Thus, a low-rank coal<br>
can have quite a high inherent moisture level and still be superficially dry and suitable for<br>
dry cleaning. The article suggests that thermal drying can be employed to reduce the<br>
surface moisture to a sufficiently low level and recommends conveying the coal on a belt<br>
through a microwave dryer. In this type of dryers, water readily absorbs the heat energy<br>
and is vaporized while coal is not heated.<br>
US 4280033 discloses MW drying apparatus and process for high-grade ground<br>
coal for coking or gasification. The apparatus comprises an endless conveyor belt passing<br>
through a closed treatment zone, electrode plates at opposite sides of the coal belt, and air<br>
blowing system for passing hot air over the belt to remove humidity.<br>
US 4259560 discloses MW heating/drying method for conductive powder<br>
materials, especially coal before coking. Pulverizing is used to avoid arcing, moisture<br>
content can be regulated in real time by IR detector measurements.<br>
The removal of various contaminants from coal using Electro Magnetic<br>
Radiation (EMR) is also known. In this regard, reference is made to 'Mossbauer<br>
analysis of the microwave desulferization process of raw coal1 by S. Weng<br>
(1993); 'Effect of microwave heating on magnetic separation of pyrite' by<br>
Uslu et all (2003); and 'Microwave embrittlement and desulpherisation of<br>
coal' by Marland et all (1998).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a novel energy management system and a process for<br>
upgrading solid fossil fuel such as coal, for use therein. More particularly it is concerned<br>
with a process for storing inexpensive electricity generated during low-demand periods in<br>
the form of upgraded coal, for use during high-demand periods when the cost of<br>
electricity is a great deal higher.<br>
The invention combines business methods whereby electricity is generated and<br>
stored during low-demand periods and used for generating electricity at high prices<br>
during high-demand periods, with physical methods allowing such storage.<br>
In the method of the present invention, low cost electricity is consumed during<br>
low-demand hours, e.g. in the night, to upgrade low-cost, low-heat value fossil fuel for<br>
use as a substitute for high-cost, high-heat value fuel. The upgraded fuel is stored and is<br>
used in power generation units throughout the day, particularly during high-demand<br>
periods, to generate electricity that is salable in the retail energy market at a considerably<br>
higher price.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for<br>
managing electric power generated during periods of low demand, in an electric power<br>
market where consumption of electric power exhibits periods of different demands. The<br>
method includes upgrading solid fossil fuel by electromagnetic radiation (EMR) drying<br>
during the periods of low demand and utilization of the upgraded fuel.<br>
The utilization preferably includes burning the upgraded fossil fuel for electric<br>
power generation at least during periods of high demand. However, it may include also<br>
burning the fuel in another heat-consuming industrial process or trading the fuel with<br>
another business entity.<br>
The management method is particularly useful for application in a powergeneration<br>
plant, where the upgrading is performed by means of electric power generated<br>
by the same plant. Preferably, the upgraded fossil fuel is stored and burnt also at the same<br>
plant, for electric power generation at least during periods of high demand.<br>
Preferably, the quantity of the upgraded and stored fossil fuel<br>
produced during low-demand periods covers all fuel consumption for power generation<br>
at the same plant during periods of high demand. More preferably, average daily<br>
quantity of the upgraded and stored fossil fuel covers at least average daily fuel<br>
consumption for power generation at the same plant.<br>
Preferably, the EMR drying used in the method includes reducing the<br>
inherent moisture content in the upgraded fossil fuel by 50% or more.<br>
In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a method of upgrading solid fossil fuel. The method includes<br>
dewatering of the solid fossil fuel by EMR, such that the inherent moisture<br>
content in the upgraded fossil fuel is reduced at least in half. Daily quantity of<br>
upgraded fossil fuel obtained by the electrical dewatering process is<br>
commensurate to daily consumption of the power generation plant or/and another<br>
industrial process.<br>
The solid fossil fuel may be low-rank coal, oil shale, tar sand, subbituminous<br>
coal, etc., with high inherent moisture content. However, high-rank<br>
coals with initial low inherent moisture can be further dried as low as 1%<br>
inherent moisture.<br>
The method may be best performed where electric power consumption<br>
due to other consumers exhibits periods of different demands and the electric<br>
dewatering process is performed during low-demand periods of the electric<br>
power consumption.<br>
Preferably, the EMR dewatering process is carried out by using electric<br>
power produced by a power generation plant burning the fossil fuel in its<br>
upgraded state. More specifically, it is carried out where the power generation<br>
plant operates with daily peaks of electric power production and the drying<br>
process is performed predominantly during off-peak hours of the electric power<br>
production.<br>
The method includes storing of upgraded fossil fuel obtained during the<br>
off-peak hours and using the upgraded fossil fuel for electric power production<br>
during the daily peaks. Preferably, the quantity of upgraded fossil fuel obtained<br>
during the off-peak hours covers at least daily consumption of the power<br>
generation plant or the period between two subsequent low demand periods. This<br>
substantially reduces the operating costs of the dewatering process.<br>
The EMR drying may be preceded by driving off surface moisture by<br>
means of hot gases.<br>
Preferably, the EMR drying is performed by means of microwave<br>
radiation.<br>
The method of the present invention in particular provides dewatering<br>
(drying) low-grade solid fossil fuels at low temperatures and pressures by means<br>
of electromagnetic radiation. This method requires short start up and shutdown<br>
periods suitable for interruptible operation during short periods, and has a small<br>
footprint that allows the method to be deployed inside or alongside the power<br>
plant. The use of this method for upgrading low-rank coal during low demand<br>
periods to produce the next day's demand for coal can save utilities millions of<br>
Dollars a year in fuel costs.<br>
The physical dewatering process is based on exposing the solid fossil fuel<br>
to high frequency electromagnetic radiation. There are many benefits of a<br>
radiation-based dewatering process over other processes. Radiation dewatering is<br>
performed at atmospheric pressure and does not require heating the fuel particle<br>
itself. The start-up procedure of the process and its shutdown are quick, making<br>
the process suitable for non-continuous and interruptible operations constrained<br>
by the need to utilize low-cost electricity. Furthermore, radiation can be more<br>
efficient than other techniques in that the dewatering of fuel particles does not<br>
require the complete evaporation of the water, as some of the water may be<br>
driven off the fuel particles mechanically.<br>
Unlike existing inherent moisture dewatering processes involving extreme<br>
heat and pressure conditions, which require large spaces and are normally<br>
deployed near the source of the fuel, the method of the invention can be<br>
implemented with a small footprint, it is quiet, environmentally friendly and is<br>
simple to operate, making it suitable for both sides of the fuel's value chain - the<br>
source side as well as the utility's side.<br>
One fundamental premise of the process is subjecting the fuel particles to<br>
electromagnetic radiation at radio, microwave or higher frequencies. The<br>
intensity of the radiation i.e. the energy density per unit volume of fuel and the<br>
frequency of the radiation may be varied according to requirements, taking into<br>
account all relevant factors. Another important premise of the process is the use<br>
of cheap electricity during low demand periods to dewater and upgrade the fuel<br>
that is used to produce more expensive electricity throughout the day, in<br>
particular during high demand periods. This introduces to the utilities an<br>
innovative means by which electricity can be generated and stored inside the fuel<br>
during low demand periods to be used during high demand periods to produce<br>
higher revenues.<br>
When the process is deployed near a utility's power generation unit, it<br>
becomes possible to a large extent to integrate the process with the utility's<br>
existing fuel handling facilities, hence saving large capital expenses. In this case,<br>
the process of dewatering is carried out in a stage prior to a pulverizing unit<br>
which mills the fuel solids to powder before feeding the powder to the boiler's<br>
burners. In such a case, the low-grade fuel may be drawn from a stockyard by<br>
means of conventional and existing material handling facilities. The fuel may<br>
then be dried by means of conventional heat i.e. a stream of hot gases, and then<br>
passed through the radiation units. Dewatered (upgraded) fuel may be stored for<br>
later use, or may flow directly from the radiation units into the existing<br>
pulverization unit. Normal power plant operation processes can then proceed.<br>
When the upgraded fuel is stored for later use, existing or new enclosed<br>
storage facilities may be used, such as bins or silos or any other confined dry<br>
material storage unit. This fuel can be then fed directly to the pulverization unit,<br>
and re-enter the normal power plant processes. Keeping the upgraded fuel in a<br>
confined storage environment and under controlled conditions extends its shelf<br>
life and reduces the risks of undesired ignition. The accumulated fuel may be<br>
stored in silos, bins or any other means of storage. During the storage period the<br>
storage facilities may be purged with inert gases such as nitrogen or carbon<br>
dioxide, to prevent the fuel and fines from combusting.<br>
Prior to subjecting the low-grade solid fuel to radiation, it may be sized.<br>
This could be done in any appropriate way, for example by grading or milling.<br>
Further particle sizing is performed during the pulverizing step which takes place<br>
after the dewatering process and prior to the fuel being fed to the burner. Drying<br>
of low-grade fuel by EMR produces fines and the radiated fuel exhibits brittle<br>
characteristics which may prove to be beneficial in the pulverizing unit.<br>
The method of present invention allows the fossil fuel to be upgraded<br>
close to the place of its consumption, both in space and in time, so that the dried<br>
fossil fuel does not need much additional handling such as transportation.<br>
Immediately following the drying, the fuel may undergo a further size reduction<br>
process of pulverizing. Thus coal fines are not lost in transportation and the risk<br>
of causing fires and explosions is diminished.<br>
The fuel could be processed in batches but preferably is processed on a<br>
semi-continuous or continuous basis. Thus the fuel may be transported through<br>
or past one or more sources of electromagnetic radiation on appropriate transport<br>
devices. Such devices are preferably inert to electromagnetic radiation.<br>
Any appropriate material may be used for the transport devices and for<br>
example use may be made of conveyors or other transport devices which are<br>
made from materials, e.g. ceramic or stainless steel material, which are inert to<br>
radiation. This ensures that no energy is wasted unnecessarily to heat up elements<br>
of the process which do not contribute to the main objective of driving the locked<br>
moisture out of the fuel particles.<br>
The fuel may be subjected to the radiation in one or more stages. The<br>
electromagnetic radiation at the appropriate frequency excites the water<br>
molecules locked inside the fuel particles, and consequently increases the water's<br>
temperature so that the water is driven out and is released from the fuel. This, in<br>
turn, may raise the temperature of the fuel particles. Higher water temperature<br>
reduces surface tension effects so that the forces that lock the water inside the<br>
capillaries in the fuel particles are reduced and the dewatering process becomes<br>
more efficient.<br>
It is also possible to vary the physical characteristics of each stage. For<br>
example at least in one stage the fuel may be subjected to electromagnetic<br>
radiation in the presence of a suitable inert gas, such as nitrogen or carbon<br>
dioxide, which acts as an ignition suppression agent to prevent it from burning<br>
and suppresses conditions which may be developed and could lead to explosion.<br>
This gas could also heat the processed fuel to dry off its surface moisture which<br>
may be originally contained in the fuel or which is built up during the radiation<br>
process.<br>
In most cases the water vapour that is released by the radiation process is<br>
clean and could be released to the atmosphere.<br>
The fuel may be subjected to a cooling step which will also remove the<br>
water vapour, and thereafter dry fuel may be screened and recovered. It may also<br>
be required that the dewatered coal particles are kept in certain ambient<br>
conditions so as to drive off all excess surface moisture which may accumulate as<br>
a result of the radiation.<br>
According to a next aspect of the present invention, there are provided the<br>
following systems for practicing the above methods.<br>
A system for energy production by burning solid fossil fuel in a power<br>
generation plant including burners comprises an EMR drying plant for upgrading<br>
the solid fossil fuel and transportation means for moving the upgraded solid<br>
fossil to the burners. The EMR plant is adapted to reduce inherent moisture<br>
content in the upgraded solid fossil fuel by 50% or more. The system preferably<br>
comprises storage means suitable to store a quantity of the upgraded solid fossil<br>
fuel at least commensurate to daily consumption of the power generation plant.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
In order to understand the invention and to see how it may be carried out in<br>
practice, an embodiment will now be described, by way of non-limiting example<br>
only, with reference to the accompanying Fig. 1 which is a schematic diagram of<br>
low-rank coal drying and utilization according to the method of the present<br>
invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
With reference to Fig.l, the steps and the components of one example of<br>
process and system in accordance with the invention are depicted on the<br>
background of the existing process of coal-burning in a power-production utility,<br>
as described in the Background of the Invention. For illustration purposes, Fig. 1<br>
shows the process for dewatering coal, but it is similarly suitable for any other<br>
solid fossil fuel. The described process is designed to be performed between the<br>
coal stockyard and the coal bunkers feeding the pulverization plant.<br>
A production scheme for practicing the process includes the following<br>
main components: coal stock 10, coal preparation unit 12, loading station 16,<br>
microwave drying plant 20, cooling and curing unit 34, dry coal storage units 66,<br>
pulverizing unit 68, and water treatment plant 30. The other components of the<br>
scheme will become clear further on. In this drawing, an enclosed area 8<br>
represents the process of the present invention while the portion lying outside the<br>
enclosed area represents the existing process at the utility.<br>
Low-rank wet coal is stored in the stock 10 and is fed using appropriate<br>
techniques to the coal preparation unit 12 in which the coal can be sized. If<br>
necessary the coal could be graded or milled in any appropriate way.<br>
The coal is then passed to the loading station 16 where the coal is<br>
transferred to transport devices (e.g. conveyors) which are transparent to<br>
microwave radiation and which can withstand the process temperature without<br>
resulting mechanical damage. For example ceramics, plastic or stainless steel<br>
materials, which are not heated by microwave radiation and which do not<br>
materially attenuate such radiation, can be used in the construction of suitable<br>
conveyors (not shown). The loading station 16 uses conventional material<br>
handling systems. The design may be different for each specific application, and<br>
if a batch or continuous process strategy is deployed. In a batch operation the<br>
coal is loaded at a certain profile in the MW plant 20, and the energy required for<br>
drying is dependent on the radiation time. In a continuous operation, the coal is<br>
moved through the microwave drying plant 20 and the energy required for drying<br>
is dependent on the speed of motion.<br>
The microwave drying plant 20 comprises a housing and a number of<br>
microwave radiation sources (not shown). The housing is made of special<br>
material such as stainless steel and is shielded so that microwave radiation does<br>
not escape from the housing, thereby ensuring that the environment is<br>
electromagnetically safe, and the released water vapour and gasses are<br>
controlled. The housing is also designed to focus the electromagnetic radiation<br>
directly onto the coal, so as to maximize the yield of dried coal relatively to the<br>
energy input.<br>
MW radiation sources may be made using magnetron or other suitable<br>
technology. The radiation frequency of each source and the energy density<br>
prevailing in the housing can be varied according to requirements taking into<br>
account all relevant circumstances. Similarly, the period for which the coal is<br>
subjected to the radiation can be varied taking into account the efficiency of the<br>
dewatering process.<br>
Forced air or inert gas such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide, depending on<br>
the process conditions, is directed from a source 22 to the plant 20. The injection<br>
of forced air or inert gases is used to maintain a low humidity environment inside<br>
the housing. Humidity inside the housing is due to the water released from the<br>
coal, and due to the low temperature of the process. A substantial amount of<br>
water vapour 28 is released from the coal. This water vapour is driven off to the<br>
atmosphere by means of the air or inert gases 22 that are injected into the<br>
housing.<br>
In the case where an excessive amount of water is released from the coal,<br>
water 24 which drains from the unit can be directed to the water treatment plant<br>
30. This process may not be required when the water which is removed from the<br>
coal can be released to the environment.<br>
The MW drying plant 20 may comprise for example a single stage. It also<br>
could be made of a plurality of stages depending on the extent of dewatering<br>
required, and the amount of coal which is being dewatered.<br>
Multiple MW plant units can be stacked in parallel and in series to each<br>
other. Parallel units serve to increase the capacity of the entire process while<br>
series units serve to increase the capacity of each line individually.<br>
Dried coal emerging from the plant 20 is directed to the coal cooling and<br>
curing unit 34. At this stage, the coal may contain surface moisture which is the<br>
result of the inherent moisture driven off by the electromagnetic radiation (see<br>
below).<br>
Upgraded coal 64 emerging from the cooling and curing unit 30 can be<br>
directed either to the dry coal enclosed storage units 66 or to the next stage in the<br>
utility's process which will be usually the pulverizing unit 68, preparing the coal<br>
for burning.<br>
The storage unit 66 is sized to hold enough upgraded coal to last during a<br>
high-load period of power production, when the MW radiation plant is not<br>
operational. Inert gases 70 may also be introduced to the enclosed storage units<br>
66 in order to keep the coal under conditions that are not conducive to ignition or<br>
fire. As shown by the divisive broken line in Fig. 1, the enclosed storage units 66<br>
may be part of an existing utility structure, or may be specially added to<br>
accommodate the upgraded coal produced by the drying process.<br>
A bypass connection 72 provides for direct connection between the<br>
cooling and curing unit 30 and the pulverizing unit 68. The bypass may be<br>
operational during low-demand periods of power production.<br>
The mode of operation of the process is such that the coal serves as<br>
capacity for storing energy, where cheap electric power is used to upgrade coal<br>
that is used during a high demand period. This strategy further benefits the<br>
utility in that it keeps the power plant operational at a certain load during low<br>
demand periods and hence produces more balanced and stable load<br>
characteristics throughout the day and so stabilizes electricity generation. The<br>
process also requires relatively short start up and shutdown periods.<br>
To reduce the cost of the energy required for the entire process, the MW<br>
plant units should have a process capacity which is sufficient to dry the amount<br>
of coal required for a whole day's operation in a matter of a few hours when<br>
demand for electricity is at its lowest. This requires that the process only works<br>
certain hours, and is switched on and off as demand changes throughout the day.<br>
The exemplary process of the present invention departs from the utility's<br>
normal process at the coal stockyard 10 and returns to the normal process at the<br>
input to the pulverizing unit 68. The confined storage facility 66 is designed to<br>
hold coal for high-demand periods, and has a storage capacity which will last<br>
during a high-demand period when the dewatering MW plant 20 is not<br>
operational.<br>
Although MW radiation was used as an example, other electromagnetic<br>
radiation may be used. Electromagnetic radiation heats the inherent moisture<br>
locked inside the coal particle. When this water is heated, it results in pressure<br>
increase inside the coal particle which serves as a driving force for the water<br>
vapour to escape from each coal particle. On its way to the coal particle's<br>
surface, the water vapour may mechanically carry along other water that is<br>
locked inside the particle. This process may increase the thermal yield of the<br>
radiation, as not all inherent moisture must be evaporated in order to escape from<br>
the coal particle. The result is that process conditions are kept at relatively low<br>
temperatures and not all the water released from the coal is in the vapour phase.<br>
Liquid water may be driven off the coal's surface and away from the housing by<br>
mechanical means. The injection of forced air or inert gas 22 serves as a method<br>
for the removal of the excess water, but other methods are also possible.<br>
Dewatering tests shown below conducted on low-rank coal such as<br>
Powder River Coal by means of high frequency electromagnetic radiation in<br>
moderate process conditions proved that the inherent moisture can be reduced to<br>
levels of 1-2% from levels of over 25%. Furthermore, tests showed that the<br>
process is also suitable for high-rank coals with initial low inherent moisture of<br>
6-10% which can be reduced to as low as 1%. Also, the EMR drying of coal<br>
proved to conserve its volatile matter content, a critical attribute of coal heat<br>
value and its quick burning capability inside a boiler. The process of upgrading<br>
solid fossil fuels by EMR is rich in process variables that are easy to control such<br>
as radiation level, radiation time, particle size and others, factors which make the<br>
process easy to control and optimize.<br>
An amount of raw PRB coal was shipped to a laboratory in Haifa, Israel,<br>
for initial tests. Samples were treated in a domestic microwave oven with an<br>
output power of 900 Watt and frequency of 2,450 MHz. In addition to the treated<br>
coal, a sample of raw coal was also analyzed and the following Table 1 is a<br>
summary of the tests:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
From the laboratory analysis it is evident that:<br>
- loss of weight observed during the physical tests is attributed to reduced<br>
inherent moisture of the coal;<br>
- treated coal shows different compositions based on the fact that the water<br>
was driven out and the sample total mass was reduced;<br>
- volatile matter was not affected by the process, which is a major<br>
departure from all other inherent moisture drying processes for PRB coal. In fact,<br>
the content of volatile matter has increased proportionally to the reduction in<br>
inherent moisture.<br>
The laboratory results as indicated in the table above have shown that the<br>
drying of inherent moisture in PRB coal is not only possible, but the process is<br>
also relatively efficient. Furthermore, if the process is conducted during low<br>
electricity demand periods it is also highly economical.<br>

The electromagnetic radiation technique for drying inherent moisture in<br>
coal offers at least the following potential benefits: a relatively simple and<br>
inexpensive process at low pressure and temperature, a short residence time in<br>
the EMR unit which enables large quantity of coal to be processed on a<br>
continuous or semi-continuous basis, a clean and environmentally friendly<br>
treatment method, a process that can start up and shutdown easily, a process with<br>
a small footprint that could be deployed in a normal utility, a process that makes<br>
use of low cost energy to upgrade coal used during high demand periods to<br>
produce high cost electricity, a process that yields fuel which will be consumed<br>
within a short period of time hence eliminating the problem of spontaneous<br>
combustion, a process that is deployed in close proximity to the stage where the<br>
coal is pulverized to powder, hence eliminating the problem of coal fines and a<br>
solution that can integrate well into the entire power generation process of a<br>
utility.<br>
Although a description of a specific embodiment has been presented, it is<br>
contemplated that various changes could be made without deviating from the scope<br>
of the present invention. For example, the present method could be modified and<br>
used for upgrading other solid fossil fuels than coal. The methods of the present<br>
invention may be practiced in a separate fuel-drying utility (not producing electric<br>
power), the upgraded solid fuel may be traded to other consumers or may be used<br>
in other industrial facilities such as cement kilns, furnaces, etc.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
