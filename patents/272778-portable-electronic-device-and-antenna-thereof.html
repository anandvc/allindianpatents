PARTICULARLY   DESCRIBES   THE   INVENTION AND  THE   MANNER   IN  WHICH   IT   IS  TO   BE PERFORMED.<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of provisional Application No. 61/235,763, filed Aug. 21,2009.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a portable electronic device, and in particular<br>
relates to a portable electronic device satisfying HAC requirements with a decreased SAR value.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
SAR and HAC are indices that measure the extent of radiation influence upon<br>
human health and hearing aid equipment, respectively. A high SAR value resulting from electromagnetic wave radiation may cause human health problems. Thus, mobile phones must pass SAR requirements (e.g. FCC &amp; CE requirements). Mobile phones with excessive HAC values hinder audiphone's functions. Thus, 50% of the mobile phones sold in North America by a manufacturer must pass HAC requirements.<br>
To pass SAR and HAC requirements, several conventional solutions are applied<br>
in mobile phone design: (a) board end power or antenna radiation efficiency is decreased to<br>
reduce radiation energy; (b) electric field distribution is modified by adding a metal element<br>
corresponding to an antenna; or (c) the antenna is disposed away from a radiation<br>
mterference area thereof (e.g. away from amplifier.) However, the conventional solutions<br>
may deteriprate communications quality, reduce design flexibility, or increase hardware<br>
costs. <br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A detailed description is given in the following embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
An antenna is provided. The antenna includes a radiator, a feed conductor and a ground conductor. The radiator includes a body and a parasitic element. An aperture is formed on the body, and the body encloses the aperture. The parasitic element is connected to the body and extended into the aperture, wherein the parasitic element is connected to the body at a parasitic location. The feed conductor is connected to the body, wherein a signal, fed to the body by the feed conductor, travels on the body, and passes the parasitic location to the parasitic element. The ground conductor is connected to the body.<br>
In one embodiment, a path length from the feed conductor to the parasitic location is 1/4位., wherein 位 is a wavelength of the signal.<br>
In another embodiment, a path length from the feed conductor to the parasitic location is \/2位, wherein 位 is a wavelength of the signal.<br>
In one embodiment, a portable electronic device is provided, wherein the feed conductor and the ground conductor electrically connect the body (antenna) to a circuit board thereof, and the antenna modifies an electric field distribution of the circuit board.<br>
The antenna of the embodiment of the invention modifies an electric field distribution on a ground layer of a circuit board, and reduces the electric field intensity around the amplifier to improve HAC and SAR performance. In one embodiment of the invention, the HAC performance can be improved to level M3 (68.5V/m). Additionally, the antenna can be disposed near the amplifier of a portable electronic device, without negatively effecting HAC requirement of the portable electronic device.<br>

The feed conductor and the ground conductor electrically connect the body (antenna 100) to the circuit board 2. The antenna 100 modifies an electric field distribution of the circuit board 2 to reduce an HAC value of the portable electronic device 10. With reference to Fig. 4B, in the embodiment of the invention, the antenna 100 can be disposed near an amplifier 3 of the portable electronic device 10, without negatively effecting HAC recruitment of the portable electronic device 10.<br>
The antenna of the embodiment of the invention modifies an electric field distribution on a ground layer of the circuit board, and reduces the electric field intensity around the amplifier to improve HAC and SAR performance. In one embodiment of the invention, the HAC performance can be improved to level M3 (68.5V/m).
