MULTI-SPEED TRANSMISSION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001)	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/828,663, filed on October 9, 2006. The disclosure of the above application is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]	The invention relates generally to a multiple speed transmission having a<br>
plurality of planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting devices and more<br>
particularly to a transmission having eight or more speeds, three planetary gear sets and a<br>
plurality of torque transmitting devices.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]	Automatic power transmissions are currently in wide spread use in<br>
passenger vehicles and trucks. As is well known, the automatic transmission provides a<br>
plurality of speed ratios in both the forward direction and at least one reverse speed ratio.<br>
The speed ratios are established through the use of a plurality of planetary gearsets. The<br>
engagement of the gearsets is controlled by a number of fluid-operated torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms, commonly termed clutches and brakes.<br>
[0004]	It has become a standard to provide at least four forward speed ratios in<br>
automatic transmissions for use in passenger vehicles. More recently, automobile<br>
manufacturers have increased the forward speed ratios to six and in some instances seven<br>
or eight. This, of course, requires the addition of planetary gearsets. However, it is<br>
desirable to minimize the number of torque-transmitting mechanisms to reduce cost and<br>
overall size of the transmission.<br>
[0005]	A number of the currently proposed eight speed planetary transmissions<br>
provide three planetary gearsets and five torque-transmitting mechanisms. One problem<br>
facing transmission designers and manufacturers is the packaging of the planetary<br>
gearsets and the torque-transmitting mechanisms. It is preferable to arrange the gearsets<br>
1<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: P002642-PTT-DI.T<br>
and torque-transmitting mechanisms in a way that minimizes the overall size of the<br>
transmission as well as reduces manufacturing complexity.<br>
[0006]	Thus, there is a need for a new and improved multi-speed transmission.<br>
The arrangement of the gearsets and the torque-transmitting mechanisms of the<br>
transmission should minimize the size and manufacturing complexity of the transmission.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0016]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like characters represent the same or<br>
corresponding parts throughout the several views, there is seen in Figure 1 a powertrain<br>
10 having an internal combustion engine or electric motor 12, a torque converter or<br>
flywheel 14, a transmission 16, and a final drive mechanism 18.<br>
2<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: P002642-PTT-DLT<br>
[0017]	The transmission 16 includes an input shaft or member 20, a planetary<br>
gear arrangement 22, and an output shaft or member 24. The planetary gear arrangement<br>
22 includes three planetary gearsets 26, 28, and 30, and six selectively-engageable<br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms 32, 34, 36, 38, 40 and 42. The input shaft 20 is drivingly<br>
connected with a conventional turbine disposed within the torque converter 14. The<br>
output shaft 24 is drivingly connected with the final drive mechanism 18. As is well<br>
known in the art of vehicle transmissions, the final drive mechanism 18 provides output<br>
shafts to drive the wheels of a vehicle.<br>
[0018]	The transmission 16 has a first end wall 50, a second end wall 52, and a<br>
housing 54. Housing 54 interconnects between the first and second end walls 50 and 52<br>
to provide a space or cavity 53 in which the planetary gearsets 26, 28, and 30 and the<br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms 32, 34, 36, 38, 40 and 42 are located. Further, cavity 53<br>
has a plurality of zones A, B, C, D and E in which the plurality of torque transmitting<br>
mechanisms 32, 34, 36, 38, 40 and 42 will be specifically positioned, in accordance with<br>
the preferred embodiments of the present invention.<br>
[0019]	As shown in Figure 1 and throughout the several views, Zone A is defined<br>
by the area or space bounded: axially on the left by first end wall 50, axially on the right<br>
by planetary gearset 26, radially inward by input shaft 20 and radially outward by<br>
reference line "L" which is a longitudinal line that extends adjacent the planetary<br>
gearsets; Zone B is defined by the area bounded: axially on the left by planetary gearset<br>
26, axially on the right by planetary gearset 28, radially inward by input shaft 20 and<br>
radially outward by reference line "L"; Zone C is defined by the area bounded: axially on<br>
the left by planetary gearset 28, axially on the right by planetary gearset 30, radially<br>
inward by input shaft 20 and radially outward by reference line "L"; Zone D is defined by<br>
the area bounded: axially on the left by planetary gearset 30, axially on the right by<br>
second end wall 52, radially inward by input shaft 20 and radially outward by reference<br>
line "L"; and Zone E is defined by the area bounded: axially on the left by first end wall<br>
50, axially on the right by second end wall 52, radially inward by reference line "L" and<br>
radially outward by housing 54. While reference line "L" is illustrated as a straight line<br>
throughout the several views, it should be appreciated that reference line "L" follows the<br>
outer periphery of the planetary gear sets 26, 28, and 30, and accordingly may be stepped<br>
3<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: P002642-PTT-DI.T<br><br>
or non-linear depending on the radial location of the outer periphery of each of the<br>
planetary gear sets 26, 28, 30. As will be described and illustrated hereinafter, planetary<br>
gearsets 26, 28 and 30 will change positions within transmission cavity 53, however, the<br>
zones described above will not change they will remain the same as shown throughout<br>
the Figures.<br>

Attorney Docket No.: P002642-PTT-DI.T<br>
|0028]	The torque-transmitting mechanism 40 may also include a<br>

torque-transmitting mechanisms 32, 34, 36, 38 and 40 are clutch mechanisms and the<br>
torque-transmitting mechanism 42 is a brake mechanism. In the engineering field, the<br>
disc-type brakes are commonly termed reaction clutches and the clutch mechanisms are<br>
referred to as rotary clutches. The transmission 16 will provide eight forward speed<br>
ratios and one reverse speed ratio between the engine 12, the torque converter 14. and the<br>
final drive mechanism 18.<br>
[0031]	As shown in Figure 1, planetary gearset 26 is disposed closest to wall 50<br>
and planetary gearset 30 is disposed closest to wall 52. Planetary gearset 28 is disposed<br>
