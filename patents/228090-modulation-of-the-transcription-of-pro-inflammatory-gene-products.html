				<td>The present invention refers to inhibitors of the transcription factors IRF-1, their use as<br>
therapeutic agents as well as their use for prevention and therapy of cardiovascular complications<br>
like re-stenosis after percutaneous angioplasty or stenosis of venous bypasses, chronic<br>
(transplant arteriosclerosis or vasculopathy) or acute transplant rejection, graft versus host<br>
disease (GVHD), immunological hypersensitivity reactions (allergies), particularly bronchial<br>
asthma and atopic dermatitis, chronic recurrent inflammatory diseases, particularly ulcerative<br>
colitis and Crohn's disease, psoriasis and sarcoidosis, as well as autoimmune diseases,<br>
particularly diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, collagenoses (e. g. systemic lupus<br>
erythematodes), rheumatoid arthritis and vasculotids.<br>
The endothelium of blood vessels plays a key role in inflammatory diseases because it represents<br>
the primary interaction site for circulating inflammation competent cells with the tissue. In acute<br>
or chronic inflammation manifold interactions between endothelium cells and both monocytes<br>
and polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes are described. Recently the interaction between<br>
endothelium cells and pro-inflammatory T helper cells (TH1) in autoimmune diseases (e. g.<br>
rheumatoid arthritis), arteriosclerotic lesions of blood vessels walls including transplant and<br>
venous bypass vasculopathy as well as re-stenosis after percutaneous angioplasty and in chronic<br>
recurrent inflammatory diseases (e. g. Crohn's disease, psoriasis) are increasingly discussed.<br>
Lymphocytes and endothelium cells communicate over the CD40/CD154 receptor/ligand system<br>
(also known as TNF receptor/ligand-5-system) with consecutive increase of expression of<br>
chemokine and adhesion molecules in the endothelium. Moreover, endothelium cells in contrast<br>
to other antigen presenting cells like monocytes seem to release biological active interleukin 12<br>
solely after activation of the CD40 signalling pathway in an amount similar to maximally<br>
stimulated monocytes (these are generally thought to be the main source of interleukin 12).<br>
Interleukin 12 is the primary stimulus and differentiation factor, respectively, for naive T helper<br>
cells which react with an increased production of interferon y and expression of CD154,<br>
respectively, on their surface (these T helper cells are then regarded as TH1 cells). Interferon y in<br>
turn increases the expression of CD40 in endothelium cells resulting in a vicious cycle in which<br>
endothelium cells, T- helper cells and recruited monocytes stimulate each other and keep the<br><br>
inflammatory reaction going<br>
The co-stimulating propeities of CD40/CD154 which trigger the inflammation have been<br>
demonstrated in animal models tor diseases including Crohn's disease and acute or chronic<br>
transplant rejection (vasculopathy). Not only the endothelium leukocyte interaction via<br>
CD40CD154 plays a role here, but also for example the CD40/CD154-mediated interaction of<br>
monocytes/macrophages or dendritic cells with TH1-cells and naive T helper cells, respectively<br>
Further CD40 may e.g be expressed by smooth muscle cells in the vessel lining and also by<br>
keratinocytes in skin or synovial fibroblasts in joints Activation of the CD40 pathway in these<br>
cells is furthermore not only of importance for inflammatory reactions, but also leads to<br>
rebuilding processes in tissue as for example remodelling of vessel lining in transplant<br>
vasculopathy. skin changes in psoriasis or erosions of joint cartilage in rheumatoid arthritis<br>
Beside CD154 induced interlukin 12 depend and TH1 mediated chronic inflammatory diseases<br>
and autoimmune reactions, respectively, including Diabetes mellitus multiple sclerosis,<br>
sarcoidosis and vasculolids the co-stimulatory properties of CD40/CD154 are also important for<br>
differentiation of B-lymphocvtcs in antibody producing plasma cells which is triggered by<br>
contact with TH2-cells Thereby B-lymphycytes express CD40 and TH2-cells express CD154<br>
Without this co-stimulation plasma cells produce primarily antibodies of the IgM type and barely<br>
antibodies of type IgE or lg(i. An exaggerated TH2 response, i. e excessive production of type<br>
IgE or IgG antibodies plays an important role in mainly allergy caused chronic recurrent<br>
inflammatory diseases as bronchial asthma, atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis but also ir<br>
collagenoses as systemic lupus ervthematodes (SLK). in which the production of autoreactive<br>
autoantibodies is of special importance and which is therefore regarded as a generalizec<br>
autoimmune disease In general differentiation between autoimmune diseases and chronic<br>
recurrent inflammatory diseases is problematic because a common predisposing factor seems tc<br>
be the imbalance between TH1 and TH2 mediated cellular and humoral immune reaction,<br>
respectively.<br>
Presently the only useful therapeutic approach for the treatment of diseases inter alia associated<br>
with the CD40/CD154 signalling pathway apart from blocking antibodies against CD 154 is<br>
the inhibition of CD40 expression in CD 154 target cells One of the drawbacks of the treatment<br>
with anti-CD 154 antibodies is the risk of hypersensitivily reactions (against the antibody),<br>
particularly with repeated application, and the poor accessibility of at least tissue-based epitopes<br>
(e g infiltrated T-lymphocytes) because antibodies must be applied into the blood However, as<br><br>
for many other cytokine receptors, too. there are no small molecular receptor antagonists for<br>
CD40 Due to trimerization of the receptor molecules after ligand binding CD40 antibodies tend<br>
to activate CD154 target cells. Other strategies delimiting from the commonly decay of the<br>
inflammatory reactions consist of the stimulation of the TH1 cell response at the preponderance<br>
of the TH2 cell response (e g. by administering of a TH1 cytokine like interferon γ) or vice versa<br>
by stimulation of the TH2 cell response at the preponderance of the THl cell response (e.g. by<br>
administering of a TH2 cytokine like interleukin-10). Because the T helper cell reactions cancel<br>
out each other by means of cytokine mediation (i.e. the preponderance of the THl cell response<br>
leads to a decay of the TH2 cell response and vice versa) these strategies hold the danger to<br>
disinhibit the respective other pathway of the T helper cell response. This may in turn leads to<br>
the possibility of the respective other inflammatory reaction.<br>
Thus, one problem of the present invention is the provision of agents for prevention and/or<br>
therapy of inflammation diseases, which among others are associated with the CD40/CD154 co-<br>
stimulation<br>
The problem is solved bv the subject matter defined in the claims.<br>

element decoys (SEQ ID NO: 13, 17, 19 and 21) in cultivated THP-1 cells and the subsequent<br>
neutralization of IRF-l The THP-1 cells were pre-incubated with the different Cis-element<br>
decoys for 1 hour and stimulated subsequently for further 3 hours with TNFα (100 U/ml) and<br>
IFNγ (1000 U/ml). The result of the following processing and analysis of the samples is shown<br>
in the left part of the image The right part of the image shows the electrophoretic mobility shift<br>
analysis of a nuclear extract of stimulated control cells prepared under identical experimental<br>
conditions. The nuclear extract was incubated additionally with an anti IRF-l antibody as<br>
described in Krzesz et al. (1999) FEBS Lett. 453, 191 prior to the electrophoretic mobility shift<br>
analysis (supershift analysis).<br>
The term "decoy-ODN" or 'Cis-element decoy" or "double stranded DNA oligonucleotide" as<br>
used herein designates a double stranded DNA molecule, having a sequence corresponding or<br>
being similar to the IRF-1 core binding sequence naturally occurring in the genome and to which<br>
the transcription factor IRF-1 binds to said sequence in the cell. The Cis-element decoy thus<br>
effects as a molecule for the competitive inhibition of IRF-l.<br>
The inventors could solve the transcription factors involved in the inflammation dependent,<br>
cytokine mediated increase of the CD40 receptor expression in human endothelium cells.<br><br>
Surprisingly it turned out that the transcription factors Nuclear Factor KB (NFKB) and Signal<br>
Transducer and Activator of Transcription-1 (STAT-1) control the tumornecrosis factor a<br>
(TNFα)/lntcrferon-y (IFNγ)-media(ed OD40 expression not in a direct way like in smooth vessel<br>
muscle cells of rodents, but in an indirect way by activating of a further transcription factor,<br>
namely the Interferon Regulatory Factor-1 (IRF-1). IRF-1 (GenBank Accession No.: L05078,<br>
XI4454, NM002198 an lutp //tiansfac.gbfde/cgi-bia/qt/getEntry.plt00423) is a transcription<br>
factor being not latent present in the cell in contrast to many other transcription factors but needs<br>
to be synthesized de novo in fact normally after exposition with Interferon-y and activation of the<br>
transcription factor STAT-1<br>
In addition Interferon-γ stimulates alone or in combination with tumornecrosis factor a in human<br>
endothelium cells the expression of CD40. In this contents the TNF-α dependent activation of<br>
NFKB plays a minor role. More important is the IFN-γ dependent activation of STAT-1 leading<br>
to the de novo expression of IRF-1. IRF-1 then induces the expression of CD40. The synergism<br>
of the two cytokines is based essentially on an amplification of the IRF-1 expression. When<br>
using the decoy oligonucleotides against STAT-1 and IRF-1 according to the present invention<br>
but not the respective control oligonucleotides in human cells in cell culture the cytokine induced<br>
CD40 expression (both in monostimulation with IRF-y and in combination of IFN-y and TNFα )<br>
is inhibited. Thereby the induction of IRF-1 precedes the induction of CD40, so that an antisense<br>
oligonucleotide blockade of the IRF-1 expression inhibits the cytokine induced CD40 expression<br>
in the same amount as the decoy oligonucleotides. A deactivation of the IRF-1 activity in cells<br>
results in a high significant and selective inhibition of the CD40 expression in these cells. As a<br>
result of the reduced CD40 expression under pro-inflammatory conditions the endothelium<br>
leukocyte interaction particularly the interaction of TH1 and endothelium cells will be toned<br>
down and represents the basis for the therapeutical success. The same applies in analogy to<br>
reduction of the CD40/CD154 mediated interaction of naive T helper cells with antigen<br>
presenting cells (e.g. monocytes, dendritic cells), of TH2 cells with B lymphocytes as well as<br>
other CD40 expressing cells (e.g. smooth muscle cells, ceratinocytes, fibroblasts) with CD154<br>
expressing cells (THI cells, activated thrombocytes).<br>
One aspect of the present invention refers therefore to the provision of an inhibitor of the activity<br>
of ilie transcription factor IRF-1 as a therapeutic substance. Proteins including also IRF-1 may be<br>
inhibited in different ways in their activity. For example anti IRF-1 antibodies, natural or<br>
synthetic substances which reduce the IRF-1 interaction with the DNA, i.e. the transactivating<br><br>
activity, may be used. The de novo synthesis of IRF-I may be farther inhibited by blockade of<br>
STAT-1 and the signaling path ways (Janus Kinasen) leading to the STAT-1 activating,<br>
respectively.<br>
A preferred method to specifically inhibit the IRF-I activity is the use of double stranded DNA<br>
oligonucleotides also named Cis-element decoy or Decoy-ODN having a binding site for IRF-1.<br>
The exogenous administration of a large amount of transcription factor binding sites to a cell<br>
particularly in a much higher amount as present in the genome leads to a situation in which the<br>
majority of a particular transcription factor binds specifically to the respective Cis-element decoy<br>
but not to the endogenous target binding sites This approach to inhibit the binding of<br>
transcription factors to their endogenous binding site is also named "squelching". Squelching<br>
(also named neutralization) of transcription by use of Cis-element decoys was successfully<br>
employed to inhibit the growth of ceils. DNA fragments were used thereby comprising the<br>
specific transcription factor binding sites of cell transcription factor E2F (Morishita et al., PNAS,<br>
(1995)02,5855).<br>
The sequence of a nucleic acid used to prevent the binding of the transcription factor IRF-l is for<br>
example a sequence to which IRF-l binds naturally in the cell IRF-l binds specifically to the<br>
motive with the sequence 5 -SAAAAGYGAAACC-3', whereby S = C or G and Y = C or T. The<br>
binding of IRF-I depends on the repetitive G/CAAA sequences and the distance between these<br>
motives being particularly three nucleotides. Therefore, the Cis-element decoy of the present<br>
invention may have the following 13-mer consensus core binding sequence: 5'-<br>
SAAAnnnSAAAyy-.V (SEQ ID NO: 1), whereby S = C or G, n = A, T, C or G and y = C or T.<br>
The Cis-element decoy may further be longer than the 13-mer core binding sequence and may be<br>
elongated at the 5- and/or 3'-terminus. Respective mutations in the core binding sequence result<br>
in a loss of the binding of STAT-1 to the decoy oligonucleotide.<br>
As the Cis-element decoy is a double stranded nucleic acid the DNA oligonucleotide according<br>
to the present invention comprises not only the sense or the forward sequence, but also the<br>
complementary antisense or reverse sequence. Preferred DNA oligonucleotides according to the<br>
present invention comprise the following 13-mer core binding sequences for IRF-l<br><br><br><br>
whereby the respective complementary sequences are not shown However, the Cis-element<br>
decoy may comprise a different sequence 10 the sequences described above and may be longer<br>
than a 13-mer<br>
The following sequences arc more preferred<br><br>
The wording ..2 binding sites refers to the sense and antisensc strand The listing of the<br>
preferred sequences is not limiting It is obvious for the skilled person that a multitude of<br>
sequences may be used as inhibitors for IRF-l as long as they comprise the conditions listed<br>
before of the 13-mer consensus core binding sequence and an affinity to IRF-l<br>
The affinity of the binding of a nucleic acid sequence to iRF-l may be determined by the<br>
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (F.MS A) (Sambrook et al (1989) Molecular Cloning Cold<br>
Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Krzesz et al (1999) FEBS Lett 453, 191) This assay system is<br>
suitable for the quality control of nucleic acids which are being used for the method of the<br>
present invention or is suitable to determine the optimal length of a binding site The assay<br>
system is also suitable for the identification of further sequences which are being bound by<br>
IRF-1 Most suitable for an HMSA which should be used for the isolation of new binding sites<br>
arc purified or recombinant expressed versions of IRF-l which are used in several alternating<br><br>
rounds of PCR multiplications and selection by EMSA (Thiesen and Bach (1990) Nucleic Acids<br>
Res 18, 3203)<br>
Genes being known to include rRF-1 binding sites in their promotor or enhancer regions and<br>
being therefore putative targets for the specific squelching by the method of the present<br>
invention are for example the CD40 gene and further pro-inflammatory genes e.g.<br>
cyclooxygenase-2, subunits of the NADPH oxidase (p67phox and gp91phox), the inducible<br>
isoform of the nitrogen monoxide (NO)-synthase, the interleukines 6, 8 and 12 as well as the<br>
adhesion molecules RANTES (secreted from T lymphocytes in soluble form, regulated upon<br>
activation, normal T cell expressed, presumed secreted) and VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion<br>
molecule-1, named also CD 106)<br>
The method of the present invention modulates the transcription of one or more genes in such a<br>
way that the gene or the genes, eg CD40, are not at all expressed or expressed in a reduced<br>
manner Reduced or inhibited expression in the sense of the present invention means that the<br>
transcription rate is reduced in comparison to cells being not treated with the double stranded<br>
DNA oligonucleotide according to the present invention. Such a reduction may be determined<br>
eg by Northern Blotting (Sambrook et al., 1989) or RT-PCR analysis (Sambrook at al., 1989).<br>
Such a reduction is typically at least a twofold, preferably at least a fivefold, more preferably at<br>
least a tenfold reduction. The loss of activation may be achieved for example when IRF-1 acts as<br>
a transcription activator on a certain gene and therefore, this squelching of the activator leads to<br>
the loss of expression of the target gene.<br>
In addition the method of the present invention enables the disinhibition of the expression of a<br>
gene provided that the expression is blocked by a constitutively active or (after corresponding<br>
stimulation of the cell) an activated transcription factor. One example is the disinhibition of the<br>
expression of the Prepro-endothelin-1 gene in native rabbit endothelium cells of V. jugularis by a<br>
Cis-element decoy against the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (Lauth et<br>
al., J. Mol. Med , (2000), 78, 441). The expression of genes the products of which exhibit a<br>
protective effect for example against inflammatory diseases may be disinhibited in this way.<br>
The Cis-element decoy used in the present invention includes in a preferred embodiment one or<br>
more, preferably 1, 2, 3, 4 or S. more preferred 1 or 2 binding sites to which IRF-1 specifically<br>
binds The nucleic acids may be generated in synthetically, with enzymatic methods or in cells.<br><br>
The respective methods are state of the an and known to the skilled person.<br>
The length of the double stranded DNA oligonucleotide is at least as long as the used sequence<br>
binding specifically to 1RF-1 Usually the used double stranded DNA oligonucleotide is between<br>
about 13-65 bp, preferably between about 13-26 bp and most preferred between 18-23 bp long.<br>
Usually oligonucleotides are degraded rapidly by endonucleases and exonucleases in particular<br>
DNases and RNases in the cell. Therefore, DNA oligonucleotides may be modified to stabilize<br>
them against degradation so that a high concentration of the oligonucleotides is maintained in the<br>
cell for a longer time. Typically such a stabilization may be achieved by the introduction of one<br>
or more modified internucleotide linkages<br>
A successfully stabilized DNA oligonucleotide contains not necessarily a modification at each<br>
internucleotide linkage. Preferably the internucleotide linkages are modified at the respective<br>
ends of both oligonucleotides of the Cis-element decoy The last six, five, four, three, two or the<br>
very last or one or more internucleotide linkages within the last six internucleotide linkages may<br>
be modified. Furthermore, different modifications of the internucleotide linkages may be<br>
introduced into the nucleic acid The double stranded DNA oligonucleotides generated in this<br>
way may be examined for their sequence specific binding to IRF-1 by use of the routine EMS A<br>
assay system. This assay system permits the determination of the binding constant of the Cis-<br>
element decoy and thus the determination whether "the affinity has been changed by way of<br>
modification. Modified Cis-element decoys having still a sufficient binding may be selected<br>
wherein a sufficient binding stands for at least about 50% or at least about 75% and more<br>
preferred about 100% of the binding of an unmodified nucleic acid.<br>
Cis-element decoys with modified internucleotide linkages exhibit still a sufficient binding may<br>
be examined whether they are more stable in the cell than the unmodified Cis-element decoys.<br>
Cells transfected with Cis-element decoys according to the present invention are examined at<br>
different times for the amount of the still existing Cis-element decoys. A Cis-element decoy<br>
labeled with a fluorescence dye (e g Texas red) or radioactively labeled (e.g. 32P) is preferably<br>
used with a subsequent digital fluorescence microscopy and autoradiography or scintigraphy,<br>
respectively A successfully modified Cis-element decoy exhibits a half life in the cell being<br>
higher than the half life of an unmodified Cis-element decoy, preferably of at least about 48<br>
hours, more preferred of at least about four days, most preferred of about at least about seven<br><br>
days.<br>
Suitable modified internucleoiido linkages are summarized in Uhlmann and Peyman ((1990)<br>
Chein. Rev. 90, 544) Modified tntemucleotide phosphate moieties and/or non phosphorus<br>
bridges in a nucleic acid used in a method of the present invention contain e.g. methyl<br>
phosphonate, phosphorothioate. phosphorodithioate, phosphoamidate, phosphate ester, whereas<br>
non phosphorus intemucleotide analogues contain e.g. siloxane bridges, carbonate bridges,<br>
carboxymethylester bridges, acetamidate bridges and/or thioether bridges.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention refers to the stabilization of nucleic acids by introduction<br>
of structural features into the nucleic acid which increase the half life of the nucleic acid. Such<br>
structures containing the hairpin and bell like DNA are disclosed in US 5,683,985. Modified<br>
intemucleotide phosphate moieties and/or non phosphorus bridges may be simultaneously<br>
introduced together with the above structures. The so generated nucleic acids may be examined<br>
with the above described assay system for the binding and stability.<br>
The core binding sequence may not only be present in a Cis-element decoy but also in a vector<br>
In a preferred embodiment the vector is a plasmid vector and more preferred a plasmid vector<br>
capable to replicate in an autosomal fashion thereby increasing the stability of the introduced<br>
double stranded nucleic acid<br>
A further aspect of the present invention refers to a double stranded DNA oligonucleotide<br>
capable of binding to the transcription factor IRF-1 in a sequence specific manner and having<br>
preferably one of the following sequences whereby only one strand of the double stranded DNA<br>
oligonucleotide is shown below but the complementary strand is also comprised.<br><br><br><br>
Double stranded DNA oligonucleotides of the present invention exhibit a length, modifications<br>
and potentially a repeat of the specific binding site as described in detail above. The optimal<br>
length of the Cis-element decoy is chosen to optimize the binding to IRF-1 and the uptake into<br>
the cell Usually a double stranded DNA oligonucleotide being shorter than 12 bp binds only in a<br>
weak manner to its target protein whereas a double stranded DNA oligonucleotide being longer<br>
than 22 bp is taken up by the cell only with low efficiency although it binds in a strong manner.<br>
The binding strength may be determined by EMSA whereas the uptake of the double stranded<br>
nucleic acid may be analyzed by means of a Cis-element decoy labeled with a fluorescent dye<br>
(eg Texas red) and radioactively labeled (e.g. 32P) Cis-element decoy with subsequent digital<br>
fluorescent microscopy and autoradiography or scintigraphy, respectively. A Cis-element decoy<br>
of the present invention may be stabilized as described above.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention refers to Cis-element decoys containing a<br>
palindromic binding site and therefore comprising in a short double stranded nucleic acid at least<br>
two transcription factor binding sites The palindromic sequence does not necessarily entail a<br>
higher binding of IRF-1 but said Cis-element decoy will be taken up more rapidly (more<br>
efficiently) by the target cells. However, particularly the shorter Cis-element decoys according to<br>
the present invention are palindromic only at the ends due to the long (centrally arranged) core<br>
binding sequence and the repetitive G/CAAA motives. A preferably simitar number of the single<br>
basis (A = C = G = T) may be used for a more efficient uptake, however, it is difficult to achieve<br>
a more efficient uptake due to the repetitive G/CAAA motive of the Cis-element decoys<br>
according to the present invention A compromise is therefore preferred wherein at least A = T<br>
and C - G. Further, preferably the core binding sequence may be arranged rather peripherally as<br>
being the case with some of the preferred Cis-element decoy sequences.<br>
A Cis-element decoy according to the present invention is quickly incorporated into the cell. A<br>
sufficient uptake is characterized by the modulation of one or more genes which may be<br>
modulated by IRF-1 The Cis-element decoy according to the present invention modulates<br>
preferably the transcription of one or more genes 4 hours after contact with the cells, more<br>
preferred after about 2 hours, after about 1 hour, after about 30 min and most preferred after<br><br>
about 10 min, A mixture usually used in such an experiment contains 10u.mol/L Cis-element<br>
decoy<br>
The present invention further relates to a method to modulate the transcription of a least one<br>
gene in CD40 expressing cells, particularly in endothelium cells, monocytes, dentritic cells, B<br>
lymphocytes, smooth muscle cells, ceratinocytes or fibroblasts, wherein the method comprises a<br>
step of contacting said cells with a mixture, containing one or more double stranded nucleic<br>
acids capable of binding to the transcription factor IRF-1 in a sequence specific manner A<br>
preferred method refers to the use in endothelium cells being part of a transplant. The method is<br>
usually used at a transplant in vivo or ex vivo prior to the implantation.<br>
The transplants may be treated pnor to the implantation by use of the method according to the<br>
present invention ex vivo or after implantation by use of the method in vivo. The treated<br>
transplant is in a preferred embodiment of (a small) intestine, heart, liver, lung, kidney and<br>
pancreas and a combination of several organs, respectively. The treatment of the organs, more<br>
precisely the perfusion/incubation of their blood vessels with the Cis-element decoys according<br>
to the present invention may occur ex vivo by rinsing the solution immediately prior to the<br>
implantation The organ may be stored simultaneously in a suitable conservation solution<br>
(refrigerated) (e.g. University of Wisconsin Solution, Brettschneider HTK solution).<br>
The mixture containing the Cis-element decoys of the present invention is contacted with the<br>
target cells (e.g. endothelium cells, monocytes, denditric cells, B lymphocytes, smooth muscle<br>
cells, ceratinocytes or fibroblasts) The goal of said contacting is the transfer of the Cis-element<br>
decoys binding FRF-1 into the target cell (i.e the CD40 expressing cell). Therefore, nucleic acid<br>
modification and/or additives or adjuvants which are known to increase the penetration of<br>
membranes may be used according to the present invention (Uhlmann and Peyman (1990)<br>
Chem. Rev. 90, 544).<br>
A mixture according to the present invention contains in a preferred embodiment only nucleic<br>
acid and buffer. A suitable concentration of the Cis-element decoys is in the range of at least 0,1<br>
to 100 µmol/L, preferably at 10 umoi/L wherein one or more suitable buffers are added. One<br>
example of such buffer is tyrode solution, containing 144.3 mmol/L Na, 4.0 mmol/L K, 138.6<br>
mmol/L CI, 1.7 mmol/L Ca2+ 1.0 mmol/L Mg2+ 0.4 mmol/L HPO42- 19.9 mmol/L HCXV, 10.0<br>
mmol/L D-glucose<br><br>
in a further embodiment of the present invention the mixture contains in addition at least one<br>
additive and/or adjuvant. Additives and/or adjuvants like lipide, cationic lipids, polymers,<br>
liposomes, nanoparticles, nucleic acid aptamers, peptides and proteins being bound to DNA, or<br>
synthetic peptide DNA molecules are intended to increase e.g. the incorporation of nucleic acids<br>
into the cell, to target the mixture to only one subgroup of cells, to prevent the degradation of the<br>
nucleic acid in a cell, to facilitate the storage of the nucleic acid mixture prior to its use.<br>
Examples for peptides and proteins are synthetic peptide DNA molecules e.g. antibodies,<br>
antibody fragments, ligands, adhesion molecules, which all may be modified or unmodified.<br>
Additives stabilizing the Cis-element decoys in the cell are e.g. nucleic acid condensing<br>
substances like cationic polymers, poly L-lysine or polyethyleneimine.<br>
The mixture being used in a method of the present invention is preferably applied locally by<br>
injection, catheter, suppository, aerosoles (nose and mouth spray, respectively, inhalation),<br>
trocars, projectiles, pluronic gels, polymers, which release medicaments permanently, or any<br>
other means, which permit local access. Also the ex vivo use of the mixture used in a method of<br>
the present invention permits a local access.<br>
The inhibition of the IRF-1 activity may, however, be inhibited not only on protein level in the<br>
above described method but may be effected prior or at the translation of the transcription factor<br>
protein A further aspect of the present invention refers, thus, to the provision of an inhibitor of<br>
the IRF-1 expression as a therapeutic substance. Said inhibitor is preferably a single stranded<br>
nucleic acid molecule, a so called antisense oligonucleotide. Antisense oligonucleotides may<br>
inhibit the synthesis of a target gene at three different levels, at the transcription (prevention of<br>
the hnRNA synthesis), the processing (splicing) of the hnRNA to mRNA and the translation of<br>
the mRNA in protein on the ribosomes. The method to inhibit the expression of genes by<br>
antisense oligonucleotides is state of the an and well known to the skilled person. The antisense<br>
oligonucleotide against IRF-1 used in the method of the present invention exhibits preferably the<br>
sequence 5'-CGAGTGATGGGCATGTTGGC-3' (SEQ ID NO 23) and bridges the start codon.<br>
Further preferred sequences of antisense oligonucleotides are 5'-GATTCGGCTGGTCGC-3'<br>
(SEQ ID NO:24). 5'-TAATCCAGATGAGCCC-3' (SEQ ID NO:25) and 5'-<br>
GGAGCGATTCGGCTGGT-3' (SEQ ID N026) The antisense oligonucleotide may be a single<br>
stranded DNA molecule, RNA molecule or a DNA/RNA-hybrid molecule. Further, the antisense<br><br>
oligonucleotide may exhibit one or more modified inlernuclcotide linkages, e.g. the above<br>
described sequences of the Cis-element decoy With an antisense oligonucleotide stabilized by<br>
phosphorothioate modi tied internucleotide linkages it has be preferably to be considered, that<br>
between the bases cytosine and guanine no phosphorothioate modified internucleotide linkage is<br>
introduced because this results in an IFNγ like activation preferably of immune competent cells<br>
(e.g. endothelium cells) and, thus, would foil the desired therapeutic effect at least in part.<br>
A further aspect according to the present invention is an antisense oligonucleotide specifically<br>
inhibiting the IRF-1 expression and preferably having one of the following sequences:<br><br>
A further aspect of the present invention refers further to the use of the antisense<br>
oligonucleotides and/or double stranded DNA molecules according to the present invention for<br>
the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention and/or therapy of cardiovascular<br>
complications like the restenosis after percutan angioplasty or the stenosis of venous bypasses,<br>
the chronic (graft atereosclcrosis or vasculopathy) or acute transplant recection, the graft versus<br>
host desease (GVAD), immunological hypersensitivity reactions (allergies), particularly<br>
bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis, chronic recurrent inflammation deseases, particularly<br>
colitis ulcerosa and Morbus Crohn, psoriasis and sarcoidosis, as well as autoimmune diseases,<br>
particularly diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, collagenous (for example systemic Lupus<br>
erythematodes), rheumatoid athritis and vasculotids. A particular advantage of this therapeutic<br>
approach further consists of the simultaneous reduction of the TH1- and TH2-cell-response to<br>
which the CD40/CD154 signalling pathway effects co-stimulatorily. Thereby it could not lead to<br>
a disinhibilion of the TH1 cell reaction (for example psoriasis) with attenuation of the TH2 cell<br>
reaction (e.g. atopic dermatitis) and vice versa, respectively.<br>
The following examples and figures explain the invention but are not intended to limit the scope<br>
of the invention.<br>

phosphorothioate linked oligonucleotides (Eurogentec, Cologne, Germany) as described by<br>
Krzesz et al. (1999) FEBS Lett 453, 191. The cultivated human endothelium cells were pre-<br>
incubated for 4 hours with a concentration of 10 u,M of the respective dODN. These were the<br>
same conditions which have been optimized previously due to EMSA and RT-PCR analyses.<br>
The dODN containing medium was usually replaced afterwards with fresh medium. The single<br>
stranded sequences of the dODNs arc set forth below (underlined letters designate<br>

missense oligonucleotide (IRF-1 MS. 5 -CGAGTGGTAGACGTATTGGC-3' (SEQ ID NO .18))<br>
and a scrambled oligonucleotide (IRF-1 SCR, 5-GAGCTGCTGAGGTCGTTGAG-3' (SEQ ID<br>

6.	Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)<br>
The endothelium cells to be analyzed were washed initially three times with I ml FACS buffer<br>
(PBS. 2% fetal calf serum sienle filtrated) each rcsuspended subsequently in 2 mJ FACS butTei<br>
The fluorescence labeled antibody (Pharmingen. San Diego. USA) was added according to the<br>
instructions of (he manufacturer (20 µl/106 cells) after ccntritugation (300xg, 5 min. +4°C) and<br>
determination of the tolal cell number (Neubauer Counting Chamber) and incubated for 30 min<br>
at 4ºC in the dark The sample was subsequently washed with 2 ml FACS buffer and<br>
centrifuged for 10 min ai 300g and 4ºC The supernatant was removed and the cell pellet was<br>
resuspended in 1 ml Cell Fix (PBS. 1% formaldehyde) and stored in the dark until measuring at<br>
4ºC (EPICS XL MCL. Coulter. Krefeld, Germany). The following antibodies were used<br>
CD40, R-Phycoerythrin (RPE)- and Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated; PECAM-I<br>
(CD3I), Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FlTC)-conjugated The respective RPE- and FITC-<br>
conjugated isotypc controls were used to determine unspecific cell antibody bindings<br>
7.	Western Blot Analysis<br>
The endothelium cells ueie macerated by 5 consecutive freeze thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen and<br>
37°C (heating block. Kleinfelden. Germany) Protein extracts were generated as described by<br>

polyacrylamidegelelectrophoresis under denaturing conditions in the presence of SDS according<br>
to a standard protocol and transferred to a BioTraceTM Polyvinylidene Fluoride<br>
Transfcrmcmbran (Pall Corporation. Rolklorf. Germany) A polyclonal primary antibody<br>
directed against the C-terminus of the CD40 protein (Research Diagnostics Inc. Flanders. NJ,<br>
USA) was used to detect the CD40 protein The protein bands were detected after adding a<br>
peroxidase coupled ami rabbit IgG (18000. Sigma. Deisenhofen, Germany) by means of a<br>
chemiluminescent method (SuperSignal Chemiluminescent Substrat; Pierce Chemical, Rockford.<br>

8.	Statistical Analysis<br>
Unless shown differently all data in figures and in the text are shown as mean ± SD of n<br>
experiments. The statistical analysis was performed with the Students t-Test for unpaired data<br>
with a p-value 
9.	Experimental Proof on Animals of the CD40/CD154 Associated Transplant Rejection<br>
The transplant rejection in rats was examined experimentally on animals by use of a STAT-1<br>
decoy oligonucleotide because STAT-1 is responsible in rats for the Interferon-y induced CD40<br>
expression rather than oflRF-1 as in humans (Krzesz et al (1909) FEBS Lett. 453, 191).<br>
Strain Combination<br>
The strain combination Brown Norway donor was used for the allogenic transplantation to Lewis<br>
recipients. Without an immunosuppression the transplant was rejected after 7 days. The<br>
transplantation from Lewis to Lewis war performed as syngenic control.<br>
Explantation<br>
The abdoman of an animal was opened in the mid line under ether inhalation narcosis. An aorta<br>
segment was first released from all arterial parts so that approximately a 1 cm long aortic<br>
segment with prospective Aleria mesenterica was prepared. The complete colon was removed in<br>
the next step. Thereafter all venous vessels of the portal vein were ligated in the latitude of the<br>
pancreas so that the pancreas was unrestrained into the porta hepatis. The so prepared donor<br>
small intestine was now attached only to the trunc of the aorta and the portal vein. The aorta was<br>
clamped proximal and distal of I he ateria mesenterica, the portal vein was severed at the porta<br>
hepatis and the vascular bed of the small intestine was rinsed with cold University of Wisconsin<br>
(UW) solution until no macroscopic blood residues were left in the vascular bed. The intestine<br>
lumen was likewise rinsed in the last step with cold UW solution, the intestine with an aorta<br>
segment was taken off and stored in cold UW solution until implantation occurred (up to<br>
120 min). When the transplant was treated with the STAT-1 Decoy Oligonucleotide (sequence:<br>
CATGTTATGCATATTCCTGTAAGTG; (SEQ ID NO:36)) or the respective mutated control<br>
nucleotide (sequence CATGTTATGCAGACCGTAGTAAGTG (SEQ ID NO:40)), the<br>
transplant was infused into the arteria mesenterica in Ringer solution (containing 145 mmol/L<br><br>
Na , 5 mmoI/L K , 156 mmol/L CI", 2 mmol/L Ca2 , 1 mmol/L Mg2', 10 mmol/L Hepes, 10<br>
mmol/L D-glucose, pH 7,4. volume 1 ml, final concentration 20 uinol/L) and rinsed with Ringer<br>
solution immediately befoie lite anastomorization<br>
implantation<br>
The abdoman of an animal was opened in the mid line in ether inhalation narcosis. The aorta and<br>
vena cava were prepared and clamped simultaneously. Vessel connection was done in end-to-<br>
side in an continuing suture technique with a 8-0 nylonstitch. The ateria mesenterica carrying the<br>
aorta segment was anastomosed at the infravenal aorta and the portal vein was anastomosed at<br>
the infravenal vena cava After release of the circulation the terminal ileum of the dornor<br>
intestine was connected end-to-sicle to the terminal ileum of the donor intestine also by a 6-0<br>
nylonstitch The mucus produced by the donor intestine was drained off into the normal passage<br>
of the animal. The oral end of the donor intestine was closed by ligature and the abdomen was<br>
continuously disclosed in a two layer fashion. The animals receive postoperatively for analgesia<br>
reasons Temgesic into their drinking water.<br>
Intravital microscopie<br>
An assessment of the importance of the leucocyte endothelium interaction for the inflammation<br>
reaction was possible only by intravital microscopy analysis This method enabled an<br>
observation of the "rolling and adhering" of leucocytes at the endothelium in vivo as well as an<br>
quantitative analysis of microvascular parameters (perfusion of the tissue, functional capillary<br>
density and blood flow)<br>
The intravital microscopy was performed with a Axiotech Vario 100 microscope from Zeiss<br>
(Gottingen) endowed with a HBO 100 mercury lamp for epifluorescence measurements. With<br>
the lOx, 20x and 40x (water immersions) lenses a solution of 243x, 476x and 933x was achieved.<br>
The microscopic images were taken with a CCD video camera (CF 8/1, Kappa) and stored for<br>
analysis on a video tape.<br>
The rats (6 animals per group) were examined 7 days after the transplantation in deep<br>
diethylether narcosis with intravital microscopy. To faciliate the breathing the trachea was<br>
cannulated. A polyurethan catheder was positioned into the arteria carotis for permanent<br>
monitoring of the blood pressure for the simplification of the application of dyes. The body<br>
temperature of the animals was held constant with a heatable plate. The animals were opened by<br><br>
a ventral median cut, the colon descendens was evacuated, a small cut was set anti mesenterially<br>
and the intestine was fixed in a specific fixture to faciliate the microscopy. To prevent a drying<br>
of the tissue, the intestine was moistened permanently with Ringer solution The intestine<br>
microcirculation was made visible by the injection of 0.8 ml 0.5% FITC (fluorescein<br>
isothiacyanate) coupled dextrane. To cover the measurements statistically a least ten differend<br>
areas of the respective intestine part was examined. The different parameters were quantified as<br>
follows: The perfusion index resulted from the perfused mucosa areas (in %) + 0.5 x of all<br>
irregularly perfused mucosa areas (in %) The functional capillary density was determined by a<br>
computer aided image analysis (CAP-IMAGE software, Zeintl, Heidelberg, Germany). To<br>
examine the leukocyte endothelial interactions the leukocytes were labeled by the injection of<br>
0.2 ml 0.1% Rhodamine-6 G (Sigma, Heidelberg, Germany) and the post capillary venoles were<br>
microscoped in the submucosa. Those leukocytes were defined as adherent leukocytes<br>
("sticker") which attached to a vessel segment 100 urn length for at least 20 sec at the<br>
endothelium. The number of the sticker number/mm2 endothelium surface was calculated. The<br>
endothelium surface resulted from the surface calculation for a cylinder.<br>
Results of the small intestine transplantation<br>
The mucosal functional capillary density as a unit of measurement of the perfusion, was reduced<br>
down to 10% of the values of syngenic transplanted small intestines both in the control group<br>
and in the group treated with the mutated control oligonucleotides without rejection. The<br>
functional capillary density was increased four times in contrast in small intestines treated with<br>
the STAT-1 Cis-element decoy The blood flow (flow rate of the erythrocytes) was in these<br>
animals 10 times higher and the perfusion index was 3 times higher. The staseindex was reduced<br>
for 60% and the number of the. leucocytes attached to the endothelium was reduced for 25%.<br>
Only the latter parameter was not statistically significant altered. The rejection induced reduction<br>
of the intestine perfusion and thus, the degeneration of the transplant was in summary<br>
significantly reduced in the group treated with the Cis-element decoy.<br><br>
