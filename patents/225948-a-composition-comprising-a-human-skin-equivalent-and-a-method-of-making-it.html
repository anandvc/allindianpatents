Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to in vitro cultured skin substitutes,, and in particular<br>
to in vitro cultured skin substitutes that have improved barrier function. In some<br>
embodiments, improved barrier function is a result of improved culture conditions, while<br>
in other embodiments, improved barrier function results from genetic modification of<br>
keratinocytes. The present invention further relates to the use of such skin substitutes for<br>
irritancy testing.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
There is a large market for test products and services that can predict effects of<br>
skin barrier function. There is a particular need for validated assays that would enable<br>
companies with early stage compounds to test for barrier function without resorting to<br>
expensive animal and human patch testing. Cosmetic companies spend approximately<br>
$50 million to $100 million per year on this type of testing. Household product and<br>
pharmaceutical companies make similar expenditures.<br>
Furthermore, there is a substantial market for products for bum therapy and for<br>
the repair or support of appropriate epithelial tissues and other wound and skin closure<br>
uses. For example, venous leg ulcers affect about 1 million people in the United States<br>
and 3 million worldwide, and other ulcer conditions such as diabetic ulcers and pressure<br>
ulcers (bedsores), affect approximately 10 million people worldwide. Venous ulcer<br>
standard care can take over 6 months to heal a wound and cost in excess of $10,000.00.<br><br>
Furthermore, foot ulcers are a leading cause of hospitalization among diabetics and are<br>
estimated to cost the U.S. healthcare system over $1 billion annually. Estimates for<br>
hospitalizations for burns in the United States range from 60,000 to 80,00 annually, and<br>
costs for recovery from acute injuries range from $36,000 to $117,000 per patient.<br>
A major function of human skin is to provide a barrier to transcutaneous water<br>
loss and a barrier to prevent entry of toxic compounds or microorganisms. Development<br>
of the epidermal permeability barrier requires the coordinated synthesis and metabolism<br>
of keratinocyte-specific protein and lipid products that are assembled into the outermost<br>
skin layer, the stratum corneum. The expression of many of the key enzymes required,<br>
for synthesis of these extracellular lipids is up-regulated during keratinocyte<br>
differentiation or following disruption of epidermal barrier function, suggesting the<br>
existence of transcription factors that function to promote barrier function development<br>
(Sando et al., J. Biol. Chem., 271(36): 22044-51 (1996); Watanabe et al., J. Biol. Chem.,<br>
273(16): 9651-5 (1998)). Barrier function is impaired by exposure to irritating<br>
substances, by infection and by a number of diseases including atopic dermatitis and<br>
psoriasis. Environmental stresses can exacerbate the effects of these conditions on the<br>
essential barrier function of the skin. Many industries are interested in what effect their<br>
product has on barrier function of the skin. For example, companies that deliver<br>
Pharmaceuticals transdermally need to facilitate the penetration of the active agent past<br>
the barrier. Cosmetic companies are interested in finding formulations that improve the<br>
barrier function.<br>
In order to test compounds or formulations early in the development process with<br>
speed and accuracy, it would be beneficial to have an in vitro test system that mimics the<br>
barrier properties of human skin. However, published studies indicate that existing skin<br>
equivalent cultures, such as EPIDERM, SKINETHICS or EPISKIN, have very poor<br>
barrier function (Ponec et al., J. Invest. Dermatol., 109(3): 348-55 (1997)). There has<br>
been substantial recent progress, however, in understanding the importance of vitamin C,<br>
nuclear hormone receptors, lipid synthesis, and humidity on the proper development of<br>
barrier function (Ponec et al., J. Invest. Dermatol., 109(3): 348-55 (1997); Denda et al., J.<br>
Invest. Dermatol., 111(5): 858-63 (1998); Hanley et al., J. Clin. Invest., 100(3): p. 705-<br>
12 (1997); Hanley et al., J. Invest. Dermatol., 113(5): 788-95 (1999)). In many cases,<br><br>
these studies focus on chemical or environmental signals that trigger the natural<br>
developmental program that establishes barrier function at a specific time in utero.<br>
Clearly, a great need exists for skin substitutes having improved barrier function.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

Definitions<br>
As used herein, the term "GKLF" when used in reference to a protein or nucleic<br>
acid refers to a protein or nucleic acid encoding a protein that shares greater than about<br>
50% identity with SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or SEQ ID NO:2 and binds to the basic<br>
transcription element of the cytochrome p450IAI promoter. Binding activity may be<br>
conveniently assayed by an electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay using the<br>
oligonucleotide GAGAAGGAGGCGTGGCCAAC (SEQ ID NO:3) as described in<br>
Zhang et al., J. Biol. Chem., 273(28): 17917-25 (1998). Thus, the term GKLF<br>
encompasses both proteins that are identical to wild-type GKLF and those that are<br>
derived from wild type GKLF (e.g., variants of GKLF or chimeric genes constructed with<br>
portions of GKLF coding regions).<br>
As used herein, the term "activity of GKLF " refers to any activity of wild type<br>
GKLF. The term is intended to encompass all activities of GKLF.<br><br>
As used herein, the terms "skin equivalent" and "skin substitute" are used<br>
interchangeably to refer to an in vitro-derived culture of keratinocytes that has stratified<br>
into squamous epithelia in what is termed an organotypic culture.<br>
As used herein, the term "dermal equivalent" is used to refer to an in vitro-derived<br>
culture comprising collagen and fibroblast cells. It is contemplated that "dermal<br>
equivalents" can serve as substrates for differentiation of keratinocytes in an organotypic<br>
culture.<br>
As used herein, the term "air interface" refers to the interface between the<br>
atmosphere and liquid medium in a culture dish.<br>
As used herein the term "substantially adhered to a side-wall," when used in<br>
reference to a dermal equivalent, refers to the physical adherence of a dermal equivalent<br>
to a substantially vertical wall, as opposed to the dermal equivalent contracting or pulling<br>
away from the substantially vertical wall.<br>
As used herein, the term "organotypic" culture refers to a three-dimensional tissue<br>
culture where cultured cells are used to reconstruct a tissue or organ in vitro.<br>
As used herein, the term "NIKS cells" refers to cells having the characteristics of<br>
the cells deposited as cell line ATCC CRL-12191.<br>
As used herein, the term "NHDF" refers to cells having the characteristics of<br>
normal human dermal fibroblasts.<br>
As used herein, the term "content of ceramides" refers to the amount of ceramides<br>
in a skin equivalent sample as assayed by high-performance thin-layer chromatography.<br>
As used herein, the term "skin irritant" refers to a compound that, when applied to<br>
skin or a skin equivalents, elicits a cellular response characterized by the expression of an<br>
"irritant responsive gene." Examples of known skin irritants include, but are not limited<br>
to, SDS, calcipotriol, and trans-retinoic acid. The term "skin irritant" is also intended to<br>
encompass unknown or suspected irritants, including but not limited to, those containing<br>
in some pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and consumer products.<br>
As used herein, the term "irritant responsive gene" refers to a gene that is<br>
expressed to a greater level (e.g., as measured by the level of mRNA expression) in the<br>
presence of a skin irritant. Examples of irritant responsive genes include, but are not<br><br>
limited to, Interleukin-8 and Interleukin-1α. The term "irritant responsive gene" is also<br>
intended to encompass unknown irritant responsive genes (e.g., those identified by the<br>
methods of the present invention).<br>
The term "gene" refers to a nucleic acid (e.g., DNA) sequence that comprises<br>
coding sequences necessary for the production of a polypeptide or precursor (e.g.,<br>
GKLF). The polypeptide can be encoded by a full length coding sequence or by any<br>
portion of the coding sequence so long as the desired activity or functional properties<br>
(e.g., enzymatic activity, ligand binding, signal transduction, etc.) of the full-length or<br>
fragment are retained. The term also encompasses the coding region of a structural gene<br>
and the including sequences located adjacent to the coding region on both the 5' and 3'<br>
ends for a distance of about 1 kb on either end such that the gene corresponds to the<br>
length of the full-length mRNA. The sequences that are located 5' of the coding region<br>
and which are present on the mRNA are referred to as 5' untranslated sequences. The<br>
sequences that are located 3' or downstream of the coding region and that are present on<br>
the mRNA are referred to as 3' untranslated sequences. The term "gene" encompasses<br>
both cDNA and genomic forms of a gene. A genomic form or clone of a gene contains<br>
the coding region interrupted with non-coding sequences termed "introns" or "intervening<br>
regions" or "intervening sequences." Introns are segments of a gene that are transcribed<br>
into nuclear RNA (hnRNA); introns may contain regulatory elements such as enhancers.<br>
Introns are removed or "spliced out" from the nuclear or primary transcript; introns<br>
therefore are absent in the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript. The mRNA functions<br>
during translation to specify the sequence or order of amino acids in a nascent<br>
polypeptide.<br>
In particular, the term " GKLF gene" refers to the full-length GKLF nucleotide<br>
sequence (e.g., contained in SEQ ID NO:2). However, it is also intended that the term<br>
encompass fragments of the GKLF sequence, as well as other domains within the full-<br>
length GKLF nucleotide sequence. Furthermore, the terms 'GKLF nucleotide sequence"<br>
or " GKLF polynucleotide sequence" encompasses DNA, cDNA, and RNA (e.g., mRNA)<br>
sequences.<br>
As used herein, the term "gene array" refers to a solid support (e.g., a filter, a<br>
glass slide, or a microchip) to which a plurality of nucleic acid sequences are affixed. As<br><br>
used herein, the term "gene expression array" refers to a gene array for use in measuring<br>
the expression of genes that are contained on the array. In preferred embodiments, the<br>
nucleic acid sequences affixed to a gene expression array are cDNA sequences.<br>
Where amino acid sequence is recited herein to refer to an amino acid sequence of<br>
a naturally occurring protein molecule, amino acid sequence and like terms, such as<br>
polypeptide or protein are not meant to limit the amino acid sequence to the complete,<br>
native amino acid sequence associated with the recited protein molecule.<br>
In addition to containing introns, genomic forms of a gene may also include<br>
sequences located on both the 5' and 3' end of the sequences that are present on the RNA<br>
transcript. These sequences are referred to as "flanking" sequences or regions (these<br>
flanking sequences are located 5' or 3' to the non-translated sequences present on the<br>
mRNA transcript). The 5' flanking region may contain regulatory sequences such as<br>
promoters and enhancers that control or influence the transcription of the gene. The 3'<br>
flanking region may contain sequences that direct the termination of transcription,<br>
post-transcriptional cleavage and polyadenylation.<br>
The term "wild-type" refers to a gene or gene product that has the characteristics<br>
of that gene or gene product when isolated from a naturally occurring source. A wild-<br>
type gene is that which is most frequently observed in a population and is thus arbitrarily<br>
designed the "normal" or "wild-type" form of the gene. In contrast, the terms "modified",<br>
"mutant", and "variant" refer to a gene or gene product that displays modifications in<br>
sequence and or functional properties (i.e., altered characteristics) when compared to the<br>
wild-type gene or gene product. It is noted that naturally-occurring mutants can be<br>
isolated; these are identified by the fact that they have altered characteristics when<br>
compared to the wild-type gene or gene product.<br>
As used herein, the terms "nucleic acid molecule encoding," "DNA sequence<br>
encoding," and "DNA encoding" refer to the order or sequence of deoxyribonucleotides<br>
along a strand of deoxyribonucleic acid. The order of these deoxyribonucleotides<br>
determines the order of amino acids along the polypeptide (protein) chain. The DNA<br>
sequence thus codes for the amino acid sequence.<br>
As used herein, the terms "an oligonucleotide having a nucleotide sequence<br>
encoding a gene" and "polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence encoding a gene,"<br><br>
means a nucleic acid sequence comprising the coding region, of a gene or, in other words,<br>
the nucleic acid sequence that encodes a gene product. The coding region may be present<br>
in either a cDNA, genomic DNA, or RNA form. When present in a DNA form, the<br>
oligonucleotide or polynucleotide may be single-stranded (i.e., the sense strand) or<br>
double-stranded. Suitable control elements such as enhancers/promoters, splice<br>
junctions, polyadenylation signals, etc. may be placed in close proximity to the coding<br>
region of the gene if needed to permit proper initiation of transcription and/or correct<br>
processing of the primary RNA transcript. Alternatively, the coding region utilized in the<br>
expression vectors of the present invention may contain endogenous<br>
enhancers/promoters, splice junctions, intervening sequences, polyadenylation signals,<br>
etc. or a combination of both endogenous and exogenous control elements.<br>
As used herein, the term "regulatory element" refers to a genetic element that<br>
controls some aspect of the expression of nucleic acid sequences. For example, a<br>
promoter is a regulatory element that facilitates the initiation of transcription of an<br>
operably linked coding region. Other regulatory elements include splicing signals,<br>
polyadenylation signals, termination signals, etc.<br>
As used herein, the terms "complementary" or "complementarity" are used in<br>
reference to polynucleotides (i.e., a sequence of nucleotides) related by the base-pairing<br>
rules. For example, the sequence "5'-A-G-T-3"' is complementary to the sequence "3'-T-<br>
C-A-5'." Complementarity may be "partial," in which only some of the nucleic acids'<br>
bases are matched according to the base pairing rules. Or, mere may be "complete" or<br>
"total" complementarity between the nucleic acids. The degree of complementarity<br>
between nucleic acid strands has significant effects on the efficiency and strength of<br>
hybridization between nucleic acid strands. This is of particular importance in<br>
amplification reactions, as well as detection methods that depend upon binding between<br>
nucleic acids.<br>
The term "homology" refers to a degree of complementarity. There may be<br>
partial homology or complete homology (i.e., identity). A partially complementary<br>
sequence is one that at least partially inhibits a completely complementary sequence from<br>
hybridizing to a target nucleic acid and is referred to using the functional term<br>
"substantially homologous." The term "inhibition of binding," when used in reference to<br><br>
nucleic acid binding, refers to inhibition of binding caused by competition of homologous<br>
sequences for binding to a target sequence. The inhibition of hybridization of the<br>
completely complementary sequence to the target sequence may be examined using a<br>
hybridization assay (Southern or Northern blot, solution hybridization and the like) under<br>
conditions of low stringency. A substantially homologous sequence or probe will<br>
compete for and inhibit the binding (i.e., the hybridization) of a completely homologous<br>
to a target under conditions of low stringency. This is not to say that conditions of low<br>
stringency are such that non-specific binding is permitted; low stringency conditions<br>
require that the binding of two sequences to one another be a specific (i.e., selective)<br>
interaction. The absence of non-specific binding may be tested by the use of a second<br>
target that lacks even a partial degree of complementarity (e.g., less than about 30%<br>
identity); in the absence of non-specific binding the probe will not hybridize to the<br>
second non-complementary target.<br>
The art knows well that numerous equivalent conditions may be employed to<br>
comprise low stringency conditions; factors such as the length and nature (DNA, RNA,<br>
base composition) of the probe and nature of the target (DNA, RNA, base composition,<br>
present in solution or immobilized, etc.) and the concentration of the salts and other<br>
components (e.g., the presence or absence of formamide, dextran sulfate, polyethylene<br>
glycol) are considered and the hybridization solution may be varied to generate<br>
conditions of low stringency hybridization different from, but equivalent to, the above<br>
listed conditions. In addition, the art knows conditions that promote hybridization under<br>
conditions of high stringency (e.g., increasing the temperature of the hybridization and/or<br>
wash steps, the use of formamide in the hybridization solution, etc.).<br>
When used in reference to a double-stranded nucleic acid sequence such as a<br>
cDNA or genomic clone, the term "substantially homologous" refers to any probe that<br>
can hybridize to either or both strands of the double-stranded nucleic acid sequence under<br>
conditions of low stringency as described below.<br>
When used in reference to a single-stranded nucleic acid sequence, the term<br>
"substantially homologous" refers to any probe that can hybridize (i.e., it is the<br>
complement of) the single-stranded nucleic acid sequence under conditions of low<br>
stringency as described above.<br><br>
As used herein, the term "competes for binding" is used in reference to a first<br>
polypeptide with an activity which binds to the same substrate as does a second<br>
polypeptide with an activity, where the second polypeptide is a variant of the first<br>
polypeptide or a related or dissimilar polypeptide. The efficiency (e.g., kinetics or<br>
thermodynamics) of binding by the first polypeptide may be the same as. greater than, or<br>
less than the efficiency of substrate binding by the second polypeptide. For example, the<br>
equilibrium binding constant (KD)) for binding to the substrate may be different for the<br>
two polypeptides. The term "Km" as used herein refers to the Michaelis-Menton constant<br>
for an enzyme and is defined as the concentration of the specific substrate at which a<br>
given enzyme yields one-half its maximum velocity in an enzyme catalyzed reaction.<br>
As used herein, the term "hybridization" is used in reference to the pairing of<br>
complementary nucleic acids. Hybridization and the strength of hybridization (i.e., the<br>
strength of the association between the nucleic acids) is impacted by such factors as the<br>
degree of complementary between the nucleic acids, stringency of the conditions<br>
involved, the Tm of the formed hybrid, and the G:C ratio within the nucleic acids.<br>
As used herein, the term "Tm" is used in reference to the "melting temperature."<br>
The melting temperature is the temperature at which a population of double-stranded<br>
nucleic acid molecules becomes half dissociated into single strands. The equation for<br>
calculating the Tm of nucleic acids is well known in the art. As indicated by standard<br>
references, a simple estimate of the Tm value may be calculated by the equation: Tm =<br>
81.5 + 0.41(% G + C), when a nucleic acid is in aqueous solution at 1 M NaCl (See e.g.,<br>
Anderson and Young, Quantitative Filter Hybridization, in Nucleic Acid Hybridization<br>
[1985]). Other references include more sophisticated computations that take structural as<br>
well as sequence characteristics into account for the calculation of Tm.<br>
As used herein the term "stringency" is used in reference to the conditions of<br>
temperature, ionic strength, and the presence of other compounds such as organic<br>
solvents, under which nucleic acid hybridizations are conducted. Those skilled in the art<br>
will recognize that "stringency" conditions may be altered by varying the parameters just<br>
described either individually or in concert. With "high stringency" conditions, nucleic<br>
acid base pairing will occur only between nucleic acid fragments that have a high<br><br>
frequency of complementary base sequences (e.g., hybridization under "high stringency"<br>
conditions may occur between homologs with about 85-100% identity, preferably about<br>
70-100% identity). With medium stringency conditions, nucleic acid base pairing will<br>
occur between nucleic acids with an intermediate frequency of complementary base<br>
sequences (e.g., hybridization under "medium stringency" conditions may occur between<br>
homologs with about 50-70% identity). Thus, conditions of "weak" or "low" stringency<br>
are often required with nucleic acids that are derived from organisms that are genetically<br>
diverse, as the frequency of complementary sequences is usually less.<br>
"High stringency conditions" when used in reference to nucleic acid hybridization<br>
comprise conditions equivalent to binding or hybridization at 42 C in a solution<br>
consisting of 5X SSPE (43.8 g/l NaCl, 6.9 g/1 NaH2PO4 H2O and 1.85 g/1 EDTA, pH<br>
adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH), 0.5% SDS, 5X Denhardt's reagent and 100 μg/ml denatured<br>
salmon sperm DNA followed by washing in a solution comprising 0. 1X SSPE, 1.0% SDS<br>
at 42°C when a probe of about 500 nucleotides in length is employed.<br>
"Medium stringency conditions" when used in reference to nucleic acid<br>
hybridization comprise conditions equivalent to binding or hybridization at 42 C in a<br>
solution consisting of 5X SSPE (43.8 g/1 NaCl, 6.9 g/1 NaH2PO4 H2O and 1.85 g/1<br>
EDTA, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH), 0.5% SDS, 5X Denhardt's reagent and 100 μg/ml<br>
denatured salmon sperm DNA followed by washing in a solution comprising 1.0X SSPE,<br>
1.0% SDS at 42°C when a probe of about 500 nucleotides in length is employed.<br>
"Low stringency conditions" comprise conditions equivalent to binding or<br>
hybridization at 42°C in a solution consisting of 5X SSPE (43.8 g/1 NaCl, 6.9 g/1<br>
NaH2PO4 H2O and 1.85 g/1 EDTA, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH), 0.1% SDS, 5X<br>
Denhardt's reagent [50X Denhardt's contains per 500 ml: 5 g Ficoll (Type 400,<br>
Pharamcia), 5 g BSA (Fraction V; Sigma)] and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA<br>
followed by washing in a solution comprising 5X SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 42°C when a probe<br>
of about 500 nucleotides in length is employed.<br>
The following terms are used to describe the sequence relationships between two<br>
or more polynucleotides: "reference sequence", "sequence identity", "percentage of<br>
sequence identity", and "substantial identity". A "reference sequence" is a defined<br><br>
sequence used as a basis for a sequence comparison; a reference sequence may be a<br>
subset of a larger sequence, for example, as a segment of a full-length cDNA sequence<br>
given in a sequence listing or may comprise a complete gene sequence. Generally, a<br>
reference sequence is at least 20 nucleotides in length, frequently at least 25 nucleotides<br>
in length, and often at least 50 nucleotides in length. Since two polynucleotides may<br>
each (1) comprise a sequence (i.e., a portion of the complete polynucleotide sequence)<br>
that is similar between the two polynucleotides, and (2) may further comprise a sequence<br>
that is divergent between the two polynucleotides, sequence; comparisons between two<br>
(or more) polynucleotides are typically performed by comparing sequences of the two<br>
polynucleotides over a "comparison window" to identify and compare local regions of<br>
sequence similarity. A "comparison window", as used herein, refers to a conceptual<br>
segment of at least 20 contiguous nucleotide positions wherein a polynucleotide sequence<br>
may be compared to a reference sequence of at least 20 contiguous nucleotides and<br>
wherein the portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may<br>
comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) of 20 percent or less as compared to the<br>
reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal<br>
alignment of the two sequences. Optimal alignment of sequences for aligning a<br>
comparison window may be conducted by the local homology algorithm of Smith and<br>
Waterman [Smith and Waterman, Adv. Appl. Math. 2: 482 (1981)] by the homology<br>
alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch [Needleman and Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol.<br>
48:443 (1970)], by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman [Pearson and<br>
Lipman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 85:2444 (1988)], by computerized<br>
implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the<br>
Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Release 7.0, Genetics Computer Group, 575<br>
Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by inspection, and the best alignment (i.e., resulting in<br>
the highest percentage of homology over the comparison window) generated by the<br>
various methods is selected. The term "sequence identity" means that two polynucleotide<br>
sequences are identical (i.e., on a nucleotide-by-nucleotide basis) over the window of<br>
comparison. The term "percentage of sequence identity" is calculated by comparing two<br>
optimally aligned sequences over the window of comparison, determining the number of<br>
positions at which the identical nucleic acid base (e.g., A, T, C, G, U, or I) occurs in both<br><br>
sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched<br>
positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison (i.e., the window<br>
size), and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. The<br>
terms "substantial identity" as used herein denotes a characteristic of a polynucleotide<br>
sequence, wherein the polynucleotide comprises a sequence: that has at least 85 percent<br>
sequence identity, preferably at least 90 to 95 percent sequence identity, more usually at<br>
least 99 percent sequence identity as compared to a reference sequence over a<br>
comparison window of at least 20 nucleotide positions, frequently over a window of at<br>
least 25-50 nucleotides, wherein the percentage of sequences identity is calculated by<br>
comparing the reference sequence to the polynucleotide sequence which may include<br>
deletions or additions which total 20 percent or less of the reference sequence over the<br>
window of comparison. The reference sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence, for<br>
example, as a segment of the full-length sequences of the compositions claimed in the<br>
present invention (e.g., GKLF).<br>
As applied to polypeptides, the term "substantial identity" means that two peptide<br>
sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using<br>
default gap weights, share at least 80 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 90<br>
percent sequence identity, more preferably at least 95 percent sequence identity or more<br>
(e.g., 99 percent sequence identity). Preferably, residue positions that are not identical<br>
differ by conservative amino acid substitutions. Conservative amino acid substitutions<br>
refer to the interchangeability of residues having similar side chains. For example, a<br>
group of amino acids having aliphatic side chains is glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and<br>
isoleucine; a group of amino acids having aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains is serine and<br>
threonine; a group of amino acids having amide-containing side chains is asparagine and<br>
glutamine; a group of amino acids having aromatic side chains is phenylalanine, tyrosine,<br>
and tryptophan; a group of amino acids having basic side chains is lysine, arginine, and<br>
histidine; and a group of amino acids having sulfur-containing side chains is cysteine and<br>
methionine. Preferred conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-leucine-<br>
isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, and asparagine-<br>
glutamine.<br><br>
As used herein, the term "recombinant DNA molecule" as used herein refers to a<br>
DNA molecule that is comprised of segments of DNA joined together by means of<br>
molecular biological techniques.<br>
The term "isolated" when used in relation to a nucleic acid, as in "an isolated<br>
oligonucleotide" or "isolated polynucleotide" refers to a nucleic acid sequence that is<br>
identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid with which it is<br>
ordinarily associated in its natural source. Isolated nucleic acid is present in a form or<br>
setting that is different from that in which it is found in nature. La contrast, non-isolated<br>
nucleic acids are nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA found in the state they exist in<br>
nature. For example, a given DNA sequence (e.g., a gene) is found on the host cell<br>
chromosome in proximity to neighboring genes; RNA sequences, such as a specific<br>
mRNA sequence encoding a specific protein, are found in the cell as a mixture with<br>
numerous other mRNAs that encode a multitude of proteins. However, isolated nucleic<br>
acid encoding GKLF includes, by way of example, such nucleic acid in cells ordinarily<br>
expressing GKLF where the nucleic acid is in a chromosomal location different from that<br>
of natural cells, or is otherwise flanked by a different nucleic acid sequence than that<br>
found in nature. The isolated nucleic acid, oligonucleotide., or polynucleotide may be<br>
present in single-stranded or double-stranded form. When an isolated nucleic acid,<br>
oligonucleotide or polynucleotide is to be utilized to express a protein, the<br>
oligonucleotide or polynucleotide will contain at a minimum the sense or coding strand<br>
(i.e., the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide may single-stranded), but may contain both<br>
the sense and anti-sense strands (i.e., the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide may be<br>
double-stranded).<br>
As used herein the term "portion" when in reference to a nucleotide sequence (as<br>
in "a portion of a given nucleotide sequence") refers to fragments of that sequence. The<br>
fragments may range in size from four nucleotides to the entire nucleotide sequence<br>
minus one nucleotide (10 nucleotides, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 200, etc.).<br>
As used herein the term "coding region" when used in reference to structural gene<br>
refers to the nucleotide sequences that encode the amino acids found in the nascent<br>
polypeptide as a result of translation of a mRNA molecule. The coding region is<br>
bounded, in eukaryotes, on the 5' side by the nucleotide triplet "ATG" that encodes the<br><br>
initiator methionine and on the 3' side by one of the three triplets that specify stop codons<br>
(i.e., TAA, TAG, TGA).<br>
As used herein, the term "purified" or "to purify" refers to the removal of<br>
contaminants from a sample.<br>
As used herein, the term "vector" is used in references to nucleic acid molecules<br>
that transfer DNA segments) from one cell to another. The term "vehicle" is sometimes<br>
used interchangeably with "vector."<br>
The term "expression vector" as used herein refers to a recombinant DNA<br>
molecule containing a desired coding sequence and appropriate nucleic acid sequences<br>
necessary for the expression of the operably linked coding sequence in a particular host<br>
organism. Nucleic acid sequences necessary for expression in prokaryotes usually<br>
include a promoter, an operator (optional), and a ribosome binding site, often along with<br>
other sequences. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, enhancers, and<br>
termination and polyadenylation signals.<br>
As used herein, the term "host cell" refers to any eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell<br>
(e.g., bacterial cells such as E. coli, yeast cells, mammalian cells, avian cells, amphibian<br>
cells, plant cells, fish cells, and insect cells), whether located in vitro or in vivo. For<br>
example, host cells may be located in a transgenic animal.<br>
The terms "overexpression" and "overexpressing" and grammatical equivalents,<br>
are used in reference to levels of mRNA to indicate a level of expression approximately<br>
3-fold higher than that typically observed in a given tissue in a control or non-transgenic<br>
animal. Levels of mRNA are measured using any of a number of techniques known to<br>
those skilled in the art including, but not limited to Northern blot analysis. Appropriate<br>
controls are included on the Northern blot to control for differences in the amount of<br>
RNA loaded from each tissue analyzed (e.g., the amount of 28S rRNA, an abundant RNA<br>
transcript present at essentially the same amount in all tissues, present in each sample can<br>
be used as a means of normalizing or standardizing the GKLF mRNA-specific signal<br>
observed on Northern blots). The amount of mRNA present in the band corresponding in<br>
size to the correctly spliced GKLF transgene RNA is quantified; other minor species of<br>
RNA which hybridize to the transgene probe are not considered in the quantification of<br>
the expression of the transgenic mRNA.<br><br>
The term "transfection" as used herein refers to the introduction of foreign DNA<br>
into eukaryotic cells. Transfection may be accomplished by a variety of means known to<br>
the art including calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation, DEAE-dextran-mediated<br>
transfection, polybrene-mediated transfection, electroporation, microinjection, liposome<br>
fusion, lipofection, protoplast fusion, retroviral infection, and biolistics.<br>

The original technique of Graham and van der Eb (Graham and van der Eb, Virol.,<br>
52:456 [1973]), has been modified by several groups to optimize conditions for particular<br>
types of cells. The art is well aware of these numerous modifications.<br>

Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to in vitro cultured skin substitutes, and in particular<br>
to in vitro cultured skin substitutes that have improved barrier function. In some<br>
embodiments, improved barrier function is a result of improved culture conditions, while<br>
in other embodiments, improved barrier function results from genetic modification of<br>
keratinocytes. m still other embodiments, the present invention provides skin substitutes<br>
comprising reporter gene constructs (e.g., irritant responsive; reporter gene constructs).<br>
Human skin protects the body from environmental insults such as chemicals and<br>
microorganisms. It is also critical for preventing the loss of water from our bodies.<br>
Defects in skin barrier function have detrimental effects leading to entry of poisonous<br>
substances, infection or severe water loss. Sometimes it is desirable to improve the<br>
barrier function of the skin for medical, infant care or cosmetic reasons, while at other<br>
times it would be advantageous to lower the permeability barrier; to administer drugs<br>
transdermally, for example. Pharmaceutical, cosmetic and consumer product companieis<br>
all have products that may come into contact with the skin. These companies need to<br>
know early in the development process whether their compound or formulation will<br>
affect the essential barrier function of the skin. Excised skin tissue has been used for<br>
measuring percutaneous absorption but a number of problems with this preparation have<br>
been noted in the literature. There are differences in absorption between human and<br>
animal skin that can result in misleading results and the availability of human tissue is<br>
variable. There are also growing political and social pressures to eliminate or reduce the<br>
number of animals being used for safety testing.<br>
These difficulties and the growing need to understand the permeability properties<br>
of new formulations and potential transdermal therapeutics have led to many studies to<br>
improve the permeability properties of in vitro skin equivalent cultures. The<br>
development of a cultured skin substitute that recapitulates the barrier properties of<br>
human skin will also provide a better source of synthetic tissue for burn therapy. The<br>
availability of cultured skin substitutes that more closely resemble human skin will<br>
facilitate the testing of cosmetics, Pharmaceuticals, and other topical compounds by<br>
reducing the reliance on animal testing of these products.<br><br>
Stratified squamous epithelia, such as skin and oral epithelia, are multilayered<br>
renewal tissues composed primarily of keratinocytes. Differentiated keratinocytes are<br>
continuously lost from the surface and replaced by the proliferation of basal<br>
keratinocytes. The rate at which a basal call initiates and completes its differentiation<br>
program appears to be tightly regulated, although the molecular controls for such<br>
regulation are ill-defined (Fuchs, J. Cell. Sci. Suppl., 17: 197-208 (1993)). In vivo, the<br>
final stages of the terminal differentiation process are characterized by numerous changes<br>
including filaggrin-mediated keratin intermediate filament bundling, and release of lipids<br>
from membrane-coating granules into the intercellular space (Schurer et al.,<br>
Dermatologica, 183: 77-94 (1991)). The cornified envelopes, another terminal<br>
differentiation structure consisting of several proteins that are covalently crosslinked by<br>
the action of calcium-dependent transglutaminases, is also formed in differentiating<br>
keratinocytes (Aeschlimann et al., Thrombosis &amp; Haemostasis, 71(4): 402-15 (1994);<br>
Reichert et al., The cornified envelope: a key structure of terminally differentiating<br>
keratinocytes, in Molecular Biology of the Skin, M. Darmon, Editor. 1993, Academic<br>
Press, Inc.: San Diego. 107-150 (1993)). In the epidermis, keratinocytes lose intracellular<br>
organelles and enucleate in the upper layers of the tissue, fanning a "dead shell" with<br>
high tensile strength. Molecular mechanisms which govern keratinocyte enucleation and<br>
terminal differentiation are poorly understood. Studies ((Sachsenmeier et al., J. Biol.<br>
Chem., 271: 5-8 (1996); Hines et al., Promega Notes, 59: p. 30-36 (1996); Hines et al., J.<br>
Biol. Chem., 271(11): 6245-6251 (1996); Polakowska et al., Developmental Dynamics,<br>
199(3): 176-88 (1994); Haake et al., J. Invest. Derm. Symp. Proc., 3: 28-35 (1998))<br>
suggest that terminal differentiation in keratinocytes may constitute a special form of<br>
apoptotic cell death.<br>
Human skin is composed of a dermal layer containing fibroblasts embedded in an<br>
extracellular protein matrix and an epidermal layer, consisting primarily of keratinocytes<br>
that differentiate to form the outermost, impermeable skin layer. The primary function of<br>
human skin is to provide a physical barrier to prevent excessive loss of bodily fluid due to<br>
evaporation. Barrier function is localized in the stratum corneum of the skin. The stratum<br>
corneum has been described as an array of impermeable keratin-filled cells embedded in<br>
a matrix of lipid, analogous to a brick wall. Critical components of the stratum comeum<br><br>
barrier are the lipids deposited by the keratinocytes during formation of the stratum<br>
corneum. In the stratum granulosum, keratinocytes contain keratohyalin granules and<br>
lamellar bodies. At the stratum granulosum/stratum comeum interface, the lamellar<br>
bodies fuse with the plasma membrane and extrude their lipid contents into the<br>
intercellular space. A number of enzymes are also released which serve to process<br>
phospholipids and glucosylceramides to fatty acids and ceramides respectively. The<br>
extracellular lipids of the stratum corneum are assembled into multilamellar structures<br>
that surround the keratin-filled comified envelopes produced from the keratinocytes.<br>
Stratum corneum lipids comprise 10-15% of the dry weight of the tissue and consist<br>
primarily (by weight) of ceramides (50%), cholesterol (25%) and free fatty acids (10%)<br>
in roughly equimolar amounts (Wertz et al., Chem. Phys. Lipids., 91(2): 85-96 (1998)).<br>
These lipids are derived principally from biosynthesis in the keratinocytes. A portion of<br>
the ceramides have the unusual role of forming covalent bonds with groups at the surface<br>
of the comified envelopes, including bonds to involucrin. This covalently bound omega-<br>
hydroxyceramide forms a lipid monolayer surrounding the outer surface of the comified<br>
cells. The precise role of this structure is unknown. Recently the importance of omega-<br>
hydroxyceramides on barrier function was demonstrated by inhibiting their formation in<br>
hairless mouse skin with an inhibitor of the CYP4 P-450 omega hydroxylase (Behne et<br>
al., J. Invest. Dermatol., 114(1): 185-92 (2000)).<br>
After the discovery that ruthenium tetroxide could be used to reveal the lamellae<br>
in electron microscopy, analysis of stratum corneum ultrastructure has provided<br>
important insights into the quality of the stratum corneum. For example, studies have<br>
examined the presence of lamellar bodies in the stratum granulosum, the appropriate<br>
excretion of lamellar body contents at the stratum granulosum/stratum comeum interface<br>
and the presence of alternating electron dense and electron lucent bands of the lipid<br>
lamellae. Electron microscopy also reveals electron dense desmosomes in the stratum<br>
corneum, occupying ~15% of the intercellular spaces and possibly important in cell-cell<br>
adherence.<br>
The present invention provides skin substitutes having improved barrier function,<br>
and compositions and methods for making skin substitutes: having improved barrier<br>
function. For convenience, the description of the invention is presented in the following<br><br>
sections: A) Sources of Keratinocytes and Other Cells for Creating Skin Substitutes<br>
Having Improved Barrier Function; B) Culture Conditions for Creating Improved Barrier<br>
Function in Skin Substitutes; C) Genetic Modification of Cells for Improved barrier<br>
Function; and D) Uses of Skin Substitutes having Improved Barrier Function.<br>
A. Sources of Keratinocytes and Other Cells for Creating Skin<br>
Substitutes<br>
It is contemplated that the methods of the present invention can be used to create<br>
skin substitutes having improved barrier function. Generally, any source of cells or cell<br>
line that can stratify into squamous epithelia are useful in the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is not limited to the use of any particular source of<br>
cells that are capable of differentiating into squamous epithelia. Indeed, the present<br>
invention contemplates the use of a variety of cell lines and sources that can differentiate<br>
into squamous epithelia, including both primary and immortalized keratinocytes. Sources<br>
of cells include keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts biopsied from humans and cavaderic<br>
donors (Auger et al., In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. - Animal 36:96-103; U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>
5,968,546 and 5,693,332, each of which is incorporated herein by reference), neonatal<br>
foreskins (Asbill et al., Pharm. Research 17(9): 1092-97 (2000); Meana et al., Burns<br>
24:621-30 (1998); U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,096; 6,039,760; and 5,536,656, each of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference), and immortalized keratinocytes cell lines such as NM1<br>
cells (Baden, In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 23(3):205-213 (1987)), HaCaT cells (Boucamp et<br>
al., J. cell. Boil. 106:761-771 (1988)); and NIKS cells (Cell line BC-1-Ep/SL; U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 5,989,837, incorporated herein by reference; ATCC CRL-12191). Each of these cell<br>
lines can be cultured or genetically modified as described below in order to improve<br>
barrier function of the resulting skin equivalent.<br>
In particularly preferred embodiments, NIKS cells, are utilized. The discovery of<br>
a novel human keratinocyte cell line (near-diploid immortalized keratinocytes or NIKS)<br>
provides an opportunity to genetically engineer human keratinocytes for new in vitro<br>
testing methods. A unique advantage of the NIKS cells is that they are a consistent<br>
source of genetically-uniform, pathogen-free human keratinocytes. For this reason, they<br>
are useful for the application of genetic engineering and genomic gene expression<br><br>
approaches to provide skin equivalent cultures with properties more similar to human<br>
skin. Such systems will provide an important alternative to the use of animals for testing<br>
compounds and formulations. The NIKS keratinocyte cell line, identified and<br>
characterized at the University of Wisconsin, is nontumorigenic, exhibits a stable<br>
karyotype, and exhibits normal differentiation both in monolayer and organotypic culture.<br>
NIKS cells form fully stratified skin equivalents in culture. These cultures are<br>
indistinguishable by all criteria tested thus far from organotypic cultures formed from<br>
primary human keratinocytes. Unlike primary cells however, the immortalized NIKS<br>
cells will continue to proliferate in monolayer culture indefinitely. This provides an<br>
opportunity to genetically manipulate the cells and isolate new clones of cells with new<br>
useful properties (Allen-Hoffinann et al., J. Invest. Dermatol., 114(3): 444-455 (2000)).<br>
The NIKS cells arose from the BC-l-Ep strain of human neonatal foreskin<br>
keratinocytes isolated from an apparently normal male infant. In early passages, the BC-<br>
l-Ep cells exhibited no morphological or growth characteristics that were atypical for<br>
cultured normal human keratinocytes. Cultivated BC-l-Ep cells exhibited stratification<br>
as well as features of programmed cell death. To determine replicative lifespan, the BC-<br>
l-Ep cells were serially cultivated to senescence in standard keratinocyte growth medium<br>
at a density of 3 x 105 cells per 100-mm dish and passaged at weekly intervals<br>
(approximately a 1:25 split). By passage 15, most keratinocytes in the population<br>
appeared senescent as judged by the presence of numerous abortive colonies which<br>
exhibited large, flat cells. However, at passage 16, keratinocytes exhibiting a small cell<br>
size were evident. By passage 17, only the small-sized keratinocytes were present in the<br>
culture and no large, senescent keratinocytes were evident. The resulting population of<br>
small keratinocytes that survived this putative crisis period appeared morphologically<br>
uniform and produced colonies of keratinocytes exhibiting typical keratinocyte<br>
characteristics including cell-cell adhesion and apparent squame production. The<br>
keratinocytes that survived senescence were serially cultivated at a density of 3 x 105<br>
cells per 100-mm dish. Typically the cultures reached a cell density of approximately 8 x<br>
106 cells within 7 days. This stable rate of cell growth was maintained through at least 59<br>
passages, demonstrating that the cells had achieved immortality. The keratinocytes that<br>
emerged from the original senescencing population were originally designated BC-1-<br><br>
Ep/Spontaneous Line and are now termed NIKS. The NIKS cell line has been screened<br>
for the presence of proviral DNA sequences for HIV-1, HIV-2, EBV, CMV, HTLV-1,<br>
HTLV-2, HBV, HCV, B-19 parvovirus, HPV-16 and HPV-31 using either PCR or<br>
Southern analysis. None of these viruses were detected.<br>
Chromosomal analysis was performed on the parental BC-1-Ep cells at passage 3<br>
and NIKS cells at passages 31 and 54. The parental BC-1-Ep cells have a normal<br>
chromosomal complement of 46, XY. At passage 31, all NIKS cells contained 47<br>
chromosomes with an extra isochromosome of the long arm of chromosome 8. No other<br>
gross chromosomal abnormalities or marker chromosomes were detected. At passage 54,<br>
all cells contained the isochromosome 8.<br>
The DNA fingerprints for the NIKS cell line and the BC-1-Ep keratinocytes are<br>
identical at all twelve loci analyzed demonstrating that the NIKS cells arose from the<br>
parental BC-1-Ep population. The odds of the NIKS cell line having the parental BC-1-<br>
Ep DNA fingerprint by random chance is 4 x 10-16. The DNA fingerprints from three<br>
different sources of human keratinocytes, ED-1-Ep, SCC4 and SCC13y are different<br>
from the BC-1-Ep pattern. This data also shows that keratinocytes isolated from other<br>
humans, ED-1-Ep, SCC4, and SCC13y, are unrelated to the BC-1-Ep cells or each other.<br>
The NIKS DNA fingerprint data provides an unequivocal way to identify the NIKS cell<br>
line.<br>
Loss of p53 function is associated with an enhanced proliferative potential and<br>
increased frequency of immortality in cultured cells. The sequence of p53 in the NIKS<br>
cells is identical to published p53 sequences (GenBank accession number: M14695). In<br>
humans, p53 exists in two predominant polymorphic forms distinguished by the amino<br>
acid at codon 72. Both alleles of p53 in the NIKS cells are wild-type and have the<br>
sequence CGC at codon 72, which codes for an arginine. The other common form of p53<br>
has a proline at this position. The entire sequence of p53 in the NIKS cells is identical to<br>
the BC-l-Ep progenitor cells. Rb was also found to be wild-type in NIKS cells.<br>
Anchorage-independent growth is highly correlated to tumorigenicity in vivo. For<br>
this reason, the anchorage-independent growth characteristics of NIKS cells in agar or<br>
methylcellulose-containing medium was investigated. After 4 weeks in either agar- or<br>
methylcellulose-containing medium, NIKS cells remained as single cells. The assays<br><br>
were continued for a total of 8 weeks to detect slow growing variants of the NIKS cells.<br>
None were observed<br>
To determine the tumorigenicity of the parental BC-1-Ep keratinocytes and the<br>
immortal NIKS keratinocyte cell line, cells were injected into the flanks of athymic nude<br>
mice. The human squamous cell carcinoma cell line, SCC4, was used as a positive<br>
control for tumor production in these animals. The injection of samples was designed<br>
such that animals received SCC4 cells in one flank and either the parental BC-l-Ep<br>
keratinocytes or the NIKS cells in the opposite flank. This injection strategy eliminated<br>
animal to animal variation in tumor production and confirmed that the mice would<br>
support vigorous growth of tumorigenic cells. Neither the parental BC-1-Ep<br>
keratinocytes (passage 6) nor the NIKS keratinocytes (passage 35) produced tumors in<br>
athymic nude mice.<br>
NIKS cells were analyzed for the ability to undergo differentiation in both surface<br>
culture and organotypic culture. For cells in surface culture, a marker of squamous<br>
differentiation, the formation cornified envelopes was monitored. In cultured human<br>
keratinocytes, early stages of cornified envelope assembly result in the formation of an<br>
immature structure composed of involucrin, cystatin-α and other proteins, which<br>
represent the innermost third of the mature comified envelope. Less than 2% of the<br>
keratinocytes from the adherent BC-1-Ep cells or the NIKS cell line produce cornified<br>
envelopes. This finding is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that actively<br>
growing, subconfluent keratinocytes produce less than 5% cornified envelopes. To<br>
determine whether the NIKS cell line is capable of producing cornified envelopes when<br>
induced to differentiate, the cells were removed from surface culture and suspended for<br>
24 hours in medium made semi-solid with methylcellulose. Many aspects of terminal<br>
differentiation, including differential expression of keratins and cornified envelope<br>
formation can be triggered in vitro by loss of keratinocyte cell-cell and cell-substratum<br>
adhesion. The NIKS keratinocytes produced as many as and usually more cornified<br>
envelopes than the parental keratinocytes. These findings demonstrate that the NIKS<br>
keratinocytes are not defective in their ability to initiate the; formation of this cell type-<br>
specific differentiation structure.<br>
To confirm that the NIKS keratinocytes can undergo squamous differentiation,<br><br>
the cells were cultivated in organotypic culture. Keratinocyte cultures grown on plastic<br>
substrata and submerged in medium replicate but exhibit limited differentiation.<br>
Specifically, human keratinocytes become confluent and undergo limited stratification<br>
producing a sheet consisting of 3 or more layers of keratinocytes. By light and electron<br>
microscopy there are striking differences between the architecture of the multilayered<br>
sheets formed in tissue culture and intact human skin. In contrast, organotypic culturing<br>
techniques allow for keratinocyte growth and differentiation under in vivo-like<br>
conditions. Specifically, the cells adhere to a physiological substratum consisting of<br>
dermal fibroblasts embedded within a fibrillar collagen base. The organotypic culture is<br>
maintained at the air-medium interface. In this way, cells in the upper sheets are air-<br>
exposed while the proliferating basal cells remain closest to the gradient of nutrients<br>
provided by diffusion through the collagen gel. Under these conditions, correct tissue<br>
architecture is formed. Several characteristics of a normal differentiating epidermis are<br>
evident. In both the parental cells and the NIKS cell line a single layer of cuboidal basal<br>
cells rests at the junction of the epidermis and the dermal equivalent. The rounded<br>
morphology and high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio is indicative of an actively dividing<br>
population of keratinocytes. In normal human epidermis, as the basal cells divide they<br>
give rise to daughter cells that migrate upwards into the differentiating layers of the<br>
tissue. The daughter cells increase in size and become flattened and squamous.<br>
Eventually these cells enucleate and form cornified, keratinized structures. This normal<br>
differentiation process is evident in the upper layers of both the parental cells and the<br>
NIKS cells. The appearance of flattened squamous cells is evident in the upper layers of<br>
keratinocytes and demonstrates that stratification has occurred in the organotypic<br>
cultures. In the uppermost part of the organotypic cultures the enucleated squames peel<br>
off the top of the culture. To date, no histological differences in differentiation at the<br>
light microscope level between the parental keratinocytes and the NIKS keratinocyte cell<br>
line grown in organotypic culture have been observed<br>
To observe more detailed characteristics of the parental (passage 5) and NIKS<br>
(passage 38) organotypic cultures and to confirm the histological observations, samples<br>
were analyzed using electron microscopy. Parental cells and the immortalized human<br>
keratinocyte cell line, NIKS, were harvested after 15 days in organotypic culture and<br><br>
sectioned perpendicular to the basal layer to show the extent of stratification. Both the<br>
parental cells and the NIKS cell line undergo extensive stratification in organotypic<br>
culture and form structures that are characteristic of normal human epidermis. Abundant<br>
desmosomes are formed in organotypic cultures of parental cells and the NIKS cell line.<br>
The formation of a basal lamina and associated hemidesmosomes in the basal<br>
keratinocyte layers of both the parental cells and the cell line was also noted.<br>
Hemidesmosomes are specialized structures that increase adhesion of the keratinocytes to<br>
the basal lamina and help maintain the integrity and strength of the tissue. The presence<br>
of these structures was especially evident in areas where the parental cells or the NIKS<br>
cells had attached directly to the porous support. These findings are consistent with<br>
earlier ultrastructural findings using human foreskin keratinocytes cultured on a<br>
fibroblast-containing porous support. Analysis at both the light and electron microscopic<br>
levels demonstrate that the NIKS cell line in organotypic culture can stratify,<br>
differentiate, and form structures such as desmosomes, basal lamina, and<br>
hemidesmosomes found in normal human epidermis,<br>
B. Culture Conditions for Creating Improved Barrier Function in Skin<br>
Substitutes<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, methods of culturing skin<br>
equivalents are provided that result in enhanced barrier function as compared to skin<br>
equivalents cultured by conventional methods. Full stratification and histological<br>
differentiation of normal keratinocytes can be achieved by the use of three-dimensional<br>
organotypic culture methods (Bell et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 76: 1274-1278<br>
(1979); Fusenig, Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions regulate keratinocyte growth and<br>
differentiation in vitro, in The Keratinocyte Handbook, I.M. Leigh, Lane, E.B., and F.M.<br>
Watt, Editor. 1994, University Press: Cambridge (1994); Parenteau et al.,<br>
Cytotechnology, 9: 163-171(1992)). Normal keratinocytes grown on the surface of<br>
collagen gels containing dermal fibroblasts can generate specialized structures, such as<br>
the basement membrane and hemidesmosomes, which are characteristic of the normal<br>
tissue architecture of stratified squamous epithelia. The organotypic culture technique for<br>
normal keratinocytes has fostered the recent development of in vitro models for<br><br>
cutaneous pharmacotoxicological studies. This has become: an important alternative to<br>
animal testing.<br>
When in vitro cultures of human keratinocytes are grown at an air-liquid<br>
interface, a highly ordered stratum corneum is formed. Although permeability to water<br>
decreases with increased culturing time at the air-liquid interface (Cumpstone et al., J.<br>
Invest. Dermatol., 92(4): 598-600 (1989)), permeability of in vitro skin equivalent<br>
cultures is much greater than that of intact human skin, i.e., the barrier function is<br>
defective in the culture systems Ponec, Int. J. Cosmetic Sci., 14: 245-264 (1992)). In an<br>
effort to improve the permeability barrier, a number of cukure variables have been<br>
examined and some have led to improved properties of the: cultures (Table 1). For<br>
example, growing the cultures at lowered relative humidity improves the barrier function<br>
of skin equivalent cultures (Mak et al., J. Invest. Dermatol., 96(3): 323-7 (1991)). It is<br>
believed that transepidermal water flux may serve as a regulatory signal for epidermal<br>
lipid synthesis and repair following disruption of the epidermal barrier (Grubauer et al.,<br>
J. Lipid Res., 30(3): 323-33 (1989)). Hairless mice have also been used to demonstrate<br>
improved barrier function, epidermal morphology (SC thickness, number of lamellar<br>
membrane structures, number of lamellar bodies) and lipid content in response to lowered<br>
humidity.<br>
A key biochemical difference between cultured skin substitutes and intact skin is<br>
the profile of extracellular lipids that are found in the outermost layer of normal skin.<br>
Cultures of differentiated keratinocytes are deficient in several ceramides that are major<br>
constituents of normal skin (Ponec et al., J. Invest. Dermatol., 109(3): 348-55 (1997)).<br>
Large quantities of these specialized extracellular lipids are secreted by differentiated<br>
keratinocytes and assembled into lipid bi-layers that are essential for normal epidermal<br>
barrier function. Comparison of the lipid composition between in vitro skin equivalent<br>
cultures and human skin revealed striking differences. Human skin contains seven forms<br>
of ceramides but the cultures produced primarily ceramides 1-3 and very little of<br>
ceramides 6 and 7. Re-establishing a more complete lipid profile has been the end-point<br>
of a number of studies. For example, addition of vitamin C to the media was found to be<br>
critical for a complete spectrum of ceramide lipids in skin equivalent cultures. Ceramides<br>
6 and 7 contain hydroxylated sphingoid base and/or fatty acid, and production of these is<br><br>
likely facilitated by the presence of vitamin C. In this study, the lipid profiles of the<br>
commercially available skin equivalent cultures EPIDERM, SKINETHIC and Living<br>
Skin Equivalent were all deficient in ceramides 5, 6 and 7. Addition of vitamin C<br>
improved the lipid profile and the overall SC architecture as determined by electron<br>
microscopy.<br><br>
Activators of nuclear hormone receptors have been tested for their effects on<br>
barrier function development. Addition of vitamin D has led to improvements in some<br>
studies (Mak et al., supra) but not in others (Hanley et al., supra). Activators of the<br>
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and the farnesoid X-activated receptor<br>
(FXAR) accelerate barrier maturation in fetal rat skin in vitro and in utero. Structural<br>
changes were consistent with the reduction in transepidermal water loss, including the<br>
appearance of a distinct SC, a thickened stratum granulosum, and increased density of<br>
lamellar structures.<br><br>
The aberrant lipid composition of skin equivalent cultures is also improved by<br>
grafting onto immunodeficient mice (Vicanova et al., J. Investig. Dennatol. Symp. Proc,<br>
3(2): 114-20 (1998)). Cultured human keratinocytes retain the ability of generating a<br>
differentiated epidermis when grafted onto athymic mice. When cultured skin substitutes<br>
were examined between six months and two years after grafting, significant<br>
improvements in SC lipid composition and ultrastructure were observed. The high levels<br>
of triglycerides and low levels of cholesterol esters and free fatty acids observed in the in<br>
vitro cultures were normalized by six months after grafting. Ceramides 6 and 7,<br>
undetectable in the in vitro cultures, were expressed by the human cells after six months<br>
of grafting. These studies highlight the fact that current in vitro culture conditions are<br>
defective in their ability to produce skin equivalents with normal barrier function.<br>
Improved culture conditions that more closely mimic normal developmental signals<br>
should enhance barrier function development.<br>
The development of barrier function in vivo is temporally regulated. In the rat, for<br>
example, at gestational day 19 fetal rat pups have no barrier, but by day 21a competent<br>
barrier has formed (Aszterbaum et al., Pediatr. Res., 31(4 Pt 1): 308-17 (1992)).<br>
Development of a competent epidermal barrier occurs between embryonic day 15 and 16<br>
of mouse gestation (Hardman et al., Development, 125: 1541-1552(1998)). The<br>
functional barrier arises coincident with a multilayered SC and mature lamellar<br>
membranes in the SC. Expression of the comeocyte structural protein loricrin, filaggrin<br>
and involucrin increase during this period. Expression of enzymes involved in lipid<br>
processing, beta-glucocerebrosidase and steroid sulfatase, also increase. The process is<br>
also susceptible to manipulation by environmental and hormonal factors. PPAR and<br>
FXAR activators given for two days in utero accelerated the development of barrier<br>
function on day 19 pups as measured by reduction in transepidermal water loss. The<br>
treatments also improved SC morphology and gene expression of key structural proteins<br>
and enzymatic functions.<br>
Accordingly, in some embodiments of the present invention, the following<br>
treatments, alone or in combination, are used to provide increased barrier function in<br>
organotypically cultured skin equivalents. In some embodiments, the organotypic<br>
cultures are supplemented with from about 1 micrograms/ml to about 200 micrograms/ml<br><br>
ascorbic acid, preferably about 50 micrograms/ml ascorbic acid. In other embodiments,<br>
the organotypic cultures are supplemented with about 1 to 200 μM linoleic acid,<br>
preferably about 30 μM linoleic acid. In still further embodiments, the organotypic<br>
cultures are supplemented with about 1 to 200 μM farnesol, preferably about 50 μM<br>
farnesol. In still other embodiments, the organotypic cultures are performed at from<br>
about 50 to 95% humidity, preferably about 75% humidity. Barrier function is<br>
conveniently evaluated in the skin equivalents by measuring surface electrical<br>
capacitance (SEC). In preferred embodiments, skin equivalents with improved barrier<br>
function as compared to control skin equivalents have a SEC value of less than about 5<br>
times of the SEC observed in normal human skin (e.g., about 150-250 pF). In<br>
 particularly preferred embodiments, skin equivalents with improved barrier function as<br>
compared to control skin equivalents have an SEC of less than about 2-3 times of the<br>
SEC observed in normal human skin (e.g., about 80-120 pF). In other embodiments, the<br>
skin equivalents with improved barrier function are characterized by ceramide content.<br>
Accordingly, in some embodiments, the content of ceramides 5-7 is between about 20-<br>
50% of the total ceramide mass, preferably about 30-45% of the total ceramide mass. In<br>
other embodiments, the content of ceramide 2 is between about 10 to 40% of the total<br>
ceramide mass, preferably about 20 to 30% of total ceramide content.<br>
The present invention further provides additional methods and compositions for<br>
producing skin equivalents with improved characteristics, including improved barrier<br>
function. The improved methods and compositions are described in the following<br>
sections: 1) Culture Techniques and 2) Culture Media.<br>
1. Culture Techniques<br>
The present invention provides improved organotypic culture techniques for<br>
producing skin equivalents with superior properties. In some embodiments, a dermal<br>
equivalent is prepared. In preferred embodiments, the dermal equivalent comprises<br>
collagen and human fibroblasts. The present invention is not limited to the use of any<br>
particular type of collagen. Indeed, the use of a variety of types of collagen is<br>
contemplated, including, but not limited to rat tail tendon collagen (Type I). Likewise,<br>
the present invention is not limited to any particular type of fibroblasts. Indeed, the use<br><br>
of a variety of different types of fibroblasts is contemplated including, but not limited to,<br>
NHDF (Normal Human Dermal Fibroblasts) cells and cells harvested from a donor or<br>
patient.<br>
The present invention also is not limited to the use of any particular concentration or<br>
amount of collagen. In preferred embodiments, the dermal equivalents are prepared with<br>
about 0.2 mg collagen per square centimeter of said dermal equivalent to 2.0 mg collagen<br>
per square centimeter of said dermal equivalent. In more preferred embodiments, the<br>
dermal equivalent contains about 0.22 mg collagen per square centimeter of said dermal<br>
equivalent to 1.0 mg collagen per square centimeter of said dermal equivalent. In most<br>
preferred embodiments, the dermal equivalent contains about 0.5 mg collagen per square<br>
centimeter of said dermal equivalent.<br>
In contrast to most previously described methods for organotypic skin culture, a<br>
mixture of collagen and fibroblasts is applied directly to whatever culture device is being<br>
used. The applicants have discovered that the presence of an acelluar first layer is not<br>
necessary to obtain good contraction and adherence to the culture device. In some<br>
embodiments, the fibroblasts are included in a final concentration of from about 10,000<br>
cells/ml to about 100,000 cells/ml, preferably about 50,000 cells/ml.<br>
A variety of culture devices find use in the present invention. Preferred culture<br>
devices (see Figure 4) are growth chambers comprised of a side-wall and a bottom<br>
surface. In some preferred embodiments, the growth chamber is generally cup-shaped.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the bottom surface is permeable to the culture medium. A<br>
non-limiting example of a suitable permeable surface material is porous polycarbonate.<br>
The present invention is compatible with commercially available culture devices<br>
including MILLICELL (MILLIPORE) and TRANSWELL (CORNING) culture inserts.<br>
The MILLICELL inserts are especially useful for the preparation of skin equivalents used<br>
for testing purposes (e.g., skin equivalents of about 1 cm in diameter). The inventors<br>
have discovered that a plurality of MILLICELL-size inserts may be incubated in a largeT<br>
petri dish (i.e., a 100 mm culture dish). The TRANSWELL inserts are useful for the<br>
production of larger skin equivalents (e.g., about 10 cm in diameter). These larger skin<br>
equivalents can be used as grafts, for larger scale testing, or dissected into smaller testing<br>
formats.<br><br>
In preferred embodiments, the freshly poured dermal equivalents are submerged<br>
in culture media and cultured until contraction of the dermal equivalent occurs. This<br>
creates a dermal equivalent with a generally concave appearance. In previously<br>
described methods, after contraction of the dermal layer, the dermal layer is seeded with<br>
keratinocytes and then resubmerged. The organotypic culture is then lifted to the air<br>
interface of the culture medium after about 4-7 days. In contrast to these previously<br>
described methods, the present inventors have found that is preferable to lift the dermal<br>
equivalent to the air interface prior to seeding with keratinocytes. The culture is then<br>
preferably maintained at the air interface as stratification occurs. Accordingly, in some<br>
embodiments, the dermal equivalent is preferably lifted to the air interface and<br>
maintained for greater than about 6 hours prior to seeding. In more preferred<br>
embodiments, the dermal equivalent is preferably lifted to the air interface and<br>
maintained for greater than about twelve hours prior to seeding. In most preferred<br>
embodiments, the dermal equivalent is preferably lifted to the air interface and<br>
maintained for greater than about twenty-four hours prior to seeding. In some<br>
embodiments, the dermal equivalent is maintained for more than 24 hours at the air<br>
interface to provide a pre-made dermal equivalent for later use.<br>
The culture techniques of the present invention provide skin equivalents with<br>
superior properties. In preferred embodiments, the skin equivalents have improved<br>
barrier function as compared to previously described skin equivalents. In still further<br>
preferred embodiments, the present invention provides dermal equivalents for use in<br>
producing skin equivalents with superior properties. In some embodiments, the dermal,<br>
equivalents are characterized by containing increased concentrations of collagen as<br>
described above.<br>
In still further preferred embodiments, the present invention provides<br>
compositions for use in producing skin equivalents. In some embodiments, the<br>
compositions comprise a growth chamber having a bottom surface and a side-wall. In<br>
further embodiments, the growth chamber includes a dermal equivalent adjacent to the<br>
bottom surface. In still further embodiments, the dermal equivalent is substantially<br>
adhered to the side-wall.<br><br>
The inventors have also discovered that the seeding density of the keratinocytes<br>
on the dermal equivalents can affect the quality of the resulting skin equivalent.<br>
Accordingly, in some embodiments of the present invention, the seeding density is<br>
increased by approximately an order of magnitude over previously described methods. In<br>
some embodiments, the seeding density of keratinocytes ranges from about 1 x 105 to 1 x<br>
106 cells/cm2 of dermal equivalent. In still further preferred embodiments, the seeding<br>
density of keratinocytes is about 4.65 x 105 cells/cm2 of dermal equivalent.<br>
Barrier function is conveniently evaluated in the skin equivalents by measuring<br>
surface electrical capacitance (SEC). In preferred embodiments, skin equivalents with<br>
improved barrier function as compared to control skin equivalents have a SEC value of<br>
less than about 5 times of the SEC observed in normal human skin (e.g., about 150-250<br>
pF). In particularly preferred embodiments, skin equivalents with improved barrier<br>
function as compared to control skin equivalents have an SEC of less than about 2-3<br>
times of the SEC observed in normal human skin (e.g., about 80-120 pF). In other<br>
embodiments, the skin equivalents with improved barrier function are characterized by<br>
ceramide content. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the content of ceramides 5-7 is<br>
between about 20-50% of the total ceramide mass, preferably about 30-45% of the total<br>
ceramide mass. In other embodiments, the content of ceramide 2 is between about 10 to<br>
40% of the total ceramide mass, preferably about 20 to 30% of total ceramide content.<br>
2. Culture Media<br>
The present invention provides improved organotypic culture media for producing<br>
skin equivalents with superior properties. In some embodiments, the culture media of the<br>
present invention are Ham's F12 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium<br>
(DMEM). In some embodiments, the Ham's F12 and DMEM are supplemented with at<br>
least one of the following supplements: bovine serum albumin, isoproterenol, carnitine,<br>
serine, oleic acid, linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, a-tocopherol, ascorbic acid, and<br>
epidermal growth factor (EGF). In other embodiments, at least one of bovine serum<br>
albumin, isoproterenol, carnitine, serine, oleic acid, linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, α-<br>
tocopherol, ascorbic acid, and EGF is (are) provided in concentrations) sufficient to<br>
improve barrier function in in vitro cultured skin equivalents. In still other embodiments,<br><br>
the medium comprises a serum supplement, preferably Fetal Clone II. In some<br>
embodiments, the medium further comprises at least one of the following supplements:<br>
hydrocortisone, cholera toxin, insulin, adenine, and CaCl2. In preferred embodiments,<br>
the bovine serum albumin is provided at a concentration of about 0.1mg/mlto 20 mg/ml,<br>
preferably about 1 mg/ml, the isoproterenol is provided at a concentration of about 0.1 -<br>
10.0 μM, the carnitine is provided at a concentration of about 1.0 - 100.0 μM, the serine<br>
is provided at a concentration of about 1.0 - 100.0 μM, the oleic acid is provided at a<br>
concentration of about 1.0 - 100.0 μM, the linoleic acid is provided at a concentration of<br>
about 1.0 - 100.0 μM, the arachidonic acid is provided at a concentration of about 1.0 -<br>
100.0 μM, the a-tocopherol is provided at a concentration of about 0.1 - 10.0 μM, the<br>
ascorbic acid is provided at a concentration of about 0.005 - 5.0 mg/ml, and the<br>
epidermal growth factor is provided at a concentration of about 0.1 - 10.0 ng/ml.<br>
C. Genetic Modification of Cells for Improved Barrier Function<br>
The present invention also contemplates that barrier function can be improved by<br>
expressing heterologous GKLF in the cells described in Section A. Expression of<br>
heterologous GKLF may also be combined with the improved culture conditions<br>
described in Section B. The final stages of epidermal differentiation are preceded by<br>
increased expression of numerous genes that encode the enzymes required for the<br>
biochemical modifications that result in the stratum corneum. In addition, culture<br>
conditions that stimulate keratinocyte differentiation or experimental disruption of the<br>
skin barrier function result in increased expression of enzymes involved in extracellular<br>
lipid synthesis and metabolism. These gene expression changes indicate that one or more<br>
regulatory transcription factors are responsible for altering the gene expression profile of<br>
differentiating keratinocytes to facilitate development of the epidermal barrier. The<br>
precise timing of skin barrier function in development suggests a precise temporal control<br>
by a developmental switch. Complex developmental programs can be initiated by the<br>
action of one or a small number of key regulatory transcription factors, sometimes called<br>
master regulators or selector genes. A recent study on a knock-out mutation in the<br>
transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) may have identified one of the key<br>
regulators of barrier function in the skin (Segre et al., Nat. Genet., 22(4): 356-60 (1999)).<br><br>
Klf4 mutant mice are born in normal numbers but die shortly (
apparently from hypo-volemic shock as a result of excessive evaporative fluid loss.<br>
Further analysis demonstrated that, while normal mice develop an intact epidermal<br>
barrier function by day 17.5 of gestation, Klf4 mutant mice fail to develop this barrier<br>
function and have an epidermis that exhibits excessive trans-epidermal water loss. Klf4<br>
is expressed in the differentiating layers of the epidermis, the upper spinous and granular<br>
layers. In contrast to the defects caused in other mutant mouse lines, the absence of Klf4<br>
does not result in gross alterations of the epidermal ultrastructure or in lipid profiles.<br>
This led to the hypothesis that its primary role is in the acquisition of barrier function.<br>
Consistent with this, defects were observed in the stratum granulosum in the keratohyalin<br>
granules and flattening of SC cells. By EM, the intercellular lamellae were discontinuous<br>
in the mutant skin. The defect in Klf-4 mutant skin was not rescued by grafting it onto<br>
foster mice. Klf4 is a member of a family of transcription factors; other members are<br>
implicated in tissue-specific differentiation events in erythroid cells and T-cells. Analysis<br>
of gene expression differences between wild-type and Kif4 mutant mice led to the<br>
identification of three genes that were up-regulated in the mutant skin, suggesting that<br>
Klf4 may repress the expression of these genes normally. The observation that loss of<br>
Klf4 has no other observable effects on mouse development suggests that Klf4 functions<br>
primarily to regulate the development of the epidermal permeability barrier. The role of<br>
Klf4 in the acquisition of epidermal barrier function raises the possibility that expression<br>
of Klf4 in cultured skin substitutes might improve the barrier properties of these synthetic<br>
skin cultures.<br>
Accordingly, in some embodiments, primary keratinocytes or immortalized<br>
keratinocytes are transfected with a vector encoding a functional GKLF homolog. It is<br>
contemplated that when these keratinocytes are organotypically cultured, the resulting<br>
skin equivalent will exhibit improved barrier function as compared to organotypic<br>
cultures formed from nontransfected, control keratinocytes. In preferred embodiments,<br>
skin equivalents with improved barrier function as compared to control skin equivalents<br>
have a SEC value of less than about 5 times of the SEC observed in normal human skin<br>
(e.g., about 150-250 pF). In particularly preferred embodiments, skin equivalents with<br>
improved barrier function as compared to control skin equivalents have an SEC of less<br><br>
than about 2-3 times of the SEC observed in normal human skin (e.g., about 80-120 pF).<br>
In other embodiments, the skin equivalents with improved barrier function are<br>
characterized by ceramide content. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the content of<br>
ceramides 5-7 is between about 20-50% of the total ceramide mass, preferably about 30-<br>
45% of the total ceramide mass. In other embodiments, the content of ceramide 2 is<br>
between about 10 to 40% of the total ceramide mass, preferably about 20 to 30% of total,<br>
ceramide content.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the use of any particular homolog or<br>
variant of GKLF. Indeed, a variety of GKLF variants may be used so long as they retain<br>
at least some of the activity of wild-type GKLF. In particular, it contemplated that both<br>
mouse (SEQ ID NO:1) and human (SEQ ID NO:2) GKLF find use in the present<br>
invention. Additionally, it is contemplated that GKLF variants encoded by sequences<br>
that hybridize to SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2 under conditions of from low to high stringency<br>
will find use in the present invention. Functional variants can be screened for by<br>
expressing the variant in an appropriate vector (described in more detail below) in<br>
keratinocytes, using the heratinocytes to produce a skin equivalent, and analyzing the<br>
skin equivalent for increased barrier function. Alternatively, functional variants can be<br>
identified by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay as described in (Zhang et al., J. Biol.<br>
Chem., 273(28): 17917-25 (1998).<br>
In some embodiments, variants result from mutation, (i.e., a change in the nucleic<br>
acid sequence) and generally produce altered mRNAs or polypeptides whose structure or<br>
function may or may not be altered. Any given gene may have none, one, or many<br>
variant forms. Common mutational changes that give rise to variants are generally<br>
ascribed to deletions, additions or substitutions of nucleic acids. Each of these types of<br>
changes may occur alone, or in combination with the others, and at the rate of one or<br>
more times in a given sequence.<br>
It is contemplated that it is possible to modify the structure of a peptide having a<br>
function (e.g., GKLF function) for such purposes as increasing binding affinity of GKLF<br>
for its nucleic acid ligand. Such modified peptides are considered functional equivalents<br>
of peptides having an activity of GKLF as defined herein. A modified peptide can be<br>
produced in which the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide has been altered,<br><br>
such as by substitution, deletion, or addition. In particularly preferred embodiments,<br>
these modifications do not significantly reduce the activity of the modified GKLF. In<br>
other words, construct "X" can be evaluated in order to determine whether it is a member<br>
of the genus of modified or variant GKLF's of the present invention as defined<br>
functionally, rather than structurally. In preferred embodiments, the activity of variant or<br>
mutant GKLF is evaluated by the methods described above.<br>
Moreover, as described above, variant forms of GKLF are also contemplated as<br>
being equivalent to those peptides and DNA molecules that are set forth in more detail<br>
herein. For example, it is contemplated that isolated replacement of a leucine with an<br>
isoleucine or valine, an aspartate with a glutamate, a threonine with a serine, or a similar<br>
replacement of an amino acid with a structurally related amino acid (i.e., conservative<br>
mutations) will not have a major effect on the biological activity of the resulting<br>
molecule. Accordingly, some embodiments of the present invention provide variants of<br>
GKLF disclosed herein containing conservative replacements. Conservative<br>
replacements are those that take place within a family of amino acids that are related in<br>
their side chains. Genetically encoded amino acids can be divided into four families: (1)<br>
acidic (aspartate, glutamate); (2) basic (lysine, arginine, histidine); (3) nonpolar (alanine,<br>
valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan); and (4)<br>
uncharged polar (glycine, asparagine, glutamine, cysteine, serine, threonine, tyrosine).<br>
Phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine are sometimes classified jointly as aromatic<br>
amino acids. In similar fashion, the amino acid repertoire can be grouped as (1) acidic<br>
(aspartate, glutamate); (2) basic (lysine, arginine, histidine), (3) aliphatic (glycine,<br>
alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, serine, threonine), with serine and threonine<br>
optionally be grouped separately as aliphatic-hydroxyl; (4) aromatic (phenylalanine,<br>
tyrosine, tryptophan); (5) amide (asparagine, glutamine); and (6) sulfur-containing<br>
(cysteine and methionine) (e.g., Stryer ed., Biochemistry, pg. 17-21, 2nd ed, WH<br>
Freeman and Co., 1981). Whether a change in the amino acid sequence of apeptide<br>
results in a functional homolog can be readily determined by assessing the ability of the<br>
variant peptide to function in a fashion similar to the wild-type protein. Peptides having<br>
more than one replacement can readily be tested in the same manner.<br><br>
More rarely, a variant includes "nonconservative" changes (e.g., replacement of a<br>
glycine with a tryptophan). Analogous minor variations can also include amino acid<br>
deletions or insertions, or both. Guidance in determining which amino acid residues can<br>
be substituted, inserted, or deleted without abolishing biological activity can be found<br>
using computer programs (e.g., LASERGENE software, DNASTAR Inc., Madison,<br>
Wis.).<br>
The heterolgous GKLF is expressed in keratinocytes by using a suitable vector<br>
and regulatory sequences. In some preferred embodiments, either a involucrin or<br>
transglutaminase 3 promoters are utilized. In other preferred embodiments, the<br>
expression of GKLF will be driven by the inducible promoter system of the pTetOn<br>
plasmid (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). It is contemplated that a number of other mammalian<br>
expression vectors are suitable for use in the present invention, including, but not limited<br>
to, pWLNEO, pSV2CAT, pOG44, PXT1, pSG (Stratagene) pSVK3, pBPV, pMSG,<br>
pSVL (Pharmacia). Any other plasmid or vector may be used as long as they are<br>
replicable and viable in the host. In some preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, mammalian expression vectors comprise an origin of replication, a suitable<br>
promoter and enhancer, and also any necessary ribosome binding sites, polyadenylation<br>
sites, splice donor and acceptor sites, transcriptional termination sequences, and 5'<br>
flanking non-transcribed sequences. In other embodiments, DNA sequences derived<br>
from the SV40 splice, and polyadenylation sites may be used to provide the required<br>
non-transcribed genetic elements. Additionally, the Klf 4 gene may be inserted via a<br>
retroviral vector. In particularly preferred embodiments, the retroviral vector is<br>
pseudotyped retroviral vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Transfection can be<br>
accomplished by any method known in the art, including but not limited to calcium-<br>
phosphate coprecipitation, electroporation, microparticle bombardment, liposome<br>
mediated transfection, or retroviral infection.<br>
D. Uses of Skin Substitutes having Improved Barrier Function<br>
It is contemplated that the skin substitutes of the present invention have a variety<br>
of uses. These uses include, but are not limited to, use for screening compounds (e.g.,<br>
irritants), substrates for culturing tumors and pathological agents (e.g., human papilloma<br><br>
virus), and use for wound closure and burn treatment. Theses uses are described in more<br>
detail below.<br>
1. Use for Screening Compounds<br>
The skin equivalents of the present invention may be; used for a variety of in vitro<br>
tests. In particular, the skin equivalents find use in the evaluation of: skin care products,<br>
drug metabolism, cellular responses to test compounds, wound healing, phototoxicity,<br>
dermal irritation, dermal inflammation, skin corrosivity, and cell damage. The skin<br>
equivalents are provided in a variety of formats for testing, including but not limited to,<br>
6-well, 24-well, and 96-well plates. Additionally, the skin equivalents can be divided by<br>
standard dissection techniques and then tested. The skin equivalents of the present<br>
invention have both an epidermal layer with a differentiated stratum comeum and dermal<br>
layer that includes dermal fibroblasts. As described above, in particularly preferred<br>
embodiments, the epidermal layer is derived from immortalized NIKS cells. Other<br>
preferred cell lines, including NIKS cells, are characterized by i) being immortalized; ii)<br>
being nontumorigenic; iii) forming cornified envelopes when induced to differentiate; iv)<br>
undergoing normal squamous differentiation in organotypic culture; and v) maintaining<br>
cell type-specific growth requirements in submerged culture, wherein said cell type-<br>
specific growth requirements include 1) exhibition of morphological characteristics of<br>
normal human keratinocytes when cultured in standard keratinocyte growth medium in<br>
the presence of mitomycin C-treated 3T3 feeder cells; 2) dependence on epidermal<br>
growth factor for serial cultivation; and 3) inhibition of growth by transforming growth<br>
factor β1.<br>
The present invention encompasses a variety of screening assays. In some<br>
embodiments, the screening method comprises providing a skin equivalent of the present<br>
invention and at least one test compound or product (e.g., a skin care product such as a<br>
moisturizer, cosmetic, dye, or fragrance; the products can be in any from, including, but<br>
not limited to, creams, lotions, liquids and sprays), applying the product or test compound<br>
to skin equivalent, and assaying the effect of the product or test compound on the skin<br>
equivalent. A wide variety of assays are used to determine the effect of the product or<br>
test compound on the skin equivalent. These assays include, but are not limited to, MIT<br><br>
cytotoxicity assays (Gay, The Living Skin Equivalent as an In Vitro Model for Ranking<br>
the Toxic Potential of Dermal Irritants, Toxic. In Vitro (1992)) and ELISA to assay the<br>
release of inflammatory modulators (e.g., prostaglandin E2, prostacyclin, and interleukm-<br>
1-alpha) and chemoattractants. The assays can be further directed to the toxicity,<br>
potency, or efficacy of the compound or product. Additionally, the effect of the<br>
compound or product on growth, barrier function, or tissue strength can be tested.<br>
In particular, the present invention contemplates the use of the skin equivalents<br>
for high throughput screening of compounds from combinatorial libraries (e.g., libraries<br>
containing greater than 104 compounds). In some embodiments, the cells are used in<br>
second messenger assays that monitor signal transduction following activation of cell-<br>
surface receptors. In other embodiments, the cells can be used in reporter gene assays<br>
that monitor cellular responses at the transcription/translation level. In still further<br>
embodiments, the cells can be used in cell proliferation assays to monitor the overall<br>
growth/no growth response of cells to external stimuli.<br>
In second messenger assays, the skin equivalents are treated with a compound or<br>
plurality of compounds (e.g., from a combinatorial library) and assayed for the presence<br>
or absence of a second messenger response. In some preferred embodiments, the cells<br>
(e.g., NIKS cells) used to create the skin equivalents are transfected with an expression<br>
vector encoding a recombinant cell surface receptor, ion-channel, voltage gated channel<br>
or some other protein of interest involved in a signaling cascade. It is contemplated that<br>
at least some of the compounds in the combinatorial library can serve as agonists,<br>
antagonists, activators, or inhibitors of the protein or proteins encoded by the vectors. It<br>
is also contemplated that at least some of the compounds in the combinatorial library can<br>
serve as agonists, antagonists, activators, or inhibitors of protein acting upstream or<br>
downstream of the protein encoded by the vector in a signal transduction pathway.<br>
In some embodiments, the second messenger assays measure fluorescent signals<br>
from reporter molecules that respond to intracellular changes (e.g., Ca2+ concentration,<br>
membrane potential, pH, IP3, cAMP, arachidonic acid release) due to stimulation of<br>
membrane receptors and ion channels (e.g., ligand gated ion channels) (Denyer et<br>
al., Drug Discov. Today 3:323-32 (1998); Gonzales et al., Drug. Discov. Today<br>
4:431-39 (1999)). Examples of reporter molecules include, but are not limited to,<br><br>
florescence resonance energy transfer systems (e.g., Cuo-lipids and oxonols,<br>
EDAN/DABCYL), calcium sensitive indicators (e.g., Fluo-3, FURA 2, INDO 1, and<br>
FLUO3/AM, BAPTA AM), chloride-sensitive indicators (e.g., SPQ, SPA), potassium-<br>
sensitive indicators (e.g., PBFI), sodium-sensitive indicators (e.g., SBFI), and pH<br>
sensitive indicators (e.g., BCECF).<br>
In general, the cells comprising the skin equivalents are loaded with the indicator<br>
prior to exposure to the compound. Responses of the host cells to treatment with the<br>
compounds can be detected by methods known in the art, including, but not limited to,<br>
fluorescence microscopy, confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, microfluidic devices,<br>
FLIPR systems (Schroeder and Neagle, J. Biomol. Screening 1:75-80 (1996)), and plate-<br>
reading systems. In some preferred embodiments, the response (e.g., increase in<br>
fluorescent intensity) caused by compound of unknown activity is compared to the<br>
response generated by a known agonist and expressed as a percentage of the maximal<br>
response of the known agonist. The maximum response caused by a known agonist is<br>
defined as a 100% response. Likewise, the maximal response recorded after addition of<br>
an agonist to a sample containing a known or test antagonist is detectably lower than the<br>
100% response.<br>
The skin equivalents of the present invention are also useful in reporter gene<br>
assays. Reporter gene assays involve the use of host cells transfected with vectors<br>
encoding a nucleic acid comprising transcriptional control elements of a target gene (i.e.,<br>
a gene that controls the biological expression and function of a disease target or<br>
inflammatory response) spliced to a coding sequence for a reporter gene. Therefore,<br>
activation of the target gene results in activation of the reporter gene product. This serves<br>
as indicator of response such an inflammatory response. Therefore, in some<br>
embodiments, the reporter gene construct comprises the 5' regulatory region (e.g.,<br>
promoters and/or enhancers) of a gene that is induced due to skin inflammation or<br>
irritation or protein that is involved in the synthesis of compounds produced in response<br>
to inflammation or irritation (e.g., prostaglandin or prostacyclin) operably linked to a<br>
reporter gene. Examples of reporter genes finding use in the present invention include,<br>
but are not limited to, chloramphenicol transferase, alkaline phosphatase, firefly and<br>
bacterial luciferases, β-galactosidase, β-lactamase, and green fluorescent protein. The<br><br>
production of these proteins, with the exception of green, reel, yellow, or blue fluorescent<br>
protein, is detected through the use of chemiluminescent, cotorimetric, or bioluminecent<br>
products of specific substrates (e.g., X-gal and luciferin). Comparisons between<br>
compounds of known and unknown activities may be conducted as described above.<br>
In other preferred embodiments, the skin equivalents find use for screening the<br>
efficacy of drug introduction across the skin or the affect of drugs directed to the skin. In<br>
these embodiments, the skin equivalents are treated with the drug delivery system or<br>
drug, and the permeation, penetration, or retention or the drug into the skin equivalent is<br>
assayed. Methods for assaying drug permeation are provided in Asbill et al., Pharm Res.<br>
17(9): 1092-97 (2000). In some embodiments, the skin equivalents are mounted on top<br>
of modified Franz diffusion cells. The skin equivalents are allowed to hydrate for one<br>
hour and then pretreated for one hour with propylene glycol. A saturated suspension of<br>
the model drug in propylene glycol is then added to the skin equivalent. The skin<br>
equivalent can then be sampled at predetermined intervals. The skin equivalents are then<br>
analyzed by HPLC to determine the concentration of the drag in the sample. Log P<br>
values for the drugs can be determined using the ACD program (Advanced Chemistry<br>
Inc., Ontario, Canada). These methods may be adapted to study the delivery of drugs via<br>
transdermal patches or other delivery modes.<br>
In still further preferred embodiments, the seeded dermal equivalents, which have<br>
not yet undergone differentiation, find use in assays for compounds that inhibit,<br>
accelerate, or otherwise effect differentiation of the seeded keratinocytes.<br>
2. Skin Irritancy Testing<br>
In some embodiments, the skin equivalents of the present invention are utilized in<br>
reporter gene assays for the testing of compounds for their skin irritant activity. In other<br>
embodiments, the present invention provides methods of utilizing the skin equivalent for<br>
identifying novel genes that are responsive to known skin irritants. The novel genes<br>
identified using the methods of the present invention further find use in the generation of<br>
additional reporter gene constructs for screening potential akin irritants.<br>
Initial screening experiments have been carried out to confirm that stable<br>
transfectants of NIKS keratinocytes expressing a transgene (GFP) exhibit normal<br><br>
stratification in organotypic culture. NIKS cells have been stably transfected with the<br>
Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) and a clonal population has been<br>
isolated. The ability of these stably transfected GFP-positive NIKS cells (NIKSGFP) to<br>
recreate normal tissue architecture in organotypic cultures was tested. Samples were<br>
frozen, cryostat sectioned, and analyzed by fluorescent microscopy. Cultures were first<br>
examined for expression and localization of GFP. In addition, sections were stained with<br>
Hoechst, a nuclear dye, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) to orient and visualize the<br>
cellular layers of the cultures. Sections of organotypic cultures were visualized using an<br>
IX-70 inverted fluorescent microscope (Olympus) equipped with GFP and Hoechst filters<br>
(Magnification, 400X). Sections of NIKSGFP cultures showed that GFP was present<br>
throughout all layers of the organotypic culture with the most intense fluorescence<br>
observed in the comified layer.<br>
The histology of the organotypic NIKSGFP cultures was next compared with those<br>
of untransfected NIKS cells and parental BC-1-Ep keratinocytes. H&amp;E-stained sections<br>
of NIKSGFP rafts showed a well organized, defined basal layer and excellent stratification<br>
with no abnormalities relative to untransfected controls and the parental BC-1-Ep<br>
keratinocytes. All three cultures show comparable cell stratification with no noticeable<br>
histological differences at the light microscope level.<br>
To further examine the ability of NIKSGFP cells to differentiate normally, the<br>
expression of several keratinocyte-specific differentiation markers was analyzed by<br>
immunofluoresence microscopy. As keratinocytes move to a suprabasal position within<br>
the tissue, they synthesize differentiation-specific proteins. Keratinocytes cease<br>
production of the basal keratins K5 and K14 and begin expressing the differentiation<br>
specific Kl and K10 keratins, which are expressed throughout the rest of the layers in the<br>
epidermis. Sections of the organotypic cultures were examined for expression and<br>
localization of K10 using indirect immunofluorescence. Keratin 10 was expressed<br>
normally in the suprabasal layers in BC-1-Ep, NIKS, and N1KSGFP organotypic cultures.<br>
To further characterize the differentiation pattern of the NIKSGFP cells, the expression and<br>
localization of filaggrin, which is a late-stage differentiation marker, was examined.<br>
Keratinocyte differentiation into the stratum granulosum is distinguished by the presence<br>
of distinct keratohyalin granules. These granules are composed of filaggrin and other<br><br>
proteins that are precursors for the production of the cornified envelope. Filaggrin<br>
staining in sections of all organotypic cultures displayed a punctate pattern characteristic<br>
of cells in the granular layer.<br>
In addition, the expression and localization of the adherens junctional<br>
components, E- and P-cadherin, was analyzed. In normal epidermis two members of the<br>
classical cadherin family, E-and P-cadherin are expressed, both of which play an<br>
important role in differentiation and cell adhesion in the epidermis. P-cadherin<br>
expression is limited to the basal layer and E-cadherin is located throughout the<br>
epidermis. The E-cadherin staining pattern is normal and localized to the cell-cell<br>
borders in sections of all three cultures. These data demonstrate that genetically-<br>
modified NIKS cells exhibit normal differentiation. Thus, it is contemplated that NIKS<br>
cells containing reporter gene constructs will form cultured skin equivalents similar to<br>
those formed with primary keratinocytes.<br>
Experiments were also performed to confirm that in response to known irritants,<br>
NIKS cells secrete a cytokine known to be secreted in response to skin irritants. Example<br>
3 demonstrated that NIKS cells secrete IL-1α in response to a known skin irritant.<br>
i) Reporter Gene Assays<br>
In some embodiments, the present invention provides skin equivalent (e.g., NIKS)<br>
cells comprising a reporter gene construct responsive to skin irritants. Suitable reporter<br>
gene constructs include, but are not limited to, those described above. In some<br>
embodiments, the cells further have improved barrier function.<br>
Previous studies indicated that IL-8 expression correlates well with skin irritation<br>
(de Brugerolle de Fraissinette et al., Cell Biology and Toxicology, 15:121 [1999]).<br>
Published sequences from the IL-8 gene include 1,482 bp of DNA upstream from the<br>
transcription start site and 102 bp of transcribed, untranslated DNA upstream from the<br>
EL-8 coding region (Mukaida et al., J. Immunology, 143:1366 [1989]). Chang and<br>
collaborators have found that a reporter gene containing IL-8 promoter sequences<br>
between -1472 and +19 is induced by trans-retinoic acid in tracheobronchial epithelial<br><br>
cells (Chang et al., Am J. Respir Cell Mol Biol. 22:502 [2000]). Abe et al. have shown<br>
that IL-8 promoter fragments containing as little as 130 bp upstream from the<br>
transcription start site direct inducible expression of a luciferase reporter gene (Abe et al.,<br>
Am J. Respir Cell Mol Biol., 22:51 [2000]). This fragment contains binding sites for NF-<br>
ΚB, AP-1, and NF-IL-6 and the binding sites for these factors are required for inducible<br>
IL-8 expression (reviewed in Roebuck, J. Interferon Cytokine Res., 19:429 [1999]).<br>
Accordingly, in some embodiments, the present invention provides skin<br>
equivalent (e.g., NIKS) cells comprising a reporter gene in which expression of a reporter<br>
gene (e.g., an enzyme) is controlled by the regulatory region of an irritant responsive<br>
gene. The present invention is not limited to any irritant responsive promoter. Indeed, a<br>
variety of promoters are contemplated, including but not limited to IL-8 and IL-1α. The<br>
present invention is not limited to the entire regulatory region of the irritant responsive<br>
gene. Indeed, in some embodiments, fragments comprising a portion of the regulatory<br>
region are contemplated. Any region or regions that are responsive to an irritant find use<br>
in the present invention. Guidance for determining if a given region of a gene is<br>
responsive is provided in Example 4 below.<br>
The present invention is not limited to any particular reporter gene. Indeed, a<br>
variety of reporter genes are contemplated, including but not limited to, secreted alkaline<br>
phosphatase (SEAP), chloramphenicol transferase, firefly and bacterial luciferases, -<br>
galactosidase, -lactamase, and green fluorescent protein. The production of these<br>
proteins, with the exception of green fluorescent protein, is detected through the use of<br>
chemiluminescent, colorimetric, or bioluminecent products of specific substrates (e.g., X-<br>
gal and luciferin).<br>
Reporter gene contructs contained on a plasmid are generated using standard<br>
molecular biology techniques. For example, in some embodiments, pSEAP (Tropix,<br>
Bedford, MA) is used to generate a reporter gene construct. pSEAP is a mammalian<br>
expression vector lacking a promoter and containing the SEAP gene (Berger et al., 1988).<br>
The vector contains a polylinker for promoter/enhancer insertion, as well as an intron and<br>
polyadenylation signals from SV40. The vector can be propagated in E.coli due to the<br>
pUC19 derived origin of replication and ampicillin resistance gene. Other suitable<br><br>
vectors for the generation of reporter gene constructs are available (e.g., including but not<br>
limited to, pβ-Gal (β-galactosidase reporter); Tropix).<br>
Stable skin equivalent (e.g., NIKS) cell lines are established which contain the<br>
reporter gene, and these transfected cells are used to generate; in vitro skin equivalents.<br>
The cells are then used to monitor expression of the reporter gene construct in response to<br>
a panel of irritant compounds (See Example 4).<br>
Expression by the reporter gene may be measured using any suitable assay. In<br>
some preferred embodiments, the present invention utilizes gene expression read-outs of<br>
skin irritants by NIKS-derived cell lines harboring reporter gene constructs. The use of<br>
such assays increases the speed and lowers the costs of using the assays for testing new<br>
compounds. For Example, in some embodiments, chemiluminescent reporter gene assays<br>
that can be performed in 30 minutes or less are utilized. Example 4 describes one<br>
illustrative assay that finds use in the present invention.<br>
ii) Screening for Novel Irritant Responsive Genes<br>
In other embodiments, the present invention provides methods and compositions<br>
for identifying novel irritant responsive genes. In some embodiments, in order to obtain<br>
data that correlates well with irritant exposure in the general population, global gene<br>
expression changes in organotypic cultures of primary human keratinocytes from pooled<br>
donors that have been exposed to known skin irritants are assayed. Novel genes<br>
identified by the methods of the present invention find use in irritancy testing assays<br>
using skin equivalent (e.g., NIKS) derived gene reporter cell lines and an irritancy-<br>
predictor gene expression array.<br>
Gene expression arrays have been used successfully to gain new insights into the<br>
global gene expression responses of mammalian cells to serum (Iyer et al., Science<br>
283:83 [1999]) and specific growth factor signaling pathways (Fambrough et al., Cell<br>
97:727 [1999]). In addition, it has recently been established that cluster analysis (Eisen et<br>
al., PNAS 95:14863 [1998] of gene expression patterns can distinguish and predict<br>
different forms of cancer (acute myeloid leukemia versus acute lymphoblastic leukemia)<br><br>
(Golub et al., Science 286:531 [1999]). Analysis of the expression of 6817 human genes<br>
in these two forms of cancer led to the generation of a "predictor" array of the 50 most<br>
informative genes that successfully distinguished an independent set of patient samples<br>
(Golub et al., Supra). This is a powerful example of DNA array analysis to derive a<br>
subset of known and novel genes whose overall pattern can distinguish the subtleties of<br>
two different cellular states of disease. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the present<br>
invention uses gene arrays to identify novel genes secreted in response to known irritants.<br>
The present invention is not limited to any one gene expression array. Gene<br>
expression arrays are available in a variety of formats from a number of commercial<br>
sources, including but not limited to, filter-based arrays (Research Genetics and<br>
Clontech), glass-slide cDNA arrays (Incyte-Genome Systems) and oligonucleotide DNA<br>
microarrays (Affymetrix). In one illustrative example (Example 5), cDNA microarrays<br>
(Genome Systems) are used to screen cultured human keratinocytes treated with known<br>
irritants.<br>
The screening methods of the present invention are used to generate a database of<br>
gene expression changes in human keratinocytes in response to multiple known skin<br>
irritants. The information contained in the database finds use in the development of<br>
irritancy-predictor gene expression arrays. Such arrays are utilized to generate an<br>
irritancy profile that is likely to be a better predictor of in vivo skin irritation than single<br>
endpoint assays currently in use. Simple gene expression read-outs of skin irritants by<br>
skin equivalent (e.g., NIKS) derived cell lines harboring reporter gene constructs will<br>
increase the speed and lower the costs of using these assays for testing new compounds.<br><br>
3. Substrates for Culturing Tumors and Pathological Agents<br>
It is contemplated that skin equivalents of the present invention are also useful for the<br>
culture and study of tumors that occur naturally in the skin as well as for the culture and<br>
study of pathogens that affect the skin. Accordingly, in some embodiments, it is<br>
contemplated that the skin equivalents of the present invention are seeded with malignant<br>
cells. By way of non-limiting example, the skin equivalents can be seeded with<br>
malignant SCC13y cells as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,837, which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference, to provide a model of human squamous cell carcinoma. These<br>
seeded skin equivalents can then be used to screen compounds or other treatment<br>
strategies (e.g., radiation or tomotherapy) for efficacy against the tumor in its natural<br>
environment. Thus, some embodiments of the present invention provide methods<br>
comprising providing a skin equivalent comprising malignant cells or a tumor and at least<br>
one test compound, treating the skin equivalent with the compound, and assaying the<br>
effect of the treatment on the malignant cells or tumors. In other embodiments of the<br>
present invention, methods are provided that comprise providing a skin equivalent<br>
comprising malignant cells or a tumor and at least one test therapy (e.g., radiation or<br>
phototherapy) treating the skin equivalent with the therapy, and assaying the effect of the<br>
therapy on the malignant cells or tumors.<br>
In other embodiments, the skin equivalents are used to culture and study skin<br>
pathogens. By way of non-limiting example, the skin equivalents are infected with<br>
human papilloma virus (HPV) such as HPV18. Methods for preparing skin equivalents<br>
infected with HPV are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,994,115, which is incorporated herein<br>
by reference. Thus, some embodiments of the present invention provide methods<br>
comprising providing a skin equivalent infected with a pathogen of interest and at least<br>
one test compound or treatment and treating the skin equivalent with the test compound<br>
or treatment. In some preferred embodiments, the methods further comprise assaying the<br>
effect the test compound or treatment on the pathogen. Such assays may be conducted by<br>
assaying the presence, absence, or quantity of the pathogen in the skin substitute<br>
following treatment. For example, an ELISA may be performed to detect or quantify the<br>
pathogen. In some particularly preferred embodiments, the pathogen is viral pathogen<br>
such as HPV.<br><br>
4. Wound Closure and Burn Treatment<br>
The skin equivalents of the present invention find use in wound closure and burn<br>
treatment applications. The use of autografts and allografts for the treatment of burns and<br>
wound closure is described in Myers et al., A. J. Surg. 170(l):75-83 (1995) and U.S. Pat.<br>
Nos. 5,693,332; 5,658,331; and 6,039,760, each of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference. In some embodiments, the skin equivalents may be used in conjunction with<br>
dermal replacements such as DERMAGRAFT. In other embodiments, the skin<br>
equivalents are produced using both a standard source of keratinocytes (e.g., NIKS cells)<br>
and keratinocytes from the patient that will receive the graft. Therefore, the skin<br>
equivalent contains keratinocytes from two different sources. In still further<br>
embodiments, the skin equivalent contains keratinocytes from a human tissue isolate.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides methods for wound closure, including<br>
wounds caused by burns, comprising providing a skin equivalent having improved barrier<br>
function according to the present invention and a patient suffering from a wound and<br>
treating the patient with the skin equivalent under conditions such that the wound is<br>
closed.<br>
5. Gene Therapy<br>
In still further embodiments, the skin equivalent is engineered to provide a<br>
therapeutic agent to a subject. The present invention is not limited to the delivery of any<br>
particular therapeutic agent. Indeed, it is contemplated that a variety of therapeutic<br>
agents may be delivered to the subject, including, but not limited to, enzymes, peptides,<br>
peptide hormones, other proteins, ribosomal RNA, ribozymes, and antisense RNA.<br>
These therapeutic agents may be delivered for a variety of purposes, including but not<br>
limited to the purpose of correcting genetic defects. In some particular preferred<br>
embodiments, the therapeutic agent is delivered for the purpose of detoxifying a patient<br>
with an inherited inborn error of metabolism (e.g., aninoacidopathesis) in which the graft<br>
serves as wild-type tissue. It is contemplated that delivery of the therapeutic agent<br>
corrects the defect. In some embodiments, the keratinocytes used to form the skin<br>
equivalent are transfected with a DNA construct encoding a therapeutic agent (e.g.,<br><br>
insulin, clotting factor DC, erythropoietin, etc) and the skin equivalent is grafted onto the<br>
subject. The therapeutic agent is then delivered to the patient's bloodstream or other<br>
tissues from the graft. In preferred embodiments, the nucleic; acid encoding the<br>
therapeutic agent is operably linked to a suitable promoter. The present invention is not<br>
limited to the use of any particular promoter. Indeed, the use of a variety of promoters is<br>
contemplated, including, but not limited to, inducible, constitutive, tissue specific, and<br>
keratinocyte specific promoters. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid encoding the<br>
therapeutic agent is introduced directly into the keratinocytes (i.e., by calcium phosphate<br>
co-precipitation or via liposome transfection). In other preferred embodiments, the<br>
nucleic acid encoding the therapeutic agent is provided as a vector and the vector is<br>
introduced into the keratinocytes by methods known in the art. In some embodiments,<br>
the vector is an episomal vector such as a plasmid. In other embodiments, the vector<br>
integrates into the genome of the keratinocytes. Examples of integrating vectors include,<br>
but are not limited to, retroviral vectors, adeno-associated virus vectors, and transposon<br>
vectors.<br>

Example 1<br>
Effect of Culture Conditions on Epidermal Barrier Function of NIKS Cells<br>
While a number of culture conditions have been shown to enhance various aspects<br>
of barrier function (see Table 1, supra), there has been no systematic attempt to examine<br>
synergistic effects of these conditions. This example provides an assessment of the<br>
combined effects of ascorbic acid, PPAR activators (linoleic acid), FXAR activators<br>
(farnesol), and reduced relative humidity on epidermal barrier function of NIKS<br>
organotypic cultures. Barrier properties of treated cultures are evaluated by measuring<br>
surface electrical capacitance (SEC) (Boyce et al., J. Invest. Dermatol., 107(1): p. 82-7<br>
(1996)), analysis of extracellular lipid composition, and by ultrastructural examination of<br>
tissue sections by electron microscopy.<br>
The culture conditions to be evaluated are presented in Table 2. Culture<br>
supplements are added individually or in combination to the cornification medium at the<br>
indicated concentrations. The organotypic cultures are incubated at the air/liquid<br>
interface for 14-17 days before analysis. The NIKS-based cultures consist of dermal and<br>
epidermal compartments. The dermal compartment consists of a collagen base and is<br>
formed by mixing normal human neonatal dibroblasts, strain CI-1-F, with Type I collagen<br>
in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal call serum (FCS) and<br>
penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) and allowing contraction. The epidermal compartment is<br>
produced by seeding the NIKS cells on the contracted collagen gel in 25 μl of a mixture<br>
of Ham's F-12:DME, (3:1, final calcium concentration 1.88 mM) supplemented with<br>
0.2% FCS, 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone (HC), 8.4 ng/ml cholera toxin (CT), 5 μg/ml insulin<br>
(Ins), 24 μg/ml adenine (Ade), and 100 units/ml P/S. Cells are allowed to attach 2 hours<br>
before flooding culture chamber with media (day 0). On days 1 and 2 cells are refed. On<br>
day 4, cells are lifted to the air interface with a cotton pad and switched to cornification<br>
medium containing Ham's F-12-.DME, (3:1, final calcium concentration 1.88 mM)<br>
supplemented with 2% FCS, 0.4 μg/ml HC, 8.4 ng/ml CT, 5 μg/ml Ins, 24 μg/ml Ade,<br>
and P/S. Cells are fed fresh cornification medium every 3 days.<br>
For measurement of SEC, the impedence of the culture surfaces is determined<br>
using a Dermaphase 9003 impedence meter (NOVA Technologies Corp, Portsmouth,<br>
NH). This instrument provides a measure of the electrical conductivity of the skin<br><br>
surface, which is directly related to the sample's hydration state and barrier properties.<br>
The probe is placed in contact with the culture surface and readings are taken<br>
immediately upon probe contact and at the end of the 10 second period. The initial<br>
reading is then compared to the reading after the probe has been in place for 10 seconds.<br>
An increase in the reading after 10 seconds reflects increased hydration of the culture<br>
surface due to occlusion of the skin surface by the probe. Since surface hydration is<br>
largely determined by the permeability of the stratum corneum, the magnitude of the<br>
difference between the initial and final SEC readings provides a measure of the barrier<br>
properties of the cultures. Each culture condition is analyzed in triplicate and the average<br>
impedence measurements compared to standard, unsupplemented culture conditions to<br>
assess improvements in barrier function. SEC readings from in vitro cultures are also<br>
compared to SEC measurements obtained from normal human skin. Previous studies<br>
have shown that the SEC values of in vitro skin substitutes (400 pF) are about ten-fold<br>
higher than those observed with normal human skin. The goal of these experiments is to<br>
develop conditions that improve barrier function of organotypic keratinocyte cultures<br>
such that SEC readings of these cultures are at most 2-3 fold higher than normal skin.<br><br><br><br>
The lipid compositions of in vitro skin substitutes examined to date show<br>
significant differences compared to that found in normal human skin. In particular, the<br>
levels of ceramides 6 and 7 are greatly reduced in the in vitro cultures. To determine<br>
whether preparation of organotypic skin cultures using the culture conditions shown in<br>
Table 2 has a synergistic effect on epidermal lipid composition, the lipid profiles of<br>
supplemented cultures are compared to lipids isolated from unsupplemented control<br>
cultures and to lipids extracted from normal human skin. Lipid profiles of the cultures<br>
are determined by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) of lipids<br>
extracted from the epidermal culture layers. Organotypic cultures are heated to 60°C for<br>
1 min to separate the epidermal and dermal layers. Total lipids are extracted from the<br>
epidermal layer by sequential extraction with 2 ml chloroform/methanol (1:2), 2 ml<br>
chloroform/methanol/water (1:2:0.5), 2 ml chloroform/methanol (1:2), 2 ml<br>
chloroform/methanol (2:1) and finally with 2 ml chloroform. Following the addition of<br>
0.2 ml 2.5% KC1 and 2 ml water, the samples are centrifuged and the lower phase<br>
removed to a clean tube. The remaining upper phase is extracted with 4 ml chloroform.<br>
The chloroform extract is combined with the lower phase from the initial extract.<br>
Solvents are removed by evaporation under nitrogen and the extracted lipids are<br>
dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1). Total lipid content in the extracts is determined<br>
by weighing samples of the extract after evaporation of solvent.<br>
Extracted lipids (50 micrograms) are applied to silica gel 60 HPTLC plates<br>
(Merck, Darmstad, FRG) and resolved by one-dimensional HPTLC using the ceramide<br>
development system. Lipid separation is achieved by sequential development of HPTLC<br>
plates in chloroform, chloroform/acetone/methanol (76:8:16), ohloroform/hexyl<br><br>
acetate/acetone/methanol (86:1:10:4), chloroform/acetone/methanol (76:4:20),<br>
chloroform/diethyl ether/hexyl acetate/ethyl acetate/acetone/methanol (72:4:1:4:16:4),<br>
and finally with hexane/diethyl ether/ethyl acetate (80:16:4). The TLC plate is dried<br>
briefly following each development step before proceeding to the next solvent system.<br>
Following separation, lipids are detected by staining with copper acetate and copper<br>
sulfate in sulfuric acid followed by charring. Each culture condition is analyzed in<br>
triplicate and the levels of specific lipid components quantified by densitometry and<br>
expressed as a percentage of total lipid. Previous studies have shown that ceramides 5-7<br>
comprise only 10% of total ceramide mass of in vitro skin substitutes as compared to<br>
39% in normal epidermis. There is a corresponding increase in ceramide 2 in the in vitro<br>
cultures, which comprises approximately 50% of total ceramide mass as compared to<br>
22% in normal skin. In preferred embodiments, skin equivalents of the present invention<br>
are cultured under conditon that result in an increase in the content of ceramides 5-7 to<br>
between 30-45% of total ceramide mass and a reduction of the levels of ceramide 2 to<br>
between 20-30% of total ceramide mass.<br>
The ultrastructure of lipid lamellae in organotypic cultures prepared under the<br>
conditions described in Table 2 is examined by electron microscopy. Cultures are fixed<br>
in 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% formaldehyde in 0.1M cacodylate buffer pH 7.4, then post-<br>
fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide followed by 0.25% ruthenium tetroxide. Samples are<br>
dehydrated through an ethanol series, embedded in Eponate, and sectioned on a Reichert<br>
Ultracut microtome. Sections are stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and<br>
examined using a Hitachi H-7000 electron microscope (Hitachi, San Jose, CA). The<br>
organotypic cultures produced by the conditions listed in Table 2 are examined for<br>
restoration of the pattern of alternating electron lucent and electron dense lipid lamellae<br>
seen in normal skin.<br>
Organotypic cultures are also assessed for cell proliferation and cell-type specific<br>
differentiation markers, including involucrin, transglutaminase and keratins.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
Expression of Exogenous Klf4 in NIKS Cells<br>
This Example describes the expression of exogenous Klf4 in NIKS cells. The<br>
transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) is a zinc-finger protein expressed at high<br>
levels in epithelium undergoing terminal differentiation, especially skin and intestinal<br>
epithelium. In skin, it is enriched in the mitotically inactive suprabasal layer of the<br>
epidermis. Klf4 was identified by low-stringency hybridization with a probe for a zinc-<br>
finger domain in aNIH 3T3 cell cDNA library (Shields et at., J. Biol. Chem, 271(33):<br>
20009-17 (1996)). Its three C2H2 zinc fingers relate it to a family of zinc finger<br>
transcription factors that includes EKLF and LKLF, factors that are important for tissue-<br>
specific differentiation. It is expressed at highest levels in growth-arrested cells and at<br>
undetectable levels in proliferating cells. Constitutive expression of Klf4 COS-1 cells<br>
inhibits DNA synthesis. It binds to a defined DNA sequence that is important in the<br>
regulation of the cytochrome P450 gene CYP1A1 (Zhang et al., J. Biol. Chem., 273(28):<br>
17917-25 (1998)). Binding of Klf4 to its binding site in CYP1A1 inhibits expression of<br>
CYP1 A1, probably by competing for DNA binding with SP1 and through direct protein-<br>
protein interactions with SP1. Recent studies report that KLf4 can also regulate its own<br>
expression and that an important binding interaction is with p300/CBP (Geiman et al.,<br>
Nucleic Acids Res., 28(5): 1106-1113 (2000); Mahatan et al., Nucleic Acids Res.,<br>
27(23): 4562-9 (1999)). As is true with other key transcription factors, Klf4 can be a<br>
potent activator of some genes and a repressor of others.<br>
Klf4 is currently the best candidate gene for a key regulator of barrier function in<br>
the skin. Elimination of Klf4 expression in mice results in neonatal lethality, apparently<br>
as a result of excessive water loss through a defective epidermal permeability barrier.<br>
These observations suggest that Klf4 regulates genes that are essential for the formation<br>
of a normal epidermal permeability barrier and raise the possibility that expression of<br>
Klf4 in cultured skin substitutes might improve the barrier function of these cultures.<br>
This Example describes two methods of expressing Klf4 in differentiating keratinocytes.<br>
The first method is the generation of an inducible expression construct in which<br>
expression of human Klf4 is regulated by the presence or absence of the tetracycline<br>
derivative, doxycycline, in the culture medium. A second method of directing Klf4<br><br>
epression in organotypic cultures utilizes a DNA fragment containing either 3.7 kb of the<br>
involucrin promoter region, which directs expression in differentiating keratinocytes<br>
(Carroll et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90(21): p. 10270-4 (1993)) or 135 bp of the<br>
transglutaminase 3 promoter region, which also directs expression in differentiating<br>
keratinocytes (Lee et al., J. Biol. Chem., 271(8): 4561-8 (1996)).<br>
The cDNA encoding human Klf4 is isolated by PCR using primers to the known<br>
Klf4 sequence (Yet et al., J. Biol. Chem., 273(2): 1026-31 (1998)). The Klf4 cDNA is<br>
cloned into the expression vector pTRE2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), which contains a<br>
minimal CMV promoter flanked by seven repeats of the tet operator (tetO). The integrity<br>
of the cloned Klf4 cDNA is verified by sequence analysis using primers derived from the<br>
known Klf4 sequence.<br>
Purified DNA from the Klf4 expression plasmid is introduced into NIKS cells<br>
along with the pTet-On plasmid (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), which encodes a derivative of<br>
the tet repressor protein. This protein, rtTA, binds to the tet operator in the presence of<br>
doxycycline and induces expression of Klf4 when doxycycline is present in the culture<br>
medium. The gene encoding a protein that confers resistance to blasticidin will be<br>
amplified by PCR and cloned into the pTet-On plasmid to allow for selection of stably-<br>
transfected cells. Transfected cells are selected by growth in media containing blasticidin<br>
(5 micrograms/ml), which will kill any NIKS cells that have not incorporated the<br>
plasmids into their genome. Stable cell lines that contain both the pTRE2-Klf4 and pTet-<br>
On plasmids are identified by examining multiple clonal cell lines by Southern blot using<br>
digoxygenin-labeled probes derived from both the pTet-On and pTRE2 plasmids.<br>
Multiple clones that contain intact copies of the pTet-On and pTRE2 plasmids are<br>
isolated and examined for expression of the Klf4 transgene in the presence of<br>
doxycycline.<br>
To examine expression from the Klf4 transgene, monolayer cultures of stably-<br>
transfected cell lines and control untransfected cells are incubated in medium containing<br>
doxycycline (1 microgram per ml). Total RNA is then isolated from cultures at multiple<br>
time points after doxycycline addition using Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies,<br>
Rockville, MD). Twenty micrograms of total RNA is analyzed by Northern blot<br>
hybridization using digoxygenin-labeled probes derived from the cloned Klf4 cDNA and<br><br>
detected using the Genius non-radioactive detection system (Roche Molecular<br>
Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). RNA is also isolated from transfected cultures grown in<br>
the absence of doxycycline to determine the basal level of Klf4 expression from the<br>
transgene. RNA isolated from untransfected cells at each time point will be analyzed to<br>
establish a background level of Klf4 expression from the endogenous Klf4 gene.<br>
The Klf4 cDNA is also cloned into an expression plasmid containing promoter<br>
sequences from the involucrin gene. A DNA fragment containing 3.7 kb of the<br>
involucrin promoter directs transgene expression to the suprabasal layers of the<br>
epidermis. This promoter fragment is amplified from total genomic DNA by PCR using<br>
primers to the known INV promoter sequence (Lopez-Bayghen et al., J. Biol. Chem.,<br>
271(1): 512-520 (1996)). The Klf4 cDNA is cloned into a plasmid containing this<br>
involucrin promoter fragment and used to generate stable cell lines of NIKS that contain<br>
this transgene. Stable cell lines are selected by co-transfecting NIKS cells with the<br>
INV/Klf4 plasmid and a plasmid expressing the blasticidin resistance gene and growing<br>
the transfected cells in the presence of blasticidin. Multiple blasticidin-resistant cell lines<br>
will be isolated and examined by Northern blot for increased Klf4 expression as<br>
compared to cells transfected only with the blasticidin-resistance plasmid.<br>
While the involucrin promoter has been used successfully to direct expression of several<br>
transgenes to the differentiating epidermis, it is possible that the INV/KLF4 construct<br>
will not be expressed to high enough levels or in the proper temporal or spatial pattern to<br>
have an effect on barrier function. If Klf4 expression from the involucrin promoter<br>
construct is not readily detected, expression constructs are generated containing the<br>
promoter regions of another keratinocyte-specific gene, transglutaminase 3. The Klf4<br>
cDNA is cloned into an expression plasmid containing promoter sequences from the<br>
transglutaminase 3 (TG3) gene. A TG3 promoter fragment containing 126 bp upstream<br>
and 10 bp downstream from the transcription start site directs transgene expression to<br>
epithelial cells (Lee et al., J Biol Chem, 271(8): 4561-8 [1996]).<br>
The Klf4 cDNA is cloned into a plasmid containing this TG3 promoter fragment<br>
and generate stable cell lines of NIKS that contain this transgene. Stable cell lines are<br>
selected by co-transfecting NIKS cells with the TG3/Klf4 plasmid and a plasmid<br>
expressing the blasticidin resistance gene and growing the transfected cells in the<br><br>
presence of blasticidin. Multiple blasticidin-resistant cell lines are isolated and examined<br>
by Northern blot for increased Klf4 expression as compared to cells transfected only with<br>
the blasticidin-resistance plasmid.<br>
Stable NIKS cell lines that express Klf4 from the involucrin promoter or the<br>
doxycycline-inducible system are examined in organotypic culture to confirm that Klf4 is<br>
expressed under these culture conditions. Standard media and procedures for organotypic<br>
cultures are described in Example 1. Klf4-expressing NIKS cells are seeded onto a<br>
contracted collagen matrix containing fibroblasts and grown in submerged culture for 4<br>
days before being lifted to the air interface. Organotypic cultures are fed cornification<br>
medium every 3 days and maintained at the air/liquid interface for 14 days to form a<br>
stratified epithelium. Cultures with NIKS expressing Klf4 from the inducible promoter<br>
are grown in media containing 1 microgram/ml doxycycline. Total RNA is isolated from<br>
organotypic cultures by homogenizing the epidermal layer in Trizol reagent, extracting<br>
the homogenate with chloroform, and precipitating total RNA with isopropanol. RNA is<br>
examined for Klf4 expression as described above for monolayer cultures.<br>
The effects of Klf4 expression on barrier function are examined by surface<br>
capacitance measurement, lipid composition and ultrastructure of the organotypic<br>
cultures by the methods described in Example 1. In addition, some of the agents to be<br>
added to the cultures in Example 1, especially the PPAR and FXAR activators, may serve<br>
to activate other regulatory genes that act in concert with Klf 4. This hypothesis is<br>
supported by the ability of these agents to accelerate the in utero development of barrier<br>
function.<br>
Data on the timing and extent of Klf4 expression using the two expression<br>
systems described herein will allow for the design of strategies to enhance barrier<br>
function by regulating Klf4 expression in NIKS organotypic cultures. The NIKS<br>
organotypic cultures have been extensively characterized for ultrastructure and<br>
expression of key differentiation markers. Examination of these phenotypic properties of<br>
the culture in the presence of added Klf4 expression will provide additional clues to the<br>
consequences of Klf4 expression.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
Secretion of IL-1α in Response to Skin Irritants<br>
This example demonstrates that NIKS cells secrete IL-1α in response to skin<br>
irritants. To determine whether organotypic cultures of NIKS cells exhibit irritant<br>
responses typical of primary keratinocytes, NIKS skin equivalent cultures were exposed<br>
to concentrations of SDS that are known to elicit skin irritant responses in vivo and in<br>
vitro. Solutions of SDS (0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.5%) were topically applied to air-exposed<br>
NIKS organotypic cultures and incubated for 24 hr at 37°C. After 24 hr, the media<br>
underneath the cultures was assayed for IL-1α protein using a Quantikine IL-1α ELISA<br>
kit (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and cultures were incubated with MTS reagent<br>
(Promega Corp., Madison, WI) to determine cell viability. The concentrations of IL-1α<br>
in media from control and SDS-treated cultures are shown in Figure 3. Media from<br>
untreated cultures contained 25 pg/ml EL-1α, whereas the concentration of IL-1α in<br>
cultures treated with 0.1%, 0.2% or 0.5% SDS was 290, 375 and 275 pg/ml respectively.<br>
These values correspond well with published IL-1α responses in SDS-exposed<br>
skin equivalents (Perkins et al., Toxicological Sciences, 48:218 [1999]). The decrease in<br>
IL-1α secretion in cultures treated with 0.5% SDS is likely due to decreased cell viability<br>
in these cultures as detected by an MTS assay.<br>
Example 4<br>
Generation of Reporter Gene Constructs<br>
This example describes methods for generating NIKS cells comprising reporter<br>
gene constructs comprising IL-8 promoter fragments. Using primers to the known<br>
sequence, PCR is used to amplify a 1.5 kb DNA fragment containing the IL-8 promoter<br>
and flanking sequences. After verification of the amplified DNA by sequence analysis,<br>
this DNA fragment is cloned into the expression vector pSEAP (Tropix, Bedford, MA),<br>
which contains the coding region for SEAP but which lacks regulatory elements to drive<br>
its expression. The integrity of the reporter construct is verified by restriction analysis<br>
and DNA sequencing.<br><br>
Initially experiments to determine whether the IL-8/SEAP reporter construct is<br>
inducible by irritants are performed with transiently-transfected NIKS cells. Pools of<br>
transfected cells are exposed to known irritants (e.g., SDS, trans-retinoic acid) and to<br>
control substances (e.g., mineral oil, water) and the amount of SEAP activity is<br>
determined by chemiluminescence at 4, 8 and 24 hr after irritant exposure. SEAP activity<br>
is detected by incubation of media from transfected cells with a chemiluminescent<br>
substrate (Phospha-light, Tropix, Bedford, MA) using a microplate luminometer.<br>
Analysis of IL-8/SEAP reporter gene expression is performed in triplicate using<br>
independently transfected cell populations.<br>
Expression of RNA from the IL-8/SEAP reporter is compared with increases in<br>
the mRNA from the endogenous EL-8 gene. In parallel with the SEAP assays described<br>
above, RNA is isolated from identically-treated cultures using Trizol reagent (Life<br>
Technologies, Rockville, MD). As an independent measurement of EL-8 expression in<br>
irritant-treated keratinocytes, cultures of primary keratinocytes from pooled donors are<br>
treated with the irritants and processed for RNA purification. Total RNA is examined by<br>
Northern blot for increased expression of the endogenous IL-8 gene using a PCR<br>
fragment amplified based on known sequences. The level of SEAP mRNA expressed<br>
from the IL-8/SEAP transgene is also quantified by Northern, analysis. Increases in<br>
SEAP activity, as measured by chemiluminescence, and SBAP mRNA, determined by<br>
Northern blot, are compared to increases in IL-8 mRNA to determine whether expression<br>
of the SEAP reporter accurately reflects the induction of IL-8 in response to irritants.<br>
Expression of IL-8 mRNA increases 7 to 40-fold following 24 hr exposure to<br>
various skin irritants (de Brugerolle de Fraissinette et al., supra). The reporter construct<br>
is judged to be irritant-inducible if the level of SEAP activity and mRNA increase at least<br>
5-fold in irritant-treated cultures.<br>
If SEAP activity is increased in transfected NIKS cells following irritant<br>
exposure, stable cell lines are generated with the IL-8/SEAP reporter construct as<br>
follows. NIKS cells are co-transfected with the IL-8/SEAP reporter construct and a<br>
plasmid that confers resistance to blasticidin (pCMV/bsd Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).<br>
Transfected cells are grown in the presence of blasticidin to select for stably-transfected<br>
cells. Individual clones of transfected cells are examined for expression of the IL-<br><br>
8/SEAP reporter gene in response to irritants. Clones that display irritant-inducible<br>
transgene expression are used to generate organotypic skin cultures. These cultures are<br>
examined for irritant-responsiveness by topical application of SDS, trans-retinoic acid,<br>
and negative controls (water, mineral oil) as described above. The organotypic cultures<br>
may also be mechanically disrrupted, lysed in buffer containing a non-ionic detergent,<br>
and assayed for SEAP activity.<br>
Because the 1.5 kb fragment of the EL-8 regulatory region may not contain all of<br>
the regulatory elements necessary for full responsiveness, it is possible that the<br>
magnitude of the reporter gene response may be less than that observed with the<br>
endogenous EL-8 gene. If this fragment is insufficient to direct irritant-specific<br>
expression of SEAP, the PCR product is used as a probe to screen a genomic DNA<br>
library. This approach allows one to recover larger DNA fragments that are likely to<br>
contain more of the IL-8 regulatory region. These DNA fragments are characterized by<br>
restriction mapping and sequence analysis. DNA fragments containing between 5 and 10<br>
kb of genomic DNA flanking the EL-8 promoter are cloned into the pSEAP vector and<br>
examined for the ability to direct irritant-inducible SEAP expression as described above.<br>
Alternative reporter gene constructs are also generated using a DNA fragment<br>
containing the regulatory region of another irritant-inducible cytokine, EL-1α. Published<br>
sequences for this gene include 1437 bp of DNA upstream from the transcription start site<br>
(Furutani et al., Nuc. Acid Res. 14:3167 [1986]). A DNA fragment containing these<br>
sequences has been used to direct expression of a CAT reporter gene in response to viral<br>
transactivators (Mori and Prager, Blood 87:3410 [1996]). This fragment contains two<br>
binding sites for NF-ΚB, a transcription factor that is involved in gene expression changes<br>
in response to skin irritants (Corsini et al., J. Invest Dermatol. 108:892 [1997]).<br>
Additionally, a NIKS cell line reporter gene construct is also generated by<br>
introducing a reporter gene construct into the endogenous IL-8 locus in NIKS cells. This<br>
"knock-in" strategy has been utilized to accurately reproduce proper temporal and spatial<br>
expression of reporter genes (Elefanty et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 95:11897 [1998];<br>
Morrison et al., Mech Dev, 1999. 84169 [1999]; Jin et al., Biochem Biophys Res<br>
Commun, 270:978 [2000]).<br><br>
Example 5<br>
Identification of Irritant-Responsive Genes<br>
This example describes experiments useful for the identification of novel genes<br>
whose expression is induced by irritant exposure. Genome Systems cDNA microarray<br>
(GEM microarrays; Incyte Genomics, Palo Alto, California) are used for the analysis of<br>
gene expression. All manipulations are performed by Incyte Genomics. A UniGEM V<br>
2.0 Microarray, built from Incyte's sequence verified cDNA clones and containing 8514<br>
unique human cDNAs is used. Larger arrays are used as they become available.<br>
In vitro skin equivalent cultures are prepared using cultured human keratinocytes from<br>
pooled adult donors (available from Clonetics, Walkersville, MD). Cultured<br>
keratinocytes are seeded onto a dermal equivalent consisting of dermal fibroblasts<br>
embedded in a contracted collagen matrix and the resulting organotypic culture is lifted<br>
to the air interface to induce differentiation and stratification of the keratinocyte layer.<br>
After 14 days, organotypic cultures are treated topically with known irritants (e.g., 0.2%<br>
SDS, 0.005% calcipotriol, 0.025% trans-retinoic acid) or non-irritant controls (e.g.,<br>
mineral oil, vaseline) for 24 hr. These compounds all indues expression and secretion of<br>
the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1α and IL-8 in irritant-treated skin equivalents (de<br>
Brugerolle de Fraissinette et al., supra).<br>
Purification of mRNA from organotypic cultures is carried out using known<br>
procedures. The epidermal layer of control and irritant-exposed organotypic cultures is<br>
mechanically dislodged from the collagen dermal equivalent and placed in Trizol reagent<br>
(Life Technologies, Rockville, MD) for 1 hr. Following periodic vortexing and pipetting<br>
to break apart the tissue, RNA is separated from cellular protein and DNA by phenol-<br>
chloroform extraction. The aqueous phase from this extraction is then treated with<br>
ethanol to precipitate total RNA. Poly A+ mRNA is isolated from total cellular RNA<br>
using the Oligotex mRNA purification system (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).<br>
To verify the that treated cultures exhibit an irritant response, equal amounts of<br>
mRNA from control and irritant-treated cultures are examined by Northern blot for<br>
induction of the known irritant-responsive genes IL-1α and DL-8. RNA from cultures<br>
that exhibit induction of EL-1α and IL-8 expression are compared to RNA from control<br>
cultures by gene expression profiling to identify novel irritant-responsive genes. Purified<br><br>
mRNA is dissolved in TE buffer at a concentration of 50ng/μl and shipped to Incyte<br>
Genomics for cDNA microarray analysis. Data analysis is performed using the<br>
GEMTools Software from Genome Systems and cluster analysis programs available from<br>
the MIT Center for Genome Research and the laboratory of Patrick O. Brown at Stanford<br>
University.<br>
Genes identified as irritant responsive are utilized in reporter gene assays using<br>
the methods described in Example 4 above.<br>
Example 6<br>
Lipid Content of Skin Equivalents<br>
This example describes the preparation of skin equivalents with optimized serum-<br>
free medium and a second set of skin equivalents prepared with sub-optimal medium.<br>
Subsequently, the lipid content of the resulting cultures was determined.<br>
Organotypic cultures were initiated by plating 350,000 NIKS cells onto dermal<br>
equivalents previously prepared within a 10 mm MELLICELL insert. The media used to<br>
complete this step was comprised of a base medium [3:1 mixture of Ham's F12<br>
medium/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DME), supplemented with 24 μg/ml<br>
adenine, 8.3 ng/ml cholera toxin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone, with the<br>
final calcium concentration adjusted to 1.88 mM] supplemented with 0.2% Fetal Clone II<br>
(a calf serum substitute).<br>
Two days post-plating, the organotypic cultures were supplied with fresh medium<br>
to maintain growth. Cultures were supplied with either base medium supplemented with<br>
0.2% Fetal Clone II or base medium supplemented with 0.2% Fetal Clone II and<br>
additional constituents (1 mg/ml endotoxin-free BSA, 1 ng/ml epidermal growth factor,<br>
50μg/ml ascorbic acid, lμM isoproterenol, 10μM carnitine, 10μM serine, 25 μM oleic<br>
acid, 15μM linoleic acid, 7ΜM arachidonic acid and 1μM α-tocopherol).<br>
Four days post-lifting, and every other day for the remainder of the culture period,<br>
the cultures were supplied with optimal medium (base medium supplemented with 1<br>
mg/ml endotoxin-free BSA, 1 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid,<br>
1μM isoproterenol. 10μM carnitine, 10μM serine, 25 μM oleic acid, 15ΜM linoleic acid,<br>
7μM arachidonic acid and 1μM α-tocopherol) or a sub-optimal medium (base medium<br><br>
supplemented with 1 mg/ml endotoxin-free BSA, 1 ng/ml epidennal growth factor, 10μM<br>
carnitine and 10μM serine).<br>
At the completion of the culture period, total lipids were extracted from the<br>
cultures and resolved by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC).<br>
Following separation, the plates were charred and the resulting chromatograms were<br>
scanned by densitometry to quantify individual lipid species. The cultures grown in<br>
optimized culture medium contained a higher percentage of total ceramides than cultures<br>
grown in sub-optimal medium (Table 3). In addition, the cultures grown in optimal<br>
medium contained much higher levels of the polar ceramides 3, 4, 5, and 6 than cultures<br>
grown under sub-optimal conditions.<br><br>
Example 7<br>
Expression of GKLF in NIKS Cells<br>
This example describes the expression in NIKS cells of GKLF, a protein thought<br>
to mediate barrier function development in mice.<br>
DNA encoding the GKLF protein was isolated by PCR and cloned into an<br>
expression vector containing the human involucrin promoter. After verification of the<br>
GKLF and involucrin fragments by DNA sequencing, the constructs were introduced into<br><br>
NIKS cells by transfection. Twenty-four hours after transfection, total RNA was isolated<br>
from the transfected cells and expression of GKLF in these cells was examined by<br>
reverse-transcription/PCR (RT-PCR).<br>
A PCR product corresponding to spliced GKLF mRNA was detected in RNA<br>
from cells transfected with the involucrin/GKLF construct, but not in control RNA from<br>
cells transfected with empty vector. In addition, the GKLF PCR product was not<br>
detected in reactions from which reverse transcriptase was omitted. These results<br>
demonstrate that GKLF mRNA was expressed in transfected NIKS cells.<br>
In a second set of experiments, DNA encoding GKLF was cloned into the pTRE2<br>
vector, which allows for inducible expression of GKLF following addition of<br>
doxycycline. After verification of the GKLF and involucrin fragments by DNA<br>
sequencing, the constructs were introduced into NIKS cells by transfection. Eight hours<br>
after transfection, doxycycline was added to half of the transfected cultures and all<br>
cultures were incubated for an additional 16 hours. Twenty-four hours after transfection,<br>
total RNA was isolated from the transfected cells and expression of GKLF in these cells<br>
was examined by reverse-transcription/PCR (RT-PCR). A PCR product corresponding to<br>
spliced GKLF mRNA was observed in samples with and without doxycycline, but more<br>
product was seen in samples following doxycycline addition. No PCR products were<br>
detected in reactions from which reverse transcriptase was omitted. These results<br>
demonstrate inducible expression of GKLF mRNA in transfected NIKS cells.<br>
Example 8<br>
Culture Methods<br>
This example describes culture methods common to the follwoing Examples.<br>
Media. The organotypic culture process uses six different culture media: 3T3<br>
feeder cell medium (TM); fibroblast growth medium (FM); "NIKS medium (NM); plating<br>
medium (PM); stratification medium A (SMA); and stratification medium B (SMB). TM<br>
is used to propagate 3T3 cells that act as feeder cells for NIKS cells in monolayer culture.<br>
TM is a mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DME, GibcoBRL)<br>
supplemented with 10% calf serum (Hyclone). FM is a mixture of Ham's F-12 medium<br>
(GibcoBRL) and 10% Fetal Clone II (Hyclone) serum. NM is used to grow NIKS<br><br>
keratinocytes. NM is a 3:1 mixture of Ham's F-12 medium (GibcoBRL) and DME<br>
supplemented with 2.5% Fetal Clone II (Hyclone), 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone<br>
(Calbiochem), 8.4 ng/ml cholera toxin (ICN), 5 μg/ml insulin (GibcoBRL), 24 μg/ml<br>
adenine (Sigma) and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF, R&amp;D systems). PM is the<br>
medium used when NIKS cells are seeded onto a dermal equivalent. PM is the same as<br>
NM except that EGF is removed,CaCl2 (Sigma) is supplemented to a final calcium<br>
concentration of 1.88 mM, and only 0.2% Fetal Clone II serum is added. SMA is the<br>
same as PM with the addition of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 μM<br>
isoproterenol, 10 μM carnitine, 10 μM serine, 25 μM oleic acid, 15 μM linoleic acid, 7<br>
μM arachidonic acid, 1 μM α-tocopherol, 0.05 mg/ml ascorbic acid (all from Sigma), and<br>
1 ng/ml EGF. SMB is used during the epidermal stratification phase of STRATATEST<br>
skin equivalent and STRATAGRAFT skin equivalent growth. SMB is the same as SMA<br>
but without the presence of the Fetal Clone II serum supplement.<br>
Feeder preparation. Prior to starting STRATATEST skin equivalent or<br>
STRATAGRAFT skin equivalent organotypic cultures, 3T3 feeder cells are prepared and<br>
then used either fresh or frozen for later use. 3T3 cells are grown to confluence and<br>
treated with mitomycin-C (4 μg/ml of mitomycin-C in TM, Roche) for two hours. The<br>
cells are then washed, resuspended, and plated at a density of 1.25 x 106 per 100 mm<br>
tissue culture dish to support NIKS growth. If frozen feeders are used, a single frozen<br>
ampoule containing 1 ml with 2.5 x 106 is thawed, diluted with fresh TM and plated onto<br>
one or more 100 mm tissue culture dishes. This is done for as many dishes as will be<br>
needed for NIKS cell growth one day prior to plating the NIKS cells.<br>
Dermal equivalent preparation. Frozen NHDF cells are thawed and plated.<br>
The cells are fed FM the next day to remove residual cryoprotectant and subsequently to<br>
maintain cell growth. Preconfluent NHDF cells are harvested for use in the dermal<br>
equivalent. To prepare the dermal equivalent, rat tail tendon collagen (Type I, Becton-<br>
Dickinson) is first diluted to 3 mg/ml in 0.03N acetic acid and chilled on ice. A mixture<br>
of concentrated Ham's F1.2 medium (8.7X normal strength, buffered with HEPES at pH<br>
7.5) is mixed with Fetal Clone EL These two solutions are 11.5 and 10% of the final<br>
solution volume. 1 N NaOH is added to the medium mixture (2.5% of final solution).<br>
The diluted collagen (74%) is then added to the mixture. A 2% volume of suspended<br><br>
fibroblasts (2.5 x 106cells/ml for the dermal equivalent of STRATATEST and 1 x 106<br>
for dermal equivalent of STRATAGRAFT) is added to the mixture. The solution is<br>
mixed gently but thoroughly. 100 Μl is aliquoted into tissue culture inserts (MILLICELL<br>
from Millipore Corp.) placed 25 in a 100 mm tissue culture dish for STRATATEST. The<br>
STRATAGRAFT skin equivalent uses TRANSWELL inserts from Corning. A 13 ml<br>
dermal equivalent is poured into each insert making it roughly three times the thickness<br>
of a STRATATEST dermal equivalent. After 30 minutes for gel formation, the dish<br>
containing STRATATEST dermal equivalents is flooded with 20 ml of FM. One or two<br>
drops FM are placed on the surface of each STRATATEST dermal equivalent. For<br>
STRATAGRAFT dermal equivalents, 80 ml of FM is placed around the TRANSWELL<br>
insert in a 150 mm tissue culture dish and 10 ml is placed on top of the dermal<br>
equivalent. The inserts are placed in 37°C, 5% CO2, 90% relative humidity incubator<br>
until used. One day prior to seeding the dermal equivalents with NIKS cells, they are<br>
lifted to the air interface by placing them onto a sterile stainless steel mesh with two<br>
wicking pads (S&amp;S Biopath) on top to supply medium through the bottom of the tissue<br>
culture insert.<br>
NIKS Growth and Seeding. Feeders are prepared fresh or thawed and plated in<br>
TM one day prior to NIKS plating. NIKS cells are plated onto the feeders at a density of<br>
approximately 3 x 105 cells per 100 mm dish. If the NIKS cells are newly thawed, they<br>
are fed fresh NM one day post-plating to remove residual cryoprotectant. The NIKS cells<br>
are fed NM to maintain growth as required. When cell approach confluence, the NIKS<br>
cells are harvested, counted, and resuspended in PM. 4.65 x 1.05 NIKS cells/cm2 are<br>
seeded onto the surface of the MIILLICELL or TRANSWELL dermal equivalents, which<br>
have been lifted to the air interface for one day. The dishes are fed PM to flood<br>
underneath the metal lifter and placed back into the incubator. Two days later, the<br>
cultures are fed SMA. After an additional two days, the cultures are fed SMB and<br>
transferred to a 75% humidity incubator where they remain, maintained with additional<br>
SMB feedings, until mature.<br><br>
Example 9<br>
This example describes the preparation of dermal equivalents using 1 mg/ml<br>
collagen. Briefly, 24 ml Ham's F12 medium prepared at 10X concentration was mixed<br>
with 4.8 ml sterile H2O, 2.4 ml Penicillin/Streptomycin mixture and 24 ml Fetal Clone II<br>
in a 50 ml conical tube. Rat tail tendon collagen Type I (1.46 ml) at 4.11 mg/ml was<br>
diluted with 1.882 ml sterile H2O and 2.658 ml of 0.05% acetic acid. Normal human<br>
dermal fibroblasts were harvested from culture and resuspended at a cell density of 106<br>
and 104 cells/ml. 0.815 ml of the medium-containing mixture was combined with 2.619<br>
ml of diluted collagen and 34 ul of fibroblasts at 104 cells/ml. 116.5 ul of this mixture<br>
was aliquotted into tissue culture inserts (25 of which are in a Petri dish) and allowed to<br>
gel for 15 minutes at 37°C. An additional 0.815 ml of the medium-containing mixture<br>
was combined with another 2.619 ml of diluted collagen and 137 μl of fibroblasts at 106<br>
cells/ml. 116.5 μl of this mixture was aliquotted into the tissue culture inserts on top of<br>
the previous gel and allowed to gel for 30 minutes.<br>
The petri dish was then flooded with 20 ml of FM medium and incubated for 5<br>
days. The FM was then removed and the liquid aspirated from the surfaces of the dermal<br>
equivalents. NIKS cells were harvested using standard procedures, resuspended at<br>
2.345x106 cells/ml in plating medium (PM). 150 μl of this suspension was put on the<br>
surface of each dermal equivalent and allowed to incubate for 2 hours. The seeded<br>
dermal equivalents were then flooded with 20 ml PM. After two days the submerged<br>
cultures were refed with PM.<br>
After two more days the medium was removed from the petri dish as well as from<br>
the surface of the cultures. The cultures were lifted to the air interface and fed<br>
approximately 30 ml of PM supplemented to 2% serum every 2 days. Cultures were<br>
analyzed 14 days after they were seeded. None of the cultures had complete epidermal<br>
coverage of the dermal equivalent. Thus they were unsuitable for commercial<br>
application.<br>
Example 10<br>
This example describes the preparation of dermal equivalents using 3 mg/ml<br>
collagen. 4.785 ml Ham's F12 medium prepared at 10X concentration was mixed with<br><br>
0.946 ml sterile H2O, 0.473 ml Penicillin/Streptomycin mixture, and 4.785 ml Fetal<br>
Clone II in a 50 ml conical tube. 4.6 ml of this medium mixture was mixed with 0.242<br>
ml sterile H2O and 0.289 ml 1N NaOH. 0.92 ml of the mixture was mixed with 3 ml rat<br>
tail tendon collagen Type I at 3.11 mg/ml. To this was added 186 μl of a human dermal<br>
fibroblast suspension at 106 cells/ml. 100 μl of this mixture was placed into the<br>
MILLICELL inserts (1 cm diam) and allowed to gel for 30 minutes. The petri dish was<br>
then flooded with 20 ml of FM medium and allowed to incubate. After 5 days, the FM<br>
was removed and the liquid aspirated from the surfaces of the dermal equivalents.<br>
NIKS™ cells were harvested using standard procedures, resuspended at 2.345x106<br>
cells/ml in plating medium (PM). 150 μl of this suspension was put on the surface of<br>
each dermis and allowed to incubate for 2 hours. The seeded dermal equivalents were<br>
then flooded with 20 ml PM. After two more days the medium was removed from the<br>
petri dish (including the surface of the cultures) and the cultures were lifted to the air<br>
interface and fed approximately 30 ml of stratification medium every 2 days. Cultures<br>
were analyzed 14 days after they were seeded. At the completion of culture growth, all<br>
of the cultures had complete coverage of the dermal equivalent with epidermis and were<br>
smooth and dry in appearance. Thus they were highly acceptable for commercial<br>
application.<br>
Example 11<br>
This example demonstrates the beneficial effects of prelifting the dermal equivalent<br>
prior to seeding with keratinocytes. 1.31 ml Ham's F12 medium prepared at 10X<br>
concentration was mixed with 0.328 ml sterile H2O, 0.148 ml Penicillin/Streptomycin<br>
mixture, and 1.472 ml Fetal Clone II in a 50 ml conical tube and 1.63 ml (~half) was split<br>
into a second tube. 2.92 ml of rat tail tendon collagen (4.11 mg/ml) was mixed with<br>
3.764 ml sterile H2O, and 5.316 ml of 0.05% acetic acid to give 1 mg/ml collagen in<br>
0.05% acetic acid. 5.24 ml of the diluted collagen was added to 1.63 ml of the medium<br>
mixture. 74 μl of human dermal fibroblast cells harvested with standard protocols at a cell<br>
density of 104 cells/ml was added and gently mixed. 116.5 Μl of this mixture was<br>
aliquotted into tissue culture inserts (25 to a Petri dish) and allowed to gel for 15 minutes<br>
at 37°C. Another 5.24 ml of collagen was added to the second 1.63 ml of medium<br><br>
mixture along with 274 μl of fibroblasts at 106 cells/ml. 116.5 μl was added to each<br>
insert on top of the first gelled collagen layer. This was allowed to gel for 30 minutes at<br>
37 °C. The petri dishes were then flooded with 20 ml of FM so that the dermal<br>
equivalents could mature submerged in medium. After four days the medium was<br>
removed from the petri dish (including from the surface of the cultures) and the cultures<br>
were lifted to the air interface and fed approximately 30 ml of FM. The cultures were left<br>
in the incubator in this state overnight. Then they were seedsd with 150 μl of NIKS<br>
keratinocytes harvested from monolayer culture using standard protocols at a cell density<br>
of 2.345 x 106 cells/ml. After seeding, the cultures were fed PM and returned to the<br>
incubator. Two days later, the cultures were fed with SMA, and every second day<br>
thereafter cultures were fed with SMB for a total of eight feedings. At the completion of<br>
culture growth, all of the cultures had complete coverage of the dermal equivalent with<br>
epidermis and were smooth and dry in appearance. Histology revealed that the prelifted<br>
samples had approximately equal thicknesses of dermis and epidermis, and all stratified<br>
layers were present in the epidermis.<br>
Example 12<br>
This example describes the effect of prelifting for the entire life of the dermal<br>
equivalent. Cultures were prepared exactly as in the successful experiment listed above,<br>
with the exception that they were never submerged. The gels were poured with the<br>
MILLICELL inserts lifted to the air interface and all subsequent seeding and feeding took<br>
place with the cultures lifted. At the completion of culture growth, one in ten of the<br>
cultures had complete coverage of the dermal equivalent with epidermis. This effect is<br>
apparently due in part to poor adherence of the dermal equivalent to the bottom of the<br>
MILLICELL insert since the dermal equivalent had pulled away from the sides in most<br>
samples. Histology indicated that the dermal and epidermal, layer thicknesses were<br>
highly variable. Likewise epidermal stratification ranged from well differentiated to only<br>
monolayer coverage which was unacceptable for commercial use.<br><br>
Example 13<br>
This example describes the optimization of a serum-free media that supports full<br>
stratification of keratinocytes in organotypic culture that also results in skin equivalents<br>
with improved barrier function.<br>
Organotypic cultures were initiated by plating 350,000 NIKS cells onto a dermal<br>
equivalent previously prepared within a 10mm MILLICELL insert. The media used to<br>
complete this step was comprised of a base medium (3:1 mixture of Ham's F12<br>
medium/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DME), supplemented with 24 μg/ml<br>
adenine, 8.3 ng/ml cholera toxin, 5 μg/m.1 insulin, 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 100 units/ml<br>
penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, with final calcium concentration adjusted to 1.88 mM<br>
through the addition of CaCl2) supplemented with 0.2% Fetal Clone II.<br>
Two days post-plating, the organotypic cultures were supplied with fresh media to<br>
maintain growth. Cultures were supplied with either base media supplemented with 0.2%<br>
Fetal Clone II or base media with additional constituents (1 mg/ml low endotoxin bovine<br>
serum albumin, 1 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 1 μM isoproterenol, 10 ΜM carnitine,<br>
10 ΜM serine, 25 ΜM oleic acid, 15 μM linoleic acid, 7 μM arachidonic acid, 1 μM α-<br>
tocopherol, and 0.05 mg/ml ascorbic acid) supplemented with 0.2% Fetal Clone II.<br>
Four days post-plating, and for the remainder of the experiment, the organotypic<br>
cultures were supplied with one of six media formulations. Cultures that had previously<br>
received base media supplemented with 0.2% Fetal Clone II, were supplied with either<br>
base media without Fetal Clone II supplementation, or base media supplemented with<br>
0.2% Fetal Clone II, or base media supplemented with 2% Fetal Clone II. Cultures that<br>
had previously received base media with additional constituents supplemented with 0.2%<br>
Fetal Clone II, were supplied with either base media with additional constituents without<br>
Fetal Clone II supplementation, or base media with additional constituents supplemented<br>
with 0.2% Fetal Clone II, or base media with additional constituents supplemented with<br>
2% Fetal Clone II.<br>
Three criteria were used to evaluate the impact of the media formulations. Visual<br>
inspection was used to determine the extent of contiguous cellular surface coverage.<br>
Impedance meter readings were used to measure the resulting barrier function of cultures.<br>
Viability of tissue post-exposure to 0.1% SDS was used as a practical evaluation of<br><br>
barrier function. For all criteria, organotypic cultures maintained in base media with<br>
additional constituents performed better than base media without additional constituents.<br>
The exclusion of serum did not hinder the performance of organotypic cultures as long as<br>
additional constituents were supplied.<br>
