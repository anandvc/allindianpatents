				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
TRANSMITTING AND RECEIVING APPARATUSES AND<br>
METHODS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a<br>
technical field of wireless communications and more<br>
specifically to apparatuses and methods which transmit and<br>
receive a multimedia-broadcast multicast service (MBMS)<br>
channel.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In next-generation mobile communications systems<br>
in which video and data communications are primarily<br>
conducted, capabilities far surpassing those of the third<br>
generation mobile communications system (IMT-2000) are<br>
called for, necessitating a sufficient realization of<br>
broadband, and increased capacity and speed in<br>
communications. Therefore, various outdoor and indoor<br>
communications surroundings are envisaged. In downlink<br>
data transmissions, not only a unicast scheme, but also<br>
multicast and broadcast schemes are conducted. More<br>
specifically, an increasing importance has been placed on<br>
transmitting an MBMS channel in recent years. The MBMS<br>
channel includes multimedia information broadcast to a<br>
large number of specified or unspecified users, and may<br>
include voice, character, still and video image, and<br>
various other content. (See Non-patent document 1, for<br>
example, for trends in future communications system.)<br>
On the other hand, in a wideband mobile<br>
communications system, effects of frequency-selective<br>
fading due to a multipath environment becomes prominent.<br>
Thus, an orthogonal-frequency division multiplexing<br>
(OFDM) scheme holds promise as a next-generation<br>
communications scheme. In the OFDM scheme, a guard interval<br>
portion is appended to an effective symbol portion<br>
including information to be transmitted to form a symbol,<br><br>
a plurality of which symbols are transmitted during a<br>
predetermined transmission time interval (TTI). Portions<br>
of information included in the effective symbol portion<br>
make up the guard interval portion. The guard interval<br>
portion is also called a cyclic prefix (CP) or an overhead.<br>
On the other hand, unlike the unicast channel, the<br>
MBMS channel of the same contents is transmitted from<br>
multiple cells. In principle, the unicast channel is<br>
transmitted to a specified user from one cell.<br>
In "Area 1", as shown in FIG. 1, which includes<br>
three base stations BS1, BS2, and BS3, the same MBMS channel<br>
is transmitted. Such an area as described above may be<br>
called a MBMS area. Similarly, in "Area 2", which includes<br>
three base stations BSll, BS12, and BS13, the same MBMS<br>
channel is transmitted. The MBMS channels transmitted in<br>
Area 1 and Area 2, which are generally different, may be<br>
the same intentionally or accidentally. A mobile terminal<br>
(more generally, user equipment (UE), which includes<br>
mobile and fixed terminals) receives the MBMS channel of<br>
the same contents, which is transmitted from multiple cells.<br>
The received MBMS channel forms a large number of incoming<br>
waves or paths depending on the length of a radio<br>
propagation path. If the delay difference of the incoming<br>
waves falls within the range of the guard interval due to<br>
the characteristics of the OFDM symbol, the multiple<br>
incoming waves as described above may be combined without<br>
intersymbol interference (soft-combined), making it<br>
possible to improve the receive quality as a result of<br>
path-diversity effects. Therefore, a guard-interval<br>
length for the MBMS channel is set longer than a<br>
guard-interval length for the unicast channel.<br>
Now, when a unicast channel is to be transmitted<br>
to a certain user apparatus, a cell-specific scrambling<br>
code is used for pilot, control, and unicast channels.<br>
Based on the received pilot channel, a user apparatus<br>
performs channel estimation and other processes, channel<br>
compensation for the control and unicast channels, and the<br><br>
subsequent modulating. A scrambling code, which differs<br>
from cell to cell, may be used to distinguish, from an<br>
interference signal from another cell, a desired signal.<br>
However, if the unicast channel is merely replaced by the<br>
MBMS channel (if the scrambling code which differs from<br>
cell to cell is used for transmitting the MBMS channel),<br>
the user apparatus has to perform the process as described<br>
above while identifying a signal from a surrounding base<br>
station (specifically, a pilot channel), which is<br>
difficult. From such a point of view as described above,<br>
it has been proposed to separately provide, for the MBMS,<br>
a scrambling code which is common to multiple cells<br>
included in the MBMS area (a common scrambling code). More<br>
specifically, a cell-specific scrambled code-multiplied<br>
pilot channel (a specific pilot channel), and a pilot<br>
channel which is common to multiple cells within a MBMS<br>
area (a common pilot channel) are provided, with the<br>
specific pilot channel being used for channel compensating<br>
a unicast channel, and the common pilot channel for channel<br>
compensating an MBMS channel.<br>
Non-patent document 1: Otsu, "A challenge for<br>
systems beyond IMT-2000 - a wireless approach", ITU Journal,<br>
Vol.33, No.3, pp.26-30, Mar.2003<br>
As described above, for the MBMS channel, the same<br>
MBMS channel, which is transmitted from cells varying in<br>
distance from a user apparatus, are combined, so that the<br>
delay spread and the fluctuation in the frequency domain<br>
becomes larger than the same for the unicast channel. Thus,<br>
the channel estimation accuracy in the MBMS channel may<br>
deteriorate relative to the same for the unicast channel.<br>
Moreover, unlike the unicast channel, the MBMS<br>
channel is transmitted to all user apparatuses using the<br>
same MCS (modulation and channel coding scheme), so that<br>
the MCS must be set to the worst user envisaged. For example,<br>
when a user apparatus is moving at high speed, the<br>
communications environment becomes worse. However,<br>
consideration must be given to ensure that the MBMS channel<br><br>
meets a required quality level even in such an environment<br>
as described above.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[Problem(s) to be solved by the Invention]<br>
The present invention is for overcoming at least<br>
one of the problems as described above, and aims to provide<br>

time-division multiplexes, in the same frequency band, a<br>
unicast frame which includes the unicast channel, and an<br>
MBMS frame which includes the MBMS channel, and wherein<br>
an insertion density of the common pilot channel included<br>
in the MBMS frame is larger than an insertion density of<br>
the specific pilot channel included in the unicast frame.<br>

[Best Mode of Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
A transmitting apparatus according to an<br>
embodiment of the invention includes a multiplexing unit<br>
which multiplexes a unicast channel, an MBMS channel, a<br><br>
specific pilot channel which is specific to a specified<br>
cell, and a common pilot channel which is common to multiple<br>
cells, and creates a transmit symbol. The multiplexing unit<br>
time-division multiplexes, in the same frequency band, a<br>
unicast frame which includes the unicast channel and an<br>
MBMS frame which includes the MBMS channel. The insertion<br>
density of the common pilot channel included in the MBMS<br>
frame is larger than the insertion density of the specific<br>
pilot channel included in the unicast channel.<br>
In this case, the channel fluctuation tolerance<br>
in the time domain is stronger the larger the insertion<br>
density of the pilot channel in the time domain and weaker<br>
the smaller the insertion density of the pilot channel in<br>
the time domain. Also, the channel fluctuation tolerance<br>
in the frequency domain is stronger the larger the<br>
insertion density in the frequency domain and weaker the<br>
smaller the insertion density in the frequency domain.<br>
In particular, from the point of view of<br>
increasing the channel fluctuation tolerance in the<br>
frequency domain, a common pilot channel may be mapped to<br>
at least one time slot for any sub-carrier. Moreover, at<br>
least a portion of a sub-carrier into which a common pilot<br>
channel is inserted in one time slot may differ from a<br>
sub-carrier into which a common pilot channel is inserted<br>
in another time slot.<br>
Further, in particular, from the point of view<br>
of increasing the channel fluctuation tolerance in the time<br>
domain, a common pilot channel may be mapped to multiple<br>
time slots belonging to a sub-carrier. Moreover, at least<br>
one common pilot channel may be mapped for any time slot.<br>
Moreover, the smaller the insertion density,<br>
lower the channel coding rate for channel coding used to<br>
transmit the same information-rate data, increasing the<br>
coding gain, thereby making it possible to improve the<br>
receive quality of the MBMS channel.<br>
From the point of view of achieving uniformity<br>
in channel estimation accuracy, the common pilot channel<br><br>
may be mapped in equal frequency intervals. Moreover, the<br>
common pilot channel may be distributed uniformly within<br>
an MBMS frame taking up a predetermined band and a<br>
predetermined period.<br>
From the point of view that a CQI for the unicast<br>
channel is measured even in a transmission period of the<br>
MBMS frame, a specific pilot channel in addition to the<br>
common pilot channel may be mapped to the MBMS frame.<br>
From the point of view that the CQI is measured<br>
at a user apparatus without distinguishing the unicast<br>
frame from the MBMS frame, at least a portion of a specific<br>
pilot channel that is inserted into an MBMS frame may be<br>
inserted into a sub-carrier which is the same sub-carrier<br>
as a specific pilot channel which is inserted into a unicast<br>
frame.<br>
From the point of view of increasing the<br>
receive-quality measuring accuracy while maintaining a<br>
battery-saving effect, a portion of a specific pilot<br>
channel that is inserted into an MBMS frame may be inserted<br>
into the same sub-carrier as a specific pilot channel which<br>
is inserted into a unicast frame, and another specific<br>
pilot channel may also be inserted into at least one time<br>
slot into which the portion of the specific pilot channel<br>
is inserted.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, a<br>
receiving apparatus for use with an OFDM communications<br>
system is used. The receiving apparatus includes a unit<br>
which determines a first type of channel estimation value<br>
for each of at least one sub-carrier into which a specified<br>
pilot channel is inserted; a unit which determines a second<br>
type of channel estimation value for each of at least one<br>
sub-carrier into which a common pilot channel is inserted;<br>
and a unit which derives a non-desired signal component<br>
from the difference between a channel estimation value for<br>
a sub-carrier that is derived from one or more first type<br>
of channel estimation values, and a second type of channel<br>
estimation value for the sub-carrier, and derives a channel<br><br>
quality indicator (CQI) for the sub-carrier.<br>
From the point of view of having the same<br>
locations and proportions for the specific-pilot channel<br>
taken up in a unicast frame and in a MBMS frame, the channel<br>
estimation value for the sub-carrier that is derived from<br>
the one or more first type of channel estimation values<br>
may be derived from the average value of multiple first<br>
type channel estimation values for different<br>
sub-carriers.<br>
From the point of view of improving the accuracy<br>
of measuring the CQI, the non-desired signal component may<br>
be derived from the difference between a first type of<br>
channel estimation value and a second type of channel<br>
estimation value for the same sub-carrier.<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
In the embodiment below, while a system is<br>
explained which adopts the orthogonal frequency<br>
divisional multiplexing (OFDM) scheme for downlink, the<br>
present invention may be applied to other multi-carrier<br>
systems.<br>
FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram of a<br>
transmitter according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. While the transmitter is typically provided at<br>
a base station, as in the present embodiment, it may be<br>
provided at another apparatus. FIG.2, which illustrates<br>
the transmitter, shows an MBMS processor 11, a unicast<br>
channel processor 12, an MCS setting section 13, a control<br>
channel processor 19, a first multiplexer 14, a<br>
serial/parallel converter (S/P) 15, a second multiplexer<br>
(MUX) 16, an inverse fast Fourier transformer (IFFT) 17,<br>
a guard interval inserter 18, a radio-parameter setting<br>
section 20, a scrambling code multiplier 21, 22, and<br>
repeating sections 23, 24. The MBMS processor 11 includes<br>
an encoder 111, a data modulator 112, an interleaver 113,<br>
and a scrambling code multiplier 114. The unicast channel<br>
processor 12 includes an encoder 121, a data modulator 122,<br>
an interleaver 123, and a scrambling code multiplier 124.<br><br>
The control channel processor 19 includes an encoder 191,<br>
a data modulator 192, an interleaver 193, and a scrambling<br>
code multiplier 194.<br>
The MBMS processor 11 performs processing<br>
related to multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS) .<br>
An MBMS channel includes multimedia information broadcast<br>
to a large number of specified or unspecified users, and<br>
may include voice, character, still and video image, and<br>
various other contents.<br>
The encoder 111 performs channel coding in order<br>
to increase the error tolerance of the MBMS channel. Coding<br>
may be performed using various schemes such as<br>
convolutional coding and Turbo coding that are well known<br>
in the art. The data modulator 112 data modulates the MBMS<br>
channel using any appropriate modulation scheme such as<br>
QPSK, 16QAM, or 64QAM. The channel coding rate and/or<br>
modulation scheme may be fixed, and/or changed according<br>
to instructions from the MCS setting section 13. Unlike<br>
the unicast channel, the MBMS channel is not optimally set<br>
for each individual user, but is set such that the MCS<br>
therefor is determined such that all users can receive at<br>
a predetermined quality (such that even a fast-moving user<br>
apparatus can receive properly).<br>
The interleaver 113 rearranges the sequential<br>
order of data included in the MBMS channel according to<br>
a predetermined pattern.<br>
The scrambling-code multiplier 114 multiplies a<br>
scrambling code. In the present embodiment/ a scrambling<br>
code which is common to multiple cells belonging to the<br>
same MBMS area is multiplied. As described above, in the<br>
present embodiment, a scrambling code which differs from<br>
one cell to another is provided for a unicast channel, and<br>
a different scrambling code which is common to multiple<br>
cells in an MBMS area is provided for an MBMS channel.<br>
The unicast channel processor 12 performs<br>
processing related to a channel for a specified (typically<br>
one) user.<br><br>
The encoder 121 performs coding in order to<br>
increase the error tolerance of the unicast channel. Coding<br>
may be performed using various schemes such as<br>
convolutional coding and Turbo coding that are well known<br>
in the art. In the present embodiment, AMC (adaptive<br>
modulation and coding) control is performed with respect<br>
to the unicast channel, with the channel coding rate being<br>
changed adaptively according to instructions from the MCS<br>
setting section 13.<br>
The data modulator 122 data modulates the unicast<br>
channel using any appropriate modulation scheme such as<br>
QPSK, 16QAM, or 64QAM. In the present embodiment, AMC<br>
control is performed with respect to the unicast channel,<br>
with the modulation scheme being changed adaptively<br>
according to instructions from the MCS setting section 13.<br>
The interleaver 123 rearranges the sequential<br>
order of data included in the unicast channel according<br>
to a predetermined pattern.<br>
The scrambling code multiplier 124 multiplies a<br>
scrambling code. The scrambling code varies from one cell<br>
to another.<br>
The control channel processor 19 performs<br>
processing related to a control channel for a specified<br>
(typically one) user.<br>
The encoder 191 performs coding for increasing<br>
the error tolerance of the control channel. Coding may be<br>
performed using various schemes such as convolutional<br>
coding and Turbo coding that are well known in the art.<br>
The data modulator 192 data modulates the control<br>
channel using any appropriate modulation scheme such as<br>
QPSK, 16QAM, or 64QAM. With respect to the control channel,<br>
the demand for high-speed transmission is not strong, but<br>
rather the demand for reliability is strong, therefore the<br>
AMC control is not performed in the present embodiment.<br>
The interleaver 193 rearranges the sequential<br>
order of data included in the control channel according<br>
to a predetermined pattern.<br><br>
The scrambling code multiplier 194 multiplies a<br>
scrambling code which differs from one cell to another.<br>
The MCS setting section 13 instructs each<br>
processing element to change, as required, a combination<br>
of a modulation scheme and an coding rate that is used for<br>
the MBMS channel, and a combination of a modulation scheme<br>
and an coding rate that is used for the unicast channel.<br>
The combination of the modulation scheme and the coding<br>
rate is specified by a number (an MCS number) , which<br>
indicates what the combination is.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates exemplary combinations of<br>
data modulation schemes and channel coding rates . As shown,<br>
relative information rates are shown, which are<br>
successively assigned MCS numbers in ascending order<br>
thereof. The AMC control is designed to adaptively change<br>
either or both of the modulation scheme and the coding rate<br>
according to how good the channel condition is to achieve<br>
a quality required at the receiver. How good the channel<br>
condition is may be evaluated by a received quality (a<br>
received SIR) of a downlink pilot channel. Performing the<br>
AMC control makes it possible to improve reliability with<br>
respect to a user with a worse channel condition to achieve<br>
a required quality and to improve throughput while<br>
maintaining a required quality with respect to a user with<br>
a better channel condition.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, the first multiplexer 14 in<br>
FIG. 2 time-division multiplexes the MBMS and unicast<br>
channels in the same frequency band.<br>
The serial-to-parallel (S/P) converter 15<br>
converts a serial signal sequence (stream) to a parallel<br>
signal sequence. The number of parallel signal sequences<br>
may be determined in accordance with the number of<br>
sub-carriers.<br>
The second multiplexer (MUX) 16 multiplexes<br>
multiple data sequences which represent an output signal<br>
from the first multiplexer 14 and the pilot and/or<br>
broadcast channels. The multiplexing may be performed by<br><br>
any one scheme of time multiplexing, frequency<br>
multiplexing, or time and frequency multiplexing.<br>
Examples of mapping common pilot channels to MBMS channels<br>
are explained in detail with reference to FIGS. 5A to 5H.<br>
The inverse fast Fourier transformer (IFFT) 17<br>
inverse fast Fourier transforms a signal input thereto,<br>
and modulates the signal using OFDM.<br>
The guard interval inserter 18 appends a guard<br>
interval (portion) to an OFDM-modulated symbol to create<br>
a transmit symbol. As is well known, a series of data<br>
including head data of a symbol to be transmitted is<br>
replicated to create the guard interval, which is appended<br>
to the tail thereof to create a transmit symbol.<br>
Alternatively, a series of data including tail data of a<br>
symbol to be transmitted is replicated to create the guard<br>
interval, which is appended to the head thereof to create<br>
a transmit symbol.<br>
The radio-parameter setting section 20 sets<br>
radio parameters used in communications. The radio<br>
parameter (group), which includes information specifying<br>
the format of an OFDM symbol, may include a group of<br>
information items specifying values such as a guard<br>
interval period TGi, an effective symbol period, a<br>
proportion of one symbol that is taken up by the guard<br>
interval, and sub-carrier interval Delta f. The effective<br>
symbol period is equal to the inverse of the sub-carrier<br>
interval, or 1/Delta f.<br>
The radio-parameter setting section 20 sets<br>
appropriate radio parameter groups according to the<br>
communications condition or in response to instructions<br>
from other apparatuses. The radio-parameter setting<br>
section 20 may make proper use of the radio parameter groups<br>
to be used, according to whether what is transmitted is<br>
a unicast channel or an MBMS channel. For example, a radio<br>
parameter group specifying a shorter guard interval may<br>
be used for the unicast channel, while a radio parameter<br>
group specifying a longer guard interval may be used for<br><br>
the MBMS channel. The radio-parameter setting section 20<br>
may compute and derive an appropriate radio parameter group<br>
each time, or multiple sets of radio parameter groups may<br>
be stored in a memory in advance, whereby a set out of these<br>
sets may be selected as needed.<br>
The scrambling-code multiplier 21 multiplies a<br>
scrambling code to a pilot channel input thereto, and<br>
generates a specific pilot channel. The scrambling code<br>
as described above is a scrambling code which is specific<br>
to a cell such that it differs from one cell to another<br>
cell (a specific scrambling code).<br>
The scrambling code multiplier 22 multiplies a<br>
scrambling code to a pilot channel input thereto, and<br>
generates a common pilot channel. The scrambling code as<br>
described above is a scrambling code which is common to<br>
multiple cells (a common scrambling code). The pilot<br>
channels input to the scrambling multipliers 21, 22 may<br>
be the same or different.<br>
The repeating sections 23, 24 replicate data<br>
input thereto and output the data. The number of<br>
replications may be changed as needed. In the present<br>
embodiment, the number of replications for the common pilot<br>
channel is set larger than the number of replications for<br>
the specific pilot channel.<br>
The MBMS channel input to the MBMS processor and<br>
the unicast channel input to the unicast channel processor<br>
in FIG. 2 are channel coded and data modulated in<br>
appropriate coding rate and modulation scheme which are<br>
designated by the individual MCS number, and are,<br>
respectively, time-multiplexed after interleaving. Time<br>
multiplexing may be performed in various units of time,<br>
for example in units of radio frames, or in units of<br>
subframes which make up a radio frame. FIG. 4 is an example<br>
illustrating time-multiplexing in units of subframes. One<br>
subframe includes multiple OFDM symbols. As an example,<br>
a subframe may be equal to a transmission time interval<br>
(TTI) such as 0.5ms, for example. Alternatively, time<br><br>
multiplexing may be performed not in units of subframes,<br>
but in units of radio frames, such as 10ms, for example.<br>
These numerical value examples are merely exemplary, thus,<br>
time multiplexing may be performed in units of various time<br>
periods. An identifier such as a subframe or a radio frame<br>
is for convenience only, merely representing an amount<br>
indicating some unit of time. For convenience of<br>
explanation, a subframe in which a unicast channel is<br>
transmitted is referred to as a unicast frame, while a<br>
subframe in which an MBMS channel is transmitted is<br>
referred to as an MBMS frame.<br>
The time-multiplexed channels are multiplexed<br>
with the pilot channels, after which the multiplexed<br>
channels are inverse fast Fourier transformed and<br>
OFDM-modulated. The modulated symbol is appended to a guard<br>
interval to output a baseband OFDM symbol, which is<br>
converted to an analog signal, which is wirelessly<br>
transmitted via a transmitting antenna.<br>
FIGS. 5A-5H show various specific examples of<br>
mapping common pilot channels to MBMS frames. For brevity<br>
of illustration, other channels such as the control channel,<br>
etc., are not shown in FIGS. 5A-5H. Such MBMS frames as<br>
described above are time-multiplexed with the unicast<br>
frame to form a radio frame, which is transmitted from each<br>
base station to a mobile station. An MBMS frame includes<br>
multiple time slots; as shown the MBMS frame (one subframe)<br>
includes six time slots (six OFDM symbols) . In the<br>
explanation below, Ns represents the number of time slots<br>
into which the common pilot channels are inserted. Delta<br>
f expresses, in number of OFDM symbols, an insertion<br>
interval (a frequency interval) of the common pilot channel<br>
in the frequency domain. The numerical value examples are<br>
merely exemplary, thus, any appropriate numerical value<br>
may be used. For convenience of illustration, one OFDM<br>
symbol is shown as being all taken up by pilot channels,<br>
which is not essential to the present invention.<br>
Information representing one pilot channel may be mapped<br><br>
to a portion of an OFDM symbol, or to multiple OFDM symbols,<br>
according to the symbol length, the bandwidth taken up by<br>
the symbol, and the amount of pilot channel information.<br>
This may apply not only to the common pilot channel, but<br>
also to the specific pilot channel.<br>
In general, the stronger the channel fluctuation<br>
tolerance in the time domain the larger the Ns while the<br>
weaker the tolerance the smaller the Ns. The stronger the<br>
channel fluctuation tolerance in the frequency domain the<br>
smaller the Delta f while the weaker the tolerance the<br>
larger the Delta f. From the point of view of improving<br>
the channel estimation accuracy and the receive quality<br>
for the pilot channel, it is desirable to increase the<br>
number of pilot channels, which causes a proportion of a<br>
pilot channel within the MBMS frame (an overhead: OH) to<br>
become large. In other words, from the point of view of<br>
data transmission efficiency, it is desirable for the<br>
number of insertions of the pilot channel to be smaller.<br>
Thus, in the actual system, it is desirable to<br>
appropriately map the pilot channel taking into account<br>
such tradeoff as described above.<br>
In an example shown in FIG. 5A, Ns=2, Delta f=2,<br>
and OH=16.7%. In the example shown, common pilot channels<br>
are mapped in second and fifth time slots in narrow<br>
frequency intervals. Moreover, common pilot channels are<br>
inserted into the second and fifth time slots such that<br>
they alternately intertwine on the frequency axis, so that<br>
the common pilot channels are inserted into all<br>
sub-carriers as a whole MBMS frame. Therefore, the<br>
illustrated example is desired from the point of view of<br>
increasing the tolerance in fluctuation in the frequency<br>
domain.<br>
In an example shown in FIG. 5B, Ns=2, Delta f=3,<br>
and 0H=11.1% . While a large number of common pilot channels<br>
are inserted in the frequency domain in the present example<br>
shown, as in the case of FIG. 5A, the frequency interval<br>
of the common pilot channel is relatively larger. Thus,<br><br>
the number of common pilot channels inserted into the MBMS<br>
frame is smaller. The present example shown is desirable<br>
from the point of view of decreasing overhead while keeping<br>
the tolerance to fluctuation in the frequency domain<br>
relatively high.<br>
In an example shown in FIG. 5C, Ns=3, Delta f=3,<br>
and OH=16.7%. In the present example shown, the common<br>
pilot channels are inserted into all sub-carriers as a<br>
whole MBMS frame, as in the case of FIG. 5A. Compared to<br>
the case in FIG. 5A, the frequency interval of the common<br>
pilot channel is larger, but the number of time slots into<br>
which the common pilot channel is inserted is longer.<br>
Therefore, the illustrated example is desirable from the<br>
point of view of increasing the tolerance in fluctuation<br>
not only in the frequency domain, but also in the time<br>
domain.<br>
In an example shown in FIG. 5D, Ns=3, Delta f=4,<br>
and 0H=12 . 5% . While a large number of common pilot channels<br>
are inserted in the frequency domain in the present example<br>
shown, as in the case of FIG. 5C, the frequency interval<br>
of the common pilot channel is relatively larger. Thus,<br>
the number of common pilot channels inserted into the MBMS<br>
frame is smaller. The present example shown is desirable<br>
from the point of view of decreasing overhead while keeping<br>
the tolerance to fluctuation in the time and frequency<br>
domains relatively high.<br>
In an example shown in FIG. 5E, Ns=4, Delta f=4,<br>
and 0H=16. 7% . Compared to the case in FIG. 5D, the frequency<br>
interval of the common pilot channel is about the same,<br>
but the number of time slots into which the common pilot<br>
channel is inserted is larger. Therefore, the illustrated<br>
example is desirable from the point of view of increasing<br>
the tolerance in fluctuation in the frequency and time<br>
domains.<br>
In an example shown in FIG. 5F, Ns=4, Delta f=6,<br>
and 0H=11.1%. While common pilot channels are inserted in<br>
a large number of time slots in the present example shown,<br><br>
as in the case of FIG. 5E, the frequency interval of the<br>
common pilot channel is relatively larger. Thus, the number<br>
of common pilot channels inserted into the MBMS frame is<br>
smaller. The present example shown is desirable from the<br>
point of view of decreasing overhead while keeping the<br>
tolerance to fluctuation in the time and frequency domains<br>
relatively high.<br>
In an example shown in FIG. 5G, Ns=6, Delta f=5,<br>
and OH=20.0%. In the present example shown, while the<br>
frequency interval of the common pilot channel is<br>
relatively large, the common pilot channel is inserted into<br>
all time slots. Therefore, the present example shown is<br>
desirable especially from the point of view of increasing<br>
the tolerance to fluctuation in the time domain while<br>
maintaining the tolerance to fluctuation in the frequency<br>
domain to some extent.<br>
In an example shown in FIG. 5H, Ns=6, Delta f=6,<br>
and OH=16.7%. While common pilot channels are inserted in<br>
all time slots in the present example shown, as in the case<br>
of FIG. 5G, the frequency interval of the common pilot<br>
channel is relatively larger. Thus, the number of common<br>
pilot channels inserted into the MBMS frame is smaller.<br>
The present example shown is desirable from the point of<br>
view of decreasing overhead while keeping the tolerance<br>
to fluctuation in the frequency domain relatively high and<br>
the tolerance to fluctuation in the time domain especially<br>
high.<br>
In the mapping examples as shown in FIGS. 5C, 5D,<br>
5E, and 5H, common pilot channels are distributed<br>
relatively uniformly within the MBMS frame. Thus, the<br>
examples as described above are desirable from the point<br>
of view of achieving uniformity in the interpolation<br>
accuracy of the channel estimation values.<br>
Embodiment 2<br>
As described above, the unicast and MBMS frames<br>
are time-division multiplex transmitted, with the unicast<br>
channel channel-compensated using a specific pilot<br><br>
channel included in the unicast frame and the MBMS channel<br>
channel-compensated using a common pilot channel included<br>
in the MBMS frame. Thus, with respect to the objective of<br>
channel compensating the MBMS channel, the specific pilot<br>
channel does not have to be inserted into the MBMS frame.<br>
On the other hand, a user apparatus measures the<br>
downlink receive quality in predetermined periods (CQI<br>
measurement periods), and reports the measured value to<br>
the base station. The receive quality may be expressed in<br>
various channel quality indicators (CQI) including SNR,<br>
SIR, and SINR. The base station schedules (allocate<br>
wireless resources to, determine modulation scheme and<br>
channel coding rate, and determine transmit power) a<br>
unicast channel to be transmitted next based on the CQI<br>
measurement value. Thus, a specific pilot channel for a<br>
unicast channel should be inserted into a downlink channel<br>
according to at least the CQI measurement frequency. The<br>
CQI measurement period may be not more than a subframe (one<br>
unicast frame) for a minimum. From such points of view,<br>
it is desirable that the specific pilot channel is inserted<br>
into the MBMS channel as well.<br>
It is not appropriate to use the common pilot<br>
channel already inserted into the MBMS frame to measure<br>
the CQI, and schedule the unicast channel using the CQI<br>
measurement value thereof. The reason is that, as it is<br>
not possible to distinguish cells using only the common<br>
pilot cell which is common to multiple cells, it is<br>
difficult to evaluate, from the receive quality thereof,<br>
the downlink channel state at each specific cell.<br>
In principle, the position at which the specific<br>
pilot channel is inserted within the MBMS frame may be<br>
anywhere as long as it is at the user apparatus and known.<br>
However, when the inserting positions of the specific pilot<br>
channel for the unicast and MBMS channels are entirely<br>
different, the user apparatus must confirm the frame<br>
configuration difference, possibly leading to a complex<br>
CQI measurement process. In view of such points as<br><br>
described above, it is desirable to align the inserting<br>
positions of the specific pilot channel for the MBMS frame<br>
and the unicast channel.<br>
In the example as shown in FIG. 6A, three specific<br>
pilot channels are inserted into the head time slot for<br>
the MBMS frame as for the unicast frame. In this way, the<br>
user apparatus may extract a specific pilot channel from<br>
the head time slot within the frame and perform the CQI<br>
measurement without being aware of the frame being the<br>
unicast frame or the MBMS frame. This is advantageous also<br>
from the point of view of power saving of the user apparatus,<br>
and is especially advantageous for a user apparatus which<br>
operates in an intermittent reception mode or a DRX<br>
(discontinuous transmission) mode.<br>
In an example as shown in FIG. 6B, in addition<br>
to three specific pilot channels being inserted into the<br>
head time slot for the MBMS frame as for the unicast frame,<br>
two further specific pilot channels (additional specific<br>
pilot channels) are being inserted into the head time slot.<br>
As the inserting frequency of the specific pilot channel<br>
is large, this is desirable from the point of view of<br>
improving the receive-quality measurement accuracy of the<br>
specific pilot channel for the MBMS frame. Moreover, as<br>
the additional specific pilot channels are inserted into<br>
only the head time slot, the user apparatus may perform<br>
the CQI measurement process only for the head time slot<br>
as in the case of FIG, 6A. In other words, for the example<br>
in FIG. 6B, in addition to the fact that a battery-saving<br>
effect may be expected at the same level as in the case<br>
of FIG, 6A, a receive-signal quality measurement value<br>
which is more accurate than that for the example in FIG.<br>
6A may be expected.<br>
In order to multiplex the L1/L2 control channel<br>
to the MBMS frame, it is necessary to insert a cell-specific<br>
pilot channel (a specific pilot channel) into the MBMS<br>
frame. From the points of view as described above, L1/L2<br>
control channels and specific pilot channel are<br><br>
multiplexed to the MBMS frame in FIG. 6B.<br>
For convenience of explanation, while the<br>
specific and the additional specific pilot channels are<br>
inserted into the head time slot within the frame, they<br>
may be inserted into a different time slot. At least a<br>
portion of the specific pilot channels inserted into the<br>
MBMS frame may be inserted into the same time slot number<br>
and the same frequency (sub-carrier) as the specific pilot<br>
channel within the unicast frame. The additional specific<br>
pilot channel may further be inserted into the time slot.<br>
From the point of view of quickly proceeding with the<br>
demodulation process after receiving the pilot channel,<br>
it is desirable to have the specific and additional<br>
specific pilot channels concentrated in the head time slot.<br>
Embodiment 3<br>
FIG. 7 is a schematic block diagram of a receiver<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. Such<br>
a receiver as described above is typically provided at a<br>
user apparatus such as a mobile station. FIG. 7 illustrates<br>
a receiver, including a symbol timing detector 520, a guard<br>
interval (GI) remover 522, a fast Fourier transformer 524,<br>
a demultiplexer 526, a channel estimator 528, a channel<br>
compensator 530, a parallel/serial (P/S) converter 532,<br>
a channel compensator 534, a deinterleaver 536, a turbo<br>
decoder 538, a Viterbi decoder 540, and a radio-parameter<br>
setting section 542.<br>
The symbol timing detector 520 detects a symbol<br>
(symbol boundary) timing based on a received signal. The<br>
received signal is a signal after undergoing reception,<br>
amplification, frequency conversion, bandwidth limiting,<br>
orthogonal demodulation, and conversion-to-digital<br>
processes.<br>
The GI remover 522 removes, from the received<br>
signal, a portion corresponding to the GI.<br>
The fast Fourier transformer 524 fast Fourier<br>
transforms a signal input thereto, and demodulates the<br>
signal using OFDM.<br><br>
The demultiplexer 526 separates pilot, control,<br>
and data channels multiplexed in the received signal. The<br>
separation is performed such that it corresponds to<br>
multiplexing at the transmitter (processing in the<br>
multiplexer 306 in FIG. 1) . As the unicast and MBMS frames<br>
are time-division multiplex transmitted, unicast and<br>
specific pilot channels are derived in the unicast frame<br>
period, while MBMS and common (and specific) pilot channels<br>
are derived in the MBMS frame period.<br>
The channel estimator 528 estimates the<br>
propagation path condition using a pilot channel and<br>
outputs a control signal for adjusting amplitude and phase<br>
such that channel fluctuation is compensated. The control<br>
signal is output per sub-carrier.<br>
The channel compensator 530 adjusts the<br>
amplitude and phase of the data channel per sub-carrier<br>
according to information from the channel estimator 528.<br>
The parallel-to-serial (P/S) converter 532<br>
converts a parallel signal sequence to a serial signal<br>
sequence.<br>
The channel compensator 534 adjusts the<br>
amplitude and phase of the control channel per sub-carrier<br>
according to information from the channel estimator 528.<br>
The deinterleaver 536 changes the order of<br>
signals in accordance with a predetermined pattern. The<br>
predetermined pattern corresponds to an inverse pattern<br>
of the change performed in the interleaver at the<br>
transmitter (326 in FIG. 1).<br>
The turbo encoder 538 and the Viterbi decoder 540<br>
decode traffic information data and control information<br>
data, respectively.<br>
The radio-parameter setting section 542 sets<br>
radio parameters to be used in communications, in the same<br>
manner as the radio-parameter setting section 320 in FIG.<br>
1. The radio-parameter setting section 542 may compute and<br>
derive an appropriate radio parameter group each time, or<br>
multiple sets of radio parameter groups may be stored in<br><br>
a memory in advance, whereby sets may be accessed as needed.<br>
A signal received with an antenna undergoes<br>
processes within the RF receiver such as amplifying,<br>
frequency-converting, bandwidth-limiting, and orthogonal<br>
demodulating, and then is converted to a digital signal.<br>
A guard-interval removed signal is OFDM demodulated with<br>
the fast Fourier transformer 524. The demodulated signal<br>
is separated, by the demultiplexer 526, into pilot channels<br>
(including common and/or specific pilot channels),<br>
control and data (including unicast and MBMS) channels.<br>
The pilot channel is input to the channel estimator from<br>
which a compensating signal for compensating propagation<br>
path fluctuation is output per sub-carrier. The data<br>
channel is compensated per sub-carrier using the<br>
compensating signal and converted to a serial signal. The<br>
order of the converted signal is changed at the<br>
deinterleaver 536 in a pattern inverse to the change<br>
applied in the interleaver. The signal is then decoded at<br>
the turbo decoder 538. Similarly, the control channel is<br>
also compensated for channel fluctuation using the<br>
compensating signal and, in the Viterbi decoder 540,<br>
decoded. Thereafter, signal processing is performed that<br>
uses reconstructed data and control channels.<br>
FIG. 8 is a first explanatory diagram related to<br>
CQI measurement. The illustrated receive signal<br>
demodulator corresponds to processing elements (the DEMUX<br>
526, the FFT 524, the GI remover 522, and the symbol-timing<br>
detector 520) before the separator (DMUX) in FIG. 7. The<br>
CQI measuring section may correspond to an element in the<br>
channel estimator 528 in FIG. 7.<br>
As described in the second embodiment, a CQI<br>
measurement is performed based on the specific pilot<br>
channel not only in the unicast frame but also in the MBMS<br>
frame.<br>
FIG. 9 is a diagram illustrating how specific<br>
pilot channels are used to measure the CQI. In the example<br>
shown, common and specific pilot and control channels are<br><br>
mapped to the head time slot of the MBMS frame, with the<br>
MBMS channels being mapped to the second time slot and<br>
thereafter (and with the common pilot channels also being<br>
mapped to the fourth time slot) . In the example shown, the<br>
receive signal quality (CQI1) is to be measured for the<br>
i-th sub-carrier . In the example shown, three specific<br>
pilot channels inserted into the (i-6)-th, the i-th, and<br>
the (i+6) -th sub-carriers are used for the CQI measurement.<br>
The CQI may be expressed as a ratio of the desired signal<br>
power to the non desired signal power. The desired signal<br>
power may be derived from a channel estimation value hi<br>
for the sub-carrier i (a signal Si, which is transmitted<br>
for the sub-carrier i is received as hiSi at the receiver) .<br>
An interference power I within the non-desired signal power<br>
is calculated from the equation in FIG. 9 (Equation 1).<br>
The equation is merely an example, thus the<br>
interference power and CQI may be calculated using various<br>
schemes. In the above equation, hi relates to the desired<br>
signal power of the i-th sub-carrier, (hi-6+hi+6) /2 relates<br>
to the desired signal power of the i-th sub-carrier that<br>
is estimated from desired signal powers of other<br>
sub-carriers, and the difference thereof is associated<br>
with the interference power.<br>
When the receive-signal quality for the (i+6)-th<br>
sub-carrier is to be measured, specific pilot channels<br>
inserted into the i-th, (i+6)-th, and (i+12)-th<br>
sub-carriers are used.<br>
In this way, in the example shown in FIG. 9, the<br>
CQI is measured only based on the specific pilot channels.<br>
FIG. 10 is another explanatory diagram related<br>
to the CQI measurement. The corresponding relationship<br>
between a receive signal demodulator and a CQI measuring<br>
section in FIG. 10, and elements in FIG. 7 is the same as<br>
what is explained with reference to FIG. 9.<br>
FIG. 11 is a diagram illustrating how specific<br>
and common pilot channels are used to measure the CQI. For<br>
convenience of explanation, hm represents a channel<br><br>
estimation value related to the m-th sub-carrier that is<br>
estimated with the specific pilot channel, while hn'<br>
represents a channel estimation value related to the n-th<br>
sub-carrier that is estimated with the common pilot channel.<br>
Three channel estimation values are used as in the case<br>
of FIG. 9. In the example shown in FIG, 11, one channel<br>
estimation value hi' with the common pilot channel and two<br>
channel estimation values hi±3 with the specific pilot<br>
channels are used. The desired signal power is derived from<br>
the channel estimation value hi' related to the sub-carrier<br>
i. An interference power I within the non-desired signal<br>
power is calculated from the equation in FIG. 11 (Equation<br>
2) .<br>
The equation is merely an example, thus, the<br>
interference power and CQI may be calculated using various<br>
schemes. In the above equation, hi relates to the desired<br>
signal power of an i-th sub-carrier, (hi-3+hi+3)/2 relates<br>
to the desired signal power of the ith sub-carrier that<br>
is estimated from desired signal powers of other<br>
sub-carriers, and the difference thereof is associated<br>
with the interference power. As hi' is a value derived from<br>
the common pilot channel, the accuracy may be lower than<br>
the value derived from the specific pilot channel. However,<br>
as calculation is performed within a relatively narrow<br>
frequency range, it is easier to follow the fluctuation<br>
in the frequency domain, making it possible to keep the<br>
overall CQI measurement accuracy at or above a certain<br>
level. While channel estimation values hi±6, which are 12<br>
sub-carriers apart are used in FIG. 9, channel estimation<br>
values hi±3, which are only 6 sub-carriers apart with the<br>
same frame configuration are used in FIG. 11. The example<br>
shown in FIG. 11 uses not only the specific pilot channel,<br>
but also the common pilot channel, making it possible to<br>
measure the CQI in a relatively narrow frequency range and<br>
to measure the CQI in the frequency and/or time domain more<br>
precisely than in the case of FIG. 9.<br>
FIG. 12 shows how specific and common pilot<br><br>
channels are used to measure the CQI in a different manner.<br>
Unlike examples shown in FIGS. 9 and 11, channel estimation<br>
values hi, hi' with specific and common pilot channels<br>
inserted into the same sub-carrier but different time slots<br>
are used in FIG. 12. The desired signal power may be derived<br>
from the channel estimation value hi related to the<br>
sub-carrier i. An interference power I within the<br>
non-desired signal power is calculated from the equation<br>
in FIG. 12 (Equation 3).<br>
The equation is merely an example, thus, the<br>
interference power and CQI may be calculated using various<br>
schemes. The example shown is desirable from the point of<br>
view of appropriately following the temporal channel<br>
fluctuation.<br>
The present invention has been described by<br>
breaking down into a number of embodiments for the<br>
convenience of explanation. However, the breakdown of each<br>
of the embodiments is not essential to the present<br>
invention, so that one or more embodiments may be used as<br>
required.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the<br>
above-described preferred embodiments thereof, so that<br>
various variations and modifications are possible within<br>
the scope of the spirit of the present invention.<br>
The present application claims priority based on<br>
