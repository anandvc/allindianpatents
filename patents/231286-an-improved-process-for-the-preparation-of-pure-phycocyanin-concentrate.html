				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparaion of pure<br>
phycocyanin concentrate. The present invention more particularly relates to an<br>
improved process for the concentration and purification of phycocyanin obtained<br>
from blue-green algae employing aqueous two-phase extractioi&gt;<br>
The practice of coloring food dates back to ancient times and today color has<br>
become a vital constituent of food. In recent years, interest in the use of natural<br>
colorants has increased considerably mainly because of the apparent lack of<br>
toxicity and environmentally more safe. Natural coloring compounds used in food,<br>
cosmetics and molecular genetics industries are products of great commercial<br>
significance.<br>
C-phycocyanin, a blue colored, red fluorescing biliprotein of algae, was first<br>
reported by Lemberg in 1928. C-phycocyanin is present in all the species of<br>
cyanophyceae family (eg;Spirulina sp). C-Phycocyanin comprises of a protein<br>
and chromophore, the protein moiety consists of alpha and beta sub units of<br>
molecular weights in the range of 18000 and 20000 each. Phycocyanin content<br>
varies in the range of 10 to 15% of Spirulina bio-mass, based on the culture<br>
conditions. This colorant is highly stable at pH 5 to 8. Furthermore it exhibits a<br>
strong red fluorescence when the protein is highly concentrated and is in native<br>
form. The maximum absorbance for C-phycocyanin is 620nm and that of total<br>
protein is at 280nm. The food grade C-Phycocyanin purity (defined as the<br>
relationship of absorbance at 620nm to that of 280nm) is of 0.7 and reactive<br>
grade purity above. 3.9 is used in cosmetics and molecular genetics industries.<br>
The production of C- phycocyanin by Spirulina represents a very interesting case<br>
because both the industrial application and commercial value of this product are<br>
considerable C-phycocyanin is presently purified by ammonium sulfate<br>
precipitation, centrifugation, gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography, and<br>
membrane processes. Thus the purification involves many techniques. Methods<br>
for the concentration and purification of phycocyanin from the cell culture and<br>
broth are known in the art. Almost all the methods suffer from the problem of cell<br>
debris and chlorophyll contamination during the processing of phycocyanin.<br>
Subjecting the separated phycocyanin to additional processing steps such as<br>
precipitation, centrifugation, gel filtration, column chromatography leads to<br>
considerable reduction in contaminants. However, scale-up of these methods is<br>
difficult and uneconomical to produce phycocyanin on large scale. Hence there is<br>
a need for an improved process for the concentration and purification of<br>
phycocyanin which has potential for easy scale-up, easy handling of the product,<br>
product with better stability, reduce capital and operational costs as compared to<br>
other processes. Consequently, process problem associated with the scaling up<br>
of the purification can be eliminated to a large extent by using aqueous-twophase<br>
systems.<br>
Aqueous two phase systems (ATPS) has been recognized as a superior and<br>
versatile technique for the downstream processing of biomolecules. The major<br>
advantages of ATPS are high capacity, biocompatible environment, low<br>
interfacial tension, high yields, lower process time and energy, and high<br>
selectivity. Aqueous two phase systems are mainly of two types polymer -<br>
polymer and polymer salt. The physical properties of ATPS, such as density,<br>
viscosity, and interfacial tension, determine the phase separation and also<br>
contribute to the biomolecule partition behavior. Aqueous two-phase systems are<br>
well known for their utility in the extraction and purification of biological materials<br>
such as enzymes/proteins, nucleic acids, viruses, cell organelles etc.<br>
Reference may be made to Anon 1987 Chemical Eng. P-19-22 wherein one of<br>
the commercialized technologies for the production of phycocyanin utilizes gel<br>
filtration as the final purification step to remove the impurities. The drawback is<br>
again utilize chromatographic method which are not commercially feasible for the<br>
production of food colour, moreover these chromatographic purification methods<br>
need one more concentration step and are limited in scale operations by the cost<br>
of the resins.<br>
Reference may be made to a Japanese patent (1979, 79076867) wherein<br>
phycocyanin is stabilized in solutions by the addition of gelatin. The probable<br>
drawback here is stabilization in the form of phycocyanin solution is prone to<br>
microbial attack and oxidative degradation (which is often indicated by<br>
precipitation during storage) since gelatin is neither an antimicrobial or an<br>
antioxidant.<br>
Reference may be made to an improved process for the preparation of<br>
phycocyanin from Spirulina (Manoj et al., 1996, Indian Patent 2504/del/96,<br>
Gazette dated 15/1197) wherein, the Spirulina biomass is homogenized and<br>
phycobiliproteins are released into homogenate. The homogenate is filtered to<br>
separate cell debris from supernatant solution. The separated phycocyanin<br>
solution is then subjected to precipitation in order to obtain phycocyanin in solid<br>
form. The main drawback of this invention is even after centrifugation,<br>
phycocyanin solution is still not free of chlorophyll, cell debris. Also, phycocyanin<br>
needs to be made from the precipitation agent, since it has to be used in<br>
food/pharmaceutical applications.<br>
Reference may be to Wenhui et al., 2001 CN1291616 wherein, separating and<br>
purifying high-purity high-activity phycocyanin includes such steps as preparing<br>
mashed spirulina, extracting, salting out, dialysis, concentrating, sephadex G200,<br>
DEAE, Sephadex G25, SephadexG200 and freeze drying, however, the<br>
drawback of this invention is that it involves many steps and also it is difficult to<br>
scale up the process. Also the presence of buffer salts used during the<br>
purification of phycocyanin makes the product undesirable for<br>
food/pharmaceutical applications.<br>
Reference may be made to Mikiyoshi, 2001 JP190244, A method for producing a<br>
blue coloring matter which is characterized by comprising the following<br>
processes: the first process that the dried powder of spirulina is suspended in<br><br>
water to mix with an ion exchange resin, and a soluble protein containing<br>
phycocyanin to be the blue coloring matter is bound to the ion exchange resin;<br>
the second process that the ion exchange resin bound with the soluble protein is<br>
washed with water using a filter with a mesh enough to hold the above ion<br>
exchange resin; the third process that an aqueous solution showing blue color is<br>
collected through separating the soluble protein from the above ion exchange<br>
resin by using an eluent, the fourth process that the aqueous solution obtained in<br>
the third process is evaporated to dryness to obtain the objective blue coloring<br>
matter as blue powder. This process is difficult to handle large amount of<br>
phycocyanin. Also evaporation of phycocyanin solution at high temperature is not<br>
desirable since phycocyanin is unstable at high temperature.<br>
Reference may be made to Practical application of aqueous two-phase systems<br>
for the development of a prototype process for c-phycocyanin recovery from<br>
Spirulina maxima. J Chem Technol biotechnol 76: 1273-1280. This work deals<br>
about the partitioning of phycocyanin from the cell debirs and achieved a purity of<br>
phycocyanin of 3.8 after ultrafiltration.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for<br>
the separation, extraction, concentration and purification of phycocyanin.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to separate and extract phycocyanin<br>
free from chlorophyll, cell debris and other contaminants to one of the phases<br>
employing aqueous two-phase extraction<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to extract phycocyanin without the<br>
use of precipitating agents.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to obtain a high purity of<br>
phycocyanin in a single step and hence decreasing the other processing steps<br>
involved.Still another object of the present invention is to extract phycocyanin without the use of precipitating agents.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to obtain a high purity of phycocyanin in a single step and hence decreasing the other processing steps involved.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to concentrate the phycocyanin solution using a novel athermal process such as osmotic membrane distillation to remove excess water load during subsequent processing steps such as freeze drying etc.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to facilitate the easy processing of phycocyanin by integrating aqueous two-phase extraction with membrane based separation process such as ultrafiltration and osmotic membrane distillation.<br>
Accordingly, an improved process for the preparaion of pure phycocyanin concentrate which comprises :<br>
a)	harvesting the Spirulina biomass by known method,<br>
b)	washing the said biomass   with plain water by known method for 10-15 minutes,<br>
c)	adding water at a ratio of 1:1 to the said biomass<br>
d)	homogenizing the biomass mechanically for a period of 5-10 minutes at a pressure in the range of 100-400 kg/cm2<br><br>
e)	adjusting the pH of the above obtained homogenized biomass to 4-5 by known methods,<br>
f)	filtering the above obtained biomass and further passing through activated carbon at a flow rate of 50/100 ml/min,<br>
g)	centrifuging the above obtained biomass to obtain phycocyanin solution ,<br>
h)       adding phase forming components selected from       polyethylene glycol<br>
( PEG) 1550, PEG 4000, PEG 6000 and PEG 20,000 at a level of 6-12% (w/w), and salt selected from Potassium phosphate, Ammonium sulfate, Magnesium sulfate, Sodium sulfate, Sodium citrate potassium phosphate at a level of 10-15% (w/w)<br>
i)	mixing above obtained mixture for a period of 1-2hr at 400-600 rpm in a<br>
magnetic stirrer followed by equilibrating using separating funnel for at least 24 h and separating the top phase containing pure phycocyanin having purity in the range of 3.8 to 4.3 using spectrophotometric method at 620/280 nm,<br>
j) filtering the pure phycocyanin solution by ultrafiltration followed by osmotic membrane distillation to obtain pure phycocyanin concentrate at a range of .004% to .014% ,<br>
In an embodiment of the process wherein the harvesting of the biomass may be<br>
carried out by using vibro filter.<br>
In an another embodiment of the process wherein phase forming agent used<br>
may be selected from PEG 4000 and salt selected may be Potasium phosphate.<br>
In the present invention, freshly harvested Spirulina biomass is washed two to<br>
three  times   to   remove   the   culture   media   components.   The   biomass   is<br>
homozinised in a homoziniser at the pressure of 100 - 400 kg/m2 for    10-15<br>
min. Then the solution is filtered using cotton bed filter to remove the chlorophyll<br>
and cell debris and then centrifuged to remove the traces of these contaminants.<br><br>
The phycocyanin obtained is used for the preparation of aqueous two phase<br>
system.<br>
The novelty of the present invention is that higher purity of phycocyanin is<br>
achieved in a single stage and also the phycocyanin gets concentrated in one of<br>
the phases. The contaminants like chlorophyll and cell debris gets settled at the<br>
interface.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention<br>
and should not be constructed to the limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Around 6kg of Spirulina biomass was harvested using conveyor filter and washed<br>
with tap water to remove the culture media components. To the biomass an<br>
equal amount of water was added and then homosinised at the pressure of 100-<br>
400 kg/cm2 for about 10 min. The solution obtained was filtered and centrifuged<br>
at the rate of 50 ml/min using cotton bed filter to remove the chlorophyll and other<br>
impurities and disc type centrifuge at around 12,000 g to remove remaining<br>
traces of these impurities. Phycocyanin obtained was added to 6% w/w PEG and<br>
15% w/w potassium phosphate to which 79% w/w of phycocyanin was added to<br>
have a total of 100%. The mixture was mixed using magnetic stirrer at 500 rpm at<br>
about one hour at room temperature. The mixture was allowed to equilibrate in a<br>
separating funnel for about 24 hrs the top and bottom phase were separated and<br>
the amount and purity of phycocyanin (620/280nm) present in each of the phases<br>
are estimated spectrophotometrically. The top PEG rich phase has a high<br>
amount of phycocyanin and bottom salt rich phase has other protein with residual<br>
impurities settling at interface. The partition coefficient (the ratio of phycocyanin<br>
concentration in top phase to that of the bottom phase) of the phycocyanin was<br>
estimated. The top phase containing phycocyanin was dialyzed against distilled<br>
water and lyophilized.<br>

The main advantages of present invention are:<br>
1. The formation of ATPS considerably reduces the volume of the<br>
phycocyanin that is to be processed for product recovery.<br>
2. Higher concentration of phycocyanin can be achieved since most of it gets<br>
partitioned to the top phase.<br>
3. The trace residual impurities such as chlorophyll, cell debris present get<br>
settled at the interface and hence no contamination of these compounds<br>
occurs.<br>
4. The other proteins get partitioned to the bottom phase.<br>
5. Additional steps for the purification of phycocyanin can be eliminated and<br>
also the process is less tedious.<br>
6. All the operations are carried out at room temperature and hence is more<br>
economical.<br>
7. The process is simple and easy to scale-up<br>
8. Simple and inexpensive steps for the removal of contaminants such as<br>
chlorophyll and cell debris.<br>
9. Substantial reduction in volume of the product, which results in easy<br>
handling of the product for further processing methods like ultrafiltration,<br>
osmotic membrane distillation and dialysis.<br>
10. The final product retains its spectral properties thereby rendering this<br>
product to be used both as the food and reactive grade.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
