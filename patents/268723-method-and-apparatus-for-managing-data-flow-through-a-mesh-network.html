METHOD AND APPRATUS FOR MANAGING DATA FLOW THROUGH A  MESH NETWORK<br>
Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง119<br>
[0001] The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application No. 60/727,642 filed October 17, 2005, and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
BACKGROUND Field<br>
[0002] The disclosure relates to mesh networks. More particularly, the disclosure relates to a method and apparatus for managing data flow through a mesh network.<br>
Background<br>
[0003] In recent years there has been an increase in demand for ubiquitous access to high speed data services. The telecommunication industry has responded to the increase in demand by offering a variety of wireless products and services. In an effort to make these products and services interoperable, the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has promulgated a set of wireless local area network (WLAN) standards, e.g., IEEE 802.11. The products and services that conform to these standards are frequently networked in a wireless point to multipoint configuration. In this configuration, individual wireless devices (e.g., stations) communicate directly with an internet access point. Each of the wireless devices shares the available bandwidth. [0004] A more efficient and resilient network can be realized through the use of a mesh network. A mesh network is a distributed network having multiple wireless mesh points. Each mesh point in the mesh network may act as a repeater receiving traffic, transmit or transport streams (TSs) and relaying the TSs to the next mesh point. A TS proceeds from an originating mesh point to a destination mesh point by "hopping" from mesh point to mesh point. TS routing algorithms ensure that TSs are routed efficiently from the origination mesh point to the destination mesh point. TS routing algorithms may dynamically adapt to changes in the mesh network and make the mesh network more efficient and resilient.   For example, in the event a mesh point is too busy to<br><br><br><br><br>
handle the TS or a mesh point has dropped out of the mesh network, the TS routing algorithm may route the TS to the destination mesh point through other mesh points. [0005] The destination mesh point is frequently a mesh portal. TSs arriving at the portal may be decoded and reformatted for retransmission over other networks, for example, the Internet. A TS originating at a mesh point and traveling toward the mesh portal is referred to as an upstream TS. A TS coming from a mesh portal and traveling toward a destination mesh point is referred to as a downstream TS. A mesh point that is a single hop away from a mesh portal is said to be a mesh point of rank 1. A mesh point that requires at least two hops to reach a mesh portal is said to be a mesh point of rank 2. In general, a mesh point that requires n hops to reach a mesh portal is said to be a mesh point of rank n.<br>
[0006] Large percentages of a mesh network's traffic flows are upstream and downstream TSs. Upstream TSs generally hop from higher ranked mesh points to lower ranked mesh points before departing through a web portal. Downstream TSs generally hop from lower ranked mesh points to higher ranked mesh points. Thus, lower rank mesh points support the traffic flows of higher rank mesh points resulting in more TS congestion around the lower rank mesh points. In general, mesh points of rank 1 are likely to support more upstream and downstream TS than mesh points of rank 2. Similarly, mesh points of rank 2 are likely to support more TS than mesh points of higher ranks (e.g., 3,4, etc.).<br>
[0007] The mesh network topography, in which lower rank mesh points support upstream and downstream traffic flows from higher rank mesh points, often results in TS flow congestion at mesh points near the web portals. Many factors contribute to flow congestion including: neighboring mesh points attempting to access the communication channel medium too frequently; neighboring mesh points transmitting at lower data rates than optimum at the physical access layer; neighboring mesh points transmitting bursts that occasionally exceed the negotiated access throughput; poor radio conditions between the downstream mesh point and the upstream mesh point resulting in a lower than expected throughput.<br>
[0008] It has been recognized by those skilled in the art that apparatuses and methods for reducing mesh congestion and improving data handling at individual mesh points can improve the efficiency and reliability of a mesh network.<br><br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0009] TS may be individually managed by each mesh point. Before receiving a TS, a mesh point receives an admission request having a traffic specification (TSPEC). The mesh point may determine whether there is adequate capacity to admit the TS and accept or deny the admission request. If the admission request is accepted, the mesh point may aggregate data from the TS with data from other TSs. The mesh point may broadcast a request to send messages containing an ordered response sequence. Receiving mesh points may respond in sequence with a clear to send. The mesh point may send the data packets to the receiving mesh points. The receiving mesh point may acknowledge receipt of a block of data packets with a data block acknowledge message depending on the acknowledgement policy dictated during the TS setup. The mesh point may have a power save mode to conserve energy. The mesh point may also select transmit channels to balance mesh loads or to increase mesh throughput. [0010] A method for managing traffic streams (TS) at a mesh point in a mesh network. The method may comprise receiving a data packet, placing data from the data packet in one or more packet queues, aggregating data from the one or more packet queues into a transmit data packet and transmitting the transmit data packet during a transmission opportunity duration.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0024] Methods and systems that implement the aspects of the various features of the disclosure will now be described with reference to the drawings. The drawings and the associated descriptions are provided to illustrate aspects of the disclosure and not to limit the scope of the disclosure. Reference in the specification to "one aspect" or "an aspect" is intended to indicate that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the aspect is included in at least an aspect of the disclosure. The appearances of the phrase "in one embodiment" or "an aspect" in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same aspect. Throughout the drawings, reference numbers are re-used to indicate correspondence between referenced elements. In addition, the first digit of each reference number indicates the figure in which the element first appears.<br>
[0025] FIG. 1 shows an exemplary mesh network 100 according to an aspect. The mesh network 100 may include one or more mesh portals, such as mesh points 102 and 104. Mesh portals are mesh points connected to a wired network, for example, the Internet 106.   Mesh portals may serve as gateways between a wired network and a<br><br>
wireless mesh network. Since mesh portals form gateways in and out of the mesh network 100, they are said to be mesh points having rank 0.<br>
[0026] The mesh network 100 may also have mesh points that are not mesh portals but are capable of communicating directly with one or more mesh portals, for example, mesh points 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116 and 118. These mesh points have rank 1 because it takes one hop for a TS at these mesh points to reach a mesh portal, such as mesh points 102 and 104. Some mesh points, for example, mesh points 120, 122,124, 126, 128 and 130 may not be capable of communicating directly with the mesh portals 102 and 104 but rather communicate with the mesh portals 102 and 104 through another mesh point. These mesh points have rank 2 because it takes at least two hops for a TS at these mesh points to reach a mesh portal, such as mesh points 102 and 104. A TS originating at mesh point 120 may make a first hop to mesh point 108 or mesh point 118 before hopping to mesh point 102, a mesh portal. Other mesh points may not be capable of communicating with a mesh portal 102 or 104 in less than two hops, for example, mesh point 132. A TS originating at mesh point 132 may make a first hop to mesh point 122 before hoping to mesh point 108 or mesh point 118 before hopping to mesh portal 102. Mesh point 132 has rank 3 because it takes at least three hops to reach a mesh portal, such as mesh points 102 and 104. In general, the rank of any mesh point can be determined by calculating the minimum number of hops for a TS originating at the mesh point to reach a mesh portal.<br>
[0027] TSs bound for mesh points of lower rank are said to be upstream traffic flows. TSs bound for mesh points of higher rank are said to be downstream traffic flows. Thus, TSs bound for the mesh portals, for example mesh points 102 and 104, are upstream traffic flows and TSs entering the mesh network 100 at the mesh portals, for example mesh points 102 and 104, are downstream traffic flows. Since much of the traffic in the mesh network 100 is likely to be arriving and departing the mesh network 100 at mesh points 102 and 104, there is an increased likelihood of TS congestion around mesh portals 102 and 104 and other mesh points of low rank. [0028] FIG. 2 shows timing diagrams illustrating contention access at an exemplary mesh point of FIG. 1 according to an aspect. Access to the communication channel may be controlled by assigning mesh points channel at least one access parameter that may include a transmission opportunity (TxOP) duration, a contention window minimum (CWmin), a contention window maximum (CWmax) and an arbitration inter-frame spa<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
(AIFS) time. Mesh points that transmit over the communication channel may contend for access to the communication channel.<br>
[0029] Each of the mesh points may monitor the communication channel and when the communication channel becomes available the transmitting mesh points may idle for a wait time equal to their respective assigned AIFS time. During the AIFS time, the idling mesh points may continue to monitor the communication channel and if the communication channel becomes busy, the mesh points may continue to idle and wait until the communication channel becomes available and then wait another time period equal to their respective assigned AIFS time. When the communication channel has been available for a time period equal to its AIFS time, the mesh points may set a backoff timer. The length of time set on the backoff timer is random. The length of time set on the backoff timer is determined by a number drawn from a uniform distribution between the assigned CWmin and CWmax-<br>
[0030] Three possible outcomes of contention access for an individual mesh point are shown on the three timelines of FIG. 2. The first timeline shows a mesh point successfully contending for access when the communication channel becomes available. The timeline begins with the mesh point monitoring a busy 202 communication channel. While the communication channel is busy 202, the mesh point's transmitter idles. When the channel becomes available the mesh point's transmitter continues to idle for a time period equal to its AIFS time 204. While idling, the mesh point continues to monitor the communication channel. At the end of the AIFS time 204, the mesh point may randomly select a backoff slot by selecting a number from a uniform distribution 205 with a minimum value CWmin 207 and a maximum value CWmax. 209. This selected number is multiplied with the standard defined slot-time (e.g., slot time may be about 9 microseconds) and the result is called the backoff time. The backoff time defines the length of the backoff window 206. The mesh point's transmitter continues to idle and monitor the communication channel until the backoff timer determines that the length of time equal to the backoff window 206 has expired. At the end of the backoff window 206, the mesh point's transmitter has a TxOP 208 during which the mesh point may transmit information to the receiving mesh point. At the end of the TxOP 208, the mesh point's transmitter idles once again and begins to wait the AIFS time, beginning the contention access process once again.<br><br>
 [0031] The second timeline shows another possible outcome of contention access. The outcome may occur when another station begins transmitting during the AIFS time. The timeline may begin with the mesh point monitoring a busy 212 communication channel. When the communication channel becomes available, the mesh point's transmitter may idle and the mesh point may begin to wait a time equal to the AIFS time 214. During the AIFS time 214, another mesh point with a shorter AIFS time may begin transmitting and the communication channel may become busy 216. once again. The mesh point's transmitter may continue to idle with the mesh point waiting for the communication channel to become available again. When the communication channel becomes available, the mesh point may wait another AIFS time 218 before selecting a backoff time defined by a backoff window 220 and starting the backoff window counter.<br>
[0032] The third timeline shows another possible outcome of contention access. The outcome may occur when another station interrupts during the mesh point's backoff window. The timeline may begin with the mesh point monitoring the communication channel while the communication channel is busy 222. The mesh point's transmitter may idle during this time. When the communication channel becomes available, the mesh point's transmitter may continue to idle for a time period equal to the AIFS time 224. While idling, the mesh point may continue to monitor the communication channel. At the end of the AIFS time 224, the mesh point may randomly selects a backoff time by selecting a time from a uniform distribution 205 with a minimum time CWrajn 207 and a maximum time CWmax. 209. The mesh point's transmitter may continue to idle until the back off timer counts a length of time equal to the backoff window 226. While idling, the mesh point may continue to monitor the communication channel. While the backoff counter is counting, another mesh point may begin transmitting and the communication channel may become busy 228. The backoff counter may be stopped. When the communication channel becomes available, the mesh point's transmitter may continue to idle and wait a time period equal to the AIFS time 230. At the end of the AIFS time 230, the backoff counter may begin counting again from the time that it was stopped.<br>
[0033] The transmit frequency and the transmit data rate of a mesh point may be controlled by adjusting the TxOP duration, CWmin, CWmax and AIFS time. A large TxOP duration allows a mesh point to transmit a large amount of data each time the<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
mesh point accesses the receiving mesh point resulting in a large data rate. A small AIFS time relative to neighboring mesh points contending for access to the communication channel increases the probability of access, resulting in a large number of medium access (and hence more TxOPs assuming that the TxOP is constant for each access) and a large data rate. Similarly, a small CWmin and CWmax relative to neighboring mesh points increases the probability of selecting a small backoff time and increasing the probability of access to the receiving mesh point resulting in a large number of TxOPs and a large data rate. Analogously, a small TxOP, a large AIFS time, or a large CWmin, and CWmax may result in a low data rate.<br>
[0034] Quality of Service (QoS) may also be adjusted by controlling the transmit frequency through the access parameters TxOP, CWmin, CWmax and AIFS time. To decrease TS delays, the CWmin, CWmax or AIFS time may be decreased, increasing the probability of successfully accessing the receiving mesh point. To compensate for more frequent access, the TxOP duration may be decreased to free up channel capacity for other mesh points. Decreasing TS delay by increasing successful medium access may come at a cost. Each medium access may have medium access control (MAC) overhead. MAC overhead consumes communication channel bandwidth that may otherwise be available for TSs.<br>
[0035] In the mesh network 100, at least one access parameter may be assigned based on rank, amount of traffic carried, and available rate. Lower rank mesh points may carry more traffic and may be assigned lower AIFS, CWmin, CWmax values as well as larger TxOP durations. A descriptor may be provided with TSs that identifies the average bit rate of the TS and the peak bit rate of the TS. Access parameters may be adjusted to accommodate the average bit rate and the peak bit rate of the TS. The available bit rate between two mesh points at the physical layer may also be used to tune the access parameters. Access parameters may also be adjusted as new flows and mesh points are added to the mesh network 100.<br>
[0036] In another aspect, at least one access parameter may be adjusted based on the rank of the mesh points. The mesh portals may then broadcast these access parameters to neighboring mesh points which in turn broadcast them to their neighboring mesh points until all mesh points have their respective access parameters. Alternatively, the access parameters may be preset by a vendor.<br><br>
 [0037] FIG. 3 shows a portion of the mesh network 100 of FIG. 1 illustrating access control at an exemplary mesh point according to an aspect. Admission control of a TS to a mesh point may be performed by each of the mesh points in the mesh network 100. Each mesh point in the mesh network 100 may broadcast load information in its beacon. For example, mesh point 118 may broadcast its load information Lug 302, mesh point 120 may broadcast its load information L120 304, mesh point 130 may broadcast its load information L130 306, mesh point 122 may broadcast its load information L122 308, and mesh point 102 broadcast its load information L102 310.<br>
[0038] The load information may be used by each of the mesh points for admission control of new TS. For example, mesh point 120 may use Lug 302 to determine whether mesh point 118 may be able to accommodate a new TS. If mesh point 120 determines that mesh point 102 may be able to handle the new TS, it may send an admission request to mesh point 118. Mesh point 118 may determine if there are adequate idle periods in its neighborhood to accommodate a TxOP for the new TS and if so admit the new TS. Otherwise, mesh point 118 may deny the admission request. [0039] Admission control may be controlled by each mesh point in the mesh network 100. Downstream mesh points may negotiate with upstream mesh points for TxOPs for upstream TSs. Upstream mesh points may negotiate with downstream mesh points for TxOPs for downstream TSs. Alternatively, a downstream mesh point may negotiate a TxOPs for both upstream and downstream TSs reserving a large enough TxOP to accommodate the upstream TSs and the downstream TSs.<br>
[0040] FIG. 4 is a block diagram showing data aggregation at an exemplary mesh point 118 in the mesh network 100 of FIG. 1 according to an aspect. Data packets 402 arriving from mesh points 120,130 and 122 may be parsed by mesh point 118 into two or more QoS data types. The data may be parsed into a high QoS and a best available QoS and stored in respective packet queues or locations 404 and 406. Data from arriving data packets 402 may be aggregated in the QoS packet queues 404 and 406. A data packet generator 408 may generate data packets using the data in packet queues 404 and 406 with priority given to the high QoS data stored in packet queue 404. The data packet transmitter 408 may forward the packets to one or more mesh points, hi this example, the data packet transmitter 408 may forward the data packet to mesh point 102.<br><br><br>
[0041] Aggregation of data packets allows more efficient use of the communication medium. The aggregate size should be large enough that many bits may be transmitted for each medium access reducing the required medium access frequency and the associated overhead thereof. The aggregate size may also be small enough that the aggregation delay does not adversely impact the negotiated QoS by incurring an unacceptable TS latency.<br>
[0042] Thus, TS flow control may be performed at any mesh point in the mesh network through access control, the assignment of contention access parameters, and the use of QoS identifiers. The application of backpressure may extend from low rank to high rank mesh points. The backpressure may be applied as explained herein and a mesh point may use an explicit backpressure message directed at a particular mesh point or broadcast backpressure message. The mesh point may command another mesh point to adjust its throughput or its medium access frequency. A backpressure message may be piggybacked or aggregated with other data packets.<br>
[0043] Acknowledgment of receipt of a data packet 402 may be performed using a block acknowledge. When a data block of predetermined length of a particular QoS is received, the mesh point may send a block acknowledge to the transmitting mesh point. For example, mesh point 118 may send block acknowledge messages to mesh points 120, 122 and 130. Packet sequencing may also be performed at the mesh point. For example, mesh point 118 may assign new sequence numbers when data packets are aggregated in the data packet generator 408. The mesh point 118 may hold data packet blocks before forwarding until a complete data packet block is received and any dropped packet from the data packet block is recovered. In this way, data packets being forwarded in the mesh network 100 may be held at each mesh point hop until the complete data packet block is received.<br>
[0044] FIG. 5 shows an exemplary timeline of an M-Request-to-Send (MRTS) message 502 from mesh point 122 to mesh points 118 and 108 followed by M-Clear-To-Send (MCTS) messages 504 and 506 from mesh points 118 and 108, respectively, responding to the MRTS. TS collisions in the mesh network 100 may be minimized by having a transmitting mesh point transmit an RTS message with each potential receiving mesh point respond with a CTS message. Traffic collisions of CTS responses may be minimized by the use of the M extension to the RTS and CTS messages. For example, mesh points 122 may broadcast an RTS message with an M extension that identifies<br><br>
mesh points 118 and 108 and the order in which they should respond to the MCTS message. Mesh points 118 and 108 may respond with an MCTS in the order specified in the MRTS message. The responses may be a broadcast (omni-directional) message or the response may be a directed. A directed message may be steered using beamsteering or multiple input multiple output (MMO) transmission. [0045] The RTS and CTS transmit handshake along with the data block acknowledge may be used to protect data transmissions over the medium. Once a RTS and CTS handshake occurs, other mesh points in the neighborhood may hold off on transmissions that may interfere with links being established between the transmitting mesh point, e.g., mesh point 122, and the receiving mesh point(s), e.g., mesh points 108 and 118. This decreases the probability of collisions due to a hidden mesh point that may be transmitting, but due to shadowing or environmental conditions, may not be heard by mesh point 122. The RTS and CTS transmit handshake with a block acknowledges may also be implemented in an MRTS and MCTS message structure. [0046] After transmitting data blocks to a receiving mesh point, the transmitting mesh point, e.g., mesh point 122, may make a reverse direction grant allowing the receiving mesh point(s), e.g., mesh points 108 and 118, to transmit downstream TSs. The reverse direction grant is not necessarily a new TxOP but may be a portion of the TxOP already reserved for the original transmitting mesh point.<br>
[0047] After a successful medium access is negotiated through an RTS/CTS or MRTS/MCTS handshake, the transmitting mesh point may transmit data during the TxOP duration. If all the data is transmitted, the transmitting mesh point may reset its access parameters. TS flow control may be exploited through buffers such as the high QoS packet queue 404 and the best available QoS packet queue 406. One methodology of controlling flow rate may be to set the schedule service interval to one quarter of the total allowable hop delay interval for the TS.<br>
[0048] FIG. 6 is a block diagram showing an exemplary beacon message 602 transmitted from a mesh point according to an aspect. The beacon message may include a mesh portal identifier 604, the number of hops to the mesh portal 606, and the number of mesh points in the mesh network 608. The mesh network 100 may have more than one mesh, if some of the mesh points have more than a single channel operating capability. In this case the beacon messages 602 may be used by each of the mesh points to select channels for its TS.<br><br>
 [0049] Each mesh point may monitor the beacons of the mesh points in its neighborhood to determine which channel to use. The mesh point may select the channel based on the data rate achievable on the channel using the measured beacon signal strength as a metric. The mesh point may also attempt to equalize the load on the mesh network 100 by choosing the least crowded channel.<br>
[0050] FIG. 7 shows the mesh network 100 of FIG. 1 where mesh point 102, a mesh portal, may operate on more than one channel. Thus two or more meshes may exist concurrently. Mesh portal 102 may broadcast its beacon 602 on channels 1 and 2. Neighboring mesh points 106, 108 and 118 may monitor beacons 1 and 2. The neighboring mesh points 106,108 and 118 may select a channel based on the strength of the received beacon on each channel or to balance the load. Mesh points 106 and 108 may choose channel 1 while mesh point 118 may choose channel 2. Each of these rank 1 mesh points may broadcast its own beacon.<br>
[0051] Mesh point 122 in turn may monitor the beacon of its neighboring mesh points 108 and 118. If mesh point 118 has only a single channel capability, mesh point 122 may communicate with mesh point 118 over the channel 2 mesh. If mesh point 108 has dual channel capability, mesh point 122 may choose to communicate with mesh point 108 over the channel 2 mesh. The TSs received by mesh point 108 may be received on the channel 2 mesh and forwarded to mesh point 102 over the channel 1 mesh. [0052] Mesh points may periodically monitor channels they are not using and switch channels to improve throughput. This dynamic load balancing may be done infrequently to minimize disruption of communication.<br>
[0053] Occasionally, a mesh point may be using a channel that may be inadequate for the TS traffic flow. The mesh point may scan for other beacons and determine their loads. If an appropriate alternate channel is found, the mesh point may broadcast a change channel message to its child mesh points (TS providing mesh points). The child mesh points in turn may broadcast the change channel request to any of its child mesh points. For example, mesh point 108 may have only a single channel capability and may choose to change channel from channel 1 to channel 2. It may broadcast the change request to mesh point 122 its sole child mesh point. Mesh point 122 in turn may broadcast a change channel message to mesh point 130 (not shown) its sole child mesh point. Mesh point 108 may wait until the channel change is affected by its child mesh<br><br>
point before making the channel change. Likewise, mesh point 122 may wait until the channel change is affected before making the channel change.<br>
[0054J A mesh point with only a single channel capability may also dissociate from another mesh point if a change channel request is received and the mesh point is unable to change channels because it is communicating with other mesh points over other channels and does not have the capability to add a channel. For example, if mesh point 118 broadcasts a change channel request (to change to channel 1), mesh point 122 may dissociate from mesh point 118 if it has only a single channel capability. [0055] Mesh points may be battery operated or have limited power. These mesh points may have a power save mode. The power save mode may include a period where the mesh point "sleeps" and does not transmit or receive information. The mesh point may broadcast the sleep time and duration of in its beacon. Mesh points monitoring the beacon may use this information in computing radio metrics for routing. [0056] A sleeping mesh point may send triggers when its sleep time ends. Mesh points may transmit buffered data packets to the awakened mesh point. The routing algorithms may account for the increased delay time due to sleeping mesh points. If alternate routes are available, the routing algorithms may route TS around mesh points having a power save mode.<br>
[0057] FIG. 8 is a flow diagram of a method of TS management 800 at an exemplary mesh point according to an aspect. The mesh point may receive data packets transmitted from one or more mesh points (802). The mesh point may parse the data packets and sort the data in the data packets by QoS. The mesh point may place the data in one or more packet queues (804). Each of the packet queues may store data that correspond to a particular QoS. The QoS packet queues may be high priority or best available, for example. The packet queues may serve as a leaky bucket police storing and buffering data to control the mesh point outflow data rate. The mesh point may aggregate data from one or more packet queues into transmit data packets (806). [0058] The mesh point may contend for access to the communication channel (808). The mesh point may adjust its contention access parameters such as the AIFS time, CW,njn. CWmax. and TxOP duration in response to a command from another mesh point. After successfully accessing the communication channel, the mesh point may send an MRTS message (810). The M portion of the message may have an ordered list of the response order expected from neighboring mesh points. The mesh point may receive an<br><br>
MCTS from one or more of the neighboring mesh points (812). The mesh point may transmit one or more data packets during its TxOP duration (814). The mesh point may receive a block acknowledge in response.<br>
[0059] FIG. 9 is a flow diagram of a method of energy conservation at an exemplary mesh point according to an aspect. The mesh point may transmit its power save mode frequency and duration in a beacon message (902). The mesh point may then enter the power save mode at a predetermined time (904). The power save mode may preclude transmitting and other functions that use a lot of energy. When a time equal to the power save duration has expired, the mesh point may recover (906). The awakening mesh point may transmit a trigger message to neighboring mesh points alerting the neighboring mesh points that they may now transmit to the mesh point (908). The mesh point may receive buffered data packets from the neighboring mesh points (910). [0060] FIG. 10 is a flow diagram of a method 1000 of selecting a channel in a multiple channel mesh network according to an aspect. Each mesh point may broadcast a beacon over each channel that it is operating on (1010). For example, a mesh point operating on two channels may transmit a first beacon over a first channel and a second beacon over a second channel. The mesh point may also monitor the communication channel for beacons (1020), which may include load information or other signal . The mesh point may determine the signal strength of each of the received beacons (1030). The beacon message may contain information about the mesh load on that channel. The mesh point may select a communication channel using the mesh load information, the signal strength information or other applicable information (1040). The mesh point may then transmit over the selected communication channel.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
"METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MANAGING DATA FLOW THROUGH A MESH NETWORK"<br>
Traffic streams through mesh points in a mesh network are managed. Data arriving at the mesh point are aggregated in packet queues. The packet queues segregate arriving data by the data's Quality of Service (QoS) requirement. An appropriate communication channel is selected. The communication channel is accessed through a contention access schema. An M-Request-To-Send (MRTS) message is sent to potential receiving mesh points with receiving mesh points responding with an M-Clear-to-Send (MCTS) message. Data from the packet queues is transmitted to the next mesh point. A mesh point power save mode allows battery operated mesh points to sleep preserving power.</td>
