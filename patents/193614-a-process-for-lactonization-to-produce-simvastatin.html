This invention relales to a process for lactonization to produce Bimvastalin.<br>
Lovaslatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, atorvastatin and mevastatin are well known potent anlihypercholesterolemic agents that function by limiting ctiolesterol biosynthesis by inhibiting the enzyme, HMG-CoA reductase. This class of compounds referred to generally as statins are produced either by natural fermentation process or through semi-synthetic and totally synthetic means thereof. Two of the most popular compounds in this therapeutic category are simvastatin Hnd atorvastatin The fonner is one of the most prescribed drugs in the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia with minimum side effects and well established safety pnsfile. The use of highly pure simvastatin is exceedingly desirable in preparation of a phanmaceutical lonn as it would avoid accumulation of impurities during prolonged usage and would reduce the possible side effects during medical treatment.<br><br><br>
oblajn simvastatin and thus lactonJzation constitutes an essential step of the process. It is of considerable importance lo employ an efficient method for the lactonization that can produce simvastatin of high punty in good yield<br>
The process disclosed in the US Patent 4,820,850 involves healing of hydroxyacid ammonium salt in toluene at 100" C under a purge of nitrogen. The ladonizalion completion requires 6-8 hours refluxing and results tn fomiation of increased amounts of dimer (Formula III),<br><br>
This dimer impurity is difficult lo separate from the desired lactone even with repeated crystallization. The presence of dimer lowers the purity of the simvastatin product.<br>
US Patent 4,916,239 describes another pmcess where the lactonization reaction has been carried out by treating hydroxyacid ammonium sail in a mixture of acetic acid and water, and in the presence of a strong acid catalyst. This process requires gradual addition of water in several lots to effect crystallization of the lactonized product from the reaction medium to shift the equilibrium to the lactone side and this drives the lactonization to completion. This process is not amenable to industrial scale due to effluent generation and low purity of simvastatin product even though dimer content obtained is reported to be less than 0,2%.<br>
US Patent 5,917,058 provides an alternate process to lactonize hydroxyacid or ils salt by treatment with acetic aad under anhydrous conditions The reaction is to be carried out essentially for a period of 5-7 hours and extensive water washing of the product is required to remove traces of acetic add.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to provide a highly efficient method for lactonization to produce simvastatin of greater than 99% puhty in high yield. An example where simvastatin of greater than 99.5% purity has been achieved is cited in WO 99/42601 wherein the product was purified by successive crystallizations from aqueous acetone and from ethyl acetate.<br><br>
Brief Statement of the Invention:<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a process for Lactonization to produce Simvastatin,<br>
of Pormula I<br><br>
The Lactonization reaction (heating) is completed in 20-40 minutes. The organic solvent is preferably xylenes and Z is NH^,<br><br>
Detailed Description of the Invention:<br>
As an initial attempt, lactonizaiion ot hydroxyacid ammonium salt was carried out in toluene (Ref: US Patent 4,820,850) and it was observed that dimeric impurity is formed to the extent of 0.5 to 1,0% and duration of reaction to attain starting material left unreacted to less than 2% by HPLC varied from 6 to 8 hours. Further, variation in results was observed depending upon the heating rate and flow of nitrogen purge. Examination of other lactonization procedures reported in Irterature concluded that cydizalion in toluene yields reasonably pure simvastatin, the only disadvantage being the fonnation of excess dimer impurity. We reasoned that this impurity formation is due to longer reaction period in toluene and is not the result of higher reaction temperature of 100" C.<br>
The instant invention relates to a novel process of lactonizing hydroxyacid ammonium salt in xylenes at reflux temperature The lactonization reaction is efficiently accomplished within 30 minutes in presence of an antioxideni under a constant purge of nitrogen. The level of dimer impurity in the reaction mixture under the present cyclization conditions is restricted to less than 0,4% and isolation of the simvastatin lactone from the reaction mass reduces it further to less than 0.2% as recommended in Pharma Europa, Vol. 10, No. 3, September. 1998. This kind of smooth reaction and the product stability at high temperature were not anticipated and this observation constitutes an important part of the present invention.<br>
The amount of xylenes is 20 to 50 parts by volume per part of the starting material. However, preferably 25 parts by volume is enough to carryout the lactonization recation. The said reaction can be conducted in different solvents having boiling range above 110° C such as ethyibenzene. The reaction is earned out at 110 to 140° C but preferably at 130-140° C, Xylenes employed typically consist of atx)ut 98% orthoxylene, the remaining being meta- and para-xyienes. Further, an antioxident is added and nilrogen is bubbled through the reaction mass. Suitable antioxidenls include butylaled hydroxytoluene and butylated hydroxyanisole.<br>
Product is isolated by dtstitlmg off xylenes and crystallization from cyclohexene to give simvastatin of greater than 99% punly. This can be further re-crystallized from methanol and water to consistently attain more than 99.4% puiity.<br>
Typically, the lactonization reaction is conducted by heating simvastatin ammonium salt in xylenes at 135-140° C for 30 minutes. However, it has tieen observed that extended heating in xylenes gives dimer to the extent of 0.65% against 1.2% in toluene.<br><br>
The major advantages realized in the present lactonizalion conditions as compared to the prior art are increased process productivity and product purity. The reaction period is typically 30 minutes that demonstrates a greater efficiency Xylenes are fully recovered and recycled in the process and no aqueous effluent is generated<br>
