				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to a recording medium and a method<br>
for previewing on-demand digital multimedia stored on said recording medium, and more<br>
specifically to a recording medium using a high density method for storing video and<br>
audio data and a previewing method for selecting audio video data stored on the<br>
recording medium.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The optical-electronic recording medium evolved from the early audio<br>
compact disc (CD), which is for audio only, to the audio/video recording medium, such<br>
as laser disc, video compact disc (VCD), and more recently, digital versatile disc (DVD)<br>
with selection menu.<br>
In the earlier VCD, there is only one mode button, i.e., activated mode in the<br>
selection menu of a player because of the simple data structure of the recording medium.<br>
FIG. 1A shows a schematic view of the data structure of a VCD. An entry table 100<br>
includes a plurality of entry points 101-ION, with each entry point having a<br>
corresponding track 111-1 IN. Track 111 further includes a plurality of video packs 11 lb,<br>
headed by an entry video pack Ilia, and a plurality of audio packs 111c.<br>
FIG. IB shows a schematic view of a playing method of a VCD. A<br>
reproducing system first initializes an audio decoder and a single-resolution video<br>
1<br><br>
decoder, as in step 151. In step 152, an entry menu is loaded from a VCD in the<br>
reproducing system. In step 153, the reproducing system receives an activation signal<br>
from the user. Step 154 is to find an entry point, and step 155 is to move a reading device<br>
of the reproducing system to the entry point corresponding to the activation signal. In<br>
step 156, the reading device reads all the video packs and audio packs of the track<br>
corresponding to the entry point, and, in step 157, all the video and audio packs are<br>
decoded.<br>
One of the shortcomings of VCD is that all of video sequence datas have the<br>
same output resolution; therefore, only a single-resolution background films can be<br>
played in the menu. Furthermore, the only button is the activation button; that is, the user<br>
can only activate and read the original audio/video data, and no previewing is allowed.<br>
In the current DVD technologies, the menu function is improved. As DVD has<br>
a more complicated data structure than VCD, the menu of a reproducing system usually<br>
includes two modes, namely, a selected mode and an activated mode. The reproducing<br>
system reads, from the DVD, the button information and highlight information of the<br>
selection buttons and their corresponding sub-pictures. The button information and the<br>
highlight information are for the reproducing system to obtain the coordinates, color and<br>
activation commands of the selection buttons, and the sub-pictures are used as the icons<br>
of the buttons. When the reproducing system receives an external signal as a selection<br>
signal, the reproducing system places the sub-picture of the selected button according to<br>
the coordinates in the button information and highlight information over the background.<br>
When the reproducing system receives an external activation signal, it executes the<br>
activation command corresponding to the selected button.<br>
2<br><br>
FIG. 2 shows a data structure of a preview method of a DVD. Button<br>
information 202 of highlight information 201 includes a mode 203 and an activation<br>
command 204. Mode 203 includes two options. One is the selected mode plus activated<br>
mode, and the other is activated mode only. DVD can perform activation command 204<br>
only in the activated mode; that is, to preview the N-th VOBU (video object unit), go to a<br>
starting address table 210 to read the starting address 21N of the N-th VOBU, and to read<br>
the audio/video data from starting address 2 IN. In this DVD technology, every VOBU of<br>
the title can only have a single resolution for all the audio/video data. The reproducing<br>
system cannot process audio/video data with more than one resolution at the same time;<br>
therefore, the preview video serquence must be pasted to the background video sequence<br>
one picture by one picture during the production of the menu, and then encoded and<br>
stored to the DVD disc. However, the compressed data will include a large amount of<br>
background pages of information, which takes up a lot of storage space. In the current<br>
technology, the button and audio/video information are without links; therefore, no on-<br>
demand preview is allowed. U.S. Patent No. 5,963,704, by Mimura in 1998, disclosed a<br>
menu system 304, as shown in FIG. 3, including a background dynamic video sequence<br>
301, a sub-picture image 302, and highlight information 303. Sub-picture image 302<br>
includes all the icons of the buttons, and highlight information records information of all<br>
the buttons. The reproducing system knows, through highlight information, the position<br>
of every button, and the command to be executed by every button in the activated mode.<br>
When the user selects a button, the system enters the selection mode. The<br>
reproducing system continues to play the background video sequence, locates the<br>
information of the selected button through highlight information, and finally overlaps the<br>
3<br><br>
icon of the selected button in the sub-picture image to the background video sequence in<br>
accordance with the button information. The aforementioned description shows that the<br>
menu system can only play a background dynamic video sequence with a fixed resolution,<br>
and can only have a selection mode and an activation mode. It cannot change the disc for<br>
playing under the selection mode; therefore, it does not provide the previewing<br>
mechanism of the disc.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,266,478, by Yoshiro in 1999, disclosed a reproducing<br>
system for displaying a subtitle image and a highlight display of the subtitle image.<br>
Using the video object unit (VOBU) as the unit for the data stored in the recording<br>
medium, each VOBU includes a navigation pack for recording highlight information. The<br>
reproducing system uses highlight information to obtain the button, playing position,<br>
color and play time of the subtitle image in the VOBU to play. The high light information<br>
contains only highlight information of the sub-picture image, and does not have the<br>
information on video sequence. Therefore, there is no link between the video sequence<br>
and the highlight information, and they are independent of each other. The system cannot<br>
change the video sequence in accordance with the user's selection, and does not provide<br>
the on-demand previewing.<br>
At present, to resume the viewing of a DVD or VCD disc requires the<br>
playing-and-skipping of entire disc to locate the resumption point It is a time-consuming<br>
process. With the previewing capacity, it will greatly reduce the amount of time to locate<br>
and resume the viewing of a disc.<br>
4<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made to overcome the aforementioned<br>
drawback of current digital multimedia data viewing. The primary object of the present<br>
invention is to provide a preview method for a digital audio/video disc, and its recording<br>
medium.<br>
The preview method is applicable to a medium information reproducing<br>
system. The medium information reproducing system includes a signal receiver, an audio<br>
output device and a display. The method includes the following steps: (a) Divide, encode<br>
and store data in a recording medium, so that the medium includes at least a preview<br>
audio/video data unit area, a background page area and a page control descriptor area.<br>
The preview audio/video data unit area includes a plurality of preview audio/video data<br>
units. The background page area stores the video data of the background page, and a<br>
plurality of buttons. The page control descriptor area stores the page control description<br>
data, and includes at least an area of total number of buttons, and a plurality of button<br>
information area. Each button information area stores button information, including at<br>
least a starting address of preview audio/video data unit, a set of coordinates for<br>
previewing window and a size of preview window, (b) Read, de-multiplex and decode<br>
the page control description data and the background page video data, and then output<br>
decoded background page video data to a display, (c) Detect an input switch button signal,<br>
and identify the corresponding button, (d) Read, de-multiplex and decode the audio/video<br>
data access unit in accordance with the starting address of the preview audio/video data<br>
unit of the button information, (e) Preview the preview audio/video data unit<br>
The present invention establishes links between each button and preview<br>
5<br><br>
window and low-resolution audio/video data access unit, so that the digital audio/video<br>
data can be previewed on-demand.<br>
According to the present invention, step (b) can further include the four sub-<br>
steps: (bl) Read, de-multiplex and decode the page control description data and the<br>
background page video data. (b2) Pre-set one of the buttons of the background page as<br>
the initial button. (b3) Read, de-multiplex and decode the audio/video data unit in<br>
accordance with the starting address of the preview audio/video data unit of the button<br>
information. (b4) Repeatedly play the preview audio/video data unit in the preview<br>
window corresponding to the button.<br>
According to the present invention, step (c) can further include the following<br>
four sub-steps: (cl) Check if a switch button signal is received; if not, repeat step (cl).<br>
(c2) identify the switch button signal. (c3) Check if the button mode of the button<br>
information is preview-able; if not, go to step (cl). (c4) Read the starting and ending<br>
addresses of preview audio/video data unit, a set of coordinates for previewing window<br>
and a size of preview window.<br>
According to the present invention, step (e) can further include the following<br>
four sub-steps: (el) Overlap the video data of the decoded preview audio/video data unit<br>
onto the previewing window specified by the coordinates in the decoded background<br>
page video data, and output the overlapped video data to the display, while outputting the<br>
audio data of the decoded preview audio/video data access unit to an audio output device.<br>
(e2) Check if a switch button signal is received; if so, return to step (c2). (e3) Read, de-<br>
multiplex and decode a next preview audio/video data access unit (e4) Determine if the<br>
reading has reached the ending address of the preview audio/video data access unit; if so,<br>
6<br><br>
return to step (d); otherwise, return to step (el).<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a recording medium to<br>
be used in a reproducing system so that the data stored in the recording medium can be<br>
played. The recording medium includes an original audio/video data unit packet, a<br>
preview audio/video data unit packet, a background page packet, and a page control<br>
descriptor packet. The original audio/video data packet includes a plurality of original<br>
audio data units and a plurality of original video data units. The preview audio/video data<br>
unit packet includes a plurality of preview audio data units and a plurality of preview<br>
video data units. The total amount of data of the preview audio/video data unit packet is<br>
about 205 of that of the original audio/video data unit packet The background page<br>
packet stores the background page video data. The page control descriptor packet stores<br>
at least a total number of the buttons and a plurality of button information. Each button<br>
information at least includes a button mode, a starting address of the original audio/video<br>
data unit, an ending address of the original audio/video data unit, a button coordinate, a<br>
button size, a previewing window coordinate, and previewing window size.<br>
The present invention can processes video data of two different resolutions;<br>
therefore, it can reduce the amount of data stored on the recording medium.<br>
The present invention includes a preview mode before the activated mode.<br>
When the button is in the preview mode, the reproducing system uses the links stored on<br>
the recording medium to process the low-resolution preview audio/video unit data and<br>
high-resolution background page when receiving a switch button signal from the user.<br>
The composite image is output in real-time.<br>
Furthermore, the current technique used for DVD previewing is to paste the<br>
7<br><br>
data in each preview audio/video data unit packet to the background page to form a new<br>
film, which is then compressed and stored in the DVD. The compressed data requires a<br>
large storage space because it contains the background page video data. The present<br>
invention requires a smaller storage space because it only stores the data in the preview<br>
audio/video data unit packet<br>
The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the<br>
present invention will become better understood from a careful reading of a detailed<br>
description provided herein below with appropriate reference to the accompanying<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
FIG. 4 shows a schematic view of the data structure of the recording medium<br>
of the present invention. FIG. 5 shows the relationship between the original film and the<br>
preview film in the present invention.<br>
The following description refers to both FIG. 4 and FIG. 5. A recording<br>
medium 400 of the present invention, used in a medium reproducing system to play the<br>
data stored on the recording medium, includes an original audio/video data unit area 401,<br>
a preview audio/video data unit area 402, a background page area 403, and a page control<br>
descriptor area 404. Preview audio/video data unit area 402 includes a plurality of low-<br>
resolution preview audio/video data units 501. Original audio/video data unit area 401<br>
includes a plurality of high-resolution original audio/video data units 503. The amount of<br>
data in preview audio/video data unit area 402 is about one-fifth of the amount of the data<br>
9<br><br>
in original audio/video data unit area 401. Background page area 403 includes high-<br>
resolution background page video data. Page control descriptor area 404 stores page<br>
control description data, which includes at least a total number 410 of the buttons and a<br>
plurality of button information 4411-41N. Each button information 411-41N stores a<br>
button mode 41 la, a starting address 41 lb of the original audio/video data unit, an ending<br>
address 41 lc of the original audio/video data unit, a starting address 41 Id of the preview<br>
audio/video data unit, an ending address 41 le of the preview audio/video data unit,<br>
button coordinates 41 If, a button size 41 lg, preview window coordinates 41 lh and<br>
preview window size 41 li.<br>
Button mode 41 la is used to indicate if this button can enter the preview mode.<br>
Starting address 411b and ending address 41 lc of the original audio/video data unit are<br>
the starting and the ending points of the original audio/video data unit on the optical<br>
medium for the reproducing system to read when the button is in the activate mode.<br>
Starting address 41 Id and ending address 41 le of the preview audio/video data unit are<br>
the starting and the ending points of the preview audio/video data unit on the optical<br>
medium for the reproducing system to read when the button is in the preview mode.<br>
Button coordinates 41 If and button size 41 lg are the starting coordinates of the button in<br>
the background page and the size of the button, respectively. Similarly, window<br>
coordinates 41 lh and window size 41 lg are the starting coordinates of the preview<br>
window in the background page and the size of the preview window, respectively.<br>
The distinct feature of the data structure of the present invention is that links<br>
are provided between each button, preview window and low-resolution audio/video data<br>
unit, so that the on-demand preview functionality can be achieved.<br>
10<br><br>
FIG. 5 shows a schematic view of the relationship between an original film<br>
and a preview film. Width 501a of the preview audio/video data unit 402 is less than or<br>
equal to width 503a of the original audio/video data unit 401, and length 501b of the<br>
preview audio/video data unit 402 is less than or equal to length 503b of the original<br>
audio/video data unit 401. Therefore, reproducing duration of the preview audio/video<br>
data unit 402 is less than or equal to reproducing duration of the original audio/video data<br>
unit 401. In addition, because the width and length of the background page are the same<br>
as those of the original audio/video data unit 401, width 501a and length 501b of the<br>
preview audio/video data unit 402 are less than or equal to the width and length of the<br>
background page, respectively.<br>
FIG. 6 shows a schematic view of the relation between a recording medium<br>
400 of the present invention and a medium reproducing system 600. Medium reproducing<br>
system 600 uses a reading device 602 to read the data on recording medium 400 into a<br>
system buffer 603. Medium reproducing system 400 then uses a multiplexer 604 to<br>
separate different types of data into separate buffers. That is, the video data is stored in<br>
video buffer 611 and audio data is stored in audio buffer 613, while background page<br>
video data is stored in background buffer 612 and page control description data is stored<br>
in page control buffer 614. The system inputs the video data, audio data, background<br>
video data and the page control description data to video decoder 621, background<br>
decoder 622, audio decoder 623 and page control description analyzer 624 for processing.<br>
There are two sources for audio and video data, including low-resolution preview<br>
audio/video data unit 501 and high-resolution original audio/video data unit 503. The<br>
page control description data is interpreted by page control analyzer 624.<br>
11<br><br>
FIG. 7 shows a schematic view of the relation between the menu, preview<br>
audio/video data unit and original audio/video data unit of the present invention. As<br>
shown in FIG. 7, menu of the present invention includes a background page 701, a<br>
plurality of buttons 711-71N, and a plurality of preview windows 721-72M. The preview<br>
audio/video data unit is divided into M VOBUs for playing. The original audio/video data<br>
unit is divided into N VOBUs for playing. Refer to FIG. 6 and FIG. 7 for the following<br>
description. When the movement button (up, down, left, and right) on the remote control<br>
is pressed, main controller 610 enters the preview mode according to the page control<br>
description data and the switching signal received by signal receiver 60S. Meanwhile, the<br>
main controller 610 performs the identification of button on background page 701 and<br>
reads the associated button information. When a preview-able button is pressed, the<br>
previewed audio/video data unit is played in the corresponding preview window. The<br>
method will be described in details in FIG. 8 and FIG. 9.<br>
On the other hand, when the user press an "enter" button after pressing the<br>
movement button (up, down, left and right), an activation signal is issued. In this case,<br>
main controller 610 enters the activation mode according to the page control description<br>
data and the switching signal received by signal receiver 60S. Meanwhile, the main<br>
controller 610 performs the identification of button on background page 701 and reads<br>
the associated button information. According to the associated button information, main<br>
controller 610 sends starting address 411b and ending address 411c of the selected<br>
original audio/video data unit to reading device 602 for reading the data in the unit Then,<br>
multiplex, decode, transform into the appropriate format by main controller 610, and<br>
output to display 606 for display until the entire original audio/video data unit is<br>
12<br><br>
processed.<br>
FIG. 8 shows a flowchart of the preview on-demand method of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Refer to FIGs. 4-8 for the following description. The preview on-demand<br>
method for digital audio/video data of the present invention is applicable to a medium<br>
reproducing system 600 having a signal receiver 605, an audio output device 609 and a<br>
display 606. The method starts with step 801, which is to divide, encode and store data in<br>
a recording medium 400. Recording medium 400 at least includes a preview audio/video<br>
data unit area 402, a background page area 403, and a page control descriptor area 404.<br>
Preview audio/video data unit area 402 includes a plurality of low-resolution preview<br>
audio/video data units 501. Background page area 403 includes high-resolution<br>
background page video data. Page control descriptor area 404 stores page control<br>
description data, which includes at least a number 401 of the buttons and a plurality of<br>
button information 4411-4IN. Each button information 411-41N stores a starting address<br>
41 Id of the preview audio/video data unit, preview window coordinates 41 lh and a<br>
preview window size 41 li.<br>
Step 802 is to read, de-multiplex, and decode the page control description data<br>
and background page, and output the decoded background page to display 606. Step 803<br>
is to detect an input button signal and identify the corresponding button. Step 804 is to<br>
read, de-multiplex and decode the preview audio/video data unit according to starting<br>

FIG. 9A is a flowchart of background initialization method. Step 901 is to<br>
read, de-multiplex and decode the page control description data and background page<br>
video data. Step 902 is to set one of the buttons in the background page as the initial<br>
button. Step 903 is to read, de-multiplex and decode the preview audio/video data unit<br>
according to the starting address of the preview audio/video data unit of the button<br>
information. Finally, step 904 is to repeatedly play the preview audio/video data unit in<br>
the preview window corresponding to the button.<br>
	FIG. 9B is a flowchart of button identification method. Step 911 is to detect if<br>
a switch signal is received; if not, repeat this step until a signal is received and proceed to<br>
step 912. Step 912 is to identify the button. Step 913 is to check if the button is a<br>
preview-able mode; if not, skip to step 911; otherwise, proceed to step 914. Step 914 is to<br>
read the starting address and the ending address of the preview audio/video data unit, the<br>
preview window coordinates, and the preview window size.<br>
FIG. 9C is a flowchart of previewing method of preview audio/video data unit<br>
Step 921 is to overlap the decoded preview audio/video data unit onto the decoded<br>
background page video data at the location specified by the preview window coordinates<br>
and output to display 606. Meanwhile, the decoded audio data of the preview audio/video<br>
data unit is outputted to audio output device 609. Main controller 610 activates switch<br>
608 so that the decoded preview video data and the background page can be overlapped<br>
14<br><br>
by overlapper 607 and transformed by main controller 610 into an appropriate format for<br>
outputting to display 606.<br>
Step 922 is to detect if a switch button signal is received; if so, return to step<br>
912; otherwise, proceed to step 923. Step 923 is to read, de-multiplex and decode the next<br>
preview audio/video data unit Finally, step 924 is to check if the ending address of the<br>
preview audio/video data unit is reached; if so, return to step 804; otherwise, return to<br>
step 921.<br>
The present invention includes a preview mode before the activated mode.<br>
When the button is in the preview mode, the reproducing system uses the links stored on<br>
the recording medium to process the low-resolution preview audio/video unit data and<br>
high-resolution background page when receiving a switch button signal from the user.<br>
The composite image is output in real-time.<br>
Furthermore, the current technique used for DVD previewing is to paste the<br>
data in each preview audio/video data unit packet to the background page to form a new<br>
film, which is then compressed and stored in the DVD. The compressed data requires a<br>
large storage space because it contains the background page video data. The present<br>
invention requires a smaller storage space because it only stores the data in the preview<br>
audio/video data unit packet.<br>
Although the present invention has been described with reference to the<br>
preferred embodiments, it will be understood that the invention is not limited to the<br>
details described thereof. Various substitutions and modifications have been suggested in<br>
the foregoing description, and others will occur to those of ordinary skill in the art<br>
Therefore, all such substitutions and modifications are intended to be embraced within<br>
15<br><br>
the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.<br>
