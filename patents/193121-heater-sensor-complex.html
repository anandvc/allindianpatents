				<td>HEATER-SENSOR COMPLEX<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a heater-sensor<br>
 complex comprising a heater unit and a sensor unit as integrated. More particularly, the invention relates to a heater-sensor complex suitable for use as a heat input for a soldering iron.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Referring to Fig. 11 which illustrates the tip of a soldering iron, a rod-shaped ceramic heater 51 is shown as fitted in the tip portion 52 of a soldering iron. This ceramic heater 51 includes a ceramic green sheet 53 wrapped round a ceramic mandrel. The ceramic green sheet 53 has been printed with a heater pattern and a sensor pattern. The topological relationship of the patterns may for example be as illustrated in Fig. 12. In this example, the sensor pattern 55 is a pattern printed using a tungsten paste in a breadth of 0.2 mm and a heater pattern 54 is a pattern printed using the tungsten paste in a breadth of 0.4 mm surrounding said sensor pattern 55. The sensor pattern 55 extends rearward across the heater pattern 54 and is connected to sensor electrodes 56, while the heater<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
pattern 54 is connected to heater electrodes 57 which are situated forwardly of said sensor electrode 56.<br>
However, the sensor-mounted ceramic heater illustrated in Figs. 11 and 12 has the disadvantage that because it has four leads, the outer diameter of said ceramic mandrel cannot be reduced to less than 3.5 mm. Thus, if a size reduction is required of a soldering iron, the pipe diameter cannot be decreased any further because of the limited freedom in management of the leads. There also is the disadvantage that because the sensor is located on the peripheral surface of the ceramic mandrel, the tip temperature of the soldering iron cannot be detected with precision. Furthermore, in the case of soldering irons such that the detection of the tip temperature hinges on the temperature-dependent change in resistance value, the illustrated soldering iron being no exception, there must be a fair variation among products so that each product has to be adjusted to fall within tolerance limits. <br>
Meanwhile, there is also available a heater-sensor fabricated in such a manner that instead of wrapping a green sheet round a ceramic mandrel, an electrothermic wire is directly wound round a ceramic mandrel and the winding is then coated with a ceramic coating to insure the necessary insulation.<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
However, such a heater has the disadvantage that<br>
when the ceramic coat consists of closely packed fine<br>
ceramic particles, the coat tends to develop cracks	<br><br>
because of the relatively high coefficient of, thermal <br>
expansion of the electrothermic wire as compared with<br>
the efficient of thermal expansion of the ceramic coat.<br>
On the other hand, if coarse ceramic particles are used<br>
for said ceramic coating, the insulation resistance<br>
drops to cause a leak of current to the work load, e.g. <br>
a substrate.<br>
Designed to overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages of the prior art, the present invention has for its object to provide a heater-sensor complex which, despite its simple construction, is not only capable of detecting the tip temperature of a soldering iron with precision but also insures a thorough insulation without the risk for incidence of cracks in the insulation layer.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Developed to accomplish the above object, the present invention relates to a heater-sensor complex comprising a heating member made of a first metallic material, a non-heating member made of said first metallic material, and a non-heating member made of a second metallic material, with said heating member made<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
of said first metallic material being welded to a<br>
forward end of said non-heating member made of said<br>
second metallic material, said first metallic material <br>
being an electrothermic iron-chromium alloy, and said <br>
second metallic material being a nickel or nickel- <br>
chromium alloy, thus forming a thermocouple there- <br>
between.	<br>
Preferably, said heating member made of said first<br><br>
metallic material is a relatively small gauge wire which is wound in the form of a coil round a cylindrical insulating pipe and connected to said non-heating member made of said first metallic material which is a linear relatively large gauge wire rigidly secured to the peripheral surface of said insulating pipe, and said non-heating member made of said second metallic material being a linear member passing into the bore of said insulating pipe.<br>
Since, in accordance with the invention, an iron-chromium alloy electrothermic material is used in<br>
 combination with a nickel or nickel-chromium alloy to form a thermocouple, the tip temperature of the solder-<br>
 ing iron can be detected with precision and in a simple<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is now described in further detail with reference to the preferred embodiments shown in the several views of the accompanying drawing.<br>
As illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, the principal part of the soldering iron heater according to the present invention comprises a cylindrical insulating pipe 1 having an axial bore la and a heater-sensor complex 2 mounted thereon. The insulating pipe 1 may for example be an alumina pipe.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1 which illustrates the heater-sensor complex 2, a tip 3a of a coil-shaped heating wire 3 is welded to a tip 4a of a linear non-heating wire 4 by argon welding. The base end 3b of the heating wire 3 is welded to a linear non-heating wire 5. The heating wire 3 is made of iron-chrominum alloy Typical examples of the alloy composition are shown in Table 1.<br><br>

Among such iron-chromium alloys, kanthal D (a<br>
kanthal wire manufactured by Kanthal Co.) is preferred. <br>
Al=4.0 can also be employed.<br>
In this embodiment, the non-heating wire 4 is made of nickel but the non-heating wire 5 and the heating wire 3 are made of the same Kanthal D alloy. However, to prevent generation of heat in the non-heating wire 5, the diameter of the non-heating wire 5 is about 2.5 times as large as the diameter of the heating wire 3.<br>
When a heater-sensor complex 2 of the above construction is supplied with an electric current, the heating wire 3 generates heat so that theoretically the temperature profile shown in Fig. 3 (b) is obtained. Thus, whereas the temperatures of the base ends 4b, 5b of the non-heating wires 4, 5 are substantially identical and equal to To, the argon-welded spots 4a, 3a assume a temperature of T1 and the heating wire 3 shows<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
a high temperature in its central portion. The kanthal<br>
wires (3, 5) and the Ni wire (4) constitute a thermo-<br>
couple, with the result that, assuming that the Seebeck <br>
coefficient of the Ni wire is a and the Seebeck coeffi- <br>
cient of the Kanthal wires is ß, an electromotive force<br>
of the order of	<br>
a(T1-T0)-ß(Ti-T0) = ?<br>
is generated between the base,end 4b of the non-heating wire 4 and the base end 56 of the non-heating wire 5 (Kanthal wire).<br>
Since a and ß are of different signs, the electromotive forces of the non-heating wires 4, 5 are added to each other. The temperature of the tip portion 5a of the non-heating wire 5 rises in accordance with the <br>
temperature gain of the heating wire 3 and, therefore,<br>
assuming that a Ni wire is chosen for the non-heating<br>
wire 5, the electromotive force between the base ends<br>
4b, 5b of the non-heating wires 4, 5 is decreased. <br><br>

Table 2 shows the measured characteristics of the heater-sensor complex 2. Thus, the temperature of the argon-welded spots 3a, 4a was increased from 0°C to 500°C and the voltage values at the ends of non-heating wires 4b, 5b were measured. It will be seen from Table 2 that a good linearity can be obtained over the temperature range of 200°C-450°C which is generally-used for soldering irons and that the sensor output is of the practically useful level. Fig. 4 is a diagram comparing the output characteristic of the heater-sensor complex 2 (B) with the characteristic of a<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
thermocouple K (A), indicating that the electromotive force of the heater-sensor complex 2 is about one-half of the electromotive force of the thermocouple K. With this heater-sensor complex 2, a stable sensor output can be obtained up to 600°C as can be seen from the diagram, indicating that this heater-sensor complex 2 can be used not only as a temperature sensor soldering irons but also in other applications. <br>
The method of manufacturing the soldering iron heater according to the present invention is now described. First, the non-heating wire 4 is passed into the bore la of the insulating pipe 1 and the heating wire 3 is wound round the periphery of the insulating pipe 1. Then, using a fixing wire 6 com-prising a kanthal wire, the non-heating wire 5 is secured to the periphery of the insulating pipe 1 (Fig.<br>
2).<br>
Thereafter, a first ceramic coating 7 is applied<br>
by the dip coating technique over the argon-welded<br>
spots 3a, 4a, heating wire rod 3, and (fixing wire 6 and<br>
the applied coating 7 is dried and fired. The first <br>
ceramic coating 7 mentioned above is an aqueous disper- <br>
sion containing a binder and a coarse grade alumina <br><br><br>
powder and, when the applied coat is dried and fired, <br>
the argon-welded spots 3a, 4a and heating wire rod 3 <br><br>
- 11 -<br>
are rigidly secured to the insulating pipe l. Since this ceramic coating 7 is a dispersion of coarse particles, it effectively absorbs the difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion between the insulating pipe 1 and the heating wire 3 so that no cracking or cleavage occurs in use.<br>
Then, a second ceramic coating 8 is applied by the dip coating technique, dried, and fired. At the same time, using this ceramic coating 8, the heater-sensor complex 2 is secured in the recess 9a formed in the tip portion 9 of the soldering iron (Fig. 5). Of course, the tip 9 of the soldering iron is made of a material having good thermal conductivity. <br>
The second ceramic coating 8 is specifically an aqueous dispersion containing a binder and a fine alumina powder and when this coating is dried and fired, a positive insulation is obtained. Moreover, through this second ceramic coating 8, the heater-sensor complex 2 is rigidly secured to the tip portion 9 of the soldering iron.<br>
Since, in the heater-sensor complex 2 of the present invention, the non-heating wire 4 is retained with a free air space around it in the bore la of the insulating pipe 1, the non-heating wire 4 is substantially not susceptible to the temperature of the<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
heating wire 3. Moreover, as the non-heating wire 4 is a Ni wire resistant to oxidative corrosion, it can be disposed in contact with air.<br>
After the heater-sensor complex 2 is securely installed in the recess 9a of the tip portion 9 of the soldering iron, the protective pipe 10 is secured to the periphery of the tip portion 9 at the base end side thereof (Fig. 5). Furthermore, a synthetic resin member (lead portion) 11 is fitted to the base of the protective pipe 10 with the connecting terminals 12, 13 extending out of the synthetic resin member, with the result that, as a whole, an integrated soldering iron heater is provided (Fig. 6), This soldering iron heater is mounted or dismounted by connecting or disconnecting said terminals 12, 13 with respect to the corresponding connectors. As illustrated in Fig. 7, the base side of the protective pipe 10 is firmly held by a grip member 14 and a thermister TH for temperature measurement is disposed in close proximity with the connecting terminals 12, 13.<br>
Figs. 8 and 9 show the temperature control circuit including the heater-sensor complex 2. The illustrated temperature circuit essentially comprises said heater-sensor complex 2 for heating the tip and detecting the tip temperature T1 of the soldering iron, said<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
thermister TH for detecting the base end temperature T0 of the heater-sensor complex 2, a power supply block 15 for the heater-sensor complex 2, an amplifying block 16 for amplifying the thermocouple output from the heater-sensor complex 2, an adder block 17 for adding up the thermocouple output and thermister output, a full-wave rectifier 18 for rectifying an AC voltage (Fig. 9, the same applies to the following elements), a zero crossing pulse generator 19, a temperature setting block 20 for setting the tip temperature of the solider iron, and a microcomputer unit 21 for controlling the whole operation. The calculated tip temperature is indicated on a display 22 connected to the microcomputer unit 21.<br>
In this embodiment, the microcomputer unit 21 is<br><br>
specifically a one-chip microcomputer M 37470 (Mitsubishi). This microcomputer unit 21 is provided with output ports, PORT1 and PORT2, and it is so arranged that the power supply block 15 is controlled ON/OFF according to the output data at PORT1 and the switch SW at the output of the adder 17 is controlled ON/OFF according to the output data at PORT2.<br>
Furthermore, the microcomputer unit 21 is provided with analog input terminals ADINl and ADIN2, which are connected to an A/D converter. The output value from the adder block 17 is fed to the analog input terminal<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
ADINl and the voltage value corresponding to the set temperature is fed to the analog input terminal ADIN2. The analog input terminal VREF of the microcomputer unit has been supplied with a reference voltage (e.g. 2.55 V) for the A/D converter, whereby the resolution of the A/D converter is determined.<br>
The microcomputer unit 21 is further provided with an interrupt terminal INT which is connected to the zero crossing pulse generator 19 so that when the full-wave-rectified pulse current value has reached 0 volt, an interrupt signal is applied to the microcomputer unit 21, whereupon the program of an interrupt routine is started.<br>
As shown in Fig. 8, the power supply block 15 comprises a field-effect transistor FET1 and a resistor Rl connected to the gate terminal of the transistor FET1. The drain terminal of the transistor FETl is connected to the output of the full-wave rectifier 18 + V (e.g. waveheight value =2.4 volts), while the source terminal is connected to the heat-sensor complex 2.<br>
The amplifier 16 comprises a current limiting resistor R2, diodes Dl, D2, a noninverting amplifier A0, resistors R3, R4, which implement an amplification factor of about 250, an inverting amp1ifierAl, and resistors R5, R6. According to this circuitry, the<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
sensor voltage from the heater-sensor 2 is amplified about 250-fold and its phase inverted by said non-inverting amplifier AO and inverting amplifier Al. Resistance values may for example be R3 - 1 Kn, R4 = 250 K(, and R5 = R6 = 100 K(.<br>
Since, in this circuit, the source voltages of the noninverting amplifier A0 are + VDD and -VDD (e.g+5 volts), application of any voltage beyond the range of +VDD - VDD to the noninverting amplifier AO would cause deterioration of characteristics or even breakdown. Therefore, clamp diodes Dl, D2 are provided so that only voltages within the range of +VQD+VF --VDD-VF will be applied to the noninverting amplifier A0, It should be noted that VF is the forward voltage of the diodes Dl, D2.<br>
Now, when the transistor FET1 is ON, the voltage V-VDD-VF IS applied to the resistor R2 but since the resistance value of resistor R2 is set to about 10 kn, only a current of about 2 mA at most flows. On the contrary, when the transistor FETl is OFF, the thermocouple output from the heater-sensor complex 2 is applied to resistor R2 so that there may be cases in which a voltage drop in resistor R2 presents a problem. However, since the amplification is performed by the noninverting amplifier AO in this invention, its input<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
impedance Rin is sufficiently large to satisfy the condition of Rin &gt;&gt; R2, with the result that the exact thermocouple output can be detected. If an inverting amplifier be adopted for this amplification, the condition of Rin &gt;&gt; R2 might not be satisfied.<br>
The adder block 17 essentially comprises an inverting amplifier A2 and resistors R7, R8, Rll, and R13. To the thermister TH, a resistor R10 is connected in parallel, and the source voltage +VDD IS fed through a resistor R9. Resistance values may for example be R7 = R8 = 100 Kn, Rll = R13 - 47 Kn, R9 = 220 Kn, and R10 = 50 Kn. Disposed between the adder block 17 and the microcomputer unit 21 is an open-close switch SW which is controlled from the output port PORT2 (Fig. 9).<br>
In the adder block 17, the input from the inverting amplifier A1 is applied to the inverting amplifier A2 through resistor R7 and the input from thermister TH is fed to the amplifier A2 through resistor Rll. Moreover, the voltage made available by dividing the source voltage -VDD by resistor R12 and variable resistor VR1 is fed to the inverting amplifier A2 through resistor R13.<br>
Since the output of the inverting amplifier A2 is added to the A/D converter of the microcomputer unit 21, the output of the inverting amplifier A2 must be<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
constantly maintained in the plus range regardless of the temperature-dependent change of the output voltages from the heat-sensor complex 2 and thermister TH. Therefore, in the present invention, the variable resistor VRl is adjusted so that the output of the inverting amplifier A2 will always be within the range of 0 V - 2.55 V.<br>
As shown in Fig. 9, the temperature setting block 20 comprises resistors R14, R15, a buffer A3, and a variable resistor VR2. While a reference voltage VREF is applied to the variable resistor VR2, it is so arranged that by manipulating the variable resistor VR2 a voltage corresponding to the set temperature of 200°C - 450°C can be applied to the analog input terminal AIN2 of the microcomputer unit.<br>
The operation of the control circuit shown in Figs. 8 and 9 is now described with reference to the timing chart of Fig. 10. Fig. 10 shows the output of full-wave rectifying circuit (A), the output of Zero crossing pulse generator (B), the input to analog input terminal ADIN1 (C), output from output port PORT1 (D), and the terminal end voltages of heat-sensor complex 2 (E).<br>
When the output value of the full-wave rectifying circuit 18 becomes 0 volt and the output of the zero<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
crossing pulse generator 19 is increased, the micro-computer 21 is interrupted by a pulse signal applied to the interrupt terminal INT. In the interrupt routine, the microcomputer unit 21 first outputs a control signal to the output ports P0RT1, PORT2 to bring the transistor FET1 into OFF condition and set the open-close switch SW1 to ON position.<br>
When the transistor FET1 is set in OFF condition, the current supply to the heater-sensor 2 is stopped so that only the thermocouple output appears at the two ends of the heater-sensor complex 2. This thermocouple output is a value corresponding to the temperature difference T1-T0 between the tip temperature T1 and the base (4b, 5b) temperature T0 and this thermocouple output is amplified about 250-fold in the amplifying block 16 and applied to the resistor R5 of the adder block 17. On the other hand, a voltage corresponding to the resistance value of thermister TH1 is applied to the resistor R7 in the adder block 17 and the resistance value of thermister TH1 changes in response to the temperature T0 of the base portions 4b, 5b of the sensor-heater complex 2. Therefore, the adder block 17 outputs a voltage corresponding to the soldering iron tip temperature T1. Since the open-close switch SW 1 is in the ON state at this moment, this voltage corres-<br><br>

ponding to the tip temperature T1 is fed to the microcomputer unit 21 from said analog input terminal ADIN1.<br>
Meanwhile, a voltage corresponding to the set temperature TS has been fed from the analog input terminal ADIN2. Therefore, the microcomputer unit 21 compares the voltage from the analog input terminal ADIN1 with that from the analog input terminal ADIN2 to figure out whether the current tip temperature Tp is higher than the set temperature value TS or not.<br>
Now, when the interrupt pulse (Fig. 10 (B)) is not later than the initial 3rd one, it means that the tip temperature Tp is lower than the set temperature value Ts. Under this condition Tp<tg the microcomputer unit sets open-close switch sw1 off through output port port2 and transistor fet1 on port1 to end interrupt routine. then because has been set of full-wave rectifying block is fed as it sensor-heater so that heater energized increase soldering iron tip temperature.></tg>
Referring to the timing chart of Fig. 10, when the interrupt pulse is not later than the first 3rd one, the same operation as above is repeated so that the tip temperature Tp rises. In response to this rise in tip temperature, the input to the analog input terminal<br><br>

ADIN1 is increased.<br>
However, when the interrupt pulse is the 4th or subsequent one, it means that the soldiering iron tip temperature Tp is higher than the set temperature TS (Tp&gt;TS) so that the microcomputer unit 21 brings the open-close switch SW1 and transistor FETl into the OFF state through output ports PORT1, PORT2 to end the interrupt routine. As the transistor FETl is thus set OFF, the power supply block 15 continues suspending the current supply to the sensor-heater complex 2 even after completion of the interrupt routine so that the soldering iron tip temperature drops continuously. Then, as the tip temperature Tp falls below the set value TS (Tp<ts the power supply block resumes current to heater-sensor></ts><br>
