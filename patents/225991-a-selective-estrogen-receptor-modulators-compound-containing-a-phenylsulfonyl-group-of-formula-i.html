				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a selective estrogen receptor modulator compound containing<br>
phenylsulfonyl group formula I:<br><br>
In addition, present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition that comprises a composition of<br>
formula I. or a pharmaceutical acid add salt thereof, and a pharmaceutical carrier. Further the present<br>
invention also relates the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention useful in treating<br>
endometriosis and/or uterine fibrosis.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
( terine leiomyoma/leiomyomata (uterine fibroid disease) is a clinical problem that goes under a<br>
variety of names, including uterine fibrosis uterine hypertrophy uterine leiomyomata. myometrial<br>
hypertrophy, fibrosis uteri, and fibrotic metritis. Essentially., ulcrine fibrosis is a condition where there<br>
is an inappropriate deposilion of fibroid issue on the wall of the uterus. This condition is a cause of<br>
dysmenorrhea and infertility in women.<br>
I indometriosis is a condition of severe dy smenorrhed, which is accompanied by severe pain. bleeding<br>
into the endometrial masses or peritoneal cavity and often leads to infertility. The symptoms' cause<br>
appears to be ectopic endometrial growths that respond inappropriately to normal hormonal control<br>
and are located in inappropriate tissues.<br>
Because of the inappropriate locations for endometrial growth, the tissue seems to initiate local<br>
inflammatory-like responses causing macrophage infiltration and a cascade of events leading in<br>
initiation of the painful response. Evidence suggests that a cause of uterine fibrosis<br><br>
and endometriosis is an inappropriate response of fibroid tissue and/or endometrial tissue to<br>
estrogen.<br>
Many publications have appeared within the last ten years disclosing selective estrogen<br>
receptor modulators (SERMs). e. g., U.S. Patent No.'s 5,484. 795, 484. 798, 5,510, 358.<br>
5,998, 401 and WO 96/09040. Many of these SFRMs. generally speaking- have been tound to<br>
have a beneficial estrogen agonist activity in the bone and cardiovascular system, with a<br>
concomitant beneficial estrogen antagonist activity in the breast. A small, particularly useful<br>
subset of such compounds has also been found to have an estrogen antagonist effect in the<br>
uterus. A compound with this SERM profile holds particular promise in treating uterine<br>
fibroid disease and/or endometriosis.<br>
However the clinical use of such SERM compounds for the treatment of uterine fibroid<br>
disease and/or endometriosis, particularly in pre-menopausal vvomen. has been hampered by<br>
the propensity of said compounds to have significant ovarian stimulatory effects. A great need<br>
currently exists, therefore, for new SERM compounds that behave as estrogen antagonists in<br>
the uterus that do not significantly stimulate the ovaries.<br>

Synthesis<br>
The compound of formula I may be prepared as described in the following<br>
Schemes, Preparations and Examples.<br><br><br>
In Scheme 1, a compound of formula IV is reacted with a compound of formula III<br>
under usual "Suzuki" or "Stille" reaction conditions, i.e., wherein one of substituent "A"<br>
or "D" is a boronic acid/ester or alkyl stannane moiety and the other is a leaving group,<br>
e.g., chloro, bromo or iodo or a sulfonate group such as trifluoromethyl sulfonate. When<br>
R6 is alkyl (preferably methyl) or benzyl, said R6 groups may be removed under standard<br>
conditions (see, e.g., the procedures that follow or the latest edition of Greene, Protective<br>
Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, N. Y.) to provide the<br>
compound of formula I where R is H. When u is 0 or 1, the coupled product may be<br>
oxidized under standard conditions (see preparations below) to prepare the corresponding<br><br>
mono or bis-sulfone of formula 1(a) where m is 2. A formula I or 1(a) compound where R<br>
is H may then be further derivatized to prepare a compound of formula I where R is<br>
COR2<br><br>
In Scheme 2, the compound of formula 1(b) is formed by first reacting a compound<br>
of formula VI (prepared essentially as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,929,090 which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference) with a compound of formula VIII under standard<br><br>
nucleophflic displacement conditions to give a product compound feat may be deprotected<br>
and further derivatized as described supra to give the compound of formula 1(b).<br>
The compound of formula 1(c) may also be prepared from a compound of formula<br>
Vas depicted in Scheme 2. The compound of formula VII may be prepared by first<br>
reacting the compound of formula V with a base followed by the addition of 4-fluoro-<br>
benzaldehyde. The product aldehyde may be converted to the corresponding<br>
hydroxy/sulfonyl compound of formula VH by reaction, e.g., first with hydrogen peroxide<br>
followed by reaction with sodium perborate monohydrate. The compound of formula VII<br>
may then be reacted with a compound of formula VIII under standard nucleophilic<br>
displacement conditions to give a product compound that may be deprotected and further<br>
derivatized as described supra to give the compound of formula 1(c).<br><br>
In Scheme 3, an alternative preparation of a compound of formula I where R1 and<br>
R1' are independently C1-C6 alkyl, CF3 or CH2CF3 and the SO2R1 moiety does not<br>
combine with the R0 moiety is shown. A compound of formula DC (prepared in an<br>
analogous fashion to the reaction of a compound of formula HI with a compound of<br><br>
formula IV described in Scheme 1) may be reacted with the thiolate of a compound of the<br>
formula HSR1a where R1a is C1-C6 alkyl, CF3 or CH2CF3, e.g., sodium methanethiolate<br>
which results in displacement of the "Lg" substituent(s). The "Lg" moiety found in the<br>
compound of formula DC is a substituent mat activates the phenyl group to which it is<br>
attached toward nucleophilic aromatic substitution. The thioether formula X product may<br>
then be oxidized to form the corresponding sulfone (or sulfoxide) compound mat may be<br>
deprotected and further derivatized as described supra to give the compound of formula<br>
1(d). When more man Lg substituent may be introduced into a compound of formula IV,<br>
the methodology of Scheme 3 is especially adaptable to prepare a compound of formula<br>
1(e) where n is 1 and m is 0 or 1.<br>
. Compounds of formula III, IV and VIII may be prepared as shown below or by<br>
procedures analogous to those found in the art. Compounds of formula V may be<br>
prepared by analogous procedures to those described in U.S. Pat No. 5,929,090 or as<br>
described below. Compounds of formula HSR1a are, in general, commercially available<br>
or can be prepared by procedures readily available to the ordinarily skilled synthetic<br>
organic chemist.<br>
General Experimental Details<br>
Electrospray mass spectra is obtained, e.g., on a Finnigan LCQ Duo instrument<br>
using a mobile phase of 50% acetonitrile, 25% methanol, and 25% 2mM aqueous<br>
ammonium acetate.<br>
Preparative HPLC is performed, e.g., on a Gilson Preparative System with<br>
Unipoint Software and dual wavelength detection at 220 and 254 nm as well as Finnigan<br>
aQa MS. A 20-mm x 250-mm ODS-AQ column with a particle size of 15 microns may<br>
be used as the stationary phase. The eluent is a binary system of bottle A (0.1%<br>
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 1% isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in water) and bottle B (0.05%<br>
TFA, 1 % PA in acetonitrile). The standard method is a gradient of 30-95% B unless<br>
otherwise indicated. The compounds purified by this method were isolated as TFA salts.<br>
Preparative HPLC's may also be performed on a Biotage ParallelFlex system with<br>
proprietary dual wavelength detection and software. A 30-mm x 150-mm or 19-mm x<br>
250 mm Xterra column with a particle size of 10 microns is used as the stationary phase<br><br>
and 10mM NH4+HCOO-/ 10mM NH4OH is used as mobile phase A.and 100% acetonitrile<br>
is used as a mobile phase B.<br>

invention, the active ingredient (a formula I compound, or a pharmaceutical salt thereof)<br>
will usually be mixed with a carrier, or diluted by a carrier, or enclosed within a carrier<br>
which may be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container. When the carrier<br>
serves as a diluent, it may be a solid, semisolid or liquid material that acts as a vehicle,<br>
excipient or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form<br>
of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions,<br>
solutions, syrups, aerosol (as a solid or in a liquid medium), soft and hard gelatin<br>
capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions and sterile packaged powders.<br>
Some examples of suitable carriers, excipients, and diluents include lactose,<br>
dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates,<br>
tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone,<br>
cellulose, water syrup, methyl cellulose, methyl and propylhydroxybehzoates, talc,<br>
magnesium stearate and mineral oil. The formulations can additionally include<br>
lubricating agents, wetting agents, e.g., polysorbate 80 or lauryl sulfate, emulsifylng and<br>
suspending agents, preserving agents, sweetening agents or flavoring agents. The<br>
compositions of the invention may be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or<br>
delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the recipient patient.<br>
Formulation Examples<br>
10 mg Capsules or Tablets<br>
Add about 156 mg of a bulking agent (lactose, mannitol, or dextrose), about 20<br>
mg of a dismtegrant (microcrystalline cellulose, or starch), about 4 mg of a super<br>
disintegrant (crospovidone, or sodium starch glycollate) about 4 mg of a binder (hydroxy<br>
propyl methyl cellulose or hydroxy propyl cellulose) and about 10 mg of the active<br>
ingredient (e.g., the compound of Example 4) to a granulator and mix to uniformly<br>
distribute the powders. Spray an aqueous granulation solution consisting of povidone,<br>
hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose, or hydroxy propyl cellulose (sufficient to deliver about<br>
2-4% by weight of dry powders) and wetting agent such as polysorbate 80 or sodium<br>
lauryl sulfate (sufficient to deliver between 0.5 and 3% by weight) at a uniform rate onto<br><br>
the powders while mixing. Wet sieve the granulated material through a screen to disrupt<br>
large agglomerates. Dry the filtered granulated powder by either fluid bed processing or<br>
in a convection oven. Reduce the dried granulated powder to a uniform size by passing<br>
through a co-mill or other suitable apparatus and then transfer the material to a mixer.<br>
Uniformly blend the granulated powder with a lubricant (magnesium stearate, or sodium<br>
stearyl fumurate at about 1% by weight of the total formulation) and additional<br>
disintegrant (about 2 - 4% by weight in the outside powders). Fill the finished powders<br>
into hard gelatin capsules or compress said powder into tablets (followed by film coating<br>
the tablets as described below). The total weight of a capsule or tablet prepared in this<br>
manner is about 200 mg.<br>
45 mg Capsules or Tablets<br>
Add about 162 mg of a bulking agent (lactose, mannitol or starch), about 10 mg of<br>
a disintegrant (crospovidone or sodium starch glycollate), and about 45 mg of the active<br>
ingredient (e.g., the compound of Example 4) to a granulator and mix to uniformly<br>
distribute the powders. Spray an aqueous granulation solution consisting of povidone<br>
(about 35% by weight) and polysorbate 80 (about 10% by weight) at a uniform rate onto<br>
the powders while mixing. Wet sieve the granulated material through a screen to disrupt<br>
large agglomerates. Dry the filtered granulated powder by either fluid bed processing or<br>
in a convection oven. Pass the dried granulated powder through a co-mill or other<br>
suitable apparatus and then transfer the material to a mixer. Uniformly blend the<br>
granulated powder with a lubricant (magnesium stearate; about 1% by weight of the total<br>
formulation) and additional disintegrant (about 2% in the outside powders). Fill the<br>
finished powders into hard gelatin capsules or compress said powder into tablets<br>
(followed by film coating the tablets as described below). The total weight of a capsule or<br>
tablet prepared in this manner is about 230 mg.<br>
Alternatively, to prepare a tablet, add the bulking agent, disintegrant, and the<br>
active ingredient to a mixer and blend to uniformly distribute the powders. Once the<br>
powders are uniformly distributed, add the lubricant and blend again. Transfer the<br>
blended material to a tablet compression machine to prepare the tablets which are<br>
subsequently film coated with an appropriate film forming agent.<br><br>
Biological Assays<br>
Estrogen Receptor Binding Assay: Representative compounds of the present<br>
invention are screened for binding affinity to both estrogen receptor types (ERα and ERβ).<br>
This competition binding assay measures the compound's ability to displace 3H-estradiol<br>
and generates IC50 and Ki values for both receptor types.<br>
This competition binding assay is run in a buffer containing 50mM Hepes, pH 7.5,<br>
1.5mM EDTA, 150mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1mg/mL ovalbumin and 5mM DTT, using<br>
0.025 μCi per well 3H-Estradiol (NEN #NET517 at 118 Ci/mmol, 1 mCi/mL), 10 ng/well<br>
ERa or ERP receptor (PanVera). A compound of the present invention is added at 10<br>
different concentrations. Non-specific binding is determined in the presence of 1 μM of<br>
17-β Estradiol. The binding reaction (140 μl) is incubated for 4 hours at room<br>
temperature, then 70 ul of cold DCC buffer is added to each reaction (DCC buffer<br>
contains per 50 mL of assay buffer, 750 mg of charcoal (Sigma) and 250 mg of dextran<br>
(Pharmacia)). Plates are mixed 8 minutes on an orbital shaker at 4°C. Plates are then<br>
centrifuged at 3,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 minutes. An aliquot of 120 ui of the mix is<br>
transferred to another 96-well, white flat bottom plate (Costar) and 175 ui of Wallac<br>
Optiphase "Hisafe 3" scintillation fluid is added to each well. Plates are sealed and<br>
shaken vigorously on an orbital shaker. After an incubation of 2.5 hours, the plates are<br>
read in a Wallac Microbeta counter. The data is used to calculate an IC50 and %<br>
Inhibition at 10 μM. The Kd for 3H-Estradiol is determined by saturation binding to ERα<br>
and ERβ receptors. The IC50 values for test compounds are converted to Kj using Cheng-<br>
Prusoff equation and the K4 determined by saturation binding assay.<br>
Ishikawa Cell Proliferation Assay: This assay measures cell proliferation (using<br>
an alkaline phosphatase readout) in both an agonist mode in the presence of a compound<br>
of the present invention alone, and in an antagonist mode in which the ability of a<br>
compound of the present invention to block estradiol stimulation of growth is measured.<br>
Ishikawa human endometrial tumor cells are maintained in MEM (minimum<br>
essential medium, with Earle's salts and L-Glutamine, Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD),<br>
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (V/V), (Gibco BRL). One day prior to<br>
assay, growth media is changed to assay medium, DMEM/F-12 (3:1) (Dulbecco's<br><br>
Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient Mixture F-12, 3:1 Mixture, phenol red-free, Gibco<br>
BRL) supplemented with 5% dextran coated charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum (DCC-<br>
FBS) (Hyclone, Logen, UT), L-Glutamine (2mM), MEM sodium pyruvate (1 mM),<br>
HEPES (N-p-hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N' - [2-ethanesulfonic acid] 2 mM) all from<br>
Gibco BRL). After an overnight incubation, Ishikawa cells are rinsed with Dulbecco's<br>
Phosphate Buffered Saline (1X) (D-PBS) without Ca+2 and Mg+2 (Gibco BRL), and<br>
trypsinized by a 3 minute incubation with 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA, phenol red-free (Gibco<br>
BRL). Cells are resuspended in assay medium and adjusted to 250,000 cells/mL.<br>
Approximately 25,000 cells in a 1 OOul media are added to flat-bottom 96 wells<br>
microculture plates (Costar 3596) and incubated at 37'C in a 5% CO2 humidified<br>
incubator for 24 hours. The next day, serial dilutions of compounds are prepared in assay<br>
medium (at 6 times the final concentration in the assay). The assay is run in dual mode,<br>
agonist and antagonist modes.<br>
For the agonist mode, plates receive 25 μl/well of assay medium followed by 25<br>
μl/well of a diluted compound of the present invention (at 6x the final concentrations).<br>
For the antagonist mode, plates receive 25 |d/well of 6 nM E2 (p-Estradiol, Sigma, St.<br>
Louis, MO) followed by 25 ul/well of a diluted compound of the present invention (at 6x<br>
the final concentrations). After an additional 48-hour incubation at 37ºC in a 5% CO2<br>
humidified incubator, media is aspirated from wells and 100 μl fresh assay medium is<br>
added to each microculture. Serial dilutions of compounds are prepared and added to the<br>
cells as described above. After an additional 72 hour incubation at 37'C in a 5% CO2<br>
humidified incubator, the assay is quenched by removing media and rinsing plates twice<br>
in Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (IX) (D-PBS) (Gibco BRL). The plates are<br>
dried for 5 minutes and frozen at -70°C for at least 1 hour. The plates are then removed<br>
from the freezer and allowed to thaw at room temperature. To each well, 100 μl of 1-<br>
Step™ PNPP (Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, DL) is added. After a 20-minute<br>
incubation, plates are read on a spectophotometer at 405nm.<br>
The data is fitted to a linear interpolation to derive EC50 (for agonist mode) or<br>
IC50 (for antagonist mode) values. For the antagonist mode, a % efficacy for each<br>
compound is calculated versus E2 (1nM) alone. For the agonist mode, a % efficacy for<br>
each compound is calculated versus the response to tamoxifen.<br><br>
In the agonist mode, the compounds of Examples 3-6, 8,10,12,14,16,18,21,23,<br>
25,27, 29, 32, 34,36,39, 43,46,49, 53,56, 58, 59, 61,63, 65,67,70-73, 75, 78,80, 82,<br>
86, 89, 92, 94, 97,99,101,103 and 105 were tested and were found to be less stimulatory<br>
than tamoxifen. For example, the compound of Example 56 had a relative % efficacy of<br>
71.8%. In the antagonist mode, these same compounds inhibited greater than at least 70%<br>
of the 1nM estradiol response. For example, the compound of Example 16 had an IC50<br>
of 35.2 nM and a % efficacy of 106.7%.<br>
MCF-7 Proliferation Assay- The MCF-7 cell line was derived from a human<br>
breast adenocarcinoma and is used as an indicator of potential antiproliferative activity in<br>
breast epithelium.<br>
MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC HTB 22) are maintained in MEM<br>
(minimal essential medium, phenol red-free, Gibco BRL) supplemented with 10% fetal<br>
bovine serum (FBS) (V/V), L-glutamine (2 mM), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), HEPES ((N-<br>
[2-hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N'-[2-ethanesulfonic acid]10 mM}, non-essential amino<br>
acids(0.1mM)and Penicillin Streptomycin(lX). Seven days prior to assay, MCF-7 cells<br>
are switched to assay media which is the same as maintenance medium except<br>
supplemented with 10% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (DCC-FBS)<br>
assay medium in place of 10% FBS. MCF-7 cells are removed from flasks using 1 OX<br>
Trypsin EDTA (phenol red free, Gibco BRL) and diluted to IX in (Ca++/Mg++ free<br>
HBSS (phenol red-free). Cells are adjusted to 80,000 cells/mL in assay medium.<br>
Approximately 8,000 cells (100 μl) are added to each well in 96 well Cytostar T<br>
scintillation plates (Amersham) and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator<br>
for 24 hours to allow cell adherence and equilibration after transfer.<br>
Serial dilutions of a compound of the present invention are prepared in assay<br>
medium at 4x the final desired concentration). A 50 μl aliquot of test compound dilutions<br>
(at 4x the final assay concentration) is transferred to duplicate wells followed by 50 μl .<br>
assay medium for the agonist mode or 50 μl of 40pM of E2 for the antagonist mode to a<br>
final volume of 200 μl. For each of the agonist plates, a basal level (media) and a<br>
maximum stimulated level (with 1μM E2) is determined. For each of the antagonist<br>
plates, a basal level (media) and an E2 (10pM) alone control is determined. After an<br><br>
additional 48 hours at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator, 20μl of assay medium<br>
containing 0.01 μCi of 14C-thymidine (52 mCi/mmol, 50 μCi/μl, Amersham) is added to<br>
each well. The plates are incubated overnight in the same incubator and men counted on<br>
the Wallac Microbeta counter. The data is averaged to calculate an IC50 and % inhibition<br>
@ 1μM for the antagonist mode. For the agonist mode, an ECSO and percent of<br>
maximum E2 stimulation and concentration of maximum stimulation is calculated.<br>
3-Day Rat Uterus Antagonist Assay: This model for uterine antagonism utilizes<br>
immature (3 week old) female rats that are highly sensitive to estrogenic stimulation of<br>
the uterus given that their circulating estrogen levels are prepubertal. The uteri from<br>
immature rats are fully responsive to exogenous estrogen, yet are quiescent in the absence<br>
of exogenous estrogen. Administration of exogenous estrogen to immature rats produces<br>
a reliable elevation of uterine weight, which can be used to study uterine antagonist<br>
effects. The rats are treated with both estradiol and 4 different concentrations of a<br>
compound of the present invention for 3 days and then uterine wet weights are measured.<br>
Nineteen to twenty-one day old (or 45-50g) female rats are orally treated with E2<br>
(0.1 mg/kg, a maximal stimulatory estrogenic stimulus for reliably increasing uterine<br>
weight) and 10,1.0, 0.1 and 0.01 mg/kg test compound for 3 days, 6 rats per group. Test<br>
compounds are dissolved in 20% β-hydroxycyclodextrin and administered by oral gavage<br>
in a volume of 0.2 mL daily (15 min. prior to the ethynyl estradiol gavage). A vehicle<br>
control, E2 alone and £2 + raloxifene are also done as controls. The animals are fasted<br>
overnight following the final dose. On the following morning, the animals are weighed,<br>
then euthanized (by carbon dioxide asphyxiation) and the uteri rapidly collected (via a<br>
mid-line ventral incision) and weighed.<br>
Uterine weight/body weight ratios (UWR) are calculated for each animal. The<br>
percent inhibition of the estrogen-induced response is then calculated by the following<br>
formula: percent inhibition = 100 x (UWRestrogen - UWRtest compound-/UWRestrogen<br>
- UWRcontrol)- ED50 values are derived from a semi-log regression analysis of the<br>
linear aspect of the dose response curve. Both the UWR data and the percent inhibition<br>
data were statistically analyzed by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc<br><br>
testing by Fisher's PLSD when indicated by a p ≤0.05. Statistical analyses are performed<br>
using the Statview® 4.0 software package.<br>
The compounds of Examples 4-6,12,14,18, 21,23,27,29,32, 34,39,43,46, 53,<br>
56, 58, 59, 61,65,70, 78, 86, 89,92, 99,101 and 103 were tested in the above assay and<br>
were found to inhibit the estrogen-induced response when administered at 1.0 mg/kg. For<br>
example, the compound of Example 92 had an ED50 of 0.53 mpk and a % antagonism of<br>
62.7%.<br>
4-Day OVXRat Uterine Agonist Assay. In order to assure that a test compound<br>
does not have any partial uterine agonist activity, compounds are administered to mature,<br>
ovariectomized rats.<br>
Seventy-five day old rats are ovariectomized and treatment is started 14 days later<br>
when circulating estradiol levels have reached minimal levels. After 4 days of treatment<br>
with 3 doses of a compound of the present invention, (6 rats per group) body weight,<br>
uterine wet weight and uterine eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) activity are measured.<br>
Cholesterol levels are also measured to compare relative ability to lower cholesterol with<br>
other SERMs. If there is any question of uterine stimulation, histological examination<br>
will determine epithelial cell height.<br>
The compounds of Examples 4 and 14 were tested in the above assay and did not<br>
cause dose-related statistically significant increases in EPO activity.<br>
10-Day Rat Hormone (Ovarian Stimulation) Screen: An initial, first screen for<br>
ovarian toxicity is conducted using a 10-day rat hormone study to measure estradiol and<br>
luteinizing hormone levels after compound administration. This screen is conducted by<br>
administering compound by oral gavage for 10 days to mature (9-10 week old) F344<br>
female rats. Trunk blood is collected by rapid decapitation for evaluation of LH and<br>
estradiol levels approximately 2 hours after the 10th dose. Serum, obtained by<br>
centrifugation, is removed and stored frozen below -60°C until assayed. Serum levels of<br>
LH and estradiol are measured using radioimmunoassay (RIA) methods.<br>
Rat LH primary antibody and reference preparations (rat LH:RP-3) were obtained<br>
from Dr. A. F. Parlow, Director, Pituitary Hormones and Antisera Center, Harbor-UCLA<br><br>
Medical Center, Torrance, CA. The LH assay upper limits of detection were 30 ng/mL<br>
and the lower limits of detection were 0.1 ng/mL for the 100 pi samples.<br>
E2 Clinical Assays. DiaSorin s.r.l., Saluggia (Vercelli), Italy. The upper limit of<br>
detection was 1000 pg/mL and the lower limit of detection was 5 pg/mL.<br>
The compounds of Examples 4-6, 14, 21 and 103 were tested in the above assay<br>
and did not significantly elevate circulating estradiol or LH levels.<br>
35-Day Ovary-Intact Rat Bone Assay: While previous SERMs, including<br>
raloxifene have shown efficacy in preventing bone loss in OVX rats, the possibility of<br>
interference with estrogen-regulated turnover in ovary-intact rats needs to be addressed.<br>
This assay is done in mature rats with concentrations based on the demonstrated<br>
efficacy in the 3-day assay. Generally, at least three concentrations are chosen based on<br>
multiples of the ED50 generated therein. These multiples are generally 1x, 10x and 30x<br>
the ED50. A compound of the present invention is administered to an OVX rat for 35<br>
days and is compared to control, ovariectomized, and/or GnRH-administered rats.<br>
Femurs, tibiae, uteri, ovaries and serum are taken for further analyses. DEXA (Dual<br>
Energy X-ray Absorptivity), CT (Computed Tomography) and histologic analysis are<br>
done on the long bones to assess any changes. CT scans of the distal femur are done to<br>
calculate BMD (bone mineral density), cross sectional area and BMC (bone mineral<br>
content). Bone strength measurements (load to failure) may also be done to determine<br>
consequences of any bone mass or material changes. Uterine and ovarian histology are<br>
examined to confirm long term dosing effects of uterine efficacy and potential ovarian<br>
stimulation. The serum is analyzed for LH and E2 levels as a possible indicator of<br>
ovarian effects.<br>
