The embodiment of the invention resides in the circuitry which in turn is controlled by panel of switches.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention resides in the flickering light emitting device and speaker on the said device.<br>
The object of the invention resides in emitting and receiving-circuit of radio-magnetic waves coupled with microwave field detector meter to detect the direction of the movement of visually impaired or partially visually impaired person.<br>
Another object of the invention resides in the electrically charging effect indicator circuit to forewarning the person against the presence of any electrically charged object ahead.<br>
Yet another object of the subject invention resides in the presence of water and moisture sensing circuit and infra-red rays emmitting and receiving circuit.<br>
Considering the various problems associated with the life of a visually impaired or partially visually impaired person, the device of subject invention is a useful help enabling the visually impaired or partially visually impaired person to move freely without hurting himself by receiving alarming beeps cautioning him against any unforeseen danger whether stationary or moving. As seen normally the visually impaired or partially visually impaired person is carrying a stick whether made up of wood, plastic or steel folded or otherwise attched thereto with a bell, which the visually impaired or partially visually impaired person operates manually to warn others of his presence. Moreover, the visually impaired or partially visually impaired person with the help of stick can never detect the danger ahead and shall come to know when his stick hits the object coming on the way or the visually impaired or partially visually impaired person dashed himself against that object and hurt himself<br><br>
in this process. Most commonly seen mishappenings with the visually impaired or partially visually impaired persons are that they are not aware of any electrically chaged object coming on their way and by the time they comes to know about it its always too late to guard themselves against such objects. Moreover the visually impaired or partially visually impaired person can also possibly not protect himself from the water, mud or other interferences coming on its way. To overcome all these aforementioned problems, the device of subject invention has been devised, which is very easily operatable.<br>
The device of subject invention is provided with switch devices, which are so positioned so that the grip of the visually impaired or partially visually impaired person's hand on the device does not loose the grip while operating the electronic circuit.<br>
The object of the invention resides in the flickering light and siren placed on the device to make other people realize the presence of a visually impaired or partially visually impaired person around them.<br>
The power supply to the battery is arranged by the attachment of chargeable cells to power battery which are further attached to solar panels placed in the hollow of the device so as to give smooth finish to the device from outer side. The chips of the solar panels are made up preferably of silicone which generates approximately Qvolts and 100 amperes of current even if the device is not receiving direct sunlight. The energy from the solar cells enables all the circuits placed in the device to work by means of regulating supply circuit.<br>
The circuit used in the subject invention to make the invention work are :-<br>
1)	solar panel and regulator power supply circuit<br>
2)	light emitting device flickering circuit<br>
3)	siren circuit<br>
4)	vibrator circuit<br>
5)	water sensing circuit<br><br>
6)	electrified sensor circuit<br>
7)	Infra-red transmitter circuit<br>
8)	Electropulse two sound phone converter circuit<br>
())	Signal amplifier circuit<br>
10)	Light Directing.Resistance Circuit<br>
I 1)	Radio frequency transmission oscillator circuit<br>
The aforementioned circuitary is developed by using cost-effective, easily available resistance, papercondensor, electrolyte condensor, preset resistence, silicone chips , power regulator I.C. , L.D.R., P.N.P., N.P.N. transistor radio frequency choke, chargeable cells, micro-switch, electrivc miniature motor, slide-switch, buzzer, speaker, ear-phone, probe, Infrared filter amplifier , I.C., D.C.amplifier.<br>
The object of the invention resides in that the device with such circuitary when operated gives beep/siren to forewarn the visually impaired or partially visually impaired person against any object heading towards him, or he is approaching that<br>
object.<br>
The other object of the invention is that it enables the visually impaired or partially visually impaired person to detect the condition of the road/ground/floor against the presence of water or mud.<br>
Another object of the invention resides in transmitting the waves of a special frequency and thus sending alarming beeps to the receiving station through a receiver.<br>
The device of the present invention when operated enables the visually impaired or partially visually impaired person to detect that some object is coming on its way with the help of a circuit consisting of plurality of infra-red transmitters<br>
First circuit detects the object coming on the way of visually impaired or partially visually impaired person from a long distance or is heading towards the visually impaired or partially visually impaired person. In this circuit multivibrational waves<br><br>
from the vibrator I.C. are directed tolnfra-red diods, which projects infra-red rays at the right angles of the device of the visually impaired or partially visually impaired person in the range of approximately 50 meters. These rays when hits the object coming on its way are.reflected and received by I.N. receiver circuit of infra-red foto sensor. The photosensor then transmits the waves according to their shape in electric signals. These electric signals after transmitting through D.C. amplifier circuit are ehanged into sound signals. The sound signals are then heard by the visually impaired or partially visually impaired person with the help of ear phone or through the speaker by applying sound amplifier circuit.<br>
Such circuit also enables the visually impaired or partially visually impaired person to detect whether the object is stationary or moving.<br>
Second I.R. transmeter and receiver fitted in this circuit is of low capacity which enables the detection of walls of lower height , any stone on the road, any sewarage etc. The working of second circuit is like that of first one but the placement of this circuit is different from the first circuit The second circuit is placed at 120 Degrees Specity  <br><br>
In the third circuit the I.R. tone is different from that of first and second circuit and is placed at the bottom of the device. This apprise the visually impaired or partially visually impaired person with the presence of any manhole or uneven surfaces etc. A multivibrator circuit is also attached in such a manner that whenever there is a marginal gap between the bottom of the device and the surface of the road , the waves emitted from I.R. sensor are transmitted into a tone with the help of opersonal I.C.. The I.C. waves which are reflected from the bottom of the hole is below the surface of the earth . In the absence of this arrangement one cannot possibly judge the gap between the road and the depth of the hole.<br>
A circuit has also been developed to guide a person about the condition of the road or ground or of anyother surface on which he is walking with the help of water and moisture sensing device. In this circuit a water and moist detector circuit has been placed at the bottom of the device This circuit acknowledges the presence of water or<br><br>
mud by transmitting the tone signals to sound signals. The tone signals are transmitted from vibrator signal when some object interfers between two conductors placed at the bottom of the device.<br>
For siren and flickering light two circuits are used. In the flickering light circuit a Hasher or any other light emitting device is placed at the output of the circuit. Similarly transistorized siren circuit is also attached in the circuit which sends beeps warning others of the presence of a visually impaired or partially visually impaired person around them.<br>
The most important object of the subject invention is that it provides security and confidance to the visually impaired or partially visually impaired person when walking on unfamiliar roads. To achieve this a special transmitter circuit is placed in the device which transmits radio-magnetic waves. The radio-magnetic waves are adjusted to be of such a frequency so as not to interfere with the police-wireless , radio hand, F.M. band, T.V. specturm and cordless phones etc. At the time of emergency when the visually impaired or partially visually impaired person presses the switch on the switch panel of the device it starts transmitting radio-magnetic waves with the help of microwave transmeter circuit oscillation by high frequency power transistor.The moment the visually impaired or partially visually impaired person Ilickeres the switch , radio magnetic waves of special frequency starts transmitting which are received by the receiver circuit placed at the residence of the visually impaired or partially visually impaired person. This receiver helps the other person to detect the direction where the visually impaired or partially visually impaired person might have lost with the help of microwave field detector meter.<br>
Most mishappenings occured with visually impaired or partially visually impaired person are, that, unknowingly they dashed themselves against any electrically charged object to avoid such situation, in the subject device a electrically charged effect indicator circuit is placed which will give beep to the visually impaired or partially visually impaired person when while moving the device of the visually impaired or partially visually impaired person comes close to such electrically charged object,<br><br>
where the current is coming on the outer surface of the body at a distance of about 2-3<br>
feets.<br>

In this circuitry as shown in figure 1, three pairs of Infra-red diodes output (1,2 and 3) are placed. The circuit diagram of which is depicted by figure 3. For Infra-red diodes<br><br>
output signals, transistorized tone generator circuits (1 A, 2A and 3A) are placed, such signals are received by Infra-red sensor receiver (1B, 2B and 3B). Attached to these receivers are Infra-red Sensor photo transistor. All these connections are depicetd in figure 4. In this circuitry a Light emitting device circuit (4) and speaker (5) is also attached. The ciruit enabling the working of light emitting device and siren is depicted in figure 5. Such Infra-red radiations when reflects back from any object, are transmitted to audio signal mixture circuit (7), from where it is transmitted to distributor switch (8). The distributor switch (8) is attached to audio amplifier(9) and earphone (11) or the audio amplifier is attached to speaker (12).<br>
A circuit of subject invention also enables to guide a person about the condition of the road or ground or of anyother surface on which he is walking with the help of water and moisture sensing device. In this circuit a water and moist detector circuit has been placed at the bottom of the device This circuit acknowledges the presence of water or mud by transmitting the tone signals to sound signals. The tone signals are transmitted from vibrator signal when some object interfers between two conductors placed at the bottom of the device.<br>
