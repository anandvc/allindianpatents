				<td>Description AMIDE DERIVATIVE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel amide derivative useful for a pharmaceutical agent, more particularly a prophylaxis and a therapeutic treatment of diseases in which herpesvirus is involved.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Viruses belonging to the Herpesviridae family cause various infectious diseases in human and animals. For example, it is known that varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella and herpes zoster, and herpes simplex viruses of types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) cause infections such as herpes labialis, genital herpes, etc., respectively. In recent years, additionally, infectious diseases caused by herpesviruses such as cytomegalovlrus (CMV), EB virus (Epstein-Barr virus; EBV), human herpesviruses 6, 7 and 8, etc. have been elucidated.<br>
Currently, pharmaceutical drugs of nucleic acid series, such as acyclovir (ACV) and its prodrugs, i.e., valacyclovir (VCV), fancyclovir (FCV), etc., are used as drugs against herpesviruses such as VZV and HSV. These pharmaceutical drugs of nucleic acid series are mono-<br><br>
phosphorylated into nucleoside monophosphates by viral thymidine kinase encoded by VZV or HSV and are subsequently converted into triphosphate compounds by cellular enzymes. Finally, the tri-phosphorylated nucleoside analogues are incorporated during the replication of the viral genomes by herpesvirus DNA polymerase, to suppress the extension reaction of the viral DNA chains. Since the reaction mechanism of the existing anti-herpesvirus agents is based on the effect of the "competitive inhibition" toward deoxynucleoslde triphosphate, as described above, it is necessary to use these drugs at a high concentration for the exertion of their antiviral effects. Actually, these anti-herpesvirus drugs of nucleic acid series are clinically administered at a dose as high as several hundreds in mg to several grams per day. Since these drugs of nucleic acid series are readily incorporated into the genome DNA of a host via the host DNA polymerase, further, the mutagenicity thereof draws concerns.<br>
On the other hand, lately, several pharmaceutical drugs of non-nucleic acid series and with anti-herpesvirus activity have been reported. For example, there is disclosed an amide or sulfonamide derivative suppressing the HSV helicase-primase enzyme complex to show anti-HSV-1 activity and anti-CMV activity, as represented by the following Formula (G), wherein the N atom is substituted with a thiazolylphenylcarbamoylmethyl group or the like<br><br>
(Patent Reference 1). However, the anti-VZV activity of these compounds is not specifically disclosed therein.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
(In the formula, R is hydrogen, a lower alkyl, amino, lower alkylamino or the like; R2 is hydrogen or a lower alkyl; Q may not exist or when it exists, Q represents a methylene; R3 is hydrogen, a lower alkyl or the like; R4 is an unsubstituted or substituted phenyl (lower) alkyl, 1-indanyl , 2 - indanyl , ( lower cycloalkyl ) - ( lower alkyl ) , (Het)- (lower alkyl) or the like; R5 is a phenylsulf onyl , 1-or 2 -naphthylsulf onyl, ( Het )-sulf onyl, (unsubstituted or substituted phenyl) -Y-(CH2)nC(O), (Het) -(CH2)nC(O) or the like, wherein Y is O or S and n is 0, 1 or 2; see the Reference for details . )<br>
Further, there is disclosed an amide or sulfonamide derivative having anti-HSV-1 activity and anti-CMV activity as represented by the following Formula (H) wherein the nitrogen atom is substituted with a<br>
thiazolylphenylcarbamoylmethyl group (Patent Reference 2). However, the anti-VZV activity of these compounds is not specifically disclosed therein.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
 (In the formula, R1 is NH2; R2 is H; R3 is H; R4 is CH2Ph, CH2-(4-pyridyl), CH2-cyclohexyl or the like; and R5 is CO-(substituted phenyl), C0-(unsubstituted or substituted hetero ring) or the like; see the Publication for details.)<br>
The present inventors previously found an amide compound substituted with a thiazolylphenylcarbamoylmethyl group and with favorable anti-VZV activity, as represented by the following formula where the nitrogen atom of the amide group is substituted directly with an aromatic group aryl or heteroaryl group, or the salt thereof. Thus, the inventors filed a patent application (Patent Reference 3).<br>

Still now, it is strongly desired to create an anti-herpesvirus drug with a satisfactory anti-herpesvirus activity and of non-nucleic acid series, which is highly safe at a low dose and suitable for oral administration.<br>
DISCLOSURE OP THE INVENTION<br>
The inventors carried out intensive studies about a compound having an anti-herpesvirus action. As a result, the inventors found that a novel amide derivative as shown by the following general formula (I), wherein a 1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl, 4-oxazolyl, l,2,3-triazol-2-yl or 2-pyridyl group is introduced as Z in the ring structure in place of the conventional amino-substituted thiazole ring, unexpectedly had a favorable anti-herpesvirus activity. Thus, the invention has been achieved. Compared with the conventional anti-herpesvirus drugs, the compound of the invention has great pharmacokinetics in biological organisms and shows an excellent anti-virus activity when<br>
administered orally even at a low dose. Additionally, the compound of the invention draws less mutagenic concerns and has a high safety profile, unlike the pharmaceutical drugs of nucleic acid series.<br>

Typical methods for producing the compound of the invention are described below.<br>
In the following production methods, it is sometimes effective from the viewpoint of the production technique to replace a certain functional group depending on the type with an appropriate protective group, namely a group readily convertible to the functional group, at the stage of a raw material or intermediate. Afterwards, the protective group can be eliminated, if necessary, to obtain the desired compound. Examples of such a functional group includes an amino group, hydroxyl group, carboxyl group and the like. Protective groups thereof are, for example, those described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, the third edition (T. W. Green and P. G. M. Wuts, eds., JOHN WILLY &amp; SONS, INC.). These may be appropriately used depending on the reaction conditions. For introducing and eliminating such protective groups, the methods described in the reference can be suitably applied.<br>
First Production Method<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Compound (I) can be easily produced by subjecting Carboxylic Acid Compound (III) and Aniline Derivative (II) to an amidation reaction.<br>
The amidation reaction can be carried out by general methods. For example, the method described in "Courses in Experimental Chemistry" edited by the Chemical Society of Japan, the fourth edition (Maruzen), Vol.22, pp.137-173 may be applicable. Preferably, the reaction is carried out by converting Carboxylic Acid Compound (III) to a reactive derivative such as an acid halide (acid chloride, etc.) or an acid anhydride, and then reacting the resulting reactive derivative with Aniline Derivative (II). In the case of using a reactive derivative of carboxylic acid, a base [an inorganic base such as potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, etc. or an organic base such as triethylamine (TEA), diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, etc.] is preferably added. In addition, the amidation reaction may be carried out by reacting carboxylic acid in the presence of a condensation agent [l-ethyl-3-(3-<br>
dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (WSC), 1,1'-carbonylbis-IH-imidazole (GDI), etc.]. In this case, additives such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), etc. may be added. The reaction temperature can be appropriately selected depending on the raw material compound used. The solvent usable includes those inert to the reaction, for example, aromatic hydrocarbon-series solvents such as benzene.<br>
toluene, etc.; ether-series solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), 1,4-dioxane, etc.; halogenated hydrocarbon-series solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, etc.; amide-series solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N,N-dimethylacetamide, etc.; basic solvents such as pyridine, etc.; and the like. The solvent is appropriately selected depending on the -type of the raw material compound and the like, and can be used alone or as a mixture of two or more of them. Second Production Method<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Compound (I) is obtained by subjecting an amine compound represented by general formula (IV) and carboxylic acid or Sulfonic Acid Compound (V) to an amidation reaction or sulfonamidation reaction.<br>
The amidation can be carried out in the same manner as in the first method.<br>
The sulfonamidation reaction can be carried out according to a usual method by reacting Amine Compound (IV) with a reactive derivative of sulfonic acid of Compound (V). Examples of a reactive derivative of sulfonic acid include acid halides (acid chloride, acid bromide, etc.).<br>
acid anhydrides (sulfonic acid anhydride prepared from two molecules of sulfonic acid), acid azides and the like. Such a reactive derivative of sulfonic acid can be easily obtained from a corresponding sulfonic acid according to a method generally used. When an acid halide is used as the reactive derivative, the reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a base (inorganic bases such as sodium hydroxide, sodium hydride, etc. or organic bases such as pyridine, TEA, diisopropylethylamine, etc.). In the case of using such a reactive derivative as an acid anhydride, acid azide. etc., the reaction can be carried out in the absence of a base. In some cases, the reaction may be carried out in the presence of an inorganic base such as sodium hydride, etc. or an organic base such as TEA, pyridine, 2,6-lutidine, etc. The reaction temperature is appropriately selected depending on the kind of the sulfonic acid reactive derivative and the like. As a solvent, solvents inert to the reaction, for example, those exemplified for amidatlon in the above first method can be employed.<br>
In addition, depending on the kind of the substituent, the desired Compound (I) can be prepared by subjecting to a substituent modification reaction, which is well known by those skilled in the art. For example, known reactions such as the aforementioned amidation, sulfonamidation, N-alkylation described in "Courses in<br>
Experimental Chemistry" edited by the Chemical Society of Japan (Maruzen), and the like can be suitably applied. The order of the reactions may be altered depending on the compound desired and the kind of the reaction applied.<br>
The aforementioned raw material compounds can be easily produced using known reactions, e.g., those described in "Courses in Experimental Chemistry" edited by the Chemical Society of Japan (Maruzen), in the pamphlet of the International Publication WO 02/38554, and the like. The typical production methods thereof are described below. Production method of Compound (III)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
 (In the formula, R means a group capable of forming an ester residue, such as a lower alkyl group, aralkyl group, etc.; and P means a protective group of an amino group, such as a fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) group, etc.)<br>
In the reaction scheme above, amidation can be carried out in the same manner as in the above first production method, and sulfonamidation in the same manner as in the second production method.<br>
N-alkylation of Compound (VI) can be carried out using Halogenated Alkyl Compound (VII) according to usual methods, e.g., the method described in the aforementioned "Courses in Experimental Chemistry", the fourth edition (Maruzen), Vol.20, pp.279-318. The reaction can be carried out under the temperature of from cooling to heating. Examples of the solvent usable Include solvents inert to the reaction, for example, those exemplified for the amidation in the first production method, etc. The reaction is carried out preferably in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, sodium hydride, etc. Herein, the amidation may be first carried out and subsequently, the N-alkylation may be carried out.<br>
Deprotection for obtaining Carboxylic Acid Compound (III) can be carried out by appropriately applying a general method depending on the ester type. In the case of alkyl esters such as an ethyl ester, etc., the deprotection can be preferably carried out by treating them with a base such as sodium hydroxide aqueous solution, etc. In the case of aralkyl esters such as a benzyl ester, etc., the deprotection can be carried out by reducing them with palladium-carbon (Pd-C) under hydrogen atmosphere. The<br><br>
reactions can be carried out according to the method described in the aforementioned "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", the third edition.<br>
Deprotection for obtaining Amine Compound (IV) is carried out by appropriately applying a general method depending on the type of the protective group. For example, the method described in the aforementioned "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", the third edition, pp. 503-572 can be applied.<br>
A desired raw material compound can be produced by subjecting the compound with a certain substituent type to a substituent modification reaction well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Various isomers can be isolated according to the usual method by utilizing the difference of physicochemical properties among them. For example, a racemic compound can be led to a stereochemically pure isomer by the generally used optical resolution method [e.g., a method of producing a diastereomeric salt with a general optically active acid (tartaric acid, etc.) and subjecting the salt to optical resolution, or other methods]. Further, diastereomer mixtures can be isolated, for example, by fractional crystallization, chromatography or the like, and optically active compounds can be produced by using a suitable optically active raw material.<br><br>
The compound of the invention obtained in this manner is isolated and purified in its free form or as a salt thereof after a salt formation process by a general method. The isolation and purification are carried out by employing general chemical procedures such as extraction, concentration, evaporation, crystallization, filtration, recrystallization, various chromatographic techniques and the like.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the Invention, which contains as effective components one type or two or more types of the compound of the invention, can be prepared according to a method usually used by using pharmaceutical carriers, exciplents and the like for general use in this field. Administration thereof may be either oral via tablets, pills, capsules, granules, powders, liquids, etc. or parenteral dosing via injections such as intravenous injections, intramuscular injections, etc., external agents such as ointments, plasters, creams, jellies, cataplasm, sprays, lotions, eye drops, eye ointments, etc., suppositories, inhalation agents, and the like.<br>
As the solid composition for oral administration, tablets, powders, granules and the like are used. In such a solid composition, one or more active substances are mixed with at least one inert excipient, for example, lactose, mannitol, glucose, hydroxypropyl cellulose.<br><br>
microcrystalline cellulose, starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, magnesium metasilicate aluminate, etc. According to general methods, the composition may contain inert additives such as lubricants, e.g., magnesium stearate, etc.; disintegrators, e.g., sodium carboxymethyl starch, etc.; and dissolution auxiliary agents. The tablets or pills may be coated with sugar coating or stomach-soluble or enteric coating.<br>
Examples of the liquid composition for oral administration include pharmaceutically-acceptable emulsions, liquids, suspensions, syrups, elixirs, etc., in which inert solvents for general use such as purified water, ethanol, etc. can be incorporated. In addition to the inert solvents, the composition may further contain auxiliary agents such as solubllizing agents, moistening agents and suspending agents; sweetening agents; flavoring agents; aromatic agents and preservatives.<br>
Examples of the injections for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous liquids, suspensions and emulsions. The aqueous solvents include, for example, distilled water for injections and physiological saline. The non-aqueous solvents include, for example, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, alcohols such as ethanol, Polysorbate 80 (under trade name) and the like. Such compositions may further contain isotonic agents.<br><br>
preservatives, moistening agents, emulsifying agents, dispersing agents, stabilizers and dissolution auxiliary agents. These are sterilized by filtering through bacteria-retaining filters, by incorporating sterilizing agents, or by irradiation. Alternatively, these may be produced into a sterile solid composition and then dissolved or suspended in sterile water or sterile solvents for injections prior to us.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention comprising an amide derivative or a salt thereof along with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is found to show surprising property. Therefore the pharmaceutical compound is synergistic.<br>

For intravenous administration, the daily does is about 0.0001 to 10 mg/kg/body weight, preferably 0.001 to 1.0 mg/kg/body weight. The dose is administered once or in separate portions per day, and is appropriately determined depending<br>
on each case, in terms of the symptom, age, sex and the like. When the compound of the invention is to be used as an external agent, the agent containing the compound of the invention in an amount of 0.0001 to 20%, preferably 0.01 to 10%, is desirable.

The effects of the compound of the invention were confirmed by the following pharmacological tests. Test Example 1: Anti-VZV activity assay<br>
This assay was carried out in accordance with the method described by Shigeta S. (The Journal of Infectious Diseases, 147, 3, 576 - 584 (1983). Specifically, human embryonic fibroblast (HEF) cells were inoculated in a 96-<br>
well microtiter plate, using a growth culture medium [Eagle MEM (Nlssui) supplemented with- 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma)], for culturing in 5% C02 at 37°C for 4 days until a monolayer was formed. After washing the cells with a maintenance medium, the cells were Inoculated with 100 Hi/well of VZV (strain CaQu) which had been diluted to 20 to 30 pfu/100 |xl with the maintenance medium (Eagle MEM supplemented with 2% FBS). The plate was centrlfuged at 2,000 rpm for 20 minutes at room temperature and then Incubated at 37°C for 3 hours in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 to infect with VZV. After washing three times with the maintenance medium, 100 jil of each test drug diluted to an appropriate concentration with the maintenance medium was added to each well. After culturing the cells at 37°C for 3 to 4 days in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, the cells were fixed with 100 fil/well of 10% formalin/PBS for 2 to 3 hours. After the cells were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37°C for 3 to 4 days, 10% formalin/PBS was added at 100 nl/well to fix the cells for 2 to 3 hours. After discarding the fixing solution and culture supernatant and subsequently washing the plate with water, a staining solution (0.025% Crystal Violet) was added at 50 jil/well for staining for 2 to 3 minutes, and then, the plate was washed with water and dried at 37°C. Cellular death is induced in the HEF cells infected with VZV, so that plaques of the dead cells are formed in the monolayer of the HEF cells. The number of<br>
such plaques was counted with a microscope, to calculate the EC50 value of the test drug as a concentration to inhibit 50% of the plaques.<br>
Compared with acyclovir with the EC50 value of 3.4 MM, the ECSO values of the compounds in Examples 1, 11, 13, 27, 37, 39, 98 and 125 of the invention are 0.075, 0.060, 0.033, 0.10. 0.095, 0.082, 0.14 and 0.19 \M in this order. It was verified that the compounds of the Examples had great anti-VZV activity.<br>
Test Example 2: Anti-HSV-1 activity assay<br>
10,000 MRC-5 cells were inoculated and cultured in a 96-well microtiter plate, using the growth culture medium [Eagle MEM (Nlssui) supplemented with 10% FBS] in 5% CO2 at 37°C for 4 to 5 days until a monolayer was formed. After the cells were washed with the maintenance culture medium [Eagle MEM supplemented with 2% (v/v) FBS], 100 \il of the maintenance culture medium dissolving therein an appropriate concentration of a test reagent was added to each well. Immediately after the test drug was added, an HSV-1 (strain KOS) solution was inoculated at 50 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose)/100 jxl.<br>
After the cells were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37°C for 5 days, 20 M,! of MTT solution [3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl) -2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide; Sigma] (diluted with PBS to 7.5 mg/ml) was added to each well, for another 24-<br>
hour incubation. After the culture medium was discarded, 100 nl of a solvent (prepared by adding 10% Triton X 100 (v/v) and 0.4% hydrochloric acid to isopropanol) was added to each well, to solubilize the generated formazan. The absorbance at 540 nm or 690 nm was measured with a microplate reader. Based on the suppression ratio (%) of the cellular death of the MRC-5 cell via HSV-1 replication, the EC50 value of the test drug was calculated.<br>
Compared with acyclovlr with the EC50 value of 0.48 HM, the ECso values of the compounds of Examples 1, 11, 13, 27, 37, 39. 98 and 125 of the invention are 0.075, 0.040, 0.0060, 0.060. 0.026, 0.029, 0.042 and 0.028 [M in this order. It was verified that the compounds of the Examples had great anti-HSV activity.<br>
Test Example 3<br>
Using a cutaneous HSV-1 infection mouse model prepared in accordance with the method of H. Machida et al. (Antiviral Res., 1992, 17, 133 - 143), in vivo activity of the compounds of the invention was tested. The skin of each HR-1 hairless mouse [female, 7 weeks of age] was scratched lengthwise and breadthwise several times using a needle and a virus suspension (HSV-1 strain WT-51, 1.5 x 10* PFU/15 ^1) was droped to the scarified region for infection, while anesthetized with diethyl ether<br>
Tested compounds were administered orally as a methyl cellulose suspension, except for compounds marked with asterisk which were dissolved in 20% Cremophor EL (Nakarai Tesuku) / 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400 / 60% H2O solution, starting at 3 hours after the infection, and then at a dose of 10 mg/kg twice a day for 5 days. The symptom of the skin lesion caused by HSV-1 infection were classified in the following scores for 17 days:<br>
Score 0: no signs of infection.<br>
Score 1: localized, barely perceptible small vesicles.<br>
Score 2: slight vesicle spread.<br>
Score 3: large patches of vesicles formed.<br>
Score 4: zosteriform vesicles.<br>
Score 5: large patches of ulcers formed.<br>
Score 6: zosteriform with severe large ulcers.<br>
Score 7: hind limb paralysis or death.<br>
The AUC value was calculated from each group's mean disease score, and the disease inhibitory rate of the group administered with each test compound to the placebo group was calculated using the AUC. The results are shown in Table below.<br>
