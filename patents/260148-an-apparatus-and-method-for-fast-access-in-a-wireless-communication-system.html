|0027 j Turning specifically to Fig. 2, a methodology 200 that facilitates a fast access procedure in a wireless communication system (for example, OFDM or OFDMA systems) is illustrated The method may be used for initial access, synchronization when terminal is lost synchronization or is not in sync with access network, or handoff T he method starts at 202, an access probe is transmitted to the access network (Node B) In an aspect, the access probe is transmitted on random access channel (RACH) To rnirmpi/e the use of uplink resources, only a preamble is transmitted The preamble may include downlink CVI information {enables power control of an access grant message sent on the downlink in response to access probe, discussed below ), channel quality indicator feedback, QoS related information (enables scheduler to select and/or prioritize initial resource assignment), Random ID (reduces probability that identical access probes from different I His arrive at Node B at the same time) and Cell ID (used for scrambling access probe so that the probe is decoded successfully at the target Node B onh ) ?n access probe preamble comprises of an access sequence The access sequence is derived from I1H^s downlink O/l, QoS info and/or a random number used to possible collisions In an aspect, all access sequences are orthogonal The access sequence is scrambled before transmission h&gt; the cell specific scrambling sequence In another aspect, scrambling sequence is not only a function of cell ID but also in addition of cell ID a function of MAC1 ID (arty sort of L? (D ?s sufficient) <br><br>
|0028| In an aspect, after transmitting the access probe the method moves to<br><br>
204, a determination is made as to whether an access grant is recehed in response to the access probe Jf access grant is reeeh ed, the method moves to 206 after decoding the access grant using information from the access probe At 206, a connection open lequest message (for example, CurmectionQpep Request) is transmitted the method waits for response At 208. a connection open response message (COnIIeCIiOIiOpCnReSpOn4Se) is received in response to the connection open request message In another aspect, if the terminal is already assigned a MAC ID (for example when terminal is active state), method described at 206 and 208 may be eliminated and the terminal may start exchanging data with access network f O029J Referring hack to 204, if the access grant is not received after a predetermined time, the method moves to 208 At 210, a determi nation is made as to w hether a predetermined maximum number of retransmissions are reached if the maximum number of retransmission of access probe have occurred, then method moves to 212 At 2)2. transmit power is reset to original level and access probe is retransmitted The method moves to 204 to check if the access grant is received If the maximum number of retransmission of access probe was not reached, the method moves to 214 ?t 214, the access probe is retransmitted with higher power T he method mox es to 204 to check if the access grant is received<br><br>
|0030| With reference now to Fig. 3. an example methodology 300 that facilitates a receiving an access probe a wireless communications system is illustrated The method begins at iO2, an access probe comprising an access sequence is received If the access probe is successfully detected, then the method moves to 304 At 304, the access network generates an access gram The access giant h associated with the access probe and uses information from the received access probe lhe access network determines the parameters to provide to the terminal associated with the access probe to the terminal to exchange data with the access network The access grant, among other things, comprises terminal MAC ID. uplink resource assignment and uplink adjustments The access grant raa\ be scrambled and protected using error correction schemes If the access grant is transmitted on a broadcast channel to several terminals, then it may be scrambled using information from access probe, such that only the requestor is able decode the access grant 1-or example, the Node B scrambles the access <br><br>
grant with access preamble sequence it has received. Only the UE thai selected the corresponding access preamble sequence may decode the access grant. After the access grant is generated, at 306, the method transmits the access grant and waits for request for an open connection At 308, the open connection request message is received. After authenticating the terminal, at 310, the open connection response message is transmitted<br><br>
|0031] In another aspect methodologies illustrated in Fig 2-3 may be applied for handoiT scheme. The UC negotiates handoff with the source Node B. In parallel, the source Node B negotiates handoff with the target Node B. Before UE may start exchanging data on target Node B. UE transmits synchronization message towards the target node B Synchronization message consists of access preamble and it is transmitted on RACH Scrambling sequence is a function of target cell ID as its MAC H). When uplink synchronization is achieved, target Node B sends access grant to UE |00321 In another aspect methodologies illustrated in Fig 4-5 may be applied for synchronization Turning specifically to Fig. 4, a methodology 400 that facilitates a fast access procedure in a wireless communication system (for example, OFDM or OFDMA systems) is illustrated The method may be used for synchronization when terminal has lost synchronization or is no! in sync with access network or handoff. The method 400 is executed upon the terminal determining that it is not in sync with access network. The terminal may loose sync with access network if terminal transit?oped into sleep mode from active mode, deep fading, or during a handoff procedure. In an aspect, the method starts at 404, the access terminal transmits an access signature (may be referred to as access probe) to the access network (Node B). In an aspect, the access probe is transmitted on random access channel (RACII). The access probe may include downlink (71 information, channel quality indicator feedback, QoS related information, Random ?D, Cell ID or MAC ID flag. Since this method is for re- synchronization, the terminal may already have a MAC ID and does not need a new MAC ID from the access network. In an aspect, the MAC ID flag of access probe may be set to indicate that a new MAC ID is not desired or the MAO ID flag is not used. J0033| After transmitting the access probe the method moves to 406. the terminal receives an UL access grant from access network (Node B) in response to the access probe. In an aspect, the first UL grant message received in response to the access <br><br>
probe may contain information about UL resources, timing parameters to adjust the timing and a MAV H) portion In an aspect, the MAC ID portion may be set to NULL, (for example a series of zeros or any pattern used for indicating unusable data) for the first UI grant message receh ed in response to the access probe Tbe terminal may ignore the processing of the MAC ?D portion of the grant message Where the MAC ID portion is not KL II.
