DESCRIPTION<br>
SEMICONDUCTOR CERAMIC, MONOLITHIC SEMICONDUCTOR CERAMIC<br>
CAPACITOR, METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING SEMICONDUCTOR CERAMIC,<br>
AND METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING MONOLITHIC SEMICONDUCTOR<br>
CERAMIC CAPACITOR<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor<br>
ceramic, a monolithic semiconductor ceramic capacitor, a<br>
method for manufacturing a semiconductor ceramic, and a<br>
method for manufacturing a monolithic semiconductor ceramic<br>
capacitor. In particular, the present invention relates to<br>
a SrTiO3 based grain boundary insulation type semiconductor<br>
ceramic, a monolithic semiconductor ceramic capacitor<br>
including the semiconductor ceramic, and methods for<br>
manufacturing them.<br>
Background Art<br>
In recent years, miniaturization of electronic<br>
components have been advanced rapidly as the electronics<br>
technology has been developed. In the field of monolithic<br>
ceramic capacitor as well, demands for miniaturization and<br>
increases in capacity have intensified. Therefore,<br>
development of ceramic materials having high relative<br>
dielectric constants and reduction in thickness and<br>
multilayering of dielectric ceramic layers have been<br><br>
- 2 —<br>
advanced.<br>
For example, Patent Document 1 proposes a dielectric<br>
ceramic represented by a general formula:<br>
{Ba1-x-yCaxReyO}mTiO2 + αMgO + βMnO (where Re is a rare earth<br>
element selected from the group consisting of Y, Gd, Tb, Dy,<br>
Ho, Er, and Yb, and α, β, m, x, and y satisfy 0.001 
0.05, 0.001 
and 0.001 
Patent Document 1 discloses a monolithic ceramic<br>
capacitor including the above-described dielectric ceramic.<br>
The monolithic ceramic capacitor having a thickness of 2 µm<br>
per ceramic layer, the total number of effective dielectric<br>
ceramic layers of 5, a relative, dielectric constant εr of<br>
1,200 to 3,000, and a dielectric loss of 2.5% or less can be<br>
obtained.<br>
The monolithic ceramic capacitor of Patent Document 1<br>
takes advantage of a dielectric action of the ceramic itself.<br>
On the other hand, research and development on semiconductor<br>
ceramic capacitors based on a principle different from this<br>
have also been conducted intensively.<br>
Among them, a SrTiO3 based grain boundary insulation<br>
type semiconductor ceramic is produced by firing (primary<br>
firing) a ceramic compact in a reducing atmosphere to<br>
convert the ceramic compact to a semiconductor, coating the<br>
ceramic compact with an oxidizing agent containing Bi2O3 or<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
the like and, thereafter, conducting firing (secondary<br>
firing (reoxidation)) in an oxidizing atmosphere to convert<br>
crystal grain boundaries to insulators. The relative<br>
dielectric constant εr of SrTiO3 itself is about 200 and,<br>
therefore, is small. However, since the crystal grain<br>
boundaries have got a capacitance, the apparent relative<br>
dielectric constant εrAPP can be increased by increasing the<br>
crystal grain size and reducing the number of crystal grain<br>
boundaries.<br>
For example, in Patent Document 2, a SrTiO3 based grain<br>
boundary insulation type semiconductor ceramic element<br>
assembly having an average grain size of crystal grains of<br>
10 µm or less and a maximum grain size of 20 µm or less is<br>
proposed. This is a semiconductor ceramic capacitor having<br>
a single-layered structure. In the case where the average<br>
grain size of crystal grains is 8 µm, a semiconductor<br>
ceramic element assembly having an apparent relative<br>
dielectric constant εrAPP of 9,000 can be obtained.<br>

Application Publication No. 11-302072<br>
Patent Document 2: Japanese Patent No. 2689439<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Problems to be solved by the invention<br>
However, if reduction in thickness and multilayering of<br>
ceramic layers are pushed forward by using the dielectric<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
ceramic described in Patent Document 1, there are problems<br>
in that the relative dielectric constant sr decreases, the<br>
temperature characteristic of the capacitance deteriorates,<br>
and short-circuit failures sharply increase.<br>
Consequently, in the case where it is attempted to<br>
obtain a thin monolithic ceramic capacitor having a large<br>
capacity of, for example, 100 µF or more, the thickness of<br>
the dielectric ceramic layer is required to be about 1 µm<br>
per layer and the number of laminated layers is required to<br>
be about 700 layers to 1,000 layers, so that commercial<br>
application is difficult in this situation.<br>
On the other hand, the SrTiO3 based grain boundary<br>
insulation type semiconductor ceramic described in Patent<br>
Document 2 has good frequency characteristic and temperature<br>
characteristic and a small dielectric loss tanδ. The<br>
electric field dependence of the apparent relative<br>
dielectric constant εrAPP is small and, furthermore, a<br>
varistor characteristic is provided, so that breakage of the<br>
element can be avoided even when a high voltage is applied.<br>
Consequently, an application to the field of capacitors is<br>
expected.<br>
However, regarding this type of semiconductor ceramic,<br>
a large apparent relative dielectric constant εrAPP is<br>
obtained by increasing the grain sizes of crystal grains, as<br>
described above. Therefore, if the grain sizes of crystal<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
grains decrease, the apparent relative dielectric constant<br>
εrAPP becomes small so as to cause deterioration of the<br>
dielectric characteristic. Consequently, there is a problem<br>
in that it is difficult to allow the facilitation of<br>
reduction in layer thickness and the improvement of<br>
dielectric characteristic to become mutually compatible.<br>
Furthermore, in order to commercially apply the<br>
semiconductor ceramic to a monolithic ceramic capacitor, it<br>
is required to ensure a sufficient insulating property even<br>
when the layer thickness is reduced. However, regarding the<br>
monolithic semiconductor ceramic capacitor, the insulating<br>
property comparable to that of the monolithic ceramic<br>
capacitor is not ensured in practice in the present<br>
situation.<br>
The present invention has been made in consideration of<br>
the above-described circumstances. It is an object of the<br>
present invention to provide a SrTiO3 based grain boundary<br>
insulation type semiconductor ceramic having a large<br>
apparent relative dielectric constant εrAPP even when crystal<br>
grains are made fine to have an average grain size of 1.0 urn<br>
or less and exhibiting an excellent insulating property, a<br>
monolithic semiconductor ceramic capacitor including the<br>
semiconductor ceramic, a method for manufacturing the above-<br>
described semiconductor ceramic, and a method for<br>
manufacturing the above-described monolithic semiconductor<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
ceramic capacitor.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
Regarding the SrTiO3 based grain boundary insulation<br>
type semiconductor ceramic, a donor element is allowed to<br>
form a solid solution with crystal grains in order to<br>
convert the ceramic to a semiconductor. On the other hand,<br>
it is believed that if an acceptor element is allowed to<br>
form a solid solution with crystal grains, the influence of<br>
the donor element is canceled. Consequently, regarding the<br>
semiconductor ceramic, a technical idea that the acceptor<br>
element is allowed to form a solid solution with crystal<br>
grains together with the donor element has not occurred.<br>
On the other hand, the inventors of the present<br>
invention conducted intensive research by trial and error on<br>
formation of a solid solution between a donor element, an<br>
acceptor element in addition to the donor element, and<br>
crystal grains. As a result, it was found that when a solid<br>
solution was formed from a predetermined amount of donor<br>
element, the acceptor element in an amount less than the<br>
amount of the above-described donor element, and crystal<br>
grains, and a predetermined amount of acceptor element<br>
(irrespective of whether the acceptor element was the same<br>
as the acceptor element which formed the solid solution with<br>
the crystal grains or not) was allowed to present in crystal<br>
grain boundaries, a SrTiO3 based grain boundary insulation<br><br>
— 7 -<br>
type semiconductor ceramic having a large apparent relative<br>
dielectric constant εrAPP of 5,000 or more and a large<br>
resistivity logp (ρ: Ω.cm) of 10 or more was able to be<br>
obtained even when crystal grains were made fine to have an<br>
average grain size of 1.0 µm or less.<br>
The present invention has been made on the basis of the<br>
above-described findings. A semiconductor ceramic according<br>
to the present invention is a SrTiO3 based grain boundary<br>
insulation type semiconductor ceramic and is characterized<br>
in that a donor element within the range of 0.8 to 2.0 mol<br>
relative to 100 mol of Ti element is contained as a solid<br>
solution with crystal grains, an acceptor element in an<br>
amount less than the amount of the above-described donor<br>
element is contained as a solid solution with the above-<br>
described crystal grains, an acceptor element within the<br>
range of 0.3 to 1.0 mol relative to 100 mol of the above-<br>
described Ti element is further present in crystal grain<br>
boundaries, and the average grain size of the crystal grains<br>
is 1.0 µm or less.<br>
The semiconductor ceramic according to the present<br>
invention is characterized in that the above-described donor<br>
element includes at least one element selected from the<br>
group consisting of La, Sm, Dy, Ho, Y, Nd, Ce, Nb, Ta, and W.<br>
The semiconductor ceramic according to the present<br>
invention is characterized in that the above-described<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
acceptor element includes at least one element selected from<br>
the group consisting of Mn, Co, Ni, and Cr.<br>
The semiconductor ceramic according to the present<br>
invention is characterized in that the acceptor element<br>
contained in the above-described crystal grains and the<br>
acceptor element contained in the above-described crystal<br>
grain boundaries are the same element.<br>
The semiconductor ceramic according to the present<br>
invention is characterized in that the acceptor element<br>
contained in the above-described crystal grains and the<br>
acceptor element contained in the above-described crystal<br>
grain boundaries are different types of elements.<br>
Segregation of the above-described acceptor element<br>
into the crystal grain boundaries can be facilitated by<br>
allowing a low-melting-point oxide within the range of 0.1<br>
mol or less relative to 100 mol of the above-described Ti<br>
element to be contained.<br>
That is, the semiconductor ceramic according to the<br>
present invention is characterized in that the low-melting-<br>
point oxide within the range of 0.1 mol or less relative to<br>
100 mol of the above-described Ti element is contained.<br>
The semiconductor ceramic according to the present<br>
invention is characterized in that the above-described low-<br>
melting-point oxide is SiO2.<br>
A monolithic semiconductor ceramic capacitor according<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
to the present invention is characterized in that a<br>
component element assembly is formed from the above-<br>
described semiconductor ceramic, internal electrodes are<br>
disposed in the above-described component element assembly,<br>
and external electrodes electrically connectable to the<br>
above-described internal electrodes are disposed on a<br>
surface of the above-described component element assembly.<br>
A method for manufacturing a semiconductor ceramic<br>
according to the present invention is a method for<br>
manufacturing a SrTiO3 based grain boundary insulation type<br>
semiconductor ceramic, and the method is characterized by<br>
including the steps of weighing, mixing, and pulverizing a<br>
predetermined amount of ceramic raw material containing a<br>
donor compound and an acceptor compound and conducting a<br>
calcination treatment so as to prepare a calcined powder in<br>
a calcined powder preparation step, mixing a predetermined<br>
amount of acceptor compound with the above-described<br>
calcined powder and conducting a heat treatment so as to<br>
prepare a heat-treated powder in a heat-treated powder<br>
preparation step, and subjecting the above-described heat-<br>
treated powder to a primary firing treatment in a reducing<br>
atmosphere and conducting a secondary firing treatment in a<br>
weak reducing atmosphere, an air atmosphere, or an oxidizing<br>
atmosphere in a firing step, wherein the above-described<br>
donor compound is weighed in such a way that a donor element<br><br>

becomes within the range of 0.8 to 2.0 mol relative to 100<br>
mol of the above-described Ti element, the above-described<br>
predetermined amount of acceptor compound is weighed in such<br>
a way that an acceptor element becomes within the range of<br>
0.3 to 1.0 mol relative to 100 mol of the above-described Ti<br>
element, and the donor compound and the acceptor compound<br>
are mixed with the above-described calcined powder.<br>
The inventors of the present invention further<br>
conducted intensive research. As a result, it was found<br>
that the resistivity was able to be further increased and<br>
the insulating property was able to be further improved by<br>
conducting a cooling treatment while the oxygen partial<br>
pressure at the time of starting the cooling was set at 1.0<br>
x 104 times or more the oxygen partial pressure in the<br>
firing process regarding a reduction firing process, which<br>
was an intermediate step for a monolithic semiconductor<br>
ceramic capacitor, that is, a first firing treatment.<br>

as to prepare a calcined powder in a calcined powder<br>
preparation step, mixing a predetermined amount of acceptor<br>
compound with the above-described calcined powder and<br>
conducting a heat treatment so as to prepare a heat-treated<br>
powder in a heat-treated powder preparation step, subjecting<br>
the above-described heat-treated powder to molding to<br>
prepare ceramic green sheets and, thereafter, laminating<br>
internal electrode layers and the ceramic green sheets<br>
alternately so as to form a ceramic laminate in a ceramic<br>
laminate formation step, and subjecting the above-described<br>
ceramic laminate to a primary firing treatment in a reducing<br>
atmosphere and conducting a secondary firing treatment in a<br>
weak reducing atmosphere, an air atmosphere, or an oxidizing<br>
atmosphere in a firing step, wherein the above-described<br>
first firing treatment is carried out on the basis of a<br>
firing profile including a temperature raising process, a<br>
firing process, and a cooling process and the oxygen partial<br>
pressure at the time of starting the cooling is set at 1.0 x<br>
104 times or more the oxygen partial pressure in the firing<br>
process.<br>
The above-described "time of starting the cooling"<br>
includes not only the point in time when the cooling process<br>
is started, but also a short time after the cooling process<br>
is started until the temperature in a firing furnace<br>
decreases by a predetermined temperature from a maximum<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
firing temperature.<br>
Advantages<br>
According to the SrTiO3 based grain boundary insulation<br>
type semiconductor ceramic of the present invention, a donor<br>
element, e.g., La and Sm, within the range of 0.8 to 2.0 mol<br>
relative to 100 mol of Ti element is contained as a solid<br>
solution with crystal grains, an acceptor element, e.g., Mn<br>
and Co, in an amount less than the amount of the above-<br>
described donor element is contained as a solid solution<br>
with the above-described crystal grains, an acceptor element<br>
within the range of 0.3 to 1.0 mol relative to 100 mol of<br>
the above-described Ti element is present in the crystal<br>
grain boundaries, and the average grain size of the crystal<br>
grains is 1.0 µm or less. Therefore, a semiconductor<br>
ceramic having a large apparent relative dielectric constant<br>
εrAPP and a large resistivity and, therefore, exhibiting<br>
excellent electrical characteristics can be obtained even<br>
when the average grain size of crystal grains is 1.0 µm or<br>
less. The apparent relative dielectric constant εrAPP is<br>
5,000 or more and the resistivity logρ (ρ: Ω.cm) is 10 or<br>
more.<br>
The above-described operation and effect can be exerted<br>
irrespective of whether the acceptor element contained in<br>
the crystal grains and the acceptor element contained in the<br>
crystal grain boundaries are the same element or different<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
types of elements.<br>
Since the low-melting-point oxide, e.g., SiO2, within<br>
the range of 0.1 mol or less relative to 100 mol of the<br>
above-described Ti element is contained, segregation of the<br>
acceptor element into the crystal grain boundaries is<br>
facilitated and a monolithic semiconductor ceramic having<br>
desired electrical characteristics can easily be obtained.<br>
According to the monolithic semiconductor ceramic<br>
capacitor of the present invention, the component element<br>
assembly is formed from the above-described semiconductor<br>
ceramic, the internal electrodes are disposed in the above-<br>
described component element assembly, and the external<br>
electrodes electrically connectable to the above-described<br>
internal electrodes are disposed on a surface of the above-<br>
described component element assembly. Therefore, even when<br>
the layer thickness of the semiconductor ceramic layer<br>
constituting the component element assembly is reduced to<br>
about 1.0 urn, a large apparent relative dielectric constant<br>
εrAPP is exhibited, a large resistivity is exhibited, and an<br>
insulating property comparable to that of the known<br>
monolithic ceramic capacitor can be ensured. Consequently,<br>
a thin-layer, high-capacity monolithic semiconductor ceramic<br>
capacitor having a high practical value can be realized.<br>
The method for manufacturing a semiconductor ceramic<br>
according to the present invention includes the steps of<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
weighing, mixing, and pulverizing the predetermined amount<br>
of ceramic raw material containing the donor compound and<br>
the acceptor compound and conducting the calcination<br>
treatment so as to prepare the calcined powder in the<br>
calcined powder preparation step, mixing the predetermined<br>
amount of acceptor compound with the above-described<br>
calcined powder and conducting the heat treatment so as to<br>
prepare the heat-treated powder in a heat-treated powder<br>
preparation step, and subjecting the above-described heat-<br>
treated powder to the primary firing treatment in the<br>
reducing atmosphere and conducting the secondary firing<br>
treatment in the weak reducing atmosphere, the air<br>
atmosphere, or the oxidizing atmosphere in the firing step,<br>
wherein the above-described donor compound is weighed in<br>
such a way that the donor element becomes within the range<br>
of 0.3 to 2.0 mol relative to 1.00 mol of Ti element, the<br>
above-described predetermined amount of acceptor compound is<br>
weighed in such a way that the acceptor element becomes<br>
within the range of 0.3 to 1.0 mol relative to 100 mol of<br>
the above-described Ti element, and the donor compound and<br>
the acceptor compound are mixed with the above-described<br>
calcined powder. Therefore, a semiconductor ceramic, which<br>
can have a larger resistivity while a desired large apparent<br>
relative dielectric constant εrAPP is ensured, can be<br>
obtained.<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
According to the method for manufacturing a monolithic<br>
semiconductor ceramic capacitor of the present invention,<br>
the oxygen partial pressure at the time of starting the<br>
cooling is set at 1.0 x 104 times or more the oxygen partial<br>
pressure in the firing process. Therefore, in the cooling<br>
process of the primary firing, the cooling treatment can be<br>
conducted while the oxygen partial pressure has increased.<br>
Consequently, the resistivity can further increase while the<br>
desired large apparent relative dielectric constant εrAPP is<br>
ensured, so that a monolithic semiconductor ceramic<br>
capacitor can be produced, wherein the insulating property<br>
can be further improved.<br>

The embodiment of the present invention will be<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
described below in detail.<br>
A semiconductor ceramic according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention is a SrTiO3 based grain boundary<br>
insulation type semiconductor ceramic. A donor element<br>
within the range of 0.8 to 2.0 mol relative to 100 mol of Ti<br>
element is contained as a solid solution with crystal grains,<br>
and an acceptor element in an amount less than the amount of<br>
the above-described donor element is contained as the solid<br>
solution with the above-described crystal grains.<br>
Furthermore, an acceptor element in an amount less than the<br>
amount of the above-described donor element and within the<br>
range of 0.3 to 1.0 mol relative to 100 mol of the above-<br>
described Ti element is present in the crystal grain<br>
boundaries, and the average grain size of the crystal grains<br>
is specified to be 1.0 µm or less.<br>
It has been previously known that a donor element is<br>
contained as a solid solution with crystal grains in order<br>
to convert ceramic to a semiconductor. However, it is not<br>
usually conducted to contain an acceptor element together<br>
with the donor element as a solid solution with crystal<br>
grains because the effect of the donor element is assumed to<br>
be cancelled.<br>
On the other hand, the inventors of the present<br>
invention conducted intensive research by trial and error on<br>
formation of a solid solution between a donor element, an<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
acceptor element in addition to the donor element, and<br>
crystal grains. As a result, it was found that when a solid<br>
solution was formed from a predetermined amount of donor<br>
element, the acceptor element in an amount less than the<br>
amount of the donor element, and crystal grains, and a<br>
predetermined amount of acceptor element was allowed to<br>
present in crystal grain boundaries, a SrTiO3 based grain<br>
boundary insulation type semiconductor ceramic having a<br>
large apparent relative dielectric constant εrAPP of 5,000 or<br>
more and a large resistivity logρ (ρ: Ω.cm) of 10 or more<br>
was able to be obtained even when crystal grains were made<br>
fine to have an average grain size of 1.0 µm or less.<br>
Consequently, even when the layer thickness is reduced<br>
to 1.0 µm or less, a semiconductor ceramic having a large<br>
apparent relative dielectric constant εrAPP as compared with<br>
that of a known dielectric ceramic, having an insulating<br>
property comparable to that of the known dielectric ceramic,<br>
and exhibiting excellent electrical characteristics can be<br>
obtained.<br>
Here, the content of donor element is specified to be<br>
0.8 to 2.0 mol relative to 100 mol of Ti element for the<br>
following reasons.<br>
The ceramic can be converted to a semiconductor by<br>
allowing a donor element having the number of valences<br>
larger than that of Sr element to be contained in a solid<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
solution with crystal grains and conducting a firing<br>
treatment in a reducing atmosphere. However, the content<br>
thereof in terms of mol has an influence on the apparent<br>
relative dielectric constant εrAPP. That is, if the above-<br>
described donor element is less than 0.8 mol relative to 100<br>
mol of Ti element, a desired large apparent relative<br>
dielectric constant εrAPP cannot be obtained. On the other<br>
hand, if the donor element exceeds 2.0 mol relative to 100<br>
mol of Ti element, the limit of solid solubility into the Sr<br>
site is exceeded and the donor element deposits at grain<br>
boundaries so as to cause significant reduction in the<br>
apparent relative dielectric constant εrAPP and deterioration<br>
of the dielectric characteristic.<br>
Therefore, in the present embodiment, the content is<br>
specified to be 0.8 to 2.0 mol relative to 100 mol of Ti<br>
element, as described above.<br>
Such a donor element is not specifically limited<br>
insofar as the element is contained as a solid solution with<br>
crystal grains and has a function as a donor. Examples of<br>
usable elements include rare earth elements, e.g., La, Sm,<br>
Dy, Ho, Y, Nd, and Ce; Nb; Ta; and W.<br>
In the present embodiment, the acceptor element is also<br>
contained as a solid solution with crystal grains and, in<br>
addition, the acceptor element within the range of 0.3 to<br>
1.0 mol relative to 100 mol of Ti element is present in<br><br>
- 19 <br>
crystal grain boundaries as well. The acceptor element<br>
contained as the solid solution in crystal grains and the<br>
acceptor element present in crystal grain boundaries may be<br>
the same element or different types of elements.<br>
Such an acceptor element is not specifically limited<br>
insofar as the element functions as an acceptor when being<br>
contained as a solid solution with crystal grains, and<br>
transition metal elements, e.g., Mn, Co, Ni, and Cr, can be<br>
used.<br>
Here, the content of acceptor element present in<br>
crystal grain boundaries is specified to be 0.3 to 1.0 mol<br>
relative to 100 mol of Ti element for the following reasons.<br>
When the acceptor element is contained in the<br>
semiconductor ceramic and is allowed to present in crystal<br>
grain boundaries, oxygen is adsorbed by crystal grain<br>
boundaries due to the above-described acceptor element<br>
present in the crystal grain boundaries during the secondary<br>
firing. Consequently, the dielectric characteristic can be<br>
improved.<br>
However, if the content of acceptor element present in<br>
crystal grain boundaries is less than 0.3 mol relative to<br>
100 mol of Ti element, the apparent relative dielectric<br>
constant εrAPP cannot be improved satisfactorily, and the<br>
resistivity is small. On the other hand, if the content of<br>
acceptor element present in crystal grain boundaries exceeds<br><br>
- 20 -<br>
1.0 mol relative to 100 mol of Ti element, the average grain<br>
size exceeds 1.0 µm as well. Consequently, crystal grains<br>
are allowed to become coarse, desired reduction in layer<br>
thickness becomes difficult and, furthermore, the<br>
resistivity decreases.<br>
Therefore, in the present embodiment, the content of<br>
acceptor element present in crystal grain boundaries is<br>
adjusted to be 0.3 to 1.0 mol relative to 100 mol of Ti<br>
element.<br>
In the crystal grains, the content in terms of mol of<br>
acceptor element present as a solid solution with crystal<br>
grains is not specifically limited insofar as the amount is<br>
smaller than the amount of donor element. However, 0.008 to<br>
0.08 mol relative to 100 mol of Ti element is preferable.<br>
The reasons are as described below. If the content in terms<br>
of mol of acceptor element present as a solid solution with<br>
crystal grains is less than 0.008 mol relative to 100 mol of<br>
Ti element, the content in terms of mol of acceptor element<br>
in the crystal grains is too small and, thereby, the<br>
resistivity may not be improved satisfactorily. On the<br>
other hand, if the content exceeds 0.08 mol relative to 100<br>
mol of Ti element, the acceptor element becomes excessive<br>
relative to the donor element, and reduction in the apparent<br>
relative dielectric constant εrAPP may result although the<br>
resistivity increases.<br><br>
— 21 —<br>
If the content of acceptor element present as a solid<br>
solution with the crystal grains is converted to a ratio of<br>
the acceptor element to the donor element (acceptor<br>
element/donor element), the ratio is 1/10 to 1/1000, and<br>
preferably 1/10 to 1/100.<br>
It is also preferable that a low-melting-point oxide<br>
within the range of 0.1 mol or less relative to 100 mol of<br>
Ti element is added to the above-described semiconductor<br>
ceramic, in particular, crystal grain boundaries. By<br>
addition of such a low-melting-point oxide, the<br>
sinterability can be improved and, in addition, the<br>
segregation of the above-described acceptor element at<br>
crystal grain boundaries can be facilitated.<br>
If the content in terms of mol of the low-melting-point<br>
oxide relative to 100 mol of Ti element exceeds 0.1 mol, the<br>
anparent relative dielectric constant εrAPP may decrease.<br>
Therefore, in the case where the low-melting-point oxide is<br>
added, 0.1 mol or less relative to 100 mol of Ti element is<br>
preferable, as described above.<br>
Such low-melting-point oxides are not specifically<br>
limited, and glass ceramic containing SiO2, B, or an alkali<br>
metal element (K, Li, Na, or the like), copper-tungsten<br>
oxide, or the like can be used. Preferably, SiO2 is used.<br>
The formulation mole ratio m of the Sr site to the Ti<br>
site is not specifically limited insofar as the ratio is in<br><br>
- 22 -<br>
the vicinity of the stoichiometric composition (m = 1.000).<br>
However, it is preferable that 0.995 
satisfied. The reasons for this are as described below. If<br>
the formulation mole ratio m becomes less than 0.995, the<br>
grain sizes of crystal grains become large so that the<br>
average grain size may exceed 1.0 µm. On the other hand, if<br>
the formulation mole ratio m exceeds 1.020, the deviation<br>
from the stoichiometric composition becomes large and<br>
sintering may become difficult. More preferably,- the<br>
formulation mole ratio m satisfies 0.995 
further preferably 1.000 
The average grain size of the semiconductor ceramic<br>
crystal grains can be easily controlled at 1.0 µm or less by<br>
controlling the manufacturing condition combined with the<br>
above-described composition range.<br>
Fig. 1 is a sectional view schematically showing an<br>
embodiment of a monolithic semiconductor ceramic capacitor<br>
produced by using a semiconductor ceramic according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
In the monolithic semiconductor ceramic capacitor,<br>
internal electrodes 2 (2a to 2f) are embedded in a component<br>
element assembly 1 formed from the semiconductor ceramic of<br>
the present invention. In addition, external electrodes 3a<br>
and 3b are disposed at two end portions of the component<br>
element assembly 1.<br><br>
- 23 -<br>
That is, the component element assembly 1 is composed<br>
of a sintered laminate including a plurality of<br>
semiconductor ceramic layers 1a to 1g and the internal<br>
electrodes 2a to 2f laminated alternately. The internal<br>
electrodes 2a, 2c, and 2e are electrically connected to the<br>
external electrode 3a, and the internal electrodes 2b, 2d,<br>
and 2f are electrically connected to the external electrode<br>
3b. The capacitance is formed between facing surfaces of<br>
the internal electrodes 2a, 2c, and 2e and the internal<br>
electrodes 2b, 2d, and 2f.<br>
The above-described monolithic semiconductor ceramic<br>
capacitor can obtain an apparent relative dielectric<br>
constant εrAPP of 5,000 or more and a resistivity logρ (ρ:<br>
Ω.cm) of 10 or more because the component element assembly 1<br>
is formed from the above-described semiconductor ceramic.<br>
Therefore, the manufacturing method is not specifically<br>
limited insofar as a semiconductor ceramic having the above-<br>
described composition is obtained.<br>
However, it is more preferable that the production is<br>
conducted by the above-described manufacturing method<br>
because a semiconductor ceramic capacitor ensuring an<br>
apparent relative dielectric constant εrAPP of 5,000 or more<br>
and having a larger resistivity can be produced by<br>
conducting a cooling treatment while the oxygen partial<br>
pressure at the time of starting the cooling is set at 1.0 x<br><br>
- 24 -<br>
104 times or more the oxygen partial pressure in the firing<br>
process in the primary firing treatment conducted in a<br>
reducing atmosphere.<br>
This favorable manufacturing method will be described<br>
below in detail.<br>
Each of a Sr compound, e.g., SrCO3, as a ceramic raw<br>
material, a donor compound containing a donor element, e.g.,<br>
La or Sm, an acceptor compound, e.g., Mn or Co, and a Ti<br>
compound, e.g., TiO2, having a specific surface area of<br>
preferably 10 m /g or more (average grain size: about 0.1 µm<br>
or less), is prepared. The donor compound is weighed in<br>
such a way that the content of donor element becomes 0.8 to<br>
2.0 mol relative to 100 mol of Ti element. Furthermore,<br>
predetermined amounts of Sr compound and Ti compound are<br>
weighed.<br>
A oredetecmined amount of dispersing agent is added to<br>
the weighed materials, and the resulting mixture is put into<br>
a ball mill together with water and pulverizing media, e.g.,<br>
PSZ (Partially Stabilized Zirconia) balls. Wet-mixing is<br>
conducted in the ball mill sufficiently so as to prepare a<br>
slurry.<br>
The resulting slurry is dried by vaporization and is<br>
subjected to a calcination treatment in an air atmosphere at<br>
a predetermined temperature (for example, 1,300°C to<br>
1,450°C) for about 2 hours so as to prepare a calcined<br><br>
- 25 -<br>
powder in which the donor element and the acceptor element<br>
are contained as a solid solution.<br>
A low-melting-point oxide, e.g., SiO2, is weighed in<br>
such a way that the content thereof becomes 0 to 0.1 mol<br>
relative to 100 mol of Ti element. Furthermore, the<br>
acceptor compound is weighed in such a way that the content<br>
of acceptor element, e.g., Mn or Co, becomes 0.3 to 1.0 mol<br>
relative to 100 mol of Ti element. The low-melting-point<br>
oxide and the acceptor compound are blended with the above-<br>
described calcined powder, pure water, and a dispersing<br>
agent, if necessary, and wet-mixing is conducted<br>
sufficiently. Drying was conducted by vaporization and,<br>
thereafter, a heat treatment is conducted in an air<br>
atmosphere at a predetermined temperature (for example,<br>
600°C) for about 5 hours so as to prepare a heat-treated<br>
powder.<br>
The resulting heat-treated powder is blended with<br>
appropriate amounts of organic solvent, e.g., toluene or<br>
alcohol, and dispersing agent, and is put into the ball mill<br>
again together with the above-described pulverizing media so<br>
as to be wet-milled in the ball mill sufficiently.<br>
Appropriate amounts of organic binder and plasticizer are<br>
added, wet-mixing is conducted sufficiently for a long time<br>
period and, thereby, a ceramic slurry is obtained.<br>
The ceramic slurry is subjected to molding by using a<br><br>
- 26 -<br>
molding method, e.g., a doctor blade method, a lip coating<br>
method, or a die coating method so as to prepare ceramic<br>
green sheets in such a way that the thickness after the<br>
firing becomes a predetermined thickness (for example, about<br>
1 to 2 µm).<br>
An electrically conductive film with a predetermined<br>
pattern is formed on a surface of the above-described<br>
ceramic green sheet by screen-printing or gravure-printing<br>
an electrically conductive paste for the internal electrode<br>
on the ceramic green sheet or by conducting vapor deposition,<br>
sputtering, or the like.<br>
The electrically conductive material contained in the<br>
electrically conductive paste for the internal electrode is<br>
not specifically limited. However, it is preferable that a<br>
base metal material, e.g., Ni or Cu, is used.<br>
A plurality of ceramic green sheets provided with the<br>
electrically conductive film are laminated in a<br>
predetermined direction and, in addition, ceramic green<br>
sheets for external layers provided with no electrically<br>
conductive film are laminated, followed by press-bonding and<br>
cutting into a predetermined dimension, so as to produce a<br>
ceramic laminate.<br>
Subsequently, a binder removal treatment is conducted<br>
in an air atmosphere at a temperature of 200°C to 300°C and,<br>
furthermore, in a weak reducing atmosphere at a temperature<br><br>
- 27 -<br>
of 700°C to 800°C, if necessary. A firing furnace with a<br>
reducing atmosphere, in which the ratio of flow rate of a H2<br>
gas to a N2 gas is specified to be a predetermined value<br>
(for example, H2/N2 = 0.025/100 to 1/100), is used. Primary<br>
firing is conducted in the firing furnace at a temperature<br>
of 1,150°C to 1,300°C for about 2 hours so as to convert the<br>
ceramic laminate to a semiconductor. That is, the primary<br>
firing is conducted at a temperature lower than or equal to<br>
the calcination temperature (1,300°C to 1,450°C) so as to<br>
convert the ceramic laminate to a semiconductor.<br>
In this primary firing treatment, the oxygen partial<br>
pressure in the firing furnace is sharply increased at the<br>
time of starting the cooling after the firing, the oxygen<br>
partial pressure at the time of starting of the cooling (the<br>
oxygen partial pressure during cooling) is set at 1.0 x 104<br>
times or more the oxygen partial pressure during the firing<br>
process (the oxygen partial pressure during firing), and the<br>
cooling treatment is conducted. Consequently, a larger<br>
resistivity is obtained.<br>
That is, in the present embodiment, large amounts of<br>
steam is supplied to the firing furnace at the time of<br>
starting of the cooling after the firing, and furthermore,<br>
the supply rate of the H2 gas in the firing furnace is<br>
decreased by a predetermined amount (for example, 1/10) so<br>
as to sharply increase the oxygen partial pressure in the<br><br>
- 28 -<br>
firing furnace, and the cooling treatment is conducted while<br>
the ratio of the oxygen partial pressure during cooling to<br>
the oxygen partial pressure during firing, that is, the<br>
oxygen partial pressure ratio ∆PO2, is set at 1.0 x 104 or<br>
more. Consequently, a still larger resistivity is obtained<br>
while an apparent relative dielectric constant εrAPP of 5,000<br>
or more is ensured.<br>
The above-described "time of starting the cooling"<br>
includes not only the point in time when the cooling process<br>
is started, but also a short time after the cooling process<br>
is started until the temperature in a firing furnace<br>
decreases by a predetermined temperature (for example, 30°C<br>
to 50°C) from a maximum firing temperature.<br>
The reason the oxygen partial pressure during cooling<br>
is set at 1.0 x 104 times or more the oxygen partial<br>
pressure during firing will be described with reference to<br>
Fig. 2.<br>
Fig. 2 is a diagram showing the firing profile and<br>
changes in electromotive force E over time. The horizontal<br>
axis indicates the time (hr), the left vertical axis<br>
indicates the temperature (°C), and the right vertical axis<br>
indicates the electromotive force E (V). A solid line<br>
indicates the firing profile and an alternate long and short<br>
dash line indicates changes in electromotive force over time.<br>
That is, according to the firing profile, the<br><br>
- 29 -<br>
temperature in the furnace is raised as indicated by an<br>
arrow A at the time of starting the firing treatment<br>
(temperature raising process), a maximum firing temperature<br>
Tmax (in the present embodiment, 1,150°C to 1,300°C) is<br>
maintained for about 2 hours as indicated by an arrow B<br>
(firing process), and the temperature in the furnace is<br>
lowered to cool the fired product as indicated by an arrow C<br>
(cooling process).<br>
On the other hand, as shown by Mathematical expression<br>
(1), the Nernst equation holds between the electromotive<br>
force E (V) and the oxygen partial pressure PO2 (atm) in the<br>
firing furnace.<br>
E = (2.15 x 10-5 x T) x ln(PO2/0.206) (1)<br>
where T indicates an absolute temperature (K) in the<br>
tiring furnace.<br>
Therefore, the oxygen partial pressure PO2 can be<br>
determined by measuring the electromotive force E.<br>
Steam was supplied to the firing furnace at the time of<br>
starting of the cooling process, and furthermore, the supply<br>
rate of the H2 gas to the firing furnace was decreased, if<br>
necessary, while changes in the electromotive force E in the<br>
firing furnace over time were measured with a direct-insert<br>
type zirconia oxygen sensor. Consequently, as shown by the<br>
alternate long and short dash line in Fig. 2, it was found<br>
that the electromotive force E always became at a local<br><br>
- 30 -<br>
minimum at the point in time when the temperature in the<br>
furnace was lowered by a predetermined temperature AT (for<br>
example, 30°C to 50°C) from the maximum firing temperature<br>
Tmax and, thereafter, the electromotive force E increased<br>
gradually. Therefore, the oxygen partial pressure PO2<br>
becomes at a local maximum at the point in time when the<br>
temperature in the furnace is lowered by a predetermined<br>
temperature AT from the maximum firing temperature Tmax on<br>
the basis of Mathematical expression (1).<br>
The inventors of the present invention conducted<br>
experiments repeatedly in such a way that the oxygen partial<br>
pressure during cooling was specified to be the local<br>
maximum oxygen partial pressure PO2, the oxygen partial<br>
pressure during firing was specified to be the oxygen<br>
partial pressure at the maximum firing temperature Tmax, and<br>
the supply rate of the steam and the supply rate of the H2<br>
gas to the firing furnace were adjusted to variously<br>
differentiate the oxygen partial pressure ratio ∆PO2 of the<br>
two oxygen partial pressures (= oxygen partial pressure<br>
during cooling/oxygen partial pressure during firing). As a<br>
result, it was found that a still larger resistivity was<br>
able to be obtained while an apparent relative dielectric<br>
constant εrAPP of 5,000 or more was ensured by setting the<br>
oxygen partial pressure ratio ∆PO2 at 1.0 x 10 or more.<br>
From these reasons, in the present embodiment, the<br><br>
- 31 -<br>
cooling treatment is conducted while the above-described<br>
oxygen partial pressure ratio ∆PO2 is set at 1.0 x 10 times<br>
or more.<br>
After the ceramic laminate is converted to the<br>
semiconductor by the primary firing as described above, the<br>
secondary firing is conducted in a weak reducing atmosphere,<br>
an air atmosphere, or an oxidizing atmosphere at a low<br>
temperature of 600°C to 900°C not to oxidize the internal<br>
electrode material, e.g., Ni or Cu, for 1 hour. In this<br>
manner, the semiconductor ceramic is reoxidized and a grain<br>
boundary insulating layer is formed, so that the component<br>
element assembly 1, in which the internal electrodes 2 are<br>
embedded, is produced.<br>
An electrically conductive paste for external electrode<br>
is applied to both end surfaces of the component element<br>
assembly 1, a baking treatment is conducted, so as to form<br>
external electrodes 3a and 3b. In this manner, a monolithic<br>
semiconductor ceramic capacitor is produced.<br>
The electrically conductive material contained in the<br>
electrically conductive paste for external electrode is not<br>
specifically limited as well. However, it is preferable to<br>
use a material, such as Ga, In, Ni, or Cu. Furthermore, a<br>
Ag electrode may be formed on the electrode.<br>
Alternatively, the external electrodes 3a and 3b may be<br>
formed by a method in which the electrically conductive<br><br>
- 32 -<br>
paste for external electrode is applied to both end surfaces<br>
of a ceramic laminate and, thereafter, the firing treatment<br>
is conducted simultaneously with the ceramic laminate.<br>
As described above, in the present embodiment, the<br>
monolithic semiconductor ceramic capacitor is produced by<br>
using the above-described semiconductor ceramic. Therefore,<br>
the layer thickness of each of semiconductor ceramic layers<br>
1a to 1g can be reduced to 1 µm or less. Furthermore, a<br>
small, high-capacity monolithic semiconductor ceramic<br>
capacitor can be obtained, which has a large apparent<br>
relative dielectric constant εrAPP of 5,000 or more per layer<br>
even after the layer thickness is reduced, a large<br>
resistivity logp (ρ: Ω.cm) of 10 or more, and a good<br>
insulating property comparable to that of the known<br>
monolithic ceramic capacitor. Moreover, in contrast to a<br>
high-capacity tantalum capacitor, ease of handling is<br>
exhibited because the polarity needs not be taken into<br>
consideration, and the resistance is low even in a high<br>
frequency range. Therefore, the effectiveness as an<br>
alternative to the tantalum capacitor is high.<br>
It is known that the SrTiO3 based grain boundary<br>
insulation type semiconductor ceramic has a varistor<br>
characteristic, as is also described in the item "Problems<br>
to be solved by the invention". In the present embodiment,<br>
since the average grain size of crystal grains is 1.0 µm or<br><br>
- 33 -<br>
less and, therefore, the crystal grains are fine grains, the<br>
varistor voltage can increase. Consequently, the use as a<br>
capacitor in a usual field strength region (for example, 1<br>
V/µm) , in which the voltage-current characteristic exhibits<br>
linearity, broadens the versatility of application as the<br>
capacitor. In addition, since the varistor characteristic<br>
is provided, breakage of the element can be prevented even<br>
when an abnormally high voltage is applied to the element,<br>
and a capacitor exhibiting excellent reliability can be<br>
obtained.<br>
Since the varistor voltage can increase as described<br>
above, a capacitor capable of avoiding breakage due to a<br>
surge voltage and the like can be realized. Since the<br>
breakage voltage is high, it is possible to use for the<br>
application to an ESD-resistant capacitor, although a low-<br>
capacity capacitor to be used for the purpose of ESD<br>
(electro-static discharge) is required to have a surge-<br>
resistant characteristic.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above-<br>
described embodiment. Fig. 1 shows the monolithic<br>
semiconductor ceramic capacitor including the plurality of<br>
semiconductor ceramic layers 1a to 1g and the internal<br>
electrodes 2a to 2f laminated alternately. However, a<br>
monolithic semiconductor ceramic capacitor having a<br>
structure, in which an internal electrode is formed on a<br><br>
- 34 -<br>
surface of a single plate (for example, thickness is about<br>
200 µm) of semiconductor ceramic through evaporation or the<br>
like and several layers (for example, two or three layers)<br>
of the single plate are bonded together with an adhesive,<br>
can also be used. Such a structure is effective for a<br>
monolithic semiconductor ceramic capacitor to be used for a<br>
low-capacitor application, for example.<br>
In the above-described embodiment, the solid solution<br>
is prepared by a solid phase method. However, the method<br>
for preparing the solid solution is not specifically limited.<br>
Any method, for example, a hydrothermal synthesis method, a<br>
sol.gel method, a hydrolysis method, and a coprecipitation<br>
method, can be used.<br>
In the above-described embodiment, the secondary firing<br>
(reoxidation treatment) is conducted in the air atmosphere<br>
to form the grain boundary insulating layer. However,<br>
desired operation and effect can be obtained even when the<br>
oxygen concentration is somewhat lower than that in the air<br>
atmosphere, if necessary.<br>
Furthermore, in the primary firing treatment of the<br>
above-described method for manufacturing a monolithic<br>
semiconductor ceramic capacitor, the cooling treatment is<br>
conducted while the oxygen partial pressure at the time of<br>
starting the cooling is set at 1.0 x 104 times or more the<br>
oxygen partial pressure in the firing process. However,<br><br>
- 35 -<br>
even when the primary firing treatment is conducted without<br>
specifically changing the above-described oxygen partial<br>
pressure in the firing furnace, an apparent relative<br>
dielectric constant εrAPP of 5,000 or more and a large<br>
resistivity logρ (ρ: Ω.cm) of 10 or more can be obtained.<br>
In this case, the semiconductor ceramic can be produced<br>
usually as described below.<br>
That is, a donor compound is weighed in such a way that<br>
a donor element becomes within the range of 0.8 to 2.0 mol<br>
relative to 100 mol of Ti element, and a predetermined<br>
amount of predetermined ceramic raw material containing an<br>
acceptor compound is weighed. After mixing and pulverizing,<br>
a calcining treatment is conducted so as to prepare a<br>
calcined powder. Subsequently, the acceptor compound is<br>
weighed in such a way that an acceptor element becomes<br>
within the range of 0.3 to 1.0 mol relative to 100 mol of<br>
the above-described Ti element, and if necessary, a low-<br>
melting point oxide, e.g., SiO2, is weighed. They are mixed<br>
with the above-described calcined powder and a heat<br>
treatment is conducted so as to prepare a heat-treated<br>
powder. The resulting heat-treated powder is subjected to a<br>
primary firing treatment in a reducing atmosphere and,<br>
thereafter, is subjected to a secondary firing treatment in<br>
a weak reducing atmosphere, an air atmosphere, or an<br>
oxidizing atmosphere, so that a semiconductor ceramic can be<br><br>
- 36 -<br>
produced.<br>
The examples of the present invention will be<br>
specifically described below.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
In Example 1, a semiconductor ceramic capacitor having<br>
a single-layered structure was produced, and electrical<br>
characteristics were evaluated.<br>
Each of SrCO3, LaCl3, MnCl2, and TiO2 having a specific<br>
surface area of 30 m2 /g (average grain size: about 30 nm)<br>
was prepared as a ceramic raw material. The ceramic raw<br>
materials were weighed in such a way that the semiconductor<br>
ceramic had the composition shown in Table 1. Furthermore,<br>
2 parts by weight of ammonium polycarboxylate relative to<br>
100 parts by weight of the weighed material was added as a<br>
dispersing agent. The resulting mixture was put into a ball<br>
mill together with pure water and PSZ balls having a<br>
diameter of 2 mm. Wet-mixing was conducted in the ball mill<br>
for 16 hours so as to prepare a slurry.<br>
The resulting slurry was dried by vaporization and was<br>
subjected to a calcination treatment in an air atmosphere at<br>
a temperature of l,400°C for about 2 hours so as to prepare<br>
a calcined powder in which the La element and the Mn element<br>
were contained in a solid solution.<br>
A MnCl2 aqueous solution and a SiO2 sol solution were<br>
added to the above-described calcined powder in such a way<br><br>
- 37 -<br>
that the contents of the Mn element and SiO2 in terms of mol<br>
became those shown in Table 1 relative to 100 mol of Ti<br>
element in the crystal grain boundaries. Pure water and a<br>
dispersing agent, if necessary, were added and wet-mixing<br>
was conducted for 16 hours. Drying was conducted by<br>
vaporization and, thereafter, a heat treatment was conducted<br>
in an air atmosphere at a temperature of 600°C for 5 hours<br>
so as to prepare a heat-treated powder. A MnO2 sol may be<br>
used instead of the MnCl2 aqueous solution, and<br>
tetraethoxysilane (Si(OC2H5)4) may be used instead of the<br>
SiO2 sol solution.<br>
The above-described heat-treated powder was blended<br>
with appropriate amounts of organic solvent, e.g., toluene<br>
or alcohol, and dispersing agent, and was put into the ball<br>
mill again together with the PSZ balls having a diameter of<br>
2 mm. Wet-mixing was conducted for 6 hours in the bail mill.<br>
Appropriate amounts of polyvinylbutyral (PVB) serving as a<br>
binder and dioctyl phthalate (DOP) serving as a plasticizer<br>
were added, wet-mixing was further conducted for 16 hours<br>
and, thereby, a ceramic slurry was prepared.<br>
The resulting ceramic slurry was subjected to molding<br>
by using a doctor blade method so as to prepare ceramic<br>
green sheets. The resulting ceramic green sheets were<br>
stamped into a predetermined size, and were stacked on top<br>
of each other to have a thickness of about 0.5 mm, followed<br><br>
- 38 -<br>
by thermal compression bonding, so that a ceramic compact<br>
was prepared.<br>
The resulting ceramic compact was cut into a size 5 mm<br>
long and 5 mm wide and, thereafter, a binder removal<br>
treatment was conducted in an air atmosphere, in an air<br>
atmosphere at a temperature of 250°C and, furthermore, in a<br>
weak reducing atmosphere at a temperature of 800°C for 5<br>
hours. Primary firing was conducted in a strong reducing<br>
atmosphere, in which the ratio of flow rate of a H2 gas to a<br>
N2 gas was specified in such a way as to satisfy H2:N2 =<br>
1:100, at a temperature of 1,200°C to 1,250°C for 2 hours<br>
and, thereby, conversion to a semiconductor was effected.<br>
Subsequently, the secondary firing was conducted in an air<br>
atmosphere at a temperature of 800°C for 1 hour to apply a<br>
reoxidation treatment so as to produce a grain boundary<br>
insulation type semiconductor ceramic.<br>
Both end surfaces were coated with In-Ga so as to<br>
produce external electrodes. In this manner, samples of<br>
Sample Nos. 1 to 15 were produced.<br>
Each sample was observed with a scanning electron<br>
microscope (SEM). SEM photographs of a sample surface and a<br>
fracture surface were subjected to image analysis, and an<br>
average grain size of crystal grains (average crystal grain<br>
size) was determined.<br>
The capacitance of each sample was measured by using an<br><br>
- 39 -<br>
impedance analyzer (HP4194A: produced by Hewlett-Packard<br>
Company) under the condition of a frequency of 1 kHz and a<br>
voltage of 1 V. The apparent relative dielectric constant<br>
εrAPP was calculated from the raeasured capacitance and the<br>
sample dimension.<br>
Each sample of Sample Nos. 1 to 15 was applied with a<br>
direct current voltage of 5 to 500 V for 2 minutes, and the<br>
insulation resistance IR was measured on the basis of the<br>
leakage current thereof. The resistivity logρ (ρ: Ω.cm)<br>
under a field strength of 1 V/(im was determined on the basis<br>
of the resulting insulation resistance IR and the sample<br>
dimension.<br>
Table 1 shows the compositions of crystal grains and<br>
crystal grain boundaries of Sample Nos. 1 to 15 and the<br>
measurement results thereof.<br>
[Table 1]<br><br><br>
- 40 -<br><br>
*asterisked sample numbers indicate samples which are out of the<br>
present invention<br>
As is clear from this Table 1, regarding Sample No 11,<br>
since Mn, which was an acceptor element, was not contained<br>
in the crystal grains, the resistivity logρ was a low 9.5,<br>
that is, 10 or less, although the apparent relative<br>
dielectric constant εrAPP exceeded 5,000. Consequently, a<br>
desired high resistivity was not able to be obtained.<br>
Regarding Sample No. 12, the content in terms of mol of<br>
La, which was a donor element, in the crystal grains was 0.6<br>
mol relative to 100 mol of Ti element and, therefore, was<br>
less than 0.8 mol. Consequently, the apparent relative<br>
dielectric constant εrAPP was 4,500 and, therefore, decreased<br>
to less than 5,000.<br>
Regarding Sample No. 13, the above-described content in<br>
terms of mol of La in the crystal grains was 2.5 mol<br>
relative to 100 mol of Ti element and, therefore, was<br>
excessive. Consequently, the apparent relative dielectric<br>
constant εrAPP was 3,700 and, therefore, decreased<br>
significantly.<br><br>
- 41 -<br>
 Regarding Sample No. 14, the content in terms of mol of<br>
Mn in the crystal grain boundaries was 0.25 mol relative to<br>
100 mol of Ti element and, therefore, was less than 0.3 mol.<br>
Consequently, the apparent relative dielectric constant εrAPP<br>
was 2,840 and, therefore, decreased to less than 5,000. The<br>
resistivity logρ was a low 8.7.<br>
Regarding Sample No. 15, the content in terms of mol of<br>
Mn in the crystal grain boundaries was 1.5 mol relative to<br>
100 mol of Ti element and, therefore, exceeded 1.0 mol.<br>
Consequently, the average crystal grain size was 1.8 µm and,<br>
therefore, the grains became coarse. The resistivity logρ<br>
was a low 8.1.<br>
If the content in terms of mol of SiO2, which is a low-<br>
melting-point oxide, exceeds 0.1 mol relative to 100 mol of<br>
Ti element, the apparent relative dielectric constant εrAPP<br>
may decrease. Therefore, it is preferable that the content<br>
in terms of mol of SiO2 relative to 100 mol of Ti element is<br>
0.1 mol or less.<br>
On the other hand, regarding Sample Nos. 1 to 10, the<br>
contents in terms of mol of La, which was a donor element,<br>
in the crystal grains were 0.8 to 2.0 mol relative to 100<br>
mol of Ti element, and Mn, which was an acceptor element,<br>
was contained together with La as a solid solution with<br>
crystal grains. Furthermore, 0.3 to 1.0 mol of Mn was<br>
present relative to 100 mol of Ti element in crystal grain<br><br>
- 42 -<br>
boundaries as well. Moreover, SiO2 was contained, and the<br>
content in terms of mol thereof was 0.1 mol or less relative<br>
to 100 mol of Ti element. Consequently, the average crystal<br>
grain size became 0.4 to 0.9 µm, the apparent relative<br>
dielectric constant εrAPP became 5,010 to 6,310, and the<br>
resistivity logρ became 10.0 to 10.4. That is, it was found<br>
that a semiconductor ceramic having good electrical<br>
characteristics, such as the apparent relative dielectric<br>
constant εrAPP of 5,000 or more and the resistivity logp of<br>
10 or more, was able to be obtained in spite of the fact<br>
that the average crystal grain size was 1.0 µm or less.<br>
Regarding Sample Mo. 7, the average crystal grain size<br>
was 1.0 µm or less, but a somewhat large 0.9 µm. The reason<br>
for this is believed that the formulation mole ratio m of<br>
the Sr site to the Ti site (= Sr site/Ti site) was a small<br>
0.995. That is, it is believed that if the formulation mole<br>
ratio m is excessively deviated from the stoichiometric<br>
composition and becomes too small, the average crystal grain<br>
size tends to become coarse.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
In Example 2, samples (semiconductor ceramic capacitors<br>
having a single plate structure) of Sample Nos. 21 to 25<br>
were produced by changing the oxygen partial pressure in the<br>
cooling process of the primary firing, the samples having<br>
the same compositions as those of Sample Nos. 1 and 2 in<br><br>
- 43 -<br>
[Example 1], and the effect of an increase in the oxygen<br>
partial pressure was checked.<br>
That is, ceramic compacts having the compositions shown<br>
by Sample Nos. 21 to 25 in Table 2 were prepared by the<br>
method and the procedure similar to those in [Example 1].<br>
The resulting ceramic compact was cut into a size 5 mm long<br>
and 5 mm wide and, thereafter, a binder removal treatment<br>
was conducted in an air atmosphere at a temperature of 250°C<br>
and, furthermore, in a weak reducing atmosphere at a<br>
temperature of 800°C for 5 hours.<br>
Primary firing was conducted in a strong reducing<br>
atmosphere, in which the ratio of flow rate of a H2 gas to a<br>
N2 gas was set in such a way as to satisfy H2:N2 = 1:100, at<br>
a temperature of 1,200°C to 1,250°C for 2 hours. At this<br>
time, the cooling treatment was conducted until the firing<br>
furnace became 800°C while the oxygen partial pressure PO2<br>
was adjusted in such a way that the oxygen partial pressure<br>
ratio ∆PO2 (= oxygen partial pressure during cooling/oxygen<br>
partial pressure during firing) became the value shown in<br>
Table 2. That is, in the cooling treatment, steam was<br>
supplied to the firing furnace at the time of starting of<br>
the cooling process, and furthermore, the supply rate of the<br>
H2 gas was decreased, if necessary, while a zirconia oxygen<br>
sensor was inserted into the firing furnace and the<br>
electromotive force E, that is, the oxygen partial pressure<br><br>
- 44 -<br>
PO2, in the firing furnace was measured so as to control the<br>
oxygen partial pressure ratio ∆PO2 at the value shown in<br>
Table 2.<br>
Subsequently, the secondary firing was conducted in an<br>
air atmosphere at a temperature of 800°C for 1 hour to apply<br>
a reoxidation treatment so as to produce a grain boundary<br>
insulation type semiconductor ceramic. Both end surfaces<br>
were coated with In-Ga. In this manner, samples of Sample<br>
Nos. 21 to 25 were produced.<br>
Regarding each sample of Sample Nos. 21 to 25, the<br>
average crystal grain size, the apparent relative dielectric<br>
constant εrAPP, and the resistivity logp were determined by<br>
the method and the procedure similar to those in [Example 1j.<br>
Table 2 shows the compositions of crystal grains and<br>
crystal grain boundaries of Sample Nos. 21 to 25 and the<br>
measurement results. For purposes of comparison,. Sample Nos.<br>
1 and 2 produced in [Example 1] are shown in Table 2 again.<br><br><br><br>
- 46 -<br>
Comparisons are made between Sample No. 1 and Sample<br>
Nos. 21 to 23. Regarding Sample No. 21, the oxygen partial<br>
pressure ratio ∆PO2 was 2.3 x 103 and, therefore, was 1.0 x<br>
104 or less in spite of the fact that the oxygen partial<br>
pressure was increased during the cooling. Consequently,<br>
the resistivity logρ was at the same level as that of Sample<br>
No. 1 in which the oxygen partial pressure during the<br>
cooling was not increased. As a result, an increase in<br>
resistivity logρ based on the effect of an increase in<br>
oxygen partial pressure did not occur.<br>
On the other hand, regarding Sample No. 22, it was<br>
found that the oxygen partial pressure ratio ∆PO2 was 1.0 x<br>
104 and the resistivity logp increased to 10.8.<br>
Furthermore, regarding Sample No. 23, the oxygen<br>
partial pressure ratio ∆PO2 was a larger 2.7 x 10 and the<br>
resistivity logp was 11.2. Therefore, it was found that the<br>
resistivity logp further increased.<br>
Likewise, comparisons were made between Sample No. 2<br>
and Sample Nos. 24 and 25. Sample No. 2 was conducted in<br>
the strong reducing atmosphere and the oxygen partial<br>
pressure was not increased during the cooling of the primary<br>
firing. Therefore, the resistivity logp did not exceed 10.0.<br>
On the other hand, regarding Sample No. 24, the cooling<br>
treatment was conducted while the oxygen partial pressure<br>
ratio ∆PO2 was set at 1.8 x 104 and, therefore, the<br><br>
- 47 -<br>
resistivity logp increased to 10.5. Regarding Sample No. 25,<br>
it was found that since the cooling treatment was conducted<br>
while the oxygen partial pressure ratio ∆PO2 was set at a<br>
larger 3.8 x 105 , the resistivity logp further increased to<br>
10.7.<br>
As described above, it was found that by setting the<br>
oxygen partial pressure ratio ∆PO2 at 1.0 x 104 or more<br>
during the cooling, the resistivity logp was able to further<br>
increase while the apparent relative dielectric constant<br>
εrAPP of 5,000 or more was ensured and, therefore, the<br>
insulating property was able to be further improved. In<br>
addition, it was found that a semiconductor ceramic<br>
capacitor having a larger resistivity logp was able to be<br>
obtained by further increasing the oxygen partial pressure<br>
ratio ∆PO2 in the case where the composition and component<br>
of dielectric ceramic remained unchanged.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
In Example 3, semiconductor ceramic capacitors having a<br>
laminated structure were produced by using samples having<br>
the same composition as that of Sample No. 1 in [Example 1],<br>
and electrical characteristics were evaluated. In [Example<br>
3] as well, the treatment was conducted by changing the<br>
oxygen partial pressure in the cooling process of the<br>
primary firing.<br>
That is, ceramic slurries having the compositions shown<br><br>
- 48 -<br>
by Sample Nos. 31 and 32 in Table 3 were prepared by the<br>
method and the procedure similar to those in [Example 1].<br>
The resulting ceramic slurry was subjected to molding by<br>
using a lip coating method so as to prepare ceramic green<br>
sheets having a thickness of about 3.2 µm.<br>
An electrically conductive paste for internal electrode<br>
containing Ni as a primary component was prepared. The<br>
electrically conductive paste for internal electrode was<br>
used and an electrically conductive film with a<br>
predetermined pattern was formed on a surface of the ceramic<br>
green sheet by a screen printing method.<br>
One set of ceramic layers was prepared by sandwiching<br>
five ceramic green sheets provided with no electrically<br>
conductive film between the ceramic green sheets provided<br>
with the electrically conductive film. Ten sets of the<br>
ceramic layers were laminated, ceramic green sheets provided<br>
with no electrically conductive film were disposed on the<br>
top and the bottom of the resulting laminate, and thermal<br>
compression bonding was conducted. In this manner, a<br>
ceramic laminate was obtained.<br>
The resulting ceramic laminate was cut into a<br>
predetermined size and, thereafter, a binder removal<br>
treatment was conducted in an air atmosphere at a<br>
temperature of 250°C for 6 hours and, furthermore, in an<br>
atmosphere under a reduced pressure of 1.4 x 10-15 MPa at a<br><br>
- 49 -<br>
temperature of 800°C for 5 hours.<br>
Primary firing was conducted in a strong reducing<br>
atmosphere, in which the ratio of flow rate of a H2 gas to a<br>
N2 gas was set in such a way as to satisfy H2:N2 = 1:100, at<br>
a temperature of 1,200°C to 1,250°C for 2 hours, so that<br>
conversion to a semiconductor was effected. At this time,<br>
the cooling treatment was conducted while the oxygen partial<br>
pressure PO2 was adjusted in such a way that the oxygen<br>
partial pressure ratio ∆PO2 (= oxygen partial pressure<br>
during cooling/oxygen partial pressure during firing) became<br>
the value shown in Table 3 by the method similar to that in<br>
[Example 2].<br>
Subsequently, the secondary firing was conducted in an<br>
air atmosphere at a temperature of 800°C for 1 hour to apply<br>
a reoxidation treatment so as to produce a grain boundary<br>
insulation type semiconductor ceramic. The thus obtained<br>
semiconductor ceramic had a length of 2.0 mm, a width of 1.2<br>
mm, and a thickness of 1.0 mm, the thickness per<br>
semiconductor ceramic layer was 13 µm, and the number of<br>
laminated layers was 10 layers.<br>
Both end surfaces of the semiconductor ceramic were<br>
polished and, thereafter, both end surfaces were coated with<br>
In-Ga so as to form external electrodes. In this manner,<br>
samples of Sample Nos. 31 and 32 were produced.<br>
Regarding each sample of Sample Nos. 31 and 32, the<br><br>
- 50 -<br>
average crystal grain size, the apparent relative dielectric<br>
constant εrAPP, and the resistivity logp were determined by<br>
the method and the procedure similar to those in [Example 1].<br>
Table 3 shows the compositions of crystal grains and<br>
crystal grain boundaries of Sample Nos. 31 and 32 and the<br>
measurement results.<br><br><br><br>
- 52 -<br>
As is clear from Table 3, regarding each of Sample Nos.<br>
31 and 32, the average crystal grain size was 1.0 µm or less,<br>
the apparent relative dielectric constant εrAPP was 5,000 or<br>
more, and the resistivity logp was 11.0 or more. That is,<br>
it was found that the insulating property was able to be<br>
further improved while a high apparent relative dielectric<br>
constant εrAPP was ensured regarding the monolithic<br>
semiconductor ceramic capacitor as well.<br><br>
