Background Art<br>
Conventionally, an endoscope apparatus including an endoscope, a light source device, and the like has been widely used in a medical field and the like.    The endoscope apparatus in the medical field, in particular, is mainly used for the purpose of observation and the like in a living body as a subject to be inspected by an operator or the like.   As the light source device used in the above-described endoscope apparatus, there is proposed a light source device for endoscope in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-238846, for example.<br>
In addition, commonly known observation by using the endoscope apparatus in the medical field includes, for example, in addition to normal observation in which a subject in a living body is irradiated with white light to pick up an image of the subject generally the same as that in observation with the naked eye, narrow band observation (NBI: Narrow Band Imaging) in which an image of blood vessels and the like on a mucosa surface layer in a living body can be picked up with high contrast compared with the normal observation, by performing observation irradiating a subject with narrow-band light having a narrower wavelength band than illumination light in the normal observation.<br>

As shovm in FIG. 1, a living body observing apparatus 1 includes, as a main part: a living body image pickup device 2, for example an endoscope, for picking up an image of a subject 501 such as living tissue and the like in a living body as a subject to be inspected, to output the picked-up image as an image pickup signal; an image processing device 3 for generating a video signal based on the image pickup signal outputted from the living body image pickup device 2 to output the generated video signal; and a monitor 4, as display means, for displaying an image of the subject 501 picked up by the living body image pickup device 2, based on the video signal outputted from the image processing device 3.<br>
The living body image pickup device 2 includes an LED 21, a fluorescent member 22 configured of white paint and the like, for example, which emits fluorescence excited by excitation light emitted from the LED 21, an illumination optical system 23, an objective optical system 24, a color filter 25, and a CCD (charge coupled device) 26.<br>

As shown in FIG. 4, the image processing circuit 31 includes a pre-process circuit 311, a selector 312, a synchronizing circuit 313, and a post-process circuit 314.<br>
The pre-process circuit 311 performs processings such as amplification, A/D conversion, and correlated double sampling on the image pickup signal outputted from the CCD 26, and thereafter outputs the image pickup signal subjected to the processings to the selector 312.<br>
The selector 312 outputs, based on the control signal outputted from the control circuit 33, an R component, a G component, and a B component, as each of the color components in the image pickup signal outputted from the pre-process circuit 311, to the synchronizing circuit 313.<br>
The synchronizing circuit 313 includes memories 313a, 313b, and 313c.    The synchronizing circuit 313 stores each of the color components in the image pickup signal outputted from the selector 312 in the memories 313a, 313b, and 313c,<br><br>
respectively, and thereafter synchronously outputs the color components to the post-process circuit 314.<br>
The post-process circuit 314 performs, based on the control signal outputted from the control circuit 33, processings such as color conversion, y correction, and D/A conversion on the image pickup signal outputted from the synchronizing circuit 313. Then, the post-process circuit 314, by performing the above-described processings, converts the image pickup signal into a video signal and outputs the video signal to the monitor 4.<br>
Based on the control signal outputted from the control circuit 33, the LED drive circuit 32 supplies a driving voltage to cause the LED 21 to emit light.<br>
The control circuit 33 such as a CPU (central processing unit) outputs control signals to the selector 312 and the post-process circuit 314 in the image processing circuit 31, and the LED drive circuit 32 to cause the selector 312, the post-process circuit 314, and the LED drive circuit 32 to respectively perform processings according to the observation mode, based on an observation mode changeover signal outputted through the operation panel 34.<br>
The operation panel 34 includes an observation mode changeover switch and the like for outputting an observation mode changeover signal to give instruction for changing over the observation mode in the living body image pickup device 2 and the image processing device 3 by an operation by an operator or the like, for example.<br>
Next, description is made on working of the living body observing apparatus 1 according to the present embodiment.<br>
An operator or the like turns on a power source of each of the devices of the living body observing apparatus 1, that is, the living body image pickup device 2, the image processing device 3, and the monitor 4 to bring each of the devices into an activation state. Note that in the above-described activation state, it is assumed that the living body image pickup device 2 and the image processing device 3 are set in a normal observation mode.<br>
After that, the operator or the like operates and moves the living body image pickup device 2 such that a desired subject in a living body is located in a position<br><br>
within a field of view of the objective optical system 24, which is illuminated by narrow-band light emitted from the illumination optical system 23.<br>
The image of the subject 501 illuminated by the narrow-band light emitted from the illumination optical system 23 in the state as described above is formed by the objective optical system 24, subjected to color separation by the color filter 25, and picked up by the CCD 26, and thereafter outputted to the image processing circuit 31 of the image processing device 3 as an image pickup signal.<br>
The image pickup signal outputted from the CCD 26 to the image processing circuit 31 is subjected to processings such as amplification, A/D conversion, and correlated double sampling in the pre-process circuit 311, then, via the selector 312, subjected to synchronization in the synchronizing circuit 313, and thereafter inputted to the post-process circuit 314.<br>
The post-process circuit 314 performs, based on the control signal outputted from the control circuit 33, processings such as color conversion, yγ correction, and D/A conversion in the normal observation mode on the image pickup signal outputted from the synchronizing circuit 313 so as to achieve natural color reproduction generally the same as that in a state where the subject is observed with the naked eye, for example, and then outputs the image pickup signal subjected to the processings to the monitor 4 as a video signal.<br>
As a result that the above-described controls and processings are performed in the living body image pickup device 2 and the image processing device 3, on the monitor 4 is displayed the image of a desired subject in a living body generally the same as one in a case where the subject is observed with the naked eye, as a subject image in the normal observation mode based on the video signal outputted from the image processing device 3.<br>
When an instruction is given to change over the observation mode in the living body image pickup device 2 and the image processing device 3 for example from the normal observation mode to the narrow band observation mode by an operation of the observation mode changeover switch provided on the operation panel 34 by an operator or the like, the observation mode changeover signal based on the<br><br>
instruction is outputted to the control circuit 33 through the operation panel 34.<br>
The control circuit 33 outputs control signals to the selector 312 and the post-process circuit 314 in the image processing circuit 31, and the LED drive circuit 32 to cause the selector 312, the post-process circuit 314 and the LED drive circuit 32 to respectively perform processings according to the observation mode, based on the observation mode changeover signal outputted through the operation panel 34.<br>
Based on the control signal outputted from the control circuit 33, the selector 312 in the image processing circuit 31 outputs the G component in the image pickup signal outputted from the pre-process circuit 311 to one of the memories 313a, 313b, and 313c included in the synchronizing circuit 313, and outputs the B component in the image pickup signal outputted from the pre-process circuit 311 to the two memories other than the above-described one memory out of the memories 313a, 313b, and 313c included in the synchronizing circuit 313.   Note that, it is assumed that, in the narrow band observation mode according to the present embodiment, the R component in the image pickup signal outputted from the pre-process circuit 311 is cut off by the selector 312 and the R component is not used in the subsequent processings.<br>
The image pickup signal having two B components and one G component which is outputted from the selector 312 as a result of the above-described processing is subjected to synchronization in the synchronizing circuit 313 to be inputted to the post-process circuit 314.<br>
The post-process circuit 314 performs, based on the control signal outputted from the control circuit 33, processings such as color conversion, y correction, and D/A conversion in the narrow band observation mode on the image pickup signal outputted from the synchronizing circuit 313 so as to achieve color reproduction of the blood vessels, the minute structure and the like of the mucosa surface layer of the subject in the living body with high contrast, for example, and thereafter outputs the image pickup signal subjected to the processings to the monitor 4 as a video signal.<br>
More particularly, the post-process circuit 314 performs, as the above-described color conversion processing in the narrow band observation mode, for example, processings so as to multiply one of the two B components in the image<br><br>
pickup signal outputted from the synchronizing circuit 313 by a weighting factor kl, the other of the two B components by a weighting factor k2 and the G component by a weighting factor k3.    After performing the color conversion processing of the above-described content, the post-process circuit 314 further performs, based on a B channel signal composed of B component multiplied by the weighting factor kl, a G channel signal composed of B component multiplied by the weighting factor k2, and an R channel signal composed of G component multiplied by the weighting factor k3, processings such as y correction and D/A conversion on the signal obtained by composing each of the channel signals to generate a video signal, and thereafter outputs the generated video signal to the monitor 4.<br>
Note that it is assumed that the weighting factors kl, k2, and k3 used in the color conversion processing of the above-described content are real numbers.   The weighting factors kl, k2, and k3, for example, may be respectively set to desired values by an operator or the like by operation of the operation panel 34, or may be fixed values set in advance in the post-process circuit 314.   Furthermore, the weighting factors kl, k2, and k3 may be respectively different values, or any two of the factors or all the factors may be the same.<br>
As a result that the above-described controls and processings are performed in the living body image pickup device 2 and the image processing device 3, on the monitor 4 is displayed an image in which the colors of the blood vessels, the minute structure and the like of the mucosa surface layer of the subject in the living body are reproduced with high contrast, as a subject image in the narrow band observation mode based on the video signal outputted from the image processing device 3.<br>
Note that the living body image pickup device 2 as an endoscope configured to realize the above-described working may be configured, in addition to the above-described configuration, as an oral camera 2A as shown in FIG. 5, for example, having on outer surface thereof an observation mode changeover switch 27 through which an observation mode changeover signal generally the same as one outputted through the operation panel 34 is outputted to the control circuit 33 of the image processing device 3 when operated by an operator or the like.<br><br>
When observation in the narrow band observation mode is performed in a state where the oral camera 2A is used instead of the living body image pickup device 1, on the monitor 4 is displayed an image in which the colors of the region in the oral cavity in the living body where plaque, tooth decay, and gingival inflammation exist are reproduced with high contrast, as a subject image in the narrow band observation mode.<br>
Note that, as for the subject images in the normal observation mode and the narrow band observation mode which are displayed on the monitor 4 based on the video signal outputted from the image processing device 3, only either one of the images may be displayed in accordance with the changeover of the observation mode, or both of the images may be displayed separately on the monitor 4.<br>
As described above, the living body observing apparatus 1 of the present embodiment is capable of adjusting the color of the subject image in the two kinds of observation modes, that is, the normal observation mode and the narrow band observation mode, depending on each of the observation modes.   Therefore, in the observation using the living body observing apparatus 1, the operator or the like can perform the narrow band observation without using a dedicated device such as another light source device, for example.    As a result, the time period to be spent on the observation of the subject in a living body can be reduced compared with the observation using a conventional apparatus.<br>

As shown in FIG. 6, a living body observing apparatus 101 includes, as a main part: a living body image pickup device 102 which is an endoscope, for example, for picking up an image of a subject 501 such as living tissue and the like in a living body as a subject to be inspected, to output the picked-up image as an image pickup signal; an image processing device 103 for generating a video signal based on the image pickup signal outputted from the living body image pickup device 2 to output the generated video signal; the monitor 4 having generally the same configuration as that in the first embodiment; and a light source device 5 for supplying illumination light to illuminate the subject 501 to the living body image pickup device 102.<br>
The living body image pickup device 102 includes the illumination optical system 23 having generally the same configuration as that in the first embodiment, the objective optical system 24 having generally the same configuration as that in the first embodiment, the CCD (charge coupled device) 26 having generally the same configuration as that in the first embodiment, and a light guide 28 provided so as to be inserted through inside of the living body image pickup device 102.<br>
The light guide 28 composed of an optical fiber and the like includes one end having a light incident surface arranged on the light source device 5 side, and the other end having a light emitting surface arranged on a light incident side of the illumination optical system 23.    With the above-described configuration of the light guide 28, the illumination light supplied from the light source device 5 is transmitted by the light guide 28 to be emitted to the subject 501 via the illumination optical system 23.<br>
The image processing device 103 as image processing means in the living body observing apparatus 101 includes the image processing circuit 31 having generally the same configuration as that in the first embodiment, an LED drive circuit 132, the control circuit 33 having generally the same configuration as that in the first embodiment, and the operation panel 34 having generally the same configuration as<br><br>
that in the first embodiment.<br>
Based on the control signal outputted from the control circuit 33, the LED drive circuit 132 sequentially supplies for a predetermined time period a driving voltage to a red LED 51a, a green LED 51b, and a blue LED 51c, to be described later, which are provided in the light source device 5, to turn on each of the LEDs, as shown in FIG. 7, for example.<br>
The light source device 5 includes: an LED group 51 composed of the red LED 51a, the green LED 51b, and the blue LED 51c, as illumination means in the living body observing apparatus 101; a mirror 52 for reflecting light emitted from the LED group 51; and a light condensing optical system 53 for condensing light reflected from the mirror 52 to make the light incident onto the light incident surface of the light guide 28.<br>
The red LED 5la, the green LED 51b, and the blue LED 51c included in the LED group 51 as color separation means in the living body observing apparatus 101 respectively emit lights including wavelength bands shown in FIG. 8, for example, based on the driving voltage supplied from the LED drive circuit 132.    Specifically, the red LED 51a emits light including the wavelength band of 600 nm to 630 nm, the green LED 51b emits light including the wavelength band of 530 nm to 560 nm, and the blue LED 51c emits light including the wavelength band of 400 nm to 430 nm. When the driving voltage is sequentially supplied for a predetermined time period to each of the LEDs included in the LED group 51 itself, as shown in FIG 7 for example, the LED group 51 emits frame-sequential and narrow-band light as the illumination light for illuminating the subject 501.<br>
Next, description will be made on working of the living body observing apparatus 101 according to the present invention.<br>
An operator or the like turns on a power source of each of the devices of the living body observing apparatus 101, that is, the living body image pickup device 102, the image processing device 103, the monitor 4, and the light source device 5 to bring each of the devices into an activation state.   Note that in the above-described activation state, it is assumed that the living body image pickup device 102 and the<br><br>
image processing device 103 are set in a normal observation mode.<br>
After that, the operator or the like operates and moves the living body image pickup device 102 such that a desired subject in a living body is in a position within a field of view of the objective optical system 24, which is illuminated by frame-sequential and narrow-band light emitted from the light source device 5 via the light guide 28 and the illumination optical system 23.<br>
The image of the subject 501 illuminated by the frame-sequential and narrow-band light emitted from the light source device 5 via the light guide 28 and the illumination optical system 23 in the state as described above is formed by the objective optical system 24 to be picked up by the CCD 26, and thereafter outputted to the image processing circuit 31 of the image processing device 3 as an image pickup signal.<br>
The image pickup signal outputted from the CCD 26 to the image processing circuit 31 is subjected to processings such as amplification, A/D conversion, and correlated double sampling in the pre-process circuit 311 as generally the same processings as those described in the description of the first embodiment, and then, via the selector 312, subjected to the synchronization in the synchronizing circuit 313 to be inputted to the post-process circuit 314.<br>
The post-process circuit 314 performs, based on the control signal outputted from the control circuit 33, processings such as color conversion, γ correction, and D/A conversion in the normal observation mode on the image pickup signal outputted from the synchronizing circuit 313 as generally the same processings as those described in the description of the first embodiment, and then outputs the image pickup signal subjected to the processings to the monitor 4 as a video signal.<br>
As a result that the above-described controls and processings are performed in the living body image pickup device 102 and the image processing device 103, on the monitor 4 is displayed the image generally the same as one in a case where the desired subject in the living body is observed with the naked eye, as a subject image in the normal observation mode based on the video signal outputted from the image processing device 103.<br><br>
When an instruction is given to change over the observation mode in the living body image pickup device 102 and the image processing device 103, for example, from the normal observation mode to the narrow band observation mode by an operation of the observation mode changeover switch provided on the operation panel 34 by an operator or the like, the observation mode changeover signal based on the instruction to the control circuit 33 is outputted through the operation panel 34.<br>
The control circuit 33 outputs, based on the observation mode changeover signal outputted from the operation panel 34, control signals to the selector 312 and the post-process circuit 314 in the image processing circuit 31, and the LED drive circuit 132 to cause the selector 312, the post-process circuit 314, and the LED drive circuit 132 to respectively perform processings according to the observation mode.<br>
Based on the control signal outputted from the control circuit 33, the selector 312 in the image processing circuit 31 outputs to one of the memories 313a, 313b, and 313c included in the synchronizing circuit 313 an image pickup signal (hereinafter abbreviated as G signal), which is outputted from the pre-process circuit 311, based on the image of the subject 501 picked up by the CCD 26 when the subject 501 is illuminated by the light emitted from the green LED 51b.    Furthermore, based on the control signal outputted from the control circuit 33, the selector 312 in the image processing circuit 31 outputs to the two memories other than the above-described one memory out of the memories 313a, 313b, and 313c included in the synchronizing circuit 313 an image pickup signal (hereinafter abbreviated as B signal), which is outputted from the pre-process circuit 311, based on the image of the subject 501 picked up by the CCD 26 when the subject 501 is illuminated by the light emitted from the blue LED 51c.   Note that, it is assumed that, in the narrow band observation mode according to the present embodiment, the image pickup signal, which is outputted from the pre-process circuit 311, based on the image of the subject 501 picked up by the CCD 26 when the subject 501 is illuminated by the light emitted from the red LED 51a, is cut off by the selector 312 and is not used in the subsequent processings.<br>
Then, the image pickup signal having the two B signals and one G signal which is outputted from the selector 312 as a result of the above-described processings<br><br>
is subjected to synchronization in the synchronizing circuit 313, and thereafter inputted to the post-process circuit 314.<br>
The post-process circuit 314 performs, based on the control signal outputted from the control circuit 33, processings such as color conversion, γ correction, and D/A conversion in the narrow band observation mode on the image pickup signal outputted from the synchronizing circuit 313 so as to achieve color reproduction of the blood vessels, the minute structure and the like of the mucosa surface layer of the subject in the living body with high contrast, for example, and thereafter outputs the image pickup signal subjected to the processings to the monitor 4 as a video signal.<br>
More particularly, the post-process circuit 314 performs, as the above-described color conversion processing in the narrow band observation mode, for example, processings so as to multiply one of the two B signals in the image pickup signal outputted from the synchronizing circuit 313 by a weighting factor kl, the other of the two B signals by a weighting factor k2, and the G signal by a weighting factor k3.   After performing the color conversion processing of the above-described content, the post-process circuit 314 further performs, based on a B channel signal composed of B signal multiplied by the weighting factor kl, a G channel signal composed of B signal multiplied by the weighting factor k2, and an R channel signal composed of G signal multiplied by the weighting factor k3, processings such as γ correction and D/A conversion on the signal obtained by composing each of the channel signals to generate a video signal, and thereafter outputs the generated video signal to the monitor 4.<br>
Note that it is assumed that the weighting factors kl, k2, and k3 used in the color conversion processing of the above-described content are real numbers.    The weighting factors kl, k2, and k3, for example, may be respectively set to desired values by an operator or the like by operation of the operation panel 34, or may be fixed values set in advance in the post-process circuit 314.    Furthermore, the weighting factors kl, k2, and k3 may be respectively different values, or any two of the factors or all the factors may be the same.<br>
As a result that the above-described controls and processings are performed in<br><br>
the living body image pickup device 102 and the image processing device 103, on the monitor 4 is displayed an image in which the colors of the blood vessels, the minute structure and the like of the mucosa surface layer of the subject in the living body are reproduced with high contrast, as a subject image in the narrow band observation mode based on the video signal outputted from the image processing device 103.<br>
As described above, the living body observing apparatus 101 of the present embodiment is capable of adjusting the color of the subject image in the two kinds of observation modes, that is, the normal observation mode and the narrow band observation mode, depending on each of the observation modes, similarly as the living body observing apparatus 1 of the first embodiment.    Therefore, in the observation using the living body observing apparatus 101, the operator or the like can perform the narrow band observation without using a dedicated device such as another light source device, for example.    As a result, the time period to be spent on the observation of the subject in a living body can be reduced compared with the observation using a conventional apparatus.<br>
Note that it is needless to say that the present invention is not limited only to the above-mentioned embodiments, but may be modified and embodied in various forms without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
