				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to a superconductive field coil winding in a<br>
synchronous rotating machine. More particularly, the present invention relates to a<br>
rotor core that supports a superconducting field winding assembly in a synchronous<br>
machine.<br>
Synchronous electrical machines having rotor field coil windings include, but are not<br>
limited to, rotary generators, rotary motors, and linear motors. These machines<br>
generally comprise a stator and rotor that are electromagnetically coupled. The rotor<br>
may include a multi-pole rotor core and one or more field coil windings mounted on<br>
the rotor core. The rotor cores may include a magnetically-permeable solid material,<br>
such as an iron-core rotor.<br>
Conventional copper windings are commonly used in the rotors of synchronous<br>
electrical machines. However, the electrical resistance of copper windings (although<br>
low by conventional measures) is sufficient to contribute to substantial heating of the<br>
rotor and to diminish the power efficiency of the machine. Recently, superconducting<br>
(SC) field coil windings have been developed for rotors. SC windings have<br>
effectively no resistance and are highly advantageous rotor coil windings.<br>
Iron-core rotors saturate at an air-gap magnetic field strength of about 2 Tesla.<br>
Known superconductive rotors employ air-core designs., with no iron in the rotor, to<br>
achieve air-gap magnetic fields of 3 Tesla or higher. These high air-gap magnetic<br>
fields yield increased power densities of the electrical machine, and result in <br>
significant reduction in weight and size of the machine. Air-core superconductive<br>
rotors require large amounts of superconducting wire. The large amounts of SC wire<br>
add to the number of coils required, the complexity of the coil supports, and the cost<br>
of the SC coil windings and rotor.<br><br><br>
High temperature SC rotor coil field windings are formed of superconducting<br>
materials that are brittle, and must be cooled to a temperature at or below a critical<br>
temperature, e.g., 27°K, to achieve and maintain superconductivity. The SC windings<br>
may be formed of a high temperature superconducting material, such as a BSCCO<br>
(BixSrxCaxCuxOx) based conductor.<br>
High temperature superconducting (HTS) coil windings are sensitive to degradation<br>
from high bending and tensile strains. These coils must undergo substantial<br>
centrifugal forces that stress and strain the coil windings. Normal operation of<br>
electrical machines involves thousands of start up and shut down cycles over the<br>
course of several years that result in low cycle fatigue loading of the rotor.<br>
Furthermore, the HTS rotor coil windings should be capable of withstanding 25%<br>
over-speed operation during rotor balancing procedures at ambient temperature, and<br>
at occasional over-speed conditions at cryogenic temperatures during power<br>
generation operation. These over-speed conditions substantially increase the<br>
centrifugal force loading on the rotor coil windings over normal operating conditions.<br>
SC coils used as the HTS rotor field winding of an electrical machine are subjected to<br>
stresses and strains during cool-down and normal operation. These coils are subjected<br>
to centrifugal loading. torque transmission, and transient fault conditions. To<br>
withstand the forces, stresses, strains and cyclical loading, the SC coils should be<br>
properly supported in the rotor by a coil support system. These coil support systems<br>
hold the SC coil(s) in the HTS rotor and secure the coils against the tremendous<br>
centrifugal forces due to the rotation of the rotor. Moreover, the coil support system<br>
protects the SC coils, and ensures that the coils do not prematurely crack, fatigue or<br>
otherwise break.<br>
Developing coil support systems for HTS coil has been a difficult challenge in<br>
adapting SC coil windings to HTS rotors. Examples of coil support systems for HTS<br>
rotors that have previously been proposed are disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos.<br>
5,548,168; 5,532,663; 5,672,921; 5,777,420, 6,169,353, and 6,066,906. However,<br>
these coil support systems suffer various problems, such as being expensive, complex<br>
and requiring an excessive number of components. There is a long-felt need for a<br>
2<br><br>
HTS rotor having a coil support system for a SC coil. The need also exists for a coil<br>
support system made with low cost and easy to fabricate components.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A multi-piece rotor core for a superconducting synchronous machine has been<br>
developed. The rotor core includes passages transverse to the rotor axis. Through<br>
these passages extend coil support bars that are coupled to a superconducting coil<br>
winding. The coil winding extends around the rotor core, and is generally in a plane<br>
that includes the rotor axis. The rotor core has flat sides that are adjacent the long <br>
sides of the coil winding.<br>
The rotor core is assembled from several rotor core sections. These sections are<br>
generally disk shaped and have a T-shaped cross-section. The rotor core sections<br>
have connection bosses to engage slots in adjacent rotor core sections. The core<br>
sections are assembled around a pre-formed superconducting winding and coil<br>
support. The assembly of rotor core sections form a solid core, except for the support<br>
bar passages that extend through the core axis. The core sections are held together by<br>
tie rods that extend through the assembly of sections. The rods are parallel to the<br>
rotor core axis and extend the length of the core.<br>
Tension bars that extend between the sides of the rotor coil can provide support so<br>
that the coil will withstand the centrifugal forces of the rotor. To support opposite<br>
sides of the coil, the tension bars extend through rotor core. There is a desire to<br>
assembly the tension bar and coil winding before both are mounted on a rotor core.<br>
However, a solid rotor core will not allow for pre-assembly of the coil and tension<br>
members. Thus, there is a need for a rotor core and assembly technique that will<br>
allow an assembled coil and tension member to be mounted on a solid rotor core.<br>
An assembly of rotor core sections permits the rotor core to be assembled around a<br>
coil winding assembly. The coil winding assembly may be assembled with the<br>
winding support to form a pre-formed coil winding assembly prior to the rotor core<br>
assembly. Pre-assembly of the field coil and winding support should reduce the rotor-<br>
3<br><br>
coil production cycle, improve coil support quality, and reduce coil assembly<br>
variations.<br>
The HTS rotor may be for a synchronous machine originally designed to include SC<br>
coils. Alternatively, the HTS rotor may replace a copper coil rotor in an existing<br>
electrical machine, such as in a conventional generator. The rotor and its SC coils are<br>
described here in the context of a generator, but the HTS coil rotor is also suitable for<br>
use in other synchronous machines.<br>
In a first embodiment, the invention is a rotor in a synchronous machine, comprising:<br>
a superconducting field winding assembly having a coil winding and at least one<br>
winding support extending between opposite sides of the winding, and a rotor core<br>
formed of a plurality of rotor core sections, each of said core sections having a slot to<br>
receive said winding support.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention is a rotor core and winding assembly<br>
comprising: separable rotor core sections assembled around the winding assembly to<br>
form said rotor core, where said core sections are axially aligned with said rotor core,<br>
and said winding assembly includes a pre-assembled a superconducting field winding<br>
and a center winding support.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is a method for assembling a rotor core around<br>
a superconducting field coil winding assembly comprising the steps of: fabricating<br>
said field coil winding assembly by assembling a field coil winding and a coil support<br>
prior to assembly of the rotor core, inserting a portion of each of a plurality of rotor<br>
core sections partially through said coil winding assembly, assembling the plurality of<br>
rotor core sections around said coil support, and securing the assembly of rotor core<br>
sections.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIGURE 1 shows an exemplary synchronous generator machine 10 having a stator 12<br>
and a rotor 14. The rotor includes field winding coils that fit inside the cylindrical<br>
rotor cavity 16 of the stator. The rotor fits inside the rotor cavity of the stator. As the<br>
rotor turns within the stator, a magnetic field 18 (illustrated by dotted lines) generated<br>
by the rotor and rotor coils moves/rotates through the stator and creates an electrical<br>
current in the windings of the stator coils 19. This current is output by the generator<br>
as electrical power.<br>
The rotor 14 has a generally longitudinally-extending axis 20 and a generally solid,<br>
multi-piece rotor core 22. The rotor core is an assembly of axially-aligned end core<br>
sections 44 and middle core sections 46. The core 22 has high magnetic permeability,<br>
and is usually made of a ferromagnetic material, such as iron. In a low power density<br>
superconducting machine, the iron core of the rotor is used to reduce the<br><br>
magnetomotive force (MMF), and, thus, minimize the amount of superconducting<br>
(SC) coil wire needed for the coil winding.<br>
The rotor 14 supports at least one longitudinally-extending, racetrack-shaped, high-<br>
temperature superconducting (HTS) field winding assembly 33 having an HTS<br>
winding (See Fig. 2). The HTS field coil winding may be alternatively a saddle-shape<br>
or have some other shape that is suitable for a particular HTS rotor design. A rotor<br>
field assembly and coil support is disclosed here for a racetrack SC field winding.<br>
The rotor core assembly and coil support may be adapted for winding configurations<br>
other than a racetrack field winding mounted on a solid rotor core.<br>
The rotor includes a pair of end shafts 24, 30 that are supported by bearings 25. The<br>
end shafts may be coupled to external devices. For example, one of the end shafts 24<br>
has a cryogen transfer coupling 26 to a source of cryogenic cooling fluid used to cool<br>
the SC field windings in the rotor. The cryogen transfer coupling 26 includes a<br>
stationary segment coupled to a source of cryogen cooling fluid and a rotating<br>
segment which provides cooling fluid to the HTS winding. This end 24 of the rotor<br>
may also include a collector 31 for electrically connecting to the rotating SC field<br>
winding. The opposite end shaft 30 of the rotor may be driven by a power turbine<br>
coupling 32.<br>
FIGURE 2 shows an exemplary HTS racetrack field winding assembly 33 comprising<br>
a field coil winding 34 and a series of tension bars 35 (the coil support) extending<br>
between opposite sides of the winding. The winding assembly 33 is fabricated with<br>
the field winding 34 and tension bars 35 before the assembly 33 is inserted into the<br>
rotor core. The tension bars support the field coil windings with respect to the<br>
centrifugal forces that act on the windings as the rotor spins during operation.<br>
Accordingly, the tension bars are attached to the windings by a winding housing 36<br>
(as shown in FIGURE 8). The housing and tension bars restrain the expansion of the<br>
field coil winding 34 that would otherwise occur with the tension bars 35.<br>
The SC field windings 34 of the rotor includes a high temperature superconducting<br>
(SC) winding 34. Each SC winding includes a high temperature superconducting<br>
6<br><br>
conductor, such as a BSCCO (BixSrxCaxCuxOx) conductor wires laminated in a solid<br>
epoxy impregnated winding composite. For example, a series of BSCCO 2223 wires<br>
may be laminated, bonded together and wound into a solid epoxy impregnated<br>
winding.<br>
SC wire is brittle and easy to be damaged. The SC winding is typically layer wound<br>
SC tape that is epoxy impregnated. The SC tape is wrapped in a precision winding<br>
form to attain close dimensional tolerances. The tape is wound around in a helix to<br>
form the racetrack SC winding 34.<br>
The dimensions of the racetrack winding are dependent on the dimensions of the rotor<br>
core. Generally, each racetrack SC winding encircles the magnetic poles of the rotor<br>
core, and is parallel to the rotor axis. The field windings are continuous around the<br>
racetrack. The SC windings form a resistance free electrical current path around the<br>
rotor core and between the magnetic poles of the core. The winding has electrical<br>
contacts 41 that electrically connect the winding to the collector 31.<br>
Fluid passages 38 for cryogenic cooling fluid are included in the field winding 34.<br>
These passages may extend around an outside edge of the SC winding 34. The<br>
passageways provide cryogenic cooling fluid to the porous winding and remove heat<br>
from the winding. The cooling fluid maintains the low temperatures, e.g., 27° K, in<br>
the SC field winding needed to promote superconducting conditions, including the<br>
absence of electrical resistance in the winding. The cooling passages have an input<br>
and output fluid ports 39 at one end of the rotor core. These fluid (gas) ports 39<br>
connect the cooling passages 38 on the SC winding to the cryogen transfer coupling<br>
26.<br>
Each HTS racetrack field winding 34 has a pair of generally straight side portions 40<br>
parallel to a rotor axis 20, and a pair of end portions 42 that are perpendicular to the<br>
rotor axis. The side portions of the field coil winding are subjected to the greatest<br>
centrifugal stresses. Accordingly, the side portions are supported by the tension bars<br>
and housing. These bars and housing form a winding support system that counteract<br>
the centrifugal forces that act on the winding.<br>
7<br><br>
FIGURE 3 is a schematic diagram of a multi-piece rotor core 22 with the winding<br>
assembly 33, including the racetrack superconducting coil field winding 34 and<br>
tension bars 35. The iron core is made of multiple core sections, which are generally<br>
several middle sections 44 and a pair of end sections 46. Each of the core sections<br>
have a semi-rectangular shape (see Fig. 7) with a pair of opposite flat sides 50 and a<br>
pair of opposite arc-shaped sides 52.<br>
When assembled, the flat sides 50 of the core sections are in alignment with each<br>
other, and similarly the arc-shaped sides arc also in alignment. The middle core<br>
sections 44 have a generally "T" shape in cross sections, except for the two end<br>
sections (compare Figures 5 and 6). The end sections 46 have a generally L-shaped<br>
cross section.<br>
The sections of the rotor core are assembled around the winding assembly 33. During<br>
assembly of the core, the narrow head 45 of each middle section slides between<br>
adjacent support bars 35 in the winding assembly. The narrow head of the end rotor<br>
core sections 46 slide between a tension bar 35 and an end 42 of the coil winding 34.<br>
Each of the core sections has at least one tension rod slot 53 (middle sections 44 have<br>
a pair of opposite slots) which when mated with the slot in an opposite core forms an<br>
aperture 55 for a tension bar 35. The assembly of rotor core sections permits<br>
integrating a fully assembled winding assembly 33 (which includes, for example, field<br>
winding 34 and tension bars 35) into the rotor core.<br>
The core sections 44, 46 may be iron core forgings. The rotor core sections are<br>
assembled through rabbit fits for concentricity and alignment. Each core section has<br>
at least one boss 54 (middle sections have a pair of opposing bosses) that fit into a slot<br>
56 on an adjacent core section. The boss-slot connection between the core sections<br>
aligns the core sections in the rotor core. Several tie-rods 58 extend laterally through<br>
rod holes 60 along the length of the rotor core The tie rods have a nut or other faster<br>
at each end and hold the core sections together in compression.<br>
A vacuum housing 64 may be formed over the field winding 34, once the rotor core<br>
sections have been assembled around the winding assembly. A vacuum around the<br>
8<br><br>
winding facilitates the superconducting characteristics of the winding The vacuum<br>
housing provides a vacuum over the entire race-track shape of the coil winding.<br>
While the invention has been described in connection with what is presently<br>
considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood<br>
