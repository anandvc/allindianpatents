				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to bioregulatory active substances<br>
with an inorganic structural frame and a method for its<br>
synthetic production as well as its isolation from various<br>
starting materials. The application of these active<br>
substances as such or in combination with other active<br>
substances for enzyme regulation and bioregulation is also<br>
described.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The proper course of biochemical processes and the optimal<br>
function of biological immune mechanisms is ensured by<br>
numerous bioregulatory active substances. From a chemical<br>
standpoint, bioregulatory active substances known up to now<br>
are peptides, carbohydrates, steroids or lipids, whereby<br>
these structural elements can also occur together (for<br>
example, glycopeptides, lipoproteins). Furthermore, the<br>
application of bioregulatory active substances for the<br>
therapy of diseases which are caused by defective functions<br>
in one or more of thess regulation mechanisms is known. The<br>
therapeutic use of steroid hormones, corticosteroids and<br>
cardiac glycosides as well as growth hormones or blood<br>
coagulation factors are some of the many examples in this<br>
sense. However, pharmacotherapy with substances of this<br>
type is very often accompanied by damaging side-effects, and<br>
therewith, considerably limited. A detailed consideration<br>
of these aspects is to be found in Goodman and Gilman's "The<br>
Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics", 8th Ed., New York,<br>
1991. For example, with cardiac glycosides, the positive<br>
inotropic, therapeutically useful action is compromised by a<br>
cardiotoxic side-effect, and consequently, therapeutic doses<br><br>
must be very rigorously limited. As a further example, the<br>
application of corticosteroids may be mentioned where the<br>
therapeutic use is only recommended in very severe cases and<br>
only for a limited time due to a series of very severe side-<br>
effects such as myopathy, osteoporosis, psychic<br>
disturbances, increased infection susceptibility, etc..<br>
Despite considerable efforts to treat immunologically caused<br>
disease syndromes with immunoregulatory active substances,<br>
previous clinical tests are not convincing.<br>
The purpose of such immunotherapeutic applications would be<br>
to accomplish the basic therapy for autoimmune diseases such<br>
as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, among<br>
others, which has not been found to date. According to E.<br>
Sercarz and S. K. Datta "Autoimmunity" in Current Biology 6,<br>
875-881 (1995), these autoimmune diseases have mostly been<br>
caused by disturbed immunoregulation. For fighting severe<br>
disease syndromes which are characterized by a considerably<br>
weakened immune system, such as carcinosis or AIDS, the<br>
previous therapeutical uses of immunoregulatory substances<br>
has yielded little.<br>
Several bioregulatory peptides and proteins have been<br>
characterized as reported in the Monograph from M. J.<br>
Clemens "Cytokines", Oxford 1991. That cytokines play an<br>
important role in different carcinoses, in autoimmune<br>
diseases and in viral infections (including AIDS) has also<br>
already been reported several times. Despite this, wider<br>
therapeutic applications of these and other bioregulatory<br>
proteins and peptides are still lacking to a large extent.<br>
One of the causes for this certainly lies in the often very<br>
laborious production technologies: the extractions and<br>
subsequent purifications of bioregulatory active substances<br>
from human or animal tissue fluids, where they are present<br>
in only very small amounts, is completely unsuitable for<br>
providing therapeutically needed amounts. The danger of<br><br>
allergic side-effects and/or anaphylactic reactions which,<br>
despite their rare occurrence, represent a considerable risk<br>
factor for human therapy that still exists with gene<br>
technologically produced bioregulatory polypeptides or<br>
glycoproteins. The fundamental problem of the therapeutic<br>
applications of several "in vitro" highly active polypeptide<br>
factors lies in the fact that they demonstrate "in vivo"<br>
entirely different, mostly very much weaker activity. On<br>
the one hand, numerous physical and enzymatic barriers<br>
impede the externally administered peptides and proteins<br>
from reaching the location of the pathological event (focus<br>
of inflammation, cancerous ulcer, etc.). On the other hand,<br>
they are quickly neutralized and metabolized by the<br>
endogenous enzymes and other factors present there. With<br>
peroral administration of active substances of a peptide,<br>
glycopeptide and glycosidic nature, these substances are<br>
already rendered practically ineffective in the gastro-<br>
intestinal system by several degradation processes.<br>
However, a relatively fast degradation of bioregulatory<br>
active substances of peptidic or glycopeptidic nature must<br>
also be taken into account with a delivery "per os". In<br>
order to entirely target the therapeutically effective<br>
concentration to the location of the pathological event or<br>
manifestations, such as at the focus of inflammation or at<br>
the cancerous ulcer, a masked delivery of the active<br>
substance has been performed for example. Something similar<br>
was described by R. Collier and D. Kaplan in "Immuntoxins",<br>
Heidelberg 1988, in connection with the use of toxins which<br>
could be purposefully employed bound to monoclonal<br>
antibodies( drug targeting). However, the treatment<br>
technique is still very complicated and only remains<br>
restrictively applicable for specific cases. For regulatory<br>
active substances, the bioavailability is not only dependent<br>
on stability, but also on purely physical processes, such as<br>
solubility and membrane permeability. This concerns making<br><br>
the water solubility of lipophilic substances possible in<br>
plasma or making the membrane permeability of hydrophilic<br>
active ingredients such as Na+ or K+ ions possible. For<br>
example, the mitochondria membrane is normally not permeable<br>
to potassium ions. Cyclic antibiotics such as nonactin or<br>
valinomycin make this permeability possible through the<br>
organic envelopment of the corresponding ions. Since 1967,<br>
numerous new compounds have been produced which have a<br>
macro-ring structure and make a cryptate-like covering of<br>
inorganic ions or smaller molecules possible.<br>
However, important prerequisites for a direct therapeutic<br>
application of such cryptate-forming substances are a low<br>
toxicity and good bioassimilation, which is only seldom<br>
fulfilled by the synthetically produced cryptand reagents.<br>
Many fundamental bioregulatory mechanisms are controlled by<br>
the so-called sodium pump. This enzyme has the ability to<br>
pump sodium ions from the insides of cells to the outside<br>
and simultaneously transport potassium ions in the opposite<br>
direction. The energy consumption is met by a coupled<br>
hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This pump is<br>
identical with the enzyme referred to as the Na+, K+-ATPase<br>
and is ubiquitously distributed. Several important cellular<br>
functions are controlled by this Na+,K+-ATPase such as cell<br>
volume, heat production, intracellular free Ca2+ ion<br>
concentration, neuronal transmission, muscle contraction or<br>
membrane potential.<br>
In numerous immunoregulatory processes, important phases are<br>
also controlled by the Na+,K+-ATPase, and thus, the sodium<br>
pump also acquires a fundamental roll in immunoregulation.<br>
Despite this general distribution and significance, the<br>
regulation mechanism of this enzyme has not yet been<br>
clarified. The so-called "cardiac glycoside receptor site"<br>
of the enzyme is suspected as the functional location for<br><br>
the bioregulation of the sodium pump. The cardiac glycosides<br>
present is several plant species are bound to this site with<br>
high affinity and exert their cardiotonic, but also their<br>
cardiotoxic effect. However, their toxicity proves that<br>
they are not identical with the endogenous ligands of this<br>
enzyme. In the paper "Endogenous digitalis-like factors" by<br>
W. Schoner in Progress in Drug Research, 41, 249-291 (1993),<br>
it is reported that the chemical nature and the structure of<br>
these endogenous bioregulatory substances could not yet be<br>
established despite a large research effort. Up to now, no<br>
sufficient amount of these endogenous factors could be<br>
isolated from animal tissue and fluids in order to make an<br>
exact characterization and structure determination possible.<br>
The activity of the Na+,K+-ATPase, and therewith several<br>
bioregulatory mechanisms, could be effectively controlled<br>
with these factors which are identical or structurally<br>
similar to these endogenous ligands.<br>
Recently/ several simple inorganic substances have been<br>
found which participate in bioregulatory processes.<br>
However, it is important to note that all of these inorganic<br>
substances are only used as simple messenger substances or<br>
effectors. They fundamentally lack the three-dimensional<br>
structure necessary for exerting a bioregulatory action and<br>
the capability for structure specific action coupled<br>
therewith. In the paper "Biological Roles of Nitric Oxide"<br>
by S. Snyder and D. Bredt in Scientific American, 1992 (5)<br>
22-29, it is reported that this gaseous compound is a<br>
functional effector in the control of the non-specific<br>
immune response. In the organism, nitric oxide had a very<br>
short life time in order to exert its local, mostly toxic<br>
effect and is always produced "in situ". When the<br>
phagocytes of the immune system, the so-called macrophages,<br>
are activated with bacterial toxins or cytokines, they can<br>
produce relatively large amounts of nitric oxide within<br>
hours and this is employed as an immunological weapon. It<br><br>
is assumed that further simple gaseous compounds also<br>
participate in bioregulatory processes. Ethylene, for<br>
example, is known as an important factor in plant biology.<br>
Carbon monoxide participates in the physiological regulation<br>
of the cyclization of guanosine monophosphate (GMP) as was<br>
reported by A. Verma in Science, 259, 381 (1993).<br>
Only very little has been reported up to now on the<br>
biological action of another carbon oxide, the much more<br>
seldom found C3O2. It is only known that this concerns a<br>
compound which is gaseous at room temperature (BP. 7°C) , is<br>
irritating to mucus membranes and smells of mustard oil and<br>
acrolein. Carbon suboxide represents a relatively strong<br>
blood toxin which irreversibly binds hemoglobin; the<br>
tolerability limit in mice lies at 0.2-0.4 % C3O2 in dry<br>
air. C3O2 reacts with water and forms malonic acid.<br>
However, without traces of mineral acids, this reaction does<br>
not proceed so fast as it was previously claimed. It is<br>
suspected that, aside from carbon monoxide, the original<br>
reducing earth atmosphere also contained considerable<br>
amounts of C3O2, and recently, evidence of its possible<br>
presence in interstellar space was found as reported by W.<br>
Huntress et al. in Nature, 352, 316-318 (1991). However,<br>
until now there is no concrete evidence for the possible<br>
presence of C3O2 in biological fluids. Considering the<br>
water sensitivity of the monomer gas as well as the<br>
amorphous polymer, a possible biological role has been<br>
mostly excluded a priori. The hypothesis of H. Yanagawa and<br>
F. Egami, whereby the water reactive amorphous polymer could<br>
have been a possible starting material for the original<br>
synthesis of simple organic compounds, has been considered<br>
as fundimentally possible.<br>
Gaseous C3O2 more or less quickly forms amorphous polymers<br>
which are yellow to intensive red-brown colored. Only very<br>
little concrete knowledge is known on the structure of these<br><br>
polymers. In general, they are described as a non-<br>
homogeneous amorphous mass which was also earlier designated<br>
as 'red carbon". The chemical properties of carbon suboxide<br>
and its polymers are reviewed in the paper by T. Kappe and<br>
E. Ziegler, Agnew. Chem., 86, 529 (1974). The<br>
polymerization products are partially soluble in water or in<br>
diluted alkalines, whereby intensive yellow to dark brown<br>
colored solutions form. Several hypothetical formulae have<br>
been proposed for the structure of these amorphous,<br>
irregular polymers, but none of them could also be<br>
experimentally confirmed. As the most probable, a graphite-<br>
like, hexagonal lattice structure is suspected which is<br>
unsaturated at the periphery and must be correspondingly<br>
unstable. This hypothesis was described in detail in the<br>
paper by N. S. Smith and D. A. Young in Inorganic Chemistry<br>
2, 829 (1963) .<br>
It is further known that several biologically highly<br>
effective substances in plasma are not found as such, but<br>
rather as conjugates. For example, steroid hormones are<br>
present in blood plasma as their sulfate or glucuronate<br>
conjugates and their degradation products are also<br>
eliminated as such conjugates. Not infrequently, these<br>
conjugated steroids demonstrate even better therapeutic<br>
properties in comparison with the pure active substance, as<br>
was described for conjugated estrogen, steroids according to<br>
US 2,565,115 and US 2,720,483 or for dehydroepiandrosterone<br>
sulfate (DHEAS). The above mentioned conjugations regulate<br>
the biological availability and the assimilation of these<br>
steroid active substances and can therewith explain the<br>
improved therapeutic properties. Relatively little is known<br>
about the regulation of the bioavailability of polypeptidic<br>
active substances by the formation of corresponding<br>
conjugates. The enzymatic conjugation of proteins with<br>
ubiquitin also has regulatory functions as was described in<br>
Trends Biochemical Sciences 15, 195 (1990). The suitable<br><br>
conjugation of polypeptidic substances could attain a<br>
breakthrough in the therapeutic applications of these active<br>
substances. As a known example, the search for long-term<br>
acting insulin is to be mentioned. It is known that the<br>
therapeutic functional time of insulin is considerably<br>
prolonged by addition of zinc salts or of protamine sulfate.<br>
However, these additives can cause different side-effects.<br>
A suitable conjugate which should ensure a retarded release<br>
of insulin has been tried by numerous authors, but until now<br>
has not be realized.<br>

bioregulatory active substances in which the above mentioned<br>
disadvantages do not appear and which bring about the<br>

Structure Description<br>
The bioregulatory active substances according to the<br>
invention are chemical compounds whose structural frame is<br>
built from the simple inorganic carbon suboxide C3O2 by<br>
cyclooligomerization. Although carbon suboxide O=C=C=C=O<br>
itself and the amorphous polymers formed from it are known<br>
as reactive, water sensitive substances, the author could<br>
astonishingly obtain particular water stable cyclooligomeric<br>
carbon suboxide structures. The basic prerequisite for<br>
stability is that these structures no longer contain the<br>
reactive cumulated C=C and C=O double bonds of carbon<br>
suboxide. This is solved according to the invention such<br>
that several, preferably six, carbon suboxide molecules form<br>
4-pyrone or 2-pyrone rings which are condensed with each<br>
other and these additionally close in a macro-ring<br>
structure.<br><br><br>
Basically, these frames which are built from cyclooligomeric<br>
carbon suboxide are not organic compounds and belong, as<br>
well as carbon suboxide itself, to inorganic chemistry.<br>
The chemical formula of the cyclooligomeric carbon suboxide<br>
frames closed to macro-rings is as follows:<br><br>
wherein n denotes the degree of cyclooligomerization of C3O2<br>
and co symbolizes the above named type of linkage of these<br>
units.<br>
Furthermore, the author has found that among the endlessly<br>
large number of principally possible structures of<br>
cyclooligomeric carbon suboxides closed by macro-rings, only<br>
a few with certain n values are particularly stable. Those<br>
cyclooligomeric macro-ring frames are preferred in which the<br>
number n equals 4, 6 or 10 or is a multiple of 4, 6 or 10 in<br>
the formula <br>
Active substances according to the invention with these<br>
preferred n values can also be considered as derivatives of<br>
the cyclohexameric carbon suboxide with the formula co-<br><br>
co-(C3O2H)6- This first member of the series of cyclooligomeric<br>
carbon suboxides defined here has a particular importance<br>
and is described in detail in the following.<br>
Cyclohexameric Carbon Suboxide co-(C3O2)6<br>
The molar mass M = 408.19 determined experimentally by mass<br>
spectrometry corresponds to the formula C18O12 and at the<br>
same time to the six-fold molar mass of the carbon suboxide<br>
M = 68.032. For the structure, several isomer possibilities<br>
are conceivable, for example with head-to-head linkages or<br>
the following depicted structure with six alternating head-<br>
to-tail condensed 4-pyrone rings which is assumed as the<br>
most probable based on spectral and other properties.<br><br>
The actual electron distribution presumably lies closer to<br>
the zwitterion structure denoted as pyrylium because this is<br>
additionally stabilized in comparison to the pyrone<br>
structure.<br>
Hydorxy-pyran and Pyrylium Salt Derivatives<br>
The existence of derivatives of the formula (C3O2)6.H1-6 of<br>
cyclohexameric carbon suboxide is also visible in the mass<br>
spectrum (Fig. 1). In aqueous solution, the active<br>
substances according to the invention can also be present as<br><br>
hydorxy-pyran derivatives. The general formula of the<br>
hydorxy-pyran derivatives formed by several-fold addition of<br>
hydrogen is:<br><br>
wherein the number m of the bound hydrogen atoms is limited<br>
by the number n of the exacyclic oxygen atoms, and thus, m<br>
is ≤ n.<br>
The hydorxy-pyran derivative of the cyclohexamer with the<br>
formula<br><br>
and the molar mass M = 414.24 has a particular importance<br>
for the formation of inorganic and organic derivatives and<br>
is, together with co-(C3O2)6, the basic unit for the<br>
formation of self-associates and different derivatives. The<br>
presumed 4-hydorxy-pyran structure of the cyclohexameric<br>
carbon suboxide CO-(C3O2H)6 is depicted as follows:<br><br>
In general, in the presence of strong acids, the positive<br>
charges arising through protonation of the exacyclic oxygen<br>
atoms are neutralized by the corresponding OH- ions or acid<br>
anions An. For the formation of pyrylium salt compounds,<br><br>
acids or bases as well as several easily dissociating salt<br>
compounds formed from anions An and cations Ka are<br>
considered. The chemical formula of the pyrylium salt<br>
derivatives which are formed from the active substances<br>
according to the invention with an acid, a base or a salt<br>
compound of the general formula Ka.An is:<br><br>
wherein Ka and An are the cationic the anionic counter ions<br>
which neutralize the altogether 2n zwitterionic charges of<br>
the pyrylium frame. The structure of the pyrylium salt<br>
compounds can be depicted as follows, wherein the counter<br>
ions are not exactly localized in the aqueous solution.<br><br>
The anionic An and cationic Ka counter ions can be present<br>
-as individual and uniform inorganic or organic cations and<br>
anions, for example all Ka = Na+ and all An = Cl-,<br>
-as a mixture of inorganic or of organic cations and anions,<br>
for example in a relationship corresponding to the<br>
physiological concentrations of these ions or<br>
-as zwitterionic compounds themselves containing both<br>
counter ions such as amino acids, betaine, ionic soaps.<br><br>
In water, the pyrylium salt derivatives of the active<br>
substances according to the invention are mostly very<br>
soluble. The somewhat lower solubility of pyrylium salts<br>
with anions such as chloride of sulfate in acetone or<br>
ethanol is used in the isolation according to the invention<br>
of the active substances described here.<br>
In physiological fluids, the zwitterionic charges of the<br>
active substances are neutralized by the anions and cations<br>
present there. Accordingly, it is more appropriate to speak<br>
of a statistic distribution of the counter ions than of<br>
chemically unified salt compounds of a certain ion. Certain<br>
complexes formed with metal ions, preferably transition<br>
metal ions such as Fe(III), Sb(III), Cd(II), Pt(II),<br>
Au(III), Pb(IV), can be used for the isolation and for the<br>
detection of the active substances according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The compounds formed with complex inorganic or organic<br>
anions such as SCN-, BF4-, Cr2O72-, MnO4-, picrate,<br>
reineckate, can also be used for isolation and for<br>
detection.<br>
Adducts, Conjugates<br>
The formation of molecular adducts with inorganic elements<br>
or with organic compounds is promoted by the strong capacity<br>
for association of the cyclooligomeric and macro-ring closed<br>
carbon suboxides according to the invention. The<br>
stochiometric or non-stochiometric adducts with organic<br>
compounds are denoted as conjugates. Cyclohexameric carbon<br>
suboxide can form stable adducts with several, preferably 2<br>
to 6, molecules of ammonia, organic amines, amino acids,<br>
peptides or other substances with amine function. The<br>
general formula of these amine adducts is:<br><br><br>
wherein R1, R2 and R3 is each a hydrogen atom or an organic<br>
residue and m is a number from 1 to 6. Experimentally, the<br>
molar mass of the diamine adduct with the formula co-<br>
(C3O2) 6. (NH3)2 was established by ES mass spectrometry as M =<br>
442.2 and the hexamine adduct with the formula co-<br>
(C3O2)6. (NH3)6 as M = 510.4 (Fig.2). With the hexamine<br>
adducts, the two ammonia or amine molecules are probably<br>
bound to the carbonyl groups of the pyrone rings by hydrogen<br>
bonds. Since in the case of the diamine complexes the<br>
internal cavity of the macro-ring structure is presumably<br>
already involved, these are better considered as host-guest<br>
complexes.<br>
Host-Guest Complexes<br>
The second particularly important structural property of the<br>
active substances according to the invention is accomplished<br>
in such a manner that the preferably six condensed pyrone or<br>
pyrylium rings additionally form macro-rings according to<br>
the invention, preferably in cylindrical form. The<br>
molecular dimensions of this ring structure are suitable for<br>
the inventive formation of host-guest complexes according to<br>
the invention. As "guests", elements smaller molecules or<br>
molecule fragments are considered which fit sterically into<br>
the cylindrical cavity with the diameter from 2.9-3.2 A<br>
and/or are bound to their periphery by specific binding<br>
forces. The form and dimensions of the cylindrical macro-<br>
ring structure of the cyclohexameric carbon suboxide are<br>
taken from the following figure.<br><br><br>
Cations such as potassium, ammonium, silver or rubidium or<br>
anions such as fluoride, chloride, formate or rhodanate fit<br>
well in the inner cylindrical cavity of the macro-ring with<br>
an inner diameter of 2.9 to 3.2 A and a height of 4.9 to 5.2<br>
A. In the applications according to the invention, an ion<br>
or a neutral element or molecule is present in the cavity of<br>
the cylindrical macro-ring structure of a co-(C3O2)6 unit and<br>
is enveloped by this. The molar mass measured by mass<br>
spectrometry corresponds to the sum of the individual<br>
components and proves that these host-guest complexs are<br>
independent compounds. The author has experimentally<br>
established the existence of host-guest complexes of the<br>
cyclohexameric carbon suboxide with smaller inorganic or<br>
organic compounds, generally denoted with Y, such as<br>
ammonia, hydroxylamine, methanol, ethanol, propanol,<br>
acetone, dichloromethane, chloroform, acetylcholine, formic<br>
acid, acetic acid as well as with several amino acids and<br>
carbohydrates. According to the invention, the substance Y<br>
or a part of its structure is present as a "guest" in the<br>
inner cavity of the active substance according to the<br>
invention as it is to be taken from the following figure.<br><br><br>
Through this "envelopment" certain properties of the<br>
substance Y are "masked" and the newly obtained properties<br>
according to the invention, such as improved membrane<br>
transport and bioavailability, are made possible.<br>
Active Substances of Different Molar Mass<br>
M ≤ 2, 000 Dalton<br>
The above described cyclooligomeric carbon suboxides with<br>
the formula, co-(C3O2)n, wherein n is 4, 6, 10, 12 or 18, as<br>
such or in hydorxy-pyran form with the formula co-(C3O2H)6,<br>
and all their derivatives, adducts, host-guest complexes<br>
whose molar mass lie under this limit belong in this<br>
category. The self-associates formed from 2 to 4<br>
cyclohexameric units are also considered as low molar mass<br>
active substances. Such self-associations are stabilized by<br>
the neutralization from several zwitterionic charges. The<br>
existence of the dimers with the molar mass M = 816 D and of<br>
the trimers with M = 1,224 D identified by the author are<br>
explained therewith.<br>
M &gt; 2,000<br>
At first, the active substances classified here appear as a<br>
mixture of compounds with heterogeneous molar mass. However,<br>
a closer analysis has proven that, despite the principally<br>
endlessly large number of possible compounds, only very few,<br><br>
i.e. those with a particular molecular size, are obtainable<br>
and capable of being identified. The LC-MS, Electrospray<br>
mass spectrum (Fig. 3) of an active substance in water-<br>
acetonitrile solution demonstrates that a series of multiply<br>
charged ions (m/z) is present. The measured m/z = 1,225.7<br>
Dal of the most intensive component A31 has exactly the<br>
three-fold mass of the cyclohexameric carbon suboxide M =<br>
408.2. The experimental molar mass of this polymeric active<br>
substance is determined with the aid of the formula M = n<br>
[m/z-1] (page 202, Practical Mass Spectrometry by J. R.<br>
Chapmann, J. Wiley, New York, 1993) as M = 31 x 1,224.6 =<br>
37,962.6 Dal. The molar masses of some of the identified<br>
compounds are to be taken from the following table.<br><br>
* in comparison with known standards<br>
** average value of three experimental calculations<br><br>
The measurements were carried out with the aid of MALDI mass<br>
spectrometry (MS), gel permeation chromatography (GP) or<br>
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). As evident from<br>
the MALDI mass spectrum (Fig. 4), the corresponding<br>
compounds for n = 60, and especially where n = 72, are<br>
present is clearly larger concentrations than all others.<br>
The molar masses determined by this method correspond with<br>
very good accuracy to n = 60 and n = 72 in the formula co-<br>
(C3O2H)n of the hydorxy-pyran oligomers. These compounds can<br>
be considered either as cyclooligomers with n = 60 or n = 72<br>
or as s = 10- or s = 12-fold self-associates of the<br>
cyclohexameric basic unit {co- (C3O2) 6}s • The physico-<br>
chemical and spectroscopic properties of these compounds co-<br>
(C3O2H)60 and co-(C3O2H)72 indicate a high structural<br>
symmetry which would be explainable for example with a<br>
spherical arrangement of 10, 12 or more co- (C3O2H)6 units.<br>
A sandwich arrangement with pentagonal or hexagonal symmetry<br>
could also explain the neutralization of a large number of<br>
zwitterionic charges.<br>
The experiments with the aid of polyacrylamide gel<br>
electrophoresis (PAGE) have shown a strong band in the<br>
region of M ~ 5 kD and optionally further lines at the molar<br>
mass values of ca. 10 kD, 12.5 kD, 15 kD, 30 kD, 60 kD and<br>
120 kD. These correspond with acceptable accuracy to the<br>
degrees of oligomerization n = 72, 144, 180, 216, 432, 864<br>
and 1,728. Strangely enough, these numbers represent<br>
particular multiples of the numbers 6 and 12. With a 16.5%<br>
polyacrylamide concentration of the gel, the strongest band<br>
by far is present in the range M ~ 5 kD. However, if the<br>
same sample is applied to a different gel, for example with<br>
lower polyacrylamide content, the main band can appear at a<br>
two-fold greater region (~ 10 kD) . This anomaly is<br>
explained by specific association-dissociation equilibria of<br>
the active substances.<br><br>
Association Equilibria and Membrane Transport<br>
The author has also determined particular anomalies in the<br>
dialysis and ultrafiltration of the compounds with higher<br>
molecular weight. After a certain dialysis time, the<br>
larger, normally non-membrane permeable active substances<br>
were detectable on both sides of the membrane. The<br>
explanation for this is that the higher associates according<br>
to the following equation 1 dissociate into smaller membrane<br>
permeable forms and these re-form by self-association into<br>
the larger associates in the outward dialysate. After<br>
longer dialysis time, an equilibrium develops on both sides<br>
of the membrane.<br>
{CO~(C3O2H) 6}s {co-(C3O2H)6}s-P + {CO-(C3O2H) 6}p (1)<br>
wherein s = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10 or 12 as well as a multiple of<br>
these numbers and p 
cyclohexamer and it multiply associated derivatives with a<br>
higher molar mass is dependent on numerous factors or can be<br>
influenced for example by the nature of the solvent, the pH<br>
value, the concentration of the alkali metal and other ions,<br>
the temperature and the conjugation with other substances<br>
present in the solution. The equilibrium (1) enables<br>
penetration of active substances according to the invention<br>
with larger molar mass into the intracellular space which<br>
are normally blocked to this access. In the external<br>
membrane space, the active substances according to the<br>
invention can be present as larger co- (C3O2H)n compounds.<br>
Through dissociation according to equation (1), these active<br>
substances can pass through the membrane and thus arrive in<br>
the internal membrane space where they re-form the larger<br>
compounds by association.<br><br><br>
external membrane space	internal membrane space<br>
Due to their stability, the larger self-associates can also<br>
serve for the physiological storage and the transport of<br>
active substances and thus reach the location of the<br>
pathological manifestation. They display their<br>
bioregulatory, therapeutic effect there as such or<br>
conjugated with other active substances. A "masked"<br>
membrane transport of a membrane impermeable substance Y can<br>
be carried out according to the invention in such a manner<br>
that this substance is "hidden" in the cylindrical inner<br>
cavity of the active substance.<br>
Spectroscopic Characterization<br>
In general, the molecular spectra of the active substances<br>
according to the invention are relatively band-poor which<br>
coincides with the high symmetry of the corresponding<br>
structures. The infrared spectrum taken in KBr pellets<br>
(Fig. 5) demonstrates several characteristic absorption<br>
bands at 3500-3000 cm-1, 1680-1620 cm-1, 1400-1385 cm-1,<br>
1210 cm-1, 1100 cm-1, and between 830-600 cm-1, whereby the<br>
strong band at 1660 cm-1 is interpreted as a "ring breathing<br>
frequency" of the 4-pyrone ring. The absence of an IR<br>
absorption band at 1720 cm-1 make a 2-pyrone structure<br>
improbable.<br><br>
The strongest absorption maximum of the UV-VIS spectra lies<br>
at ca. 190 nm with shoulders at ca. 220 nm and 265 nm (Fig.<br>
6) . As evident, instead of the expected strong absorption<br>
of the conjugated double bonds at ca. 320 nm, only a weak,<br>
non-specific sloping absorption from 240 to 400 nm is<br>
present. However, the author found for some adducts<br>
fluorescence emission in the range of 400-450 nm produced by-<br>
excitation radiation at 310-340 nm. This can indicate that<br>
a stronger but symmetrically forbidden transition is<br>
present.<br>
Analytical Reactions<br>
The active substances of the formula co-(C3O2)n can be<br>
identified by a positive reaction with antimony<br>
pentachloride or with the Liebermann-Burchard reagent in<br>
thin layer chromatography. Silica gel-60 ready-to-use<br>
plates (Merck) and a elution mixture of 1-<br>
propanol:ethylacetate:and 20% acetic acid in the ratio<br>
60:10:30 are used for the separation. As a spray reagent, a<br>
saturated antimony pentachloride solution in carbon<br>
tetrachloride or a mixture of 2 ml acetic anhydride and 2 ml<br>
concentrated sulfuric acid in 20 ml absolute ethanol is<br>
used. After spraying, the plates are heated ca. 10 minutes<br>
at 120°C and examined in UV light at λ = 365 nm. Fluorescing<br>
spots indicate the presence of the active substances<br>
according to the invention.<br>
The active substances in the form of their amine adducts<br>
exhibit a positive yellow ninhydrin reaction which can be<br>
used for their analytical detection or a spectrophotometric<br>
assay. Since this reaction is also exhibited by most amino<br>
acids and peptides, the analytic use is only suitable after<br>
a chromatographic separation. For a thin layer<br>
chromatography separation, silica gel-60 ready-to-use plates<br><br>
(Merck) and a mixture of 1-butanol:ethanol:water in the<br>
ratio of 50:30:20 (v/v) is used as an eluent. As a spray<br>
reagent, 0.1 % ninhydrin solution in ethanol which<br>
additionally contains 2 % (v/v) glacial acetic acid and 0.5<br>
% (v/v) sym-collidine is used. Yellow spots in the Rf<br>
region 0.32 to 0.45 indicate the presence of the active<br>
substances according to the invention.<br>
The hydorxy-pyran group of the active substances according<br>
to the invention exhibit a slightly positive phenol reaction<br>
with the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and this can be used for an<br>
identification. Since the known Lowry method for protein<br>
determination is also based on this reaction, a<br>
chromatographic separation from proteins or phenolic<br>
substances must be conducted first.<br>
For an analytical separation according to molecular size of<br>
the substances according to the invention, the HP-GP method<br>
(high performance gel permeation chromatography) is used.<br>
The separation is carried out, preferably in a TSK G-2000 SW<br>
(Toso-Haas) column 600 x 7.5 mm with 50 mM borate buffer<br>
solution (pH =8.1) as an eluent. The molar masses of the<br>
active substance components in the mixture are established<br>
by means of the measured retention volumes (Fig. 7) with the<br>
aid of a calibration diagram (Fig. 7A). Polyethylene glycol<br>
standards with known molecular weight are used for the<br>
calibration curve.<br>
For a chromatographic separation according to polarity of<br>
the components, the HPLC method with reversed phase is used,<br>
preferably with a Nucleosil 5 C18 column (Macherey Nagel) as<br>
a solid phase and with a, preferably 10 to 90 %,<br>
acetonitrile gradient in water as an eluent.<br>
It is characteristic for the pyrylium salt derivatives<br>
according to the invention that they exhibit the known<br><br>
analytical reactions of the counter ions, for example the<br>
precipitation of the halogenides with silver ions or the<br>
sulfate ions with barium.<br>
The active substances according to the invention exhibit a<br>
highly sensitive cross-reaction with the antibodies of<br>
cardiotonic steroid glycosides such as ouabain, digoxin and<br>
others. Since these organic compounds are not immunogenic<br>
as such, they are first chemically coupled to larger protein<br>
molecules such as BSA or avidin. By several fold<br>
administration of these conjugates to rabbits, the specific<br>
anti-ouabain or anti-digoxin antibodies are obtained. The<br>
cross-reaction of these antibodies with the active<br>
substances according to the invention is examined with the<br>
methods of enzyme-like immunoassay ELISA or radioimmunoassay<br>
(RIA) . These techniques permit a highly sensitive assay of<br>
very small amounts of active substances (pg range). The<br>
assay in the human body fluids can be disturbed by the<br>
presence of cardiac glycosides which are only present in a<br>
specific medical treatment of heart diseases.<br>
The active substances according to the invention of larger<br>
molar mass, M &gt; 2.0 kD, exhibit notable specific reactions<br>
with immunoglobulins. These immunospecific precipitation<br>
reactions with human or animal immunoglobulins are examined<br>
spectrophotometrically and by the Ouchterlouny method in<br>
agarose gel or by immunelectrophoresis according to Laurell.<br>
The notable difference between reactions with<br>
immunoglobulins from normal or from pathological sera<br>
enables the application of these reactions in the diagnosis<br>
of various immunopathologies.<br>
O-alkyl and O-acyl Derivatives<br>
Through the binding of inorganic or organic molecules of<br>
residues, designated by R, to the oxygen atoms of the basic<br><br>
frame, inorganic and/or organic derivatives or conjugates of<br>
the general formula:<br>
co-(C3O2)n.Rm<br>
are formed, wherein R = an inorganic or organic molecule<br>
and/or an organic residue, preferably methyl, ethyl, acetyl,<br>
benzyl, and m ≤ 2n.<br>
Production<br>
According to the invention, carbon suboxide, which as far as<br>
it is concerned can be produced by known methods, can be<br>
used as a starting material for the synthetic production of<br>
the active substances according to the invention.<br>
According to the invention, C3O2 purified by fractional<br>
distillation is photochemically converted into the<br>
cyclooligomeric derivatives or by use of suitable auxiliary<br>
agents. The synthesis of carbon suboxide is carried out in<br>
a known manner by two-fold water elimination from smaller<br>
dicarboxylic acids such as malonic acid or its derivatives<br>
under influence of phosphorous pentoxide and/or by heating.<br>
However, in this method the formation of the undesired<br>
amorphous polymeric carbon suboxide develops. In contrast<br>
to this, the author has established that a thermal<br>
dehydration of the acid or its esters carried out in an<br>
aprotic solvent is much more suitable for the formation of<br>
the active substances according to the invention. According<br>
to the invention, the acid or the corresponding derivative<br>
is dissolved in an aprotic solvent, preferably<br>
dimethylformamide or acetic anhydride, by heating and<br>
stirring. The mixture is heated to 120-150°C, whereby the<br>
formation of C3O2 already appears after a few minutes. For<br>
the conversion of the carbon suboxide produced in this<br>
manner into the cyclooligomeric active substances according<br><br>
to the invention, a photochemical activation is applied<br>
and/or suitable auxiliary agents are added according to the<br>
invention. Those substances which act as a type of template<br>
for the formation of the macro-ring structure were found as<br>
effective auxiliary agents. Preferred are stable salt<br>
compounds of those ions whose radius corresponds to the<br>
internal cavity of the co-(C3O2) 6 macro-ring, internal<br>
diameter 2.9-3.1 Å. Preferred ions are rubidium (2.94Å),<br>
potassium (2.66Å), ammonia (2.86Å) and fluoride (2.12Å).<br>
According to the invention, the inventive bioregulatory<br>
active substances can also be isolated from the side-<br>
products of some large-scale products starting from carbon<br>
monoxide.<br>
The author has surprisingly found that several known organic<br>
synthetic products whose industrial manufacture starts from<br>
carbon monoxide or from synthesis gas can contain low but<br>
detectable amounts of the active substances according to the<br>
invention. This can be explained with a low carbon suboxide<br>
content of CO and the synthesis gas. In order to increase<br>
the extremely low contents of active substances according to<br>
the invention in these large-scale products, fractional<br>
distillation methods are applied. 2 to 60 parts("parts"<br>
signifies "parts by weight" as long as nothing else is<br>
given), preferably 20 parts, water or aqueous buffer<br>
solution is added to 100 parts of the starting material,<br>
preferably industrial methanol produced from synthesis gas,<br>
and the methanol is at first distilled off from this mixture<br>
by application of a distillation column. The remaining<br>
water phase exhibits an increased content of the active<br>
substances according to the invention. By multiple<br>
repetition of the distillation with addition of fresh<br>
methanolic phases, a considerable concentration of the<br>
active substances according to the invention is obtained.<br>
The active substances according to the invention are<br><br>
isolated from this solution by application of fractional<br>
distillation or by absorption on solid phases, preferably<br>
charcoal, and desorption with the aid of solvent mixtures,<br>
preferably water-ethanol.<br>
According to the invention, the inventive active substances<br>
are also isolated from plant extracts, plant cell cultures<br>
or from bacterial cultures. Numerous plant species were<br>
examined in which the active substances according to the<br>
invention are not present as such, but instead, as undefined<br>
conjugates or other, preferably toxic, plant components.<br>
Preferable crude material sources are those plant species<br>
which contain toxic components such as alkaloids or<br>
cardiotoxic glycosides. Furthermore, plant species with a<br>
relatively high content of saponins or tannins also offer a<br>
suitable starting material for the isolation of the active<br>
substances according to the invention. Roots, rootstocks,<br>
stems, leaves, bark or seeds or the corresponding plant cell<br>
cultures which are initiated by callus formation in a known<br>
manner are suitable as plant sources.<br>
When the production of small molecular carbon suboxide<br>
derivatives, preferably co-(C3O2H)6, is desired, the<br>
following method is applied according to the invention: 10<br>
parts extraction agent, preferably 30 % of an alcohol-water<br>
mixture, is added to 1 part dried plant material de-fatted<br>
with hexane and macerated for 24 hours under light heating.<br>
The process is repeated several times, preferably 2-3 times,<br>
and the combined alcoholic extracts are concentrated. The<br>
concentrated tincture is boiled after addition of an acid,<br>
preferably sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid, in an amount<br>
from 0.01 to 5%, preferably 1%, with respect to the tincture<br>
and maintained for a short time, preferably 10-30 minutes,<br>
at 80-100°C. The cooled solution is neutralized with a base,<br>
preferably NH4OH, and treated with 1 to 20 parts, preferably<br>
5-10 parts, charcoal per 100 parts liquid. The filtered<br><br>
charcoal is washed again with water and filtered. The<br>
charcoal dried under vacuum is treated with boiling<br>
extraction agent, preferably 1:1 ethanol-water, and the<br>
process is repeated 2 times. The solution of the active<br>
substances according to the invention obtained in this<br>
manner is stable and suitable for long-term storage. The<br>
combined solutions can also be concentrated and freeze-<br>
dried. The purification of the solid residue occurs by<br>
repeated recrystallization, preferably from alcohol-ether<br>
mixtures. The adducts isolated in this manner are stable<br>
for long-term storage.<br>
When the production of high molecular cyclooligomeric carbon<br>
suboxide compounds is desired, the following method is<br>
applied according to the invention: 5-20, preferably 8,<br>
parts methanol are added to 1 part per weight dried plant<br>
material de-fatted with petroleum ether and macerated for 1<br>
to 36, preferably 16, hours with light heating. The process<br>
is repeated several times, preferably twice, and the<br>
combined extracts are concentrated. The concentrated<br>
solution is incorporated into a water miscible, organic<br>
solvent, preferably acetone or ethanol, in a ratio of 1:20<br>
to 1:2/ preferably 1:8. The precipitate formed is separated<br>
by filtration or centrifugation and dissolved in minimal<br>
amounts of water or a buffer solution. The entire process<br>
is repeated 1-5 times, preferably 2 times. The crude<br>
product obtained in this manner is dissolved in a minimal<br>
amount of water and subjected to a dialysis against<br>
distilled water by using membranes, preferable with an<br>
exclusion limit of 3 kD. After a longer dialysis time,<br>
preferably after 3-4 days, with several replacements of the<br>
external membrane water amounts, the internal membrane<br>
solution is filtered, carefully concentrated and freeze-<br>
dried.<br><br>
According to the invention, neutral absorbents or ionic<br>
solid phases, such as resins, gels or modified<br>
polysaccharides with ion exchange function are employed for<br>
the isolation of the inventive active substances of<br>
different molar mass. Due to the zwitterionic character of<br>
the active substances according to the invention, anionite -<br>
as well as cationite - or mixed bed exchange phases can be<br>
applied. At first, the extracts of vegetable or other<br>
origin are treated with the ion exchange phase. After the<br>
components are bound to the solid phase, the column is<br>
generously washed with an excess of neutral or weakly acidic<br>
eluent, preferably water or a buffer solution, until no<br>
customary contents (carbohydrates, amino acids) are<br>
detectable in the eluate. The desorption from the cationite<br>
phases occurs by using diluted mineral acids, preferably<br>
hydrochloric acid, or organic acids, preferably formic or<br>
acetic acid. The release of the active substances according<br>
to the invention bound to the anionic phases or mixed bed<br>
phases occurs by diluted alkali, preferably 0.1-0.3 molar<br>
ammonium or potassium hydroxide solution.<br>
According to the invention, the desorption from the neutral<br>
phases, such as silica gel, polyamides or various<br>
polysaccharides, occurs by using 0.2-5%, preferably 1.2%,<br>
sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) solutions or from 1 to 12 molar,<br>
preferably 8 molar, urea solutions.<br>
According to the invention, the separation and purification<br>
of the active substances of different molar mass according<br>
to the invention occurs with the aid of gel filtration or by<br>
membrane dialysis and ultrafiltration. For the separation<br>
of the active substances according to the invention<br>
according to their molecular sizes, gel chromatography is<br>
used with the aid of synthetic solid phases, preferably with<br>
Sephacryl 200, Sephadex LH-20 or TSK HW-60. As an eluent,<br>
weakly basic buffer solutions, preferably ammonium acetate<br><br>
or ammonium bicarbonate or a 0.01 to 0.3 molar, preferably<br>
0.15 molar, NaCl or KCl solution, are used. With these<br>
separation methods, the compound with higher molecular<br>
weight is first eluted and the smaller compounds such as co-<br>
(C3O2H)6 flow out of the column later.<br>
According to the invention, several conjugates which are<br>
formed from the active substances according to the invention<br>
with vegetable components can also be directly isolated.<br>
These mostly sticky, yellow-brown colored conjugates can be<br>
precipitated from the concentrated methanolic plant extracts<br>
by application of organic solvents, preferably acetone of<br>
diethyl ether. By several, preferably 3 to 5, repetitions<br>
of the precipitation, the conjugated obtained in this manner<br>
are relatively uniform. According to the invention, the<br>
following salting-out method can be used for the inventive<br>
cleavage of the conjugates. The conjugate is dissolved in<br>
water in which an inorganic salt, preferably ammonium<br>
sulfate, in an amount of 5 to 50% (w/w) , preferably 15%,<br>
with respect to the final solution is additionally<br>
dissolved. An organic solvent, preferably n-butanol or 2-<br>
propanol, is incorporated into this solution and this is<br>
intensely shaken. The phases are separated and the process<br>
is repeated 2 to 5 times, preferably 3 times, whereby the pH<br>
value of the agueous phase is adjusted with an acid to 1.<br>
After a further cleavage process according to the invention,<br>
the conjugate is dissolved in water, the pH value is<br>
adjusted to pH 10 with ammonia and the solution is stirred<br>
into a chlorinated solvent, preferably dichloromethane or<br>
chloroform, in a ratio of 1:0.5 to 1:6, preferably 1:2. The<br>
very stable, foamy emulsion formed by powerful shaking is<br>
separated and the organic solvent is removed therefrom under<br>
reduced pressure.<br>
The active substances according to the invention can also be<br>
isolated from bacterial starting materials. For this,<br><br>
bacterial cultures of various types, preferably BCG<br>
(Bacillus Cualmette-Guerin), Corynebacterium parvum or<br>
Escherichia coli can be used according to the invention.<br>
First, a physical treatment, preferably ultrasound<br>
treatment, and a hydrolysis by application of diluted<br>
mineral acids, preferably hydrochloric acid, is carried out.<br>
The filtered hydrolysate is optionally neutralized and<br>
applied to a solid phase, preferably silica gel. The solid<br>
phase is treated with various neutral elution agents until<br>
no amino acids, carbohydrates and other simple hydrolysis<br>
products are detectable in the eluate. The desorption of<br>
the active substances according to the invention occurs with<br>
the aid of diluted alkali, preferably with 0.1 to 0.2 molar<br>
ammonium hydroxide.<br>
Animal tissue and tissue fluids can contain small amounts of<br>
the active substances according to the invention as<br>
undefined conjugates. According to the invention, an<br>
organic extraction of the tissue of the carefully freeze-<br>
dried organic fluids, preferably urine, is first carried<br>
out. The active substances according to the invention are<br>
isolated and purified from the concentrated organic extract<br>
by using selective affinity chromatography methods. For<br>
this purpose, a known cardiac glycoside, preferably ouabain<br>
or hellebrin, is covalently bound to a solid phase,<br>
preferably Sepharose. This affinity phase retains the<br>
active substances according to the invention from the<br>
concentrated crude material solution. After multiple<br>
washings of the column with weakly acidic or neutral buffer<br>
solutions, the compounds according to the invention are<br>
released with the aid of alkaline buffer solutions.<br>
Bioregulatory applications<br>
The author has found that the active substances according to<br>
the invention effectively control the activity of the<br><br>
Na+,K+-ATPase enzyme which is also known as the sodium pump.<br>
This widely distributed enzyme regulates the extra- and<br>
intracellular concentration of the most important alkali<br>
metal ions by so-called active membrane transport. The<br>
energy necessary for this is delivered by the hydrolysis of<br>
ATP, which is directly coupled with the activity of this<br>
enzyme. The active substances according to the invention<br>
are capable to control the complex activity of this enzyme.<br>
The direction and intensity of this control is dependent on<br>
the concentration and on the molar mass of the active<br>
substances according to the invention. The nature and<br>
concentration of the alkali metal ions present and the other<br>
inorganic ions can substantially influence this controlling<br>
effect. With the addition of the active substances<br>
according to the invention to an erythrocyte suspension, an<br>
increase of the extracellular Na concentration, i.e. an<br>
activation of the sodium pump, was observed. In contrast,<br>
an inhibition of the Na+,K+-ATPase enzyme was established in<br>
vitro and with particular concentrations of the active<br>
substances of smaller molar mass according to the invention.<br>
A reduction of the toxic side-effects of ouabain or of other<br>
cardiac glycosides was also observed when the active<br>
substances according to the invention were applied together<br>
with these glycosides. With the addition of the active<br>
substances according to the invention in a molar ratio<br>
between 0.02 to 2 /l mol glycoside, preferably 1:1, the LD50<br>
value of hellebrin was considerably higher which signifies a<br>
decrease of the acute toxicity. Furthermore, as was<br>
experimentally established, the active substances according<br>
to the invention are capable to control the activity of<br>
several other essential enzymes, for example collegenases,<br>
hyaluronidases, phosphokinases and other enzymes. According<br>
to all indications, the active substances according to the<br>
invention are useable as endogenous ligands of the Na+,K+-<br>
ATPase enzyme.<br><br>
Immunoregulation<br>
The author has found several immunoregulatory actions for<br>
the substances according to the invention. These mechanisms<br>
can also partially be explained with the above described<br>
control of the Na+,K+-ATPase because this enzyme<br>
substantially participates in a large number of<br>
immunological processes.<br>
Furthermore, a new immunoregulatory effect of the active<br>
substances according to the invention is achieved in that<br>
these have a specific affinity for the Fc receptors. These<br>
receptors are anchored on various immunocytes and their<br>
occupation or non-occupation plays a fundamental role in the<br>
control of activity of these cells. In clinical tests, the<br>
active substances according to the invention led to a<br>
suppression of the activity of pathologically activated<br>
killer cells (K cells) and other lymphocytes in the antibody<br>
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In contrast, the<br>
activity of natural killer cells (NK cells) in the<br>
spontaneous cellular cytotoxicity (SCMC) was differently<br>
influenced by the active substances according to the<br>
invention: with rheumatic patients, the pathological over-<br>
stimulated spontaneous cytotoxicity is clearly suppressed.<br>
With health test persons, the spontaneous cytotoxicity was<br>
only insignificantly influenced. Therewith, the clinical<br>
data prove that, by a suppression of pathological<br>
autoaggresive processes, the active substances according to<br>
the invention are suitable for a causal rheumatic therapy or<br>
for prevention of tissue or organ graft rejection. It is<br>
important to note that all of these effects were obtained<br>
with uncommonly small amounts of active substance in the<br>
range of ug/kg. On the other hand, the toxicity of the<br>
compounds according to the invention is extremely low.<br>
Therewith, the most important pharmacotoxicological<br><br>
prerequisites are fulfilled for human therapeutical<br>
applications according to the invention. The rheumatic<br>
therapeutic use of the active substances according to the<br>
invention offers an additional clear advantage. The simple<br>
cyclohexamer co- (C3O=) 6 and its adducts exhibit an<br>
uncommonly strong analgesic and spasmolytic effect. The<br>
analgesic and spasmolytic effect appearing immediately after<br>
a local administration offers an important advantage for<br>
rheumatic therapy applications. The quickly appearing<br>
relief from pain and spasmolysis are maintained long-term by<br>
the re-establishment of normal immunoregulation. The active<br>
substances with larger molecular mass according to the<br>
invention are capable to exert a notable non-specific effect<br>
which mimics immunostimulation. This was unequivocally<br>
confirmed in animal experiments with bacterial infections.<br>
The animals treated with active substances had considerably<br>
longer survival rates with lethal Pseudomonas aeruginosa<br>
doses than the animals in the control group.<br>
The bioregulatory active substances according to the<br>
invention can be administered either separately as pure<br>
substances or as substance mixtures or in the form of<br>
pharmaceutical compositions, whereby the latter named can<br>
comprise one and/or several pharmaceutically safe adjuvants<br>
and/or carriers aside from the substances according to the<br>
invention. As these substances, 0.9% sodium chloride<br>
solution, 1 to 5% glucose or fructose solution,<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, potato starch, lactose, lanolin,<br>
mannite, magnesium stearate, glycerin, cetylstearyl alcohol,<br>
nipagin, sodium lauryl sulfate and talcum may be named.<br>
Optionally, still further therapeutically active substances<br>
or adjuvants can be added to the pharmaceutical compositions<br>
produced in this manner. These galenic formulations include<br>
all those formulations which are suitable for parenteral,<br>
intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, peri- or intra-<br>
articular injections, a peroral application such as by means<br><br>
of tablets, capsules or drops, or an external application<br>
such as by means of ointments, creams, gels or<br>
suppositories.<br>
The present invention is illustrated further in the<br>
following examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
Synthetic production from carbon suboxide<br><br>
In a glass reactor which is equipped with a reflux water<br>
cooler, 15 parts malonic acid are dissolved in 80 parts<br>
acetic anhydride by heating with an oil bath (80°C) and<br>
stirring. In an extension of the reflux cooler, two further<br>
dry ice cooling traps are connected in order to collect the<br>
arising volatile compounds. After the entire amount of acid<br>
is dissolved, 0.2 parts rubidium fluoride are added and a<br>
photochemical irradiation is carried out with a 250 W sun<br>
lamp. An increase of the oil bath temperature results up to<br>
130-150°C and the reaction mixture becomes increasingly<br>
darker brown. The carbon suboxide which is volatile under<br>
strong vacuum and its derivatives are condensed in the traps<br>
cooled with dry ice and acetone. The condensate is purified<br>
by fractional vacuum distillation. The active substances<br>
obtained in this manner are purified and analyzed by known<br>
chromatographic methods.<br>
Example 2<br>
Isolation from Industrial Methanol<br><br>
250 parts 0.1 molar ammonium acetate buffer solution of pH 9<br>
are added to 1000 parts methanol produced from synthesis gas<br>
and the methanol is first distilled off from this mixture by<br>
application of a distillation column. 1000 parts methanol<br>
are again added to the remaining water phase and the<br>
distillation of the methanol is repeated 3-4 times. The<br>
water phase remaining in the end is carefully concentrated<br>
and treated with charcoal. 50 parts of the charcoal<br>
separated by filtration and dried in air are treated with<br>
400 parts water containing 80% (v/v) ethanol at 80-90°C and<br>
warm filtered after 30 min maceration. The extraction is<br>
repeated 2 times. The combined ethanolic extracts are<br>
carefully concentrated and freeze-dried.<br>
Example 3<br>
Isolation from Helleborus species<br>
Parts of dried and coarsely minced root and rootstock of<br>
Helleborus purpurascens (family Ranunculaceae) are de-fatted<br>
with 120 parts hexane and subsequently pre-extracted with 80<br>
parts methylene chloride. After removal of the extraction<br>
agent, the dried residue is macerated with 200 parts water<br>
containing 30% (v/v) ethanol during 24 hours at room<br>
temperature. The extraction is repeated twice and<br>
subsequently the combined extracts are filtered and<br>
concentrated under vacuum. 250 parts of the extract<br>
obtained in this manner are added to 3 parts concentrated<br>
hydrochloric acid and heated for 20 minutes at 95°C. After<br>
the neutralization, the solution is treated with a little<br>
charcoal and filtered. The filtrate concentrated under<br>
vacuum is poured into the 8-fold volume acetone, the<br>
centrifuged precipitate is dissolved in a minimal amount of<br>
water and repeatedly precipitated 2-3 times with acetone.<br>
The precipitate is dissolved in minimal 0.1 molar sodium<br>
chloride solution and the solution is led over a gel column<br><br>
filled with TSK HW-60. The elution occurs at a flow rate of<br>
5 cm/h with 0.125 molar ammonia solution in water, which<br>
also contains 10% (v/v) 2-propanol. The detection occurs by<br>
measurement of the optical density at 230 nm.<br>
Example 4<br>
Isolation of the Active Substances from Seeds of Vitis<br>
vinifera<br>
25 parts dried and ground seeds of Vitis vinifera are added<br>
to 150 parts 0.5 molar borate buffer with pH = 9.6 and<br>
heated and macerated for 30 minutes at 90°C. The filtered<br>
solution is concentrated and poured into the 8-fold volume<br>
of cooled ethanol under stirring. The precipitate resulting<br>
thereby is centrifuged and dissolved in a minimal amount of<br>
water and precipitated twice each with the 6-fold amount of<br>
cooled ethanol. The precipitate dissolved in a minimal<br>
amount of ammonium acetate buffer solution is subjected to a<br>
separation by ultrafiltration, where membranes with<br>
molecular exclusion limits of 30, 10, 3 and 1 kD are used.<br>
The pH of the fractions separated in this manner is adjusted<br>
to a weakly acidic pH value and lyophilized.<br>
Example 5<br>
Active Substance Isolation from Phytolacca americana<br>
100 parts dried roots from Phytolacca americana are minced<br>
to a particle size of 0.5-1.2 mm and de-fatted with 600<br>
parts hexane by a treatment lasting 24 hours. At first, the<br>
hexane is pressed off and the plant material is air dried<br>
until the hexane odor is no longer perceptible. The dried<br>
plant material is macerated with 800 parts water containing<br>
5% (v/v) acetic acid for 4 hours at room temperature and the<br>
process is repeated twice. The combined extracts are<br><br>
filtered and concentrated under vacuum. 15 to 50 parts<br>
ammonium sulfate are added stepwise to 100 parts of the<br>
aqueous solution and dissolved. The proteins precipitated<br>
by salting-out are removed by centrifugation and filtration.<br>
50 parts 1-butanol are given to 50 parts supernatant and<br>
this is strongly shaken. After some time, the organic phase<br>
is separated and the extraction with butanol is repeated<br>
twice. The combined butanolic solutions are back extracted<br>
with water containing 0.1 % ammonia. The aqueous phase is<br>
concentrated under vacuum and purified by gel filtration.<br>
Example 6<br>
Production from Escherichia coli<br>
2000 volume parts autoclaved culture medium which contains<br>
20 parts tryptone, 10 parts yeast extract, 20 parts NaCl and<br>
30 parts agar and is supplemented with the suitable<br>
nutritional additives is inoculated with Escherichia coli<br>
strain K-12 in a dilution of 1:100. The culture is<br>
maintained at 37°C until a saturation density of 2 x 109<br>
cells/ml is attained. The reaction mixture is exposed to an<br>
ultrasound treatment and heated with 1.0 N acetic acid for<br>
20 min at 90°C, filtered after cooling and concentrated under<br>
vacuum. 150 parts of the concentrated solution are absorbed<br>
on reverse-phase silica (RP18)for column chromatography<br>
(Merck) and the solid phase is first washed with water<br>
containing 2% (v/v) acetic acid, thereafter with 1000 parts<br>
buffer mixture comprising n-propanol:ethyl acetate:20 mM<br>
borax/borate buffer in the ratio 600:100:300 % (v/v) and<br>
washed at the end with water. The solid phase is washed so<br>
long with these neutral elution agents until no amino acids,<br>
carbohydrates and other simple hydrolysis products are<br>
detectable in the eluate. The desorption of the active<br>
substances according to the invention occurs with<br>
acetonitrile, whose excess is removed by concentration under<br><br>
vacuum. The solution of the active substances according to<br>
the invention obtained in this manner is concentrated.<br>
Example 7<br>
Isolation from Animal Fluids<br>
10,000 parts porcine urine are freeze dried and the solid<br>
residue is extracted three times with 600 parts methanol.<br>
The methanolic extracts are concentrated to 20 parts. 100<br>
parts cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B is treated for<br>
90 minutes with a solution of suitably activated hellebrin<br>
until 80% of the glycoside used is covalently bound to the<br>
solid phase. 10 parts concentrated methanolic solution are<br>
applied to the affinity chromatography column prepared in<br>
this manner and eluted for such a time until no more<br>
chemical compounds are detectable in the eluate. The active<br>
substance according to the invention is eluted from the<br>
column by gradient elution with 0.5 to 0.2 molar formic acid<br>
and freeze-dried. The purification of the active substances<br>
occurs on a column filled with Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia).<br>
The active substances are first absorbed onto the column and<br>
eluted with a gradient of 20 to 60 (v/v) % acetone in water.<br>
Example 8<br>
Immunomodulatory Application<br>
The spontaneous cell mediated cytotoxicity (SCMC) of NK<br>
cells was measured by the assay of 51Cr isotope released<br>
from the K562 target cells in a 100/1 to 10/1<br>
effector/target ratio. In 8 of 10 healthy subjects, the<br>
active substance according to the invention elevated the<br>
lytic activity with an average of 15%. The pathological<br>
SCMC activity of 16 rheumatic patients, patologically<br>
increased to an average of 141%, was clearly normalized by<br><br>
the administration of the active substances according to the<br>
invention. The effector cells in the antibody dependent<br>
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) are influenced in a much more<br>
uniform manner by the active substances according to the<br>
invention. As evident from the following Diagram 1, the<br>
ADCC activity is diminished in healthy as well as in<br>
rheumatic patients.<br>
Diagram 1 Cytotoxicity of healthy and rheumatic patients<br>
with and without active substance treatment<br><br>

This normalization of the activity can be explained by the<br>
specific affinity of the active substances on the Fc<br>
receptor.<br>
Example 9<br>
Immunosuppressive Application for Organ Transplantation<br>
The immunosuppressive action of the substances according to<br>
the invention led to a clear reduction of the rejection<br><br>
reactions in organ transplantations. This was<br>
experimentally proven with the aid of a series of<br>
experimental heart transplantations in mice.<br>
The method for allograft heart transplantation of Corry, R.,<br>
Winn, H. and Ressel, P., Transplantation 16, 343 (1973) was<br>
applied to pathogen-free, 5-6 week old mice of the line<br>
Sprague Dawley DBA/2 as a doner and C57BL/6 as a recipient.<br>
After intravenous heparinization of the animals used as a<br>
doner, their hearts were removed and maintained in ice cold<br>
Ringer's lactate solution until preparation of the C57BL/6<br>
recipient animals. The anastomosis between aorta and lung<br>
arteries of the doner with the abdominal aorta and vena cava<br>
of the recipient was produced by microsurgical techniques.<br>
After the re-establishment of blood flow, the frequency and<br>
intensity of the heart beat was observed and rated from 0 to<br>
+4. The rejection was established after cessation of the<br>
pulse and visualized by laparotomy. The mice in the test<br>
group had obtained the following amounts of active<br>
substances by subcutaneous administration:<br>
-	2.0	mg/kg	three days before the transplantation<br>
-	3.0	mg/kg	on the day of the operation<br>
-	2.5	mg/kg	on the third post-operative day<br>
-	1.5	mg/kg	every third day thereafter<br>
The animals in the control group were only treated with<br>
citrate buffer as a placebo.<br>
In these thransplantation experiments, the following results<br>
were obtained:<br><br>
Animal Nr.	Treatment with: survival time (days)<br>
1	active	substance	24<br>
2	active	substance	31<br>
3	active	substance	18<br>
4	active	substance	21<br>
5	active	substance	42<br>
6	active	substance	18<br>
7	active	substance	6<br>
8	active	substance	33<br>
9	active	substance	12<br>
10	active substance	22<br>
11	placebo	8<br>
12	placebo	6<br>
13	placebo	10<br>
14	placebo	9<br>
The average survival rate of the animals treated with<br>
placebo was 8.2 days. With an average value of 22.7 days,<br>
the animals treated with active substance exhibited a clear,<br>
almost three-fold as long survival time as the placebo<br>
animals. This effect is explained by the specific<br>
suppression of the T lymphocytes causing the rejection<br>
reaction.<br>
Example 10<br>
Stimulation of Macrophages<br>
The spleen lymphocytes from 10 normal mice were suspended in<br>
RPMI1640 medium buffered with HEPES and supplemented with<br>
10% fetal calf serum. The suspension was maintained at 37°C<br>
for 1 hour in order to permit the adherence of the<br>
macrophages. In the test group, the mice were treated<br><br>
intraperitoneal with 5 mg/kg active substance and sacrificed<br>
24 hours thereafter. The animals of the control group did<br>
not receive any active substance. The lymphocytes from both<br>
groups were cultivated in tubes containing 5xl05 adhering<br>
macrophages.<br>
Stimulation index of the macrophages<br>
LPS PHA<br>
control group	288% 165%<br>
active substance group 402% 1,346%<br>
As evident, the stimulation indices (SI) attained by LPS<br>
(Lipopolysaccharide) and PHA (phytohemagglutinin) in the<br>
animals treated with active substance are significantly<br>
larger.<br>
Example 11<br>
Application for Apparent Immunostimulation<br>
A non-specific apparent immunostimulation was examined by<br>
the determination of the survival rates of animals which<br>
were infected with a lethal dose of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.<br>
In three test groups of 30-100 mice respectively, each<br>
animal received the lethal dose of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.<br>
I.	On the 7th, 14th and 28th day before the lethal<br>
Pseudomonas infection , 2 ug active substance was<br>
administered in the first group; on the 21st day, 0.25 ml<br>
physiological NaCl solution,<br>
II.	In the second group, the same active substance doses<br>
as in the group I, however, on the 21st day, 0.06 mg<br>
cyclophosphamide,<br>
III.	The control group was not given any active substances.<br><br>
% survival rates with lethal Pseudomonas Infection<br><br>
The active substances according to the invention caused a<br>
clear increase of the survival rates. Although the survival<br>
rates were lowered by the known immunosuppressive effect of<br>
cyclophosphamide, they clearly remain over the values of the<br>
control group. The interaction indicates a non-specific<br>
apparent immunostimulation of the active substances<br>
according to the invention, wherein a novel immune mechanism<br><br>
not described up to now would also be imaginable. It was<br>
recently proven that immediately after the administration of<br>
the lethal Pseudomonas dose, a explosion-like release of<br>
cytokines takes place. The cytokine shock condition<br>
triggered thereby is assumed as the immediate cause of<br>
sudden death. The immunosuppressive effect according to the<br>
invention can prevent this cytokine shock and leads to<br>
astonishingly greater survival rate without having exercised<br>
a true immunostimulation.<br>
Example 12<br>
Assay of the Active Substances with the Aid of Competitive<br>
ELISA Methods<br>
For the assay, the cross-reaction of the active substances<br>
according to the invention with anti-ouabain (a-OU)<br>
antiserum is used. The ouabain-avidin conjugate (OU-con)<br>
was synthesized from pro analysi ouabain (Sigma) and avidin<br>
(Fluka) was synthesized according to the methods of Harris<br>
et al., Hypertension 17, 930 (1991). The improvements of V.<br>
DiBartolo et al., Life Sciences, 57, 1417 (1995) were<br>
applied in the production of the corresponding anti-ouabain<br>
serum.<br>
The ELISA microtiter plates were first incubated each with<br>
0.1 ug/50ul OU-con conjugate solution overnight at 4°C. Non-<br>
bound conjugates were washed out with phosphate buffer (PBS,<br>
pH = 7.4) and the non-occupied binding sites were blocked<br>
with 1% gelatin solution.<br>
50ul from the sample solution with the unknown content of<br>
active substance was mixed together with constant amounts of<br>
anti-ouabain serum (0.5µg/50µl) in polypropylene tubes and<br>
held at room temperature for 2 hours.. Thereafter, 50ul<br>
from each active substance antiserum sample was applied to<br><br>
the plates and incubated for a further 3 hours. After<br>
washing out the non-bound antiserum with PBS, the plates<br>
were treated with a 1:500 solution of protein A alkaline<br>
phosphatase (Sigma) for 2 hours at room temperature. After<br>
removal of the non-bound enzyme, the plates were each<br>
treated with 50ul p-nitrophenyl phosphate solution (lmg/ml),<br>
and after 30 min incubation time, the absorption values (A)<br>
at 405 nm were automatically read.<br>
For the construction of a calibration curve, known amounts<br>
of active substance in the range 5ng/ml to 0.1 mg/ml were<br>
mixed with constant amounts of antiserum, treated according<br>
to the above named methods and the measured absorption<br>
values were depicted as a function of the corresponding<br>
concentrations.<br><br>
