Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a leak-proof and complete air removing valve assembly used with water pipeline during charging, scoring or emptying, under pressure of water and more specifically to dual orifice within orifice arrangement thereof.<br>
Background of invention:<br>
The air release valves are well known apparatus for valving of water supply lines and in the process industry's pipe lines alike. Primarily two categories of valves are used in liquid supply lines for air release and blockage namely low pressure and high pressure valves. The utmost desirable attributes of an efficient valve are upon charging the pipe line it should evacuate air present in the pipe line completely and block the entry thereof upon emptying at least leakages during working condition. Irrespective of pressure level of operation said category of valves generally employs floats in close sliding contact within the housing thereof, which upon charging moves up and closes the orifice thereof upon evacuation of reasonable amount of air and subsequently resuming normal liquid flow therein without leakage through the orifice.<br>
Fluid flow valves which include air release or air purge features are well known which are generally installed offline to the pipe line having liquid conduits inserted therein and are designed to insure the continuous release of air or other gases to avoid air locks which<br>
I<br><br>
otherwise interfere with the flow of liquid through the conduit. So called combination valves are also known which also function to purge air from the conduit on start-up and to provide vacuum relief upon system shut down. These valves incorporate a flexible valve seal assembly connected to a float which rises and falls within the valve body to open and close the valve in a predetermined manner to achieve the three functions stated above.<br>
Various design consideration of air vent and vacuum relief valves have been described in the prior art to protect against air blockage and vacuum collapse of a water supply line. Typically such prior art valves include a housing connected to the high point of the water supply line and within which is mounted a cylindrical or spherical float body. On charging of the pipe line, air is vented from the line through the valve until water enters the housing and raises the float body to close the valve. On draining of the line, water within the housing recedes, causing the float body to drop and open the valve for admitting air back into the line.<br>
The vastly and generally observed problems with the existing valves is incomplete air evacuation causing sectional disbalancement of the pipe line due to inner pressure variation within the pipe resulting in either bursting of said pipe line or heavy leakages therein. Adjunctively the conventional valve suffers inability in ensuring higher out flow and inflow of air during charging and emptying of water pipe line, releasing air poekeis underpressure.<br>
2<br><br>
Considering the drinking water pipe line hygiene standards and the valves being an intermediary apparatus the probability of coarse contaminants entangling in the valve body is more, wherein the self cleaning type filtered valves is the urgent need of the industry and society at large.<br>
In another operational category of such valves two different types of valves arc generally used are online valves and offline one. In the existing valve designs these variations hasn't been engineered into one single design for installation thereof, causing non flexible operation with less of options at the perusal of the person engaged in installation thereof. Hence there is deep felt requirement from the users thereof towards availability of single valves with both online and offline applicability options.<br>
The air release pattern segregate air relief valves into two basic types namely the single-orifice type and the double-orifice type. One form of the single-orifice type generally known as a "kinetic" air relief valve includes a large orifice for releasing or admitting large volumes of air during water filling or draining operations of the pipeline; a second form of the single-orifice type commonly known as an "automatic" air relief valve includes a small orifice for releasing air accumulated under pressure in the pipeline during normal operating conditions. Conventionally the double-orifice type is a combined unit including two single orifice valves, namely a kinetic large-orifice valve and an automatic small-orifice valve wherein the base of housing thereof is installed thereon to the pipeline.<br>
3<br><br>
The Market presence of double orifice valves is more due to more reliable operation thereof and is comprised of two bell-shaped floats, unfortunately lacking cohesive association thereof, thus affecting performance.<br>
A typical double orifice design generally followed in the existing valves is described in the prior art as cited herein by reference, wherein the bended section orifice evacuating the air through the orifice present in the separate chamber within housing thereof instead of straight through large orifice, making the valve apparatus more bulky. It is observed that there are advantages associated with straight through large orifice over bended section orifice as bended section orifices are leant to encounter more air locking situations and also are not leak proof.<br>
These valves costs reasonably high and are generally exposed in lonely places outside cities, and also not provided with security as it is practically not feasible to do so, are largely vulnerable to being tampered causing theft thereof or malfunction thereof<br>
As typical air release valve is described in Japanese Patent no JP 55142178 wherein air is vent from a discharge port, passing through a penetration hole, and also a float rises gradually. When the float contacts with the penetration hole, discharge of air stops, and also the rise of water level stops. When water pressure rises, it pushes a valve from underside, and separates the valve from a valve seat against the pushing force of a spring, and water flows out into a water-valve chamber and is discharged from a discharge port, The discharge port of the automatic air vent valve and the discharge port of the relief<br>
4<br><br>
valve are used in common, so when air is discharged, even if a little water-drop is discharged, none is called into question. Though the said valve works well with high pressure applications fails to operate at lower pressure.<br>
Another air relief valve invention is described in the Canadian patent no CA 1239071 wherein the said device is installed at an opening of a liquid flow pipe comprises an outer housing fixed to a large-diameter air outlet formed in a portion of the pipe arranged at an elevation, an inner housing rotatably fitted snugly in the outer housing, a float accommodated in the inner housing, and a lid member having a valve port and adapted to be put on the inner housing. The outer and inner housings have through holes bored therein respectively and allowed to coincide exactly with each other. Fluid communication or severance of the fluid communication between the pipe and the inner housing can be obtained by rotating the inner housing to vary the relation in position between the through holes in the outer and inner housings. In the said invention inbuilt inline type air release valve only can be used having theft prone assembly thereof wherein the nut can be opened with regular spanner, easily. Inner housing can be rotatably removed from the pipe line. Small orifice assemblies are conventional type. Also the frictional force, misalignments, and dirt can interrupt the function of the valve. Large orifice is very small size, % th diameter of inlet that means the area is 6.5% of area of inlet.<br>
As per US Patent 6276390 which addresses the clogging problem experienced with the discrete valve aperture design, by providing an improved valve seal assembly<br>
5<br><br>
arrangement which eliminates the smaller aperture in the valve seat. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of this invention, a combination air release valve is provided which substantially overcomes the above stated plugging problem. The valve includes a valve housing or riser adapted to be coupled to a fluid conduit. The housing includes an upstanding, substantially vertical portion and at least one 90.degree turn or elbow at the upper end of the housing. At the elbow, there is located a valve orifice plate arranged at an angle of about 45.degree, extending from the inside corner of the elbow upwardly to the outside corner of the elbow. The plate has a single rectangular shaped aperture or valve seat which is adapted to be opened and closed by a valve seal assembly connected at one end to a float and at an opposite end to the valve housing. The valve seal assembly includes a flexible diaphragm which is made rigid in an area which seals against the valve plate surrounding the aperture, and which has a flexible narrow, tongue-like portion extending away from the rigid portion and to the float. Part of the flexible portion which was previously employed to seal a second slot-like aperture in the valve plate is now provided with an elongated groove that overlaps the rigid portion of the seal assembly. Unfortunately these are smaller size air valves, with screwed end connections, used for smaller water pipe lines. Major parts are made of special plastics. It can be tampered by free hand and with regular standard spanners, ft also gets air locked at higher velocity of air flow.<br>
As per US patent 4742843 this invention provides a new and improved float body for an air and vacuum relief valve which is formed with an aerodynamically improved shape to reduce its coefficient of drag and which cooperates with the valve housing to operate in a<br>
6<br><br>
highly reliable manner to insure proper valve closure once all air has been vented from the supply line, yet prevents premature valve closure as a result of high air flow rates through the valve. Moreover, the float body of the present invention is relatively economical to manufacture and simple in design, yet is very effective in operation. These are smaller size air valves, with screwed end connections, used for smaller water pipe lines and only with low pressure orifice.<br>
It can be tampered by free hand and with regular standard spanners. It also get air locked at higher velocity of air flow.<br>
AS per France patent FR 2847648 these valve consists of a chamber linked to a high point on the water circuit and having an outlet and a spherical float. The chamber has upper and lower cones with a seal ring and spacers respectively for the float, so that water filling the chamber holds the float against the seal ring, while air in the chamber allows the float to drop, letting the air out. The spacers keep the float above the bottom of the chamber so that air can pass it. The said valve operates only with conventional type small high pressure orifice wherein are prone to theft as seal ring thereof can be tampered easily through public access.<br>
As per US Patent 5511577 the present invention provides an air release valve comprising valve chamber having an inlet and an outlet, a control float in the chamber which is movable, in use, in response to changes in liquid level in the chamber, and a stack of movable valve members in the chamber above the control float, the movable valve members having vent passages there through which increase in size with increasing<br>
7<br><br>
height in the stack but which are smaller than the outlet, and the top movable valve member in the stack being adapted to be lifted up, by differential air pressures acting on it, to seat on the outlet and thereby reduce the effective size of the outlet when a pipeline served by the air release valve is filling with liquid and the liquid displaces air through the valve. The said valve assembly though works properly restricting its operation to offline mode only.<br>
As per US Patent 2853092 it provides an air and vaccum release valve in which an upper and lower float member are disposed within the vaccum chamber, being constrained to move along a path in alignment with a vent opening by means of a perforated tubular guide member. The upper float member is provided with an axial relief passage which may be closed by contact with the lower float member. Liquid admitted to the valve chamber causes both float members to raise, ejecting air through the vent until the upper member seals the vent opening and the lower member seals the axial passage in the upper member. If the air pressure in the chamber increases, the liquid level drops causing the lower member to drop, but the upper member still remains in sealing engagement with the vent opening. However the axial passage of the upper element is exposed, permitting relief of the excess pressure. If the liquid level in elements to drop, the level in the valve chamber drops, permitting both float elements to drop. This causes the upper float member to dropout of sealing engagement with the vent opening and prevents the existence of vaccum in the valve chamber. Unfortunately the said valve assembly can be tampered and are suitable for low pressure applications.<br>

Description of Invention<br>
With reference to objects specified in the preceding section, the description herein explains the preferred embodiment of invention in substantial details. The primer of the present invention lies in its designing methodology comprising of assembling similar components and to have a system for supper sealed inbuilt kinetic air release valves which can be installed inline as well as offline.<br>
The kinetic air release valve consists of super sealed assembly. The hood covers and protects all orfices, nuts and bolts so that orifices, nuts and bolts are not visible from outside and look like an integral non detachable part of the main pipe line. This ensures non tampering of air valve.<br>
The valve can be installed inline as well as offline and comprising of double float, double orifice, inbuilt small orifice, rolling seal, filter screens, anti theft bolts, tamper proof assembly, straight through large orifice ensuring high outer flow and inflow of air therein. The same got feature of offline installation along with a special case or body.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a valve assembly has a large float with guide rods. The large ball is guided by six nos. of guide rods. This ensures proper alignment of the large float and large orifice without reducing or obstructing the flow of air or flow of water. The large float is always away from the flow passage while charging and emptying the water pipe line. The flow passage is straight through without any<br>
11<br><br>
obstruction or diversion of flow of air by float. The large orifice diameter is 75% of diameter of inlet Tee. That means large orifice area is 56% of area of inlet of Tee. This ensures higher out flow and inflow of air during charging and emptying of water pipeline than other air valves available.<br>
In inline installation it is a compact and it does not project outwards except the hood. In<br>
offline installation it requires an additional enlarged case.<br>
It consists of concentric, in-built rolling sealed small orifice for high pressure release.<br>
The small orifice and small float assembly is in-built, inside the large float along with<br>
rolling seal. The small ball is guided by low density bearing sleeve to reduce the<br>
frictional force on the small float and to prevent rotation of small float along the vertical<br>
axis. This ensures uninterrupted release of air under water pressure.<br>
It has got self cleaning type two filter screens of 3/4th diameter of a circle are fitted at 45°,<br>
in opposite direction, with an interference angle of 90° in the inlet passage of small<br>
orifice assembly, inside the large float so that the dirt particles will not flow into small<br>
orifice sealing area. This prevents frequent cleaning or maintenance of air valve.<br>
It consists of an anti-theft bolt. The nut is fitted to the belt with stopper pin and locking<br>
grub screw at the end of the bolt. Special tools are required to open these nuts and bolts.<br>
This prevents the tampering of air valve by regular tools like standard spanners.<br>
While charging the water pipe line, air flow through large orifice. As soon as the pipe line<br>
is filled with water, the large float is pushed up by water against large orifice and closes<br>
the outlet. The small quantity of air bubbles accumulate at peak points of valve chamber.<br>
As soon as the volume of air pocket increases and the small float hangs in air and falls<br>
12<br><br>
down due to gravitational force on the float, overcoming the air pressure against small orifice. The rolling seal helps to break the air pressure against small orifice into small parts. Then flow out the accumulated air through small orifice and small float is pushed up against the small orifice by water and close the outlet. While emptying the water pipe line, as the pressure inside the pipe line reduces to atmospheric pressure and water flow away from the large orifice, the large float falls down away from the large orifice along with water and air flow into the pipe line from out side.<br>
