				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides compositions and methods for modulating the<br>
expression of survivin. In particular, this invention relates to antisense compounds, particularly<br>
double-stranded oligonucleotides, specifically hybridizable with nucleic acids encoding human<br>
survivin. Such oligonucleotides have been shown to modulate the expression of survivin.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A hallmark feature of cancerous cells is uncontrolled proliferation. Among the<br>
differences that have been discovered between tumor and normal cells is resistance to the<br>
process of programmed cell death, also known as apoptosis (Ambrosini et al., Nat. Med., 1997,<br>
3, 917-921). Apoptosis is a process multicellular organisms have evolved to prevent<br>
uncontrolled cell proliferation as well as to eliminate cells that have become sick, deleterious, or<br>
are no longer necessary. The process of apoptosis involves a multistep cascade in which cells<br>
are degraded from within through the concerted action of proteolytic enzymes and DNA<br>
endonucleases, resulting in the formation of apoptotic bodies that are then removed by scavenger<br>
cells. Research to date has shown that much of the intracellular degradation is carried out<br>
through the action of the caspases, a family of proteolytic enzymes that cleave adjacent to<br>
aspartate residues (Cohen, Biochemistry Journal, 1997, 326, 1-16).<br>
The finding that most tumor cells display resistance to the apoptotic process has led to<br>
the view that therapeutic strategies aimed at attenuating the resistance of tumor cells to apoptosis<br>
could represent a novel means to halt the spread of neoplastic cells (Ambrosini et al., Nat. Med.,<br>
1997,	3, 917-921). One of the mechanisms through which tumor cells are believed to acquire<br>
resistance to apoptosis is by overexpression of survivin, a recently described member of the IAP<br>
(inhibitor of apoptosis) caspase inhibitor family. To date, overexpression of survivin has been<br>
detected in tumors of the lung, colon, pancreas, prostate, breast, stomach, non-Hodgkin's<br>
lymphoma, and neuroblastoma (Adida et al., Lancet, 1998, 351, 882-883; Ambrosini et al., Nat.<br>
Med, 1997, 3, 917-921; Lu et al., Cancer Res., 1998, 55, 1808-1812). A more detailed analysis<br>
has been performed in neuroblastoma where it was found that survivin overexpression<br>
segregated with tumor histologies known to associate with poor prognosis (Adida et al., Lancet,<br>
1998,	351, 882-883). Finally, Ambrosini et al. describe transfection of HeLa cells with an<br>
expression vector containing a 708 nt fragment of the human cDNA encoding effector cell<br><br>
protease receptor 1 (EPR-1), the coding sequence of which is complementary to the coding<br>
strand of survivin (Ambrosini et al., J. Bio. Chem., 1998, 273, 11177-11182). This construct<br>
caused a reduction in cell viability.<br>
Survivin has recently been found to play a role in cell cycle regulation. It has been<br>
found to be expressed in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle in a cycle-regulated manner, and<br>
associates with microtubules of the mitotic spindle. Disruption of this interaction results in loss<br>
of survivin's anti-apoptotic function and increased caspase-3 activity during mitosis. Caspase-3 is<br>
associated with apoptotic cell death. It is therefore believed that survivin may counteract a<br>
default induction of apoptosis in G2/M phase. It is believed that the overexpression of survivin in<br>
cancer may overcome this apoptotic checkpoint, allowing undesired survival and division of<br>
cancerous cells. The survivin antisense construct described by Ambrosini above was found to<br>
downregulate endogenous survivin in HeLa cells and to increase caspase-3-dependent apoptosis<br>
in cells in G2/M phase. Li et al., Nature, 1998,396, 580-584.<br>
In many species, introduction of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induces potent and<br>
specific gene silencing. This phenomenon occurs in both plants and animals and has roles in<br>
viral defense and transposon silencing mechanisms. (Jorgensen et al., Plant Mol. Biol., 1996, 31,<br>
957-973; Napoli et al.; Plant Cell, 1990,2,279-289).<br>
The first evidence that dsRNA could lead to gene silencing in animals came from work<br>
in the nematode, Caenorhabditis eJegans, where it has been shown that feeding, soaking or<br>
injecting dsRNA (a mixture of both sense and antisense strands) results in much more efficient<br>
silencing than injection of either the sense or the antisense strands alone (Guo and Kemphues,<br>
Cell, 1995, 81, 611-620; Fire et al., Nature 391:806-811 (1998); Montgomery et al., Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Set USA 95:15502-15507 (1998); PCT International Publication<br>
W099/32619; (Fire et al., Nature, 1998, 391, 806-810; Tiramons et al., Gene, 2001, 263, 103-<br>
112; Timmons and Fire, Nature, 1998, 395, 854). Since, the phenonmenon has been<br>
demonstrated in a number of organisms, including Drosophila melanogaster (Kennerdell et<br>
al., Cell 95:1017-1026 (1998)); and embryonic mice (Wianny et al,, Nat. Cell Biol. 2:70-75<br>
(2000)).<br>
This posttranscriptional gene silencing phenomenon has been termed "RNA<br>
interference" (RNAi) and has come to generally refer to the process of gene silencing involving<br>
dsRNA which leads to the sequence-specific reduction of gene expression via target mRNA<br>
degradation (Tuschl et al., Genes Dev., 1999, 13, 3191-3197).<br><br>
It has been demonstrated that 21- and 22-nt dsRNA fragments having 3' overhangs are<br>
the canonical sequence-specific mediators of KNAi. These fragments, which are termed short<br>
interfering RNAs (siRNAs), are generated by an RNase Ill-like processing reaction from longer<br>
dsRNA. Chemically synthesized siRNA also mediate efficient target RNA cleavage with the site<br>
of cleavage located near the center of the region spanned by the guiding strand of the siRNA.<br>
(Elbashir et al., Nature, 2001, 411, 494-498). Characterization of fee suppression of expression<br>
of endogenous and heterologous genes caused by the 21-23 nucleotide siRNAs has been<br>
investigated in several mammalian cell lines, including human embryonic kidney (293) and<br>
HeLa cells (Elbashir et al., Genes and Development, 2001,15,188-200).<br>
Recently, it has been shown that single-stranded RNA oligomers (ssRNAi or asRNA) of<br>
antisense polarity can be potent inducers of gene silencing and that single-stranded oligomers are<br>
ultimately responsible for fee RNAi phenomenon (Tijsterman et al., Science, 2002, 295, 694-<br>
697).<br>
U.S. patents 5,898,031 and 6,107,094, each of which is herein incorporated by<br>
reference, describe certain oligonucleotides having RNA-like properties. When hybridized wife<br>
RNA, these oligonucleotides serve as substrates for a dsRNase enzyme wife resultant cleavage<br>
of fee RNA by fee enzyme (Crooke, 2000; Crooke, 1999).<br>
As a result of these advances in fee understanding of apoptosis and fee role feat survivin<br>
expression is believed to play in conferring a growth advantage to a wide variety of tumor cell<br>
types, there is a great desire to provide compositions of matter which can modulate fee<br>
expression of survivin. It is greatly desired to provide methods of diagnosis and detection of<br>
nucleic acids encoding survivin in animals. It is also desired to provide methods of diagnosis<br>
and treatment of conditions arising from survivin expression. In addition, improved research kits<br>
and reagents for detection and study of nucleic acids encoding survivin are desired. Thus, fee<br>
present invention provides a class of novel inhibitors of survivin, compositions comprising these<br>
compounds, and methods of using fee compounds.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention employs double and single-stranded oligomeric antisense<br>
compounds, particularly single or double-stranded oligonucleotides which are RNA or RNA-like<br>
and single-stranded oligonucleotides which are DNA or DNA-like for use in modulating the<br>
function of nucleic acid molecules encoding survivin, ultimately modulating the amount of<br>
survivin produced. This is accomplished by providing antisense compounds which specifically<br>
hybridize with one or more nucleic acids encoding survivin. As used herein, the terms "target<br>
nucleic acid" and "nucleic acid encoding survivin" encompass DNA encoding survivin, RNA<br>
(including pre-mRNA and mRNA or portions thereof) transcribed from such DNA, and also<br>
cDNA derived from such RNA. The specific hybridization of an oligomeric compound with its<br><br>
complementary sense-orientation target nucleic acid interferes with the normal function of the<br>
nucleic acid. This modulation of function of a target nucleic acid by compounds which<br>
specifically hybridize to it is generally referred to as "antisense," and such compounds can be<br>
described as being in the "antisense orientation" relative to the target.<br>
The functions of DNA to be interfered with include replication and transcription. The<br>
functions of RNA to be interfered with include, for example, translocation of the RNA to the site<br>
of protein translation, translation of protein from the RNA, splicing of the RNA to yield one or<br>
more mRNA species, and catalytic activity which may be engaged in or facilitated by the RNA.<br>
The overall effect of such interference with target nucleic acid function is modulation of the<br>
expression of survivin at the RNA and/or the protein level. In the context of the present<br>
invention, "modulation" means either an increase (stimulation) or a decrease (inhibition) in the<br>
expression. In the context of the present invention, inhibition is a desired form of modulation of<br>
gene expression and RNA, and in some embodiments mRNA, is a suitable target.<br>
It is suitable to target specific nucleic acids for antisense. "Targeting" an antisense<br>
compound to a particular nucleic acid, in the context of this invention, is a multistep process.<br>
The process usually begins with the identification of a nucleic acid sequence whose function is to<br>
be modulated. This may be, for example, a cellular gene (or mRNA transcribed from the gene)<br>
whose expression is associated with a particular disorder or disease' state, or a nucleic acid<br>
molecule from an infectious agent. In the present invention, the target is a nucleic acid molecule<br>
encoding survivin. The targeting process also includes determination of a site or sites within this<br>
gene for the antisense interaction to occur such that the desired effect, e.g., detection or<br>
modulation of expression of the mRNA and or protein, will result. Within the context of the<br>
present invention, one intragenic site is the region encompassing the translation initiation or<br>
termination codon of the open reading frame (ORF) of the gene. Since, as is known in the art,<br>
the translation initiation codon is typically 5'-AUG (in transcribed mRNA molecules; 5'-ATG in<br>
the corresponding DNA molecule), the translation initiation codon is also referred to as the<br>
"AUG codon," the "start codon" or the "AUG start codon". A minority of genes have a<br>
translation initiation codon having the RNA sequence 5'-GUG, 5'-UUG and 5'-CUG, while the<br>
translation initiation codons 5'-AUA, 5'-ACG and 5'-CUG have been shown to function in vivo.<br>
Thus, the terms "translation initiation codon" and "start codon" can encompass many codon<br>
sequences, even though the initiator amino acid in each instance is typically methionine (in<br>
eukaryotes) or formylmethionine (in prokaryotes). It is also known in the art that eukaryotic and<br>
prokaryotic genes may have two or more alternative start codons, any one of which may be<br><br>
preferentially utilized for translation initiation in a particular cell type or tissue, or under a<br>
particular set of conditions. In the context of the invention, "start codon" and "translation<br>
initiation codon" refer to the codon or codons that are used in vivo to initiate translation of an<br>
mRNA molecule transcribed from a gene encoding survivin, regardless of the sequences) of<br>
such codons.<br>
It is also known in the art that a translation termination codon (or "step codon") of a<br>
gene may have one of three sequences, i.e., 5'-UAA, 5'-UAG or 5'-UGA (the corresponding<br>
DNA sequences are 5'-TAA, 5'-TAG and S'-TGA, respectively). The terms "start codon region"<br>
and "translation initiation codon region" refer to a portion of such an mRNA or gene that<br>
encompasses from about 25 to about SO contiguous nucleotides in either direction (i.e., 5' or 3')<br>
from a translation initiation codon. Similarly, the terms "stop codon region" and "translation<br>
termination codon region" refer to a portion of such an mRNA or gene that encompasses from<br>
about 25 to about 50 contiguous nucleotides in either direction (i.e., 5' or 3') from a translation<br>
termination codon.<br>
The open reading frame (ORF) or "coding region," which is known in the art to refer to<br>
the region between the translation initiation codon and the translation termination codon, is also<br>
a region which may be targeted effectively. Other target regions include the 5' untranslated<br>
region (5'UTR), known in the art to refer to the portion of an mRNA in the 5' direction from the<br>
translation initiation codon, and thus including nucleotides between the 5' cap site and the<br>
translation initiation codon of an mRNA or corresponding nucleotides on the gene, and the 3'<br>
untranslated region (3'UTR), known in the art to refer to the portion of an mRNA in the 3'<br>
direction from the translation termination codon, and thus including nucleotides between the<br>
translation termination codon and 3' end of an mRNA or corresponding nucleotides on the gene.<br>
The 5' cap of an mRNA comprises an N7-methylated guanosine residue joined to the 5'-most<br>
residue of the mRNA via a 5'-5' triphosphate linkage. The 5' cap region of an mRNA is<br>
considered to include the 5' cap structure itself as well as the first 50 nucleotides adjacent to the<br>
cap. The 5' cap region may also be an effective target region.<br>
Although some eukaryotic mRNA transcripts are directly translated, niany contain one<br>
or more regions, known as "introns," which are excised from a transcript before it is translated.<br>
The remaining (and therefore translated) regions are known as "exons" and are spliced together<br>
to form a continuous mRNA sequence. mRNA splice sites, i.e., intron-exon junctions, may also<br>
be target regions, and are particularly useful in situations where aberrant splicing is implicated<br><br>
in disease, or where an overproduction of a particular mRNA splice product'is implicated in<br>
disease.<br>
Once one or more target sites have been identified, antisense oligomeric compounds,<br>
typically an antisense oligonucleotide, are chosen which are sufficiently complementary to the<br>
target, i.e., hybridize sufficiently well and with sufficient specificity, to give the desired effect.<br>
In the context of this invention, "hybridization" means hydrogen bonding, which may be<br>
Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, .between complementary<br>
nucleoside or nucleotide bases. For example, adenine and thymine are complementary<br>
nucleobases which pair through the formation of hydrogen bonds. "Complementary," as used<br>
herein, refers to the capacity for precise pairing between two nucleotides. For example, if a<br>
nucleotide at a certain position of an oligonucleotide is capable of hydrogen bonding with a<br>
nucleotide at the same position of a DNA or RNA molecule, then the oligonucleotide and the<br>
DNA or RNA are considered to be complementary to each other at that position. The<br>
oligonucleotide and the DNA or RNA are complementary to each other when a sufficient<br>
number of corresponding positions in each molecule are occupied by nucleotides which can<br>
hydrogen bond with each other. Thus, "specifically hybridizable" and "complementary" are<br>
terms which are used to indicate a sufficient degree of complementarity or precise pairing such<br>
that stable and specific binding occurs between the oligonucleotide and-the DNA or RNA target.<br>
It is understood in the art that the sequence of an antisense compound need not be 100%<br>
complementary to that of its target nucleic acid to be specifically hybridizable. An antisense<br>
compound is specifically hybridizable when binding of the compound to the target DNA or RNA<br>
molecule interferes with the normal function of the target DNA or RNA to cause a complete or<br>
partial loss of function, and there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific<br>
binding of the antisense compound to non-target sequences under conditions in which specific<br>
binding is desired, i.e., under physiological conditions in the case of therapeutic treatment, or<br>
under conditions in which in vitro or in vivo assays are performed. Moreover, an oligonucleotide<br>
may hybridize over one or more segments such that intervening or adjacent segments are not<br>
involved in the hybridization event (e.g., a loop structure, mismatch or hairpin structure). The<br>
compounds of the present invention comprise at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least<br>
85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 99%, or 100% sequence complementarity to a target<br>
region within the target nucleic acid sequence to which they are targeted. For example, an<br>
antisense compound in which 18 of 20 nucleobases of the antisense compound are<br>
complementary to a target region, and would therefore specifically hybridize, would represent 90<br><br>
percent complementarity. In this example, the remaining noncomplementary nucleobases may be<br>
clustered or interspersed with complementary nucleobases and need not be contiguous to each<br>
other or to complementary nucleobases. As such, an antisense compound which is 18<br>
nucleobases in length having 4 (four) noncomplementary nucleobases which are flanked by two<br>
regions of complete complementarity with the target nucleic acid would have 77.8% overall<br>
complementarity with the target nucleic acid and would thus fall within the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Percent complementarity of an antisense compound with a region of a target nucleic acid<br>
can be determined routinely using BLAST programs (basic local alignment search tools) and<br>
PowerBLAST programs known in the art (Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol., 1990, 215, 403-410;<br>
Zhang and Madden, Genome Res., 1997, 7, 649-656). Percent homology, sequence identity or<br>
complementarity, can be determined by, for example, the Crap program (Wisconsin Sequence<br>
Analysis Package, Version'8 for Unix, Genetics Computer Group, University Research Park,<br>
Madison WI), using default settings, which uses the algorithm of Smith and Waterman (Adv.<br>
Appl. Math., 1981, 2, 482-489). In some embodiments, homology, sequence identity or<br>
complementarity, between the antisense compound and target is between about 50% to about<br>
60%. In some embodiments, homology, sequence identity or complementarity, is between about<br>
60% to about 70%. In some embodiments, homology, sequence identity or complementarity, is<br>
between about 70% and about 80%. In some embodiments, homology, sequence identity or<br>
complementarity, is between about 80% and about 90%. In some embodiments, homology,<br>
sequence identity or complementarity, is about 90%, about 92%, about 94%, about 95%, about<br>
96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99% or about 100%.<br>
Antisense compounds are commonly used as research reagents and diagnostics. For<br>
example, antisense oligonucleotides, which are able to inhibit gene expression with exquisite<br>
specificity, are often used by those of ordinary skill to elucidate the function of particular genes.<br>
Antisense compounds are also used, for example, to distinguish between functions of various<br>
members of a biological pathway. Antisense modulation has, therefore, been harnessed for<br>
research use.<br>
Multiple mechanisms exist by which short synthetic oligonucleotides can be used to<br>
modulate gene expression in mammalian cells. A commonly exploited antisense mechanism is<br>
RNase H-dependent degradation of the targeted RNA. RNase H is a ubiquitously expressed<br>
endonuclease that recognizes antisense DNA-RNA heteroduplex, hydrolyzing the RNA strand.<br>
A further antisense mechanism involves the utilization of enzymes that catalyze the cleavage of<br><br>
RNA-RNA duplexes. These reactions are catalyzed by a class of RNAse enzymes including but<br>
not limited to RNAse III and RNAse L. The antisense mechanism known RNA interference<br>
(RNAi) is operative on RNA-RNA hybrids and the like.<br>
Both RNasc H-based antisense (usually using single-stranded compounds) and RNA interference<br>
(usually using double-stranded compounds known as siRNAs) are antisense mechanisms,<br>
typically resulting in loss of target RNA function.<br>
Optimized siRNA and RNase H-dependent oligomeric compounds behave similarly in<br>
terms of potency, maximal effects, specificity and duration of action, and efficiency. Moreover it<br>
has been shown that in general, activity of dsRNA constructs correlated with the activity of<br>
RNase H-dependent single-stranded antisense compounds targeted to the same site. One major<br>
exception is that RNase H-dependent antisense compounds were generally active against target<br>
sites in pre-mRNA whereas siRNAs were not.<br>
These data suggest that, in general, sites on the target RNA that were not active with<br>
RNase H-dependent oligonucleotides were similarly not good sites for siRNA. Conversely, a<br>
significant degree of correlation between active RNase H oligonucleotides and siRNA was<br>
found, suggesting that if a site is available for hybridization to an RNase H oligonucleotide, men<br>
it is also available for hybridization and cleavage by the siRNA complex. Consequetly, once<br>
suitable target sites have been determined by either antisense approach, these sites can be used to<br>
design constructs that operate by the alternative antisense mechanism (Vickers et al., 2003, J.<br>
Biol. Chem. 278,7108). Moreover, once a site has been demonstrated as active for either an<br>
RNAi or an RNAse H oligonucleotide, a single-stranded RNAi oligonucleotide (ssRNAi or<br>
asRNA) can be designed.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, double-stranded antisense<br>
oligonucleotides are suitable. These double-stranded antisense oligonucleotides may be RNA or<br>
RNA-like, and may be modified or unmodified, in that the oligonucleotide, if modified, retains<br>
the properties of forming an RNA:RNA hybrid and recruitment and (activation) of a dsRNase. In<br>
other embodiments, thesingle-stranded oligonucleotides(ssRNAi or asRNA) may be RNA-like.<br>
In other embodiments of the present invention, single-stranded antisense oligonucleotides<br>
are suitable. In some embodiments, the single-stranded oligonucleotides may be "DNA-like", in<br>
that the oligonucleotide has well characterized structural features, for example a plurality of<br>
unmodified 2' Hs or a stabilized backbone such as e.g., phosphorothioate, that is structurally<br>
suited for interaction with a target oligonucleotide and recruitment and (activation) of RNase H.<br><br>
While oligonucleotides are one form of antisense compound, the present invention<br>
comprehends other oligomeric antisense compounds, including but not limited to oligonucleotide<br>
mimetics such as are described below. The compounds in accordance with this invention can<br>
comprise from about 8 to about 80 nucleobases. In another embodiment, the oligonucleotide is<br>
about 10 to SO nucleotides in length. In yet another embodiment, the oligonucleotide is 12 to 30<br>
nucleotides in length. In yet another embodiment, the oligonucleotide is 12 to 24 nucleotides in<br>
length. In yet another embodiment, the oligonucleotide is 19 to 23 nucleotides in length. Some<br>
embodiments comprise at least an 8-nucleobase portion of a sequence of an oligomeric<br>
compound which inhibits expression of survivin. dsRNA or siRNA molecules directed to<br>
survivin, and their use in inhibiting survivin mRNA expression, are also embodiments within<br>
the scope of the present invention.<br>
The oligonucleotides of the present invention also include variants in which a different<br>
base is present at one or more of the nucleotide positions in the oligonucleotide: For example, if<br>
the first nucleotide is an adenosine, variants may be produced which contain thymidine (or<br>
uridine if RNA), guanosine or cytidine at this position. This may be done at any of the positions<br>
of the oligonucleotide. Thus, a 20-mer may comprise 60 variations (20 positions x 3 alternates at<br>
each position) in which the original nucleotide is substituted with any of the three alternate<br>
nucleotides. These oligonucleotides are then tested using the methods described herein to<br>
determine their ability to inhibit expression of survivin mRNA.<br>
Oligomeric Compounds<br>
In the context of the present invention, the term "oligomeric compound" refers to a<br>
polymeric structure capable of hybridizing to a region of a nucleic acid molecule. This term<br>
includes oligonucleotides, oligonucleosides, oligonucleotide analogs, oligonucleotide mimetics<br>
and chimeric combinations of these. Oligomeric compounds are routinely prepared linearly but<br>
can be joined or otherwise prepared to be circular and may also include branching. Oligomeric<br>
compounds can include double-stranded constructs such as, for example, two strands hybridized<br>
to form double-stranded compounds or a single strand with sufficient self complementarity to<br>
allow for hybridization and formation of a fully or partially double-stranded compound. In one<br>
embodiment of the invention, double-stranded antisense compounds encompass short interfering<br>
RNAs (siRNAs). As used herein, the term "siRNA" is defined as a double-stranded compound<br>
having a first and second strand and comprises a central complementary portion between said<br>
first and second strands and terminal portions that are optionally complementary between said<br>
first and second strands or with the target mRNA. Each strand may be from about 8 to about 80<br><br>
nucleobases in length, 10 to 50 nucleobases in length, 12 to 30 nucleobases in length, 12 to 24<br>
nucleobases in length or 19 to 23 nucleobases in length. The central complementary portion may<br>
be from about 8 to about 80 nucleobases in length, 10 to SO nucleobases in length, 12 to 30<br>
nucleobases in length, 12 to 24 nucleobases in length or 19 to 23 nucleobases in length. The<br>
terminal portions can be from 1 to 6 nucleobases in length. The siRNAs may also have no<br>
terminal portions. The two strands of an siRNA can be linked internally leaving free 3' or 5'<br>
termini or can be linked to form a continuous hairpin structure or loop. The hairpin structure may<br>
contain an overhang on either the 5' or 3' terminus producing an extension of single-stranded<br>
character.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, double-stranded antisense compounds are canonical<br>
siRNAs. As used herein, the term "canonical siRNA" is defined as a double-stranded oligomeric<br>
compound having a first strand and a second strand each strand being 21 nucleobases in length<br>
with the strands being complementary over 19 nucleobases and having on each 3' termini of<br>
each strand a deoxy thymidine dimer (dTdT) which in the double-stranded compound acts as a 3'<br>
overhang.<br>
In another embodiment, the double-stranded antisense compounds are blunt-ended<br>
siRNAs. As used herein the term "blunt-ended siRNA" is defined as an siRNA having no<br>
terminal overhangs. That is, at least one end of the double-stranded compound is blunt. siRNAs<br>
whether canonical or blunt act to elicit dsRNAse enzymes and trigger the recruitment or<br>
activation of the RNAi antisense mechanism. In a further embodiment, single-stranded RNAi<br>
(ssRNAi) compounds mat act via the RNAi antisense mechanism are contemplated.<br>
Further modifications can be made to the double-stranded compounds and may include<br>
conjugate groups attached to one of the termini, selected nucleobase positions, sugar positions or<br>
to one of the internucleoside linkages. Alternatively, the two strands can be linked via a non-<br>
nucleic acid moiety or linker group. When formed from only one strand, dsRNA can take the<br>
form of a self-complementary hairpin-type molecule that doubles back on itself to form a duplex.<br>
Thus, the dsRNAs can be fully or partially double-stranded. When formed from two strands, or<br>
a single strand that takes the form of a self-complementary hairpin-type molecule doubled back<br>
on itself to form a duplex, the two strands (or duplex-forming regions of a single strand) are<br>
complementary RNA strands that base pair in Watson-Crick fashion.<br>
In general an oligomeric compound comprises a backbone of momeric subunits joined<br>
linking groups where each linked momeric subunit is directly or indirectly attached to a<br>
heterocyclic base moiety. Oligomeric compounds may also include monomeric subunits that are<br><br>
not linked to a heterocyclic base moiety thereby providing abasic sites. Any one of the repeated<br>
units making up an oligomeric compound can be modified giving rise to a variety of motifs<br>
including hemimers, gapmers and chimeras.<br>
As is known in the art, a nucleoside comprises a sugar moiety attached to a heterocyclic<br>
base moiety. The two most common classes of such heterocyclic bases are purines and<br>
pyrimidines. Nucleotides are nucleosides that further include a phosphate group covalently<br>
linked to the sugar portion of the nucleoside. For those nucleosides that include a pentofuranosyl<br>
sugar, the phosphate group can be linked to either the 2', 3' or 5' hydroxyl moiety of the sugar<br>
giving the more common 3', 5-internucleoside linkage or the not so common 2', 5'-<br>
internucleoside linkage. In forming oligonucleotides, the phosphate groups covalently link the<br>
sugar moieties of adjacent nucleosides. The respective ends can be joined to form a circular<br>
structure by hybridization or by formation of a covalent bond. In addition, linear compounds<br>
may have internal nucleobase complementarity and may therefore fold in a manner as to produce<br>
a fully or partially double-stranded compound. Within oligonucleotides, the phosphate groups<br>
are commonly referred to as forming the internucleoside linkage or in conjunction with the sugar<br>
ring form the backbone of the oligonucleotide. The normal internucleoside linkage that<br>
comprises the backbone of RNA and DNA is a 3' to 5' phosphodiester linkage. However, open<br>
linear structures are generally desired.<br>
In the context of this invention, the term "oligonucleotide" refers to an oligomer or<br>
polymer of ribonucleic acid (RNA) or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or mimetics thereof. This<br>
term includes oligonucleotides composed of naturally-occurring nucleobases, sugars and<br>
covalent internucleoside linkages, as well as oligonucleotide analogs or chemically modified<br>
oligonucleotides that have one or more non-naturally occurring portions which function in a<br>
similar manner. Such modified or substituted oligonucleotides are suitable over the naturally<br>
occurring forms because of desirable properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake,<br>
enhanced affinity for a nucleic acid target and enhanced nuclease stability.<br>
In the context of this invention, the term "oligonucleoside" refers to a sequence of<br>
nucleosides that are joined by internucleoside linkages that do not have phosphorus atoms.<br>
Internucleoside linkages of this type include short chain alkyl, cycloalkyl, mixed heteroatom<br>
alkyl, mixed heteroatom cycloalkyl, one or more short chain heteroatomic linkers and one or<br>
more short chain heterocyclic linkers. These internucleoside linkages include but are not limited<br>
to siloxane, sulfide, sulfoxide, sulfone, acetyl, formacetyl, thioformacetyl, methylene formacetyl,<br><br>
thioformacetyl, alken, sulfamate; methyleneimino, methylcnehydrazino, sulfonate, sulfonamide,<br>
amide and others having mixed N, O, S and CH2 component parts.<br>
Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of the above<br>
oligonucleosides include, but are not limited to, U.S.: 5,034,506; 5,166,315; 5,185,444;<br>
5,214,134; 5,216,141; 5,235,033; 5,264,562; 5,264,564; 5,405,938; 5,434,257; 5,466,677;<br>

5,608,046; 5,610,289; 5,618,704; 5,623,070; 5,663,312; 5,633,360; 5,677,437; 5,792,608;<br>
5,646,269 and 5,677,439, each of which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Further included in the present invention are antisense oligomeric compounds including<br>
antisense oligonucleotides, external guide sequence (EGS) oligonucleotides, alternate splicers,<br>
and other oligomeric compounds which hybridize to at least a portion of the target nucleic acid.<br>
As such, these antisense oligomeric compounds may be introduced in the form of single-<br>
stranded, double-stranded, circular or hairpin oligomeric compounds and may contain structural<br>
elements such as internal or terminal bulges, mismatches or loops. In general, nucleic acids<br>
(including oligonucleotides) may be described as "DNA-like" (i.e., having 2'-deoxy sugars and,<br>
generally, T rather than U bases) or "RNA-like" (i.e., having 2'-hydroxyl or 2'-modified sugars<br>
and, generally U rather than T bases). Once introduced to a system, the oligomeric compounds of<br>
the invention may elicit the action of one or more enzymes or structural proteins to effect<br>
modification of the target nucleic acid.<br>
The oligomeric compounds in accordance with this invention can comprise from about<br>
8 to about 80 nucleobases (i.e. from about 8 to about 80 linked nucleobases and/or monomeric<br>
subunits). One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the invention embodies oligomeric<br>
compounds of 8, 9,10,11,12, 13, 14,15,16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,24,25,26, 27,28, 29,<br>
30,	31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45,46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55,<br>
56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, or 80<br>
nucleobases in length.<br>
In one embodiment, the oligomeric compounds of the invention are 10 to 50<br>
nucleobases in length. One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that this embodies<br>
oligomeric compounds of 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,20,21, 22, 23, 24, 25,26, 27, 28, 29, 30,<br>
31,	32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or 50 nucleobases in<br>
length.<br>
In another embodiment, the oligomeric compounds of the invention are 12 to 30<br>
nucleobases in length. One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that this embodies<br><br><br>
oligomeric compounds of 12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21, 22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29, or<br>
30 nuclcobases in length.<br>
In a further embodiment, the oligomeric compounds of the invention are 12 to 24<br>
nucleobases in length. One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that this embodies<br>
oligomeric compounds of 12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23 or 24 nucleobases in<br>
length.<br>
In another embodiment, the oligomeric compounds of the invention are 19 to 23<br>
nucleobases in length. One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that this embodies<br>
oligomeric compounds of 19,20,21,22 or 23 nucleobases in length.<br>
One particularly length for oligomeric compounds is from about 12 to about 30<br>
nucleobases. Another particularly length is from about 12 to about 24 nucleobases. A further<br>
particularly suitable length is from about 19 to about 23 nucleobases.<br>
Chimeric oligomeric compounds<br>
It is not necessary for all positions in a oligomeric compound to be uniformly modified,<br>
and in fact more than one of the aforementioned modifications may be incorporated in a single<br>
oligomeric compound or even at a single monomelic subunit such as a nucleoside within a<br>
oligomeric compound. The present invention also includes oligomeric compounds which are<br>
chimeric oligomeric compounds. "Chimeric" oligomeric compounds or "chimeras," in the<br>
context of this invention, are oligomeric compounds containing two or more chemically distinct<br>
regions, each made up of at least one monomer unit, i.e., a nucleotide in the case of a nucleic<br>
acid based oligomer.<br>
Chimeric oligomeric compounds typically contain at least one region modified so as to<br>
confer increased resistance to nuclease degradation, increased cellular uptake, alteration of<br>
charge, and/or increased binding affinity for the target nucleic acid. An additional region of the<br>
oligomeric compound may serve as a substrate for enzymes capable of cleaving RNA:DNA or<br>
RNA:RNA hybrids. By way of example, RNase H is a cellular endonuclease which cleaves the<br>
RNA strand of an RNA:DNA duplex. Activation of RNase H, therefore, results in cleavage of<br>
the RNA target, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of inhibition of gene expression.<br>
Consequently, comparable results can often be obtained with shorter oligomeric compounds<br>
when chimeras are used, compared to for example phosphorothioate deoxyoligonucleotides<br>
hybridizing to the same target region. Cleavage of the RNA target can be routinely detected by<br>
gel electrophoresis and, if necessary, associated nucleic acid hybridization techniques known in<br><br>
the art. Similar observations are made for chimeras that form RNA:RNA hybrids and are<br>
substrates for dsRNases.<br>
Chimeric oligomeric compounds of the invention may be formed as composite<br>
structures of two or more oligonucleotides, oligonucleotide analogs, oligonucleosides and/or<br>
oligonucleotide mimetics as described above. Routinely used chimeric compounds include but<br>
are not limited to hybrids, hemimers, gapmers, inverted gapmers and blockmers wherein the<br>
various point modifications and or regions are selected from native or modified DNA and RNA<br>
type units and or mimetic type subunits such as for example locked nucleic acids (LNA) (which<br>
encompasses ENA™ as described below), peptide nucleic acids (PNA), morpholinos, and others.<br>
These are described below. Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of<br>
such hybrid structures include, but are not limited to, U.S.: 5,013,830; 5,149,797; 5,220,007;<br>
5,256,775; 5,366,878; 5,403,711; 5,491,133; 5,565,350; 5,623,065; 5,652,355; 5,652,356; and<br>
5,700,922, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
Oligomer Mimetics<br>
Another group of oligomeric compounds amenable to the present invention includes<br>
oligonucleotide mimetics. The term mimetic as it is applied to oligonucleotides is intended to<br>
include oligomeric compounds wherein the furanose ring or the furanose ring and the<br>
internucleotide linkage are replaced with novel groups, replacement of only the furanose ring is<br>
also referred to in the art as being a sugar surrogate. The heterocyclic base moiety or a modified<br>
heterocyclic base moiety is maintained for hybridization with an appropriate target nucleic acid.<br>
One such oligomeric compound, an oligonucleotide mimetic that has been shown to<br>
have excellent hybridization properties, is referred to as a peptide nucleic acid (PNA). PNAs<br>
have favorable hybridization properties, high biological stability and are electrostatically neutral<br>
molecules. In one recent study PNAs were used to correct aberrant splicing in a transgenic<br>
mouse model (Sazani et al, Nat. Biotechnoi, 2002,20,1228-1233). In PNA oligomeric<br>
compounds, the sugar-backbone of an oligonucleotide is replaced with an amide containing<br>
backbone, in particular an aminoethylglycine backbone. The nucleobases are bound directly or<br>
indirectly (-C(=O)-CH2- as shown below) to aza nitrogen atoms of the amide portion of the<br>
backbone. Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of PNA oligomeric<br>
compounds include, but arc not limited to, U.S.: 5,539,082; 5,714,331; and 5,719,262, each of<br>
which is herein incorporated by reference. PNAs can be obtained commercially from Applied<br>
Biosystems (Foster City, CA, USA).<br><br>
Numerous modifications have been made to the basic PNA backbone since it was<br>
introduced in 1991 by Nielsen and coworkers (Nielsen et al., Science, 1991,254,1497-1500).<br>
The basic structure is shown below:<br><br>
wherein<br>
Bx is a heterocyclic base moiety;<br>
T4 is hydrogen, an amino protecting group, -C(O)R5, substituted or unsubstituted C1-C10<br>

alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl, a chemical functional group, a reporter group, a conjugate group, a D<br>
or L α-amino acid linked via the α-carboxyl group or optionally through the ω-carboxyl group<br>
when the amino acid is aspartic acid or glutamic acid or a peptide derived from D, L or mixed D<br>
and L amino acids linked through a carboxyl group, wherein the substituent groups are selected<br>
from hydroxyl, amino, alkoxy, carboxy, benzyl, phenyl, nitro, thiol, thioalkoxy, halogen, alkyl,<br>

R5 is a carbonyl protecting group; and<br>
n is from 7 to about 79.<br><br>
Another class of oligonucleotide mimetic that has been studied is based on linked<br>
morpholino units (morpholino nucleic acid) having heterocyclic bases attached to the<br>
morpholino ring. A number of linking groups have been reported that link the morpholino<br>
monomeric units in a morpholino nucleic acid. One class of linking groups have been selected to<br>
give a non-ionic oligomeric compound. The non-ionic morpholino-based oligomeric compounds<br>
are less likely to have undesired interactions with cellular proteins. Morpholino-based<br>
oligomeric compounds are non-ionic mimics of oligonucleotides which are less likely to form<br>
undesired interactions with cellular proteins (Dwaine A. Braasch and David R. Corey,<br>
Biochemistry, 2002,41(14), 4503-4510). Morpholino-based oligomeric compounds have been<br>
studied in zebrafish embryos (see: Genesis, volume 30, issue 3,2001 and Heasman, J., Dev.<br>
Biol., 2002,243,209-214). Further studies of morpholino-based oligomeric compounds have<br>
also been reported (see: Nasevicius et al, Nat. Genet, 2060,26,216-220; and Lacerra et al.,<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 2000,97,9591-9596). Morpholino-based oligomeric compounds are<br>
disclosed in United States Patent 5,034,506, issued July 23,1991. The morpholino class of<br>
oligomeric compounds have been prepared having a variety of different linking groups joining<br>
the monomeric subunits.<br>
Morpholino nucleic acids have been prepared having a variety of different linking<br>
groups (L2) joining the monomeric subunits. The basic formula is shown below:<br><br>
T1 is hydrogen, hydroxyl, a protected hydroxyl, a linked nucleoside or α- linked<br>
oligomeric compound;<br>
T5 is hydrogen or a phosphate, phosphate derivative, a linked nucleoside or a linked<br>
oligomeric compound; and<br>
L2 is a linking group which can be varied from chiral to achiral from charged to neutral<br>
(US Patent 5,166,315 discloses linkages including -O-P(=O)(N(CH3)2)-O-; US Patent 5,034,506<br>
discloses achiral intermorpholino linkages such as for example: -S(=O)-X- where X is NH,<br>
NCH3,O, S, or CH2; -C(=Y)-O- where Y is O or S; -S(=O)(OH)-CH2-; -S(=OXOH)-N(R)-CH2-<br><br><br>
where R is H or CH3; and US Patent 5,185,444 discloses phosphorus containing chiral<br>
intermorpholino linkages such as for example: -P(=OX-X)-O- where X is F, CH2R, S-CH2R or<br>
NR1R2 and each R, R1 and R2 is H, CH3 or some other moiety that doesnt interfer with the base<br>
specific hydrogen bonding; and<br>
n is from 7 to about 79.<br>
A further class of oligonucleotide mimetic is referred to as cyclohexenyl nucleic acids<br>
(CeNA). The furanose ring normally present in an DNA/RNA molecule is replaced with a<br>
cyclohenyl ring. CeNA DMT protected phosphoramidite monomers have been prepared and<br>
used for oligomeric compound synthesis following classical phosphoramidite chemistry. Fully<br>
modified CeNA oligomeric compounds and oligonucleotides having specific positions modified<br>
with CeNA have been prepared and studied (see Wang et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 2000,122,<br>
8595-8602). In general the incorporation of CeNA monomers into a DNA chain increases its<br>
stability of a DNA/RNA hybrid. CeNA oligoadenylates formed complexes with RNA and DNA<br>
complements with similar stability to the native complexes. The study of incorporating CeNA<br>
structures into natural nucleic acid structures was shown by NMR and circular dichroism to<br>
proceed with easy conformational adaptation. Furthermore the incorporation of CeNA into a<br>
sequence targeting RNA was stable to serum and able to activate E. Coli RNase resulting in<br>
cleavage of the target RNA strand.<br>
The general formula of CeNA is shown below:<br><br>
each Bx is a heterocyclic base moiety;<br>
L3 is an inter cyclohexenyl linkage such as for example a phosphodiester or a<br>
phosphorothioate linkage;<br>
T1 is hydrogen, hydroxyl, a protected hydroxyl, a linked nucleoside or a linked<br>
oligomeric compound; and<br>
T2 is hydrogen or a phosphate, phosphate derivative, a linked nucleoside or a linked<br>
oligomeric compound.<br><br>
Another class of oligonucleotide mimetic (anhydrohexitol nucleic acid) can be prepared<br>
from one or more anhydrohexitol nucleosides (see, Wouters and Herdewijn, Bioorg. Med.<br>
Chem. Lett., 1999,9,1563-1566) and would have the general formula:<br><br>
each Bx is a heterocyclic base moiety;<br>
L is an inter anhydrohexitol linkage such as for example a phosphodiester or a<br>
phosphorothioate linkage;<br>
T1 is hydrogen, hydroxyl, a protected hydroxyl, a linked nucleoside or a linked<br>
oligomeric compound; and<br>
T2 is hydrogen or a phosphate, phosphate derivative, a linked nucleoside or a linked<br>
oligomeric compound.<br>
A further modification includes bicyclic sugar moieties such as "Locked Nucleic Acids"<br>
(LNAs) in which the 2'-hydroxyl group of the ribosyl sugar ring is linked to the 4' carbon atom<br>
of the sugar ring thereby forming a 2'-C,4'-C-oxymethylene linkage to form the bicyclic sugar<br>
moiety (reviewed in Elayadi et al, Curr. Opinion Inverts. Drugs, 2001,2,558-561; Braasch et<br>
al, Chem. Biol, 2001, 8 1-7; and Orum et al, Curr. Opinion Mol Ther., 2001, 3, 239-243; see<br>
also U.S. Patents: 6,268,490 and 6,670,461). The linkage can be a (-CH2-)x group bridging the<br>
2' oxygen atom and the 4' carbon atom, wherein if x = 1 the term LNA is used, if x = 2 the term<br>
ENA™ is used (Singh et al., Chem. Commun., 1998,4,455-456; ENA™: Morita et al,<br>
Bioorganic Medicinal Chemistry, 2003,11,2211-2226). Thus, "ENA™ " is one non limiting<br>
example of an LNA. LNA and other bicyclic sugar analogs display very high duplex thermal<br>
stabilities with complementary DNA and RNA (Tm = +3 to +10 C), stability towards 3'-<br>
exonucleolytic degradation and good solubility properties. LNAs are commercially available<br>
from ProLigo (Paris, France and Boulder. CO, USA). The basic structure of an LNA having a<br>
single CH2 linkage in the bicyclic ring system is shown below. This is merely illustrative of one<br>
type of LNA.<br><br><br><br>
wherein each T1 and T2 is, independently, hydrogen, a hydroxyl protecting group, a<br>
linked nucleoside or a linked oligomeric compound, and each Z\ is an internucleoside linking<br>
group such as for example phosphodiester or phosphorothioate.<br>
An isomer of LNA that has also been studied is alpha-L-LNA which has been shown to<br>
have superior stability against a 3'-cxonuclease (Frieden et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 2003,21,<br>
6365-6372). The alpha-L-LNA's were incorporated into antisense gapmers and chimeras that<br>
showed potent antisense activity. The structure of alpha-L-LNA is shown below:<br><br>
Another similar bicyclic sugar moiety that has been prepared and studied has the bridge<br>
going from the 3'-hydroxyl group via a single methylene group to the 4' carbon atom of the sugar<br>
ring thereby forming a 3'-C,4'-C-oxymethylene linkage (see U.S. Patent.6,043,060).<br>
The conformations of LNAs determined by 2D NMR spectroscopy have shown that the<br>
locked orientation of the LNA nucleotides, both in single-stranded LNA and in duplexes,<br>
constrains the phosphate backbone in such a way as to introduce a higher population of the N-<br>
type conformation (Petersen et al., J. Mol. Recognit., 2000, 13, 44-53). These conformations are<br>
associated with improved stacking of the nucleobases (Wengel et al., Nucleosides Nucleotides,<br>
1999, 18, 1365-1370).<br>
LNA has been shown to form exceedingly stable LNA:LNA duplexes (Koshkin et al., J.<br>
Am. Chem. Soc, 1998, 120,13252-13253). LNA:LNA hybridization was shown to be the most<br>
thermally stable nucleic acid type duplex system, and the RNA-mimicking character of LNA<br>
was established at the duplex level. Introduction of three (3) LNA monomers (T.or A)<br><br>
significantly increased melting points (Tm = +15/+11) toward DNA complements. The<br>
universality of LNA-mediated hybridization has been stressed by the formation of exceedingly<br>
stable LNA:LNA duplexes. The RNA-mimicking of LNA was reflected with regard to the N-<br>
type conformational restriction of the monomers and to the secondary structure of the LNA:RNA<br>
duplex.<br>
LNAs also form duplexes with complementary DNA, RNA or LNA with high thermal<br>
affinities. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra show that duplexes involving fully modified LNA<br>
(esp. LNA:RNA) structurally resemble an A-form RNA:RNA duplex. Nuclear magnetic<br>
resonance (NMR) examination of an LNA:DNA duplex confirmed the 3'-endo conformation of<br>
an LNA monomer. Recognition of double-stranded DNA has also been demonstrated suggesting<br>
strand invasion by LNA. Studies of mismatched sequences show that LNAs obey the Watson-<br>
Crick base pairing rules with generally improved selectivity compared to the corresponding<br>
unmodified reference strands. DN/LNA chimeras have been shown to efficiently inhibit gene<br>
expression when targeted to a variety of regions (5'-untranslated region, region of the start codon<br>
or coding region) within the luciferase mRNA (Braasch et al, Nucleic Acids Research, 2002, 30,<br>
5160-5167).<br>
Novel types of LNA-oligomeric compounds, as well as the LNAs, are useful in a wide<br>
range of diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Among these are antisense applications, PCR<br>
applications, strand-displacement oligomers, substrates for nucleic acid polymerases and<br>
generally as nucleotide-based drugs.<br>
Potent and nontoxic antisense oligonucleotides containing LNAs have been described<br>
(Wahlestedt et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 2000,97, 5633-5638.) The authors have<br>
demonstrated that LNAs confer several desired properties to antisense compounds. LNA/DNA<br>
copolymers were not degraded readily in blood serum and cell extracts. LNA/DNA copolymers<br>
exhibited potent antisense activity in assay systems as disparate as G-protein-coupled receptor<br>
signaling in living rat brain and detection of reporter genes in Escherichia coli. Lipofectin-<br>
mediated efficient delivery of LNA into living human breast cancer cells has also been<br>
accomplished. Further successful in vivo studies involving LNA's have shown knock-down of<br>
the rat delta opioid receptor without toxicity (Wahlestedt et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 2000, 97,<br>
5633-5638) and in another study showed a blockage of the translation of the large subunit of<br>
RNA polymerase II (Fluiter et al, Nucleic Acids Res., 2003, 31, 953-962).<br>
The synthesis and preparation of the LNA monomers adenine, cytosine, guanine. 5-<br>
methyl-cytosine, thymine and uracil, along with their oligornerization, and nucleic acid<br><br>
recognition properties have been described (Koshkin et al., Tetrahedron, 1998,54,3607-3630).<br>
LNAs and preparation thereof are also described in WO 98/39352 and WO 99/14226.<br>
The first analogs of LNA, phosphorothioate-LNA and 2'-thio-LNAs, have also been<br>
prepared (Kumar et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 1998, 8,2219-2222). Preparation of locked<br>
nucleoside analogs containing oligodeoxyribonucleotide duplexes as substrates for nucleic acid<br>
polymerases has also been described (Wengel et al., PCT International Application<br>
WO03/020739; and WO99/14226). Furthermore, synthesis of 2'-amino-LNA, a novel<br>
conformationally restricted high-affinity oligonucleotide analog with a handle has been<br>
described in the art (Singh et al., J. Org. Chem., 1998,63,10035-10039). In addition, 2'-amino-<br>
and 2'-methylamino-LNA's have been prepared and the thermal stability of their duplexes with<br>
complementary RNA and DNA strands has been previously reported.<br>
Another oligonucleotide mimetic amenable to the present invention that has been<br>
prepared and studied is threose nucleic acid. This oligonucleotide mimetic is based on threose<br>
nucleosides instead of ribose nucleosides and has the general structure shown below:<br><br>
Initial interest in (3',2')-alpha-L-threose nucleic acid (TNA) was directed to the question<br>
of whether a DNA polymerase existed that would copy the TNA. It was found that certain DNA<br>
polymerases are able to copy limited stretches of a TNA template (reported in C&amp;EN/January<br>
13,2003).<br>
In another study it was determined that TNA is capable of antiparallel Watson-Crick<br>
base pairing with complementary DNA, RNA and TNA oligonucleotides (Chaput et al, J. Aw.<br>
Chem. Soc, 2003, 125, 856-857).<br>
In one study (3',2')-alpha-L-threose nucleic acid was prepared and compared to the 2'<br>
and 3' amidate analogs (Wu et al, Organic Letters, 2002, 4(8), 1279-1282). The amidate<br>
analogs were shown to bind to RNA and DNA with comparable strength to that of RNA/DNA.<br><br>
Further oligonucleotide mimetics have been prepared to incude bicyclic and tricyclic<br>
nucleoside analogs having the formulas (amidite monomers shown):<br><br>
(see Steffens et al, Helv. Chim. Acta, 1997,80,2426-2439; Steffens et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc.<br>
1999,121,3249-3255; Renneberg et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2002,124, 5993-6002; and<br>
Renneberg et al, Nucleic acids res., 2002, 30,2751-2757). These modified nucleoside analogs<br>
have been oligomerized using the phosphoramidite approach and the resulting oligomeric<br>
compounds containing tricyclic nucleoside analogs have shown increased thermal stabilities<br>
(Tm's) when hybridized to DNA, RNA and itself. Oligomeric compounds containing bicyclic<br>
nucleoside analogs have shown thermal stabilities approaching that of DNA duplexes.<br>
Another class of oligonucleotide mimetic is referred to as phosphonomonoester nucleic<br>
acids which incorporate a phosphorus group in the backbone. This class of olignucleotide<br>
mimetic is reported to have useful physical and biological and pharmacological properties in the<br>
areas of inhibiting gene expression (antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, sense<br>
oligonucleotides and triplex-forming oligonucleotides), as probes for the detection of nucleic<br>
acids and as auxiliaries for use in molecular biology.<br>
The general formula (for definitions of Markush variables see: United States Patents<br>
5,874,553 and 6,127,346 herein incorporated by reference in their entirety) is shown below.<br><br>
Further oligonucleotide mimetics amenable to the present invention have been prepared<br>
wherein a cyclobutyl ring replaces the naturally occurring furanosyl ring.<br>
Modified Internucleoside Linkages<br>
Specific examples of antisense oligomeric compounds useful in this invention include<br>
oligonucleotides containing modified e.g. non-naturally occurring internucleoside linkages. As<br><br>
defined in this specification, oligonucleotides having modified internucleoside linkages include<br>
internucleoside linkages that retain a phosphorus atom and internucleoside linkages that do not<br>
have a phosphorus atom. For the purposes of this specification, and as sometimes referenced in<br>
the art, modified oligonucleotides that do not have a phosphorus atom in their internucleoside<br>
backbone can also be considered to be oligonucleosides.<br>
Modified oligonucleotide backbones containing a phosphorus atom therein include, for<br>
example, phosphorothioates, chiral phoephorothioates, phosphorodithioates, phosphotriesters,<br>
aminoalkylphosphotriesters, methyl and other alkyl phosphonates including 3'-alkylene<br>
phosphonates, 5'-alkylene phosphonates and chiral phosphonates, phosphinates,<br>
phosphoramidates including 3'-amino phosphoramidate and aminoalkylphosphoramidates,<br>
thionophosphoramidates, thionoalkylphosphonates, thionoalkylphosphotriesters,<br>
phosphonoacetate and thiophosphonoacetate (see Sheehan et al, Nucleic Acids Research, 2003,<br>
31(14), 4109-4118 and Dellinger et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 2003,125, 940-950), selenophos-<br>
phates and boranophosphates having normal 3'-5' linkages, 2'-5' linked analogs of these, and<br>
those having inverted polarity wherein one or more internucleotide linkages is a 3' to 3', 5' to 5'<br>
or 2' to 2' linkage. One phosphorus containing modified internucleoside linkage is the<br>
phosphorothioate internucleoside linkage, which is linked in a 3'-5' linkage. Oligonucleotides<br>
having inverted polarity comprise a single 31 to 3* linkage at the 3'-most internucleotide linkage<br>
i.e. a single inverted nucleoside residue which may be abasic (the nucleobase is missing or has a<br>
hydroxyl group in place thereof). Various salts, mixed salts and free acid forms are also<br>
included.<br>
N3'-P5'-phosphoramidates have been reported to exhibit both a high affinity towards a<br>
complementary RNA strand and nuclease resistance (Gryaznov et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1994,<br>
116, 3143-3144). N3'-P5'-phosphoramidates have been studied with some success in vivo to<br>
specifically down regulate the expression of the c-myc gene (Skorski et al, Proc. Natl. Acad.<br>
Set, 1997,94, 3966-3971; and Faira et al, Nat. Biotechnol, 2001,19,40-44).<br>

In some embodiments of the invention, oligomeric compounds "have one or more<br>
phosphorothioate and/or heteroatom intemucleoside linkages, in particular -CH2-NH-O-CH2-, -<br>
CH2-N(CH3)-O-CH2- (known as a methylene (methylimino) or MMI backbone), -CH2-O-<br>
N(CH3)-CH2-, -CH2-N(CH3)-N(CH3)-CHa- and -O-N(CH3)-CH2-CH2- (wherein the native<br>

heteroatom and alkyl or cycloalkyl intemucleoside linkages, or one or more short chain<br>
heteroatomic or heterocyclic intemucleoside linkages. These include those having morpholino<br>
linkages (formed in part from the sugar portion of a nucleoside); siloxane backbones; sulfide,<br>
sulfoxide and sulfone backbones; fonnacetyl and rbioformacetyl backbones; methylene<br>

Modified sugars<br>
Oligomeric compounds of the invention may also contain one or more substituted or<br>
other wise modified sugar moieties. Ribosyl and related sugar moieties are routinely modified at<br>
any reactive position not involved in linking. Thus a suitable position for a sugar substituent<br>
group is the 2'-position not usually used in the native 3' to 5'-internucledside linkage. Other<br>
suitable positions are the 3' and the 5'-termini. 3'-sugar positions are open to modification when<br>
the linkage between two adjacent sugar units is a 2', 5'-linkage. Sugar substituent groups<br>
include: OH; F; O-, S-, or N-alkyl; O-,<br>
S-, or N-alkenyl; O-, S- or N-alkynyl; or O-alkyl-O-alkyl, wherein the alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl<br>
may be substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C10 alkyl or C2 to C10 alkenyl and alkynyl. Particularly<br><br>
suitable are O((CH2)nO)mCH3, O(CH2)nOCH3, O(CH2)nNH2, O(CH2)CH3, C(CH2)nONH2, and<br>
O(CH2)nON((CH2)nCH3)2, where n and m are from 1 to about 10. Other suitable<br>
oligonucleotides comprise a sugar substituent group selected from: C1 to C10 lower alkyl,<br>
substituted lower alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkaryl, aralkyl, O-alkaryl or O-aralkyl, SH, SCH3,<br>
OCN, CI, Br, CN, CF3, OCF3, SOCH3, SO2CH3, ONCO2, NO2, N3, NH2, heterocycloalkyl,<br>
heterocycloalkaryl, aminoalkylamino, polyalkylamino, substituted silyl, an RNA cleaving group,<br>
a reporter group, an intercalator, a group for improving the pharmacokinetic properties of an<br>
oligonucleotide, or a group for improving the pharmacodynamic properties of an<br>
oligonucleotide, and other substituents having similar properties.<br>
One modification includes 2'-methoxyethoxy (2'-O-CH2CH2OCH3, also known as 2'-O-<br>
(2-methoxyethyl) or 2'-MOE) (Martin et al., Helv. Chim. Acta, 1995, 78,486-504) i.e., an<br>
alkoxyalkoxy group. Further modifications includes 2'-dimethylaminooxyethoxy, i.e., a<br>
O(CH2)2ON(CH3)2 group, also known as 2'-DMAOE, as described in examples hereinbelow, 2'-<br>
dimethylaminoethoxyethoxy (also known in the art as 2'-O-dimethyl-amino-ethoxy-ethyl or 2'-<br>
DMAEOE), i.e., 2'-O-(CH2)2O-(CH2)2N(CH3)2, and N-methylacetamide (also referred to as<br>
NMA, 2'-O-CH2-C(=O)-N(H)CH3.)<br>
Other sugar substituent groups include methoxy (-O-CH3), aminopropoxy (-<br>
OCH2CH2CH2NH2), allyl (-CH2-CH=CH2), -O-allyl (-O-CH2-CH=CH2) and fluoro (F). 2'-Sugar<br>
substituent groups may be in the arabino (up) position or ribo (down) position. One 2'-arabino<br>
modification is 2'-F (see: Loc et al, Biochemistry, 2002, 41, 3457-3467). Similar modifications<br>
may also be made at other positions on the oligomeric compoiund, particularly the 3' position of<br>
the sugar on the 3' terminal nucleoside or in 2'-5' linked oligonucleotides and the 5' position of 5'<br>
terminal nucleotide. Oligomeric compounds may also have sugar mimetics such as cyclobutyl<br>
moieties in place of the pentofuranosyl sugar. Representative United States patents that teach the<br>
preparation of such modified sugar structures include, but are not limited to, U.S.: 4,981,957;<br>

distinct entities located within the same molecule.<br>
Modified Nucleobases/Naturalfy occurring nedeobases<br>
Oligomeric cpmpounds may also include nucleobase (often referred to in the art simply<br>
as "base" or "heterocyclic base moiety") modifications or substitutions.. As used herein,<br>
"unmodified" or "natural" nucleobases include die purine bases adenine (A) and guanine (G),<br>
and the pyrimidine bases thymine (T), cytosine (C) and uracil (U). Modified nucleobases also<br>

Patent No. 3,687,808, those disclosed in The Concise Encyclopedia Of Polymer Science And<br>
Engineering, pages 858-859, Kroschwitz, J.I., ed. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1990, those disclosed by<br>
Englisch et al., Angewandte Chemie, International Edition, 1991, 30, 613, and those disclosed by<br>
Sanghvi, Y.S., Chapter 15, Antisense Research and Applications, pages 289-302, Crooke, S.T.<br>
and Lebleu, B., ed., CRC Press, 1993. Certain of these nucleobases are particularly useful for<br>
increasing the binding affinity of the oligomeric compounds of the. invention. These include 5-<br><br><br>
subatituted pyrimidines, β-azapyrimidincs end N-2, N-6 and 0-6 substituted purines, including<br>
2-aminopropyladenine, 5-propynyluracil and 5-propynyicytosine. 5-methylcytosine substitutions<br>
have been shown to increase nucleic acid duplex stability by 0.6-1.2°C (Sanghvi, Y.S., Crooke,<br>
S.T. and Lebleu, B., eds., Antisense Research and Applications, CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1993,<br>
pp. 276-278) and are presently suitable base substitutions, even more particularly when<br>
combined with 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar modifications.<br>
Oligomeric compounds of the present invention can also include polycyclic heterocyclic<br>
compounds in place of one or more heterocyclic base moieties. A number of tricyclic<br>
heterocyclic comounds have been previously reported. These compounds are routinely used in<br>
antisense applications to increase the binding properties of the modified strand to a target strand.<br>
The most studied modifications are targeted to guanosines hence they have been termed G-<br>
clamps or cytidine analogs. Many of these polycyclic heterocyclic compounds have the general<br>
formula:<br><br>
Representative cytosine analogs that make 3 hydrogen bonds with a guanosine in a<br>
second strand include l,3-diazaphenoxazine-2-one (R10= O, R11 - R14= H) (Kurchavov, et al,<br>
Nucleosides and Nucleotides, 1997, 16, 1837-1846), l,3-diazaphenothiazine-2-ohe (Rio= S, Rn<br>
- R14= H), (Lin, K.-Y.; Jones, R. J.; Matteucci, M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 3873-3874) and<br>
6,7,8,9-tetrafluoro-l,3-diazaphenoxazine-2-one (R10 = O, R11 - R14 = F) (Wang, J.; Lin, K.-Y.,<br>
Matteucci, M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998, 39, 8385-8388). Incorporated into oligonucleotides these<br>
base modifications were shown to hybridize with complementary guanine and the latter was also<br>
shown to hybridize with adenine and to enhance helical thermal stability by extended stacking<br>
interactions(also see U.S. Patent Application entitled "Modified Peptide.Nucleic Acids" filed<br>
May 24, 2002, Serial number 10/155,920; and U.S. Patent Application entitled "Nuclease<br>
Resistant Chimeric Oligonucleotides" filed May 24, 2002, Serial number 10/013,295, both of<br>
which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety).<br>
Further helix-stabilizing properties have been observed when a cytosine<br>
analog/substitute has an aminoethoxy moiety attached to the rigid l,3-diazaphenoxazine-2-one<br><br><br>
scaffold (R10- O, R11 = -O-(CH2)2-NH2, R12-M=H ) (Lin, K.-Y.; Matteucci, M. J, Am. Chem.<br>
Soc. 1998,120, 8531-8532). Binding studies demonstrated that a single incorporation could<br>
enhance the binding affinity of a model oligonucleotide to its complementary target DNA or<br>
RNA with a Tm of up to 18° relative to 5-methyl cytosine (dC5""), which is the highest known<br>
affinity enhancement for a single modification, yet. On the other hand, the gain in helical<br>
stability does not compromise the specificity of the oligonucleotides. The Tm data indicate an<br>
even greater discrimination between the perfect match and mismatched sequences compared to<br>
dC5me. It was suggested that the tethered amino group serves as an additional hydrogen bond<br>
donor to interact with the Hoogsteen face, namely the 06, of a complementary guanine thereby<br>
forming 4 hydrogen bonds. This means that the increased affinity of G-clamp is mediated by the<br>
combination of extended base stacking and additional specific hydrogen bonding.<br>
Further tricyclic heterocyclic compounds and methods of using them that are amenable<br>
to the present invention are disclosed in United States Patent 6,028,183 and United States Patent<br>
6,007,992, the contents of both are incorporated herein in their entirety.<br>
The enhanced binding affinity of the phenoxazine derivatives together with their<br>
uncompromised sequence specificity makes them valuable nucleobase analogs for the<br>
development of more potent antisense-based drugs. In fact, promising data have been derived<br>
from in vitro experiments demonstrating that heptanucleotides containing phenoxazine<br>
substitutions are capable to activate RNaseH, enhance cellular uptake and exhibit an increased<br>
antisense activity (Lin, K-Y; Matteucci, M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998,120, 8531-8532). The<br>
activity enhancement was even more pronounced in case of G-clamp, as a single substitution was<br>
shown to significantly improve the in vitro potency of a 20mer 2'-deoxyphosphorothioate<br>
oligonucleotides (Flanagan, W. M.; Wolf, J.J.; Olson, P.; Grant, D.; Lin, K.-Y.; Wagner, R. W.;<br>
Matteucci, M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1999, 96, 3513-3518). Nevertheless, to optimize<br>
oligonucleotide design and to better understand the impact of these heterocyclic modifications on<br>
the biological activity, it is important to evaluate their effect on the nuclease stability of the<br>
oligomers.<br>

Oligomeric compounds used in the compositions of the present invention can also be<br>
modified to have one or more stabilizing groups that are generally attached to one or both<br>
termini of single-stranded oligomeric compounds or to one or more of the 3' or 5' termini of<br>
either strand of a double-stranded compound to enhance properties such as for example nuclease<br>
stability. Included in stabilizing groups are cap structures. By "cap structure or terminal cap<br>
moiety" is meant chemical modifications, which have been incorporated at either terminus of<br>
oligonucleotides (see for example Wincott et al., WO 97/26270, incorporated by reference<br>
herein). These terminal modifications protect the oligomeric compounds having terminal nucleic<br>
acid molecules from exonuclease degradation, and can help in delivery and/or localization within<br>
a cell. The cap can be present at the 5'-terminus (5'-cap) or at the 3'-terminus (3'-cap) or can be<br>
present on both termini. This cap structure is not to be confused with the inverted<br>
methylguanosine "5'cap" present at the 5' end of native mRNA molecules. In non-limiting<br>
examples, the 5'-cap includes inverted abasic residue (moiety), 4',5'-methylene nucleotide; 1-<br><br>

3'-Endo Modifications<br>
The terms used to describe the conformational geometry of homoduplex nucleic acids<br>
are "A Form" for RNA and "B Form" for DNA. The respective conformational geometry for<br>
RNA and DNA duplexes was determined from X-ray diffraction analysis of nucleic acid fibers<br>
(Arnott and Hukins, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 1970, 47, 1504.) In general, RNA.RNA<br>
duplexes are more stable and have higher melting temperatures (Tm's) than DNA:DNA duplexes<br>
(Sanger et al., Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure, 1984, Springer-Verlag; New York, NY.;<br>
Lesnik et al., Biochemistry, 1995, 34, 10807-10815; Conte et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 1997, 25,<br>
2627-2634). The increased stability of RNA has been attributed to several structural features,<br>
most notably the improved base stacking interactions that result from an A-form geometry<br><br>
(Searle et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 1993, 21, 2051-2056). The presence of the 2' hydroxyl in<br>
RNA biases the sugar toward a C3' endo pucker, i.e., also designated as Northern pucker, which<br>
causes the duplex to favor the A-fonn geometry. In addition, the 2' hydroxyl groups of RNA can<br>
form a network of water mediated hydrogen bonds that help stabilize the RNA duplex (Egli et<br>
al., Biochemistry, 1996, 35, 8489-8494). On the otheT hand, deoxy nucleic acids prefer a C2'<br>
endo sugar pucker, i.e., also known as Southern pucker, which is thought to impart a less stable<br>
B-form geometry (Sanger, W. (1984) Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure, Springer-Verlag,<br>
New York, NY). As used herein, B-form geometry is inclusive of both C2'-endo pucker and<br>
O4'-endo pucker. This is consistent with Berger, et. al., Nucleic Acids Research, 1998,26,2473-<br>
2480, who pointed out that in considering the furanose conformations which give rise to B-form<br>
duplexes consideration should also be given to a O4'-cndo pucker contribution.<br>
DNA:RNA hybrid duplexes, however, are usually less stable than pure RNA:RNA<br>
duplexes, and depending on their sequence may be either more or less stable than DNA:DNA<br>
duplexes (Searle et al, Nucleic Acids Res., 1993, 21, 2051-2056). The structure of a hybrid<br>
duplex is intermediate between A- and B-form geometries, which may result in poor stacking<br>
interactions (Lane et al, Eur. J. Biochem., 1993, 215, 297-306; Fedoroff et al, J. Mol Biol,<br>
1993, 233, 509-523; Gonzalez et al, Biochemistry, 1995, 34, 4969-4982; Horton et al, J. Mol<br>
Biol, 1996, 264, 521-533). The stability of the duplex formed between a target RNA and a<br>
synthetic sequence is central to therapies such as but not limited to antisehse mechanisms<br>
including RNAse H, RNAi or any mechanisms that require the binding of a oligomeric<br>
compound to an RNA target strand. In the case of antisense, effective inhibition of the mRNA<br>
requires that the antisense compound have a sufficiently high binding affinity with the mRNA.<br>
Otherwise the desired interaction between the oligomeric antisense compound and target mRNA<br>
strand will occur infrequently, resulting in decreased efficacy.<br>
One routinely used method of modifying the sugar puckering, is the substitution of the<br>
sugar at the 2'-position with a substituent group that influences the sugar geometry. The<br>
influence on ring conformation is dependant on the nature of the substituent at the 2'-position. A<br>
number of different substituents have been studied to determine their sugar puckering effect. For<br>
example, 2'-halogens have been studied showing that the 2'-fluoro derivative exhibits the largest<br>
population (65%) of the C3'-endo form, and the 2'-iodo exhibits the lowest population (7%). The<br>
populations of adenosine (2'-OH) versus deoxyadenosine (2'-H) are 36% and 19%, respectively.<br>
Furthermore, the effect of the 2'-fluoro group of adenosine dimers (2'-deoxy-2'-fiuoroadenosine -<br><br>
2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-adenosine) is further correlated to the stabilization of the stacked<br>
conformation.<br>
As expected, the relative duplex stability can be enhanced by replacement of 2'-OH<br>
groups with 2'-F groups thereby increasing the C3'-endo population. It is assumed that the<br>
highly polar nature of the 2'-F bond and the extreme preference for C3'-endo puckering may<br>
stabilize the stacked conformation in an A-form duplex. Data from UV hypochromicity, circular<br>
dichroism, and 1H NMR also indicate that the degree of stacking decreases as the<br>
electronegativity of the halo substituent decreases. Furthermore, steric bulk at the 2'-position of<br>
the sugar moiety is better accommodated in an A-fonn duplex than a'B-form duplex. Thus, a<br>
2'-substituent on the 3'-terminus of a dinucleoside monophosphate is thought to exert a number<br>
of effects on the stacking conformation: steric repulsion, furanose puckering preference,<br>
electrostatic repulsion, hydrophobic attraction, and hydrogen bonding capabilities. These<br>
substituent effects are thought to be determined by the molecular size, electronegativity, and<br>
hydrophobicity of the substituent. Melting temperatures of complementary strands is also<br>
increased with the 2'-substituted adenosine diphosphates. It is not clear whether the 3'-endo<br>
preference of the conformation or the presence of the substituent is responsible for the increased<br>
binding. However, greater overlap of adjacent bases (stacking) can be achieved with the 3'-endo<br>
conformation.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention oligomeric compounds include nucleosides<br>
synthetically modified to induce a 3'-endo sugar conformation. A nucleoside can incorporate<br>
synthetic modifications of the heterocyclic base, the sugar moiety or both to induce a desired 3'-<br>
endo sugar conformation. These modified nucleosides are used to mimic RNA-like nucleosides<br>
so that particular properties of an oligomeric compound can be enhanced while maintaining the<br>
desirable 3'-endo conformational geometry. There is an apparent preference for an RNA type<br>
duplex (A form helix, predominantly 3'-endo) as a requirement (e.g. trigger) of the RNA<br>
interference manchinery which is supported in part by the fact that duplexes composed of 2'-<br>
deoxy-2'-F-nucleosides appear efficient in triggering an RNAi response in the C. elegans system.<br>
Properties that are enhanced by using more stable 3'-endo nucleosides include, but aren't limited<br>
to, modulation of pharmacokinetic properties through modification of protein binding, protein<br>
off-rate, absorption and clearance; modulation of nuclease stability as well as chemical stability;<br>
modulation of the binding affinity and specificity of the oligomer (affinity and specificity for<br>
enzymes as well as for complementary sequences); and increasing efficacy of RNA cleavage.<br>
The present invention provides oligomeric compounds that can act as triggers of the RNAi<br><br><br>
Nucleoside conformation is influenced by various factors including substitution at the<br>
2', 3' or 4'-positions of the pentofuranosyl sugar. Electronegative substituents generally prefer<br>
the axial positions, while sterically demanding substituents generally prefer the equatorial<br>
positions (Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure, Wolfgang Sanger, 1984, Springer-Verlag.)<br>
Modification of the 2' position to favor the 3-endo conformation can be achieved while<br>
maintaining the 2'-OH as a recognition element (Gallo et al., Tetrahedron (2001), 57, 5707-5713.<br>
Harry-O'kuru et al., J, Org. Chem., (1997), 62(6), 1754-1759 and Tang et al., J. Org. Chem.<br>
(1999), 64, 747-754).<br>
Alternatively, preference for the 3'-endo conformation can be achieved by deletion of<br>
the 2'-OH as exemplified by 2'deoxy-2'F-nucleosides (Kawasaki et al., J. Med. Chem. (1993),<br>
36, 831-841), which adopts the 3'-endo conformation positioning the" electronegative fluorine<br>
atom in the axial position. Other modifications of the ribose ring, for example substitution at the<br>
4'-position to give 4'-F modified nucleosides (Guillerm et al., Bioorganic and Medicinal<br>
Chemistry Letters (1995), 5, 1455-1460 and Owen et al., J. Org. Chem. (1976), 41, 3010-3017),<br>
or for example modification to yield methanocarba nucleoside analogs (Jacobson et al.s J. Med.<br>
Chem. Lett. (2000), 43, 2196-2203 and Lee et al., Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters<br>
(2001), 11,1333-1337) also induce preference for the 3'-endo conformation. Along similar lines,<br>
oligomeric compounds which trigger an RNAi response might be composed of one or more<br>
nucleosides modified in such a way that conformation is locked into a C3'-endo type<br>
conformation, i.e. Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA, Singh et al, Chem. Commun. (1998), 4, 455-<br>
456), and ethylene bridged Nucleic Acids (ENA™, Morita et al, Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal<br>
Chemistry Letters (2002), 12, 73-76.)<br>
The preferred conformation of modified nucleosides and their oligomers can be<br>
estimated by various methods such as molecular dynamics calculations, nuclear magnetic<br><br>
resonance spectroscopy and CD measurements. Hence, modifications predicted to induce RNA-<br>
like conformations, A-form duplex geometry in an oligomeric context, are selected for use in the<br>
modified oligonucleotides of the present invention. The synthesis of numerous of the modified<br>
nucleosides amenable to the present invention are known in the art (see for example, Chemistry<br>
of Nucleosides and Nucleotides Vol 1-3, ed. Leroy B. Townsend, 1988, Plenum press., and the<br>
examples section below.)<br>
In one aspect, the present invention is directed to oligomeric compounds that are<br>
prepared having enhanced properties, compared to native RNA, against nucleic acid targets. In<br>
designing enhanced oligomeric compounds, a target is identified and an oligomeric compound is<br>
selected having an effective length and sequence that is complementary to a portion of the target<br>
sequence. Each nucleoside of the selected sequence is scrutinized for possible enhancing<br>
modifications. One modification would be the replacement of one or more RNA nucleosides<br>
with nucleosides that have the same 3'-endo conformational geometry but, in addition, an<br>
enhancing property. Such modifications can enhance chemical and nuclease stability relative to<br>
native RNA while at the same time being much cheaper and easier to synthesize and/or<br>
incorporate into an oligonucleotide. The selected oligomeric compound sequence can be further<br>
divided into regions and the nucleosides of each region evaluated for enhancing modifications<br>
that can be the result of a chimeric configuration. Consideration is also given to the 5' and 3'-<br>
termini as there are often advantageous modifications that can be made to one or more of the<br>
terminal nucleosides. The oligomeric compounds of the present invention may include at least<br>
one 5'-modified phosphate group on a single strand or on at least one 5'-position phosphate of a<br>
double-stranded sequence or sequences. Further modifications are also considered such as<br>
internucleoside linkages, conjugate groups, substitute sugars or bases, substitution of one or<br>
more nucleosides with nucleoside mimetics and any other modification that can enhance the<br>
affinity of the selected sequence for its intended target.<br>
One synthetic 2'-modification that imparts increased nuclease resistance and a very high<br>
binding affinity to nucleotides is the 2-methoxyethoxy (2'-M0E, 2'-OCH2CH2OCH3) side chain<br>
(Baker et al, J. Biol. Chem., 1997, 272, 11944-12000). One of the immediate advantages of the<br>
2'-MOE substitution is the improvement in binding affinity, which is greater than many similar 2'<br>
modifications such as 0-methyl, 0-propyl, and O-aminopropyl. Oligomers having the 2'-O-<br>
methoxyethyl substituent also have been shown to be antisense inhibitor's of gene expression<br>
with promising features for in vivo use (Martin, P., Helv. Chim. Acta, 1995, 78, 486-504;<br>
Altmann et al, Chimia, 1996, 50, 168-176; Altmann et al., Biochem. Soc. Trans., 1996, 24, 630-<br><br>
637; and AItmann et al, Nucleosides Nucleotides, 1997,16,917-926). Relative to DNA, the<br>
oligomers having the 2'-MOE modification displayed improved RNA affinity and higher<br>
nuclease resistance. Chimeric oligomers having 2'-M0E substituents in the wing nucleosides<br>
and an internal region of deoxy-phosphorothioate nucleotides (also termed a gapped oligomer or<br>
gapmer) have shown effective reduction in the growth of tumors in animal models at low doses.<br>
2-MOE substituted oligomers have also shown outstanding promise as antisense compounds in<br>
several disease states. One such MOE substituted oligomer is approved for the treatment of<br>
CMV retinitis.<br>
Most of the 2'-M0E substituents display a gauche conformation around the C-C bond of<br>
the ethyl linker. However, in two cases, a trans conformation around the C-C bond is observed.<br>
The lattice interactions in the crystal include packing of duplexes against each other via their<br>
minor grooves. Therefore, for some residues, the conformation of the 2'-O-substituent is<br>
affected by contacts to an adjacent duplex. In general, variations in the conformation of the<br>
substituents (e.g. g+ or g~ around the C-C bonds) create a range of interactions between<br>
substituents, both inter-strand, across the minor groove, and intra-strand. At one location, atoms<br>
of substituents from two residues are in van der Waals contact across the minor groove.<br>
Similarly, a close contact occurs between atoms of substituents from two adjacent intra-strand<br>
residues.<br>
Previously determined crystal structures of A-DNA duplexes were for those that<br>
incorporated isolated 2'-O-methyl T residues. In the crystal structure noted above for the 2'-<br>
MOE substituents, a conserved hydration pattern has been observed for the 2'-M0E residues. A<br>
single water molecule is seen located between 02', 03' and the methoxy oxygen atom of the<br>
substituent, forming contacts to all three of between 2.9 and 3.4 A. In addition, oxygen atoms of<br>
substituents are involved in several other hydrogen bonding contacts. For example, the methoxy<br>
oxygen atom of a particular 2'-0-substituent forms a hydrogen bond to N3 of an adenosine from<br>
the opposite strand via a bridging water molecule.<br>
In several cases a water molecule is trapped between the oxygen atoms 02', 03' and<br>
OC of modified nucleosides. 2'-MOE substituents with trans conformation around the C-C<br>
bond of the ethylene glycol linker are associated with close contacts between OC and N2 of a<br>
guanosine from the opposite strand, and, water-mediated, between OC and N3(G). When<br>
combined with the available thermodynamic data for duplexes containing 2'-MOE modified<br>
strands, this crystal structure allows for further detailed structure-stability analysis of other<br>
modifications.<br><br>
In extending the crystallographic structure studies, molecular modeling experiments<br>
were performed to study further enhanced binding affinity of oligonucleotides having 2r-O-<br>
modifications. The computer simulations were conducted on compounds of SEQ ID NO: 10,<br>
above, having 2'-O-modifications located at each of the nucleosides of the oligonucleotide. The<br>
simulations were performed with the oligonucleotide in aqueous solution using the AMBER<br>
force field method (Cornell et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1995,117,5179-5197)(modeling software<br>
package from UCSF, San Francisco, CA). The calculations were performed on an Indigo2 SGI<br>
machine (Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA).<br>
Another 2'-sugar substituent group that gives a 3-endo sugar conformational geometry<br>
is the 2'-OMe group. 2'-Substitution of guanosine, cytidine, and uridine dinucleoside phosphates<br>
with the 2-OMe group showed enhanced stacking effects with respect to the corresponding<br>
native (2'-OH) species leading to the conclusion that the sugar is adopting a C3'-endo<br>
conformation. In this case, it is believed mat the hydrophobic attractive forces of the methyl<br>
group tend to overcome the destabilizing effects of its steric bulk.<br>
The ability of oligonucleotides to bind to their complementary target strands is<br>
compared by determining the melting temperature (Tm ) of the hybridization complex of the<br>
oligonucleotide and its complementary strand. The melting temperature (Tm), a characteristic<br>
physical property of double helices, denotes the temperature (in degrees centigrade) at which<br>
50% helical (hybridized) versus coil (unhybridized) forms are present. Tm is measured by using<br>
the UV spectrum to determine the formation and breakdown (melting) of the hybridization<br>
complex. Base stacking, which occurs during hybridization, is accompanied by a reduction in<br>
UV absorption (hypochromicity). Consequently, a reduction in UV absorption indicates a higher<br>
Tm. The higher the Tm, the greater the strength of the bonds between the strands.<br>
Freier and Altmann, Nucleic Acids Research, (1997) 25:4429-4443, have previously<br>
published a study on the influence of structural modifications of oligonucleotides on the stability<br>
of their duplexes with target RNA. In this study, the authors reviewed a series of<br>
oligonucleotides containing more than 200 different modifications that had been synthesized and<br>
assessed for their hybridization affinity and Tm. Sugar modifications studied included<br>
substitutions on the 2'-position of the sugar, 3'-substitution, replacement of the 4'-oxygen, the use<br>
of bicyclic sugars, and four member ring replacements. Several nucleobase modifications were<br>
also studied including substitutions at the 5, or 6 position of thymine, modifications of<br>
pyrimidine heterocycle and modifications of the purine heterocycle. Modified internucleoside<br><br>
linkages were also studied including neutral, phosphorus and non-phosphorus containing<br>
internucleoside linkages.<br>
Increasing the percentage of C3'-endo sugars in a modified oligonucleotide targeted to<br>
an RNA target strand should preorganize this strand for binding to RNA. Of the several sugar<br>
modifications that have been reported and studied in the literature, the incorporation of<br>
electronegative substituents such as 2'-fluoro or 2'-alkoxy shift the sugar conformation towards<br>
the 3' endo (northern) pucker conformation. This preorganizes an oligonucleotide that<br>
incorporates such modifications to have an A-form conformational geometry. This A-form<br>
conformation results in increased binding affinity of the oligonucleotide' to a target RNA strand.<br>
In addition, for 2'-substituents containing an ethylene glycol motif, a gauche interaction<br>
between the oxygen atoms around the O-C-C-0 torsion of the side chain may have a stabilizing<br>
effect on the duplex (Freier ibid.). Such gauche interactions have been observed experimentally<br>
for a number of years (Wolfe et al. Ace. Chem. Res., 1972,5,102; Abe et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc,<br>
1976,98,468). This gauche effect may result in a configuration of the side chain that is<br>
favorable for duplex formation. The exact nature of this stabilizing configuration has not yet<br>
been explained. While we do not want to be bound by theory, it may be that holding the O-C-C-<br>
0 torsion in a single gauche configuration, rather man a more random distribution seen in an<br>
alkyl side chain, provides an entropic advantage for duplex formation.<br>
Representative 2'-substituent groups amenable to the present invention that give A-form<br>
conformational properties (3'-endo) to the resultant duplexes include 2'-O-alkyl, 2'-O-substituted<br>
alkyl and 2'-fluoro substituent groups. Suitable for the substituent groups are various alkyl and<br>
aryl ethers and thioethers, amines and monoalkyl and dialkyl substituted amines. It is further<br>
intended that multiple modifications can be made to one or more of the oligomeric compounds of<br>
the invention at multiple sites of one or more monomelic subunits (nucleosides are suitable) and<br>
or internucleoside linkages to enhance properties such as but not limited to activity in a selected<br>
application<br>

Salts, prodrugs and bioequivalents:<br>
The oligomeric compounds of the invention encompass any pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts, esters, or salts of such esters, or any other compound which, upon<br>
administration to an animal including a human, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) the<br>
biologically active metabolite or residue thereof. Accordingly, for example, the disclosure is<br>
also drawn to prodrugs and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts of such prodrugs, and other bioequivalents.<br>
The term "prodrug" indicates a therapeutic agent that is prepared in an inactive or less<br>
active form that is converted to an active form (i.e., drug) within the body or cells thereof by the<br>
action of endogenous enzymes or other chemicals and/or conditions. In particular, prodrug<br>
versions of the oligonucleotides of the invention are prepared as SATE ((S-acetyl-2-thioethyl)<br>
phosphate) derivatives according to the methods disclosed in WO 93/24510 to Gosselin et al.,<br>
published December 9, 1993 or in WO 94/26764 to Imbach et al.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to physiologically and<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention: i.e., salts that retain the<br>
desired biological activity of the parent compound and do not impart undesired toxicological<br>
effects thereto.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts are formed with met als or amines, such<br>
as alkali and alkaline earth met als or organic amines. Examples of met als used as cations are<br>
sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and the like. Examples of suitable amines are<br>
N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, dicyclohexylamine,<br><br><br>
ethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine, and procaine (see, for example, Berge et al.,<br>
"Pharmaceutical Salts," J. of Pharma Sci, 1977, 66, 1-19). The base addition salts of said acidic<br>
compounds are prepared by contacting the free acid form with a sufficient amount of the desired<br>
base to produce the salt in the conventional manner. The free acid form may be regenerated by<br>
contacting the salt form with an acid and isolating the free acid in the conventional manner. The<br>
free acid forms differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties<br>
such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to their respective free<br>
acid for purposes of the present invention. As used herein, a "pharmaceutical addition salt"<br>
includes a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of an acid form of one of the components of the<br>
compositions of the invention. These include organic or inorganic acid salts of the amines. Acid<br>
salts are the hydrochlorides, acetates, salicylates, nitrates and phosphates. Other suitable<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known to those skilled in the art and include basic<br>
salts of a variety of inorganic and organic acids, such as, for example, with inorganic acids, such<br>
as for example hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid; with<br>

glucose-6-phosphate, N-cyclohexylsulfamic acid (with the formation' of cyclamates), or with<br>
other acid organic compounds, such as ascorbic acid. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of<br>
compounds may also be prepared with a pharmaceutically acceptable cation. Suitable<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable cations are well known to those skilled in the art and include<br>
alkaline, alkaline earth, ammonium and quaternary ammonium cations. Carbonates or hydrogen<br>
carbonates are also possible.<br>
For oligonucleotides, examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include but are not<br>
limited to (a) salts formed with cations such as sodium, potassium, ammonium, magnesium,<br>
calcium, polyamines such as spermine and spermidine, etc.; (b) acid addition salts formed with<br><br>

acid, polygalacturonic acid, and the like; and (d) salts formed from elemental anions such as<br>
chlorine, bromine, and iodine. In one embodiment, double-stranded oligomeric compounds are<br>
provided as sodium salts.<br>
As used herein, the term "patient" refers to a mammal that is afflicted with one or more<br>
disorders associated with survivin expression or overexpression. It will be understood that the<br>
most suitable patient is a human. It is also understood that this invention relates specifically to<br>
the inhibition of mammalian survivin expression or overexpression.<br>
It is recognized that one skilled in the art may affect the disorders associated with<br>
survivin expression or overexpression by treating a patient presently afflicted with the disorders<br>
with an effective amount of the compound of the present invention. Thus, the terms "treatment"<br>
and "treating" are intended to refer to all processes wherein there may be a slowing, interrupting,<br>
arresting, controlling, or stopping of the progression of the disorders described herein, but does<br>
not necessarily indicate a total elimination of all symptoms.<br>
As used herein, the term "effective amount" or "therapeutically effective amount" of a<br>
compound of the present invention refers to an amount that is effective in treating or preventing<br>
the disorders described herein.<br>
The oligomeric compounds of the present invention can be utilized for diagnostics,<br>
therapeutics, prophylaxis and as research reagents and kits. For therapeutics, a patient, such as a<br>
human, suspected of having a disease or disorder which can be treated by. modulating the<br>
expression of survivin is treated by administering antisense compounds in accordance with this<br>
invention. The compounds of the invention can be utilized in pharmaceutical compositions by<br>
adding an effective amount of an antisense compound to a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
diluent or carrier. Use of the antisense compounds and methods of the invention may also be<br>
useful prophylactically, e.g., to prevent or delay infection, inflammation or tumor formation, for<br>
example.<br>
The present invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions and formulations<br>
which include oligomeric compounds of the invention. The pharmaceutical compositions of the<br>
present invention may be administered in a number of ways depending upon whether local or<br><br>
systemic treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be topical<br>
(including ophthalmic and to mucous membranes including vaginal and rectal delivery),<br>
pulmonary, e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols) including by nebulizer;<br>
intratracheal, intranasal, epidermal, intradermal and transdermal, oral or parenteral. Parenteral<br>
administration includes intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular<br>
injection, drip or infusion; or intracranial, e.g., intrathecal or intraventricular, administration.<br>
Oligonucleotides with at least one 2'-O-methoxyethyl modification are believed to be particularly<br>
useful for oral administration.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions and formulations for topical administration may include<br>
transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and<br>
powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and<br>
the like may be necessary or desirable. Coated condoms, gloves and the like may also be useful.<br>
Compositions and formulations for oral administration include powders or granules,<br>
suspensions or solutions in water or non-aqueous media, capsules, sachets or tablets. Thickeners,<br>
flavoring agents, diluents, emulsifiers, dispersing aids or binders may be desirable. Compositions<br>
for oral administration also include pulsatile delivery compositions and bioadhesive composition<br>
as described in copending U.S. Patent Application Serial Nos. 09/944,493, filed August 22,<br>
2001, and 09/935,316, filed August 22, 2001, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated<br>
herein by reference. Oral administration for treatment of the disorders is described herein.<br>
However, oral administration is not the only route. For example, the intravenous route may be<br>
desirable as a matter of convenience or to avoid potential complications related to oral<br>
administration. When a compound of the present invention is administered through the<br>
intravenous route, an intravenous bolus or slow infusion may be desired.<br>
Compositions and formulations for parenteral, intrathecal or intraventricular<br>
administration may include sterile aqueous solutions which may also contain buffers, diluents<br>
and other suitable additives such as, but not limited to, penetration enhancers, carrier compounds<br>
and other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions and/or formulations comprising the oligomeric<br>
compounds of the present invention may also include penetration enhancers in order to enhance<br>
the alimentary delivery of the oligonucleotides. Penetration enhancers may be classified as<br>
belonging to one of five broad categories, i.e., fatty acids, bile salts, chelating agents, surfactants<br>
and non-surfactants (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, 8,<br>
91-192; Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7:1, 1-33).<br><br>
One or more penetration enhancers from one or more of these broad categories may be included.<br>
Various fatty acids and their derivatives which act as penetration enhancers include, for example,<br>
oleic acid, lauric acid (C12), capric acid (C10), myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoleic<br>
acid, linolenic acid, dicaprate, tricaprate, recinleate, monoolein (a.k.a. 1-monooleoyl-rac-<br>
glycerol), dilaurin, caprylic acid, arichidonic acid, glyceryl 1-monocaprate,<br>
l-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one, acylcarnitines, acylcholines, mono- and di-glycerides and<br>
physiologically acceptable salts thereof (i.e., oleate, laurate, caprate, myristate, palmitate,<br>
stearate, linoleate, etc.) (Lee et aL, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991,<br>
8:2, 91-192; Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7:1, 1-33;<br>
El-Hariri et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 1992, 44, 651-654). Examples of some fatty acids are<br>
sodium caprate and sodium laurate, used singly or in combination at concentrations of 0.5 to 5%.<br>
Various natural bile salts, and their synthetic derivatives, act as penetration enhancers.<br>
Thus, the term "bile salt" includes any of the naturally occurring components of bile as well as<br>
any of their synthetic derivatives. Examples of bile salts are chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)<br>
and/or ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), generally used at concentrations of 0.5 to 2%.<br>
Complex formulations comprising one or more penetration enhancers may be used. For<br>
example, bile salts may be used in combination with fatty acids to make complex formulations.<br>
Suitable combinations include CDCA combined with sodium caprate or.sodium laurate<br>
(generally 0.5 to 5%).<br>
Chelating agents include, but are not limited to, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate<br>
(EDTA), citric acid, salicylates (e.g., sodium salicylate, 5-methoxysalicylate and homovanilate),<br>
N-acyl derivatives of collagen, laureth-9 and N-amino acyl derivatives of beta-diketones<br>
(enamines)(Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, 8:2, 92-192;<br>
Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7:1, 1-33; Buur et al., J.<br>
Control Rel., 1990, 14, 43-51). Chelating agents have the added advantage of also serving as<br>
DNase inhibitors.<br>
Surfactants include, for example, sodium lauryl sulfate, polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether<br>
and polyoxyethylene-20-cetyl ether (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier<br>
Systems, 1991, 8:2, 92-191); and perfluorochemical emulsions, such as FC-43 (Takahashi et al.,<br>
J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 1988, 40, 252-257).<br>
Non-surfactants include, for example, unsaturated cyclic ureas, 1-alkyl- and<br>
1-alkenylazacyclo-alkanone derivatives (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug<br>
Carrier Systems, 1991, 8:2, 92-191); and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as<br><br><br>
diclofenac sodium, indomethacin and phenylbutazone (Yamashita et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol,<br>
1987,39,621-626).<br>
A' phannaceutically acceptable earner" (excipient) is a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
solvent, suspending agent or any other pharmacologically inert vehicle for delivering one or<br>
more nucleic acids to an animal. The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier may be liquid or solid<br>
and is selected with the planned manner of administration in mind so as to provide for the<br>
desired bulk, consistency, etc., when combined with a nucleic acid and the other components of a<br>
given pharmaceutical composition. Typical pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are<br>
not limited to, binding agents (e.g., pregelatinized maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, etc.); fillers (e.g., lactose and other sugars, microcrystalline<br>
cellulose, pectin, gelatin, calcium sulfate, ethyl cellulose, polyacrylates or calcium hydrogen<br>
phosphate, etc.); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc, silica, colloidal silicon dioxide,<br>
stearic acid, met allic stearates, hydrogenated vegetable oils, corn starch, polyethylene glycols,<br>
sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, etc.); disintegrates (e.g., starch, sodium starch glycolate, etc.);<br>
or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate, etc.). Sustained release oral delivery systems<br>
and/or enteric coatings for orally administered dosage forms are described in U.S. Patents<br>
4,704,295; 4,556,552; 4,309,406; and 4,309,404.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may additionally contain other adjunct<br>
components conventionally found in pharmaceutical compositions, at their art-established usage<br>
levels. Thus, for example, the compositions may contain additional compatible<br>
pharmaceutically-active materials such as, e.g., antipruritics, astringents, local anesthetics or<br>
anti-inflammatory agents, or may contain additional materials useful in physically formulating<br>
various dosage forms of the composition of present invention, such as dyes, flavoring agents,<br>
preservatives, antioxidants, opacifiers, thickening agents and stabilizers. However, such<br>
materials, when added, should not unduly interfere with the biological activities of the<br>
components of the compositions of the invention.<br>
Regardless of the method by which the oligomeric compounds of the invention are<br>
introduced into a patient, colloidal dispersion systems may be used as delivery vehicles to<br>
enhance the in vivo stability of the compounds and/or to target the compounds to a particular<br>
organ, tissue or cell type. Colloidal dispersion systems include, .but are not limited to,<br>
macromolecule complexes, nanocapsules, microspheres, beads and lipid-based systems including<br>
oil-in-water emulsions, micelles, mixed micelles, liposomes and lipid:oligonucleotide complexes<br>
of uncharacterized structure. One colloidal dispersion system is a plurality of liposomes.<br><br>
Liposomes are microscopic spheres having an aqueous core surrounded by one or more outer<br>
layer(s) made up of lipids arranged in a bilayer configuration (see, generally, Chonn et al.,<br>
Current Op. Biotech., 1995, 6, 698-708).<br>
Certain embodiments of the invention provide for liposomes and other compositions<br>
one or more other chemotherapeutic agents which function by a non-antisense mechanism.<br>
Examples of such chemotherapeutic agents include but are not limited to daunorubicin,<br>
daunomycin, dactinomycin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, esorubicin, bleomycin,<br>
mafosfemide, ifosfamide, cytosine arabinoside, bis-chloroethylnitrosurea, busulfan, mitomycin<br>
C, actinomycin D, mithramycin, prednisone, hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone, tamoxifen,<br>
dacarbazine, procarbazine, hexamethylmelamine, pentamethylmelamine, mitoxantrone,<br>
amsacrine, chlorambucil, methylcyclohexylnitrosurea, nitrogen mustards, melphalan,<br>
cyclophosphamide, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, 5-azacytidine, hydroxyurea,<br>
deoxycoformycin, 4-hydroxyperoxycyclophosphoramide, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), 5-<br>
fluorodeoxyuridine (5-FUdR), methotrexate (MTX), colchicine, taxol; vincristine, vinblastine,<br>
etoposide (VP-16), trimetrexate, irinotecan, topotecan, gemcitabine, teniposide, cisplatin,<br>
carboplatin and diethylstilbestrol (DES). See, generally, The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and<br>
Therapy, 15th Ed. 1987, pp. 1206-1228, Berkow et al., eds., Rahway, N.J. When used with the<br>
compounds of the invention, such chemotherapeutic agents may be used individually (e.g., 5-FU<br>
and oligonucleotide), sequentially (e.g., 5-FU and oligonucleotide for a period of time followed<br>
by MTX and oligonucleotide), or in combination with one or more other such chemotherapeutic<br>
agents {e.g., 5-FU, MTX and oligonucleotide, or 5-FU, radiotherapy and oligonucleotide).<br>
Anti-inflammatory drugs, including but not limited to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory<br>
drugs and corticosteroids, and antiviral drugs, including but not limited to ribivirin, vidarabine,<br>
acyclovir and ganciclovir, may also be combined in compositions of the invention. See,<br>
generally, The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, 15th Ed., Berkow et al., eds., 1987,<br>
Railway, N.J., pages 2499-2506 and 46-49, respectively). Other non-antisense chemotherapeutic<br>
agents are also within the scope of this invention. Two or more combined compounds may be<br>
used together or sequentially.<br>
The formulation of therapeutic compositions and their subsequent administration is<br>
believed to be within the skill of those in the art. Dosing is dependent on severity and<br>
responsiveness of the disease state to be treated, with the course of treatment lasting from several<br>
days to several months, or until a cure is effected or a diminution of the disease state is achieved.<br>
Optimal liusing schedules can be calculated from measurements of drug accumulation in the<br><br><br>
body of the patient. Persons of ordinary skill can easily determine optimum dosages, dosing<br>
methodologies and repetition rates. Optimum dosages may vary depending on the relative<br>
potency of individual oligonucleotides, and can generally be estimated based on EC50S found to<br>
be effective in in vitro and in vivo animal models. In general, dosage is from 0.01 μg to 100 g<br>
per kg of body weight, and may be given once or more daily, weekly, monthly or yearly.<br>
Persons of ordinary skill in the art can easily estimate repetition rates for dosing based on<br>
measured residence times and concentrations of the drug in bodily fluids or tissues. Following<br>
successful treatment, it may be desirable to have the patient undergo maintenance therapy to<br>
prevent the recurrence of the disease state, wherein the oligonucleotide is administered in<br>
maintenance doses, ranging from 0.01 μg to 100 g per kg of body weight, once or more daily,<br>
weekly, monthly, or yearly. For double-stranded compounds, the dose must be calculated to<br>
account for the increased nucleic acid load of the second strand (as with compounds comprising<br>
two separate strands) or the additional nucleic acid length (as with self complementary single<br>
strands having double-stranded regions).<br>
Double-stranded compounds can be introduced into cells in a number of different ways.<br>
For example, the double-stranded compounds can be administered by microinjection;<br>
bombardment by microparticles covered by the double-stranded compounds; soaking the cells in<br>
a solution of the double-stranded compounds; electroporation of cells in the presence of the<br>
double-stranded compounds; liposome-mediated delivery of double-stranded compounds;<br>
transfection mediated by chemicals such as calcium phosphate, cationic lipids, etc.; viral<br>
infection; transformation; and the like. The double-stranded compounds can be introduced along<br>
with components that enhance RNA uptake by the cells, stabilize the annealed strands, or<br>
otherwise increase the inhibition of function of the target polynucleotide sequence. In the case<br>
of a cell culture or tissue expoant, the cells are conveniently incubated in a solution containing<br>
the double-stranded compounds, or subjected to lipid-mediated transformation.<br>
Determination of the optimal amounts of double-stranded compounds to be<br>
administered to human or animal patients for the prevention or treatment of pathologies<br>
associated with survivin expression or overexpression, as well as methods of administering<br>
therapeutic or pharmaceutical compositions comprising such double-stranded oligonucleotides,<br>
is within the skill of those in the pharmaceutical art. Dosing of a human or animal patient is<br>
dependent on the nature of the symptom, condition, or disease; the nature of the infected cell or<br>
tissue; the patient's condition; body weight; general health; sex; diet; time, duration, and route of<br>
administration; rates of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the double-<br><br>
stranded compounds; combination with other drugs; severity of the pathology; and the<br>
responsiveness of the disease state being treated. The amount of double-stranded compounds<br>
administered also depends on the nature of the target polynucleotide sequence or region thereof,<br>
and the nature of the double-stranded compounds, and can readily be optimized to obtain the<br>
desired level of effectiveness. The course of treatment can last from several days to several<br>
weeks or several months, or until a cure is effected or an acceptable diminution or prevention of<br>
the disease state is achieved. Optimal dosing schedules can be calculated from measurements of<br>
drug accumulation in the body of the patient in conjunction with the effectiveness of the<br>
treatment. Persons of ordinary skill can easily determine optimum dosages, dosing<br>
methodologies, and repetition rates.<br>
While the embodiments of the invention have been described with specificity in<br>
accordance with certain of the embodiments, the following examples serve only to illustrate the<br>
invention and are not intended to limit the same.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Nucleoside phosphoramidites for oligonucleotide synthesis<br>
deoxy and 2'-alkoxy amidites<br>
2'-Deoxy and 2'-methoxy beta-cyanoethyldiisopropyl phosphoramidites were purchased<br>
from commercial sources (e.g. Chemgenes, Needham, MA or Glen Research, Inc. Sterling, VA).<br>
Other 2'-O-alkoxy substituted nucleoside amidites are prepared as described in U.S. Patent<br>
5,506,351, herein incorporated by reference. For oligonucleotides synthesized using 2'-alkoxy<br>
amidites, the standard cycle for unmodified oligonucleotides was utilized, except the wait step<br>
after pulse delivery of tetrazole and base was increased to 360 seconds.<br>
Oligonucleotides containing 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Me-C) nucleotides were<br>
synthesized according to published methods (Sanghvi, et. al., Nucleic Acids Research, 1993, 21,<br>
3197-3203) using commercially available phosphoramidites (Glen Research, Sterling VA or<br>
ChemGenes, Needham, MA).<br>
2'-Fluoro amidites<br>
2'-FIuorodeoxyadenosine amidites<br>
2'-fluoro oligonucleotides were synthesized as described previously (Kawasaki, et. al.,<br>
J. Med Chem., 1993, 36, 831-841) and U. S. Patent 5,670,633, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Briefly, the protected nucleoside N6-benzoyl-2'-deoxy-2'-fluoroadenosine was synthesized<br>
utilizing commercially available 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine as starting material and by<br><br><br>
modifying literature procedures whereby the 2'-alpha-fluoro atom was introduced by a SN2-<br>
displacement of a 2'-beta-trityl group. Thus N6-benzoyl-9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine was<br>
selectively protected in moderate yield as the 3',5'-ditetrahydropyranyl (THP) intermediate.<br>
Deprotection of the THP and N6-benzoyl groups was accomplished using standard<br>
methodologies and standard methods were used to obtain the 5'-dimethoxytrityl-(DMT) and 5'-<br>
DMT-3'-phosphoramidite intermediates.<br>
2'-Fluorodeoxyga«nonne<br>
The synthesis of 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoroguanosine was accomplished using<br>
tetraisopropyldisiloxahyl (TPDS) protected 9-oeta-D-arabinofuranosylguanine as starting<br>
material, and conversion to the intermediate diisobutyrylarabinofuranosylguanosine.<br>
Deprotection of the TPDS group was followed by protection of the hydroxyl group with THP to<br>
give diisobutyryl di-THP protected arabinofuranosylguanine.<br>
Selective 0-deacylation and triflation was followed by treatment of the crude product<br>
with fluoride, then deprotection of the THP groups. Standard methodologies were used to obtain<br>
the S'-DMT- and 5'-DMT-3'-phosphoramidites.<br>
2'-Fluorotiridine<br>
Synthesis of 2l-deoxy-2'-fluorouridine was accomplished by the modification of a<br>
literature procedure in which 2,2'-anhydro-l-beta-D-arabinofuranosyluracil was treated with<br>
70% hydrogen fluoride-pyridine. Standard procedures were used to obtain the 5'-DMT and 5'-<br>
DMT-3'phosphoramidites.<br>
2'-Fluorodeoxycytidine<br>
2'-deoxy-2'-fluorocytidine was synthesized via amination of 2'-deoxy-2'-fluorouridine,<br>
followed by selective protection to give N4-benzoyl-2'-deoxy-2'-fluorocytidine. Standard<br>
procedures were used to obtain the 5-DMTand 5'-DMT-3'phosphoramidites.<br>
2'-O-(2-Methoxyethyl) modified amidites<br>
2'-O-Methoxyethyl-substituted nucleoside amidites were prepared as follows, or<br>
alternatively, as per the methods of Martin, P., Helvetica Chimica Acta, 1995, 78,486-504.<br>
2,2'-Anhydro(l-(beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)-5-methyluridine)<br>
5-Methyluridine (ribosylthymine, commercially available through Yamasa, Choshi,<br>
Japan) (72.0 g, 0.279 M), diphenylcarbonate (90.0 g, 0.420 M) and sodium bicarbonate (2.0 g,<br>
0.024 M) were added to DMF (300 mL). The mixture was heated to reflux, with stirring,<br>
allowing the evolved carbon dioxide gas to be released in a controlled manner. After 1 hour, the<br>
slightly darkened solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting syrup was<br><br>
poured into diethylether (2.5 L), with stirring. The product formed a gum. The ether was<br>
decanted and the residue was dissolved in a minimum amount of methanol (ca. 400 mL). The<br>
solution was poured into fresh ether (2.5 L) to yield a stiff gum. The ether was decanted and the<br>
gum was dried in a vacuum oven (60°C at 1 mm Hg for 24 h) to give a solid that was crushed to<br>
a light tan powder (57 g, 85% crude yield). The NMR spectrum was consistent with the<br>
structure, contaminated with phenol as its sodium salt (ca. 5%). The material was used as is for<br>
further reactions (or it can be purified further by column chromatography using a gradient of<br>
methanol in ethyl acetate (10-25%) to give a white solid, mp 222-4°C).<br>
2'-O-Methoxyethyl-5-methyluridime<br>
2,2'-Anhydro-5-methyluridine (195 g, 0.81 M), tris(2-memoxyethyl)borate (231 g, 0.98<br>
M) and 2-methoxyethanol (1.2 L) were added to a 2 L stainless steel pressure vessel and placed<br>
in a pre-heated oil bath at 160°C. After heating for 48 hours at 155-160°C, the vessel was<br>
opened and the solution evaporated to dryness and triturated with MeOH (200 mL). The residue<br>
was suspended in hot acetone (1 L). The insoluble salts were filtered, washed with acetone (150<br>
mL) and the filtrate evaporated. The residue (280 g) was dissolved in CH3CN (600 mL) and<br>
evaporated. A silica gel column (3 kg) was packed in CH2Cl2/Acetone/MeOH (20:5:3)<br>
containing 0.5% Et3NH. The residue was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (250 mL) and adsorbed onto silica<br>
(150 g) prior to loading onto the column. The product was eluted with the packing solvent to<br>
give 160 g (63%) of product. Additional material was obtained by reworking impure fractions.<br>
2'-O-Methoxyethyl-5'-O-dimethoxytrityl-5-methyluridine<br>
2'-O-Methoxyethyl-5-methyluridine (160 g, 0.506 M) was co-evaporated with pyridine<br>
(250 mL) and the dried residue dissolved in pyridine (1.3 L). A first aliquot of dimethoxytrityl<br>
chloride (94.3 g, 0.278 M) was added and the mixture stirred at room temperature for one hour.<br>
A second aliquot of dimethoxytrityl chloride (94.3 g, 0.278 M) was added and the reaction<br>
stirred for an additional one hour. Methanol (170 mL) was then added to stop the reaction.<br>
HPLC showed the presence of approximately 70% product. The solvent was evaporated and<br>
triturated with CH3CN (200 mL). The residue was dissolved in CHCl3 (1.5 L) and extracted<br>
with 2x500 mL of saturated NaHCO3 and 2x500 mL of saturated NaCl. The organic phase was<br>
dried over Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated. 275 g of residue was obtained. The residue was<br>
purified on a 3.5 kg silica gel column, packed and eluted with EtOAc/Hexane/Acetone (5:5:1)<br>
containing 0.5% Et3MH. The pure fractions were evaporated to give 164 g of product.<br>
Approximately 20 g additional was obtained from the impure fractions to give a total yield of<br>
183 g (57%).<br><br>
3'-O-Acetyl-2'-O-methexyetiiyl-5'-O-dimethoxytrityl-5-methyluidine<br>
2'-O-Methoxyethyl-5'-O-dimethoxytrityl-5-methyluridine (106 g, 0.167 M),<br>
DMF/pyridine (750 mL of a 3:1 mixture prepared from 562 mL of DMF end 188 mL of<br>
pyridine) and acetic anhydride (24.38 mL, 0.258 M) were combined and stirred at room<br>
temperature for 24 hours. The reaction was monitored by tlc by first quenching the tlc sample<br>
with the addition of MeOH. Upon completion of the reaction, as judged by tlc, MeOH (50 mL)<br>
was added and the mixture evaporated at 35°C. The residue was dissolved in CHCl3 (800 mL)<br>
and extracted with 2x200 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate and 2x200 mL of saturated NaCl.<br>
The water layers were back extracted with 200 mL of CHCl3. The combined organics were dried<br>
with sodium sulfate and evaporated to give 122 g of residue (approx. 90% product). The residue<br>
was purified on a 3.5 kg silica gel column and eluted using EtOAc/Hexane(4:l). Pure product<br>
fractions were evaporated to yield 96 g (84%). An additional 1.5 g was recovered from later<br>
fractions.<br>
3'-O-Acetyl-2'-O-methoxyethyl-5'-O-dimethoxytrityl-5-methyl-4-triazoleuridine<br>
A first solution was prepared by dissolving 3'-O-acetyta-2'-O-methoxyethyl-5'-O-<br>
dimethoxytrityl-5-methyluridine (96 g, 0.144 M) in CH3CN (700 mL) and set aside.<br>
Triethylamine (189 mL, 1.44 M) was added to a solution of triazole (90 g, 1.3 M) in<br>
CH3CN (1 L), cooled to -5°C and stirred for 0.5 hours using an overhead stirrer. POCl3 was<br>
added dropwise, over a 30 minute period, to the stirred solution maintained at 0-10°C, and the<br>
resulting mixture stirred for an additional 2 hours. The first solution was added dropwise, over a<br>
45 minute period, to the latter solution. The resulting reaction mixture was stored overnight in a<br>
cold room. Salts were filtered from the reaction mixture and the solution was evaporated. The<br>
residue was dissolved in EtOAc (1 L) and the insoluble solids were removed by filtration. The<br>
filtrate was washed with 1x300 mL of NaHCO3 and 2x300 mL of saturated NaCl, dried over<br>
sodium sulfate and evaporated. The residue was triturated with EtOAc to give the title<br>
compound.<br>
2'-O-Methoxyethyl-5'-O-dimethoxytrityl-5-methylcytidine<br>
A solution of 3'-O-acetyl-2'-O-methoxyethyl-5'-O-dimethoxytrityl-5-methyl-4-<br>
triazoleuridine (103 g, 0.141 M) in dioxane (500 mL) and NH4OH (30 mL) was stirred at room<br>
temperature for 2 hours. The dioxane solution was evaporated and the residue.azeotroped with<br>
MeOH (2x200 mL). The residue was dissolved in MeOH (300 mL) and transferred to a 2 liter<br>
stainless steel pressure vessel. MeOH (400 mL) saturated with NH3 gas was added and the<br>
vessel heated to 100°C for 2 hours (tlc showed complete conversion). The vessel contents were<br><br>
evaporated to dryness and the residue was dissolved in EtOAc (500 mL) and washed once with<br>

RNA Synthesis<br>
In general, RNA synthesis chemistry is based on the selective incorporation of various<br>
protecting groups at strategic intermediary reactions. Although one of ordinary skill in the art<br>
will understand the use of protecting groups in organic synthesis, a useful class of protecting<br>
groups includes silyl ethers. In particular bulky silyl ethers are used to protect the 5'-hydroxyI in<br>
combination with an acid-labile orthoester protecting group on the 2'-hydroxyl. This set of<br>
protecting groups is then used with standard solid-phase synthesis technology. It is important to<br>
lastly remove the acid labile orthoester protecting group after all other synthetic steps.<br>
Moreover, the early use of the silyl protecting groups during synthesis ensures facile removal<br>
when desired, without undesired deprotection of 2' hydroxyl.<br>
Following this procedure for the sequential protection of the 5'-hydroxyl in combination<br>
with protection of the 2'-hydroxyl by protecting groups that are differentially removed and are<br>
differentially chemically labile, RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized.<br>
RNA oligonucleotides are synthesized in a stepwise fashion. Each nucleotide is added<br>
sequentially (3'- to 5'-direction) to a solid support-bound oligonucleotide. The first nucleoside at<br>
the 3'-end of the chain is covalently attached to a solid support. The nucleotide precursor, a<br>
ribonucleoside phosphoramidite, and activator are added, coupling the second base onto the 5 '-<br>
end of the first nucleoside. The support is washed and any unreacted 5'-hydroxyl groups are<br>
capped with acetic anhydride to yield 5'-acetyl moieties. The linkage is then oxidized to the<br>
more stable and ultimately desired P(V) linkage. At the end of the nucleotide addition cycle, the<br>
5'-silyl group is cleaved with fluoride. The cycle is repeated for each subsequent nucleotide.<br>
Following synthesis, the methyl protecting groups on the phosphates are cleaved in 30<br>
minutes utilizing 1 M disodium-2-carbamoyl-2-cyanoethylene-l,l-dithiolate trihydrate (S2Na2)<br>
in DMF. The deprotection solution is washed from the solid support-bound oligonucleotide using<br>
water. The support is then treated with 40% methylamine in water for 10 minutes at 55 °C. This<br>
releases the RNA oligonucleotides into solution, deprotects the exocyclic amines, and modifies<br>
the 2'- groups. The oligonucleotides can be analyzed by anion exchange HPLC at this stage.<br>
The 2'-orthoester groups are the last protecting groups to be removed. The ethylene<br>
glycol monoacetate orthoester protecting group developed by Dharmacon Research, Inc.<br>
(Lafayette, CO), is one example of a useful orthoester protecting group which, has the following<br><br>
important properties. It is stable to the conditions of nucleoside phosphoramidite synthesis and<br>
oligonucleotide synthesis. However, after oligonucleotide synthesis the oligonucleotide is treated<br>
with methylamine which not only cleaves the oligonucleotide from the solid support but also<br>
removes the acetyl groups from the orthoesters. The resulting 2-ethyl-hydroxyl substituents on<br>
the orthoester are less electron withdrawing than the acctylated precursor. As a result, the<br>
modified orthoester becomes more labile to acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Specifically, the rate of<br>
cleavage is approximately 10 times faster after the acetyl groups are removed. Therefore, this<br>
orthoester possesses sufficient stability in order to be compatible with oligonucleotide synthesis<br>
and yet, when subsequently modified, permits deprotection to be carried out under relatively<br>
mild aqueous conditions compatible with the final RNA oligonucleotide product.<br>
Additionally, methods of RNA synthesis are well known in the art (Scaringe, S. A. Ph.D.<br>

RNA antisense compounds (RNA oligonucleotides, whether single or double stranded)<br>
of the present invention can be synthesized by the methods herein or purchased from Dharmacon<br>
Research, Inc (Lafayette, CO). Once synthesized, complementary RNA antisense compounds<br>
can then be annealed by methods known in the art to form double-stranded (duplexed) antisense<br>
compounds. For example, duplexes can be formed by combining 30 μl of each of the<br>
complementary strands of RNA oligonucleotides (50 uM RNA oligonucleotide solution) and 15<br>
μl of 5X annealing buffer (100 mM potassium acetate, 30 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4,2 mM<br>
magnesium acetate) followed by heating for 1 minute at 90°C, then 1 hour at 37°.C. The<br>
resulting duplexed antisense compounds can. be used in kits, assays, screens, or other methods to<br>
investigate the role of a target nucleic acid, or for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.<br>
Example 6: Oligonucleotide isolation<br>
After cleavage from the controlled pore glass column (Applied Biosystems) and<br>
deblocking in concentrated ammonium hydroxide at 55ºC for 18 hours, the oligonucleotides or<br>
oligonucleosides are purified by precipitation twice out of 0.5 M NaCl with 2.5 volumes ethanol.<br>
Synthesized oligonucleotides were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on denaturing<br><br>
gels and judged to be at least 85% full length material. The relative amounts of<br>
phosphorothioate and phosphodiester linkages obtained in synthesis were periodically checked<br>
by 3lP nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and for some studies oligonucleotides were<br>
purified by HPLC, as described by Chiang et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1991, 266, 18162-18171.<br>
Results obtained with HPLC-purified material were similar to those obtained with non-HPLC<br>
purified material.<br>
Example 7: Oligonucleotide synthesis - 96 well plate format<br>
Oligonucleotides were synthesized via solid phase P(III) phosphoramidite chemistry on<br>
an automated synthesizer capable of assembling 96 sequences simultaneously in a standard 96<br>
well format. Phosphodiester internucleotide linkages were afforded by oxidation with aqueous<br>
iodine. Phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages were generated by sulfurization utilizing 3,H-<br>
1,2 benzoditbiole-3-one 1,1 dioxide (Beaucage Reagent) in anhydrous acetonitrile. Standard<br>
base-protected beta-cyanoethyldiisopropyl phosphoramidites were purchased from commercial<br>
vendors (e.g. PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, or Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ). Non-<br>
standard nucleosides are synthesized as per known literature or patented methods. They are<br>
utilized as base protected beta-cyanoethyldiisopropyl phosphoramidites.<br>
Oligonucleotides were cleaved from support and deprotected with concentrated NH4OH<br>
at elevated temperature (55-60°C) for 12-16 hours and the released product then dried in vacuo.<br>
The dried product was then re-suspended in sterile water to afford a master plate from which all<br>
analytical and test plate samples are then diluted utilizing robotic pipettors.<br>
Example 8: Oligonucleotide analysis - 96 well plate format<br>
The concentration of oligonucleotide in each well was assessed by dilution of samples<br>
and UV absorption spectroscopy. The foil-length integrity of the individual products was<br>
evaluated by capillary electrophoresis (CE) in either the 96 well format (Beckman P/ACEJ<br>
MDQ) or, for individually prepared samples, on a commercial CE apparatus (e.g., Beckman<br>
P/ACEJ 5000, ABI 270). Base and backbone composition was confirmed by mass analysis of<br>
the compounds utilizing electrospray-mass spectroscopy. All assay test plates were diluted from<br>
the master plate using single and multi-channel robotic pipettors. Plates were judged to be<br>
acceptable if at least 85% of the compounds on the plate were at least 85% full length.<br><br>
Example 9: Cell culture and oligonucleotide treatment<br>
The effect of antisense compounds on target nucleic acid expression can be tested in<br>
any of a variety of cell types provided that the target nucleic acid is present at measurable levels.<br>

following cell types are provided for illustrative purposes, but other cell types can be routinely<br>
used.<br>

Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and antibiotics. Cells were routinely passaged by trypsinization<br>
and dilution when they reached appropriate confluence. Cells were seeded into 96-well plates<br>
(Falcon-Primaria #3872) at a density of about 10,000 cells/well for use in RT-PCR analysis.<br><br>
For Northern blotting or other analyses, cells may be seeded onto 100 mm or other<br>
standard tissue culture plates and treated similarly, using appropriate volumes of medium and<br>
oligonucleotide. For Northern blotting or other analyses, cells may be seeded onto 100 mm or<br>

HUVEC cells:<br>
HUVEC were obtained from ATCC and routinely cultured in EBM (Clonetics Corp,<br>
Walkersille, MD) supplemented with SingleQuots supplements. Cells were routinely passaged<br>
by trypsinizaiton and dilution when they reached 90% confluence were maintained for up to 15<br>
passages. For cells grown in 96-well plates (10,000 cells/well), wells were washed once with<br>
200 uL OPTI-MEM-1™ reduced-serum medium (Gibco BRL) and then treated with 130 uL of<br>
OPT1-MEM-1™ containing 12 ug/mL LIPOFECTIN™ (Gibco BRL) and the desired double-<br>
stranded compounds at a final concentration of 25 nM. After 5 hours of treatment, the medium<br>
was replaced with fresh medium. Cells were harvested 16 hours after dsRNA treatment, at<br>
which time RNA was isolated and target reduction measured by RT-PCR.<br>
Treatment with oligomeric compounds:<br>
When cells reached 80% confluency, they were treated with oligonucleotide. For cells<br>
grown in 96-well plates, wells were washed once with 200 μL OPTI-MEMJ-1 reduced-serum<br>
medium (Gibco BRL) and men treated with 130 μL of OPTI-MEM-1 containing 3.75 μg/mL<br>
LIPOFECTINJ (Gibco BRL) and the desired oligonucleotide at a final concentration of 150 nM.<br>
For dsRNA compounds, 2 x 130 μL of OPTI-MEM-1 was used. After,4 hours of treatment, the<br>
medium was replaced with fresh medium. Cells were harvested 16 hours after oligonucleotide<br>
treatment. The concentration of oligonucleotide used varies from cell line to cell line. To<br>
determine the optimal oligonucleotide concentration for a particular cell line, the cells are treated<br>
with a positive control oligonucleotide at a range of concentrations. For human cells the positive<br>
control RNAse H oligonucleotide is ISIS 13920, TCCGTCATCGCTCCTCAGGG, SBQ ID<br>
NO: 1, a 2'-O-methoxyethyI gapmer (2'-O-methoxyethyls shown in bold) with a<br>
phosphorothioate backbone which is targeted to human H-ras. For mouse or rat cells the positive<br>
control oligonucleotide is ISIS 15770, ATGCATTCTGCCCCCAAGGA, SEQ ID NO: 2, a 2'-<br>
O-methoxyethyl gapmer (2'-O-methoxyethyls shown in bold) with a phosphorothioate backbone<br>
which is targeted to both mouse and rat c-raf. The concentration of positive control<br>
oligonucleotide that results in 80% inhibition of H-ras (for ISIS 13920)-or c-raf (for ISIS 15770)<br>
mRNA is then utilized as the screening concentration for new oligonucleotides in subsequent<br><br><br>
experiments for that .cell line. If 80% inhibition is not achieved, the lowest concentration of<br>
positive control oligonucleotide that results in 60% inhibition of H-ras or c-raf mRNA is then<br>
utilized as the oligonucleotide screening concentration in subsequent experiments for that cell<br>
line. If 60% inhibition is not achieved, that particular cell line is deemed as unsuitable for<br>
oligonucleotide transfection experiments.<br>
Example 10: Analysis of oligonucleotide inhibition of survivin expression<br>
Antisense modulation of survivin expression can be assayed in a variety of ways known<br>
in the art. For example, survivin mRNA levels can be quantitated by, e.g., Northern blot<br>
analysis, competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Real-time<br>
quantitative PCR is presently preferred. RNA analysis can be performed on total cellular RNA<br>
or poly(A)+ mRNA. Methods of RNA isolation are taught in, for example, Ausubel, F.M. et al.,<br>

Example 11: Poly(A)+ mRNA isolation<br>
Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated according to Miura et al., Clin. Chem., 1996, 42, 1758-<br>
1764. Other methods for poly(A)+ mRNA isolation are taught in, for example, Ausubel, P.M. et<br>
al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Volume 1, pp. 4.5.1-4.5.3, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.,<br>
1993. Briefly, for cells grown on 96-well plates, growth medium was removed from the cells<br>
and each well was washed with 200 uL cold PBS. 60 uL lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6,<br>
1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 20 mM vanadyl-ribonucleoside complex) was added to<br>
each well, the plate was gently agitated and then incubated at room temperature for five minutes.<br>
55 uL of lysate was transferred to Oligo d(T) coated 96-well plates (AGCT Inc., Irvine CA).<br>
Plates were incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, washed 3 times with 200 μL of wash<br>
buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6,1 mM EDTA, 0.3 M NaCl). After the final wash, the plate was<br>
blotted on paper towels to remove excess wash buffer and then air-dried for 5 minutes. 60 μL of<br>
elution buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6), preheated to 70°C was added to each well, the plate was<br>
incubated on a 90°C hot plate for 5 minutes, and the eluate was then transferred to a fresh 96-<br>
well plate.<br>
Cells grown on 100 mm or other standard plates may be treated similarly, using<br>
appropriate volumes of all solutions.<br>
Example 12: Total RNA isolation<br>
Total mRNA was isolated using an RNEASY % kit and buffers purchased from<br>
Qiagen, Inc. (Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's recommended procedures. Briefly, for<br>
cells grown on 96-well plates, growth medium was removed from the cells and each well was<br>
washed with 200 μL cold PBS. 100 μL Buffer RLT was added to'each well and the plate<br>
vigorously agitated for 20 seconds. 100 μL of 70% ethanol was then added to each well and the<br>
contents mixed by pippeting three times up and down. The samples were then transferred to the<br>
RNEASY 96 well plate attached to a QIAVAC manifold fitted with a waste collection tray and<br>
attached to a vacuum source. Vacuum was applied for 15 seconds. 1 mL of Buffer RWl was<br>
added to each well of the RNEASY 96 plate and the vacuum again applied for 15 seconds. 1 mL<br>
of Buffer RPE was then added to each well of the RNEASY 96 plate and the vacuum applied for<br><br>
a period of 15 seconds. The Buffer RPE wash was then repeated and the vacuum was applied for<br>
an additional 10 minutes. The plate was then removed from the QIAVAC manifold and blotted<br>
dry on paper towels. The plate was then re-attached to the QIAVAC manifold fitted with a<br>
collection tube rack containing 1.2 mL collection tubes. RNA was then eluted by pipetting 60<br>
μL water into each well, incubating 1 minute, and then applying the vacuum for 30 seconds. The<br>
elution step was repeated with an additional 60 uL water.<br>
Example 13: Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of sarvivin mRNA levels<br>
Quantitation of survivin mRNA levels was determined by real-time quantitative PCR<br>
using the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City,<br>
CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. This is a closed-tube, noh-gel-based, fluorescence<br>
detection system which allows high-throughput quantitation of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)<br>
products in real-time. As opposed to standard PCR, in which amplification products are<br>
quantitated after the PCR is completed, products in real-time quantitative PCR are quantitated as<br>
they accumulate. This is accomplished by including in the PCR reaction an oligonucleotide<br>
probe that anneals specifically between the forward and reverse PCR primers, and contains two<br>
fluorescent dyes. A reporter dye (e.g., JOE or FAM, obtained from either Operon Technologies<br>
Inc., Alameda, CA or PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) is attached to the 5' end of the<br>
probe and a quencher dye (e.g., TAMRA, obtained from either Operon Technologies Inc.,<br>
Alameda, CA or PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) is attached to the 3' end of the probe.<br>
When the probe and dyes are intact, reporter dye emission is quenched by the proximity of the 3'<br>
quencher dye. During amplification, annealing of the probe to the target sequence creates a<br>
substrate that can be cleaved by the 5'-exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase. During the<br>
extension phase of the PCR amplification cycle, cleavage of the probe by Taq polymerase<br>
releases the reporter dye from the remainder of the probe (and hence from the quencher moiety)<br>
and a sequence-specific fluorescent signal is generated. With each cycle, additional reporter dye<br>
molecules are cleaved from their respective probes, and the fluorescence intensity is monitored<br>
at regular (six-second) intervals by laser optics built into the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence<br>
Detection System. In each assay, a series of parallel reactions containing serial dilutions of<br>
mRNA from untreated control samples generates a standard curve that is used to quantitate the<br>
percent inhibition after antisense oligonucleotide treatment of test samples.<br>
PCR reagents were obtained from PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA. RT-PCR<br>
reactions were carried out by adding 25 μL PCR cocktail (1x TAQMAN buffer A, 5.5 m.M<br><br>
MgCl2, 300 μM each of dATP, dCTP and dGTP, 600 μM of dUTP, 100 nM each of forward<br>
primer, reverse primer, and probe, 20 Units RNAse inhibitor, 1.25 Units AMPLITAQ GOLD,<br>
and 12.5 Units MuLV reverse transcriptase) to 96 well plates containing 25 pL poly(A) mRNA<br>
solution. The RT reaction was carried out by incubation for 30 minutes at 48°C. Following a 10<br>
minute incubation at 95°C to activate the AMPLITAQ GOLD, 40 cycles of a two-step PCR<br>
protocol were carried out: 95°C for 15 seconds (denaturation) followed by 60°C for 1.5 minutes<br>
(annealing/extension). Probes and primers to human survivin were designed to hybridize to a<br>
human survivin sequence, using published sequence information (GenBank accession number<br>
U75285, incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO:3). For human survivin the PCR primers were:<br>
forward primer: AAGGACCACCGCATCTCTACA (SEQ ID NO: 4)<br>
reverse primer: CCAAGTCTGGCTCGTTCTCAGT (SEQ ID NO: 5) "and the PCR probe was:<br>
FAM-CGAGGCTGGCTTCATCCACTGCC-TAMRA (SEQ ID NO: 6) where FAM (PE-<br>
Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) is the fluorescent reporter dye) and TAMRA (PE-Applied<br>
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) is the quencher dye. For human GAPDH the PCR primers were:<br>
forward primer: GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC (SEQ ID NO: 7)<br>
reverse primer: GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC (SEQ ED NO: 8) and the PCR probe was: 5'<br>
JOE-CAAGCTTCCCGTTCTCAGCC-TAMRA 31 (SEQ ID NO: 9) where JOE (PE-Applied<br>
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) is the fluorescent reporter dye) and TAMRA (PE-Applied<br>
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) is the quencher dye.<br>
Example 14: Western blot analysis of survivin protein levels<br>
Western blot analysis (immunoblot analysis) is carried out using standard methods. Cells<br>
are harvested 16-20 hours after oligonucleotide treatment, washed once with PBS, suspended in<br>
Laemmli buffer (100 pl/well), boiled for 5 minutes and loaded on a 16% SDS-PAGE gel. Gels<br>
are run for 1.5 hours at 150 V, and transferred to membrane for western blotting. Appropriate<br>
primary antibody directed to survivin is used, with a radiolabelled or fluorescently labeled<br>
secondary antibody directed against the primary antibody species. Bands are visualized using a<br>
PHOSPHORIMAGER™ (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).<br>
Example 15: Design and screening of double-stranded antisense compounds (siRNAs)<br>
targeting survivin<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a series of double-stranded oligomeric<br>
compounds (siRNAs) comprising the antisense compounds of the present invention and their<br><br>
complements can be designed to target survivin. The nucleobase sequence of the antisense<br>
strand of the duplex comprises at least a portion of an oligonucleotide targeted to survivin as<br>
described herein. The ends of the strands may be modified by the addition of one or more<br>
natural or modified nucleobases to form an overhang. The sense strand of the dsRNA is then<br>
designed and synthesized as the complement of the antisense strand and may also contain<br>
modifications or additions to either terminus. For example, in one embodiment, both strands of<br>
the dsRNA duplex would be complementary over the central nucleobases, each having<br>
overhangs at one or both termini.<br>
For example, a duplex comprising an antisense strand having the sequence:<br>
CGAGAGGCGGACGGGACCG (SEQ ID NO: 10) and having a two-micleobase overhang of<br>
deoxythymidine(dT) would have the following structure:<br>
cgagaggcggacgggaccgTT Antisense (SEQ ID NO:11)<br>
TTgctctccgcctgccctggc Complement(SEQ ID NO:12)<br>
As shown, this double-stranded compound represents a canonical siRNA.<br>
In another embodiment, a duplex comprising an antisense strand having the same<br>
sequence CGAGAGGCGGACGGGACCG (SEQ ID NO: 10) may be prepared with blunt ends<br>
(no single-stranded overhang) as shown:<br>
cgagaggcggacgggaccg Antisense(SEQ IDNO:10)<br>
gctctccgcctgccctggc Complement (SEQ ID NO: 13)<br>
As shown, this double-stranded compound represents a blunt-ended siRNA.<br>
RNA strands of the duplex can be synthesized by methods disclosed herein or purchased<br>
from Dharmacon Research Inc., (Lafayette, CO). Once synthesized, the •complementary strands<br>
are annealed. The single strands are aliquoted and diluted to a concentration of 50 uM. Once<br>
diluted, 30 uL of each strand is combined with 15μL of a 5X solution of annealing buffer. The<br>
final concentration of said buffer is 100 mM potassium acetate, 30 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4,<br>
and 2mM magnesium acetate. The final volume is 75 uL. This solution is incubated for 1 minute<br>
at 90°C and then centrifuged for 15 seconds. The tube is allowed to sit for 1 hour at 37°C at<br>
which time the dsRNA duplexes are used in experimentation. The final concentration of the<br>
dsRNA duplex is 20 uM. This solution can be stored frozen (-20°C) and freeze-thawed up to 5<br>
times.<br>
Once prepared, the duplexed antisense compounds (siRNAs) are evaluated for their<br>
ability to modulate survivin expression according to the protocols described herein.<br>
Cell Culture Conditions; Determination of IC50 Values for dsRNAs In Vitro<br><br>
IC50<br>
In vitro IC50 values for dsRNAs of the present invention can be determined by<br>
contacting in vitro varying concentrations of dsRNAs and appropriate cell lines, tissues, or<br>
organs exhibiting pathologies associated with survivin expression or overexpression, and<br>
determining the quantitative effect(s) of these dsRNAs at such concentrations on parameters<br>
including, but not limited to, various steps, stages, or aspects of survivin pathology or<br>
pathogenesis. Representative parameters that can be studied include, for example, translation of<br>
survivin mRNAs or survivin protein synthesis; effect on surrogate markers; or any other<br>
parameter that is indicative of potential dsRNA therapeutic effectiveness that can be<br>
conveniently measured in vitro.<br>
Given the state of the art, it should be possible for one of ordinary skill to either adapt<br>
currently existing cell-based assays, or develop completely novel in vitro assays, to determine<br>
IC50 values for the dsRNAs disclosed herein without undue experimentation.<br>
Western blots:<br>
For western blot analysis, cells are plated in 10 cm tissue culture dishes (Falcon, #3003)<br>
at a density of 7.5X105 cells/dish. For RT-PCR analysis, 96-well plates'(Corning Incorporated,<br>
#3596) are plated with 1X104 cells/well. Lipofectin (GIBCO/Invitrogen) transfection reagent is<br>
used at a concentration of 3ul/ ml OPTTMEM reduced serum medium (Gibco/Invitrogen)/100nM<br>
siRNA duplex. Lipofectin reagent is incubated with OPTTMEM medium for 30 minutes prior to<br>
the addition of siRNA. The desired amount of siRNA is added and mixed. Further 1:1 dilutions<br>
are performed in OPTIMEM. Cells are washed twice with IX phosphate buffered saline and<br>
then treated with the siRNA/Lipofectin mixture in OPTIMEM. After a 4 hr incubation period,<br>
OPTIMEM medium is replaced with complete growth medium. Cells are harvested after<br>
additional 16-20 hrs for Western blot or RT-PCR analysis.<br>
At the end of the incubation period culture medium is removed and cells are washed<br>
twice with PBS. Cells are lysed in RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM<br>
NaCl, 10 mM Sodium Pyrophosphate, 50 mM Sodium Fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P40) plus<br>
Complete™ Mini protease inhibitor tablets (Roche, #1836153) and 1 mM Sodium orthovanadate<br>
(Sigma) by directly adding buffer to the plate. Lysates are collected by scrapping, transferred to<br>
microfuge tubes and cleared from the cellular debris by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30<br>
minutes at 4°C. Protein concentrations are determined using BCA protein assay reagents<br>
(Pierce). Total cellular protein is subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon-P<br>
membranes (Millipore, #IPVH091). Membranes are probed with primary antibodies to survivin<br><br><br>
(R&amp;D Systems, #AF886) and to P-Actin (Sigma, #A5441). Horseradish peroxidase linked Anti-<br>
rabbit Ig, and anti-mouse Ig, antibodies (Pharmacia) are used as secondary antibodies. Antigen-<br>
antibody complexes are visualized by incubation of membrane in SuperSigmal West Pico<br>
chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce) for 5 minutes followed by capturing of the<br>
chemiluminescence using Fluor-S imager (Biorad) equipped with the cool CCD camera. The<br>
protein bands of interest for each sample are quantified using Quantity One software (Biorad).<br>
The percentage inhibition for each samples are calculated by comparing the survivin/Actin<br>
protein ratio for the sample to survivin/Actin protein ratio for the untreated control. The IC50 is<br>
derived from the non-linear regression analysis of the percentage inhibition data using GraphPad<br>
Prism software (GraphPad Software).<br>
RNA isolation:<br>
Total RNA is isolated using RNeasy® 96 kit according to recommended protocol<br>
(Qiagen). Briefly, cells are washed with 200 μl PBS after removal of growth medium.<br>
Following washing, 100 μl buffer RLT is added, plate is shaken vigorously for about 20 seconds.<br>
To each well 100 μl 70% ethanol are added and mixed by pipetting up and down three times.<br>
Samples are then applied into the wells of the RNeasy 96 plate placed in the QIAvac top base of<br>
the QIAvac 96 manifold, which is attached to a vacuum source. Vacuum is applied for 30<br>
seconds or until transfer is complete. To each well 80 μl of DNase I incubation mix (20 mM<br>
Tris-HCl, pH 8.4,2 mM MgC12, 50 mM KCl and 225 Units/ml DNase I from Invitrogen) is<br>
added and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Buffer RWl (1 ml/well) is added and<br>
the vacuum is applied for 30 seconds. Buffer RPE (1 ml/well) is added to each well and vacuum<br>
is applied for 30 seconds. Washing steps with buffer RWl and RPEl are repeated once more.<br>
The plate is then removed from the manifold and blotted dry on paper towels. The plate is<br>
placed back in the QIAvac manifold and the vacuum is applied for 10 minutes. To elute RNA 30<br>
μl of RNase-free water is added directly onto the membrane of each well, incubated for 1<br>
minutes and vacuum is applied for 30 seconds. In order to maximize the recovery of total RNA<br>
the elution step is repeated with additional 30 μl well RNase-free water.<br>
Quantitation of surviving:<br>
Quantitation of survivin and GAPDH mRNA levels is determined by real-time<br>
quantitative RT-PCR using the ABI PRISM® 7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied<br>
Biosystems). RT-PCR reactions are carried out by adding 15 ul of TaqMan One Step PCR<br>
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, #4309169) reagents (containing 100 nM each of forward<br>
primer and reveise primer, and 200 nM probe) to 96-well plates with 10μ! total RNA. For<br><br>
human survivin, the forward PCR primer is: 5'GCACCACUCCACK}GTTCATTC3' (SEQ ID<br>
NO: 186), and the reverse primer is: 5'TCTCCHTTCCTAAGACATTGCTAAGG3' (SEQ ID<br>
NO: 187). The survivin TaqMan® probe used is<br>
5'(FAM)TGGTGCCACCAGCCTTCCTGTG3' (SEQ ID NO: 188 ) (Biosearch Technologies,<br>
Inc.). This primer-probe set, designed to SEQ ID No 14 was used for all experiments in<br>
Examples 15 to the end. For human GAPDH, TaqMan GAPDH Control Reagent Kit is used<br>
(Applied Biosystems, #402869). The percentage inhibition for each samples are calculated by<br>
comparing the survivin/GAPDH mRNA ratio for the sample to survivuVGAPDH mRNA ratio<br>
for the untreated control. The IC50 is derived from the non-linear regression analysis of the<br>
percentage inhibition data using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software).<br>
Example 16: Design of phenotypic assays and in vivo studies for the use of survivin<br>
inhibitors<br>
Phenotypic assays<br>
Once active oligomeric compounds targeting survivin have been identified by the<br>
methods disclosed herein, the compounds are further investigated in one or more phenotypic<br>
assays, each having measurable endpoints predictive of efficacy in the treatment of a particular<br>
disease state or condition.<br>
Phenotypic assays, kits and reagents for their use are well known to those skilled in the<br>
art and are herein used to investigate the role and/or association of survivin in health and disease.<br>
Representative phenotypic assays, which can be purchased from any one of several commercial<br>
vendors, include those for determining cell viability, cytotoxicity, proliferation or cell survival<br>
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; PerkinElmer, Boston, MA), protein-based assays including<br>
enzymatic assays (Panvera, LLC, Madison, WI; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ; Oncogene<br>
Research Products, San Diego, CA), cell regulation, signal transduction, inflammation, oxidative<br>
processes and apoptosis (Assay Designs Inc., Ann Arbor, MI), triglyceride accumulation (Sigma-<br>
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), angiogenesis assays, tube formation assays, cytokine and hormone<br>
assays and metabolic assays (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA; Amersham<br>
Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).<br>
In one non-limiling example, cells determined to be appropriate for a particular<br>
phenotypic assay (i.e., MCF-7 cells selected for breast cancer studies; adipocytes for obesity<br>
studies) are treated with survivin inhibitors identified from the in vitro studies as well as control<br>
compounds at optimal concentrations which are determined by the methods described above. At<br><br>
the end of the treatment period, treated and untreated cells are analyzed by one or more methods<br>
specific for the assay to determine phenotypic outcomes and endpoints.<br>
Phenotypic endpoints include changes in cell morphology over time or treatment dose as<br>
well as changes in levels of cellular components such as proteins, lipids, nucleic acids,<br>
hormones, saccharides, or met als. Measurements of cellular status which" include pH, stage of the<br>
cell cycle, intake or excretion of biological indicators by the cell, are also endpoints of interest.<br>
Analysis of the geneotype of the cell (measurement of the expression of one or more of<br>
the genes of the cell) after treatment is also used as an indicator of the efficacy or potency of the<br>
survivin inhibitors. Hallmark genes, or those genes suspected to be associated with a specific<br>
disease state, condition, or phenotype, are measured in both treated and untreated cells.<br>
Example 17: Modulation of Human survivin expression by doable-straaded RNA (dsRNA)<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a series of double-stranded oligomeric<br>
compounds comprising the antisense compounds of the present invention and their complements<br>
thereof, were designed to target survivin mRNA. The sense strand of the dsRNA is designed and<br>
synthesized as the reverse complement of the antisense strand, a list of which is shown in Table<br>
1. The oligomeric compounds were evaluated in HeLa cells. Culture methods used for HeLa<br>
cells are found, for example, at www.atcc.org.<br>
For cells grown in 96-well plates, wells were washed once with 200 uL OPTI-MEM-1™<br>
reduced-serum medium (Gibco BRL) and then treated with 130 uL of OPTI-MEM-1™<br>
containing 12 μg/mL LIPOFECTIN™ (Gibco BRL) and the desired dsRNA at a final<br>
concentration of 25 nM. After 5 hours of treatment, the medium was replaced with fresh<br>
medium. Cells were harvested 16 hours after dsRNA treatment, at which time RNA was isolated<br>
and target reduction measured by RT-PCR as described above.<br>
The antisense sequences of the dsRNA oligomeric compounds are shown in Table 1.<br>
Prior to treatment of the HeLa cells, the dsRNA oligomers were generated by annealing the<br>
antisense and sense strands according to the method outlined in Example 16. Target sites are<br>
indicated by the first (5' most) nucleotide number, as given in the sequence source reference<br>
(Genbaak accession no. NM_001168.1, incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO:, 14), to which the<br>
antisense strand of the dsRNA oligonucleotide binds.<br>
All compounds in Table 1 are dsRNAs, 20 nucleotides in length with the antisense strand<br>
listed first (top strand) in the 5' to 3' orientation, and the sense strand lifted second (bottom<br>
strand), also in the 5' to 3' orientation. All nucleosides are ribose and backbone linkages are<br><br>
phosphate (P=O). "Target site" refers to the 5'-most position of the target region on the survivin<br>
mRNA to which the antisense strand is targeted. As such, these compounds are blunt-ended<br>
siKNAs.<br>
Data were obtained by real-time quantitative PCR as described herein. HeLa cells were<br>
treated with double stranded oligomeric compounds (composed of antisense strands hybridized<br>
to their corresponding sense strands) targeting human survivin mRNA.<br><br><br><br>
All dsRNA compounds except ISIS 339046,339047, 339053, 339065, 339068 and<br>
339072 demonstrated over 45% inhibition of survivin expression.<br>
In a dose-response experiment, HeLa cells were treated with 1.1, 3.3, 10 and 30 nM of<br>
the indicated oligonucleotide mixed with 3 ug/mL LIPOFECTIN per 100 nM oligonucleotide as<br>
described by other examples herein. Untreated cells served as controls. Following 16 hours of<br>
treatment, RNA was prepared from cells for subsequent real-time PCR analysis.<br>
Human survivin mRNA expression levels were quantitated by real-time PCR and gene<br>
target quantities were normalized using Ribogreen as described in other examples herein. Data<br>
are averages from two experiments and are shown in Table 2.<br>
The identity of the two strands of the duplex are shown separated by an underscore,<br>
with the antisense strand shown first (antisense strand sense strand).<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 2, the compounds tested inhibit human survivin mRNA expression<br>
in HeLa cells in a concentration-dependent manner.<br>
Example 18: Modulation of Human survivin expression by doable-stranded RNA (dsRNA)<br>
with a 5'-phosphate cap<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a series of double-stranded oligomeric<br>
compounds comprising the antisense compounds shown in Table 1 (ISIS 339045-339073), each<br>
modified with a 5'-terminal phosphate group, and the complements thereof, were designed to<br>
target survivin mRNA. The corresponding dsRNA compounds are ISIS 341201-341229 (Table<br>
3). The sense strand of the dsRNA was designed and synthesized as the complement of the<br>
antisense strand, a list of which is shown in Table 2. The oligomeric cqmpounds were evaluated<br>
in HeLa cells. Culture methods used for HeLa cells are found, for example, at www.atcc.org.<br>
For cells grown in 96-well plates, wells were washed once with 200 μL OPTI-MEM-1™<br>
reduced-serum medium (Gibco BRL) and then treated with 130 μL of OPTI-MEM-1™<br>
containing 12 μg/mL LIPOFECTIN™ (Gibco BRL) and the desired dsRNA at a final<br>
concentration of 25 nM. After 5 hours of treatment, the medium was replaced with fresh<br>
medium. Cells were harvested 16 hours after dsRNA treatment, at which time RNA was isolated<br>
and target reduction measured by RT-PCR.<br>
The dsRNA oligomeric compounds are shown in Table 3. Prior to treatment of the HeLa<br>
cells, the dsRNA oligomers were generated by annealing the antisense and sense strands<br>
according to the method outlined in Example 17. Target sites are indicated by the first (5' most)<br>
nucleotide number, as given in the sequence source reference (Genbank'accession no.<br>
NM_p01168.1, incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: 14), to which the antisense strand of the<br>
dsRNA oligonucleotide binds.<br>
All compounds in Table 3 are oligoribonucleotides, 20 nucleotides in length with the<br>
antisense strand shown first, and the sense strand shown second, both in the 5' to 3' direction.<br>
Compounds in Table 3 have phosphate (P=O) backbones and also comprise a terminal 5'-<br>
phosphate cap on each strand. The compounds in Table 3 are blunt-ended siRNAs.<br><br>
Data were Obtained by real-time quantitative PCR as described in other examples herein.<br>
HeLa cells were treated with double stranded oligomeric compounds targeting human survivin<br>
mRMA<br><br><br><br>
All dsRNA compounds except ISIS 341203,341209, 341221,341224 and 341225<br>
demonstrated greater than 40% inhibition of survivin expression. These data suggest that at<br>
certain target sites, double-stranded compounds with a 5' phosphate display greater potentcy in<br>
inhibiting survivin expression (compare Tables 1 and 3).<br>
Example 19: Comparison of siRNA constructs targeting the same site of survivin mRNA:<br>
dose response<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the effects of altering the sequence of ISIS<br>
339048 on inhibition of human survivin mRNA in HeLa cells was investigated. ISIS 343867 (5'<br>
UUUGAAAAUGUUGAUCUCC-S': SEQ ID NO:81) is the antisense strand for a blunt -ended<br>
siRNA binding to the same site on the survivin mRNA as ISIS 339048, the difference being thai<br>
ISIS 343867 is a 19-mer compound which lacks the 5'-terminal adenine residue of ISIS 339048<br>
ISIS 341881 (UUUGAAAAUGUUGAUCUCCTT; SEQ ID NO:82) is the antisense strand for a<br>
canonical siRNA binding to the same site on the survivin mRNA as ISIS 339048, the difference<br>
being that ISIS 341881 contains a dTdT (deoxythymidine-deoxythymidine) at the 3'-terminus<br>
("dTdT "overhang"). ISIS 343868 has the sequence 5'-GGAGAUCAACAUUUUCAAA-3'<br>
(SEQ ID NO:83), and is the sense strand corresponding to ISIS 343867. ISIS 341880 (SEQ ID<br>
NO: 84) is the sense strand corresponding to ISIS 341881. The constructs are shown in Table 4<br>
with the antisense strand shown first followed by the sense strand, both in 5' to 3' orientation.<br>
The sequences of the survivin siRNA constructs are shown in Table 4, and the dose response<br>
results are shown in Table 5.<br><br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 5, the compounds tested inhibit human survivin mRNA expression<br>
in HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner. ISIS 343867 and ISIS 341881 are more effective at<br>
inhibition of survivin mRNA levels at all but the lowest doses, indicating that a blunt-ended 19-<br>
mer siRNA or a canonical 21-mer siRNA with a dTdT modification at the 3'-terminus may be<br>
advantageous modifications of ISIS 339048, the original blunt-ended 20-mer siRNA.<br>
The IC50 values (nM) of these three compounds were as follows:<br>
Blunt-ended siRNA (20-mer) 339048_339078,0.28 nM;<br>
Blunt-ended siRNA (19-mer) 343867_343868,0.19 nM and<br>
Canonical siRNA	341881_341880, 0.15 nM.<br>
IC50 is defined as the concentration of oligomeric compound which results in 50% inhibition of<br>
mRNA (or protein) expression compared to an unreated control. From these data, the canonical<br>
siRNA and the blunt-ended siRNA (19-mer) both performed significantly better than the blunt-<br>
ended siRNA (20-mer).<br>
Additional blunt-ended constructs targeting human survivin: modified compounds:<br>
A series of siRNA compounds targeting human survivin (GenBank accession no.<br>

Example 20: Modulation of Human survhin expression by single-stranded RNAi<br>
compounds<br>
A series of single-stranded olgometric compounds (asRNA) was evaluated for their<br>
ability to inhibit human survivin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Culture<br>
methods used for HUVEC are found, for example, at www.atcc.org.<br>
The sequences of the asRNA oligomcric compounds are shown in Table 7. Target sites<br>
are indicated by the first (5' most) nucleotide number, as given in the sequence source reference<br>
(Genbank accession no. NM_001168.1, incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: 14), to which the<br>
asRNA oligonucleotide binds.<br>
All compounds, in Table 7 are oligoribonucleotides, 20 nucleotides in length having<br>
phosphorothioate backbone linkages throughout and a terminal phosphate on the 5p end and all<br>
are depicted in the 5' to 3' direction.<br>
Data were obtained by real-time quantitative PCR as described in other examples herein.<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 7, all asRNA compounds demonstrated at least 44% inhibition of<br>
survivin expression.<br>
Example 21: Inhibition of survivin mRNA expression in HeLa cells using dsRNA<br>
constructs to human survivin<br>
Various dsRNA constructs were tested in HeLa cells as described above using the<br>
human survivin primer probe set (SEQ IDs 186-188) to determine the effect of PS substitution<br>
on the ISIS 343867 19-mer (SEQ ID NO:81), the 339048 20-mer (SEQ ID NO: 23), and the<br>
effect of 2'-O-methyl (2'-OMe), 2'-fluoro (2'-F), 2'-O-methoxyethyl (2'-M0E) and 4'-thio (4'-<br>
S) chemistries. The results are shown in Tables 8 and 9. The first ISIS number is the antisense<br>
strand, and the second ISIS number is the sense strand.<br>
Table 8<br>
Inhibition of human survivin mRNA levels by blunt-ended<br>
siRNA algODietric compounds: effect of PS substitution on 19-mer<br><br><br>
These data illustrate that the 19-mer blunt phosphodiester siRNA is more effective at<br>
inhibiting survivin expression and has a ten fold lower IC50 than its 20-mer counterpart<br>
(compare lines A and B). Furthermore, this increased potentcy, as measured by ICSO, is lost<br>
when the backbone linkages are replaced by full phosphorothioate linkages. However, target<br>
reduction is maintained (compare lines A and C).<br>
It is also shown that re-introduction of phosphodiester linkages in the antisense strand in<br>
an alternating register results in recovery of the efficacy, as measured by lowered IC50 values,<br>
but not to the level of the full P=O backbone (for example, compare lines D and H).<br>
Finally, alternating phosphodiester/phosphorothioate linkages in, each strand when in<br>
opposing register (P=O in one strand opposite P=S in the other) had the greatest effect on IC50<br>
values and expression levels, resulting in values that were better than the native optimal<br>
construct (compare lines I and A).<br><br><br><br>
These data suggest that, in contrast to 19-mers, blunt-ended 20-mers have greater<br>
tolerance for phosphorothioate backbone modifications in both strands with IC50 values of 20-<br>
mer full P=S being comparable to 20-mer with full P=O in both strands (compare lines B and C).<br>
However, both 20 mer constructs fail to achieve the ICSO seen with the 19-mer (compare lines B<br>
and C to line A).<br>
Surprisingly, the presence of alternating internucleoside linkages in opposite register<br>
(P=0 in one strand opposite P=S in the other) was able to reduce the IC50 to that seen with the<br>
19-mer native P=O construct (compare lines I and A).<br>
Effects of chemical modifications to the sugar<br>
A series of blunt-ended siRNAs were designed to investigate the effect of sugar<br>
modifications on the ability of the double-stranded compounds to inhibij expression of human<br>
survivn mRNA. The study was performed in HeLa cells as described in other examples herein<br>
and the mRNA levels determined by RT-PCR.<br>
The modifications to the compounds was as follows:<br>
ISIS 352511 comprises 2'-0-methyl modifications (underlined) at positions 2,4, 6, 8, 10,12, 14,<br>
16	and 18.<br>
ISIS 352512 comprises 2'-O-methyl modifications (underlined) at every 2'site.<br>
ISIS 355714 comprises 2'-fluoro modifications (in BOLD) at positions 1,3, 5, 7, 9, 11,13, 15,<br>
17	and 19; and 2'-O-methyl modifications at positions 2, 4, 6, 8,10,12, 14, 16 and 18.<br>
ISIS 352514 comprises alternating 2'-M0E modifications positions 2,4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14,16 and<br>
18.<br>
All other compounds were native RNA compounds. The results are shown in Table 10<br><br><br><br>
These data suggest that double stranded compounds containing alternating motifs of 2T and<br>
2'OMe are optimal constructs for the inhibition of human survivin expression.<br>
Example 22: Dose response experiments in HeLa cells using dsRNA constructs to human<br>
survivin<br>
In a dose-response experiment, HeLa cells were treated with 0.02, 0.2, 2.0 and 20.0 nM<br>
of the indicated dsRNA oligonucleotide mixed with 3 μg/mL LIPOFECTIN per 100 nM<br>
oligonucleotide as described by other examples herein. Untreated cells served as controls.<br>

are averages from two experiments are shown in Table 11. The Isis number of the antisense<br>
strand is shown first, followed by the Isis number of the sense strand (antisensesense).<br><br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 11, many of the dsRNA compounds inhibited human survivin mRNA<br>
expression in HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner.<br>
Example 23: Dose response experiments in HeLa cells using dsRNA constructs to human<br>
survivin<br>
In a dose-response experiment, HeLa cells were treated with 0.014, 0.04, 0.12, 0.37,<br>
1.11, 3.33, 10 and 30 nM of the indicated dsRNA oligonucleotide mixed with 3 μg/mL<br>
LIPOFECTIN per 100 nM oligonucleotide as described by other examples herein. Untreated<br>
cells served as controls. Following 16 hours of treatment, RNA was prepared from cells for<br>
subsequent real-time PCR analysis.<br>
Human survivin mRNA expression levels were quantitated by real-time PCR and gene<br>
target quantities were normalized using Ribogreen as described in other examples herein. Data<br>
are averages from two experiments are shown in Table 12. The Isis" number of the antisense<br>
strand is shown first, followed by the Isis number of the sense strand (antisense_ sense).<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 12, most of the dsRNA compounds inhibited'human survivin mRNA<br>
expression in HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner.<br>
Example 24: Dose-dependent inhibition of survivin mRNA expression in U-87 MG cells<br>
Double-stranded compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit expression of human<br>
survivin mRNA in U-87 MG cells using the methods described above. Various dsRNA<br>
constructs targeting human survivin were tested at concentrations of'0.0019 nM, 0.0096 nM,<br>
0.048 nM, 0.24 nM, 1.2 nM, 6.0 nM, 30.0 nM and 150.0 nM. The results are summarized in<br>
Table 13. The Isis number of the antisense strand is shown first, followed by the Isis number of<br>
the sense strand (antisense_sense).<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 13, most of the dsRNA compounds inhibited human survivin mRNA<br>
expression in U-87 MG cells in a dose-dependent manner.<br>
Example 25: Inhibition of survivin by canonical siRNA oligonucleotides<br>
A series of canonical siRNAs were designed to target human survivin. Each of the<br>
dsRNA sequences specific to survivin and depicted below contain two deoxythymidine<br>
nucleotides at the 3' terminal end of each strand of the RNA oligonucleotide duplex (not shown).<br>
Synthesis, duplex formation and purification of gene-specific siRNAs were performed by<br>
Dharmacon Research Inc. In the Table, "Position" refers to the position of the gene to which the<br>
antisense strand of the.dsRNA binds. Each sequence in the table is listed such that the antisense<br>
strand (top strand) is written in 5' to 3' direction; its complementary sense strand (bottom strand)<br>
is also written in the 5' to 3' direction.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Compounds U17, U20, U23, U36, U48, and U54, when tested for inhibition of survivin<br>
mRNA using the above-described RT-PCR and quantitative Western blot assays, exhibit an IC50<br>
of less than 100 nM.<br>
Compound U17 exhibits potent activity in both quantitative RT-PCR analysis and<br>
Western blot analysis, and is therefore especially preferred for the indications described herein.<br>
Example 26: IC50 values of additional double-stranded compounds targeting human<br>
survivin<br>
Tables 15 and 16 summarize IC50 values using various dsRNAs which were performed<br>
using the methods described herein . The constructs tested comprise the antisense strand in the<br>
5'-3' orientation, and the sense strand in the 5' to 3' orientation, In Table 15, "D" is dose<br>
reponse (mRNA levels) and "W" is Western blot. All internucleoside linkages are<br>
phosphodiester unless otherwise noted by a lowercase "s" indicating a phsphorothioate linkage.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 27: Measurement of antitumor activity in a human glioblastoma xenograft tumor<br>
model<br>
One or more of the oligomeric compounds described herein, including dsRNA<br>
compounds, is tested for antitumor activity in an animal model known in the art. Two such<br>
animal models are (1) U-87MG human glioblastoma xenograft tumor model (Kiaris H, Schally<br>
AV, Varga JL, Antagonists of growth hormone-releasing hormone inhibit the growth of U-<br>
-lot-<br><br>
87MG human glioblastoma in nude mice Neoplasia. 2000 May-Jun;2(3):242-50), and (2) a<br>
YUSAC-2 human melanoma xenograft tumor model (Grossman D, Kim PJ, Schechner JS,<br>
Altieri DC, Inhibition of melanoma tumor growth in vivo by survivin targeting. Proc Natl Acad<br>
Sci USA. 2001 Jan 16;98(2):635-40). A total of 10 CDl nu/nu (Charles River) mice is used<br>
for each group. For implantation, tumor cells are trypsinized, washed in PBS and resuspended in<br>
PBS at 6 X 107 cells/ml (U-87MG) and at 4 X lO7 cells/ml (YUSAC-2) in DMEM. Just before<br>
implantation, animals are irradiated (450 TBI) and cells are mixed in Matrigel (1:1). A total of 6<br>
X 106 (U-87MG) and at 4 X lO6 (YUSAC-2) tumor cells in a 0.2 ml volume are injected<br>
subcutaneously (s.c.) in the left rear flank. Treatment with the test oligomeric compound<br>
(dissolved in 0.9% NaCl, injection grade), or a mismatch control oligoncleotide (dissolved in<br>
0.9% NaCl) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl) is started 3 days post tumor cell implantation. Compounds<br>
are administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) and intravenously (i.v.) for U-87MG and YUSAC-2<br>
studies respectively in a 0.2 ml volume every other day for a total of about 12 doses for the U-<br>
87MG study and about 13 doses for the YUSAC-2 study. Tumor length and width are measured<br>
twice a week, and tumor volume is calculated using the formula: Tumor volume = (LX W2) X<br>
0.536. Tumor volumes are plotted against days post tumor implantation for each treatment<br>
group.<br>
Treatment with one or more of the oligomeric compounds delays human glioblastoma<br>
and melanoma tumor growth when compared with tumor bearing animals treated with vehicle or<br>
25 mg/kg mismatch control oligonucleotide.<br>
Example 28: Stability of alternating 2'-O-metuyl/2'-fluoro siRNA constructs in mouse<br>
plasma<br>
Intact duplex RNA was analyzed from diluted mouse-plasma using an extraction and<br>
capillary electrophoresis method similar to those previously described (Leeds, J.M., et al., 1996,<br>
Anal. Biochem., 235, 36-43; Geary, R.S., et al., 1999, Anal. Biochem., 274, 241-248. Heparin-<br>
treated mouse plasma, from 3-6 month old female Balb/c mice (Charles River Labs) was thawed<br>
from -80 °C and diluted to 25% (v/v) with phosphate buffered saline (140 mM NaCl, 3 raM KCl,<br>
2 mM potassium phosphate, 10 mM sodium phosphate). Approximately 10 nmol of pre-annealed<br>
siRNA, at a concentration of 100 uM, was added to the 25% plasma and incubated at 37 °C for 0,<br>
15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, 240, 360, and 420 minutes. Aliquots were removed at the indicated<br>
time, treated with EDTA to a final concentration of 2 mM, and placed on ice at 0 °C until<br>
analyzed by capillary gel electrophoresis (Beckman P/ACE MDQ-UV with eCap DNA Capillary<br><br>
tube). The area of the siRNA duplex peak was measured and used to calculate the percent of<br>
intact siRNA remaining. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was added at a concentration of 2.5 mM<br>
to each injection as an internal calibration standard. A zero time point was taken by diluting<br>
siRNA in phosphate buffered saline followed by capillary electrophoresis. Percent intact siRNA<br>
was plotted against time, allowing the calculation of a pseudo first-order half-life. Results are<br>
shown in Table 18.<br><br>
ISIS 353538, the antisense strand contains 4' thio modifications at positions 3, 8, 11, 17-19 and<br>
is paired with a sense RNA strand which is unmodified.<br>
ISIS 355713, the antisense strand contains alternating 2'0methy/2'F modifications to the sugar<br>
and is paired with a sense strand having alternating 2'F/2'Omethyl modifications. The alternate<br>
modifications are in opposing register with the antisense strand being modified with 2'Ome at<br>
position 1 while the sense strand is modified with 2'F at position 1. It is evident that the<br>
alternating 2'-O-methyl/2'-fluoro construct remains relatively unchanged and is stable in serum.<br>
