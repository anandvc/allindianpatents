				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the<br>
preparation of highly pure crystals of zonisamide (chemical<br>
name: 1,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide) , i.e., 1,2-<br>
dichloroethane-free crystals of zonisamide, which is useful<br>
as an antiepileptic agent. More particularly, the present<br>
invention relates to a process for efficiently preparing<br>
crystals of zonisamide containing residual 1,2-dichloro-<br>
ethane of not more than 5 ppm, and the 1,2-dichloroethanefree<br>
crystals of zonisamide thus obtained.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Zonisamide has widely been used as an antiepileptic<br>
agent in many countries such as Japan, the United States.<br>
Zonisamide and processes for the preparation thereof are<br>
disclosed in JP-A-53-77057, USP 4,172,896 and JP-A-54-<br>
163823. In addition, Yakugaku-Zasshi, vol. 116, p. 533-547<br>
(1996) discloses t"hst ?.onisamid° h?is actual"! v been rrorri"ed<br>
using as an intermediate 1,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonyl<br>
chloride, which is obtained by sulfonation and<br>
decarboxylation of 1,2-benzisoxazol-3-acetic acid. Further,<br>
the solvent for the above sulfonation and decarboxylation<br>
is dichloromethane in the process disclosed in Yakugaku-<br>
Zasshi, vol. 116, p. 533-547 (1996), and 1,2-dichloroethane<br>
in the process disclosed in JP-A-53-77057.<br>
The solvent used in the preparation of a drug<br>
substance cannot completely be removed by practical<br>
manufacturing techniques, which are in actuality employed<br>
in the production. Therefore, in the preparation of drug<br>
substance wherein plural steps are serially carried out<br>
till the final step, each solvent used in each step may<br>
remain in a residual amount in the drug substance. Further,<br>
residual solvents in the drug substance usually cannot be<br>
useful for the therapeutic benefits of the drug substance,<br>
and contrarily, there may be caused a problem of safety of<br>
a patient according to the kinds of residual solvents and a<br>
concentration thereof. In terms of improving and<br>
increasing the safety of drugs, "IMPURITIES: GUIDELINE FOR •<br>
RESIDUAL SOLVENTS", ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline, 17<br>
July 1997 was made in INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON<br>
HARMONISATION OF TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR REGISTRATION OF<br>
PHARMACEUTICALS FOR HUMAN USE (ICH).<br>
Since a solvent may play an important role in<br>
increasing the yield rate or in determination of physical<br>
properties of drug substance such as crystal form, purity,<br>
solubility, etc., even if such a solvent is known to be<br>
toxic, there may be many cases that the use thereof in the<br>
preparation of drug substance cannot be avoided in terms of<br>
risk-benefits. In such cases, this guideline decrees that<br>
a concentration of a residual solvent in the drug substance<br>
should be not more than a limit which is toxicologically<br>
acceptable.<br>
A solvent for the preparation of the intermediate for<br>
zonisamide, 1,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonyl chloride,<br>
is 1,2-dichloroethane rather than dichloromethane. That is<br>
because, during the decarboxylation, which is carried out<br>
after the sulfonation of 1,2-benzisoxazole-3-acetic acid,<br>
the reaction mixture requires to be heated at about 60°C,<br>
which is higher than the boiling point of dichloromethane.<br>
In addition, 1,2-dichloroethane can be used as well in the<br>
step of preparation of zonisamide by reacting 1,2-benzisoxazole-<br>
3-methanesulfonyl chloride with ammonia. However,<br>
when zonisamide is prepared using 1,2-dichloroethane, the<br>
residual concentration thereof should be not more than 5<br>
ppm as defined in the above-mentioned guideline<br>
"IMPURITIES: GUIDELINE FOR RESIDUAL SOLVENTS". This<br>
guideline is not applied to the drugs, which are already on<br>
market, but it is very important to prepare a drug<br>
substance complying with this guideline in terms of safety<br>
of drugs.<br>
The removal of a residual solvent is usually carried<br>
out by drying. However, it is very difficult to completely<br>
remove an occluded solvent by a drying method being<br>
actually employed in the' production. USP 4,533,746<br>
discloses a method of removing the solvent by distillation<br>
in purification of bisphenols, wherein the solvent occluded<br>
in bisphenols is released and removed from bisphenol melted<br>
in water. This method utilizes the characteristic of<br>
bisphenol, which melts in water by heating, and thereby the<br>
occluded solvent is released. On the other hand,<br>
zonisamide cannot melt even by heating in water, and hence,<br>
this method cannot be applied for removal of the solvent<br>
occluded in crystals of zonisamide.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The present inventors have intensively studied a<br>
process for the preparation of crystals of zonisamide<br>
having a high safety and complying with the above-mentioned<br>
guideline, and have found that the desired crystals of<br>
zonisamide containing residual 1,2-dichloroethane of not<br>
more than 5 ppm can easily be obtained even from crystals<br>
of zonisamide containing 1, 2-dichloroethane in a high<br>
concentration, by using an aqueous C2_4 alcohol, i.e., by<br>
the steps of adding an aqueous C2_4 alcohol to said crystals<br>
and distilling the resulting mixture, followed by<br>
crystallization, without equipping any additional apparatus<br>
to existing ones, or without repetition of recrystallization,<br>

The materials used in the present invention and the<br>
conditions and steps in the process of the present<br>
invention are explained in more detail below.<br>
The "crystals of zonisamide containing residual 1,2-<br>
dichloroethane of more than 5 ppm" (hereinafter,<br>
occasionally referred to as "starting crystals of<br>
zonisamide") mean crystals of zonisamide containing<br>
residual 1,2-dichloroethane in the range of more than 5 ppm<br>
to 200000 ppm, although the higher limit of the<br>
concentration of said 1,2-dichloroethane is not necessarily<br>
specified. In general, "crystals of zonisamide containing<br>
residual 1,2-dichloroethane of more than 5 ppm" are<br>
crystals of zonisamide containing residual 1,2-dichloroethane<br>
in the range of 8 ppm to 150000 ppm.<br>
The "aqueous C2_4 alcohol" means a mixture of water and<br>
a C2.4 alcohol, and the "C2_
ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, and 2-butanol. The<br>
"aqueous C2.4 alcohol" is preferably aqueous ethanol,<br>
aqueous propanol, or aqueous isopropanol, among them<br>
aqueous isopropanol is most preferable.<br>
The step of removing 1,2-dichloroethane by azeotropic<br>
distillation is usually carried out subsequently to the<br>
step of dissolving the starting crystals of zonisamide in<br>
an aqueous C2H alcohol. The temperature for dissolving the<br>
starting crystals of zonisamide is not necessarily<br>
specified, but it is usually in the range of from 30°C to a<br>
boiling point of the C2.4 alcohol to be used.<br>
The starting crystals of zonisamide are mixed with an<br>
aqueous C,.4 alcohol in an amount of 5 to 15 parts by volume<br>
per 1 part by weight of the starting crystals of zonisamide.<br>
In other words, 1 g of dry weight of zonisamide is mixed<br>
with 5 to 15 ml of an aqueous C2.4 alcohol. The starting<br>
crystals of zonisamide are preferably mixed with an aqueous<br>
C2_4 alcohol in an amount of 5.2 to 10.4 parts by volume per<br>
1 part by weight of the starting crystals of zonisamide.<br>
Preferable aqueous C2_4 alcohol is usually a C2_4<br>
alcohol containing water in 35 to 65 % by volume, and more<br>
preferable one is a C2_4 alcohol containing water in 40 to<br>
60 % by volume, and further preferable one is a C2_4 alcohol<br>
containing water in 45 to 55 % by volume. In the present<br>
specification, for example, the 55 % by volume aqueous C2H<br>
alcohol means a mixture of water in 55 parts by volume and<br>
a C2_4 alcohol in 45 parts by volume.<br>
The distillation may be carried out either under<br>
atmospheric pressure or under reduced pressure, but<br>
preferably is carried out under atmospheric pressure. The<br>
temperature at which the distillation is started is usually<br>
an azeotropic point of 1,2-dichloroethane-an C2_4 alcoholwater.<br>
For example, the azeotropic point of 1,2-dichloroethane-<br>
ethanol-water is 66.7°C, and the azeotropic point of<br>
1,2-dichloroethane-isopropanol-water is 69.7°C, but these<br>
azeotropic points may vary under the influences of<br>
barometric pressure when the distillation is carried out or<br>
of molar elevation of boiling point, etc. The temperature<br>
at which the distillation is stopped may vary according to<br>
the kinds of the aqueous C2.4 alcohol to be used, and it is<br>
usually in the range of from 78°C to 100°C, preferably in<br>
the range of from 85°C to 100°C, and more preferably in the<br>
range of 90°C to 100°C.<br>
After the distillation is stopped, the residual<br>
mixture is cooled in situ to precipitate crystals of<br>
zonisamide containing residual 1,2-dichloroethane of not<br>
more than 5 ppm. In addition, crystals of zonisamide may<br>
be precipitated in the middle of the distillation procedure.<br>
Therefore, in cases that crystals are precipitated in the<br>
residual mixture after the distillation is stopped, the<br>
same C2.t alcohol as that to be used in the distillation<br>
procedure and/or water are added to the residual mixture<br>
after the distillation is stopped, and the resulting<br>
mixture is heated again to dissolve the crystals, and then<br>
cooled to precipitate crystals of zonisamide containing<br>
residual 1,2-dichloroethane of not more than 5 ppm. For<br>
instance, when an aqueous isopropanol is used in the<br>
distillation procedure, water and/or isopropanol are added<br>
to the residual mixture after the distillation in such an<br>
amount that the ratio of water and isopropanol in the<br>
residual mixture after the distillation becomes in the<br>
range of 35:65 to 65:35, preferably in the range of 40:60<br>
to 60:40, more preferably in the range of 45:55 to 55:45,<br>
and the total volume of water and isopropanol becomes 2 to<br>
20 parts by volume, preferably 8 to 14 parts by volume, per<br>
1 part by weight of the starting crystals (in dry state) of<br>
zonisamide, and the resulting mixture is heated again and<br>
then cooled. This step is preferably carried out together<br>
with the purification using activated carbon.<br>
The crystallized zonisamide is collected by filtration<br>
and dried by a conventional method to give crystals of<br>
zonisamide containing residual 1,2-dichloroethane of not<br>
more than 5 ppm, and in many cases, there are obtained<br>
crystals of zonisamide containing residual 1,2-dichloroethane<br>
of less than detection limit. The crystals of<br>
zonisamide to be collected by filtration are dried at a<br>
temperature of from 60 to 100°C, preferably at a<br>
temperature of from 70 to 90°C, for 8 to 24 hours,<br>
preferably for 12 to 18 hours. Vacuum drying is more<br>
preferable.<br>
The starting crystals of zonisamide to be used in the<br>
present process may be prepared according to the method<br>
disclosed in Reference Example 3 and Example 1 of JP-A-53-<br>
77057, except for the solvent, which is the one used in<br>
Example 1. That is, it is prepared by reacting 1,2-benzisoxazole-<br>
3-methanesulfonyl chloride with ammonia in 1,2-<br>
dichloroethane as a solvent, concentrating the reaction<br>
mixture, adding water to the resulting residue, followed by<br>
collecting the precipitated crystals to give wet crystals<br>
containing zonisamide in an amount of about 85 % by weight.<br>
The wet crystals containing zonisamide in an amount of<br>
about 85 % by weight obtained in the above process are<br>
recrystallized from 50 % aqueous isopropanol in usual<br>
manner, and the resulting crystals are dried under reduced<br>
pressure at a temperature of from 40 to 80°C for 18 hours<br>
to give crystals of zonisamide containing residual 1,2--<br>
dichloroethane in a concentration of from 8 to 14 ppm.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is illustrated in more detail by<br>
the following Examples, but the present invention should<br>
not be construed to be limited thereto. The content of<br>
1,2-dichloroethane in crystals of zonisamide was measured<br>
by gas chromatography.<br>
Example 1<br>
To wet crystals (60 g) containing zonisamide in an<br>
amount of about 85 % by weight prepared by using 1, 2--<br>
dichloroethane in the method disclosed in Reference Example<br>
3 and Example 1 of JP-A-53-77057 was added 50 vol % aqueous<br>
isopropanol (500 ml), and 320 ml of the solvent was removed<br>
by evaporation at a temperature of from 76 to 100°C under<br>
stirring. To the residual mixture were added water (10 ml),<br>
isopropanol (200 ml) and activated carbon (8 g), and the<br>
mixture was dissolved with heating. The activated carbon<br>
was separated by filtration, and washed with 50 % aqueous<br>
isopropanol (80 ml). The filtrate and the washing were<br>
combined and cooled. The precipitated crystals were<br>
collected by filtration, washed with water (100 ml), and<br>
dried at 80°C for 16 hours to give crystals of zonisamide<br>
(48.5 g) . The content of 1,2-dichloroethane in the<br>
crystals was less than 1 ppm (less than detection limit).<br>
Examples 2-3<br>
The same procedures as Example 1 were repeated except<br>
that the water content in the aqueous isopropanol and the<br>
amount of the aqueous isopropanol were changed. The<br>
results are shown in Table 1.<br>
Example 4<br>
To the same wet crystals (60 g) containing zonisamide<br>
in an amount of about 85 % by weight as used in Example 1<br>
were added 50 vol % aqueous isopropanol (300 ml), water<br>
(7.5 ml) and I,2-dichloroethane (8.8 g), and 210 ml of the<br>
solvent was removed by evaporation at a temperature of from<br>
79 to 100°C under stirring. The residual mixture was<br>
cooled, and the precipitated crystals were collected by<br>
filtration to give wet crystals of zonisamide (56.7 g).<br>
The content of 1,2-dichloroethane in the wet crystals of<br>
zonisamide was less than 1 ppm (less than detection limit).<br>
The wet crystals were dried at 80°C for 16 hours to give<br>
dried crystals of zonisamide (49.9 g) .<br>
Examp1p 5<br>
To the dried crystals of zonisamide (50.0 g) was added<br>
55 vol % aqueous isopropanol (260 ml), and thereto were<br>
further added 1,2-dichloroethane (7.5 g) and water (7.5 g),<br>
and the mixture was stirred at a stirring velocity of 220<br>
rpm. Then, the mixture was heated until the inner<br>
temperature thereof became 100°C, and 160 ml of the solvent<br>
was removed by evaporation. The residual mixture was<br>
cooled, and thereto were added water (145 ml), isopropanol<br>
(230 ml) and activated carbon (9.1 g), and the mixture was<br>
heated at a temperature of from 80 to 83°C for one hour.<br>
The activated carbon was separated by filtration, and<br>
washed with 50 % aqueous isopropanol (175 ml). The<br>
filtrate and the washing were combined and cooled. After<br>
cooled to about 8°C, the precipitated crystals were<br>
collected by filtration and washed with water (136 ml).<br>
The crystals were dried with air blowing at 100°C for 16<br>
hours to give the dried crystals of zonisamide (47.1 g) .<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
By conventional methods for recrystallization,<br>
crystals of zonisamide containing residual 1,2-dichloroethane<br>
of not more than 5 ppm could not be obtained from<br>
the starting crystals of zonisamide prepared using 1,2-<br>
dichloroethane. On the contrary, the content of the<br>
residual 1,2-dichloroethane in the crystals of zonisamide<br>
prepared by the Examples of the present process is less<br>
than 1 ppm (less than detection limit), which is far lower<br>
than required 5 ppm. As shown in Example 4, the present<br>
process is effective and applicable even if there is a<br>
large residual amount of 1,2-dichloroethane in the starting<br>
crystals of zonisamide. In addition, as shown in Example 5,<br>
the yield of crystals of zonisamide is not so reduced even<br>
by subjecting them to the present process.<br>
As explained in the above, according to the method of<br>
the present invention, crystals of zonisamide containing<br>
residual 1,2-dichloroethane of not more than 5 ppm can<br>

zonisamide prepared using 1,2-dichloroethane as the solvent.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A process for the preparation of crystals of zonisamide of chemical name 1, 2-<br>
benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide containing residual 1,2 dichloroethane of not more than 5 ppm, which comprises adding an aqueous C2-4 alcohol to crystals of zonisamide containing residual 11,2-dichloroethane of more than 5 ppm, removing said 1,2-dichloroethane by azeotropic distillation to obtain a residual mixture, followed by cooling and collecting the precipitated crystals of zonisamide containing not more than 5 ppm of 1 ,2-dichloroethane from the residual mixture.<br>
2.	A process for the preparation of crystals of zonisamide containing residual 1,2-<br>
dichloroethane of not more than 5 ppm as claimed in claiml, which comprises the following steps<br>
(a),(b)(c)axi(d)<br>
(a)	dissolving crystals of zonisamide containing residual 1,2 dichloroethane of more<br>
than 5 ppm in an aqueous C2-4 alcohol, and subjecting the resultant mixture to azeotropic<br>
distillation;<br>
(b)	stopping the distillation after the azeotropic distillation of said 1 ^-dichloroethane<br>
is completed to obtain a residual mixture;<br>
(c)    cooling the residual mixture to precipitate crystals of zonisamide containing not more than 5 ppm of 1,2-dichloroethane; and<br>
(d) collecting the precipitated crystals of zonisamide by filtration and drying thereof.<br>
3.	A process for the preparation of crystals of zonisamide containing<br>
residual 1,2-dichloroethane of not more than 5 ppm as claimed in claiml, which<br>
comprises the following steps (a), (b), (cl) and (dl):<br>
(a)	dissolving crystals of zonisamide containing residual 1,2-dichloroethane of more than 5 ppm in an aqueous C2-4 alcohol, and subjecting the resultant mixture to azeotropic distillation;<br>
(b)	stopping the distillation after the azeotropic distillation of said 1,2-dichloroethane is completed to obtain a residual mixture;<br>
(cl) adding the same C2-4 alcohol as used in the step (a) and/or water to the residual mixture obtained in the step (b), dissolving the residual mixture with heating, and cooling thereof to precipitate crystals of zonisamide containing not more than 5 ppm of 1,2-dichloroethane; and<br><br><br>
(dl)      collecting the precipitated crystals of zonisamide by filtration and drying thereof.<br>
4.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the aqueous C2-4 alcohol is<br>
an aqueous isopropanol.<br>
5.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the aqueous C2-4 alcohol is isopropanol containing water in an amount of 35 to 65 % by volume.<br>
6.	The      process      as      claimed      in      claim      2,      wherein      the temperature at which the distillation is stopped is in the range of from 78°C to 100°C.<br><br><br></td>
