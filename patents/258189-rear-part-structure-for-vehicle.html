				<td>[Detailed Description of the Invention] [0001] [Technical Field to which the Invention Pertains]<br>
This invention relates to a rear part structure for a vehicle which is improved in seatability of a rider and loadability of a baggage, facilitates gripping of a rear grip by a hand and is improved in appearance of a rear part of a vehicle body.  Further, where a clear lens is used for a lens of a winker, the observability of the winker is assured while the appearance of a rear part of a vehicle body is improved. [0002] [Prior Art]<br>
As another rear part structure for a vehicle, a rear part structure disclosed, for example, in the official gazette of Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 6-247361 "Motorcycle" is known.<br>
In FIGS. 2 and 3 of the official gazette mentioned, a rear part structure is shown wherein a rear grip 34 serving also as a carrier 32 is attached to a vehicle body cover 27 rearwardly of a driver seat 30 (those<br><br>
reference numerals which are used in the official gazette mentioned above are used here. This similarly applies to the following description).<br>
[0003]<br>
As another rear part structure for a vehicle, a rear part structure disclosed, for example, in the official gazette of Japanese Patent Publication No. Hei 7-90812 "Lamp Apparatus for a Motorcycle" is known.<br>
In FIGS. 1 and 3 of the official gazette mentioned above, a motorcycle is shown wherein flasher lamps 10, 10 are provided leftwardly and rightwardly on a rear part of a vehicle body and openings 22, 22 are provided in a side cover 19 sidewardly of bulbs 13, 13 provided in the flasher lamps 10, 10 and flasher lamp lenses 15, 15 which cover the bulbs 13, 13 such that they overlap partly with the bulbs 13, 13 as viewed in side elevation (those reference numerals which are used in the official gazette mentioned above are used here. This similarly applies to the following description).<br>
[0004]<br>
[Problems to Be Solved by the Invention]<br>
The driver seat 3 0 described above preferably has a seat face of a greater area for the sake of the seatability of a rider or the loadability of a baggage.<br>
However, if the width of the driver seat 3 0 is increased in order to increase the area of the seat face of the driver seat 30, then the width of the vehicle is increased, but if the overall length of the driver seat 30 is increased, then the balance of the driver seat 30 with the other surrounding parts and so forth is lost and the appearance of the rear part of the vehicle body is deteriorated.<br>
Further, since the rear grip 34 described above is positioned just rearwardly of the fellow passenger, the fellow passenger cannot grip the rear grip 34 readily. [0005]<br>
Therefore, it is a first object of the present invention to improve a rear part structure for a vehicle to improve the seatability of a rider and the loadability of a baggage, facilitate gripping of a rear grip by a hand and improve the appearance of the rear part of the vehicle body. [0006]<br>
On the other hand, for example, where the flasher lamps 15 are formed as clear lenses, the bulbs 13 cannot be observed fully from the outside. However, since the area of the openings 22 becomes small and the light amount decreases, it is desired to improve the<br><br>
observability of the flasher lamps 10 as viewed from sidewardly of the motorcycle. Further, the side faces of the rear part of the vehicle body in which the rectangular openings 22 are formed are poor in accent and lack in the charm in terms of the appearance.<br>
[0007]<br>
Therefore, it is a second object of the present invention to improve a rear part structure for a vehicle to assure, where a clear lens is used for a lens of a winker, the observability of the winker while improving the appearance of the rear part of the vehicle body.<br>
[0008]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to attain the first object described above, according to claim 1, a rear part structure for a vehicle is characterized in that a rear portion of a tandem seat is extended rearwardly in a triangular shape as viewed in plan view, and a grip for a fellow passenger disposed rearwardly of the tandem seat is formed in a triangular shape substantially same as the shape of the rear portion of the tandem seat.<br>
[0009]<br>
Since the rear portion of the tandem seat is projected rearwardly in a triangular shape as viewed in<br><br>
plan view, the area of the rear portion of the tandem seat can be increased, and it can seat readily and a baggage can be loaded readily on the rear portion of the tandem seat. Further, since the grip for a fellow passenger is formed in a triangular shape substantially similar to the shape of the rear portion of the tandem seat, the two sides of the grip of the triangular shape are positioned sidewardly of the fellow passenger, and therefore, the fellow passenger can grip the sides of the grip readily with the hands.  Further, the feeling of unity in design of the rear portion of the tandem seat and the grip increases, and the appearance of the rear part of the vehicle body can be improved. [0010]<br>
According to claim 2, the rear part structure for a vehicle is characterized in that a tail lamp unit is attached to a vehicle body below the grip, and also a rear end edge of the tail lamp unit is formed in a triangular shape substantially same as the shape of the rear portion of the tandem seat.<br>
Unity in design of the rear portion of the tandem seat and the grip as well as the rear end edge of the tail lamp unit is further improved, and the charm of the commodity can be augmented.<br><br>
[0011]<br>
According to claim 3, the rear part structure for a vehicle is characterized in that a stop lamp is provided at the center of the tail lamp unit, and a rear end edge of an upper face of a lens of the stop lamp is formed in such a shape that the width thereof decreases rearwardly.<br>
The shape of the upper face rear end edge of the lens of the stop lamp and the shape of the grip can be made similar to each other, and the design of the rear part of the vehicle body can be emphasized. [0012]<br>
According to claim 4, the rear part structure for a vehicle is characterized in that the opposite side edges of a rear face of the lens of the stop lamp is formed in such a manner as to have a width increasing downwardly.<br>
In addition to the emphasis of the design of the rear part of the vehicle body by the similarity of the shape of the upper face rear end edge of the lens of the stop lamp and the shape of the grip, the area of the face of the lens of the stop lamp as viewed in rear elevation can be secured. [0013]<br>
According to claim 5, the rear part structure for a vehicle according is characterized in that a seat face of<br>
the rear portion of the tandem seat and an upper face of a rear portion of the grip are positioned at a substantially same height.<br>
Since the seat face of the rear portion of the tandem seat and the rear portion upper face of the grip are positioned at a substantially equal height, it is advantageous when a baggage such as an elongated baggage is carried such that it extends between the rear portion of the tandem seat and the grip. [0014]<br>
In order to attain the second object described above, according to claim 6, a rear part structure for a vehicle wherein a stop lamp and a pair of winkers disposed on the opposite sides of the stop lamp are provided rearwardly of a body cover is characterized in that an extension of the body cover is formed in such a manner as to overlap with bulbs of the winkers, each of which includes a clear lens, as viewed in side elevation, and a rear edge of the extension is projected rearwardly upwards in a substantially V-shape as viewed in side elevation. [0015]<br>
The bulbs of the winkers which include the clear lenses can be prevented from being observed fully by the<br>
extension of the body cover, and besides the appearance of the rear part of the vehicle body can be augmented by the V-shaped rear edge of the extension. Further, the bulbs of the winkers are not covered completely by the extension, and the opposite sides of the V-shape assure lens faces of the winkers. Therefore, the observability of the winkers can be assured.<br>
[0016]<br>
According to claim 7, the rear part structure for a vehicle is characterized in that rear end edges of the lenses of the winkers are projected rearwardly upwards in a substantially in a V-shape as viewed in side elevation.<br>
Since the rear end edges of the lenses of the winkers are projected rearwardly upwards in a substantially V-shape as viewed in side elevation, together with the fact that the extension of the body cover is formed in a V-shape, the design of the V-shape of the lenses can appeal strongly, and the charm of the commodity can be augmented.<br>
[0017]<br>
According to claim 8, the rear part structure for a vehicle is characterized in that a rear end edge of a lens of the stop lamp is projected rearwardly upwards in a substantially V-shape as viewed in side elevation.<br><br>
[0018]<br>
Since the lens of the stop lamp is projected rearwardly upwards in a substantially V-shape as viewed in side elevation, the design of the V-shaped lens of the stop lamp can be made strongly appealing and unified together with the V-shaped extension of the body cover and the V-shaped lenses of the winkers, and the charm of the commodity can be augmented.<br>
[0019]<br>
