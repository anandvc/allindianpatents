				<td>A LIFTING DEVICE FOR USE IN CYLINDRICAL PLASATfCS WEAVING MACHINE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved lifting device for use in a cylindrical plastics weaving machine for producing flexible plastic polymer articles. It is equipped with a lifting rod, a sprocket wheel driven in synchronism by the main machine and a driving gear mounted coaxially with the sprocket wheel. The driving gear is engaged with a driven gear, which is coupled to a lifting rod by way of a stageless decelerating regulator. Between the coaxial sprocket wheel and the driving gear is disposed a clutch whose control unit is connected to a broken weft yarn detector of the cylindrical plastics weaving machine. The simple and delicate design of the present invention adopting a stageless decelerating regulator makes the stageless adjustment of the weft yarn density possible. In particular, the variation of the width of a batch of weft yarns can be made either manually or electronically by precisely adjusting the density of weft yarns on the cylindrical weaving machine so as to completely solve the problem of the overlapping and looseness of weft yarns in weaving. By means of the broken weft yarn detector of the main machine and the synchronic disengagement of the lifting device, the problem of "empty weft yarn" can be avoided so as to advance the quality of the products and lower the defective rate of the same. It is advantageous for wide application in plastic weaving industry.<br>
At present, plastic woven bags are produced by cylindrical plastics weaving machine that weaves weft yarns and warp yarns into fabric and on the spinning of the main machine, the lifting device will continuously lift up the finished<br><br>
portion of a woven bag little by little so as to complete the weaving of a bag automatically.<br>
The lifting devices in current use is equipped with a lifting rod and a sprocket wheel driven in synchronism with the main machine. A driving gear mounted co-axially with the sprocket wheel is in mesh with a driven gear, which is associated with the lifting rod by way of a decelerating transmission of a staged weft yarn density control gear set. Such a transmission is fixed and is not easy for adjustment. For each increase adjustment of the density of weft yarns, a weft yarn density control wheel must be replaced and the problem is that it can't be precisely adjusted according to the practical need in particular. When the width of weft yarns batch is various, it will encounter problems of overlapped weft yarns or loosely woven weft yarns, resulting in the inconvenience in practical use and poor quality of products.<br>
Moreover, to solve the problem of "empty weft yarns'^ and avoid defective waste of products, the conventional cylindrical weaving machine has been equipped with a broken weft yarn detector. Once the weft yarns are broken or the running out of the yarns on the spools, the broken weft yarn detector will detect the same and stop the main machine right away whereby the empty weft yarns problem can be somehow dissolved. However, as a result of the inertia of motion, even the main machine is already stopped, a certain kind of movement is still undergoing, the lifting rod actuated by the sprocket wheel driven in synchronism with the main machine will continue lifting the woven fabric up along with the motion. Thus, the problem of broken weft yarns still can't be effectively solved.<br><br>
The present invention aims to solve the previously described technical problem by providing for an improved lifting device for cylindrical plastics weaving machine which can perform stagcless adjustment of the weft yarn density and avoid the happenings of overlapping of weft yarns or loose weft yarns; and make the adjustment easy and assure the quality of products.<br>
The lifting device of the cylindrical plastics weaving machine of the present invention is equipped with a lifting rod and a sprocket wheel, and a driving gear co-axially mounted with the sprocket wheel and engaged with a driven gear which is coupled to the lifting rod by way of a stagetess decelerating regulator.<br>
The use of the stageless decelerating regulator permits the stageless adjustment of the weft yarn density with facility and ease according to the practical need, especially for the batches with various weft yarn width, it can perform the adjustment of the weft yarn density with precision whereby the overlapping and looseness of the weft yarns in production can be completely overcome, resulting in the advance of quality of products and promotion of industrial production.<br>
The use of a clutch between the co-axially mounted sprocket wheel and the driving gear enables the control unit of the clutch to be in connection with the broken weft yarn detector. Once broken weft yarn or the running out of the weft yarns on the spool is detected, the control unit of the clutch is actuated to get the sprocket wheel and the driving gear separated at the same time when the main machine is stopped by the weft yarn detector whereby the lifting device is cut off power to further lift up so as to solve the problem of '*empty weft yarn" in operation.<br><br>
The simply structured and easily operable clutch is made up of a diameter varying shaft, the driving geai' with a diameter varying shaft hole, a bead-provided collar and beads. The beads are housed in the receiving holes of beads. The diameter of the beads is larger than the thickness of the collar and the diameter varying shaft and the beads is in match with the diameter varying shaft hole of the driving gear to make the separation of power possible*<br>
The shaft is designed to have varied diameters in the axial direction and has an upper section and a lower section; the diameter of the former is larger than that of the latter. The diameter of the diameter variable shaft hole of the driving gear is variable in the radial direction. The large diameter of the shaft hole is engaged with the protruded beads of the shaft collar. At the moment, the beads serve as the key of the shaft. The bead number can be one or multiple, for instance, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The structure is simple and adopts axial control and is operated with readiness.<br>
The control means of the clutch is designed to connect to a control rod of the upper section of the diameter varying shaft and the other end of the control rod is coupled to an electrical drawing magnet of the broken weft yarn detector. I he electrical drawing magnet is operated according to the instructions from the broken weft yarn detector so as to control the engagement and disengagement of the clutch whereby the lifting device is assured not to be in operation once a broken weft yarn is detected. Thus the problem of "empty weft yarn" can be<br>
solved.<br>
To assure the retraction of the diameter varying shaft in operation, a bias spring is disposed at the lower section of the diameter varying shaft.<br><br>
In the present invention some corresponding auxiliary parts, such as support frames, support parts, bearings, keys, connection parts and etc. can be additionally adopted. As to the control unit of the broken weft yarn detector, electrical drawing magnet, the ways of support and connection, they are well known arts and have been widely applied in the industry, so they are directly adopted in the present invention without the necessity of making detailed description at all.<br>
SLMMARY OF THE iNVENTIOIN<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to provide an improved lifting device for use in a cylindrical plastics weaving machine which is simple in structure and delicate in design wherein a stageless decelerating regulator enables the stageless adjustment of the weft yarn density to be performed with ease in practical operation. Besides, especially for different batches of weft yarn width in weaving, the weft yarn density can be precisely adjusted with ease so as to overcome the problem of overlapping or looseness of weft yarns. Moreover, the "empty weft yarn" problem can be solved by use of the control unit of the broken weft yarn detector and the synchronic separation by clutch of the sprocket wheel and the driving gear so as to make the lifting device stop lifting immediately. Thereby the quality of the woven products can be improved with the rate of defective waste effectively minimized.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRWVLNGS<br><br>
Fig. 1 is a diagram showing the assembly of the cylindrical plastics weaving machine with a lifting device of the present invention-Fig. 2 is an enlarged diagram showing the section A of Fig. 1. Fig. 3 is a diagram showing the driving gear of the present invention.<br>
DET/ULED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring to Figs.l, 2 and 3, the lifting device of a cylindrical plastics weaving machine is equipped with a lifting rod 1, a sprocket wheel 15 driven in synchronism with a main machine, a driving gear 7 co-axially mounted Avith the sprocket wheel 15. The driving gear 7 is engaged with a driven gear 6, which is coupled to the lifting rod I by way of a stageless decelerating regulator 3. On the stageless decelerating regulator 3 is disposed a manual adjustment knob 4 which can be replaced by a micro electrical regulator. The cylindrical plastics weaving machine can be manually or electrically adjusted to vary the weaving density of the weft yarns of the weaving fabric.<br>
Between the driving gear 7 and the sprocket wheel 15 is disposed a clutch which is made up of a diameter varying shaft 10, the driving gear 7 with a diameter variable shaft hole, a collar 11 having a bead receiving holes 14 and beads 12. The beads 12 are housed in the bead receiving holes 14. The diameter varying shaft 10 is variable of its diameter in its axial direction and has an upper section and a lower section with the diameter of the former larger than that of the latter. The diameter of the beads 12 is larger than the thickness of the collar 11. The diameter variable shaft hole of the driving gear 7 is varied in the radial direction wherein the large diameter section is engaged with the protruded beads<br><br>
12	of the collar II. The control rod 16 eifecting the diameter varying operation of the clutch is associated with the upper section of the diameter varying shaft 10. The other end of the control rod 16 is connected to the electric drawing magnet<br>
13	of the broken weft yarn detector. I he lower section of the diameter varying shaft 10 is disposed a bias spring 9 to make the retraction of shaft possible.<br>
In practical operation, by means of the stageless decelerating regulator 3, the operation status is alleviated to put the weft density regulation into practice. Such adjustments can be done with precision, facility and speed. In a normal status, the sprocket wheel 15 synchronically driven by the main machine drives the driving gear 7 to spin. The lifting rod 1 is rotated to complete the lifting movement by way of the driven gear 6 in mesh with the driving gear 7 and the stageless decelerating regulator 3 sequentially, in case of a broken yarn or the running out of yarns on a spool, on a broken yarn detector stopping the main machine, the electric drawing magnet 13 is actuated in synchronism to operate so as to lift up the diameter varying shaft 10 by way of the clutch control stick 16. At then, the small diameter shaft section of the diameter varying shaft 10 is in alignment with the beads 12, and the beads 12 in the collar 11 shift toward the side of the diameter varying shaft 10, the driving gear 7 disengaged from the collar 11 rotated together with the sprocket wheel 15 stops spinning. In other words, the sprocket wheel 15 separates from the driving gear 7 whereby the lifting rod 1 loses power to raise at the moment of the main machine stops operation. Thus an '"empty weft yarn" phenomena can be resolved.<br><br><br><br><br>
