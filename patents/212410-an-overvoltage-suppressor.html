TITLE OF THE INVENTION Overvoltage suppressor<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is J6ased on an overvoltage suppressor as claimed in the preamble of patent claim<br>
The invention in this case refers to a prior art as results from EP 0614 198 A2, ; Ari overvoltage suppressor Which is described in this prior art includes a plurality of cylindrical resistance elements having a varistor behavior which are arranged stacked one above the other in;the form of columns between two electrical connecting fittings, A clamping part, which holdg the varistors and the two connecting fittings together forming an axially acting contact force has at least two loops whose ehds rest on the conneecting fittings. A molded housing made of a weather-resistant plastic surrounds the varistors, the loops and the predominant part of the connecting fittings;<br>
The production of ; such ar overvoltage suppressor is relatively complex since two or even more loops are required to fix the suppressor active part, which is in the form of a column and contain^ the varistors and connecting fittings, and to produce the contact force.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, one object 6f the- i|ivention as it is specified in patent claim 1 is to provide an overvoltage suppressor: of the. type mentioned initially which, despite simple construction, is distinguished by good mechanical and electrical chiaracteristics and which can at the same time be produced in a particularly cost-effective mannerâ€¢<br><br>
In comparison with an overvoltage suppressor according to the prior art; thfe overvoltage suppressor according to the inventibn has the advantage that it requires only a single loop to fix and brace two connecting fittings and at least one varistor which is held between the fittings,' The overvoltage suppressor can thus be produced in a particularly economic manner. Only one prefabricated template/ which temporarily, ensures axial guidance, is required to assemble it, in which template the connecting fittings and the at least one varistor are initially stacked in the form of a column and are then connected; by fitting the loop, producing prestressing, to form the mechanically robust active part of the overvoltage suppressor. Since the axis of the active part, which is designed as a column, in this case passes essentially symmetriGally through the loop ends, the loop produces ^ uniform contact force in the entire active part. Thus, this ensures a uniform current density of a suppressor current which is carried in ^ the active part when an overvoltage occurs, and unacceptably high local heating of contact junctions in the. active part is thus avoided with a high level of confidence.<br>
A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily obtained as the same becomes better understood by reference to the followirig detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a side view of an embodiment of the overvoltage suppressor , according to the invention, in Which a molded housing, which is indicated by dashed lines, is illustrated in transparent form. Fig, 2 shows a plan view of a section along II-II through the overvoltage suppressor according to<br><br>
Fig. 1 but now illustrated in perspective form, after the removal of the molded housing, and Fig. 3 shows  an  exploded \  illustration  of  the overvoltage suppressor according to Fig.  1, , after the removal of the molded housing.<br>
Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, the overvoltage suppressor which is illustrated in Figures 1 to 3 has two connecting fittings 1, 2, which are preferably composed of aluminum and are spaced apart from one another along an axis z. The connecting fitting 1 is provided with a fastening device, which is designed as a threaded hole 11, for an electrical conductor which may be connected to high-voltage potential, but is not illustrated- The connecting fitting 2 may be connected to ground potential by a fastening device which is designed as a threaded hole 12, Said connecting fitting 2 has an axially aligned threaded hole 3 in which a pressure screw 4 is guided such that it can be displaced in the axial direction-' The designation 5 refers to a loop composed of a wound, glass-fiber-reinforced strip which is embedded in a plastic matrix. The two ends of the loop 5 are guided in sections, which are designed in the form of slots, of material cutouts 6, 7 - which are formed in the connecting fittings 1, 2.  <br>
A cylindrical varistor element ;8 composed of non-linear resistance material, for example based on metal oxide such as ZnO in particular, 'is arranged between the connecting fittings 1, 2 forming a suppressor active part in the form of a column. Alternatively, two or more varistor elements, which are stacked one above the other in the form of a column, may also be provided instead of, one element 8-.<br>
Electrically conductive parts, namely two spring elements 9, which produce contact pressure and<br><br>
are in each case designed as plate springs, and a thrust washer 10, which is preferably composed of aluminum, copper or an aluminum or copper alloy, are mounted such that they can be displaced in the axial direction in a cutout which is in the form of a disk and is formed in the connecting fitting 1 (Fig, 2), A thrust washer 13, which is composed ; of the same material as the part 10, is likewise mounted such that it can be displaced in the axial direction in a cutout, which is in the form of a disk, in the connecting fitting 2 (Fig. 2) . Current transmission elements 14 are arranged between the thrust washer 10 and the varistor element 8, and between the thrust washer 13 and the varistor element 8, and are in each case designed /as a disk with grooves Which pass concentrically around the axis and are formed in both end surfaces of the disk (Pisf. 3) . The current transmission elements 14 are advantageptlsly formed from annealed aluttiinutn-<br>
Fig, 2 shows that each of the sections which are marked by the designations IS, 16 arid are in the form of slots extend essentially transversely with respect to the axis z from the outer surface of the electrical connecting fitting 1 or 2, respectively, to beyond the' axis z. Each of the two ends of the loop 5 is inserted beyond the axis z into . the section 15 or 16, respectively, which is in the form of a slot, and in each case rests on a surface 17 or 18, respectively, which bounds the section 15 or 16, respectively, which is in the form of a slot (Fig. 3) . This ensures that the loop 5 is held centrally in the region of the axis z, and ensures a uniform contact pressure in the suppressor active part, This ensures a uniform current density of the suppressor current which is carried in the suppressor active part when an; oyervoltage occurs. At the same time, unacceptably high local heating in the suppressor active part is avoided.,<br>
Increased confidence  against displaceinent of the loop transversely with respect to the axis z is<br><br>
provided if the slots 15, 16 are inclined by somewhat more than 90Â°, for example by up to 95Â° with respect to .the axis, and/or if the slots 15, 16 have undercuts which fix the loop ends and can be formed in the contact surfaces 17, 18,<br>
The contact surfaces 17, 18 advantageously have a surface profile which is essentially in the form of a circular arcÂ» The loop/ ends then rest on the connecting fittings 1, 2 with a uniform, relatively slight curvature- This largely avoids undesirably high bending and shear stresses in the loops.<br>
A rectangular, in; particular square, cross-sectional profile of the loop 5 with a relatively narrow width transversely with respect to the axis 2 is particularly advantageous since the section 15 or 16, respectively, which is designed in the form of a slot, nded extend only insignificantly beyond the axis z. The connecting fitting 1 or 2 then has high mechanical strength.<br>
The connecting fittings 1, 2 are partially enclosed, and the varistor element 8, the thrust plates 10, 13 and the loop 5 are completely enclosed, by a molded housing 19 which is provided with shields and is made of insulating material, preferably of an elastomeric silicone (Fig. 10,<br>
In order to produce this pvervoltage suppressor,^ the connecting fitting 2, the thrust plate 13, one of the current transmission elements 14, the varistor element 8, a further current transmission element 14, the thrust plate 10, the two spring elements 9 and the connecting fitting 1 are stacked one above the other in sequence in a template, and are subjected to a prestressing force; The connecting fittings 1,2 are in this case aligned such that the two sections 15, 16, which are in the form of slots, are located one above the other such that they are superimposed (Figures 2 and 3), A prefabricated loop 5, which is preferably composed of a wound prepreg which is in, the form of 'a strip and has been cured after<br><br>
winding/ is then pushed so far into the slots 15, 16 that the axis z passes through: the loop ends. The prestressing force is then removed, and/the suppressor active part is thus complete/ Contact and retention force can additionally be produced in the suppressor active part by twisting the pifessure screw 4.<br>
Instead of a prefabricated loop, a loop can also be used which is formed during the production of the overvoltage suppressor. To this end, a strip which is subjected to a prestressing force is wound around the suppressor active part and is placed on the two contact surfaces 17, 18, In this case, the two connecting fittings 1, 2 are braced firmly to one another forming a contact force, arid a mechanically robust active part of the overvoltage suppressor to be produced is thus formed. This bracing is in general completely sufficient on its own for good mechanical strength of the suppressor active part. If a strip having adequate elasticity is used, such as a   strip<br>
manufactured from glass fibers for example, the spring<br>
â€¢  â–   â– <br>
elements 9 may thus possibly be omitted.<br>
Such a strip is preferably a prepreg, particularly: based on glass fibers and epoxy resin. A prepreg has a good adhesion effect. A loop which Is wound from a prestressed prepreg is thus robust even without any additional fastening device after winding, and can then be cured at elevated temperatures. A loop is then formed in this case which is composed of glass fibers and a cured plastic matrix in which the glass fibers are embedded.<br>
In addition to making good contact with the individual parts which are located in the current path between the two connecting fittings/the bracing of the two connecting fittings 1, 2 at the same time also results in the grooves of the current transmission elements 14 being closely joined at the end surfaces of the varistor element 8 and of the thrust washers 10, 13. If the suppressor active part is subsequently extrusion coated with insulating material, preferably<br><br>
based on an elastomeric silicone, this, avoids ingress of the liquid insulating material between the individual parts located in the current path.<br>
Obviously, numerous ' modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings- It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claimis, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein.<br><br>
