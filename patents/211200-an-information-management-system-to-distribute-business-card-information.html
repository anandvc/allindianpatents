Traditionally, a business card is used to give an information, That is, a personal information is recognized through the card and gives .information by means of the recognized information.  For instance, one uses a phone number on the received business card to call the provider of the card and send information by voice. Or one can send information by E-mail, the E-mail address being on the business card. Or one can send information by the SMS, the mobile phone number being on the business card.<br>
To make the business card available, it should be printed and delivered to the receiver physically and the receiver should keep storage of it for later use.  And, even when sending the same information to multiple business card providers, the information should be sent separately. For instance, one received business cards form three men of a, b and c, respectively and wants to send the same information to these three men via the SMS, he should input three mobile phone numbers of them,  the same three information and send them, respectively.<br>
Also, new business cards should be received again or the information on the business cards should be rewritten if the information of the provider are changed. For instance, the business card should be replaced with the newly received card or record to the change should be made<br>
on the card.<br>
Furthermore, there is a need to 'make an additional record with respect to the card provider. For instance, when a business card is provided in connection with a great deal, matters related to the deal should be recorded in relation to the provided business card.<br>
Therefore, it is desirable if one can distribute his or her personal information by use of one business card, easily keep storage of information and send information to multiple card providers at once.  Further, it is desirable if  renewal  of  information  is  easily made  when  the information of business card is changed and records to the information of business card provider is easily managed.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Now, the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 is a view showing the configuration of the present invention..<br>
Firstly, the information management system 10 includes a web server 110 connected to the Internet 20. Also, the information management system includes a database server 120 for managing information of business card. Further, the information management system 10 includes an information • transferring means 130 which transfers information.<br>
The information transferring means 130 may be a mail server for E-mail such as SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Server) server.<br>
The information transferring means 130 may be a SMS connection means provided in the web server 110.  That is, the web server 110 may connect to SMSC(SMS Center) 60 of a mobile telecommunication service company which provides SMS service to a separate mobile communication equipment by means of mobile telecommunication network and send short messages to the mobile communication equipment.  In this case, the web server is directly connected to the SMSC 60 or  indirectly  connected  to  the  SMSC  60  through  an intermediary SMS service agent.<br>
The information transferring means 130 may be a messenger provided in the web server 110. For instance, the commercialized MSN Messenger service is available.<br>
The information transferring means 130 may be a web server 130 itself and directly browse information into the mobile communication equipment or computer connected to it by means of the Internet 20.<br>
Users of the information management system 10 can access to the information management system 10 through mobile communication equipments 41a, 41b, • • •, 4 In or computers 3 la, • • •, 3 In. When users access to the information management system 10 by means of mobile communication equipments 41a, 41b, • • • , 41n, the mobile communication equipments are connected to the Internet 20 connected to the web server 110 of the information management system 10 via the mobile telecommunication network 50 and wap gateway 55.<br>
When users, access to the information management system<br>
10 by means of computers 31a, • • •, 3 In, the computers are connected to the Internet 20 which is connected with the web server 110 of the information management system 10.<br>
The mobile communication equipments 4 la, 41b, • • • , 4In and the computers 3la, • • • , 3In have a wap browser and a browser for the wired Internet, the browsers which request information transferring to the web server 110 of the information management system 10 and browse the transferred information from the web server 110.<br>
The database server 120 for managing information of business card in the information management system 10 include  a  business  card information database  121,  a relation database 122 and a user database 123.   The business card information database 121 stores individual . user's business card information inputted via the web server 110 from the mobile communication equipments 4la, 41b,  • • • ,  4 In or the computers 3 la, • • • ,  3 In.  The relation database 122 stores relation of a sender and a receiver when one user designates a particular user and orders a send of his or her business card information to the designated user.   The user database  123  stores information  of  business  card  information  sender  in connection with an individual user.   In respect of an individual user of the receiver, a sender of business card information is recognized from the relation database 122 and the sender information is stored in the user database<br>
123.<br>
Therefore, users who inputted his or her business card information can designate receivers and distribute the business card information to the receivers by sending the business card information stored in the business card information database 121 to the receivers. Also, users of the receivers can identify the senders from the user database 123,  selectively designate receivers from the senders and send information including his or her business card information to the designated receivers at once. Fig. 2 shows a flow chart of the present invention. Firstly, users access to the information management system 10 of the present invention by means of the mobile communication equipments  4 la,  41b,  • • • ,  4 In or the computers 3la, • • •, 3In and input their business card information. (Step 210)  At this time, the first accessed user may acquire an ID number and a password from the information management system 10 and proceed a verification when the user accesses the information management system 10 thereafter.<br>
The business card information are, for example, such as mobile phone number, E-mail address, company phone number, company address, position and facsimile number.  Besides them,  the information include useful information which should be informed of.  For instance, bank account number is possible, which informs the counterpart where he or she should pay. The business card information may be a form of<br>
picture, voice or motion picture.<br>
Then/ the business card information are stored in the<br>
business card information database 121 of the information<br>
management system 10. (Step 220} Accordingly, the business<br>
card information such as mobile phone number, E-mail<br>
address, company phone number, company address, position,<br>
facsimile number and bank account number, all of which are<br>
inputted  by  users  through  the  mobile  communication<br>
equipments 41a, 41b, • • • , 41n or the computers 31a, • • ,• 3 In, are stored in the business card information database 121 of the information management system 10. At this time, it is possible to designate open to public or close to public  in  respect  of  each  piece  of  business  card information and store them.  Then, only the information designated open to public are sent to receiver as described later.<br>
As an example, on the mobile communication equipments<br>
or the computers, the items of business card information<br>
are browsed as an input window from the information<br>
management system 10 and users input each item of business<br>
card information on the browed input window.  Then the<br>
mobile communication equipments or the computers transfer<br>
the information to the information management system 10 and<br>
the information management system 10 stores the transferred<br>
information on the business card information data base 121.<br>
So the steps of 210 and 220 are achieved.<br>
After the business card information in respect of<br>
individual user are stored in the business card information database 121, when one user specifies a particular user and orders  send of  the  business  card  information to the specified user, between the two users the relation of a sender and a receiver is formed, and the relation is stored in the relation database 122 (Step 230)  For instance, on mobile communication equipment or computer, those of a user of a sender, the input window for item by which a receiver is uniquely specified is browsed, and user of sender can designate a particular receiver by inputting the unique item information  of  the  receiver.   The unique  item information is that generally one has only one information such as mobile phone number. Also, the browsed view on the mobile communication equipment or computer may have a send button and the click of the button means the order of the sending business card information.   When a particular receiver  is  designated and the order of  sending the business  card  information  is  made  by  this way,  the information management system 10 of the present invention recognizes the user accessed to the information management system 10 as a sender and recognizes the user whom the sender designated as a receiver, and stores the relation of the sender and the receiver between them in the relation database 122.<br>
Then, the information management system 10 identifies the sender in respect of each receiver from the relation of the sender and the receiver stored in the relation database<br>
122  and  stores  the  sender information in  respect  of individual receiver in the user database 123. (Step 240)<br>
Then, if there is a request from a user of the receiver of  the  business  card  information,  the  information management system 10 identifies the sender of the business card information to the user of the receiver from the user database  123  and extracts the sender's business card information from the business card information database 121 and transfers the sender's information to the user of the receiver.   (Step 250)  In this case, the business card information transfer,  for example,  is  to browse the information on the mobile communication equipment or computer of individual user.  In this case, if some of the business card information are designated whether they are open or close to public, only the information open to public are transferred.<br>
Then, the receiver received the sender's business card information  reversely  selectively  designates  reversed receivers (Original senders) who receive the receiver's information including his or her business card information from the senders (Step 260), and send the information reversely.  (Step 270).   In this case, the information reversely transferred to the original sender may be the business card information of original receiver stored in the business card information database 121. This transfer of the information may be to browse the information on the mobile communication equipment or computers of the reversed<br>
receiver.<br>
When transferring the information besides the business card information, the information' transferring means 130 such as SMTP server, messenger server and SMS connection means is available.<br>
Fig. 3 is a flow chart showing the process of transferring the information besides the business card information by means of the information transferring means 130 such as SMTP server, messenger server and SMS connection means to the mobile communication equipments or the computers of the selected reversed receivers who were the original senders.<br>
Firstly, after the business card information are transferred from the original senders, ' the reversed receivers are selected from them. (Step 310)<br>
Then, information to be sent to the reversed receivers are inputted to the information transferring means 130. For instance, SMTP server is used, E-mail addresses are inputted to it.<br>
Then, the information transferring means is selected if multiple kind of the information transferring means such as SMTP server, messenger server and SMS connection means are provided in the information management system. (Step 330)<br>
Then,   the   inputted  information   are   reversely transferred to the selected original senders.  (Step 340)<br>
In selecting a reversed receivers from the original business card information senders (Step 260 of Fig. 2 or<br>
Step 310 of Fig. 3), it is possible to put together some of the original senders into groups and send the information to the groups. Fig. 4 shows such a process.<br>
Firstly, the business card information of the sender are transferred to the user of the receiver.  (Step 410)<br>
Then, groups are formed and the senders are put to a particular group and these are stored in the group database (not shown). (Step 420) The group database stores information of business card information senders in respect of each group.<br>
Then, user of the receiver selects reversed receivers in respect of the groups who receives the business card information of other information. (Step 430)<br>
Then, the reversed information are•transferred to the selected reversed receivers of the particular groups. (Step 440)<br>
In the above description, the input of the business card information and the selection of the receivers are accomplished by use of conventional means.  Besides, there are many methods to designate the receiver.  For example, Bar code or color code is available.   In this case, the information of the business card or the receiver are bar coded or color coded. The mobile communication equipments 41a, 41b,  • ' * , 41n or computers 31a, • • • ,  31u have means for reading the coded information such as bar code reader or Charge-coupled device and means for decoding the coded information and transfer the decoded information to<br>
the information management system 10.<br>
Fig. 5 shows tables to illustrate the relation between the business card information database 121, the relation database 122 and the user database 123.<br>
Firstly, a business card information table 510 is shown. This is the business card information which a separate user accessed to the information management system 10 inputs.<br>
With respect to users named chun hyung, song senung han, hong kil dong, chun u-chi, their phone numbers and the renewal dates are stored corresponding to ID numbers 001, 002, 003 and 004 as primary key.<br>
This table only shows the phone number as business card information, other information such as company name, the position, and E-mail address may be included. Also, in each field of the business card information item, whether the value is open to public or close to public may be recorded, therefore, only the field value recorded as open to public is transferred.<br>
Referral number 520 indicates a relation database table. This table is formed when one use designates a receiver and send his or her business card information to record the relation of a sender and a receiver between them. As shown, it stores the information that ID number 003(that is hong kil dong) sent the business card information to the ID number 001 (that is chun hyung) at March 3, 2000. It stores the information that ID number 004 (that is chun u-chi) sent the business card information to the ID number<br>
001 (that is chun hyung) at March 4, 2000. It stores the information that ID number 002 (that is song seung han) sent the business card information to the ID number 003 (that is hong kil dong) at March 5, 2000. Also, it stores the information that ID number 005 sent the business card information to the ID number 003 (that is hong kil dong) at March 6, 2000.<br>
The renewal date fields in the business card information table 510 and the relation database table 520 represent the date when the business card information is inputted and the date when the relation is established, respectively. They are necessary to renew and send the changed business card information to the receiver when the business card information are changed. It will be described later.<br>
Referring to the relation table 520, the sender information in respect of each receiver are recorded and stored in the user database 123. A user table 530 is shown. The table stores the information that the ID numbers of 003 and 004 sent the business card information in respect of the user of ID number 001 (that is chung hyung). Also, it stores the information that the ID numbers of 002 and 005 sent the business card information in respect of the user of ID number 003 (that is hong kil dong).<br>
Accordingly, the information management system 10 of the present invention identifies the senders (that is ID number) to the ID number 001, chung hyung and extracts the<br>
business card information of the sender (the field value of record corresponding to the ID number) and transfers these information to ID number 001, chung hyung<br>
The present invention allows facts necessary to be recorded in connection with a sender of the business card information   to   be   easily   recorded  and  managed. Specifically, according to the present invention, the facts to be recorded in connection with the sender are inputted to the information management system 10 by users of the receivers through the mobile communication equipments or computers and stored in the user database 123. Accordingly, a user who received the business card information from a sender can record and store necessary facts in connection with the sender and identify them if necessary. To achieve this, the user database table 530 includes a field in respect of each record of the sender information and the field holds the fact that the user of the receiver inputs in connection with the sender.  For instance, that field value is such as memorial date between the sender and the receiver or necessary memorandum.<br>
Fig. 9 shows a flow chart processing the records in connection with a sender.<br>
Firstly, a business card information is transferred to a user of a receiver. This transfer of the business card information was described with reference to steps from 210 to 250 in Fig. 2. (Step 910)<br>
Then,  the  user  of  the  receiver  inputs  facts  in<br>
connection with the sender, the facts being formed as field values on the user database 123. (Step 920)  For instance, when the business card information of the sender are transferred to the receiver by browsing the information on the mobile communication equipment or the computer of the receiver, the browsed view may include input windows for facts to be recorded in connection with the sender.  Then, the receiver inputs the necessary information on the input windows and transfers the information to the information management system of the present invention 10.<br>
The input of facts in connection with the sender is stored in the user database 123 (Step 930) For instance, in the user database table 530 in Fig. 5, these information are stored as field value with respect to each record.<br>
Then, when the receiver requests, these inputted and stored facts in connection with the sender are transferred to the receiver. (Step 940) For instance, these may be browsed together with the business card information of the sender.<br>
The information management system 10 of the present invention , when there is a change of a business card information of a sender, informs the individual receiver of the change to renew the sender's business card information or automatically renews the sender's business card information for each of the receiver. Further, the information management system 10 of the present invention allows break of the relation when the receiver wants to<br>
break the relation between the sender and the receiver. Figs 10 and 11 show such a procedures.<br>
Firstly, with reference to Fig. 10, the procedure of the changed business card information being transferred is explained when the business card information is changed.<br>
The  information  management  system  10  compare  the storing date of the business card information recorded on the business card information database 121 (that is the renewal date of the business card information database 510 in Fig. 5) with the relation establishment date on the relation database 122 (that is the renewal date of the relation database 520 in Fig. 5) to determine which date is later. (Step 1010)  If the renewal date on the business card information database 121 is later,.this indicates that the sender has changed the business card information.<br>
Accordingly, in this case, the information management system references the receiver information on the relation database 122 and transfers the changed sender's business card information to the receivers. At this time, new relation establishment date is recorded. (Step 1020)<br>
If the renewal date on the business card information database is earlier than the relation establishment date on the relation database, that means no change of the business card information to the sender and, thus, nothing transfers.<br>
According to the present invention, when the business card information of the sender changes, the receiver can<br>
break the relation not to receive more business card information from the sender. • It is described with reference to Pig. 11.<br>
Firstly, The information management system 10 compare the storing date of the business card information recorded on the business card information database 121 (that is the renewal date of the business card information database 510 in Fig.  5) with the relation establishment date on the relation database 122 (that is the renewal date of the relation database 520 in Fig. 5) to determine which date is later. (Step 1110)  If the renewal date on the business card information .database 121 is later, this indicates that the sender has changed the business card information.<br>
Then, the information management system 10 ask the receiver whether the receiver wants to receive the changed business card information (Step 1120) For instance, the information management system 10 browses the message to the receiver's computer.<br>
If the user of the receiver selects the renewal, the changed business card information is transferred to the user of the receiver and the relation establishment date on the relation database is renewed. (Step 1140)<br>
If the user of the receiver do not want to renew, the information management system ask whether the user wants the break of the relation. (Step 1150)<br>
When the user selects the break of the relation, the relation between the sender the business information of<br>
whom was changed and the receiver is broken. (Step 1160) That is, the relation database 122 records the break of the relation. For instance, the user database table 520 includes field value regarding the relation break where the break is recorded as an attribute. Then, the relation is broke on the relation database 122 and if the sender's business card information changes no more ask whether to renew occurs.<br>
If the receiver does not want to break the relation, the relation database is kept and the relation is kept. (Step 1170)<br>
It is possible for the present invention to transfer the business card information to a person who does not input his or her business card information and let the person to read the transferred business card information when he or she inputs his or her business card information. Fig. 6 shows such a procedure.<br>
Firstly, the user who stores his or her business card information designates a receiver and orders the send of the business card information. (Step 610) For instance, by inputting the mobile phone number, the receiver is designated.<br>
Then, whether the designated receiver is a user who already stores his or her business card information is judged. (Step 620) For instance, the designated receiver is not the one who already stores his or her business card information if the inputted mobile phone number is not on<br>
the business card information database 121.<br>
If the designated receiver is not the user who already stores his or her business card information, new storage is formed where the receiver designation information and the sender information is store. (step 630) Accordingly, the designated receiver who stores his or her business card information later will read the business card information transferred to ho or herself.<br>
If the designated receiver is the user who already stores his or her business card information,  the relation of the sender and the receiver between them is established and is stored on the relation database 122 (Step 640), then, the busineess card sender information is stored in the user database 123. Later, the receiver can identify the sender of the business card information and selectively choose from them to transfer information.<br>
The information management system '10 of the present invention let the receiver of the business card information automatically respond to the sender to send back the receiver's business card information. This is shown with reference to Fig. 7.<br>
Firstly, when a user access to the information management system 10 and inputs the user's business card information, the user chooses and inputs the automatic response. Then, to the user, automatic response is recorded on the business card information data base 121. (Step 710)<br>
Then, the user who chose the automatic response is designated.as a receiver and the business card information is transferred to the user. (Step 720)<br>
Then, the information management system 10 extracts the business card information of the user of the receiver from the business card information database 121 and send back the information to the sender, (step 730)<br>
According to the present invention, a receiver can receive a business card information from one who knows the secret number of the receiver. Accordingly, selective information receipt is possible. Fig. 12 shows such a procedure.<br>
Firstly, a user who inputs his or her business card information can inputs his or her secret number as a business card information (Step 1210) The secret number is one field value of the business card information database 121.<br>
Then, when a sender transfers his or her business card information to the user who stores the secret number, the sender should inputs the secret number (Step 1220) Preferably, the information management system requests the secret number to the sender.<br>
Then, the information management system 10 compares the secret number the sender inputs with the secret number stored (Step 1230)<br>
If the two secret numbers are matched, the relation of the sender and the receiver is established to be stored in<br>
the relation database (step 1250), and the business card information is transferred, (step 1260)<br>
If the two secret numbers are- not matched, no transferring message is transferred to the sender. (step 1240)<br>
Fig.  13  shows  interface  according to the present invention. Firstly, referral number 71 indicates a view how the sender's business card information stored in the user database 123 is shown. Here, change signal and buttons of renewal/delete  are  shown,  which  are  related  to  the description explained with reference to Fig. 11. When the sender's business card information is changed, the change signal is shown, by which the change is informed to the receiver.  Pressing the renewal button makes the sender's business card information renewed and transferred to the receiver and pressing the delete button makes the break of the relation.<br>
Also, signal of other's information edit is shown, which  are related to the description of records  in connection with a sender explained with reference to Fig. 9 When the edit button is pressed, the related record to the sender is shown as referral numeral 73 where items of menu are shown such as 132 or 152.  in the items of menu such as 132 or 152 the related information to the sender is inputted (Step 920) and the inputted information is stored in the user database. (Step 940)<br>
Further, reference numeral 72 shows the input window of<br>
the business card information when each of user sends his or her business card information.<br>
When transferring the business card information according to the present invention, it is not always necessary for a user to order the send the information via the Internet. For instance, when the information is transferred by means of the mobile phone, it is possible to reach the information management system by inputting the mobile phone number without Internet interface such as wap interface. Such a procedure is shown in Fig. 8.<br>
Firstly, the business card information of a user is stored in the business card information database 121. (Step 810)<br>
Then, the user designates a receiver by inputting a receiver's phone number to the mobile phone and orders the send of the business card information.  (Step 820)  For instance, if the receiver's mobile phone number is 017-xxx-xxxx, this number is inputted so that the receiver is designated and press a button (for 'example # button) indicating the send order of the business card information. Then, a mobile telecommunication service company, the mobile telecommunication network of which is used by the mobile phone, receive the order information and transfers it to the information management system 10.  (Step 830) Since   mobile  telecommunication  service  company  can identify a sender, phone number of a receiver and send order,  it can transfer the above information to the<br>
information management system 10. For instance, the above information are made to database, and transferred to the information management system 10 via the dedicated line.<br>
Then, the information management system 10 received the information of the sender, receiver and send order extracts the sender's business card information from the business card information database 121 and transfers to the designated receiver. (Step 840)<br>
When orders the send of business card information by means of mobile phone number as described above, it is obvious that the mobile phone need not to include the Internet browser.<br>
Specially, if the information management system 10 only does the transfer of the business card information, the relation database 122 and the user database 123 are not essential elements thereof.  However, in this case, as explained with reference to Fig. 8, without the Internet interface, it is possible to transfer the business card information in such a way that a user inputs a receiver' s mobile phone number to designate the receiver and puts some button to order the send. That is, by means of the mobile communication equipments 4la, 41b, • • • , 4In or computers 3la,  • • • , 3In which include the Internet browser, the business card information is inputted and stored in the business card information database 121, and by following the procedure of Fig. 8, the business card information can be  transferred.    In  this  case,  the  business  card<br>
information  may  be  divided  by  its  category  and  the information belonging to selected category be transferred. That is, the business card information are specified into its  categories  and  are  stored  in  the  business  card information  database  121  by  the  category  and  when transferring the business card information by means of the mobile phone, it is possible to select specific information from the categories.<br>
For  instance,   a  user  may  input  017-xxxx-xxxx (receiver's phone number) 3 (the specific information the user want to transfer)#(send order) into the mobile phone. These inputted information are transferred to a mobile telecommunication service company and the company transfers the information to the information management system 10 so that the transfer of the business card information is accomplished. •   In this case, the sender may input the secret number the receiver designated, which means the receiver receives the business card information from the sender who knows the  secret number.  As a result, the selective receipt of the business card information is possible.<br>
At this time, the information management system further includes a information transferring means by which it can transfer information in addition to the business card information. For instance, the web server may include SMS connection means so that a user can send short message as well as the business card information.<br>
In  the  above  embodiments,  the  mobile  communication<br>
equipments  4 la,  41b,  • • • ,  4 In are connected to the<br>
Internet via mobile telecommunication network 50 and	the<br>
wap gateway 55.  However, that is an example of how	the<br>
mobile  communication equipments  are connected to	the<br>
Internet and it is obvious that all means to connect	the<br>
mobile  communication equipment with the  Internet	are<br>
available.<br>
