				<td>The present invention.relates to a styrenic<br>
resin composition. More particularly, the present<br>
invention relates to a styrenic resin composition<br>
comprising a rubber modified styrene maleic<br>
anhydride (SMA) copoiymer and polybutene; to<br>
articles of manufacture, e.g. thermoformed<br>
containers suitable for packaged foods that are to<br>
be heated in microwave ovens, that are produced from<br>
the styrenic resin composition and having improved<br>
properties, e.g. toughness, elongation, and heat<br>
distortion resistance; and to related methods for<br>
producing the styrenic resin composition.<br>
2.	Background Art<br>
It is known to copolymerize styrene and maleic<br>
anhydride. Such processes have been described at<br>
length in the literature, especially in Baer U.S.<br>
Patent No. 2,971,939 and Hanson U.S. Patent No.<br>
2,769,804, and beneficially as a solution as<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,336,267.<br>
It is known in the art to modify styrene maleic<br>
anhydride (SMA) copolymers with rubber. Generally,<br>
these copolymers are referred to as "rubber modified<br>
styrene/maleic anhydride copolymers". It is known<br>
that the rubber component provides increased impact<br>
resistance and that the maleic anhydride component<br>
provides a high heat distortion temperature. An<br><br>
improved method for preparing styrene/maleic<br>
anhydride/diene rubber composition suitable for<br>
extrusion and molding and having a high heat<br>
distortion temperature and desired impact resistance<br>
is disclosed in Moore et al. U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,191,354 (The Dow Chemical Company), which was<br>
issued on November 11, 1975.<br>
Hathaway et al. U.S. Patent No. 5,219,628 (The<br>
Dow Chemical Company), which was issued on June 15,<br>
1993, discloses a multi-layer container for use in<br>
the microwave cooking of food. The container<br>
comprises a substrate layer of thermoplastic polymer<br>
that is not suitable for contact with the food, and<br>
an inner layer comprised of a blend of<br>
styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer and a polymer<br>
selected from the group consisting of polystyrene,<br>
rubber modified polystyrene, polymethyl<br>
methacrylate, rubber modified polymethyl<br>
methacrylate, polypropylene, and mixtures thereof.<br>
This patent also teaches that rubber modified<br>
styrene/maleic anhydride copolymers may also be<br>
used, but are not preferred.<br>
It is known to produce various shaped articles<br>
from foamed and unfoamed thermoplastic materials<br>
such as polystyrene sheet or impact modified<br>
polystyrene sheet (i.e. high impact polystyrene<br>
sheet) by thermoforming methods. Many such articles<br>
are containers used for packaged foods.<br>
Chundury et al. U.S. Patent No. 5,106,696<br>
(assigned to Ferro Corporation), which was issued on<br>
April 21, 1992 discloses and claims a thermoformable<br>
multi-layer structure for packaging materials and<br>
2<br><br>
foods.. A polymer composition for a first layer of<br>
the structure comprises: (A) 49% to 90% by weight of<br>
a polyblefin, i.e. polypropylene, polybutene; (B)<br>
10%-,to 30% by weight of a copolymer of styrene and<br>
maieic anhydride; (C) 2% to 20% by weight of a<br>
compatilizing agent, i.e., a starblock, diblock or<br>
mixtures thereof of a copolymer of styrene and<br>
butadiene; (D) 0 to 5% by weight of a triblock<br>
copolymer of styrene and butadiene; and (E) 20% by<br>
weight of talc. The second layer of the structure<br>
is made of polypropylene.<br>
It is known to improve the environmental stress<br>
crack resistance (ESCR) of high impact polystyrene<br>
(HIPS) and other impact modified styrenic polymers,<br>
such as acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene plastic<br>
(ABS) and methyl methacrylate-butadiene-styrene<br>
plastics (MBS), with the addition of polybutene.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,543,461 assigned to Novacor<br>
Chemicals (International) S.A. discloses a rubber<br>
modified graft thermoplastic composition comprising:<br>
1) 99 to 96% by weight of a rubber modified<br>
thermoplastic comprising: (a) 4 to 15 weight %<br>
rubbery substrate, preferably polybutadiene, that is<br>
distributed throughout a matrix of the superstrate<br>
polymer in particles having a number average<br>
particle size from 6 to 12 microns and (b) 96 to 85%<br>
by weight of a superstrate polymer; and 2) 1 to 4%<br>
by weight of polybutene having a number average<br>
molecular weight from 900 to 2000. Claim 10 of this<br>
patent recites that the superstrate polymer may<br>
comprise 85% to 95% by weight of styrene and from 5%<br>
to 15% by weight of maleic anhydride. The ESCR of<br>
3<br><br>
the impact modified styrenic polymers is attributed<br>
to the large particle size of the impact modifier<br>
i.e. 6 to 12 microns and to the use of the low<br>
molecular weight polybutene. Such thermoplastics<br>
find a fairly significant market in housewares,<br>
which are subject to chemicals that tend to cause<br>
environmental stress cracking (ESC), such as<br>
cleaners and in some cases, fatty or oily food.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,543,461 discussed in the<br>
preceding paragraph discloses in the background<br>
section that the thermoplastic having the best ESCR<br>
is Chevron's HIPS grade 6755. This Chevron product . <br>
contains 2 to 3 weight % of polybutene and' has a<br>
dispersed rubbery phase with a volume average<br>
particle diameter between 4 and 4.5 microns. This<br>
Chevron product relates to high impact polystyrene<br>
(HIPS) with ESCR properties and not to a rubber<br>
modified styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer.<br>
A number of process designs are disclosed in the<br>
patent literature involving polymerization<br>
techniques, reactor configurations and mixing<br>
schemes that are used to incorporate maleic<br>
anhydride in a styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer.<br>
Examples include Tanaka et al. U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,328,327 assigned to Daicel Chemical Industries,<br>
Ltd., Meyer et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,921,906<br>
assigned to Stamicarbon B.V., and the above Moore et<br>
al. U.S. Patent No. 3,919,354 assigned to The Dow<br>
Chemi ca1 Company.<br>
The latter document, i.e. U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,919,354 discloses an improved styrene/maleic<br>
anhydride/diene rubber composition suitable for<br>
4<br><br>
extrusion and molding and having a high heat<br>
distortion temperature and desired impact<br>
resistance. The process for the preparation of the<br>
polymer involves modifying a styrene-maleic<br>
anhydride copolymer with diene rubber by<br>
polymerizing the styrene monomer and the anhydride<br>
in the presence of the rubber. More particularly,<br>
the process involves providing a styrene having<br>
rubber dissolved therein; agitating the<br>
styrene/rubber mixture and initiating free radical<br>
polymerization thereof; adding to the agitated<br>
mixture the maleic anhydride at a rate substantially<br>
less than the rate of polymerization of the styrene<br>
monomer; and polymerizing the styrene monomer and<br>
the maleic anhydride. The polymer contains rubber<br>
particles ranging from 0.02 to 30 microns dispersed<br>
throughout a matrix of polymer of the styrene<br>
monomer and the anhydride with at least a major<br>
portion of the rubber particles containing<br>
occlusions of the polymerized styrene monomer and<br>
maleic anhydride. This patent teaches that the<br>
polymers are suited for extrusion into sheet or<br>
film, which are then employed for thermoforming into<br>
containers, packages and the like. Alternately the<br>
polymers can be injection molded into a wide variety<br>
of components such as dinnerware and heatable frozen<br>
food containers.<br>
However, polymers as those disclosed in the<br>
above U.S. Patent No. 3,919,354 are generally<br>
brittle, and therefore, capable of breaking even<br>
though these polymers have the thermal properties to<br>
withstand temperatures above 210°F, which temperature<br>
5<br><br>
is generally used in heating food in a microwave<br>
oven. <br>
It is desirable to have an article such as a<br>
container that is suitable for packaged foods and<br>
that could withstand the temperatures needed for<br>
heating foods in a microwave oven without the<br>
j<br>
container breaking, especially upon removal of the<br>
container but of the microwave oven.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention has met this need in the food<br>
packaging industry. It has been found by the<br>
inventors that a rubber modified styrene/maleic<br>
anhydride (SMA) copolymer with polybutene can<br>
produce a styrenic resin composition that is<br>
particularly useful for thermoforming articles, i.e.<br>
especially food containers for use in heating foods<br>
in microwave ovens, and which styrenic resin<br>
composition has excellent heat resistance properties<br>
as well as excellent toughness and elongation<br>
properties.<br>
The styrenic resin composition of the invention<br>
comprises a rubber modified styrene/maleic anhydride<br>
copolymer and a polybutene, the latter of which<br>
enhances the rubber modified styrene/maleic<br>
anhydride copolymer. Of this composition, the<br>
weight percent of polybutene ranges from about 0.1%<br>
to about 8%; preferably from about 2% to about 6% by<br>
weight; and more preferably from about 3 to about 5%<br>
by weight. The weight percent of the rubber<br>
modified styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer ranges<br>
from about 92.0% to about 99.9%; preferably from<br>
6<br><br>
about 94.0% to about 98%; and more preferably from<br>
about 95% to about 97%. The maleic anhydride<br>
content of the rubber modified styrene/maleic<br>
anhydride copolymer generally will range from about<br>
2% to about 25% by weight, and preferably from about<br>
5% to about 15% by weight. The styrene content;of<br>
the rubber modified styrene/maleic anhydride .<br>
copolymer ranges from about 75% to about 98% by<br>
weight, and preferably from about 85% to about 95%<br>
by weight. The rubber content of the rubber<br>
modified styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer will<br>
range from about 4% to about 20% by weight, and<br>
preferably from 8% to about 15% by weight, and the<br>
rubber particle size generally will range from about<br>
0.1 micron to about 11 microns.<br>
The styrenic resin composition can be prepared<br>
by polymerizing rubber, styrene monomers, and maleic<br>
anhydride in the presence of polybutene in a<br>
suitable reactor under free radical polymerization<br>
conditions. The polybutene can be added to the<br>
rubber/styrene/maleic anhydride feed, or can be<br>
added to or in the polymerization reactor vessel, or<br>
can be added to the partially polymerized syrup<br>
after it exits the reactor and enters the<br>
devolatilizer. It is also envisioned that the<br>
polybutene can be compounded, i.e. mixed into the<br>
polymer after the polymer has exited the<br>
devolatilizer, via an extruder, e.g. a twin-screw<br>
extruder, either in line or off line as a separate<br>
operation after the rubber modified SMA copolymer<br>
has been pelletized.<br>
7<br><br>
The invention also provides for an extruded<br>
thermoplastic sheet made from the styrenic resin<br>
composition of the invention, as well as<br>
thermoformed articles made from the sheet. An<br>
example of an article is a container for packaged<br>
foods that is to be heated particularly in a<br>
microwave oven and which article has improved<br>
toughness, elongation, and heat distortion<br>
resistance properties.<br>
Furthermore, there is provided a multi-layer<br>
thermoplastic composite comprising a substrate layer<br>
and a layer made from the styrenic resin composition<br>
of the invention, which multi-layer composite can be<br>
thermoformed into articles, e.g. containers suitable<br>
for heating purposes in microwave ovens, and which<br>
articles have improved toughness, elongation, and<br>
heat distortion resistance properties.<br>
These and other objects of the present<br>
invention will be better appreciated and understood<br>
by those skilled in the art from the following<br>
description and appended claims.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The styrenic resin composition of the invention<br>
comprises a rubber modified styrene maleic anhydride<br>
copolymer and polybutene. More particularly, the<br>
styrenic resin composition is comprised of at least<br>
rubber, styrene, maleic anhydride, and polybutene.<br>
The term "devolatilizer" and the term<br>
"devolatilizing system" as used herein are meant to<br>
include all shapes and forms of devolatilizers<br>
including an extruder and/or a falling strand flash<br>
8<br><br>
devolatilizer. The term "devolatilizing" and the<br>
term "devolatilizing step" as used herein are meant<br>
to refer to a process, which may include an extruder<br>
and/or a falling strand flash devolatilizer.<br>
 In an embodiment of the invention, the<br>
inventors have found that a low molecular weight<br>
polybutene can be added to the reacting mixture of<br>
rubber, styrene, and maleic anhydride before the<br>
devolatilization step to improve toughness,<br>
elongation, and heat distortion resistance<br>
properties of a styrenic resin composition. This<br>
resin composition can be used in applications where . <br>
the prior art resins proved to be too brittle and/or<br>
the heat distortion resistance was inadequate. For<br>
example, and as discussed hereinabove, if containers<br>
for packaged foods made from the rubber modified<br>
styrenic/maleic anhydride resins of the prior art<br>
are heated in microwave ovens at temperatures higher<br>
than 210°F, the containers generally break when they<br>
are taken out of the oven. The resin of the<br>
invention can now be used in making these types of<br>
containers without the containers breaking under<br>
normal usage.<br>
The reason for the improvements in the styrenic<br>
resin composition of the invention is not clear, and<br>
the inventors do not wish to be bound to any theory.<br>
However, it is believed that the addition of<br>
polybutene to the components of the rubber modified<br>
styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer particularly<br>
before devolatilizing distributes the polybutene<br>
such that it enhances the properties of the rubber<br>
component. That is, it is believed that the<br>
9<br><br>
polybutene gravitates toward and surrounds the<br>
rubber component and not the styfene/maleic anydride<br>
component in view of the high polarity of the<br>
styrene/maleic anhydride matrix. In contrast, the<br>
inventors theorize that the polybutene used<br>
particularly in accordance with the teachings of<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,543,461 is distributed in the<br>
matrix along with the polystyrene1 and the rubber<br>
component.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,543,461 teaches that the<br>
rubber modified thermoplastic composition can be<br>
rubber modified styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer<br>
and polybutene. However, the Examples of this 461<br>
patent only illustrate high impact polystyrene<br>
(HIPS) and improvements in ESCR, and both the<br>
Examples and the teachings of this 461 patent are<br>
silent on any enhancement in toughness.<br>
This U.S. Patent No. 5,543,461 teaches that the<br>
polybutene ranges in amounts from 1 to 4% by weight<br>
and the rubber particle size ranges from 6 to 12<br>
microns. The inventors have found that the rubber<br>
particle size used in the styrenic resin composition<br>
of the invention can be less than 6 microns without<br>
affecting the much sought-after improvements in<br>
properties. This is illustrated in the Examples,<br>
particularly in Examples 1 and 2 herein, where a<br>
particle size smaller than 6 microns still results<br>
in improved toughness and elongation.<br>
The styrenic resin composition of the invention<br>
may be prepared via polymerization techniques or<br>
compounding techniques, both of which are known to<br>
those skilled in the art.<br>
10<br><br>
It has been found by the inventors that the<br>
addition of the polybutene to the reactor or to the<br>
syrup exiting the. reactor and prior to it entering<br>
the devolatilizer may provide even a higher degree<br>
of improvement in. toughness, elongation, and heat<br>
distortion resistance properties compared to the<br>
addition of the polybutene in a compounding<br>
technique which entails the polybutene being added<br>
to the polymer in an extruder after the<br>
devolatilizer and the pelletizer or after the<br>
devolatilizer but before the pelletizer, more about<br>
which will be discussed herein below.<br>
The polymerization techniques used in<br>
polymerizing the components of the styrenic resin<br>
composition of the invention may be solution, mass,<br>
bulk, suspension, or emulsion polymerization. Bulk<br>
polymerization is preferred.<br>
The styrenic resin composition may be prepared<br>
by reacting styrene monomers, maleic anhydride, and<br>
rubber in a suitable reactor under free radical<br>
polymerization conditions and adding the polybutene<br>
to the reactive mixture. Desirably the maleic<br>
anhydride is added to the styrene monomers and the<br>
rubber continuously at about the rate of reaction to<br>
a stirred reactor to form a polymer composition<br>
having a uniform maleic anhydride.<br>
The amount of styrene monomers added to the<br>
reactor ranges from about 80% to about 95% by<br>
weight; the amount of maleic anhydride added to the<br>
reactor ranges from about 5% to about 2 0% by weight;<br>
the amount of rubber added to the reactor ranges<br>
from about 4% to about 15% by weight; and the amount<br>
11<br><br>
of polybutene added to the reactor ranges from about<br>
0.5% to about 8.0% by weight, based on the weight of<br>
the total weight of the components of the styrenic<br>
resin composition.<br>
The formed styrenic resin composition comprises<br>
a rubber modified styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer<br>
and polybutene. Of this styrenic resin composition<br>
the rubber modified styrene/maleic anhydride<br>
copolymer ranges from about 99.9% to about 92.0% by<br>
weight and the polybutene ranges from about 0.1% to<br>
about 8%. Preferably, the polybutene ranges from<br>
about 2% to about 6% by weight, and most preferably, <br>
from about 3% to about 5% by weight.<br>
Of the rubber modified styrene/maleic anhydride<br>
copolymer, the maleic anhydride content generally<br>
ranges from about 2% to about 25% by weight, and<br>
preferably, from about 5% to about 15% by weight;<br>
the rubber content generally ranges from about 4% to<br>
about 20% by weight, and preferably from about 8% to<br>
about 15% by weight, with the remaining amount being<br>
styrene.<br>
The polybutene may have a number average<br>
molecular weight (Mn) from about 900 to about 2500,<br>
preferably from about 900 to about 1300. The<br>
polybutene is added to the other components of the<br>
styrenic resin composition of the invention in the<br>
manner taught herein.<br>
Suitable rubbers for the styrenic resin<br>
composition are ethylene-propylene copolymers,<br>
ethylene propylene copolymers in which other<br>
polyunsaturated monomers have been copolymerized,<br>
polybutadiene, butadiene, styrene-butadiene rubber,<br>
12<br><br>
butadiene-acrylonitrile rubber, polychloroprene,<br>
acrylate rubber, chlorinated polyethylene rubber,<br>
polyisoprene and cyclo-olefin rubbers. The rubber -<br>
particles may have a particle size such that the<br>
volume average particle size diameter of the<br>
particles is about 0.1 micron to about 11 microns.<br>
The rubber particle size may be less than 6 microns,<br>
that is, ranging from 0.1 micron to about 5 microns,<br>
and still result in the desired properties of the<br>
styrenic resin composition.<br>
A preferred rubber is polybutadiene. The<br>
polybutadiene rubber may be medium or high cis-<br>
polybutadiene. Typically, high cis-polybutadiene<br>
contains not less than 95%, preferably more than<br>
about 98 weight % of the polymer in the cis-<br>
configuration. Typically, medium cis-polybutadiene<br>
has a cis content from about 60 to 80, and<br>
preferably from about 65 to 75 weight %. Examples<br>
of a suitable high cis-polybutadiene include Taktene<br>
1202 made by Bayer Corporation and Nipol 1220SU and<br>
Nipol 1220SG available from Nippon Zeon Co.,<br>
Limited. Examples of a suitable medium cis-<br>
polybutadiene include Diene 55 and Diene 70<br>
available from Firestone Polymers, and Asadene 55AE<br>
available from Asahi Kasei Corporation.<br>
The addition of the polybutene to the styrene<br>
monomer, the rubber, and the maleic anhydride is<br>
preferably brought about through a polymerization<br>
process. In the polymerization process, the<br>
polybutene is added in solution with the feedstock<br>
in the reactor, or is added to the reactor<br>
separately from the other components, or is added to<br>
13<br><br>
the partially polymerized syrup after the syrup<br>
exits the reactor and prior to the syrup entering<br>
the devolatilizer. The polybutene can also be<br>
incorporated into the styrenic composition through<br>
compounding techniques.<br>
Polymerization of the polymerizable mixture may <br>
be accomplished by thermal polymerization generally |<br>
between 50°C and 200°C; preferably, between 70°C and <br>
50°C; and most preferably between 80°C and 140°C.<br>
Alternately free-radical generating initiators may<br>
be used.<br>
Examples of free-radical initiators that may <br>
be used are benzoyl peroxide, 2,4-dichlorobenzoyl:<br>
peroxide, di-tert-butyl peroxide, tert-butyl<br>
peroxybenzoate, dicumyl peroxide, cumene<br>
hydroperoxide, diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide,<br>
diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate, tert-butyl<br>
perisobutyrate, tert-butyl peroxyisopropylcarbonate,<br>
tert-butyl peroxypivalate, methyl ethyl ketone<br>
peroxide, stearoyl peroxide, tert-butyl<br>
hyroperoxide, lauroyl peroxide, azo-bis-<br>
isobutyronitrile or mixtures thereof.<br>
Generally, the initiator is included in the<br>
range of 0.001 to 1.0% by weight, and preferably on<br>
the order of 0.005 to 0.5% by weight of the<br>
polymerizable material, depending upon the monomers<br>
and the desired polymerization cycle.<br>
Preferably, the required total amount of<br>
initiator is added simultaneously with the feedstock<br>
when the feedstock is introduced into the reactor.<br>
The customary additives, such as stabilizers,<br>
antioxidants, lubricants, fillers, pigments,<br>
14<br><br>
plasticizers, etc., may be added to the<br>
polymerization mixture. If desired/ small amounts<br>
of antioxidants, such as alkylated phenols, e.g.,<br>
2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol, phosphates such as<br>
trinonyl phenyl phosphite and mixtures.containing<br>
tri (mono and dinonyl phenyl) phosphates, may be<br>
included in the feed stream. Such materials, in<br>
general, may be added at any stage during the<br>
polymerization process.<br>
A polymerization reactor that can be used in<br>
producing the styrenic resin composition of the<br>
invention is similar to that disclosed in the<br>
aforesaid U.S. Patent Nos. 2,769,804 and 2,989,517,<br>
the teachings of which patents are incorporated in<br>
their entirety herein by reference. These<br>
configurations are adapted for the production, in a<br>
continuous manner, of solid, moldable polymers and<br>
copolymers of vinylidene compounds, particularly<br>
that of monovinyl aromatic compounds, i.e. styrene.<br>
Of these two arrangements, that of U.S. Patent No.<br>
2,769,804 is particularly preferred.<br>
In general, the arrangement of U.S. Patent No.<br>
2,769,804 provides for an inlet or inlets for the<br>
monomers or feedstock connected to the<br>
polymerization reactor vessel. The reactor vessel<br>
is surrounded by a jacket, which has an inlet and an<br>
outlet for passage of a temperature control fluid<br>
through the vessel, and a mechanical stirrer. A<br>
valve line leads from a lower section of the vessel<br>
and connects with a devolatilizer, which may be any<br>
of the devices known in the art for the continuous<br>
vaporization and removal of volatile components from<br>
15<br><br>
the formed resin exiting the vessel. For example,<br>
the devolatilizer may be a vacuum chamber through<br>
which thin streams of heated resin material pass, or<br>
a set of rolls tor milling the heated polymer inside<br>
of a vacuum chamber, etc. The devolatilizer is<br>
provided with usual means such as a gear pump for<br>
discharging the residual heat-plastified polymer<br>
from the devolatilizer through the outlet of the<br>
reactor vessel. A vapor line leads from the<br>
devolatilizer to a pump, which serves to compress<br>
the vapors and cause return of the recovered<br>
volatiles, e.g. monomeric material, preferably in<br>
liquid condition through a line which leads from the<br>
pump and connects with an inlet line to the reactor<br>
vessel.<br>
In general, the arrangement for producing the<br>
styrenic resin composition will be comprised of at<br>
least three apparatuses. These are a polymerization<br>
reactor vessel assembly that may consist of one or<br>
more reactor vessels, a devolatilizing system, and a<br>
pelletizer. As discussed hereinabove, in some<br>
preferred processes of the invention, the polybutene<br>
is added to the polymer at one of three locations,<br>
i.e. to the reactor vessel; after the reactor vessel<br>
and prior to the devolatilizing system; or in a<br>
pelletizing extruder wherein compounding or mixing<br>
of the polybutene into the polymer occurs.<br>
More particularly, a first method for preparing<br>
the styrenic resin composition of the invention is<br>
to prepare a solution of the components, i.e. the<br>
polybutene, maleic anhydride, rubber, and optionally<br>
an antioxidant and to dissolve this solution in<br>
16<br><br>
styrene monomer which then is fed continuously to a<br>
polymerization reactor vessel that is equipped with<br>
a turbine agitator similar to that described in the<br>
preceding paragraph. The initiator may be added to<br>
the reactor vessel in a second stream. The reactor<br>
is stirred so that the contents are well mix and the<br>
temperature is maintained by the cooling fluid<br>
 flowing in the reactor jacket. The exit stream is<br>
continuously fed into the devolatilizer (first<br>
extruder), and the final product is pelletized.<br>
A second method involves adding the polybutene<br>
and the styrene maleic anhydride rubber feed<br>
separately to the polymerization reactor vessel and . <br>
then polymerizing the feed in the presence of the<br>
polybutene and the rubber followed by devolatilizing<br>
the stream that exits the reactor vessel. The<br>
finished product may be pelletized after the<br>
devolatilizing system.<br>
A third method involves forming a solution of<br>
maleic anhydride and rubber in styrene monomer,<br>
continuously feeding this solution with the styrene<br>
monomer into the polymerization reactor vessel to<br>
produce a partially polymerized styrenic syrup, and<br>
adding the polybutene to the partially polymerized<br>
syrup as it exits the reactor vessel and prior to<br>
this syrup entering the devolatilizing system. The<br>
finished product may be pelletized after the<br>
devolatilizing system.<br>
A fourth method involves forming a solution of<br>
maleic anhydride and rubber in styrene monomer,<br>
continuously feeding the solution with the styrene<br>
monomer into a polymerization reactor vessel to<br>
17<br><br>
produce a partially polymerized styrenic syrup,<br>
devolatilizing the stream exiting the polymerization<br>
reactor vessel, and compounding or mixing the<br>
polybutene into the polymer stream either in an in<br>
line extruder followed by pelletizing or in a<br>
separate extrusion step after the rubber modified<br>
styrene maleic anhydride (SMA) copolymer has been<br>
pelletized.<br>
The polymerization generally occurs at a<br>
conversion of from 20 to 95%.<br>
The styrenic resin composition is suitable for<br>
extrusion into sheet or film. The sheet is<br>
beneficially employed for thermoforming into food .<br>
containers especially those which are heatable in<br>
microwave ovens.<br>
The following examples are intended to assist<br>
in understanding the present invention, however, in<br>
no way should these examples be interpreted as<br>
limiting the scope thereof.<br>
In the Examples, the formed resins were<br>
injection molded into test specimens, which were<br>
tested by the following methods. The elongation at<br>
break was measured by ASTM-D638; the I20D notched<br>
impact was measured by ASTM-D256; the VICAT heat<br>
distortion temperature was measured by ASTM-D1525;<br>
the Deflection Temperature Under Load (DTUL) was<br>
measured by ASTM-D648 on specimens annealed at 70°C<br>
with 264 psi flexural stress; and the Instrumented<br>
Impact was measured by ASTM D-3763 with a 38 mm<br>
diameter hole clamp. The results are tabulated in<br>
the Tables below.<br>

EXAMPLES•<br>
The Examples illustrate styrenic resins formed<br>
by adding polybutene to the reactive mixture in a <br>
polymerization reactor. Polybutene H100 has a<br>
number average molecular weight of 910. Polybutene -.<br>
H300 has a number average molecular weight of 1300*<br>
Both Polybutene H100 and Polybutene H300 are <br>
products of BP-Amoco. The comparative examples, <br>
Comparative A, B, C, and D, do not contain<br>
polybutene.<br>
Example 1<br>
A solution containing 4.2% maleic anhydride,<br>
1.6% polybutene H100 (BP-Amoco), 7.5% butadiene<br>
rubber, and 0.16% antioxidant (ANOX PP18, which is<br>
octadecycyl-3-(3',5'-di-tert-butyl-4'-<br>
hydroxyphenyl)propionate (obtained through Great<br>
Lakes Chemical Corp.) was dissolved in styrene<br>
monomer, and then fed continuously to a completely<br>
filled polymerization reactor equipped with a<br>
turbine agitator similar to that of U.S. Patent No.<br>
2,769,804. Benzoyl peroxide initiator, 0.01% of the<br>
main stream, was added into the reactor in a<br>
separate stream. The reactor was stirred so that it<br>
was well mixed. The reacting mass was maintained at<br>
126°C by cooling through the reactor jacket. The<br>
average residence time in the reactor was 2.7 hours.<br>
The exit stream contained 52% polymer and was then<br>
fed continuously into a devolatilizer in which the<br>
unreacted monomer was removed. The resultant resin<br>
contained 8% maleic anhydride, 15% butadiene rubber<br>
and 2.5% polybutene. Some of the polybutene was<br>
removed in the devolatilizing process. The final<br>
19<br><br>
product was pelletized and molded into test<br>
specimens and testing was done using the methods<br>
outlined hereinabove.<br>
The physical properties for the test specimens<br>
for Comparative A and Example.1 appear in Table 1.<br>

similar to that for Example 1 except polybutene was<br>
not incorporated therein. '<br>

The presence of polybutene improved the overall<br>
balance of properties. For example, toughness was<br>
improved as indicated by IZOD, strain at break, and<br>
instrumented impact properties without any negative<br>
impact on tensile strength and flex modulus.<br>

used in the polymerization. The physical properties<br>
for the test specimen obtained in Example 2 are<br>
shown in Table 2 and are compared to Comparative B<br>

The results illustrate that the toughness and<br>
elongation properties of the resin of Example 2,<br>
which contains polybutene improved when compared to<br>
the Comparative B specimen, which does not contain<br>
polybutene.<br>

The procedure of Example 2 was repeated except<br>
that 3% polybutene H100 (BP-Amoco) was used in the<br>
initial solution and all the maleic anhydride was<br>
added to the first reactor. The final resin<br>
contained 3% polybutene. The physical properties for<br>
the Example 3 specimen are shown in Table 3 and are<br>
21<br><br>
compared to Comparative C specimen. Comparative C<br>

Examples 4-9 illustrate that both Polybutene H-<br>
100 and Polybutene H-300 result in improved<br>
properties. Polybutene improved the overall balance ,<br>
of properties. In general, the toughness was<br>
improved without any negative impact on tensile<br>
strength and the Young's modulus.<br>
Examples 1-9 show that polybutene improves the<br>
physical properties of the rubber modified<br>
styrenic/maleic anhydride copolymer and that this<br>
improvement is not necessarily a function of the<br>
rubber particle size. That is, a rubber particle<br>
size of 4.4 microns in Example 1, a rubber particle<br>
size of 5.0 microns in Example 2 and a rubber<br>
particle size of 10.1 microns in Example 3 all<br>
result in improved toughness and elongation<br>
properties of the resin.<br>
