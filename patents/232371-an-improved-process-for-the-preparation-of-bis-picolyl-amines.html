				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of bis(picolyl) amines useful for the selective removal of metal ion application. The bis(picolyl) amines having general formula 1 in the drawing accompanying this specification wherein R = (2-picolyl), (3-picolyl) prepared by the process of this invention are useful in selective removal of metal ions in mixed stream of other metal ions.<br>
The bis(picolyl) amines prepared by the process of this invention can be further reacted under suitable reaction conditions with macroporous polymer to prepare new chelating polymers useful in the selective removal of capper ions in mixed streams of other metal ions such as nickel, iron and the like.<br>
Selective removal of metal ions are useful in mining and easing environmental problems such as pollution due to metal ion contamination in a stream. In the hydrometal lurg ica'J. applications to remove copper from ores, use of chelating resins with specific copper ion selectivity is desired. The selectivity is desired in mixed stream of other metal ions to be economically viable. Although chelating resins for the selective removal of copper ions in mixed stream are known, the disadvantages are in terms of higher selectivity, choice of pH in these operations and the overall process economics.<br>
In mining operations, dilute solutions of copper are obtained when in-situ acid leaching of the ores is carried out. The pH of the solution is in the acidic range (pH 3 or less). Microbial leaching leads to pH of the solution in the range of 3 to 6.<br>
One of the important criteria for the effective use of the chelating ligand is that it should be possible to bind it onto polymer support for more efficient use. The chelating ligand should be stable during operation of incorporation onto the polymer matrix. There should also be no loss of activity or selectivity so the effective chelating capacity is retained.<br>
The known process for the synthesis of bispicolyl amines involves the use of expensive chloromethyl pyridine hydrochloride. This material is also not a very stable compound.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of novel bis(picolyl) amines useful in selective removal of copper ions in mixed stream containing other metal ions in acidic pH  range.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of novel bis(picolyl) amines that overcomes the drawbacks cited above.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of bis (picolyl) amine, which comprises; characterised in that reacting 2-/3-picolyl amine with the 2-/3-pyridine carboxaldehyde in the ratio of 1:1 (w/w) in dry alcohol, in the presence of conventional drying agent at a temperature in the range of 25 to 35°C, for a period ranging from 60 to 90 minutes, filtering the solution to remove the drying agent, concentrating the solution by removing alcohol under reduced pressure to get the N-2/3-pyridylidene-pyridine-2/3- methanamine, dissolving the N-2/3-pyridylidene-pyridine-2/3-methanamine in a polar solvent in the presence of a reducing      agent  as herein described, at     a     temperature     in the range of 25 to<br>
150°C, filtering the mixture, removing the alcohol under reduced pressure, adding dilute hydrochloric acid to bring the pH to 4 to get the trihydrochloride, dissolving the precipitate in water, neutralising the solution using an alkali metal bicarbonate, extracting with an aliphatic chlorinated solvent and removing aliphatic chlorinated solvent under reduced pressure to get the bis (picolyl) amines.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the picolyl amine used may be such as 2-picolyl amine, 3-picolyl amine.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, the corresponding pyridine carboxaldehyde used may be such as 2-pyridine carboxaldehyde, 3-pyridine carboxaldehyde.<br>

In another feature of the invention, the drying agent used may be such as molecular sieves, magnesium sulphate, sodium sulphate,<br>
In	yet    another embodiment of the invention, the<br>
reducing	agent      used       may     be     alkali     metal       borohydride       selected<br>
from    sodium   borohydride,    sodium borocyanide,    lithium   aluminium    hydride    or<br>
hydrogen under pressure in the range of 150 to 22.0 J ^si in presence of catalyst such as freshly prepared Raney nickle catalyst, pallidium cat'bon.<br>
