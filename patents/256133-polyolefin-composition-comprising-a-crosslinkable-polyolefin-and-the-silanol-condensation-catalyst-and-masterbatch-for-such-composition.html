The present invention relates to a polyolefm composition comprising a<br>
crosslinkable polyolefm with hydrolysable silane groups and a silanol<br>
condensation catalyst, a master batch for a crosslinkable polyolefm com-<br>
position comprising a polymer and a silanol condensation catalyst, a<br>
stabilized polyolefm containing cross-linked silane groups wherein cross-<br>
linking has been performed by the use of a silanol condensation catalyst,<br>
and to the use of a stabilizer mixture for stabilizing a polyolefm compo-<br>
sition comprising a crosslinkable polyolefm with hydrolysable silane<br>
groups and a silanol condensation catalyst. The polyolefm composition of<br>
the invention can be used for pipe, wire &amp; cable, film, fibre and moulding<br>
applications.<br>
It is known to cross-link polyolefins by means of additives as this improves<br>
the properties of the polyolefm such as mechanical strength and chemical<br>
heat resistance. Cross-linking may be performed by condensation of silanol<br>
groups contained in the polyolefm which can be obtained by hydrolysation<br>
of silane groups. A silane compound can be introduced as a cross-linkable<br>
group e.g. by grafting the silane compound onto a polyolefm, or by copoly-<br>
merisation of olefin monomers and silane group containing monomers.<br>
Such techniques are known e.g. from US 4,413,066, US 4.297,310, US<br>
4,351,876, US 4,397,981, US 4,446,283 and US 4,456,704.<br>
For cross-linking of such polyolefins, a silanol condensation catalyst must<br>
be used. Conventional catalysts are for example tin-organic compounds<br>
such as dibutyl tin dilaurate (DBTDL). It is further known that the cross-<br><br>
linking process advantageously is carried out in the presence of acidic<br>
silanol condensation catalysts. In contrast to the conventional tin-organic<br>
catalysts the acidic catalysts allow cross-linking to quickly take place<br>
already at room temperature. Such acidic silanol condensation catalysts are<br>
disclosed for example in WO 95/17463. The contents of this document is<br>
enclosed herein by reference.<br>
The silanol condensation catalyst usually is added to the silane-group con-<br>
taining polymer by compounding the polymer with a so-called master<br>
batch, in which the catalyst, and optionally further additives are contained<br>
in a polymer, e.g. polyolefin, matrix in concentrated form.<br>
However, it is a problem that such silanol condensation catalyst containing<br>
master batches, in particular master batches which contain an acidic, e.g. a<br>
sulphonic acid, catalyst, suffer from a typical yellow/brownish colour, i.e. a<br>
discoloration, as compared to the colourless matrix polymer as such.<br>
It is furthermore known that it is necessary to add stabilizers to a polyolefin<br>
in order to ensure its long-term stability. In particular, stabilizers are added<br>
to the polyolefin which protect it from degradation caused by thermal<br>
oxidation, UV-radiation, processing, oxidative degradation and by<br>
penetration of metal ions, such as copper ions.<br>
The stabilizer usually is added to the polyolefin together with the silanol<br>
condensation catalyst with the master batch. However, it has been found<br>
that typical stabilizers used, such as the butylated reaction product of p-<br>
cresol and dicyclopentadiene (Lowinox CPL ™) or l,3,5-tri-methyl-2,4,6-<br>
tris-(3,5-di-tert.butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)benzene (Irganox 1330 ™), drama-<br>
tically increase the discoloration of the master batch, i.e. dramatically<br><br>
deepen the yellow/brownish colour of the master batch. Even a polymer<br>
without an antioxidant gets brownish from the catalyst.<br>
As a result of the discoloration of the master batch, also the final products,<br>
i.e. the silane-group containing polyolefm after having been compounded<br>
with the master batch, show a yellow/brownish colour. Such a discolor-<br>
ation, however, is highly undesired because the final product appears<br>
degraded or appears degraded in a relative short time, and furthermore the<br>
product it is difficult to pigment, at least to yield light colours.<br>
It is therefore a first object of the present invention to provide an additive<br>
mixture for a silane-group containing polyolefin comprising a silanol<br>
condensation catalyst, in particular an acidic silanol condensation catalyst,<br>
which decreases the discoloration of the master batch, if used, and, even<br>
more importantly, decreases discoloration of the final product.<br>
Furthermore, it is known that for a stabilised polyolefin, the oxygen<br>
induction time (OIT) is a crucial parameter. The longer the OIT, the better<br>
is the stabilisation of the polymer, and hence a long OIT is desirable.<br>
It is accordingly a second object of the present invention to provide an<br>
additive mixture for a silane-group containing polyolefin comprising a<br>
silanol condensation catalyst, in particular an acidic silanol condensation<br>
catalyst, which shows an increased OIT.<br>
Of course, the components of the additive mixture must furthermore not<br>
cause exudation problems, must not give rise to bad smell and must not<br>
inhibit the activity of the catalyst.<br><br>
It has now surprisingly been found that the above objects can be achieved<br>
by an additive mixture which in addition to a silanol condensation catalyst<br>
comprises a P-containing compound and, optionally, an usual antioxidant.<br>
The present invention therefore provides a polyolefin composition<br>
comprising a crosslinkable polyolefin with hydrolysable silane groups and<br>
a silanol condensation catalyst, characterized in that it further comprises:<br>
(A)	a compound containing one or more<br>
POm(OnR)(OoR')(OpR") groups, wherein<br>
R, R', and R" are the same or different organic<br>
residues; m is 0 or 1; n, o, and p each are 0 or 1; and<br>
n + o + p=I to3.<br>
It has been found that the polyolefin composition according to the<br>
invention shows an significantly improved discoloration behaviour, i.e. the<br>
yellow/brownish discoloration does not appear or is at least significantly<br>
reduced. Thus, compound (A) can also be designated as acting as a<br>
"whitener" or a discoloration co-agent. At the same time, compound (A)<br>
acts as a process stabilizer that is active in the compounding and cross-<br>
linking step.<br>
Preferably, the polyolefin composition of the invention comprises<br>
(B)	a non-phosphorous containing antioxidant.<br>

The hydrolysable silane groups may be introduced into the polyolefin by<br>
copolymerization of e.g. ethylene monomers with silane group containing<br>
comonomers or by grafting, i.e. by chemical modification of the polymer<br>
by addition of silane groups mostly in a radical reaction. Both techniques<br>
are well known in the art.<br><br>
Preferably, the silane group containing polyolefin has been obtained by<br>
copolymerization. In the case of polyolefms, preferably polyethylene, the<br>
copolymerization is preferably carried out with an unsaturated silane<br>
compound represented by the formula<br><br>

propionyloxy or an alkyl-or arylamino group; and R2, if present, is a<br>
methyl, ethyl, propyl, decyl or phenyl group.<br>
A preferred unsaturated silane compound is represented by the formula<br><br>

The copolymerization of the olefin, e.g. ethylene, and the unsaturated<br>
silane compound may be carried out under any suitable conditions resulting<br>
in the copolymerization of the two monomers.<br>
Moreover, the copolymerization may be implemented in the presence of<br>
