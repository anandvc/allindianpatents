BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field Of The Invention<br>
This invention relates to photoresist compositions, a hardened form thereof, and metal patterns therefrom that are suited for use in the fabrication of MEMS (micro-electromechanical system) components, micromachine components, microfluidic components, (μ-TAS (micro total analysis system) components, ink-jet printer components, microreactor components, electroconductive layers, metallic bump connections, LIGA components, forms and stamps for micro injection molding and microembossing, screens or stencils for fine printing applications, MEMS and semiconductor packaging components, and printed wiring boards that can be processed by ultraviolet (UV) lithography.<br>
2.	Brief Description Of Prior Art<br>
Photoimageable coatings are currently used in a wide variety of semiconductor and micromachining applications. In such applications, photoimaging is accomplished by exposing the coating on a substrate to patterned radiation thereby inducing a solubility change in the coating such that the exposed or unexposed regions can be selectively removed by treatment with a suitable developer composition. The photoimageable coating (photoresist) may be either of the positive or negative type, where exposure to radiation either respectively increases or decreases the solubility in the developer. Advanced packaging applications requiring solder bumps with a high aspect ratio (defined as the height to width ratio of the imaged feature), or applications involving the fabrication of micro-electromechanical devices (MEMS) often require photoimageable compositions capable of producing uniform spin-coated films and high aspect ratio images with vertical sidewall profiles in films with a thickness greater than ten microns.<br>
Devices in which micromechanical elements, electronic circuits including radiofrequency elements, and optical elements are assembled are called MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems) or micromachines. Many applications of these have been studied and they have been put into practical use. (see Year 2002, issued by Micromachine (Ltd.) Industrial Technology Service Center.) Although these<br><br>
devices, which are based on semiconductor technology, are small, they are complex and this name is generally given to devices having high-order function and represents the basic technology that constitutes important components that are keys to systems such as various types of sensors, printer heads, disk heads, communications light switches, and biochips.<br>
Conventional positive photoresists based on diazonaphthaquinone-novolac chemistry are not well-suited to applications requiring film thicknesses greater than about 50 microns. This thickness limitation is caused by the relatively high optical absorbance of the diazonaphthaquinone-type (DNQ) photoactive compounds at wavelengths in the near-ultraviolet region of the optical spectrum (350-450 nm) which are typically used to expose the photoresist. Also, DNQ-type photoresists possess limited contrast, or differential solubility, of the exposed vs. unexposed photoresist in a developer solution which results in relief image sidewalls that are sloped rather than vertical. Optical absorption necessarily reduces the radiation intensity as it traverses from the top to the bottom of the film, such that if the optical absorption is too high, the bottom of the film will be underexposed relative to the top, causing a sloped or otherwise distorted profile of the developed image. Nevertheless, DNQ resist formulations are available for use at film thicknesses up to 100 microns, but at a great increase in the required exposure dose.<br>
A negative, spin-coated, thick-film photoimageable composition of the chemically amplified type, which has a very low optical absorbance at wavelengths in the 350-450 nm range has been described in the literature [N. LaBianca and J. D. Gelorme, "High Aspect Ratio Resist for Thick Film Applications", Proc. SPIE, vol. 2438, p. 846 (1995)]. High aspect ratio (&gt;10:1) photoimaging was demonstrated in 200 micron thick films. This resist comprises a solution in a casting solvent of a highly branched, octafunctional epoxy-novolac resin, EPON® SU-8 from Resolution Performance Products, and a photoacid generator (PAG) such as CYRACURE® UVI 6974 from Dow Chemical which consists of a mixture of arylsulfonium hexafiuoroantimonate salts. The resulting photoresist formulation may be spin coated or curtain coated onto a wide variety of substrates, pre-baked to evaporate solvent, leaving a solid photoresist coating of one hundred microns or greater thickness which may be photoimaged by exposure to near-ultraviolet radiation through a patterned photomask using contact, proximity, or projection exposure methods. Subsequent immersion of the imaged layer in a developer solvent dissolves away the unexposed<br><br>
regions, leaving behind a high resolution, negative-tone relief image of the photomask in the film.<br>
EPON® SU-8 resin is a low molecular weight epoxy-functional oligomer that has several characteristics making it advantageous for high aspect ratio photoimaging in thick films: (1) it has a high average epoxide functionality (eight), (2) a high degree of branching, (3) high transparency at wavelengths of 350-450 nm, and (4) the molecular weight is sufficiently low as to allow preparation of high solids coating compositions. The high functionality and branching result in efficient crosslinking under the influence of strong acid catalysts, while the high transparency allows uniform irradiation through thick films, making the resist capable of forming images with aspect ratio of greater than 10:1 at film thicknesses of greater than 100 microns. In fact, only high epoxy functionality and a high degree of branching will provide the high aspect ratio structures with straight sidewalls.<br>
Suitable photoacid generators based on sulfonium or iodonium salts are well-known and have been extensively discussed in the literature [see for example, Crivello et al., "Photoinitiated Cationic Polymerization with Triarylsulfonium Salts", Journal of Polymer Science: Polymer Chemistry Edition, vol. 17, pp. 977-999 (1979).]<br>
Other useful PAGs with appropriate absorbance include the carbonyl-p-phenylene thioethers as described in US Patents 5,502,083 and 6,368,769. Additionally, sensitizers such as 2-alkyl-9,10-dimethoxyanthracenes or various naphthalene, peryl or pyryl compounds can be added to the formulation or incorporated into the PAG as described in US Patent 5,102,772. Negative photoresists based on the above disclosed compositions which are suitable for spin-coating are sold by MicroChem Corp., Newton, MA, USA and are used commercially, especially in the fabrication of MEMS devices. For example, a product typically offered by MicroChem, "SU-8 50" can be spin-coated at 1000-3000 rpm to produce films of thickness in the range of 30-100 microns, which after exposure and solvent development, can produce images having an aspect ratio greater than 10:1 at film thicknesses greater than 100 microns. Higher or lower solids versions extend the film thickness range obtainable by a single coat process to less than 1 micron and above 200 microns. Casting of the solution can result in films of 1 to 2 mm or more in thickness. US Patent No. 4,882,245 also describes the application of these materials as a dry film photoresist when coated onto a carrier medium such as Mylar film.<br><br>
A pattern-forming method based on X-ray lithography and which is called the "LIGA process," is frequently used in the process of manufacture of MEMS devices (Kobunshi, High Polymers, 43, p 564 (1994). "LIGA" is a German term and is the abbreviation of Lithographic (lithography) Galvanoformung (electrodeposition) Abformung (molding). This process comprises the application of X-ray photoresists such as PMMA photoresists, an X-ray irradiation process, a solvent development process, a metal plating process and a resist pattern removal or "stripping" process. An alkali developable plating resist in which X-ray lithography is used has been proposed as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Early Disclosure No. 9-90609 [1997]).<br>
The "LIGA" process, which uses X-ray lithography, has the drawbacks that an expensive X-ray device is necessary, that X-ray irradiation takes a long time, and that development time is long. Because the X-ray LIGA process cannot satisfy the demands for saving resources, increasing workability, and increasing productivity which have become topics of discussion in recent years, there has been the desire for a LIGA process using less expensive and high throughput ultraviolet lithography systems. Many plating resists for use in UV lithography have been developed for use in printed circuit boards. Because they have comparatively small aspect ratios, there has been demand for new photoresists having characteristics suited for MEMS and micromachine fabrication.<br>
Photoresists as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Early Disclosure No. 5-45880 [1993], Japanese Patent Application Early Disclosure No. 6-204,150 [1993] and Japanese Patent Application Early Disclosure No. 11-315,384 [1999] are cited as photoresists for electroplating that can be processed by UV lithography.<br>
While the SU-8 resin based compositions that have been disclosed are capable of very high resolution and aspect ratio, the cured resin has a tendency to be brittle, and often undergoes developer induced crazing/cracking, stress-induced cracking, has limited adhesion to certain substrates, and sometimes demonstrates delamination of the coating from the substrate. All these problems are exacerbated by the shrinkage induced stress that occurs when the material undergoes polymerization and is manifested in substrate bowing, where shrinkage of the coating induces bending (bowing) of the substrate. Further, SU-8 based photoresists must be developed with organic solvents or organic solvent mixtures and the imaged resists are so highly<br><br>
crosslinked after imaging that it is virtually impossible to remove the imaged photoresist with common strippers or other removal methods.<br>
There have been many other prior art proposals for different photoimageable compositions including many that use epoxies. Examples of these can be found as referenced in US Patent 5,264,325. Here it is further taught that the photoresist material must be formulated such that it can be applied by coating methods, for example spin coating, which requires certain rheological properties. In addition, the composition must have the properties of providing sufficient transmission of the exposing radiation so as to photolyze the photoinitiator through the thickness of the film, and the photoresist must possess appropriate physical and chemical properties to withstand the application, such as electroplating or etch resistance, without significant degradation, or loss of adhesion.<br>
Photoresist compositions that provide latent images that may be developed using aqueous solutions of organic and inorganic bases are of particular interest due to the interest in the electronics industry in using chemicals that more environmentally acceptable than organic solvents. US Patents 4,994,346, 5,079129, and 5,397,685 describe negative tone, epoxide containing, solder mask compositions that can be developed with aqueous base solutions. US Patent 5,120,633 describes photoresist compositions based on polymers bearing acid-labile protecting groups that are rendered soluble in aqueous base solution through the action of photochemically produced acids.<br>
However, no specific type of epoxy resin has been found which will satisfy all of the various requirements; however many different combinations or mixtures of various epoxy resins have been disclosed. All of the noted patents describe various resins and photoinitiators for use in photocurable compositions, many of which are useful as photoimageable layers in permanent applications. However none of them teach or suggest the aqueous base developable, readily strippable compositions of the present invention nor are they suitable for the intended applications.<br>
It is therefore desirable to provide a photoimageable formulation containing both epoxide groups and an aqueous alkaline soluble functionality in the same resin that may be cured with a photosensitive cationic initiator while retaining the good image resolution, high aspect ratio and straight sidewalls of SU-8 based photoresist formulations but at the same time allows the photoresist to be developed in a typical<br><br>
aqueous alkali based photoresist developer and allows the ready removal of the patterned photoresist after the post imaging processes have been carried out.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention provides photoresists for plating and hardened forms thereof with which pattern forming is easily accomplished using ultraviolet lithography as a result of the fact that the photoresists contain an epoxy resin of a specified structure and a cationic photopolymerization initiator and have properties suited to MEMS, micromachines, bump interconnects, or other microelectronic plating and etching applications.<br>
One aspect of the present invention is directed to a photoresist composition comprising: one or more cationically polymerizable Resin Components (A) bearing in their structures epoxide groups and carboxylic acid groups wherein Resin Component A is described by the following Formula 1;<br><br>

wherein groups R, R', and R" are individually selected from the groups consisting of monomeric, oligomeric or polymeric organic bridging groups, with one or more photoacid generator compounds (B), and one or more solvents (C).<br>
These bridging groups preferably include, but are not limited to, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aryl, polyaryl, alkyl-aryl, fused cycloaliphatic, fused aryl, and fused alkyl-aryl groups.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is directed to a dry film photoresist material made from this photoresist composition.<br>
Still another aspect of the present invention is directed to a method of forming metal patterns from this photoresist composition.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The photoresist compositions of the present invention are comprised of: one or more cationically polymerizable Resin Components (A) bearing in their structures epoxide groups and carboxylic acid groups; one or more photoacid generator compounds (B), and one or more solvents (C).<br>
The Resin Component A has been specifically designed and optimized to provide the high aspect ratio, vertical side-wall structures, processability in aqueous developers, and ease of stripping required by current and emerging MEMS and microelectronic applications. According to the invention, Resin Component A contains both epoxide and carboxylic acid groups. The epoxide equivalent weight of Resin Component A may be from 100 g/eq to 1000 g/eq and the acid value, determined titrametrically, should be between 10 to 200 mg KOH/g.    The epoxide groups bonded to Resin Component (A) may be polymerized by the action of a strong acid to yield a product that is insoluble in solvents in which the non-crosslinked material is soluble. The acid catalyzed or cationic polymerization of Resin Component (A) may be initiated by the strong acids produced by the reactions of photoacid generator compound (B) that are induced by absorption of radiant energy of suitable wavelength by the photoacid generator compound (B). By irradiating a dried film of the photoresist composition image-wise through a mask, an image of the mask may be transferred into the film. The presence of the correct amount of carboxylic acid groups in the resin imparts good solubility in aqueous, alkaline developing solutions to Resin Component (A). Because the crosslinked products of Resin Component (A) are not soluble in aqueous, alkaline developing solutions, this property provides a means for developing a negative tone, relief image in the resist by dissolving the unexposed material with an aqueous, alkaline developer solution. In addition, the crosslinked product of the composition is not soluble in selected organic solvents in which Resin Component (A) is soluble and this attribute provides, as an additional means for developing the relief image, the ability to develop the image in an organic solvent or organic solvent mixture.<br>
The general method of preparation of Resin Component (A) is through the catalyzed or non-catalyzed reaction of a suitably selected Resin Component (I) containing at least two or more epoxide groups per molecule with a carboxylic acid<br>
compound (II) containing one carboxylic acid group and at least one hydroxyl group to provide a product resin (III) containing epoxide groups and hydroxyl groups. In a second reaction, the epoxide resin containing hydroxyl groups (III) is reacted with compound (IV) containing at least one cyclic, dibasic anhydride group to provide Resin Component (A) as the reaction product in solution. The general scheme for preparing Resin Component (A) is illustrated by the generic structures shown in (Table Removed)<br>
The groups R, R', and R" shown in Scheme 1 are any suitable oligomeric or polymeric organic bridging group including, but not limited to, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aryl, polyaryl, alkyl-aryl, fused cycloaliphatic, fused aryl, and fused alkyl-aryl.

Adhesion promoting agents can include, for example, various types of leveling agents and silane coupling agents. Although 0.5 to 30 weight % is the provisional standard, the quantity of optional additives can be adjusted depending on the appropriate objective of use.<br>
The photoresist compositions of the present invention can be prepared by compounding together components (A), (B), and (C) and optional components (D) though (G) and when necessary, inorganic filler and other additives, preferably according to the above-mentioned ratios, and mixing them uniformly to provide the photoresist composition as a solution or dispersion. Compounding may be done using sealed containers mixed on rolling mills or in mixing tanks equipped with mechanical mixers, or similar devices known in the compounding art. It is particularly preferred that the resist compositions according to the invention are diluted with solvent component (C) to adjust the viscosity of the composition to a value appropriate to the intended use of the composition.<br>
In order to use the photoresist compositions according to the invention, a coating of the composition is applied to a substrate at a thickness ranging from 100 nm to 1000 urn. The coated substrate is then heated at 60 to 140°C for 5 to 60 minutes to remove the solvent and provide a substantially dry coating on the substrate. The dried coating is then irradiated image-wise through a mask with active radiation at a dose of 10 to 30,000 ml/cm to provide a pattern in the coating. A heat treatment step, also known in the art as a post exposure bake, is then performed for 3 to 30<br>
minutes at 50 to 150°C, after which the portion not exposed to light is dissolved by treating the coated substrate for 1 to 30 minutes with a developing solution. The developed image may be rinsed with a suitable rinse solution to remove residual developer. As may be required in certain embodiments and to harden the patterned layer, the patterned resist layer is heat-treated for 1 to 60 minutes at 100 to 200°C and then electrolytic or non-electrolytic plating of copper, nickel, gold or solder is effected. Following platting, the resist pattern is removed from the substrate using a stripping solution, by which means a metal pattern that satisfies various requirements of the intended application is obtained on the substrate.<br>
When using the resist compositions of the present invention, the photoresist solution may be applied to a substrate by spin-coating, consisting of dispensing the liquid resist onto a substrate, accelerating the substrate to a constant rotational speed, and holding the rotation speed constant to achieve the desired coating thickness. Spin-coating may be performed with variable rotational velocity in order to control the thickness of the final coating. Other coating methods may be used including dip coating, spray coating, curtain coating, gravure coating, extrusion coating, slot coating, wire rod coating, and other methods know in the art of applying solvent borne coatings to substrates. Spin coating, slot coating, and gravure coating are preferred coating methods and spin coating is the most preferred coating method.<br>
Substrate materials that can be used include, but are not limited to, silicon, silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, alumina, glass, glass-ceramics, gallium arsenide, indium phosphide, copper, aluminum, nickel, iron, steel, copper-silicon alloys, indium-tin oxide coated glass, printed wiring boards, organic films such as polyimide and polyester, any substrate bearing patterned areas of metal, semiconductor, and insulating materials, and the like. No special pre-treatment of the substrate is necessary for operation of the invention. Optionally, a bake step may be performed on the substrate to remove absorbed moisture prior to applying the resist coating. Where electroplating will be used, the substrate may be coated with a conductive layer prior to coating the photoresist composition.<br>
Suitable active rays for irradiating the photoresist layers according to the invention are ultraviolet (UV) ray, X-rays, and electron beam radiation. Ultraviolet and X-rays are the preferred active rays and ultraviolet rays emitted from mercury-arc lamps at wavelengths of 365, 405, and 436 nm are the most preferred active rays. Suitable optical filters may be used to provide single wavelength illumination through<br>
the mask. Photolithography exposure equipment that that may be used includes contact, proximity, projection, and step and repeat tools.<br>
Because Resin Component (A) of the compositions according to the invention contains carboxylic acid groups the unexposed and hence, non-cross linked, regions of the photoresist film are soluble in aqueous alkaline solutions and consequently, negative relief images may be formed by developing the image using aqueous alkaline developing solutions.<br>
The aqueous alkaline developing solutions suitable for use in the invention may be selected from a group consisting of 0.5 to 5% by weight aqueous solutions of a substance providing an alkaline solution and these substances may be, for example, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, sodium or potassium carbonate, sodium or potassium metasilicate, or sodium or potassium hydroxide. The aqueous alkaline developing solutions may further comprise additives including surfactants and water miscible organic compounds such as alcohols, amines, and alkanol amines. Aqueous solutions of tetramethylammonium hydroxide are particularly preferred.<br>
Because Resin Component (A) of the compositions according to the invention contains epoxy groups and because these epoxy groups are cationically polymerized during the exposure and post exposure bake steps, the exposed regions of the photoresist film are insoluble in many organic solvents while the unexposed and hence, non-cross linked, regions of the film are soluble in organic solvents. Consequently, negative relief images may be formed by developing the image using developing solutions comprising one or more organic solvents<br>
Developing solutions comprising one or more organic solvents suitable for use in the invention may contain one or more solvents selected from, but not limited to, the group comprising, propylene glycol methyl ether acetate, gamma-butyrolactone, acetone, cyclopentanone, diacetone alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, l-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, anisole, and ethyl lactate. The developer solvents can be used singly or as mixtures. Propylene glycol methyl ether acetate is particularly preferred as an organic solvent developer because of its good solvency for the unexposed resist components and because of its relatively low cost.<br>
The developer solvent may be applied by immersing the coated substrate in developer with agitation or by spraying using either an atomizing spray nozzle or fine shower-head type spray nozzle. Yet another method of developing the image comprises applying the developer using what is known in the photoresist art as a<br>
puddle process wherein the substrate to be developed is placed on a rotating tool head and then an amount of developer sufficient to form a standing layer or puddle on the entire substrate area is dispensed onto the substrate and allowed to stand for a defined period of time. After this time, the substrate is rotationally accelerated to spin off the spent developer and then decelerated until rotation stops. This sequence is repeated until a clear relief image is obtained and it is common to use a process wherein two to four solvent puddles are formed.<br>
When used, suitable rinse solvents include water, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and water alcohol mixtures. Water is the preferred rinse solvent when aqueous alkaline developing solutions are used and isopropanol is the preferred rinse solvent when organic solvent developing solutions are used.<br>
Stripping solvents and solutions suitable for use with the invention include 1-methyl -2-pyrrolidinone, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl acetamide, dimethyl formamide, mixtures of 1 -methyl-2-pyrrolidinone with one or more additional organic solvents, mixtures of 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone and dimethyl sulfoxide, mixtures of 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone and/or dimethyl sulfoxide with alkanolamines such as ethanolamine, diethanol amine and the like, and solutions of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or tetramethylammonium hydroxide in l-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone and/or dimethyl sulfoxide. Mixtures of 1- methyl-2-pyrrolidinone and dimethyl sulfoxide are preferred stripping solvents.<br>
The resolution of the relief pattern may be described by the aspect ratio of an image feature. The aspect ratio is defined herein as the width of the image feature divided by the thickness of the photoresist film in which the feature is formed. According to the invention, the aspect ratio should be 1 to 100 and preferably, 2 to 50.<br>
The resist compositions of the present invention can be used to manufacture dry film photoresists. To prepare a dry film photoresist, a resist composition according to the present invention is applied to a base film material using coating methods such as roller coating, doctor bar coating, slot coating, dip coating, spin coating, gravure coating, and the like. The coated base film is then dried in a drying oven set at 60 to 160°C for a time sufficient to remove the desired amount of solvent. A cover film is then applied to the resist side of the coated film to protect the film from damage and to prevent sheets of coated material from sticking together. The thickness of the resist on the base film may be adjusted to 10 to 500 um by suitable selection of solvents, resist solids content and coating parameters. Organic polymer<br>
film materials such as polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene, and polyimide can be used as the base film. Organic polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene can be used as the cover sheet material.<br>
The dry film photoresist is used by first peeling the protective cover sheet from the resist layer, placing the dry film on a substrate with the resist side in contact with the substrate, laminating the resist to the substrate by application of heat and pressure using a lamination device and then peeling the base film from the resist. These operations result in forming a photoresist layer on the substrate which may be subsequently image wise processed image-wise using the methods described herein.<br>
The hardened forms of the resin compositions of this invention obtained by the method described above are used as non-permanent resists for components such as MEMS or micromachines.<br>
For example, the photoresist compositions and the metal patterns formed using them can be used to make components for micromachines as described in Japanese Patent Application Early Disclosure No. 2000-343,463, orifice components for ink-jet heads as described in Japanese Patent Application Early Disclosure No. 2001-10,068, components of magnetic actuators (MEMS) as described in Japanese Patent Application Early Disclosure No. 2001-71,299, components of microchips for electrophoretic coupling (ja-TAS) as described in Japanese Patent Application Early Disclosure No. 2001-157,855, and, in addition, for microreactor components, electroconductive layers and metallic bump interconnects.<br>

Electrolytic tin-lead solder bath: Solder plating was carried out using a commercial solder plating solution (MX M03069 - 574A1, manufactured by ISHIHARA CHEMICAL Co., Ltd., Kobe, Japan) at 20 °C using a current density of 4A/dm2 and a total plating time of 30 minutes.   This treatment formed 30 /mi thick solder metal structures in the open areas of the photoresist pattern. No peeling of the photoresist or underplating of the photoresist pattern was observed. The results of this test are summarized in Table 1 Rowl7.<br>
Electrolytic gold bath: Gold plating was carried out using a commercial gold plating solution (EX3000, manufactured by JAPAN PURE CHEMICAL Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The results of this test are summarized in Table 1 Row 18.<br>
Resist Stripping Characteristics<br>
The plated resist structures were subject to the action of a stripping solution containing 50 parts of dimethyl sulfoxide and 50 parts of 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone for 2 hours at 80°C.   The external appearance of the structure was observed after resist stripping and evaluations were made by the following criteria:<br>
O - The entire resist peeled off the wafer, x - The resist adhered to the wafer<br>
The results for each photoresist composition are summarized in Table 1 Row 19.<br>
Example 11. Electrolytic Plating of Combined Nickel and Gold Layers<br>
The nickel plating solution was an aqueous solution containing nickel sulfamate (400 g/L), nickel chloride (30 g/L), and boric acid (20 g/L).   Nickel plating was carried out using this nickel plating solution at 55 °C using a current density of 5 A/dm2 of current and a total plating time of 30 minutes. A plated nickel structure 30 /im thick was obtained and no peeling of the photoresist or underplating of the photoresist structure was observed. The plated nickel structure was then over plated with gold using a commercial gold plating solution (EX3000, manufactured by JAPAN PURE CHEMICAL Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at 50 °C using a current density of 0.8A/dm2 and a total plating time of 6 minutes. The resulting plated metallurgy consisted of a 6 jum thick coating of gold on top of the 30 /*m thick nickel structure. No peeling of the photoresist or underplating of the photoresist pattern was observed.<br>
Docket No.: 102496-201<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
To 100 grams of the photoresist composition of Formulation Example 10 was added with 1 1 grams of cyclopentanone.   The resulting photoresist composition was applied to a thickness of 1 um on a silicon wafer substrate. The wafer was then dried for 3 minutes at 95 °C and irradiated pattern- wise with electron beam radiation using a commercial electron beam lithography system (ELS-3700, manufactured by ELIONIX Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The beam dose was 5 pC/cm2 at an accelerating voltage of 30kV.   The irradiated wafer was then baked for 5 minutes at 90°C. The image was developed by immersing the wafer in a 2.38 % by weight aqueous solution of tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide followed by rinsing with water and air drying. The resulting resist relief pattern showed resolution of 1 |^m pattern features.<br>
Example 13: Preparation and Processing of a Dry Film Resist<br>
A resin stock solution was prepared by combining 475.9 grams of a resin solution prepared according to the method of Synthesis Example 4 and 1.33 grams of FC-1 71 (3M Company) surfactant and roll mixing for one hour under the action of an infrared heat lamp. The stock solution was then filtered through a Whatman 5 micron Polycap™ 36HD capsule filter using 20 psi applied air pressure. A photoresist composition was prepared by combining 80 grams of the stock resin solution with 3.92 grams of prefiltered Cyracure UVI-6974 PAG, and 21.1 grams of prefiltered cyclopentanone solvent. The Cyracure UVI 6974 PAG and cyclopentanone solvent were prefiltered using a 0.45 micron Whatman syringe filter. The resulting photoresist composition was mixed on a rolling mill for one hour under the action of an infrared heat lamp. After this time, the lamp was turned off and mixing was continued overnight.<br>
An article of dry film photoresist was prepared by coating 5 mL of the above photoresist composition onto a 3 mil thick Kapton® film substrate using an Autodraw III coating machine equipped with a #20 Mayer rod. The resulting coating was placed on an aluminum baking sheet and was then dried in a mechanical convection oven at<br>
95 °C for 15 minutes. The thickness of the dried photoresist was determined using an ONO Sokki Digital linear gauge and was nominally 13 microns.<br>
A four-inch square piece of the article of dry film photoresist prepared above was cut and then laminated onto a 100 mm diameter silicon wafer using a Riston® Laminating Machine using a two step lamination process. In the first step and to preheat the work piece, the dry film resist was placed resist side down on the silicon wafer and the assembly was passed through the laminating machine using a roller temperature of 85 °C, an applied pressure of 0 psi, and a roller speed of 0.2 meters per minute to preheat the structure. In the second step, the preheated structure was then immediately passed through the laminating machine using a roller temperature of 85 °C, an applied pressure of 55 psi, and a roller speed of 0.2 meters per minute. The resulting laminated structure was allowed to cool and then the Kapton® substrate was peeled away by hand to provide a smooth coating of photoresist on the silicon wafer. The adhesion of the photoresist to the wafer was tested by applying a piece of office tape to the coating and then pulling the tape off. There was no adhesion loss as evidenced by no damage to the coating or any photoresist adhering to the office tape. The laminated film thickness was nominally 14 /tm and was measured optically using a SCI FilmTek thickness gauge. The photoresist was then exposed image-wise through a photomask using an AB-M mercury arc lamp source with a 360 nm long pass cut-off filter at an exposure energy of 420 mJ/cm2. The exposed resist was given a post exposure bake treatment by heating the wafer on a hotplate at 100 °C for 1 minute. The relief image was developed by immersing the wafer in Microposit® CD 26 photoresist developer for 4 minutes. A clean relief image with well resolved 10 via features was obtained.<br>
Example 14. Compatibility with ink jet printer ink.<br>
A nickel pattern formed using the resist composition of Example 1 was immersed in black ink for ink-jet printer use and was allowed to stand for 24 hours at 50°C, There were no abnormalities in the external appearance of the applied film and there were no blisters or peeling.<br>
Example 15. Formation of Solder Columns<br><br>
A photoresist relief pattern having 15 jam diameter circular features was formed using the resist composition of Example 1 and electrolytic solder plating of 50 l^m in thickness was performed, after which the resist pattern was stripped. When this was done, cylindrical soldered bumps 15 jam in diameter and 50 jum in height were formed.<br>
As is evident from the results of the evaluations summarized in Table 1, the photoresist compositions of this invention show superior patterning performance and the hardened forms thereof show superior resistance to solvents and plating chemicals and are readily removed from plated metal structures using stripper solutions. Further, because the photoresist compositions of this invention have resistance to the ink used for ink-jet printers as shown in Example 14, they show good resistance to ink jet ink and can be used for ink-jet printer heads, and, as shown in Example 15, the compositions can be used in a electroplating process for forming solder bumps. Because the plated metal patterns had aspect ratios greater than 5, the photoresist compositions of the invention are well-suited for the manufacture of MEMS and other micromachine components.<br>
While the invention has been described above with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it is apparent that many changes, modifications, and variations can be made without departing for the inventive concept disclosed herein. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such changes modifications, and variations that fall within the spirit and broad scope of the appended claims.
