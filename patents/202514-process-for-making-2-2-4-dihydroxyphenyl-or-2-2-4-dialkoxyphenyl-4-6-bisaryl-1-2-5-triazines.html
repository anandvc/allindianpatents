				<td>PROCESS FOR MAKING 2 -(2,4-DIHYDROXYPHENYL)OR 2-(2,4-DIALKOXYPHENYL)-4,6-BISARYL-l,3, 5-TRIAZINES<br>
This application claims the benefit of pending U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/099,176 filed September 4, 1998.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a new process for the preparation of 2- (2 ,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bisaryl-l,3,5-triazines or 2-(2,4-dialkoxyphenyl)-4,6-bisaryl-l,3,5-triazines.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Exposure to sunlight and other sources of ultraviolet radiation is known to cause degradation of a wide variety of materials, especially polymeric materials.  For example, polymeric materials such as plastics often discolor and/or become brittle as a result of prolonged exposure to ultraviolet light.  Accordingly, a large body of art has been developed directed towards materials such as ultraviolet light absorbers and stabilizers which are capable of inhibiting such degradation.<br>
A class of materials known to be ultraviolet light absorbers are triazines.  Triazine ultraviolet light absorbers are a class of compounds which have at least one 2-hydroxyphenyl substituent on the 1,3,5-triazine ring.<br><br><br>
Trisaryltriazine ultraviolet light absorbers are compounds which have aromatic substituents at the 2-, 4- and 6-positions of the 1,3,5-triazine ring, and in which at least one of the aromatic rings has a hydroxyl substituent at the ortho position.  These aromatic rings may contain other substituents or may be fused polyaromatics.  In general this class of compounds is well known in the art.  Disclosures of a number of such trisaryl-1,3,5-triazines, as well as processes for preparing and uses thereof, can be found in the following publications, all of which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein: U.S. patents 3,118,887, 3,242,175, 3,244,708, 3,249,608, 3,268,4 74, 3,423,360, 4,619,956, 4,740,542, 5,084,570, 5,288,778, 5,4 61,151, 5,476,937, 5,4 78,935, 5,543,518, 5,54 5,836, 5,591,850, and 5,597,854, British patent 1,033,387, Swiss patents 480,091 and 484,695, European patent applications 0,444,323 and 0,649,841, and PCX applications WO94/05645 and WO96/28431.<br>
2 -<br>
A commonly used class of trisaryl-1,3,5-triazine ultraviolet light absorbers is based on 2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bisaryl-l,3,5-triazines.  In these compounds two non-phenolic aromatic groups and one phenolic aromatic group are attached to the 1,3,5-triazine.  The phenolic aromatic group is derived from resorcinol.<br><br><br>
Of this class of compounds, a number of commercial examples exist in which the para-hydroxyl group" of the phenolic ring is functionalized and the non-phenolic aromatic rings are either unsubstituted phenyl, as in TINUVIN速 1577 or meta-xylyl, as in CYASORB速 UV-1164, CYASORB速 UV-1164L and TINUVIN速 400.  These ultraviolet light absorbers exhibit high inherent light stability and permanence as compared to other classes of ultraviolet light absorbers such as benzotriazoles and benzophenones.<br><br>
Several approaches to the production of 2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bisaryl-l, 3, 5-triazines have been reported in the literature.  For example, H. Brunetti and C.E Luethi, Helvetica Chimica Acta, vol. 55, pages 1566-1595 (1972), and S. Tanimoto and M., Yamagata, Senrvo to Yakahin, vol. 40 (12), pages 325-339 (1995).<br>
The majority of the approaches are based on cyanuric chloride, a readily available and inexpensive starting material.  Resorcinol is known to be much more reactive than meta-xylene toward cyanuric chloride, and in Y. Horikoshi et al, Nippon Kaqaku Kaishi (3), pages 530-535, (1974), CA<br>
-3-<br><br>
81:152177 it has been reported to form only the bis-resorcinol-monochloro-triazine and/or trisresorcinol triazine even when cyanuric chloride to resorcinol were used in equimolar ratios.  U.S. patent 3,270,016 describes the formation of bis-resorcinol monochloro triazine in good yield by reacting cyanuric chloride and resorcinol at about equimolar ratio at room temperature for 10 hours, with no mention of the formation of the mono-resorcinol bischloro ' triazine.  Further, German patent application DE 1,169,947 or GB 884802 as mentioned in U.S. patent 5,726,310, describes uncontrolled exothermic reaction when cyanuric chloride, meta-xylene and aluminum chloride are simultaneously introduced.<br>
In one method, shown below, cyanuric chloride is reacted with aromatic compounds, such as meta-xylene, in the presence of aluminum chloride.  The reaction produces a monochloro-bisaryl-1,3,5-triazine, which is then reacted with resorcinol in a second step to form a 2-(2, 4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bisaryl-1, 3, 5-triazine.  This process contains several limitations which relate to the first step of the reaction, namely that the first step is not selective and leads to a . mixture of all of the possible products, plus unreacted cyanuric chloride.  This means that the desired monochloro-bisaryl-1,3,5-triazine must be separated from the reaction mixture before the second reaction step takes place.  Another disadvantage is that the first reaction step is not generally applicable to all aromatic compounds.  It is well known in the literature that the use of this process gives a useful yield of the desired monochloro-bisaryl-1,3,5-triazine intermediate only when meta-xylene is the aromatic reactant.  With other aromatic species, an inseparable mixture of all possible products is formed, and no selectivity for the desired monochloro-bisaryl-1,3,5-triazine is seen. See Brunetti, page 1575.  For the meta-xylene based product, an<br>
-4-<br><br>
improved process has recently been disclosed in US5726310, in which the monochloro-bis(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine intermediate produced in the first reaction step is not isolated, but is further reacted with resorcinol in a one-pot, two-step process.  This process contains the disadvantage not only of its being applicable only to meta-xylene, but also that it is a two-step process.<br><br>
In another approach, shown below, cyanuric chloride is reacted with an aryl magnesium halide to prepare a monochloro bisaryl triazine in the first step.  The substituted triazine intermediate is isolated and subsequently reacted with resorcinol to produce a 2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bisaryl-1,3,5-triazine.  It has been reported that this approach is not selective for the monochloro-bisaryl triazine, for example, Brunetti, page 1575.  However, modifications with<br>
5<br><br>
better results have been reported, as in U.S. patent 5,438,138.  While this approach is generally applicable to many aromatic species, it: has the disadvantages of being unsuitable for industrial scale production due to the use of a highly reactive Grignard reagent, and uneconomical due to the special precautions associated with the use of Grignard reagents, and the cost of the raw materials used in these compounds.<br><br>
Alternative approaches have been developed to address the selectivity problem.  In one approach, shown below, cyanuric chloride is first reacted with one equivalent of an alcohol to produce, with high selectivity, a monoalkoxy-bischlorotriazine.  This substituted triazine is then reacted  in a second step with aromatics in the presence of aluminum chloride to prepare monoalkoxy/hydroxy-bisaryltriazines.<br>
- 6-<br><br>
These intermediates are then converted to monochloro-bisaryltriazines by reaction with thionyl chloride or phosphorus pentachloride.  The monochloro-bisaryltriazines are finally reacted with resorcinol in a fourth step to prepare the desired 2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bisaryl-1,3,5-triazine.  This approach can be applied generally to aromatic species, and the desired product is formed with selectivity, but the addition of several steps in the synthesis makes this process economically unattractive.<br>
7<br>
SCHEME 3<br><br><br>
A similar approach is described in US5106972 and US5084570, and is shown below.  Cyanuric chloride is first reacted with one equivalent of alkanethiol instead of alcohol. The remaining steps are the same as those described in the previous example.  As before, the disadvantage of this approach lies in the additional steps of the synthesis.<br>
SCHEME 4<br><br>
A modification of this approach is disclosed in Japanese patent application 09-059,263.  In this process, cyanuric chloride is first reacted with one equivalent of a substituted phenol, such as para-chlorophenol, in the presence of aluminum chloride to produce the oxygen-linked mono-phenoxy derivative of cyanuric chloride.  This intermediate is subsequently reacted with an aromatic, such as meta-xylene, and aluminum chloride to prepare 2-monophenoxy-4,6-bisaryl-l,3,5-triazine, which is subsequently<br>
- 8 -<br><br>
reacted with resorcinol and aluminum chloride in a third step to produce a 2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bisaryl-l,3, 5-triazine.  This one-pot, three-step process claims an improved yield of the desired product.  However, this method has the disadvantage of the need to use para chlorophenol, a toxic chemical, and the need to remove it from the desired product.<br>
SCHEME 5<br><br>
A further approach to the production of 2-chloro-4,6 bisaryl-1,3,5-triazines is disclosed in European patent<br>
- 9 -<br><br>
application 0,497,734.  This process involves reacting benzamidine hydrochloride with a chloroformate and dimerizing the product.  The resultant 2-hydroxy-4,6-bisaryl-l,3,5-triazine is converted to 2-chloro-4,6-bisaryl-l,3,5-triazine by treatment with thionyl chloride, and finally reaction with resorcinol to produce the 2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bisaryl-1,3,5-triazine.  Further the multi-step synthesis renders the process uneconomical for industrial use.<br>
-10<br><br><br>
-  11  -<br><br>
In addition to the approaches described above, other approaches exist which utilize benzonitriles or benzamidines as the starting material.  The use of 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, phenyl (or alkyl) 2,4-<br>
- 12 -<br>
dihydroxybenzoates and 2-aryl-l,3-benzoxazine-4-ones is shown below, and is disclosed in, for example, U.S. patents 5,705,643 and 5,478,935 and PCT application WO96/28431. These approaches have the disadvantages of the starting materials being expensive, and the possible need for additional synthetic steps in the preparation.<br><br><br><br>
It can be seen that a need exists for a novel method of production of 2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bisaryl-1,3,5-<br>
- 13 -<br><br><br>
triazxnes which is highly selective, economical, having minimal synthetic steps and need for isolation of the intermediate, and demonstrates improved safety to the chemist and to the environment.  It is the object of this invention to provide such a novel method of production.<br>

simultaneously reacting in the presence of a catalyst, sufficient amounts of a compound of Formula C:<br>
- 18 -<br><br><br>
wherein X is a halogen, a compound of Formula D:<br><br>
wherein Y, Rl, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are as described above, 15 and a compound of Formula E:<br><br>
wherein R6, R7, R8, R9 and R10 are as described above, at a suitable temperature and pressure, and for a time sufficient to produce a reaction mixture comprising the composition.<br>
This result is unexpected, since theoretically, a statistical distribution of several products would be expected to be produced from such a simultaneous reaction.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention is a process for the preparation of 2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bis(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine,<br>
- 19 -<br><br><br>
which comprises simultaneously reacting in the presence of a catalyst, sufficient amounts of a cyanuric halide, preferably cyanuric chloride; meta-xylene and resorcinol, at a suitable temperature and pressure, and for a time sufficient to produce a reaction mixture comprising the composition. The formation of the mono-resorcinol containing triazine product as the major product, with the bis-resorcinol containing triazine product formed in small amounts is contrary to expectation.<br>
The process of the present invention is a one-pot, one-step process which avoids the need to sustain the reaction mixture at different temperatures for long periods.  No significant exotherm is produced in the reaction, despite the fact that all reactants are introduced simultaneously.  The fact that no significant exotherm is observed is in contrast to the prior art, which describes uncontrolled exothermic reaction when cyanuric chloride, meta-xylene and aluminum chloride are simultaneously introduced.  Thus the process of the present invention discloses a simultaneous reaction of cyanuric chloride with aromatic species and resorcinol, which can be carried out at a relatively low temperature, with no associated safety risks.<br>
Suitable solvents for use in the process of the present invention are aliphatic hydrocarbons, halogenated aliphatic<br>
- 20 -<br><br>
and aromatic compounds, aliphatic and aromatic nitro compounds and carbon disulfide.  Preferred solvents are halogenated solvents such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane.<br>
The catalyst used in the process of the present invention is a Lewis acid catalyst.  Preferred catalysts are aluminum trihalides.  The most preferred catalyst is aluminum chloride.<br>
The process of the present invention may be carried out by combining the reactants in the reactor and bringing about the reaction.  The reaction takes place at a temperature of between about 0属C to about 120属C.  A preferred temperature range is between about 0属C to about 90属C.  The most preferred temperature range is between about 10属C to about 60属C.<br>
The amount of catalyst used is between about 1.5 to about 4 equivalents based upon the amount of the compound of Formula C.  More preferably the amount of catalyst used is between about 2 to about 3.5 equivalents based upon the amount of the compound of Formula C.  Most preferably the amount of catalyst used is between about 2.25 to 2.75 equivalents based upon the amount of the compound of Formula C.<br>
The amount of compound of Formula B used is between about 1.9 to 2.5 equivalents based upon the amount of the compound of Formula C.<br>
The amount of compound of Formula D used is between about 0.5 to 1.5 equivalents based upon the amount of the compound of Formula C.  More preferably the amount of compound of Formula D used is between about 0.9 to 1.1 equivalents based upon the amount of the compound of Formula C.<br>
The compounds used in the process of the present invention can be added to the reaction vessel in any<br>
- 21 -<br><br>
sequence.  The preferred time for the reaction is between about 2 to about 24 hours.<br>
Uses of Triazines<br>
The triazines of the present invention are<br>
particularly useful - as ultraviolet light absorber agents for stabilizing a wide variety of materials including, for example, various polymers (both crosslinked and<br>
thermoplastic), photographic materials and dye solutions for<br><br>
textile materials, as well as in ultraviolet light screening agents (such as sunscreens).

Comparative Example 1:   Reaction of cyanuric chloride, m-xylene, resorcinol, and aluminum trichioride. Use of 1.0 eq. aluminum trichioride.<br><br>
A mixture of 1.84 g cyanuric chloride (10 mmol), 2.12 g of m-xylene (2 eq.), and 1.10 g of resorcinol (1 eq.) in 20 mL chlorobenzene under a nitrogen atmosphere was cooled to 2属C.  Aluminum trichloride (2.12 g, 1 eq.) was added over 2 mm.  The mixture was then warmed to 35属C with stirring. After 22 hr., a sample was taken and quenched with ice and dilute aq. HC1.  The resulting precipitate was filtered, washed with water, dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and analyzed by HPLC.  HPLC analysis (area % at 290 nm) showed mainly tris- and bis-resorcinol containing triazine products 2,4,6-tris-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-s-triazine (1) and 2-chloro-4,6-bis-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-s-triazine (2) with no m-xylyl substitution.  The ratio of 1 to 2 was 21:78.  Unreacted m-xylene was also present.  The only triazine product containing xylene observed was bisresorcinol-triazine based 2,4-bis-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-6-(2 ,4-dimethylphenyl)-s-triazine 3.  The monoresorcinol-triazine based product, 2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bis-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-s-triazine 4 was not formed.<br>

The formation of only trisresorcinol-triazine and bisresorcinol-triazine based products is in agreement with the prior art cited before (Y. Horikoshi, et al, Nippon Kagaku Kaishi (3), 530- 5, 1974; CA 81:152177 and U.S. 3,270,016 (Ex. 6)).<br>
Example 1:  2-(2,4-Dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bis-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)s-triazine (4).  Use of 2.5 eq aluminum trichloride.<br>
To a stirring mixture of 1.84 g of cyanuric chloride, 1.1 gm of resorcinol, 2.5 mL of m-xylene and 25 mL of chlorobenzene was added 3.35 g of aluminum chloride (2.5 eq. based on cyanuric chloride) at 5属C.  The reaction mixture was stirred at 5属C for 2h, then at 15属C for 4 hr and finally at room temperature for 24 hr.  The reaction mixture was analyzed by TLC and HPLC.  The HPLC analysis confirmed the formation of 2-(2, 4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine (4) and 2,4,6-tris(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine as the only two major products.  The bisresorcinol based product, 2,4-bis(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-6-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine (3), was formed only as a minor component and the ratio of 4:3 was 97:3.  The 2-chloro-4,6-bis(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)s-triazine<br>
- 31 -<br><br>
(2) was only 0.36% and 2,4,6-tris-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-s-triazine (1) was 0.5%.  The experiment demonstrated the preferential formation of monoresorcinol based product 4 by reacting cyanuric chloride, resorcinol, m-xylene and aluminum  chloride simultaneously with higher charge of aluminum chloride.<br>
Example 2: 2- (2,4-Dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bis-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-s-triazine (4).  Use of 2.25 eq aluminum trichloride.<br>
A mixture of 10 g cyanuric chloride (0.0542 mol), 11.51 g of m-xylene (2 eq.), and 5.97 g of resorcinol (1 eq.) in 100 mL chlorobenzene under a nitrogen atmosphere was cooled to 2属C under a nitrogen atmosphere.  Aluminum trichloride (16.26 g, 2.25 eq.) was added over 25 min. such that the temperature was maintained below 5属C.  The mixture was then warmed to 25属C with stirring, and the progress of the reaction was monitored by HPLC (area % at 290 nm).  After 24 hr. at 25属C, HPLC analysis showed 37.6% of 2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bis-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-s-triazine (4) and only 1.0% of 1,4.4% of 2, and 5.1% of 3.  Additional m-xylene (2 eq.) and aluminum trichloride (0.25 eq. ) were added, and the mixture was heated to 32 - 35属C for 20 hr. HPLC analysis indicated that the yield of 1 was increased to 45.3% and there was only 1,9% 2, 4,6-tris- (2.4 -dihyroxyphenyl)-5-triazine and 5.6% 2,4-bis- (2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-6-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-5-triazine.<br>

Example 3:  2-(2,4-Dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bis(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-s-triazine (4).  Use of 2.25 eq aluminum trichloride; Initial reaction temperature of 35属C.<br>
A mixture of 10 g cyanuric chloride {0.0542 mol), 11.51 g of m-xylene (2 eq.), and 5.97 g of resorcinol (1 eq.) in 100 mL chlorobenzene under a nitrogen atmosphere was cooled to 2属C.  Aluminum trichloride (16.26 g, 2.25 eq.) was added over 25 min. such that the temperature was maintained below 5属C.  The mixture was then warmed to 35属C with stirring/ and the progress of the reaction was monitored by HPLC (area % at 290 nm).  After 23 hr. at 35属C HPLC analysis showed 47.4% 2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bi5(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-s-triazine (4) and only 7.6% of 2,4-bis-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-6-(2,4-dimethyl-s-triazine (3), with no unreacted cyanuric chloride.  Additional m-xylene (28.77 g) and 5.43 g aluminum trichloride (0.75 eq.) were added, and the mixture was heated to 55 - 60属C for 24 hr. HPLC analysis indicated that the yield of 1 was increased to 51%.<br>
Example 4:  Reaction of cyanuric chloride, m-xylene, resorcinol, and aluminum trichloride.  Use of 2.0 eq aluminum trichloride.<br>
A mixture of 10 g cyanuric chloride (0.0542 mol), 11.51 g of m-xylene (2 eq.), and 5.97 g of resorcinol (1 eq.) in 100 mL chlorobenzene under a nitrogen atmosphere was cooled to 2属C.  Aluminum trichloride (14.45 g, 2.0 eq.) was added over 30 min. such that the temperature was maintained below 5属C.  The mixture was then warmed to 25属C with stirring, and the progress of the reaction was monitored by HPLC (area% at 290 nm).  Bis-resorcinol products, 2-chloro-4,6-bis-{2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-s-triazine (2, 20%) and 2,4-, bis-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-6-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-5-triazine (3, 7%) were formed.  The target monoresorcinol product 2 -<br>
- 33 -<br><br>
(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bis-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-s-triazine (4) was also formed, although in low yield (20%).<br>
Example 5:  2-(2,4-Dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bis-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-s-triazine (1).  Reaction temperature of 45属C.<br>
Example 3 was repeated, except the reaction was run at 45属C instead of 35属C.  After only 6 hr., the cyanuric chloride was nearly completely consumed, and HPLC analysis<br>
(area % at 290 nm) showed 36.5% 2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bis(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-s-triazine (4) and only 3.9 area % bis-resorcinol-triazine products: 2-chloro-4,6-bis- (2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-5-triazine (2,1.4 area %) and 2,4-bis-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-6-{24-dimethylphenyl)-s-triazine (3, 2.5 area %).  After 26 hr. at 45属C, the yield of 1 was increased to 41.8% with 4.8 area % of 2,4-bis-{2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-6-<br>
(2,4-dimethylpheny) -s-triazine (3) .<br>
These experiments taken together demonstrate that the yield of 2-(2,4-dihydroxy-phenyl)-4,6-bis(2,4-<br>
dimethylphenyl)-s-triazine (4) can be optimized and the yield of bis-resorcinol-s-triazine products can be minimized using the appropriate amount of aluminum chloride and temperature. Any further improvements in yield obtained by optimization of these variables is considered within the scope of this invention<br>
Example 6: 2-(2,4-Dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bis(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-s-triazine (1).  Use of ortho-dichlorobenzene as the solvent.<br>
The basic procedure of Example 3 was followed, except ortho-dichlorobenzene was used as the solvent in place of chlorobenzene. A mixture of 1.84 g cyanuric chloride (10 mmol), 2.12 g of m-xylene (2 eq.), and 1.10 g of resorcinol (1 eg.) in 20 mL chlorobenzene under a nitrogen atmosphere<br>
- 34 -<br><br>
was cooled to 4属C.  Aluminum trichloride (3.00 g) was added over 20 mm. such that the temperature was maintained below 6属C. The mixture was then warmed to 35属C with stirring, and the progress of the reaction was monitored by HPLC.  After 17.5 hr. at 35属C, HPLC analysis (area % at 290 nm) showed 37.1% 2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bis(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-5-triazine (4) with 9.0% bis-resorcinol-triazine products: 2-chloro-4,6-bis-{2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-s-triazine (2, 3.0%) and 2,4-bis-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-6-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-s-triazine (3, 6.0%).<br>
This experiment demonstrates that 2-(2,4-<br>
dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bis(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-s-triazine can be prepared and the yield of bis-resorcinol-s-triazine products can be minimized using solvents other than chlorobenzene. The use of solvents other than chlorobenzene for this process is therefore considered within the scope of this invention.<br>

The basic procedure of Example 5 was followed, except 2 eq. of ortho-xylene was used as the aromatic reactant in place of<br>
- 35 -<br><br>
2 eq. of meta-xylene, and chlorobenzene was use as the<br>
solvent.  The progress of the reaction was monitored by HPLC. After 18 hr. at 35属C, HPLC analysis (area % at 290 nm) showed 35.7% bis-(ortho-xylyl)-mono-resorcinol-s-triazines 34.0% 2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bis(3,4-dimethylphenyl)-s-triazine (5) and 1.7% 2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl-4 -(3,4-dimethylphenyl)-6-(2, 3-dimethylphenyl)-s-triazine (6); with 3.8% 2- chloro-4,6-bis- (2 , 4-dihydroxyphenyl) -5- triazine and 3.6% 2,4-bis(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-6-(3,4-dimethylphenyl)-s-triazine.<br>
Example 8:  2-(2,4-Dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bis(4-methylphenyl) 5-triazine (7)<br><br>
The basic procedure of Example 7 was followed, except 2 eq. of toluene was used as the aromatic reactant in place of 2 eq. of meta-xylene.  The progress of the reaction was monitored by HPLC (peak detection at 290 nm).  After 23 hr. at 35属C, HPLC analysis showed the formation of 17.3% 2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bis(4-methylphenyl)s-triazine (7).<br>
