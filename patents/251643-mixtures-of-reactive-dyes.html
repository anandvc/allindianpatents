Mixtures of reactive dyes and their use<br>
The present invention relates to mixtures of reactive dyes, which mixtures are suitable for dyeing or printing nitrogen-containing or hydroxyl-group-containing fibre materials and yield dyeings or prints having good all-round fastness properties.<br>
The practice of dyeing has recently led to higher demands being made on the quality of the dyeings and the economy of the dyeing process. As a result, there continues to be a need for novel, readily obtainable dyeing compositions having good properties, especially in respect of their application.<br>
Dyeing today requires reactive dyes that, for example, have sufficient substantivity and at the same time exhibit good ease of washing-off of unfixed dye. In addition, they should exhibit a good colour yield and a high reactivity, the objective being especially to obtain dyeings having high degrees of fixing. In many cases, the build-up behaviour of reactive dyes is not sufficient to meet the demands, especially in the dyeing of very deep shades.<br>
The problem underlying the present invention is therefore to provide novel mixtures of reactive dyes, which mixtures are especially suitable for dyeing and printing fibre materials and possess the above-described qualities to a high degree. They should also yield dyeings having good all-round fastness properties, for example fastness to light and to wetting.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates to dye mixtures comprising at least one dye of formula<br><br>

The reactive dyes of formulae (1) and (2), and therefore also the dye mixtures, may comprise further additives, for example sodium chloride or dextrin.<br>
The dyes of formulae (1) and (2) are present In the dye mixture according to the invention in a weight ratio of, for example, from 1:99 to 99:1, preferably from 5:95 to 95:5 and especially from 10:90 to 90:10.<br><br>
The dyes of formulae (1) and (2) are known or can be prepared according to methods known perse. Dyes of formula (1) are disclosed, for example, in Kokai JP 50-000178. Dyes of formula (2) are described, for example, in US-A-4 622 390 and US-A-4 885 360.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention can be prepared, for example, by mixing the individual dyes. Such a mixing process is carried out, for example, in suitable mills, for example ball mills or pin mills, and also in kneaders or mixers.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention may, where appropriate, comprise other auxiliaries that, for example, improve handling or increase storage stability, such as, for example, buffers, dispersants or anti-dusts. Such auxiliaries are known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention are suitable for dyeing and printing an extremely wide variety of materials, especially hydroxyl-group-containing or nitrogen-containing fibre materials. Examples are paper, silk, leather, wool, polyamide fibres and polyurethanes and also especially cellulosic fibre materials of all kinds. Such fibre materials are, for example, the natural cellulosic fibres, such as cotton, linen and hemp, and also cellulose and regenerated cellulose. The dye mixtures according to the invention are also suitable for dyeing or printing hydroxyl-group-containing fibres present in blend fabrics, e.g. mixtures of cotton with polyester fibres or polyamide fibres.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates also to the use of the dye mixtures according to the invention in the dyeing or printing of hydroxyl-group-containing or nitrogen-containing, especially cellulosic, fibre materials.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention can be applied to the fibre material and fixed to the fibre in a variety of ways, especially in the form of aqueous dye solutions and dye print pastes. They are suitable both for the exhaust method and for dyeing in accordance with the pad-dyeing method; they can be used at low dyeing temperatures and require only short steaming times in the pad-steam method. The build-up behaviour is very good, the degrees of fixing are high and unfixed dye can be washed off easily, the difference between the degree of exhaust and the degree of fixing being remarkably small, that is to say the soaping<br><br>
loss is very low. The dye mixtures according to the invention are also suitable for printing, especially on cotton, and also for printing nitrogen-containing fibres, for example wool or silk or blend fabrics that contain wool.<br>
The dyeings and prints produced using the dye mixtures according to the invention can be reproduced very well, have a high tinctorial strength and a high fibre-to-dye binding stability in both the acidic and the alkaline range, and furthermore have good fastness to light and very good wet-fastness properties, such as fastness to washing, to water, to sea water, to cross-dyeing and to perspiration. Fibre-level and surface-level dyeings are obtained.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention are also suitable as colorants for use in recording systems. Such recording systems are, for example, commercially available inkjet printers for paper or textile printing, or writing instruments, such as fountain pens and ballpoint pens and especially inkjet printers. For that purpose the dye mixture according to the invention is first brought into a form suitable for use in recording systems. A suitable form is, for example, an aqueous ink that comprises the dye mixture according to the invention as colorant. The inks can be prepared in customary manner by mixing together the individual constituents in the desired amount of water.<br>
Substrates that come into consideration include the above-mentioned hydroxyl-group-containing or nitrogen-containing fibre materials, especially cellulosic fibre materials.<br>
The dyes used in the aqueous inks should preferably have a low salt content, that is to say they should have a total content of salts of less than 0.5 % by weight, based on the weight of the dyes. Dyes that have relatively high salt contents as a result of their preparation and/or as a result of the subsequent addition of diluents can be desalted, for example, by membrane separation procedures, such as ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis or dialysis.<br>
The inks preferably have a total content of dyes of from 1 to 35 % by weight, especially from 1 to 30 % by weight and preferably from 1 to 20 % by weight, based on the total weight of the ink. The preferred lower limit in this case is a limit of 1.5 % by weight, preferably 2 % by weight and especially 3 % by weight.<br><br>
The inks may comprise water-miscible organic solvents, for example C1-C4alcohols, e.g. methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, sec-butanol, tert-butanol or iso-butanoi; amides, e.g. dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide; ketones or ketone alcohols, e.g. acetone, diacetone alcohol; ethers, e.g. tetrahydrofuran or dioxane; nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, e.g. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone or 1t3-dimethyl-2-irnidazolidone, poly-alkylene glycols, e.g. polyethylene glycol, or polypropylene glycol; C2-C6alkylene glycols and thioglycols, e.g. ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, triethylene glycol, thio-diglycol, hexylene glycol and diethylene glycol; other polyols, e.g. glycerol or 1,2,6-hexane-triol; and C1-C4alkyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols, e.g. 2-methoxyethanol, 2-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)ethanol, 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethanoI, 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethanoI or 2-[2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethanol; preferably N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, diethylene glycol, glycerol or especially 1,2-propylene glycol, usually in an amount of from 2 to 30 % by weight, especially from 5 to 30 % by weight and preferably from 10 to 25 % by weight, based on the total weight of the ink.<br>
In addition, the inks may also comprise solubilisers, e.g. ε-caprolactam.<br>
The inks may comprise thickeners of natural or synthetic origin inter alia for the purpose of adjusting the viscosity.<br>
Examples of thickeners that may be mentioned include commercially available alginate thickeners, starch ethers or locust bean flour ethers, especially sodium alginate on its own or in admixture with modified cellulose, e.g. methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, carboxymethyl-cellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, methylhydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, especially with preferably from 20 to 25 % by weight carboxy-methylcellulose. Synthetic thickeners that may be mentioned are, for example, those based on poly(meth)acrylic acids or poly(meth)acrylamides and also polyalkylene glycols having a molecular weight of e.g. from 2000 to 20 000, for example polyethylene glycol or polypropylene glycol or the mixed polyalkylene glycols of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide.<br>
The inks comprise such thickeners, for example, in an amount of from 0.01 to 2 % by weight, especially from 0.01 to 1 % by weight and preferably from 0.01 to 0.5 % by weight, based on the total weight of the ink.<br><br>
The inks may also comprise buffer substances, e.g. borax, borates, phosphates, poly-phosphates or citrates. Examples that may be mentioned include borax, sodium borate, sodium tetraborate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium tripoiyphosphate, sodium pentapolyphosphate and sodium citrate. They are used especially in amounts of from 0.1 to 3 % by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 1 % by weight, based on the total weight of the ink, in order to establish a pH value of, for example, from 4 to 9, especially from 5 to 8.5.<br>
As further additives, the inks may comprise surfactants or humectants.<br>
Suitable surfactants include commercially available anionic or non-ionic surfactants. As humectants in the inks according to the invention there come into consideration, for example, urea or a mixture of sodium lactate (advantageously in the form of a 50 % to 60 % aqueous solution) and glycerol and/or propylene glycol in amounts of preferably from 0.1 to 30 % by weight, especially from 2 to 30 % by weight.<br>
Preference is given to inks having a viscosity of from 1 to 40 mPas, especially from 1 to 20 mPa-s and more especially from 1 to 10 mPa-s.<br>
Furthermore, the inks may in addition comprise customary additives, e.g. anti-foams or especially preservatives that inhibit fungal and/or bacterial growth. Such additives are usually used in amounts of from 0.01 to 1 % by weight, based on the total weight of the ink.<br>
Preservatives that come into consideration include formaldehyde-yielding agents, e.g. paraformaldehyde and trioxane, especially aqueous, approximately 30 to 40 % by weight formaldehyde solutions, imidazole compounds, e.g. 2-(4-thiazolyl)benzimidazole, thiazole compounds, e.g. 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one or 2-n-octyl-isothiazolin-3-one) iodine com-pounds, nitriles, phenols, haloalkylthio compounds or pyridine derivatives, especially 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one or 2-n-octyl-isothiazolin-3-one. A suitable preservative is e.g. a 20 % by weight solution of 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one in dipropylene glycol (Proxel® GXL).<br>
The inks may also comprise further additives, such as fluorinated polymers or telomers, e.g. polyethoxyperfluoroalcohols (Forafac® or Zonyl® products) in an amount of e.g. from 0.01 to 1 % by weight, based on the total weight of the ink.<br><br>
In inkjet printing, individual droplets of the ink are sprayed onto a substrate in a controlled manner from a nozzle. For this purpose, predominantly the continuous inkjet method and the drop-on-demand method are used, in the continuous inkjet method, the droplets are produced continuously and any droplets not required for the printing are conveyed to a collecting vessel and recycled, whereas in the drop-on-demand method droplets are produced and printed as required, that is to say droplets are produced only when required for the printing. The production of the droplets can be effected, for example, by means of a piezo-inkjet head or by means of thermal energy (bubble jet). Printing by means of a piezo-inkjet head and printing in accordance with the continuous inkjet method are preferred.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates also to aqueous inks comprising the dye mixtures according to the invention and to the use of such inks in an inkjet printing method for the printing of various substrates, especially textile fibre materials, the definitions and preferred meanings mentioned above applying to the dye mixtures, the inks and the substrates.<br>
The following Examples serve to illustrate the invention. Unless otherwise indicated, the temperatures are given in degrees Celsius, parts are parts by weight and percentages relate to % by weight. Parts by weight relate to parts by volume in a ratio of kilograms to litres.<br>
Example 1: 100 parts of a cotton fabric are introduced at a temperature of 60°C into a dyebath comprising 0.6 part of the dye of formula<br><br>
5.4 parts of the dye of formula<br><br><br>
and 60 parts of sodium chloride in 1000 parts of water. After 45 minutes at 60°C, 20 parts of calcined soda are added. The temperature of the dyebath is maintained at 60°C for a further 45 minutes. The dyed fabric is then rinsed and dried in the usual manner. A navy-blue dyeing having good fastness properties is obtained.<br>
Examples 2 and 3: Following the procedure given in Example 1 but, instead of using 0.6 part of the dye of formula (101), using 0.6 part of the dye of formula<br><br>
there is likewise obtained a navy-blue dyeing having good fastness properties.<br>
Examples 4 to 9: Following the procedure given in Example 1 but, instead of using 5.4 parts of the dye of formula (102), using 5.4 parts of the dye of formula<br><br><br>
there are likewise obtained navy-blue dyeings having good fastness properties.<br><br>
Example 8:<br>
(a)	Mercerised cotton satin is pad-dyed with a liquor containing 30 g/l of sodium carbonate<br>
(b)	and 50 g/l of urea (70 % liquor pick) and dried.<br>
(c)	Using a drop-on-demand inkjet head (bubble jet), there is printed onto the cotton satin<br>
(d)	pretreated according to step (a) an aqueous ink containing<br>
-10 % by weight of a mixture of 0.6 part of the reactive dye of formula (101) and 5.4 parts of the reactive dye of formula (102),<br>
-	20 % by weight of 1,2-propylene glycol and<br>
-	70 % by weight of water.<br>
The print is fully dried and fixed in saturated steam at 102°C for 8 minutes, cold-rinsed,<br>
washed-off at the boil, rinsed again and dried.<br>
A navy-blue print having good fastness properties is obtained.<br><br>
