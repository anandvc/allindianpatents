The following specification describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
GRANTED<br>
.<br><br><br>
11-8-2008<br><br><br>
1 0 AUG 2004<br><br>
Technical Field of Invention:<br>
This invention relates to an improved process for manufacturing a-2-(chlorphenyl)-6,7-dihydrothieno [3,2-C] pyridine-5 (4-H)-acetic acid methyl ester of Formula I, commonly known as Clopidogrel.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Clopidogrel is known for its platelet aggregating and antithrombotic properties and finds medicinal applications in this field. It can be represented by Formula-I, and was disclosed in Patent US 4529596 (hereinafter referred as '596' patent) in its racemic form for the first time.<br><br>
Formula I<br>
The '596' patent provides a synthesis of the said molecule of Formula I by the reaction of a thienopyridine derivative of Formula II with a chloro compound of Formula III (where X = C1) in solvents like dimethyl formamide, alcohols and ethyl acetate in presence of alkali metal carbonates. However, it does not suggest preparation / source of the starting material, tetrahydrothienopyridine derivative, of Formula II.<br><br><br>
In a subsequent patent, JP 63101385, a convenient process for the preparation of the 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno (3,2-c) pyridine intermediate (Formula II) was disclosed. According to the multi-step process of this patent, a commercially available 2-(2-thienyl) ethylamine (Formula IV) was reacted with formaldehyde to give an intermediate 2-(2-thienyl) ethyl formimine which was isolated and cyclized in presence of dry HCl in polar solvents to give the 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno (3,2-c) pyridine of Formula II.<br>
A similar process was disclosed in United States Patent 5132435 for the preparation of Clopidogrel by using the same reactants per se to yield the 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno (3,2-c) pyridine derivative (Formula II) and reacting the same with a bromo-derivative of Formula III (X = Br) in solvents selected from alcoholic solvents, DMF, ether solvents and ethyl acetate in presence of alkali metal carbonate as the base. In the process, 2-(2-thienyl) ethylamine was reacted with formalin solution in water by heating to a temperature range of 70°C to 90°C and isolated the 2-(2-thienyl) ethyl formimine by a long procedure in pure form. This was reacted with dry hydrochloric acid solution in dimethylformamide to form the cyclized product (Formula II).<br>
In these entire prior art the reactants per se are same but employ varying conditions to achieve better purity or yield. Although some of the problems are solved by modifying the reaction conditions or route of synthesis as taught by the prior art, there still exist problems like polymerization of intermediates which need to be investigated.<br>
The cyclisation of the intermediate 2-(2-thienyl) ethyl formimine does not take place in presence of water. If water is present in the reaction it necessitates the isolation of formimine intermediate in pure form. This increases the number of operations and makes process plant unfriendly from industrial scale-up point of view. Moreover, the isolated intermediate, 2-(2-thienyl) ethyl formimine, is not a stable compound and polymerizes to give a trimer which makes it difficult to store / handle in normal conditions.<br><br>
Although, the reaction of bromo-compound (Formula III) with 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno (3,2-c) pyridine of Formula II gave moderate yields in the reported processes, the reactions takes long time for completion at temperature 60°C to 90°C as reported in '435' patent.<br>
Carrying out reactions at above temperatures, that too for longer period, lead to formation of various impurities due to the lack of selectivity of reactions or decomposition of the reactants or products, which necessitates extra purification resulting into yield losses and increase in number of operations not desirable for a practical process. The search for a manufacturing process for the preparation of Clopidogrel employing easy synthetic methods resulting in a satisfactory yield / purity of final product remains undoubtedly of interest.<br>
Objectives of the present invention:<br>
It is, therefore, an objective of the present invention to provide an industrially useful process for the manufacture of Clopidogrel from starting materials that are readily and commercially available, relatively inexpensive, and easily maneuvered at large scale operations.<br>
Other major objectives of this invention are<br>
1.	to provide a single pot conversion process for unstable intermediate 2-(2-thienyl)ethyl formimine formed in the reaction to a stable product of Formula II.<br>
2.	to design a process for preparation of Clopidogrel wherein the condensation of halo ester stage is performed under ambient conditions with accelerated rate of reaction.<br>
3.	to provide, optionally a one-pot processes for the preparation of racemic Clopidogrel starting from 2-(2-thienyl)ethylamine.<br><br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a process for the manufacture of Clopidogrel starting from 2-(2-thienyl) ethylamine, which eliminates the isolation of an unstable intermediate like 2-(2-thienyl) ethyl formimine by subjecting it to a one pot cyclization to get 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno (3,2-c) pyridine of Formula II.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno (3,2-c) pyridine is reacted with halo-compound of Formula III (where X is C1 or Br) at room temperature in a solvent like water and/or ethylene dichloride (EDC) in presence of organic or inorganic bases like sodium carbonate.<br>
In further embodiment of the invention, the 2-(2-thienyl) ethylamine is reacted with paraformaldehyde in solvents such as hydrocarbon solvents including aliphatic, aromatic and chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents and removing the water formed, azeotropically during reaction. The 2-(2-thienyl) ethyl formimine solution is cyclized in a single pot by supplying dry HC1 gas / solution.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the reaction of Formula II with Formula III is carried out in a combination of solvents like water and chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents at room temperature.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the production of Clopidogrel is carried out in a single pot by reacting 2-(2-thienyl) ethylamine with paraformaldehyde in organic solvents, azeotropically removing water formed in the reactor, cyclizing the 2-(2-thienyl) ethyl formimine by supplying dry HC1 gas/solution, and reacting the 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno (3,2-c) pyridine formed with a solution of haloester (Formula III, where X = CI or Br) in water or organic solvent or its mixtures thereof in presence of a base.<br><br>
In the above said process, the Clopidogrel formed in the reaction is isolated by phase separation and by the removal of organic solvent. It is purified in solvents like acetone by forming hydrogen sulphate salt.<br>

Detailed description of the invention:<br>
It has now been found that new condition / process makes it possible to convert 2-(2-thienyl) ethylamine to 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno (3,2-c) pyridine via 2-(2-thienyl) ethyl formimine in a single step in one-pot and thereby eliminating the isolation of unstable intermediate, 2-(2-thienyl) ethyl formimine, making the process industrially more feasible.<br>
Consequently, the invention relates to an improved synthesis of Clopidogrel by reacting 2-(2-thienyl) ethylamine with paraformaldehyde in presence of dry HCl, optionally isolating the compound of Formula II, and reacting with halo-compound of Formula III (X = C1 or Br) in a single organic solvent or a combination of organic solvents and water.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, the 2-(2-thienyl) ethylamine is reacted with paraformaldehyde in a suitable solvent selected from non-polar solvent like aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon solvents, chlorinated hydrocarbons like dichloroethane (EDC) etc. The reaction takes place at a temperature of 30°C to 100°C<br><br>
and the water formed as a byproduct in the reaction is removed continuously by azeotropic distillation using a Dean-Stark assembly. Azeotropic distillation herein means removal of two or more solvents from a mixture of solvents that form a low boiling mixture called azeotrope by distillation at elevated temperature.<br>
After removal of water, the intermediate 2-(2-thienyl) ethyl formimine formed in the solvent is in situ reacted with dry HC1 gas. The dry HC1 also can be advantageously introduced into reactor as a solution in a suitable solvent. The solvent used for this purpose include dimethyl formamide, alcoholic solvents like methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol etc. The one pot conversion of 2-(2-thienyl) ethylamine takes place in a period of 4 to 8 hours. The preferred temperature for carrying out the cyclization of intermediate in presence of the acid catalyst is in the range from 60°C to 90°C.<br>
According to present invention, the cyclization of 2-(2-thienyl) ethyl formimine obtained takes place in-situ spontaneously in presence of acid and yields the stable intermediate 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno (3,2-c) pyridine as its hydrochloride salt. The said salt precipitates from the reaction medium and conveniently isolated in substantially pure form.<br>
The acid catalyzed cyclization of 2-(2-thienyl) ethyl formimine is carried out at a temperature range of 70°C to 75°C, preferably at 70°C for a period of 4 hours.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno (3,2-c) pyridine as a free base or its hydrochloride salt form is reacted with a halo derivative of Formula III in an organic solvent especially dichloroethane in presence of an organic base to obtain Clopidogrel. The organic base for carrying out this step of the process is selected from the group consisting of trialkyl amines such as triethylamine, trimethylamine, diisopropylethylamine and the like. The preferred base is triethylamine. The preferred halo derivative of Formula III is the bromo compound (Formula III, where X = Br).<br><br>
According to the above process step of the present invention, the reaction is carried out at a temperature range of about 50°C to about 80°C for about 4 to 4.5 hours, preferably about 3.5 hours at 70°C. In this step of the process, where the acid salt of Formula II is used as reactant, then an excess amount of the base is used. This is required to neutralize the acid salt to liberate the free base of the compound of Formula II that reacts, with the halo derivatives of Formula III.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention wherein, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno(3,2-c)pyridine is reacted with a halo compound of Formula HI in a heterogeneous mixture of solvents selected from a combination of water and chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents such as dichloromethane or dichloroethane. The preferred solvent is a mixture of water and dichloroethane. The preferred ratio of water and dichloroethane is 1: 0.5<br>
The base for carrying out the above process step is selected from the group consisting of inorganic bases like alkali metal carbonates. The preferred alkali metal carbonate used is sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate.<br>
Preferably the inorganic base may be used in molar equivalent ratio relative to the halo compound of Formula III or in slight excess. In the case of reaction of acid salt of Formula II with Formula III, an excess base is used to liberate the free amine from acid salt. A preferable ratio of base used in this case ranges from 2 moles to 3 moles relative to compound of Formula II.<br>
In this step of the process, the 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno(3,2-c)pyridine or its hydrochloride salt and the inorganic base is taken in water in reaction vessel. The addition of a compound of Formula III is carried out as its solution in dichloroethane to form the heterogeneous reaction conditions. This process is particularly advantageous from the point of view of handling the halo compound of Formula III, due to its highly irritant and lachrymator properties.<br><br>
According to the process of the present invention, this step is advantageously carried out at ambient temperature. Although the reaction goes faster at high temperature, to limit the impurity generation, this step is carried out at a temperature of 25°C to 30°C for a period of 7 to 10 hours, preferably 10 hours.<br>
The Clopidogrel prepared following the above method is isolated by phase separation and washing the organic layer with water. The organic layer is removed by evaporation and the clopidogrel base obtained is purified in acetone by making its hydrogen sulphate salt. The pure Clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate is isolated as pure crystals from the solvent by suction filtration and drying.<br>
According to a particularly advantageous alternative form of the present invention, the preparation of Clopidogrel may be carried out via 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno (3,2-c) pyridine intermediate in the actual medium (hydrocarbon solvents) in which it is prepared in a single pot.<br>
Consequently, according to the invention, clopidogrel is prepared by the following reaction in a single pot.<br>
1.	2-(2-thienyl)ethylamine is reacted with paraformaldehyde in suitable solvent as described earlier and removing the water formed in the reaction azeotropically.<br>
2.	introducing dry HC1 in the form of solution or gas and cyclizing the corresponding formimine to give 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno(3,2-c)pyridine as hydrochloride in the reaction vessel.<br>
3.	saponifying the hydrochloride salt of 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno(3,2-c)pyridine of Formula II with introduction of an aqueous solution of sodium or potassium carbonate in required amounts.<br>
4.	introducing halo-compound of Formula III as such or as a solution in organic solvent used for the stage 1 and reacting at a temperature of 25°C to 30°C for a period of 8 to 10 hours, preferably 10 hours,<br><br>
5.	isolating the Clopidogrel base in the organic layer after phase separation and washing with water, removing the solvent by evaporation to leave Clopidogrel base as residue in the reaction vessel, and<br>
6.	isolating pure Clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate by introducing acetone and cone, sulphuric acid into the reaction vessel.<br>
The addition of Sulphuric acid is carried out preferably at a temperature of 0°C to 25° and the addition of Sulphuric acid to the acetone solution of Clopidogrel base may be carried out in a controlled manner so as to avoid under exothermicity with proper cooling.<br>
The Clopidogrel base obtained by the process of the present invention is, further, resolved into it enantiomers using optically active camphorsulphonic acid. The process of resolution involves contacting Clopidogrel base with (-) camphor sulphonic acid in a mixture of solvent likes acetone and dichioromethane and crystallizing the dextroisomer as a diasteriomeric salt of camphor sulphonic salt. The proportion of the solvent system (acetone: dichioromethane) used for the resolution is in the range of 10: 0.25 and preferably in a ratio of 10 : 1.0.<br>
The diasteriomer salt is then hydrolyzed using alkali metal carbonates such as sodium carbonate or ammonia to liberate the dextro enantiomer of Clopidogrel as free base. After hydrolysis, (+) Clopidogrel base was isolated by extraction using organic solvents like dichioromethane followed by evaporation of solvent to give (+) Clopidogrel having an enantiomeric purity &gt; 99.5% and an yield of 76 to 80%.<br>
The dextro-rotatory Clopidogrel base obtained above is converted into Clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate by salt formation with sulphuric acid in a solvent like ethyl acetate. The crystal form of Clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate isolated on crystallization is identified as Polymorphic Form I.<br><br>
