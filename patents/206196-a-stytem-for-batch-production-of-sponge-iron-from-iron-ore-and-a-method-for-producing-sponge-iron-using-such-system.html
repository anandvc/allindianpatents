				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a system for batch manufacture of Sponge lion from iron Ore and in particular to a low cost simple system and method of batch manufacture of such Sponge Iron from Iron Ore involving tow capital cost and yet suitable for manufacture of Sponge Iron from both Hematite (Fe2O3) Iron Ore as well as Magnetite (Fe3O4) Iron Ore and even from iron ore fines of less than 5 mm apart from the usual sponge grade iron ore of 5-18mm sizes The system and the method used is environment friendly and advantageously can be adapted and used even in remote locations with scarcity or even no power supply .The invention is thus directed to a cost effective alternative to the complex and capital intensive rotary kiln based or gas based manufacture of Sponge Iron presently in use.<br>
Background Art<br>
Sponge lion is basically Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) and is the product obtained from direct reduction of Iron Ore. Usually, in the reduction process the Oxygen in the Iron Ore is eliminated leaving void space and the whole mass becomes porous and spongy. Sponge Iron is widely applicable in the Steel Industry as an important raw material for steel making via the Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) and the Induction Furnace (IF) routes substituting and supplementing scrap of iron and steel.<br>
Presently there are two main technologies for producing Sponge Iron (i) Gas based and pi) Coal based.<br>
The gas-based method involves several alternative technologies and any generalization of the gas based method is not possible. In one such process popularly known as "Midrex process", the gas based system is continuous, moving bed process which converts Iron Oxide (Lump/pellets) into Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) at elevated pressure and predetermined temperature under the reducing action of a hydrogen and carbon monoxide (CO) gas mixture produced by natural gas / steam reforming.<br>
IN 191425 discloses a process for producing Sponge Iron from particulate iron oxide containing ore characterized by the steps of reducing the iron ore containing ore to Sponge Iron in a reduction zone by reacting the iron oxide containing material with a reducing gas, withdrawing<br><br>
the gas formed during reduction from the reduction zone as a top gas, subjecting the top gas to CO2 purification thereby forming a CQ2 containing off gas and purified top gas, mixing the CO2 containing off gas and a purified top gas and burning it, supplying the thermal energy produced by the CO2 containing off gas to a consumer and recovering the sponge iron obtained in the first step from the reduction zone.<br>
In the coal based method of producing Sponge Iron the same involves reducing iron ore (lump/pellets) with carbonations material like coal or lignite. The reduction process is carried out in a shaft furnace or rotary furnace at stipulated temperature in the range of 850°C-1050°C. The reduced iron from the furnace is cooled and the cool product alter being discharged is next subjected to product separation and handling. Magnetic separators are used to separate the magnetic component from the non-magnetic ingredients.<br>
US 4.362554 disclose a method and apparatus for manufacturing sponge iron by the continuous reduction of iron oxides in a shaft utilizing recirculation gases. Reaction gas is removed from the shaft furnace, substantially cleaned of all CO2 and H2O and then divided into at least two flow portions one of which is passed to a gas generator comprising a plasma burner A reducing agent such as pit coal is injected together with an oxidant into the hot gas from the plasma burner so as to form a gas mixture comprised primarily of CO and H2, which gas mixture is then mixed with the other flow portion of the cleaned reaction gas in such proportion that the temperature of the resulting reduction gas is suitable for the reduction of iron oxides in the shaft furnace.<br>
US 4,362,555 discloses a method and apparatus for manufacturing sponge iron by the continuous reduction of iron oxides in a shaft utilizing recirculation gases. Reaction gas is removed from the shaft furnace, substantially cleaned of all CO2 and H2O, and then divided into at least two flow portions one of which is passed to a gas generator comprising a gas generating shaft substantially filled with a solid reducing agent and a plasma burner arranged in the lower portion of said shaft. An oxidant is injected into the hot gas from the plasma burner so as to form a gas mixture comprised primarily of CO and H 2, which gas mixture is then mixed with the other flow portion of the cleaned reaction gas in such proportion that the temperature of the resulting reduction gas is suitable for the reduction of iron oxides in the shaft furnace.<br><br>
4<br>
IN 191759 discloses a device for producing Sponge Iron from lumps of Iron Oxide in a reduction shaft comprising (1) using a hot dust containing an Carbon Monoxide(CO) rich reduction gas, the reduction is produced in a gas generator by partial oxidation of solid carbon containing material and introduced via a plurality of lateral reduction gas inlets arranged at the same level on the circumference of the reduction shaft, into the reduction shaft at the tower end of the reduction zone and iron oxide lumps are entered in the upper area of the reduction shaft and its lower end discharged as Sponge iron characterized in that below the level of lateral gas inlets are provided additional reduction gas inlets in the form of at least one channel which is over its length downwardly opened and extends from the outside into the radically central area of the reduction shaft.<br>
US4469509 discloses operation of the rotary kitn provided at its charging end with a central burner, solid reducing agents having a high content of volatile constituents are used and the charge and the gas atmosphere are conducted in cocurrent streams. To avoid a high heat bad per unit of volume in the heating-up zone and yet to increase the heating-up rate, a solid carbonaceous reducing agent having a high content of volatile constituents is charged together with the iron oxide-containing material into the charging end of the rotary kiln, oxygen-containing gases are blown through nozzle blocks into the free gas space and into the charge in the heating-up zone, and oxygen-containing gases are blown through nozzle blocks into the free kiln space in the reducing zone.<br>
WO 02/064844 A1 discloses a method for producing sponge iron wherein iron oxide is reduced through heating together with a solid reducing agent to form sponge iron, characterized in that a mixed powder of a hematite powder and an iron ore powder or a mixed powder of hematite powder and a mill scale powder is used as iron oxide and the hematite powder has a specific surface area of 2.0 m2/g or more and is used in an amount of 5 to 45mass % based on the total amount of the iron oxide.<br>
Swedish Pat. No. 73 04 322-5, describes of directly gassifying coal in solid form using a plasma generator. This process essentially requires that the supply of coal must be extremely accurately adjusted and for some grades of coal there are problems in handling the ash. Moreover, the gas produced has a hydrogen content which is lower than the ideal for reduction purposes.<br><br>
5<br>
The drawbacks with the above known coal based methods of producing sponge iron are primarily the extremely high investment cost and also the exceptionally high energy consumption or the limitations in charge characteristics for effective reduction of the ore.<br>
In particular the rotary furnace method involves pit coal together with the ore to be reduced, in an inclined rotary furnace. Such rotary furnace involving coal based system of manufacture of Sponge Iron from Iron Ore is complex and cost extensive and essential involves lot of power consumption by way of achieving the rotary motion of the kiln in the continuous process of reduction of the Ore. Moreover, apart from being capital intensive such coal based method / system involving the rotary kiln is essentially also complex to install involving huge installation space and skilled manpower to handle and iise.<br>
The demands of the steel industry for sponge iron which is ever increasing make it essential to look for alternative methods and system of manufacture of sponge iron which could avoid the complexities and capital intensive approach to manufacture of sponge iron by way of some simple and cost effective system / technique which could be widely adapted and used even in remote locations with scarcity or even no power sources/supply.<br>

fn accordance with another aspect, the stand means used can be adapted such that the sponge iron from plurality of vertically aligned saggers can be unloaded one after the other by first unloading the topmost sagger followed by me saggers there under one by one, said platform being adapted lor height adjustment at the level of the base of sagger to be unloaded. To facilitate the unloading process, the platform of the stand means having said gate / cut out is provided with an outer edge facing the saggers of a semi-circular type matching the outer profile of the saggers.<br><br>
14<br>
After the unloading is completed, the contents are passed through screens and magnetic separation of sponge iron, ash and un-bumt coal dust Thereafter the sponge iron is packed in bags and transported for subsequent application.<br>
As also discussed, the manual process of loading and unloading can be further attended, if required, following a mechanical process to make it less labor intensive. For the purpose the bins can be prepared at top of the kiln for gravity discharge and after firing by using pneumatic material handling system removal of material from the saggers can be attended.<br>
Reference is now invited to figure 5 which shows an arrangement of vertically aligned sagger (SG)column involving a stoppered sagger (SSG). The stoppered sagger is shown more clearly in accompanying figure 5A with the stopper removed and the stopper opening (SO) being, visible. The stopper means is shown in greater detail in figure 5B.ln such arrangement involving stoppered saggers, while unloading subsequent to cooling, the stopper (ST) is simply opened when the contents from the stoppered sagger and above are released by gravity through the said opening(SO). After the major portion of the contents in the sagger column is thus unloaded the saggers are manually removed and the contents from the saggers below the stoppered sagger is /are unloaded simply by manually displacement /turning up side down<br>
It is thus possible by way of the above disclosed system and method of batch process for manufacture of sponge iron to provide for a simple, cost effective and user friendly manufacturing of sponge iron in the small scale sector to meet the large scale present day demand of sponge iron by way of an alternative to the capital intensive and complex rotary kiln based reduction system presently in use. The system can be provided in remote locations where there is scarcity or even no availability of power to operate complex and capital intensive rotary kilns to favour wide scale cost effective manufacture of sponge iron to meet the present day growing demands of sponge iron in the Steel Industry.Importantly, the system is workable to produce sponge iron from both the iron ore sources Hematite (Fe2O3)and Magnetite (Fe3O4)    and even favours utilization of iron ore fines and waste in generation of sponge iron Importantly, the system and method for manufacture of sponge iron disclosed above would also be environment friendly.<br><br>
