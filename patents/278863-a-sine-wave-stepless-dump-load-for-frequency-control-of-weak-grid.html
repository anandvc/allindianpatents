Field of the invention:<br>
The invention relates in general to generation of green power using<br>
solar photovoltaic (SPV) and wind generators, and in particular to a<br>
novel step-less dump load for frequency control of weak grids<br>
formed by hybrid wind, diesel and SPV generation.<br>
Background and prior art:<br>
The world over research is going on to generate green power using wind<br>
generators and solar photovoltaic inverters. These systems work well if<br>
grid power is available at the site. For remote sites, where grid power is<br>
not available but there is a lot of wind and sun, it is difficult to form a<br>
stand alone grid with only wind generators and SPV inverters, and diesel<br>
generators are also required to be used to form a weak grid. In such<br>
installations the frequency of the grid will have to be controlled using<br>
dump load. Ideally the dump loads should be step-less and should not<br>
generate harmonics, as harmonics may excite resonances in the weak<br>
grid. The control action should not cause generation of reactive VARS and<br>
it should be easy to integrate the action with the overall frequency<br>
control. This invention addresses these problems.<br>
There are many methods reported for designing a dump load.<br>
A US patent 4,511,807 'ELECTRIC GENERATOR CONTROL SYSTEM' uses<br>
simple switches in series with resistors.<br>
A French patent FR2786955/FR2786955 'LINEARLY VARIABLE LOADING<br>
BANK FOR HIGH-POWER 3- PHASE ELECTRICAL NETWORK, COMPRISES<br>
RESISTOR BANK	ETC SWITCHED BY THYRISTORS PAIRS<br>
 <br>
,ONE REVERSE /PARALLEL PAIR PER PHASE'. The patent suggests firing<br>
angle control which is very much known to generate harmonics.<br>
US patent pub no. 2007/0164567 'WIND TURBINE DUMP LOAD SYSTEM<br>
AND METHOD \ Uses a thyristorised dump load in combination with<br>
mechanically switched dump loads for Permanent Magnet Generators.<br>
A US patent 4,563,630 'METHOD OF GOVERNING A GENERATOR AND/OR<br>
APPARATUS FOR GOVERNING A GENERATOR' suggests a method using<br>
Triacs (or thyristors in back to back mode) for switching resistors in<br>
R,2R,4R,8R steps to give 15 equal steps.<br>
Yet another US patent pub. no. US2007/0246943 'STAND ALONE WIND<br>
TURBINE SYSTEM ,APPARATUS AND METHOD SUITABLE FOR OPERATING<br>
THE SAME' mentions about using IGBT for step less dump control as per<br>
Fig-3.This system injects major characteristic harmonics in the lines as<br>
the line currents are trapezoidal.<br>
In prior art, control logic is to be implemented for discrete switching,<br>
which does not go well with the closed loop frequency control<br>
The present invention seeks to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks<br>
of the prior art.<br>
Objects of the invention:<br>
The major objectives of present invention are as follows:<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a 3-ph dump load which can<br>
be controlled in a step-less manner without injecting harmonics in<br>
the weak grid formed by stand-alone wind generators, diesel<br>
generators, and solar photovoltaic inverters.<br>
 <br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a dump load which<br>
does not inject reactive VARS (pf to be unity) into the weak grid.<br>
Yet another object is to integrate the control with overall closed<br>
loop frequency control in a seamless manner.<br>
A further object is to provide a system for 1-phase load also by<br>
adding a small third harmonic filter.<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings:<br>
Fig.1 shows a block diagram of thyristorized phase angle control as in<br>
prior art.<br>
Fig.2 shows thyristorized step switching of dump load as in the prior art.<br>
Fig.3 shows unit configuration of the IGBT based stepless dump load<br>
according to prior art.<br>
Fig.4 shows complete three-phase configuration of step-less dump load<br>
as invented.<br>
Fig.5 shows the block diagram for the control circuit according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The invention will now be described in detail in an exemplary embodiment<br>
as depicted in the accompanying drawings. There can however be other<br>
embodiments of this invention, all of which are deemed covered by this<br>
description.<br>
 <br>
Description<br>
A circuit configuration has been invented which PROVIDES results in to a<br>
simple cost effective step-less control of dump load without injecting<br>
harmonics in to the weak grid formed by Wind Generators, Diesel Sets<br>
and Solar Photovoltaic Inverters. The conventional methods are deficient<br>
as step-less dump loads generate a lot of harmonics which can excite<br>
resonances in the weak grid. As per the invention, an Inductor-Capacitor<br>
filter is connected through a single phase diode bridge between the two<br>
lines of 3 phase supply and is dimensioned in such a way that high<br>
frequency sine modulated switching of one IGBT across the capacitor<br>
results in to a sine AC current with predominant 3rd harmonic and a<br>
small amount of 5th harmonic . This process is repeated for other two<br>
phases The resultant line current is almost pure sine due to cancellation<br>
of 3rd harmonic and 5th harmonic to some extent. The controller is<br>
implemented in such a way that unity power factor is obtained. The<br>
frequency control signal causes a step-less change in the modulation<br>
index, resulting into a step less dump load.<br>
Fig.4 shows the configuration of the step-less dump load according to the<br>
invention, which is connected across a 3-phase grid designated as R-Y-B.<br>
The dump load is divided in three parts, connected to R-Y, Y-B and B-R<br>
phases respectively.<br>
The following description holds good for R-Y line, it is repeated for Y-B<br>
and B-R lines in exactly the same manner.<br>
 <br>
1.	The weak grid is designated as R-Y-B lines.<br>
2.	A diode bridge (4.1) is connected across R-Y lines.<br>
3.	An Inductor-Capacitor filter(L1-C1) is connected across the diode<br>
bridge. Inductor L1 is preferably connected split as shown in the<br>
figure(both halves can be coupled or uncoupled) to reject common<br>
mode noise generated by IGBT switching.<br>
4.	A resistor'Rl' is connected across the capacitor through a series<br>
connected IGBT or MOSFET(in the figure is shown as N channel<br>
MOSFET)<br>
5.	Resistor R1 is selected so as to load 1.4 to 1.5 times the required<br>
power per phase (line to line) assuming the IGBT is fully on. This is<br>
based on the effect of third harmonic cancellation in 3-ph system and<br>
assuming 20% over modulation is resorted to.<br>
6.	Capacitor is C1 selected so that RC time constant has near the time<br>
period of carrier frequency in the range 0.5 to 0.7 times.<br>
7.	Inductor L1 is chosen in conjunction with C1 to block switching carrier<br>
frequency to achieve a tuning frequency which is approx 10 % of<br>
carrier frequency.<br>
8.	This configuration is implemented in other two lines, resulting in<br>
cancellation of 3rd harmonics currents generated by each phase.<br>
Hence the resultant network line current is almost a pure sine wave at<br>
unity power factor.<br>
 <br>
9.	Referring to Fig.-5, IGBT is triggered by sine modulated voltage<br>
derived from R-Y. As the weak grid voltage is susceptible to<br>
harmonic distortion R-Y voltage is attenuated and filtered to<br>
remove harmonics from other sources(specially SPV<br>
inverters),giving a voltage lag of G.This lag is compensated by 61<br>
which also compensates the lag introduced by carrier frequency fc.<br>
Hence 61=6+1/fc is selected, to get unity power factor. The<br>
resultant signal is rectified and is multiplied with modulation Index<br>
(MI) .MI is derived as a function of frequency control signal VC. The<br>
output of multiplier is modulated with a high frequency carrier (at<br>
frequency =fc).The final output of the comparator is the desired<br>
Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) signal which goes to the gate of the<br>
IGBT(or MOSFET) The preferred carrier frequency is more than<br>
3600HZ,though lower frequency can also be used with the trade<br>
off as in that case higher values of filter 'L1' and 'C1' shall be<br>
required.<br>
10.	For single phase generators, the same configuration can be used<br>
with an additional 3rd harmonic filter.<br>
11. The load is varied steplessly by changing the modulation index as a<br>
function of frequency, hence can be integrated easily with the overall<br>
frequency control.<br>
 <br>
