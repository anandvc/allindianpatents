				<td>SOLUTION OF REDUCED COENZYME Q TO STABLY MAINTAIN<br>
REDUCED COENZYME Q AGAINST OXIDATION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a solution of reduced coenzyme Q to stably<br>
maintain reduced coenzyme Q against oxidation.<br>
Background Art<br>
Coenzyme Q is an essential component which is<br>
distributed in a wide variety of living organisms ranging<br>
from bacteria to mammals, and is known as a component of the<br>
electron transport system of cellular mitochondria in living<br>
organisms. It is also known that coenzyme Q undergoes<br>
oxidation/reduction cycles in the mitochondria and functions<br>
as an electron carrier in the electron transport system, and<br>
reduced coenzyme Q has an antioxidative effect. Human<br>
coenzyme Q is mainly composed of coenzyme Q10, having 10<br>
repeat: structures in its side chain, and about 40% to 90% of<br>
coenzyme Q present in living organisms is generally in its a<br>
reduced form. Examples of physiological functions of<br>
coenzyme Q include the activation of energy production<br>
through activating mitochondrial function, activation of<br>
cardiopulmonary" function, stabilization of cellular<br><br>
membranes, production of cells through an antioxidative'<br>
effects, and the like.<br>
Coenzyme Q is used in various applications, for example,<br>
oxidized coenzyme Q10 is used in the treatment of a<br>
congestive heart failure due to its effects on the heart.<br>
In addition to therapeutic usage, coenzyme Q is orally used<br>
as a nutritional supplement or a nutritional adjuvant like<br>
vitamins. However, coenzyme Q is insoluble in water because<br>
of its hydrophobicity, and is thus only actually used as an<br>
oral agent and a skin agent.<br>
In recent years, the exacerbation of various diseases<br>
due to an increase in oxidative stress in the blood has been<br>
reported. Typical examples of such diseases include<br>
arterial sclerosis, diabetic complications, and the like.<br>
These diseases are caused or exacerbated by lipid<br>
degeneration due to various types of oxidative stress in the<br>
blood. In order to decrease the influence of the oxidative<br>
stress, it is effective to administer an antioxidative agent<br>
to activate antioxidative ability. Vitamin E, a typical<br>
lipid-soluble antioxidative compound thought to be effective<br>
for suppressing lipid peroxidation, is widely used as an<br>
antioxidant for preventing diseases. It has recently been<br>
reported that the coexistence of reduced coenzyme Q10 is<br>
important for vitamin E to exhibit its the antioxidative<br>
activity sufficiently (Bowry et al., 1993, J. American<br><br>
Chemical Society, 115, 6029-6044), and the importance of<br>
coenzyme Q as well as vitamin E has been recognized as a<br>
lipid-soluble antioxidant.<br>
Since reduced coenzyme Q has a strong antioxidative<br>
effect by itself, the antioxidative activity in the blood<br>
can be effectively increased by supplying a sufficient<br>
amount of solubilized reduced coenzyme Q. By increasing the<br>
antioxidative activity in the blood, beneficial effects on<br>
many diseases that ate exacerbated due to reactive oxygen<br>
species, such as the prevention of angiopathy in ischemic<br>
recirculation and restenosis of arterial sclerosis, the<br>
prevention of angiopathy after cerebral infarction, the<br>
prevention of arterial sclerosis, the prevention of diabetic<br>
complications, etc., can be expected. Furthermore, using a<br>
new delivery form of reduced coenzyme Q, reduced coenzyme Q<br>
can be transferred into the body by a drip, and is thus<br>
useful for patients with serious conditions or patients with<br>
cerebropathy who cannot orally intake reduced coenzyme Q.<br>
In this way, it is expected that solubilization of reduced<br>
coenzyme Q will have many benefits for maintaining good<br>
health.<br>
There have previously been many studies on methods for<br>
solubilizing oxidized coenzyme Q10 (ubidecarenone or<br>
ubiquinone). Various methods for solubilizing oxidized<br>
coenzyme Q10, such as coating with a liposome, suspending<br><br>
with a surfactant or fat or oil, etc. have been reported<br>
(Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication Nos. 5-<br>
186340 and 7-69874 and PCT Japanese Translation Patent<br>
Publication No. 2000-510841). However, none of these<br>
methods have been put into practical use. One reason for<br>
this is that in order for oxidized coenzyme Q10 to exhibit<br>
antioxidative activity, the oxidized coenzyme Q10 must be<br>
converted into its reduced form by a reducing enzyme, but<br>
the amount of reduced coenzyme Q10 in the blood cannot be<br>
increased by injection administration because of the absence<br>
of the reducing enzyme in the blood, and therefore a<br>
decrease in blood oxidative stresses cannot be expected by<br>
an increase in the antioxidative activity. On the other<br>
hand, reduced coenzyme Q10 itself has antioxidative activity<br>
and is thus a promising substance for the above-described<br>
diseases. However, reduced coenzyme Q10 has not been put<br>
into practical use because of its tendency to undergo<br>
oxidation and instability. The production of liposome-<br>
coated reduced coenzyme Q10 for studying an oxidation-<br>
reduction enzyme has been reported (Kishi et al., 1999,<br>
BioFactors, 10, 131-138). However, this report only<br>
discloses methods for preparing liposomes immediately before<br>
use, and a solubilizing method for stably maintaining<br>
reduced coenzyme Q is not known.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an<br>
aqueous solution capable of stably maintaining reduced<br>
coenzyme Q against oxidation.<br>
As a result of studies to overcome the above-described<br>
problem, the inventors found a solution having a composition<br>
suitable for stably maintaining reduced coenzyme Q against<br>
oxidation, leading to the realization of the present<br>
invention.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a solution of coenzyme Q<br>
containing reduced coenzyme Q represented by formula (1), wherein the coenzyme Q is coated<br>
with a liposome which is prepared from a phosphatidyl choline and/or purified soybean lecithin<br>
or solubilized or emulsified with a surfactant, such as herein described, to stably maintain the<br>
reduced coenzyme Q against oxidation,<br><br>
(wherein n represents an integer of 1 to 12).<br>
The solution of the present invention can be used in<br>
medical products, food products, food compositions, drinks,<br>
fertilizers, cosmetics, animal feedstuff, or an antioxidant.<br>
Examples of a medical product include an injection, a fluid<br>
replacement, a liquid drug, eye drops, nose drops, ear drops,<br>
an oral agent, a skin agent, a scalp agent, and a stock<br>
solution. Besides humans, these medical products can be<br>
used for animals such as dogs, cats, rabbits, rats, mice,<br>
cows, horses, pigs, and the like.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for<br>
stabilizing reduced coenzyme Q comprising coating the<br><br>
reduced coenzyme Q with a liposome prepared from a<br>
phospholipid and/or glycolipid.<br>
Detailed Disclosure of Invention<br>
The present invention will be described in detail below.<br>
Coenzyme Q is represented by formulae (1) and (2):<br><br>
(wherein n represents an integer of 1 to 12). Reduced<br>
coenzyme Q is represented by formula (1), and oxidized<br>
coenzyme Q is represented by formula (2).<br>
Coenzyme Q used in the present invention contains<br>
reduced coenzyme Q represented by formula (1), in which the<br>
lower limit of the amount of reduced coenzyme Q in the total<br><br>
amount of coenzyme Q is preferably 20% by weight, and more<br>
preferably 40% by weight, and the upper limit of the amount<br>
may be 100% by weight or less, preferably less than 100% by<br>
weight, and more preferably 98% by weight or less. With<br>
respect to the ratio of reduced coenzyme Q in coenzyme Q, it<br>
was found that the effect of increasing the amount of blood<br>
coenzyme Q10 by administering an oral composition using<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 is increased with a reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
content of 20% by weight or more, and is significantly<br>
increased with a content of 40% by weight or more (Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 10-109933).<br>
The method for obtaining reduced coenzyme Q is not<br>
limited, and an example of a usable method comprises<br>
obtaining coenzyme Q by a conventional known process such as<br>
synthesis, fermentation, extraction from a natural source,<br>
or the like, and then concentrating a reduced coenzyme Q<br>
fraction from a chromatography eluate can be used. In this<br>
case, if required, a general reducing agent such as sodium<br>
borohydride, sodium dithionite (sodium hydrosulfite), or the<br>
like may be added to the coenzyme Q, for reducing oxidized<br>
coenzyme Q contained in the coenzyme Q to form reduced<br>
coenzyme Q by a conventional process, and then the obtained<br>
reduced coenzyme Q may be concentrated by chromatography.<br>
Reduced coenzyme Q can also be obtained by the reaction of<br>
the reducing agent with existing coenzyme Q of high purity.<br><br>
As the coenzyme Q used in the present invention, as<br>
shown in formulae (1) and (2), a coenzyme having 1 to 12 (n<br>
in each formula) repeat units in its side chain can be used.<br>
Particularly, a coenzyme having 10 side chain repeat units,<br>
i.e., coenzyme Q10, can be preferably used.<br>
The method for obtaining the solution of the present<br>
invention is not limited, and for example, the solution can<br>
be obtained by coating the coenzyme Q containing the reduced<br>
coenzyme Q with a liposome using an appropriate base to<br>
solubilize the coenzyme Q. The solution can also be<br>
obtained by solubilization or emulsification with an<br>
appropriate surfactant.<br>
As a lipid used as the base for the liposome, a<br>
phospholipid or glycolipid can be preferably used.<br>
Examples of phospholipids include egg yolk lecithin,<br>
purified soybean lecithin, phosphatidyl choline,<br>
phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidyl serine,<br>
sphingomyelin, dicetyl phosphate, stearylamine, phosphatidyl<br>
glycerol, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidyl inositol amine,<br>
cardiolipin, ceramide phosphoryl ethanolamine, ceramide<br>
phosphoryl glycerol, a mixture of these lipids, and the like.<br>
However, a lipid containing phosphatidyl choline at a high<br>
content is preferred, and purified soybean lecithin is most<br>
preferred. The content of phosphatidyl choline of the<br>
purified soybean lecithin is preferably 0.01% by weight or<br><br>
more, and more preferably 0.1% by weight or more.<br>
Examples of glycolipids include digalactosyldiglyceride,<br>
galactosyldiglyceride sulfuric acid esters,<br>
galactosylceramide, galactosylceramide sulfuric acid esters,<br>
lactosylceramide, ganglioside G7, ganglioside G6,<br>
ganglioside G4, digalactosylceramide, and a mixture of these<br>
lipids.<br>
With respect to the composition ratio of the coenzyme Q<br>
to the phospholipid or glycolipid, 1 mole or more of<br>
phospholipid or glycolipid may be present relative to 1 mole<br>
of coenzyme Q, but 10 moles or more of phospholipid or<br>
glycolipid are preferable.<br>
Also, sterol may be added to the base. The upper limit<br>
of the amount of sterol added is preferably 1/5, and more<br>
preferably 1/10 of the weight of phospholipid or glycolipid.<br>
As the sterol, cholesterol is most preferably used, but<br>
another sterol may be used.<br>
Although the content of the coenzyme Q in the solution<br>
of the present invention depends upon what the solution is<br>
to be used for, the lower limit is preferably 0.0001% by<br>
weight, and the upper limit is preferably 50% by weight.<br>
More preferably, the lower limit is 0.001% by weight, and<br>
the upper limit is 30% by weight, and most preferably, the<br>
lower limit is 0.01% by weight, and the upper limit is 15%<br>
by weight.<br><br>
Liposome coating can be performed by a process known to<br>
persons skilled in the art. For example, a solvent of a<br>
mixture of phospholipid and reduced coenzyme Q dissolved in<br>
the solvent such as chloroform, ethanol, or the like is<br>
evaporated to dryness, and then the residue is dispersed in<br>
an appropriate buffer by an ultrasonic treatment or the like.<br>
The above operation is preferably performed at a low<br>
temperature (for example, 4°C) in an inert gas atmosphere of<br>
nitrogen or the like, for suppressing oxidation of the<br>
reduced coenzyme Q and the lipid.<br>
Next, solubilization or emulsification with a<br>
surfactant will be described.<br>
As the surfactant, a commonly used product may be used.<br>
Examples of the surfactant include anionic surfactants such<br>
as a carboxylate anionic surfactant, a sulfonate anionic<br>
surfactant, a sulfate anionic surfactant, a phosphate<br>
anionic surfactant, and the like; cationic surfactants such<br>
as an amine salt cationic surfactant, a quaternary ammonium<br>
salt cationic surfactant, and the like; ampholytic<br>
surfactants such as an aminocarboxylate ampholytic<br>
surfactant, a carboxybetaine ampholytic surfactant, a<br>
sulfate ampholytic surfactant, a sulfonic acid ampholytic<br>
surfactant, and the like; nonionic surfactants such as an<br>
ether nonionic surfactant, an ether ester nonionic<br>
surfactant, an ester nonionic surfactant, a block polymer<br><br>
nonionic surfactant, a nitrogen-containing nonionic<br>
surfactant, and the like; other surfactants such as a<br>
natural surfactant, a surfactant derived from a protein<br>
hydrolysate, a polymeric surfactant, a surfactant containing<br>
titanium and silicon, a fluorocarbon surfactant, and the<br>
like.<br>
As the surfactant, a nonionic surfactant is preferred,<br>
and a poly-solvate surfactant such as Tween 80 or the like,<br>
or polyoxyethylene hardened castor oil such as HCO 60 or the<br>
like is more preferred.<br>
The concentration of the surfactant in the solution of<br>
the present invention is generally 0.01 to 20% by weight,<br>
more preferably less than 1% by weight from the viewpoint of<br>
antioxidation of the reduced coenzyme Q, and most preferably<br>
0.1% by weight or less. However, when a surfactant solution<br>
and reduced coenzyme Q10 powder are separately packed so that<br>
the solution can be prepared before use without<br>
consideration of oxidation by storage, when the storage<br>
period is very short, or when storage is made under<br>
anaerobic conditions in which a deoxidizer coexists in an<br>
airtight container, a solution or emulsion with 1% by weight<br>
or more of surfactant can be prepared. The content of the<br>
coenzyme Q is the same as that for liposome coating.<br>
The solution prepared as described above may further<br>
contain pharmaceutically allowable raw materials for drug<br><br>
formulations, which are appropriately added by a<br>
conventional method. The raw materials for drug<br>
formulations which can be added are not limited, and for<br>
example, an emulsifier, a tensing agent, a buffer, a<br>
solubilizing agent, a flavoring agent, an antiseptic agent,<br>
a stabilizer, an antioxidant, and the like may be added.<br>
The method for preserving the solution composition of<br>
the present invention is not limited, and a conventional<br>
method such as cold storage, anaerobic storage using an<br>
airtight container, light-shielding storage, or the like may<br>
be used.<br>
When the solution of the present invention prepared as<br>
described above is stored at a low temperature or room<br>
temperature, the reduced coenzyme Q can be stably maintained<br>
against oxidation. The phrase "can be stably maintained"<br>
means that the residual amount of the reduced coenzyme Q is<br>
80% or more of the concentration at the start of storage.<br>
The storage period during which this percentage is<br>
maintained is preferably 1 week or more, more preferably 1<br>
month or more, and most preferably 1 year or more.<br>
The solution containing the reduced coenzyme Q<br>
according to the present invention can be widely used for<br>
medical treatment, cosmetics, foods, gardening, dairy<br>
products, and the like. Example applications of the<br>
solution include an injection, an infusion solution, a fluid<br><br>
drug, eye drops, a fluid drug for internal application, a<br>
lotion agent, a hair tonic, a cosmetic emulsion, a spray<br>
liquid, an aerosol, a drink, a liquid fertilizer, a storage<br>
solution, and the like. In medical applications, the<br>
solution can also be used as a storage solution for organ<br>
transplant. Furthermore, the solution may be used for<br>
animals, fish and seafood, and used as animal feedstuff.<br>
The solution can also be used as an antioxidative solution<br>
for storing fresh food such as meat, fish, and the like.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Although the present invention will be described in<br>
further detail below with reference to examples and<br>
preparation examples, the present invention is not limited<br>
to these examples and preparation examples.<br>
(EXAMPLE 1) Influence of lecithin on oxidation stability of<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 in a liposome containing reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10<br>
As the lecithin, egg yolk lecithin (produced by Wako<br><br>
Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) and purified soybean<br>
lecithin Lecinol S10 and Lecinol S10EX (produced by Nihon<br>
Chemicals Co., Ltd.) were used. Lecinol S10 contains 25 to<br>
30% by weight of phosphatidyl choline, and Lecinol S10EX<br>
contains 95% by weight or more of phosphatidyl choline. A<br>
liposome containing reduced coenzyme Q10 was prepared using<br>
the lecithin as described below. Namely, a lecithin-<br>
chloroform solution (3.2 mg/ml) was added to an ethanol<br>
solution (1 mg/ml) of coenzyme Q10 (oxidized type :reduced<br>
type = 5:95 (ratio by weight)), and dissolved. After the<br>
solvent was completely removed by an evaporator under<br>
reduced pressure, HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) was added to<br>
the residue, and a lipid film was dispersed by shaking to<br>
prepare a milky-white suspension. The suspension was<br>
subjected to ultrasonic treatment at 4° C for 30 minutes in a<br>
nitrogen stream to prepare a liposome, and macromolecules<br>
were removed by centrifugation. In order to prevent<br>
oxidation of the reduced coenzyme Q10 during the operation,<br>
the operation was carried out as rapidly as possible.<br>
The oxidation stability of the reduced coenzyme Q10 in<br>
the liposome was evaluated by high performance liquid<br>
chromatography (HPLC).<br>
The amount of reduced coenzyme Q10 in the liposome<br>
containing 0.05% of reduced coenzyme Q10 immediately after<br>
preparation was about 90% by weight using egg yolk lecithin.<br><br>
and about 95% by weight using purified soybean lecithin<br>
(Lecinol S10 and Lecinol S10EX). It was thus found that the<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 is slightly oxidized during preparation<br>
of the liposome using the egg yolk lecithin, while the<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 is little oxidized during preparation of<br>
the liposome using the purified soybean lecithin.<br>
Also, the influence of storage temperature on oxidation<br>
of the reduced coenzyme Q10 was examined by storing the<br>
liposome in air. The results are shown in Figs. 1 to 3, in<br>
which each value is an average with n = 2.<br>
In cold storage (4°C) for 30 days, 90% or more of the<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 was maintained in the liposome prepared<br>
using each of the three types of lecithin. After storage<br>
for 60 days, the reduced coenzyme Q10 was little oxidized in<br>
the liposome prepared using Lecinol S10 or Lecinol S10EX,<br>
while about 25% of the reduced coenzyme Q10 was oxidized in<br>
the liposome prepared using the egg yolk lecithin (Fig. 1).<br>
After storage at 23°C for 30 days, 90% or more of the<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 in the liposome prepared using either<br>
Lecinol S10 or Lecinol S10EX was maintained in a reduced<br>
state, and 80% or more of the reduced coenzyme Q10 in the<br>
liposome prepared using the egg yolk lecithin was maintained<br>
in a reduced state. However, after storage for 60 days, 90%<br>
or more of the reduced coenzyme Q10 remained in the liposome<br>
with Lecinol S10, while with Lecinol S10EX and the egg yolk<br><br>
lecithin, about 35% and about 55%, respectively, of the<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 were oxidized (Fig. 2).<br>
After heating at 40°C with the egg yolk lecithin, the<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 was mostly oxidized. While with Lecinol<br>
S10, the reduced coenzyme Q10 was decreased by about 50%<br>
after storage for 2 weeks, and the amount of reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 remaining after 30 days was about 20%. With the<br>
liposome using Lecinol S10EX, about 70% of the reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 remained as a reduced type after 30 days (Fig.<br>
3).<br>
As a result, it was found that purified soybean<br>
lecithin Lecinol is suitable as a liposome base for the<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10, compared with egg yolk lecithin.<br>
Particularly, purified soybean lecithin Lecinol S10EX having<br>
a high content of phosphatidyl choline is stable at 40°C.<br>
However, Lecinol S10 exhibits higher stability at 25"C, and<br>
thus a stable storage period can be obtained by<br>
appropriately selecting the purified soybean lecithin<br>
according to the storage conditions for the product used.<br>
In applications requiring long-term storage, purified<br>
soybean lecithin, particularly lecithin having a high<br>
content of phosphatidyl choline, is excellent as the base.<br>
However, for short-term storage, a liposome with egg yolk<br>
lecithin may be used.<br><br>
(EXAMPLE 2) Stability of solubilizing solution of reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 using a surfactant<br>
A solution of reduced coenzyme Q10 using a surfactant<br>
was prepared by the method described below, and the<br>
oxidation stability under storage was evaluated. As the<br>
surfactant, Polysolvate 80 (Tween 80) or polyoxyethylene<br>
hardened castor oil (HCO 60) was used, and an aqueous<br>
solution of 1% by weight or 0.1% by weight of the surfactant<br>
was prepared. Then, the reduced coenzyme Q10 was added to<br>
the aqueous solution so that the final concentration of the<br>
solution was 0.05% by weight. Fig. 4 shows the influence of<br>
the surfactant concentration on the oxidation stability of<br>
the reduced coenzyme Q10 during air storage of the solution<br>
at 23°C. In Fig. 4, each value is an average with n = 2.<br>
It was found that the oxidation stability of the reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 is strongly influenced by the surfactant<br>
concentration, and the solution prepared with a low<br>
surfactant concentration has high stability. The results of<br>
this test indicate that with a surfactant concentration of<br>
0.1% by weight, the reduced coenzyme Q10 can be stably stored<br>
at 23°C for about 1 month. While with a surfactant<br>
concentration of 1% by weight, the reduced coenzyme Q10 can<br>
be stably stored for 1 week, and is rapidly oxidized<br>
thereafter. Therefore, when preparing a solution or<br>
emulsion with a surfactant, the concentration of the<br><br>
surfactant used is decreased to prepare a solution which can<br>
be stored for a longer period of time. A solution or<br>
emulsion with 1% by weight or more of a surfactant can be<br>
used under conditions in which the solution or emulsion is<br>
prepared before use, or the solution or emulsion is stored<br>
for a short period or stored in an airtight condition such<br>
as a completely anaerobic condition.<br>
