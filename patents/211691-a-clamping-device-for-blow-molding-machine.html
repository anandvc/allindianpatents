				<td>CLAMPING MECHANISM FOR BLOW MOLDING MACHINE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a clamping mechanism for<br>
blow molding machine and particularly to a clamping mechanism<br>
for blow molding machine which can open and close a mold and<br>
clamp the mold without creation of any eccentricity.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
In general, the blow molding machine clamps a blow cavity<br>
mold by use of a clamping device.<br>
The clamping device may comprise, for example, a pair of<br>
clamping plates, that is, first and second clamping plates<br>
disposed facing each other, on each of which the corresponding<br>
one of split molds for defining a blow cavity mold is fixedly<br>
mounted. A movable plate disposed on the opposite side of the<br>
first clamping plate to the second clamping plate is fixedly<br>
connected to the second clamping plate through a tie rod. A<br>
driving device is fixedly mounted on the movable plates.<br>
The driving device urges the first clamping plate in the<br>
clamping direction with its reaction created moving the movable<br>
plate in the opposite direction to the first clamping plate.<br>
When the second clamping plate connected to the movable plate<br>
through the tie rod is moved in the mold closing direction, the<br>
mold will be closed and clamped.<br>
The blow cavity mold can be opened by actuating the driving<br>
means in the reverse direction.<br>
In such a clamping device for the blow molding machine, the split molds must<br>
simultaneously reach the clamping position on clamping. Otherwise, one of the<br>
split molds would abut a preform or a preform carrying member or a bottom<br>
mold prior to the other split mold. This may damage the preform or the preform<br>
carrying member of the bottom mold. Therefore, both the right and left split<br>
molds are required to be synchronized on clamping of the blow cavity mold.<br>
US 5698243 although discloses a structure of a mold apparatus but fails to<br>
provide a device which is capable of controlling the clamp position of the split<br>
mold. US 5388981, US 5698243, US 4449996 and US 4283218 eventhough<br>
disclose molding apparatuses but none of them proposes a "V-shaped link", "a<br>
connecting shaft", "a guide member", "a movable plate" or "a first and second link<br>
arms"which may obviate frequent adjustment of the positioning means.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a clamping device for<br>
blow molding machine which can establish the mold closing position<br>
independently without associating with the driving means ad can open and close<br>
the split molds in synchronization with each other.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a clamping device for blow<br>
molding machine which can be of a simplified and size-reduced structure for<br>
opening and closing the split molds in synchronization, thus reducing the<br>
manufacturing cost.<br>
One aspect of the present invention provides a clamping device for blow molding<br>
machine, comprising:<br>
first and second clamping plates each having two sides, and arranged facing<br>
each other;<br>
a pair of split molds forming a blow cavity mold being respectively mounted on<br>
the facing sides of the first clamping<br>
plate and the second clamping plate;<br>
a movable plate disposed on a side of the first clamping<br>
plate opposite from a side on which the second clamping plate<br>
is disposed;<br>
a plurality of tie rods extending through the first<br>
clamping plate and fixedly connected to the movable plate and<br>
the second clamping plate, and supporting the first clamping<br>
plate movable between the movable plate and the second clamping<br>
plate;<br>
a driving device for driving the movable plate and the<br>
first clamping plate away from or toward each other; and<br>
a positioning mechanism provided independently of the driving<br>
device, moving the first clamping plate and the second clamping<br>
plate in synchronization, and controlling the clamping position<br>
of the split molds.<br>
In this aspect of the present invention, the positioning<br>
mechanism is provided independently of the driving device that<br>
drives the first clamping plate and the second clamping plate.<br>
Thus, the positioning mechanism can synchronously move the<br>
first clamping plate and the second clamping plate without<br>
association with the driving device and may mechanically<br>
control the clamping plates of the two split molds.<br>
The positioning mechanism may be disposed between the<br>
movable plate and the first clamping plate. The positioning<br>
mechanism may easily be disposed since such a space is<br>
relatively large.<br>
The positioning mechanism may further comprise a V-shaped<br>
link mechanism. The V-shaped link mechanism may include a<br>
connecting shaft disposed at a middle position between the<br>
movable plate and the first clamping plate; a first link arm<br>
rotatably supported by the connecting shaft and the movable<br>
plate respectively; and a second link arm rotatably supported<br>
by the connecting shaft and the first clamping plate<br>
respectively.<br>
Since the V-shaped link mechanism is sufficient to have<br>
only three rotation points, it may be of a simplified and<br>
size-reduced structure to reduce the manufacturing cost.<br>
The positioning mechanism may further comprise a guide<br>
member which guides the movement of the connecting shaft in a<br>
direction crossing an opening-and-closing direction of the<br>
split molds when the split molds open or close.<br>
The guide member may be of a simplified and size-reduced<br>
structure to reduce the manufacturing cost since it is<br>
sufficient to guide only the movement stroke of the connecting<br>
shaft.<br>
In such a manner, the mold closing position can be<br>
established by the pair of link arms and the guide member<br>
independently of the stroke of mold opening and closing. As a<br>
result, it is not necessary to adjust the positioning mechanism<br>
even in the case where the blow cavity mold is replaced by another .<br>
Therefore, the replacement of blow cavity mold may simply and<br>
easily be performed, resulting in a reduction in the operating<br>
time.<br>
The first link arm and the second link arm forming the<br>
V-shaped link mechanism may maintain the V-shape during a time<br>
between a clamping of the split molds and an opening of the split<br>
molds.<br>
In such an arrangement, the mold can smoothly be opened<br>
or closed without need of any additional force since the V-<br>
shaped link mechanism maintains its V-shape at all times.<br>
The positioning mechanism may be located between the first<br>
clamping plate and the second clamping plate. This can directly<br>
position the first clamping plate and the second clamping plate<br>
in a good manner.<br>

in Fig. 2 .<br>
Description of the Embodiment<br>
One embodiment of the present invention will now be<br>
described in detail with reference to the drawings.<br>
Figs. 1 to 3 show a clamping mechanism for blow molding<br>
machine according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As can be seen from Figs. 1 and 2, the clamping mechanism<br>
for blow molding machine 10 comprises a first clamping plates<br>
12, a second clamping plate 14, a movable plate 16, four tie<br>
rods 18, a clamping cylinder 20 and toggle mechanisms 22 which<br>
serve as a driving device, and a positioning mechanism 24.<br>
The first clamping plate 12 and the second clamping plate<br>
14 are disposed facing each other. One of two split molds 28<br>
forming a blow cavity mold 26 is mounted on the respective one<br>
of the opposing faces of the first clamping plate 12 and the<br>
second clamping plate 14.<br>
Each of the two split molds 28 includes a mounting plate<br>
30 mounted on its backside. The split mold 28 is fixedly mounted<br>
on the first clamping plate 12 or the second clamping plate 14<br>
through the corresponding mounting plate 30.<br>
A bottom mold (not shown) is disposed on the two split molds<br>
28 . A bottom-mold lifting mechanism 32 raising and lowering the<br>
bottom mold is supported by a lifting mechanism support member<br>
33 at an upper position between the first clamping plate 12 and<br>
the second clamping plate 14. The first clamping plate 12 and<br>
the second clamping plate 14 are disposed at equal distance from<br>
the center of the bottom mold.<br>
The movable plate 16 is disposed on the side of the first<br>
clamping plate 12 opposite from the side on which the second<br>
clamping plate 14 is disposed.<br>
The four tie rods 18 extend through the first clamping<br>
plate 12 and fixedly connected to the movable plate 16 and the<br>
second clamping plate 14. Thus, the first clamping plate 12 is<br>
movably supported between the movable plate 16 and the second<br>
clamping plate 14 through the tie rods 18.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the four tie rods 18 are arranged at<br>
positions corresponding to the four corners of the respective<br>
clamping plates 12 and 14 and the movable plate 16. Two lower<br>
tie rods 18 among the four tie rods 18 are slidably supported<br>
by support members 36 and 38 which are fixed on a machine base<br>
34.<br>
Consequently, the movable plate 16 and the second clamping<br>
plate 14 moves together with the tie rods 18. The first clamping<br>
plate 12 is movable along the four tie rods 18 between the movable<br>
plate 16 and the second clamping plate 14.<br>
The clamping cylinder 20 is attached to one face of the<br>
movable plate 16 opposite from the other face facing the first<br>
clamping plate 12. The clamping cylinder 20 includes a cylinder<br>
rod 40 extending through the movable plate 16 toward the first<br>
clamping plate 12.<br>
The pair of toggle mechanisms 22 are disposed<br>
symmetrically in the vertical direction and between the first<br>
clamping plate 12 and the movable plate 16.<br>
Each of the toggle mechanisms 22 has a first link arm 44<br>
rotatably mounted at one end on a cross head 42 which is attached<br>
to the end of the cylinder rod 40, a pair of second link arms<br>
46 which are laterally located and rotatably mounted at one end<br>
on the movable plate 16 (see Fig. 3), and two pairs of third<br>
link arms 48 which are laterally located and rotatably mounted<br>
at one end on the first clamping plate 12 (see Fig. 3) . The other<br>
ends of these first, second and third link arms 44 to 48 are<br>
rotatably connected to a rotation shaft 50.<br>
In such an arrangement, when the cylinder rod 40 of the<br>
clamping cylinder 20 is extended from the mold opening position<br>
of Fig. 1, the upper toggle mechanism 22 forces the rotation<br>
shaft 50 upwardly through the first link arm 44 while the lower<br>
toggle mechanism 22 similarly forces the rotation shaft 50<br>
downwardly. Thus, the second and the third link arms 46 and 48<br>
will be extended to close the mold.<br>
Ultimately, as shown in Fig. 2, the second and the third<br>
link arms 46 and 48 will be positioned on a straight line to<br>
clamp the mold.<br>
When the cylinder rod 40 is retracted from the mold<br>
clamping position of Fig. 2, the procedure will be reversed to<br>
unclamp and open the mold.<br>
The positioning mechanism 24 is provided between the<br>
movable plate 16 and the first clamping plate 12 independently<br>
of the driving device including the clamping cylinder 20 and<br>
the toggle mechanisms 22. The positioning mechanism 24 moves<br>
the movable plate 16 and the first clamping plate 12 in<br>
synchronization and controls the mold clamping position of the<br>
two split molds 28.<br>
More specifically, the positioning mechanism 24 has a<br>
V-shaped link mechanism 53 and a positioning plate 58 serving<br>
as a guide member. The V-shaped link mechanism 53 comprises a<br>
pair of laterally disposed link arms 54 and 56 that connect the<br>
movable plate 16 with the first clamping plate 12 and fold at<br>
a connecting shaft 52, and the positioning plate 58 as a guide<br>
member that makes the connecting shaft 52 slidable at a<br>
predetermined position.<br>
In other words, the V-shaped linkage mechanism 53 has the<br>
connecting shaft 52 and the first link arms 54 and the second<br>
link arm 56. The opposing ends of the first link arm 54 are<br>
rotatably supported by the movable plate 16 and the connecting<br>
shaft 52, respectively. The opposing ends of the second link<br>
arm 56 are rotatably supported by the first clamping plate 12<br>
and the connecting shaft 52, respectively.<br>
These first and second link arms 54 and 56 are maintained<br>
in their V-shaped configuration at all times. Particularly,<br>
even though the mold is clamped as shown in Fig. 1 to maximize<br>
the spacing between the movable plate 16 and the first clamping<br>
plate 12, the first link arm 54 and the second link arm 56<br>
maintain their V-shaped configuration. When the movable plate<br>
16 and the first clamping plate 12 are moved to open or close<br>
the mold, the connecting shaft 52 will be moved upwardly or<br>
downwardly by a predetermined distance.<br>
The connecting shaft 52 includes a roller follower 60 which<br>
is mounted thereon substantially at its central location.<br>
The positioning plate 58 is fixed on the machine base 34<br>
and includes slide groove 62 extending in the vertical<br>
direction.<br>
The roller follower 60 slidably engages in the slide groove<br>
62. As the roller follower 60 is moved in the slide groove 62,<br>
52<br>
the up-and-down movement of the connecting shaft 52/will be<br>
guided. The length of the slide groove 62 is selected to ensure<br>
52<br>
the desired stroke of movement in the connecting shaft 5/<br>
The slide groove 62 includes a hardened plate 64 for<br>
preventing any wear due to the movement of the cam follower 60.<br>
Since the positioning mechanism 24 has the V-shaped<br>
linkage mechanism 53 including the link arms 54 and 56 and the<br>
connecting shaft 52, the movable plate 16 and the first clamping<br>
plate 12 are moved line-symmetrically along a vertical line<br>
passing through the connecting shaft 52. Therefore, the first<br>
clamping plate 12 and the second clamping plate 14 can be driven<br>
in synchronization and yet the mold clamping position of the<br>
two split molds 28 can be positioned.<br>
Since the positioning mechanism 24 has the positioning<br>
plate 58 for guiding the up-and-down of the connecting rod 52,<br>
the lateral movement of the connecting shaft 52 is regulated<br>
by the slide groove 62 in the positioning plate 58, even though<br>
the movable plate 16 and the first clamping plate 12 tend to<br>
do their eccentric movement at the opening or closing of the<br>
mold. Therefore, the eccentric movement in the movable plate<br>
16 and the first clamping plate 12 can be avoided to perform<br>
the synchronized opening or closing of the mold at all times.<br>
Since the positioning plate 58 has previously been fixed<br>
at the position of the connecting shaft 52, the mold clamping<br>
position can surely be positioned when the mold is to be clamped .<br>
Since the pair of link arms 54 and 56 are sufficient to<br>
be connected only at three points and the positioning plate 58<br>
is sufficient to have its dimensions corresponding to the stroke<br>
of vertical movement in the connecting shaft 52, the positioning<br>
mechanism 24 can be simplified and reduced in size to reduce<br>
the manufacturing cost.<br>
Moreover, the positioning mechanism 24 is provided<br>
independently of the driving device so that the pair of link<br>
arms 54 and 56 and the positioning plate 58 can only establish<br>
the mold closing position irrespectively of the stroke of mold<br>
opening or closing. As a result, it is not necessary to adjust<br>
the positioning mechanism 24 even after the blow cavity mold<br>
26 has been replaced by another.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the aforementioned<br>
embodiment, but may be carried out in any of various modified<br>
forms without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
Although the embodiment of the present invention has been<br>
described as to the positioning mechanism provided between the<br>
movable plate and the first clamping plate, for example, the<br>
positioning mechanism 24 may be arranged between the first<br>
clamping plate 12 and the second clamping plate 14. In such a<br>
case, the first clamping plate 12 and the second clamping plate<br>
14 may be connected to each other through the V-shaped link<br>
mechanism 53. The connecting shaft 52 in the V-shaped link<br>
mechanism 53 may be guided in the similar manner.<br>
Thus, the first clamping plate 12 and the second clamping<br>
plate 14 can directly be positioned to provide a good<br>
positioning operation.<br>
Although the embodiment of the present invention has been<br>
described as to two clamping plates for clamping one blow cavity<br>
mold, the present invention may similarly be applied to any<br>
other case, for example, in which two blow cavity molds are to<br>
be clamped by two or more (e.g., four) clamping plates.<br>
Although the embodiment of the present invention has been<br>
described as to the driving device including the clamping<br>
cylinder and the toggle mechanisms, the present invention may<br>
use any other general driving means such as a straight hydraulic<br>
driving device, ball-screw type servo motor driving device or<br>
the like.<br>
Although the embodiment of the present invention has been<br>
described as to the roller follower rotatably moved in the slide<br>
groove of the positioning plate, it may be replaced by any other<br>
slide member.<br>
