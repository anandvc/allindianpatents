				<td>[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[0001]<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a seat device for a motorcycle in which an opening portion of a helmet<br>
containing box is opened/closed with a seat.<br>
[0002]<br>
[Related Art]<br>
Conventionally is known, for example, from Japanese Utility Model Publication No. Hei 6-30627, a motorcycle having a structure in which a helmet containing box is provided under a seat and a helmet is accommodated or taken in or out of the helmet containing box by opening/closing the seat.<br>
In this related art structure, the openable/ closable seat is arranged over an upper opening portion of the containing box and a foldable stopper plate is raised to support a cross-plate under the seat at a high position in the helmet containing state, whereby when a driver sits on the seat in the helmet containing state, the seat can be prevented from being sunk by the cross-plate.<br>
[0003]<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
Incidentally, a helmet has a large dimension in the height direction.  In particular, a helmet of a full-face type for covering the entire head is designed to cover from the vertex of the head to the neck, and therefore, it has a larger dimension in the height direction.<br>
As a result, in a helmet containing box provided<br><br>
under a seat, the dimension in the height direction tends to become larger.  Accordingly, the height of the helmet containing box becomes larger, and thereby the height of the seat arranged on the helmet containing box inevitably becomes larger.<br>
[0004]<br>
On the contrary, in a scooter-type motorcycle, it is desirable to set a seat at a low position for enhancing the easy-riding when a driver is get on/off the motorcycle.<br>
Meanwhile, for example, in a power unit swing type motorcycle, a vertically swingable power unit is arranged under a containing box, and accordingly, if a bottom portion of the containing box is set at a lower position, it becomes difficult to ensure the vertical swing stroke of the power unit.  On the other hand, in relation to a helmet to be accommodated in a containing box, it is difficult to set the height of the containing box shorter.<br>
Accordingly, in the case where a seat is provided in such a manner as to opening/closing an upper opening portion of a containing box, it is difficult to set the seat at a low position.<br>
[0005]<br>
The present invention has been made to solve the above-described problems.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a seat device for a motorcycle in which a helmet containing box is opened/closed by a seat arranged over the helmet containing box, which is capable of reasonably solving the above-described inconsistent two requirements by making the height of the seat as low as possible for improving the easy-riding when a driver gets on or off the motorcycle (first requirement) while setting the position of the bottom of the containing box at the same height as that of the related art motorcycle in relation to equipment such as a swing type power unit arranged under the bottom of the containing box (second requirement).<br>
[0006]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
To achieve the above object, according to an invention described in claim 1, there is provided a seat device for a motorcycle in which an upper opening portion of a helmet containing box is openably covered with a seat, characterized in that an opening portion is provided in part of a bottom plate of the seat, and a vertically movable plate is provided in the opening portion separately from the bottom plate of the seat.<br>
[0007]<br>
With the configuration of the invention described<br>
in claim 1, when a helmet is accommodated in the containing box, only the movable plate provided separately from the bottom plate of the seat is moved upward to ensure a space for containing a helmet in height direction, with a result that it is possible to make the height of the seat lower.<br>
[0008]<br>
According to an invention described in claim 2, in addition to the invention described in claim 1, the movable plate is configured such that the outer peripheral portion thereof is overlapped onto the inner peripheral edge of the opening portion provided in the bottom plate of the seat.<br>
With the configuration of the invention described in claim 2, when a load of a driver sit on the seat is applied to the movable plate in a state in which the helmet is taken out of the containing box, such a load is supported by the bottom plate of the seat.<br>
[0009]<br>
According to an invention described in claim 3, in addition to the invention described in claim 1, a soft protective member is provided on the lower surface of the movable plate.<br>
With the configuration of the invention described in claim 3, in the state in which the helmet is accommodated in the containing box, the vertex of the<br>
portions of the containing box according to the present invention in a state in which a helmet is accommodated in the containing box.<br>

Fig. 1 is a side view showing the appearance of a scooter-type motorcycle to which the present invention is applied.  In a motorcycle 1, a front fork 4 for supporting a front wheel 3 is steerably supported by means of a head pipe 2a fixed to the front end of a frame 2, and a handlebar 5 is provided on a steering shaft 4a extending upward from the front fork 4.<br>
A down tube 2b is sharply tilted downward and rearward from the head pipe 2a.  The lower portion of the down tube 2b is branched into right and left main frames 2c which extend rearward.  The main frame 2c has a front portion 2d extending at a low level; an intermediate portion 2e tilted moderately upward and rearward; and a rear portion 2f extending rearward.  The right and left main frames 2c are connected to each other by means of cross-members.<br>
[0012]<br>
A fuel tank 6 is arranged between the front<br>
portions 2d, extending at a low level, of the main frames 2c.  A unit swing type power unit 8 for mounting/supporting a rear wheel 7 is supported via a link mechanism 11 by a bracket 2g provided at a boundary between the intermediate portion 2e and the front portion 2d. .The power unit 8 includes an engine 9 on its front side and a transmission case 10.  A rear cushion unit 12 is interposed between the transmission case 10 and the rear portion 2f of the main frame 2c.<br>
[0013]<br>
The front portion of the frame 2 is covered with a front cover 13; the periphery of the handlebar 5 is covered with a handle cover 14; a headlight unit 15 including right and left winkers and the like is arranged on the front surface of the handle cover 14; and a portion over the front wheel 3 is covered with a front fender 16.  The front portions 2d, extending at a low level, of the main frames 2c, are covered with a low-floor type floor 17.  Also, a center cover 18 is provided extending upward and rearward from the floor 17; a rear cover 19 is provided extending rearward from the center cover 18; and a rear fender 20 is provided extending downward and rearward from the rear cover 19.<br>
The above covers constitute the appearance of the<br>
motorcycle.  A seat 30, which is openable/closable with its front end taken as a hinge, is provided over the center cover 18 and the rear cover 19.<br>
[0014]<br>
A containing box 21 for accommodating a helmet is arranged under the seat 30.  The periphery of the containing box 21 is covered with the center cover 18 and the rear cover 19.  An upper opening portion 2la of the containing box 21 is openably/closable covered with the seat 30.<br>
Figs. 1 and 2 both show a state in which the seat 30 is tilted substantially in a horizontal direction to cover the opening portion 2la of the containing box 21.<br>
[0015]<br>
A stay 21c is provided on a front wall 21b of the containing box 21 in such a manner as to project forwardly therefrom.  An oil tank 22 is accommodated and arranged in a space between the front wall 21b and the center cover 18. In Figs. 1 and 2, reference numeral 23 designates an opening/closing lid which is opened to expose an oiling port of the fuel tank 6 for oiling.<br>
An oiling portion 22a of the oil tank 22 projects upward from an opening portion 2Id provided in the stay 21c.  The oiling portion 22a with a cap 22b is blocked by<br>
the front portion of the seat 30.  When the seat 30 is raised to open the containing box 21, the oiling portion 22a with the cap 22b of the oil tank 22 are exposed.<br>
[0016]<br>
The seat 30 openably/closably covering the upper opening portion 21a of the containing box 21 includes, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, a bottom plate 31 made from a hard resin or the like; a cushion member 32 made from a thick urethane foam or the like, which is stuck on the bottom plate 31; and a leather skin member 33 made from a synthetic leather or the like.<br>
A hinge arm 24 is fixed to a front portion 31a, extending at a low level, of the bottom plate 31, and arm portions 24a suspended from both sides of the hinge arm 24 are rotatably supported via a pivot 25 by a pivotably supporting portion 21e provided at the front end of the stay 21c projecting forward from the front wall 21b of the containing box 21.  Thus, the seat 30 can be turned leftward (counterclockwise) in Fig. 2 around the pivot 25 provided at the front end of the seat 30, and raised to open the containing box 21.<br>
[0017]<br>
An opening portion 34 formed into a circular or polygonal shape is provided in a longitudinally<br>
intermediate portion of the seat bottom plate 31.  A ring-shaped guide portion 35 serving as a rib is projected upward on the bottom plate 31 in such a manner as to be positioned outside the opening portion 34.  A rack portion 36 is formed on the peripheral portion of the inner opening portion 34 of the guide portion 35 in such a manner as to surround the opening portion 34.<br>
A reinforcing sheet 37 made from a coarse-mesh cloth and so forth having permeability is stuck at a portion, corresponding to the opening portion 34 of the bottom of the cushion member 32 provided on the bottom plate 31 of the seat 30.  In the example shown in the figure, the reinforcing sheet 37 is provided in such a manner as to cover the ring-shaped guide portion 35. <br>
[0018]<br>
A disk-type movable plate 38, which is made from the same material as that of the bottom plate 31, is vertically movably arranged in the opening portion 34 separately from the bottom plate 31.<br>
To be more specific, a peripheral portion 38a of the movable plate 38, which is formed into a stepped portion higher than the main portion of the movable plate 38, is placed on the rack portion 36 provided around the inner periphery of the opening portion 34 such that the<br>
outer peripheral portion 38a of the movable plate 38 is overlapped to the inner peripheral portion of the opening portion 34 via the rack portion 36.  The outside diameter of the movable plate 38 is set such that a gap is provided between the outer periphery of the movable plate 38 and the inner periphery of the guide portion 35.<br>
[0019]<br>
A radially intermediate portion of the movable plate 38 is slightly tilted upward toward the center of the movable plate 38, and has at its central portion a large-diameter circular hole portion 39.  The inside diameter of the hole portion 39 is set such that part of the vertex of a helmet H accommodated in the containing box 21 provided thereunder is fitted into the hole portion 39.  The reinforcing sheet 37 provided at the portion, corresponding to the opening portion 34, of the bottom of the cushion member 32 is placed on the movable plate 38.<br>
A protective member 40 made from sponge rubber or the like is stuck on the lower surface of the movable plate 38.  In the example shown in the figure, the ring-shaped protective member 40 is provided, on the lower surface of the movable plate 38, at the peripheral portion of the hole portion 39.<br>
[0020]<br>
Fig. 4 shows a state in which the helmet H is accommodated in the containing box 21 and the seat 30 as a lid body is closed.  The opening portion 34 formed in the sheet bottom plate 31 and the movable plate 38 are arranged such that the vertex Hi of the helmet H accommodated in the containing box 21 as shown in Fig. 4 is positioned directly under the movable plate 38.<br>
When the seat 30 is closed as shown in Figs. 4 and 5, that is, the helmet H is accommodated in the containing box 21, part of the vertex HI of the helmet H put in the containing box 21 is brought in contact with the movable plate 38, more specifically, the hole portion 39 of the movable plate 38.  In other words, by closing the seat 30 from top to bottom, the movable plate 38 is brought in contact with the vertex HI of the helmet H placed under the movable plate 38, and is then lifted up. [0021]<br>
The upward movement of the movable plate 38 by the pushing-up action of the vertex HI of the helmet H tends to occur, but is easily allowable by the deformation of the cushion member 32.  The flow of intake or exhaust air of the cushion member 32 by the deformation of the cushion member 32 is smoothly performed because the reinforcing sheet 37 stuck on the cushion member 32 has permeability as<br>
described above.  As a result, the cushion member 32 is smoothly and easily deformed.<br>
Also for the upward movement of the movable plate 38 as described above, the radial movement of the outer peripheral portion of the movable plate 38 is restricted by the guide portion 35, that is, the vertical movement is restricted for smooth operation.  Thus, it prevents the movable plate 38 from freely moving within the horizontal plane in the opening portion 34, but is vertically movable at the fixed position.<br>
[0022]<br>
As a result, referring to Fig. 4, specifically, to Fig. 5, the movable plate 38 is lifted up by a specific height S by the contact with the vertex HI of the helmet H. In other words, even if the overall height of the seat 30 is made low by the height S, the helmet H can be accommodated in the containing box 21.  That is to say, according to the present invention, the overall height of the seat 30 can be made lower by the height S.<br>
Since the soft protective member 40 made from sponge rubber or the like is stuck on the lower surface of the movable plate 38, even if part of the vertex HI of the helmet H is slid in contact with the movable plate 38, it is protected by the protective member 40, so that the<br>
surface of the helmet H is prevented from being damaged.<br>
[0023]<br>
Fig. 6 shows a state in which the helmet H is taken out of the containing box 21 and then the seat 30 is closed.  The opening/closing of the seat 30 is performed, as described above, with the pivot 25 at the front end taken as a hinge.<br>
The movable plate 38 is pushed down by the returning action of the cushion member 32 to the original shape, and it is held in a state in which the peripheral portion 38a is placed on the rack portion 36 at the peripheral portion of the opening portion 34 of the seat bottom plate 31.<br>
When a driver is sit on the seat 30 in the state in which the helmet H is taken out of the containing box 21, a load of the driver is applied not only to the seat 30, but also to the movable plate 38.<br>
[0024]<br>
Since the movable plate 38 is configured such that the peripheral portion 38a is vertically overlapped on the rack portion 36 provided around the inner periphery of the opening portion 34 as shown in Figs. 3 and 6, the load of the driver applied to the movable plate 38 is supported by the sheet bottom plate 31.<br>
Accordingly, although the movable plate 38 is provided in the opening portion 34 in such a manner as to be vertically movable, and allowed to move upward when the helmet H is accommodated in the containing box 21, it is possible to sufficiently ensure the function of the seat. [0025]<br>
Fig. 7 shows a modification of the present<br>
invention, in which an opening portion 134 is provided in a bottom plate 31 of a seat 30 and a flap-shaped movable plate 138 is provided in such a manner as to be continuous to part of a peripheral edge of the opening portion 134.  A soft protective member 140 made from sponge rubber or the like is stuck on the lower surface of the movable plate 138, like the previous embodiment.<br>
A flexible hinge portion 138a is provided at a portion which is continuous to the bottom plate 31 of the movable plate 138.  In a state in which the seat 30 is closed to contain the helmet H in the containing box, the flap-shaped movable plate 138 is moved upward around the hinge portion 138a to thus contain the vertex HI of the helmet H in the opening portion 134. [0026]<br>
Fig. 8 is another modification of the present invention, in which a movable plate 238 provided vertically<br>
movably in an opening portion 34 formed in a bottom plate 31 of a seat 30 is configured as a blind plate shape with no hole at its central portion.  At the central portion of the movable plate 238 is provided a recess 239 curved in accordance with the shape of part of the vertex of the helmet H.  Like the previous embodiment, a ring-shaped protective member 40 is provided on the lower surface of the peripheral portion of the recess 239.<br>
Like the embodiment shown in Figs. 2 to 6, when the seat 30 is closed in a state in which the helmet H is put in the containing box 21, part of the vertex HI of the helmet H, placed directly under the movable plate 238, acts to push up the movable plate 238 to thus contain the helmet H in the containing box.<br>
[0027]<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
The present invention having the above configuration exhibits the following effects:<br>
According to the invention described in claim 1, there is provided a seat device for a motorcycle in which an upper opening portion of a helmet containing box is openably/closably covered with a seat, characterized in that an opening portion is provided in part of a bottom plate of the seat, and a vertically movable plate is<br><br>
provided in the opening portion separately from the bottom plate of the seat.  As a result, when part of the vertex of the helmet is positioned under the seat bottom plate in a state in which the helmet is accommodated in the containing box and the seat is closed, only the movable plate provided separately from the seat bottom plate is brought in contact with part of the vertex of the helmet and is moved upward.<br>
Accordingly, the height of the seat bottom plate can be lowered to the extent that the vertex of the helmet interferes with the seat bottom plate and is sunk in the seat.  As a result, since part of the helmet containing space in the height direction can be ensured over the seat bottom plate, the seat can be set at a lower position.<br>
[0028]<br>
With the configuration of the invention described in claim 1, therefore, the height of the seat of the scooter-type motorcycle is made as low as possible to improve the easy-riding, when a rider gets on or off the motorcycle, while the height of the bottom of the helmet containing box is set at the same required height as that of the related art structure to ensure the motion of the unit swing type power unit without changing the arrangement of equipment, to thereby ensure the function of the equipment.<br>
[0029]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 2, in addition to the invention described in claim 1, the movable plate is configured such that the outer peripheral portion (peripheral portion) thereof is overlapped onto the inner peripheral edge of the opening portion provided in the bottom plate of the seat.  As a result, when a load of a driver sit on the seat is applied to the movable plate in a state in which the helmet is taken out of the containing box, such a load is supported by the bottom plate of the seat.<br>
Accordingly, when a driver sits on the seat after the helmet is taken out of the containing box, the load of the driver is supported by the seat bottom plate and thereby the seat is prevented from being sunk.  In this way, although the opening portion is provided in the seat bottom plate and the vertically movable plate is provided in the opening portion, it is possible to sufficiently ensure as much function of the seat as the prior art structure gives. [0030]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 3, in addition to the invention described in claim 1, a soft protective member is provided on the lower surface of the<br>
movable plate.  As a result, in the state in which the helmet is accommodated in the containing box, the vertex of the helmet or its neighborhood is brought in contact with the movable plate via the protective member made from sponge rubber or the like provided on the lower surface of the movable plate.<br>
Accordingly, when the vertex of the helmet is brought in contact with the movable plate, the surface of the helmet is prevented from being damaged by the protective member.<br>
