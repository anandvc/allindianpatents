DESCRIPTION<br>
MAGNET ROTOR AND AC GENERATOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an alternating-current generator and a magnet<br>
rotor used in an alternating-current generator.<br>
Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-197376, filed in<br>
Japan on July 6, 2005, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
An alternating-current generator (hereinafter called "AC generator") is provided<br>
for connecting a magnet rotor to a rotating shaft of a vehicle engine or the like and is used<br>
in such applications as transmitting starter motor rotations to the magnet rotor by means of<br>
a clutch mechanism thereby rotating a rotating shaft of an engine, converting the rotational<br>
energy when rotating to electrical energy in order to recharge batteries, and supplying<br>
electric power to auxiliary electrical devices. The conventional magnet rotors provide a<br>
structure wherein a boss is connected to a rotating shaft and fixed to a bottom of a cup-<br>
shaped yoke. The boss comprises a part protruding from the bottom of the yoke and<br>
extending radially to form a flange, and a socket and spigot type clutch alignment member<br>
is formed at an outer edge of the flange. The clutch alignment member is formed to align<br>
the position of a one-way clutch mechanism, and an outer race of the one-way clutch<br>
mechanism is inserted in and engages with an inner circumference of the clutch alignment<br>
member, and then the outer race is fixed to the clutch alignment member by bolts (for<br>
example refer to Patent Document 1).<br>
[Patent Document 1] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No.<br>
2001-251828<br><br>
2<br>
[0003]<br>
However, the conventional magnet rotors required the boss with a larger outer<br>
shape to provide the clutch alignment member. As the boss becomes larger, the magnetic<br>
rotor becomes larger and the weight increases. Furthermore, rivets and the like are<br>
necessary to fix the boss to the yoke thus requiring an increase in the number of parts and<br>
an increase of production steps. Still furthermore, since a part of the boss protrudes from<br>
the bottom of the yoke, reduction in size of the magnetic rotor along an axial length<br>
thereof is prevented.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of such circumstances, it is a primary object of the present invention to<br>
reduce the size and increase the ease of production of the AC generator and the magnet<br>
rotor.<br>
[0004]<br>
A first aspect of the present invention that solves the problems recited above<br>
provides a magnet rotor comprising a boss connecting with a rotating shaft, and a yoke<br>
comprising permanent magnets fixed to a side of a cylindrical part extending from a<br>
bottom fixed to the boss, and wherein a socket and spigot type clutch alignment member<br>
which engages with a clutch mechanism and aligns the position of the clutch mechanism<br>
to the yoke is formed on the yoke.<br>
In this magnet rotor, the position of the clutch mechanism is aligned by the clutch<br>
alignment member which is formed on a yoke, and the clutch mechanism is directly fixed<br>
to the yoke.<br>
[0005]<br>
A second aspect of the present invention provides a magnet rotor of the first<br>
aspect wherein the clutch alignment member is formed on an entire circumference of an<br>
outer periphery of the bottom of the yoke.<br>
In this magnet rotor, by contacting the clutch alignment member to an entire<br>
circumference of an outer edge of the clutch mechanism, the position of the clutch<br><br>
3<br>
mechanism can be aligned with high precision and the clutch mechanism can be attached<br>
to the yoke directly.<br>
[0006]<br>
A third aspect of the present invention provides the magnet rotor of the first or<br>
second aspect, wherein the clutch alignment member is formed on a curved portion which<br>
is formed by inwardly bending the bottom of the yoke.<br>
In this magnet rotor, by bending the bottom of the yoke at a position matched to<br>
the outer diameter of the clutch mechanism, the depth required by the clutch alignment<br>
member is secured without decreasing the strength of the bottom.<br>
[0007]<br>
A fourth aspect of the present invention is an AC generator comprising a magnet<br>
rotor according to the first, second or third aspect recited above, a stator in which a coil is<br>
wound and is disposed opposite to the permanent magnets.<br>
In this AC generator, the clutch mechanism is directly attached to the yoke using<br>
the clutch alignment member which is formed on the yoke, and generates inductive<br>
electricity in the coil by rotating the permanent magnets together with the rotating shaft.<br>
EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008]<br>
According to the present invention, since the socket and spigot type clutch<br>
alignment member which engages with the clutch mechanism is formed on the yoke, the<br>
boss smaller than that of the conventional art in which the clutch alignment member is<br>
formed by extending the boss can be obtained easily, and the length of the motor in an<br>
axial direction can be reduced.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0011]<br>
Herewith, the best mode for carrying out the claimed invention will be described<br>
in detail below with reference to the drawings.<br>
FIG 1 is a cross-sectional view of an AC generator relating to the first<br>
embodiment. The AC generator 1 is an outer rotor-type generator and thus provides a<br>
magnet rotor 3 connected to an engine rotating shaft 2 as well as a stator 4 disposed inside<br>
a magnet rotor 3 and fixed to an engine case (not shown) or the like.<br>
[0012]<br><br>
5<br>
A magnet rotor 3 comprises a boss 10 mounted on a rotating shaft 2 and a yoke<br>
11 fixed tin which the boss 10 is fixed by caulking, and permanent magnets 12 are fixed<br>
on an inner circumference of the yoke 11. The permanent magnets 12 are magnetized to<br>
arrange magnetic poles in an alternating fashion circumferentially. The boss 10<br>
comprises a bore 13 in its center, and a distal end portion of the bore 13 provides a tapered<br>
bore matched to the shape of the tip of a rotating shaft 2. A proximal end portion of the<br>
boss 10 comprises an annular flange 14 extends outward along a radial direction, whereby<br>
the annular flange 14 is fixed to the yoke 11 such that the bottom 15 abuts a distal end<br>
surface of the flange 14. Furthermore, the boss 10 and the rotating shaft 2 are fixed by a<br>
nut 16 so as to coaxially rotate together.<br>
[0013]<br>
As shown in FIG. 1 through FIG. 3, yoke 11 has a cylindrical shape partially<br>
closed by a bottom. Furthermore, a protrusion 17A is protrusionally formed so as to<br>
extend outward along the radial direction on a side 17 by pressing to detect the rotational<br>
position of the magnet rotor 3 and the rotating shaft 2. The bottom 15 of the yoke 11 is<br>
deep drawn to reduce the length in the axial direction of the yoke 11 at an inner<br>
circumferential region compared to a circumferential edge. A stepped region 21 of a<br>
circumferential edge of a recess 20 on the bottom 15 by deep drawing provides a socket<br>
and spigot type clutch alignment member 22 by adjusting an inner circumferential surface<br>
21A to parallel to an axis by milling. Furthermore, a circumferential region inward from<br>
the clutch alignment member 22 is deep drawn in a direction to further reduce the length<br>
of the bottom 15 in the axial direction, and a bore 24 in which the boss 10 can be inserted<br>
is formed in the center of the recess 23 formed herewith. The diameter of the recess 23<br>
of the inner circumferential surface is nearly equal to the outer diameter of the flange 14<br>
of the boss 10, and the thickness of the flange 14 of the boss 10 is nearly equal to the<br>
depth of the recess 23. Thereby, the recess 23 receives the flange 14, and the outer<br>
surface 20A of recess 20 and the outer surface 14Aof the flange 14 are nearly coplanar.<br>
Furthermore, a plurality of bores 25 is opened circumferentially in the recess 23. As<br><br>
6<br>
shown in FIG. 1, screws 32 are inseited into these bores 25 to fix an outer race 31 of a one-<br>
way clutch mechanism 30.<br>
[0014]<br>
The one-way clutch mechanism 30 supports an inner race 34 in an inner<br>
circumferential surface of an annular outer race 31 so as to coaxially rotate the inner race<br>
34 around the axis through bearings 33, and an inner circumferential surface of an inner<br>
race 34 is rotatively supported by the rotating shaft 2 through bearings 35. An edge of a<br>
proximal end of the inner race 34 extends beyond the outer race 31 and then extends<br>
outward along the radial direction.<br>
The outer circumference of the enlarged diameter member 34A forms a gear that<br>
meshes with a gear of a starter motor which is not shown.<br>
[0015]<br>
Also, the stator 4 of this AC generator 1 comprises a stator core 40. The stator<br>
core 40 is formed by laminating plates of magnetic material in the axial direction and has<br>
an inner diameter in which the nut 16 which is screwed on the tip of the rotating shaft 2<br>
can be inserted. Furthermore, the stator core 40 provides a plurality of teeth 40 A which<br>
extend outward along a radial direction and arranged circumferentially at regular intervals.<br>
Each of the outer circumferences of these teeth 40 A, an insulator 41 is attached and then a<br>
coil 42 is wound. The wound coil 42 is electrically connected to a battery or electrical<br>
parts (not shown) or the like.<br>
[0016]<br>
Herewith, effects of this embodiment will be described.<br>
When fabricating the AC generator 1, the yoke 11 shaped as a cylindrical part<br>
partially closed by a bottom is fabricated by pressing. When forming the bottom 15 of<br>
the yoke 11, drawing is performed to simultaneously form recesses 20 and 23, and then a<br>
central region is punched to form a bore 24. In this process, as shown in FIG. 4, the<br>
stepped region 21 of the recess 20 is formed so as to form a gradual curved surface and to<br>
form a taper shape contracting toward the center. Then, the curved surface 2IB formed<br>
on the inner circumferential surface of the stepped region 21 is milled annularly and<br><br>
7<br>
parallel to the axis to form the clutch alignment member 22 on the entire circumference<br>
thereof as shown in FIG. 2. This clutch alignment member 22 is made from the curved<br>
surface 21B formed by drawing, and thereby secures sufficient height and provides the<br>
required strength to interact with the one-way clutch mechanism 30 without increase the<br>
thickness of the plate which forms the bottom 15.<br>
[0017]<br>
Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 5, the boss 10 is inserted in the bore 24, and the<br>
flange 14 is abutted to an outer surface of the recess 23. Then, an extremity of the boss<br>
10 is compressed thereby forming a brim 18 as shown in FIG. 2, and the boss 10 is fixed<br>
by interposing the circumferential edge of the bore 24 of the yoke 11 between the brim 18<br>
and the flange 14. Afterwards, centering alignment of the outer race 31 is performed to<br>
engage the outer race 31 with the inner circumference of the clutch alignment member 22<br>
of the yoke 11, and then the one-way clutch mechanism 30 is fixed to the bottom 15 of the<br>
yoke 11 by the screws 32. Then, the permanent magnets 12 are directly fixed to the inner<br>
circumference of the side 17 of the yoke 11. Finally, the rotating shaft 2 is inserted in an<br>
inner bore of the one-way clutch mechanism 30 and the boss 10, and tapered regions of<br>
the rotating shaft 2 and the boss 10 abut each other and then are fixed by the nut 16.<br>
[0018]<br>
When starting an engine, the rotation of a starter motor is transmitted to the inner<br>
race 34 of the one-way clutch mechanism 30. The rotation of the inner race 34 is<br>
transmitted to the yoke 11 through the outer race 31, and the boss 10 that is fixed to the<br>
yoke 11 rotates the rotating shaft 2.<br>
In this way, the engine is started by rotating the rotating shaft 2. Then, upon<br>
exceeding a predetermined number of rotations of the rotating shaft 2, the engagement<br>
between the outer race 31 of the one-way clutch mechanism 30 that rotates together with<br>
the rotating shaft 2 and the inner race 34 is interrupted, and the inner race 34 comes to a<br>
halt. Thereby, the starter motor and the engine are separated. Furthermore, as the<br>
rotating shaft 2 and the yoke 11 rotate together, the permanent magnets 12 rotate around<br>
the stator 4, inductive electricity is induced in each coil 42, and the battery which is not<br><br>
8<br>
shown is recharged and electrical power is supplied to auxiliary electrical devices.<br>
[0019]<br>
In accordance with this embodiment, since the clutch alignment member 22 is<br>
formed on a yoke 11, enlargement of a boss 10 is avoided, while allowing the alignment of<br>
the position and the fixing of the one-way clutch mechanism 30. In prior art, since the<br>
clutch alignment member is formed by extending the boss beyond the bottom of the yoke<br>
and then extending outward along the radial direction, the boss and the yoke overlap each<br>
other in the axial direction, and as a result, a thickness of the AC generator in the axial<br>
direction increases. Therefore, the elimination of such overlapping region allows a<br>
reduced thickness of the AC generator 1 in the axial direction. Furthermore, the size<br>
reduction for the boss 10 provides a weight reduction for the AC generator 1. Moreover,<br>
rivets to fix the boss 10 and the yoke 11 can be eliminated.<br>
[0020]<br>
In addition, since the clutch alignment member 22 is formed on the entire<br>
circumference, the position of the one-way clutch mechanism 30 can reliably be aligned.<br>
Also, since the clutch alignment member 22 is formed annularly along the entire<br>
circumference, the member is easily fabricated, the circularity of the member is easily<br>
attained, and the centering of the one-way clutch mechanism 30 can be performed<br>
accurately.<br>
Furthermore, since the clutch alignment member 22 is formed on the yoke 11 by<br>
utilizing the region in which the thickness in the axial direction expands as a result of deep<br>
drawing of the bottom 15, the clutch alignment member 22 can be formed without<br>
sacrificing strength of the bottom 15. Moreover, it is needless to increase the thickness<br>
of the bottom 15 in order to form the clutch alignment member 22, thereby avoiding a<br>
weight increase.<br>
[0021]<br>
Herewith, the second embodiment of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to FIG 6. The same numerals are used for structural elements identical to that<br>
of the first embodiment, and repetitive descriptions are omitted.<br><br>
9<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, an AC generator 50 comprises a magnet rotor 53 and a stator<br>
4.<br>
The magnet rotor 53 comprises a boss 10 fixed to a bottom 15 of a yoke 11. An<br>
annular protrusion 60 on the periphery of a recess 23 of the bottom 15 is formed by<br>
drawing and extends outward in the axial direction, and a socket and spigot type clutch<br>
alignment member 62 is formed by utilizing an annular step formed at the outer<br>
circumferential side of the protrusion 60. The clutch alignment member 62 comprises an<br>
outer circumferential surface 61A which is parallel to the axis by milling on a curved<br>
surface on the step formed on the outer circumference. On a circumferential surface of a<br>
distal end portion of a one-way clutch mechanism 70 that engages with the clutch<br>
alignment member 62, an annular engaging part 72 is formed by concaving a central<br>
region of an outer race 71 in the axial direction.<br>
[0022]<br>
In the case of fabricating the magnet rotor 53, drawing is performed on the<br>
bottom 15 of the yoke 11, and the recess 23 and the protrusion 60 are simultaneously<br>
formed. Then, the curved surface formed during the formation of the protrusion 60 is<br>
milled from an outward along the radial direction to form the annular outer circumferential<br>
surface 61 A. The clutch alignment member 62 formed in this way utilizes the curved<br>
surface formed by drawing, and thus reliably provides sufficient height arid achieves the<br>
required strength to engage with the one-way clutch mechanism 30 without increasing the<br>
thickness of the plate which forms the bottom 15. Furthermore, the engaging part 72 of<br>
the outer race 71 is engaged with the clutch alignment member 62 from the outside to<br>
align the position of the one-way clutch mechanism 70, and then, the one-way clutch<br>
mechanism 70 is directly fixed to the yoke 11 by the screws 32.<br>
[0023]<br>
In accordance with this embodiment, since the clutch alignment member 62<br>
which extends outward along the radial direction is formed on an entire circumference of<br>
the bottom 15 of the yoke 11, and since the one-way clutch mechanism 70 is aligned and<br>
directly fixed to the yoke 11 by using the clutch alignment member 62, the same effects of<br><br>
10<br>
the first embodiment are obtained.<br>
[0024]<br>
The present invention is not restricted to the above described embodiments and<br>
wide applications can be allowed. For example, it is possible to use the clutch alignment<br>
member 22 without milling after the deep drawing. It is possible to form the clutch<br>
alignment member 22 by a method such as milling. Furthermore, the rotating shaft 2 is<br>
not limited to the rotating shaft of an engine. The clutch mechanism is not limited to a<br>
one-way type. Also, the fixing of the boss 10 and the yoke 11 can be provided by<br>
welding.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>

In a magnet rotor comprising a boss engaging a rotating shaft, and a yoke<br>
comprising permanent magnets fixed to a side of a cylindrical part extending from a<br>
bottom fixed to the boss, a socket and spigot type clutch alignment member which<br>
engages with a clutch mechanism and aligns the position of the clutch mechanism to the<br>
yoke is formed on the yoke. As a result, since the socket and spigot type clutch<br>
alignment member which engages with the clutch mechanism is formed on the yoke, the<br>
boss smaller than that of the conventional art in which the clutch alignment member is<br>
formed by extending the boss can be obtained easily, and the length of the motor in an<br>
axial direction can be reduced.<br><br>
