DIFFUSER DEVICE, PARTICULARLY IN SPRINKLER SYSTEMS FOR DISPERSING WATER AND OTHER SIMILAR LIQUIDS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention generally finds application in the field of irrigation and liquid distribution plants, and particularly relates to a sprinkler diffuser device for dispersing water and other similar liquids.<br>
The device may be advantageously used in agriculture, as well as in other industrial fields, for instance in mining, as dust suppressor and for cooling potentially self-igniting materials.<br>
Background art<br>
A number of sprinkler diffuser devices for irrigation are known. US-A-5,415,348 discloses a diffuser device that comprises a hollow central body, defining a longitudinal direction and having an inlet portion and an outlet portion. It further has a sleeve for connection to a water feed line, on which sleeve the inlet portion of the central body may be screwed. A one-piece, convergent nozzle is placed within the sleeve and the central body, which has an externally visible closed ring, and is designed to accelerate water to a deflector member that is linked to the central body. The convergent nozzle has an annular flange at its discharge orifice, which flange extends radially outwards, and from which a plurality of elongate members branch off, which are designed to support the closed ring. During assembly, the connection sleeve is slideably fitted in the closed ring until abutment against an O-ring seal, which is positioned on the annular flange.<br>
An apparent drawback of this arrangement consists in the need of using an O-ring to provide a sealing action between the convergent nozzle and the connection sleeve. This feature complicates the fabrication of the device, and consequently involves an increase of overall costs, and forces the user to periodically monitor<br><br>
the wear of the O-ring, and replace it when required.<br>
There often arises the need of replacing the convergent nozzle with another nozzle having a different section, to adapt the amount of distributed water to different irrigation requirements. If this is the case, the sleeve remains connected to the water feeding line, whereas the central body is removed therefrom. Particularly, during removal of the central body, the sleeve slides relative to the nozzle with this latter remaining in its seat inside the central body. Thus, in order to remove the nozzle, the central body needs first to be removed, and an additional operation is required to slide the nozzle off the central body, hence the sleeve and the nozzle cannot be jointly removed from the central body in one operation.<br>
In this solution, the deflector member is removably linked to the central body, and may be replaced by manually exerting thereon a force in the direction of the longitudinal axis, and by simultaneously rotating so as to disengage it from appropriate snap means. This operation may require a considerable effort due to the hardness and rigidity of the snap means and may cause fatigue for the operator, particularly when there is a large number of deflector members to be replaced, as is often the case.<br>
Furthermore, the deflector member is formed by a plate, which has a specially formed face mounted on one side thereof, and appropriately a second specially formed face on the other side. A shortcoming of this arrangement consists in having to fabricate three distinct parts and later assemble them, which involves an increase of fabrication costs. Also, the two specially formed faces are not easily removable from the plate. This feature, in addition to the fact that no more than two specially formed faces cannot be fitted thereon, considerably limits the possibility of adapting the device to different applications.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
A primary object of the present invention is to obviate the abovementioned<br><br>
drawbacks by providing a sprinkler diffuser device which is reliable and can maintain its features unchanged over time, without requiring a particularly burdensome maintenance.<br>
A particular object is to provide a diffuser device that is easily adaptable to different needs and uses.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a diffuser device whose components may be replaced in a quick and practical manner, without requiring a large amount of force.<br>
Yet another particular object is to provide a diffuser device that is cost-effective, so as to provide cost reduction effects both for the manufacturer and the final user.<br>
These objects, as well as others which will be more apparent hereafter, are fulfilled, according to claim 1, by providing a diffuser device, particularly for sprinkler systems for dispersing water and other similar liquids, which comprises an at least partly hollow central body, defining a longitudinal axis, a connection sleeve for connecting to a feed line, which sleeve is removably linked to the central body, a convergent nozzle for accelerating the liquid interposed between the central body and the sleeve, a deflector member disposed downstream from the nozzle, for diverting the stream in a substantially transverse direction to distribute the fluid outwards, characterized in that it comprises first means for snap connection of the nozzle to the sleeve. The first snap connection means are designed to hold the nozzle in an axially locked position relative to the sleeve upon mounting and dismounting thereof relative to the central body.<br>
Thanks to this arrangement, the nozzle and the sleeve may be removed from the central body in one simple operation, instead in two separate operations, which will facilitate the use of the most appropriate nozzle for each particular application.<br>
Preferably, a support member extends from the central body for removable<br><br>
anchorage of the deflector member, and has guide means for allowing selective insertion and axial lock of the deflector member sliding along a substantially transverse plane.<br>
Thanks to this feature, the distributor device will be easily adapted to different needs and uses, and particularly will be replaceable in a quick and practical manner without requiring a large amount of force.<br>
Advantageously, the deflector member is substantially plate-like, with a first specially shaped face turned toward the outlet section of the nozzle and a second specially shaped face opposite to the former. Thanks to this feature, the deflector member with its two specially formed faces is made of one piece and may be fabricated by a single molding operation, which allows to reduce costs, as compared with the fabrication of three separate parts.<br>

Detailed description of a preferred embodiment<br>
Wit particular reference to the above figures, a diffuser device according to the invention is described, which is generally designated with numeral 1, particularly designed for sprinkler systems for dispersing water and other similar liquids.<br>
The diffuser device 1 comprises a central body 2 which is at least partly hollow, to which a sleeve 3 for connection to a feed line (not shown) is removably linked. The central body 2 is substantially cylindrical and defines a longitudinal axis L. A convergent nozzle 4 is interposed between the central body 2 and the sleeve 3, to accelerate the liquid toward a substantially plate-like deflector member 5.<br>
The deflector member 5 is removably linked on a support member 6, in a position downstream of the nozzle 4, to divert the flow in a substantially transverse direction and distribute the fluid outwards. Particularly, the support member 6 extends from the central body 2, and may be made monolithic therewith.<br>
According to the invention, the distribution member 1 comprises first means 7 for snap connection of the nozzle to the sleeve 3. Nozzle 4, upon mounting and dismounting thereof relative to central body 2, is held in an axially locked position relative to the sleeve 3 by the first snap connection means 7.<br>
Thus, when the nozzle 4 of a diffuser device 1 is to be replaced, it is sufficient to dismantle the central body 2, in one operation, from the assembly formed by the nozzle 4 and the sleeve 3, which latter remains connected with the liquid feed line, to release the nozzle 4 from the first snap connection means 7, connect the new replacement nozzle 4, and mount the central body 2 on the new assembly with the<br><br>
replacement nozzle 4, and mount the central body 2 on the new assembly with the nozzle 4 and the sleeve 3.<br>
The deflector member 5 may be selectively inserted in the support member 6 with the assistance of suitable guide means 8 which allow the deflector member 5 to slide along a plane that is substantially transverse to the longitudinal axis L, which preventing it from axially displacing.<br>
Suitably, the support member 6 comprises at least one projection 9 which may be selectively snap-engaged on at least one corresponding recess or cavity 10, which is formed on the deflector member 5. The projection 9 and the corresponding cavity 10 allow to also selectively lock the deflector member 5 transverse to the longitudinal axis L and together form second snap connection means 11.<br>
More particularly, the first snap connection means 7 comprise a ball and socket joint 12 whis is formed by a rounded portion 13 projecting axially from the nozzle 4 and snap-engageable with a complementary surface 14 formed on the sleeve 3.<br>
The ball and socket joint 12 allows the nozzle 4 to rotate freely about the longitudinal axis L relative to the sleeve 3 and to tilt by a predetermined angle relative to the same axis.<br>
In order to avoid undesired liquid leakages at the connection of the nozzle 4 and the sleeve 3, this latter has a substantially frusto-conical portion 15 coaxial with the longitudinal axis L, for providing a sealing action against a substantially frusto-conical surface 16 of the nozzle 4. Particularly, the substantially frusto-conical cone portion 15 of the sleeve 3 and the substantially frusto-conical cone surface 16 of the nozzle 4 may have substantially equal taper angles, to provide the highest adherence and most effective sealing action therebetween.<br>
As mentioned above, the function of the deflector member 5 is to divert the substantially axial stream of the liquid issuing from the nozzle 4 along a plurality of<br><br>
substantially transverse directions. Such operating feature is obtained by forming the deflector member 5 a first specially shaped face 17 turned toward the outlet section 18 of the nozzle 4, which is positioned at a predetermined axial distance from said outlet section 18.<br>
Suitably, the axial dimension of the deflector member 5 is such as to allow insertion thereof in the guide means 8, with the first specially shaped face 17 turned either toward the outlet section 18 of the nozzle 4 or in a substantially 180° rotated position. Furthermore, the deflector member 5 may be formed with a second specially shaped face 19 opposite the former. When the deflector member 5 is inserted in the 180° rotated position, the second specially shaped face 19 also causes the substantially axial stream of liquid issuing from the nozzle 4 to be diverted along a plurality of transverse directions. Thanks to this feature, the user may replace the first specially shaped face 17 with the second 19, by simply sliding off the deflector member 5 along the guide means 8, by means of rotation thereof by 180° and insertion thereof again in the support member 6.<br>
The possibilities to divert the liquid stream are further increased thanks to the fact that the deflector member 5 may also include a removable insert 20, which may be fitted on the top of the second specially shaped face (19) and defining a third specially formed face 21. Suitably, the specially shaped faces 17, 19, 21 or only some of them, have a plurality of radial grooves, to cause a plurality of distinct liquid jets. The radial grooves may cover the whole round angle or only a fraction thereof.<br>
When the stream is diverted from the axial direction to the transverse directions, it exerts a substantially vertical thrust on the stream-diverting shaped face 17, 19, 21, as may be verified by applying the fluid momentum theorem for steady state flows.<br>
In case that the stream is directed to the third specially formed face 21, the vertical thrust of the fluid urges the removable insert 20 against the deflector member 5<br><br>
insert 20 from being displaced or detached during operation, but may also make manual dismounting thereof from the deflector member 5 more difficult.<br>
In order to solve this problem, the deflector member 5 has one or more cavities 22 level with the outer edge 23 of the removable insert 20, to facilitate removal thereof by insertion of the tip of a screw driver or similar tool.<br>
Suitably, the connection between the sleeve 3 and the central body 2 may be provided by a threaded coupling, particularly by providing a thread 24 on the sleeve 3 to be screwed with a corresponding threaded portion 25 of the central body 2.<br>
Also, in order to prevent the nozzle 4 from rotating relative to the central body 2 upon their reciprocal screwing, the nozzle 4 may have one or more outwardly projecting radial appendices 26, to be slideably inserted in corresponding apertures 27 of the central body 2. The apertures 27 of the central body 2 also expend over the threaded portion 25 thereof. Thus, in order to hold the threaded portion 25.in the proper position and support it radially, the sleeve 3 has an appropriately sized annular portion 28 at the inner longitudinal end of the thread 24.<br>
Advantageously, each radial appendix 26 has at least one externally visible, substantially flat end portion 29, wherein a mark or sign may be placed to recognize the type and/or size of the nozzle 4 even when the device 1 is fully assembled.<br>
The central body 2 may further include an annular inwardly radially extending bracket 30, which has the purpose of aligning the nozzle 4 with the deflector member 5.<br>
The above description clearly shows that the diffuser device according to the invention fulfils the predetermined objects and particularly the first and second<br><br>
snap connection means, in combination with the action of the support member guide means, provide fast and convenient nozzle and deflector replacement operations. Also, the provision of three different specially shaped faces in a single deflector member, and the possibility of replacing the deflector member with any other of different type add versatility to the diffuser device and allow adaptation thereof to a number of different applications.<br>
The device of this invention is susceptible of a number of modifications and changes all falling within the inventive concept expressed in the appended claims. All the details thereof may be replaced by other technically equivalent parts, and the materials may vary depending on different needs, without departure from the scope of the invention.<br>
While the device has been described with particular reference to the accompanying figures, the numerals referred to in the disclosure and claims are only used for the sake of a better intelligibility of the invention and shall not be intended to limit the claimed scope.<br>
This application is based on and claims priority of Italian patent application VI2002A000265, which was filed in Italy on December 2nd, 2002, whose contents are expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br><br><br>
