				<td>Packaging Box for Tablets<br>
The invention concerns a packaging box in accordance with claim 1.<br><br><br>
A box of this kind is known from WO 96/33927.<br><br><br>
The invention concerns a packaging box which is constructed in principle in the same way as the known packaging box. The hinged closing cap has a dispensing chamber, via which one or more tablets can be dispensed through an opening on the side. The opening is formed by the absence of a side wall of the dispensing chamber. The closing cap with dispensing chamber can adopt at least two positions during use: a closed position and a dispensing position. A tongue-like protrusion opposite the hinge limits the dispensing chamber when in the dispensing position and serves to guide the closing cap when it is swung open or closed. In the case of the known packaging box, a locking mechanism is incorporated, consisting of a longitudinal rib, which runs along the inside wall of the container, one of the larger side walls, practically over the entire length. This longitudinal rib works in conjunction with corresponding depressions in the closing cap, thus defining the two desired positions and generating an audible and tangible click. The longitudinal rib divides the interior of the container into two chambers so that only small or thin tablets can move from one chamber to the other.<br>
The invention addresses the task of creating a packaging box of the type mentioned above, which is simply constructed, the closing cap of which reliably adopts the desired positions and where practically the entire interior is available for the storage of tablets.<br>
The characteristics described in claim number 1 solve this problem.<br>
Since the depressions which, together with the protrusion form the locking mechanism, are formed on the interior wall of the container, there are no projections, or other outcrops of material present which could hinder the free movement of the tablets. The entire interior is smooth so that the tablets can move freely.<br>
The depressions are formed in the side wall, which can be thicker or thinner. If desired, the depressions can be given additional depth if the packaging box is constructed in accordance with claim 2. The depressions are thus located in a slightly thicker area, which can be formed to great advantage as defined in claim 3. The wave-like form of the surface aids the movement of the protrusion into and out of the depressions.<br>
If desired, the packaging box can be constructed as described in claim 4. The third position ensures a small dispensing opening, for the dispensing of similarly small tablets.<br><br>
protrusion is positioned immediately next to the floor of the dispensing chamber, then the wall moves slightly outwards, when the protrusion is engaged with the depressions. So-called "ballooning" takes place. This can be undesirable, especially when several boxes are to be filled while lying next to one another, as the expansion due to the ballooning of multiple boxes is accumulative. If the packaging box is constructed in accordance with claim 5, then a movement of the side wall with the depressions does not take place, as the protrusion is spring mounted due to a suspension slot and can move inwards. The side wall of the dispensing chamber thus moves inwards when the protrusion moves in and out of the corresponding depression.<br>
Finally, it is possible to construct the packaging box as described in claim 6. This is a packaging box with two dispensing chambers, which can be considered to be versions for left-handed and right-handed persons. A dispensing chamber, which can be flipped open, is always available, no matter whether the user is right-handed or left-handed. It is also possible to divide the container, in order to take different types of tablets. In this case, each type of tablet has its own closing cap. In this version, the two parts, i.e. the upper part with the closing caps and the container, are manufactured separately by injection moulding and later pressed together.<br>
The invention is described below in more detail, with reference to drawings and various examples of types of box.<br>
The drawings show:<br>
Fig. 1  A side view of a version of the packaging box according to the invention, in a fully open state, i.e. in so-called filling position. One side wall has been omitted, for clarity.<br>
Fig. 2 A side view as in fig. 1, but with the closing cap in an intermediate position, for the dispensing of small tablets.<br>
Fig. 3 A side view as in fig. 1 and fig. 2, but with the closing cap in the dispensing position for large tablets.<br>
Fig. 4 A side view as in figs. 1 to 3, but with the closing cap in the closed position. Fig. 5 An enlarged section through the view given in fig. 4, at the closing cap.<br>
Fig. 6 A side view as given in fig. 3, of a slightly modified type with a spring mounted protrusion.<br>
Fig. 7 A side view, separated, of a two piece type, with two closing caps. Fig. 8  A section through the type illustrated in fig. 7, assembled.<br>
The packaging box illustrated in the drawing is manufactured of plastic by injection moulding, in a single piece. The type illustrated in figs. 1 to 5 consists of a container 1<br><br>
to take the tablets. The large side walls are marked 5, and in figs. 1 to 4 the "front" been omitted for clarity.<br>
The container 1 and the closing cap 2 are connected by a hinge 4, which takes the from of a film hinge, and about which the closing cap turns. The axis of the hinge runs at right angles to the two large side walls of the container 5. The closing cap 2 incorporates a dispensing chamber 3, into which the tablets move from the container chamber. One side wall of the dispensing chamber is omitted, so that when in an appropriate dispensing position, the tablet can be dispensed or taken from the side. Two tablets of different sizes are illustrated. Under normal circumstances, one type of box is intended for one size of tablet. A variable insert, marked 12, allows tablets of various sizes to be accommodated. On the existing side wall of the closing cap, i.e. that which is opposite the dispensing opening, is a protrusion 6, projecting outwards above the level of the side wall. In the box type illustrated here, this protrusion 6 corresponds to three depressions 7, 7', 7", which are on the inner wall of the container. The distance of the depressions to the axis of the hinge is the same as the radius of the locus of the protrusion 6 about the hinge, so that this can engage in any of the depressions, as required. Further, the closing cap can be placed into the filling position, as illustrated in fig. 1, where the protrusion 6 does not engage in the depressions 7, 7', 7". The depressions 7 are located in a thicker area 11 as can be seen in fig. 5. This thickened area offers enough material or depth for the depressions. On the surface of this thickened area 11, over which the protrusion 6 slides, is a wave-like contour which eases and assists the protrusion in engaging and disengaging with the desired  depression.<br>
Next to the hinge 4, there is a guide 9 on the closing cap, which runs obliquely forwards, in the direction of movement of the cap, which aids the closing movement of the cap in the direction the container 1 and ensures that the closing cap is swung into the opening of the container, as desired. A tongue 10, on the narrow wall opposite hinge 4 also provides a guide, and at the same time limits the dispensing chamber 3 in that area.<br>
Upon consideration of the figs. 1 to 4 it becomes clear that various positions can be adopted. Fig. 1 shows the filling position i.e. the closing cap 2 is swung completely to the side. Once the container has been filled with tablets, the closing cap 2 is moved into the closed position, where guide 9 and tongue 10 ensure that the desired movement into the container opening takes place.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the closed position. The protrusion 6 is engaged with depression 7. With a movement of the hand, similar to that used when operating a cigarette lighter, the closing cap is swung into one of the two positions illustrated in figs. 2 and 3, with the aid of a grooved actuating area 8. Fig. 3 shows the position giving the largest possible dispenser opening. The dispenser opening is large enough so that several tablets or large tablets can be taken out. The protrusion 6 is engaged with depression 7".<br>
The position illustrated in fig. 2 is an intermediate position, in which the protrusion 6 is engaged with depression 7 The dispensing opening is smaller, so that only small tablets can be taken out.<br><br>
During the swinging movement, the protrusion 6 slides over the wave-like contour of the surface of the thickened area 11.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a slightly modified type of box. In the case of the box type shown in figs. 1 to 5, the protrusion 6 is located on the side wall of the dispensing chamber at the same level as the floor. This causes a slight outwards movement of the side wall 5 of the container 1 when the protrusion 6 moves in and out of the depressions 7, 7', 7". If this ballooning is undesirable, then a suspension slot 13 can be cut directly next to the protrusion 6, in the side of the dispensing chamber, as in the box type in fig. 6. The protrusion can thus move inwards in a spring-like fashion, and is no longer directly connected to the floor when engaging or disengaging with the depressions 7, 7', 7". In this case, the side wall 5 of the container 1 is not pushed out when this movement is carried out i.e. there is no ballooning.<br>
The box type illustrated in figs. 7 and 8 differs from those shown in figs. 1 to 6 in that two closing caps 23 and 24 are fitted. These closing caps 23 and 24 are mounted on their own component part 7, which is manufactured by injection moulding. They are formed and fitted as mirror images of one another, as can be clearly seen in figs. 7 and 8.<br>
The container is located in another component 21.<br>
Component 22 has locking protrusions 25 on it which, together with the locking depressions 26 connect the components 22 and 21. As mentioned previously, the two components are manufactured separately of plastic, by an injection moulding process, and then pressed together, so that the locking protrusions 25 engage with the locking depressions 26. During assembly, the film hinge 27 allows the correct position to be determined. An asymmetric flag 28 also serves this end during production.<br>
The box type illustrated in figs. 7 and 8, as in the box type illustrated in fig. 5 has a suspension slot 13 which ensures that the protrusion 6 is free to move inwards in a spring-like fashion with the side wall of the dispensing chamber 3, when engaging or disengaging with the depressions 7, 7'.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
