				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a moist wipe for cleaning a wooden surface and a method of manufacturing the same. The present invention generally relates to a sheet material - a wipe - for cleaning a surface, leaving a water resistant layer. In particular it relates to a wipe which is impregnated with a cleaning composition which reduces or prevents the formation of water stains.<br>
It is known that if aqueous liquid compositions (hereinafter collectively called "water" for convenience), collect on wooden surfaces, especially certain lacquered or varnished wooden surfaces, it may cause water staining. The water staining may be in the form of white rings. Consequently, any water on such surfaces is generally removed as soon as possible. However, if the water has contacted the surface for too long, water staining may occur. Once it has occurred it is known to try to mask, reduce or remove it, using specialist procedures or chemical agents. Drastic measures may sometimes be undertaken, for example, removing the stained region and exposing fresh unstained material beneath, then restoring any surface coating. If chemical agents are used to mask or remove the staining, the chemical agents may be toxic and environmentally unsafe, and frequently the masking or stain removal is not complete.<br>
Commercially available cleaning compositions are not perceived to prevent water staining and there are indications that some may even promote water staining.<br>
It is preferable to prevent staining of a surface caused by contact with water, than to seek to cure the problem when it arises. It is desirable to do this in a way which does not mask the appearance of the surface (frequently an item of furniture, for example a table, desk, chest or shelf).<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a moist wipe for cleaning a wooden surface, the wipe comprising a sheet material pre-moistened with a liquid composition, being an aqueous emulsion comprising from 0.01 to 5% of a paraffin wax, no silicone compounds or silicone compounds in an amount of less than 0.5% and water in an amount of 50%) to 98%) in each case by weight of the total weight of the liquid composition.<br>
By "wax" we mean a water-repellent low-melting organic material useful in laying down a stable inert coating on a surface. Suitable waxes include hydrocarbons and esters of fatty acids and alcohols.<br>
By "pre-moistened" we mean that the wipe is moistened not immediately prior to its use in cleaning a surface. Generally the wipe is "pre-moistened" as part of its manufacture. Moistening a cleaning cloth during cleaning is not a "pre-moistened wipe" in accordance with this invention.<br>
Percentage values quoted above denote the total complement of such components which are present; there may be more than one.<br>
In use, the target surface is contacted with the moist wipe, which is drawn across the<br>
surface. It thereby cleans the surface and lays down wax onto the surface. The wax<br>
inhibits the formation of water stains on the	<br><br>
surface if water is subsequently contacted with the surface.<br>
Suitably the wax is present as an emulsion in the liquid composition. Good results have been obtained in a non-ionic  aqueous  emulsion.<br>
Particularly preferred as a wax in the invention is paraffin  wax.<br>
Paraffin waxes generally have a macrocrystallline structure and consist largely of n-alkenes of formula C20H42  and  upwards,   with  some  iso-  and  cycloalkanes.<br>
Suitably the wax is present in the composition in an amount of between 0.01% to 5%. Preferably the wax is present in an amount of at least 0.05%, and most preferably at least 1%, by weight of the total weight of the  liquid  composition.<br>
Preferably the wax is present in an amount up to 3%, and most preferably up to 1%, by weight of the total weight of the  liquid  composition.<br>
Suitably the liquid composition is an aqueous composition that includes water in an amount of at least 50%, preferably at least 70%, and more preferably at least 80%, by  weight  of  the  total  weight  of  the  liquid  composition.<br>
Suitably the liquid composition is an aqueous composition that includes water in an amount of up to 98%, most preferably up to 95%, by weight of the total weight of the liquid  composition.<br><br>
Preferably the liquid composition includes, as a carrier and/or a cleaner, an aliphatic Ci to C4 alcohol, more preferably  ethanol.<br>
Preferably the alcohol is present in an amount of at least 0.5%, more preferably at least 2%, most preferably at least 5% by weight of the total weight of the liquid composition.<br>
Preferably the alcohol is present in an amount of up to 20%, more preferably up to 15%, most preferably up to 10% by  weight   of  the  total  weight  of  the  liquid  composition.<br>
The liquid composition may also include other optional<br>
ingredients which are well known to those skilled in the<br>
art,	such	as	preservatives,	for	example<br>
chlormethylisothiazoline, 1,2 - benzisothiazolinone, buffering  agents  and  fragrances.<br>
The liquid composition may comprise a silicone compound in a small amount. Most preferably the liquid composition does  not   comprise  a  silicone  compound.<br>
Suitably the liquid composition contains an anti-static compound,   preferably  an  anti-static  amphoteric  compound.<br>
The liquid composition may contain an anti-static agent and an amphoteric surfactant, as distinct components. Alternatively or additionally it may contain an amphoteric surfactant  which  has   anti-static  properties.<br><br>
Suitable amphoteric surfactants which can be used in the<br>
cleaning	composition	include	amphoteric	betaine<br>
surfactants  having  anti-static  properties.<br>
A preferred, the amphoteric surfactant is an alkyl amino betaine  or. an  alkyl  amido  betaine.<br>
Suitable amphoteric surfactants also include cocoamides<br>
having	anti-static	properties,	most	preferably<br>
polyoxyethylene-3-cocoamide.<br>
Suitable amphoteric surfactants also include imidazoline surfactants having anti-static properties, for example sodium  capryloamphopropionate   (CAS  No.   68877-55-4).<br>
Suitable amphoteric surfactants include lactamide surfactants having anti-static properties, for example Lactamide  MEA   (CAS  No.   5422-34-4).<br>
Particularly good anti-static results have been found with compositions containing a betaine in combination with a cocoamide.<br>
Preferably, an anti-static compound may be present in an amount of at least 0.05%, and most preferably at least 0.1%, by weight of the total weight of the cleaning composition.<br>
Preferably, an anti-static compound . may be present in an amount of up to 10%, more preferably up to 5%, and most preferably up to 2%, by weight of the total weight of the cleaning  composition.<br><br>
without being bound by any theory, it is believed that the water-resistance of a wooden surface may be compromised by silicone compounds, and/or by compounds used in their emulsification.<br>
The sheet material may be any sheet material capable of carrying and delivering the liquid composition, and may be porous,   absorbent  and/or  fibrous   in  structure.<br>
Preferably  the   sheet  material   is   a  fibrous  sheet  material.<br>
The sheet material could in principle be woven, but is preferably non-woven. For example, the sheet material may include non-woven sheet materials such as melt blown, coform, air-laid, bonded-carded web materials, hydro-entangled  materials  and  combinations  thereof.<br>
Preferably, the sheet material is a non-woven fibrous sheet material comprising synthetic and/or natural fibres. Most preferably, the non-woven fibrous sheet material comprises  viscose  and/or  rayon  fibres.<br>
Typically, the sheet material (dry) has a weight of at least 20 grams per square metre (gm"â) , preferably at least  30gm"â,   and  most  preferably  at   least  40gm"â.<br>
Typically the sheet material (dry) has a weight of up to 80gm"â, more preferably up to 70gm"â, and most preferably up  to   60gm"â.<br>
A particularly preferred sheet material has a weight of approximately  50gm"â.<br><br>
Preferably, the wipe has a size in the range 10 to 40cm by 10 to 40cm, more preferably in the range 15 to 35cm x 15 to  35cm.<br>
Preferably   the   loading   of   the   liquid   composition   on   the wipe  is   at   least   30gm~â,   and  most  preferably  at  least 50gm"â.<br>
Preferably the loading of the liquid composition on the wipe  is   up  to  150gm"â,   and  most  preferably  up  to  lOOgm"â.<br>
Preferably, each individual wipe is loaded with at least 3.5g  of  the  composition.<br>
Preferably, each individual wipe is loaded with up to 5.5g of  the  composition.<br>
Most preferably each wipe is loaded with approximately 5g of the composition. Advantageously, it has been found that this level of loading provides a wipe of size and grammage outlined above with sufficient moisture so that it does not dry out but which is not too wet to cause smearing in use.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment each individual wipe has a size of approximately 20 x 30cm using a sheet material having a weight (dry) of 50gm"â, and is loaded with  about   5g  of  the  composition.<br>
According to a second aspect, the present invention provides a packaged product comprising a substantially airtight container having a resealable opening and containing  a  wipe  of  the  first  aspect.<br><br>
The container could be a tub or a soft-pack in the form of a pouch (hereinafter a "wrap"). Preferably, the container includes a plurality of wipes which are arranged in a generally folded configuration in a stack so that each wipe can be removed from the container one at a time. Such folded configurations well known to those skilled in the art and include C-folded, Z-folded, quarter-folded configurations and the like. Each wipe may be interfolded with the wipe immediately above and below in the stack of wipes so that the action of withdrawing one wipe raises a part of the wipe underneath it, to assist its removal. Alternatively the wipes may rest on each other in a stack without being interleaved.<br>
Alternatively, wipes could be wound as a roll and separated by perforated tear zones and the container could be a tub having an opening through which wipes are pulled.<br>
According to a further aspect, the present invention provides the use of the wipe as defined hereinbefore for cleaning a surface, for example of furniture. Preferably, the wipe is used to clean surfaces of glass, wood, plastics and the like. The benefit of the invention in resisting water stains is of primary value in relation to wooden surfaces, by which term we include certain lacquered or varnished wooden surfaces.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a method of manufacturing a moist wipe as defined hereinbefore, the method comprising the steps of providing a sheet material and moistening the sheet material with a liquid composition.<br><br>
sheet material is unwound to provide a continuously moving web of material. The web of material is saturated or otherwise impregnated with the liquid cleaning composition by any suitable means such as spraying, dipping, or the like as are well known to those skilled in the art. In a particular aspect, the web of material is passed over several perforated tubes which feed the solution into the material.<br>
In another embodiment a roll or stack of wipes is put in the container dry, and the liquid cleaning composition is injected  into  the  container,   to  impregnate  the  wipes.<br>
In one embodiment the web of material is slit in the machine direction into multiple ribbons, each of which may be folded into the type of fold desired for the individual wipe. The web of material is slit using a cutter, as is well   known  to  those  skilled  in  the  art.<br>
In a related method a wide roll of material is cut into a<br>
number of shorter rolls. A plurality of such shorter<br>
rolls    are    unwound    at    the    same    time.	If    wished    the<br>
longitudinal edges of the unrolling webs (the edges parallel to the direction of unrolling) are folded over against the central region of the webs. The unrolling webs are brought together in face-to-face manner and then cut at intervals, to form stacks ready to be packaged. In principle impregnation could be at any stage but in a preferred embodiment it is the individual unrolling webs which  are  impregnated,   for  example  by  spraying  or  dipping.<br>
A resulting stack of wipes may be placed in a container, such   as   a   plastics   wrap  or  a   tub,   to   provide   a  package   of<br><br>
wipes. The cdntainer provides a substantially hermetically sealed environment for the wipes to minimise the escape of the   liquid  composition,   by  evaporation  or  otherwise.<br>
The invention will now be described further with reference to  the  following  non-limiting  examples.<br>
The  following  materials  were  used  in  the  examples:<br>
IMS     99     -     ethanol,      96%     pure,      from     IMS      (Industrial<br>
Methylated  Spirits)<br>
Proxel     GXL     -     a     liquid     preservative     comprising     1,2-<br>
benzisothiazolinone  and  sodium  hydroxide,   from  Avecia,   UK<br>
Ultralube    E   342/45    -    a   water   based   anionic   emulsion   of<br>
paraffin  wax,   from  Keim  Additec,   Germany<br>
Rhodorsil    EIP    -    a    poly (diinethylsiloxane)     which    is    pre-<br>
formulated   which  an   anionic   surfactant   to   form   a   slightly<br>
anionic   oil-in-water   aqueous   emulsion   having   35wt%   of   the<br>
siloxane,     and    which     is    available     from    Rhodia    Chemie,<br>
France.<br>
The wipes were of highly tangled non-woven blend of natural and man-made fibres and are sold as DEXTER 12106, by Alstrom-Dexter. The wipes were of grammage 50gm"â, and individual wipes were rectangles of size approximately 20cm X 30cm. The wipes were pre-moistened with the liquid cleaning compositions defined below. The loading of the compositions was 5g per wipe. This was sufficient to fully  impregnate  the  wipes.<br>
Wipes  A  were  pre-moistened  with  Formula  A  below.<br><br>

Wipes C were PLEDGE (RTM) cleaning wipes from SC Johnson. These are believed to be impregnated with water, solvent and  approximately  7%  wt/wt  of  silicone  compound(s).<br>
The effect of using Wipes A, B and C were also compared with  the  effect  of  not  wiping  the  surface  to  be  tested.<br>
The  following  procedure  was  used:<br><br>
A sanded wooden surface painted black to aid visual<br>
assessment and with a shellac coating was prepared by<br>
cleaning and drying until no moisture was present on the<br>
surface. A shellac coating was used as such surfaces are<br>
known to give white water stain marks when contacted with<br>
water for a prolonged period, and left untreated. The<br>
surface was marked such that it was divided into equal<br>
rectangular     sections,     using    masking     tape.	Different<br>
sections were tested either with Wipes A, B and C or without using a wipe. For sections tested by wiping with Wipes A, B and C the following protocol was used. Each section of the surface was wiped with a wipe by moving the wipe up and down the rectangular section five times, then moving the wipe left and right across the rectangular section five times, ensuring complete coverage of the section. The sections that had been wiped were then left for 1 hour, before one millilitre of deionised water at 5Â°C was pipetted onto all of the rectangular sections, so as to form a small pool of water in the centre of each section. 100 ml glass beakers were then filled with 75 ml of tap water and one ice cube, and a beaker placed over each of the pools of water on each section of the surface, ensuring that all the water was enclosed underneath the beaker.<br>
The pools of water covered by the beakers were left for 7 hours, before the beakers were removed from the surface. The remaining water on each of the sections was removed as follows: a clean dry dusting cloth was wrapped around a rubbing block and, using firm strokes, wiped on each section eight times in a downward direction, then a second clean  duster  was  wrapped  around  a   rubbing  block  and  wiped<br><br>
across each Section eight times horizontally across each section. The surface was then left overnight (for a minimum  of  16  hours)   for  any  water  stains  to   fully  form.<br>
The intensity of any water stains formed was evaluated by using  the  following  method:<br>
A panel of people using a blind scoring system was<br>
assembled.	In    the    scoring    system,     0     represented    no<br>
staining and 4 represented severe staining of each<br>
rectangular     section     of     the     surface.	Standard     water<br>
staining marks were available for reference to the panel. The number of panellists was sixteen panellists per rectangular section tested, and each surface tested had two rectangular sections wiped by a Wipe A, two rectangular sections wiped by a Wipe B, and two rectangular sections wiped by a Wipe C, and two control rectangular sections which were not treated before the addition the water. Furthermore, two surfaces were tested in  the  above  manner,   to  repeat  the  experiment.<br>
In each evaluation of ea"ch rectangular section, it was ensured that each member of the panel was standing in exactly the same position, so the board was always viewed under  the  same  lighting  conditions.<br>
The  average  of  the  experiments  are  shown  in  Table  1  below.<br><br>
Test  Method	Average  Score  -  0  to  4   (0  =  no marking,   4  -  severe  watermarking)<br>
Wipe  A	0.66<br>
Wipe  B	1.24<br>
Wipe  C	3.34<br>
Untreated  surface	1.15<br><br>
The results show that pre-treatment of a surface by wiping with pre-moistened Wipes A showed an excellent preventive effect in relation to water staining. The surface treated with Wipes B, in which the composition contained a small loading of a silicone compound instead of a wax emulsion, showed a markedly lower effect than Wipes A in preventing white water stains, and slightly increased water staining compared with an untreated surface. Wipe C, believed to have a much higher silicone loading, showed considerably increased  water  staining,   in  these  tests.<br><br><br>
