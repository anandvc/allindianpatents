n       is O or 1; and<br>
and pharmaceutical^ acceptable acid addition salts thereof<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the compounds of general formula I are adenosine receptor ligands. Specifically, the compounds of the present invention have a good affinity to the A2A-receptor and a high selectivity to the Ai- and A3 receptors.<br>
Adenosine modulates a wide range of physiological functions by interacting with<br>
specific cell surface receptors. The potential of adenosine receptors as drug targets was<br>
first reviewed in 1982. Adenosine is related both structurally and metabolically to the<br>
bioactive nucleotides adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP),<br>
adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP); to the	)<br>
biochemical methylating agent S-adenosyl-L-methione (SAM); and structurally to the coenzymes NAD, FAD and coenzym A; and to RNA. Together adenosine and these related compounds are important in the regulation of many aspects of cellular metabolism and in the modulation of different central nervous system activities.<br>
The receptores for adenosine have been classified as Ai, A^ A2B and A3 receptors, belonging to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. Activation of adenosine receptors by adenosine initiates signal transduction mechanism. These mechanisms are dependent on the receptor associated G protein. Each of the adenosine receptor subtyps has been classically characterised by the adenylate cyclase effector system, which utilises cAMP as a second messenger. The Ai and A3 receptors, coupled with Gi proteins inhibit adenylate cyclase, leading to a decrease in cellular cAMP levels, while A2A and A2B receptors couple to Gs proteins and activate adenylate cyclase, leading to an increase in cellular cAMP levels. It is known that the Ai receptor system include the activation of phospholipase C and modulation of both potassium and calcium ion channels. The A3 subtype, in addition to its association with adenylate cyclase, also stimulates phospholipase C and so activates calcium ion channels.<br>
The Ai receptor (326-328 amino acids) was cloned from various species (canine, human, rat, dog, chick, bovine, guinea-pig) with 90-95 % sequence identify among the mammalian species. The A2A receptor (409-412 amino acids) was cloned from canine, rat, human, guinea pig and mouse. The A2B receptor (332 amino acids) was cloned from human and mouse with 45 % homology of human A2B with human Ai and A2A receptors. The A3 receptor (317-320 amino acids) was cloned from human, rat, dog, rabbit and sheep.<br><br>
The Ai and AIAreceptor subtypes are proposed to play complementary roles in adenosine's regulation of the energy supply. Adenosine, which, is a metabolic product of ATP, diffuses from the cell and acts locally to activate adenosine receptors to decrease the oxygen demand (Ai) or increase the oxygen supply (A2A) and so reinstate the balance of energy supply: demand within the tissue. The actions of both subtyps is to increase the amount of available oxygen to tissue and to protect cells against damage caused by a short term imbalance of oxygen. One of the important functions of endogenous adenosine is preventing damage during traumas such as hypoxia, ischaemia, hypotension and seizure activity.<br>
Furthermore, it is known that the binding of the adenosine receptor agonist to ■ mast cells expressing the rat A3 receptor resulted in increased inositol triphosphate and intracellular calcium concentrations, which potentiated antigen induced secretion of inflammatory mediators. Therefore, the A3 receptor plays a role in mediating asthmatic attacks and other allergic responses.<br>
Adenosine is a neuromodulator, able to modulate many aspects of physiological brain function. Endogenous adenosine, a central link between energy metabolism and neuronal activity, varies according to behavioural state and (patho)physiological conditions. Under conditions of increased demand and decreased availability of energy (such as hypoxia;, hypoglycemia, and/or excessive neuronal activity);, adenosine provides a powerful protective fedback mechanism. Interacting with adenosine receptors represents a promising target for therapeutic intervention in a number of neurological and psychiatric diseases such as epilepsy, sleep, movement disorders (Parkinson or Huntington's disease), Alzheimer's disease, depression, schizophrenia, or addiction An increase in neurotransmitter release follows traumas such as hypoxia, ischaemia and seizures. These neurotransmitters are ultimately responsible for neural degeneration and neural death, which causes brain damage or death of the individual. The adenosine Ai   . agonists which mimic the central inhibitory effects of adenosine may therefore be useful as neuroprotective agents. Adenosine has been proposed as an endogenous anticonvulsant agent, inhibiting glutamate release from excitory neurons and inhibiting neuronal firing. Adenosine agonists therefore may be used as antiepileptic agents. Adenosine antagonists stimulate the activity of the CNS and have proven to be effective as cognition enhancers. Selective A2a antagonists have therapeutic potential in the treatment of various forms of dementia, for example in Alzheimer's disease, and of neurodegenerative disorders, e.g. stroke. Adenosine A2a receptor antagonists modulate the activity of striatal GABAergic neurons and regulate smooth and well-coordinated movements, thus offering a potential therapy for Parkinsonian symptoms. Adenosine is also implicated in a number of physiological processes involved in sedation, hypnosis,<br><br>
schizophrenia, anxiety, pain, respiration, depression, and drug addiction (amphetamine, cocaine, opioids, ethanol, nicotine, cannabinoids). Drugs acting at adenosine receptors therefore have therapeutic potential as sedatives, muscle relaxants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, analgesics, respiratory stimulants, antidepressants, and to treat drug abuse. They may also be used in the treatment of ADHD (attention deficit hyper-activity disorder).<br>
An important role for adenosine in the cardiovascular system is as a cardioprotective agent. Levels of endogenous adenosine increase in response to ischaemia and hypoxia, and protect cardiac tissue during and after trauma (preconditioning). By acting at the Ai receptor, adenosine Ai agonists may protect against the injury caused by myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. The modulating influence of A2a receptors on adrenergic function may have implications for a variety of disorders such as coronary artery disease and heart failure. A2a antagonists may be of therapeutic benefit in situations in which an enhanced antiadrenergic response is desirable, such as during acute myocardial ischemia. Selective antagonists at A2a receptors may also enhance the effectiveness of adenosine in terminating supraventricula arrhytmias.<br>
Adenosine modulates many aspects of renal function, including renin release, glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow. Compounds which antagonise the renal affects of adenosine have potential as renal protective agents. Furthermore, adenosine A3 and/or A2B antagonists may be useful in the treatment of asthma and other allergic responses or and in the treament of diabetes mellitus and obesity.<br>

Human adenosine A^ receptor<br>
The human adenosine A2A. receptor was recombinant^ expressed ki Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using the semliki forest virus expression system. Cells were harvested, washed twice by centrifugation, homogenised and again washed by centrifugation. The final washed membrane pellet was suspended in a Tris (50 mM) buffer containing 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2 and 10 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.4) (buffer A). The [3H]-SCH-58261 (Dionisotti et al., 1997, Br J Pharmacol 121, 353; 1 nM) binding assay was carried out in 96-well plates in the presence of 2.5 jig of membrane protein, 0.5 mg of Ysi-poly-Hysine SPA beads and 0.1 U adenosine deaminase in a final volume of 200 |ol of buffer A. Non-specific binding was defined using xanthine amine congener (XAQ 2 fxM). Compounds were tested at 10 concentrations from 10 \xM - 0.3 nM. AH assays were conducted in duplicate and repeated at least two times. Assay plates were incubated for Ihour at room temperature before centrifugation and then bound ligand determined using a Packard Topcount scintillation counter. IC5o values were calculated using a non-linear curve fitting program and Ki values calculated using the Cheng-Prussoff equation.<br>
The pKi value of compounds of the present application are in the range of 7.5 to 9.0. The preferred compounds show a pKi &gt; 8.5.<br><br><br><br>
The compounds of formula I and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally,-e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees&gt; hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The administration can, however, also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula I can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acids or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like. Depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oil and the like. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations can, moreover, contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br><br>
Medicaments containing a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a therapeutically inert carrier are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for their production, which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I and/or pharmaceutically cceptable acid addition salts and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical administration form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br>
In accordance with the invention compounds of formula I as well as their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are useful in the control or prevention of illnesses based on the adenosine receptor antagonistic activity, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, neuroprotection, schizophrenia, anxiety, pain, respiration deficits, depression, asthma, allergic responses, hypoxia, ischaemia, seizure and substance abuse. Furthermore, compounds of the present invention maybe useful as sedatives, muscle relaxants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, anticonvulsants and cardiaprotective agents and for the production of corresponding medicaments.<br>
The most preferred indications in accordance with the present invention are those, which include disorders of the central nervous system, for example the treatment or prevention of certain depressive disorders, neuroprotection and Parkinson's disease.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, have to be adjusted to<br>
the individual requirements in each particular case. In the case of oral administration the<br>
dosage for adults can vary from about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg per day of a compound<br>
of general formula I or of the corresponding amount of a pharmaceuticallacceptable<br>
salt thereof. The daily dosage maybe administered as single dose or in divided doses and,	}<br>
in addition, the upper limit can also be exceeded when this is found to be indicated.<br><br><br><br><br>
