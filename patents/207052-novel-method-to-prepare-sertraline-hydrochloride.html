This invention particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
ZRC-NIPR-001<br>
Field of invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for preparing a naphthaienamine derivative represented by formula (I), (+) (l S-cis)-N-methy]-4-(3,4-dichloroplenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthaienamine hereinafter referred to as "Sertraline" and its add addition salts.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Sertraline   hydrochloride,   (+)   (l S-cis)-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-methyl-1-naphthaienamine hydrochloride, has the following structural chemical formula:<br><br>
Sertraline hydrochloride has been approved under the brand name "Zoloft" by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration, for the treatment of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and panic disorder. Sertraline hydrochloride is marketed in other countries under various brand names, with additional uses as an anti-depressant and anorectic agent.<br>
Sertraline hydrochloride is a valuable pharmaceutical substance, and the pharmaceutical compositions containing this compound are useful in the treatment of depression and other dependence / anxiety related disorders (US 4,536,518 and 5,248,699).<br>
There are several processes known for manufacturing Sertraline and its acid addition salts. The key intermediate in most of these processes, is 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyI)-3,4-dihydro-l-(2H)naphthalen-l-one or 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)tetralone (hereinafter referred to as DCPT). The synthesis of DCPT is described in US 4,029,731, 5,019,655, 4,045,488; European Patent application no. 30,081 and in2hur. Org. Khim., 18, 870 (1982).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                                                                                            ZRC-NIPR-001<br>
Various aspects of Sertraline polymorphs are also disclosed in US 4. 536. 517; US 5, 734, 083; JP 2000/026378 and 026379; WO 0032551 and WO 0172684.<br>
Welch et al. (US 4,536,518) initially reported the use and method of preparation of Sertraline hydrochloride and related compounds. In the process DCPT is reacted with methyl amine in THF at 0 °C to 5 °C and is followed by dropwise addition of titanium tetrachloride. After filtration of the reaction mixture, the filtrate obtained was hydrogenated using 10 % Pd/C catalyst at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. The residue was dissolved in anhydrous ether and was treated with gaseous hydrogen chloride to obtain Sertraline HC1 salt, which contains about 70 % cis-racemate and 30 %. trans-racemate. Cis-racemate of the desired compound is selectively crystallized out by dissolving the mixture in hot methanol (40 x based on the starting tetralone) and addition of a 30 times amount of diethyl ether. The primary yield is 48 %, which is increased to 68 % by working up the mother liquor obtaining a second crop of the title compound. The cis isomer is resolved into (IS) and (IR) using D(-)-mandelic acid to get Sertraline mandelate.<br>
                        There are several disadvantages in the above-described process.  The commercial<br>
realization / scale-up involves additional working time, working power and energy due to<br>
large   solvent   circulation  and  the  work-up   of secondary  generation   mother  liquor.<br>
Hydrogenation leads to a mixture of cis-racemate (IE) and trans-racemate (IV) isomers in the<br>
ratio of 50:50 to 70:30, and an additional resolution step is needed. During isolation excess<br>
amount of solvents is needed. The use of TiCl4 in the process demands careful handling due<br>
to its extreme reactivity with water. Further, it is corrosive, can contaminate the product with<br>
titanium, and is associated with potential hazards. Another drawback is that during use of<br>
methyl amine, the reactor temperature has to be kept below 5 °C. Additionally addition of<br>
TiCl4 to reactor is exothermic, resulting in a sensitive reactor conditions e.g. efficient cooling.<br>
US 4,855,500 uses hydratable /reusable molecular sieves, instead of TiCU, thereby<br>
giving pure product imine in a unique one-step method with high yields.<br>
	Recently, Indian patent application no. 748/CAL/99, has disclosed the reaction of 4-<br>
(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-1-(2H)-naphthalone with methyl amine under reducing<br>
  atmosphere in the presence of hydrogen under a pressure of 200-1000 psi and a reducing<br>
 agent such as raney Nickel at a temperature ranging from room temperature to 100 °C. The<br><br>
  yields are average in the range of 41 % to 50 %.<br><br><br>
ZRC-NIPR-001<br>
The reductive step is associated with the generation of a stereocenter and hence methods have been developed to include stereoselective reduction of the compound of the formula (II) using microbial flora (European Patent application no. 0997535) or in the presence of copper-containing catalyst (WO 9947486). US 5,463,126 discloses a method using ionic hydrogenation to selectively form the desired cis-lS stereoisomer. US 6,034,274 discloses stereoselective reduction of N-oxide DCPT, obtained by using compound of formula (II) with methylhydroxyl-amine and followed by hydrogenation in the presence of  Raney-Nickel.<br>
	The above methods of selective reduction are commercially less viable, as these involve<br>
relatively higher processing costs.<br>
               European Patent application no. 0947499) uses N-methylformamide instead of N-<br><br>
           methylamine, for stereoselective reduction.<br>
                Hence, it is desirable to have a process to prepare Sertraline and its acid addition salts,    which is commercially viable, relatively safe, with high yields of desired stereoisomer.<br>
Summary of the invention :<br>
The present invention provides a method to prepare / manufacture Sertraline and its acid addition salts using a process, which is devoid of the above stated disadvantages in the prior art.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a novel process to prepare Sertraline hydrochloride ie. (+)(l S-cis)-4-(3,4-dichorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-methyl-1-phthalenamine hydrochloride, in three steps.<br>
The particular objective of the present invention is to provide a one pot process for substantially geometrically pure racemic cis (±) of formula (III), via stereoselective reductive animation, by condensing methyl amine in the presence of a Lewis acid and subsequent reduction.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for substantially geometrically pure racemic (±) (III) by condensation of 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-l-(2H)-naphthalen-l-one (DCPT) of the formula (II) with a solution of methyl amine in<br><br><br>
ZRC-NIPR-OOl<br>
organic solvents in the presence of titanium(IV)isopropoxide, followed by reduction with sodium borohydride in-situ.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a novel process for substantially geometrically pure racemic (±) of formula (III), by using minimum amount of solid reagents (CH3NH2.HCI) at ambient temperature, thereby, reducing environmental pollution and minimizing costs.       <br>
Optionally, the present invention provides a process to isolate substantially geometrically pure racemic (±) of formula (III), from a mixture of cis (±) and trans (±) isomers.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to reveal process for the resolution of substantially geometrically pure cis (±) isomer (III).<br>
The preferred objective of the present invention is to provide a novel, simple, safe, cost-effective and alternative process to manufacture Sertraline.<br>
Detailed Description of the invention :<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process to prepare compounds of the formula I, in either racemic or optically active (+) or (-) forms, and their salts. More particularly, the present invention provides a process to prepare Sertraline. The key step in the present invention is the stereoselective reductive amination of DCPT II with methylamine or its salt, in the presence of Lewis acid and a reducing agent<br>
The process comprises of the following sequential series of steps:<br>
(1) Stereospecific   reductive   amination  by   reacting   DCPT   with   methylamine<br>
hydrochloride in a suitable solvent and a suitable organic base in the presence of a Lewis acid.   Subsequently, the reaction mixture is reduced with a suitable reducing agent in situ. (2) Seperation of substantially geometrically pure racemic (±) cis stereoisomer III, from a mixture of cis (III) and trans (IV) isomers, as an acid addition salt.<br><br>
ZRC-NIPR-001<br>
(3)	Resolution of substantially geometrically pure racemic (±) cis stereoisomer (III) base with suitable resolving agents and regenerating optically pure (+) (lS-cis) free base.<br>
(4)	Formation of hydrochloride salt from (+) (lS-cis) free base as (+)(lS-cis)-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-methyI-l-phthaIenamine hydrochloride<br>
SCHEME I<br><br>
The reaction may be carried out in the presence of a protic or aprotic solvent(s) or a mixture of solvent(s), selected from methanol, ethanol, propanol, toluene, hexane, cyclohexane, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether and the like The choice of the Lewis acids may be Titanium (IV) alkoxides eg. propoxide, isopropoxide, ethoxide, methoxide in a molar ratio of 1 to 5, with respect to DCPT of formula II. The reaction temperature may range from 5 oC<br><br>
ZRC-NIPR-OO]<br>
to the reflux temperature of the solvent(s) used (Synthetic Communications 2000, 30, 2001<br>
and J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1, ] 998, 2527).<br>
Suitable organic bases such as  1,5-Diazabicyclo [4,3,0] non-5-ene(DBN),  1,8 -<br>
diazabicyclo-[5,4,0] undec-7-ene (DBU), 1,4-Diazabicyclo [2,2,2] octane (DABCO), triethyl<br>
amine and di isopropyl ethyl amine and the like may be used) The molar ratio of organic base<br>
to DCPT may be 1 to 10.<br>
While the use of methylamine hydrochloride salt requires lesser amount of the<br>
solvent, the use of methylamine gas requires large volume of solvents due to its lesser<br>
solubility at ambient temperatures. Indeed, condensation of methylamine in large volume of<br>
solvents cooled at -10 °C or below is an extremely time consuming and an expensive<br>
process.<br>
The in-situ reduction may be effected in the presence of a reducing agent such as<br>
lithium borohydride, sodium borohydride, lithium aluminum hydride, or hydrogenation in the presence of Raney Nickel, 5 - 10 % Pd/C and such other catalysts known. The amount of reducing agent may be in the range from 1 to 20 equivalents(preferably 2-5 equivalents). The reaction may be carried out in the presence of an inert atmosphere such as N2, He or Ax. The reaction time may range from 5 minutes to 72 hours, preferably from 1 to 48 hours.<br>
It is preferred that in the process disclosed in the invention, methanol or ethanol is used as solvent, and sodium borohydride or lithium borohydride is used as a reducing agent.<br>
It is more preferred that methanol is used as a solvent, and sodium borohydride is used as an in-situ reducing agent. Separation of substantially geometrically pure racemic (±) cis and trans isomers is effected via its salts, especially hydrochloride salt and refluxing in solvents eg. methanol, ethanol, propanol, methylene chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane and mjxtures thereof. The characterization of substantially geometrically pure cis (±) III isomer was carried out by 1H NMR, HPLC and melting point of its HCI salt (m.p. 280 °C).<br>
Resolution of the substantially geometrically pure racemic (±) of formula (III) may be carried out with an optically active acid by standard techniques well known to those skilled in the art. Mixture of stereoisomers may be resolved by conventional methods such as microbial resolution, resolving the diastereomeric salts formed with chiral acids or chiral bases. The method used here involves treatment with an alcoholic solution of chiral acid to form<br><br><br>
ZRC-NIPR-OO]<br>
diastereoisomeric salts. The chiral acid may be selected from the group consisting of tartaric<br>
acid, mandelic acid, lactic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, amino acids and the like?)	<br>
The preferred method involves the use of D (-) mandelic acid in an alcoholic solvent(s) (methanol, ethanol or isopropanol) in the presence of some moisture (0.1 to 2 %).<br>
The resulting cis chiral acid addition salt is further converted into free cis-base by standard techniques well-known to those skilled in the art, which is further converted to the acid addition salt. According to the process disclosed in the invention, hydrogen chloride in methanol, ethanol or isopropanol is used as an alcoholic solution of mineral acid to get the final product Sertraline hydrochloride.<br>
The reaction of chiral 4S (+) DCPT with methylamine hydrochloride as disclosed above gives (+) (lS-cis)-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-methyl-l-naphthalenamine hydrochloride, ie Sertrahne.HCl, in one step by employing above disclosed stereoselective reductive amination invention.<br>
Scheme II<br><br>
The process of this invention has the following advantages :<br>
1.	The present process provides one-pot process to prepare cis isomer of Sertraline from DCPT and methylamine, followed by reduction in-situ.<br>
2.	The desired substantially geometrically pure racemic (±) of formula (III) cis-compound is formed with better selectivity (70 -85 %).<br>
3.	The solid nature of methylamine salt is easier to handle and avoids the use of low temperatures and high pressure, required to dissolve methylamine gas in non-<br><br><br>
ZRC-NIPR-OOl<br>
aqueous  media.   This  results   in   better   control   over  the  process   and   hence advancement over the known art.<br>
4.	The yield of the final product is around 40 % to 70 %.<br>
5.	The described process involves condensation of a methylamine hydrochloride salt with DCPT in the presence of, titanium (IV) isopropoxide, which is relatively mild compared to TiCI4 or less pyrophoric compared to 10 % Pd-C and Raney Nickel used in earlier processes.<br>
6.	Titanium (IV) isopropoxide is readily available, less corrosive, and generates less heat during reaction, which effects the overall cooling costs.<br>
7.	Use of smaller amount of methylamine hydrochloride decreases the possibility of environmental pollution.<br>
8.	The solid handling and smaller amount of methylamine hydrochloride use effects the overall volume efficiency of the process, provides improved safety and is also cost effective.<br>
The Sertraline.HCl produced according to the process described in the present invention is useful for the treatment of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder in patients, who are in need thereof. The pharmaceutical composition containing Sertraline.HCl prepared according to the process described in the present invention is useful for treating the patients suffering from mental disorders mentioned above.<br>
The present invention is illustrated by the following examples, which are not intended to limit the effective scope of the invention and the claims.<br>

M. water and 20 ml of ethylacetate and stirred for 30 minutes. The lower aqueous layer was separated and re-extracted with 20 ml ethyl acetate. The organic extracts were then combined, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated to get an oily product (free base of mainly cis(±) isomer). The oil was dissolved in isopropylalcohol, and the pH was adjusted to 1-2 using cone HC1 and subsequent reflux gave mainly (±) Cis-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-methyl-l-naphthalenamine (III,1.25g, 73 % yield) solid in the form of its hydrochloride (m.p. 280 °C).<br>

In this particular case, the final product obtained eg. mainly (±) cis-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-methyl-l-naphthalenamine.HCl (III, m.p. 280 - 282 °C) was found to be identical in every respect with the product of example I.<br>
Example 7<br>
The procedure as described in Example 1 or Example 3 were repeated except that the molar ratio of Titanium (IV) isopropoxide was taken to be 1.5 times with respect to DCPT. It yielded 0.28 g (16 % yield) of the desired product. In this particular case, the final product obtained eg. mainly (±) cis-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetraliydro-N-methyl-l-naphthalenamine.HCl (III, m.p. 281 - 283 °C) was found to be identical in every respect with the product of example I.<br><br>

Example 9<br>
The procedure as described in Example 1 or Example 3 were repeated except that here methylamine hydrochloride is prepared insitu by starting with a suitable amount of methylamine gas and purging with dry HCL gas. Methylamine hydrochloride was freshly prepared by charging 100 ml methylamine and 100 ml methanol solution into a round bottom flask A, and cooling. Meanwhile HCL gas was generated by adding cone H2SO4 solution to HC1 solution, and was purged through the solution present in Flask A to get crystalline precipitates of methylamine hydrochloride.<br>
To a solution of 1.45 g (4.7 m.mole) DCPT in 15 ml methanol solution. Freshly prepared 0.64 g (9.4 ni.mole) methylamine Iwdrochloride was introduced. To the resulting mass 0.96 g (9.4 m.mole) of triethylamine and 2.75 g (9.4 ramole) of titanium (IV) isopropoxide, were added and stirred at 25-30 °C for 8 - 9 hours. After monitoring the disappearance of DCPT, the reaction mixture was subsequently charged with 0.277 g (7.05 m.mole) NaBH4 in small lots, by maintaining the temperature between 10 - 15 °C for half an hour. The reaction mixture was subsequently stirred for 3 hours and filtered through a filtration cloth. The solid residue was washed with 10-15 ml methanol, and the combined filtrate was concentrated into an oily residue, charged with 15 ml of D. M. water and 20 ml of ethylacetate and stirred for 30 minutes ..The lower aqueous layer was separated and re-extracted with 20 ml ethyl acetate. The organic extracts were then combined, dried over anhydrous Na2S04 and concentrated to get an oily product (free base of mainly cis(±) isomer. The oil was dissolved in isopropylalcohol, and the pH was adjusted to 1-2 using cone HC1 to give mainly cis (±) III (1.25g, 73 % 3'ield) solid in the form of its hydrochloride. Refluxing the salt in dichloromethane further purified the cis isomer. In this particular case, the final product obtained eg. mainly (±) cis-4-<br><br>

A solution of 1.45 g (4.7 m.mole) DCPT in 15 ml of methanol was added and stirred for another 6-8 hours. After monitoring the disappearence of DCPT, the reaction mixture was subsequently charged with 0.190 g (5 m.mole) NaBH4 in small lots, by maintaining the temperature between 10 - 15 °C for half an hour. The reaction mixture was subsequently stirred for 3 hours and filtered through a filtration cloth. The solid residue was washed with 10-15 ml methanol, and the combined filtrate was concentrated into an oily residue, charged with 15 ml of D. M. water and 20 ml of ethylacetate and stirred for 30 minutes. The lower aqueous layer was separated and re-extracted with 20 ml ethyl acetate. The organic extracts were then combined, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated to get an oily product (free base of mainly cis(±) isomer). The oil was dissolved in ethanol, and the pH was adjusted to 1-2 using cone HC1 to give mainly cis (±) III (0.75g, 23 % yield) solid in the form of its hydrochloride. In this particular case, the final product obtained eg. mainly (±) cis-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-ls2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-methyl-l-naphthalenamine.HCl was found to be identical in every respect with the product of example I.<br>
