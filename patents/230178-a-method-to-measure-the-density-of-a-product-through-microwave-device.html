				<td>The invention relates to a measuring<br>
arrangement for measuring the density of a product<br>
by means of microwaves, having a first microwave<br>
resonator, from which, in operation, microwaves<br>
enter a product area, and a device for<br>
compensating for the environmental influences<br>
affecting the measuring signal of the first<br>
microwave resonator and for internal and external<br>
disturbance variables.<br>
When measuring density using such a measuring<br>
arrangement, the measuring variables used, in<br>
particular the resonant frequency and the width of<br>
the resonance curve, are dependent on different<br>
environmental influences and disturbance variables<br>
in the first resonator. In order to compensate<br>
for the influences, such as the temperature of the<br>
resonator, on the systematic measuring error, it<br>
is known to provide a temperature sensor at a<br>
specific point of the first resonator and to carry<br>
out a computational correction by means of the<br>
measured temperature. Since the temperature in<br>
the first resonator is determined only at one<br>
point, the accuracy of the compensation in the<br>
first resonator is limited, especially in the case<br>
of a spatially non-homogeneous and/or time-variant<br>
temperature distribution.<br>
Generally speaking, to compensate, for<br>
example, for the effects of temperature, it is<br>
known to use different materials, in the present<br>
case for the first resonator, having temperature<br>
coefficients of opposite signs. Apart from<br><br>
increased manufacturing costs, however, the<br>
transition points between the different materials<br>
in particular can have an adverse effect in<br>
microwave technology. The use of special alloys<br>
and composite materials having thermal expansion<br>
coefficients close to or equal to zero is also<br>
known. These too involve increased manufacturing<br>
costs.<br>
The invention is based on the problem of<br>
reducing the measuring error in a measuring<br>
arrangement of the kind mentioned in the<br>
introduction caused by different environmental<br>
influences and by internal and external<br>
disturbance variables in the first resonator.<br>
For that purpose, the invention provides for<br>
the compensation device to comprises a second<br>
microwave resonator, which is shielded towards the<br>
product area with respect to microwave radiation.<br>
Some of the terms used will first be<br>
explained.<br>
"Resonator" relates to a spatial region in<br>
which a standing microwave field is able to<br>
propagate. The resonator can be a closed or a<br>
substantially closed cavity resonator or an open<br>
resonator.<br>
A product of which the density is oeing<br>
measured is arranged in an area called a "product<br>
area", which, when the sensor is operative, is in<br>
a fixed spatial relationship with the area of the<br>
first resonator. The product area can extend<br>
partially or completely within the first resonator<br>
area; alternatively, it can be spatially separate<br>
from the first resonator area. In the latter<br>
case, the product area can be located adjacent to<br>
the first resonator area; alternatively, it can be<br><br>
arranged spatially remote therefrom, and the field<br>
can be directed via a line from the resonator to<br>
the product area. The microwaves enter the<br>
product area in order to interact with the<br>
product. Normally, the first microwave resonator<br>
is therefore permeable to microwaves towards the<br>
product area. The product can be a consecutive<br>
and/or continuous stream of product, for example,<br>
a fibre sliver, a fibre web, fibre flocks or<br>
individual fibres in spinning preparation machines<br>
or a strand of tobacco in a cigarette-making<br>
machine.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the measured<br>
variables determined with the second resonator are<br>
not - by virtue of the fact that it has microwave<br>
shielding towards the product area - affected by<br>
the interaction of the microwave field with the<br>
dielectric constant. Because the measured<br>
variables of the first resonator are suitably<br>
related to the corresponding measured variables of<br>
the second resonator, the effect of environmental<br>
influences and disturbance variables, which affect<br>
the measuring signal of both resonators, can<br>
therefore be compensated. One of these<br>
environmental influences and disturbance variables<br>
is, for example, the thermal effect of the<br>
environment, such as the heat load emanating from<br>
the product.<br>
The invention has recognised, for example,<br>
that the temperature distribution in the first<br>
resonator can be spatially non-homogeneous and/or<br>
time-variant. As a consequence of this knowledge,<br>
the invention permits the measurement, for<br>
example, of an integrated temperature, that is, a<br>
temperature averaged over a region that<br><br>
corresponds in respect of its arrangement relative<br>
to the product area to the first resonator area<br>
and therefore has substantially the same<br>
temperature distribution as this. This contrasts<br>
with a temperature measurement in a region of<br>
small extent in relation to the extent of the<br>
first resonator.<br>
Especially in the case of time-variant, non-<br>
homogenously occurring environmental influences<br>
and disturbance variables, the conventional<br>
measurement of the temperature of the first<br>
resonator at one point, for example, may lead in<br>
the individual case to a distorted measuring<br>
result with a correspondingly large measuring<br>
error. Let us consider as an example an<br>
arrangement in which a temperature sensor is<br>
arranged on the side of the first resonator remote<br>
from a heat source. An increase in temperature<br>
has an effect on the measuring signal as soon as<br>
the side of the first resonator facing this heat<br>
source heats up; but this cannot be detected and<br>
compensated for until the side of the first<br>
resonator remote from the heat source heats up.<br>
In the intervening period, no satisfactory<br>
temperature compensation takes place.<br>
The invention brings particular advantages<br>
when it is combined with a first resonator filled<br>
with dielectric. The term "dielectric" here means<br>
a dielectric constant of at least 2, preferably at<br>
least 5. Thus, for example, the temperature<br>
dependency of the measured variables of the first<br>
resonator is then determined decisively by the<br>
temperature dependency of the dielectric constant<br>
of the dielectric filling. Because of: the<br>
frequently poor thermal conductivity properties of<br><br>
dielectric materials, a spatially non-homogeneous<br>
temperature distribution or a time-variant heat<br>
load has a particularly strong effect, since it<br>
can take a long time for a stationary temperature<br>
distribution to form. The second resonator is<br>
accordingly preferably likewise filled with a<br>
corresponding dielectric that has a temperature<br>
distribution comparable with that of the<br>
dielectric filling of the first resonator at every<br>
instant of the measurement.<br>
The second resonator preferably has properties<br>
in relation to the response to the environmental<br>
influences and disturbance variables comparable<br>
with those of the first resonator. This applies,<br>
for example, to the dimension and the material or<br>
materials of the resonators (claim 3), for<br>
example, in respect of the thermal conductivity,<br>
the thermal penetration value, heat transfer, heat<br>
transmission, thermal capacity, thermal expansion<br>
and/or other thermally relevant variables. When<br>
the properties of the first resonator to be<br>
compensated are dominated by one material, for<br>
example, a dielectric filling, it is generally<br>
sufficient for the appropriate properties in<br>
relation to this material to correspond.<br>
The first and the second resonator are<br>
preferably arranged adjacent to one another (claim<br>
6) and/or form a modular unit (claim 7); it is<br>
therefore possible to ensure that both resonators<br>
are exposed to the same environmental influences<br>
and disturbance variables. Alternatively,<br>
however, the two resonators can be arranged<br>
spatially separate from one another.<br>
A further great advantage of the invention is<br>
the fact that the second resonator can<br><br>
advantageously also be used for simultaneous<br>
compensation of the influence of further<br>
disturbance variables, for example, drifting of<br>
the electronics in the longer term or material<br>
changes as a consequence of ageing.<br>
The product temperat.ure has a direct influence<br>
on the measuring signal owing to the temperature<br>
dependency of the dielectric constant of the<br>
product. The arrangement can therefore<br>
advantageously contain an additional temperature<br>
sensor, for example, a PT-100 element or a<br>
thermometer measuring without contact, for direct<br>
and rapid measurement of the product temperature,<br>
in order to be able to correct the measuring<br>
signal correspondingly in a manner known per se.<br>
The invention is applicable basically both in<br>
the case of a first resonator operating on the<br>
basis of transmission measurement and in the case<br>
of a first resonator operating on the basis of<br>
reflection measurement.<br>
The invention furthermore includes an<br>
advantageous apparatus for the use according to<br>
the invention and/or for implementing the<br>
measuring method according to the invention,<br>
especially for measuring the density of at least<br>
one sliver of textile fibres, for example, of<br>
cotton, synthetic fibres or the like, in which the<br>
microwave measuring arrangement is used for<br>
control and/or regulation of a processing device<br>
for at least one textile fibre sliver.<br>
The microwave measuring device is<br>
advantageously arranged at the delivery end of a<br>
card. At least one microwave measuring<br>
arrangement is preferably arranged at the feed end<br>
and/or at the delivery end of the drawing system<br><br>
of a draw frame. The drawing system is<br>
advantageously a card drawing system at the<br>
delivery end of a card. The textile fibre sliver<br>
is preferably a card sliver. The textile fibre<br>
sliver is advantageously a draw frame sliver. The<br>
microwave measuring arrangement is preferably<br>
connected to an electronic control and regulating<br>
device, for example, a machine control and<br>
regulating device. The control and regulating<br>
device is advantageously connected to at least one<br>
actuator, for example, drive motor, for changing<br>
the density of the fibre sliver. An indicating<br>
device, for example, display screen, printer or<br>
the like, for displaying the density of or density<br>
changes in the fibre sliver is preferably<br>
connected to the control and regulating device.<br>
The microwave measuring arrangement is<br>
advantageously used to monitor the density of a<br>
sliver produced on a card or draw frame.<br>
A further application case is the measurement<br>
of the head compression (area of relatively high<br>
density of the tobacco in a cigarette) during the<br>
process of manufacturing a cigarette in a<br>
cigarette machine.<br>

The exemplary embodiments shown are, in Figure<br>
1, a spaced measuring arrangement and, in Figure<br><br>
2, a modular measuring arrangement, which consists<br>
of the microwave sensor 1 (measuring resonator)<br>
and the compensating device 2 (reference<br>
resonator).<br>
The product is guided through two openings<br>
through the microwave sensor 1.<br>
Microwaves are generated by means of suitable<br>
devices 10 (microwave generators), and fed into<br>
the resonator 1 via a connection 3. At a specific<br>
frequency, standing waves are induced in the<br>
resonator 1. The distribution of the field<br>
strength in the region of the resonator 1 is<br>
indicated schematically in Figures 1 and 2.<br>
Microwaves enter the product area 12 and can<br>
interact with a product 9 located therein. The<br>
microwaves are output via a connection 4 and<br>
passed to a downstream evaluating device 11<br>
(microwave generator). The reference resonator 2<br>
is arranged directly adjacent to the measuring<br>
resonator 1.<br>
Microwaves that are preferably tapped off from<br>
the infeed 10 by means of the switch 7 are<br>
injected into and fed out of the reference<br>
resonator 2 via connections 5 and 6. The<br>
microwaves are passed to the evaluating unit 11<br>
via the switch 8. The switching frequency of the<br>
switches 7 and 8 can be as high as desired.<br>
Because the reference resonator and the measuring<br>
resonator are of the same construction, the<br>
conditions obtaining in the two resonators 1, 2<br>
are the same at all times, e.g. the temperature<br>
distribution is approximately the same.<br>
For measurement, the frequency of the field in<br>
the resonator 1 is driven through a range that<br>
contains a specific, isolated resonance. The<br><br>
range to be passed through depends inter alia on<br>
the product in question and on the humidity and<br>
temperature values occurring in practice (owing to<br>
the magnitude of the resonance shift consequent<br>
thereon). From the starting signal, the resonant<br>
frequency f1 and the ha]f-value width T1 of the<br>
measured resonance are determined in an evaluating<br>
unit. Such a measuring and evaluating cycle can<br>
take place in a fraction of a second.<br>
At specific times, a corresponding measurement<br>
is effected in the reference resonator 2. The<br>
frequency of the field in the reference resonator<br>
2 is driven through a range that contains a<br>
specific, isolated resonance; the resonant<br>
frequency f2 and the half-value width T2 are<br>
likewise determined. The values f2, T2 are<br>
independent of the product density by virtue of<br>
the arrangement of the reference resonator 2. The<br>
values f2, T2 are subsequently converted into<br>
corresponding values f0, T0 on the basis of two<br>
calibration curves stored in the evaluating unit.<br>
The values f0, T0 denote the resonant frequency<br>
and the half-value width respectively of the<br>
resonator 1 without product (measurement with no<br>
load) . These calibration curves, which clearly<br>
define the correlation between the variables f2 and<br>
fo and between the variables T2 and r0 for a<br>
specific product material, are initially<br>
determined in corresponding calibration<br>
measurements by variation in the environmental<br>
influences and specific disturbance variables<br>
within a range occurring in practice. In<br>
operation, no-load measurements to determine the<br>
variables f0, T0 can then be omitted, which is of<br>
advantage particularly in the case when<br><br>
measurements are being carried out on a product<br>
stream, where no-load measurements are possible<br>
only when the product stream is interrupted.<br>
From the variables mentioned, there is formed<br>
in a manner known per se a variable Ψ(A) =f( (f1-<br>
f0); (T1- r0) dependent only on the material<br>
density A, and dependent, neither on the moisture<br>
content of the material nor - owing to the<br>
invention - on environmental influences and<br>
specific disturbance variables. The material<br>
density A is determined from the variable Ψ by<br>
means of a calibration curve stored in the<br>
evaluating unit. This calibration curve, which<br>
clearly defines the correlation between the<br>
variables A and Ψ for a specific product, material,<br>
is first of all determined in a corresponding<br>
calibration measurement by variation of the<br>
product density within a range occurring in<br>
practice.<br>
The measurements in the measuring resonator 1<br>
and in the reference resonator 2 are carried out<br>
preferably at approximately comparable frequencies<br>
in order to avoid dispersion influences. The<br>
reference resonator 2 is accordingly preferably<br>
dimensioned so that the frequency ranges to be<br>
passed through in the case of the measuring<br>
resonator 1 and the reference resonator 2 have a<br>
mean spacing of less than 1 GHz, preferably less<br>
than 100 MHz, additionally preferably less than 10<br>
MHz. The measurements take place preferably in<br>
the frequency range from 0.1 to 20 GHz,<br>
additionally preferably 1 to 5 GHz, additionally<br>
preferably 2 to 3 GHz, additionally preferably 2.4<br>
to 2.5 GHz.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a carding machine 54, for<br><br>
example, the Trutzschler high-performance card DK<br>
903, with feed roller 13, feed table 14, licker-<br>
ins 151, 152, 153, cylinder 16, doffer 17,<br>
stripping roller 18, squeezing rollers 19, 20,<br>
web-guide element 21, web funnel 22, take-off<br>
rollers 23, 24, revolving card top 25, can coiler<br>
26 and can 27. The directions of rotation of the<br>
rollers are shown by respective curved arrows.<br>
The take-off rollers 23, 24 draw off a card sliver<br>
28, which passes over guide rollers 29, 30 to the<br>
can coiler 26 and from there is laid in the can<br>
27. The microwave measuring arrangement 31<br>
according to the invention (see Fig. 1, 2) is<br>
arranged between the take-off rollers 23, 24 and<br>
the guide roller 29. The microwave measuring<br>
arrangement 31 is connected to an electronic<br>
control and regulating device 32, for example, a<br>
microcomputer, which alters the rotational speed<br>
of the feed roller 13 by way of a variable speed<br>
drive motor 33. In this way, the density of the<br>
card sliver 28, which can leave the take-off<br>
rollers 23, 24 at high speed, for example, 200<br>
m/min or more, is adjusted. The letter A denotes<br>
the direction of working.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, a drawing system 34,<br>
which corresponds to the drawing system shown in<br>
Fig. 5, is arranged above the can coiler 26;<br>
reference will be made to the description of the<br>
drawing system of Fig. 5. At the feed end and<br>
delivery end of the drawing system 34 there is a<br>
respective microwave measuring arrangement 48, 49,<br>
which are connected to the electronic control and<br>
regulating device 32, which is furthermore<br>
connected to drive motors 46, 47 for the drawing<br>
system 34 and to a drive motor 21 for the can<br><br>
turntable.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5, a draw frame 55, for<br>
example, the Trutzschler draw frame HSR, has a<br>
drawing system 34, upstream of which is a drawing<br>
system feed 34a and downstream of which is a<br>
drawing system outlet 34b. The fibre slivers 35<br>
enter the sliver guide 36 from cans (not shown)<br>
and, drawn by the take-off rollers, are<br>
transported to the drawing system 34. The drawing<br>
system 34 is designed as a 4-over-3 drawing<br>
system, that is, it consists of three bottom<br>
rollers I, II, III (I being the bottom delivery<br>
roller, II being the bottom middle roller and III<br>
being the bottom feed roller) and four top rollers<br>
33, 38, 39, 40. Drafting of the composite fibre<br>
sliver 35', comprising several fibre slivers 35,<br>
takes place in the drawing system 34. The draft<br>
is made up from the preliminary draft and the main<br>
draft. The roller pairs 40/111 and 39/11 form the<br>
preliminary drafting zone and the roller pairs<br>
39/11 and 38, 33/1 form the main drafting zone.<br>
The drawn fibre slivers 35'' reach a web guide 41<br>
at the outlet of the drawing system and are drawn<br>
by means of the take-off rollers 42, 43 through a<br>
sliver funnel 44 in which they are condensed to a<br>
fibre sliver 45, which is subsequently deposited<br>
in a can (not shown). The letter C denotes the<br>
working direction, and 35' denotes the fibre<br>
slivers in the drawing system. The take-off<br>
rollers, the bottom feed roller III and the middle<br>
bottom roller II, which, are mechanically linked,<br>
for example, by way of toothed belts, are driven<br>
by the variable speed motor 46, it being possible<br>
to pre-set a desired value. (The associated top<br>
rollers 39 and 40 co-rotate). The bottom output<br><br>
roller I and the take-off rollers 42, 43 are<br>
driven by the main motor 47. At the inlet 34a to<br>
the drawing system, a variable proportional to the<br>
density of the fed-in fibre slivers 35 is measured<br>
by the feed-side measuring device 48 according to<br>
the invention. At the outlet 34b of the drawing<br>
system 34, the density of the fibre sliver is<br>
obtained by a delivery-side measuring device 49<br>
according to the invention associated with the<br>
sliver funnel 44. A central computer unit: 50<br>
(control and regulating device), e.g. a<br>
microcomputer with microprocessor, determines a<br>
setting of the regulated variable for the variable<br>
speed motor 46. The measured variables of the two<br>
measuring devices 48 and 49 are sent during the<br>
drawing process to the central computer unit 50.<br>
From the measured variables of the feed-side<br>
measuring device 48 and from the desired value for<br>
the density of the emerging fibre sliver 45, the<br>
adjustment value for the variable speed motor 46<br>
is determined in the central computer unit 50.<br>
The measured variables of the delivery-side<br>
measuring device 49 are used to monitor the<br>
emerging fibre sliver 45 (monitoring of delivered<br>
sliver) . By means of this control system,<br>
fluctuations in the density of the fed-in fibre<br>
slivers 35 can be compensated by corresponding<br>
adjustments to the drafting process and the fibre<br>
slivers can be evened out. The reference numeral<br>
51 denotes a display screen, 52 denotes an<br>
interface and 53 denotes an input means.<br>
Figures 6, 7 and 8 show basic layouts of the<br>
drawing system of a draw frame with different<br>
constructions for the adjustment of the fibre<br>
sliver density. Fig. 6 shows a closed control<br><br>
loop, in which the microwave measuring arrangement<br>
49 is arranged at the delivery end of the drawing<br>
system. The fibre material leaving the drawing<br>
system passes through the measuring arrangement<br>
49, the output signal of which is compared in the<br>
control electronics 50 with a desired value and is<br>
converted so that a corresponding control signal<br>
is supplied to an actuator (variable speed motor<br>
46, see Fig. 5) for the roller II. The output<br>
signal corresponding to the density of the<br>
emerging fibre material thus influences the speed<br>
ratio of the drafting roller pairs 39/I1 and 38/1<br>
in the sense that the fibre material is evened<br>
out. Fig. 7 shows an open control loop (open-loop<br>
control). Here, the microwave measuring<br>
arrangement 48 is located in the region in which<br>
the fibre material 35 approaches the drawing<br>
system, measures the density of the fibre material<br>
and the corresponding measuring signal is<br>
converted in the control electronics 50 into a<br>
control signal which is supplied to an actuator<br>
(variable speed motor 46, see Fig. 5) for the<br>
roller II. Allowances are made electronically for<br>
the time taken by the fibre material 35 to run<br>
from the measuring arrangement 48 to the drawing<br>
system. Fig. 8 shows a combination of an open and<br>
a closed control loop, in which the measuring<br>
signals of the measuring arrangement 49 are<br>
superimposed on the measuring signals of the<br>
measuring arrangement 43.<br>
On a production machine, for example, a card<br>
54 (Fig. 3) and draw frame 55 (Fig. 5) for the<br>
control and/or adjustment and also for monitoring<br>
the uniformity of the fibre slivers 28 and 45<br>
produced, compensation of environmental influences<br><br>
and disturbance variables can be effected by the<br>
reference resonator 2, preferably during regular<br>
pauses in production and/or during machine<br>
stoppages, for example, can changes, in which<br>
measurements with the measuring resonator 1 are<br>
not required. The reference measurement in the<br>
reference resonator 2 can be effected at regular<br>
or irregular intervals. It may be sufficient for<br>
a measurement to be carried out in reference<br>
resonator 2 after several minutes, preferably at<br>
the latest after a few hours, if environmental<br>
influences or disturbance variables have only a<br>
correspondingly slow effect. The efficiency of<br>
the machine is not affected thereby.<br>
When the change-over of the switches 7 and 8<br>
(Figs 1 and 2) and the stabilisation of the<br>
electrical field in the resonators 1 and 2 is<br>
effected within a short time, correction of the<br>
microwave measuring arrangement can be effected<br>
within a correspondingly short time. In this way,<br>
environmental influences and disturbance variables<br>
can be compensated during ongoing production in a<br>
processing machine.<br><br>
