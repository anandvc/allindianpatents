BUFFER CAPACITOR<br>
The invention relates to a buffer capacitor.<br>
Capacitors are used to store electric charge and in doing so concentrates the charge at the ends of the positive plate and at the point of contact between the capacitor electrode or connector and the positive plate. These concentrated charges eventually build up and leak to the negative plate causing resistive heating and inducing inductance impairing the performance of the capacitor and can result in capacitor failure.<br>
This invention relates to a buffer capacitor having at least one pair of positive and negative plates. Each plate is in the form of a loop current or charge buffer, Which comprises an electric conducting material, which may be rigid or flexible, arranged in parallel, electrically insulated from each other by a dielectric material and electrically joined to form a closed continuous electrical loop thereby eliminating the ends of 'the plates and subsequently charge concentration. The plates are arranged one on top the other in parallel and separated by alternate layers of a dielectric material or placed one inside the other and is electrically insulated from each other by a dielectric material. Each plate is provided with a conventional or a buffer electrode or connector, which comprises of a length of an electric conducting material which may be thin in cross-section over part or all of its length and electrically insulated over part of its thin length, the remaining length being of suitably sized and shaped cross-section, or<br><br>
either or each end provided with an eyelet for electrical connection. The thin cross sectioned un-insulated part of the electrode or connector is electrically connected to the plate and the remaining length is folded back parallel and is insulated from be connected length or folded around the plate with the un-insulated length electrically connected to the plate and the remaining length insulated from the plate andl electrically connected in each case to form a closed continuous electrical loop thereby reducing or eliminating charge concentration at the point of contact between the plate and the electrode or connector. Or each positive and negative plate is comprised ofa rigid or flexible electric conducting material formed into a current or charge buffers-by providing each end of each plate with a conventional or buffer electrode or connector,<br>
or each end of each plate is provided with or formed into a current or charge buffer<br><br>
with a conventional or buffer electrode or connector electrically connected to each current or charge buffer. In each case at least one positive and one negative plats arranged in parallel one on top of the other separated by alternate layers of a dielectric material and the connectors at the ends of each plate is electrically connected forming a continuous closed electrical loop which can be used for electrical connection.<br>

material 11 and electrically joined to form a closed electrical loop. The plates 10 are<br>
arranged on top the other in parallel and separated by alternate layers of a dielectric<br><br>
material 12 or as shown in figure 2 the loop current or charge buffer 10 placed on<br><br>
inside the other and separated by a dielectric material 12. Each plate is provided with a conventional or a buffer electrode or connector 13, which comprises of a length of an electric conducting material as shown in figure 6 which may be thin cross-section over part or all of its length 19 and electrically insulated 18 over part of its thin length<br>
the remaining length being of suitably sized and shaped cross-section, or either or<br>
each end provided with an eyelet 20 for electrical connection. As shown in figure7<br>
and figure 8 the thin cross-sectioned un-insulated 17 part of the electrode or connector<br>
is electrically connected to the plate 14 and the remaining length is folded back'<br>
parallel and is insulated 18 from the connected length or folded around the plate With<br>
the un-insulated 17 length electrically connected to the plate 14 and the remaining<br>
length insulated 18 from the plate and electrically connected in each case to form a<br>
closed continuous electrical loop. Or buffer capacitor as shown in figure 3 where each<br>
-positive and negative plate 14 is comprised of a rigid or flexible electric conducting<br><br>
material is formed into a current or charge buffers by providing each plate with<br><br>
conventional or buffer electrodes or connectors 15 and 16 at its extreme ends, or as<br>
