Description Drill, in particular twist drill<br>
The invention relates to a drill, in particular a twist drill, having a body provided with chip flutes as well as a drill front provided with at least two main cutting edges merging into each other.<br>
According to standard DIN ISO 5419, such a twist drill comprises a drill tip, herein referred to as drill front, which substantially provides the cutting functionality of the drill. Adjacent to the drill tip, there is a body, into which the chip flutes, extending in particular in helical form and starting each at a main cutting edge of the drill tip, are formed. In longitudinal direction of the drill, a shaft, by which the drill is chucked and held, is adjacent to the body.<br>
In a conventional twist drill with two main cutting edges, these are arranged relative to each other at an acute angle, as described in particular in DIN 1414-1. The two main cutting edges are connected with each other through a chisel edge arranged in the center of the drill. In the area of the chisel edge, the drill tip has a web thickness. The chisel edge is at the same time the foremost point of the drill, to which the main cutting edges are adjacent in the way of a conical surface, as well as the tool flanks, which are adjacent to the main cutting edges<br>
The drilling operation of such a twist drill in a workpiece forms a drill hole with a cone-shaped bottom. For certain applications, however, blind holes with a bottom as plane as possible are desired. It is not possible to drill such blind holes by means of a conventional twist drill, due to the inclination of the main cutting edges to each other at an acute angle.<br>
EP 0 089 123 A1 describes a drill for producing a hole with an almost plane bottom. This drill is provided with a primary edge arranged in the center of the drill and only extending over a partial section of the drill diameter. A secondary edge, set off in longitudinal direction of the drill, is adjacent to one side, said secondary edge extending from the primary edge to the outer circumference of the drill. Due to the projecting primary cutting edge, this drill is not able either to produce a hole bottom with a<br><br>
completely plane surface. The projecting primary edge is necessary in this case for<br>
centering purposes.<br>
Furthermore, DE-AS 1 177 904 describes a slot milling cutter, which is provided on its front face with a total of four front cutting edges, which are, however, not connected with each other over the center of the cutter. Such a milling cutter is, however, not suitable for drilling operations because due to the fact that it has no cutting edge in the center area, a purely rotational movement will not remove any chips in the center area. The cutter must, therefore, necessarily be moved in lateral direction, too.<br>
US 6,135,681 describes a plane-bottom drill with a cutting bit whose main cutting edges extend in a plane which is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the drill.<br>
It is the objective of the invention to provide a drilling tool or a drill, with which a blind hole with a flat, plane bottom can be produced.<br>
This task is solved by the invention through a drill according to claim 1, according to which the at least two main cutting edges of the drill front form a common, continuous edge extending in a plane which is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the drill. Therefore, the two main cutting edges are oriented to each other at an angle of 180°. The drill does not have a projecting tip, so that the bottom of the drill hole is completely even and plane. The edge formed by the main cutting edges extends over the entire drill diameter. The main cutting edges are preferably arranged symmetrically to each other and in particular point-symmetrically to the drill center.<br>
A particular advantage of this drill designed as a plane-bottom drill is the fact that for the production of, e.g., blind holes with a completely plane hole bottom, at least approximately the same cutting parameters and the same process and drilling times are achieved as with a conventional twist drill with conical drill tip. Thus, as compared with conventional slot mills, which usually have only one front edge and a large web diameter, clearly shorter process times are achieved, i.e. the machining time for the production of a blind hole is clearly shorter.<br>
With the plane-bottom drill, exact blind hole shapes with plane bottom, in particular also with stepped drill-hole walls (stepped holes) are possible without problems and with economic efficiency. To form a stepped hole, as it is necessary, e.g., for forming a valve seat, the plane-bottom drill has additional cutting edges, which extend radially outwards<br><br>
and which are offset against the main cutting edges by one step depth. Furthermore, when the plane-bottom drill is used for drilling through-holes, it will produce hole rims<br>
with little burr.<br>
Another substantial advantage of the completely plane orientation of the edge with an end-face cutting edge is the fact that the drill can also be applied without problems on curved surfaces without being strongly pushed aside - contrary to a conical drill tip.<br>
Due to the continuous edge with perpendicular orientation to the longitudinal axis of the drill, a uniform chip removal in one plane is achieved over the entire drill diameter.<br>
Furthermore, the main cutting edges - in relation to the cutting direction of the drill - are arranged behind a center line, lying in the plane which is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the drill and extending through the center of the drill. Each of the main cutting edges is situated offset, in particular by half a web diameter, against the center line. Thanks to this measure, the main cutting edges can be ground without problems with a grinding wheel, without touching the second main cutting edge when grinding the first main cutting edge.<br>
Suitably, the main cutting edges are straight-lined, so that the edge runs approximately along a line. In this way, the forces acting upon the drill are symmetrically distributed, so that during the drilling operation, the drill is subjected to only slight lateral forces, which would negatively influence the geometry of the drill-hole.<br>
Preferably, the two main cutting edges are connected with each other through a remaining chisel edge in a center of the drill front, so that the main cutting edges are offset against each other in the plane which is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the drill. The remaining chisel edge has only a small dimension, so that the offset is only slight. The offset corresponds approximately to one time the web diameter of the front center. This web diameter and, thus, also the offset, varies with the drill diameter and suitably increases with the latter, ascending approximately degressively. For drill diameters of about 3 to 30 mm, the web diameter is preferably about 0.05 to 0.35 mm.<br><br>
The web diameter is preferably determined according to the root of the drill diameter weighted by a constant factor.<br>
The arrangement of the remaining chisel edge in the drill center in combination with the parallel offset of the main cutting edges enables a simple grinding of the two main cutting edges. At the same time, sufficient strength is achieved in the area of the drill center. In addition, due to the very small dimension of the chisel edge and, therefore, of the web diameter, an efficient chip cutting without excessive squeezing is achieved even in the center. In this way, the so-called center chip can efficiently be removed, thus avoiding squeezing in the area of the drill center. In contrast to that, conventional twist drills have a clearly larger web thickness in the area of the drill tip, which also increases with the drill diameter, DIN 1414-1 providing for a drill diameter of 3 mm already a minimum web thickness of about 0.5 mm and for a drill diameter of about 30 mm, a minimum web thickness of about 3.5 mm.<br>
To achieve the best possible drilling result and an efficient chip removal, the transition from the main cutting edge over the front center into a flank adjacent to the front center and assigned to the other main cutting edge extends along a front gap radius. The latter preferably increases with increasing drill diameter and lies in the range of 0.5 to 4.2 mm for drill diameters of 3 to 30 mm.<br>
To make grinding as easy as possible, it is, furthermore, provided that adjacent to each main cutting edge, there is a first flank with a first flank angle, and adjacent to that, a second flank with a flank angle larger than the first flank angle. The flanks assigned to each of the main cutting edges form approximately roof-shaped faces inclined towards each other at different angles of inclination. Due to the relatively flat first flank, the drill front possesses in the area of the main cutting edges a sufficiently high material strength and is, therefore, sufficiently stable. Therefore, the cutting wedge which is formed on the main cutting edge and which is defined by the flank and the rake face, which abut to each other on the main cutting edge, is stable. Suitably, the first flank angle is in the range between 4° and 10° and the second flank angle, in the range between 8° and 20°, the choice of the angle depending on the material. For a drill<br><br>
designed for steel, these two angles are in particular approximately 6° and 12°, respectively.<br>
Preferably, it is, furthermore, provided that the width of the first flank increases from a center width in the area of the drill center towards an outer width on the outer circumference of the drill. In principle, the largest possible width of the first flank is desired in order to make the cutting wedge as stable as possible. At the same time, however, due to the small inclination, the width must not be too large, as otherwise the clearance for the chip to be removed would not be sufficient. The reduction of the width of the first flank towards the drill center takes into account in particular the problematic evacuation of the center chip. Preferably, the width of the first flank increases with increasing drill diameter and amounts for the center width to approximately 0.03 to 0.4 mm and for the outer width, to approximately 0.15 to 0.9 mm, for drill diameters between 3 and 30 mm. The width increases in particular degressively, namely continuously with increasing drill diameter and over the entire length of the flank.<br>
In view of the problems of a reliable evacuation of the center chips, suitably a so-called point thinning of each chip flute is, furthermore, provided on the drill front. This point thinning is produced by a grinding operation. Through the point thinning, one front gap each is formed in the area of the drill front. For an efficient chip evacuation, this point thinning presents several features, which are preferably realized in combination.<br>
On the one hand, it is suitably provided that the point thinning extends beyond a center line which is perpendicular to the main cutting edges. The point thinning, i.e. the clearance for the chips to be removed, extends over the main cutting edge assigned to the point thinning up to the area of the remaining chisel edge and preferably even up to the area of the second main cutting edge. Furthermore, it is suitably provided that the point thinning includes with the longitudinal axis of the drill an angle of approx. 20° to 40°, in particular of approx. 30°. This angle is preferably approximately equal to a helix angle of the chip flute, i.e. the angle at which the marginal line of the respective chip flute extends in relation to the longitudinal axis of the drill. Through this measure, the radial depth of the point thinning inclines in the course of the longitudinal axis of the drill. This directs the chip effectively from the drill center into the helical chip flute.<br><br>
Preferably, the point thinning possesses in addition a relatively large aperture angle of approx. 70° ± 15°.<br>
A rake face is adjacent to each main cutting edge, in the direction of each chip flute. This rake face is arranged at a rake angle of preferably approx. -8° to +10°. The rake angle indicates the angle between the rake face and a plane extending parallel to the longitudinal axis of the drill. That means that the rake angle is a measure for a deviation of the rake face from the plane extending parallel to the longitudinal axis of the drill. A positive rake angle indicates an acute cutting wedge, a negative rake angle, an obtuse cutting wedge. The rake face is suitably ground together with the point thinning. As the point thinning is ground into the already existing chip flute, the grinding operation changes the existing rake face, i.e., a so-called "rake-angle correction" takes place. The corrected rake face generated by point thinning, adjacent to the main cutting edge, preferably has in longitudinal direction of the drill a dimension amounting to approximately double the feed value per revolution of the edge, for which the drill is designed.<br>
In a preferred development, the rake face runs out into a minor cutting edge, for uniform chip evacuation. In the area where the rake face runs out into the minor cutting edge, it has a width in the range of approx. 0.10 to 0.70 mm for drill diameters of approx. 3 to 30 mm.<br>
Due to the completely plane runout of the edge, the drill possesses no front tip fulfilling a centering function. Therefore, according to a suitable development, a double chamfer is provided on the circumference of the drill, for an appropriate guidance of the drill. For this purpose, lands are formed on the two marginal sides of the web extending between the chip flutes, the lands determining the outer circumference of the drill.<br>
Also for the sake of an appropriate guidance of the drill, it is provided that each main cutting edge merges, over a corner cutting edge which is rounded and preferably chamfered, into a respective minor cutting edge extending along the chip flute. This chamfered or rounded design of the corner cutting edge provides for a self-centering of the drill, in particular when spot-drilling. To keep the resulting roundness or chamfer of<br><br>
4<br>
the bottom of the drilled hole as small as possible, the height of the roundness or of the chamfer, parallel to the longitudinal axis of the drill, is approx. 0.15 to 0.80 mm for a drill<br>
diameter of 3 to 30 mm.<br>
Furthermore, it is suitably provided that a corner-edge flank is adjacent to the corner cutting edge, to ensure a reliable chip removal. The flank can consist of two partial flanks or of one curved flank.<br>

The drill 2, designed as a twist drill according to Fig. 1A, comprises a shank 4, a body 8 adjacent to it along a longitudinal axis 6 of the drill, the front end of said body 8 being provided with a drill front 10. Helically extending chip spaces or chip flutes 12, with a web 14 each being formed between them, are formed into the body 8. The chip flutes<br><br>
12 are oriented at a helix angle ω relative to the longitudinal axis 6. The drill has a drill diameter d which slightly decreases in the direction of the shank 4.<br>
Fig. 1A shows clearly that the drill front 10 is of a completely plane design and lies in a plane which is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 6. With such a drill 2, a blind hole 18 with a completely plane bottom can be produced in a workpiece 16, as is apparent from Fig. 1B.<br>
The completely plane design of the drill front 10 also enables an easy spot-drilling even on curved surfaces because due to the absence of the conical drill tip usual in a conventional twist drill, the drill will not slip on the curved surface.<br>
The completely plane design in the cutting area of the drill front 10 and the absence of the usual conical drill tip entail particular requirements concerning the self-centering and guidance of the drill 2 as well as concerning a reliable chip evacuation, in particular of the so-called center chip. To achieve a good guidance of the drill and to guarantee a reliable chip evacuation, the drill 2 possesses a multitude of features which enable, in particular in their combined effect, a safe and reliable drilling operation with a good drilling result.<br>
As is apparent in particular from Figs. 2A and 2B, the drill front 10 of the drill 2 includes two main cutting edges 20 merging into each other over a remaining chisel edge 22. The main cutting edges 20 as well as the remaining chisel edge 22 form a common edge extending completely in the plane which is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 6. The main cutting edges 20 are straight-lined and lie - with the exception of a slight offset caused by the remaining chisel edge 22 - substantially in one line. In the transitional area between the two main cutting edges 20 formed by the remaining chisel edge 22, the material thickness is extremely small. In the drill center 24, the drill front 10 has a web diameter k, here shown in the shape of a circle, which is very small as compared with the usual web diameters of twist drills.<br>
.	...<br>
A two-piece flank, consisting of a first flank 26 and a second flank 28, is adjacent to each of the main cutting edges 20. The first fiank 26 is assigned a first flank angle a1<br><br>
and the second flank 28 is assigned a second flank angle a2, as is apparent in particular from the sectional view according to Fig. 3B. The first flank 26 has a width increasing from the drill center 24 towards the drill outside, the first flank 26 having in the area of the center a center width b1 and on the outer circumference, an outer width<br>
b2.<br>
As is apparent in particular from Fig. 2B, each main cutting edge 20 is situated at a distance from a center line 30 extending through the drill center 24, namely each main cutting edge 20 is arranged behind the center line 30, as viewed in cutting direction 32. The cutting direction 32 indicates the normal direction of rotation of the drill 2.<br>
This design with the arrangement of the main cutting edges 20 behind the center as well as the design with the two-piece flank 26, 28 enables a particularly good grinding of the desired edge geometry of the drill 2, as the arrangement of the main cutting edges 20 behind the center avoids the risk that, when grinding one main cutting edge 20, the other main cutting edge 20 will be touched and will in this way possibly be ground blunt again. The design of the two-piece flank 26, 28 also facilitates the grinding, because due to the larger second flank angle a2, it would hardly be possible to grind up to the drill center 24 as this would weaken in particular the drill center 24 with the small web diameter k. Due to the relatively shallow first flank angle a1, the drill 2 is designed sufficiently thick and, therefore, stable, in the area of the main cutting edge 20. In this way, a sufficiently stable cutting wedge is achieved. Such a cutting wedge is shown in Fig. 3B. The cutting wedge is formed by the flanks 26, 28 and a rake face 34 extending in the chip flute 12 up to the main cutting edge 20.<br>
A particular problem of drills in general is a reliable chip evacuation, in particular of the center chip, as here, no relative movement, or only a slight relative movement, takes place between the drill 2 and the workpiece 16. The drill 2 with the plane edge geometry described herein imposes particular requirements on chip evacuation.<br>
In order to enable a reliable chip evacuation, a particular point thinning 36 (cf. in particular Figs. 2A, 3A), in particular in connection with the very small web diameter k in the area of the remaining chisel edge 22, is provided. To achieve the point thinning 36,<br><br>
usually a suitably shaped grinding wheel is introduced into the chip flute 12 in the area of the drill front 10. In this way, the existing chip flute 12 and the rake angle e1, respectively, are "corrected" (cf. Fig. 3B). As a result, the point thinning 36 is formed, which is understood herein as a certain course of a surface in the area of the chip flute 12 which is adjacent to the respective main cutting edge 20. The course of the point thinning is apparent in particular from Figs. 2A, 3A, 4, and 5.<br>
The entire point thinning 36, also called "front gap", possesses an aperture angle y. shown in Fig. 4. This angle is very large, in the range of approx. 70°.<br>
The point thinning 36 extends beyond the center, as shown in Fig. 2A. This means that the point thinning 36 extends beyond a further center line 38, oriented perpendicular to the first center line 30 and, therefore, perpendicular to the course of the main cutting edges 20. As is apparent in particular from Fig. 2A, the point thinning 36 assigned to one of the main cutting edges 20 extends almost up to a level corresponding to the web diameter k, at which the other main cutting edge 20 begins. Thanks to this measure, a very large clearance is available for a chip removed in the center, through which it can be evacuated. The course of the point thinning 36 in the area of the front center is formed by a front gap radius r (Fig. 4) which increases with increasing drill diameter d and lies in the range of 0.5 to 4.2 mm for drill diameters d between 3 and 30 mm.<br>
Related to the longitudinal axis 6 of the drill, the point thinning 36 extends at a point-thinning angle 5 of approx. 30° (Fig. 3A). This point-thinning angle 5 extends almost parallel to the helix angle ω, at which the chip flute 12 is oriented towards the longitudinal axis 6. The point-thinning angle 5 is, therefore, almost as large as the helix angle co. Therefore, the point thinning 36 runs out in the direction of the longitudinal axis 6, i.e. the radial depth of the point thinning 36 decreases in longitudinal direction of the drill 2. Through this measure, the chip is advantageously evacuated into the two chip flutes 12.<br>
Immediately adjacent to the main cutting edge 20, the point thinning 36 includes and defines in addition the rake face 34, as is apparent in particular from Fig. 3A and Fig. 5. This rake face 34 extends up to a corner cutting edge 42 forming a transition between the main cutting edge 20 and a minor cutting edge 44 (Fig. 3A, Fig. 4, Fig. 5). The rake<br><br>
face 34 has a width b3 running out towards the minor cutting edge 44 and in a central area, it has a minimum width b4. The rake face width b4 is determined in particular by the feed for which the drill 2 is designed. Namely, the rake face width b4 is preferably double or possibly more than double the feed per revolution of the drill 2. The rake face width b3 lies in particular in the range of 0.1 to 0.7 mm for drill diameters d of approx. 3 to 30 mm and the minimum rake face width b4 should not be less than 0.05 to 0.25 mm for the entire range of the drill diameter d. For light-metal workpiece materials, e.g. aluminium, the rake face width b3 may also be 0.<br>
As is apparent from Fig. 5, the point thinning 36 is designed in the area of the rake face 34 in particular in such a way that the end of the rake face 34, running out in the direction of the longitudinal axis 6, meets the transitional point where the corner cutting edge 42 merges into the minor cutting edge 44. In this way, a harmonious and uniform transition is achieved.<br>
The rake face 34 is arranged at a rake angle ε1 to a plane extending parallel to the longitudinal axis 6, as is apparent in particular from Fig. 3B. The rake angle e1 is fixed, depending on the material to be drilled, at a value between -8° and +10°. In Fig. 3B, a positive rake angle ε1 is shown, so that altogether an acute cutting wedge is formed, i.e. the angle between the plane which is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 6 of the drill and the rake face 34 is smaller than 90°. A negative rake angle means an obtuse cutting wedge with an angle larger than 90°. in case of a negative orientation, the rake face width b3 is even slightly smaller than the above-mentioned values.<br>
Furthermore, for the drill 2 with the plane cutting geometry, some preferred measures are provided through which, in particular through their combination, a very good guidance of the drill 2 is achieved. First, it is provided that the drill 2 is formed with a double land. That means that on each of the two lateral margins of the webs 14, a land 46 is provided, as is apparent in particular from Fig. 2A. Through the lands 46, the drill 2 is centrally guided in the drill-hole, the lands 46 forming on the circumference of the drill a web-shaped elevation over the remaining outer surface of the webs 14. Thus, the lands 46 define the outer circumference of the drill.<br><br>
As can also be seen in Fig. 2A, the point thinning 36 ends at a distance before the land 46 which is at the rear of the respective web 14, i.e. facing away from the main cutting edge 20. This guarantees that this land 46 will not be damaged through the grinding of<br>
the point thinning 36.<br>
Furthermore, for a good guidance, a suitable geometry of the corner cutting edges 42 is provided, namely the latter are chamfered, as is apparent from Fig. 5, or rounded, as is apparent from the enlarged view according to Fig. 7. The chamfer or roundness causes a certain self-centering of the drill. At the same time, it fixes the edge geometry of the blind hole 18 in the area of the drill-hole bottom. Depending on the desired edge geometry, different shapes can be provided.<br>
In view of the target to make the drill-hole bottom as plane as possible, the height h of this roundness or chamfer is, however, only approx. 0.15 to 0.80 mm for drill diameters d of 3 to 30 mm (cf. Fig. 5).<br>
To guarantee an adequate chip evacuation in the area of the corner cutting edge 42, corner-edge flanks 48 are provided on the corner cutting edges 42, as is apparent from Figs. 6A and 6B. According to Fig. 6A, the corner-edge flank 48 is formed by two partial flanks 47, 49, comparable with the first and second flanks 26, 28 adjacent to each main cutting edge 20. According to Fig. 6B, the flank 48 is rounded and formed as a clearance produced by grinding.<br>
The first partial flank 47 adjacent to the corner cutting edge 42 is arranged at a first partial-flank angle a3 and the second partial flank 49 adjacent to this flank 47 is arranged at a second, larger partial-flank angle a4, the first partial-flank angle a3 preferably lying in the range between 4° and 12°, depending on the material to be cut.<br>
In the second embodiment according to Fig. 6B, the flank 48 is oriented at a flank angle<br>
α 5, which is chosen, depending on the material to be cut and in particular also depend<br>
ing on the drill diameter d, in the range of 3° to 10°.	,<br><br>
As is apparent in particular from Fig. 6B, the rake face 34 extends in the direction of the respective chip flutes 12. The width of the rake face lies, depending on the material to be cut, in the range of 0.05 to 0.30 mm. The rake face 34 is arranged in the area of the corner cutting edge 42 at a corner-edge rake angle s2 (cf. Fig. 6A), which is chosen, depending on the material to be cut, in the range of -8° to +8°.<br>
To cool the drill 2, the latter includes coolant channels 50 formed into the body 8, as is apparent in particular from Fig. 2A. To guarantee a smooth chip evacuation, it is, furthermore, provided that the chip space formed by the chip flutes 12 has a chip-evacuation cross-section increasing towards the shank 4, i.e the cross-section of each chip flute 12 formed perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 6 increases in the direction of the shank. This is achieved either through a so-called core taper and/or through a so-called chip-space opening.<br>
The plane-bottom drill described herein is characterized by very good drilling properties and, therefore, offers a particularly efficient cutting tool for different requirements. One must emphasize in particular its suitability for producing blind holes with plane bottoms and for producing through holes with little burr, the possibility to apply the drill even on curved surfaces, as well as its good centering ability. These properties are achieved through the special geometrical design of the plane-bottom drills. In addition to the design and the arrangement of the main cutting edges 20, the special geometry of the point thinning 36, of the double lands 46, of the corner cutting edges 42, and of the rake face 34 are of particular importance.<br><br>
