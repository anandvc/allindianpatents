				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to camouflaging syringe with a syringe cover, subsequently hiding the needle and the syringe from the sight of the patient at the time of injection procedure.<br>
DESCRIPTION OFPRIQR ART:<br>
Presently available injection syringe (FIiGURE-l(a)) comprises of a needle (1), syringe body (2) and a plunger (3).The needle (1) is attached to the body through the hub(14). FIGURE-I(b) is the view of the syringe body from the distal aspect. These syringes are made up of metal, plastic or glass. They are used to inject vaccine or medicine into the skin (intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly) or mucous membrane (mucosa of the oral cavity, or genitals). Every individual whether young or old have to go through the pain of injection. The first experience of an injection itself instils painful memories in the mind of child. One of the factor contributing to fear during injection is the gruesome appearance of the syringe and more precisely the needle which results in decreased cooperation on the part of the patient and subsequently present with following technical problems:<br>
(a)	The appearance of the syringe used for administrating medicine or vaccine produces a psychological fear into patients and thus makes it undesirable to use in medical setup. This is more common in the field of dentistry especially when local anaesthesia is needed to be administered in the oral cavity for extractions in a child patient. During injecting the local anaesthetic solution, the scared chili does not allow the needle to enter the sensitive oral mucosa or let the syringe come anywhere close to the mouth. This causes the child patient to move during Injection procedure thus increasing the chances of missing the exact location of injection. The doctor is then left with two options for the uncooperative patient i.e. either forceful injecting or premedicating the patient with sedative. The painful, forcefiil injection leaves a permanent bad memory in the mind of the young and the premedication has its own side-effects for the young age group.<br>
(b)	Due to the above mentioned movements on the part of the patient there are chances of accidental injury (needle prick injury) to the doctor thus increasing the chances of transmission of life-threatening infections such as certain bacterial infections, HIV, Hepatitis and others. The other reason for injury if not due to patient movement is during the mounting of a protective cap on the needle. It is a common practise to mount a protective cap on the needle after the syringe has been used, so that the needle is protected in the condition in which the syringe is disposed off.<br>
Frequently, however, it is just the process of mounting the protective cap that leads to needle-prick injuries, (c) The presently available syringe does not have any structural component which can be used for application of topical anaesthesia to produce local numbness at the site of injection. The application of topical anaesthesia before injecting at the site of injection produces local numbness thus the sensation of prick of the needle during injection procedure is not felt by the patient. The pain and fear during injecting procedure results in a vicious cycle of movements during injection procedure, missing the exact location for injecting, needle prick injuries, psychological fear for the needle in future injecting procedure. Thus the above mentioned deficiencies in the present syringe raise the need for improvement.<br>
The objective of this invention is to overcome: • The pain and fear, the resultant reduction of the need of premedication (administration of sedatives for better cooperation before any operative procedure), to achieve professional efficiency during injecting, to prevent needle prick injuries, to make syringes aesthetically acceptable to patients and thus contribute towards strengthening of the doctor-patient relationship.<br>
This objective is achieved by a Camouflage syringe comprising of a syringe and syringe cover.<br>
The distinguishing features of the Camouflage syringe comprising of the syringe cover and the syringe when compared to the already available syringe alone are as follows:<br>
1.	The Camouflage syringe has bristles (7) for the application of topical anaesthetic gel/solution which eliminates pain during injecting procedure as compared to the presently available syringe.<br>
2.	The syringe cover of the Camouflage syringe hides the needle (1) and the syringe on the whole thus reducing the psychological fear and the subsequent need for premedication with sedatives.<br>
3.	The syringe cover of the Camouflage syringe prevents needle-prick injuries as the needle is retracted into the syringe cover soon after the medicine is injected into the tissues and thus the risk of cross infection of life-threatening conditions is eliminated.<br>
4.	The syringe cover of the Camouflage syringe is colourful and in different shapes. This makes it highly aesthetically acceptable for its use in a child patient<br>
5.	The Camouflage syringe fulfils all the functional needs of a syringe i.e. aspiration results can be checked and smooth injecting of solutions can be achieved and thus is not functionally deficient in any aspect when compared to conventional syringe, mfact due to above mentioned reasons the success of the treatment increases many folds with the said Camouflage syringe.<br>
Therefore, the syringe cover and thus the Camouflage syringe is an absolute solution to the shortcomings of the presently available syringes.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION:<br>
The first aspect of the invention i.e. The syringe cover is made substantially of PVC like copolymer or homopolymcr formed from polyethylene or polypropylene. It is colourful and can be available in different shapes resembling a toy. The syringe cover comprises of:-<br>
i.        HEAD (4)<br>
ii.       BODY (5)<br>
iii.      TAIL (6)<br>
HEAD(4) see FIGURE-3:<br>
It is circular disc shaped with a central opening (13). Around the periphery of the central opening of the head (4), bristles (7) are present. The bristles (7) are arranged in a direction so that they converge towards the central opening (13) giving the head a conical look. The bristles (7) are integrally moulded with the head of the syringe cover (FIGURE-2). The central opening (13) allows the passage of the needle (1) during injection procedure (FIGURE-5). The bristles (7) are used for the application of the topical anaesthetic gel/solution. The head (4) is continuous with the body of the syringe cover (5).<br>
BODY(5):<br>
Body (5) is a cylindrical long shaft which interconnects the conventional syringe and allows the syringe movement towards the head (4) of the syringe cover (FIGURE-4) so that the needle (1) comes out through the central opening (13) during the injecting procedure. It shows the presence of a slot (8) to check for aspiration results during injecting procedure. It also shows presence of three ribs (9), (11), (12) which are present on the internal surface of the cylindrical body. The first rib (9) is present anteriorly in the region of the slot (FIGURE-2) and thus forms an incomplete ring around the circumference of the internal surface of the body (5).  The second rib (11) and the third rib (12) are present at the distal end of the body towards the tail (6) see FIGURE-3 and FIGURE-6. The function of the rib is to prevent the back sliding of the syringe from the body (5) of the cover towards the tail (6) and to prevent the accidental entry of the needle (1) from the head (4) end unless a little pressure is given to the syringe(FIGURE-l(a)). Body of the cover (5) is continuous with the tail (6).<br>
TAIL(6):<br>
Tail shows presence of a gripping portion (10), which helps in holding the Camouflage syringe (syringe cover and the syringe loaded with the liquid medicine) during the injection procedure. The view of the tail from distal aspect shows that it is circular but not continuous all around the circumference (FIGURE-6) and shows discontinuity in two regions (16) of FIGURE-6(b) for the accommodation of the wings of the conventional syringe (15) of (FIGURE-1) during the injection procedure.<br>
The second aspect of the invention i.e. The Camouflage syringe comprises of the syringe cover and the syringe. The syringe is loaded with the local anaesthetic solution and interconnected with the syringe cover (FIGURE-5). The syringe of the Camouflage syringe slides in the syringe cover.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS:<br>
•	FIGURE-l(a): Presently available syringe.<br>
It comprises of the needle (1) connected to the body (2) of the syringe through the hub (14). The plunger (3) is used to push the solution through the needle (1) into the tissues. The body (2) shows the presence of the wings (15) which is used to grip the body during the forward push of the plunger.<br>
    FIGURE-l(b): View of the syringe body from the distal aspect. This view shows the wings(15) of the body (2) of the syringe.<br>
•	FIGURE-2:    Three dimensional view of the syringe cover.<br>
The Syringe cover comprises of the head (4), the body (5) and the tail (6) The head (4) presents with bristles (7) that are integrally moulded with the head (4) of the syringe cover. The bristles (7) are directed obliquely to converge towards the centre. The body (5) presents with a slot (8) to check the aspiration results during injecting. The internal surface of the body presents with three ribs (9), (11), (12). The first rib (9) is present anteriorly in the region of the slot (FIGURE-2) and thus forms an incomplete ring around the circumference of the internal surface of the body (5). The second rib (11) and the thrird rib (12) are present at the distal end of the body towards the tail (6). The function of the rib is to prevent the back sliding of the syringe from the body (5) of the cover towards the tail (6) and to prevent the accidental entry of the needle (1) from the head (4) end unless a little pressure is given to the syringe. Body of the cover (5) is continuous with the tail (6).<br>

STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Camouflage syringe characterised by a syringe cover having a head (4) consisting of bristles (7) to apply local anaesthetic solution or gel, a central opening (13) through which the needle (1) comes out during the injecting procedure, a body (5) which interconnects the syringe and allows the syringe movement towards the head (4) of the syringe cover so that the needle (1) comes out through the central opening (13) during the injecting procedure, the body (5) having the slot (8) to check for the aspiration results, the internal surface of the body shows the presence of three ribs (9,11,12), the first rib (9) is present anteriorly in the region of the slot and thus forms an incomplete ring around the circumference of the internal body surface, the second rib (11) and the third rib (12) are present at the distal end of the body towards the tail (6), the tail (6) shows the presence of the gripping portion (10) for sliding of the syringe towards the central opening (13); said syringe cover is interconnected with the conventional syringe which comprises of a needle(l), syringe body (2) and plunger (3) slidably mounted in the body (2).<br>
PROCEDURE OF USE:<br>
•	The syringe (FIGURE-1(a)) loaded with the liquid medicine/<br>
vaccine is placed inside the syringe cover (FIGURE- 2).<br>
       The next step is to apply topical anaesthetic gel to the area<br>
where the needle needs to be penetrated. This is done by using the bristles (7) present in the head (4) of the syringe cover. The topical anaesthetic gells taken over the bristles (7) and applied to the area of interest in the body.<br>
•	After an interval of five minutes (which is the time needed for<br>
the topical anaesthetic gel to produce numbness), the syringe (FIGURE-1(a)) is slided anteriorly towards the central opening (13)with gentle pressure so as to get through the ribs(9), (11), (12) and let it emerge from the anterior end of the syringe cover through the central opening (13), see (FIGURE-5). The needle (1) is then inserted into the area of nerve block or the area of interest in tissues for deposition of local anaesthesia or medicine respectively.<br>
       The plunger (3) is retracted backwards to check for the aspiration results through the slot (8). If the aspiration is negative i.e. no blood<br>
•is seen through the slot (8) of the syringe cover, the solution in the syringe is the gradually pushed into the tissues (FIGURE-5).<br>
Once the solution is deposited in the tissues, the syringe is retracted or withdrawn inside the syringe cover (FIGURE-2).This prevents the needle-prick injuries and thus the risk of cross-infection is eliminated.<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
i.        Pain and fear almost completely eliminated.<br>
ii.       Needle-prick injuries completely avoided.<br>
iii.      Professional efficiency improved i.e. all the operative procedures performed at their best and time is saved.<br>
iv.      Minimises the use of sedatives or depressants as premedication in an uncooperative patient before any operative procedure and thus the side-effects.<br>
V.       Syringe cover/ Camouflage syringe is used as disposables eliminates the need of resterilisation and subsequently the risk of cross-infection of life-threatening infections.<br>
vi.      Very economical.<br>
vii.    User friendly, colourful covers are most aesthetically acceptable by all and play an important role for children's medical treatment.<br>
viii.   The syringe cover can be given to the children as positive reinforcer for their cooperation during treatment so that they can take it home.<br>
ix.     Doctor-patient relationship is strengthened.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
