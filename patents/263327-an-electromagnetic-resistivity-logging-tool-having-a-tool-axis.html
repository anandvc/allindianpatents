This invention relates to a system and method having radially offset antennas for electromagnetic resistivity logging.<br>
Prior Art<br>
The basic principles and techniques for electromagnetic logging for earth formations are well known. For example, induction logging to determine the resistivity (or its inverse, conductivity) of earth formations adjacent a borehole has long been a standard and important technique in the search for and recovery of subterranean petroleum deposits. In brief, a transmitter transmits an electromagnetic signal that passes through formation materials around the borehole and induces a signal in one or more receivers. The amplitude and/or phase of the receiver signals are influenced by the formation resistivity, enabling resistivity measurements to be made. The measured signal characteristics and/or formation properties calculated therefrom are recorded as a function of the tool's depth or position in the borehole, yielding a formation log that can be used by analysts.<br>
Note, however, that the resistivity of a given formation may be isotropic (equal in all directions) or anisotropic (unequal in different directions). Formation resistivity logging is further complicated by the presence of borehole fluids. Drillers employ borehole fluids to cool the drill bit, remove drill cuttings, and to preserve the integrity of the borehole. Some borehole fluids are water-based and tend to be fairly conducive, while other borehole fluids are oil-based and tend to be highly resistive. While various existing resistivity logging tools perform well in water-based fluids, the options for resistivity logging in oil-based fluids are much more limited.<br>

While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.<br>
Description of Invention w.r.t. Drawings<br>
Disclosed herein are electromagnetic resistivity logging systems and methods that employ magnetic dipole antennas embedded in wall-contacting surfaces. Prototypes of electromagnetic resistivity logging tools having such antennas exhibit good resistivity logging performance in both water-based and oil-based borehole fluids, suggesting that this architecture may yield a logging tool that is suitable for use with borehole fluids of all types. Moreover, the tool offers good spatial resolution, enaoling the creation of formation resistivity images for the borehole walls.<br>
The disclosed tool configurations and operations are best understood in the context of the larger systems in which they operate. Accordingly, an illustrative logging while drilling (LWD) environment is shown in Fig. 1. A drilling platform 2 is equipped with a derrick 4 that supports a hoist 6 for raising and lowering a drill string 8. The hoist 6 suspends a top drive 10 that is used to rotate the drill string 8 and to lower the drill string through the well head 12. Connected to the lower end of the drill string 8 is a drill bit 14. The bit 14 is rotated and drilling accomplished by rotating the drill string 8, by use of a downhole motor near the drill bit, or by both methods. Drilling fluid, termed "mud", is pumped by mud recirculation equipment: 16 through supply pipe 18, through top drive 10, and down through the drill string 8 at high pressures and volumes to emerge through<br>
nozzles or jets in the drill bit 14. The mud then travels back up the hole via the annulus formed between the exterior of the drill string 8 and the borehole wall 20, through a blowout preventer (not specifically shown), and into a mud pit 24 on the surface. On the surface, the drilling mud is cleaned and then recirculated by recirculation equipment 16. The drilling mud is used to cool the drill bit 14, to carry cuttings from the base of the bore to the surface, and to balance the hydrostatic pressure in the rock formations.<br>
In wells employing acoustic telemetry for LWD, downhole sensors (including resistivity logging tool 26) are coupled to an acoustic telemetry transmitter 28 that transmits telemetry signals in the form of acoustic vibrations in the tubing wall of drill string 8. An acoustic telemetry receiver array 30 may be coupled to tubing below the top drive 10 to receive transmitted telemetry signals. One or more repeater modules 32 may be optionally provided along the drill string to receive and retransmit the telemetry signals. The repeater modules 32 include both an acoustic telemetry receiver array and an acoustic telemetry transmitter configured similarly to receiver array 30 and the transmitter 28.<br>
Electromagnetic resistivity logging tool 26 is integrated into the bottom-hole assembly near the tit 14. As the bit extends the borehole through the formations, the downhole sensors collect measurements relating to various formation properties as well as the tool orientation and position and various other drilling conditions. (The orientation measurements may be performed using an azimuthal orientation indicator, which may include magnetometers, inclinometers, and/or accelerometers, though other sensor types such as gyroscopes may be used. In some embodiments, the tool includes a 3-axis fluxgate magnetomete and a 3-axis accelerometer.) Electromagnetic resistivity logging tool 26 may take the form of a drill collar, i.e., a thick-walled tubular that provides weight and rigidity to aid the drilling process.<br>
At various times during the drilling process, the drill string 8 may be removed from the borehole as shown in Fig. 2. Once the drill string has been removed, logging operations can be conducted using a wireline logging tool 34, i.e., a sensing instrument sonde suspended by a cable 42 having conductors for transporting power to the tool and telemetry from the tool to the surface. A resistivity imaging portion of the logging tool 34 may have centralizing arms 36 that center the tool within the borehole as the tool is pulled uphole. The centralizing arms 36 may be equipped with sensor pads that are maintained in close contact with the borehole wall to gather logging data. A logging facility 44 collects measurements from the logging tool 34, and includes computing facilities for processing and storing the measurements gathered by the logging tool.<br>
Fig. 3 shows an illustrative electromagnetic resistivity logging tool 26. Logging tool 26 is shown as a drill collar having stabilizer fins 302 and 304. The stabilizer fins may cooperate with additional stabilizer fins to keep the tool centered in the borehole. Each of the stabilizer fins has a surface 305 for contacting the wall of the borehole. Although this contact surface is not necessarily always in contact with the borehole wall, the separation is usually less than 2 inches. Thus, sensors embedded in surface 305 will be maintained in close proximity to the borehole wall. Illustrative logging tool 26 includes a pair of receiver antennas 306 and a transmitter antenna 308 embedded on the contact surface of at least one stabilizer fin, and preferably embedded on the contact surface of each stabilizer fin. In the illustrative tool, the antennas occupy no more than 20% of the circumference (72 degrees of arc) and preferably less than about 10% (36 degrees of arc).<br>
As the borehole is extended during the drilling process, logging tool 26 progresses along the length of the borehole, rotating as it goes. Transmitter antenna 308 periodically transmits an electromagnetic signal into the formation. Receiver antennas 306 each receive a response signal from the formation. The<br>
receiver electronics measure the attenuation (amplitude ratio) and the phase shift of the receive signals between the receiver antennas, or alternatively the attenuation and phase shift with respect to the transmit signal. In either case, the attenuation and/or the phase shift may be used to estimate formation resistivity at the midpoint between the receiver antennas 306 or at the midpoint between a transmitter antenna and a receiver antenna. In logging tool embodiments having multiple transmitter antennas, the transmitter antennas may be fired sequentially. As an alternative multiple transmitter antennas may be fired simultaneously ,with each transmitter having its own transmit signal frequency.<br>
Fig. 4A shows an illustrative transmitter antenna 308 embedded in a contact surface 305. A first recess 402 may be provided for a protective cover, and within recess 402 a second recess may be placed to contain transmitter antenna 308. To enable transmission of electromagnetic signals, the protective cover may be an insulating, non-magnetic material, such as PEEK (polyetheretherketone), or it may include slots or apertures that pass such signals. The cover may be secured in place by screws or other means.<br>
As shown in the cross sectional view in Fig. 4B, the illustrated transmitter antenna 308 is a pot-core antenna. That is, transmitter antenna 308 includes a wire coil 408 wound on a bobbin 406 and positioned in a ferrite half-torus 404. Bobbin 406 preferabl/ consists of an insulating, non-magnetic material. An insulating, non-magnetic potting material may fill the remaining space in the half torus 404 and secure the winding and bobbin in place. In the prototype embodiment, the half-torus is half of a Ferroxcube 42 x 26 Pot Core of "3F3" material. The winding is 11 turns of 24 gauge HML (Heavy Polyimide Enamel) magnet wire. The inductance was measured at 13.5 MH, with a complex impedance of Z=3.4+jl69Ω at 2MHz. When an alternating current is applied to the wire coil, an alternating magnetic field is projected into the formation.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a pair of illustrative receiver antennas 306 embedded in a contact surface 305. As with the transmitter antenna, a first recess 502 may be provided for a protective cover that enables passage of electromagnetic signals. Within the first recess 502 are deeper recesses 504 for containing receiver antennas 306. The illustrated receiver antennas 306 are ferrite rod antennas. That is, each receiver antenna 306 includes a wire coil 510 wound on a ferrite rod 508. The ferrite rod 508 may be secured within recesses 504 by support blocks 506, which may be an insulating non-magnetic material such as PEEK. In the prototype embodiment, the ferrite rods are about 1.3 inches in length and about 0.25 inches in diameter. The material is "Fair-Rite 61". For the receiver antennas, the winding is 20 turns of 24 gauge HML magnet wire. In a second prototype embodiment, a ferrite rod antenna with 15 turns was used as a transmitter antenna. The ferrite rod antenna is oriented with its axis parallel to the tool axis, and transmits or receives alternating magnetic fields oriented parallel to the tool axis, with particular sensitivity in the azimuthal direction of the surface in which the antenna is embedded.<br>
Fig. 7 shows an illustrative resistivity imaging method. In block 702, the resistivity imaging tool is placed in a borehole. For LWD, the too! is part of the bottom hole assembly to perform logging as drilling operations are performed. For wireline logging, the tool is part of a sonde that is lowered to the bottom of the region of interest to perform logging as the logging tool is pulled uphole at a steady rate.<br>
In block 704, the tool is placed in logging mode. For LWD, this operation may (or may not) involve deploying a de-centralizer that forces sensors in the tool body against the borehole wall. Alternatively, the LWD resistivity imaging tool may have one or more extension mechanisms or stabilizer fins that place sensors in contact or close proximity to the borehole wall. For wireline logging, multiple centralizer arms maintain sensor pads in contact with the borehole wall.Blocks 706-714 represent operations that occur during the logging process. Though shown and described in a sequential fashion, the various operations may occur concurrently, and moreover, they may simultaneously occur for different transmitter antennas.<br>
In block 706, the tool transmits an electromagnetic signal from one or each of the transmitter antennas and measures the phase and attenuation of electromagnetic signals received by the receiver antennas. In block 708, the tool determines a resistivity measurement in response to each transmitted signal, e.g., by performing a table look-up for the measured attenuation and phase shift. In block 710, the tool, or more likely, the surface logging facility coupled to the tool, associates the compensated resistivity measurements with a tool position and orientation measurement, thereby enabling a determination of image pixel values for imaging the rock formation surrounding the borehole.<br>
In block 712, the tool moves along the borehole, and in block 714, a check is performed to determine whether logging operations should continue (e.g., whether the logging tool has reached the end of the region of interest). For continued logging operations, blocks 706-714 are repeated. Once logging operations are complete (or in some embodiments, while the logging operations are ongoing), the surface logging facility maps the resistivity measurements into borehole wall image pixels and displays the resulting resistivity image of the surrounding formations in block 716.<br>
Fig. 6 shows an illustrative test environment in which a 6-foot diameter tank 602 contains a synthetic formation having a dipping thin bed 604 sandwiched between two thick beds 606 and 608. The thick beds consisted of mixtures of silica sand and Portland cement, while the dipping bed consisted of a mixture of gel and cement. The formation is about 2 foot in diameter, with a 8.5 inch borehole. The upper bed is about 3.5 feet thick, the dipping bed is about 0.5 feet<br>
thick, and the lower bed is about 4.5 feet thick. To simulate water-based muds, the tank was filled with water having a resistivity of about 15 Ω-m, and to simulate oil-based muds, the experiment was repeated without water (air-filled borehole).<br>
A prototype 610 was repeatedly passed along the borehole with different offsets, sensor orientations, borehole fluids, and antenna configurations. Offsets varied between 0" (tool contacts the borehole wall) and 1.5". The sensors were alternatively oriented to the north, east, south, and west for comparative measurements. The borehole fluids were water or air. Both pot core antennas and ferrite rod antennas were tested as transmitter antennas in combination with both types of antennas as receiver antennas. The receiver antenna spacing was 4" from center to center, and the center of the receiver pair was spaced 8" from the transmitter antenna. Transmit signal frequencies of 2MHz and 8MHz were tested.<br>
Figs. 8-13 show measurement results	for the various test conditions. The test<br>
parameters for Fig. 8 are as follows:<br>
Tx antenna: ferrite rod	Tx frequency: 2MHz<br>
Rx antenna: ferrite rod	BH fluid: water<br>
Fig. 8 compares the phase shift measurements at different azimuthal orientations of the sensor. In the graphs for each of the north, east, south, and west orientations, the presence of the dipping bed is clearly indicated by the dip in phase shift measurements at differing positions for the different orientations. Also apparent are the differing resistivities of the thick beds. Further analysis is desirable to determine the spatial resolution and resistivity measurement sensitivity, but it is apparent that in water-based fluids, the ferrite-rod to ferrite-rod antenna measurements have sufficient spatial resolution to permit borehole wall imaging and fonrntion dip measurements.<br>
The test parameters for Fig. 9 are as follows:<br>
Tx antenna: ferrite rod      Tx frequency: 8MHz Rx antenna: ferrite rod      BH fluid: water<br>
Fig. 9 compares the phase shift measurements at different offsets from the borehole wall. The graphs for 0" offset and 1.5" offset each show the same shape, though the 1.5" offset curve exhibits slightly reduced phase shifts as compared to the 0" offset curve. Further analysis is desirable to fully characterize offset sensitivity, but it is apparent that this tool configuration is relatively insensitive to offset.<br>
The test parameters for Fig. 10 are as follows:<br>
Tx antenna: ferrite rod      Tx frequency: 2MHz Rx antenna: ferrite rod      BH fluid: air<br>
Fig. 10 demonstrates the phase shift measurements of the tool in a non-conductive borehole fluid. Though the shape of the response curve is different, the sensitivity of the tool to the dipping bed is clearly apparent. Thus even in a non-conductive borehole fluid, the ferrite-rod to ferrite-rod antenna measurements will enable resistivity measurements and detection of thin dipping beds.<br>
The test parameters for Fig. 11 are as follows:<br>
Tx antenna: pot core	Tx frequency: 2MHz<br>
Rx antenna: ferrite rod      BH fluid: water<br>
Fig. 11 compares the phase shift measurements at different azimuthal orientations of the sensor. In the graphs for each of the north, east, south, and<br>
west orientations, the presence of the dipping bed is clearly indicated by the dip in phase shift measurements at differing positions for the different orientation. Further analysis is desirable to determine the spatial resolution and resistivity measurement sensitivity, but it is apparent that in water-based fluids, the pot-core to ferrite-rod antenna measurements have sufficient spatial resolution to permit borehole wall imaging and formation dip measurements.<br>
The test parameters for Figs. 12 and 13 are as follows:<br>
Tx antenna: pot core	Tx frequency: 2MHz<br>
Rx antenna: ferrite rod      Standoff: 0"<br>
Fig. 12 compares phase shift measurements between different borehole fluids. (Note that the phase-snift curve for air has been shifted upward by 2 degrees as indicated by the y-axis coordinates on the right side of the figure.) In the graphs for both water and air, the presence of the dipping bed is clearly evident. Thus the pot-core to ferrite-rod antenna configuration will operate in both conductive and non-conductive borehole fluids. Fig. 13 shows an approximate resistivity determination based on the phase measurements in Fig. 12. The resistivity determination is based on an existing dipole model, and hence it does not account for the sped ic radiation patterns or tool calibration parameters. In practice, a more refined model would be employed. Nevertheless, the dipping bed appears in both curves. With further refinement of the models, the disclosed tool configuration should be suitable for resistivity logging in borehole fluids of any type. The model is expected to vary based on fluid resistivity, and hence the borehole fluid resistivity may be included as a model parameter to be measured independently or solved by inversion.<br>
It is noted that due to the principle of reciprocity, the measurements made by the pot-core transmitter to ferrite-rod receiver antennas can also be made by <br>
ferrite-rod transmitter to pot-core receiver antennas. The azimuthal sensitivity of this tool enables measurements to be made in different azimuthal directions, potentially yielding enough information to enable measurement of resistive anisotropy and formation dip.<br>
Numerous variations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art once the above disclosure is fully appreciated. For example, the foregoing disclosure describes numerous antenna configurations in the context of a logging while drilling tool, such antenna configurations can also be readily applied to wireline logging tools. In addition, it is noted that the transmitter antennas may transmit very short (high bandwidth) pulses as an alternative to sinusoidal (narrow bandwidth) Signals. Furthermore, the principle of reciprocity can be applied to obtain equivalent measurements while exchanging transmitter and receiver roles for each antenna. It is intended that the following claims be interpreted to embrace all such variations and modifications.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
