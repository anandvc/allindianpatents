				<td>A Connector, A Connector Testing Apparatus And Method<br>
The present invention relates to a connector, a connector testing apparatus for conducting an electrical connection test for one or more terminal fittings at least partly accommodated in the connector and a connector testing method.<br>
Generally, a connector housing is formed with cavities penetrating the connector housing in forward and backward directions, and female terminal fittings are inserted into these cavities. The female terminal fittings are retained by locking portions formed at inner walls of the cavities upon being properly inserted into the cavities and, in this state, are connected with tabs of male terminal fittings inserted through openings formed in the front surface of the housing. A connector of this type is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. H05-182712.<br>
The front surface of the housing of this type is formed not only with openings for permitting the insertion of the tabs, but also with mold-removal holes formed as the locking portions are formed. Thus, the tabs of the male terminal fittings may erroneously enter the mold-removal holes upon connecting two connectors.<br>
In order to avoid such a situation, it may be thought to mount a front wall member formed with tab insertion holes on the front surface of the housing and to securely bring the leading ends of the tabs to the female terminal fittings through the tab insertion holes. In such a case, the front wall member is fitted from below into a mounting frame provided on the front surface of the housing. Upon detaching the front wall member, there is a method according to which a jig is slid along a slanted guiding surface formed at the bottom surface of the housing to hook the leading end of the jig onto the front wall member and is then forcibly maneuvered to pull the front wall member downward. However, it is difficult and hard to detach the front wall member according to such a method. Therefore, there is a demand for a further improvement.<br>
The present invention was developed in view of the above problem and an object thereof is to improve operability upon detaching a front wall member.<br>
This object is solved according to the invention by the features of the independent claims. Preferred embodiments of the invention are subject of the dependent claims.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a connector in which a housing is formed with at least one cavity into which at least one terminal fitting is at least partly insertable,<br>
a locking portion is formed at an inner wall of the cavity in the housing to retain the terminal fitting, and<br>
a tab can be at least partly inserted into the cavity from front, thereby being connected with the terminal fitting at least partly inserted in the cavity,<br>
a front wall member formed with at least one tab insertion hole that can substantially communicate with the cavity is mountable on the front surface of the housing,<br>
an operable surface used to detach or move the front wall member is exposed on an end surface of the front wall member.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the front wall member is shifted from a mounted state to an unmounted state and/or fully removed substantially along the front surface of the housing.<br>
The front wall member formed with the tab insertion hole that can communicate with the cavity is mounted on the front surface of the housing, and the tab is inserted through the tab insertion hole in this mounted state to be connected with the terminal fitting. Upon detaching the front wall member, it is sufficient to operate or push the operable surface exposed at the end surface of the front wall member to shift the front wall member away from the mounted state, preferably from the mounted state to the unmounted state and/or to fully remove it. Thus, operability is better. It should be noted that the mounted state is a state where the tab and the terminal fitting can be connected by at least partly inserting the tab through the tab insertion hole and the unmounted state is a state where the tab and the terminal fitting cannot be connected even if the tab is at least partly inserted through the tab insertion hole.<br>
According to a preferred further embodiment of the invention, there is provided a connector in which a housing is formed with a cavity into which a terminal fitting is insertable, a locking portion is formed at an inner wall of the cavity in the housing to retain the terminal fitting, and a tab is inserted into the<br>
cavity from front, thereby being connected with the terminal fitting inserted in the cavity, characterized in that a front wall member formed with a tab insertion hole that can communicate with the cavity is mountable on the front surface of the housing, an operable surface used to detach the front wall member is exposed on an end surface of the front wall member and the front wall member is shifted from a mounted state to an unmounted state along the front surface of the housing.<br>
Preferably , at least one eave or ledge portion that can be held substantially in contact with one or more portions of the end surface of the front wall member other than the operable surface when the front wall member reaches the mounted state is provided on the front surface of the housing.<br>
Since the eave or ledge portion that can be held in contact with the one or more, preferably substantially all portions of the end surface of the front wall member other than the operable surface is provided on the front surface of the housing, the front wall member can be securely kept in the mounted state even if the operable surface is exposed.<br>
Further preferably, the front wall member has an identifying construction for identifying the orientation of the front wall member along vertical and/or transverse directions by the asymmetry of the outer shape thereof.<br>
Since the front wall member has the identifying construction for identifying the orientation of the front wall member along vertical and/or transverse directions, an automatic machine can discriminate the orientation along vertical and transverse directions of the front wall member, for example,<br>
in the case where the front wall member is assembled by the automatic machine.<br>
Still further preferably, the front wall member has at least one jig insertion hole through which a detecting pin for an electrical connection test is at least partly insertable and is movable between a second position where the tab insertion hole substantially communicates with the cavity and a first position where the tab insertion hole is displaced from the cavity, and<br>
the tab preferably can come into contact with a contact point of the terminal fitting through the tab insertion hole with the front wall member positioned at the second position and/or the detecting pin preferably can come into contact with a detecting portion of the terminal fitting through the jig insertion hole with the front wall member positioned at the first position.<br>
Most preferably, the front wall member has a jig insertion hole through which a detecting pin for an electrical connection test is insertable and is movable between a full locking position where the tab insertion hole communicates with the cavity and a partial locking position where the tab insertion hole is displaced from the cavity, and<br>
the tab can come into contact with a contact point of the terminal fitting through the tab insertion hole with the front wall member held at the full locking position while the pin can come into contact with a detecting portion of the terminal fitting through the jig insertion hole with the front wall member held at the partial locking position.<br>
The front wall member is formed with the tab insertion hole and the jig insertion hole and movable between the full locking position and the partial<br>
locking position, wherein the tab can come into contact with the contact point of the terminal fitting through the tab insertion hole with the front wall member held at the full locking position and the detecting pin can come into contact with the detecting portion of the terminal fitting through the jig insertion hole. Thus, both the tab and the detecting pin can be precisely guided to the contact point and the detecting portion of the terminal fitting, thereby improving contact reliability.<br>
According to the invention, there is further provided a connector testing apparatus for conducting an electrical connection test for the terminal fitting at least partly accommodated in the connector according to the invention or a preferred embodiment thereof, comprising:<br>
a holder in which the connector is to be at least partly set,<br>
a detecting unit including at least one detecting pin and relatively movable toward and away from the holder, wherein the holder and the detecting unit are brought closer to each other with the connector at least partly set in the holder, whereby the detecting pin at least partly enters the jig insertion hole to enable the electrical connection test, and the holder and the detecting unit can be separated from each other after the test to enable the connector to be taken out, and<br>
pushing means for pushing the operable surface of the connector at least partly set in the holder to push the front wall member from the second position to the first position as the holder and the detecting unit are brought closer to each other, wherein the detecting pin at least partly enters the jig insertion hole after the front wall member is pushed substantially to the first position by the pushing means.<br>
As the holder and the detecting unit are brought or bringable closer to each other with the connector at least partly set in the holder, the front wall member is or can be pushed from the second position to the first position by the pushing means. Thereafter, the detecting pin is caused to at least partly enter the jig insertion hole and brought substantially into contact with the detecting portion of the terminal fitting by bringing the holder and the detecting unit further closer. Accordingly, the front wall member can be moved from the second position to the first position during a series of operations of bringing the holder and the detecting unit closer. Therefore, it is not necessary to separately perform an operation of pushing the front wall member to the first position, thereby improving operation efficiency.<br>
According to a preferred further embodiment of the invention, there is provided a connector testing apparatus for conducting an electrical connection test for the terminal fitting accommodated in the connector according to the invention or a preferred embodiment thereof, comprising:<br>
a holder in which the connector is to be set,<br>
a detecting unit including a detecting pin and relatively movable toward and away from the holder, wherein the holder and the detecting unit are brought closer to each other with the connector set in the holder, whereby the detecting pin enters the jig insertion hole to enable the electrical connection test, and the holder and the detecting unit are separated from each other after the test to enable the connector to be taken out, and<br>
pushing means for pushing the operable surface of the connector set in the holder to push the front wall member from the full locking position to the<br>
partial locking position as the holder and the detecting unit are brought closer to each other, wherein the detecting pin enters the jig insertion hole after the front wall member is pushed to the partial locking position by the pushing means.<br>
As the holder and the detecting unit are brought closer to each other with the connector set in the holder, the front wall member is pushed from the full locking position to the partial locking position by the pushing means. Thereafter, the detecting pin is caused to enter the jig insertion hole and brought into contact with the detecting portion of the terminal fitting by bringing the holder and the detecting unit further closer. Accordingly, the front wall member can be moved from the full locking position to the partial locking position during a series of operations of bringing the holder and the detecting unit closer. Therefore, it is not necessary to separately perform an operation of pushing the front wall member to the partial locking position, thereby improving operation efficiency.<br>
Preferably, there is further provided pushing-back mean for pushing the front wall member from the first position (partial locking position) back towards or substantially to the second position (full locking position) as the holder and the detecting unit are separated from each other,<br>
As the holder and the detecting unit are separated from each other after the test, the front wall member is pushed from the first position (partial locking position) back towards or substantially to the second position (full locking position) by the pushing-back means. Therefore, it is not necessary to separately perform an operation of pushing the front wall member back towards<br>
or substantially to the second position (full locking position), thereby further improving operation efficiency.<br>
Further preferably, the pushing-back means includes a first cam surface provided in the detecting unit, and the front wall member is moved along the first cam surface to be pushed from the first position (partial locking position) towards or substantially back to the second position (full locking position).<br>
Since the front wall member can be pushed by being moved along the first cam surface, the construction of the pushing-back means can be simplified.<br>
Most preferably, the pushing means includes a second cam surface provided in the detecting unit and/or a pushing member provided in or at the holder, and the pushing member is moved along the second cam surface to push the operable surface, thereby pushing the front wall member from the second position (full locking position) towards or substantially to the first position (partial locking position).<br>
Since the front wall member can be pushed by the pushing member moving along the second cam surface, the construction of the pushing means can be simplified.<br>
According to the invention, there is further provided a connector testing method for a connector, in particular according to the invention or a preferred embodiment thereof, in which a front wall member is so provided on the front surface of a connector housing formed with at least one cavity for at least partly accommodating a terminal fitting as to be movable between a first position and a second position substantially along the front surface along a direction intersecting with an inserting direction of the terminal fitting, wherein the front<br>
wall member is formed with at least one jig insertion hole through which at least one detecting pin for an electrical connection test is at least partly insertable, and is movably positioned on the housing between<br>
the second position where the tab insertion hole substantially<br>
communicates with the cavity and a tab can be brought into contact with<br>
a contact point of the terminal fitting through the tab insertion hole and the first position where the tab insertion hole is displaced from or<br>
offset with respect to the cavity and the detecting pin can be brought into<br>
contact with a detecting portion of the terminal fitting through the jig<br>
insertion hole,<br>
wherein the method comprises the following steps:<br>
at least partly setting the connector in a holder of a testing apparatus with the front wall member positioned at the second position,<br>
moving the front wall member from the second position to the first position with the connector held at least partly in the holder,<br>
at least partly inserting the detecting pin into the connector housing through the jig insertion hole to conduct an electrical connection test.<br>
Since the front wall member is moved from the full locking position to the partial locking position in the holder to conduct the test, a process prior to the testing step can be simplified.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, there is further provided a connector testing method for a connector, in particular according to the invention or a preferred embodiment thereof, in which a front wall member is so provided on the front surface of a connector housing formed with a cavity<br>
for accommodating a terminal fitting as to be movable between a partial locking position and a full locking position along the front surface along a direction intersecting with an inserting direction of the terminal fitting, is formed with a jig insertion hole through which a detecting pin for an electrical connection test is insertable, and is movably held on the housing between the full locking position where the tab insertion hole communicates with the cavity and a tab can be brought into contact with a contact point of the terminal fitting through the tab insertion hole and the partial locking position where the tab insertion hole is displaced from the cavity and the detecting pin can be brought into contact with a detecting portion of the terminal fitting through the jig insertion hole,<br>
characterized in that, after the connector is set in a holder of a testing apparatus with the front wall member held at the full locking position, the front wall member is moved from the full locking position to the partial locking position with the connector held in the holder, whereby the detecting pin is inserted into the connector housing through the jig insertion hole to conduct an electrical connection test.<br>
Preferably, the front wall member is moved from the first position (partial locking position) back towards or substantially to the second position (full locking position) while the detecting pin is retracted through the jig insertion hole after the electrical connection test with the connector at least partly held or located in the holder.<br>
Since the front wall member is moved back to the full locking position again after the test is completed in the holder, a process after the test can be simplified.<br>
Most preferably, the front wall member is moved from the second position (full locking position) towards or substantially to the first position (partial locking position) as the detecting pin is brought closer to the connector housing or is moved back again substantially to the second position (full locking position) as the detecting pin is retracted.<br>
Movements of the front wall member between the first position (partial locking position) and the second position (full locking position) are linked with the forward and backward movements of the detecting pin, operation efficiency can be further improved.<br>

A first preferred embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 13. A connector F of this embodiment is provided with a female connector housing (hereinafter, ,,female housing 10") connectable with a male connector housing (not shown), and a front wall member 50 is to be mounted on or to or at the front surface of the female housing 10. In the following description, a side to be connected with the male connector housing is referred to as front side.<br>
The female housing 10 is made e.g. of a synthetic resin substantially into a block preferably having a laterally long cross section, The female housing 10 is internally formed with one or more, preferably a plurality of cavities 11 at one or more stages, preferably at each of two (upper and lower) stages, the cavities penetrating the female housing 10 in forward and backward directions FBD. One or more female terminal fittings 40 can be at least partly accommodated<br>
into the cavities 11 from an inserting side, preferably substantially from behind, as shown in FIG. 6, and one or more front openings of the cavities 11 permit the passage of one or more respective tabs 70 of male terminal fittings at least partly accommodated in the male connector housing.<br>
Each female terminal fitting 40 is an integral or unitary assembly of a main portion 41, a wire connection portion (preferably comprising a wire barrel 42 and/or an insulation barrel 43) located behind the main portion 41 to be connected (preferably crimped or bent or folded into connection) with a wire W. The main portion 41 preferably is substantially formed into a box (preferably having a substantially rectangular cross section) by bending, folding and/or shaping an electrically conductive (preferably metal) sheet in width direction. One or more, preferably a pair of (front and rear) stabilizers 44 project from one end of the main portion 41. The stabilizer(s) 44 can be held substantially in sliding contact with an escaping groove (not shown) formed at each cavity, preferably substantially along one comer of the upper surface of each cavity 11, and function to prevent an improperly oriented (e.g. upside-down) insertion of the female terminal fitting 40 because of an unmatched positional relationship of the stabilizer(s) 44 and the escaping groove when the female terminal fitting 40 is inserted improperly oriented (e.g. upside down).<br>
A (preferably substantially cantilever-shaped) resilient contact piece 45 folded backward or bent at or close to the front edge of the main portion 41 is at least partly arranged in or at the main portion 41. The resilient contact piece 45 has an angled side view and is resiliently deformable substantially upward and downward or in a direction intersecting an intersecting direction of the mating<br>
tab 70intothe main portion 41. A contact point 45A with the mating tab 70 projects at the tip of the resilient contact piece 45 to resiliency squeeze or sandwich or contact the tab 70 in cooperation with a receiving portion 41F facing the contact point 45A.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the front opening of each main portion 41 is formed by or comprises a tab insertion opening 41G (substantially corresponding to a position right above the base end of the resilient contact piece 45) at a position deviated from a widthwise center toward one side, and the remaining opening at the other side is at least partly closed by a detecting plate 46. The detecting plate 46 preferably substantially has a vertical long rectangular front view and is formed by bending a forward projecting portion of the main portion 41 substantially inward at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially at right angle. When the female terminal fitting 40 is viewed from front, the base end of the resilient contact piece 45 is located substantially adjacent to the detecting plate 46. Upon conducting an electrical connection test, the leading end of a detection probe 60 is or can be brought into contact preferably with the detecting plate 46.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, a locking portion 12 preferably is integrally or unitarily formed at a lateral surface (e.g. at the upper surface) of each cavity 11 of the female housing 10. The locking portion 12 preferably substantially cantilevers forward with its portion connected with the upper surface of the cavity 11 as a base end and is resiliency deformable substantially upward and downward or in a direction intersecting an insertion direction of the terminal fitting into the cavity 11. A locking projection 12A projecting substantially toward<br>
the cavity 11 is formed at the free end of the locking portion 12. A deformation space 13 is defined above or outside of the locking portion 12 (a side thereof substantially opposite to a terminal fitting arranging space). A mold-removal hole 14 left in the front surface of the female housing 10 as the locking portion 12 is formed is present before the locking portion 12 including the deformation space 13, and substantially communicates with the cavity 11. The locking portion 12 comes to interfere with the female terminal fitting 40 during the insertion of the female terminal fitting 40 into the cavity 11, thereby being pushed up or laterally or deformed toward the deformation space 13, When the female terminal fitting 40 is substantially properly inserted, the locking portion 12 is resiliency at least partly restored to engage the locking projection 12a with a portion of the main portion 41, preferably with a locking hole 47 formed in the ceiling plate 41 a, thereby retaining the female terminal fitting 40.<br>
A lock arm 15 is formed substantially at a widthwise intermediate position (preferably substantially at the widthwise center) of the lateral (upper) surface of the female housing 10. The lock arm 15 preferably substantially cantilevers backward (or along the forward and backward directions FBD) with the base end thereof supported on the front end of the lateral (upper) surface of the female housing 10, and an operable portion 15A is provided at or close to the free end thereof. A lock projection 15B is formed at a longitudinal intermediate position (preferably a substantially longitudinal middle position) of the lateral (upper) surface of the lock arm 15. The lock projection 15B is resiliently engaged or engageable with the male connector housing as the lock<br>
rm 15 is resiliency deformed, thereby inseparably holding the two housings connected.<br>
The lock arm 15 has the lower or inner surface (surface substantially facing the lateral (upper) surface of the female housing 10) thereof chamfered in an area preferably substantially behind the substantially longitudinal middle position, thereby forming a slanted surface 15E. A rear area of the lateral (upper) surface of the female housing 10 substantially facing or corresponding to this slanted surface 15E is slightly lowered or recessed as compared to a front area, so that a sufficient deformation space for the lock arm 15 can be ensured between the rear area of the lock arm 15 and the rear area of the lateral (upper) surface of the female housing 10. Inside the front area of the lateral (upper) surface of the female housing 10 are formed the one or more deformation spaces 13 for the locking portions 12, whereby the height of the female housing 10 is reduced as a whole.<br>
A turning preventing wall 16 at least partly surrounding the operable portion 15A of the lock arm 15 stands on or projects from the lateral (upper) surface of the female housing 10 as shown in FIG. 1. The turning preventing wall 16 preferably is substantially bridge- or gate-shaped as a whole by a pair of leg portions 16A connected with the opposite ends of the lateral (upper) surface of the female housing 10 and a ceiling or top portion 16B spanning between the leg portions 16A, and the operable portion 15A is at least partly arranged inside the turning preventing wall 16. Such a turning preventing wall 16 can prevent the lock arm 15 from getting caught by an external matter such as by the wire W to be turned up or deflected. The ceiling portion 16B of the turning<br>
preventing wall 16 is notched or recessed to form a finger or operating hole 16E enabling the lock arm 15 to be operated, e.g. by finger pushing the operable portion 15A.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, a retainer mount hole 17 used to at least partly mount a retainer 90 is formed in the lateral (bottom) surface of the female housing 10. The retainer mount hole 17 is formed in one or more surfaces, preferably in up to three surfaces of the female housing 10 to extend from the lateral (bottom) surface to the (preferably substantially opposite) adjacent side surface(s), wherefore the retainer mount hole 17 is open at one or more sides, preferably at three sides. The retainer mount hole 17 has such a depth as to communicate with or intersect the respective cavities 11, thereby dividing the cavities 11 at one or more stages, preferably at the two (upper and lower) stages into front and rear parts.<br>
The retainer 90 is made e.g. of a synthetic resin material similar to the female housing 10, and is movable between a partial locking position (first position) where the retainer 90 is lightly fitted into the retainer mount hole 17 to permit the insertion and withdrawal of the female terminal fittings 40 and a full locking position (second position) which is reached by (preferably obliquely) pushing the retainer 90 (preferably substantially forward) and where the retainer 90 is engageable with (preferably the rear edges of) the main portions 41 of the female terminal fittings 40.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the mounting frame 27 is formed on or at the front surface of the female housing 10 by one or more side walls 25 and/or a lateral (upper) wall 26. The front wall member 50 is made e.g. of a synthetic resin into<br>
a substantially flat plate, and is to be inserted or arranged in a mounting direction MD, preferably substantially laterally or from below (or in a direction at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially normal to the forward and backward directions FBD) at least partly into the mounting frame 27 and/or substantially along the front surface of the female housing 10. It should be noted that the lateral (upper) wall 26 of the mounting frame 27 corresponds to a preferred eave or ledge or projecting or gutter portion and preferably is divided into a left and a right parts by a guide groove 36 (not shown).<br>
The front wall member 50 is formed with one or more tab insertion holes 51, preferably as many tab insertion holes 51 as the respective cavities 11, wherein the tab insertion holes 51 can substantially communicate with the corresponding cavities 11 and are arranged along width direction at one or more stages, preferably at two (upper and lower) stages. The front wall member 50 is also formed with one or more jig insertion holes 52 that can substantially communicate with the mold-removal holes 14 left as the locking portions 12 are formed. The jig insertion holes 52 are arranged at one or more stages, preferably at two (upper and lower) stages and have an offset positional relationship with the respective tab insertion holes 51. The jig insertion hole 52 at one end (left end in FIG. 1) of the upper stage makes an opening in the upper end of a main body 50A in the form of a rectangular flat plate.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, one or more, preferably a plurality of vertical ribs 53 that substantially can be connected or aligned with partition walls (not shown) partitioning the cavities 11 in the female housing 10 are formed preferably substantially side by side on the rear surface of the front wall member 50<br>
(surface of the front wall member 50 substantially facing the female housing 10 when mounted thereon). A base portion 54 bulges out backward from the bottom end of the rear surface of the front wall member 50, and the base ends of the vertical ribs 53 are coupled to the upper surface of this base portion 54.<br>
One or more, preferably a pair of first latching portions 55 are formed at the (preferably substantially opposite) side edge(s) of the front wall member 50 preferably at the substantially same height, and/or one or more, preferably a pair of second latching portions 56 are formed above and/or at a specified (predetermined or predeterminable) distance to the first latching portions 55. The first and second latching portions 55, 56 preferably are connected with the vertical ribs 53 provided on the opposite lateral end surfaces of the front wall member 50, and/or have the substantially same thickness as the vertical ribs 53. The first and second latching portions 55. 56 preferably have an identical shape and/or an identical size, wherein the upper surfaces thereof are slanted surfaces 57 inclined downward toward the projecting ends and the lower surfaces thereof are slanted surfaces 58 inclined upward toward the projecting ends.<br>
On the other hand, as shown in FIG. 2, one or more, preferably a pair of first receiving portions 31 are formed on the (preferably substantially opposite) side wall(s) 25 of the mounting frame 27 preferably at the substantially same height, and/or one or more, preferably a pair of second receiving portions 32 are formed (preferably at the substantially same height) above and/or at a specified (predetermined or predeterminable) distance from the first receiving portions 31. The first and second receiving portions 31, 32 preferably are such<br>
rectangular holes of an identical shape and an identical size that penetrate the side walls 25 in thickness direction and can at least partly receive the respective first and second latching portions 55, 56. Front parts of the first and second receiving portions 31, 32 are partitioned by disengagement preventing walls 33 formed by thinning the outer surfaces of the side walls 25, lest the mounted front wall member 50 should come off forward.<br>
The front wall member 50 is held or positioned at the partial locking position (as a preferred first position) 1P by resiliency fitting the second latching portions 56 at least partly Into the first receiving portions 31 as shown in FIG. 2 while being held or positioned at the full locking position (as a preferred second position) 2P by resiliently fitting the second latching portions 56 at least partly into the second receiving portions 32 and/or the first latching portions 55 at least partly into the first receiving portions 31 as shown in FIG. 1. As a result, the front wall member 50 is movable substantially upward and downward or along the mounting direction MD (directions at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially normal to a connecting direction of the two housings and/or to the forward and backward directions FBD) between the partial locking position (first position) 1P and the full locking position (second position) 2P. In the process of moving the front wall member 50 from the partial locking position 1P (first position) to the full locking position 2P (second position), the second latching portions 56 preferably move over partition walls 34 between the first and second receiving portions 31, 32 while resiliently pushing the partial walls 34 outward and the first latching portions 55 preferably move over end walls 35 located below the first receiving portions 31 while<br>
pushing the end walls 35 outward. In this case, the first and/or second latching portions 55, 56 preferably can smoothly move over the partition walls 34 and the end walls 35 by bringing the slanted surfaces 57 as the upper surfaces of the first and second latching portions 55, 56 substantially into sliding contact with the lower surfaces of the partition walls 34 and the end walls 35.<br>
When the front wall member 50 reaches the full locking position 2P (second position), the front surface of the front wall member 50 is preferably substantially continuous and/or in flush with the front surface of the mounting frame 27 and/or the bottom end surface of the front wall member 50 preferably substantially is substantially continuous and/or in flush with the bottom surface of the female housing 10. Further, when the front wall member 50 reaches the full locking position, the tab insertion holes 51 come to substantially communicate with the one or more cavities 11 and/or the one or more jig insertion holes 52 come to substantially communicate with the mold-removal holes 14. Accordingly, if the tabs 70 are at least partly inserted into the tab insertion holes 51 in this state, the leading end of the tabs 70 are at least partly inserted through the tab insertion holes 51 into the main portions 41 of the female terminal fittings 40 at least partly inserted in the cavities 11 and come substantially into contact with the resilient contact pieces 45 provided at or at least partly in the main portions 41 to establish electrical connections therebetween. If an unlocking jig (not shown) for disengaging the locking portion is or can be at least partly inserted through the jig insertion hole 52 from front, the leading end of the jig enters the mold-removal hole 14 through the jig insertion hole 52 to come substantially into contact with the front surface of the<br>
locking projection 12A at the leading end of the locking portion 12, with the result that the focking portion 12 can be pushed up or laterally or deformed toward the deformation space 13 in unlocking direction.<br>
Contrary to this, when the front wall member 50 reaches or is positioned at the partial locking position 1P (first position), the tab insertion holes 51 are displaced or offset from the cavities 11 as shown in FIGS. 2 and 4, wherefore the tabs 70 cannot enter the main portions 41 of the female terminal fittings 40 even if being inserted into the displaced tab insertion holes 51. Further, the front lower parts of the detecting plates 46 of the female terminal fittings 40 come to substantially face the jig insertion holes 52. Thus, if the detection probes 60 are inserted into these jig insertion holes 52 from front as shown in FIG. 7, the leading ends thereof come into contact with the front lower parts of the detecting plates 46, and whether or not the female terminal fittings 40 are properly inserted in the cavities 11 can be detected preferably based on electrical connections between the detection probes 60 and the detecting plates 46. The construction of a testing apparatus 80 for conducting this test and a testing mechanism are described in detail later.<br>
Upon moving the front wall member 50 from the full locking position 2P (second position) to the partial locking position 1P (first position), a pushable portion 59 of the front wall member 50 is pushed or manipulated. This pushing portion 59 preferably is substantially rectangular in plan view and/or the opposite corner portions at the upper end thereof are substantially rounded. The pushable portion 59 is arranged at or projects from the lateral (upper) end surface (or forward or distal end surface as seen in the moving or mounting<br>
direction MD) of the main body 50A of the front wall member 50. As shown in FIG. 6, the rear surface of the pushable portion 59 preferably is formed to bulge out in such a manner as to be substantially in flush with the rear surface of the base portion 54 and/or the rear surfaces of the vertical ribs 53. One or more added portions SOB are provided at lateral sides of the bottom ends of the (preferably substantially opposite) sides of the pushable portion 59, and project from the lateral (upper) end surface of the main body 50A of the front wall member 50 by a distance shorter than the pushable portion 59. The lateral (upper) end surface of the pushable portion 59 functions as a pushable surface at the time of detaching the front wall member 50, and corresponds to a preferred operable surface 59A. The operable surface 59A preferably is a substantially flat surface and/or exposed without being covered by the mounting frame 27, and/or has a longer dimension along forward and backward directions FBD than the main body 50A of the front wall member 50.<br>
On the other hand, the guide groove 36 vertically penetrates the upper wall 26 at the front end of the base end of the lock arm 15. This guide groove or recess 36 is formed to have an opening width only slightly larger than the width of the pushable portion 59, and the pushable portion 59 is at least partly insertable into the guide groove 36 in the mounting direction MD or preferably from below. One or more receiving grooves 36A are so formed at lateral sides of the bottom ends of the opposite sides of the guide groove 36 as to communicate with the guide groove 36. The added portions 50B can at least partly enter the receiving grooves 50B.<br>
he pushable portion 59 is movable along the mounting direction MD and/or substantially along the front surface of the female housing 10 while being guided along the guide groove 36 and, in this respect, serves to guide the front wall member 50 moving between the partial locking position 1P (first position) and the full locking position 2P (second position). When the front wall member 50 is at the partial locking position 1P (first position), the operable surface 59A is located at or close to the entrance (bottom opening) of the guide groove 36 as shown in FIG. 2. When the front wall member 50 reaches the full locking position 2P (second position), the pushable portion 59 is at least partly, preferably substantially entirely fitted into the guide groove 36 and the operable surface 59A preferably is substantially continuous with the lateral (upper) surface of the upper wall 25 along width direction at the distal or lateral (upper) opening of the guide groove 36 as shown in FIG. 1. When the front wall member 50 reaches the full locking position 2P (second position), the main body 50A and the added portions 50B of the front wall member 50 are held substantially in contact with the upper wall 26 to hinder any further upward movement (or movement in the mounting direction MD) of the front wall member 50. If the operable surface 59A is pushed down (or in a direction substantially opposite to the mounting direction MD) in this state, the front wall member 50 starts moving from the full locking position 2P (second position) to the partial locking position 1P (first position). In this moving process, the slanted surfaces 58 at the lower surfaces of the first and/or second latching portions 55, 56 come substantially into sliding contact with the respective (upper) surfaces of the partition walls 34 and the end walls 35, wherefore the first and/or second<br>
latching portions 55, 56 can easily move over the partition walls 34 and the end walls 35.<br>
When the front wall member 50 is at the partial locking position 1P (first position), the insufficient insertions (insertion depths) of the female terminal fittings 40 and the presence or absence of the female terminal fittings 40 can be tested as described above. The testing apparatus 80 used for this test is provided with a holder 81 arranged at one side for holding the above connector F, and a detecting unit 82 arranged at the other side and substantially opposed to the holder 81.<br>
The detecting unit 82 is movable substantially forward and backward (or substantially towards and away from the holder 81 along a connecting direction CD) by a specified (predetermined or predeterminable) stroke with respect to the holder 81 by operating an operating lever (not shown). The detecting unit 82 is provided with one or more, preferably a plurality of detecting pins 60 at positions substantially corresponding to the jig insertion holes 52 of the front wall member 50 at the partial locking position 1P (first position). The respective detecting pins 60 can at least partly enter the corresponding cavities 11 through the jig insertion holes 52 to come into contact with the detecting plates 46 of the female terminal fittings 40 at least partly accommodated in the cavities 11 as the detecting unit 82 approaches the holder 81. The respective detecting pins 60 are connected via lead wires (not shown) with an electrical connection testing unit (not shown), which judges whether or not the detecting pins 60 are in contact with the female terminal fittings 40, thereby electrically detecting whether the female terminal fittings 40 are inserted to substantially proper<br>
depths and/or whether or not the female terminal fittings 40 are inserted and/or whether or not the female terminal fittings 40 are arranged or inserted in the proper pattern into the cavities 11. In this embodiment, the detecting pins 60 preferably come into contact with the detecting plates 46 of the female terminal fittings 40 without coming into contact with the resilient contact pieces 45. This can prevent the resilient contact pieces 45 from being buckled or plastically deformed, thereby ensuring contact reliability with the tabs 70.<br>
The holder 81 includes a supporting block 84 projecting forward from a substantially vertical back wall 83. This supporting block 84 is recessed to form a connector fixing portion 85, into which the connector F is at least partly fitted or inserted preferably substantially from below. A front wall part of the supporting block 84 before the connector fixing portion 85 is formed with jig introducing holes 86 at positions substantially corresponding to the respective female terminal fittings 40 at least partly inserted in the cavities 11. The jig introducing holes 86 are displaced from the jig insertion holes 52 when the front wall member 50 is at the full locking position 2P (second position) while being able to communicate with the jig insertion holes 52 when the front wall member 50 is at the partial locking position 1P (first position). A pushing member 87 that can push the operable surface 59A is arranged at a position of the holder 81 substantially corresponding to the operable surface 59A of the front wall member 50.<br>
The pushing member 87 is vertically displaceable (or displaceable substantially along a mounting direction MD of the front plate 50) between a standby position SP and a pushing position PP, and includes a block portion<br>
7A, a main pushing portion 87B projecting down or outwardly from the block portion 87A, and a spring portion 87E preferably at least partly surrounding the main pushing portion 87B. A flange portion 87F bulges out from the block portion 87A, and a slanted guiding surface 87G sloped up toward the back is formed at an upper part of the front surface of the block portion 87G.<br>
The supporting block 84 is formed with an accommodating recess 88 for at least partly accommodating the pushing member 87. The inner walls of the accommodating recess 88 in the holder 81 are comprised of a first stepped surface 88A that can be held substantially into contact with the upper surface of the flange portion 87F at the standby position SP, a second stepped surface 88B that can be held in contact with the lower surface of the flange portion 87F at the pushing position PP, and preferably a third stepped surface 88E that can hold the spring portion 87E in cooperation with the bottom surface of the block portion 87A. A guiding hole 89 through which the main pushing portion 87B can be introduced is so formed below the third stepped surface 88E as to communicate with the connector fixing portion 85. When the connector F is set in the connector fixing portion 85, the operable surface 59A of the front wall member 50 is located at a position substantially corresponding to the guiding hole 89.<br>
On the other hand, the detecting unit 82 is recessed to form a receiving portion 91 into which the supporting block 84 is at least partly insertable or fittable as the holder 81 approaches, and one or more, preferably a plurality of detecting pins 60 are mounted to project substantially toward the holder 81 from the back surface of the receiving portion 91, A raised portion 92 projects at<br>
an opening side of the lateral (bottom) inner wall of the receiving portion 91 in the detecting unit 82, and the rear surface (surface facing the back surface of the receiving portion 91) of the raised portion 92 is formed into a slanted first cam surface 93 sloped up toward the front. This first cam surface 93 is located at a position substantially facing a bottom part of the rear surface of the front wall member 50 pushed down to the partial locking position 1P (first position) as described later, and functions to push the front wall member 50 up from the partial locking position 1P (first position) to the full locking position 2P (second position) by coming substantially into sliding contact with the bottom end of the front wall member 50 as the detecting unit 82 is moved away from the holder 81. A space in the receiving portion 91 behind the first cam surface 93 serves as an escaping space 94 for the front wall member 50 pushed down to the partial locking position 1P (first position).<br>
A slanted second cam surface 95 sloped up toward the front (or inclined with respect to the connecting direction CD) is formed at or close to an opening position of the upper inner wall of the receiving portion 91 in the detecting unit 82 located before the front end position of the raised portion 92. As described later, the second cam surface 95 is located at a position substantially facing the guiding surface 87G when the pushing member 87 is at the standby position SP, and preferably functions to push the front wall member 50 from the full locking position 2P (second position) to the partial locking position 1P (first position) by coming substantially into sliding contact with the guiding surface 87G of the pushing member 87 as the detecting unit 82 approaches the holder 81, The second cam surface 95 is formed to preferably have an angle of<br>
inclination substantially equal to that of the first cam surface 93, but preferably more moderate than that of the guiding surface 87G. The upper inner wall of the receiving portion 91 behind the second cam surface 95 is substantially horizontal (or parallel to the connecting direction CD of the holder 81 and the detecting unit 82) preferably at the substantially same height position as the bottom end of the second cam surface 95 and preferably serves as a preventing surface 96 for keeping the pushing member 87 pushed.<br>
Next, functions of this embodiment are described. The front wall member 50 is first loosely fitted into the mounting frame 27 of the female housing 10 preferably substantially in the mounting direction MD or from below, In this state, the front wall member 50 is pushed up or in the mounting direction MD preferably to let the second latching portions 56 thereof resiliently move over the end walls 35 of the female housing 10 and/or to at least partly fit the second latching portions 56 into the first receiving portions 31, whereby the front wall member 50 can reach the partial locking position 1P (first position) as shown in FIG. 2. The front wall member 50 can reach the full locking position 2P (second position) as shown in FIG. 1 by pushing the front wall member 50 up or in the mounting direction MD to at least partly fit the second latching portions 56 into the second receiving portions 32 and/or to at least partly fit the first latching portions 55 into the first receiving portions 31. Subsequently, preferably the retainer 90 is set or at least partly accommodated in the female housing 10 and held at the partial locking position (first position).<br>
Then, the female terminal fitting 40 is at least partly inserted into the cavity 11 from the inserting side, preferably substantially from behind, to be<br>
resiliency locked by the locking portion 12. At this time, a part of the rear surface of the front wall member 50 at least partly around the tab insertion hole 51 substantially faces the front edge of the female terminal fitting 40, After the insertion of all the female terminal fittings 40 is completed, the retainer 90 is pushed up (preferably substantially obliquely) forward to reach the full locking position (second position), thereby (preferably doubly) locking the female terminal fittings 40. In this state, the tab insertion holes 51 of the front wall member 50 are substantially aligned with the tab insertion openings 41G of the main portions 41 of the female terminal fittings 40, and the jig insertion holes 52 of the front wall member 50 communicate with the mold-removal holes 14 of the female housing 10.<br>
Thereafter, when the mating male connector housing is connected from front, the one or more tabs 70 of the male terminal fittings can at least partly enter the main portion(s) 41 of the one or more female terminal fittings 40 through the tab insertion holes 51 of the front wall member 50 as shown in FIG. 6. At this time, if the tabs 70 at least partly enter at positions displaced from proper ones due to an error in positioning the two housings, the tabs 70 come substantially into contact with the opening edges of the tab insertion holes 51 by deviating from the tab insertion holes 51 of the front wall member 50. Accordingly, even if the female housing 10 is formed with the mold-removal holes 14 communicating with the cavities 11, the erroneous entrance of the tabs 70 into the mold-removal holes 14 can be prevented. In addition, since one or more slanted surfaces 51A for guiding the tabs 70 preferably are formed at least partly around the tab insertion holes 51 in the front surface of the front<br>
wall member 50 in this embodiment, the positions of the tabs 70 are corrected to securely guide the tabs 70 into the main portions 41 of the female terminal fittings 40.<br>
Upon detaching the female terminal fitting 40, the retainer 90 is returned to the partial locking position (first position) or detached and the unlocking jig is at least partly inserted through the jig insertion hole 52 substantially from front. Then, this jig at least partly enters the mold-removal hole 14 from the jig insertion hole 52 to bring the leading end thereof substantially into contact with the leading end of the locking portion 12, whereby the locking portion 12 can be resiliency displaced or deformed laterally or upward (substantially toward the deformation space 13). After being disengaged from the locking portion 12, the female terminal fitting 40 is or can be successively withdrawn,<br>
On the other hand, an electrical connection test is or can be conducted by the testing apparatus 80 with the female terminal fittings 40 at least partly inserted in the cavities 11 of the female housing 10. To this end, the female housing 10 is gripped and at least partly inserted into the connector fixing portion 85 of the holder 81, and the connector F is set by being positioned in the holder 81, Then, as shown in FIG. 8, the operable surface 59A of the front wall member 50 is located at a position substantially facing the guiding hole 89 of the supporting block 84, and the pushing member 87 is located to substantially face the second cam surface 95 of the detecting unit 82 while projecting upward from the upper surface of the supporting block 84.<br>
In this state, the entire detecting unit 82 is brought closer along the connecting direction CD to the holder 81. By this approaching operation, the<br>
second cam surface 95 comes substantially into contact with the guiding surface 87G of the pushing member 87 with the supporting block 84 loosely fitted in the opening of the receiving portion 91. A further movement of the detecting unit 82 causes the guiding surface 87 to move downward (or in a direction substantially opposite to the mounting direction MD) along the second cam surface 95, whereby the pushing member 87 is pushed down (or in a direction substantially opposite to the mounting direction MD) toward the pushing position PP while compressing the spring portion 87E. Then, as shown in FIG. 9, the leading end of the main pushing portion 87B of the pushing member 87 comes substantially into contact with the operable surface 59A through the guiding hole 89. As the detecting unit 82 is further moved, the pushing member 87 is pushed further down (or in a direction substantially opposite to the mounting direction MD), and the front wall member 50 is released from the full locking position 2P (second position) and moved toward the partial locking position 1P (first position) by this pushing force. The front wall member 50 pushed down (or in a direction substantially opposite to the mounting direction MD) to the partial locking position 1P (first position) in this way has a portion projecting downward or outward from the bottom surface of the female housing 10 at least partly escape into the escaping space 94 as shown in FIG. 10.<br>
Concurrently or almost simultaneously with the arrival of the front wall member 50 at the partial locking position 1P (first position), the leading ends of the detecting pins 60 start entering the jig introducing holes 86 of the supporting block 84, As the detecting unit 82 is further moved, the leading ends of the<br>
detecting pins 60 enter the jig insertion holes 52 of the front wall member 50 and come into contact with the female terminal fittings 40 arranged in the cavities 11. At this time, if the female terminal fittings are substantially properly inserted in the cavities 11 as shown in FIG. 11, a testing circuit is formed by the contact of the female terminal fittings 40 and the detecting pins 60. Thus, whether or not the female terminal fittings 40 are insufficiently inserted and/or wrongly distributed can be detected. At such a testing position, the front surface of the supporting block 84 is in contact with the back surface of the receiving portion 91 and the pushing member 87 is prevented from returning to the standby position SP by the preventing surface 96 while receiving a biasing force of the spring portion 87E.<br>
After the test, the detecting unit 82 is moved in a direction away from the holder 81 along the connecting direction CD. As the detecting unit 82 is moved away from the holder 81, the bottom end of the front wall member 50 moves onto the first cam surface 93 and the front wall member 50 moves upward or in the mounting direction MD along the first cam surface 93. Prior to a movement of the front wall member 50 along the first cam surface 93, the pushing member 87 is moved or urged toward the standby position SP substantially along the second cam surface 95 by the biasing force of the spring portion 87E and the front wall member 50 is freed from the pushing force as shown in FIG. 12. In this way, the front wall member 50 is released from the partial locking position 1P (first position) and moved towards or to the full locking position 2P (second position) and, thereafter, the detecting unit 82 is moved away from the holder<br>
81 as shown in FIG. 13, whereby the connector F can be taken out with the front wall member 50 held at the full locking position 2P (second position).<br>
As described above, according to this embodiment, it is sufficient to push the operable surface 59A exposed at the upper end surface of the front wall member 50 to push the front wall member 50 downward (toward the partial locking position along the front surface of the female housing 10 upon moving the front wall member 50 from the full locking position 2P (second position) to the partial locking position 1P (first position) or detaching the front wall member 50, i.e. upon shifting the front wall member 50 to an unmounted state. Therefore, operability is better.<br>
Further, even if such an operable surface 59A is exposed, the front wall member 50 can be held at the partial locking position 1P (first position) while being held substantially in contact with the upper wall 26 of the mounting frame 27. Thus, the front wall member 50 can be securely held at the full locking position 2P (second position) without exiting upward from the full locking position 2P (second position).<br>
Furthermore, the front wall member 50 is formed with the one or more tab insertion holes 51 and/or the jig insertion holes 52 and movable between the full locking position 2P (second position) and the partial locking position 1P (first position), wherein the tabs 70 can come substantially into contact with (preferably the contact points 45A of) the female terminal fittings 40 through the tab insertion holes 51 with the front wall member 50 held at the full locking position 2P (second position) and/or the detecting pins 60 can come into contact with the detecting plates 46 of the female terminal fittings 40 through<br>
the jig insertion holes 52 with the front wall member 50 held at the partial locking position 1P (first position). Thus, the tabs 70 and the detecting pins 60 preferably can be precisely guided to the contact points 45A and the detecting plates 46 of the female terminal fittings 40, respectively, thereby improving contact reliability.<br>
Since the front wall member 50 is pushed from the full locking position 2P (second position) to the partial locking position 1P (first position) as the holder 81 and the detecting unit 82 are brought closer to each other (e.g. by a lever action of a lever mounted thereon preferably displaying a cam action or the like), the front wall member 50 can be moved during a series of testing cycles by the testing apparatus 80, thereby improving operation efficiency. Similarly, after the test, the front wall member 50 is pushed from the partial locking position 1P (first position) back substantially to the full locking position 2P (second position) as the holder 81 and the detecting unit 82 are separated from each other, Thus, operation efficiency is even better. As a result, a plurality of connectors can be successively and quickly tested. Further, since it is sufficient to set the cam surfaces and the pushing member 87 as means for moving the front wall member 50, it is not necessary to particularly change the construction of the testing apparatus 80.<br>
Accordingly, to improve operability upon, for example, detaching a front wall member, a front wall member 50 formed with one or more tab insertion holes 51 that can substantially communicate with one or more respective cavities 11 is mounted or mountable on or to the front surface of a female housing 10. An operable surface 59A is at least partly exposed at the distal or<br>
lateral (upper) end surface of the front wall member 50 (front end surface when seen in the mounting direction MD), and the front wall member 50 can be moved from a full locking position 2P (second position) to a partial locking position 1P (first position) substantially along or on the front surface of the female housing 10 by pushing or manipulating this operable surface 59A. Portions of the upper end surface of the front wall member 50 other than the operable surface 59A can be held substantially in contact with an upper wall 26. wherefore the front wall member 50 does not exit upward from the full locking position. 2P (second position) <second embodiment></second>
Next, a second preferred embodiment of the preset invention is described with reference to FIGS. 14 to 16. The second embodiment mainly differs from the first embodiment in the construction of a lower part of the front wall member 50, but the other construction is substantially similar or the same as the first embodiment<br>
A front wall member 50 of the second embodiment is formed such that a base portion 54 provided at the bottom of the rear surface thereof extends backward, and the rear surface of the base portion 54 is located more backward than the rear surfaces of vertical ribs 53, A front end portion of the bottom wall of a female housing 10 is cut off to form a recess or notch 21 into which the base portion 54 is at least partly insertable in the mounting direction MD or substantially from below or from outside when the front wall member 50 reaches a full locking position 2P (second position). Further, when the front wall member 50 substantially reaches the full locking position 2P (second position),<br>
the base portion 54 can be held substantially in contact with main portions 41 located above it. Thus, the front wall member 50 cannot be pushed up any further upward or in the mounting direction MD.<br>
According to the second embodiment, the symmetry of the front wall member 50 is lost by the base portion 54 and the pushable portion 59 functioning as an identifying construction. Thus, the orientation of the front wall member 50 along vertical and/or transverse directions can be identified. Therefore, the orientation of the front wall member 50 can be advantageously discriminated by an automatic machine upon assembling the front wall member 50. This also holds for the first embodiment, <detailed construction of the testing apparatus><br>
FIGS. 17 to 22 show a more specific construction of the testing apparatus shown in the first preferred embodiment, Parts common or similar to those described in the first embodiment are not described here by being identified by the same reference numerals in FIGS. 17 to 22.<br>
The detecting unit 82 and the holder 81 are arranged or arrangeable on a base 100. A pair of side walls 101 stand at the substantially opposite longer edges of the base 100, and a guiding projection 102 projects from the inner surface of each side wall 101 over a specified (predetermined or predeterminable) length range.<br>
As shown in FIG. 19, the detecting unit 82 has a footing 103 at its lower part, wherein the substantially opposite widthwise surfaces of the footing 103 are recessed to form one or more guiding grooves 104. Both guiding grooves 104 are engaged with the above one or more guiding projections 102, so that<br>
the detecting unit 81 is movable substantially along the guide projections 102. The detecting unit 81 has a main body 105 atop or on the footing 103, and one end of each connection link 106 is rotatably or pivotably coupled to the corresponding one of the opposite side surfaces of the main body 105. On the other hand, a supporting block 107 is fixed at the rear end of the upper surface of the base 100, and an operating lever 108 is rotatably or pivotably mounted on the supporting block 107. The other ends of the connecting links 106 are coupled to the operating lever 108, so that the detecting unit 81 can be moved substantially forward and backward or along the connecting direction CD as the operating lever 108 is rotated or pivoted,<br>
The receiving portion 91 into which the supporting block 84 of the holder 81 is at least partly fittable or insertable is formed in the main body 105 of the detecting unit 82. and one or more, preferably a plurality of detecting pins 60 project from the back wall of the receiving portion 91. These detecting pins 60 are located at such positions substantially corresponding to the one or more respective jig insertion holes 52 when the front wall member 50 of the connector F set in the holder 81 is moved to the partial locking position 1P (first position).<br>
Both first and second cam surfaces 93, 95 for moving the front wall member 50 between the partial locking position 1P (first position) and the full locking position 2P (second position) are arranged at or close to an opening edge portion of the receiving portion 91. The first cam surface 93 for returning the front wall member 50 from the partial locking position 1P (first position) to the full locking position 2P (second position) is located at such a height position<br>
displaced toward the top at the left opening edge as shown in FIG. 19. Specifically, as shown in FIG. 18, a cam projection 110 substantially horizontally projects from the inner wall surface of the receiving portion 91 inwardly of the receiving portion 91 over a range from the opening edge to the back wall, and the first cam surface 93 is formed to be sloped up from the back side toward the opening edge on the inner surface of the leading end of the cam projection 110. On the other hand, the second cam surface 95 for moving the front wall member 50 from the full locking position 2P (second position) to the partial locking position 1P (first position) is formed by obliquely cutting or recessing off the right opening edge of FIG. 19 preferably substantially at the same height position as the first cam surface 93, and/or is sloped down from the opening edge toward the back side.<br>
The holder 81 includes the back wall 83 fixed onto the base 100 and the supporting block 84 coupled to an upper part of the front surface of the back wall 83. The supporting block 84 is recessed to form the connector fixing portion 85 for at least partly accommodating the connector F. The connector fixing portion 85 is open in the lateral (upper) surface of the supporting block 84 to form a connector insertion opening 86 as shown in FIG. 20. This connector insertion opening 86 is formed to preferably have a shape substantially in conformity with the outer shape of the connector F with the front wall member 50 held at the full locking position 2P (second position). Accordingly, even if an erroneous attempt is made to insert the connector F with the front wall member 50 held at the partial locking position 1P (first position), part of the front wall member 50 interferes with the opening edge of the connector insertion opening<br>
86, Thus, an operator can be informed that the connector F is not in a proper state to be tested, thereby preventing the connector F from being damaged by a forcible testing operation.<br>
The connector fixing portion 85 including the connector insertion opening 86 is open in the rear surface of the holder 81, thereby forming a wire escaping portion 111.<br>
The pushing member 87 for moving the front wall member 50 at the full locking position 2P (second position) to the partial locking position (first position) preferably is pushably mounted on one side surface of the supporting block 84, and is normally held at the standby position SP where a rear end portion thereof (as seen in the pushing direction) projects from the supporting block 84 (see FIG. 18). The pushing member 87 is arranged to face the second cam surface 95 of the detecting unit 82 and comes substantially into sliding contact with the second cam surface 95 as the detecting unit 82 is brought or bringable closer to the holder 81 along the connecting direction CD, whereby the pushing member 87 is pushed from the standby position SP to the pushing position PP. An interference avoiding groove 112 is formed along longitudinal direction in the side surface of the supporting block 84 substantially opposite to the one where the pushing member 87 is mounted, and communicates with the connector fixing portion 85. This interference avoiding groove 112 receives the first cam surface 93 as the detecting unit 82 is brought closer to the holder 81, and lets the first cam surface 93 pass before the front wall member 50 is pushed, thereby avoiding the interference of the advancing detecting unit 82 with the front wall member 50. Further, escaping grooves 113 are formed in the<br>
bottom surface and the ceiling surface of the interference avoiding groove 112 to avoid the interference with the front wall member 50 moved to the partial locking position.<br>
That the first cam surface 93 lifts up or moves the front wall member 50 at the partial locking position 1P (first position) back to the full locking position 2P (second position) as the detecting unit 82 is moved away from the holder 81 is same as in the first embodiment. <other embodiments><br>
