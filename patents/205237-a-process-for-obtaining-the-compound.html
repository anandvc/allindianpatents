Process for the alkylation of alkyl- or benzylcyanogen derivatives in the presence of trialkylamines or -phosphines<br>
European Patent Application EP 0 671 379 describes a process for the methyiation of organic compounds in the presence of trialkylamines and dimethyl carbonate. The yield of a.a-dimethylbenzyl cyanide is 29 %. In addition, the alkylation of benzyl cyanide using alkylating agents such as methyl iodide or methyl chloride in the presence of strong bases such as sodium hydride, sodium amide or sodium alkoxide is described (Smith et alM J. Org. Chem. 36 (1971), 15, pages 2132-2137; Trivedi et al., J. Med. Chem., EN, 36, 22, (1993), pages 3300- 3307). Disadvantages of this reaction are the increased formation of ether products, and the formation and emission of hydrogen and ammonia together with the alkylating agent. Moreover, the strong bases have to be prepared in a manner which is ecologically and economically complex.<br>
The object of the present invention is to find a process for alkylating the compounds of the formula II in high yields and purity.<br>
The invention thus relates to a process for obtaining the compound of the formula I<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Preference is given to using the process according to the invention for preparing compounds of the formula I where R andR are(Ci-C6)-alM&gt; and<br>
3<br>
R  is phenyl.<br>
Particular preference is given to preparing dimethylbenzyl cyanide or 1-methyl-4-phenylpiperidine-4-carbonitrile.<br>
The compound of the formula I is prepared by firstly introducing the base and the compound of the formulae V and/or VI with stirring and then adding the compound of the formula II, which has, if necessary, been dissolved beforehand in an organic solvent, and the alkylating agent, the reaction of which gives a compound of the formula I.<br>
Per mole of the compound of the formula II, preference is given to using from 2.1 mol to 2.4 mol, in particular from 2.15 mol to 2.25 mol, of the alkylating agent of the formula III, and, per mol of the compound of the formula II, preference is given to using from 2.5 mol to 4 mol, in particular from 2.8 mol to 3.2 mol, of the base.<br>
Per 100 percent by weight (% by wt.) of the compound of the formula II, preference is given to using from 0.5% by wt. to 5% by wt., in particular from 1 % by wt. to 2% by wt. of the compound of the formulae V and/or VI.<br><br>
The reaction temperature is from 20°C to 100°C, preferably from 30°C to 40°C. The reaction time is generally from 2 to 10 hours.<br>
If the alkylating agent is in gaseous form, as is the case with methyl chloride (chloromethane), it is also possible to carry out the reaction at a pressure of up to 5 bar above atmospheric pressure. In the alkylating reaction with dialkyl sulfate, the methylsulfuric acid which forms during the reaction is bonded by the further addition of alkali metal hydroxide if necessary. When the reaction is complete, the compound of the formula I is isolated. For this, water is added to the mixture, and the phases which form as a result are then separated. The compound of the formula I is then obtained from the organic phase. If it appears necessary, the organic phase can be subjected to a purification procedure, such as, for example, distillation under reduced pressure, or crystallization from a solvent.<br>
Preferred bases are alkali metal hydroxides, e.g. sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and lithium hydroxide, particularly preferably sodium hydroxide.<br>
Preferred solvents are, for example:<br>
(C5-C7)-aliphatic and (C6-C8)-cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, such as pentane, 2-methylbutane, hexane, 2,2-dimethylbutane, 2-methylpentane, 3-methyl-pentane, heptane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane and 1,3-dimethylcyclohexane; aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene and isoproylbenzene; aromatic and aliphatic halogenated hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzene, dichloromethane, dichloropropane and 1,2-dichloroethane; polyethers, such as ethylene glycol dibutyl ether, diethylene glycol ethyl tert-butyl ether, polyethylene glycol dibutyl ether, polypropylene glycol dibutyl ether, polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether, polyethylene glycol diethyl ether, polypropylene glycol diethyl ether and polypropylene glycol methyl ether; heterocyclic hydrocarbons, such as N-methylpyrrolidone and pyridine; ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran, dibutyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, and also dimethyl carbonate and dimethyl sulfoxide.<br>
Suitable compounds of the formula V and/or VI are the following:<br>
trimethylamine, dimethylethylamine, triethylamine, tri-n-propylamine, triisopropylamine,   tributylamine,   trioctylamine,   tricyclohexylamine,<br><br>
trihexadecylamine,     diphenylmethylamine,     dimethylbenzylamine, dibenzylmethylamine, tribenzylamine, triphenylamine, trimethylphosphine,        triethylphosphine,        tri-n-propylphosphine, tributylphosphine,     triisopropylphosphine,     trioctylphosphine     and triphenylphosphine.<br>
It is also possible to use mixtures of the compounds of the formula V and/or VI. Preferred compounds of the formula V and/or VI are (C3-C24)-trioctylamine or (C3-C24)-trioctylphosphine. Particularly preferred compounds of the formula V and/or formula VI are trioctylamine, trioctylphosphine and triethylamine.<br>
Preferred alkylating agents are (Ci-Ce)-alkyl halides, such as alkyl chloride, alkyl bromide, alkyl fluoride or alkyl iodide, in particular methyl chloride, ethyl chloride or propyl chloride; (Ci-C6)-dialkyl sulfates, such as dimethyl, diethyl, dipropyl, dibutyl, dipentyl or dihexyl sulfate or di-(2-chloroethyl)methylamine.<br>
The term "halogen" is taken to mean fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. The term "alkyl" or "alkenyl" is taken to mean hydrocarbon radicals whose carbon chain is straight or branched. Cyclic alkyl radicals are, for example, 3- to 6-membered monocycles, such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl. In addition, the alkenyl radical can contain more than one double bond, i.e. also 2, 3 or 4 double bonds.<br>
In addition, it has sometimes proven advantageous to additionally add to the reaction mixture at least one quaternary ammonium compound and/or phosphonium compound of the formulae VII and VIII<br><br><br>
a)	(C1-C2o)-alkyli straight-chain or branched,<br>
b)	Benzyl or<br>
c)	Phenyl, and X" is an anion.<br>
It is also possible to additionally use mixtures of the compounds of the formulae VII and VIII. Preferred quaternary ammonium or phosphonium compounds of the formulae VII and VIII are methyltrioctylammonium chloride, methyltrioctylammonium hydroxide, methyltricaprylammonium chloride, methyl-tricaprylammonium hydroxide, ethyltrioctylammonium chloride, ethyl-trioctylphosphonium chloride and hexadecyltributylphosphonium bromide, in particular methyltrioctylammonium chloride.<br>
Per 100 mol of the compound of the formula II, preference is given to using from 10 mol to 300 mol, in particular from 100 mol to 300 mol, of the compound of the formulae VII and/or VIII.<br>
The compounds of the formulae VII and VIII are, for example, added prior to the compound of the formula II.<br>
The starting substances for the alkylating reaction according to the invention can be prepared by processes known from the literature, for example by cyanolysis of the corresponding halogen compounds.<br>
The products of the process are desired compounds for the preparation of many subsequent products, e.g. for the preparation of antiallergically effective medicaments such as 4-[4-[4-(hydroxydiphenyl)-1-piperidinyl]-1-hydroxybutyl]-a,a-dimethylphenylacetic acid (US 4 254 129).<br>
Advantageous features are the high yields and the high purity of the prepared products.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of dimethylbenzyl cyanide<br>
A reactor was charged with 1416 g of sodium hydroxide solution, 33% strength, and 425 g of caustic soda. 6 g of trioctylamine was then added to this solution, and then 400 g of benzyl cyanide and 380 g of chloromethane were reacted in this mixture at from 20°C to 40°C with stirring at superatmospheric pressure. After the internal pressure had dropped to below 0.5 bar, the residual pressure was released. 2000 ml of water were then added, and the mixture was briefly stirred and allowed to settle, and then the phases were separated. The organic phase was distilled under reduced pressure to give 485.5 g of pure dimethylbenzyl cyanide having a content of more than 99% (determined by gas chromatography (GC)). This is 98% of theory based on benzyl cyanide used. The content of monomethylbenzyl cyanide and unreacted benzyl cyanide was in each case below 0.1%. The content of hydrolysis products such as phenyiacetic acid was below the detection limit.<br><br><br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of 1-methyl-4-phenylpiperidine-4-carbonitrile (Dolantin nitrile)<br>
A reactor was charged with 1160 g of sodium hydroxide solution, 33% strength, and 184 g of caustic soda. 5 g of trioctylamine and 15 g of methyltrioctylammonium chloride were added to this solution. 117 g of benzyl cyanide and a solution of 163.8 g of di-(2-chloroethyl)methylamine in 820 g of toluene were then simultaneously metered in at from 60°C to 80°C with thorough stirring. The mixture was then stirred for a further 2 to 4 hours. 2000 ml of water were then added, and the mixture was briefly stirred, and the phases which formed were separated from one another. An initially acidic, and subsequently alkaline extraction separated the product from the catalyst (trioctylamine, methyltrioctylammonium chloride) and organic impurities. The toluene was then distilled off from the organic phase under reduced pressure. The distillation residue was then further purified by distillation under a high vacuum at a pressure of less than 1 mbar. The distillate obtained was 180 g of 1-methyl-4-phenylpiperidine-4-carbonitrile having a content of more than 99% (determined by gas chromatography (GC)). This corresponds to a yield of 90% of theory based on the benzyl cyanide used.<br><br><br><br>
