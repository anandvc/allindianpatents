THE PATENTS RULES, 2003 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"THE S-ISOMER OF A METABOLITE OF KETOTIFEN"<br>
BRIDGE PHARMA, INC., of 902 Contento Street, Sarasota, FL 34242, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to the 5-isomer of a metabolite of ketotifen.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This  invention relates  to. methods  of  treatment  of inflammatory  and allergic   diseases   by   using   nor-ketotifen,   10-hydroxy-ketotifen,   10-hydroxy-norketotifen,   or  optically   active   isomers   of ketotifen, norketotifen,   10-hydroxy-ketotifen   or   10-hydroxy-norketotifen,   and pharmaceutically  acceptable  salts   and   solvates   thereof.     More particularly,   this   invention   relates to   methods   of  treating  pulmonary diseases  (such as  asthma bronchitis) and skin disorders (such as urticaria and   atopic   dermatitis),   and   gastro-intestinal   disorders   (such gastric   irritation  and  enteritis),  while   avoiding  sedative and cardiovascular  side  effects   that  are  commonly   associated  with antihistamines.   In   another   embodiment,   norketotifen   and   the   optically active  isomers  of nor-ketotifen  were found  to  be particularly  useful  for the  treatment of ocular diseases   such   as  conjunctivitis  and  keratitis.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This   invention  relates   specifically   to   anti-inflammatory   and  antiallergic   compounds,  having   therapeutic   use   in   various   diseases,   most importantly   for   patients   suffering   from   pulmonary   diseases,   including asthma   and   bronchitis,   from   dermal   diseases,   including   urticaria   and atopic   dermatitis   and   from   gastro-intestinal   disorders   including   gastric irritation   and   enteritis.<br>
The  compounds  described  in   this  invention  are metabolites  of ketotifen   (4-(l-     methyl-4-piperidyline)-4H-benzo(4,5)   cyclohepta-(l,2-b)   thiophene-10one).Due to serious sedative side effects thet are  related  to<br>
 ketotifen   that   compound   has   limited   therapeutic   usefulness.<br>
Ketotifen  is metabolized in  the  body  along  various pathways:<br><br><br><br><br>
                                                                            2 <br>
WO 01/19367<br><br>
PCT/USOO/24892<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The metabolite   norketotifen  (also called  nor-ketotifen)   is formed   by demethylation    of ketotifen:<br><br><br>
NOR-KETOTIFEN<br>
The metabolites    10-hydroxy-ketotifen    and   10-hydroxy-norketotifen    are formed by   reduction   of the ketotifen   and   norketotifen    molecules,   respectively.<br><br>
10-HYDROXY-KETOTIFEN	10-HYDROXY-NORKETOTIFEN<br>

WO 01/19367<br><br>
PCT/US00/24892<br><br>
Other metabolites of ketotifen are also formed in the body after administration  of ketotifen.  Thus,  the  ketotifen  molecule  can undergo  N-glucuronidation  and  be  converted into  N-oxide  ketotifen.     The hydroxylated   isomers   can   be   further   metabolized   to   10-hydroxy-glucuronidates.  Other metabolites may  be formed  as  well  and the metabolic  pathways  are different in various  species and may also  be different   between   infants   and   adults.<br>
No published pharmacological  studies  of the racemates or the isomers  of norketotifen,   10-hydroxy-ketotifen   or   10-hydroxy-norketotifen   are   known to  us.  Pharmacological properties  of the isomers  of ketotifen  have  been described  by  Polivka et al.:  4H-benzo(4,5)cyclohepta(l,2-b)thiophenes and   9,10-dihydro   derivatives-sulfonium   analogues   of  pizotifen   and ketotifen;   chirality  of ketotifen;  synthesis  of the  2-bromo derivative  of ketotifen.  Collect.  Czech. Chem. Commun.  1989, 5 4, 2443  -  2469.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The  isomers  of ketotifen  have  now  been   synthesized  and  studied<br>
 pharmacologically  in  vitro   and   in  vivo.   Various   metabolites  of ketotifen <br>
 have  also   been synthesized and  studied   pharmacologically. It  has   been<br>
found that the antihistaminic   effects   of racemic   norketotifen  are<br>
qualitatively  similar  to  the  antihistaminic  effects   of racemic  ketotifen.<br>
Thus   both   ketotifen  and   nor-ketotifen   are  histamine  H-1   antagonists   with<br>
varying  degree of histamine  H-2  antagonism.     However,  surprisingly  and<br>
Importantly,   a .significant   qualitative   difference   was   found   between<br>
racemic  ketotifen  and  the  compounds  described  in  this  invention:   the<br>
compounds   described  here   do  not  have   the  severe  and  dose-limiting<br>
sedative  activity of ketotifen.  It has  now also  been established that<br>
racemic   norketotifen  and  particularly  the  isomer  thereof has  potent   antiÂ¬<br>
inflammatory  and   anti-histaminic  properties   with  little  or  no  sedative  side<br>
effect. Likewise, it was found that while both isomers of ketotifen had<br>
approximately  the  same  antihistaminic  activity,   almost all  the  sedative<br>
side  effects  were  found  to  reside in  R(+)-ketotifen.  The metabolites   10-<br>
hydroxy-norketotifen   and   10-hydroxy-ketotifen   and, the   isomers   of  both<br>
compounds  were  also  found  to  inhibit  inflammation  and  to  block<br>
 histamine II-1 receptors, while  causing  significantly less  sedation   than<br>
ketotifen.	<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Chemical   syntheses   of  ketotifen,   norketotifen,   10-hydroxy-ketotifen   and 10-hydroxy-norketotifen,   stereochemically isomeric   forms   and<br>
diastereomers    thereof.<br>
Racemic  ketotifen  and  norketotifen  are  made  by  the  methods<br>
described in Waldvogel et al. (Helv. Chim. Acta 59,  866-877,  1976) which<br>
is  hereby  incorporated  by reference.     R-(+)-ketotifen   and   S-(-)-ketotifen<br>
are prepared  by  fractional crystallization  of the  salts  of racemic ketotifen<br>
with (-)-0,0"-di(p-toluyl)-R-tartaric   acid   and   (+)-0,0"-di(p-toluyl)-S-<br>
tartaric acid, respectively, as described by Polivka et al. (Collect. Czech.<br>
Chem. Commun.  54, 2443-2469, 1989) which is  hereby  incorporated  by<br>
reference.	<br>
The  preferred  method  for  preparation   of the   optically  active isomers   of   norketotifen,   10-hydroxyketotifen   and   10-hydroxy-norketotifen is from the individual R and  S  enantiomers of ketotifen.     A new method of norketotifen synthesis  is claimed which avoids the strenuous conditions  of Waldvogel  et al.,   1976)  that would result in<br>
racemization of  the product.     Other method include stereoselective synthesis using   chiral   templates,   resolution   of   the   corresponding racemates  using  conventional   means   such   as   fractional   crystallization   of diastereomeric   salts   with  chiral   acids   and   chromatography   using   chiral supports.<br>
The   10-hydroxy   derivatives   are  prepared   by   catalytic  reduction   of the   corresponding   ketotifen   enantiomers   by   methods   described   by Waldvogel et al.,   1976.     It must be noted  that the   10-hydroxy-ketotifens possess  an additional  chiral  center,  and  that  diastereomers  of the corresponding  R and  S  enantiomers  of the  ketotifens  are  obtained.     These may   be  separated   by   conventional   crystallization   or   chromatographic methods  because of the differences  in solubilities   and   chromatographic mobilities of diastereomeric isomers.     Alternatively,  reduction of the R and S enantiomers of the ketotifens with chiral reducing agents may be employed  to  prepare  exclusively  (or to  greatly  enrich  mixtures  in)  the desired   diastereomeric   product.<br>

Designation   of   absolute   configurations.<br>
The  enantiomers of ketotifen and   norketotifen  do  not possess<br>
asymmetric carbon atoms as is typical  of optical isomers.    Rather, the<br>
enantiomers   result  from  molecular   asymmetry   due   to   hindered<br>
interconversion   of  the  seven-membered ring.     The (+)-ketotifen is<br>
designated R  and has the configuration  observed  in  the x-ray crystal<br>
structure   of (+)-ketotifen  (-)-0,0"-di(p-toluyl)-R-tartrate by Polivka et al.,<br>
1989.    (-)-Ketotifen has the S  designation.	<br>
 In the 10-hydroxy ketotifen derivatives an additional  chiral  center  -  the 10-carbon atom - is present, and both R and S  configurations exist as defined  in  standard rules of stereochemistry.     In  the naming of the diastereomers   resulting  from  reduction   of  the   ketotifen   enantiomers,   the first letter R or S refers to the configuration of the seven membered ring and the second letter R or S to the configuration of the  10 carbon atom.<br>

(R)-4-(1-(2,2.2-Trichloroethoxycarbony-4-piperidylidenc)-9.10-dihydro-4H-benzo-(4,5)-cyclohepta (1.2-b)thiophene-10-one:     Anhydrous  sodium carbonate  (95.0 mg,  898  umol),  (+)-(R)-ketotifen  (278  mg,  898  pmol),  and benzyltriethylammonium   chloride   (BTEAC) (205 mg, 898 pmol)   were combined  in a dry flask and placed  under high  vacuum for two days. Freshly  distilled dichloromethane  (2  mL)   was   then  added  to  the  mixture under   N2   at room  temperature  with  stirring,  followed by  the  addition of 2,2,2-trichloroethyl   chloroformate  (556  uL, 4.04 mmol).    The biphasic reaction mixture was refluxed for one  hour,  and after cooling to  room temperature,   it  was   quenched  by   the   addition   of  saturated  aqueous sodium  carbonate  (7 mL).    The resulting mixture  was diluted with dichloromethane  (50  mL),  and  the  organic  phase  was  separated,   dried over sodium  sulfate,  filtered,  evaporated  and chromatographed   (Si02, ethyl acetate-petroleum ether 20:1   to   10:1).

After 2 hours,  the mixture  was filtered over celite   and washed with  copious dichloromethane  and  water.     The filtrate  was basified   with   saturated   aqueous   sodium   carbonate,   and   the   organic  layer was  separated,   dried  over sodium  sulfate,  filtered,  and  evaporated  to  give crude  (R)-norketotifen  (157 mg,  90%).

Pharmacological   studies   of  ketotifen,   norketotifen,   10-OH-ketotifen, 10-OH-nor-ketotifen   and   the  optically   active   isomers  thereof.<br>
As discussed above, it has now been shown that the S-isomer of ketotifen,   and  the  racemates  and  isomeric  forms   of norketotifen,   10-OH-ketotifen   and10-OH-nor-ketotifen   have   beneficial   pharmacological   effects, useful in the  treatment of diseases, such  as  for example allergic disorders, pulmonary   disorders,   cutaneous   disorders   and   gastrointestinal   disorders, while not causing the severe sedative  side  effects  of ketotifen. The surprising  findings   are  described  in   the   following   examples.<br>
TEST METHOD 1:       Binding to histaminergic receptors<br>
The affinities  of the racemic  and  isomeric  test compounds  for the histamine   H1-receptor are assessed  using  the  3H-pyrilamine   binding   assay as described by Dini et al. (Agents and Actions,   1991, 33:   181-184). Briefly,  membranes  from guinea pig cerebellum  are  incubated  with  3H-pyrilamine  and   varying  concentrations   of  the   test  compound(s).     The pecific binding of the radioactive ligand  to  the  receptor is defined as the difference   between   total  binding  and   nonspecific   binding,   determined  in the presence- of an excess of unlabelled  ligand.     The results are expressed as percentage  of specific  binding in the  presence  of compounds.  IC50             values  (concentration  required  to  inhibit  50%   of specific  binding)  and Hill     coefficients  (nH)  are  determined  by  non-linear  regression  analysis  of the                  competition  curves.     These parameters  are  obtained  by  Hill equation curve fitting  using  Sigmaplotâ¢ software.<br>
                TESTMETHOD 2:      Antihistaminic effects in vitro<br>
                Strips of bronchial  or other smooth muscle  tissues  are removed from  the body of male guinea pigs weighing 400-600 g.     The  tissues are suspended in an oxygenated buffer of the composition (mM): NaCl,  133; KC1, 4.7; CaCl2, 2.5; MgS04, 0.6; NaH2P04, 1.3; NaHC03,  16.3; and glucose, 7.7, or in<br>

a solution of a similar composition. The solution is maintained at 37.5 C. Contractions  are recorded  with  isometric  transducers  (Model  FT-10)  on  a Grass   polygraph.<br>
In order to assess the viability of each tissue and to serve as a frame of reference,  contractions  of each  strip  of tissue  are recorded  initially  in response to exposure to an oxygenated buffer in which the NaCl is replaced by KC1 to yield a concentration of 137.7 mM KC1.    This is followed by  return  to  the standard  oxygenated  buffer,  and  then  by exposures   to   progressively  increasing   concentrations   of histamine,   with separate  exposures  to  each  concentration  only  until  the  peak response  has been  recorded.     Then,   leaving  one  tissue  strip  untreated,   the remaining strips  each  are exposed for a predetermined  time  interval  to one concentration   of an  antagonist.   Finally,   the  responses  to  increasing concentrations of histamine followed by exposure  to  137.7 mM KC1 are recorded   a   second   time.<br>
TEST METHOD 3:    Binding  to   muscarinic   receptors<br>
The  experiments  are  carried  out   on  membranes  prepared  from   SF9 cells   infected   with   baculovirus   to   express   human   recombinant   muscarinic receptor subtypes.     After incubation  with  the  test article  and  the  proper radioligand   and   washing,   bound   radioactivity   is   determined   with   a   liquid scintillation   counter,   using   a   commercial   scintillation   cocktail.   The specific  radioligand  binding  to  each  receptor  is  defined  as  the  difference between   total   binding   and  nonspecific   binding  determined  in   the presence of an excess of unlabelled ligand.  IC50   values   (concentrations required  to  inhibit 50%  of specific  binding)  are  determined  by  non  linear regression  analysis   of the  competition   curves.<br>
TEST METHOD 4:      Inhibition  of  bronchial   eosinophil   accumulation<br>
Inhibition  of eosinophil  accumulation  in  lung  is  determined  in  sensitized guinea pigs   (400  to  600 grams)  following  intraperitoneal  injection  of an allergen such as for example PAF (platelet aggregating factor) or bovine serum  albumin.  At  a predetermined  time  thereafter,  the  animals  are  killed with a barbiturate. The trachea is exposed and cannulated. 6 x  10 ml aliquots  of  buffered  modified  Tyrode"s   solution   (composition:  NaHC03 11.9, NaCl 136.9, KC1 2.7, Na2HP04 0.4, glucose 5.6, EDTA  19.8, gelatin 0.1%  w/v; pH 7.4)  are  introduced  successively and  aspirated by  gentle<br>

compression of the lungs.  Total fluid recovery normally  exceeds  80%.  Cell suspensions  are  concentrated  by  low  speed  centrifugation  (200  G for   10 min) and the resulting cell pellet is resuspended in   1  ml modified Tyrode"s solution.    Total cell counts are made by diluting  10pl of cell suspension in  90pl of Turk"s fluid.    Differential cell counts are made from smears fixed in methanol (100%)  and stained in Leishman stain.    A total of at least 500 cells per smear are counted at  1000 fold magnification, in order to differentiate cell  types.     Drugs  are  administered  as  sustained subcutaneous   infusions  from  an. implanted  Alza  minipump   (Alzet  2001   or similar)  or  by  repeated  oral  or  repeated   parenteral  injections.<br>
TEST METHOD 5:      Dermal   antiinflammatory   effects<br>
Dermal   antiinflammatory  effects   are   tested   using   the  mouse   ear  croton  oil inflammation  method. This  test method  is  based on Tarrida, J.  et al., Meth. Find. Exp.  Clin.  Pharmacol.  (1996)   18(4):233-234 and Blazzo, et al., Prostaglandins   (1995) 50:161-168.     In  short,  male  mice  (25-30g)  are treated  with  5ml/kg of a  2mg/ml  solution  of each  test compound  in physiological   saline  by  intraperitoneal   injection.     Thirty   minutes   after injection,  croton  oil (0, 20ul of 1.0% croton oil in acetone) or acetone (control)  is topically applied to  both ears  of each  mouse.  Animals are restrained  during  croton  oil  or  acetone   application   and   then  released  into a cage.    Before and at predetermined  time  intervals following croton  oil or acetone   application,   groups  of animals   are   anesthetized   with   halothane and  euthanized  by  cervical  dislocation.   Ears  are  removed  and  weighed. Average ear weight is plotted against time. A total of 4 animals per timepoint  are   tested  for each  compound  and  the  vehicle  control.<br>
TEST METHOD 6:        Studies on sedative side effects.<br>
The  physostigmine-induced  lethality   test  is   being  used  in  the present studies.  This test is a modification  of the  sedation  test technique reported by VILLANI et al., in US Patent 4,659,716.    In short, physostigmine   (1.9  rng/kg  s.c.)  produces   90-100%   lethality  when  given  to grouped mice with 10 animals in each plastic cage (11cm x 26 cm x  13cm) Mice administered a sedating agent,  such as for example  a sedative antihistamine  prior to physostigmine  are  protected  and  survive.     In  the present  study,   test  compounds   are   administered   orally  60   minutes  prior to physostigmine.     The  numbers  of survivors  are  counted  30 minutes  after physostigmine    administration.<br>

Therapeutic   dose   levels.<br>
Since  the  compounds of the present invention do  not express the severe and dose-limiting  sedative  side  effects  of ketotifen,  the compounds of this invention may be given in higher doses  than are presently used for   ketotifen.<br>
The  actual  dosage  levels  of active  ingredients in  the pharmaceutical compositions  of this invention may  be  varied  so  as to  obtain the desired therapeutic  effect.     Thus  the  amount  of drug  used  varies  and may depend on  factors  such  as  administration  form,  severity  of the  disease,  frequency of dosing etc.    For  use  as  medication  to patients   suffering from  benign airways  or  bronchial   disorders   (such   as  asthma,   bronchitis,   etc.),   oral doses of the compound of this invention are used at dose levels of 0.5 mg to about 200 mg, preferably from   I  mg to 20 mg once to four times daily to a patient weighing 60 kg. The daily dose may be increased or decreased  depending  on   various  factors,   for  example  the   weight  and  the disease  status  of the  patient.<br>
As an  example, for use as  medication  to patients suffering from a seasonal  allergic  condition,  such  as  for example  allergic  rhinitis,  oral doses of a compound of this invention may be used at dose levels of 0.1 mg to about  100 mg, preferably from  1  mg to 20 mg once to four times daily to a patient  weighing 60 kg.  For patients  suffering  from seasonal allergic  conjunctivitis,  the  concentration  of a   solution  containing  a compound  of this   invention  for  instillation  into   the conjunctival  sac  may contain from 0.01%  to 4.0%, preferably 0.02%  to 2.0% of the active ingredient.       For patients suffering fr.om  asthma,  a compound of this invention is used at an oral dose level of 2 to  100 mg, preferably 2 to 20 mg once to four times daily to a patient weighing 60 kg. The frequency and amount of the dosage will be determined  by the clinician based on various clinical factors, such as  for example  the weight and the severity of the disease of the patient.    The ocular use will typically comprise topical application, of one to two drops (or an amount of a solid or semisolid dosage form) to the affected eye one  to four times per day. The dermal  use  will  typically  comprise  dermal  application  of an  ointment containing 0.1%  to   10.0%  of a compound of this invention.<br>
