RADIO COMMUNICATION IN A MULTI-RADIO LINK COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM<br>
Method for operating a radio communication in a multi-radio<br>
link communications system<br>
The invention relates to a method for operating a radio<br>
communication in a multi-radio link communications system<br>
having the generic features of patent claim 1, an apparatus of<br>
a multi-radio link communications system for performing such a<br>
method, and to a subscriber station for performing such a<br>
method.<br>
In order to increase the resource efficiency and quality of<br>
service when transmitting data via radio links, multi-radio<br>
link communications systems are being developed in which a<br>
single subscriber station can access different resources<br>
simultaneously in parallel by means of one or more suitable<br>
interfaces. In particular, the intention is to enable access to<br>
resources of radio communications systems which are<br>
technologically different in kind, such that the subscriber<br>
station can operate for example in parallel both a mobile radio<br>
communications link and a radio link to a local area network.<br>
In particular, in this case a subdivision of a sequence of<br>
mutually associated data, for example of a common service, is<br>
intended to be able to be transmitted in subdivided fashion via<br>
the different resources.<br>
In this case, the data are subdivided at the MAC or IP level<br>
(MAC: Media Access Control, IP: Internet Protocol), wherein MAC<br>
forms an interface between a logical link control and the<br>
physical layer of a network at a node and is configured<br>
differently<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 2 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
for different physical media. In particular, the metrics<br>
resulting from subdivision into radio channels, quality, data<br>
flow and operator requirements differ. Consequently, multi-<br>
radio link communications systems afford a diversity via<br>
different resources which enable radio accesses.<br>
In particular, three forms of transmission are planned. The<br>
first form consists in a so-called switched MRTD (Multi-Radio<br>
Transmission Diversity), wherein packets of a data flow are<br>
transmitted sequentially and alternatively via only one<br>
resource which is available for MRTD. In accordance with a<br>
second form, a so-called parallel MRTD, the packets of a data<br>
flow are transmitted simultaneously via a plurality of<br>
available resources, wherein each packet is transmitted only<br>
via a single one of the resources. In accordance with the third<br>
form, a parallel MRTD with redundancy takes place, wherein the<br>
packets of a data flow are transmitted simultaneously via the<br>
resources which are available for MRTD, and wherein a copy of<br>
each packet is additionally transmitted in parallel via all<br>
resources selected for MRTD.<br>
So-called multi-homing is generally known from J. Luo et al. ,<br>

Wireless Networks", Proc. of IEEE GlobeCom, Rio de Janeiro,<br>
December 1999.<br>
Present-day solutions for data transmission are costly with<br>
regard to power consumption and signaling complexity, however,<br>
in the case of such a system and access method. A subscriber<br>
station disadvantageously scans all of the available resources<br>
in the form of the different radio access possibilities and<br>
their actual sub-resources available within such resources,<br>
which necessitates a great deal of power and signaling<br>
complexity. In the case of, for example, a multi-radio link<br>
access network having two resources, e.g. GPRS (General Packet<br>
Radio Service) at 128 Kbps and WLAN (Wireless Local Area<br>
Network/radio-based local area network) at 37 Mbps effective<br>
net data rate, and with a mobile subscriber station which<br>
supports both resources, each data packet is transmitted<br>
alternatively via one resource of the two resources if switched<br>
MRTD is selected. If the intention is to carry out a file<br>
download from the internet to the mobile subscriber station,<br>
the advantage with regard to a performance gain through the use<br>
of GPRS in addition to WLAN is negligible, even if the costs of<br>
the switched MRTD, for example as a result of a switching<br>
delay, are negligible.<br>
Whenever available resources of a subscriber station offer<br>
different characteristics, for example 128 Kbps on a GPRS<br>
channel and 3 0 Mbps on a WLAN channel, there is the risk of the<br>
performance being impaired. The greater the difference in data<br>
rates between the resources used, the smaller the advantage<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 4 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
of the MRTD, which also has resources having a low data rate,<br>
with regard to the total data rate.<br>
In accordance with a second disadvantageous aspect, there is an<br>
increasing probability of a buffer overflow at the receiving<br>
subscriber station in the case of an increasingly larger data<br>
rate difference between the resources used, on account of a<br>
delay effect caused by the slow resource, if MAC segments/IP<br>
packets are re-requested in order to obtain them in the correct<br>
order at the receiver end. What is additionally disadvantageous<br>
is that a radio network subjected to a high degree of loading<br>
leads to a poor resource link on account of interference or a<br>
high dropout/blocking rate, which can be observed on the<br>
network or transport layer in the case of so-called ARMH<br>
(Adaptive Radio Multi-Homing) or IP layer multi-homing.<br>
The object of the invention is to improve a method for<br>
operating a radio communication in a multi-radio link<br>
communications systems in accordance with the MRTD concept, in<br>
particular, and to propose a suitable apparatus and a suitable<br>
subscriber station for carrying out such a method.<br>
This object is achieved by means of a method for operating a<br>
radio communication in a multi-radio link communications<br>
system, by means of an apparatus of a multi-radio link<br>
communications system for performing such a method, and also by<br>
means of a subscriber station having the features of the<br>
independent patent claims. Dependent patent claims relate to<br>
advantageous configurations.<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 5 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
Preference is accordingly given to a method for operating a<br>
radio communication in a multi-radio link communications<br>
system, wherein a network information item regarding available<br>
resources, which are available for transmitting data, is<br>
transmitted to network devices and/or to subscriber stations by<br>
means of a coordination device, wherein the network information<br>
item assigns the available resources to sets and the resources<br>
of different sets are assigned in accordance with at least in<br>
each case one common set property.<br>
Of advantageous embodiment is a method wherein the<br>

information content which deviates with respect to a network<br>
information item received by the subscriber station with regard<br>
to a resource availability detected by the subscriber station.<br><br>

Of advantageous embodiment is an apparatus wherein the control<br>
device is arranged in an independent coordination device<br>
designed for communicating with network devices of different<br>

of the different communications systems.<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 8 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
Of advantageous embodiment are a method and an apparatus<br>
wherein the different resources are radio resources of<br>
communications systems which are technologically different in<br>
kind, in particular the radio resources are assigned to mobile<br>
radio communications systems and/or local radio data networks.<br>
Of advantageous embodiment are a method and an apparatus<br>
wherein the different resources are different radio resources<br>
of an individual communications system.<br>
Of advantageous embodiment is a subscriber station of a multi-<br>
radio link communications system for performing such a method<br>
comprising an interface for transmitting a network information<br>
item regarding available resources from or to a network-side<br>
coordination device and for selecting at least two resources<br>
for a parallel transmission of data depending on a set of the<br>
transmitted sets which is selected by the subscriber station.<br>
In this case, transmitting data should be understood preferably<br>
to mean both sending and receiving data. Data can comprise user<br>
or useful data that are generally to be transmitted, but also<br>
signalings. The term resource should generally be understood to<br>
mean a radio link access possibility via an arbitrary available<br>
radio network and the transmission capacities associated<br>
therewith. Accordingly, available resources in the form of<br>
network accesses of radio access systems which are<br>
technologically different in kind are preferably taken into<br>
account. Independently of this, for individual applications,<br>
resources in the form of carriers of different types, such as<br>
e.g. frequencies, and diversity methods etc., of an individual<br>
communications system can also advantageously be employed for<br>
the implementation of<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 9 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
the method without necessarily having to access a resource of a<br>
technically different type of communications system.<br>
The available resources are preferably classified in sets,<br>
wherein the available resources are assigned to the sets of<br>
correspondingly common properties, such that a radio<br>
transmission possibility which is optimized with regard to the<br>
set property can be taken as a basis when resources of a set<br>
are accessed simultaneously. The available sets are<br>
communicated to a subscriber station as a network information<br>
item and said subscriber station can subsequently select a set<br>
suitable for its current purposes. In this case, it is also<br>
conceivable for the network to signal to the subscriber station<br>
which set said subscriber station is to select. For radio<br>
links, the subscriber station subsequently uses resources which<br>
are specified in the selected set.<br>
In this case, the set properties used as an assignment<br>
criterion can differ in their nature. A maximum MRTD data<br>
throughput is obtained if resources having identical<br>
characteristics, e.g. comparable data rates, are used for MRTD.<br>
Thus, by way of example, a subdivision according to<br>
transmission rates of the different resources can be performed,<br>
such that resources having a similar data rate which correspond<br>
to the requirements of the application to be transmitted are<br>
assigned to a set given high priority, while resources having a<br>
greatly different, in particular typically higher data rate are<br>
assigned to a set given low priority, in order e.g. to cover<br>
load spikes that occasionally occur.<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 10 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
As an alternative or in addition, however, it is also possible<br>
to use further criteria in the assignment of the resources to<br>
the sets as set properties. By way of example, a<br>
differentiation can be made as to whether the resource is a<br>
resource which is usually available supraregionally, e.g. a<br>
mobile radio communications system in accordance with e.g. GSM<br>
(Global System for Mobile Communication) or UMTS (Universal<br>
Mobile Telecommunications System), or is a resource which is<br>
only available regionally, e.g. a local area network in<br>
accordance with a WLAN or WiMAX standard. Consequently, a<br>
network availability or spatial network coverage can be taken<br>
into account.<br>
A further possible set property is e.g. the possibility of an<br>
authentication and authorization of the subscriber station with<br>
respect to network-side apparatuses, as in the case of mobile<br>
radio communications systems. When compiling the network<br>
information item in the form of the different sets, it is also<br>
possible to take account of a current network usage or<br>
individual contract options or authorizations of the respective<br>
communicating subscriber station. Accordingly, the network<br>
information item can be created individually for a subscriber<br>
station that logs onto the network or communicates with the<br>
network and can be transmitted to the subscriber station. The<br>
transmission of a general network information item to all the<br>
subscriber stations and a corresponding selection of an<br>
available set by the subscriber station on account of the<br>
latter's options and access rights are also possible.<br>
Ultimately, current speeds of a moving mobile subscriber<br>
station can also be taken into account in particular by the<br>
subscriber station since, in such a<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 11 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
case,  e.g.  the access to local data networks is only ever<br>
possible temporarily.<br>
A further advantageous utilization is afforded in the case of<br>
real-time data (RT) , on the one hand, and non-real-time data<br>
(NRT) , on the other hand, as in the case of an E-mail to be<br>
transmitted, if as real-time data e.g. a general header<br>
information item is forwarded via a mobile radio communications<br>
system for fast information to the subscriber station, while<br>
the attachment, i.e. the actual useful data are transmitted in<br>
parallel or, if appropriate, even only at a later point in time<br>
via a local area network - likewise connected to the internet -<br>
with a higher transmission rate or. more favorable transmission<br>
conditions. A further example of a scaleability as a service<br>
property is a transmission of image data which has been<br>
subjected e.g. to a discrete cosign transformation and compares<br>
contour information items as data given high priority and<br>
filling information such as color values as data given low<br>
priority. In such a case, too, it is appropriate to divide the<br>
totality of the data between two different resources in<br>
accordance with the prioritization, since the contour data<br>
given higher priority are of fundamental importance for an<br>
image reconstruction, while the filling data given low<br>
priority, if appropriate, can also be replaced by interpolation<br>
or, if necessary, can also be completely omitted.<br>
An exemplary embodiment is explained in more detail below with<br>
reference to the drawing, in which:<br>
Fig.l schematically shows apparatuses of communications<br>
systems which are technologically different in kind and<br>
a subscriber station<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 12 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
which carries out a radio communication simultaneously<br>
or in parallel by a plurality of resources offered in<br>
this way,<br>
Fig.2   shows, as network information items transmitted to the<br>
subscriber station, two tables with different sets of<br>
available resources, and<br>
Fig. 3   shows a subdivision into different types of sets and<br>
the updating cycles thereof.<br>
Figure 1 shows an exemplary subscriber station UT, which as a<br>
stationary or mobile apparatus with an interface I for radio-<br>
based access can access resources of different types for<br>
operating a radio communication in a multi-radio link<br>
communications system MRTD. In a customary manner the<br>
subscriber station UT has a control device C for controlling<br>
its functions and a memory device M for storing operationally<br>
relevant data and user data. Instead of a single interface I,<br>
it is also possible to provide a plurality of interfaces which<br>
are specifically tailored to the different technologies and<br>
which are then connected to one another or correspondingly<br>
driven via the control device C in order to carry out as<br>
required a simultaneous or parallel radio communication via two<br>
or more available resources AC1 - AC8. Optionally, it is also<br>
possible to choose just one available resource if a suitable<br>
second resource is not available or required.<br>
On the network side, the multi-radio link communications system<br>
MRTD has for example three technologically different radio<br>
communications systems. For a portion<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 13 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
of the radio communications systems, there are a plurality of<br>
logically or physically different access possibilities or<br>
resources to the respective technologically different radio<br>
communications systems in the current radio range of the<br>
subscriber station UT. By way of example, a central control<br>
device SGSN with a connected base station or radio interface nB<br>
operating in accordance with the UMTS standard is available in<br>
representative fashion for a first radio communications system.<br>
As a result, a first available resource AC1 is provided for the<br>
subscriber station UT for setting up a radio communications<br>
link with a first, very high data rate r3. In addition, by way<br>
of example, two central control devices BSC1, BSC2 with base<br>
stations or radio interfaces BS1 and BS2 correspondingly<br>
connected thereto in accordance with the mobile radio standard<br>
GSM are provided, which form two further available resources<br>
AC2, AC3 with a second, medium data rate r2 for the subscriber<br>
station UT. These first to third resources AC1 - AC3 are<br>
therefore resources which simultaneously enable an<br>
authentication and authorization during the logging-on of the<br>
subscriber station UT in the context of setting up a radio<br>
communications link. In addition, mobile radio networks of this<br>
type are usually available as supraregional and mainly full-<br>
coverage radio link communications systems.<br>
Local area networks in accordance with the WLAN standard are<br>
represented in a manner representative of a third technology of<br>
radio link communications systems, said networks predominantly<br>
being schematically depicted by in each case a server SI - S5<br>
and in each case an access point API - AP5 connected thereto.<br>
These offer the subscriber station UT, depending on the<br>
configuration, different data rates from a very high data rate<br>
r3 in the case of the second<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 14 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
access point AP2, a medium data rate r2 in the case of the<br>
fourth and the fifth access point AP5, and a low data rate rl<br>
in the case of the third and the first access point API.<br>
Depending on the current whereabouts, this means that for the<br>
subscriber station UT there are access possibilities to further<br>
fourth to eighth resources AC4 - AC8, which involve, for<br>
example, local radio link accesses without an authentication<br>
possibility and without an authorization possibility.<br>
In the illustrated exemplary embodiment of the multi-radio link<br>
communications system MRTD, a coordination device NMO as a<br>
physically and/or logically software-technologically configured<br>
network management operator in the form of an independent<br>
apparatus performs a coordination of the overall system. It is<br>
also possible to integrate such a coordination device into one<br>
of the exemplary communications systems or into one of the<br>
corresponding control devices or one of the servers. For<br>
coordinating the different resources ACl - AC8 available, the<br>
coordination device NMO has a link to the respective central<br>
control devices SGSN, BSCl, BSC2 and servers S2 - S5. According<br>
to the example illustrated, however, there is no direct link to<br>
the first server SI on the part of the coordination device NMO.<br>
The coordination device NMO coordinates the transmission of<br>
data between the different central control devices SGSN, BSCl,<br>
BSC2 and servers Si - S5 insofar as these can correspondingly<br>
access a database that can be accessed jointly. Such a database<br>
that can be accessed jointly may be for example a central<br>
memory device CM which can be accessed via<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 15 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
the internet IP and corresponding access links ip of the<br>
different radio link communications systems. As an alternative<br>
or in addition, the coordination device NMO directly<br>
coordinates the transmission of data between the different<br>
radio devices or radio control devices nB, BSl, BS2, API - AP5.<br>
This increases the MRTD gain further since the coordination<br>
device then lies closer to the radio interface. A multi-radio<br>
link base station with integrated coordination device is<br>
ideally provided for MRTD.<br>
For coordination purposes, signaling items and information<br>
items are transmitted between the different radio link<br>
communications systems and the coordination device NMO. In this<br>
case, the coordination device NMO receives first network<br>
information items il - i6, i8 from the radio link<br>
communications systems SGSN, BSC1, BSC2, AP2 - AP5, wherein the<br>
first network information items il - i6, i8 communicate<br>
availability information items and property information items<br>
of the respective radio link communications systems SGSN, BSCl,<br>
BSC2, AP2-AP5 to the coordination device NMO. The coordination<br>
device NMO transmits, for its part, to the radio link<br>
communications systems SGSN, BSCl, BSC2, AP2 - AP5 network<br>
information items for the control thereof and a network<br>
information item s for controlling the communicating subscriber<br>
station UT.<br>
The coordination device NMO advantageously has, in particular<br>
in the case of an independent coordination device, a control<br>
device C* for coordinating its operation and the communication<br>
with the different devices of the diverse communications<br>
systems and an interface I* for carrying out the communication<br>
with further<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 16 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
systems. Data which are relevant, or may be relevant if<br>
appropriate, with regard to the management of the diverse<br>
available resources for the coordination device NMO are stored<br>
in a memory M*. Information items with regard to services which<br>
a subscriber station UT can select are also advantageously<br>
stored in the memory M*. Resource-dependent information items<br>
are, for example, available data rates ri, rl - r3 of the<br>
resources. As service features, service properties ql, q2 of<br>
different types are stored in the memory M* such that the<br>
control device C* can access a multiplicity of criteria of<br>
different types in order to suitably assign the available<br>
resources AC1-AC8 to the available sets si - s4 according to a<br>
multiplicity of criteria. In this case, the sets can be<br>
provided uniformly for all the subscriber stations or else<br>
preferably specifically for individual subscriber stations UT.<br>
Figure 1 shows by way of example in tabular form the<br>
construction of a network information item s which is<br>
transmitted to the subscriber station UT at a starting instant<br>
tO and is intended to enable the subscriber station UT to<br>
access resources AC1 - AC8 that are currently suitable for the<br>
latter. The network information item s thus transmitted to the<br>
subscriber station UT comprises for example four sets si - s4<br>
with an assignment of the different resources ACi to in each<br>
case at least one of the sets si - s4. The table additionally<br>
illustrates two exemplary criteria for set properties according<br>
to which the coordination device NMO compiles the sets si - s4.<br>
By way of example, the first set si given the highest priority<br>
is assigned the first and the fourth resource ACI, AC4,<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 17 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
which both offer a very high data rate r3, wherein as a<br>
requirement with regard to a service property QoS, ql on the<br>
part of the coordination device NMO an assignment to this first<br>
set si is effected only if at least one resource AC1 enables an<br>
authentication of the subscriber station UT. When said first<br>
set si is selected, the subscriber station UT can<br>
correspondingly communicate via the first and via the fourth<br>
resource AC1, AC4 in parallel with one another, wherein data<br>
can be transmitted in accordance with UMTS and in accordance<br>
with WLAN, respectively.<br>
A second set s2 is formed from the second, third and sixth<br>
resources AC2, AC3, AC6, which offer a medium data rate r2 and<br>
likewise at least one authentication possibility. Accordingly,<br>
the subscriber station UT can access three of the available<br>
resources when the second set s2 is selected. A third set s3 is<br>
assigned to the sixth and the eighth resource AC6, AC8, which<br>
offer a medium data rate r2 and are classified as quality of<br>
service q2 as local area networks. The latter enable a<br>
generally more cost-effective access than mobile radio<br>
networks. A fourth set s4 with the criterion of the low data<br>
rate rl is only assigned the fifth resource AC5 of the third<br>
local area network s3. The seventh resource AC7 was disregarded<br>
when forming the set si - s4 for lack of a direct link for<br>
exchanging first network information items i7 between the first<br>
server SI and the coordination device NMO.<br>
After logging on at one of the radio interfaces BS2, the<br>
network information item s created at the coordination device<br>
NMO is transmitted to the subscriber station UT via said radio<br>
interface or base station BS2 at the starting instant<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 18 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
tO. Depending on the configuration and requirements, the<br>
subscriber station UT thereupon selects resources of one of the<br>
sets for its subsequent communication, in order to communicate<br>
as required via one or in parallel a plurality of said<br>
resources.<br>
By way of example, data of a retrievable E-mail are ready for<br>
the subscriber station UT in the central memory device CM, the<br>
E-mail system representing a first exemplary service D. In this<br>
case, the data paraded at a first instant tl are formed from<br>
two different data portions dl, d2, which ultimately belong<br>
together. The first data portion dl is a header information<br>
item hd - to be transmitted as rapidly as possible to the<br>
subscriber station UT - with basic data that supply information<br>
about the existence of a retrievable E-mail. The second data<br>
portion d2 comprises actual useful data and attachments, which<br>
often constitute a relatively large volume of data. Preferably,<br>
the first data portions dl are correspondingly transmitted via<br>
the mobile radio components of the selected second set, that is<br>
to say via the third resource AC3.<br>
Consequently, an item of information that an E-mail is<br>
retrievable is present in the subscriber station UT at a second<br>
instant t2, if appropriate items of information about the<br>
sender, a subject information item and optionally an access key<br>
already being present as well. In parallel with the<br>
transmission of the first data portions dl or at a possibly<br>
also later instant t3, the subscriber station UT retrieves the<br>
actual data as the second data portions d2 via a local area<br>
network, for which purpose, in the second and selected set s2,<br>
a corresponding access to the sixth resource AC6 and via that<br>
to the central memory device CM<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 19 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
is carried out. Optionally, the retrieval can also be effected<br>
at a later instant if a suitable local area network is not<br>
currently available and if for the data retrieval there is<br>
enough time until a suitable local area network is reached. It<br>
is also possible to select for the retrieval of a large volume<br>
of data a resource of a set si given higher priority or for the<br>
retrieval of a small volume of data a set s4 given lower<br>
priority, and correspondingly assigned resources.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in figure 1, at a<br>
fourth instant t4 the subscriber station UT passes into the<br>
radio range of the first local area network with the first<br>
access point API, which offers the seventh resource AC7. In an<br>
advantageous manner, after possibly an information exchange<br>
with the first server SI, the subscriber station UT recognizes<br>
that said server enables a possibility of access to the<br>
internet IP and the central memory device CM, but is not listed<br>
in the network information item s which was previously provided<br>
by the coordination device NMO and received at the starting<br>
instant tO. At a fifth instant t5, the subscriber station UT<br>
correspondingly communications a further network information<br>
item i7, which is transmitted to the coordination device NMO<br>
via the currently existing second resource AC2 and the . first<br>
mobile radio system. After receiving said further network<br>
information item i7, the coordination device NMO creates an<br>
updated network information item s and transmits the latter, at<br>
a seventh instant t7, to the diverse connected systems and in<br>
particular the subscriber station UT. If the subscriber station<br>
UT has not itself already performed a suitable assignment of<br>
the seventh resource AC to the suitable sets si - s4, such that<br>
the new seventh resource AC7 can also be taken into<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 20 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
account, after receiving the updated network information item s<br>
the subscriber station UT can also access the newly available<br>
seventh resource AC7. Since the seventh resource AC7 is a local<br>
area network having the low data rate rl, this is assigned to<br>
the fourth set s4.<br>
In addition, by way of example, at a sixth instant t6, that is<br>
to say before the transmission of the updated network<br>
information item s, a failure of the second local area network<br>
with the fourth resource AC4 has occurred, which has been<br>
conveyed by means of a corresponding further network<br>
information item i4 or a lack of a corresponding communication<br>
of the coordination device NMO. The possibility of access to<br>
the fourth resource, that is to say to the access point AP2 of<br>
the second local area network, is correspondingly omitted in<br>
the first set si.<br>
Figure 2 shows, in addition to a table of the network<br>
information item s transmitted at the starting instant tO, a<br>
second table having the described updated network information<br>
item s transmitted at the seventh instant t7. Besides an<br>
updating of the network information item s in the case of<br>
changes, an updating can advantageously be carried out<br>
automatically at regular time intervals. In this case, the set<br>
information items of the sets si, s2 given higher priority are<br>
advantageously to be updated at shorter time intervals than the<br>
set information items of the sets s3, s4 given lower priority.<br>
Such a method procedure and corresponding apparatuses and<br>
subscriber stations offer an optimization of MRTD performance<br>
whilst at the same time reducing the power consumption without<br>
a significant increase in a control signaling by transmission<br>
of network information items<br><br>
PCT7EP2006/065598	- 21 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
s, il - i8 and without significant changes in the software of<br>
suitable subscriber stations UT.<br>
The possibility of the use of MRTD by mobile subscriber<br>
stations UT, in particular, is advantageously possible wherever<br>
different resources having typically different profiles and/or<br>
characteristics are available, an efficient selection of<br>
transmission modes of the resources currently available being<br>
offered according to the method.<br>
Consequently, what is introduced is a subscriber- and service-<br>
class-based approach for selecting the most suitable resources<br>
and transmission modes for MRTD, such that a best possible MRTD<br>
utilization can be obtained with regard, in particular, to the<br>
throughput. Moreover, if a suitable MRTD transmission operating<br>
mode is selected, virtually similar resource channels can be<br>
formed for each subscriber station in order to be able to<br>
obtain optimum MRTD advantages with regard to the overall<br>
system and the respective subscriber even in traffic cells<br>
having high usage.<br>
An operator or the coordination device NMO advantageously<br>
offers different subscriber classes with service-specific<br>
performance characteristics and guarantees, an adaptation to<br>
the respective currently available and accessible heterogeneous<br>
mobile infrastructure elements being carried out. A<br>
preselection of resources and transmission modes is obtained, a<br>
best possible adaptation being sought with regard to the<br>
individual subscribers or subscriber stations, traffic and<br>
service profiles. Resources having on average similar<br>
performance characteristics for MRTD are advantageous for<br>
advantageously<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 22 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
configuring a multi-radio link cooperation. Preferably,<br>
virtually similar resources are taken for MRTD, which leads to<br>
an increased total MRTD gain. This holds true particularly when<br>
the remaining capacity of the high-performance resources is<br>
used for other traffic in the case of a high-load situation. A<br>
definition of subscriber and service classes which can be<br>
obtained by means of an optimizing MRTD performance<br>
correspondingly takes place in coordination with a network<br>
planning and a multi-radio link resource management.<br>
For the selection of suitable resources and transmission modes<br>
for MRTD, it is possible advantageously to carry out the<br>
following general steps in association with mechanisms for a<br>
carrier service and RRM (radio resource management).<br>
In accordance with a first aspect, a so-called service level<br>
agreement (SLA) is defined between a subscriber or the<br>
subscriber station UT thereof and the coordination device NMO,<br>
a mapping onto the subscriber station or the user thereof being<br>
performed, and the availability of dedicated multiple resources<br>
and the cooperation thereof being examined. In accordance with<br>
a second aspect, the sets si - s4 of the resources ACl - AC8<br>
are formed and transmission modes and timescales in this regard<br>
are selected for MRTD.<br>
Preferably, as can also be seen from figure 3, two types of<br>
sets for the resources and three MRTD transmission modes are<br>
defined as follows. With regard to the two types of sets, e.g.<br>
a candidate set is formed as candidate radio access set or<br>
candidate resource<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 23 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
set and an active set is formed as a further resource or radio<br>
access set. The candidate set is preferably assigned all<br>
resources for radio accesses which, at the location of the<br>
subscriber station UT, fulfill a minimum required average<br>
signal quality and the sufficient likelihood of a connectivity<br>
and which can be registered by a common radio resource<br>
management with regard to a long-term existence. The active set<br>
is preferably defined by means of the common radio resource<br>
management from all radio accesses or resources which are<br>
contained in the candidate radio access set. The active set is<br>
preferably in turn subdivided into an active primary set of<br>
resources and into a secondary set of resources, wherein in<br>
this regard a high and respectively a medium timescale with<br>
regard to updatings are fixed.<br>
With regard to the transmission modes, in particular a<br>
redundant parallel MRTD with a parallel transmission of packets<br>
which are assigned to a dataflow, a switched MRTD with<br>
exclusive transmission per packet of the data and point in time<br>
via a single one of the resources available from the active<br>
set, and a parallel MRTD with an alternating simultaneous<br>
transmission of packets which are assigned to a dataflow can be<br>
taken into account, wherein this is implemented in particular<br>
with regard to the primary active resource set.<br>
Preferably, the updating period of the candidate set is greater<br>
than that of the active set. Within the period between<br>
updatings of the candidate set for the individual subscriber<br>
stations, the coordination device NMO or the subscriber<br>
stations UT can preferably<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 24 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
monitor the performance of the active resources in order to<br>
access the optimum resources. The monitoring frequency for the<br>
active primary set and the transmission mode to be selected<br>
should preferably correspond at least to the setting of the<br>
superordinate updating frequency.<br>
In accordance with the preferred embodiment, the transmission<br>
mode that is preferably to be selected is updated preferably at<br>
an interval as short as or shorter than an updating period of<br>
the active primary set. The updating period of the latter is<br>
preferably in turn less than the updating period of the active<br>
secondary set, with the result that the active primary set is<br>
updated more frequently. Preferably, the updating period of the<br>
secondary active set is less than the updating period of the<br>
active set and the latter is in turn preferably less than the<br>
updating period of the candidate set.<br>
The radio access or resources groups and the transmission modes<br>
can be selected in various ways. In accordance with a first<br>
exemplary selection possibility, an active resource<br>
preselection is carried out dynamically for a subscriber<br>
station UT taking account of a service class of the subscriber<br>
station UT, which defines access possibilities, applications<br>
and access rights. In addition, cost-benefit functions (CBF)<br>
are taken into account, which are primarily based on an<br>
individual resource profile, that is to say which take account<br>
of e.g. a maximum acceptable movement speed of the subscriber<br>
station UT and a spatial coverage capacity with regard to a<br>
stable profile in order to form the candidate set individually<br>
if appropriate for said subscriber station. Moreover,<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 25 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
the cost-benefit function metric is based inter alia on an<br>
average load and a likelihood of the offered conductivity of<br>
the candidate radio access systems on which the resources are<br>
offered. In this case, dynamic profiles are used to form the<br>
active sets from the resources of the candidate sets.<br>
Preferably, for subscriber stations UT having high mobility,<br>
systems having only local presence such as wireless local area<br>
networks WLAN are rated lower than resources represented<br>
supraregionally, such as, for example access possibilities to<br>
mobile radio networks in accordance with GSM. This takes<br>
account of the fact that a continuous link with a lower rate in<br>
the case, in particular, of a rapidly spatially moving<br>
subscriber station UT is often more favorable with regard to<br>
the total throughput than an access to wireless local area<br>
networks WLAN that are in each case accessible only for a short<br>
time.<br>
In the course of the active resource preselection, preferably<br>
the following rules are used for generating the CBF metrics for<br>
the resources. Thus, a resource which offers an optimum quality<br>
of service QoS is rated with the highest metric, for example is<br>
rated with a 1 in the case of a normalization. The metrics for<br>
other resources are normalized in accordance with this metric.<br>
The optimum quality of service QoS is determined for example by<br>
a call blocking rate, a bit error rate, a delay factor and the<br>
like. In an advantageous manner, mutually similar performances<br>
of different resources are rated with a relatively high metric<br>
with respect to one another. Correspondingly, resources having<br>
a performance with limited similarity are preferably assigned<br>
as a set property of a respective common set since experience<br>
shows that the best results can be obtained for the subscriber<br>
station UT if the latter, when<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 26 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
using a plurality of resources for setting up radio links,<br>
accesses resources having comparable conditions for the<br>
transmission. Preferably, a resource adaptation to the<br>
respective service and the mobility of the subscriber station<br>
UT is also rated with a high metric. A wireless local area<br>
network WLAN having only small spatial coverage is rated with a<br>
low metric for a highly mobile subscriber or for the subscriber<br>
station thereof. Resource-specific costs such as, for example,<br>
a delay on account of an access reselection for a specific<br>
cooperating active set and with regard to a required signaling<br>
complexity are preferably likewise taken into account.<br>
Two levels of subsets are preferably classified within the<br>
active set, wherein the classification is in turn preferably<br>
carried out by a common radio resource management by means of<br>
the coordination device NMO, for example. The active primary<br>
set and the active secondary set are correspondingly formed.<br>
Preferably, a channel status information item of the active<br>
primary set is evaluated with the highest frequency and a<br>
channel status information item, for example by measuring a<br>
pilot channel, of the active secondary set is evaluated by a<br>
measurement with lower frequency. The candidate set is updated<br>
with the lowest frequency due to the availability of all<br>
resources present in principle.<br>
Figure 3 shows in this regard five exemplary resources which<br>
are supported by the subscriber station UT. It schematically<br>
depicts the described subdivision and assignment of exemplary<br>
available resource configurations A - E which can be accessed<br>
by the subscriber station UT.<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 27 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
The assignments to updating intervals are represented against a<br>
scale with advancing time t. In this case, the report or<br>
updating period of the primary set si, s2 is schematically<br>
depicted as the shortest updating period tp. An updating period<br>
ts of the secondary set s3 is the next longer. An updating<br>
period ta of the entire active set si - s3 is even longer and<br>
an updating period tc for the entire candidate set si - s4 is<br>
the longest.<br>
At a first instant, the primary active set si, s2 comprises, in<br>
the first subset si thereof, a second configuration B formed<br>
from specific resources from among the resources with an<br>
identical set property or with an approximately comparable set<br>
property. The second subset s2 of the primary active set si, s2<br>
is formed by a third configuration C after the time 2-tp. The<br>
active secondary set s3 is formed by a first configuration A at<br>
the first instant and a fourth configuration D is provided as<br>
fourth available set s4.<br>
At a second instant after the elapsing of the first updating<br>
period tp for the active primary set si, s2 only the<br>
configurations thereof are updated. In the exemplary embodiment<br>
illustrated, no change arose. As can be discerned from the<br>
section encircled by a broken line, this results in an optimum<br>
transmission scheme selection between the channel status<br>
information items with respect to the primary active set si,<br>
s2. After the elapsing of the updating period ts of the<br>
secondary set s3, which corresponds to the representation of<br>
the third column, for example image<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 28 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
data are updated as parameters of a carrier service of a<br>
higher-layer protocol. At this point in time it is possible for<br>
the secondary set s3 to carry the subscriber traffic. After the<br>
elapsing of the updating period ta for the entire active set<br>
si - s3, changes with regard to the configurations occurred in<br>
the exemplary embodiment illustrated. The first subset si of<br>
the primary active set si, s2 now contains the first<br>
configuration A, the active secondary set s3, formed by the<br>
third available set, now contains the fourth configuration D,<br>
while the second configuration B is only assigned as the<br>
slowest link to the fourth set s4. After the updating period tc<br>
of the entire candidate set si - s4, a re-evaluation and<br>
updating of the configurations for the various sets si - s4<br>
once again takes place. Instead of the first configuration A, a<br>
new configuration E now appears as a fifth conceivable<br>
configuration, by way of example.<br>
Within the state duration of the active primary sets si, s2, a<br>
rapid changeover can be effected between different MRTD<br>
transmission modes, in particular between redundant parallel<br>
MRTD, switched MRTD and parallel MRTD. The optimum MRTD<br>
operating mode selection is based in particular on the current<br>
channel status information from the primary resources and from<br>
the system requirements and thus from the current result of the<br>
cost-benefit function.<br>
The following exemplary rules for MRTD transmission modes can<br>
be used taking account of corresponding timescales for a time<br>
planning. By way of example, minimum signal-to-noise values of<br>
the resources, which<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 29 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
are incorporated in MRTD in particular as special values, can<br>
be used in order to decide on a transmission that can be<br>
carried out. Resources having a current signal-to-noise ratio<br>
below the thresholds lead to an excessively high bit error<br>
rate. In an advantageous manner, the subscriber station UT can<br>
report signal-to-noise values of the resources ACl - AC8 back<br>
to the coordination device NMO, this preferably does not take<br>
place more slowly than the channel changes take place, and<br>
taking account of the coherence time in order to choose an<br>
optimum MRTD mode. If the current signal-to-noise value is<br>
dominated by one of the resources, the switched MRTD mode is<br>
chosen, in which successive data are optionally received by one<br>
of  a plurality of  available  resources,  namely  the  most<br>
favorable resource. If the current signal-to-noise values of<br>
all of the resources are greater than the minimum threshold<br>
value for parallel MRTD, which is required for each specific<br>
individual resource, the parallel MRTD mode is chosen taking<br>
account of the total usage of the resource used and the<br>
operator's business policy, wherein one portion of the data is<br>
received via a first resource and another portion of the data<br>
is received via a second resource. If the current signal-to-<br>
noise values of all of the resources are indeed comparable but<br>
lower than the minimum threshold value for parallel MRTD, and<br>
if data given high priority are to be transmitted, redundant<br>
parallel  MRTD  is  chosen,  wherein  all  of  the  data  are<br>
transmitted in parallel via a plurality of the available<br>
resources. In this case, specific costs of the transmission<br>
operating mode can also be taken into account, for example a<br>
delay on account of an access reselection for a specific<br>
cooperating active  resource  set  and a required signaling<br>
overloading.<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 30 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
The active second set s3 is preferably likewise assigned to a<br>
high-layer link and serves for a potentially high peak<br>
throughput for elastic or variable traffic or for a low<br>
connectivity, wherein local area networks, for example, are<br>
switched in.<br>
As a further additional or alternative selection possibility,<br>
active resources for a terminal or a subscriber station can be<br>
updated from time to time, for example for adaptation to load<br>
changes of the resources.<br>
A further possible selection criterion consists in monitoring<br>
further resources, not contained in the candidate set, with a<br>
preferably even lower temporal frequency, in order to conserve<br>
the battery of the subscriber station UT and to reduce a<br>
signaling overhead. After such a further resource has been<br>
detected, the subscriber station UT can forward corresponding<br>
information items to the coordination device.<br>
It is possible for the links between the primary active set si,<br>
s2 and the secondary active set s3 to change back and forth. If<br>
this occurs, in particular services of higher layers, for<br>
example a source coding of a video codec, of another<br>
communication partner are advantageously reconfigured for a<br>
better-suited service. In this case, it is possible to use<br>
either a remote server or a base station for a downlink or for<br>
an uplink of the subscriber station UT.<br>
Whenever new services are introduced or employed, the active<br>
set si - s3 is advantageously likewise<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 31 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
updated. If, by way of example, the subscriber station UT<br>
changes the service from a real-time voice service to a<br>
temporally unrestricted data service, e.g. a resource having a<br>
high data rate but small coverage such as a local area network<br>
can be allocated in order to obtain a higher metric, the rank<br>
of the active resource set being updated.<br>
In an advantageous manner, transmission diversity problems as a<br>
result of new assignment delays of packets on account of<br>
excessively large differences in the transmission speeds of<br>
arbitrarily selected resources and a possible buffer memory<br>
overflow at the receiver are reduced by performing the<br>
selection of active resource sets and transmission modes with<br>
restricted performance differences. Correspondingly, an<br>
assignment of resources with comparable resource properties as<br>
set property is particularly advantageous in order to increase<br>
the reliability of the transmission via a plurality of<br>
resources in parallel with one another.<br>
Three particular novel features should be emphasized in the<br>
context of the preferred method procedure. In accordance with a<br>
first aspect, a profile-based selection of a resource set for a<br>
multi-operating-mode terminal as a subscriber station takes<br>
place on the basis of CBF metrics taking account of the MRTD<br>
transmission modes of the resources, wherein in particular the<br>
subdivision into the candidate set si - s4, the active primary<br>
set si, s2 and the active secondary set s3 is taken into<br>
account as resource set. If a reconfiguration of the links<br>
between the active primary set si, s2 and the active secondary<br>
set s3 takes place, this triggers a protocol-layer-overarching<br>
signaling between different protocol layers and/or<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 32 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
a signaling between nodes of a respective one of the systems<br>
with regard to an optimum service.<br>
In accordance with a second aspect to the emphasized, different<br>
updating rates are chosen for different layers of the resource<br>
sets in order to reduce battery power and radio signaling.<br>
In accordance with the third aspect,  a preferably optimum<br>
transmission node is chosen within the primary active set si,<br>
s2.<br>
A multi-radio link access network with two resources is<br>
considered by way of example below. The first resource is<br>
formed by a packet data network based on the GPRS standard at<br>
12 8 Kbps, and the second resource is formed by a local area<br>
network having high usage and an effective net data rate of 37<br>
Mbps and a free capacity of 220 kbps. Moreover, the subscriber<br>
station is assumed to be a mobile terminal which supports these<br>
two resources and has a service class of 300 kbps for a data<br>
download in accordance with a contract with the coordination<br>
device. In such a case, MRTD is selected via both resources,<br>
such that data packets are transmitted simultaneously,<br>
alternatively or redundantly via both resources in order to<br>
achieve overall 3 00 kbps during the download phase of the file.<br>
Preferably, the transmission mode chosen is the parallel MRTD<br>
mode, which is made possible on account of the available radio<br>
resources.<br>
In accordance with another example, an operator offers a mobile<br>
radio infrastructure based on the UMTS standard and a peak data<br>
rate of 2 Mbps, a high-speed<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 33 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
downlink packet data access with a peak data rate of 10 Mbps<br>
and a local radio data network according to the WiMAX standard<br>
with a peak data rate of 15 Mbps. The operator additionally<br>
offers different subscriber classes having different charges.<br>
Furthermore, the existence of a specific subscriber class which<br>
offers an average file download rate of e.g. 7 68 kbps is<br>
assumed by way of example. If a nomadic subscriber who has<br>
registered for this class would like to download data from the<br>
internet by means of his multi-radio link subscriber station at<br>
a location at which all resources are available with average<br>
signal-to-noise- values, the operator will firstly choose the<br>
high-speed downlink packet access and a local area network on<br>
account of the high performance comparability thereof.<br>
Secondly, for instance similar resources, offering on average<br>
3 84 kbps, from both resources, the high-speed downlink packet<br>
access and the local radio data network, are chosen in order to<br>
download the datastream and to enable an average data rate of<br>
768 kbps using parallel MRTDs. In this way, the operator of the<br>
subscriber station can offer the maximum possible gain of MRTD<br>
with regard to radio link efficiency, robustness and<br>
performance gain.<br>
The following advantages should be emphasized. A maximum<br>
performance advantage of MRTD with regard to the combination of<br>
different types of resources can be achieved. This is made<br>
possible since an inherent MRTD performance deterioration at<br>
the radio interface, which would arise through the use of<br>
resources having different performance characteristics, is<br>
avoided. The likelihood of a packet loss on account of a buffer<br>
memory overflow at the receiver on account of a delay which can<br>
arise<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065598	- 34 -<br>
2005P12492WOUS<br>
as a result of slower resources is furthermore avoided. The<br>
likelihood of segments or packets becoming disordered is also<br>
reduced. MRTD offers various modes: a switched mode, a parallel<br>
mode and a parallel-redundant mode. The use of simultaneously<br>
an active resource set and a transmission mode selection<br>
enables an additional diversity gain in the parallel-redundant<br>
mode, a multiplex gain in the case of a parallel operating mode<br>
for the traffic and also a grouping gain in the parallel mode<br>
and in the switched mode. The battery consumption of the<br>
subscriber station and a signaling overloading are<br>
significantly reduced since the candidate resource set<br>
comprising all available resources is subdivided into a<br>
plurality of accessible sets with resources which have in each<br>
case at least one common set property. In particular, a primary<br>
active resource set and a secondary resource set are<br>
advantageously introduced.<br><br>
