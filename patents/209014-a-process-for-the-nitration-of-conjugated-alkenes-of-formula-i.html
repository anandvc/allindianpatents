The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of nitroalkenes and, more<br>
particularly, it relates to a process for the preparation of conjugated p-nitroalkenes by reaction<br>
of a conjugated alkene with a nitrite in the presence of iodine and of an oxidising agent.<br>
Conjugated p-nitroalkenes are widely used synthetic intermediates because they can be easily<br>
converted into a variety of different compounds. For example, we can cite p-nitrostyrene,<br>
useful intermediate for the preparation of several phenylethylamines and fungicides (Chemical<br>
Abstracts, vol.  118, no. 38576k), 2-nitro-dihydronaphthalenes, key intermediates for the<br>
synthesis of 2-amino-tetrahydronaphthalenes (Debasis Ghosh et al. Synthesis, 1996, pages<br>
195-197) and 8-fluoro-3-nitro-2H-chromene-5-carboxyUc acid amide, an intermediate for the<br>
preparation   of   (i?)-3-dicyclobutylamino-8-fluoro-chroman-5-carboxylic    acid    amide,    a<br>
compound useful in the treatment of disorders of the central nervous system (WO 98/46586 -<br>
Astra Aktiebolag).<br>
The nitration of alkenes with nitrites and iodine is known in the literature [Hassner et al,     J.<br>
Org. Chem., 1969, 34(9), pages 2628-2632].<br>
The mediod foresees the use of a mixture of silver nitrite and iodine as nitrating agent.<br>
After the paper of Hassner et al, some papers were pubUshed with the attempt of improving<br>
the nitration conditions.<br>
Wing-Wah Sy et al [Tetr. Lett., 1985, 26(9), pages 1193-1196] describe the nitration of<br>
substituted alkenes with silver nitrite and iodine, the only difference from Hassner et al being<br>
the use of a higher molar amount of silver nitrite, which is then equimolar with respect to the<br>
iodine.<br>
Jew et al [Chemistry Letters, 1986, pages 1747-1748] replace silver nitrite with sodium<br>
nitrite and use 2 moles of iodine and 4 moles of nitrite per mole of styrene, respectively.<br>
In the already cited paper published by Debasis Ghosh et al potassium nitrite is used in the<br>
presence of a phase transfer catalyst and by treating with ultrasounds in order to increase the<br>
solubility of the nitrite ion. Different amounts of iodine were evaluated to optimise the yield<br>
and the reported general method foresees the use of 2.6 moles of nitrite and 2.75 moles of<br><br>
iodine per mole of alkene, respectively.<br>
Then it is evident that the methods for the nitration of alkenes described in the literature show<br>
the relevant drawback of using high amounts of iodine which remarkably decrease the reaction<br>
productivity because of the high molecular weight of iodine, make the subsequent treatment<br>
with bisulphites, for transforming all the iodine in excess into iodides at the end of the<br>
reaction, particularly cumbersome and suffer from the problem of the removal of iodides from<br>
the waste waters.<br>
We have now found that the amount of iodine to be used for the nitration of conjugated<br>
alkenes can be significantly decreased by adding an oxidazing agent to the reaction mixture<br>
containing the alkene, the nitrite and iodine.<br>
Therefore, object of the present invention is a process for the nitration of conjugated alkenes<br>
of formula<br>
wherein <br>
R is a hydrogen atom, an optionally substituted phenyl, a linear or branched C1-C4 alkyl; R1 is a hydrogen atom or a linear or branched C1-C4 alkyl, optionally substituted by an OH or C1-C4 alkoxy group; R2, R3 and R4, the same or different, are selected among hydrogen and halogen atoms, linear or branched C1-C4 alkyl or alkoxy groups, carboxylic groups, aminocarbonyl groups, alkyloxycarbonyl, alkylcarbonyl, mono- or di-alkylaminocarbonyl, alkylcarbonylamino and alkylcarbonyloxy groups having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety; or two of R2, R3 and R4, in ortho between them, form a methylendioxy group; or R1 together with R2 forms a cyclic system with 5-7 terms condensed with the aromatic ring and optionally containing an oxygen atom; or R1 together with R forms a cyclic system with 5-7 terms; which allows to obtain P-nitro-alkenes of formula<br><br><br>
Preferred examples of the compounds of formula I are styrenes optionally substituted on the aromatic ring by from 1 to 3 methoxy groups or by a methylenedioxy group, dihydronaphthalenes optionally substituted by methoxy, methyl, ethyl, fluoro, chJoro, bromo, iodo, carboxy, methoxycarbonyl groups or by a methylenedioxy group or benzopyranes optionally substituted by methoxy, methyl, ethyl, fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo, carboxy, methoxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl or methylaminocarbonyl groups. Particularly preferred are the nitration of the compounds of formula<br><br><br>
wherein<br>
R3A and R4A, the same or different, are hydrogen atoms, methoxy, methyl, ethyl, fluoro,<br>
chloro, bromo, iodo, carboxy, methoxycarbonyl groups or, together, form a methylenedioxy<br>
group; R has the already reported meanings;<br>
and the nitration of the compounds of formula<br><br><br>
Examples of inorganic nitrites which can be used in the process object of the present invention<br>
are silver nitrite, sodium nitrite and potassium nitrite.<br>
Preferably sodium nitrite is used.<br>
The amount of nitrite is in excess with respect to the compound of formula I, generally not<br>
lower than 2 moles per moie of compound to be nitrated.<br>
Preferably an amount of nitrite from 2 and 4 moles per mole of compound of formula I is<br>
used.<br>
The most characterising feature of the present process is represented by the amount of iodine<br>
which is used.<br>
In feet, the presence of an oxidising agent allows to significantly decrease the amount of<br>
iodine up to an amount generally equal or lower than 1 mole per mole of compound of formula<br>
I, preferably from 0.1 and 0.8 moles per mole of substrate to be nitrated.<br>
As already underlined, the remarkable decrease of the amount of iodine necessary to carry out<br>
the nitration gives to the process object of the present invention the advantages related to the<br>
increased productivity and to the higher simplicity of the work-up of the reaction mixture.<br>
This is mainly in the final treatment to remove the iodine still present, which is generally<br>
carried out with bisulphite, but which can be also avoided in the process object of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The advantages of the process object of the present invention are particularly evident by<br>
comparing the nitration reported in example 2 and the nitration carried out according to the<br>
prior art on the same substrate, as reported in the already cited WO 98/46586 (see in<br>
particular the example on page 12).<br>
In fact, by working according to the method object of the present invention the nitroderivative<br>
is obtained with a practically triplicate yield.<br>
Generally, the oxidation agent is slowly added, usually in 3-4 hours, to the reaction mixture<br>
containing the nitrite, iodine and the compound of formula I.<br>
A hypothesis on the role of the oxidant is that of oxidising the iodides formed in the reaction<br>
mixture according to the following scheme<br><br><br>
wherein AlkH represents the compound of formula I,<br>
so forming an amount of iodine which is sufficient to go on with the nitration reaction.<br>
A further advantage is represented by the fact that, by using an oxidising agent, the iodine can<br>
also be prepared in situ by oxidation of iodides. Iodides which can be used for such purposes<br>
are generally alkali metal iodides, preferably potassium iodide.<br>
Specific examples of oxidising agents which can be used in the process object of the pfesent<br>
invention are peracids such as peracetic acid and m-chloroperbenzoic acid, oxygen peroxide<br>
and inorganic nitrites, optionally in admixture each other.<br>
It is evident that when an inorganic nitrite is used as oxidant agent, the same inorganic nitrite<br>
which is present in the nitrating mixture will be preferably used.<br>
The oxidising agent must be used in an acid environment, preferably at a pH lower than 5.<br>
Then, depending on the selected oxidant, it could be necessary also the addition of an<br>
acidifying agent to bring the pH up to the desired value.<br>
Then, when peracids such as peracetic acid which is not sufficiently acid are used, it will be<br>
suitable to use the oxidant in solution with an acid solvent, preferably acetic acid. In a similar<br>
way, when oxygen peroxide or an inorganic nitrite are used as oxidising agent, acetic acid will<br>
be preferably used.<br>
The use of a mixture of peracetic acid, oxygen peroxide, acetic acid and water, already<br>
available on the market (Oxistrong® - Ausimont) is particularly advantageous.<br>
It is evident that the amount of oxidant will be in relation to the used amount of iodine,<br>
preferably in slight excess. When the iodides are used to form iodine directly in the reaction<br>
medium, a higher amount of oxidant will be needed to allow the initial oxidation of the iodides.<br>
The process object of the present invention is carried out in the presence of a suitable organic<br>
solvent which is selected in relation to the solubility of the compound of formula I but which is<br>
not a critical parameter for the achievement of the process.<br>
Examples of suitable solvents are esters such as ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate and isobutyl<br>
acetate, aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene, chlorinated hydrocarbons such as<br>
methylene chloride and 1,2-dichloropropane and ethers such as tert-butyl methyl ether.<br>
When the reaction mixture contains water, the addition of a phase transfer catalyst can be<br><br>
useful.<br>
Also the temperature is not a critical parameter. Preferably temperatures from 20°C to 70°C<br>
are used. A still more preferred temperature range is from 40°C to 50°C.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the process object of the present invention is the following.<br>
Iodine and then, slowly, a solution of the oxidising agent are added to a mixture of the alkene<br>
of formula I and of sodium nitrite in a suitable organic solvent. At the end of the addition and<br>
at the completion of the reaction, an aqueous solution of sodium metabisulphite is optionally<br>
added up to decoloration of the iodine and the compound of formula II is separated according<br>
to usual techniques.<br>
In order to better illustrate the present invention the following examples are now given.<br>
