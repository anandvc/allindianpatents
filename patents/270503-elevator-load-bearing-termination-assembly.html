				<td>ELEVATOR LOAD BEARING TERMINATION ASSEMBLY<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention generally relates to static connector systems. More particularly, this invention relates to a device for securing an end of a load bearing arrangement.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Elevator systems typically include some form of load bearing member, such as roping or a belt for supporting and moving the cab through the hoistway as desired. In some configurations, the belt couples a counterweight to the cab. Regardless of the specific configuration of the elevator system, it typically is necessary to secure ends of the belt to an appropriate structure within the elevator system.<br>
A variety of configurations of assemblies for securing the ends of a belt in an elevator system have been used. One example includes a cast socket and wedge arrangement where a portion of the belt is secured between the socket and the wedge. One disadvantage is that the casting process is relatively expensive and the integral nature of the casting arrangement limits access to the belt-engaging surfaces within the socket. This makes it difficult to treat the belt-engaging surfaces, such as by knurling the belt-engaging surfaces, to enhance the gripping characteristics. Additionally, it is difficult to achieve tolerances desirable for uniform load distribution.<br>
Another example socket is formed from sheet metal and includes two sheet metal parts bent generally into a U-shape. The U-shaped parts are then joined with a dovetail joint and welded along the joint to form the socket. Shoe parts with knurled belt-engaging surfaces are inserted in the sheet metal parts. One drawback of this arrangement is a limited load carrying capacity. It is often difficult to bend sheet metal into the desired configuration if the sheet metal is over V4 inch thick. Therefore, it is typically unfeasible to use thicker sheet metal to increase the load carrying capacity of the socket and larger and more cumbersome shoe parts are required.<br>
Another shortcoming of current arrangements is that the arrangements do not provide the desired dimensional tolerances for many situations. One particular issue is presented by the need to establish and maintain a parallel alignment between opposite sides of the socket and opposite sides of the wedge. Without a truly parallel<br>
alignment, the forces on the load bearing member are not evenly distributed and belt life may be compromised.<br>
There is a need for an improved elevator load bearing termination arrangement. This invention addresses that need and overcomes the shortcomings described above.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One example socket for securing an end of an elongated load bearing member in an elevator system includes at least one first socket member that at least partially forms the socket. Second socket members that are separate and distinct from each other and from the first socket member are spaced apart from each other for receiving a load-bearing member. Each second socket member is rigidly fixed to the at least one first socket member.<br>
One example method of making a socket for use in an elevator system uses a<br>
first socket member and second socket members that are separate, distinct pieces. The<br>
method includes inserting a plurality of tabs that extend either the first socket member<br>
or the second socket members into a corresponding plurality of recesses in the other<br>
of the first socket member or the second socket members. This rigidly secures the<br>
first socket-memberand-the second socket members together	<br>
The various features and advantages of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of a currently preferred embodiment. The drawings that accompany the detailed description can be briefly described as follows.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Figures 1 through 3 illustrate a device 10 for handling an end of a load bearing member 22 in an elevator system. The load bearing member 22 in the illustrated example is a flat belt, however, any load bearing member within an elevator system that can be accommodated using a socket and wedge arrangement designed according to this invention may be used. The term "belt" as used in this description should not be construed in its strictest sense. It should be considered synonymous with roping or load bearing member.<br>
In the illustrated example, a socket 24 includes side plates 26a and 26b (i.e., first socket members) and keeper parts 28a and 28b (i.e., second socket members) between the side plates 26a and 26b. The keeper parts 28a and 28b and the side plates 26a and 26b are distinct, separate pieces that are rigidly secured together and cooperate with a wedge 30 to secure the end of the load bearing member 22 in a desired -position.- The example -device. 10 -has advantages in simplifying the manufacture and assembly of the socket 24 and allowing scaling of the design to a variety of load requirements. Additionally, the example device 10 facilitates flatness, parallelism, and dimensional control, which eliminates the need for insert shoe parts.<br>
As can be appreciated from one or more of the drawings, the device 10 includes relatively few parts, including the side plates 26a and 26b, the keeper parts 28a and 28b, the wedge 30, and a connector portion 32 that are assembled together to form the socket 24.<br>
In the illustrated example, the side plates 26a and 26b each include recesses 34 such as slots for assembling the socket 24. In this example, the recesses 34 comprise openings through each side plate 26. Each of the keeper parts 28a and 28b includes tabs 38 with beveled end portions that are received at least partially into a corresponding recess 34. In the illustrated example, the tabs 38 include a generally rectangular cross-sectional profile. Given this description, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize suitable profiles other than rectangular to meet their particular needs.<br>
The side plates 26a and 26b also each include a connector opening 36 for receiving the connector portion 32. In the illustrated example, the connector portion 32 includes a bridge member 44 having an internally threaded opening 33 that receives a rod 35 that secures the device 10 to a support in a known manner. In some examples, a pin P (Figure 2) is used to secure the rod 35 and bridge member 44 together.<br>
In one example, the recesses 34, connector openings 36, tabs 38, and shape of the side plates 26a and 26b and keeper parts 28a and 28b are laser cut from a metal block. Given this description, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize alternative processes and materials for making the socket 24.<br>
In the illustrated example, the side plates 26a and 26b are spaced a uniform distance apart (i.e., are parallel), and the keeper parts 28a and 28b are transverse to each other and generally perpendicular to the side plates 26a and 26b. The terms "parallel" and "perpendicular" as used in this description refer to the nominal relative positioning between the parts and are not intended to be restrictive in a strict geometrical sense.<br>
In the illustrated example, some of the recesses 34 are aligned along a first plane P1 and other recesses 34 are aligned along a second plane P2 with a desired<br>
	oblique angle a such as -15°-between them.-In this example, the angle a corresponds to	 .<br>
the position of the keeper parts 28a and 28b relative to one another.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a view along the section line shown in Figure 1 and shows a locking connection between the tabs 38 of the keeper part 28b and the recesses 34 of the side plates 26a and 26b. The locking connection for the keeper part 28a is similar. The locking connection provides the benefit of maintaining the keeper parts 28a and 28b at the desired angle while uniformly distributing shear loads from the keeper parts 28a and 28b to the side plates 26a and 26b. In the disclosed example, using a plurality of tabs also provides multiple locations for load distribution.<br>
In this example, the beveled end portions of the tabs 38 form channels 40 with the recesses 34. In one example, the channels 40 receive a filler material 42 (e.g., braze, solder, or weld filler material) to secure the keeper parts 28a and 28b together with the side plates 26a and 26b. Although the illustrated example shows the beveled end portions of the tabs 38 being flush with the side plates 26a and 26b, in some examples the tabs 38 extend completely through the recesses 34 or only partially into the recesses 34.<br>
Likewise, the connector portion 32 includes a bridge member 44 having beveled ends 46 that are received into the respective connector openings 36. This provides a locking connection similar the locking connection between the tabs 38 and the recesses 34. The bridge member 44 transfers load from the side plates 28a and 28b to the rod 35. Given mis description, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize suitable bridge member 44 shapes and configurations other than what is shown to meet their particular needs.<br>
In one example, one or more the surfaces of the wedge 30 and keeper parts 28a and 28b are treated to enhance the gripping characteristics of the socket 24. In one example, contact surfaces 50 of the keeper parts 28a and 28b and wedge 30 are milled, knurled, or grooved in a known manner to increase friction with the load bearing member 22. The separate, distinct keeper parts 28a and 28b provide the benefit of being easily accessible for treatment before assembly with the side plates 26a and 26b.<br>
As can be appreciated from the drawings and description, the designed size of the side plates 26a and 26b and keeper parts 28a and 28b can be scaled up or down to accommodate a variety of desired load bearing capacities. Since the side plates 26a and 26b and keeper parts 28a and 28b are formed or cut from metal blocks instead of<br>
-    bent sheet metal as-in some prior designs, there are fewer manufacturing limitations	<br>
that inhibit scale up compared to previously known arrangements. Additionally, this facilitates flatness, parallelism, and dimensional control.<br>
In another example, the angle a and a wedge angle GO (Figure 2) are unequal. In one example, the wedge angle  is greater than the angle a. In a further example, the wedge angle is V20 greater than the angle a.This provides the advantage of increasing the breaking strength of the load bearing member 22. In some prior arrangements, breaking of the load bearing member occurs at the entrance of the socket. At this point, tensile stress from the load is a maximum. The stress in the load bearing member is a combination of the tensile stress and orthogonal compressive stress from wedging force. As a result, with evenly distributed wedging pressure, von Mises stress at the entrance of the socket is a maximum. By selecting the right geometry of wedge/socket surfaces, the pressure is redistributed in such a way that maximum pressure will be inside of the socket where tensile stress is lower. That will increase the breaking force of the load bearing member.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates a modified example. In this example, a fastener 54 extends through each of the recesses 34 of the side plates 26a and 26b with corresponding openings 56 in the keeper parts 28a and 28b to secure the device 10 together. In one example, the fastener 54 and openings 56 are threaded to facilitate assembly. Figure 6 illustrates another modified example, wherein the fasteners 54 are bolts that extend entirely through the keeper parts 28a and 28b and extend from each side of the side plates 26a and 26b. The bolts are secured in place using a nut 58. Given this description, one of ordinary skill will recognize other ways of securing the parts together to meet their particular needs.<br>
In one example, to facilitate precise assembly of the device 10, a positioning member 52 as shown in Figure 7 is used to precisely align the side plates 26a and 26b and keeper parts 28a and 28b. In the illustrated example, the positioning member 52 is approximately the same combined size and shape as a corresponding wedge 30 (shown in phantom) and load bearing member 22 that will be used with that particular socket 24. The thickness T of the load bearing member 22 is included on the dimensions of the positioning member 52 in this example.<br>
To assemble the device 10, the tabs 38 of the keeper parts 28a and 28b are fit into the recesses 34 of the side plates 26a and 26b. In one example, there is some play -between the tabs 38 and-openings 36. The positioning member 52 is .then inserted into, the socket 24 between the keeper parts 28a and 28b and side plates 26a and 26b. A positioning member in the shape of the bridge member 44 is also used for aligning the tops of the side plates 28a and 28b. The keeper parts 28a and 28b, side plates 26a and 26b, and positioning member 52 are then clamped together and the distinct pieces are welded, brazed, or soldered (for example) to secure the parts together before removing the positioning member 52. The positioning member 52 maintains a precise alignment between the side plates 26a and 26b and keeper parts 28a and 28b during the welding, brazing, or soldering process. This feature provides the benefit of establishing a precise socket 24 assembly, which is desired for maintaining a wedge in a desired position and achieving uniform load distribution on a load bearing member.<br>
