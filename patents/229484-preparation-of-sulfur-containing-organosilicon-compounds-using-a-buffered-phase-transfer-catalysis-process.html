				<td>PREPARATION OF SULFUR-CONTAINING ORGANOSILICON COMPOUNDS USING<br>
A BUFFERED PHASE TRANSFER CATALYSIS PROCESS<br>
[0001] This invention relates to a process for the production of sulfur containing<br>
organosilicon compounds by phase transfer ca:alysis techniques. The process involves<br>
reacting a sulfide, and optionally suL'ur, with a silane compound in the presence of a phase<br>
transfer catalyst and aqueous phase containing a buffer.<br>
[0002] Sulfur containing organosilicon compounds are useful as reactive coupling agents in<br>
a variety of commercial applications. In particular, sulfur containing organosilicon<br>
compounds have become essential components in the production of tires based on rubber<br>
vulcanates containing silica. The sulfur containing organosilicon compounds improve the<br>
physical properties of the rubber vulcanates containing silica resulting in automotive tires<br>
with improved abrasion resistance, rolling resistance, and wet skidding performance. The<br>
sulfur containing organosilicon compounds can be added directly to the rubber vulcanates<br>
containing silica, or alternately, can be used to pre-treat the silica prior to addition to the<br>
rubber vulcanate composition.<br>
[0003] Numerous methods have been described in the art for the preparation of sulfur<br>
containing organosilicon compounds. For example, U.S. 5,399,739 by French et al. describes<br>
a method for making sulfur-containing organosilanes by reacting an alkali metal alcoholate<br>
with hydrogen sulfide to form an alkali metal hydrosulfide, which is subsequently reacted<br>
with an alkali metal to provide an alkal metal sulfide. The resulting alkali metal sulfide is<br>
then reacted with sulfur to provide an a kali metal polysulfide which is then finally reacted<br>
with a silane compound of the formula X-R2-Si(R1)3, where X is either chlorine or bromine to<br>
produce the sulfur-containing organosil.tne.<br>
[0004] U.S. Patent Nos. 5,466,848, 5,.596,116, and 5,489,701 describe processes for the<br>
preparation of silane polysulfides. The 848 patent process is based on first producing<br>
sodium sulfide by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with sodium ethoxylate. The sodium<br>
sulfide is then reacted with sulfur to forn the tetrasulfide, which is subsequently reacted with<br>
chloropropyltriethoxysilane to form 3, 3 -bis (triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfide. The '116<br>
patent teaches a process for the preparation of polysulfides, without the use of hydrogen<br>
sulfide, by reacting a metal alkoxide in alcohol with elemental sulfur, or by reacting sodium<br>
metal with elemental sulfur and an alcohol1, with a nalohydrocarbylalkoxysilane such as<br><br>
chloropropyltriethoxysilane. The '701 patent cairns a process for the preparation of silane<br>
polysulfides by contacting hydrogen sulfide gas with an active metal alkoxide solution and<br>
subsequently reacting the reaction proluct with a halohydrocarbylalkoxysilane such as<br>
chloropropyltriethoxysilane.<br>
[0005] U.S. Patent No. 5,892,085 describes a process for the preparation of high purity<br>
organosilicon disulphanes. U.S. Patent No. 5,859,275 describes a process for the production<br>
of bis (silylorganyl) polysulphanes. E.oth the '085 and '275 patents describe anhydrous<br>
techniques involving the direct reaction of a haloalkoxysilane with a polysulphide.<br>
[0006] U.S. Pat. No. 6,066,752 teaches a process for producing sulfur-containing<br>
organosilicon compounds by reacting sulfur, a.n alkali metal, and a halogenalkoyxsilane in the<br>
absence of a solvent or in the presence of an aprotic solvent.<br>
[0007] Most recently, U.S. Pat. No 6,140,524 describes a method for preparing short chain<br>
polysulfide silane mixtures of the formula (RO)3SiC3H6SnC3H6Si(RO)3 having a distribution<br>
where n falls in the range of 2.2 
typically Na2Sn with a halogenopropyltrialkoxysilane having the formula<br>
(RO)3SiC3H6X wherein X is a halogen, in alcohol solvent.<br>
[0008] Alternative processes for the preparation of sulfur-containing organosilanes have<br>
been taught in the art based on the use of phase transfer catalysis techniques. Phase transfer<br>
catalysis techniques overcome many of the practical problems associated with the<br>
aforementioned prior art processes for producing sulfur-containing organosilicon compounds.<br>
Many of these problems are related o the use of solvents. In particular, the use of ethyl<br>
alcohol can be problematic because of its low flash point. Additionally, it is difficult to<br>
obtain and maintain anhydrous cone itions necessary in many of the aforementioned prior art<br>
processes on an industrial scale.<br>
[0009] Phase transfer catalysis techniques for producing sulfur-containing organosilicon<br>
compounds are taught for example in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,405,985, 5,663,396, 5,468,893, and<br>
5,583,245. While these patents teac h new processes for the preparation of sulfur containing<br>
organosilicon compounds using phase transfer catalysis, there still exist many practical<br>
problems with the use of phase transfer techniques at an industrial scale. For example, there<br>
is a need to control the reactivity of the phase transfer catalyst in the preparation of sulfur-<br>
containing organosilanes so as to provide efficient, yet safe reactions, that can be performed<br>
on an industrial scale. Furthermore, there is a need to improve the final product stability,<br>
appearance and purity. In particular, the phase transfer catalysis process of the prior art<br><br>
results in final product compositions containing high quantities of un-reacted sulfur species.<br>
These un-reacted sulfur species can precipitate in stored products with time causing changes<br>
in product sulfide distribution.<br>
[0010] The need to improve product quality is of particular importance when an alkali<br>
metal or ammonium hydrogen sulfide is used as a starting material in phase transfer catalysis<br>
techniques. In these reactions, dangerous and odorous hydrogen sulfide is produced in side<br>
reactions. Product compositions containing even minor amounts of hydrogen sulfide deter<br>
their use in large scale industrial processes.<br>
[0011] Yet another problem associated with the use of phase transfer catalysis techniques<br>
for producing sulfur containing organos licon compounds is gelation, caused by the<br>
hydrolysis of the alkoxy groups on the organosilicon compound, or starting silane reactant,<br>
with the aqueous phase reactants.<br>
[0012] It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved process for<br>
the production of sulfur containing organosilicon compounds based on phase transfer<br>
catalysis techniques.<br>
[0013] It is a further object of the present invention to provide a process for producing<br>
sulfur containing organosilicon compounds based on phase transfer catalysis techniques that<br>
result in a final product composition of greater stability, purity, and appearance.<br>
[0014] It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a process for producing<br>
sulfur containing organosilicon compounds based on phase transfer techniques using a<br>
hydrosulfide compound that minimizes or eliminates hydrogen sulfide as a side product.<br>
[0015] It is still yet a further object of he present invention to provide a process for<br>
producing sulfur containing organosilicon compounds based on phase transfer techniques<br>
where gelation of starting materials or resulting products is minimized or eliminated.<br>
[0016] The present invention provides a process for the production of sulfur containing<br>
organosilicon compounds by a buffered ?hase transfer catalysis techniques. Sulfur<br>
containing organosilicon compounds are prepared by the process of the present invention by<br>
reacting ammonium hydrosulfide or an alkali metal hydrosulfide, and optionally sulfur, with<br>
a silane compound having the formula<br>
(RO)3-rnRmSi-Alk-X	where X is Cl, Br or I,<br>
in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst and an aqueous phase containing a buffer.<br><br>
[0017] The improvement of the present invention is characterized by adding a buffer to the<br>
aqueous phase. The present invention also provides an improved process for the production<br>
of sulfur containing organosilicon compounds by controlling the pH of the aqueous phase.<br>
[0018] The present invention also encompasses the organosilicon compounds produced by<br>
the improved process.<br>
[0019] The present invention is a process for the production of organosilicon compounds of<br>
the formula:<br>
(RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR)3-m<br>
where R is independently a monovalent hydrocarbon of 1 to 12 carbon<br>
atoms; Alk is a d.valcnt hydrocarbon of 1 to 18 carbon atoms;<br>

where X is Cl, Br or I, and m is the same as above,<br>
and optionally,<br>
(C)	sulfur<br>
in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst and an aqueous phase containing a buffer.<br>
[0020] Examples of sulfur containing organosilicon compounds which may be prepared in<br>
accordance with the present invention are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,405,985, 5,663,396,<br>
5,468,893, and 5,583,245, which are hereby incorporated by reference. The preferred sulfur<br>
containing organosilicon compounds which are prepared in accordance with the present<br>
invention are the 3,3'-bis(trialkoxysilylpropyl) polysulfides. The most preferred compounds<br>
are 3,3'-bis(triethoxysilylpropyl) disulfide and 3,3'-bis(triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfide.<br>
[0021] Sulfide compounds of the formula M2Sn or MHS can be used as component (A) in<br>
the reaction step of the process of the present invention, where M represents an alkali metal<br>
or ammonium group and H represents hydrogen. Representative alkali metals include<br>
lithium, potassium, sodium, rubidiuri, or cesium. Preferably M is sodium. Generally, MHS<br><br>
compounds are used preferentially when the average value of n in the resulting product<br>
formula, (RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR)3-m is desired to be 2. Examples of the MHS<br>
compound include NaHS, KHS, and NH4HS. When the sulfide compound is an MHS<br>
compound, NaHS is preferred. Specific examples of the NaHS compound include NaHS<br>
flakes (containing 71.5 - 74.5% NaHS) and NaHS liquors (containing 45 - 60 % NaHS)<br>
from PPG of Pittsburgh, PA. M2Sn compounds are used preferentially when the average<br>

[0022] Component (B) in the reaction step of the process of the present invention is a silane<br>
compound of the formula;<br>
(RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-X<br>
R can independently be any hydrocarbcn group containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Thus,<br>

the present invention is chloropropyl triethoxy silane (CPTES).<br>
[0023] Sulfur can also be added to the reaction step on the process of the present invention<br>
as an optional component, (C). The sulfur used in the reaction of the present invention is<br>
elemental sulfur. The type and form ae not critical and can include those commonly used.<br>
An example of a suitable sulfur material is 100 mesh refined sulfur powder from Aldrich,<br>
Milwaukee WI.<br><br>
[0024] The amount of sulfur and sulfide compound used in the process of the present<br>
invention can vary, but preferably the molar ratio of S/ M2Sn or S/MHS ranges from 0.3 to<br>
5. The molar ratio of sulfur/sulfide ;ompounc can be used to affect the final product<br>
distribution, that is the average value of n in the formula, (RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-<br>
SiRm(OR)3-m. When the average value of n is desired to be 4 in the product formula, (RO)3_<br>
mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR)3-m, the preferred range for the ratio of sulfur/sulfide compound<br>
is from 2.7 to 3.2. When the average value of m is desired to be 2 in the product formula,<br>
(RO)3.mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR) 3-m, the preferred range for the ratio of sulfur/sulfide<br>
compound is from 0.8 to 1.2.<br>
[0025] The silane compound, (RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-X, can be reacted in the presence of or<br>
absence of a solvent with the sulfide compound, or alternatively with the sulfide compound<br>
and sulfur in combination, as described above. The silane compound can also be dispersed in<br>
an organic solvent to form an organic phase. Representative examples of organic solvents<br>
include toluene, xylene, benzene, heptane, octane, nonane, decane, chlorobenzene and the<br>
like. When an organic solvent is usee , the preferred organic solvent is toluene.<br>
[0026] When conducting the reacticn of the present invention, preferably the silane<br>
compound is reacted directly with the sulfide compound and sulfur in combination as<br>
described above.<br>
[0027] The amount of the silane compound (RO)3-rnRmSi-Alk-X used in the process of the<br>
present invention can vary. An example of a suitable molar range includes from 1/10 to 10/1<br>
based on the amount of sulfide compo and used. When the average value of n is desired to be<br>
4 in the product formula, (RO)3.mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR)3-m, the silane compound<br>
(RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-X is used from 2.0 to 2.10 in molar excess of the M2Sn sulfide compound,<br>
with a range of 2.01 to 2.06 being the most preferable. When the average value of n is<br>
desired to be 2 in the product formula.<br>
(RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR)3.n, the silan; compound (RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-X is used<br>
from 1.8 to 2.10 in molar excess of the MHS sulfide compound, with a range of J .9 to 2.0<br>
being the most preferable.<br>
[0028] The phase transfer catalysts operable in the present invention are the quaternary<br>
onium cations. Preferred examples of the quaternary onium cations as phase transfer<br>
catalysts are described in US 5,405,985, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Preferably, the quaternary onium cation is tetrabutyl ammonium bromide or tetrabutyl<br>
ammonium chloride. The most preferred quaternary onium salt is tetrabutyl ammonium<br><br>
bromide. A particularly preferred quaternary onium salt is tetrabutyl ammonium bromide<br>
(99%) from Aldrich Chemical of Milwaukee, WI.<br>
[0029] The amount of the phase transler catalyst used in the process may vary. Preferably<br>
the amount of phase transfer catalyst is from 0.1 to 10 weight %, and most preferably from<br>
0.5 to 2 weight % based on the amount of silane compound used.<br>
[0030] The phase transfer catalyst may be added to the reaction at any time. Preferably, the<br>
phase transfer catalyst is added to the aqueous phase prior the reaction step of the process of<br>
the present invention.<br>
[0031] The reaction of the present invention is conducted in the presence of an aqueous<br>
phase containing a buffer. The buffer (an be a single compound such as an alkali metal salt<br>
of a phosphate, a hydrogen phosphate, a dihydrogen phosphate, a carbonate, a hydrogen<br>
carbonate, or a borate, or combinations thereof. Examples of buffers include; Na3PO4,<br>
Na2HPO4, NaH2PO4 , Na2CO3, NaHCO3, and NaB4O7. Preferably, the buffer is selected from<br>
Na3P04- Na2C03, or K2C03. When the average value of n is desired to be 4 in the product<br>
formula, (RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiKm(OR)3-m, the preferred buffer is Na3PO4. When the<br>
average value of n is desired to be 2 in the product formula, (RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-<br>
SiRm(OR)3-m, the preferred buffer is Na2CO3 or K2CO3.<br>
[0032] The amount of the buffer adc ed to the aqueous phase can vary, but generally is<br>
added in molar amounts equal to or greater than the number of moles of M2Sn or MHS.<br>
[0033] In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the sulfide compound, the phase<br>
transfer catalyst, the buffer, water, and optionally sulfur, are mixed together to form an<br>
intermediate reaction product. This reaction can be conducted at a variety of temperatures,<br>
but generally in the range of 40 - 100"C. Preferably, the reaction is conducted at a<br>
temperature ranging from 65 - 95°C. Generally, the first step can be conducted at various<br>
pressures, but preferably the first step reaction is conducted at atmospheric pressure. The<br>
time needed for the reaction of the first step to occur is not critical, but generally ranges from<br>
5 to 30 minutes. The intermediate re iction product is then reacted with the silane compound,<br>
(RO)3*mRmSi-Alk-X. The time needed for the reaction of the intermediate reaction product<br>
and silane compound to occur is not critical, but generally ranges from 5 minutes to 6 hours.<br>
[0034] The amount of water used to create the aqueous phase or intermediate reaction<br>
product can vary, but is preferably based on the amount of the silane compound (III) used in<br>
the process. Water can be added directly, or indirectly, as some water may already be present<br>
in small amounts in other starting materials. For purposes of the present invention, it is<br><br>
preferable to calculate the total amount of water present, that is, accounting for all water<br>
added either directly or indirectly. Preferably, the total amount of water used to create the<br>
aqueous phase or the intermediate reaction product is 1 to 100 weight % of the silane<br>
compound used, with a range of 2.5 to '0 weight % being more preferred. Most preferred is<br>
a range of 20 to 40 weight % of water used for the intermediate reaction product based on<br>
the amount of silane compound used.<br>
Although not to be limited to any theory the present inventors believe the addition of a buffer<br>
to the aqueous phase in the process to prepare sulfur containing organosilicon compounds<br>
using phase transfer catalysis helps to control the pH of the reaction medium, thereby<br>
affecting product formation and minimizing side reactions, such as the production of<br>
hydrogen sulfide or the production of mercaptan silane having the general formula (RO)v<br>
mRmSi-Alk-SH . Thus, as a second embodiment of the present invention, sulfur containing<br>
organosilicon compounds can be produced in the reaction described above by controlling the<br>
pH. The pH of the aqueous phase used in the reaction of the present invention can be<br>
controlled by the addition of a buffer, as described above, or alternatively, by the addition of<br>
any acidic or basic compounds at such a ate and concentration so as to maintain a pH during<br>
the reaction in the range of 7 to 14. The present inventors have also found that pH can have<br>
an influence on the product distribution, that is, the value of n in the product formula<br>
(RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiR,11(OR)3-m, When the average value of n is desired to be 2 in<br>
the product formula, (RO)3.mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR)3-m, the preferred pH range is from 8<br>
to 10. When the average value of n is desired to be 4 in the product formula,<br>
(RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR)3-m, the preferred pH range is from 11 to 14.<br>
[0035] The silane compound is added to the aqueous phase, or to the intermediate reaction<br>
product, as described above, at such a rate so as to control the exothermic reaction, and<br>
maintain a temperature in the range of 40 to 110°C. Preferably the reaction temperature is<br>
maintained at 60 to 95°C. The reaction progress can be monitored by the consumption of the<br>
silane compound starting material. The amount of catalyst and reaction temperature affects<br>
the reaction time necessary for completion.<br>
[0036] At the end of the reaction, a procuct mixture is produced containing an organic<br>
phase, an aqueous phase, and possibly precipitated solid materials that can include salts such<br>
as NaCl, Na2HPO4, or NaHCO3 (or analogous potassium salts) formed during the reaction.<br>
The organic phase contains the organosila ne compound.<br><br>
[0037] The present invention also encompasses processing steps to enhance the separation<br>
of the organosilane compound from the product mixture. This separation can be the phase<br>
separation of the organic and aqueous pnase, resulting directly from the reaction of<br>
components (A), (B), and optional (C), as described above. Alternatively, if precipitated<br>
salts are formed during the reaction, the salts can be separated first by a filtering process or<br>
decanting method prior to the phase separation. Preferably, water or a dilute acidic solution<br>
is added to the product mixture prior to separation. The addition of water or a dilute acidic<br>
solution can enhance the phase separation by dissolving some or all of the precipitated salts.<br>
The amount of water or dilute acidic soution that is added during this step can vary from 10<br>
to 50 weight % based on the weight of the amount of silane compound used, preferably, the<br>
amount of water or dilute acidic solution added is from 20 to 40 weight % based on the<br>
amount of the silane compound used, and most preferably from 25 weight % to 35 weight %.<br>
When a dilute acidic solution is used, it can be any of the common acids, for example HCl,<br>
HNO3, H2SO4, or the like, having a normal (N) concentration of 0.000001 to 5, preferably<br>
0.01 to 1. The dilute acidic solution can also be prepared by the addition of a chlorosilane to<br>
water. Examples of chlorosilanes that can be used to create the dilute acidic solution include<br>
trichlorosilane, trichloromethylsilane, dimethyldichlorosilane, dimethylchlorosilane,<br>
trimethylchlorosilane . Preferably, .5 to 10 weight % chlorosilane can be used to prepare the<br>
dilute acidic solution, with 1 to 5 weight % being the most preferred. When a chlorosilane is<br>
used to create the dilute acidic solution, the chlorosilane is preferably trimethylchlorosilane.<br>
[0038] Following the addition of water or a dilute acidic solution to the product mixture,<br>
the organosilicon compound is isolatec from the product mixture by phase separating the<br>
organic phase and aqueous phase. The organic phase containing the organosilicon compound<br>
can be further subjected to a drying step. One example of the drying step can be to treat the<br>
organic phase under vacuum to remove any volatile organic materials present along with any<br>
residual water that may be present. This drying step can involve, for example, heating the<br>
organic phase to a temperature of 20 to 160°C under a reduced pressure of 5 to 35 mm Hg<br>
(0.67 to 4.65 kPa), preferably the conditions are 90 to 120°C at 5 to 25 mm Hg (0.67 to 3.33<br>
kPa). Alternatively, the drying step of the organic phase can involve the use of a thin film<br>
stripper to remove volatile organics miterials and residual water content in the organic phase.<br>
Yet another technique for the drying s ep of the organic phase can be to contact the organic<br>
phase containing the organosilicon compound with a desiccant material. The desiccant<br>
material can be any solid material known in the art to remove trace quantities of water in<br><br>
organic phases. These include knovn ionic hygroscopic materials like sodium sulfate,<br>
magnesium sulfate, and the like, or silicate based materials such as zeolites, silica,<br>
aluminasilicates, and the like. The preferred desiccant material is either sodium sulfate or<br>
magnesium sulfate, with sodium sulfate being the most preferred.<br>
[0039] The dried organic phase can be subjected to additional steps according to the present<br>
invention that result in further improvements of the organosilicon compound final purity and<br>
appearance. The organic phase containing the organosilicon compound can be cooled to a<br>
temperature below 15°C. This coolit g step results in the precipitation of un-reacted sulfur<br>
and sulfur compounds. Preferably, the organic phase containing the organosilicon compound<br>
is cooled to a temperature in the range of -20 to 30°C, and most preferably to a temperature<br>
in the range of -15 and 15°C. The precipitated un-reacted sulfur and sulfur compounds can<br>
then be separated, for example by filtaration, from the organic phase containing the<br>
organosilicon compound. The present inventors have found that removing un-reacted sulfur<br>
and sulfur compounds minimizes or eliminates further precipitation of sulfur and un-reacted<br>
sulfur compounds with time. As a res alt, the long-term storage stability of the organosilicon<br>
compound is enhanced by producing a composition that does not change with time or result<br>
in a product composition containing sclid precipitates.<br>
[0040] The following examples are provided to illustrate the present invention. These<br>
examples are not intended to limit the scope of the claims herein.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0041] The distribution of the various sulfur containing organosilicon compounds were<br>
analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Typical run conditions for HPLC<br>
analysis were as follows: 8-9 drops of the reaction sample were diluted in 8.5 g of<br>
cyclohexane, which was then filtered th-ough a 0.2 p.m PTFE membrane (e.g. PURADISC™<br>
25TF of Whatman®) into a vial, a 10 µl sample of the filtrate was injected via an<br>
autosampler into a HPLC system (e.g. Fewlett-Packard 1050). The sample was fractionated<br>
on a Lichrosorp RP18 column (e.g. Alltcch Assoc, Inc; 250 mm x 4.6 mm, 10 urn) using a<br>
mixture of 96 % acetonitrile and 4 % tetrahydrofurane (vol/vol) as mobile phase. The<br>
fractions were investigated via UV-abso ption detector using 254 nm as the appropriate<br>
excitation wavelength. Different UV-sensitivities of every single sulfide species were<br>
averaged by division of the respective peak area through specific, empirically evaluated,<br><br>
response factors* (RF) listed below that reflect the hyperchromy with every sulfur atom in<br>
the chain and elemental sulfur.<br><br>

the addition of CPTES, the reactor was held at 75° C for 2 to 3.5 hours until the reaction was<br>
determined to be complete, as determined by no further conversion of CPTES, as measured<br>
by gas chromatographic analysis of the organic phase. After the reaction was complete, the<br>
