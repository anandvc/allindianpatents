				<td>METHOD OF OPERATING AN ULTRASOUND HANDPIECE<br>
Background of the invention<br>
This invention relates to ultrasonic devices and more particularly to devices for controlling an ophthalmic phacoemulsification handpiece.<br>
A typical ultrasonic surgical device suitable for ophthalmic procedures consists of an ultrasonically driven handpiece, an attached hollow cutting tip, an irrigating sleeve and an electronic control console. The handpiece assembly is attached to the control console by an electric cable and flexible tubings. Through the electric cable, the console varies the power level transmitted by the handpiece to the attached cutting tip and the flexible tubings supply irrigation fluid to and draw aspiration fluid from the eye through the handpiece assembly.<br>
The operative part of the handpiece is a centrally located, hollow resonating bar or horn directly attached to a set of piezoelectric crystals. The crystals supply the required ultrasonic vibration needed to drive both the hom and the attached cutting tip during phacoemulsification and are controlled by the console. The crystal/horn assembly is suspended within the hollow body or shell of the handpiece at its nodal points by relatively inflexible mountings. The handpiece body terminates in a reduced diameter portion or nosecone at the body's distal end. The nosecone is externally threaded to accept the irrigation sleeve. Likewise, the horn bore is internally threaded at its distal end to receive the external threads of the cutting tip. The irrigation sleeve also has an internally threaded bore that is screwed onto the external threads of the nosecone. The cutting tip is adjusted so that the tip projects only a predetermined amount past the open end of the irrigating sleeve. Ultrasonic handpieces and cutting tips are more fully described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,589,363; 4,223,676; 4,246,902; 4,493,694; 4,515,583; 4,589,415; 4,609,368; 4,869,715; and 4,922,902, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
When used to perform phacoemulsification, the ends of the cutting tip and irrigating sleeve are inserted into a small incision of predetermined width in the cornea, sclera, or other location in the eye tissue in order to gain access to the anterior chamber of the eye. The cutting tip is ultrasonically vibrated along its longitudinal axis within the irrigating sleeve by the crystal-driven ultrasonic horn, thereby emulsifying upon contact the selected tissue in situ. The hollow bore of the cutting tip interfaces with the bore in the horn that in turn interfaces with the aspiration line from the handpiece to the console. A reduced pressure or vacuum source in the console draws or aspirates the emulsified tissue from the eye through the open end of the cutting tip, the bore of the cutting tip, the horn bore, and the aspiration line and into a collection device. The aspiration of emulsified tissue is aided by a saline flushing solution or irrigant that, is injected into the surgical site through the small annular gap between the inside surface of the irrigating sleeve and the outside surface of the cutting tip. The irrigant also maintains the fiuidic balance in the eye and helps the eye to keep its shape.<br>
There have been prior attempts to combine ultrasonic longitudinal motion of the cutting tip with rotational motion of the tip, see U.S. Patent Nos. 5,222,959 (Anis), 5,722,945 (Anis, et al.) and 4,504,264 (Kelrnan), the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. These prior attempts have used electric motors to provide the rotation of the tip which require O-ring or other seals that can fail in addition to the added complexity and possible failure of the motors.<br>
There have also been prior attempts to generate both longitudinal and torsional motion without the use of electric motors. For example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,028,387, 6,077,285 and 6,402,769 (Boukhny), describe a handpiece having two pairs of piezoelectric crystals. One pair is polarized to produce longitudinal motion. The other pair is polarized to produce torsional motion. Two separate drive signals are used to drive the two pairs of crystals. In actual practice, making a handpiece using two pairs of crystals resonate in both longitudinal and torsional directions is difficult to achieve. One possible solution is described in U.S. Patent Publication No. US 2001/0011176 Al (Boukhny).    This reference discloses a handpiece have a single set of piezoelectric<br>
crystals that produces longitudinal motion, and a series of diagonal slits on the handpiece horn or tip that produce torsional motion when the horn or tip is driven at the resonate frequency of the piezoelectric crystals. Again, in practice, the resonate frequency of the piezoelectric crystals and the 'tip or horn did not coincide, so simultaneous longitudinal and torsional motion was difficult to achieve.<br>
Accordingly, a need continues to exist for a reliable ultrasonic handpiece that will vibrate both longitudinally and torsionally', either simultaneously or.separately.<br>
Brief Summary of the; Invention<br>
The present invention improves upon prior art ultrasonic handpiece operating methods by providing a handpiece having at least one set of piezoelectric elements polarized to produce longitudinal motion when excited at the relevant resonant frequency. The piezoelectric crystals are connected to an ultrasonic horn to which a cutting tip is attached. The horn and/or the cutting tip contains a plurality of diagonal slits or grooves. The slits or grooves produce optimized torsional movement in the cutting tip when the piezoelectric crystals are excited at a second resonant frequency. When in torsional mode, material may clog the cutting tip. The present method includes the step of providing a pulse of longitudinal movement of the tip when clogging is detected.<br>
It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide an ultrasound handpiece having both longitudinal and torsional motion.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide an ultrasound handpiece with a horn having a series of diagonal slits to produce torsional motion.<br>
Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent with reference to the drawings, and the following description of the drawings and claims.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
FIG, 1 is a perspective view of a handpiece that may be used with the method of the present invention with the outer case removed.<br>
FIG, 2 is a perspective view of an ultrasonic horn that may be used with the method of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 3 a block diagram of a driving circuit that may be used with the present invention,<br>
FIG, 4 is a perspective view of a handpiece and control console that may be used with the present invention.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
As best seen in FIG. 4, surgical console 320 suitable for use with the present invention may be any commercially available surgical control console such as the INFINITI® surgical systems available from Aicon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, Texas. Console 320 is connected to handpiece 10 through irrigation line 322 and aspiration line 50, and the flow through lines 322 and 50 is controlled by the user, for example, via footswitch 326. Power is supplied to handpiece through electrical cable 400.<br>
As best seen in FIG. 1 handpiece 10 of the present invention generally comprises ultrasonic horn 12, typically made from a titanium alloy. Hom 12 has a plurality of helical slits, which will be discussed below. A plurality (typically 1 or 2 pairs) of ring-shaped piezoelectric elements 14 are held by compression nut 15 against horn 12. Aspiration shaft 16 extends down the length of handpiece 10 through horn 12, piezoelectric elements 14, nut 15 and through plug 18 at the distal end of handpiece 10. Aspiration tube 16 allows material to be aspirated through hollow tip 20, which is attached to hom 12, and through and out handpiece 10. Plug 18 seals outer shell 11 of handpiece 10 fluid tight, allowing handpiece 10 to be autoclaved without adversely affecting piezoelectric elements 14. Addition grooves 22 for sealing O-rrng gaskets (not shown) are provided on hom 12,<br>
As best seen in FIG. 2, horn 12 contains a plurality of spiral slits 24. Preferably, the width of slits 24 is between 2% and 65% of the outside diameter of horn 12. This, of course, will affect how many slits 24 can be made on hom 12 (e.g., if slits 24 are 65% of the diameter of horn 12, then only one slit 24 may be cut into horn 12). The width of slits 24 selected will depend upon the desired about: of torsional movement. The depth of slits 24 in hom 12 preferably is between 4% and 45% of the outside diameter of hom 12. Slits 24 may have a fiat or square cut bottom, but preferably have a rounded or radfused bottom, which are easier to manufacture. The length of slits 24 preferably is between,8% and 75% of the length of the larger diameter of horn 12. The pitch of slits 24 preferably is between 125% and 500% of the larger diameter of horn 12.  By way of example, the<br>
inventors have found that one suitable configuration of slits 24 on horn 12 with an outside diameter of 0.475 inches is a total of eight slits 24. having a width of 0.04 inches, a depth of 0.140 (with a full radius bottom), a length of 0.7 inches and a pitch of 1,35 inches gives suitable torsional movement of horn 12 without compromising the longitudinal movement of horn 12.<br>
As best seen in FIG. 1, the location of longitudinal and torsional nodal points (the points with zero velocity of the respective mode) is important for proper functioning of handpiece 10. The torsional node 26 preferably is located at the proximal longitudinal node 28, so that the torsional node 26 and the longitudinal node 28 are coincident, e.g., both of which axe located on plug 18. Handpiece 10 also contains a distal longitudinal node 30 located at reduced diameter portion 32 of horn 12.<br>
As best seen in FIG. 3. drive circuit 34 that may be used with handpiece 10 of the present invention preferably is similar to that described in U.S. Patent No. 5,431,664, the entire contents of which being incorporated herein by reference, in that drive circuit 34 tracks admittance of handpiece 10 and controls the frequency of handpiece 10 to maintain a constant admittance. However, drive circuit 34 monitors both the torsional mode and the longitudinal mode and controls these modes in handpiece 10 using two different drive frequencies. Preferably, the torsional drive signal is approximately 32 kHz and the longitudinal drive signal is 44 kHz. but these frequencies will change depending upon the piezoelectric elements 14 used and the size and shape of horn 12 and slits 24. Although both the longitudinal or the torsional drive signal may be supplied in a continuous manner, preferably the longitudinal drive signal and the torsion drive signal are alternated, so that the drive signal is provided in a desired pulse at one. frequency and then switched to the other frequency for a similar pulse, with no overlap between the two frequencies, but no gap or pause in the drive signal. Alternatively, the drive signal can be operated in a similar manner as described, but short pauses or gaps in the drive signal can be introduced. In addition, the amplitude of the drive signal can be modulated and set independently for each frequency.<br>
The pause or gap between drive signals can serve various purposes. One purpose<br>
is to allow for the ultrasound movement of piezoelectric elements 14 and horn 12 to attenuate or stop so that lens fragments can once again be suctioned to tip 20 and an occlusion reestablished, thereby increasing the holding force on the lens fragment. Reestablishing the occlusion will increase cutting efficiency of the following pulse of ultrasound, whether longitudinal or torsional. Another purpose of the pause or gap: between drive signals is to allow for the ultrasound movement of piezoelectric elements 14 and horn 12 to attenuate or stop prior to the other (either longitudinal or torsional) mode being excited. Such attenuation between drive signals will reduce amount of potential non-linear interactions in the system which can generate undesirable heat and lead to premature degradation of piezoelectric elements 14 or mechanical failure of the entire assembly.<br>
Alternatively, there can be a slight overlap in the longitudinal and torsional drive signals. The overlap may provide relatively short time intervals when the added action of both torsional and longitudinal displacements results in especially fast rate of lens emulsificarion, and yet the overlap is short enough to prevent piezoelectric elements 14 from premature degradation or failure of the entire mechanical assembly as a result of excessive stress.<br>
Yet another alternative if to have both longitudinal and torsional drive signals overlap completely thus residting in applying high stress levels to the lens material when the two signals overlap, and yet leaving a pause in between for the occlusion to reestablish itself and vacuum build-up, thus improving efficiency of the following pulse application,<br>
Still another alternative is to apply a continuous longitudinal signal with a pulsed torsional signal, or vice versa, a continuous torsional signal with a pulsed longitudinal signal. Continuous application of torsional ultrasound does not cause repulsion because tip 20 movement is oriented perpendicular to the direction of the engagement of tip 20 with the lens, and the pulsed applications of longitudinal ultrasound are short enough to prevent overheat or mechanical damage to piezoelectric elements 14.<br>
Additionally, as discussed above, both the longitudinal and torsional drive signals<br>
can be applied continuously and simultaneously, with the amplitudes of the both signals being selected such that overheating and excessive mechanical stress on the system is reduced. If such a drive scheme is to be used, two sets of piezoelectric elements 14 are preferred with the torsional signal being applied to one set, while longitudinal signal applied to the other set.<br>
Finally, longitudinal motion of the tip helps to clear material that is aspirated into the tip in a manner similar to peristaltic pumping. Torsional motion of the tip does not produce this peristaltic movement. As a result, tip 20 can tend to clog when purely torsional movement is used. Clogging of the tip is evidenced by a rise is aspiration vacuum in aspiration line 50, such vacuum being created by pump 70. Therefore, when an increase in aspiration vacuum is sensed in aspiration line 50 by pressure sensor 60, sensor 60 provides this information to drive circuit 34. When the sensed vacuum exceeds a predetermined threshold, longitudinal mode can be enabled briefly or increased in intensity or duration to help clear any clogging. One skilled in the art will recognize that variations in the duration and/or timing of the longitudinal pulse can be made as required to clear adequately any clogging of the tip. Additionally, certain higher torsional power levels may be more prone to clogging than lower power levels. Therefore, longitudinal motion can be triggered automatically and at variable power levels when the torsional power level reaches a pre-selected power level. One skilled in the art will also recognize that the phrase "power level" encompasses both the amplitude (stroke) and pulse duty cycle.<br>
While certain embodiments of the present invention have been described above, these descriptions are given for purposes of illustration and explanation. Variations, changes, modifications and departures from the systems and methods disclosed above may bejadopted without departure from the scope or spirit of the present invention. For example, the primary drive single can have a first frequency and enable torsional movement while the secondary drive signal can have a second frequency and enable longitudinal movement, or visa versa.<br><br><br>
