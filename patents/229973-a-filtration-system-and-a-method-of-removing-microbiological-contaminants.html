Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment(s)<br>
The fiber-fiber composite of the present invention includes majority fibers and minority fibers, wherein the majority fibers are present in an amount greater than the linority fibers. The minority fibers are present as a binder to provide an adhesive force coalescing the majority fibers into the composite structure when the minority fibers are heated to at least their softening joint up to and including their melting point. The fiber-fiber composite of the present invention is useful as a filter medium alone and in combination with traditional filter media such as, for example, activated carbon fi1ter media. The tight pore structure of the fiber-fiber composite of the present invention provides short diffusion distances from a fluid to the surface of the composite by adsorption or diffusive interception making it an excellent medium for fluid filtration- Pre-or post-treatment of the fiber-fiber composite can impart properties such as , for example, hydrophi1i city, hydrophobicity, anti -microbial activity, and electro-static charge. The integrated paper can be formed using, preferably, wet laid paper-making processes for speed and efficiency.<br>
The fiber-fiber composite has a mean pore diameter of less than or equal to about 1 micron, and preferably, less than or equal to about 0.75 micron, more preferably less than or equal to about 0.5 micron, and can be as low as 0.2 microns. The bubble point, largest pore size, of<br><br>
the composite is about 2.0 to about 8.0 microns, but can also be less than about 2.0 microns. The tight pore structure of the composite provides greater than about 99.95% reduction of particulates having a. particle size of less than about 5 microns, while having tremendous art holding capacity. The fiber-fiber composite preferably has a thickness of about 0.05 to about 0.3 millimeters. The wet strength of the fiber-fiber composite is preferably about 10 to about 30% of the dry strength value, or greater than about 0,013 kg/mm. The Fibers in the Fiber-Fiber Composite<br>
The fiber-fiber composite of the present invention includes majority fibers and minority fibers. The minority fibers preferably provide an adhesive force that coalesces the majority fibers into the composite structure, preferably a flat sheet, paper-like structure. The adhesive force necessary to coalesce the majority fibers can be provided by heat and/or modest pressure. As the average fiber diameter decreases, the pore size of the fiber-fiber composite declines. Compression of the composite by calendaring will reduce the porosity of the composite and compress the fibers to further reduce pore size.<br>
The Majority Fibers<br>
One or more types of fibers may be present as the majority fibers. Majority fibers useful in making the integrated paper of the present invention are any fibers that can be fibrillated into nanofibers that have a softening point at least about 25'C greater than that of<br><br>
the minority fibers such that upon heat or pressure, the majority fibers do not melt and foul the pore structure of the composite. The fibers preferably comprise organic polymeric fibers .that .are capable of being fibrillated. Fibrillated fibers are most preferred due to their exceptionally fine dimensions and potentially low cost. Such fibrillated fibers include, but are not limited to, polymers such as polyamide, acrylic, acrylonitrile; liquid crystal polymers such as VECTRAN® and ZYLON®, and the like; ion-exchange resins; engineered resins; cel1ulose; rayon; ramie; wool; silk; glass; metal; ceramic; other fibrous materials; or combinations thereof. Combinations of organic and inorganic fibers and/or whiskers whether fibrillated or not, are contemplated and within the scope of the invention. For example, glass, ceratnic, or metal fibers and polymeric fibers may be used together. Class or metal fibers can provide additional wet strength to the integrated paper. In a most preferred embodiment, fibrillated lyocell fibers are used due to their exceptionally fine dimensions and potentially low cost.<br>
Fibrillatable cellulose fibers can be made by direct dissolution and spinning of wood pulpinan organic solvent, such as an amine oxide, and are known as lyocell fibers. Lyocell fibers have the advantage of being produced in a consistent, uniform manner, thus yielding reproducible results, which may not be the case for, for example, natural cellulose fibers. Further, the fibrils of lyocell are often curled. The curls provide a<br><br>
significant amount of fiber entanglement. As an added advantage, the fibrillated lyocell fibers may be produced in large quantities using equipment of modest capital cost. It will be understood that fibers other than cellulose may be fibrillated to produce extremely fine fibri1s, such as f o r example, syntheticfibers, in particular, acrylic or polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers, or other cellulosic materials.<br>
When produced by a wet laid process from fibers such as eel1ulose or polymer fibers, such nanofibers should have a Canadian Standard Freeness of less than or equal to about 100, preferably less than or equal to about 45, and most preferably less than or equal to about 0, However, it should be recognized that in some cases, Canadian Standard Freeness is not an ideal measure of fiber size, as in the case of extremely stiff fibers such as those produced from liquid crystal polymers such as VECTRAN®. In these cases, the fiber size should be directly assayed using microscopy. Preferably, a significant portion of the nanofibers should have an average fiber diameter less than or equal to about 1000 nanometers, more preferably less than or equal to about 400 nanometers, and nanofibers less than or equal to about 250 nanometers in diameter are most preferred.<br>
It is preferable to chop the original fibers prior to fibrillation to a length of about 1 millimeter to about 8 millimeters, preferably about 2 millimeters to about 6 millimeters, and more preferably about 3 millimeters to about 4 millimeters, and to sustain this<br><br>
fiber length during the fibrillation process by avoiding excessive fiber cutting.<br>
The Minority Fibers<br>
The minority fibers preferably have a softening point at least 25oC below that of the majority fibers, or of the majority fibers that have the lowest softening point. Preferably, the minority fibers are thermoset or thermoplastic materials. Fibers such as polyvinyl alcohol that dissolve at elevated temperatures i n the presence of moisture are also useful as minority fibers.<br>
The minority fibers can have average fiber diameters above and below the sub-micron range. As the fiber diameter of the minority fibers decrease, the amount of minority fibers needed to coalesce the majority fibers decrease provided that the mi norityfibers are well distributed amongst the majority fibers to provide the desirable degree of wet and dry strength. The pore structure of the fiber-fiber composite varies with the average fiber diameters of the majority and minority fibers. The pore structure of the composite can be further reduced when using minority fibers that shrink when heated as a result of a release of residual stress trapped within the fiber during the manufacturing process. This can pull the structure inward and make the pores smaller.<br>
If the majority and minority fibers are similar in average fiber diameters, this leads to the highest porosity, the most uniform pore size, and the highest permeability in the resulting fiber-fiber composite.<br><br>
Thus, it is preferred, but not necessary, to fibrillate the minority fibers such that the minority fibers have similar Canadian Standard Freeness and dimensions as the majority fibers. <br>
Useful minority fibers that can act as binder fibers<br>
include, but are not limited to, polyolefins, polyvinyl<br>
halides, polyvinyl esters, polyvinyl ethers, polyvinyl<br>
alcohols, polyvi nylsuifates, polyvinyl phosphates,<br>
polyvi nyl	amines,	polyami des,	polyimides,<br>

Variations of the above materials and other useful polymers include the substitution of groups such as hydroxyl, halogen, lower alkyl groups, lower alkoxy groups, monocyclic aryl groups, and the like. Other potentially applicable materials include polymers such as polystyrenes and acrylonitrile-styrene copolymers, styrene-butadiene copolymers, and other non-crystal1ine or amorphous polymers and structures.<br>

copolymers, poly(chlorotrifluoroethylene), ethylene-<br>
chlorotrif1uoroethylene copolymers, poly (vinylidene<br>
fluoride), and poly(vinyl fluoride); polyamides, such as<br>
poly(6-aminocaproic acid) or poly(e-caprolactam),<br>

sebacami de), and poly(11-ami noundecanoic acid);<br>

cyclohexylenemethyl eneoxy terephthaloyl);	polyaryl<br>
sulfides, such as poly(p-phenylenesulfide) or poly(thio-1,4-phenylene); polyimides, such as poly(pyromellitimido-<br><br>
1,4-phenylene); polyolefins, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(l-butene), poly(2-butene), poly(1-pentene) , poly(2-pentene) , poly(3-methyl -1-pentene) , and poly(4-methyl-1-pentene); vinyl polymers, such as poly (vinyl acetate) , poly(vinylidene chloride) , and poly(vinyl chloride); diene polymers, such as 1,2-poly-1,3-butadiene, 1,4-poly-1,3-butadiene, polyisoprene, and polychloroprene; polystyrenes; and copolymers of the foregoing, such as acrylonitri1 ebutadiene-styrene (ABS) copolymers. Polyolefins that may be useful include polyethylene, linear low density polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(l-butene), poly(2-butene), poly(l-pentene), poly(2-pentene), poly(3-methyl-l-pentene), poly(4-methyl-l-pentene), and the like.<br>
Preferred minority fibers include polyethylene, polypropylene, acrylic, polyester-polypropylene or polypropylene-polyethylene bi-component fibers, or others can be used as long as they have a softening point less than the lowest softening point of the majority fibers, and preferably at least about 25oC lower than the lowest softening point of the majority fibers. Certain types of treated polyethylene fibers, when properly treated, as described below, are optimal, and have the additional benefit of not significantly interfering with the hydrophilic nature of the resulting fiber-fiber composite when used in modest volumes. Preferred minority fibers include FYBREL® synthetic fibers, and/or SHORT STUFF® Grades EST-8 and/or E385F, all of which are polyolefin based. FYBREL® is a polyolefin based synthetic pulp that<br><br>
is a highly fibrillated fiber. FYBREL® has excellent thermal moldability and provides a smooth surface to the fiber-fiber composite. SHORT STUFF® Grades EST-8 and E3-5F- are both highly fibrillated, high density polyethylene. All of these fibers are commercially available from Mini Fibers, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Preferred acrylic staple fibers can be obtained from Sterling Fibers, Inc., Pace, Florida, under the trade designation RES-25; Asahi Kasei Corporation, Tokyo, 3apan, under the trade name CASHMILONTM; and/or Mitsubishi Rayon America, New York, New York, as a 3 millimeter length fibrillatable staple fiber.<br>
Preferably, one or more types of minority fibers are present in a total amount of about 1% to about 20% by weight based on a total weight of the composite, more preferably about 4% to about 18%, and most preferably about 5% to about 15%. It is preferable that the binder material have a softening point that is significantly lower than a softening point of the majority fibers so that the composite can be heated to activate the binder fibers, while the composite does not me t and coalesce thereby losing porosity. Methods of Making the Fiber-Fiber Composite<br>
The fiber-fiber composite of the present invention is preferably made using wet laid processes for speed and economies of scale.<br>
In a preferred wet laid process, a fiber tow is chopped to a specific length, usually in the range of about 1 mi 11meter to about 8 mi 11 meters and in<br><br>
particular in the range of about 3 millimeters to about 4<br>
millimeters. The chopped fibers are fibrillated in a<br>
device having characteristics similar to a blender, or on<br>
a large scale, in machines commonly referred to as a "hi-<br>
low", a "beater" or a "refiner". The fiber is subjected<br>
to repetitive stresses, while further chopping and the<br>
reduction of fiber length is minimized. As the fibers<br>
undergo these stresses, the fibers split as a result of<br>
weaknesses between amorphous and crystalline regions and<br>
the Canadian Standard Freeness (CSF), which is determined<br>
by a method well known in the art, begins to decline.<br>
Samples of the resulting pulp can be removed at<br>
intervals, and the CSF used as an indirect measure of the<br>
extent of fibrillation. While the CSF value is slightly<br>
responsive to fiber length, it is strongly responsive to <br>
the degree of fiber fibrillation- Thus, the CSF, which<br>
is a measure of how easily water may be removed from the<br>
pulp, is a suitable means of monitoring the degree of<br>
fiber fibrillation whenever the fibers have a good<br>
tendency to form a wet-laid sheet. However, this is not<br>
necessarily the case when handling very stiff fibers such<br>
as those made from liquid crystal polymers such as<br>
VECTRAN®. If the surface area is very high, then very<br>
little water will be drained from the pulp in a given<br>
amount of time and the CSF value will become<br>
progressively lower as the fibers fibrillate more<br>
extensively-	Preferably, fibrillation occurs at<br>
temperatures greater than about 30oC to accelerate the process. However, when fibrillating fibers such as<br><br>
acrylic, lower temperatures can be used to avoid softening the acrylic fibers. Enzymes may be added to further accelerate the fibrillation process.<br>
The fibrillated fibers of a given CSF value can be<br>
directly used for producing the fiber-fiber composite or<br>
dewatered on a variety of different devices, including a<br>
dewatering press or belt, to produce a dewatered pulp.<br>
The dewatered pulp can be subsequently used to make a<br>
wet-1ai d fiber-fiber composite.	Generally, for<br>
application in the present invention, a pulp with a CSF of below 100 is used, preferably, "the CSF should be less than or equal to about 45, and more preferably less than or equal to about 0. A Canadian Standard Freeness below<br>
0	is achieved when the fibers are fibrillated beyond the<br>
time needed to achieve a Canadian Standard Freeness of 0.<br>
The fibers can be directly sent to pulp preparation<br>
systems to create a furnish suitable for making the<br>
fiber-fiber composite.<br>
To impart anti-microbial properties to the fiber-fiber composite, the fibrillated fibers can be treated with a microbiological interception enhancing agent. The fibers, or the fiber-fiber composite itself, can be chemical1y treated with any compatible mirobiological<br>
interception enhancing agent known in the art, with or<br>
without a biologically active metal. Examples of<br>
suitable anti-microbial agents include, without<br>
limitation, any bactericidal agent, bacteriostatic agent,<br>
fungicidal agent, fungistatic agent, or the like, that<br>
are preferably efficacious against a broad spectrum of<br><br>
microbes.	Specific examples of suitable<br>
bactericidal/bacteri ostati c agents i nclude, wi thout<br>
1imitation,	POLYMYCIN™,	BACITRACIN™,	l ysozyme,<br>
TRICLOSAN™, DOWCIDE™, quaternary ami ne salts,<br>
polyphenols, acid-anionic surfactants, amphoteric<br>
surfactant disinfectants, biguanidines, and the like.<br>
Specific examples of suitable fungicidal/fungistatic<br>
agents include, without limitation dithiocarbamates,<br>
phthalimides,	dicarboximi des,	organophosphates,<br>
benzimidazoles, carboxanilides, phenylamides, phosphites, and the like. A preferred microbiological interception enhancing agent is disclosed in co-pending U.S. Application Serial No. 10/286,695.<br>
The fiber mixture can be directly sent to pulp preparation systems to create a furnish suitable for paper making.<br>
Exemplary of a wet laid process includes mixing a pulp of fibrillated lyocell fibers having a Canadian Standard Freeness of about 0, with 12% by weight EST-8 binder fibers, and about 15% by weight MICROSTRAND® 110X-475 microglass fibers to form a slurry in deionized water. A furnish is formed with about 0.5% to about 2% consistency. It is preferable to add the microbiological interception enhancing agent to the slurry, if anti -microbial properties are desired in the fiber-fiber composite as described above. Next, this pulp is partially dewatered under vacuum and rinsed with deionized water to form a wet lap. Thereafter, the fiber slurry can be directly used in the production of the<br><br>
fiber-fiber composite. It is preferable to send the slurry directly into a paper making machine where the economies of scale are easily achieved in making an inexpensive fiber-fiber composite for use as a flat sheet medium.<br>
The fiber-fiber composite can also be densified during the paper-making process by passing the fiber-fiber composite through a wet press or through the use of a calendar to achieve maximum density in the final product. Heated calendaring of the composite promotes fiber-fiber bonds resulting in a densified composite with minimal tendency to shed fibers. Exemplary Applications Of The Fiber-Fiber Composite<br>
Many types of filtration devices and/or systems incorporating the fiber-fiber composite can be imagined. Described below are certain specific embodiments. However, these devices are exemplary and should not be construed as restricting the scope of the invention.<br>
The fiber-fiber composite of the present invention can be used alone as flat sheet media in radial, axial or cross flow applications, and can also be used in a pleated or spiral wound configuration. The tight pore structure of the fiber-fiber composite provides a short diffusion path and, therefore, rapid diffusion kinetics of microbiological contaminants in a flowing fluid to the surface of the composite, yet retain exceptional f1ow with low pressure differential. The tight pore structure also provides supplemental direct mechanical interception of microbiological contaminants, greater than or equal to<br><br>
about 99.95% interception of particles having an average particle size of 3 to 5 microns when the mean pore size of the fiber-fiber composite is less than about 0.75 rricrons as determined using an Automated Capillary Flow Porometer available from Porous Materials, Inc., Ithaca, Mew York, Bacterial and viral interception can be further enhanced with treatment with any compatible anti-microbial agent. Furthermore, the fiber-fiber composite can be treated with hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity agents known in the prior art to provide the desired wetting characteristics.<br>
When combined with other fi1ter media, the fiber-fiber composite can be used as a prefiltration wrap around an activated carbon block fi1ter medium. The condensed pore structure provides greater than or equal to about 99.95% interception of particles having an average particle size of 3 to 5 microns such that a carbon block that can only provide reduction in chorine, taste and odor can now provide mechanical interception of protozoan cysts such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia when used in conjunction with the fiber-fiber composite of the present invention.<br>
The fiber-fiber composite can also be used as one or both substrates in a flat sheet medium such as PLEKX® available from KX Industries, L.P., Orange, Connecticut, and disclosed in United States Patent No. 5,792,513, which is hereby incorporated by reference. In the PLEKX® "process", a mixture of active agents and particulate binder is laid on a substrate such as the fiber-fiber<br><br>
composite of the present invention. Should a water and vapor permeable top substrate be desirable, the fiber-fiber composite can be used as the top substrate of the PLEKX® material as well. The combined fiber-fiber composite PLEKX® product can be used as a flat sheet medium, pleated or spiral wound.<br>
A particulate prefilter may be added upstream from the fiber-fiber composite to prolong the service life of the filtration system. Such particulate prefilter are known to one of skill in the art.<br>
All configurations of the fiber-fiber composite with other types of filter media can be used in gravity or pressurize water filtration systems.<br>
While the present invention has been particularly described, in conjunction with a specific preferred embodiment, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description. It is therefore contemplated that the appended claims will embrace any such alternatives, modifications and variations as falling within the true scope and spirit of the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
