Field of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to an improved anti theft device for vehicles. More particularly the invention relates to an anti theft device for land vehicles especially four wheelers such as<br>
cars.<br>
This invention is an improvement in   or   a modification of the invention disclosed and<br>
claimed in out copending application no 943 MAS 2000 filed in 3  November 2000<br>
Prior art:<br>
Different types of vehicle alarm / vehicle anti theft devices are known in the art. The presently available vehicle alarm / vehicle anti theft device have the following main features:<br>
-	Sensors<br>
-	To sense door opening<br>
-	To sense bonnet opening<br>
-	On the front and rear windscreens<br>
-	To sense boot opening and.<br>
-	To sense vibration.<br>
Some of the known devices, in addition to the above sensors, have means to cut off<br>
Ignition.<br>
A known anti theft device is shown in fig 1 of the drawing accompanying this specification<br>
The anti theft device for vehicles which are available in the prior art comprises a micro controller unit (17) comprising a micro controller (18) , two electrolytic capacitors (19 &amp; 20) , one of which is for supplying regulated power to the micro controller , and another timing capacitor (21) being connected to the inputs of the micro controller being connected to a plurality of resistances (22 ) through plurality of diodes (23 ) , for protecting the micro controller from high or reverse voltage , the output terminals of the micro controller being<br><br>
connected to the base of a of bipolar transistor (24 ) the output of the bipolar transistor (24) being connected to the coil of the of a relay (25), for driving the relay , the input of a voltage regulator being connected to the power source , the output of the voyage regulator(26) being connected to the inputs of the capacitor for supplying regulated power to the micro controller, the interactive terminals of the micro controller being connected to a radio frequency receiver (27), the terminals of the diodes (23) being capable of being connected to sensors (28) and the output of the relay being capable of being connected to a siren (29)<br>
In the above described present day known anti theft device, it has in the vehicle a siren, which whenever, anyone tampers with the doors or bonnet of the vehicle, initiates the siren, the sound of which will draw the attention of the nearby peoples as well the owner of the vehicle only local attention.<br>
The main drawbacks of these presently available anti theft devices are the following:<br>
The sensors in the present day theft devices are placed in the doorframes. Such an arrangement does not activate the sensors when the window panes are pulled down consequently there will be no siren. Thus a person can get access to the inside portion of the vehicle and to the accessories inside without giving any alarm to the nearby people. Such an access can also facilitate opening of the bonnet, snip off the sirens power supply thereby silencing the siren. The person can use the ignition, dismantle the steering lock and drive away the vehicle as if he is the owner of the vehicle without giving any alarm for the nearby people and / or to the real owner of the vehicle.<br>
Passers by mostly view the siren hooting quizzically and if the person manages to silence the siren, the people will not notice and he can drive away the vehicle as if he is the real over of the vehicle<br>
In addition in the present day device there is no provision for locking the wheels. Hence any body can drive / push the vehicle away without the owner noticing such a move<br><br>
Further since the bonnet is not locked any person can have access to various accessories and can drive away the vehicle without any bodies notice / attention<br>
If the real owner of the vehicle is not in the vicinity of the vehicle he will not be in a position to view and or to know as to what is happening to his vehicle until he comes to take the vehicle On the other hand if the owner is in a place, beyond hearing of the siren, he would not even be able to hear the siren to prevent any theft of his vehicle.<br>
Since, in the modem times, the theft of the vehicles are increasing and the cost of the vehicles have gone up steeply there is a need for an efficient anti theft device which would overcome most of the major drawbacks of the hitherto known devices<br>
Therefore, the main objective of the present invention, is to provide an improved anti theft device for vehicles, which overcomes most of the major draw backs of the hitherto known devices<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved anti theft device for vehicles having the various parts such as windows, doors, bonnet etc of the vehicles which are activated whenever such parts are broken or pulled down.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is, is to provide an improved anti theft device for vehicles which is made active or inactive by using a numerical code, which can be set and reset by the user using a code by employing a key board.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is, to provide an improved anti theft device for vehicles, in which all the accessories such as, bonnet, boot and brake, are electromechanically locked whenever the anti theft device is put into the active mode thereby preventing the movement of the vehicle<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is, to provide an improved anti theft device for vehicles, wherein when a breach of security takes place, the sensors senses the breach<br><br>
and sends the signal to the micro controller unit which in turn, through the relay, triggers the radio frequency transmitter or mobile phone<br>
The above objectives of the present invention has been achieved by developing a novel and improved anti theft device which facilitates in (i) making the device active or inactive by using a numerical code, which can be set and reset by the user using a code by employing a key board (ii) the accessories of the vehicles such as, bonnet, boot and brake etc, are electromechanically locked whenever the anti theft device is put into the active mode thereby preventing the movement of the vehicle and (iii) when a breach of security takes place , the sensors senses the breach and sends the signal to the micro controller unit which in turn, through the relay , triggers the radio frequency transmitter or mobile phone.<br>
To the best of my knowledge such an anti theft device is not hitherto known and therefore is novel.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings,<br>
wherein:<br>

The micro controller (1) drives the LCD display and key board (10) for making the necessary code entries, sensors which are fixed at various points in the vehicle sense the breach of security, give an alarm signal to the micro controller unit which in turn switches on the radio frequency transmitter (13) to send an alarm sighing to a radio frequency<br><br>
receiver carried by the vehicle user / alarm signal via mobile module or phone to a mobile phone or a landline of the vehicle user.<br>
In the micro controller unit the diodes and resistances pass the sensor signals to the micro controller (1) senses if there is any change in the zones. B.P.T. (6) switches on relays (8), putting off the ignition and on / off the electromagnetic locks. Sensors used are, micro switches, proximity magnetic sensors and pulsed infrared sensors. The tilt sensor is a self designed modified gyroscope contraption it memorizes the inclination at which the alarm is activated. If a change occurs from this position a signal is sent to the micro controller (1).<br>
The keyboard and LCD shown in fig 3 is used for password code entry to put on / off the  lament.<br>
Procedure to arm the auto anti theft device:<br>
1.	Press the appropriate key in the keyboard for checking as to whether zones are secured / locked. Then the position of the zones will be displayed in the LCD located on the key board. If any zone(s) is / are not secured, then, manually the zones have to be secured properly. If the zones are secured then the next step is<br>
2.	Keying the changeable code number in the keyboard. If the code is correct the LCD will read as -ALL LOCK. In this condition all doors, boot, bonnet and brakes will be electro magnetically locked. If the code is wrong the user is allowed 5 tries. Affirm which the micro controller unit will be triggered causing the siren to hoot and the radio frequency transmitter will release signals, which will be received by the radio frequency receiver. The device will not accept any more commands.<br><br>
3.	The device is then activated<br>
4.	When the ALARM STANDBY is displayed in the LCD , then press ENTER, now the driver has a maximum of twenty seconds ( adjustable for individual preference up to ninety seconds) get out of the vehicle and lock his door. The alarm will go to armed status after the<br><br>
time memorized. Now if anyone tries to open the Bonnet, Windows, Windscreen, Boot or Jack up the vehicle the alarm will set on in the users radio frequency pager/ mobile phone. 5.   A LED in the radio frequency transmitter in the form of mobile phone   will signal to indicate that the user is within range of the radio frequency transmitter.<br>
Whenever the vehicle is broken (breach of security), the sensors sends signals to the micro controller unit which triggers the radio frequency transmitter to release the which will be received the radio frequency dedicated receiver as well as hoot the siren signals Thus the person having the radio frequency dedicated receiver in the form of mobile phone will come to know about the breach of security of his vehicle<br>
