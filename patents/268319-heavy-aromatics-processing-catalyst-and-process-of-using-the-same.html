				<td>HEAVY AROMATICS PROCESSING CATALYST AND PROCESS OF USING THE SAME<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001]	The disclosure relates to the catalyst, process and apparatus for conversion of<br>
heavy aromatics, specifically C9+ aromatics, to lighter aromatic products, particularly xylenes.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]	A source of benzene and xylene is catalytic reformate, which is prepared by<br>
contacting a mixture of petroleum naphtha and hydrogen with a strong hydrogenation/dehydrogenation catalyst, such as platinum, on a moderately acidic support, such as a halogen-treated alumina. Usually, a C6 to C8 fraction is separated from the reformate and extracted with a solvent selective for aromatics or aliphatics to produce a mixture of aromatic compounds that is relatively free of aliphatics. This mixture of aromatic compounds usually contains benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTX), along with ethylbenzene.<br>
[0003]	Refineries have also focused on the production of benzene and xylene by<br>
transalkylation of C9+ aromatics and toluene over noble metal-containing zeolite catalysts. During the transalkylation of C9+ aromatics and toluene to high value petrochemical products, such as benzene and xylene, over catalysts containing noble metals, by-products, such as saturated compounds, are typically produced in the process. These by-products can boil in the same temperature range as the desired aromatic products, making separation of the desired products at high purity levels difficult. For example, a commercial benzene product may need a purity of 99.85 wt.% or higher. However, initial benzene purity after distillation of a transalkylation reaction product is typically only 99.2% to 99.5% due to the presence of coboilers, such as methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, 2,3-dimethylpentane, dimethylcyclopentane and 3-methylhexane. Therefore, an additional extraction step is usually required to further improve benzene product purity to the desired level.<br>
[0004]	One solution to the problem of the production of benzene co-boilers during the<br>
transalkylation of heavy aromatics is disclosed in US Pat. No. 5,942,651 and involves the steps of contacting a feed comprising C9+ aromatic hydrocarbons and toluene under transalkylation reaction conditions with a first catalyst composition comprising a zeolite<br>
having a constraint index ranging from 0.5 to 3, such as ZSM-12, and a hydrogenation component. The effluent resulting from the first contacting step is then contacted with a second catalyst composition which comprises a zeolite having a constraint index ranging from 3 to 12, such as ZSM-5, and which may be in a separate bed or a separate reactor from the first catalyst composition to produce a transalkylation reaction product comprising benzene and xylene. A benzene product having a purity of at least 99.85% may be obtained by distilling the benzene from the transalkylation reaction product, without the need for an additional extraction step. According to the '651 patent, the second catalyst composition comprises up to 20 wt;.% of the total weight of the first and second catalyst compositions.<br>
[0005]	US Pat. No. 5,905,051 discloses a process for converting a hydrocarbon<br>
stream such as, for example, a C9+ aromatic compound to C6 to C8 aromatic hydrocarbons, such as xylenes, by contacting the stream with a catalyst system comprising a first catalyst composition and a second catalyst composition, wherein said catalyst compositions are present in separate stages and are not physically mixed or blended and wherein said first catalyst composition is a metal-promoted, alumina- or silica-bound zeolite beta, and said second catalyst composition is ZSM-5 having incorporated therein an activity promoter selected from the group consisting of silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, and combinations thereof According to the '051 patent, the use of the separate catalytic stages improves the conversion of C9+ aromatic compounds and naphthalenes to xylenes and decreases the amount of undesirable ethylbenzene in the product.<br>
[0006]	US	Pat.	No.	5,030,787	discloses	an	improved<br>
disproportionation/transalkylation process. The improved process of this invention is conducted such that transalkylation of a C9+ aromatics feedstock, or disproportionation of a feedstock containing toluene and C9+ aromatic(s), is carried out in the vapor-phase by containing said feedstock in a reaction zone with a catalyst comprising a zeolite possessing a Constraint Index, as defined below, of from 1 to about 3 and preferably which has been hydrogen, hydrogen precursor and/or non-noble Group VIII metal exchanged, thermally treated and/or hydrothermally treated, under conditions effective to convert such feedstock to a product containing substantial quantities of C6 -C8 aromatic compounds, e.g. benzene and xylene(s), especially the latter. The product effluent is separated and distilled to remove the desired products. If desired, any unreacted material(s), e.g., toluene and/or C9+ compound(s), can be recycled.<br>
[0007]	US Pat. No. 5,030,787 discloses a transalkylation process to convert a heavy<br>
aromatics feed to lighter aromatics products, such as benzene, toluene and xylenes by contacting a C9+ aromatics fraction and benzene and/or toluene over a catalyst comprising a zeolite, such as ZSM-12, and a hydrogenation component, preferably platinum. The catalyst, with hydrogenation component, is treated to reduce aromatics loss. Treatment includes exposure to steam and/or sulfur after incorporation of the hydrogenation component. For additional stability and aromatics retention, the steamed and/or sulfur treated catalyst is sulfided by cofeeding a source of sulfur. In a further embodiment of the invention, a low hydrogen partial pressure is employed to retain aromatics.<br>
[0008]	US Pat. No. 7,148,391 discloses a single stage catalyst system comprising at<br>
least two different molecular sieves that exhibits enhanced activity for the removal of ethyl-group containing aromatic compounds in C9+ aromatic feeds without overall reduction in the conversion of the C9+ feed to useful compounds, such as xylenes.<br>
[0009]	Improving catalytic activity and stability are challenges for most of the<br>
catalytic transalkylation processes. High activity catalyst normally requires less catalyst and/or less severe reaction conditions to manufacture the same amount of product, which means lower cost for production and high production efficiency. As the catalyst ages with increasing time on stream, higher temperatures are normally required to maintain constant conversion. When the maximum reactor temperature is reached, the catalyst needs to be replaced or regenerated. Depending on the feed composition, the cycle length varies from a few months to as long as a few years for a transalkylation catalyst. A catalyst having high stability normally requires less frequent regeneration or change-out and long time on stream, which translates to lower cost for production and high production efficiency.<br>
[0010]	The aging rate of catalysts used for the transalkylation of heavy aromatics is<br>
normally dependent on the nature of the feed composition. The higher the ratio of C9+ aromatics to C6-C7 aromatics, the greater the aging rate. In addition, the aging rate usually increases with an increasing concentration of material having C10+ aromatics, which are byproducts of the transalkylation process. There are many chemical reactions that can lead to the formation of these heavier compounds, for example:<br>
(Equation Removed) <br>
[0011]	There is, therefore, a need for a catalyst system to minimize the formation of<br>
these heavy aromatic compounds as they may be precursors for the formation of coke which reduces catalyst activity. One common feature of these reactions producing heavy aromatics is that most of them contain at least one reactant having an alkyl substituent with two or more carbon atoms, for example, an ethyl group or a propyl group. These molecules normally comprise a significant fraction of the feed to a transalkylation unit. Sometimes, ethyl-methylbenzenes and ethyl-dimethylbenzenes can comprise up to one third of the C9+ feed to the transalkylation unit. It has now been discovered that minimizing the reactions of these ethyl and propyl aromatics improves catalytic activity and/or aging rate.<br>
[0012]	In order to minimize these reactions of C10+ formation, it is preferable to<br>
dealkylate the ethyl and propyl groups from the aromatic molecules, and saturate the resulting olefin to prevent realkylation onto an aromatic ring. We surprisingly found that by dealkylating the ethyl and/or propyl groups in the feedstock, the formation of heavier aromatics, i.e., C10+ aromatics, is minimized, therefore reducing the catalyst aging rate. Not intended to be limited by any theory, we believe that it is desirable to de-alkylate the ethyl and propyl groups in the feed before undergoing transalkylation reactions. We found a catalyst system comprising a first catalyst that favors dealkylation over transalkylation reactions and a second catalyst that favors transalkylation over dealkylation reactions and the feedstock feeding to the first catalyst prior to the second catalyst. While not wishing to be bound by theory, we believe that transalkylation reactions take place via biphenylic-type transition states, and are favored in zeolitic catalysts having large channels, for example, in a 12 member-ring (12 MR) zeolites, e.g. mordenite, beta, ZSM-12, etc. Zeolites having 10 MR structures, for example ZSM-5 (MFI), tend to restrict the formation of this transition state necessary for transalkylation reactions, and therefore favor dealkylation reactions instead.<br>
[0013]	We, therefore, disclose a catalyst system for the transalkylation of C9+<br>
aromatics with C6-C7 aromatics. The catalyst system comprises (a) a first catalyst comprising a molecular sieve having a Constraint Index in the range of 3-12 (e.g., a 10 MR molecular<br>
sieve, such as ZSM-5, ZSM-11, ZSM-22, and ZSM-23) and a metal catalyzing the saturation<br>
of the olefins formed by the dealkylation reactions and (b) a second catalyst comprising a<br>
molecular sieve having a Constraint Index in the range of less than 3 (e.g., a 12 MR<br>
molecular sieve, such as ZSM-12, MOR, zeolite beta, MCM-22 family molecular sieve) and<br>
optionally a metal which may be the same or different to the metal on the first catalyst.<br>
[0014]	We also surprisingly discovered the catalyst system and a new process of<br>
using the catalyst system for transalkylation reactions comprising contacting a C9+ feed with the first catalyst to form a product and then contacting at least a portion of the product with the second catalyst. This novel process allows for processing of heavy aromatic feed at high space velocities (high catalytic activity), which provides a significant advantage for a higher throughput transalkylation process. In addition, we surprisingly discovered that the use of this process and/or the catalyst system results in low aging rates for the catalyst system, thereby extending cycle lengths.<br>

[0046]	The Constraint Index is a convenient measure of the extent to which an<br>
aluminosilicate or molecular sieve provides controlled access to molecules of varying sizes to its internal structure. For example, aluminosilicates which provide a highly restricted access to and egress from its internal structure have a high value for the constraint index, and aluminosilicates of this kind usually have pores of small size, e.g. less than 5 Angstroms. On the other hand, aluminosilicates which provide relatively free access to the internal aluminosilicate structure have a low value for the constraint index, and usually pores of large size.

[0051]	Typically, the first catalyst comprises at least 1 wt.%, preferably at least 10<br>
wt.%, more preferably at least 50 wt.%, and most preferably at least 65 wt.%, of the first molecular sieve. The second catalyst comprises at least 1 wt.%, preferably at least 10 wt.%, more preferably at least 50 wt.%, and most preferably at least 65 wt.%, of the second molecular sieve.<br>
[0052]	The catalyst system has a weight ratio of the first catalyst over the second<br>
catalyst in the range of 5:95 to 75:25, preferably in the range of 10:90 to 60:40, and more preferably in the range of 20:80 to 50:50.<br>
[0053]	In some embodiments, the first molecular sieve has an Alpha value of at least<br>
150, such as at least 300. In other embodiments, the first molecular sieve has an Alpha value in the range of 100-1500, preferably in the range of 300-600.<br>
[0054]	Where the first molecular sieve is ZSM-5, the ZSM-5 can have a composition<br>
involving the molar YO2 over X2O3 = n, wherein X is a trivalent element, such as aluminum, boron, iron, indium and/or gallium, preferably aluminum; Y is a tetravalent element, such as silicon, tin and/or germanium, preferably silicon; and n is less than 1000, such as from 10 to less than 100. The ZSM-5 may further be selected so as to have an average crystal size of less than 0.1 micron, such as about 0.05 micron, and a Diffusion Parameter, D/r2, for mesitylene of at least 1000 x 10-6 sec"', such as at least 2000 x 10-6 sec"', when measured at a temperature of 100°C and a mesitylene pressure of 2 torr.<br>
[0055]	In a preferred embodiment, the first molecular sieve is ZSM-5 and the second<br>
molecular sieve is ZSM-12.<br>
[0056]	Where the second molecular sieve is ZSM-12, the ZSM-12 can have a<br>
composition involving the molar YO2 over X2O3 = n, wherein X is a trivalent element, such<br>
as aluminum, boron, iron, indium and/or gallium, preferably aluminum; Y is a tetravalent<br>
element, such as silicon, tin and/or germanium, preferably silicon; and n is less than 500,<br>
such as from 50 to less than 300. The ZSM-12 may further be selected so as to have an<br>
average crystal size of less than 0.1 micron, such as about 0.05 micron, and a Diffusion<br>
Parameter, D/r2, for mesitylene of at least 1000 x 10-6 sec"', such as at least 2000 x 10-6 sec-1,<br>
when measured at a temperature of 100°C and a mesitylene pressure of 2 torr.<br>
[0057]	As used herein, the Diffusion Parameter of a particular porous crystalline<br>
material is defined as D/r2 xl06 , wherein D is the diffusion coefficient (cm /sec) and r is the crystal radius (cm). The required diffusion parameters can be derived from sorption measurements provided the assumption is made that the plane sheet model describes the diffusion process. Thus for a given sorbate loading Q, the value Q/Q∞, where Q∞ is the<br>
equilibrium sorbate loading, is mathematically related to (Dt/r2)½ where t is the time (sec) required to reach the sorbate loading Q. Graphical solutions for the plane sheet model are given by J. Crank in "The Mathematics of Diffusion", Oxford University Press, Ely House, London, 1967.<br>
[0058]	In some embodiments, the second molecular sieve has an Alpha value of at<br>
least 20, such as at least 30. In other embodiments, the second molecular sieve has an Alpha value in the range of 20-500, preferably in the range of 20-100, alternatively in the range of 40-100 or 30-100.<br>
[0059]	The alpha value test is a measure of the cracking activity of a catalyst and is<br>
described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,354,078 and in the Journal of Catalysis. Vol. 4, p. 527 (1965); Vol. 6, p. 278 (1966); and Vol. 61, p. 395 (1980), each incorporated herein by reference as to that description. The experimental conditions of the test used herein include a constant temperature of 538°C and a variable flow rate as described in detail in the Journal of Catalvsis.Vol. 61.p. 395.<br>
[0060]	It may be desirable to incorporate each molecular sieve in the catalyst<br>
composition with another material that is resistant to the temperatures and other conditions employed in the transalkylation process of the disclosure. Such materials include active and inactive materials and synthetic or naturally occurring zeolites, as well as inorganic materials such as clays, silica and/or metal oxides such as alumina. The inorganic material may be<br>
either naturally occurring, or in the form of gelatinous precipitates or gels including mixtures of silica and metal oxides.<br>
[0061]	Use of a material in conjunction with each molecular sieve, i.e. combined<br>
therewith or present during its synthesis, which itself is catalytically active, may change the conversion and/or selectivity of the catalyst composition. Inactive materials suitably serve as diluents to control the amount of conversion so that transalkylated products can be obtained in an economical and orderly manner without employing other means for controlling the rate of reaction. These catalytically active or inactive materials may be incorporated into, for example, naturally occurring clays, e.g. bentonite and kaolin, to improve the crush strength of the catalyst composition under commercial operating conditions. It is desirable to provide a catalyst composition having good crush strength because in commercial use, it is desirable to prevent the catalyst composition from breaking down into powder-like materials.<br>
[0062]	Naturally occurring clays that can be composited with each molecular sieve as<br>
a binder for the catalyst composition include the montmorillonite and kaolin family, which families include the subbentonites, and the kaolins commonly known as Dixie, McNamee, Georgia and Florida clays or others in which the main mineral constituent is halloysite, kaolinite, dickite, nacrite or anauxite. Such clays can be used in the raw state as originally mined or initially subjected to calcination, acid treatment or chemical modification.<br>
[0063]	In addition to the foregoing materials, each molecular sieve can be composited<br>
with a porous matrix binder material, such as an inorganic oxide selected from the group consisting of silica, alumina, zirconia, titania, thoria, beryllia, magnesia, and combinations thereof, such as silica-alumina, silica-magnesia, silica-zirconia, silica-thoria, silica-beryllia, silica-titania, as well as ternary compositions such as silica-alumina-thoria, silica-alumina-zirconia, silica-alumina-magnesia and silica-magnesia-zirconia. It may also be advantageous to provide at least a part of the foregoing porous matrix binder material in colloidal form so as to facilitate extrusion of the catalyst composition.<br>
[0064]	Each molecular sieve is usually admixed with the binder or matrix material so<br>
that the final catalyst composition contains the binder or matrix material in an amount ranging from 5 to 95 wt.%, and typically from 10 to 60 wt.%.<br>
[0065]	The first catalyst comprises 0.01 to 5 wt.%, preferably 0.1 to 2 wt.%, more<br>
preferably 0.1 to 1 wt.%, of a first metal element of Groups 6-10. The second catalyst<br>
comprises 0 to 5 w1:.%, preferably 0.01 to 2 wt.%, more preferably 0.01 to 1 wt.%, of a second metal element of Groups 6-10. The first metal element and the second metal element may be at least one hydrogenation component, such as tungsten, vanadium, molybdenum, rhenium, chromium, manganese, a metal selected from Groups 6-10 of the Periodic Table of the Elements, or mixtures thereof Specific examples of useful metals are iron, ruthenium, osmium, nickel, cobah, rhodium, iridium, and noble metals such as platinum or palladium. Preferably, the hydrogenation component is palladium, platinum or rhenium.<br>
[0066]	The amount of the hydrogenation component is selected according to a<br>
balance between hydrogenation activity and catalytic functionality. Less of the hydrogenation component is required when the most active metals such as platinum are used as compared to palladium, which does not possess such strong hydrogenation activity. Generally, the catalyst composition contains less than 5 wt.% of the hydrogenation component and typically from 0.01 wt.% to 2 wt.% of the component.<br>
[0067]	The   hydrogenation   component   can   be   incorporated   into   the   catalyst<br>
composition by co-crystallization, exchanged into the composition to the extent a Group 13 element, e.g., aluminum, is in the molecular sieve structure, impregnated therein, or mixed with the molecular sieve and binder. Such component can be impregnated in or on the molecular sieve, for example in the case of platinum, by treating the molecular sieve with a solution containing a platinum metal-containing ion. Suitable platinum compounds for impregnating the catalyst with platinum include chloroplatinic acid, platinous chloride and various compounds containing the platinum ammine complex, such as Pt(NH3)4Cl2.H2O.<br>
[0068]	Alternatively, a compound of the hydrogenation component may be added to<br>
the molecular sieve when it is being composited with a binder, or after the molecular sieve and binder have been formed into particles by extrusion or pelletizing.<br>
[0069]	After treatment with the hydrogenation component, the molecular sieve is<br>
usually dried by heating at a temperature of 65°C to 160°C, typically 110°C to 143°C, for at least 1 minute and generally not longer than 24 hours, at pressures ranging from 100 to 200 kPa-a. Thereafter, the molecular sieve may be calcined in a stream of dry gas, such as air or nitrogen, at temperatures of from 260°C to 650°C for 1 to 20 hours. Calcination is typically conducted at pressures ranging from 100 to 300 kPa-a.<br>
[0070]	Prior to use, steam treatment of the catalyst composition may be employed to<br>
minimize the aromatic hydrogenation activity of the catalyst composition. In the steaming process, the catalyst composition is usually contacted with from 5 to 100% steam, at a temperature of at least 260° to 650°C for at least one hour, specifically 1 to 20 hours, at a pressure of 100 to 2590 kPa-a.<br>
[0071]	In addition, prior to contacting the catalyst composition with the hydrocarbon<br>
feed, the hydrogenation component can be sulfided. This is conveniently accomplished by contacting the catalyst with a source of sulfur, such as hydrogen sulfide, at a temperature ranging from about 320 to 480°C. The source of sulfur can be contacted with the catalyst via a carrier gas, such as hydrogen or nitrogen. Sulfiding per se is known and sulfiding of the hydrogenation component can be accomplished without more than routine experimentation by one of ordinary skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure.<br>

following Examples.<br>
Examples:<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
[0091]	A ZSM-5 zeolite having a Si/Ah ratio of ~87 and crystal dimensions of 2 - 4<br>
µm was formulated into a 1/20" quadrilobe extrudate using Versal 300 alumina such that the mass ratio of zeolite crystal to alumina was 1:1. This extrudate was converted into the acidic form by exchanging with NH4NO3, followed by calcination, and then steamed to moderate the catalyst activity to an alpha value of about 450. 0.5% Rhenium was then added to the catalyst via incipient wetness techniques known to those skilled in the art. This catalyst was<br>
then tested in a fixed-bed microunit. The reactor pressure was 350 psig and the H2:HC ratio was 2:1. The feed to the reactor contained 85% heavy aromatics and 15% benzene + toluene. A detailed analysis of the feed is shown in Table 1. The catalyst was reduced in hydrogen for 1 hour at 400°C and 2500 kPa-a prior to the introduction of feed. The activity of the catalyst was determined as a function of reactor temperature spanning the range from 380 to 420°C. The total feed flowrate, expressed as grams feed per gram catalyst per hour (WHSV) was 10 hr-1. Product analysis occurred using on-line GC-FID with a 60m DB-WAX column. Separate off-line analyses of the light gas produced occurred using a GC-FID with a 60m DB-1 column.<br>

[0092]	The analysis of the performance of the catalyst for dealkylation of heavy<br>
aromatics at 420°C is shown in Table 2.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
[0093]	A ZSM-5 zeolite having a Si/Ah ratio of ~57 and crystal dimensions of  ~0.05-<br>
0.1 µm was formulated into a 1/16" cylindrical extrudate using Versal 300 alumina such that the mass ratio of zeolite crystal to alumina was 1.86:1. This extrudate was converted into the acidic form by exchanging with NH4NO3, followed by calcination, and then steamed to a catalyst activity, as measured by the alpha test, that was similar to the catalyst in Comparative<br>
Example 1. 0.5% Rhenium was then added to the catalyst via incipient wetness techniques known to those skilled in the art. This catalyst was then tested in a fixed-bed microunit in the same manner as the catalyst in Comparative Example I. The analysis of the performance of this catalyst for dealkylation of heavy aromatics at 420°C is shown in Table 2.<br>
Comparative Example 3<br>
[0094]	A ZSM-5 zeolite having a Si/Al2 ratio of ~56 and crystal dimensions of 1 - 2<br>
µm was formulated into a 1/16" cylindrical extrudate using Versal 300 alumina such that the mass ratio of zeolite crystal to alumina was 1.86:1. This extrudate was converted into the acidic form by exchanging with NH4NO3, followed by calcination, and then steamed to a catalyst activity, as measured by the alpha test, that was similar to the catalyst in Comparative Example 1. 0.5% Rhenium was then added to the catalyst via incipient wetness techniques known to those skilled in the art. This catalyst was then tested in a fixed-bed microunit in the same manner as the catalyst in Comparative Example 1. The analysis of the performance of this catalyst for dealkylation of heavy aromatics at 420°C is shown in Table 2.<br>
Table 2<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
[0095]	Analysis of the performance of the catalysts shows that these catalysts are very<br>
effective for dealkylating the feed. Conversion of ethyltoluenes varies from 76.2 % to 87.9 % at 420°C, and generally increases with decreasing crystal size of the ZSM-5. Overall de-ethylation rates, including ethyltoluene, ethylxylene and diethyl aromatics varied from 59.2 % to 82.7 % at 420°C. Depropylation rates, of predominately cumene and n-propylbenzene, were 94.0 % for the larger crystals and 98.6% for the smaller crystals. Production of heavy components, e.g. alkylindanes, naphthalenes, alkylnaphthalenes, etc, was low. These data illustrate the suitability of this catalyst for dealkylating the heavy aromatics feed. This dealkylated feed is now more suitable for transalkylation reactions in a second catalyst bed as the C9+:C7+C6 ratio has been decreased. Comparative Example 4<br>
[0096]	A ZSM-5 zeolite having a Si/Al2 ratio of~56 and crystal dimensions of~0.05-<br>
0.1 µm was formulated into a 1/20" quadrilobe extrudate using Versal 300 alumina such that the mass ratio of zeolite crystal to alumina was 1.86:1. This extrudate was converted into the acidic form by exchanging with NH4NO3, followed by calcination, and then steamed to a catalyst activity, as measured by the alpha test, that was similar to the catalyst in Comparative Example 1. 0.075 wt.% Platinum was then added to the catalyst via incipient wetness techniques known to those skilled in the art. This catalyst was then tested in a fixed-bed microunit in the same manner as the catalyst in Comparative Example 1. The analysis of the performance of this catalyst for dealkylation of heavy aromatics at 420°C is shown in Table 3.<br>
Comparative Example 5<br>
[0097]	A ZSM-5 zeolite having a Si/Al2 ratio of ~56 and crystal dimensions of ~0.05-<br>
0.1 µm was formulated into a 1/20" quadrilobe extrudate using Versal 300 alumina such that the mass ratio of zeolite crystal to alumina was 1.86:1. This extrudate was converted into the acidic form by exchanging with NH4NO3, followed by calcination, and then steamed to a catalyst activity, as measured by the alpha test, that was similar to the catalyst in Comparative Example 1. 0.075 wt.% Platinum and 0.3 wt.% Rhenium were then added to the catalyst via incipient wetness techniques known to those skilled in the art. This catalyst was then tested in a fixed-bed microunit in the same manner as the catalyst in Comparative Example 1. The analysis of the performance of this catalyst for dealkylation of heavy aromatics at 420°C is shown in Table 3.<br>
Comparative Example 6<br>
[0098]	A ZSM-5 zeolite having a Si/Ah ratio of ~56 and crystal dimensions of ~0.05-<br>
0.1 µm was formulated into a 1/16" cylindrical extrudate using Versal 300 alumina such that the mass ratio of zeolite crystal to alumina was 1.86:1. About 0.115 wt.% Platinum was added to the catalyst during preparation. This extrudate was converted into the acidic form by exchanging with NH4NO3, followed by calcination, and then steamed to a catalyst activity, as measured by the alpha test, that was similar to the catalyst in Comparative Example 1. This catalyst was then tested in a fixed-bed microunit in the same manner as the catalyst in Comparative Example 1. The analysis of the performance of this catalyst for dealkylation of heavy aromatics at 420°C is shown in Table 3.<br>
Comparative Example 7<br>
[0099]	A ZSM-5 zeolite having a Si/Ah ratio of ~56 and crystal dimensions of ~0.05-<br>
0.1 |xm was formulated into a 1/20" quadrilobe extrudate using Versal 300 alumina such that the mass ratio of zeolite crystal to alumina was 1:1. This extrudate was converted into the acidic form by exchanging with NH4NO3, followed by calcination, and then steamed to a catalyst activity, as measured by the alpha test, that was similar to the catalyst in Comparative Example 1. 0.075% Platinum was then added to the catalyst via incipient wetness techniques known to those skilled in the art. This catalyst was then tested in a fixed-bed microunit in the same manner as the catalyst in Comparative Example 1. The analysis of the performance of this catalyst for dealkylation of heavy aromatics at 420°C is shown in Table 3.<br>
Table 3<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
[00100]	Analysis of the performance of these catalysts show that they are very<br>
effective at dealkylating the heavy aromatic feed. Overall de-ethylation rates with these catalysts vary from 81.9% to 90.3%, and overall de-propylation rates vary from 98.9% to 99.3%. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that a high olefin saturation activity of the metal enhances the overall dealkylation activity as the olefins are saturated before having the opportunity to re-alkylate onto an aromatic ring. However, if the metal activity is too high, then aromatic ring saturation can occur and ring losses can increase. Comparative Example 8<br>
[00101]	A ZSM-12 zeolite having a Si/Al2 ratio of -200 and crystal dimensions of<br>
-0.1 µm was formulated into a 1/16" cylindrical extrudate using Versal 300 alumina such that the mass ratio of zeolite crystal to alumina was 1.86:1. About 0.1 wt.% Platinum was added to the catalyst during preparation. This extrudate was converted into the acidic form by exchanging with NH4NO3, followed by calcination, and then steamed to moderate the catalyst activity. This catalyst was then tested in a fixed-bed microunit. The reactor pressure was 2514 kPa-a and the H2:HC ratio was 2:1. The feed to the reactor contained 85 wt.% C9+ and 15 wt.% benzene + toluene. A detailed analysis of the feed is shown in Table 1. The catalyst was<br>
initially reduced in hydrogen at 427°C and 350 psig, then sulfided with 5 moles of H2S per mole of platinum on the catalyst prior to the introduction of feed. The reactor temperature was set to maintain an overall C9+C10 conversion of ~57.5±0.5 wt.%. The total feed flowrate, expressed as grams feed per gram catalyst per hour (WHSV) was 3 hr'. Product analysis (see Table 4) occurred using on-line GC-FID with a 60m DB-WAX column.<br>
Table 4<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
[00102]	The aging rate, expressed as the increase in temperature required to maintain<br>
constant conversion was 6.2°C per month for this catalyst. As the data in Table 4 shows, the single bed system produces a significant amount of heavier components, specifically C11+ aromatics.<br>
Example 1<br>
[00103]	The transalkylation  of heavy  aromatics  with  benzene  and  toluene  was<br>
demonstrated over the dual bed catalyst system of this disclosure in a fixed-bed microunit. The top bed was a 1/20" quadrilobe 50:50 ZSM-5:Al2O3 extrudate that had been impregnated with 0.5 wt.% Re, the same catalyst tested in Comparative Example 1. The bottom bed was a 1/16" cylindrical  65:35  ZSM-12:Al2O3  extrudate containing 0.1   wt.% Pt, as used  in<br>
Comparative Example 8. The ratio of the top bed to the bottom bed was 3:7. The reactor pressure was 2514 kPa-a and the H2:HC ratio was 2:1. The feed to the reactor contained 85 wt.% C9+ aromatic feedstock and 15 wt.% benzene + toluene. A detailed analysis of the feed is shown in Table 1. The reactor temperature was varied between 412°C and 432°, and the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) was varied between 2.8 and 4 hr"'. On start-up, the catalyst beds were reduced in hydrogen at 420°C and 350 psig, and then sulfided with 5 moles of H2S per mole of platinum and rhenium on the catalyst prior to introducing feed. After feed was introduced, the catalyst beds were de-edged by running with a H2:HC ratio of 1 for the first 48 hours. Product analysis (see table 5) occurred using on-line GC-FID with a 60m DB-WAX column.<br>
Table 5<br>
(Table Removed) <br><br>
[00104]	As the data in Table 5 indicates, the dual bed catalyst system has higher<br>
overall dealkylation rates despite the fact that a higher space velocity is being used. In addition, the amount of heavy components, specifically C11+ aromatics, is down by almost a factor of 2. As a result, the aging rate, expressed as the increase in temperature required to maintain constant conversion was 1.6°C per month for this catalyst, a significant improvement over the single bed comparative example.<br>
[00105]	As has been indicated by this disclosure, the use of a dual bed system for<br>
heavy aromatics transalkylation provides significant benefits over existing technologies. The dual bed system allows for processing of heavier feeds, and for processing feeds at higher throughput through the reactor, thereby increasing production. In addition, the low aging rate of this dual bed system allows for longer catalyst cycles, and the reduced down-time resulting from reduced catalyst change-outs or catalyst regenerations leads to significant monetary savings.<br>
