Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The materials used in the synthesis of the metal zirconium phosphates according to the invention are commercial-grade chemicals. Preferably the starting materials used are water-soluble Zirconium Oxychloride, metal chlorides and phosphoric acid with 5 to 20% concentration.<br>
The compounds of the invention are prepared using the sol-gel technique. Preferably an aqueous metal chloride having a metal concentration in the range of 1.25 to 22.0 M is dissolved in water along with zirconium oxychloride having a concentration of 0.4 to 1.0 M Zirconium. The solution is poured in a reactor and stirred to get a homogeneous mixture. Phosphoric acid with 5 to 20 % concentration is added drop by drop to the solution while stirring. Addition of phosphoric acid precipitate a gel. The resulting gel is dried to remove moisture and sintered at 800°C to 1000°C in a kiln for 8-16 hours.
