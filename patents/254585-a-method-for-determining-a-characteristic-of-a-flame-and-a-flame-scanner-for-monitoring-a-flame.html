INTELLIGENT FLAME SCANNER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]     The present invention is related to a flame scanner for monitoring<br>
flames produced by a fossil fuel fired combustion chamber, and more<br>
particularly to such a flame scanner that provides an indication of both<br>
presence and characteristics of a flame.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]     A flame scanner monitors the combustion process in a fossil fuel<br>
fired combustion chamber to provide a signal indicating the presence or<br>
absence of a stable flame. With the presence of a stable flame it is safe to<br>
continue feeding fossil fuei into the combustion chamber of the steam<br>
generator. In the event that the flame becomes unstable, or the flame is lost<br>
completely (known as a flame out condition), the flame scanner provides a<br>
loss of flame signal. Based upon a loss of flame signal, fossil fuel delivery to<br>
the combustion chamber can be discontinued before an unsafe operating<br>
condition develops. In some systems, a human operator interrupts the fuel<br>
supply based upon the loss of flame signal; in other systems a burner<br><br><br>
WO 2006/091617	PCT/US2006/006160<br>
management system (BMS) interrupts the fuel supply based upon the loss of<br>
flame signal.<br>
[0003]    Conventional flame scanners produce an electrical signal based<br>
upon a monitored flame. This resulting analog electrical signal is transmitted<br>
to processing electronics that are housed separately from the flame scanner,<br>
typically in an equipment rack located adjacent to a control room. The<br>
strength of the produced signal is typically proportional to the intensity of the<br>
monitored flame. If the signal strength falls below a lower set point, or raises<br>
above an upper set point, delivery of main fuel into the combustion chamber<br>
is interrupted. Set points are sometimes referred to as trip points.<br>
[0004]    The signal path from each flame scanner to the processing<br>
electronics is via a double-shielded cable, which typically includes five<br>
conductors. Because of the size of each double-shielded cable as well as the<br>
number of double-shielded cables, one being required for each flame<br>
scanner, a considerable amount of space is necessary for routing cable<br>
bundles to the processing electronics. Additionally, because of the type and<br>
number of cables required, high initial capital outlay costs are required.<br>
Accordingly, a need exists for a flame scanner having fewer and less<br>
expensive cabling requirements.<br>
[0005]     One type of flame scanner is an ultraviolet tube flame scanner<br>
which produces a pulsed electrical output whose pulse rate is proportional to<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/091617	PCT/US2006/006160<br>
the intensity of ultraviolet light, in the range of approximately 250 to 400<br>
nanometers, emitted by a flame. These scanners are particularly suited for<br>
monitoring gas flames since the emission from gas flames can be primarily in<br>
the ultraviolet range, with only minimal visible light emissions. Ultraviolet<br>
flame scanners based on Geiger mueller tubes require extensive<br>
maintenance and have relatively limited operational lives as well as unsafe<br>
failure modes.<br>
[0006]     Another type of flame scanner is a photodiode flame scanner.<br>
Photodiode flame scanners are the most prevalent type of flame scanner in<br>
use today in industrial application. In these flame scanners, visible light, in<br>
the range of approximately 400 to 675 nanometers, is collected from inside a<br>
combustion chamber, transmitted through a fiber optic cable, and directed<br>
onto a single photodiode to produce an electrical signal utilized by the<br>
separate processing electronics. Photodiode flame scanners are well suited<br>
for monitoring oil and coal flames, as emissions from such flames are in the<br>
visible and near infrared ranges.<br>
[0007]     Flames produced by the burning of different types of fuels have<br>
different characteristics. For example, a flame produced by burning a first<br>
fuel (a first flame type) might produce one color light, i.e., light in one portion<br>
of the spectrum, while a flame produced by burning a second fuel (a second<br>
flame type) might produce another, different, color light, i.e., light in a different<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/091617	PCT/US2006/006160<br>
portion of the spectrum. Conventional flame scanners do not differentiate<br>
between, or even recognize, different colors. That is, conventional flame<br>
scanners 'see' in black-and-white.<br>
[0008]     However, one conventional flame scanner is known that can<br>
recognize an oil flame when oil flames and coal flames are present.<br>
However, this flame scanner cannot, at the same time, recognize the coal<br>
flame. Thus, this flame scanner is somewhat useful for monitoring oil flames,<br>
but limited in monitoring coal flames.<br>
[0009]     Many modem combustion chambers burn two types of fuels, such<br>
as a dual coal and oil burner system. Additionally, a gas- or oil-fired ignitor<br>
may be typically used as an ignition source for the main fuel(s). Thus, it is not<br>
uncommon for multiple types of flame scanners, one for each type of fuel, to<br>
be utilized together. It should be noted that the types of fuels are not limited<br>
to oil, coal, and natural gas. Other types of fuels whose flames are monitored<br>
include, but are not limited to, black liquor and waste gas fuels.<br>
[0010]     Utilizing multiple types of flame scanners results in higher initial<br>
capital outlays, as well as increased maintenance costs. If a single flame<br>
scanner could detect flames produced by multiple types of fuels, fewer flame<br>
scanners would be required, reducing both capital and maintenance costs.<br>
Accordingly, a need exists for a flame scanner that can detect flames<br>
produced by multiple types of fuels.<br>

OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0011]     It is an object of the present invention to provide a flame scanner<br>
having reduced cabling requirements.<br>
[0012] It is another object of the present invention to provide a flame<br>
scanner having reduced cabling requirements while maintaining suitable<br>
redundancy and integration to bus.<br>
[0013]     It is also an object of the present invention to provide a flame<br>
scanner capable of detecting flames produced by multiple types of fuels.<br>
[0014]     Another object of the present invention is to provide a flame<br>
scanner that is capable of differentiating between multiple monitored flames.<br>
[0015]     Still another object of the present invention is to provide a flame<br>
scanner that is capable of simultaneous monitoring of multiple flame types.<br>
[0016]     The above-stated objects, as well as other objects, features, and<br>
advantages, of the present invention will become readily apparent from the<br>
following detailed description which is to be read in conjunction with the<br>
appended drawings.<br>

WO 2006/091617	PCT/US2006/006160<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0017]    A method and a flame scanner for determining a characteristic of a<br>
flame are provided herein. The determined characteristic could be any type<br>
of characteristic associated with a flame, including, but not limited to, flame<br>
presence, flame quality, flame type, and an air/fuel mixture ratio. The flame<br>
scanner includes a flame sensor, a splitter, and a processor. The flame<br>
sensor, splitter, and processor operate together to implement the method<br>
described herein. Also, in some aspects of the present invention, the flame<br>
scanner includes a memory, and in others the flame scanner includes a<br>
display.<br>
[0018]     In accordance with the method, a flame is monitored across a<br>
contiguous spectral range to detect light emitted by the flame. That is, all light<br>
emitted by the flame in that continuous, unbroken spectral range is detected.<br>
The contiguous spectra) range is segmented into multiple discrete ranges.<br>
Detected light in each of at least one discrete range is respectively processed<br>
to determine at least one characteristic of the flame. Thus, detected light in<br>
only one or more certain ranges is processed to determine a characteristic, or<br>
characteristics.<br>
[0019]     In one aspect of the present invention, the monitored contiguous<br>
spectral range is 350 to 1100 nanometers. Thus, light that falls within the<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/091617	PCT/US2006/006160<br>
range of 350 to 1100 nanometers is detected. In another aspect, the plurality<br>
of discrete ranges is at least seven ranges.<br>
[0020]     According to another aspect of the present invention, at least one<br>
flame signature is stored. Each flame signature is associated with burning a<br>
particular type of fuel. Thus, a first flame signature might be associated with<br>
burning one type of oil, while a second flame signature could be associated<br>
with burning natural gas. A flame signature consists of known data<br>
associated with burning a particular type fuel. In this aspect, the processing<br>
to determine the at least one characteristic includes processing the detected<br>
light, across the one or more discrete ranges, along with one stored flame<br>
signature. Thus, the one or more characteristic is determined based both<br>
upon the detected light and a stored flame signature.<br>
[0021]     In a further aspect, each stored flame signature includes at least<br>
one of multiple types of information associated with burning a type of fuel.<br>
The information is at least one of DC intensity data, flicker intensity data,<br>
flicker frequency data, and spectral shape data.<br>
[0022]     In another further aspect, two flames are monitored at the same<br>
time. The first flame is associated with a first type fuel, and the second flame<br>
is associated with a second type fuel different than the first type fuel.<br>
Detected light emitted by the second flame across each of one or more of the<br>
multiple discrete ranges is respectively processed with another stored flame<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/091617	PCT/US2006/006160<br>
signature to determine at least one characteristic of the second flame. The<br>
other stored flame signature is different than the flame signature processed in<br>
determining the characteristic of the first flame.  In this further aspect, the<br>
one or more discrete ranges associated with determining the one or more<br>
characteristics of the first flame could be the same as, or different than, the<br>
one or more discrete ranges associated with determining the one or more<br>
characteristics of the second flame.<br>
[0023]     According to an even further aspect, at least one of the plurality of<br>
ranges considered in determining the at least one characteristic of the first<br>
flame is not considered in determining the at least one characteristic of the<br>
second flame.<br>
[0024]     In another aspect of the present invention, the monitoring,<br>
segmenting, and processing are performed by a first one of a plurality of<br>
flame scanners. Information associated with the determination is transmitted<br>
from the first flame scanner to a remote location. This information is<br>
transmitted to the remote location via at least another one of the plurality of<br>
flame scanners. That is, the multiple flame scanners are serially linked to the<br>
remote location. The remote location, in this aspect, could be any location.<br>
[0025]     In still another aspect, the monitoring, segmenting, and processing<br>
are performed by a flame scanner, and information associated with the<br>
determination is displayed on the flame scanner. This information could be<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/091617	PCT/US2006/006160<br>
the determination itself, or information ancillary and associated with the<br>
determination. For example, the displayed information could be the spectral<br>
shape of the monitored flame.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
9<br><br>
[0031]     With reference to the Figures, and particularly Figure 1, included in<br>
a flame scanner 100 of the present invention are a lens assembly 101, a fiber<br>
optic cable assembly 105, and a detector head assembly 110. The detector<br>
head assembly 110 mounts to an outside wall 115 of a combustion chamber,<br>
while the lens assembly 101 is positioned inside the combustion chamber,<br>
with the fiber optic cable assembly 105 connecting the detector head<br>
assembly 110 and the lens assembly 101 through the outside wall 115.<br>
Preferably, all metal components of the lens assembly 101 and the fiber optic<br>
cable assembly 105 that are subjected to high heat are constructed of type<br>
304 stainless steel. Flame scanner 100 may be, as desired, utilized in either<br>
tangential fired (T-fired) or wall-fired boilers, as well as used with any, or all of,<br>
coal-, oil-, gas-, and/or other fuel-fired burners. The detector head assembly<br>
110 preferably is configured such that cooling and/or purge air may be<br>
connected, as desired. However, preferably the temperature rating of the lens<br>
assembly 101 and fiber optic cable is 900 degrees F (482.2 degrees C), thus<br>
cooling air is not required. As desired, purge air may be utilized. Preferred<br>
purge air flow is 4-10 SCFM (approximately 0.11-0.28 SCMM) for low<br>
pressure air, such as that from a low pressure blower (10" wc), or 3-5 SCFM<br>
(approximately 0.08-0.14 SCMM) for compressed air. The detector head<br>
assembly 110 is cast aluminum, though other materials may be utilized, and<br>
includes pins (not shown) for mounting the detector head assembly 110 to the<br>
outside wall 115.<br>
[0032]     The lens assembly 101 includes a replaceable quartz lens. The<br>
fiber optic cable assembly 105 includes a fiber optic cable 103 that is<br>
preferably of a 1/8" (0.32 cm) diameter and made of blue enhanced<br>
W04/028-0					10<br><br><br>
borosilicate fiber optic cable. Use of a blue enhanced borosilicate fiber optic<br>
cable provides a cleaner signal path, improving light transmission as<br>
compared to other type fiber optic cables.   The fiber optic cable 103<br>
transmits light collected by the quartz lens to a splitter 106 located inside the<br>
detector head assembly 110. Quartz or other cables may be utilized, as<br>
desired.<br>
[0033]     The splitter 106 directs the collected light onto each of multiple<br>
photodiodes 107a-107n. Preferably, six photodiodes are utilized, however,<br>
fewer or more photodiodes could be utilized, as desired. Each photodiode<br>
107a-107n converts light energy into an electrical signal. Each electrical<br>
signal is then sent to an onboard digital signal processor 108. Use of an<br>
onboard digital signal processor 108 replaces the separate and remote<br>
processing electronics of conventional flame scanners.  The digital signal<br>
processor 108 preferably samples at a rate of 2000 Hz to perform frequency<br>
analysis of between 10 to 200 Hz. Additionally, the digital signal processor<br>
108 is preferably of a 16-bit design and operates at 40 MIPS, enabling real<br>
time frequency analysis. The electronics preferably include automatic gain<br>
control to allow a minimum of 18 bit analog to digital conversion.<br>
W04/028-0					11<br><br><br>
WO 2006/091617	PCT/US2006/006160<br>
[0034]     The output from each of the multiple photodiodes 107a-107n<br>
represents flame Intensity In a unique spectral range, from infra-red to<br>
ultraviolet frequencies. This provides a flame scanner having better flame<br>
discrimination, improved ability to distinguish one burner from another<br>
(between support fuel flame and other burner flames), and improved ability to<br>
discriminate the type of fuel being burned.<br>
[0035]      Taken together, these unique spectral ranges form a contiguous<br>
spectral range, including ultraviolet, visible, and infrared light. Preferably the<br>
contiguous spectral range is from 300 to 1100 nanometers. However, as<br>
desired, a wider or a narrower contiguous spectral range could be formed.<br>
The output from each photodiode 107a-107n is proportional to the intensity of<br>
the captured light in the respective unique spectral range.<br>
[0036]     The digital signal processor 108 communicates with a memory 109.<br>
As desired, the digital signal processor 108 and the memory 109 may be<br>
combined into a single unit. Stored in the memory 109 is at least one flame<br>
signature. Each stored flame signature represents a flame produced from<br>
burning a different type of fuel, such as natural gas, oil, and/or one or more<br>
types of coal.<br>
[0037]     Raw flame signature data is obtained by recording the DC voltage<br>
output from each of the multiple photodiodes 107a-107n over a finite time<br>
period, such as five minutes, resulting from the monitoring, with the flame<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/091617	PCT/US2006/006160<br>
scanner 100, of a flame known to be stable. This is known as auto-tuning.<br>
Alternatively, raw flame signature data may be gathered utilizing devices<br>
other than the flame scanner 100. In such a case, the raw flame signature<br>
data nonetheless corresponds to the specific spectral range associated with<br>
each of the multiple photodiodes 107a-107n. Preferably, the flame scanner<br>
memory 109 stores flame signatures for flames of each type of fuel burned in<br>
a combustion chamber monitored by the flame scanner 100. That is, a<br>
memory 109 of one flame scanner 100 can store a set of one or more flame<br>
signatures, while a memory 109 of another flame scanner 100 can store a<br>
different set of one or more flame signatures.<br>
[0038]     Figure 2 is a simplified graphical depiction of stored refined flame<br>
signature data for a single one of the multiple photodiodes 107a-107n. It<br>
should be understood that refined flame signature data for each one of the<br>
multiple photodiodes 107a-107n is stored in the memory 109. Refined flame<br>
signature data is based upon raw flame signature data. That is, raw flame<br>
signature data is converted into and stored as refined flame signature data by<br>
the digital signal processor 108.<br>
[0039]     A first type of refined flame signature data is known as DC intensity<br>
data. DC intensity data is closely related to the raw flame signature data. DC<br>
intensity data includes the maximum raw DC voltage recorded, the minimum<br>
raw DC voltage recorded, and an average raw DC voltage recorded, for each<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/091617	PCT/US2006/006160<br>
of the multiple photodiodes 107a-107n. For example, based upon the<br>
exemplary raw flame signature date of Figure 2, the maximum raw DC<br>
voltage is 11, the minimum raw DC voltage is 1.5, and the average raw DC<br>
voltage is 6.<br>
[0040]    A second type of refined flame signature data is known as flicker<br>
intensity data and is a measure of the amplitude of each recorded peak of the<br>
raw flame signature data as compared to the recorded trough preceding that<br>
peak, for each of the multiple photodiodes 107a-107n. Flicker intensity data<br>
includes the maximum amplitude, the minimum amplitude, and average<br>
amplitude, for each of the multiple photodiodes 107a-107n.<br>
[0041]    A third type of refined flame signature data is known as flicker<br>
frequency data and is a measure of the number of peaks of the raw flame<br>
signature data within a given timeframe for each of the multiple photodiodes<br>
107a-107n. Flicker frequency data includes the maximum flicker frequency,<br>
the minimum flicker frequency, and an average flicker frequency for each of<br>
the multiple photodiodes 107a-107n.<br>
[0042]     A fourth type of refined flame signature data is known as spectral<br>
shape data. This data, which is a combination of recorded raw data from<br>
each of the multiple photodiodes 107a-107n, reflects where on the spectrum<br>
a monitored flame produces light. Figure 3 is a simplified graphical depiction<br>
of spectral shape data for a single monitored flame.<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/091617	PCT/US2006/006160<br>
[0043]     In operation, the signal processor 108 continually analyses the<br>
signals output from the multiple photodiodes 107a-107n in view of the stored<br>
flame signature data. Based upon this analysis, the flame scanner 100<br>
reliably and accurately not only detects loss of flame, but also provides other<br>
information associated with monitored flames and the operation of the flame<br>
scanner 100 itself, as will be described below.<br>
[0044]     Loss of flame may be detected, as desired, based upon any one of,<br>
or any combination of, the different types of stored flame signature data. That<br>
is, loss of flame may be detected based upon DC intensity data, flicker<br>
intensity data, flicker frequency data and/or spectral shape data. Further, loss<br>
of flame may be detected, as desired, based upon stored flame signature<br>
data associated with any one of, or any combination of, the multiple<br>
photodiodes 107a-107n.<br>
[0045]     If the signal output from one or more photodiodes 107a-107n falls<br>
below one or more stored minimum value and/or stored average value, a trip<br>
signal is transmitted to a human operator and/or BMS controlling the<br>
monitored combustion chamber. Also, if the signal output from one or more<br>
photodiodes 107a-107n is greater than one or more stored maximum value, a<br>
trip signal is transmitted to the operator and/or BMS. Based upon receipt of<br>
such a signal, the operator and/or BMS may then take appropriate action,<br>
such as discontinuing supply of fuel to the combustion chamber. Thus, the<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/091617	PCT/US2006/006160<br>
stored minimums, maximums, and averages serve as set points for tripping<br>
fuel supply to the combustion chamber.<br>
[0046]     Because flames produced from the burning of different type fuels<br>
have different flame signatures, the signal processor 108 is programmable to<br>
generate trip signals based upon those flame signature characteristics known<br>
to be most closely associated with the flame being monitored. As introduced<br>
above, one type flame might produce light in one spectral range, while<br>
another type flame might produce light in another spectral range.<br>
Additionally, different type flames are more closely associated with different<br>
ones of DC intensity, flicker intensity, and flicker frequency. For example, for<br>
one type flame, flicker frequency might be the most reliable indicator of a<br>
stable flame. Thus, as desired, the signal processor 108 can be programmed<br>
to analyze only those signals associated with the spectral range of the<br>
monitored flame, i.e., only the signal output from certain of the multiple<br>
photodiodes 107a-107n, in view of one or more of the stored flame signature<br>
data, i.e., one or more of DC intensity data, flicker intensity data, and/or flicker<br>
frequency data.<br>
[0047]     If the signal processor 108 is programmed to analyze multiple<br>
signals in view of one or more ones of the stored flame signature data, the<br>
programming, as desired, can result in transmission of a trip signal if any one<br>
signal violates any single trip point. Alternatively, the programming, as<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/091617	PCT/US2006/006160<br>
desired, can result in transmission of a trip signal only if a certain combination<br>
of different trip points are violated, or only if a certain number of different trip<br>
points are violated.<br>
[0048]     The stored flame signature data may be modified, as desired. A<br>
modification can include a complete replacement of flame signature data by<br>
recording new raw flame signature data with the flame scanner 100 and the<br>
digital signal processor 108 producing new refined flame signature data<br>
based upon the new raw data. Also, modification can be made to individual<br>
pieces of stored flame signature data. For example, stored minimum DC<br>
intensity voltage for one of the multiple photodiodes 107a-107n, determined<br>
by the digital signal processor 108, may be changed. User interfaces for<br>
modifying stored data, as well as other purposes, will be discussed further<br>
below.<br>
[0049]     The flame scanner 100 also determines flame quality based upon<br>
DC voltage data. Flame quality information is useful for operators and repair<br>
technicians. That is, degradation of flame quality is beneficially the basis for<br>
performing service on the flame scanner 100, such as cleaning or replacing<br>
the lens assembly 101 and/or the quartz lens. Flame quality is determined by<br>
the processor 108 based upon the stored average DC intensity data, the<br>
stored minimum DC intensity data, and the monitored DC intensity. The<br>
stored average DC intensity data is equal to a flame quality of 100%, and the<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2006/091617	PCT/US2006/006160<br>
stored minimum DC intensity data is equal to a flame quality of 0%. Thus, as<br>
the monitored DC intensity moves closer to the stored minimum DC intensity,<br>
flame quality decreases.<br>
[0050]     The digital signal processor 108 is programmed to generate a<br>
service warning whenever the monitored DC intensity falls below a certain<br>
percent, i.e., comes within a certain distance from 0%. Alternatively, or<br>
perhaps additionally, the digital signal processor 108 may be programmed to<br>
generate a service warning whenever the monitored DC intensity begins to<br>
trend downward, perhaps at a certain rate. The memory 109 stores the<br>
certain percent and/or the certain rate. A generated service warning is<br>
preferably transmitted to the control room, or perhaps to a remote location.<br>
[0051]     In addition to transmitting trip signals based upon violation of one or<br>
more of DC intensity data, flicker intensity data, and/or flicker frequency data,<br>
the digital signal processor 108 may be programmed, as desired, to transmit<br>
a trip signal based upon the spectral shape of the monitored flame. Thus,<br>
when the spectral shape of the monitored flame does not correspond to the<br>
stored spectral shape, a trip signal may be transmitted. Correspondence may<br>
be, as desired, based upon a percentage deviation of the monitored spectral<br>
shape to that of the stored spectral shape. The deviation may be either or<br>
both of the amplitude of the monitored spectral shape and the distribution of<br>
the monitored flame across the spectrum. Also as desired, monitored<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/091617	PCT/US2006/006160<br>
spectral shape data may be combined with one or more of the other<br>
monitored flame signature data to generate a trip signal. Similar to the<br>
discussion above, if the digital signal processor 108 is programmed to<br>
analyze multiple signals in view of one or more ones of the stored flame<br>
signature data and the spectral shape of the monitored flame, the<br>
programming can, as desired, result in transmission of a trip signal if any one<br>
signal violates any one single trip point or if the monitored spectral shape<br>
deviates from the stored spectral shape. Alternatively, the programming can,<br>
as desired, result in transmission of a trip signal only if a certain combination<br>
of different trip points and/or the spectral shape are violated, or only if a<br>
certain number of the trips are violated.<br>
[0052]     The stored spectral shape data is especially useful in discriminating<br>
between different types of flames in a single combustion chamber, thus<br>
reducing the number of scanners required. Introduced above, each type of<br>
flames produces light in a certain portion of the spectrum. Discussed above,<br>
the output from each photodiode 107a-107n is associated with a portion of<br>
the spectrum. It has been found that a ratio of relative peaks between certain<br>
ones of these outputs is a reliable indicator of a particular type of flame. For<br>
example, with reference to Figure 4, a 1.2 ratio between a relative peak in a<br>
first portion of the spectrum (associated with one photodiode) and a relative<br>
peak in a second portion of the spectrum (associated with another<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2006/091617	PCT/US2006/006160<br>
photodiode) might be associated with a first type fuel. Thus, in this example,<br>
the relative peak in the second portion of the spectrum will always be 1.2<br>
times higher than the relative peak in the first portion of the spectrum for this<br>
first type fuel.<br>
[0053]     These ratios have been proven to be reliable indicators of a flame<br>
type no matter how bright or how dim a flame is. The memory 109 stores<br>
ratios and the associated spectral portions for coal flames, oil flames, and gas<br>
flames. Based upon the monitored spectral data, a flame type can be<br>
determined and differentiated from other flame types being monitored at the<br>
same time by comparing the monitored spectrum to the stored ratio/spectraf<br>
portion information. Thus, the inventive flame scanner disclosed herein can<br>
monitor, and provide a positive indication of presence of, a coal flame at the<br>
same time as monitoring a gas flame. Of course, other flame type<br>
combinations can also be monitored at the same time to provide an indication<br>
of flame presence by flame type.<br>
[0054] The spectral data is also beneficially used to monitor the fuel/air<br>
mixture in the combustion chamber to control NOx emissions. Introduced<br>
above, the flame scanner 100 compares the spectral shape of a monitored<br>
flame to an expected spectral shape stored in the memory 109. Whenever<br>
the monitored flame does not have the expected spectral shape, the digital<br>
signal processor 108 analyses the monitored shape to determine if the fuel/air<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2006/091617	PCT/US2006/006160<br>
mixture ratio is correct. For example, too much yellow flame in a gas flame<br>
indicates the presence of an inappropriate amount of air in the mixture. The<br>
digital signal processor 108, in this example, would send a control signal<br>
directly to a burner management system to appropriately adjust the air in the<br>
mixture. Of course, such a corrective signal could alternatively be sent to the<br>
control room for operator use.<br>
[0055]     Outputs from the flame scanner 100 can be transmitted in various<br>
ways. Communication can be either by wiring to simple relays inside the<br>
flame scanner or through a sophisticated interface module of the digital signal<br>
processor 108. When by relays, the only information transmitted is generated<br>
trip signals.<br>
[0056]     However, when utilizing the interface module, all information<br>
produced by the digital signal processor 108 can be communicated to the<br>
control room, and as desired, remote locations. These communications can<br>
be, as desired, by Device Net, Industrial Ethernet, MODBUS, or RS-232<br>
communication protocols.<br>
[0057]     Especially beneficial, multiple ones of flame scanner 100 may be<br>
linked serially by a single cable to the control room, thus reducing cabling<br>
requirements by 75% compared to current flame scanner installations. Thus,<br>
the outputs of multiple ones of flame scanner 100 may be marshaled together<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2006/091617	PCT/US 2006/006160<br>
and transmitted via the same cable, while still maintaining redundancy<br>
required for safety.<br>
[0058]     As an example, a typical boiler includes four flame scanners (one<br>
per corner) on each of multiple levels. Thus, a four level boiler would have<br>
sixteen flame scanners. As described earlier, conventionally each of the<br>
sixteen flame scanners would be individually connected to the control room.<br>
That is, at least 16 cables would run to the control room. With the present<br>
invention, in this example, the number of cables is reduced to four, while still<br>
providing necessary redundancy. This is because, in this example, each of<br>
the four flame scanners 100 located on the same corner is serially connected<br>
to one another by a single cable that runs to the control room. This same<br>
arrangement is repeated for the remaining three corners. Even if two cables<br>
are severed or fail for some other reason, two flame scanners 100 on each<br>
level are still able to transmit information.<br>
[0059]     Any information that available for transmission by the flame<br>
scanner 100 is also is available via a user interface located on the back of the<br>
flame scanner 100. At the rear of the flame scanner 100 is a LED bargraph<br>
display which can be set to indicate flame quality, intensity, or any other<br>
parameters monitored, calculated, and/or determined by the flame scanner<br>
100. Additionally, the LED graph can be set to display the entire measured<br>
spectrum in real time, or only a portion of the measured spectrum.<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2006/091617	PCT/US2006/006160<br>
[0060]      All operational parameters can also be set from this user interface,<br>
in addition to via the network connection. These parameters include<br>
modifications to all stored information discussed above, including the set<br>
points and the flame signature data, whether raw or refined. Access to these<br>
operational parameters is controlled by password. Access to the user<br>
interface via the network connection can be done in the control room via a<br>
dedicated interface. Beneficially, network access to the user interface can<br>
also be made via a PC connected directly to the flame scanner 100, as well<br>
as via a PC in the control room.<br>
[0061]     The present invention is not to be limited in scope by the specific<br>
embodiments described herein. Indeed, various modifications of the present<br>
invention in addition to those described herein will be apparent to those of<br>
skill in the art from the foregoing description and accompanying drawings.<br>
Thus, such modifications are intended to fall within the scope of the appended<br>
claims.<br>
