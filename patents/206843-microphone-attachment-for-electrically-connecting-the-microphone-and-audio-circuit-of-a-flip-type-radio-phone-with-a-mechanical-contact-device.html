				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention concerns a flip-type radio phone, and more particularly a microphone attachment for electrically connecting the microphone and audio circuit of such flip-type radio phone with a mechanical contact device.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
In the present disclosure, the radio phone is defined as indicating both a cellular phone set for communicating with base stations and a portable handset for communicating with an ordinary telephone set fixedly connected with the phone line.<br>
The flip-type radio phone has been developed to reduce the size of the radio phone. The flip-type radio phone includes a flip and a main set. The flip is attached to the main set by means of a hinge mechanism or flip module so as to be closed to or opened from the main set. The communication mode is automatically set by opening the flip. In this case, if the microphone is mounted within the flip, the length of the main set may be considerably reduced, because the length of the flip can compensate for the reduced length of the main set to maintain a proper distance, i.e., more than about 14cm, between the mouth of<br><br>
the user and the ear when using the phone. The flip also serves to reflect the voices and protect the switch buttons. In such flip-type radio phone, if the flip having the microphone is fractured or the junction between the flip and main set for mechanically connecting the microphone and the main set is worn out, the radio phone cannot properly function.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a flip-type radio phone which properly functions even if the junction between the flip and the main set is worn out.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a flip-type radio phone with a microphone attachment for functionally connecting the microphone attached to the flip with the audio circuit of the main set by means of electrical contact surfaces provided in the connecting device for connecting the flip and main set.<br>
According to an illustrative embodiment according to the present invention, a microphone attachment for electrically connecting the microphone and audio circuit of a flip-type radio phone having a flip, main set, and connecting device for connecting the flip and main set, comprises a mechanical contact device arranged in the connecting device for electrically connecting the microphone arranged in the flip with the audio circuit arranged in the main set.<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
In one aspect of the present invention, the mechanical contact device includes a pair of hinge housings each having through holes symmetrically attached to both sides of the connecting device. A hinge shaft is inserted into each of the hinge housings through one end of the through hole so as to project an end portion of the hinge shaft out of the other end of the hinge housing. A projection is formed at the other end of the hinge shaft. A shaft hole is formed along the central axis of the hinge shaft. A conductor cap is attached to the one end of the hinge shaft. A cam hinge has a depressed and a projected part at one end and a spring support part at the other end. The depressed part is engaged with the projection of the hinge shaft. A cam hole is formed along the central axis of the cam hinge concentrically with the shaft hole. A hinge cover is arranged to face the spring support part of the cam hinge for covering each of the hinge housings. A cover hole is formed along the central axis of the hinge cover concentrically with the cam hole.<br>
In addition, a coil spring is compressively disposed between the cam hinge and hinge cover. A wire is inserted into the shaft hole, cam hole and cover hole with one end firmly connected to the conductor cap and the other end connected to the audio circuit. The diameters of the cam hole and cover hole are made greater than the diameter of the wire so as to allow sliding motions of the cam hinge and hinge cover along the wire upon opening or closing from or to the main set. A pair of electrical contact surfaces are formed in the flip for respectively contacting the conductor<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
caps of the hinge shafts when mounting the flip on the main set, thereby establishing an electrical signal path between the microphone and audio circuit by means of mechanical contacts.<br>
The present invention will now be described more specifically with reference to the drawings attached only by way of example. Throughout the drawings, same reference numerals are used to represent same functional elements<br>

according to the illustrative embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, a flip 200 is connected with a main set 100 by means of a connecting device 110. A microphone 10 is mounted within the flip 200 to secure at least 14cm for the distance between the microphone 10 and the speaker 12 0 when opening the flip.<br>
Describing the microphone attachment arranged in the connecting device with reference to Figs. 2, 3, and 4 it includes a mechanical contact device having a pair of flip modules Ml and M2 attached symmetrically to both sides of the connecting device 110, Each of the flip module includes a hinge housing 3 0 having through hole and an elongated guide slot 32. One flip module Ml is arranged with the elongated guide slot 32 facing in the direction normal to the switch button surface of the main set while the other flip module M2 is arranged with the elongated guide slot 32 facing in the direction parallel to the switch button surface. It is readily apparent that this is to make the flip securely kept in the open communication position at an angle of about 135° or the close standby position at the angle of about zero.<br>
The flip module also includes a hinge shaft 40 inserted into the through hole of the hinge housing 30, a cam hinge 50 engaging with the hinge shaft 40, a hinge cover 70 arranged towards the cam hinge to cover one end of the hinge<br>
- 5 -<br><br>
housing, a coil spring 60 compressively disposed between the cam hinge 50 and the hinge cover 70, and a wire 8 0 arranged along the central axis of the hinge shaft.<br>
The hinge housing 30 has a plane surface, the elongated slot 32 and a curved surface to facilitate connection to the flip module. Formed in both sides of the curved surface around the elongated slot 32 are a pair of fastening holes 31. The hinge shaft 4 0 has a projection having a triangular cross section at one end and a shank 42 at the other end. The end of the shank 42 is covered with a conductor cap 43 .<br>
The cam hinge has a depressed and a projected part 51 and 52, respectively at one end and a spring support part 53 at the other end. The depressed part 51 is engaged with the projection 41 of the hinge shaft 40.<br>
A wire 8 0 is provided to serve as a signal path between the microphone and the audio circuit. To this end, a shaft hole 44 is formed along the central axis of the hinge shaft 40. A cam hole 54 is formed along the central axis of the cam hinge 50 concentrically with the shaft hole 44. A cover hole 72 is formed along the central axis of the hinge cover concentrically with the cam hole 54. The wire 80 is inserted into the shaft hole 44, cam hole 54 and cover hole 72 with one end firmly connected to the conductor cap 43 and the other end connected to the audio circuit. The diameters of the cam hole 54 and cover hole 72 are made greater than the diameter of the wire 80 to allow sliding motions of the cam hinge 50 and hinge cover 7 0 along the wire upon opening or closing of the flip from or to the main set.<br>
- 6 -<br><br>
Referring to Fig. 5, the flip 200 is provided with a pair of neck parts 210 respectively formed at both sides of an end for connecting to the main set. The neck part includes a hook 220 to hold the conductor cap 43. A pair of electrical contact surfaces 2 0 are respectively embedded in the hooks. Both poles of the microphone 10 are respectively connected with the pair of electrical contact surfaces 2 0 (shown by dotted lines), preferably by patterning or by embedded wiring within the flip.<br>
Attaching symmetrically the flip modules Ml and M2 to both sides of the connecting device, as shown in Fig. 5, the conductor caps 43 mounted on the ends of the shanks 42 of the hinge shafts 40 are projected respectively out of both ends of the connecting device 110 under the biasing force of the compressed coil springs 60. Then, mounting the flip 200 on the main set 100 by connecting the hooks 22 0 with the ends of the shanks 42, the electrical contact surfaces 2 0 are respectively contacted with the conductor caps 43, which are connected to an audio circuit (not shown) through the wire 80.<br>
When opening the flip cover 200 to make a call, the curved surface between the depressed part 51 and projected part 52 of the cam hinge 50 cooperates slidingly with the projection 41 of the hinge shaft 40, so that the cam hinge reciprocates along the core until reaching the open fixed position. In this position, the projection 41 engages with the depressed part 51 of the cam hinge 50 with the help of the resilient force of the coil spring 60. Similarly, the<br>
_ 7 _<br><br>
closing of the flip 200 is performed in the like manner. Thus, the audio signal generated by the microphone mounted in the flip 200 can be transferred to the audio circuit by means of the mechanical contact device including the conductor caps and electrical contact surfaces. Preferably, the radiophone includes circuitry or software for reducing or eliminating the noises caused by the opening and closing of the flip.<br>
Advantageously, the device of the present invention establishes mechanical connection of the flip and an electrical connection of the microphone of the flip to the main set in a radio phone, facilitating ease of usage and repair of an impaired flip.<br>
While the present invention has bee described by means of specific embodiments with accompanying drawings, it will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention.<br>
