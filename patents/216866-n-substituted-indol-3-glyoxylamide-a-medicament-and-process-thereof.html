Z is 0 or S<br>
The designation alkyl, alkanol, alkoxy or alkylamino<br>
group for the radicals R, Rl R2, R3, R4, R5, R6 and R7 is<br>
normally to be understood as meaning "straight-chain"<br>
and "branched" alkyl groups, where "straight-chain<br>
alkyl groups" can be, for example, radicals such as<br>
methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, n-pentyl and n-hexyl<br>
and "branched alkyl groups" designate, for example,<br>
radicals such as isopropyl or tert-butyl. "Cycloalkyl"<br>
is to be understood as meaning radicals such as, for<br>
example, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl,<br>
cyclohexyl or cycloheptyl.<br>
The designation "halogen" represents fluorine,<br>
chlorine, bromine or iodine. The designation "alkoxy<br>
group" represents radicals such as, for example,<br>
methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy, isopropoxy, isobutoxy<br>
or pentoxy.<br>
The compound according to the invention can also be<br>
present as acid addition salts, for example as salts of<br>
mineral acids, such as, for example, hydrochloric and.<br>
sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, salts of organs acids,<br>
such as, for example, acetic acid, lactic acid, malon.c<br>
acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, gluconic acid,<br>
glucuronic acid, citric acid, embonic add,<br>
methanesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid and succinic<br>
acid.<br>
Both the compounds of the formula I and their salts are<br>
biologically active. The compounds of the formula 1 can<br>
be administered in free form or as salts with a<br>
physiologically tolerable acid.<br>
 Administration can be carried out orally, parenterally,<br>
intravenously, transdermally or by inhalation.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to pharmaceutical<br>
preparations containing at least one compound of the<br>
 formula I or its salt with physiologically tolerable<br>
inorganic or organic acids and, if appropriate,<br>
pharmaceutically utilizable excipients and/or diluents<br>
or auxiliaries.<br>
Suitable administration forms are, for example,<br>
tablets, coated tablets, capsules, solutions or<br>
ampoules, suppositories, patches, powder preparations<br>
which can be inhaled, suspensions, creams and<br>
ointments.<br>
The compounds according to the invention have a good<br>
antiasthmatic, antiallergic and immuno<br>
suppressant/immunomodulating action, for example in<br>
transplantations and diseases such as psoriasis,<br>
rheumatoid disorders and chronic polyarthritis, in the<br>
following pharmacological models:<br>
Inhibition of the "late phase" eosinophilia in the BAL<br>
24 hours after allergen challenge in guinea pigs<br>
Male guinea pigs (200 - 250 g, Dunkin Hartley Shoe)<br>
were actively sensitized . subcutaneously with ovalbumin<br>
(10 mg of ovalbumin + 1 mg of A1(OH)3) and boosted 2<br>
weeks later. One week after boosting with ovalbumin,<br>
the animals were exposed to an inhalation challenge<br>
with ovalbumin (0.5 % strength solution) for 20 - 30<br>
seconds. 24 hours later, the animals were killed by<br>
means of an overdose of urethane, exsanguinated and a<br>
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was carried out using 2 x<br>
5 ml of 0.9 % strength physiological saline solution.<br>
The lavage fluid was collected and centrifuged at 400 g<br>
for 10 minutes, and the pellets were suspended in 1 ml<br>
of 0.9 % strength physiological saline solution. The<br>
eosinophils were counted microscopically in a Neubauer<br>
chamber after staining by means of Becton Dickinson<br>
test kit No. 5877. This test kit contains Phloxin B as<br>
a selective stain for eosinophils. The eosinophils in<br>
the BAL was [sic] counted here for each animal and<br>
expressed as eosinophils (millions/animal). For each<br>
group the mean value and standard deviation were<br>
determined. The percentage inhibition of eosinophilia<br>
for the group treated with test substance was<br>
calculated according to the following formula:<br>
(A - B) - (B - C) / (A - C) x 100 = % inhibition<br>
in this formula A eosinophils correspond to the<br>
untreated challenge group, B eosinophils to the treated<br>
group and C eosinophils to the unchallenged control<br>
group.<br>
The animals were treated with a histamine H, antagonist<br>
(azelastine; 0.01 mg/kg p.o.) 2 hours before allergen<br>
challenge to avoid death. The administration of the<br>
test substances or of the vehicle was carried out 4<br><br>
hours after allergen challenge. The percentage<br>
inhibition of eosinophilia in the BAL was calculated on<br>
groups of 6 - 10 animals.<br>
Assays for the determination of peptidylprolyl<br>
isomerase (PPIase) activity and inhibition<br>
The PPIase activity of the cyclophilins was measured<br>
enzymatically according to Fischer et al. (1984). After<br>
isomerization of the substrate by the peptidyl prolyl<br>
isomerase, this is accessible to chymotrypsin, which<br>
cleaves the chromophore p-nitroaniline. For the<br>
determination of inhibition of the PPIase activity by<br>
substance, recombinant human Cyp B was used. The<br>
interaction of Cyp B with a potential inhibitor was<br>
carried out as follows:<br>
A certain concentration of purified Cyp B was incubated<br>
with 1 mM substance for 15 min. The PPIase reaction was<br>
started by addition of the substrate solution to the<br>
reaction mixture which contains HEPES buffer,<br>
chymotrypsin and either test or control samples. Under<br>
these conditions, first-order kinetics were obtained<br>
with a constant Kobserved = Ko + Kenz, where Ko is the<br>
spontaneous isomerization and Kenz is the rate of<br>
isomerization of the PPIase activity. The extinction<br>
values which correspond to the amount of the<br>
chromophore cleaved were measured using a Beckman DU 70<br>
spectrophotometer at a constant reaction temperature of<br>
10 °C.<br>
The observed residual activity in the presence of<br>
various substances was compared with the cyclophilins<br>
only treated with solvent. The results were given in %<br>
residual activity. Cyclosporin A (CsA) was used as the<br>
reference compound. The inhibition of the PPIase<br>
activity was additionally checked by SDS-PAGE.<br>
Colorimetric assay (based on the MTT test) for the non-<br>
radioactive quantification of cell proliferation and<br>
survival ability<br>
MTT is used for the quantitative determination of cell<br>
proliferation and activation, for example, in the<br>
reaction on growth factors and cytokines such as IL-2<br>
and IL-4 and also for the quantification of the<br>
antiproliferative or toxic effects.<br>
The assay is based on the cleavage of yellow<br>
tetrazolium salt MTT to give purple-red formazan<br>
crystals by metabolically active cells.<br>
The cells, cultured in a 96-hole tissue culture plate,<br>
are incubated for about 4 h with yellow MTT solution.<br>
After this incubation time, purple-red formazan salt<br>
crystals are formed. These salt crystals are insoluble<br>
in aqueous solutions, but can be dissolved by addition<br>
of solubilizer and by incubation of the plates<br>
overnight.<br>
The dissolved formazan product is quantified<br>
spectrophotometrically using an ELISA reader. An<br>
increase in the number of living cells results in an<br>
increase in the total metabolic activity in the sample.<br>
This increase correlates directly with the amount of<br>
the purple-red formazan crystals formed, which are<br>
[sic] measured by the absorption.<br>
The processes for the preparation of the compounds<br>
according to the invention are described in the<br>
following reaction schemes 1 and 2 and in general<br>
procedures. All compounds can be prepared as described<br>
or analogously.<br>
The compounds of the general formula I are obtainable<br>
according to the following Scheme 1, shown for the<br>
synthesis of the compound Example 1:<br>
General procedure for the preparation of the compounds<br>
of the general formula I according to Scheme 1:<br>
1st stage:<br>
The indole derivative, which can be unsubstituted or<br>
mono- or polysubstituted on C-2 or in the phenyl<br>
structure, is dissolved in a protic, dipolar aprotic or<br>
nonpolar organic solvent, such as, for example,<br>
isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl sulfoxide,<br>
dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N-methyl-<br>
pyrrolidone, dioxane, toluene or methylene chloride and<br>
added dropwise to a suspension of a base in a molar or<br>
excess amount prepared in a 3-necked flask under an N2<br>
atmosphere, such as, for example, sodium hydride,<br>
powdered potassium hydroxide, potassium tert-butoxide,<br>
dimethylaminopyridine or sodium amide in a suitable<br>
solvent. The desired alkyl, aralkyl or heteroaralkyl<br>
halide, if appropriate with addition of a catalyst,<br>
such as, for example, copper, is then added and the<br>
mixture is reacted for . some time, for example 3 0<br>
minutes to 12 hours, and the temperature is kept within<br>
a range from 0°C to 120°C, preferably between 30°C to<br>
[sic] 80°C, particularly between 50°C and 65°C. After<br>
completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is<br>
added to water, the solution is extracted, for example,<br>
with diethyl ether, dichloromethane, chloroform, methyl<br>
tert-butyl ether or tetrahydrofuran and the organic<br>
phase obtained in each case is dried using anhydrous<br>
sodium sulfate. The organic phase is concentrated in<br>
vacuo, the residue which remains is crystallized by<br>
trituration or the oily residue is purified by<br>
recrystallization, distillation or by column or flash<br>
chromatography on silica gel or alumina. The eluent<br>
used is, for example, a mixture of dichloromethane and<br>
diethyl ether in the ratio 8:2 (vol/vol) or a mixture<br>
of dichloromethane and ethanol in the ratio 9:1<br>
(vol/vol).<br>
2nd stage<br>
The N-substituted indole obtained by the abovementioned<br>
1st stage procedure is dissolved under a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere in an aprotic or nonpolar organic solvent,<br>
such as, for example, diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl<br>
ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, toluene, xylene,<br>
methylene chloride or chloroform and added to a<br>
solution, prepared under a nitrogen atmosphere, of a<br>
simply molar up to 60 percent excess amount of oxalyl<br>
chloride in an aprotic or nonpolar solvent, such as,<br>
for example, in diethyl ether, methyl tert-butylether,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, toluene, xylene, methylene<br>
chloride or chloroform, the temperature being kept<br>
between -5°C and 20°C. The reaction solution is then<br>
heated at a temperature between 10°C and 130°C,<br>
preferably between 20°C and 80°C, particularly between<br>
3 0°C and 50°C, for a period of 3 0 minutes up to 5 hours<br>
and the solvent is then evaporated. The residue of the<br>
"indolyl-3-glyoxylic acid chloride" formed in this<br>
manner which remains is dissolved in an aprotic solvent<br>
such as, for example, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diethyl<br>
ether, toluene or alternatively in a dipolar aprotic<br>
solvent, such as, for example, dimethylformamide,<br>
dimethylacetamide or dimethyl sulfoxide, cooled to a<br>
temperature between 10°C and -15°C, preferably between<br>
-5°C and 0°C, and treated in the presence of an acid<br>
scavenger with a solution of the primary or secondary<br>
amine in a diluent.<br>
Possible diluents are the solvents used above for the<br>
dissolution of the indolyl-3-glyoxylic acid chloride.<br>
Acid scavengers used are triethylamine, pyridin,<br>
dimethylaminopyridine, basic ion exchanger, sodium<br>
carbonate, potassium carbonate, powdered potassium<br>
hydroxide and excess primary or secondary amine<br>
employed for the reaction. The reaction takes place at<br>
a temperature from 0°C to 120°C, preferably at 20 -<br>
80°C, particularly between 40°C and 60°C. After a<br>
reaction time of 1-3 hours and standing at room<br>
temperature for 24 hours, the hydrochloride of the acid<br>
scavenger is filtered, the filtrate is concentrated in<br>
vacuo, and the residue is recrystallized from an<br>
organic solvent or purified by column chromatography on<br>
silica gel or alumina. The eluent used is, for example,<br>
a mixture of dichloromethane and ethanol (95:5,<br>
vol/vol).<br>

which come from Table 1<br>
All precursors for the final synthesis stages of<br>
Examples 1 to 22 and 24 to 26 are commercially-<br>
available.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of the general formula I are<br>

Scheme 2, shown by the synthesis of the compound<br>
Example 27:<br>
Scheme 2<br>
General procedure for the preparation of the compounds<br>
of the general formula 1 according to Scheme 2<br>
1st stage:<br>
The indole derivative dissolved in a solvent, such as<br>
given above for oxalyl chloride, which can be<br>
unsubstituted or substituted on C-2 or in the phenyl<br>
ring, is added dropwise at a temperature between -5°C<br>
and +5°C to a solution of a simply molar up to 60%<br>
excess amount of oxalyl chloride prepared under a<br>
nitrogen atmosphere in an aprotic or nonpolar solvent,<br>
such as, for example, in diethyl ether, methyl tert-<br>
butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or alternatively<br>
dichloromethane. The reaction solution is then heated<br>
for 1 to 5 hours to a temperature between 10°C and<br>
120°C, preferably between 20°C and 80°C, particularly<br>
between 3 0°C and 60°C, and the solvent is then<br>
evaporated. The residue of the (indol-3-yl)glyoxylic<br>
acid chloride which remains is dissolved or suspended<br>
in an aprotic solvent, such as, for example,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diethyl ether, toluene or<br>
alternatively in a dipolar aprotic solvent, such as,<br>
for example, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide or<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide, cooled to a temperature between<br>
-10°C and +10°C, preferably to -5°C to 0°C, and treated<br>
with a solution of the primary or secondary amine in a<br>
diluent in the presence of an acid scavenger. Possible<br>
diluents are the solvents used for the dissolution of<br>
the "indolyl-3-glyoxylic acid chloride". Acid<br>
scavengers used are triethylamine, pyridin,<br>
dimethylaminopyridine, basic ion exchanger, sodium<br>
carbonate, potassium carbonate, powdered potassium<br>
hydroxide and excess primary or secondary amine<br>
employed for the reaction. The reaction takes place at<br>
a temperature from 0°C to 120°C, preferably at<br>
20 - 80°C, particularly between 40°C and 60°C. After a<br>
reaction time of 1 - 4 hours and standing at room<br>
temperature for 24 hours, the precipitate is digested<br>
with water, and the solid is filtered off with suction<br>
and dried in vacuo. The desired compound is purified by<br>
recrystallization in an organic solvent or by column<br>
chromatography on silica gel or alumina. The solvent<br>
used is, for example, a mixture of dichloromethane and<br>
ethanol (10:1, vol/vol).<br>
2nd stage<br>
The "indol-3-ylglyoxylamide" obtained according to the<br>
abovementioned 1st Stage procedure is dissolved in a<br>
protic, dipolar aprotic or nonpolar organic solvent,<br>
such as, for example, in isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran,<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide, dimethyl-<br>
acetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, dioxane, toluene or<br>
methylene chloride and added dropwise to a suspension<br>
of a base such as, for example, sodium hydride,<br>
powdered potassium hydroxide, potassium tert-butoxide,<br>
dimethylaminopyridine or sodium amide in a suitable<br>
solvent, in a molar amount or in excess prepared in a<br>
3-necked flask under an N2 atmosphere. The desired<br>
alkyl, aralkyl or heteroaralkyl halide is then added<br>
either in undiluted form or in a diluent which was also<br>
used, for example, to dissolve the "indol-3-yl<br>
glyoxylamide", if appropriate with addition of a<br>
catalyst, such as, for example, copper, and the mixture<br>
is allowed to react for some time, e.g. 3 0 minutes to<br>
12 hours, and the temperature is kept within a range<br>
between 0°C and 120°C, preferably between 3 0°C and<br>
80°C, particularly between 50 and 70°C. After<br>
completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is<br>
added to water, the solution is extracted, for example,<br>
with diethyl ether, dichloromethane, chloroform, methyl<br>
tert-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or N-butanol and the<br>
organic phase obtained in each case is dried using<br>
anhydrous sodium sulfate.<br>
The organic phase is concentrated in vacuo, the residue<br>
which remains is crystallized by trituration or the<br>
oily residue is purified by distillation or by column<br>
chromatography or flash chromatography on silica gel or<br>
alumina. The eluent used is, for example, a mixture of<br>
methylene chloride and diethyl ether in the ratio 8:2<br>
(vol/vol) or a mixture of methylene chloride and<br>
ethanol in the ratio 9:1 (v/v).<br>
