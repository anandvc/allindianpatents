Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel amorphous hydrate of a cephalosporin antibiotic. More particularly, the present invention relates to novel amorphous monohydrate of cefdinir of the formula (I).<br><br>
The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of the novel amorphous monohydrate of cefdinir of formula (I).<br>
The present invention also provides new salts of compound of formula (XIV) and a process for the preparation of cefdinir using the new salts.<br>
Background of tlie Invention<br>
Cefdinir is a third generation cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration and has a broader antibacterial spectrum over the general gram positive and gram negative bacteria, especially against StreptococcU than oth^r antibiotics for oral administration.<br>
In view of the vital antibiotic activities of cefdinir of the formula (I), various<br>
methods of preparation were reported. Cefdinir is for the first claimed in US patent<br>
No. 4,559,334 and the nature of the product that is disclosed in this patent is<br>
described as crystalline like amorphous in subsequent US patent (US 4,935,507).<br>
This patent also discloses a process for the preparation of cefcjinir as depicted in the<br>
i Scheme I.<br><br><br>
In the disclosed process, 7-amino-3-vinyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid ester where R represents a conventional carboxy protecting group, is acylated with the reactive ester of haloacylacetic acid, which was converted to its oxirae, followed by cyclization with thiourea and deprotection of the ester group to afford cefdinir. The product obtained by the process described in examples 14 and 16 is approximately 80-85 % pure. The cyclization step suffers from poor yield and affords brownish color of the thiazole derivative, which subsequently affords cefdinir, but quality and yield were inferior. Further, owing to the fact that the expensive 7-amino-3"Vinyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid is carried through four steps, cost of producing cefdinir is high.<br>
US patent number 4,935,507 claims the novel crystalline form of the cefdinir syn-isomer and a process for prepjiring the same. The X-ray crystallography data given in this is as given in the following table:<br><br><br><br>
The crystalline form (Crystal A) of US 4,935,507 is prepared from the syn-isomer prepared according to the procedures described in Examples 14 and 16 of US 4,559,334.<br>
In our US patent No. 6,388,070, we disclosed a process for preparing a compound of formula (VIII), wherein, Ri represents H, trityl, etc., R2 represents H, phenyl, etc., R3 represents CH3, CH=CH, etc., R4 is H or a salt or a carboxylic protecting group; R5 is H or trimethylsilyl; comprising acylating the compound of formula (VI) with compound of formula (VII) in the presence of an organic solvent, organic base and a silylating agent at a temperature in the range of -10 "^C to +30 Â°C. The reaction is shown in scheme II below :<br><br>
US patent No. 6,093,814 discloses a process for the preparation of cefdinir and its intermediate as represented in the Scheme III:<br><br><br>
In this process p-methoxybenzyl 7-amino-3-vinyl"3-cephem-4-carboxylate is<br>
condensed with 2-mercaptobenzothiazolyl (Z)-(2-aminO"4-thiazolyl)"2-<br>
(trityloxyimino)acetate in N,N-dimethyl acetamide, and the product obtained was<br>
treated with p-toluenesulfonic acid in the presence of a mixture of diethyl ether and<br>
methanol	to	get	crystalline	7-[(2-amino-4-thiazoIyl)-"2-(Z)-<br>
(trityloxyimino)acetamido]-3-vinyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic	acid.pTSA.2DMAc<br>
solvate. This process utilizes highly volatile, low-boiling and therefore industrially-not-preferred solvent, diethyl ether, for crystallizing out the above solvate. In addition, the quantity of the low-boiling solvent used is also very high ranging from 60-100 volumes, thereby adding "hazard to the operations. Added to this is the fact that the recovery of these solvents from their mixture is not Istraight-forward.<br>
US patent No. 6,350,869 discloses the purihcapon of impure cefdinir through the preparation of N,N-dicyclohexylamine salt of 7-[2-amino-4-thiazolyl-2-(z)-hydroxyimino acetamido]-3-vinyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid and subsequent<br>
hydrolysis to get pure cefdinir.   This process requires jhe preparation of crude<br>
i<br><br>
. ifdinir, conversion to N,N-dicyclohexylamine salt and then hydrolysis of the salt to get pure cefdinir, and therefore the overall yield is not attractive.<br>
US patent No. 6,350,869 also emphasizes that cefdinir is unstable in the presence of other amines, with which, it gets heavily degraded. In addition, Yoshihiko Okamoto et al. (J. Pharm. Sci. Vol. 8S(9), 976, 1996) report that cefdinir may be unstable under basic environment.<br>
Crystalline cefdinir has limitations in formulation development as it cannot be developed into tablets.<br>
Considering the foregoing limitations, we undertook an investigation in our lab to develop a product which is easy to handle and convenient to develop a dosage which is easily absorbable. We also parellely undertook an investigation to identify a process, which involves (i) less number of steps, (ii) the direct isolation of cefdinir, with out the need to prepare crude cefdinir in an additional step. This would permit commercializing the production of high-pure cefdinir with industrial-friendly solvent, which can further be recovered for recycling.<br>
Objectives of the Invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a novel amorphous monohydrate of cefdinir which has very good bioavailability and useful in developing different dosage forms.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to pr9vide a commercially<br>
viable process for the preparation novel amorphous monohydjrate of cefdinir of the<br>
i formula (I), which would be easy to implement on manufacturing scale.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide new salts of<br>
formula (XIV), which are insoluble and stable throughout thej process of producing<br>
I<br>
the cefdinir and a process for the preparation of cefdinir using these new salts.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a novel amorphous monohydrate of cefdinir of the formula (I)<br><br>
The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of novel amorphous monohydrate of cefdinir of the formula (I), which comprises the steps of:<br>
i) condensing 7-amino-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid of the formula (XII) with compound of the formula (XIII) wherein X represents an activating group in the presence of a tertiary amine and an organic solvent, followed by treatment with a base to produce a salt of compound formula (XIV), wherein M^ is a counter ion, ii) deprotecting the compound of formula (XIV) to produce compound of formula (XV) wherein M^ is a counter ion in the presence of an organic solvent and<br>
a base at a temperature in the range of room temperature to 80 Â°C and iii)      hydrolyzing the compound of the formula (XV) using an acid at low temperatures in the range of -^0 to 0 ^C in the presence of an organic solvent to produce novel amorphous monohydrate of cefdinir of the formula (I).<br>
The reaction is shown in scheme-IV below :<br><br><br>
