FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to coding of multi-channel representations of audio<br>
signals using spatial parameters. The present invention teaches new methods for<br>
estimating and defining proper parameters for recreating a multi-channel signal<br>
from a number of channels being less than the number of output channels. In<br>
particular it aims at minimizing the bit rate for the multi-channel representation,<br>
and providing a coded representation of the multi-channel signal enabling easy<br>
encoding and decoding of the data for all possible channel configurations.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has been shown in US 7382886B2 "Efficient and scalable Parametric Stereo<br>
Coding for Low Bit rate Audio Coding Applications", that it is possible to re-create<br>
a stereo image that closely resembles to original stereo image, from a mono<br>
signal given a very compact representation of the stereo image. The basic<br>
principle is to divide the input signal into frequency bands and time segments,<br>
and for these frequency bands and time segments, estimate inter-channel<br>
intensity difference (IID), and inter-channel coherence (ICC). The first parameter<br>
is a measurement of the power distribution between the two channels in the<br>
specific frequency band and the second parameter is an estimation of the<br>
correlation between the two channels for the specific frequency band. On the<br>
decoder side the stereo image is recreated from the mono signal by distributing<br>
the mono signal between the two output channels in accordance with the IID-<br>
data, and by adding a decorrelated signal in order to retain the channel<br>
correlation of the original stereo channels.<br><br>
Document HERRE JET AL: "INTENSITY STEREO CODING" PREPRINTS OF<br>
PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE AES CONVENTION, vol.96, no.3799, 26 February<br>
1994, pages 1-10 XP009025131 discloses an apparatus for coding a multi-<br>
channel audio signal in which left and center channel are combined and rear left<br>
and rear right channel are combined in order to form a parameter representation<br>
of the original channels.<br>
For a multi-channel case (multi-channel in this context meaning more than two<br>
output channels), several additional issues have to be accounted for. Several<br>
multi-channel configurations exist. The most commonly known is the 5.1<br>
configuration (center channel, front left/right, surround left/right, and the LFE<br>
channel). However, many other configurations exist. From the complete<br>
encoder/decoder systems point-of-view, it is desirable to have a system that can<br>
use the same parameter set (e.g. IID and ICC) or sub-sets thereof for all channel<br>
configurations. ITU-R BS.775 defines several down-mix schemes to be able to<br>
obtain a channel configuration comprising fewer channels from a given channel<br>
configuration. Instead of always having to decode all channels and rely on a<br>
down-mix, it can be desirable to have a multi-channel representation that<br>
enables a receiver to extract the parameters relevant for the channel<br>
configuration at hand, prior to decoding the channels. Further, a parameter set<br>
that is inherently scaleable is desirable from a scalable or embedded coding point<br><br>
of view, where it is e.g. possible to store the data corresponding to the surround<br>
channels in an enhancement layer in the bitstream.<br>
Contrary to the above it can also be desirable to be able to use different<br>
parameter definitions based on the characteristics of the signal being processed,<br>
in order to switch between the parameterization that results in the lowest bit rate<br>
overhead for the current signal segment being processed.<br>
Another representation of multi-channel signals using a sum signal or down mix signal and additional parametric side information is known in the art as binaural<br>
cue coding (BCC). This technique is described in "Binaural Cue Coding - Part 1:<br>
Psycho-Acoustic Fundamentals and Design Principles", IEEE Transactions on<br>
Speech and Audio Processing, vol.11, No.6, November 2003, F. Baumgarte<br><br>
"Binaural Cue Coding. Part II: Schemes and Applications",<br>
IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing vol. 11,<br>
No. 6, November 2003, C. Faller and F. Baumgarte.<br>
Generally, binaural cue coding is a method for multi-<br>
channel spatial rendering based on one down-mixed audio<br>
channel and side information. Several parameters to be cal-<br>
culated by a BCC encoder and to be used by a BCC decoder<br>
for audio reconstruction or audio rendering include inter-<br>
channel level differences, inter-channel time differences,<br>
and inter-channel coherence parameters. These inter-channel<br>
cues are the determining factor for the perception of a<br>
spatial image. These parameters are given for blocks of<br>
time samples of the original multi-channel signal and are<br>
also given frequency-selective so that each block of multi-<br>
channel signal samples have several cues for several fre-<br>
quency bands. In the general case of C playback channels,<br>
the inter-channel level differences and the inter-channel<br>
time differences are considered in each subband between<br>
pairs of channels, i.e., for each channel relative to a<br>
reference channel. One channel is defined as the reference<br>
channel for each inter-channel level difference. With the<br>
inter-channel level differences and the inter-channel time<br>
differences, it is possible to render a source to any di-<br>
rection between one of the loudspeaker pairs of a playback<br>
set-up that is used. For determining the width or diffuse-<br>
ness of a rendered source, it is enough to consider one pa-<br>
rameter per subband for all audio channels. This parameter<br>
is the inter-channel coherence parameter. The width of the<br>
rendered source is controlled by modifying the subband sig-<br>
nals such that all possible channel pairs have the same in-<br>
ter-channel coherence parameter.<br>
In BCC coding, all inter-channel level differences are de-<br>
termined between the reference channel 1 and any other<br>
channel. When, for example, the center channel is deter-<br>
mined to be the reference channel, a first inter-channel<br>
level difference between the left channel and the centre<br><br>
channel, a second inter-channel level difference between<br>
the right channel and the centre channel, a third inter-<br>
channel level difference between the left surround channel<br>
and the center channel, and a forth inter-channel level<br>
difference between the right surround channel and the cen-<br>
ter channel are calculated. This scenario describes a five-<br>
channel scheme. When the five-channel scheme additionally<br>
includes a low frequency enhancement channel, which is also<br>
known as a "sub-woofer" channel, a fifth inter-channels<br>
level difference between the low frequency enhancement<br>
channel and the center channel, which is the single refer-<br>
ence channel, is calculated.<br>
When reconstructing the original multi-channel using the<br>
single down mix channel, which is also termed as the "mono"<br>
channel, and the transmitted cues such as ICLD (Interchan-<br>
nel Level Difference), ICTD (Interchannel Time Difference),<br>
and ICC (Interchannel Coherence), the spectral coefficients<br>
of the mono signal are modified using these cues. The level<br>
modification is performed using a positive real number de-<br>
termining the level modification for each spectral coeffi-<br>
cient. The inter-channel time difference is generated using<br>
a complex number of magnitude of one determining a phase<br>
modification for each spectral coefficient. Another func-<br>
tion determines the coherence influence. The factors for<br>
level modifications of each channel are computed by firstly<br>
calculating the factor for the reference channel. The fac-<br>
tor for the reference channel is computed such that for<br>
each frequency partition, the sum of the power of all chan-<br>
nels is the same as the power of the sum signal. Then,<br>
based on the level modification factor for the reference<br>
channel, the level modification factors for the other chan-<br>
nels are calculated using the respective ICLD parameters.<br>
Thus, in order to perform BCC synthesis, the level modifi-<br>
cation factor for the reference channel is to be calcu-<br>
lated. For this calculation, all ICLD parameters for a fre-<br>
quency band are necessary. Then, based on this level modi-<br><br>
fication for the single channel, the level modification<br>
factors for the other channels, i.e., the channels, which<br>
are not the reference channel, can be calculated.<br>
This approach is disadvantageous in that, for a perfect re-<br>
construction, one needs each and every inter-channel level<br>
difference. This requirement is even more problematic, when<br>
an error-prone transmission channel is present. Each error<br>
within a transmitted inter-channel level difference will<br>
result in an error in the reconstructed multi-channel sig-<br>
nal, since each inter-channel level difference is required<br>
to calculate each one of the multi-channel output signal.<br>
Additionally, no reconstruction is possible, when an inter-<br>
channel level difference has been lost during transmission,<br>
although this inter-channel level difference was only nec-<br>
essary for e.g. the left surround channel or the right sur-<br>
round channel, which channels are not so important to<br>
multi-channel reconstruction, since most of the information<br>
is included in the front left channel, which is subse-<br>
quently called the left channel, the front right channel,<br>
which is subsequently called the right channel, or the cen-<br>
ter channel. This situation becomes even worse, when the<br>
inter-channel level difference of the low frequency en-<br>
hancement channel has been lost during transmission. In<br>
this situation, no or only an erroneous multi-channel re-<br>
construction is possible, although the low frequency en-<br>
hancement channel is not so decisive for the listeners'<br>
listening comfort. Thus, errors in a single inter-channel<br>
level difference are propagated to errors within each of<br>
the reconstructed output channels.<br>
Additionally, the existing BCC scheme, which is also de-<br>
scribed in AES convention paper 5574, "Binaural Cue Coding<br>
applied to Stereo and Multi-channel Audio Compression",<br>
C. Faller, F. Baumgarte, May 10 to 13, 2002, Munich, Ger-<br>
many, is not so well-suited, when an intuitive listening<br>
scenario is considered because of the single reference<br>
channel. It is not natural for a human being, which is, of<br><br>
course, the ultimate<br>
goal of the whole audio processing, that everything is related to a single<br>
reference channel. Instead, a human being has two ears, which are positioned at<br>
different sides of the human being's head. Thus, a human being's natural<br>
listening impression is, whether a signal is balanced more to the left or more to<br>
the right, or is balanced between the front and back. Contrary thereto, it is<br>
unnatural for a human being to feel whether a certain sound source in the<br>
auditory field is in a certain balance between each speaker with respect to a<br>
single reference speaker. This disvergence between the natural listening<br>
impression on the one hand and the mathematical/physical model of BCC on the<br>
other hand may lead to negative consequences of the encoding scheme, when<br>
bit rate requirements, scalability requirements, flexibility requirements,<br>
reconstruction artefact requirements, or error-robustness requirements are<br>
considered.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved concept for<br>
presenting multi-channel audio signals.<br>
This object is achieved by apparatuses and methods for generating parameter representation and a reconstructed multi-channel representation of a multi-<br>
channel input signal.<br><br>
The present invention is based on the finding that, for a multi-channel<br>
representation, one has to rely on balance parameters between channel pairs.<br>
Additionally, it has been found out that a multi-channel signal parameter<br>
representation is possible by providing at least two different balance parameters,<br>
which indicate a balance between two different channel pairs. In particular,<br>
flexibility, scalability, error-robustness, and even bit rate efficiency are the result<br>
of the fact that the first channel pair, which is the basis for the first balance<br>
parameter is different from the second channel pair, which is the basis for the<br>
second balance parameters, wherein the four channels forming these channel<br>
pairs are all different from each other.<br>
Thus, the inventive concept departs from the single reference channel concept<br>
and uses a multi-balance or super-balance concept, which is more intuitive and<br>
more natural for a human being's sound impression. In particular, the channel<br>
pairs underlying the first and second balance parameters can include original<br>
channels, down-mix channels, or preferably, certain combinations between input<br>
channels.<br>
It has been found out that a balance parameter derived from the center channel<br>
as the first channel and a sum of the left original channel and the right original<br>
channel as the second channel of the channel pair is especially useful for<br>
providing an exact energy distribution between the center channel and the left<br>
and right channels. It is to be noted in this context that these three channels<br>
normally include most information of the audio scene, wherein particularly the<br>
left-right stereo localization is not only influenced by the balance between left<br>
-and right but also by the balance between center and the sum of left and right.<br>
This 	<br><br>
flexible, error-robust, and to a large extent artefact-<br>
free.<br>
On the receiver-side, in contrast to BCC synthesis in which<br>
each channel is calculated by the transmitted information<br>
alone, the inventive multi-balance representation addition-<br>
ally makes use of information on the down-mixing scheme<br>
used for generating the down-mix channel(s). Thus, in ac-<br>
cordance with the present invention, information on the<br>
down-mixing scheme, which is not used in prior art systems,<br>
is also used for up-mixing in addition to the balance pa-<br>
rameter. The up-mixing operation is, therefore, performed<br>
such that the balance between the channels within a recon-<br>
structed multi-channel signal forming a channel pair for a<br>
balance parameter is determined by the balance parameter.<br>
This concept, i.e., having different channel pairs for dif-<br>
ferent balance parameters, makes it possible to generate<br>
some channels without knowledge of each and every transmit-<br>
ted balance parameter. In particular, in accordance with<br>
the present invention, the left, right and center channels<br>
can be reconstructed without any knowledge on any rear-<br>
left/rear-right balance or without any knowledge on a<br>
front/back balance. This effect allows the very fine-tuned<br>
scalability, since extracting an additional parameter from<br>
a bit stream or transmitting an additional balance parame-<br>
ter to a receiver consequently allows the reconstruction of<br>
one or more additional channels. This is in contrast to the<br>
prior art single-reference system, in which one needed each<br>
and every inter-channel level difference for reconstructing<br>
all or only a subgroup of all reconstructed output chan-<br>
nels.<br>
The inventive concept is also flexible in that the choice<br>
of the balance parameters can be adapted to a certain re-<br>
construction environment. When, for example, a five-channel<br>
set-up forms the original multi-channel signal set-up, and<br>
when a four-channel set-up forms a reconstruction multi-<br><br>
channel set-up, which has only a single surround speaker,<br>
which is e.g. positioned behind the listener, a front-back<br>
balance parameter allows calculating the combined surround<br>
channel without any knowledge on the left surround channel,<br>
and the right surround channel. This is in contrast to a<br>
single-reference channel system, in which one has to ex-<br>
tract an inter-channel level difference for the left sur-<br>
round channel and an inter-channel level difference for the<br>
right surround channel from the data stream. Then, one has<br>
to calculate the left surround channel and the right sur-<br>
round channel. Finally, one has to add both channels to ob-<br>
tain the single surround speaker channel for a four-channel<br>
reproduction set-up. All these steps do not have to be per-<br>
formed in the more-intuitive and more user-directed balance<br>
parameter representation, since this representation auto-<br>
matically delivers the combined surround channel because of<br>
the balance parameter representation, which is not tied to<br>
a single reference channel, but which also allows to use a<br>
combination of original channels as a channel of a balance<br>
parameter channel pair.<br>
The present invention relates to the problem of a param-<br>
eterized multi-channel representation of audio signals. It<br>
provides an efficient manner to define the proper parame-<br>
ters for the multi-channel representation and also the<br>
ability to extract the parameters representing the desired<br>
channel configuration without having to decode all chan-<br>
nels. The invention further solves the problem of choosing<br>
the optimal parameter configuration for a given signal seg-<br>
ment in order to minimize the bit rate required to code the<br>
spatial parameters for the given signal segment. The pre-<br>
sent invention also outlines how to apply the decorrelation<br>
methods previously only applicable for the two channel case<br>
in a general multi-channel environment.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the present invention comprises<br>
the following features:<br><br>
Down-mix the multi-channel signal to a one or two chan-<br>
nel representation on the encoders side;<br>
Given the multi-channel signal, define the parameters<br>

rate or in order to enable the decoder to extract the<br>
channel configuration on a bitstream level;<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br><br>
The below-described embodiments are merely illustrative<br>
for the principles of the present invention on multi-<br>
channel representation of audio signals. It is understood<br>
that modifications and variations of the arrangements and<br>
the details described herein will be apparent to others<br>
skilled in the art. It is the intent, therefore, to be<br>
limited only by the scope of the impending patent claims<br>
and not by the specific details presented by way of de-<br>
scription and explanation of the embodiments herein.<br>
In the following description of the present invention out-<br>
lining how to parameterize IID and ICC parameters, and how<br>
to apply them in order to re-create a multi-channel repre-<br>
sentation of audio signals, it is assumed that all referred<br>
signals are subband signals in a filterbank, or some other<br>
frequency selective representation of a part of the whole<br>
frequency range for the corresponding channel. It is there-<br>
fore understood, that the present invention is not limited<br>
to a specific filterbank, and that the present invention is<br>
outlined below for one frequency band of the subband repre-<br>
sentation of the signal, and that the same operations apply<br>
to all of the subband signals.<br>
Although a balance parameter is also termed to be a "inter-<br>
channel intensity difference (IID)" parameter, it is to be<br>
emphasized that a balance parameter between a channel pair<br>
does not necessarily has to be the ratio between the energy<br>
or intensity in the first channel of the channel pair and<br>
the energy or intensity of the second channel in the chan-<br>
nel pair. Generally, the balance parameter indicates the<br>
localization of a sound source between the two channels of<br>
the channel pair. Although this localization is usually<br>
given by energy/level/intensity differences, other charac-<br>
teristics of a signal can be used such as a power measure<br>
for both channels or time or frequency envelopes of the<br>
channels, etc.<br><br>
In Fig. 1 the different channels for a 5.1 channel configu-<br>
ration are visualized, where a(t) 101 represents the left<br>
surround channel, b(t) 102 represents the left front chan-<br>
nel, c(t) 103 represents the center channel, d(t) 104<br>
represents the right front channel, e(t) 105 represents the<br>
right surround channel, and f(t) 106 represents the LFE<br>
(low frequency effects) channel.<br>
Assuming that we define the expectancy operator as<br><br>
and thus the energies for the channels outlined above can<br>
be defined according to (here exemplified by the left sur-<br>
round channel):<br><br>
The five channels are on the encoder side down-mixed to a<br>
two channel representation or a one channel representation.<br>
This can be done in several ways, and one commonly used is<br>
the ITU down-mix defined according to:<br>
The 5.1 to two channel down-mix:<br><br>
And the 5.1 to one channel down-mix:<br><br>
Commonly used values for the constants α,β,γ and δ are<br><br>
The IID parameters are defined as energy ratios of two ar-<br>
bitrarily chosen channels or weighted groups of channels.<br>
Given the energies of the channels outlined above for the<br>
5.1 channel configuration several sets of IID parameters<br>
can be defined.<br><br>
Fig. 7 indicates a general down-mixer 700 using the above-<br>
referenced equations for calculating a single-based chan-<br>
nel m or two preferably stereo-based channels ld and rd.<br>
Generally, the down-mixer uses certain down-mixing informa-<br>
tion. In the preferred embodiment of a linear down-mix,<br>
this down-mixing information includes weighting factors α,<br>
β,γ, and δ. It is known in the art that more or less con-<br>
stant or non-constant weighting factors can be used.<br>
In an ITU recommended down-mix, a is set to 1, β and γ are<br>
set to be equal, and equal to the square root of 0.5, and δ <br>
is set to 0. Generally, the factor α can vary between 1.5<br>
and 0.5. Additionally, the factors β, and γ can be differ-<br>
ent from each other, and vary between 0 and 1. The same is<br>
true for the low frequency enhancement channel f(t). The<br>
factor δ for this channel can vary between 0 and 1. Addi-<br>
tionally, the factors for the left-down mix and the right-<br>
down mix do not have to be equal to each other. This be-<br>
comes clear, when a non-automatic down-mix is considered,<br>
which is, for example, performed by a sound engineer. The<br>
sound engineer is more directed to perform a creative down-<br>
mix rather than a down-mix, which is guided by any math-<br>
ematic laws. Instead, the sound engineer is guided by his<br>
own creative feeling. When this "creative" down-mixing is<br>
recorded by a certain parameter set, it will be used in ac-<br>
cordance with the present invention by an inventive up-<br>
mixer as shown in Fig. 8, which is not only guided by the<br>
parameters, but also by additional information on the down-<br>
mixing scheme.<br>
When a linear down-mix has been performed as in Fig. 7, the<br>
weighting parameters are the preferred information on the<br>
down-mixing scheme to be used by the up-mixer. When, how-<br>
ever, other information is present, which are used in the<br>
down-mixing scheme, this other information can also be used<br>
by an up-mixer as the information on the down-mixing<br>
scheme. Such other information can, for example, be certain<br>
matrix elements or certain factors or functions within ma-<br><br>
trix elements of an upmix-matrix as, for example, indicated<br>
in Fig. 11.<br>
Given the 5.1 channel configuration outlined in Figure 1<br>
and observing how other channel configurations relate to<br>
the 5.1 channel configuration: For a three channel case<br>
where no surround channels are available, i.e. B, C, and D<br>
are available according to the notation above. For a four<br>
channel configuration B, C and D are available but also a<br>
combination of A and E representing the single surround<br>
channel, or more commonly denoted in this context, the back<br>
channel.<br>
The present invention defines IID parameters that apply to<br>
all these channels, i.e. the four channel subset of the<br>
5.1. channel configuration has a corresponding subset<br>
within the IID parameter set describing the 5.1 channels.<br>
The following IID parameter set solves this problem:<br><br>
It is evident that the r1 parameter corresponds to the en-<br>
ergy ratio between the left down-mix channel and the right<br>
channel down-mix. The r2 parameter corresponds to the en-<br>
ergy ratio between the center channel and the left and<br>
right front channels. The r3 parameter corresponds to the<br>
energy ratio between the three front channels and the two<br>
surround channels. The r4 parameter corresponds to the en-<br><br>
ergy ratio between the two surround channels. The r5 pa-<br>
rameter corresponds to the energy ratio between the LFE<br>
channel and all other channels.<br>
In Fig. 4 the energy ratios as explained above are illus-<br>
trated. The different output channels are indicated by 101<br>
to 105 and are the same as in Fig.l and are hence not<br>
elaborated on further here. The speaker set-up is divided<br>
into a left and a right half, where the center channel 103<br>
are part of both halves. The energy ratio between the left<br>
half plane and the right half plane is exactly the parame-<br>
ter referred to as r1 according to the present invention.<br>
This is indicated by the solid line below r1 in Fig. 4.<br>
Furthermore, the energy distribution between the center<br>
channel 103 and the left front 102 and right front 103<br>
channels are indicated by r2 according to the present in-<br>
vention. Finally, the energy distribution between the en-<br>
tire front channel set-up (102, 103 and 104) and the back<br>
channels (101 and 105) are illustrated by the arrow in Fig.<br>
5 by the r3 parameter.<br>
Given the parameterization above and the energy of the<br>
transmitted single down-mixed channel:<br>
M = -(a2 (B + D) + J32 (A + E) + 2y2C + 2S2F) ,<br>
the energies of the reconstructed channels can be expressed<br>
as:<br><br><br><br>
Hence the energy of the M signal can be distributed to the<br>
re-constructed channels resulting in re- constructed chan-<br>
nels having the same energies as the original channels.<br>
The above-preferred up-mixing scheme is illustrated in<br>
Fig. 8. It becomes clear from the equations for F, A, E, C,<br>
B, and D that the information on the down-mixing scheme to<br>
be used by the up-mixer are the weighting factors α,β,γ,<br>
and δ, which are used for weighting the original channels<br>
before such weighted or unweighted channels are added to-<br>
gether or subtracted from each other in order to arrive at<br>
a number of down-mix channels, which is smaller than the<br>
number of original channels. Thus, it is clear from Fig. 8<br>
that in accordance with the present invention, the energies<br>
of the reconstructed channels are not only determined by<br>
the balance parameters transmitted from an encoder-side to<br>
a decoder-side, but are also determined by the down-mixing<br>
factor α,β,γ, and δ.<br>
When Fig. 8 is considered, it becomes clear that, for cal-<br>
culating the left and right energies B and D the already<br>
calculated channel energies F, A, E, C, are used within the<br>
equation. This, however, does not necessarily imply a se-<br>
quential up-mixing scheme. Instead, for obtaining a fully<br>
parallel up-mixing scheme, which is, for example, performed<br>
using a certain up-mixing matrix having certain up-mixing<br>
matrix elements, the equations for A, C, E, and F are in-<br>
serted into the equations for B and D. Thus, it becomes<br>
clear that reconstructed channel energy is only determined<br>
by balance parameters, the down-mix channel(s), and the in-<br>
formation on the down-mixing scheme such as the down-mixing<br>
factors.<br><br>
When Fig. 8 is considered, it becomes clear that, for<br>
calculating the left and right energies B and D the already<br>
calculated channel energies F, A, E, C, are used within the<br>
equation. This, however, does not necessarily imply a<br>
sequential up-mixing scheme. Instead, for obtaining a fully<br>
parallel up-mixing scheme, which is, for example, performed<br>
using a certain up-mixing matrix having certain up-mixing<br>
matrix elements, the equations for A, C, E, and F are<br>
inserted into the equations for B and D. Thus, it becomes<br>
clear that reconstructed channel energy is only determined<br>
by Dalance parameters, the down-mix channel (s), and the<br>
information on the down-mixing scheme such as the down-<br>
mixing factors.<br>
Given the above IID parameters it is evident that the<br>
problem of defi.ning a parameter set of IID parameters that<br>
can be used for several channel configurations has been<br>
solved as will be obvious from the below. As an example,<br>
observing the three channel configuration (i.e. recreating<br>
three front channels from one available channel), it is<br>
evident that the r3, r4 and r5 parameters are obsolete since<br>
the A, E and F channels do not exist. It is also evident<br>
that the parameters r1 and r2 are sufficient to recreate<br>
the three channels from a downmixed single channel since r1<br>
describes the energy ratio between the left and right front<br>
channels, and r2 describes the energy ratio between the<br>
center channel and the left and right front channels.<br>
In the more general case it is easily seen that the IID<br>
parameters (r1 . . . r5) as defined above apply to all subsets<br>
of recreating n channels from m channels where m<n></n>
Observing Fig. 4 it can be said:<br>
- For a system recreating 2 channels from 1 channel,<br>
sufficient information to retain the correct energy<br>
ratio between the channels is obtained from the r1<br>
parameter;<br><br>
-	For a system recreating 5.1 channels	from 1 channel,<br>
sufficient information to retain the	correct energy ra-<br>
tio between the channels is obtained	from the r1, r2, r3,<br>
r4 and r5 parameters;<br>
-	For a system recreating 5.1 channels from 2 channels,<br>
sufficient information to retain the correct energy ra-<br>
tio between the channels is obtained from the r2, r3, r4<br>
and r5 parameters.<br>
The above described scalability feature is illustrated by<br>
the table in Fig. 10b. The scalable bit stream illustrated<br>
in Fig. 10a and explained later on can also be adapted to<br>
the table in Fig. 10b for obtaining a much finer scalabil-<br>
ity than shown in Fig. 10a.<br>
The inventive concept is especially advantageous in that<br>
the left and right channels can be easily reconstructed<br>
from a single balance parameter r1 without knowledge or ex-<br>
traction of any other balance parameter. To this end, in<br>
the equations for B, D in Fig. 8, the channels A, C, F, and<br>
E are simply set to zero.<br>
Alternatively, when only the balance parameter r2 is con-<br>
sidered, the reconstructed channels are the sum between the<br>
center channel and the low frequency channel (when this<br>
channel is not set to zero) on the one hand and the sum be-<br>
tween the left and right channels on the other hand. Thus,<br>
the center channel on the one hand and the mono signal on<br>
the other hand can be reconstructed using only a single pa-<br>
rameter. This feature can already be useful for a simple 3-<br>
channel representation, where the left and right signals<br>
are derived from the sum of left and right such as by halv-<br>
ing, and where the energy between the center and the sum of<br>
left and right is exactly determined by the balance parame-<br>
ter r2.<br><br>
-	For a system recreating 5.1 channels from 1 channel,<br>
sufficient information to retain the correct energy ra-<br>
tio between the channels is obtained from the rl r2, r3,<br>
r4 and r5 parameters;<br>
-	For a system recreating 5.1 channels from 2 channels,<br>
sufficient information to retain the correct energy ra-<br>
tio between the channels is obtained from the r2, r3, r4<br>
and r5 parameters.<br>
The above described scalability feature is illustrated by<br>
the table in Fig. 10b. The scalable bit stream illustrated<br>
in Fig. 10a and explained later on can also be adapted to<br>
the table in Fig. 10b for obtaining a much finer scalabil-<br>
ity than shown in Fig. 10a.<br>
The inventive concept is especially advantageous in that<br>
the left and right channels can be easily reconstructed<br>
from a single balance parameter r1 without knowledge or ex-<br>
traction of any other balance parameter. To this end, in<br>
the equations for B, D in Fig. 8, the channels A, C, F, and<br>
E are simply set to zero.<br>
Alternatively, when only the balance parameter r2 is con-<br>
sidered, the reconstructed channels are the sum between the<br>
center channel and the low frequency channel (when this<br>
channel is not set to zero) on the one hand and the sum be-<br>
tween the left and right channels on the other hand. Thus,<br>
the center channel on the one hand and the mono signal on<br>
the other hand can be reconstructed using only a single pa-<br>
rameter. This feature can already be useful for a simple 3-<br>
channel representation, where the left and right signals<br>
are derived from the sum of left and right such as by halv-<br>
ing, and where the energy between the center and the sum of<br>
left and right is exactly determined by the balance parame-<br>
ter r2.<br><br>
In this context, the balance parameters r1 or r2 are situ-<br>
ated in a lower scaling layer.<br>
As to the second entry in the Fig. 10b table, which indi-<br>
cates how 3 channels B, D, and the sum between C and F can<br>
be generated using only two balance parameters instead of<br>
all 5 balance parameters, one of those parameters r1 and r2<br>
can already be in a higher scaling layer than the parameter<br>
r1 or r2, which is situated in the lower scaling layer.<br>
When the equations in Fig. 8 are considered, it becomes<br>
clear that, for calculating C, the non-extracted parameter<br>
r5 and the other non-extracted parameter r3 are set to 0.<br>
Additionally, the non-used channels A, E, F are also set to<br>
0, so that the 3 channels B, D, and the combination between<br>
the center channel C and the low frequency enhancement<br>
channel F can be calculated.<br>
When a 4-channel representation is to be up-mixed, it is<br>
sufficient to only extract parameters r1, r2, and r3 from<br>
the parameter data stream. In this context, r3 could be in<br>
a next-higher scaling layer than the other parameter r1 or<br>
r2. The 4-channel configuration is specially suitable in<br>
connection with the super-balance parameter representation<br>
of the present invention, since, as it will be described<br>
later on in connection with Fig. 6, the third balance pa-<br>
rameter r3 already is derived from a combination of the<br>
front channels on the one hand and the back channels on the<br>
other hand. This is due to the fact that the parameter r3<br>
is a front-back balance parameter, which is derived from<br>
the channel pair having, as a first channel, a combination<br>
of the back channels A and E, and having, as the front<br>
channels, a combination of left channel B, right channel E,<br>
and center channel C.<br>
Thus, the combined channel energy of both surround channels<br>
is automatically obtained without any further separate cal-<br><br>
culation and subsequent combination, as would be the case<br>
in a single reference channel set-up.<br>
When 5 channels have to be recreated from a single channel,<br>
the further balance parameter r4 is necessary. This parame-<br>
ter r4 can again be in a next-higher scaling layer.<br>
When a 5.1 reconstruction has to be performed, each balance<br>
parameter is required. Thus, a next-higher scaling layer<br>
including the next balance parameter r5 will have to be<br>
transmitted to a receiver and evaluated by the receiver.<br>
However, using the same approach of extending the IID pa-<br>
rameters in accordance to the extended number of channels,<br>
the above IID parameters can be extended to cover channel<br>
configuration s with a larger number of channels than the<br>
5.1 configuration. Hence the present invention is not lim-<br>
ited to the examples outlined above.<br>
Now observing the case were the channel configuration is a<br>
5.1 channel configuration this being one of the most com-<br>
monly used cases. Furthermore, assume that the 5.1. chan-<br>
nels are recreated from two channels. A different set of<br>
parameters can for this case be defined by replacing the<br>
parameters r3 and r4 by:<br><br>
The parameters q3 and g4 represent the energy ratio between<br>
the front and back left channels, and the energy ratio be-<br>
tween the front and back right channels. Several other<br>
parameterizations can be envisioned.<br><br>
In Fig. 5 the modified parameterization is visualized. In-<br>
stead of having one parameter outlining the energy distri-<br>
bution between the front and back channels (as was outlined<br>
by r3 in Fig. 4) and a parameter describing the energy dis-<br>
tribution between the left surround channel and the right<br>
surround channel (as was outlined by r4 in Fig. 4) the pa-<br>
rameters q3 and q4 are used describing the energy ratio be-<br>
tween the left front 102 and left surround 101 channel, and<br>
the energy ratio between the right front channel 104 and<br>
right surround channel 105.<br>
The present invention teaches that several parameter sets<br>
can be used to represent the multi-channel signals. An ad-<br>
ditional feature of the present invention is that different<br>
parameterizations can be chosen dependent on the type of<br>
quantization of the parameters that is used.<br>
As an example, a system using coarse quantization of the<br>
parameterization, due to high bit rate constraints, a<br>
parameterization should be used that does not amplify er-<br>
rors during the upmixing process.<br>
Observing two of the expressions above for the recon-<br>
structed energies in a system that re-creates 5.1 channels<br>
from one channel:<br><br>
It is evident that the subtractions can yield large varia-<br>
tions of the B and D energies due to quite small quantiza-<br>
tion effects of the M, A, C, and F parameters.<br>
According to the present invention a different parameteri-<br>
zation should be used that is less sensitive to quantiza-<br>
tion of the parameters. Hence, if coarse quantization is<br>
used, the r1 parameter as defined above:<br><br><br>
can be replaced by the alternative definition according to:<br><br>
This yields equations for the reconstructed energies ac-<br>
cording to:<br><br>
and the equations for the reconstructed energies of A, E, C<br>
and F stay the same as above. It is evident that this<br>
parameterization represents a more well conditioned system<br>
from a quantization point of view.<br>
In Fig. 6 the energy ratios as explained above are illus-<br>
trated. The different output channels are indicated by 101<br>
to 105 and are the same as in Fig.1 and are hence not<br>
elaborated on further here. The speaker set-up is divided<br>
into a front part and a back part. The energy distribution<br>
between the entire front channel set-up (102, 103 and 104)<br>
and the back channels (101 and 105) are illustrated by the<br>
arrow in Fig. 6 indicated by the r3 parameter.<br>
Another important noteworthy feature of the present inven-<br>
tion is that when observing the parameterization<br><br>
it is not only a more well conditioned system from a quan-<br>
tization point of view. The above parameterization also has<br>
the advantage that the parameters used to reconstruct the<br>
three front channels are derived without any influence of<br><br><br>
as taught by the present invention, since the back channels<br>
are not included in the estimation of the parameters used<br>
on the decoder side to re-create the front channels.<br>
The energy distribution between the center channel 103 and<br>
the left front 102 and right front 103 channels are indi-<br>
cated by r2 according to the present invention. The energy<br>
distribution between the left surround channel 101 and the<br>
right surround channel 105 is illustrated by r4. Finally,<br>
the energy distribution between the left front channel 102<br>
and the right front channel 104 is given by r1. As is evi-<br>
dent all parameters are the same as outlined in Fig.4 apart<br>
from rl that here corresponds to the energy distribution<br>
between the left front speaker and the right front speaker,<br>
as opposed to the entire left side and the entire right<br>
side. For completeness the parameter r5 is also given out-<br>
lining the energy distribution between the center channel<br>
103 and the lfe channel 106.<br>
Fig. 6 shows an overview of the preferred parameterization<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The first balance pa-<br>
rameter r1 (indicated by the solid line) constitutes a<br>
front-left/front-right balance parameter. The second bal-<br>
ance parameter r2 is a center left-right balance parameter.<br>
The third balance parameter r3 constitutes a front/back<br>
balance parameter. The forth balance parameter r4 consti-<br>
tutes a rear-left/rear-right balance parameter. Finally,<br>
the fifth balance parameter r5 constitutes a center/lfe<br>
balance parameter.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a related situation. The first balance parame-<br>
ter r1, which is illustrated in Fig. 4 by solid lines in<br>
case of a down-mix-left/right balance can be replaced by an<br>
original front-left/front-right balance parameter defined<br><br>
the surround channels. One could envision a parameter r2<br>
that describes the relation between the center channel and<br>
all other channels. However, this would have the drawback<br>
that the surround channels would be included in the estima-<br>
tion of the parameters describing the front channels.<br>
Remembering that the, in the present invention, described<br>
parameterization also can be applied to measurements of<br>
correlation or coherence between channels, it is evident<br>
that including the back channels in the calculation of r2<br>
can have significant negative influence of the success of<br>
re-creating the front channels accurately.<br>
As an example, one could imagine a situation with the same<br>
signal in all the front channels, and completely uncorre-<br>
lated signals in the back channels. This is not uncommon,<br>
given that the back channels are frequently used to re-<br>
create ambience information of the original sound.<br>
If the center channel is described in relation to all other<br>
channels, the correlation measure between the center and<br>
the sum of all other channels will be rather low, since the<br>
back channels are completely uncorrelated. The same will be<br>
true for a parameter estimating the correlation between the<br>
front left/right channels, and the back left/right chan-<br>
nels .<br>
Hence, we arrive with a parameterization that can recon-<br>
struct the energies correctly, but that does not include<br>
the information that all front channels were identical,<br>
i.e. strongly correlated. It does include the information<br>
that the left and right front channels are decorrelated to<br>
the back channels, and that the center channel is also<br>
decorrelated to the back channels. However, the fact that<br>
all front channels are the same is not derivable from such<br>
a parameterization.<br>
This is overcome by using the parameterization<br><br><br>
 between the channels B and D as the underlying channel<br>
pair. This is illustrated by the dashed line r1 in Fig. 4<br>
and corresponds to the solid line r1 in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.<br>
In a two-base channel situation, the parameters r3 and r4,<br>
i.e. the front/back balance parameter and the rear-<br>
left/right balance parameter are replaced by two single-<br>
sided front/rear parameters. The first single-sided<br>
front/rear parameter q3 can also be regarded as the first<br>
balance parameter, which is derived from the channel pair<br>
consisting of the left surround channel A and the left<br>
channel B. The second single-sided front/left balance pa-<br>
rameter is the parameter q4, which can be regarded as the<br>
second parameter, which is based on the second channel pair<br>
consisting of the right channel D and the right surround<br>
channel E. Again, both channel pairs are independent from<br>
each other. The same is true for the center/left-right bal-<br>
ance parameter r2, which have, as a first channel, a center<br>
channel C, and as a second channel, the sum of the left and<br>
right channels B, and D.<br>
Another parameterization that lends itself well to coarse<br>
quantization for a system re-creating 5.1 channels from one<br>
or two channel is defined according to the present inven-<br>
tion below.<br>
For the one to 5.1 channels:<br><br>
And for the two to 5.1 channels case:<br><br>
It is evident that the above parameterizations include more<br>
parameters than is required from the strictly theoretical<br>
point of view to correctly re-distribute the energy of the<br>
transmitted signals to the re-created signals. However, the<br>
parameterization is very insensitive to quantization er-<br>
rors.<br><br>
The above-referenced parameter set for a two-base channel<br>
set-up, makes use of several reference channels. In con-<br>
trast to the parameter configuration in Fig. 6, however,<br>
the parameter set in Fig. 7 solely relies on down-mix chan-<br>
nels rather than original channels as reference channels.<br>
The balance parameters q1, q3, and q4 are derived from com-<br>
pletely different channel pairs.<br>
Although several inventive embodiments have been described,<br>
in which the channel pairs for deriving balance parameters<br>
include only original channels (Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6) or<br>
include original channels as well as down-mix channels<br>
(Fig. 4, Fig. 5) or solely rely on the down-mix channels as<br>
the reference channels as indicated at the bottom of<br>
Fig. 7, it is preferred that the parameter generator in-<br>
cluded within the surround data encoder 206 of Fig. 2 is<br>
operative to only use original channels or combinations of<br>
original channels rather than a base channel or a combina-<br>
tion of base channels for the channels in the channel<br>
pairs, on which the balance parameters are based. This is<br>
due to the fact that one cannot completely guarantee that<br>
there does not occur an energy change to the single base<br>
channel or the two stereo base channels during their trans-<br>
mission from a surround encoder to a surround decoder. Such<br>
energy variations to the down-mix channels or the single<br>
down-mix channel can be caused by an audio encoder 205<br>
(Fig. 2) or an audio decoder 302 (Fig. 3) operating under a<br>
low-bit rate condition. Such situations can result in ma-<br>
nipulation of the energy of the mono down-mix channel or<br>
the stereo down-mix channels, which manipulation can be<br>
different between the left and right stereo down-mix chan-<br>
nels, or can even be frequency-selective and time-<br>
selective .<br>
In order to be completely safe against such energy varia-<br>
tions, an additional level parameter is transmitted for<br>
each block and frequency band for every downmix channel in<br><br>
accordance with the present invention. When the balance pa-<br>
rameters are based on the original signal rather than the<br>
down-mix signal, a single correction factor is sufficient<br>
for each band, since any energy correction will not influ-<br>
ence a balance situation between the original channels.<br>
Even when no additional level parameter is transmitted, any<br>
down-mix channel energy variations will not result in a<br>
distorted localization of sound sources in the audio image<br>
but will only result in a general loudness variation, which<br>
is not as annoying as a migration of a sound source caused<br>
by varying balance conditions.<br>
It is important to note that care needs to be taken so that<br>
the energy M (of the down-mixed channels), is the sum of<br>
the energies B, D, A, E, C and F as outlined above. This is<br>
not always the case due to phase dependencies between the<br>
different channels being down-mixed in to one channel. The<br>
energy correction factor can be transmitted as an addi-<br>
tional parameter rM , and the energy of the downmixed sig-<br>
nal received on the decoder side is thus defined as:<br><br>
In Fig. 9 the application of the additional parameter rM is<br>
outlined. The downmixed input signal is modified by the rM<br>
parameter in 901 prior to sending it into the upmix modules<br>
of 701 - 705. These are the same as in Fig. 7 and will<br>
therefore not be elaborated on further. It is obvious for<br>
those skilled in the art that the parameter rM for the sin-<br>
gle channel downmix example above, can be extended to be<br>
one parameter per downmix channel, and is hence not limited<br>
to a single downmix channel.<br>
Fig. 9a illustrates an inventive level parameter calcula-<br>
tor 900, while Fig. 9b indicates an inventive level correc-<br>
tor 902. Fig. 9a indicates the situation on the encoder-<br>
side, and Fig. 9b illustrates the corresponding situation<br>
on the decoder-side. The level parameter or "addiricnal"<br><br>
parameter rM is a correction factor giving a certain energy<br>
ratio. To explain this, the following exemplary scenario is<br>
assumed. For a certain original multi-channel signal, there<br>
exists a "master down-mix" on the one hand and a "parameter<br>
down-mix" on the other hand. The master down-mix has been<br>
generated by a sound engineer in a sound studio based on,<br>
for example, subjective quality impressions. Additionally,<br>
a certain audio storage medium also includes the parameter<br>
down-mix, which has been performed by for example the sur-<br>
round encoder 203 of Fig. 2. The parameter down-mix in-<br>
cludes one base channel or two base channels, which base<br>
channels form the basis for the multi-channel reconstruc-<br>
tion using the set of balance parameters or any other para-<br>
metric representation of the original multi-channel signal.<br>
There can be the case, for example, that a broadcaster<br>
wishes to not transmit the parameter down-mix but the mas-<br>
ter down-mix from a transmitter to a receiver. Addition-<br>
ally, for upgrading the master down-mix to multi-channel<br>
representation, the broadcaster also transmits a parametric<br>
representation of the original multi-channel signal. Since<br>
the energy (in one band and in one block) can (and typi-<br>
cally will) vary between the master down-mix and the pa-<br>
rameter down-mix, a relative level parameter rM is gener-<br>
ated in block 900 and transmitted to the receiver as an ad-<br>
ditional parameter. The level parameter is derived from the<br>
master down-mix and the parameter down-mix and is prefera-<br>
bly, a ratio between the energies within one block and one<br>
band of the master down-mix and the parameter down-mix.<br>
Generally, the level parameter is calculated as the ratio<br>
of the sum of the energies (Eorig) of the original channels<br>
and the energy of the downmix channel(s), wherein this<br>
downmix channel (s) can be the parameter downmix (EPD) or<br>
the master downmix (EMD) or any other downmix signal. Typi-<br>
cally, the energy of the specific downmix signal is used,<br>
which is transmitted from an encoder to a decoder.<br><br>
Fig. 9b illustrates a decoder-side implementation of the<br>
level parameter usage. The level parameter as well as the<br>
down-mix signal are input into the level corrector<br>
block 902. The level corrector corrects the single-base<br>
channel or the several-base channels depending on the level<br>
parameter. Since the additional parameter rM is a relative<br>
value, this relative value is multiplied by the energy of<br>
the corresponding base channel.<br>
Although Figs. 9a and 9b indicate a situation, in which the<br>
level correction is applied to the down-mix channel or the<br>
down-mix channels, the level parameter can also be inte-<br>
grated into the up-mixing matrix. To this end, each occur-<br>
rence of M in the equations in Fig. 8 is replaced by the<br>
term "rM M".<br>
Studying the case when re-creating 5.1 channels from 2<br>
channels, the following observation is made.<br>
If the present invention is used with an underlying audio<br>
codec as outlined in Fig 2 and Fig 3 205 and 302. some more<br>
consideration needs to be made. Observing the IID parame-<br>
ters as defined earlier where r1 was defined according to<br><br>
this parameter is implicitly available on the decoder side<br>
since the system is re-creating 5.1 channels from 2 chan-<br>
nels, provided that the two transmitted channels is the<br>
stereo downmix of the surround channels.<br>
However, the audio codec operating under a bit rate con-<br>
straint may modify the spectral distribution so that the L<br>
and R energies as measured on the decoder differ from their<br>
values on the encoder side. According to the present inven-<br>
tion such influence on the energy distribution of the re-<br>
created channels vanishes by transmitting the parameter<br><br><br>
also for the case when reconstruction 5.1 channels from two<br>
channels.<br>
If signaling means are provided the encoder can code the<br>
present signal segment using different parameter sets and<br>
choose the set of IID parameters that give the lowest over-<br>
head for the particular signal segment being processed. It<br>
is possible that the energy levels between the right front<br>
and back channels are similar, and that the energy levels<br>
between the front and back left channel are similar but<br>
significantly different to the levels in the right front<br>
and back channel. Given delta coding of parameters and sub-<br>
sequent entropy coding it can be more efficient to use pa-<br>
rameters q3 and q4 instead of r3 and r4. For another signal<br>
segment with different characteristics a different parame-<br>
ter set may give a lower bit rate overhead. The present in-<br>
vention allows to freely switching between different pa-<br>
rameter representations in order to minimize the bit rate<br>
overhead for the presently encoded signal segment given the<br>
characteristics of the signal segment. The ability to<br>
switch between different parameterizations of the IID pa-<br>
rameters in order to obtain the lowest possible bit rate<br>
overhead, and provide signaling means to indicate what<br>
parameterization is presently used, is an essential feature<br>
of the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, the delta coding of the parameters can be done<br>
in either the frequency direction or in the time direction,<br>
as well as delta coding between different parameters. Ac-<br>
cording to the present invention, a parameter can be delta<br>
coded with respect to any other parameter, given that sig-<br>
naling means are provided indicating the particular delta<br>
coding used.<br>
An interesting feature for any coding scheme is the ability<br>
to do scalable coding. This means that the coded bitstream<br>
can be divided into several different layers. The core<br><br>
layer is decodable by itself, and the higher layers can be<br>
decoded to enhance the decoded core layer signal. For dif-<br>
ferent circumstances the number of available layers may<br>
vary, but as long as the core layer is available the de-<br>
coder can produce output samples. The parameterization for<br>
the multi-channel coding as outlined above using the r1 to<br>
r5 parameters lend them selves very well to scalable cod-<br>
ing. Hence, it is possible to store the data for e.g. the<br>
two surround channels (A and E) in an enhancement layer,<br>
i.e. the parameters r3 and r4, and the parameters corre-<br>
sponding to the front channels in a core layer, represented<br>
by parameters r1 and r2.<br>
In Fig. 10 a scalable bitstream implementation according to<br>
the present invention is outlined. The bitstream layers are<br>
illustrated by 1001 and 1002, where 1001 is the core layer<br>
holding the wave-form coded downmix signals and the parame-<br>
ters r1 and r2 required to re-create the front channels<br>
(102, 103 and 104). The enhancement layer illustrated by<br>
1002 holds the parameters for re-creating the back channels<br>
(101 and 105).<br>
Another important aspect of the present invention is the<br>
usage of decorrelators in a multi-channel configuration.<br>
The concept of using a decorrelator was elaborated on for<br>
the one to two channel case in the PCT/SE02/01372 document.<br>
However when extending this theory to more than two chan-<br>
nels several problems arise that the present invention<br>
solves.<br>
Elementary mathematics show that in order to achieve M<br>
mutually decorrelated signals from N signals, M-N<br>
decorrelators are required, where all the different decor-<br>
relators are functions that create mutually orthogonal out-<br>
put signals from a common input signal. A decorrelator is<br>
typically an allpass or near allpass filter that given an<br><br>
input x(t)produces an output y(t)with E \y\ =E \x\ and almost<br>
vanishing cross-correlation E[YX.] Further perceptual cri-<br>
teria come in to the design of a good decorrelator, some<br>
examples of design methods can be to also minimize the<br>
comb-filter character when adding the original signal to<br>
the decorrelated signal and to minimize the effect of a<br>
sometimes too long impulse response at transient signals.<br>
Some prior art decorrelators utilizes an artificial rever-<br>
berator to decorrelate. Prior art also includes fractional<br>
delays by e.g. modifying the phase of the complex subband<br>
samples, to achieve higher echo density and hence more time<br>
diffusion.<br>
The present invention suggests methods of modifying a re-<br>
verberation based decorrelator in order to achieve multiple<br>
decorrelators creating mutually decorrelated output signals<br>
from a common input signal. Two decorrelators are mutually<br>
decorrelated if their outputs y1{t) and y2(t) have vanishing<br>
or almost vanishing cross-correlation given the same input.<br>
Assuming the input is stationary white noise it follows<br>
that the impulse responses h1 and h2 must be orthogonal in<br>
the sense that E[h1h2.]is vanishing or almost vanishing. Sets<br>
of pair wise mutually decorrelated decorrelators can be<br>
constructed in several ways. An efficient way of doing such<br>
modifications is to alter the phase rotation factor q that<br>
is part of the fractional delay.<br>
The present invention stipulates that the phase rotation<br>
factors can be part of the delay lines in the all-pass fil-<br>
ters or just an overall fractional delay. In the latter<br>
case this method is not limited to all-pass or reverbera-<br>
tion like filters, but can also be applied to e.g. simple<br>
delays including a fractional delay part. An all-pass fil-<br><br>
ter link in the decorrelator can be described in the Z-<br>
domain as:<br><br>
where q is the complex valued phase rotation factor<br>
(|q| = l), m is the delay line length in samples and a is the<br>
filter coefficient. For stability reasons, the magnitude of<br>
the filter coefficient has to be limited to |α|<l- however></l->
by using the alternative filter coefficient a=-a, a new<br>
reverberator is defined having the same reverberation decay<br>
properties but with an output significantly uncorrelated<br>
with the output from the non-modified reverberator. Fur-<br>
thermore, a modification of the phase rotation factor q ,<br>
can be done by e.g. adding a constant phase offset, q' = qejC.<br>
The constant C, can be used as a constant phase offset or<br>
could be scaled in a way that it would correspond to a con-<br>
stant time offset for all frequency bands it is applied on.<br>
The phase offset constant C , can also be a random value<br>
that is different for all frequency bands.<br>
According to the present invention, the generation of n<br>
channels from m channels is performed by applying an upmix<br>
matrix H of size n×(m + p) to a column vector of size<br>
(m+p)×1 of signals<br><br>
wherein mare the m downmixed and coded signals, and<br>
the p signals in s are both mutually decorrelated and<br>
decorrelated from all signals in m . These decorrelated<br>
signals are produced from the signals in m by decorrela-<br>
tors. The n reconstructed signals a',b',...are then contained<br>
in the column vector<br><br><br>
The above is illustrated by Fig. 11, where the decorre-<br>
lated signals are created by the decorrelators 1102, 1103<br>
and 1104. The upmix matrix H is given by 1101 operating on<br>
the vector y giving the output signal x' .<br>
LetR = E[xx.] be the correlation matrix of the original sig-<br>
nal vector let R' = E[x'x'.] be the correlation matrix of the<br>
reconstructed signal. Here and in the following, for a ma-<br>
trix or a vector X with complex entries, X. denotes the<br>
adjoint matrix, the complex conjugate transpose of X.<br>
The diagonal of R contains the energy values A,B,C,... and<br>
can be decoded up to a total energy level from the energy<br>
quotas defined above. Since R.=R, there are only n(n-1)/2<br>
different off diagonal cross-correlation values containing<br>
information that is to be reconstructed fully or partly by<br>
adjusting the upmix matrix H. A reconstruction of the<br>
full correlation structure corresponds to the case R'=R.<br>
Reconstruction of correct energy levels only correspond to<br>
the case where R'and Rare equal on their diagonals.<br>
In the case of n channels from m=1channel, a reconstruc-<br>
tion of the full correlation structure is achieved by us-<br>
ing p=n-\ mutually decorrelated decorrelators an upmix<br>
matrixHwhich satisfies the condition<br><br>
where M is the energy of the single transmitted signal .<br>
Since R is positive semidefinite it is well known that<br>
such a solution exists. Moreover, n(n-1)/2 degrees of free-<br>
dom are left over for the design of H, which are used in<br>
the present invention to obtain further desirable proper-<br>
ties of the upmix matrix. A central design criterion is<br>
that the dependence of H on the transmitted correlation<br>
data shall be smooth.<br><br>
One convenient way of parametrizing the upmix matrix is<br>
H = UDV where U and V are orthogonal matrices and D is a<br>
diagonal matrix. The squares of the absolute values of<br>
D can be chosen equal to the eigenvalues of R/M . Omit-<br>
ting V and sorting the eigenvalues so that the largest<br>
value is applied to the first coordinate will minimize the<br>
overall energy of decorrelated signals in the output. The<br>
orthogonal matrix U is in the real case parameterized by<br>
n(n-1)/2 rotation angles. Transmitting correlation data in<br>
the form of those angles and the n diagonal values of<br>
D would immediately give the desired smooth dependence of<br>
H. However since energy data has to be transformed into<br>
eigenvalues, scalability is sacrificed by this approach.<br>
A second method taught by the present invention, consists<br>
of separating the energy part from the correlation part<br>
in R by defining a normalized correlation matrix R0 by<br>
R = GR0G where G is a diagonal matrix with the diagonal<br>
values equal to the square roots of the diagonal entries<br>
of R, that is, √A,√B..., and R0 has ones on the diagonal.<br>
Let H0 be is an orthogonal upmix matrix defining the pre-<br>
ferred normalized upmix in the case of totally uncorre-<br>
lated signals of equal energy. Examples of such preferred<br>
upmix matrices are<br><br>
The upmix is then defined by H = GSH0/√M, where the ma-<br>
trix S solves SS.=R0 . The dependence of this solution on<br><br>
the normalized cross-correlation values in R0 is chosen to<br>
be continuous and such that Sis equal to the identity ma-<br>
trix I in the case R0=I.<br>
Dividing the n channels into groups of fewer channels is a<br>
convenient way to reconstruct partial cross-correlation<br>
structure. According to the present invention, a particu-<br>
lar advantageous grouping for the case of 5.1 channels<br>
from 1 channel is {a,e},{c},{b,d},{f} , where no decorrelation<br>
is applied for the groups {c},{f}, and the groups {a,e},{b,d}<br>
are produced by upmix of the same downmixed/decorrelated<br>
pair. For these two subsystems, the preferred normalized<br>
upmixes in the totally uncorrelated case are to be chosen<br>
as<br><br>
respectively. Thus only two of the totality of 15 cross-<br>
correlations will be transmitted and reconstructed, namely<br>
those between channels {a,e) and {b,d} . In the terminology<br>
used above, this is an example of a design for the case<br>
n = 6, m = 1, and p = 1. The upmix matrix His of size<br>
6 x 2 with zeros at the two entries in the second column at<br>
rows 3 and 6 corresponding to outputs c'and f' .<br>
A third approach taught by the present invention for in-<br>
corporating decorrelated signals is the simpler point of<br><br>
view that each output channel has a different decorrelator<br>
giving rise to decorrelated signals sa,sb,... . The recon-<br>
structed signals are then formed as<br><br>
The parameters φa,,φb,... control the amount of decorrelated<br>
signal present in output channels a',b',.... The correlation<br>
data is transmitted in form of these angles. It is easy to<br>
compute that the resulting normalized cross-correlation be-<br>
tween, for instance, channel a' and V is equal to the<br>
product coφacosφb. As the number of pairwise cross-<br>
correlations is n(n-1)/2 and there are n decorrelators it<br>
will not be possible in general with this approach to match<br>
a given correlation structure if n&gt;3, but the advantages<br>
are a very simple and stable decoding method, and the di-<br>
rect control on the produced amount of decorrelated signal<br>
present in each output channel. This enables for the mixing<br>
of decorrelated signals to be based on perceptual criteria<br>
incorporating for instance energy level differences of<br>
pairs of channels.<br>
For the case of n channels from m&gt;\ channels, the correla-<br>
tion matrix Ry = E[yy*]can no longer be assumed diagonal,<br>
and this has to be taken into account in the matching of<br>
R' = HRyH. to the targetR . A simplification occurs, since<br>
Ry has the block matrix structure<br><br><br>
where Rm = E[mm.] and Rs = E[ss.]. Furthermore, assuming mutu-<br>
ally decorrelated decorrelators, the matrix Rs is diago-<br>
nal. Note that this also affects the upmix design with re-<br>
spect to the reconstruction of correct energies. The solu-<br>
tion is to compute in the decoder, or to transmit from the<br>
encoder, information about the correlation structure Rm of<br>
the downmixed signals.<br>
For the case of 5.1 channels from 2 channels a preferred<br>
method for upmix is<br><br>
where s1 is obtained from decorrelation of m1=ld and s2 is ob-<br>
tained from decorrelation of m2=rd .<br>
Here the groups [a,b] and {d,e} are treated as separate<br>
1—&gt;2 channels systems taking into account the pairwise<br>
cross-correlations. For channels cand f, the weights are<br>
to be adjusted such that<br><br><br>
The present invention can be implemented in both hardware<br>
chips and DSPs, for various kinds of systems, for storage<br>
or transmission of signals, analogue or digital, using ar-<br>
bitrary codecs. Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 show a possible implemen-<br>
tation of the present invention. In this example a system<br>
operating on six input signals (a 5.1 channel configura-<br>
tion) is displayed. In Fig.2 the encoder side is displayed<br>
the analogue input signals for the separate channels are<br>
converted to a digital signal 201 and analyzed using a fil-<br>
terbank for every channel 202. The output from the filter-<br>
banks is fed to the surround encoder 203 including a pa-<br>
rameter generator that performs a downmix creating the one<br>
or two channels encoded by the audio encoder 205. Further-<br>
more, the surround parameters such as the IID and ICC pa-<br>
rameters are extracted according to the present invention,<br>
and control data outlining the time frequency grid of the<br>
data as well as which parameterization is used is extracted<br>
204 according to the present invention. The extracted pa-<br>
rameters are encoded 206 as taught by the present inven-<br>
tion, either switching between different parameterizations<br>
or arranging the parameters in a scalable fashion. The sur-<br>
round parameters 207, control signals and the encoded down<br>
mixed signals 208 are multiplexed 209 into a serial bit-<br>
stream.<br>
In Fig. 3 a typical decoder implementation, i.e. an appara-<br>
tus for generating multi-channel reconstruction is dis-<br>
played. Here it is assumed that the Audio decoder outputs a<br>
signal in a frequency domain representation, e.g. the out-<br>
put from the MPEG-4 High efficiency AAC decoder prior to<br>
the QMF synthesis filterbank. The serial bitstream is de-<br>
multiplexed 301 and the encoded surround data is fed to the<br>
surround data decoder 303 and the down mixed encoded chan-<br>
nels are fed to the audio decoder 302, in this example an<br>
MPEG-4 High Efficiency AAC decoder. The surround data de-<br>
coder decodes the surround data and feeds it to the sur-<br>
round decoder 305, which includes an upmixer, that recre-<br><br>
ates six channels based on the decoded down-mixed channels<br>
and the surround data and the control signals. The fre-<br>
quency domain output from the surround decoder is synthe-<br>
sized 306 to time domain signals that are subsequently con-<br>
verted to analogue signals by the DAC 307.<br>
Although the present invention has mainly been described<br>
with reference to the generation and usage of balance pa-<br>
rameters, it is to be emphasized here that preferably the<br>
same grouping of channel pairs for deriving balance parame-<br>
ters is also used for calculating inter-channel coherence<br>
parameters or "width" parameters between these two channel<br>
pairs. Additionally, inter-channel time differences or a<br>
kind of "phase cues" can also be derived using the same<br>
channel pairs as used for the balance parameter calcula-<br>
tion. On the receiver-side, these parameters can be used in<br>
addition or as an alternative to the balance parameters to<br>
generate a multi-channel reconstruction. Alternatively, the<br>
inter-channel coherence parameters or even the inter-<br>
channel time differences can also be used in addition to<br>
other inter-channel level differences determined by other<br>
reference channels. In view of the scalability feature of<br>
the present invention as discussed in connection with<br>
Fig. 10a and Fig. 10b, it is, however, preferred to use the<br>
same channel pairs for all parameters so that, in a scal-<br>
able bit stream, each scaling layer includes all parameters<br>
for reconstructing the sub-group of output channels, which<br>
can be generated by the respective scaling layer as out-<br>
lined in the penultimate column of the Fig. 10b table. The<br>
present invention is useful, when only the coherence pa-<br>
rameters or the time difference parameters between the re-<br>
spective channel pairs are calculated and transmitted to a<br>
decoder. In this case, the level parameters already exist<br>
at the decoder for usage when a multichannel reconstruction<br>
is performed.<br><br>
Depending on certain implementation requirements of the in-<br>
ventive methods, the inventive methods can be implemented<br>
in hardware or in software. The implementation can be per-<br>
formed using a digital storage medium, in particular a disk<br>
or a CD having electronically readable control signals<br>
stored thereon, which cooperate with a programmable com-<br>
puter system such that the inventive methods are performed.<br>
Generally, the present invention is, therefore, a computer<br>
program product with a program code stored on a machine<br>
readable carrier, the program code being operative for per-<br>
forming the inventive methods when the. computer program<br>
product runs on a computer. In other words, the inventive<br>
methods are, therefore, a computer program having a program<br>
code for performing at least one of the inventive methods<br>
when the computer program runs on a computer.<br><br>
