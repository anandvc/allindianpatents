WORKING GANTRY<br>
STINGL GMBH of DIMBACHER STRASSE  25,  74182  OBERSULM-WILLSBACH, GERMANY,  GERMAN Company<br>
GRANTED<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br>
5-10-2005<br>
ORIGINAL 743 MUMNP 2004<br><br>
The invention relates to a work stage for receiving and/or positioning a work platform.<br>
The work stage comprises a device for receiving and/or positioning a work platform,<br>
the device for the work platform has a support part to which the work platform is attached by means of a first holder and which supports the entire device,<br>
the work platform can rest against a counter-support or a wall in the area of a first side by means of the first holder,<br>
the work platform is connected by means of the first holder to a vertical strut that is arranged essentially at a right angle to a crossbeam of the work platform,<br>
on a second side opposite from the first side, the work platform has a second holder by means of which the work platform can be held,<br>
the second holder is connected to a tie rod,<br>
the tie rod is rigidly and/or movably cormected with its one end to the work platform and with its other end to the vertical strut,<br>
on the work platform, parallel to and at a distance from the first vertical strut, at least one additional vertical strut can be installed that serves to receive one or more transverse struts.<br>
French patent specification FR 2 641 018 relates to an assembly device for elevator shafts. It is attached to the door threshold and has two parallel bars that rest against the opposite wall. In addition, a supporting ladder element is provided as the mode of access to a horizontal work platform. The bars are configured as telescopic rods with locking pins and they enclose an angle of 25Â° relative to the horizontal. This assembly device is very complex and configured with numerous parts. A rapid and simple assembly is not possible.<br>
Moreover, a work stage is known that has the following features (DE 199 28 574 C2). The work stage comprises a device for receiving and/or positioning a work platform. The device serves to position the work platform and is equipped with a holder or a support part on which the work platform is adjustably arranged and that serves as a bracing part. For this purpose, the holder has an arrangement by means of which the work platform can be supported on one side against a counter-support or against a wall. Moreover, on an opposing side, the work platform has a second arrangement that can likewise be supported against a counter-support or a wall by means of the support part. Facing the opposing side, the holder has a safety mechanism for the work platform that consists of a holding means and of a beam as a supporting device and that has a second support part that can be laid against the wall. The holding means is configured as a tie rod whose one end is cormected to the work platform and whose other end is movably cormected to the beam. In order for the work platform to be supported, it has to have at least two side walls that are opposite from each other and provided in a shaft section.<br><br>
German patent specification DE 803 075 C as well as world patent application WO 00/70169 A both describe a work stage with a vertical strut that is rigid with respect to the door opening, whereby a crossbeam for receiving a work platform is bearing-mounted so as to swivel on said vertical strut. The crossbeam is affixed on its side opposite to the vertical strut by means of a tie rod that is attached to the vertical strut above the crossbeam. The tie rod can be articulated so that the work platform can be folded open and closed.<br>
The invention is based on the objective of creating a simply constructed work stage for shafts of elevators or for other shafts that can be installed in the area of the wall opening or door opening by one single person within a very short period of time.<br>
This objective is achieved according to the invention in that the vertical strut and the crossbeam of the work platform that are connected to the vertical strut by means of the tie rod are bearing-mounted by means of the first holder so as to pivot simultaneously around a shared bolt on the support part.<br>
Due to the advantageous configuration and arrangement of the work stage, it can also be placed against just one vertical wall that is provided with an opening and it can easily be clamped into this opening without there being a need for a wall element opposite from the wall opening or door opening for this purpose. The work stage is placed in a simple maimer with its vertical strut into the wall opening, whereby the lower part rests on a floor or cover section of the floor while the upper part of the vertical strut pivots against the inside of the wall and comes to rest against this wall, from where the assembly is carried out.<br>
With an eye towards simple assembly, it is advantageous for the crossbeam and the vertical strut to be placed into the first holder and subsequently secured by means of a bolt.<br>
For this purpose, it is advantageous for the work platform to be formed by the crossbeam and by a baseplate that lies on the crossbeam, whereby the crossbeam is connected to the tie rod by means of the second holder.<br>
Regarding an adaptation to the shaft size, it is advantageous for the tie rod to be connected to the second holder by means of an articulated joint connection.<br>
It is also advantageous for the first vertical strut to be connected to the second vertical strut by means of three transverse struts that are arranged essentially horizontally.<br>
Regarding a flexible use, it is advantageous that, above the work platform, there is a second work platform with a baseplate that is connected to the first vertical strut and to the second vertical strut by means of a crossbeam.<br>
For this purpose, it is also advantageous for a vertical strut and a vertical rear strut to be associated with the second work platform, whereby the vertical strut is attached to the crossbeam and the rear strut is inserted into the vertical strut.<br>
It is especially advantageous for the vertical strut and the rear strut to be connected by means of three essentially horizontal transverse struts.<br><br>
For this purpose, it is advantageous for the work platform to have an opening as a passage and for a ladder.<br>
For this purpose, it is advantageous for the first vertical strut to receive or support the entire work platform.<br>
An additional possibility according to an embodiment is that the support part for supporting or receiving the work platform is configured as a mating element and/or as a form-fitting element.<br>
Furthermore, it is advantageous for the support part to be configured as a bracket that can rest against the corner part of a wall or of a door threshold. Through the use of a bracket, the vertical strut can easily rest on and be clamped onto the corner area of the floor, so that the floor bears the main load of the entire work platform, whereby the upper part of the vertical strut merely absorbs the tensile load of the work platform.<br>
It is also advantageous for the first holder to have a vertical receiving part to receive the vertical strut in a form-fitting manner and/or a second horizontal receiving part to receive the horizontal crossbeam to which the baseplate can be cormected, and a U-shaped receiving part to receive the vertical and the horizontal receiving parts.<br>
Since horizontal receiving parts are used, side parts or grate fasteners or else additional struts that serve to receive the work platform can be readily mounted on the work platform so that the height can easily be changed within the device in this manner. In the embodiment, only the right-hand part of the work stage is shown. The work stage consists of two similar or identical receiving parts between which the work platform or the baseplate is suspended or attached. Laterally, the baseplate or the work stage is secured by lateral delimitations which are configured as transverse struts.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the solution according to the invention, it is finally provided that at least the horizontal receiving part and the vertical receiving part form a one-piece component.<br>
An especially significant aspect for the present invention is the fact that the U-shaped receiving part can be permanently connected to the support part configured as a bracket.<br>
In conjunction with the configuration and arrangement according to the invention, it is advantageous for the tie rod to be cormected to the vertical strut by means of an upper holder in the area of the upper part of said vertical strut.<br>
It is also advantageous for the holders and/or the vertical struts to each have at least one connecting means that serves to receive horizontal or approximately horizontal or slanted additional transverse struts and/or baseplates.<br>
Moreover, it is advantageous that the connecting means are adjustably mounted on the vertical struts and can be attached to the vertical struts by means of safety elements or bolts.<br><br>
Moreover, it is advantageous for some of the receiving parts to be configured as a tube and some as a bracket, L-shaped part or U-shaped part.<br>
Finally, it is advantageous that the receiving parts, which are connected to each other, can be connected to each other in an articulated manner.<br>
It is also advantageous for the work platform or the baseplate to be of such a width and/or length that it can be pivoted through the door opening.<br>
Additional advantages and details of the invention are explained in the claims and in the description and depicted in the figures. The figures show the following;<br>
Figure la a schematic depiction of a work stage that can be used in elevator shafts or placed in wall openings of buildings;<br>
Figure lb      various positions of the pivotable work stage;<br>
Figure 2 another embodiment of the work stage with a double frame, which is attached to the upper end of the work stage;<br>
Figures 3+4 . various arrangements for cormecting the struts of the work stage.<br>
In the drawing, the reference numeral 1 designates a device for receiving and/or for positioning a work platform which can be placed and attached either between two opposing walls 10.1,10.2 of an elevator shaft or, in a simple manner, in the opening of a vertical wall 10.1, in the area of a door threshold 7. The device 1 for securing the work platform has a foot that is configured as a support part 4 and, in this embodiment, consists of a bracket. In an advantageous manner, the support part 4 or the bracket can be placed onto a corner edge at the bottom of a wall 10.1 or of a door threshold 7 and, in this way, it can hold the entire device 1 for receiving and/or positioning the work platform 2. A first holder 12 is securely attached to the support part or to the bracket 4.<br>
The first holder 12, as shown in Figure 4, consists of a horizontal receiving part 12.1 whose cross section is U-shaped. A horizontal receiving part 12.2 is placed into the U-shaped receiving part 12.1 of the holder 12, and said receiving part is configured as a square or rectangular tube and can be cormected to a vertical receiving part 12.3 or welded to the wall sections of the vertical receiving part 12.3 that is configured as a square or rectangular tube. A horizontal crossbeam 16 is inserted and likewise secured in the horizontal receiving part 12.2 of the first holder 12. One or more bores 24 can be provided in the legs of the U-shaped receiving part 12.1 in order to receive a bolt 23 that extends through bores (not shown in the drawing) of the horizontal receiving part 12.2, of the crossbeam 16 and of the vertical receiving part 12.3. There can also be several bores arranged next to each other in the legs of the U-shaped receiving part 12.1 and/or in the crossbeam 16, so that the crossbeam 16 can be moved horizontally in the receiving part 4 and adapted to the different conditions, for example, with respect to Figures la and lb, to the shaft width between the walls 10.1,10.2.<br><br>
Laterally from the crossbeam 16, the lower end of a vertically oriented strut or vertical strut 14 can be received in the vertical receiving part 12.3. The vertical strut 14 can likewise be locked by the above-mentioned bolt 23. The vertical strut 14 can be configured as a simple rectangular tube or as a telescopic tube, so that the length of the vertical strut 14 can be changed and adapted to the varying working conditions.<br>
The first holder 12, as already mentioned, is connected to the bracket 4 either permanently or else detachably by means of screw elements (not shown here). The embodiment depicted in Figure 4 shows only the right-hand receiving part 12. However, the work platform 2 requires at least two identical first holders 12 that are at a distance from each other in a direction that is at a right angle to the drawing plane, on each of which a crossbeam 16 is provided. A baseplate 15 is depicted in Figures la and lb which rests on the two crossbeams 16 that are arranged at a distance from each other and which can be attached to said crossbeams 16. The first holder 12, which is offset towards the back at a right angle to the drawing plane, and the appertaining crossbeam 16 are not shown. The baseplate 15 forms the work platform 2 on which the worker can move freely.<br>
The support part 4 is attached at a first side 6a of the work platform 2. At a second side 6b of the work platform 2 opposite from the support part 4, there is a second holder 9 which is depicted in greater detail in Figures 3 and 4. The second holder 9 serves to connect a tie rod 11, which here is connected at one end to the second holder 9 rigidly or movably by means of a bolt or an articulated joint connection 20 respectively, while the other end of the tie rod 11 is cormected to another vertical, upper holder 3, likewise by means of a hinge bolt 21. The upper holder 3 according to Figures 2 and 4 is connected to the vertical strut 14 rigidly, but in such a way that its height is adjustable.<br>
The second holder 9, as shown in Figures 3 and 4, consists of a vertical receiving part 26 and of a horizontal receiving part 17 that can likewise be configured as rectangular tubes. A vertical strut 33 is held in the receiving part 26 and the horizontal crossbeam 16 is held in the receiving part 17. The crossbeam 16 and the vertical struts 33 are illustrated in greater detail in Figures la and 2 and can be secured by means of the bolts 23 shown in Figure 4.<br>
The receiving part 26 is followed by a slanted receiving part 18 whose cross section consists of a U-shaped section into which the lower end of the tie rod or of the slanted strut 11 is inserted and secured by means of the safety bolt 20. There can be several bores arranged next to each other in the receiving part 19 and/or in the tie rod 11 so that the safety bolt 20 can be inserted in various positions, thus changing the connection site of the tie rod 11. The other or upper end of the tie rod 11 is likewise arranged in a slanted receiving part 18.1 and locked by means of the safety bolt 21. The two receiving parts 18 and 18,1, which enclose an angle of 45Â° relative to the vertical or horizontal, can also be connected to the horizontal receiving part 17 and to the vertical receiving part 26 in such a way that the angular position of the receiving part 18.1 or 18 can change with respect to the horizontal.<br>
The two holders 9 and 12 are located on both sides of the work stage 2, which is rectangular in shape in the embodiment according to Figures la, lb and 2. In the embodiment, there are two vertical struts 14, 33 to which the tie rod 11 is attached. The vertical struts 14,33 are arranged at<br><br>
a distance from each other, whereby the vertical strut 33 is provided in the area of the second side 6b on the baseplate 15. The horizontal crossbeam 16 for receiving the baseplate 15 and the transverse struts 29, 30 and 31 or, according to Figure 2, the transverse struts 34.2, 35 and 36 and the crossbeam 34 for receiving another baseplate 39, are located between the vertical struts 14 and 33. According to Figure la, the ends of the transverse struts 29 to 31 or 34.2 to 36 are each held in connecting means 13.1,13.2. The connecting means 13.1,13.2, as shown by way of the example of the connecting means 13.3 according to Figure 4, are attached to the various holders 12 and 9 or, according to Figure 2, directly to the vertical struts 14 and 33.<br>
The connecting means can likewise each be placed with one holder onto the vertical struts 14,33. The connecting means 13.1,13.2, as already mentioned and shown in Figure la, serve to receive the horizontal transverse struts 30, 31. According to Figure 2, the transverse strut 34.2 is connected to the connecting means 13.4, which is directly attached to the holder 5. The transverse struts 29 to 31 and 34.2 to 36, including the connecting means 13.1 to 13.4 and the crossbeams 16, 34, can be locked with the bolts (not shown in the drawing), whereby the transverse strut 36 can be configured as a handrail.<br>
The transverse struts 29 to 31 and 34.2 to 36 serve to laterally delimit the work platforms 2, 2' and also to safeguard the worker on the work platforms 2, 2'. Moreover, however, the crossbeams 16, 34 can also to serve to receive baseplates 15 that, depending on the working conditions, can be mounted at different heights so as to accordingly follow the work progress upwards and to provide the operator with one or more work platforms 2,2' at various levels.<br>
In the embodiment, according to Figure 2, another vertical strut 14.2 and a rear strut 37 are provided, whereby the lower end of the vertical strut 14.2 can be connected to the transverse strut 34 permanently and/or detachably by means of a connecting means. The vertical strut 14.2 likewise has connecting means on which the transverse struts 35, 34.2 and 36 are placed. This results in two different work platforms 2, 2' at different heights. The upper work platform 2' or the baseplate 39 can be accessed via a ladder 38 that stands upright in the area of the lower work platform 2.<br>
In an advantageous manner, the vertical strut 14 and/or a vertical strut 14.2 are configured in such a way that they can bear the entire weight of one or more work platforms with all of the appertaining individual parts. For this purpose, the vertical strut 14, as already mentioned, rests with its lower end against the wall section 10.1 and with its upper contact part 14.1 against the inside 40 of a door lintel 19.1 of a door opening 19. The door lintel 19.1 absorbs the entire tilting moment of a work platform 2. The other parts of the work platform 2 are secured only by the two tie rods 11 situated next to each other. Additional support elements are not necessary.<br>
The crossbeams 16 and the transverse struts 29 to 31 and 34 to 36 can likewise be configured with a variable length. Therefore, for example, the working area of the work platform 2 can be enlarged or the work platform 2 can be adapted to the depth of the shaft (not shown in the drawing).<br><br>
