DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to laundry detergent compositions suitable for washing both white and coloured fabrics.  The compositions of the invention contain cationic detergent surfactant and also contain a specific sequestrant, iminodisuccinate or hydroxyiminodisuccinate.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Laundry detergent compositions containing cationic surfactants in combination with anionic and/or nonionic surfactants are disclosed in many published documents, for example, EP 225A, EP 234A, EP 235A and EP 51 896B (Procter &amp; Gamble).<br>
Iminodisuccinate (IDS) is known as a detergency builder and, in bleaching detergent compositions, as a stabiliser for peroxy bleach precursors.<br>
US 3 697 453 (Pfizer) discloses detergent compositions having a pH of from 9 to 12, containing iminodisuccinate as a detergency builder, used together with detergent surfactant in a weight ratio of 0.25:1 to 10:1.  IDS as a detergency builder is also disclosed in EP 757 094A (Bayer). IDS and hydroxyiminodisuccinate (HIDS) are disclosed in JP 09 110 813A (Nippon Shokubai) and JP 09 104 897A (Nippon Shokubai).  HIDS as a detergency builder and complexing agent is disclosed in US 5 318 726 (Henkel KGaA). EP 509 382A (W R Grace &amp; Co/Hampshire Chemical Corporation)<br>
2<br><br>
discloses a bleaching detergent composition comprising a bleaching agent and a bleach stabiliser of defined formula which includes IDS.<br>
JP 09 249 895A (Lion) and JP 09 310 097A (Lion) disclose detergent compositions containing 3 to 2 0 wt% IDS or HIDS to improve the stability or fabric substantivity of fluorescers (optical brighteners).<br>
The use of IDS as a processing aid for detergent powders and detergent powder ingredients is disclosed in JP 09 100 497A (Lion) and JP 09 279 188A (Lion).<br>
It has now been found that detergent compositions containing cationic detergent surfactant and low levels of IDS or HIDS exhibit improved soil and stain removal in conjunction with reduced fading of dyes on coloured fabrics.<br>
DEFINITION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention accordingly provides a laundry detergent composition comprising surfactant, builder, and optionally other detergent ingredients, the composition comprising<br>
(a)	from 0.1 to 10 wt% of a cationic detergent surfactant, and<br>

Nonionic surfactant, if present, is preferably used in an amount within the range of from 1 to 20% by weight.<br>
The total amount of surfactant present is preferably within the range of from 5 to 60 wt%.<br>
4<br><br>
Detergency Builders<br>
The compositions may suitably contain from 10 to 80%, preferably from 15 to 70% by weight, of detergency builder. Preferably, the quantity of builder is in the range of from 15 to 50% by weight.<br>
The detergent compositions may contain as builder a crystalline aluminosilicate, preferably an alkali metal aluminosilicate, more preferably a sodium aluminosilicate (zeolite).<br>
The zeolite used as a builder may be the commercially available zeolite A (zeolite 4A) now widely used in laundry detergent powders.  Alternatively, the zeolite may be maximum aluminium zeolite P (zeolite MAP) as described and claimed in EP 384 070B (Unilever), and commercially available as Doucil (Trade Mark) A24 from Crosfield Chemicals Ltd, UK.  Zeolite MAP is defined as an alkali metal aluminosilicate of zeolite P type having a silicon to aluminium ratio not exceeding 1.33, preferably within the range of from 0.90 to 1.33, preferably within the range of from 0.90 to 1.20.<br>

Preferred bleach precursors are peroxycarboxylic acid precursors, more especially peracetic acid precursors and peroxybenzoic acid precursors; and peroxycarbonic acid precursors.  An especially preferred bleach precursor suitable for use in the present invention is N,N,N',N'-tetracetyl ethylenediamine (TAED).  The novel quaternary ammonium and phosphonium bleach precursors disclosed in US 4 751 015 and US 4 818 426 (Lever Brothers Company) and EP 402 971A (Unilever) are also of great interest. Especially preferred are peroxycarbonic acid precursors, in particular cholyl-4-sulphophenyl carbonate.  Also of interest are peroxybenzoic acid precursors, in particular, N,N,N-trimethylammonium toluoyloxy benzene sulphonate;  and<br>
12<br><br>
the cationic bleach precursors disclosed in EP 284 292A and EP 303 520A (Kao).<br>
A bleach stabiliser (heavy metal sequestrant) may also be present.  Suitable bleach stabilisers include ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA) and the polyphosphonates such as Dequest (Trade Mark), EDTMP.<br>
The detergent compositions may also contain one or more enzymes.  Suitable enzymes include the proteases, amylases, cellulases, oxidases, peroxidases and lipases usable for incorporation in detergent compositions.<br>
Preferred proteolytic enzymes (proteases) are catalytically active protein materials which degrade or alter protein types of stains when present as in fabric stains in a hydrolysis reaction.  They may be of any suitable origin, such as vegetable, animal, bacterial or yeast origin. Proteolytic enzymes or proteases of various qualities and origins and having activity in various pH ranges of from 4-12 are available.  Proteases of both high and low isoelectric point are suitable.<br>
Other enzymes that may suitably be present include lipases, amylases, and cellulases including high-activity cellulases such as "Carezyme").<br>
In particulate detergent compositions, detergency enzymes are commonly employed in granular form in amounts of from about 0.1 to about 3.0 wt%.  However, any suitable physical form of enzyme may be used in any effective amount.<br>
13<br><br>
Antiredeposition agents, for example cellulose esters and ethers, for example sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, may also be present.<br>
The compositions may also contain soil release polymers, for example sulphonated and unsulphonated PET/POET polymers, both end-capped and non-end-capped, and polyethylene glycol/polyvinyl alcohol graft copolymers such as Sokolan (Trade Mark) HP22.<br>
Especially preferred soil release polymers are the sulphonated non-end-capped polyesters described and claimed in WO 95 32 997A (Rhodia Chimie).<br>
