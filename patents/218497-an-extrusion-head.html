				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to an extrusion head for producing a tubular parison for the manufacture of blow-molded plastic hollow bodies, including an adjustable ring-shaped tube outlet nozzle with annular nozzle/mandrel gap adjustment elements which permit a targeted adjustment of the nozzle gap for varying the wall thickness of the exiting parison.<br>
Typical examples of such blow-molded parts of thermoplastics, in which customarily a targeted wall thickness adjustment is carried out in longitudinal direction of the tube and in circumferential direction of the tube, include large-volume containers such as, for example, canisters, lidded drums, bung drums or inner receptacles for pallet containers. During ejection of the tubular parison used for such blow-molded parts, the wall thickness of the tube is so adjusted by a rotation-symmetrical nozzle/mandrel gap control mechanism in longitudinal direction of the tube that the wall is slightly thinner toward the lower end and slightly thicker toward the upper end in direction of the discharge valve, because the tube as a consequence of its own weight lengthens by itself when suspended to thereby automatically realize an even axial wall thickness. Superimposed thereto is a partial wall thickness control in circumferential direction which is realized by a double nozzle/mandrel gap control mechanism in the tube in those tube zones which are provided in the blow-molded hollow body for the head and bottom areas at greatly varying<br><br>
degrees of elongation - particularly in the areas which are offset by 90°to the partition plane of the blow mold halves.<br>
With double nozzle/mandrel gap control mechanisms (= two control choices) known heretofore, the wall thickness of such blow molded parts can be controlled over their length with respect to:<br>
-	uniform radial wall thickness<br>
-	radial and circumferential wall thickness<br><br>
-	radial wall thickness with axially extending thick and thin areas, and<br>
-	partial longitudinal thick/thin areas.<br>
Various constructions of extrusion heads are known for such tube adjustments by means of nozzle/mandrel gap control, for example from German Pat. No. 26 54 001, U.S. Pat. No. 3,114,932 or U.S. Pat. No. 1,107,628. Although for standard applications, simple conventional or the double nozzle control mechanisms suffice, they lack the capacity to carry out additional influences of the wall thickness.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to obviate the mentioned drawbacks and to improve the extrusion head of the type as described above with a double nozzle/mandrel gap control so as to permit a further superimposed wall thickness adjustment of the ejected tube - particularly for asymmetric technical parts such as e.g. plastic fuel tanks (KKB) or for special applications in cylindrical blow<br><br>
moded parts.<br>
This object Is attained In accordance with the Invention by providing at least three separate nozzle/mandrel gap adjustment elements (D 0 = mandrel, DS I, DS II, DS HI) which are separately controlled, differently profited, and adjustable, and which individually or/and simultaneously can be brought into active engagement in the nozzle gap with the exiting parison from inside and outside.<br>
Accordingly the invention provides an extrusion head for producing a tubular parison for the manufacture of blow-molded plastic hollow bodies, including an adjustable ring-shaped tube outlet nozzle with annular nozzle/mandrel gap adjustment elements which permit a targeted adjustment of the nozzle gap for varying the wall thickness of the exiting parison, characterized in that at least three separate nozzle/mandrel gap adjustment elements (D 0 = mandrel, DSI, DS n, DS III) which are separately controlled, differently profiled, and acljustable, and which individually or/and simultaneously can be brought into active engagement in the nozzle gap with the exiting parison from inside and outside.<br>
Since the tube outiet nozzle is equipped with a triple nozzle/mandrel gap control mechanism, special thick areas can be so adjusted at particular locations of the tube depending on the blow molded hollow body in dependence on the configuration of the third nozzle adjustment element, or further adjustment elements and on the duration of the intervention or impact on the extruded parison, that the f\ra\ blow molded hollow body e)diibits only in the desired wall regions different or thicker wall thickness in comparison to the minimum wall strength of the typical wail.<br>
A canister can, for example, be provided with stiffening ribs only at the vertical comer<br>
areas. In a KKB, the walls can also be made specifically thicker and thus more stable,<br>
e.g. in the side areas of the top bottom or at those areas at which connection stubs of<br>
fuel pipes are blow-moided thereon, or measuring instruments for a fuel tank level<br>
gauge are to be installed. In bung drums or	—	<br><br>
lidded drums, it is possible to adjust a ribbed wall construction with uniform thick-thin distribution only in the vertical wall areas through a targeted material redistribution while, for example, maintaining the existing drum weight, thereby measurably improving the stiffness of the container, and in particular, the stacking strength when charged with hot contents. Remarkably, the steps for quality improvement of the blow-molded hollow plastic body are realized exclusively on the exiting parison itself and not through constructive redesign of the blow mold.<br>
As shown by way of example only, the novel triple or multi-nozzle control system according to the invention results advantageously in a variety of new possibilities of application for blow-molded plastic parts of all types (e.g. also plastic toys, dolls, automobile accessories or the like).<br>
Compared to a conventional extrusion head with heretofore dual nozzle control mechanism, the provision of an extrusion head with the novel triple nozzle control system according to the invention can be realized comparably inexpensively and does not require any investment in machines. The adjustment elements are only moved over short distances, without experiencing deformation of the adjustment elements.<br>
The process according to the invention for producing blow-molded hollow plastic bodies by a blow mold machine with extruder, circumferential distnbutor<br><br>
and respective blow mold, and carrying out a particular adjustment of the wall thickness of the exiting parison during ejection of the tubular parison from the extrusion head of the circumferential distributor through adjustment of the extrusion nozzle, is characterized in particular by realizing any thick-thin adjustment of the tubular parison through a sequential or simultaneous impact of three differently profiled, separately adjustable extrusion nozzles ring parts.<br>

FIG. 1 shows an extrusion head 10 with fragmentary illustration of three adjustable adjustment elements D 0, DS I and DS II in the basic position "nozzle gap closed". Arranged centrally in the extrusion head 10 is an axially adjustable mandrel holder 12 with an underside which has secured thereon an easily<br><br>
detachable and exchangeable truncated cone shaped mandrel 14 as first adjustment element Dzero (= D 0). To the outside, the extrusion head is enclosed by a housing 16. Accommodated in the housing 16 is a hollow cylindrical storage space 18 in which the molten plastic material fed from one or several extruders has been circumferentially distributed. The storage space 18 ends in a circular ring-shaped nozzle gap 20 which is demarcated on the inside by the mandrel 14, and the first adjustment element D 0 and on the outside by a stationary nozzle ring part DF and two adjustable adjustment elements, namely the nozzle slide 1 = DS I and the nozzle slide 2= DS II. Like the adjustable mandrel 14, also the axially adjustable adjustment elements DS I and DS II are secured to the extrusion housing for easy detachment and exchange. The adjustment and exact positioning of the adjustable nozzle gap adjustment elements may be realized e.g. hydraulically or electromotorically. Furthermore, the housing-fixed nozzle ring part DF is likewise secured to the extrusion head in a manner that permits easy detachment and exchange.<br>
This is of particular importance in order to realize dunng a product change or replacement of the subsequent blow mold also a rapid exchange of the ring parts and adjustment elements of the nozzle gap, which are suited to the product at hand and accordingly profiled.<br>
In the extrusion head 10 shown in FIG. 1, all adjustment elements are returned to their basic position "nozzle gap closed", i.e. the mandrel D 0 has<br><br>
traveled to the uppermost position, and the nozzle slide = adjustment elements DS I and DS II have traveled to the lowermost position. The respective lengths of path = adjustability of the adjustment elements, are indicated by the respective arrows. In the illustrated exemplified embodiment, the nozzle gap defining surfaces of the fixed nozzle ring part DF and the adjustment element DS I are profiled, and the nozzle gap defining surfaces of the mandrel D 0 and of adjustment element DS II have smooth circumference, as further described with reference to the following Figures.<br>
In FIG. 2, only the mandrel 14 is slightly moved downwards (see arrow). The nozzle gap 20 is demarcated at the outside by the lower inner circumferentially smooth edge 24 of the nozzle slide DS II, and at the inside by the mandrel 14. The discharged tube 22 is evenly thin about its circumference. In the partial section of the tube 22, as illustrated therebelow, a small arrow indicates the potential thickness of the tube when the mandrel travels to the lowermost position and the nozzle gap is fully open.<br>
In FIG. 3, the adjustment element DS I together with the adjustment element DS II is slightly moved upwards (see arrow), so that these two adjustment elements are not in operative engagement at that point with the exiting tubular parison 22. The nozzle gap 20 is now demarcated by the mandrel 12 and the profiled housing-fixed ring part DF. The tube exiting the nozzle gap is no longer uniformly thick in circumferential direction, but is slightly<br><br>
thinner in two opposing regions than the respective tube regions respectively arranged offset by 90° thereto. Such an oval adjustment of the nozzle gap or oval wall thickness adjustment in areas of the tube is typical for blow molded parts with flat top plate and bottom plate, whereby, the two opposing tube sections 26 with greater wall thickness are so guided between the open blow mold halves that the horizontal container wall areas, which are offset by 90° to the mold partition plane, are blow-molded therefrom with the greatest stretching degrees of plastic material, This feature thus serves as a measure to attain a uniform wall thickness in the finished container, so that the container wall is not thinner in the corner areas with, high degrees of stretching or orientation in comparison to the remaining vertical wall parts.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a sectional view through the thinner tube area (and extrusion head) which bears in the blow mold in the mold partition plane upon the blow mold wall.<br>
FIG. 4 shows the same position of the nozzle slide DS I compared to FIG. 3, but at a 90° rotated section through the extrusion head and thus through a thicker wall zone 26 of the tube 22, as clearly illustrated by the partial sectional view through tube 22 therebelow. To the left, next to the profiled ring part DF, there is indicated a developed view of the known wavy profile of the inner nozzle surface of the ring part DF.<br><br>
In FIG. 5 and FIG. 6, the profiled nozzle slide DS I is moved downwards and acts on the exiting plastic tube, while the nozzle slide DS II still remains in its previous upper position outside a zone of influence. The profile of DS I includes a circumferential tooth profile, as clearly shown therebelow by the partial sectional illustrations of the exiting tube 22. The teeth 30 of the profile form a thinner tube wall thickness, and a greater tube wall thickness with outwardly projecting ribs is formed in the tooth gaps 32. FIG. 5 shows the section through the extrusion head and the tube 22 in the area of a thinner tube wail (tooth action 30), and FIG. 6 shows a slightly offset section in the area of a thicker tube wall (tooth gap action 32), with pronounced formation of longitudinal ribs 28. The profile in the fixed nozzle ring part DF, as well as in the nozzle slide DS may be expanded slantingly outwardly or simply parallel to the surface of the mandrel 14. FIG. 6 indicates by way of the small arrow below the nozzle guide DS II, the depth by which the teeth 30 of the tooth profile of the nozzle slide DS I are able to act on the tube 22 from outside. To the left of the nozzle slide DS I is a schematic illustration, in developed view, of the tooth profile of the DS I with teeth 30 and tooth gaps 32. In this embodiment, the lowermost non-profiled nozzle slide DS II, serves actually only as a smoothening element or to cover the profiles of the ring part DF or/and to cover the nozzle slide DS I.<br>
FIG. 7, FIG. 8 and FIG. 9 illustrate a modified embodiment of an extrusion head according to the invention, with the special profile (= tooth profile) formed on the nozzle slide DS II instead of on the nozzle slide DS I, while the nozzle<br><br>
slide DS I has a smooth circumferential surface in direction of the nozzle gap. In FIG. 7, both nozzle slides DS I and DS II are moved into their uppermost position (outside of zone of influence), and only the oval- profile of the housing-fixed ring part DF and the adjustable mandrel 14 act on the tube 22 in the nozzle gap 20. The small partial sectional views on the side indicate on the left a thinner tube wall thickness (in mold partition plane FT) and on the right a thicker tube wall thickness (90° with respect to the mold partition plane FT). In FIG. 8, both nozzle slides DS I and DS II are moved downwards. The DS I has a lower smooth circumference and covers the oval-profile of the fixed ring part DF, thereby rendering it ineffective. The tooth profile of the lower nozzle slide DS II acts in the nozzle gap 20 on the exiting tube 22 and produces the profiled tube formation with the longitudinal ribs 28, as illustrated in the small partial sectional illustration.<br>
FIG. 9 shows a positioning of the adjustment elements in which no profile is effective, but rather only a circumferentially even thickness change can be carried out by an axial displacement of the mandrel 14. In accordance with the wall thickness diagrams a, b, and c, as shown in the lower left hand side of FIG. 9, the control of adjustment elements D 0, DS I and DS II for adjusting a desired wall thickness over the length L of the exiting tube is effected at the blow form machine. Diagram a shows - as does the partial sectional view to the right of the ejected tube 22- an even increase of the wall thickness from bottom to top, by opening the nozzle gap 20 through axial displacement of mandrel 14 in downward direction. The added wall thickness for the top plate and bottom plate<br><br>
of the drum, as shown in diagram b, is realized by the oval profile in the fixed nozzle ring part DF which is cleared when the non-profiled and smooth nozzle slide DS I travels upward. At that point, the tooth profile nozzle slide DS I is hereby not effective. For adjustment of the tooth profile in the tube - e.g. for longitudinal ribs in the vertical wall region of the bung drum as shown to the right thereof - the nozzle slide DS II is moved downwards for active engagement, whereby also the nozzle slide DS I moves downwards, thereby covering again the profile of the fixed ring part DF. In order to maintain an even thickness of the tube, the mandrel 14 is also moved simultaneously slightly downwards, and the nozzle gap opened as needed. For clarification, it should be noted that the nozzle slide with the novel tooth profile of the nozzle slide realizes in general only a redistribution of the plastic material in the nozzle gap, whereby the free cross sectional area of the nozzle gap may remain constant.<br>
Another embodiment of an extrusion head according to the invention is shown in FIG. 10, whereby no profiled housing-fixed ring part is provided and the nozzle slide DS I is also not profiled but exhibits a circumferentially smooth inner surface towards the nozzle gap 20. The known oval profile is formed in the nozzle slide DS II, with an exchangeable mandrel 34 having a special configuration. At its outer circumference, the mandrel 34 is provided in direction of the nozzle gap 20 with a plurality of ribs 14* which are evenly spaced from one another in a star-shaped manner. Disposed at the lower end of the mandrel head 34 is the axially adjustable adjustment element D 0* which is provided<br><br>
exteriorly with correspondingly formed ribs extending upwardly and uniformly spaced from each other for precisely filling in flush engagement the intermediate spaces between the ribs 14* When the star-shaped slide = adjustment element D 0* occupies its uppermost basic position, the ribs of star-shaped slide D 0* extend in the nozzle gap 20 flush with the ribs 14* of the mandrel 34, so that a smooth conical surface is formed in the nozzle gap. In contrast thereto, when the star-shaped slide D 0* travels downwards, the intermediate spaces between the ribs of the mandrel head 34 are cleared and the stationary ribs 14* act in the nozzle gap on the exiting tube 22, thereby forming a tooth profile in the inner surface of the tube in dependence on the geometry of the ribs 14*. An up and down movement of the smooth non-profiled nozzle slide DS I allows, in general, an even adjustment of the wall thickness, while the oval profile of the tube is effected by the respectively profiled nozzle slide DS II, whereby the nozzle slide DS II travels into a lower position, with the minimum wall thickness of the tube being adjusted by the nozzle slide DS I. Then, DS II remains in position, and DS I travels slightly upwards, whereby the oval profile in DS II is cleared, and the tube is formed with respectively thicker walls in the two diametrically opposing zones. This construction of the extrusion head permits a best possible superimposed action of the various adjustment elements upon the tube.<br>
A further embodiment is shown in FIG. 11, illustrating a modification of the extrusion head shown in FIG. 6, with a ring sleeve as nozzle slide DS III being secured inside the nozzle head DS II for adjustment in circumferential direction.<br><br>
This ring sleeve = DS III has at its bottom side a same tooth profile as the nozzle slide DS I disposed on the inside. Additionally, the nozzle slide DS II is slightly slanted inwardly at the bottom. When downwardly moving the nozzle slide II together with ring sleeve DS III so as to be flush with the nozzle slide I, a rotation of the ring sleeve enables a covering or opening of the teeth of the nozzle slide DS I from the side. In this way, the formation of the rib width on the exiting tube 22 can be continuously modified or randomly adjusted. A simultaneous up and down movem^ent of the nozzle slide DS II together with the ring sleeve DS II also allows the height of the ribs 28 to be continuously modified and adjusted.<br>
Finally, FIG. 12, FIG. 13, FIG. 14 and FIG. 15 show a further advantageously configured extrusion head. The even wall thickness about the circumference is adjusted with the adjustment elements D 0 = mandrel 14. A profiled housing-fixed ring sleeve is not provided; however, if needed, may be provided for installing a further special profile. The nozzle slide DS I has the tooth profile and is provided with a greater stroke of its adjustment drive. Furthermore, the nozzle slide DS II is provided with the oval profile and of split configuration i.e. it is made in this case of two 180° half ring parts which are guided and secured on the nozzle slide DS I for displacement in radial direction. In FIG. 12, all adjustment elements have traveled into the basic position "nozzle slide dosed". In FIG. 13, the nozzle gap is opened, with mandrel 14 having traveled downwards. Likewise, the nozzle slide DS I together with DS II have traveled axially downwards, with the attached nozzle slide DS II acting with its oval profile<br><br>
in the nozzle gap 20 on the exiting tube. In FIG. 14, both half ring parts of the nozzle slide DS II have traveled radially outwards and are no longer in an active engagement. As shown in FIG. 15, the nozzle slide DS I is now slightly moved further downwards until its tooth profile or special profile is in active engagement. The advantage of this construction is the need for only a single lifting drive for the nozzle slides DS I and DS II. The short radial movement of the DS II - half rings could be realized, for example, by an electric spindle motor or a respective small drive. This configuration is suited e.g. particularly for retrofitting existing extrusion heads.<br>
The adjustment elements of all embodiments are basically attached to the extrusion head in an easily exchangeable manner. The nozzle slide with the tooth profile may certainly also be modified depending on the desired profile requirement of the hollow body to be blow-molded (cf. FIGS. 19, 20).<br>
FIG. 16 illustrates a 220 liter lidded drum 36 having longitudinal ribs which are formed in the vertical wall zones and evenly spaced from one another but which do not extend into the bottom region, as shown in the sketched partial sectional illustration below with constant drum wall thickness.<br>
Exemplified embodiment: A 220 I plastic bung drum with a drum weight of approximately 9 kg has a largest diameter in the drum wall of about 585 mm. The tubular parison exiting the nozzle gap has a diameter of about 270 mm with a<br><br>
wall thickness of about 12 to 25 mm. By means of the adjustment elements, the wall thickness of the tube can be adjusted partially or along sections in this thickness range or adjusted in even greater range.<br>
FIG. 17 shows a fassett 38 in which only the vertical wall zones are reinforced by longitudinal ribs. This longitudinal ribbing is clearly illustrated in the partial sectional illustration through the container wall.<br>
FIG. 18 shows a canister 40 formed only in the corner regions with two longitudinal ribs which extend, however, to the top plate and bottom plate, as indicated in the partial sectional view below. A longitudinal and cross-sectional view of a tubular parison 22 with special profile for a plastic fuel tank KKB 42 is shown in FIG. 19, with FIG. 20 showing flash pieces still attached thereto.<br>
The extrusion head according to the invention with three separate adjustment systems is particularly suitable to fabricate and produce such special profiles with partial material accumulation (cf. section B-B in FIG. 19) as required for KKB 42 in the area of a stub opening (cf. section D-D in FIG. 20).<br><br><br><br><br>
