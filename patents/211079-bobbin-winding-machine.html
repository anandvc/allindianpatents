This application claims the benefit of German patent application No. 19962296.5, filed<br>
December 23,1999, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a bobbin winding machine with multiple winding heads,<br>
each of which includes a creel associated with a torque transmitter for controlling the bearing<br>
load between a bobbin held in the creel and a driving drum, which torque transmitter can be<br>
adjusted by a drive element controlled by a winding-head computer connected to transmitters that<br>
detect the speed of the bobbin and the speed of the drive drum.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a bobbin winding machine of the above-described type in which the creels are provided<br>
with a device corresponding to German Patent Publication Dli 19 817 363 At the bearing load<br>
between the bobbin and the drive drum is exactly controlled over the entire course of bobbin<br>
winding. The bearing load is comprised of the combined weight of the bobbin and the creel<br>
together with the force resulting from the torque applied by the torque transmitter. The winding-<br>
head computer is connected to transmitters that detect the speed of the drive drum and the speed<br>
of the cross-wound bobbin, All moments that act on the creel can be calculated tlrom these<br>
values, taking into consideration the density of the bobbin determined by the yarn tension and the<br>
yam count. The bobbin control can then regulate the torque transmitter by regulating the drive<br>
element such that the desired bearing load or the desired course of the bearing load is exactly<br>
maintained.<br>
Tt can occur during the operation of such a bobbin winding machine, especially during a<br>
batch change, that bobbins that are not yet entirely completed, i.e., so-called residual bobbins, are<br>
removed from a winding head and set into the creel of another winding head in order to be<br>
finished thereat. It can also occur at the end of a batch that a few winding heads are already<br>
turned off without the bobbins located therein having attained their full diameter. These residual<br>
bobbins are then removed and placed into the remaining winding heads which are still operating<br>
in order to be finished therein. As a rule, residual bobbins are also produced at the start of a new<br>
batch since the user makes attempts in mis phase with different cross-wound bobbin diameters,<br>
correction factors, etc., to achieve a bobbin that is optimal tor the current application. It is<br>
likewise important in adjusting of the automatic bobbin changer to present several full bobbins to<br>
a winding head in order to adjust the bobbin changing device with these full bobbins.<br>
Problems can result with the processing of residual bobbins in bobbin winding machines<br>
of the above-described type. On the one hand, the bearing load between the bobbin and the drive<br>
drum is not correct. On the other hand, it is hardly possible to replace an empty tube with a<br>
larger bobbin since the creel has been automatically brought into the position associated with an<br>
empty bobbin tube. In order to be able to operate in an exact manner, the diameter and the<br>
amount of wound-on yarn of a residual bobbin would have to be entered into the winding-head<br>
control in order to suitably adjust the position of the creel for this residual bobbin. However, this<br>
is not practical because, on one hand, these values are usually not known and, on the other hand,<br>
there is also no possibility at the individual winding heads of entering this data.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention therefore has the objective of developing a bobbin winding<br>
machine of the initially mentioned type in such a manner that the processing of residual bobbins<br>
does not pose any problems, that is, that even residual bobbins with a fairly large diameter<br>
instead of empty tubes can be placed into a creel and thereafter the bearing load between bobbin<br>
and drive drum corresponds at least approximately to the desired course of winding.<br>
This problem is addressed by providing means that can be actuated by an operator for<br>
adjusting the drive element and therewith the creel for adaptation to the diameter of the residual<br>
bobbin inserted into the creel. The winding head computer calculates the torque to be applied by<br>
the torque transmitter using information representing the density of the residual bobbin and<br>
information resulting from the adaptation to the diameter of the residual bobbin about the<br>
position of the creel before the start of the winding process and controls its drive clement<br>
accordingly.<br>
In this manner, it is possible for the operator to move the creel into a position that is<br>
suitable for the residual bobbin to be inserted, that is, that corresponds at least approximately to<br>
its diameter. From this position, the required bearing load is calculated within certain<br>
permissible tolerances and, given when the winding head is put in operation, taking into<br>
consideration the bobbin density that is known at least to the central computer of the bobbin<br>
winding machine and transmitted to the winding head computer. After the winding head has<br>
started to run, the winding head computer then calculates, based on the bobbin speed that is now<br>
detected in relationship to the speed of the drive drum, the precise bobbin diameter and exactly<br>
calculates the weight via the density of the bobbin so that the bearing load is exactly determined<br>
thereafter.<br>
A position of the creel that substantially corresponds exactly to the diameter of the<br>
residual bobbin can be brought up in an automatic manner with an ernbodimem of the bobbin<br>
winding machine in which the winding-head computer is set such that, alter actuation of the<br><br>
afore-described adjusting means, a lifting of the creel initially takes place and at the slarl of the<br>
lowering process of the creel, the drive drum is put into a rotary motion at a low speed. At the<br>
start of a detected rotation of the residual bobbin brought about by the drive drum, a control<br>
signal is generated that controls the end of the adjusting process for the adaptation to ihe diameter<br>
of the residual bobbin and also inmates the ending of the low speed rotary motion of the drive<br>
drum. The speed is advantageously set in such a manner that the surface velocity of the drive<br>
drum is approximately 50 m/min, which prevents damaging of the residual bobbin.<br>
Further features and advantages of the invention will be understood from the following<br>
description of an exemplary embodiment shown in the accompanying drawing.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWlNG<br>
The drawing is a schematic view of a portion of a winding head of a multi-head bobbin<br>
winding machine in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring now to the accompanying drawing, a yam is drawn from a spinning bobbin (not<br>
shown) at each winding head of a bobbin winding machine and wound onto a conical or<br>
cylindrical cross-wound bobbin 10, sometimes referred to as a cheese, Cross-wound bobbin 10<br>
comprises a central interior bobbin tube onto which the yarn or thread is wound. Cross-wound<br>
bobbin 10 is held between two conical end plates 11 of a creel 12 by their clamping engagement<br>
with the opposite ends of the bobbin tube. Creel 12 is pivotably supported in a machine frame by<br>
shaft 13.<br>
Cross-wound bobbin 10 rests on drive drum 14, that is provided with a reversing thread<br>
which effects the crossing placement of the yarn running onto cross-wound bobbin 10. Drive<br>
drum 14 is driven by an electromotor (not shown) and, in turn, this drum drives cross-wound<br>
bobbin 10 by surface friction.<br>
The bearing load between cross-wound bobbin 10 and drive drum 14 is controlled over<br>
the entire course of bobbin winding, that is, from the start of the winding of an empty bobbin<br>
tube set into creel 12 to the completion of cross-wound bobbin 10 with a given final diameter<br>
and/or given final weight.<br>
The bearing load between cross-wound bobbin 10 and drive drum 14 is comprised of a<br>
weight component of cross-wound bobbin 10, a weight component of creel 12 and a torque<br>
applied by torque transmitter 15 onto shaft 13 of creel 12. The torque of torque transmitter 15 is<br>
adjusted by means of adjusting element 16, in particular by a stepping motor. Torque transmitter<br>
15 and adjusting element 16 ore designed, e.g., according to German Patent Publication DE 19<br>
817 363 Al. The position of drive element 16 and therewith the torque of torque transmitter 15<br>
and finally the bearing load between cross-wound bobbin 10 and drive drum 14 are controlled by<br>
winding head computer 17. The winding head computer 17 is connected to a speed transmitter<br>
that enters the speed of drive drum 14 into the winding head computer. Furthermore, a speed<br>
transmitter is connected to winding head computer 17 which transmitter detects the drive speed<br>
of cross-wound bobbin 10 or of clamping end plate 11 rotating at the same speed. Based on this<br>
data, winding head computer 17 calculates the instantaneous diameter of cross-wound bobbin 10.<br>
In addition, further external data is entered into winding head computer 17, especially a<br>
yarn tension adjusted during winding and/or the yam count, so lhat winding head computer 17<br>
can not only calculate the instantaneous diameter of cross-wound bobbin 10 but also the wound<br>
yam length and the weight of cross-wound bobbin 10. Then, the torque to be applied by torque<br>
transmitter 15 is calculated with the aid of this data and drive element 16 is appropriately<br>
adjusted to produce this calculated torque. It is possible in this manner to exactly control the<br>
bearing load between cross-wound bobbin 10 and drive drum 14 over the entire course of bobbin<br>
winding, that is, from the start of the winding of an empty bobbin tube to the completion of the<br>
cross-wound bobbin with a given diameter and/or a given weight. Bobbins with a very uniform<br>
density can be produced in this manner. The density can be detected and stored, e.g., in winding<br>
head computer 17.<br>
It repeatedly occurs during the operation of a bobbin winding machine that partially<br>
wound cross-wound bobbins 10 have to be placed into creel 12 of a winding head. The winding<br>
head shown is designed in such a manner that such is possible in an uncomplicated manner and<br>
that even thereafter the work is carried out with a given bearing load between cross-wound<br>
bobbin 10 and drive drum 14 right at the start of the winding process.<br>
Buttons 18, 19 are provided on the winding head that arc connected to winding-head<br>
control 17. When these buttons are actuated, drive element 16 can be engaged via winding head<br>
computer 17 in such a manner that it pivots creel 12 via torque transmitter 15. If, for example, a<br>
rather small residual bobbin is to be inserted after a whole cross-wound bobbin 10 has been<br>
removed from creel 12, this residual bobbin can be inserted into creel 12. Creel 12 is then<br>
lowered by actuating button 18 or 19 until the residual bobbin rests on the circumference of drive<br>
drum 14. Winding head computer 17 receives information about the diameter of the inserted<br>
residual bobbing from the path traveld by drive element 16 usinging the information about the yarn<br>
count, the density and/or the winding tension, computer 17 can approximately calculate the<br>
weight of the residual bobbing and therewith also the additional loading by torque transmitter 15<br>
required to obtain the desired bearing load. Winding head computer 17 then adjusts drive<br>
element 16 of torque transmitter 15 accordingly, so that the desired bearing force is at least<br>
approximately adjusted before the starting of the winding head.<br>
A similar course of operation results if, e.g., instead of an empty bobbin tube an almost<br>
full residual bobbin is inserted, for which creel 12 must first be pivoted sufficiently upwardly by<br>
actuating button 18 or 19 that the residual bobbin can be inserted. The operator then pivots creel<br>
12 with the inserted residual bobbin downwardly in the reverse direction by actuating button 18<br>
or 19 until this bobbin rests on drive drum 14. Even in this instance, windingjusad computer 17<br>
has information available about the diameter of the residual bobbin on account of the path of<br>
drive element 16.<br>
After the actuation of button 18 or 19, the pivoting up of creel 12 and the insertion of the<br>
residual bobbin by the operator, a rotary motion of drive drum 14 is brought about at a low speed<br>
by winding head computer 17 at the start of the lowering process of creel 12. The adjusted speed<br>
corresponds to a surface velocity of drive drum 14 of approximately 50 m/min. After sufficient<br>
contact has been established between drive drum 14 and the residual bobbin by the lowering of<br>
creel 12, the residual bobbin begins to rotate by means of friction. The start of factional contact<br>
between the residual bobbin and drive drum 14 can be detected or visually recognized exactly by<br>
the start of the rotation of the residual bobbin. The diameter of the residual bobbin can be<br>
exactly determined with the beginning of the rotary motion. A control signal can be obtained by<br>
the detection of this rotary motion of the residual bobbin or of bobbin clamping plates 11 starting<br>
at the same speed with a speed transmitter and the extent of the adjusting process of creel 12 can<br>
be controlled. by winding, head computer 17 in such a manner that the position of creel 12 is<br>
precisely adapted to the diameter of the residual bobbin. The presence of the control signal<br>
indicating the start of the rotation of the residual bobbin initiates the ending of the rotary motion<br>
of drive drum 14 at a low speed. Thus, the adjusting process can be automated.<br>
For reasons of presentation, buttons 18 and 19 are associated with the winding head in the<br>
exemplary embodiment. They can of course also be provided in a practical machine on the<br>
central input unit of the machine control by means of which each individual winding head can be<br>
addressed. Individual buttons for actuating drive element 16 or for initiating the pivoting process<br>
or key combinations can then be provided in the input unit for this actuation.<br>
Information about the density as well as about the yarn tension during winding, that<br>
decisively determines the density of cross-wound bobbin 10, can be retrieved from the central<br>
control of the bobbin winding machine for the calculations. However, this information can also<br>
be tiled in a memory of winding head computer 17 and retrieved therefrom as required.<br>
It will therefore be readily understood by those persons skilled in the art that the present<br>
invention is susceptible of broad utility and application. Many embodiments and adaptations of<br>
the present invention other than those herein described, as well os many variations, modifications<br>
and equivalent arrangements, will be apparent from or reasonably suggested by the present<br><br>
invention and the foregoing description thereof, without departing from the substance or scope of<br>
the present invention. Accordingly, while the present invention has been described herein in<br>
detail in relation to its preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that this disclosure is only<br>
illustrative and exemplary of the present invention and is made merely for purposes of providing<br>
a full and enabling disclosure of the invention. The foregoing disclosure is not intended or to be<br>

adaptations, variations, modifications and equivalent arrangements, the present invention being<br>
limited only by the claims appended hereto and the equivalents thereof.<br>
