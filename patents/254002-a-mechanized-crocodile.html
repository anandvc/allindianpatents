				<td>This invention relates to a mechanized crocodile. The mechanized crocodile of the present invention has a direct relevance to the scientific and technology museums, amusement parks, educational institutions and entertainment of visitors and demonstration of the different limb movements of a crocodile. This invention particularly relates to integrated mechanical systems comprising different mechanisms for the actuation of the limbs along with the structures of the unit to resemble the movements of the limbs of a crocodile and proper mounting of the actuation systems. The mechanisms, actuated by separate electric motors, move the limbs of the mechanized crocodile in the similar manner of a real crocodile.<br>
Such animated units of different animals are popular in different countries as exhibits in public places. Depending on the requirements and actuating systems, the mechanical systems of the unit are designed to resemble the motions of the live animal as close as possible.<br>
The existing units are of different sizes. The range of motions differs in different units in accordance with the requirements. In most of the units, limited motions of one or two parts are provided. The mechanisms to impart motions are normally integrated with one another so that one prime mover moves different parts in a combined manner. The prime movers, used in the existing units, include springs, electric motors, pneumatic drives etc.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a mechanized crocodile. Another objective of the present invention is to provide mechanical systems on a suitable structure for operation with electric motors for the movement of the limbs of proportionate sizes. Yet Another objective is to provide mechanical systems of the present invention which are suitable for the following motions,<br>
i) jaw open/close<br>
i i) neck up/down<br>
iii) neck left/right<br>
iv) breathing<br>
v) crawling<br>
vi) tail wagging. of a mechanized crocodile in the similar manner of a live crocodile with proportional sizes of each part of the body.<br>
In figs 1 to 3 of the drawings accompanying the specifications the various parts of the mechanized crocodile are depicted.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the various parts as assembled of the mechanized crocodile.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the side view of the breathing mechanism.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the top view of the mechanism used for tail wagging.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a mechanized crocodile which comprises a neck unit having an upper jaw (1) and a lower jaw (2) connected by means (hinge-3, connecting link-4, &amp; motion transmission slider-5) in such a manner so as to provide opening and closing of the said jaws (1,2) and vertical &amp; horizontal motion of the neck (6,7 &amp; 11), the said jaws and the neck being connected by means (flexible links-8,9 &amp; 10) to a plurality of prime movers (M1, M2, M3), located in the middle unit, the said middle unit also being provided with a breathing mechanism which consists of a prime mover (M4) connected by means (breathing motion output link-25, breathing plate link-26, connecting link-27) to two side plates (28) in such a manner so as to provide horizontal movements of the said side plates (28), the middle unit also consists of another prime mover (M5) connected by means (shafts-12,13 &amp;16, differential gear box-17, input shaft-18, crawling power link-19, rigid coupler-20, cranks21 &amp; 22) to two pairs of legs (23,24) and two pairs of wheels (14,15) in such a manner so as to provide crawling motion, the middle unit also consists of yet another prime mover (M6) which is connected to the tail assembly (29,30,31,32,33) in such a manner to provide a 'S' shaped motion to the tail.<br>
The prime movers used may be electric motors, preferably motors capable of providing linear reciprocating motions. The detail description of the mechanized crocodile of the present invention is given below.<br>
The overall body of the crocodile with all the mechanical systems is shown in fig. 1. It comprises of three major parts, viz., check unit (A), middle unit (B) and tail unit (C). The overall sizes and shapes are of proportional dimensions as of a live crocodile. The same is made in a manner suitable for mounting various mechanisms and taking the outer cover around it properly. The neck unit (A) comprises of two jaws (1 &amp; 2) which can be moved around a hinge (3). The jaws are actuated by a mechanism consisting of parts (4) and a sliding part (5) so that the jaws can be opened and closed simultaneously by one motor. During motion, the lower jaw opens less than the upper jaw. The jaws can be moved up and down around (6). They also can be moved from left to right or vice versa around (7). Each motion is actuated by electric motors, mounted on the middle unit through flexible links (8, 9 &amp; 10). The flexible links are attached to suitable locations for smooth movements and the desired range of motion. This unit is connected to the middle unit (B). The springs (11), attached between the middle unit and the neck unit are provided for smooth movement of the neck unit both during upward and downward motion. The present invention, thus, allows smooth motions of the neck unit by individual and combined operations of the motors.<br>
The middle portion of the unit (B) comprises of all the electric motors, four legs, wheels for crawling motion, breathing unit and related mechanisms for movement of the legs and the breathing unit. In the present invention, wiper motors, normally used in vehicles, have been used because they are of small sizes with the provision of linear actuating motions. Special attachments have been made to the motors, wherever required to actuate any mechanism.<br>
The motors (Ml, M2, M3, M4, M5, &amp; M6) are mounted at suitable locations on the middle unit, as shown in fig. 1. The flexible link of motor (Ml) is connected to jaw unit for closing and opening of the jaws. The flexible link of motor (M2) is connected to neck unit for its up and down movement. The flexible link of motor (M3) is connected to neck unit for sideways moti on. The flexible link of motor (M6) is connected to the tail unit for its movement.<br>
The breathing unit, shown in fig. 2, is located at the middle unit. The motor (M4) is used for the actuation of the breathing unit. The unit is operated by a mechanism which transmits the linear reciprocating motion of a part (25) to two linear reciprocating motions of two parts (26) in perpendicular directions. The breathing plates (28) are connected to the links for their reciprocating motions similar to the breathing motions of a crocodile. The rigid part (25) is attached to the motor for smooth functioning of the unit.<br>
The present invention, thus, involves a mechanism for simulation of the motion of the middle portion of a crocodile during breathing in an efficient manner.<br>
The crawling motion of the crocodile is provided by rolling the complete unit on four wheels. Simultaneously, the legs are moved in synchronization for simulation of the motions of the legs in a manner similar to that of a crocodile. Two front legs (23) and two hind legs (24) are attached to two shafts (12 &amp; 13), as shown in Fig. 1. Two wheels (14) are mounted at the front end of the middle unit at a suitable location. They are free running wheels and can be swung around the vertical axes. Two rear wheels (15) are mounted on shafts (16) which are connected to the output shafts of a small differential gear box (17). The shafts are mounted at the rear end of the middle unit on a suitable location of the frame. The input shaft (18) of the differential gear box is connected to the motor (M5). The crawling motion of the crocodile unit, hence, is achieved by actuating the motor (M5) which leads to rolling motion of the unit along two guide channels along with simultaneous movements of four legs in proper sequence for the simulation of the crawling motion of a live crocodile. Because of the introduction of the differential gear box for driving the rear wheels and castor wheels at the front, the unit can be moved along any curved path smoothly. The linear reciprocating motion of rigid link of the motor (M5) is transmitted through a rigid member (19) to a rigid link (20) which is connected to two link mechanisms. In these* mechanisms the linear reciprocating motions of link (20) is converted to rotary reciprocating motions of two cranks (21 &amp; 22).<br>
The cranks are connected to the slides in such a manner that the shafts (12 &amp; 13) with the legs are reciprocated in sequence similar to that of the legs of a crocodile. In this mechanism, attachments have been made to the motor to achieve both linear and rotary motions at the ends of two shafts simultaneously. The present invention, thus, provides a mechanism for actuating the legs in proper sequences along with the movement of the crocodile by actuating one motor only.<br>
The mechanical system for the movement of the tail unit (C) in the present invention is unique in nature. The unit, as shown in fig. 3, comprises of 10 flat plates (29) of proportionate dimensions and shapes. They are connected together by links (30) and hinges (31) so that each plate can swing around the corresponding hinges. The flexible strings (33) are connected between plates to move the plates in different manners while motion is imparted on one plate.<br>
The unit is divided in three sections (D,E &amp; F). The first section is connected to the middle unit and is actuated by a flexible link (31) with linear reciprocating motion. The strings are connected between different plates in the manner suitable for the movement of the tail in the form of 'S'. While the first section moves in one direction, the second section moves in the opposite direction. The third section, being rigidly connected to the second section, moves in the same direction of the second section.<br>
The present invention, thus, provides a motion of the tail in the form of the English alphabet "S" by actuating one motor. This shape resembles the shape of the tail of a crocodile during its wagging. The present invention also allows locating the electric motor on the middle unit and thus reduces power consumption, the use of light weight flexible tail and improved stability of the unit.<br>
ADVANTAGES :<br>
The motors may be operated individually or simultaneously through manual switches or through a programmable controller.<br>
The present invention provides "a mechanism to move the legs of the animated crocodile in proper sequence in addition to rolling motion of the unit by actuating one motor only.<br>
The present invention allows mounting of the motors on the middle unit for proper power transmission, low power consumption and better stability of the unit.<br>
