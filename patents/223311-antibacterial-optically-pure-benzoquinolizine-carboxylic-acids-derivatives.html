Antibacterial    Optically   Pure   Benzoquinolizine    Carboxylic   Acids, Processes, Compositions And Methods of Treatment<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to optically pure S-(-)-benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof, substantially free of their R-(+)-isomers, to processes for preparation of the optically pure S-(-)-benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof substantially free of their R-(+)-isomers, and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the S(-)-benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof. These compounds and compositions can be used to systemically and topically treat bacterial Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic infections, specially resistant Gram-positive organism infections, Gram-negative organism infections, mycobacterial infections and emerging nosocomial pathogen infections, while avoiding toxic effects associated with the administration of the racemic mixture of RS-(±)-benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid. The compounds and compositions of this invention can also be used to treat diseases and disorders caused by Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, and diseases and disorders caused by resistant Gram-positive organisms, Gram-negative organisms, mycobacteria and nosocomial pathogens.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is an increasingly recurrent phenomenon. Of grave concern has been the development of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant Streptococcus epidermidis ( MRSE) strains, which because of the phenomenon of cross-resistance, are now also resistant to the larger class of P-lactam antibiotics including the cephalosporins and carbapenenis. Of even graver concern is the development of resistance in MRSA strains against the class of antibacterial agents known as fluoroquinolones. Several reports are known of MRSA strains   displaying   resistance   to   fluoroquinolone   agents   such   as   ciprofloxacin,<br><br>
sparfloxacin and even the more recently introduced trovafloxacin.    In addition, for<br>
trovafloxacin and for newer introductions like grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and<br>
gatifloxacin, a concern has been expressed about their chequered safety records. The<br>
use of trovafloxacin has been suspended or severely curtailed because of its association<br>
with liver side effects.   Grepafloxacin was withdrawn worldwide because of severe<br>
cardiovascular side effects. The labelling on gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin warns that<br>
they may prolong the QTc interval on electrocardiograms in some patients. The last<br>
line of defence against such fluoroquinolone-resistant MRSA strains is the class of<br>
glycopeptide   antibiotics   represented   by   vancomycin   and   teicoplanin.      These<br>
glycopeptide antibiotics are, however, laden with several limitations.   Vancomycin is<br>
encumbered with lack of oral bioavailability, nephrotoxic potential, toxic effects such<br>
as phlebitis and red-men syndrome.   Moreover, the recent disturbing wide spread<br>
emergence of Vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) followed by the alarming<br>
reports of Vancomycin intermediate resistance Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) strains<br>
from Japan and USA have cast a shadow over the future of glycoside antibiotics in<br>
clinical practice. In time, there is a relatively wide-spread emergence of staphylococci,<br>
enterococci, pneumococci and streptococci, which have become resistant to currently<br>
used first-and second-line antibacterial agents such as penicillin, oxacillin, vancomycin<br>
and erythromycin (SENTRY Programme : Antimicrobial Agents &amp; Chemotherapy 42<br>
1762-1770,1998).<br>
Also, for primary skin infections such as impetigo and folliculitis, and for secondary infections in humans such as infected dermatitis, wounds and burns, as well as to eliminate nasal carriage of MRSA in healthcare workers and patients, a special antibiotic used topically is Mupirocin. Mupirocin has high in vitro anti-staphylococcal and anti-streptococcal activity. There has, however, been an increase of organisms, specially staphylococci, developing resistance to Mupirocin. The emergence of Mupirocin-resistant Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in infected patients in different countries like Canada, Western Australia, UK, Spain and Switzerland is described in different references in the medical and scientific literature<br><br><br>
viz. J. Hosp. Infect. 39(1), 19-26 (1998); J.Hosp. Infect. 26(3),157-165 (1994); Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 17(2), 811-813 (1996); 38th Annual ICAAC Abstract C-75, 90 (1998); 38th ICAAC Abstract 12-25,507 (1998).<br>
Furthermore, Gram-positive pathogens such as staphylococi, enterococci and Gram-negative pathogens E.coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Serratia, Citrobacter and Pseudomonas, frequently encountered in urinary tract infections are susceptible to the known fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin. The potency of these fluoroquinolones, however, markedly deteriorates under the acidic conditions likely to be encountered in urinary tract infections, rendering them inadequate.<br>
Furthermore, multidrug-reistant (MDR) mycobacterial strains have emerged displaying resistance to first-line antimycobacterial agents such as rifampicin, pyrazinamide and INH etc. thus severely curtailing therapeutic options available for the management of infections due to such strains. Usually, the antimycobacterial drug regimen involves treatment spread over several months, and hence the drug has to be tolerated well by the patients. Among the fluoroquinolone antibiotics, sparfloxacin is reported to be highly active against mycobacteria. It is not quite suitable, however, for long-term therapy because of its potential to cause phototoxic side effects in humans and laboratory animals such as mice and guinea-pigs.<br>
Furthermore, in the worldwide management of nosocomial infections, besides the problematic strains of staphylococci and enterococci, including MRSA, strains of Chryseobacteria have recently emerged as new members of nosocomial pathogens causing neonatal meningitis and pneumonia, as well as sepsis, in immuno-compromised patients being treated in intensive care units. Chryseobacteria are intrinsically resistant to BO-Iactam antibiotics including third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems.  These factors reduce the treatment options available to the clinicians.<br>
The highly pressing need for other agents and methods of treatment for infections arising<br><br><br>
from such emerging resistant microorganisms, Gram-negative pathogens in acidic environments, mycobacteria and nosocomial pathogens thus assumes great significance.<br>
Among other agents,  one particular class  of compounds  the  benzoqumolizine carboxylic acid are of particular relevance.    Nadifloxacin is an example of a benzoqumolizine   carboxylic   acid.   Nadifloxacin   is   racemic    [(±)-9-fluoro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-6,7-dihydro-l-oxo-lH-5H-benzo      [i,J]quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid and is disclosed in JP Patent No. 58,90,511  and US Patent No. 4,399,134. Nadifloxacin has an asymmetric carbon atom at the 5-position thereof. RS-(±)-Nadifloxacin comprises two optically active isomers. In describing an optically kactive compound, the prefixes R and S or D and L are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral centre(s). The prefixes (+) and (-) or d and 1 are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (-) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory.   A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. Compounds having a single chiral centre exist as a pair of enantiomers, which are identical except that they are non-superimposable mirror images of one another. A one-to-one mixture of enantiomers is often referred to as a racemic mixture.  Racemic RS-(±)-Nadifloxacin derives its biological activity primarily from the S-(-)-enantiomer. The optically active S-(-)-Nadifloxacin [Α]20D = -312.0 is obtained as disclosed in Chem. Pharm. Bull 44 (1996), page nos. 642-5 and Jpn. Kokai Tokyo Koho JP 63,192,753. The optically active R-(+)-Nadifloxacin, [α]20D * +312.0,  is obtained  as  disclosed  in  Jpn.Kokai  Tokyo  Koho JP  63,192,753. Pharmaceutical compositions of RS-(±)-Nadifloxacin are disclosed in US Patent No. 4^399,134 and US Patent No. 4,552,879. Although  these cited patents  disclose compositions of RS-(±)-Nadifloxacin for oral, parenteral and topical use, the only commercial  product  containing  RS-(±)-Nadifloxacin   as   an   active  antibacterial compound is the commercial product named Acuatim®.  Acuatim® is available as a cream and a lotion and incorporates racemic RS-(±)-Nadifloxacin as 1% of its composition for the topical treatment of acne. Acuatim® has several drawbacks. It is intended only for topical use and is registered only for the treatment of acne caused by Propionibacterium species.   One report has appeared on the in-vitro activity of the fluoroquinolone, Nadifloxacin, against methicillin resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus from patients with skin infections (see<br><br><br>
Nishijima et al., Drugs 49 (Suppl.) 230-232, 1995). There is no report of RS-(±)-Nadifloxacin being approved for systemic use against any microbial infections, whether for sensitive or resistant microbial strains.<br>
S-(-)-Nadifloxacin is reported in Chem. Pharm, Bull 44 (1996) pages Nos. 421-423 to be approximtely twice as active in-vitro as racemic Nadifloxacin against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. There is no previous report, however, of the activity of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin in in-vivo systems against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, anaerobes, mycobacteria and emerging nosocomial pathogens.<br>
RS-(±)-Nadifloxacin is reported to exist in two crystalline forms, one as an anhydrate and the other as a hemihydrate (M. Kido and K. Hashimoto, Chem. Pharm. Bull, 42, 872 (1994)). There is no previous report, however, of any hydrate forms of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin, although a non-hydrate form is reported (K. Hashimioto et al.,Chem. Pharm. Bull., 44,642 (1996)).<br>
There is no previous report of the utility of optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof of the invention in pharmaceutical compositions. There is also no previous report of the systemic or topical use of optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts and hydrates thereof of the invention, either alone or in compositions for treatment of microbial infections diseases or disorders.<br>
Our pending PCT patent application No. PCT/IN99/00016 filed on May 7, 1999 describes optically pure and racemic benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, derivatives and salts thereof for treatment of infections caused by Mupirocin-resistant bacterial strains such as Mupirocin-resistant staphylococci, Mupirocin-resistant streptococci and other Mupirocin-resistant Gram-positive and Mupirocin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, and for treatment of dermal diseases such as impetigo, folliculitis, infected dermatitis, wounds and burns. The subject matter of PCT application PCT/IN99/00016 is incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventors obtained optically pure isomers of Nadifloxacin and have conducted extensive studies to show that:<br>
1. S-(-)-Nadifloxacin is found to exist not only as an anhydrate but also as three new different hydrates designated as S-(-)-Nadifloxacm.nH20, wherein n is equal to 0.2, 0.5 or 0.75. Among these forms of the anhydrate and the three hydrates, S-Nadifloxacin.0.2 H20 is now specifically found to be preferred as a stable, non-hygroscopic crystalline modification which is distinguished by an increased stability, neither losing the water content therein nor absorbing moisture over a wide range of ambient relative humidity conditions. In contrast, moisture absorption by the anhydrate varies according to its method of preparation and the relative humidity conditions to which it is subjected. The other two hydrates, viz. the hemihydrate, S-(-)-Nadifloxacin.0.5H2O and the hemisesquihydrate, S-Nadifloxacin.0.75H2O, both revert to S-nadifloxacin.0.2H2O when dried in vacuo at ambient temperature conditions.<br>
S-(-)-Nadifloxacin.0.2H2O has considerable advantages over the anhydrate, the hemihydrate and the hemisesquihydrate in storage and handling and in the preparation of medicament forms. In particular, specially in tropical and subtropical climates, where the ambient humidity is usually greater than 70%, difficulty is encountered in the storage and handling of the anhydrate. In the preparation of pharmaceutical preparations, such as tablets, containing the anhydrate, the operations must be carried out with attention to absorption or desorption of water of crystallisation. More specifically, a room in which to handle the anhydrate must be kept at low humidity and conversely, a room in which to handle the hemihydrate and hemisesquihydrate must be kept at low temperatures and high humidity. Unless these conditions are provided, these compounds or prepartions containing these compounds would change in weight, and thus would not serve for practical purposes and would lose their commercial value. By using a stable non-hygroscopic, free-flowing active compound, as is provided by S-(-)-Nadifloxacin 0.2 H2O, a satisfactory dosing consistency and accuracy is achieved<br><br>
during the preparation of medicaments, which increases safety and therefore minimizes the risk to the patient.<br>
2.	Crystalline salts of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin, especially sodium, potassium, and arginine<br>
salts, and hydrates thereof have been identified with increased aqueous solubility<br>
over S-(-)-Nadifloxacin, and consequently with superior properties for use in the<br>
preparation of parenteral formulations, and with advantages of improved oral<br>
bioavailability in solid oral dosage forms<br>
3.	Derivatives of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin are identified at the sites of the 2-COOH function<br>
and the 4'-hydroxy moiety of the 9-(4'-hydroxypiperidino) group respectively, and<br>
salts and hydrates thereof<br>
4.	Processes are described to obtain said the optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid of the invention, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof mentioned under items 1-3 above and as described in detail below<br>
5.	RS-(±)-Nadifloxacin, S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof have high activity against Mupirocin-resistant microbial strains such as Mupirocin-resistant staphylococci, Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and Quinolone-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), enterococci, betahemolytic streptococci and viridans group of streptococci.<br>
6.	RS-(±)-Nadifloxacin, S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof have activity against mycobacteria and newly emerging nosocomial pathogens such as Chryseobacterium meningosepticum.<br>
7.	S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof have 2-4 times higher antimicrobial activity than racemic-Nadifloxacin against Mupirocin-<br><br><br>
resistant staphylococci, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Quinolone-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), enterococci, betahemolytic streptococci and viridans group of streptococci, mycobacteria and newly emerging nosocomial pathogens such as Chryseobacterium meningosepticum.<br>
8.	S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof are not only bacteriostatic but also bactericidal towards Mupirocin-resistant staphylococci, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Quinolone-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), enterococci at concentrations^ times lower than that of RS-(±)-Nadifloxacin.<br>
9.	S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof have 2-4 times higher antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive pathogens such as staphylococci and enterococci and Gram-negative pathogens such as E.coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Serratia and Citrobacter in the acidic environments encountered in infection such as urinary tract infections.<br>
10.	S-(-)-Nadifloxacin, its derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof have high potency against efflux pump-bearing Staphylococcus strains and are thus of unique value in treating infections caused by antibiotic-resistant microorganisms for which the resistance mechanism is due to the presence of efflux pumps.<br>
11.	S-(-)-Nadifloxacin, its derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof have high propensity to display resistance to resistance development, which has<br>
been shown in studies involving sequential transfers/passages of a S.aureus strain through respective drug containing media.<br><br>
12.	The acute intravenous toxicity of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and its arginine salt is significantly lower than RS-(±)-Nadifloxacin (Biological Example 3).<br>
13.	S-(-)-Nadifloxacin, its derivatives, salts and hydrates thereof have a favourable toxicity profile in comparison with other fluoroquinolone drugs in clinical use in respect of cytotoxic effect on various cell lines (Biological Example 4), phototoxicity (vide infra) and cardiotoxicity.<br>
14.	The oral bioavailability of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin is 2-times higher than that of RS-(±)-Nadifloxacin (Biological Example 5).<br>
Through their extensive studies, the present inventors have shown for the first time a novel expanded set of clinically desired antimicrobial attributes of efficacy and safety of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin, which have been not reported in the literature; since the first disclosure of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin in JP 63, 192, 753 about twelve years ago and of RS-(t)-Nadifloxacin in JP 58,90,511 about twenty years ago. New hydrates, salts, derivatives, pseudopoh/morphs, polymorphs and compositions of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin have also been identified by the present inventors, which have in addition to their biological properties mentioned above, newer physico-chemical properties, thus permitting their utility in a clinical and commercial exploitation in newer compositions for newer diseases and newer methods of systemic and topical treatment that were hitherto not possible.<br>
It is, thus, an object of the present invention to provide S-(-)-opticaUy pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopoh/morphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof, of the formula I, substantially free of their R-(+)-isomers.<br><br><br>
Formula I It is another object of the present invention to provide a process or processes for preparing the novel optically pure S-(-)-optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof, of the formula I.<br>
A further object is to provide pharmaceutical compositions comprising optically pure S-(-)-benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof as potent antibacterial agents for treating systemic and topical bacterial infections, especially infections caused by resistant Gram-positive, sensitive and resistant Gram-negative organisms, mycobacterial infections and nosocomial pathogen infections while avoiding the toxic effects associated with the administration of their R-(+) -isomers.<br>
Another object of this inventions relates to a method of treatment of infections caused by Mupirocin-resistant bacterial strains such as Mupirocin-resistant staphylococci, Mupirocin-resistant streptococci and other Mupirocin-resistant Gram-positive and Mupirocin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, and of dermal diseases and disorders such as impetigo, folliculitis, infected dermatitis, wounds and burns. Treatment comprises oral, parenteral, administration and/or topical application of an effective amount of a composition of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin or optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof of formula I, or of a composition of RS-(!)-Nadifloxacin and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
A further object of the invention includes methods for treating the infections in humans and animals caused by Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, resistant Gram-positive organism such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus<br><br><br>
(MRSA), Quinolone-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), enterococci, betahemolytic streptococci and viridans group of streptococci, mycobacteria and newly emerging nosocomial pathogens such as Chryseobacterium meningosepticum, and Gram-negative pathogens such as E.coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Serratia Citrobacter and Pseudomonas, while avoiding the toxic effects that are associated with the racemic mixture of Nadifloxacin by administering systemically or topically S-(-)-Nadifloxacin or optically pure S-(-)-benzoquinoIizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof to the affected human or animal.<br>

S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-[4-(hydroxy)-l-piperidin-l-yI)-5-methyl-l-oxo-lH,5H-benzo [i,j] quinoIizine-2-carboxylic acid arginine salt .0.75 H20.<br>
In addition to their favourable aqueous solubility, the respective arginine salts on repeated i.v. administration in rats did not cause phlebitis at doses double those of the<br><br><br>
corresponding sodium salt. This feature would make S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-[4-(hydroxy)-l-piperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-l-oxo-lH,5H-benzo [i,j] quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid arginine salt 0.25 H20 and S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-[4-(hydroxy)-l-piperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-l-oxo-lH,5H-benzo [i,j] quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid arginine salt .0.75 H20 suitable for long term i.v. administration which is commonly undertaken for critically ill patients or patients in intensive care unit.<br>
The particular derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates of the invention as defined above exhibit the same potent antibacterial activity as S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and also have one or more desirable physico-chemical properties such as constant moisture content, excellent solubility etc. regardless of the ambient relative humidity, and also have desirable bioavailability and safety profiles.<br>
Generally, conversion of a pharmacologically active compound into a salt or hydrate form induces a change in the compound's physicochemical properties such as solubility, absorption velocity, etc. Therefore, study about an effective salt or hydrate form for developing a successful new medicine has been conventionally made. Pharmaceutically more desirable crystal form may be selected by studying whether or not any polymorphs or pseudopolymorph can be produced and its physicochemical properties (see, Remington's Pharmaceutics, Chapter 75 Preformulation; Byrn, S. R. Solid Chemistry of Drugs, Academic Press, New York, 1982). The hydrate, one such polymorph or pseudopolymorph, has water molecules inside the crystal, and thus has a crystalline structure different from that of the anhydrate, as can be verified from their respective X-ray diffraction patterns. A polymorph or pseudopolymorph differs from the original compound not in its chemical properties, such as pharmacological activity, but in its physical properties, such as crystallinity, hygroscopicity, melting point, solubility, solubilizing velocity, etc. So, the polymorph or pseudopolymorph has been recognised as pharmaceutically important (see, Morris, K.P. et. al. Int. J. Pharm., 108,15-206 (1994)).<br>
In the process of identifying the physico-chemical properties of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin, the compound has been found to exist as a stable hydrate wherein the proportion of water molecules contained in one molecule varies within a specific range. Here, stability does<br><br><br>
not mean chemical stability but the difficulty of removing water molecules. That is, a stable hydrate neither loses the water molecule contained therein, nor absorbs moisture over a wide range of ambient relative humidity. In contrast, moisture absorption by the anhydrate can vary greatly with the ambient relative humidity. As a result of experiments carried out by the present inventors, S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-l-oxo-lH,5H-benzo [i,j] quinoIizine-2-carboxylic acid has been shown to exist as a stable hydrate for values of the hydration number z equal to 0.2, 0.5 or 0.75. In addition to the anhydrate S-(-)-Nadifloxacin, the inventors have now found that S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yI)-5-methyl-l-oxo-lH,5H-benzo[i,j] quinolizine-2-carboxyIic acid may exist as a 0.2 hydrate, 0.5 hydrate and 0.75 hydrate crystal forms. Among these, 0.2 is preferred since the change in moisture content is the lowest at the hydration number. Although stable hemihydrate and the hemisesquihydrate forms can be prepared, they alter also to the 0.2 hydrate on vacuum drying at room temperature.<br>
The moisture content of the hydrate varies with the hydration number (z) of the hydrated molecule. The actual moisture content may however, differ from the calculated moisture content depending on differences in recrystallization conditions, drying conditions, etc. The range of the actual moisture content for the 0.2 hydrate is from 0.9 % to 1.1 %, even though the calculated moisture content is 0.99 %.<br>
It has also been found that the relative humidity range at which the moisture content of the anhydrate and the 0.2 hydrate can be maintained constant differ from each other. That is, although the anhydrate has a constant moisture content at a relative humidity of 20 % to 75%, the 0.2 hydrate is constant at a relative humidity of 20% to 95% (see figures 1 and 2).<br>
The hydrates of formula I may be prepared by means of conventional methods well known in the art to which the present invention pertains. Particularly, the different hydrates may be prepared merely by changing recrystallization conditions, and the temperature/vacuum conditions under which the crystals are dried. The 0.2 hydrate is prepared by dissolving S-(-)-9-fluoro-8(4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-6,7-dihydro-l-oxo-lH,5H-benzo[i,j] quinoIizine-2-carboxyIic acid in a minimum volume of organic<br><br>
isolvent, preferably acetonitrile or ethanol at an elevated temperature, preferably at the reflux temperature of the solvent adding an amount of water sufficient to bring about crystallisation after cooling in high yields, filtering and drying the separated crystals at temperatures up to 40 - 50°C for 3-6 hours, preferably 5 hours, in vacuo upto 50 mm of Hg to a constant weight. The 0.2 hydrate can also prepared by dissolving S-(-)-9-fluoro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-6,7-dihydro-l-oxo-lH,5H-benzo[i,j] quinoIizine-2-carboxylic acid in alkali, preferably 1 molar aqueous sodium hydroxide, heating to 55-60 °C, acidifying, preferably with concentrated hydrochloric acid, at 55-60 °C, maintaining the suspension at 50-70 °C, preferably at 60 °C for at least 30 minutes, cooling, filtering, washing with water and drying the separated crystals at temperatures up to 40 - 50 °C for 3-6 hours, preferably 5 hours, in vacuo upto 50 mm of Hg to a constant weight.<br>
The 0.5 hydrate can be prepared by dissolving S-(-)-9-fluoro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-6,7-dihydro-l-oxo-lH,5H-benzo[i,j] quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid in a minimum volume of organic solvent such as acetone at reflux temperature adding an appropriate amount of water at ambient temperature, sufficient to bring about crystallisation after cooling in high yields, filtering and drying the separated crystals at temperatures up to 
The 0.75 hydrate can be prepared by suspending S-(-)-9-fluoro-8(4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-6,7-dihydro-l-oxo-lH,5H-benzo[i,j] quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid in water, preferably at 10% (weight by volume) suspension, formulating into a slurry by vigorous stirring continuing stirring at 5 °C for 1-2 hours, adding acetone ca. 5% (weight by volume) with continuation of stirring at 5 °C for 4-5 hours, filtering and drying the product at temperatures 
The methods as stated above will be more specifically explained in the examples described in appropriate later section of this text.<br>

The present invention encompasses a method of treating bacterial infections, especially resistant Gram-positive organism infections, Gram-negative organism infections, mycobacterial infections and nosocomial pathogen infections in humans and animals, which comprises administering systemically or topically to a human or animal in need of such antiinfective therapy an amount of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin or an optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof, of the formula I as defined above, substantially free of its R-(+)-enantiomer, said amount being sufficient to eradicate such infections. The method avoids the concomitant liability of toxic effects associated with the administration of RS-(±)-isomers by providing an amount of S-(-)-Nadifioxacin or an optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof, of the invention, which is insufficient to cause the toxic effects associated with the racemic mixture of the isomers.<br>
The present invention also encompasses an antiinfective composition for the treatment of humans and animals in need of therapy for systemic or topical infections especially resistant Gram-positive organism infections, Gram-negative organism infections, mycobacterial infections and nosocomial pathogen infections, which comprises an amount of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts and hydrates thereof, of Formula I as defined above, substantially free of their R-(+)-enantiomers, said amount being sufficient to eradicate said infection. The composition should provide a therapeutic dose, which is insufficient to cause the toxic effects associated with the comparable compositions comprised of racemic RS-(±)-isomeric mixture.<br>
S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and the compounds of the invention have 2-4 times higher antimicrobial activity than RS-(±)-Nadifloxacin against Mupirocin-resistant staphylococci, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Quinolone-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, such as Methicillin-<br><br><br>
resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), enterococci, betahemolytic streptococci and viridans group of streptococci. The antimicrobial profile of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and the compounds of the invention have, thus, a potential to address several unmet antibacterial treatment needs ascribed to the most frequently encountered Gram-positive bacterial pathogens in clinical settings. S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and the compounds of the invention possesses superior antibacterial activity against such Gram-positive pathogens which have now become refractory to older first- and second-line antibacterials mentioned above (cf. Biological Example 1). Infections such as impetigo, pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis, endocarditis, urinary tract infections and bacteremias caused by Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, enterococci, beta haemolytic streptococci and viridans group of streptococci are potentially amenable to successful treatment with S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and the compounds of the invention. Intrinsically high potency of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and the compounds of the invention coupled with their powerful bactericidal action against organisms such as S. aureus, Coagulase negative staphylococci and enterococci renders S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and the compounds of the invention eminently suitable for the treatment of infections caused by multi-drug resistant strains belonging to this group.<br>
There is a surge of mycobacterial infections due to the spread of AIDS such as in several countries of Europe, USA and Asia. AIDS and other immunocompromised patients frequently contract mycobacterial infections due to multi-drug resistant M. tuberculosis and other atypical mycobacteria such as M. intracellular and M. avium. An embodiment of this invention is that the antimycobacterial profile of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and the compounds of the invention have been found to display significant activity against such organisms and provide a valuable option for the treatment of such problematic diseases. In addition, S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and the compounds of the invention have been shown by the present inventors to display negligible phototoxicity potential than the comparator fluoroquinolone drug sparfloxacin. In studies conducted by the present inventors Sparfloxacin was found to be phototoxic at dosages 25 times lower than S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and the compounds of the invention.<br>
S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and the compounds of the invention also possesses high level of<br><br>
activity against newly emerging Gram-negative pathogens such as Chryseobacterium meningosepHcum and Chryseobacterium indologense. These organisms frequently infect immunocompromised adults as well as premature neonats. These organisms are nosocomial pathogens against which most of the currently available antibacterial agents possess either poor or only borderline activity. The present investigations have shown that S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and the compounds of the invention in possessing superior activity against chryseobacteria and other nosocomial pathogens such as MRSA, enterococci and methicillin susceptible strains of staphylococci have a potential to become excellent drugs for the treatment of hospital acquired infections (cf. Biological Example 1).<br>
Against bacterial organisms which proliferate in acidic environment such as the urinary tract, S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and the compounds of the invention behave in a characteristically different pattern than do the known fluoroquinolones, such as Ciprofloxcin, Levofloxacin, Ofloxacin and Norfloxacin. In studies carried out by the present inventors the antibacterial potency, that is MIC value, as well as bactericidal action of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin against Gram-positive pathogens such as staphylococci and enterococci, and Gram-negative pathogens such as E.coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Serratia, Citrobacter, and Pseudomonas, unlike that of Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin, is not affected at all by the acidic pH of 5.5. On the contrary, for some organisms the MIC of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin improves by 100% while that for Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin deteriorates in the range of from 50% to 99% (Biological Example 2). Further confirmation of these results were obtained by comparatively evaluating the antibacterial activity of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin, Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin in normal human urine against a range of organisms frequently encountered in urinary tract infections. For Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin the loss in antibacterial activity coupled with the abolition of bactericidal action occurring at acidic pH would lead to recurrent episodes of urinary tract infections in patients receiving such fluoroquinolone antibacterial drugs, whereas treatment with S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and the compounds of the invention, would lead to successful and consistent cure, irrespective of the pH or the nature of the environment in which bacterial pathogens are proliferating. This unpredictable finding with S-(-)-Nadifloxacin is of great clinical<br><br>
relevance and would provide a unique advantage to patients on a regimen of the compounds of the invention for urinary tract infections.<br>
In gram-positive bacteria, especially Staphylococcus strains, resistance to most of the fluoroquinolones in clinical use is mediated by the presence of efflux pumps, in particular Nor A efflux pumps, which affects the accumulation of the antibiotics within the cell by enhancing efflux, thus preventing the antibiotic action. Current estimates of prevalence of Nor A bearing strains among ciprofloxacin resistant staphylococci is about 30-80%.<br>
The present inventors have surprisingly and unexpectedly found that in studies with fluoroquinolone-resistant Staphylococcus strains with efflux pumps, while most of the fluoroquinolones in current clinical use have shown significantly reduced potency against the efflux-pump bearing Staphylococcus strains, S-(-)-Nadifloxacin, its hydrates, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and derivatives thereof, have shown no loss in potency of activity in both in-vitro and in-vivo conditions (Biological Examples 6 &amp; 7). These results support the reduced effectiveness of the current fluoroquinolones in clinical use in treating infections caused by such efflux-pump-bearing staphylococcal strains. These results, thus, create a novel opportunity for clinical use of the compounds of the invention in treating infections caused by efflux-pump bearing strains, in particular efflux-pump bearing Staphylococcal strains.<br>
The finding of this property of the compounds of the invention is not suggested by the prior art. In thus behaving differently from the general class of fluoroquinolones, S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and the compounds of the invention display a property hitherto not yet shown. It has arisen because of the in-depth studies undertaken by the inventors of the compounds of the invention, without any reasonable expectation of the kind of result that has been obtained.<br>
The high propensity of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin to display resistance to resistance development in comparison to current fluoroquinolone drugs in clinical use has also now been shown for the first time by the inventors. In studies, which mimic the clinical scenario, S-(-)-Nadifloxacin was evaluated in comparison with trovafloxacin<br><br>
and gatifloxacin by sequential transfer/passages through respective drug containing media. Although initially all the three drugs had comparable activity against S.aureus strain 042, after six passages in drug containing media, whilst S-(-)-Nadifloxacin showed a marginal rise of 4% in MIC value, trovafloxacin and gatifloxacin showed approximately 300% and 700% rise respectively in MIC values. This property of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin to display resistance to resistance development has considerable value clinically. In clinical settings, the ability of pathogenic bacteria to select a drug resistant variant/subclone while the patient is on antibacterial drug therapy often determines the outcome of the therapy. A drug to which such resistant variant comes up readily, often witnesses failure of therapy, or a need to increase the dosage significantly, thereby dramatically increasing the chances of exposing patients to adverse side effects also.<br>
These combined features of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof of activity against bacterial organisms which proliferate in acidic environment, of an ability to resist the action of efflux pump present in drug resistant microbial strains and of a propensity to display resistance to resistance development, endows the compounds of the invention with a unique clinical potential yet not realised in other fluoroquinolone antibacterials in current medical use.<br>
The above list of pathogens is merely by way of example and is in no way to be interpreted as limiting. Examples which may be mentioned of diseases, which can be prevented, alleviated and/or cured by the formulations according to the invention are otitis externa, otitis media; pharyngitis; pneumonia; peritonitis; pyelonephritis; cystitis; endocarditis; systemic infections; bronchitis; arthritis; local infections; septic diseases.<br>
•<br>
These findings have an important implication from the point of view of the systemic use of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and the compounds of the invention, which in view of their superior potency, superior bactericidal activity, expanded biospectrum, better bioavailability and improved tolerability are now enabled to be administered systemically in doses that are insufficient to cause the toxic effects associated with the<br><br><br>
administration of racemic RS-(±)-Nadifloxacin and corresponding racemic mixtures of compounds of the invention.<br>
Utilising the substantially optically pure or optically pure isomer of Nadifloxacin or optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof, whether in systemic or topical dosage form, results in clearer dose-related definitions of efficacy, diminished toxic effects and accordingly an improved therapeutic index. It is, therefore, more desirable to administer the S-(-)-isomer of Nadifloxacin and S-(-)-optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts and hydrates thereof, than RS-(±)-Nadifloxacin and racemic mixtures of compounds of the invention.<br>
The term "substantially free of its R-(+)-enantiomer" as used herein means that the compositions contain a greater proportion of the S-isomer of Nadifloxacin or an optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof, in relation to the R-isomer. In a preferred embodiment, the term "substantially free of its R-isomer" as used herein means that the composition is at least 90% by weight of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin or an optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof, and 10% by weight or less of the corresponding R-(+)-isomer. In a more preferred embodiment the term "substantially free of the R-enantiomer" means that the composition is at least 99% by weight of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin or an optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof, and 1% by weight or less of the corresponding R-(+)-isomer. In the most preferred embodiment the term "substantially free of the R-enantiomer" means that the composition contains greater than 99% by weight of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin or an optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof. These percentages are based on the total amount of Nadifloxacin in the composition. The terms "substantially optically pure S-isomer of Nadifloxacin or an optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof or "substantially optically pure S-Nadifloxacin or an optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their<br><br>
derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof and "optically pure S-enantiomer of Nadifloxacin or an optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof' or "optically pure S-Nadifloxacin or an optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof" are also encompassed by the above described amounts.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions are prepared according to conventional procedures used by persons skilled in the art to make stable and effective compositions. In the solid, liquid, parenteral and topical dosage forms, an effective amount of the active compound or the active ingredient is any amount, which produces the desired results.<br>
For the purpose of this invention the pharmaceutical compositions may contain the active compounds, S-(-)-Nadifloxacin or an optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and hydrates thereof, in a form to be administered alone, but generally in a form to be administered in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. Suitable carriers which can be used are, for example, diluents or excipients such as fillers, extenders, binders, emollients, wetting agents, disintegrants, surface active agents humectants, antoxidants, sequestering agents and lubricants which are usually employed to prepare such drugs depending on the type of dosage form.<br>

For example, oral, rectal, parenteral (subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous), transdermal, topical and like forms of administration may be employed. Dosage forms, include (solutions, suspensions, etc) tablets, pills, powders, troches, dispersions, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, capsules, injectable preparations, patches, ointments, creams, lotions, gels, sprays, shampoos and the like.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets, or tablets, or aerosol sprays, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, as a powder or granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid, a non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. Such compositions may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy, but all methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation.<br>

In molding the pharmaceutical composition into pills, a wide variety of conventional carriers known in the art can be used. Examples of suitable carriers are excipients such as glucose, lactose, starch, cacao butter, hardened vegetable oils, kaolin and talc, binders such as gum arabic powder, tragacanth powder, gelatin, and ethanol, and disintegrants such as laminaria and agar.<br>
In molding the pharmaceutical composition into a suppository form, a wide variety of carriers known in the art can be used. Examples of suitable carriers include polyethylene glycol, cacao butter, higher alcohols, gelatin, and semi-synthetic glycerides.<br>
A second preferred method is parenterally for intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous administration.<br>
A third preferred route of administration is topically, for which creams, ointments, sprays, shampoos, lotions, gels, dusting powders and the like are well suited. Generally, an effective amount of the compound according to this invention in a topical form 0.1% composition is to about 10% by weight of the total composition. Preferably, the effective amount is 1% of the total composition.<br><br><br>
For topical application, there are employed as non-sprayable forms, viscous to semi¬solid or solid forms comprising a carrier compatible with topical application and having a dynamic viscosity preferably greater than water. Suitable formulations include but are not limited to solutions, suspensions, emulsions, creams, ointments, powders, liniments, salves, aerosols, etc., which are, if desired, sterilized or mixed with auxiliary agents, e.g. preservatives, antioxidants, stabilizers, wetting agents, buffers or salts for influencing osmotic pressure, etc. For topical application, also suitable are sprayable aerosol preparations wherein the active ingredient preferably in combination with a solid or liquid inert carrier material.<br>
In addition to the common dosage forms set out above, the compounds of the present invention may also be administered by controlled release means and/or delivery devices such as those described in U S Patent Nos. 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123 and 4,008,719; the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
When the pharmaceutical composition is formulated into an injectable preparation, in formulating the pharmaceutical composition into the form of a solution or suspension, all diluents customarily used in the art can be used. Examples of suitable diluents are water, ethyl alcohol, polypropylene glycol, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohol, polyoxyethylene sorbitol, and sorbitan esters. Sodium chloride, glucose or glycerol may be incorporated into a therapeutic agent.<br>

A specific embodiment of the invention is the preparation of storage stable compositions of the compounds of the invention of formula I. Such stable compositions can be advantageously made through the use of selective stabilizers. Different stabilizers are known to those skilled in the art of making pharmaceutical compositions.    Of special utility for making storage stable compositions of the<br><br>
compound of the invention of formula I, stabilizers such as disodium EDTA, tromethamine, cyclodextrins such as gamma-cyclodextrin, beta-cyclodextrin, hydroxy-propyl-gamma-cyclodextrin have been found to be useful.<br>
A specific embodiment of the invention utilises arginine as an excipient in compositions to facilitate the aqueous solubility of the compounds of the invention which comprises utilising an appropriate molar amount of arginine with a specific compound of the invention. For example, a 0.7 molar amount of arginine added to a molar amount of S-(-)-9-fluoro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-6,7-dihydro-l-oxo-lH,5Hbenzo[i,j] quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid arginine salt 0.75 H20, raises the aqueous solubility of the salt from 94 mg/ml to a value &gt;200 mg/ml.<br>
In a specific embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutical compositions contain an effective amount of the active compounds of S-(-)-9-fluoro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-6,7-dihydro-l-oxo-1 H,5H benzo[i,j] quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid (also called S-(-)-Nadifloxacin) or one of the specific optically pure derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs or hydrates thereof described in this specification as hereinbefore described in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipients, and optionally other therapeutic ingredients.<br>
The prophylactic or therapeutic dose of S-(-)-Nadifloxacin and optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs or hydrates thereof, in the acute or chronic management of disease will be calculated based on the prophylactic or therapeutic dose of S-(-)-9-fluoro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-6,7-dihydro-l-oxo-lH,5H benzo [i,j] quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid and will vary with the severity of condition to be treated, and the route of administration. In addition, the dose, and perhaps the dose frequency, will also vary according to the age, body weight and response of the individual patient. In general, the total daily dose range, for S-(-)-Nadifloxacin or an optically pure benzoquinolizine carboxylic acid, their derivatives, salts, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs or hydrates thereof, for the conditions described herein, is from about 200 mg to about 1500 mg, in single or divided doses.<br><br><br>
Preferably, a daily dose range should be between about 400 mg to 1200 mg, in single or divided dosage, while most preferably a daily dose range should be between about 500 mg to about 1000 mg in divided dosage. While intramuscular administration may be a single dose or upto 3 divided doses, intravenous administration can include a continuous drip. It may be necessary to use dosages outside these ranges in some cases as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Further, it is noted that the clinician or treating physician will know how and when to interrupt, adjust, or terminate therapy in conjunction with individual patient's response. The term "an amount sufficient to eradicate such infections but insufficient to cause said toxic effect" is encompassed by the above - described dosage amount and dose frequency schedule.<br>
The invention is further defined by reference to the following examples describing in detail the preparation of the composition of the present invention as well as their utility. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many modifications, both to materials and methods may be practiced without departing from the purpose and scope of this invention.<br>

Silica (anhydrous) and three saturated solutions of electrolytes prepared by dissolving the respective salts in water were each introduced into different desiccators to control the inner relative humidity to a specific value as represented in the following Table 7. Then, the equilibrium moisture contents of S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-l-oxo-1H,5H-benzo [i,j] quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid<br><br>

Specifically, lg of the sample was spread on a pre-weighed petridish and the total weight was accurately measured, then both the samples were placed in each desiccator of Table 8 The dessicators were allowed to stand at normal temperature for at least 3 days and the weight was measured agingly over this period. The weight changes were tabulated . At the end of 3 days all samples were taken to be weighed. The moisture content of each sample<br>
was determined by Karl Fischer analysis. Equilibrium moisture content at each relative humidity is represented in Fig 1 (anhydrate) and Fig 2 (0.2 hydrate). Fig 2 shows that the moisture content of the 0.2 hydrate is maintained around 1% for the whole humidity range tested (20% to 95%). Fig 1 shows that the moisture content of the anhydrate is maintained around 0.1% at the relative humidity 20% to 58%. At humidities of about 75% the anhydrate shows weight change and reaches a new equilibrium which is maintained around 1% for the relative humidity range 75% to 95% and corresponds to the 0.2 hydrate (by Karl Fisher measurements and X-ray diffraction analysis). The 0.2 hydrate displays superior stability since it keeps a constant equilibrium moisture content regardless of relative humidity change.<br>

For the Differential Scanning Calorimetry, PERKIN ELMER DSC 7 system was used. 3 mg of the sample was weighed into the aluminium pan, which was then press sealed with an aluminium lid. After three tiny needle holes were made on the lid the sample was tested by heating from (15°C) to (300°C) at a rate of 20°C/min . As can be seen from the Fig 8 there is an endothermic peak which begins at around 150°C, and an exothermic peak due to thermal decomposition at around 240°C to 264°C. In contrast the anhydrate shows only an exothermic peak at around 245°C to 268°C without any endothermic peak.<br>
