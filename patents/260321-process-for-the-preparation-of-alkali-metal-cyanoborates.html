Salts with cyanoborate anions<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of alkali metal<br>
cyanoborates, to the further conversion thereof into salts comprising cyanoborate<br>
anions and organic cations, to these salts, and to the use thereof as ionic liquids.<br>
Ionic liquids or liquid salts are ionic species which consist of an organic cation and<br>
a generally inorganic anion. They do not contain neutral molecules, and generally<br>
have melting points below 373 K. A multiplicity of compounds which are used as<br>
ionic liquids are known in the prior art. In particular, they are also the Subject-mat"<br>
ter of a series of patents and patent applications.<br>
Thus, solvent-free ionic liquids were disclosed for the first time by Hurley and Wier<br>
in a series of US patents (US 2,446,331, US 2,446,339 and US 2,446,350). These<br>
"salts which are molten at room temperature" comprised AICI3 and a multiplicity of<br>
n-alkylpyridinium halides.<br>
In recent years, some review articles have been published on this topic<br>
(R. Sheldon "Catalytic reactions in ionic liquids", Chem. Commun., 2001, 2399-<br>
2407; M.J. Earle, K.R. Seddon "Ionic liquids. Green solvent for the future", Pure<br>
Appl. Chem., 72 (2000), 1391-1398; P. Wasserscheid, W. Keim "lonische Flussig-<br>
keiten - neue Lösungen fur die Übergangsmetallkatalyse" [Ionic Liquids - Novel<br>
Solutions for Transition-Metal Catalysis], Angew. Chem., 112 (2000), 3926-3945;<br>
T. Welton "Room temperature ionic liquids. Solvents for synthesis and catalysis",<br>
Chem. Rev., 92 (1999), 2071-2083; R. Hagiwara, Ya. Ito "Room temperature ionic<br>
liquids of alkylimidazolium cations and fluoroanions", Journal of Fluorine Chem.,<br>
105 (2000), 221-227).<br>
The properties of ionic liquids, for example melting point, thermal and electro-<br>
chemical stability, viscosity, are greatly influenced by the nature of the anion. By<br>
contrast, the polarity and hydrophilicity or lipophilicity can be varied through a suit-<br>
able choice of the cation/anion pair. There is therefore a basic demand for novel<br>
ionic liquids having varied properties which facilitate additional possibilities with<br>
respect to their use.<br>
Crucial advances in the area of ionic liquids have been achieved with the discov-<br>
ery of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloroaluminate. This salt has a broad liquid<br><br>
WO 2004/072089	PCT/EP2004/000231<br>
-2-<br>
range and an electrochemical window of greater than 3 V and is thus of great<br>
interest for electrochemical and synthetic purposes. However, its use is limited by<br>
the chemical instability, especially to moisture. After the discovery of the more<br>
hydrolysis-stable 1-ethy!-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, combinations of<br>
alkylimidazolium cations with inorganic or organic anions were investigated, of<br>
which 1 -ethyl-3-methyiimidazoiium tetrafluoroborate is the best characterised.<br>
The stability of the imidazolium cation is relatively high and its decomposition tem-<br>
perature is essentially determined by the anion. Thus, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium<br>
salts with triflate and bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anions are stable UD to<br>
400°C, whereas 1-ehy|-3-methilimidazolium  tetrafluoroborate is only stable up to<br>
The prior art describes borate anions in which fluorine ligands have been replaced<br>
by cyanide (E. Bernhardt, G. Henkel, H. Willner, Z Anorg. Allg. Chem. 626 (2000)<br>
560; D. Williams, B. Pleune, J. Kouvetakis, M. D. Williams, R. A. Andersen, J.<br>
Amer. Chem. Soc. 122 (2000) 7735; E. Bernhardt, M. Berkei, M. Schurmann, H.<br>
Willner, Z Anorg. Allg. Chem. 628 (2002) 1734) and trifluoromethyl ligands (E.<br>
Bernhardt, G. Henkel, H. Willner, G. Pawelke, H. Burger, Chem. Eur. J. 7 (2001)<br>
4696; G. Pawelke, H. Burger, Coord. Chem. Rev. 215 (2001) 243). The trifluoro-<br>
methyl borates are synthesised here starting from the cyanoborates, but the<br>
cyanoborates are only accessible with difficulty and in small amounts. The synthe-<br>
sis of [B(CN4)] is labour-intensive and can only be carried out on a small prepara-<br>
tive scale. In addition, the starting materials are expensive.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide novel stable compounds having<br>
valuable properties which can be used as ionic liquids, and a process for the<br>
preparation thereof. In particular, the object is to provide salts with borate anions<br>
which have higher stability than the salts with tetrafluoroborate anions.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide an effective and economical<br>
process for the preparation of these borate salts and their precursors.<br>
This object is achieved in accordance with the invention by the characterising<br>
features of the main claim and the sub-claims.<br><br>
WO 2004/072089	PCT/EP2004/000231<br>
-3-<br>
The present invention therefore relates firstly to a process for the preparation of<br>
alkali metal cyanoborates of the general formula (1)<br>
M+  [B(CN)4]-     (1).<br>
where M is selected from the group Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs,<br>
in which the readily available starting substances alkali metal tetrafluoroborate<br>
M[BF4] (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) and alkali metal cyanide MCN (M = Li, Na, K, Rb,<br>
Cs) are reacted with one another in a solid-state reaction.<br>
The alkali metal tetrafluoroborate used in accordance with the invention is prefera-<br>
bly potassium tetrafluoroborate K[BF4] or sodium tetrafluoroborate Na[BF4], and<br>
the alkali metal cyanide used in accordance with the invention is preferably potas-<br>
sium cyanide KCN or sodium cyanide NaCN.<br>
In a preferred variant of the process according to the invention, the alkali metal<br>
tetrafluoroborate is reacted with the alkali metal cyanide in the presence of a lith-<br>
ium halide. The lithium halide here is selected from LiCI, LiBr and Lil, it is particu-<br>
larly preferably lithium chloride LiCI.<br>
Alkali metal cyanide and lithium halide can in each case be employed in an excess<br>
of one of the two reagents. However, the alkali metal cyanide and the lithium hal-<br>
ide are preferably brought to reaction in approximately in the molar ratio 1:1.<br>
The alkali metal tetrafluoroborate and the alkali metal cyanide are preferably<br>
employed in the molar ratio of 1:4 to 1:12, particularly preferably in the molar ratio<br>
of about 1:9.<br>
The alkali metal tetrafluoroborate: alkali metal cyanide : lithium halide molar ratio<br>
of about 1:9:9 is therefore very particularly preferably used.<br>
The starting materials used for the reaction according to the invention are particu-<br>
larly preferably potassium tetrafluoroborate K[BF4] as alkali metal tetrafluoroborate<br>
and potassium cyanide KCN as alkali metal cyanide.<br>
The solid-state reaction according to the invent/on is carried out at temperatures<br>
between 100°C and 500°C. Preference is given to temperatures of 250 to 400°C,<br>
particularly preferably 280 - 340°C.<br><br>
WO 2004/072089	PCT/EP2004/000231<br>
-4-<br>
Without restricting generality, the subject-matter of the solid-state reaction<br>
according to the invention is explained with reference to a general example:<br>
K[BF4], KCN and LiCI are mixed in the molar ratio of 1:9:9 and subsequently<br>
brought to reaction in the melt. The reaction temperature is selected in such a way<br>
that on the one hand the KCN/LiCI mixture forms a eutectic melting at 270 - 290°C<br>
and on the other hand the tetracyanoborate salts formed only decompose slowly<br>
(
with LiCI (molar ratio 1:1) enables mixed crystals of the K(CI,CN) type (a = 6.34 A,<br>
F m3m) and a further unidentified compound (d = 4.958,2.878, 2.728, 2.482,<br>
2.175 A) to be detected. The yield of K[B(CN)4] is virtually temperature-independ-<br>
ent in (tie range 280 - 340°C and is about 10 - 601 based on TO. It is found<br>
in fyrther experiment that a reduction in the molar  ratio of K(BF4] to KCN/LiCi from<br>
1:9 to 1:4.5 results in reductions in yield. The Raman spectra of the reaction mix-<br>
tures show that the tetracyanoborate is in the form of the lithium salt after the<br>
reaction (v(CN) =2263 cm-1).<br>
In the analogous reaction using an NaCN/LiCI mixture, mixed crystals of the<br>
(Li,Na)(CI,GN) type (a = 5.50A Fm3m) form in the melt of NaCN with LiCI (molar<br>
ratio 1:1) besides a little LiCN (d= 5.216, 3.626 A, m.p. 160°C). A eutectic<br>
(120-140°C) forms between NaCN with LiCI, in contrast to KCN/LiCI, but the mixed<br>
crystals only melt at 360 - 540°C; this is probably the eause of the lower yields<br>
(about 25%) of Na[B(CN)4].<br>
During work-up of the reaction products, the excess cyanide must firstly be des- _<br>
troyed. It is found that oxidation of the cyanide using aqueous 30% H2O2 solution<br>
is the best work-up method. The low salt burden and the complete and rapid<br>
degradation of the cyanide remaining in the reaction mixture, as well as the good<br>
yields outweigh the single disadvantage, the often vigorous and difficult-to-control<br>
reaction of the cyanide. The tetracyanoborate is subsequently extracted from the<br>
aqueous solution and converted into the K or Na salt by re-extraction.<br>
An alternative method available for the work-up of the solid-state reaction products<br>
is oxidation of the unreacted cyanide using aqueous NaOCI solution, which pro-<br>
ceeds within a few minutes under very mild conditions, i.e. without warming or<br>
foaming of the reaction mixture. The work-up is then carried out analogously to<br>
that with H2O2. However, this further work-up is more labour-intensive and time-<br>
consuming owing to the greater salt burden.<br><br>

The present invention furthermore relates to a process for the preparation of alkali<br>
metal cyanoborates of the general formula (2)<br>
M+   [BFn(CN)4-n]-      (2),<br>
where n = 0,1,2 or 3 and<br>
M is selected from thG group Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs,<br>
in which an alkali metal cyanide MCN, where M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, is reacted with<br>
boron trifluoride etherate BF3 OET2<br>
On use of coarse-grained potassium cyanide KCN and BF3-OEt2, equimolar<br>
amounts of K[BF4] and K[BF2(CN)2] also form in the reaction according to the<br>
invention alongside the primary adduct K[BF3(CN)], in accordance with the follow-<br>
ing equations:<br>
K[BF3(CN)]    +   BF3-OEt2   →    K[BF4]   +  BF2(CN)-OEt2<br>
BF2(CN)-OEt2   + KCN →    K[BF2(CN)2]   + Et2O<br>
In addition, the two salts K[BF(CN)3] and K[B(CN)4] form to a lesser extent, the<br>
former in particular if the reaction mixture is held at temperatures above room<br>
temperature.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the boron trifluoride etherate is reacted with the<br>
alkali metal cyanide in the presence of an aprotic solvent. Without restricting gen-<br>
erality, the aprotic solvent can be, for example, acetonitrile, diethyl ether, tetra-<br>
hydrofuran and/or dimethoxyethane.<br>
The alkali metal cyanide used for the process according to the invention is pref-<br>
erably potassium cyanide KCN.<br>
The starting materials are preferably reacted in accordance with the invention at<br>
temperatures of-80 to 100°C, particularly preferably at room temperature.<br><br>

Volatile by-products which are removed under reduced pressure may be formed<br>
during the reaction. Mostly, however, by-products which are insoluble in the sol-<br>
vents used and are separated off by filtration form. The solvent is, if desired,<br>
removed under reduced pressure together with volatile by-products, and the alkali<br>
metal cyanoborates obtained can, if desired, be separated and purified by a com-<br>
mon possibility known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
A third and fourth subject-matter of the present invention are a process for the<br>
preparation of salts with cyanoborate anions of the general formula (3) and the<br>
corresponding salts of the general formula (3)<br>
ktf |BFn(CN)4-n]    (3),<br>
where n = 0,1,2 or 3, and Kt+ is an organic cation, with the proviso that the cation<br>
Kt+ is not [N(C4H9)4]+ for n=0.<br>
For the preparation of the salts, an alkali metal cyanoborate of the general formula<br>
M+ [B(CN)4]-, where M is selected from the group Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs, or an<br>
alkali metal cyanoborate of the general formula M+ [BFn(CN)4-n]-, where n = 0,1,2<br>
or 3 and M is selected from the group Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs, is reacted with Kt+ X-,<br>
where X is a halogen selected from Cl, Br and I, and Kt+ is an organic cation, with<br>
the proviso that the cation Kt+ is not [N(C4H9)4]- for n=0.<br><br>
where R =    H, with the proviso that at least one R on the hetero atom is<br>
different from H,<br>
straight-chain or branched alkyl having 1-20 carbon atoms<br>
straight-chain or branched alkenyl having 2-20 carbon atoms<br>
and one or more double bonds<br>

carbon atoms<br>
halogen, in particular fluorine or chlorine, with the proviso that<br>
no halogen-hetero atom bond is present,<br>
-NO2, with the proviso that no bond to a positively charged<br>
hetero atom is present, and at least one R is different from<br>
NO2,<br>
-CN, with the proviso that no bond to a positively charged<br>
hetero atom is present, and at least one R is different from<br>
CN,<br>
where the R are in each case identical or different,<br>
where the R may be bonded to one another in pairs by single or<br>
double bond,<br>
where one or more R may be partially or fully substituted by<br>
halogens, in particular -F and/or -Cl, or partially by -CN or -NO2,<br>
with the proviso that not all R are fully halogenated,<br>
and where one or two carbon atoms of the R may be replaced<br>
by hetero atoms and/or atom groups selected from the group<br>

-P(O)(NR'R')O-, -P(O)(NR'R')NR'-, -S(O)NR'- and -S(O)2NR'-,<br>
where R' = H, non-, partially or perfluorinated C1- to C6-alkyl or<br>
non-, partially or perfluorinated phenyl.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, fully unsaturated substituents are also<br>
taken to mean aromatic substituents.<br>
Besides hydrogen, suitable substituents R of the organic cation in accordance with<br>
the invention are: C1- to C20-, in particular C1- to C-12-alkyl groups, C2- to C20-, in<br>
particular C2- to C12-, alkenyl or alkynyl groups, saturated or unsaturated, i.e. also<br>
aromatic, C3- to C7-cycloalkyl groups, NO2, CN or halogens. However, a restricting<br>
factor for the halogens here is that they only occur as substituents on carbon<br>
atoms, but not on hetero atoms. NO2 and CN do not occur as substituents of a<br><br>
WO 2004/072089	PCT/EP2004/000231<br>
-8-<br>
positively charged hetero atom; furthermore, not all substituents simultaneously<br>
have the meaning of NO2 or CN.<br>
The substituents R may also be bonded in pairs in such a way that cyclic, bi- or<br>
polycyclic cations are formed. The substituents may be partially or fully substituted<br>
by halogen atoms, in particular by F and/or Cl, or partially by CN or NO2 and con-<br>
tain one or two hetero atoms or atom groups, selected from the group 0, (O),<br>
C(O)O, S, S(O), SO2) SO2O, N, P, NH, PH, NR', PR', P(O)(OR'), P(O)(OR')O,<br>
P(O)(NR'R'), PP)(NR'R')O, P(O)(NR'R')NR', S(O)NR' and S(O)2NR'. In the case<br>
of complete halogenation, however, not all substituents R present may be fully<br>
lialogenated, i.e. at least one R is not perhalogenated.<br>
Without restricting generality, examples of substituents according to the invention<br>
of the organic cation are:<br>

Without restricting generality, the following organic cations are particularly pre-<br>
ferred as salts according to the invention:<br><br>
The salts according to the invention are advantageously very readily soluble in<br>
organic solvents. In comparison to known liquid salts, the salts according to the<br>
invention surprisingly have low viscosity. The salts according to the invention are<br>
advantageously stable. They can be isolated and stored at room temperature.<br>
Furthermore, the salts according to the invention are relatively easy to prepare,<br>
and readily available starting materials are required.<br>
All compounds according to the invention and compounds of the formula<br>
[N(C4H9)4]+ [B(CN)4]~ have a salt-like character, relatively low melting points (usu-<br>
ally below 100°C) and can be used as ionic liquids.<br>
The salts according to the invention and salts of the formula [N(C4H9)4]+ [B(CN)4]-<br>
can be employed as solvents for many synthetic or catalytic reactions, for example<br>

Example 1: Synthesis of K[B(CN)4]<br>
KCN, LiCI and K[BF4] are ground coarsely and mixed with one another in a mortar<br>
in a dry box (MBraun, Munich). The mixture is finely ground using a commercially<br>
available coffee grinder. The reaction mixture is subsequently transferred into a<br>
nickel crucible (Øinternal = 101 mm, dwal = 2 mm, h = 85 mm). The crucible is cov-<br>
ered loosely by an iron lid, transferred from the dry box into a muffle furnace (VMK<br>
93, Kontron Material und Strukturanalyse GmbH) and heated. When the reaction<br>
is complete, the crucible with the metal cover is removed from the still hot muffle<br>
furnace and cooled to room temperature in air.<br>
The cooled grey/black porous reaction mixture is transferred out of the crucible<br>
into a mortar and crushed coarsely. 150 ml of water are subsequently added to the<br>
comminuted solid in a 3 I beaker, and a total of 350 ml of H2O2 (30% aqueous<br>
solution, about 3 mol) are added in approximately 30 ml portions over a period of<br>
half an hour with constant stirring. The reaction, which commences exothermically<br>
with vigorous evolution of gas, is controlled by addition of ice. The reaction mixture<br>
(V= 2.3 I) is divided between two 3 I beakers and acidified using concentrated HCI<br>
. (about 300 ml, about 3.6 mol) (pH 5-7) until gas evolution is no longer observed.<br>
It is subsequently checked whether cyanide residues are still present in the mix-<br>
ture (cyanide test, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). The mixture is then fil-<br>
tered, and 28 ml (0.34 mol) of cone. HCI are added to the yellow solution with stir-<br>
ring. 47 g (63 ml, 0.33 mol) of tripropylamine are subsequently added. The reac-<br>
tion mixture is stirred for 15 minutes and extracted with dichloromethane (250,150<br>
and 50 ml). The combined organic phases are washed with 200 ml of H2O, and<br>
the washings are re-extracted with 25 ml of dichloromethane. The combined di-<br>
chloromethane phases are dried over MgSO4 and filtered through a glass frit (D4).<br>
35 g (0.63 mol) of KOH are dissolved in a little water and added to the organic<br>
solution with vigorous stirring. A beige oily substance immediately precipitates out<br>
and forms lumps on the vessel base after further stirring (30 min). The dichloro-<br>
methane/tripropylamine mixture is decanted off, and the product is extracted from<br>
the residue with THF (200,100 and 50 ml). The collected THF phases are dried<br>
using K2CO3, and finally all volatile constituents are removed in a rotary evapora-<br>
tor. The white product is washed with dichloromethane and dried at room tem-<br>
perature under reduced pressure.<br><br>

2 equivalents of NaOH (about 25 g, 0.63 mol) are dissolved in as little water as<br>
possible (aboui 10-20 ml) and added dropwise to the organic solution with vigor-<br>

tripropylamine mixture is decanted off, and the product IS extracted from the resi-<br>
