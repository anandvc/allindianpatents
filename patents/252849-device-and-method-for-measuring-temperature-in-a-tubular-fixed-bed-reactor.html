Description<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a structure for guiding the installation of a<br>
thermowell for temperature sensor and a method for installing a thermowell for<br>
temperature sensor by using the structure.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	In general, the catalytic gas phase oxidation occurring in a reaction tube is highly<br>
exothermic, and it is very important to monitor the temperature of the catalyst bed<br>
a manufacturing process include a process for manufacturing acrolein or acrylic acid<br>
by oxidizing propylene or propane a process for manufacturing phthalic anhydride by<br>
oxidizing naphthalene or orthoxylene, and a process for manufacturing maleic<br>
anhydride by partially oxidizing benzene, butylene, or butadiene.<br>
[3]	During such a manufacturing process, the temperature is measured in the axial<br>
direction of the reaction tube, and is referred to as an axial temperature profile. When it<br>
comes to the temperature profile, the location of hot spots and the temperature size at<br>
that location vary depending on the construction and activity of the catalyst bed, the<br>
reaction temperature, the reaction pressure, and the flow rate of reaction mixtures.<br>
Therefore, it is of crucial importance to measure the temperature inside the catalyst bed<br>
accurately.<br>
[4]	Based on the measured temperature, any excessive increase of temperature at the<br>
hot spots inside the catalyst bed or thermal accumulation near the hot spots must be<br>
avoided. This is because the high temperature occurring otherwise degrades the se-<br>
lectivity of the product.<br>
[5]	In order to monitor the temperature of hot spots of a fixed-bed catalyst reaction tube<br>
and obtain a temperature profile of the entire catalyst bed, a thermowell for<br>
temperature sensor is installed, and a thermocouple, for example, is placed inside the<br>
thermowell while filling the reaction tube with a catalyst..<br>
[6]	When a thermowell for temperature sensor is to be positioned at a desired location<br>
on a catalyst bed (e.g. at radial center), it is customary to install fixed supports (e.g.<br>
wires) on the thermowell at an interval in the axial direction.<br>
[7]	However, if a reaction tube is filled with a catalyst while a thermowell for<br>
temperature sensor is positioned in the reaction tube by fixed supports, they interfere<br>
with the filling path and result in irregular filling. As a result, the density of the catalyst<br><br>
bed fluctuates. In addition, the coefficient of thermal transfer may vary due to the<br>
influence of materials constituting the supports. This adversely affects the temperature<br>
measurement.<br>
[8]	Particularly, if the porosity of the catalyst bed increases locally, most reaction<br>
substances tend to pass through the highly porous portion (i.e. channeling occurs). In<br>
the case of a heat exchange-type multi-tubular reactor, an enormous load is con-<br>
centrated on a fraction of contact tubes among tens of thousands of them. For these<br>
reasons, it is of great importance to maintain a uniformly filled bed.<br>
[9]	When the catalyst needs replacement when its life has expired or when it has been<br>
damaged, the supports installed on the thermowell for temperature sensor make it<br>
difficult to remove the catalyst from the contact tubes.<br>
[10]	A thermowell for temperature sensor having no support may be used in order to<br>
avoid these problems. Although this approach may alleviate the irregularity of filling<br>
and the deviation of density of the catalyst bed, it becomes difficult to maintain the<br>
thermowell for temperature sensor at a desired location in the radial direction of the<br>
catalyst bed. Particularly, the thermowell for temperature sensor tends to bend and<br>
adhere to the wall of the reaction tube or deflect in an unwanted direction. As a result,<br>
it is not easy to measure the temperature at a desired location.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[11]	Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above-mentioned<br>
problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a structure for guiding<br>
the installation of a thermowell for temperature sensor so that, when a fixed-bed<br>
catalyst reaction tube is filled with a catalyst, the thermowell for temperature sensor is<br>
fixed at a predetermined location inside the reaction tube, the resulting catalyst bed has<br>
a constant density, the axial temperature profile of the catalyst bed can be measured ef-<br>
ficiently, and the height of the catalyst-filled bed can be measured simultaneously.<br>
[12]	It is another object of the present invention to provide a holding structure for<br>
holding a structure for guiding the installation of a thermowell for temperature sensor.<br>
[13]	It is still another object of the present invention to provide a method for installing a<br>
thermowell for temperature sensor, together with catalyst filling, by using a structure<br>
for guiding the installation of the thermowell for temperature sensor.<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
[29]	Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[30]	The present invention is directed to a structure for guiding the installation of a<br>
thermowell for temperature sensor so that the thermowell, which is used to measure the<br>
temperature of a catalyst bed in the axial direction inside a reaction tube filled with a<br>
fixed-bed catalyst, is fixed at a predetermined location inside the reaction tube.<br>
[31]	The structure for guiding the installation of a thermowell for temperature sensor<br>
according to the present invention can be moved in the axial direction of the fixed-bed<br>
catalyst reaction tube. Such an axial movement is possible not only when the reaction<br>
tube is empty, but also while the reaction tube is filled with a catalyst.<br>
[32]	When the inventive structure for guiding the installation of a thermowell for<br>
temperature sensor is used while the reaction tube is filled with a catalyst, the structure<br>
is moved in response to a change in height of the catalyst bed and instantly informs of<br>
the filling level.<br>
[33]	FIG. 1 shows an example of a structure for guiding the installation of a thermowell<br>
for temperature sensor according to the present invention. The structure includes a<br>
guide tube 1 for fixing the location of a thermowell, at least two guide tube legs 2<br><br>
connected to the guide tube in the horizontal (transverse) direction so as to support the<br>
guide tube 1, and support rods 3 connected to the guide tube legs in the vertical<br>
(longitudinal) direction so as to support them, respectively.<br>
[34]	When the structure is installed in a fixed-bed catalyst reaction tube, the thermowell<br>
for temperature sensor is made to pass through the guide tube 1 so that the location of<br>
the thermowell is fixed.<br>
[35]	Wires, for example, may be inserted into holes on the upper end of the support rods<br>
3 so that the structure can be moved in the axial direction by manipulating the wires<br>
from the outside of the reaction tube.<br>
[36]	The structure may have at least two guide tubes 1 so that the location of the<br>
thermowell for temperature sensor can be fixed more securely.<br>
[371	When at least two guide tubes 1 are used, they are preferably placed one above the<br>
other at the same radial location from the center of the fixed-bed catalyst reaction tube<br>
so that the thermowell for temperature sensor remains fixed in the same axial direction<br>
as the reaction tube without being slanted in the reaction tube.<br>
[38]	FIG. 2 is a sectional view of the guide tube 1 and the guide tube legs 2 of the<br>
structure shown in FIG. 1. The inner diameter 11 of the guide tube 1 is preferably as<br>
large as 1.01-2 times the outer diameter of the thermowell, in order to facilitate<br>
movement between the structure and the thermowell. The outer diameter 12 of the<br>
guide tube 1 is not limited to a specific amount, but preferably has a moderate size for<br>
easy catalyst filling. The height 13 of the guide tube 1 may be as large as 0.1~300<br>
times the outer diameter of the thermowell, in order to fix the location of the<br>
thermowell. The shape of the guide tube 1 according to the present invention includes<br>
not only a tube, but also a ring.<br>
[39]	The length and thickness of the guide tube legs 2 have no specific limitation and<br>
can be adjusted as desired. However, the length of the guide tube legs 2 is preferably<br>
adjusted so that, on the same plane, the guide tube and the guide tube legs conform to<br>
the inner diameter of the reaction tube.<br>
[40]	The thickness of the support rods 3 is not limited to a specific amount, but,<br>
considering catalyst filling, the thickness is preferably not too large.<br>
[41]	FIG. 3 shows an example of a structure for guiding the installation of a thermowell<br>
for temperature sensor. The structure includes two guide tubes 1 for fixing the location<br>
of a thermowell for temperature sensor, six guide tube legs 2 connected to the guide<br>
tubes in the horizontal (transverse) direction so as to support them, respectively, (three<br>
guide tube legs are connected to each guide tube), and three support rods 3 connected<br>
to the guide tube legs 2 in the vertical (longitudinal) direction so as to support them, re-<br>
spectively (each support rod is connected to two guide tube legs arranged one above<br>
the other in the axial direction).<br><br>
[42]	When at least two guide tubes 1 are used in the structure, the same number of guide<br>
tube legs 2 are preferably connected to each guide tube, considering the connection<br>
between the guide tube legs 2 and the support rods 3. The total number of the support<br>
rods 3 is preferably equal to the number of guide tube legs 2 connected to each guide<br>
tube 1. Respective support rods 3 may be connected to guide tube legs 2 arranged at<br>
the highest to the lowest location in the axial direction.<br>
[43]	Referring to FIG. 3, when at least two guide tubes 1 are used in the structure, each<br>
support rod 3 may include a support rod ear 31 extending from its upper end to a<br>
portion connected to the highest guide tube leg, a support rod body 32 extending from<br>
the portion connected to the highest guide tube leg to a portion connected to the lowest<br>
guide tube leg, and a support rod foot 33 extending from the portion connected to the<br>
lowest guide tube leg to the lower end.<br>
[44]	The length of the support rod body 32 is not limited to a specific amount, but is<br>
preferably as large as 1-30 times the inner diameter of the fixed-bed catalyst reaction<br>
tube, in order to fix the location of the thermowell for temperature sensor more ef-<br>
ficiently and secure structural stability of the structure itself.<br>
[45]	The length of the support rod ear 31 may correspond to 0.1 -50% of that of the<br>
support rod body 32. The support rod ear 31 may have a hole, into which a wire, for<br>
example, is inserted so that, by manipulating the wire from the outside of the reaction<br>
tube, the structure can be easily moved in the axial direction.<br>
[46]	The length of the support rod foot 33 may correspond to 0.1-50% of that of the<br>
support rod body 32. The support rod foot 33 makes it easy to remove the structure<br>
from the catalyst bed.<br>
[47]	FIG. 4 shows an example of a structure for guiding the installation of a thermowell<br>
for temperature sensor. The structure includes a guide tube 1 for fixing the location of<br>
a thermowell; at least two guide tube legs 2 connected to the guide tube 1 in the<br>
horizontal (transverse) direction so as to support it; a ring 4 connected to the guide tube<br>
legs 2 in the horizontal direction so as to support them; and at least two support rods 3<br>
connected to the guide tube legs 2 or the ring 4 in the vertical (longitudinal) direction<br>
so as to support the guide tube legs 2 or the ring 4.<br>
[48]	Wires, for example, may be inserted into holes on the upper end of the support rods<br>
3 so that the structure can be moved in the axial direction by manipulating the wires<br>
from the outside of the reaction tube.<br>
[49]	The structure, which includes a ring 4, may have at least two guide tubes 1 so that<br>
the location of the thermowell for temperature sensor can be fixed more securely.<br>
[50]	When at least two guide tubes 1 are used, they are preferably placed one above the<br>
other at the same radial location from the center of the fixed-bed catalyst reaction tube<br>
so that the thermowell for temperature sensor remains fixed in the same axial direction<br><br>
as the reaction tube without being slanted in the reaction tube.<br>
[51]	FIG. 5 is a sectional view of the guide tube 1, the guide tube legs 2, and the ring 4<br>
of the structure shown in FIG. 4. The inner diameter 11 of the guide tube 1 is<br>
preferably as large as 1.01-2 times the outer diameter of the thermowell, in order to<br>
facilitate movement between the structure and the thermowell. The outer diameter 12<br>
of the guide tube 1 is not limited to a specific amount, but preferably has a moderate<br>
size for easy catalyst filling. The height 13 of the guide tube 1 may be as large as<br>
0.1-300 times the outer diameter of the thermowell, in order to fix the location of the<br>
thermowell. The shape of the guide tube 1 according to the present invention includes<br>
not only a tube, but also a ring.<br>
[52]	The length and thickness of the guide tube legs 2 have no specific limitation and<br>
can be adjusted as desired. However, the length of the guide tube legs 2 is preferably<br>
adjusted so that, on the same plane, the guide tube and the guide tube legs conform to<br>
the inner diameter of the reaction tube.<br>
[53]	The diameter and thickness of the ring 4 are not limited to a specific amount, but<br>
the maximum diameter of the ring 4 must be smaller than the inner diameter of the<br>
reaction tube so that the structure can enter the reaction tube.<br>
[54]	There is no specific restriction regarding the shape of the ring 4. As non-limiting<br>
examples, the ring 4 may have the shape of a circle, an ellipse, or a polygon having n<br>
angles (n: 3-12). The outer portion of the ring 4, i.e. its shell 41, preferably has the<br>
shape of a circle, an ellipse, or a polygon having n angles (n: 3-12) so as to reduce the<br>
contact area between the ring and the inner wall of the reaction tube.<br>
[55]	The thickness of the support rods 3 is not limited to a specific amount, but,<br>
considering catalyst filling, the thickness is preferably not too large.<br>
[56]	FIG. 6 shows an example of a structure, which includes a ring, for guiding the in-<br>
stallation of a thermowell for temperature sensor according to the present invention.<br>
The structure includes two guide tubes 1 for fixing the location of a thermowell for<br>
temperature sensor; four guide tube legs 2 connected to the guide tubes 1 in the<br>
horizontal (transverse) direction so as to support them, respectively, (two guide tube<br>
legs are connected to each guide tube); two rings 4 connected to the guide tube legs 2<br>
in the horizontal direction so as to support them, respectively; and three support rods 3<br>
connected to the guide tube legs 2 (each support rod is connected to two guide tube<br>
legs arranged one above the other in the axial direction) or to the rings 4 in the vertical<br>
(longitudinal) direction so as to support them, respectively.<br>
[57]	When at least two guide tubes 1 are used in the structure, the support rods 3 may be<br>
connected to the rings 4. Considering this, the number of guide tube legs 2 is not<br>
necessarily the same for each guide tube. In addition, the total number of the support<br>
rods 3 needs not be identical to the number of guide tube legs 2 connected to each<br><br>
guide tube 1.<br>
[58]	When at least two guide tubes 1 are used, the number of the rings 4 is not<br>
necessarily identical to the total number of the guide tubes 1. However, when at least<br>
two rings 4 are employed, the size of the rings 4 preferably varies to a lesser degree so<br>
that the reaction tube can be easily filled with a catalyst. Particularly, the ratio of the<br>
outer diameter of the highest ring to that of the lowest ring is preferably 0.8-1.25 or<br>
4/5-5/4.<br>
[59]	When at least two guide tubes 1 exist, respective support rods 3 may be connected<br>
to guide tube legs 2, which are arranged at the highest to the lowest location in the<br>
axial direction, or to the rings 4.<br>
[60]	Referring to FIG. 6, when at least two guide tubes 1 are used in the structure, each<br>
support rod 3 may include a support rod ear 31 extending from its upper end to a<br>
portion connected to the highest guide tube leg or ring, a support rod body 32<br>
extending from the portion connected to the highest guide tube leg or ring to a portion<br>
connected to die lowest guide tube leg or ring, and a support rod foot 33 extending<br>
from the portion connected to the lowest guide tube leg or ring to the lower end.<br>
[61]	The length of the support rod body 32 is not limited to a specific amount, but is<br>
preferably as large as 1-30 times the inner diameter of the fixed-bed catalyst reaction<br>
tube, in order to fix the location of the thermowell for temperature sensor more ef-<br>
ficiently and secure structural stability of the structure itself.<br>
[62]	The length of the support rod ear 31 may correspond to 0.1 -50% of that of the<br>
support rod body 32. The support rod ear 31 may have a hole, into which a wire, for<br>
example, is inserted into the hole so that, by manipulating the wire from the outside of<br>
the reaction tube, the structure can be easily moved in the axial direction.<br>
[63]	The length of the support rod foot 33 may correspond to 0.1 -50% of that of the<br>
support rod body 32. The support rod foot 33 makes it easy to remove the structure<br>
from the catalyst bed.<br>
[64]	The angle between guide tube legs on different planes (i.e. angle between upper and<br>
lower guide tube legs) is not limited specifically, and may be 0-180°.<br>
[65]	In order to improve the strength of the guide tube 1 and the guide tube legs 2 of the<br>
structure for guiding the installation of a thermowell for temperature sensor according<br>
to the present invention, they may be made of at least one material selected from the<br>
group consisting of nickel, copper, aluminum, titanium, chromium, carbon, iron,<br>
cobalt, molybdenum, gold, silver, vanadium, stainless steel, and an alloy thereof. The<br>
support rods 3 and the rings 4, which make contact with the reaction tube, are<br>
preferably made of a material capable of reducing the friction against the inner wall of<br>
the reaction tube, such as Teflon or engineering plastic. If higher hardness is necessary,<br>
a material containing more carbon is used. Likewise, if high-temperature hardness and<br><br>
resistance to corrosion need to be increased, chromium is added. If toughness and<br>
resistance to corrosion need to be improved, more nickel is used.<br>
[66]	A holding structure according to the present invention includes a holding ring faste<br>
ned beneath the guide tube leg or support rod of the above-mentioned structure for<br>
guiding the installation of a thermowell for temperature sensor so as to hold the guide<br>
structure; and at least three holding feet connected to the holding ring in the vertical<br>
direction so as to support it.<br>
[67]	FIG. 7 shows an example of a holding structure according to the present invention,<br>
which is adapted to hold the guide structure.<br>
[68]	The thickness of the holding ring 5 of the holding structure is not limited to a<br>
specific amount. The maximum diameter of the holding ring 5 must be smaller than the<br>
inner diameter of the reaction tube, but larger than the outer diameter of the<br>
thermowell for temperature sensor. Preferably, the maximum diameter of the holding<br>
ring 5 is smaller than or equal to the horizontal maximum diameter of the guide<br>
structure. In addition, the size of the holding ring 5 must be determined so that it can<br>
move in both directions inside the reaction tube and lift the structure while sustaining it<br>
from below.<br>
[69]	There is no specific restriction regarding the shape of the holding ring 5. As non-<br>
limiting examples, the holding ring 5 may have the shape of a circle, an ellipse, or a<br>
polygon having n angles (n: 3-12). The outer portion of the holding ring 5, i.e. its<br>
shell, preferably has the shape of a circle, an ellipse, or a polygon having n angles (n:<br>
3-12) so as to reduce the contact area between the holding ring and the inner wall of<br>
the reaction tube.<br>
[70]	The holding feet 6 are adapted to support the holding ring 5 and level it. The length<br>
and thickness of the holding feet 6 are not limited to a specific amount, but,<br>
considering catalyst filling, the thickness is preferably not too large.<br>
[71]	The above-mentioned structure for guiding the installation of a thermowell for<br>
temperature sensor, alone or together with the holding structure, is applicable not only<br>
to a case in which a commercial multi-tubular reactor is filled with a catalyst, but also<br>
to a pilot- or laboratory-scale reactor tube. Typical examples of a process using such a<br>
commercial multi-tubular reactor include a process for manufacturing acrolein or<br>
acrylic acid by oxidizing propylene or propane, a process for manufacturing phthalic<br>
anhydride by oxidizing naphthalene or orthoxylene, and a process for manufacturing<br>
maleic anhydride by partially oxidizing benzene, butylene, or butadiene.<br>
[72]	A method for installing a thermowell for temperature sensor according to the<br>
present invention includes a first step of installing a guide structure, which is adapted<br>
to guide the installation of a thermowell for temperature sensor, inside a reaction tube<br>
so as to fix a thermowell, which is used to measure the axial temperature, at a pre-<br><br>
determined location inside a fixed-bed catalyst reaction tube and a second step of<br>
fixing the thermowell for temperature sensor while filling the reaction tube with a<br>
catalyst.<br>
[73]	In the first step of the method, a holding structure may be installed inside the<br>
reaction tube together with the guide structure. The holding structure includes a<br>
holding ring fastened beneath a guide tube leg or support rod of the guide structure so<br>
as to hold it and at least three holding feet connected to the holding ring in the vertical<br>
direction so as to support it.<br>
[74]	The maximum diameter of the holding ring of the holding structure must be smaller<br>
than the inner diameter of the reaction tube, but larger than the outer diameter of the<br>
thermowell for temperature sensor. Preferably, the maximum diameter of the holding<br>
ring is smaller than or equal to the horizontal maximum diameter of the guide<br>
structure.<br>
[75]	The guide structure used in the method for installing a thermowell for temperature<br>
sensor according to the present invention may include a guide tube 1, a guide tube leg<br>
2, and a support rod 3. Alternatively, the guide structure may include a guide tube 1, a<br>
guide tube leg 2, a ring 4, and a support rod 3.<br>
[76]	The method may further include a third step of removing the guide structure from<br>
the reaction tube after the second step. Alternatively, when both a guide structure and a<br>
holding structure have been installed inside the reaction tube, the method may further<br>
include a third step of removing the guide structure and the holding structure from the<br>
reaction tube after the second step.<br>
[77]	In the second step, the guide structure alone or together with the holding structure<br>
may be moved in the axial direction of the reaction tube according to the height of a<br>
catalyst-filled bed, which is created as a result of catalyst filling, so as to fix the<br>
thermowell and measure the height of the catalyst-filled bed. It is not always necessary<br>
to move the guide structure alone or together with the holding structure in the upward<br>
direction during the filling process. However, such a movement is advantageous in that<br>
the thermowell can be fixed at a predetermined location inside the reaction tube more<br>
efficiently. In addition, after the filling process is over, the guide structure alone or<br>
together with the holding structure can be easily removed.<br>
[78]	FIG. 8 briefly shows a method for installing a thermowell for temperature sensor in<br>
a fixed-bed catalyst reaction tube by using the guide structure shown in FIG. 6 while<br>
filling the reaction tube with a catalyst.<br>
[79]	An example of a method for installing a guide structure for guiding the installation<br>
of a thermowell for temperature sensor in a fixed-bed catalyst reaction tube is as<br>
follows: a weight is fitted on top of the guide structure, which is then inserted into the<br>
reaction tube. Due to the weight, the guide structure is easily moved into the reaction<br><br>
tube. The weight is removed before the reaction tube is filled with a catalyst.<br>
[80]	Referring to FIG. 8, when the fixed-bed catalyst reaction tube 200 is filled with a<br>
catalyst, the guide structure 300 is moved in the axial direction of the thermowell for<br>
temperature sensor 100 while continuously fixing the location of the thermowell for<br>
temperature sensor 100 at three spots, particularly spot A on the catalyst bed and spots<br>
B and C on the guide tube. As such, the thermowell for temperature sensor is<br>
accurately fixed at a predetermined location inside the reaction tube.<br>
[81]	FIG. 9 briefly shows a method for installing a thermowell for temperature sensor in<br>
a fixed-bed catalyst reaction tube by using the guide structure shown in FIG. 3 and the<br>
holding structure shown in FIG. 7 while filling the reaction tube with a catalyst.<br>
[82]	The holding structure is used when the fixed-bed catalyst reaction tube has a small<br>
inner diameter or when the guide structure cannot be moved easily. By installing at<br>
least one wire, for example, on at least one portion of the holding structure and ma-<br>
nipulating the wire from the outside of the reaction tube, the guide structure and the<br>
holding structure can be easily moved in the axial direction.<br>
[83]	Referring to FIG. 9, when the fixed-bed catalyst reaction tube 200 is filled with a<br>
catalyst, the guide structure 300 and the holding structure 400 are moved in the axial<br>
direction of the thermowell for temperature sensor 100 while continuously fixing the<br>
location of the thermowell for temperature sensor 100 at three spots, particularly spot<br>
A on the catalyst bed and spots B and C on the guide tube. As such, the thermowell for<br>
temperature sensor is accurately fixed at a predetermined location inside the reaction<br>
tube.<br>
[84]	Referring to FIG. 9, the holding structure 400 is fastened beneath the guide<br>
structure 300 and pulled so that these structures 300 and 400 are moved in the axial<br>
direction. When the fixed-bed catalyst reaction tube has a small inner diameter or when<br>
the guide structure cannot be moved easily, a wire, for example, is connected to the<br>
holding structure 400 and hung down so that the holding structure 400 moves<br>
downwards while the guide structure 300 remains at the same location. As a result, the<br>
distance 500 between the catalyst bed and the guide structure is known. In addition, the<br>
distance 500 between the catalyst bed and the guide structure is maintained uniformly<br>
so that the guide structure 300 is not embedded in the catalyst bed and the holding<br>
structure 400 is positioned on top of the catalyst bed. This informs of the filling level<br>
of the catalyst bed.<br>
[85]	Those skilled in the art can easily understand that it is within the scope of the<br>
present invention to apply the structure for guiding the installation of a thermowell for<br>
temperature sensor, alone or together with the holding structure, to a predetermined<br>
length of tube, besides a thermowell for temperature sensor, when the tube is fixed at a<br>
predetermined location inside a reaction tube in the axial direction.<br><br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
[86]	As can be seen from the foregoing, the structure for guiding the installation of a<br>
thermowell for temperature sensor according to the present invention is advantageous<br>
in that, when the structure is used while a fixed-bed catalyst reaction tube is filled with<br>
a catalyst, it is possible to maintain a constant density of the catalyst-filled bed and<br>
accurately position the thermowell for temperature sensor at a predetermined location.<br>
Therefore, the axial temperature profile of the catalyst-filled bed can be measured ef-<br>
ficiently. In addition, the absence of fixed supports inside the reaction tube makes it<br>
easy to remove the catalyst from the reaction tube for replacement. Since the structure<br>
can be moved according to the height of the catalyst-filled bed during filling, the filling<br>
level of the bed is instantly known.<br>
[87]	While this invention has been described in connection with what is presently<br>
considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood<br>
that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiment and the drawings, but, on<br>
