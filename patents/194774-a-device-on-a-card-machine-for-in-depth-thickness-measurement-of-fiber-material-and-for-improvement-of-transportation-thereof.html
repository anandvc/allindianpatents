The invention relates to a device on a card machine for in-depth thickness measurement and for improvement of transportation thereof. In a known fixture the feed roller has a saw-tooth clothing with pointed teeth. This clothing conforms somewhat to the saw-tooth clothing of the taker-in. The tooth height and the tooth gap height are relatively large, so that the tooth gaps are filled with a lot of fiber material. The tooth tips are aligned against the rotation direction of the feed roller, whereby the rear angle is approx. 30°. In this way the fiber material is drawn in longitudinally over the rear flank of the teeth, i.e. rather tensionally, so that the transporting effect is disadvantageous. Besides, it is also disturbing that the tooth gaps are deep and filed with fiber material, so that disadvantages can occur during measurement of the drawn-in flock nonwoven fleece thickness. Especially due to the fact that only the smaller portion of the fiber material overhanging the tooth tips is determined and not the larger portion which is in the tooth gaps.<br>
It is therefore the task of this invention to create a fixture of a kind mentioned at<br>
the beginning which avoids the said disadvantages, which would especially lead<br>
to an improved transportation of the fiber material and a more precise<br>
determination of material fluctuations of the drawn-in fiber material.<br>
Accordingly to the features of the invention, the above-mentioned problems of<br>
the prior art is solved, because the tooth height above the roller surface and the<br>
tooth gap heights are small, a low filing volume of fiber material is possible in the<br>
tooth gaps, i.e. the device for measuring thickness variations of the fiber material<br>
can determine the fiber material to the complete extent. The rear angle of 90° or<br>
almost 90° allows a rather shape-bound taking along and hence a significantly<br>
improved transportation of the fiber material in the direction of the taker-in. The<br>
combination as per the invention between the shape of the teeth with<br>
rectangular flanks and low measurements allows in a very advantageous manner<br>
an improvement of the transportation as well as the thickness measurement of<br>
the fiber material. In spite of small	<br><br>
teeth, the fibre material is very effectively taken along due to the large rear angle and because of small teeth and teeth gaps it is possible to determine with certainty the mass of the fibre material during measurement. Because the tooth pitch and the pitch traverse for achieving an open space around the teeth are large, i.e. wide and not deep, the undesirable feeding in of the fibre material-between the teeth and coiling of the clothing can be avoided.<br>
Ideally the front angle a should be 0° or almost 0°. The wedge angle ß should preferably be 0° or almost 0°, The tooth pitch t should preferably be about 2.45mm to 2.85mm. The tooth gap should preferably be designed in a somewhat semicircular shape. The tooth radius x, at both ends of the tooth gaps is somewhat designed in the shape of a quadrant. The tooth ladius r, should preferably be above 0.6mm. It is advantageous to have the tip length 1, greater than 0.5mm. The tooth gap height h3 is about 0.6mm to 1 5mm. The tooth height h2 should preferably be about 0.8mm to 1.5mm. It is advantageous to keep the tip width bF greater than 0.2mm and lesser than lmm. The foot width bF.- should be greater than I mm and lesser than 4mm. Ideally the foot width bF should be 2mm. The tooth density T should preferably be about 3.5 to 4.0/cm. The number of warper bands z should be 4.8 to 5.2/cm. The occupation density B should preferably be about 18.5 to 19.5/cm2. To suithe purpose, the feed toiler and the taker-in have opposite directions of minimums The feed roller and taker in should preferably have the same direction of rotation. The saw-tooth clothing is used in the draw-in roller of a flock feeding fixture for a card or a cleaner. The saw-tooth clothing is preferably used in the draw-in roller and for an opener or cleaner. To suit the purpose, a device for measuring thickness fluctuations of the fibre material is allocated to the feed roller.<br>
The invention is described in details below on the basis of a design example depicted in the<br><br>
'accompanying drawing.<br>
The following are shown:<br>
Fig. 1 Schematically in side view, card with feed roller and a flock feeder with draw-in roller,<br>
Fig.2 The saw-tooth clothing on the feed roller as per the invention, which is arranged<br>
between the lower end of the reserve chute and the taker-in; Fig.3 The tooth-saw clothing as per the invention on the feed roller, to which a feed-table<br>
and a device for measuring thickness fluctuations of the drawn-in fibre material are<br>
allocated,<br><br>

Fig.4 The saw-tooth clothing as per the invention on the draw-in roller of the card feeder,<br>
which works together with the opener roller; Fig.5a Side view of the saw-tooth clothing as per the invention; Fig. 5b Section according to I-I through two teeth of the saw-tooth clothing as per the<br>
invention as shown in fig.5a and arranged beside one another with an intermediate wire;<br>
and Fig. 5c The teeth as shown in fig. 5b without intermediate wire.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a card 17, e.g. Trutzschler EXACTACARD DK 803 with feed roller 1, feed-table 2, takers-in 3a, 3b, 3c, drums 4, taker 5, stripper roller 6, crushing rollers 7, 8, fleece guiding element 9, weft funnel 10, take-up rollers 11, 12, moving cover 13 with cover rods 14, can 15 and can stock 16. The direction of rotation of the rollers arc indicated by curved arrows. The slow-running feed roller 1 is equipped with the saw-tooth clothing as per the invention (see fig. 2 to 5). A card feeder 18, e.g. Trutzschler DIRECTFEED is preconnected to the card 17 (see fig. 4).<br>
According to fig. 2 the feed roller 1 rotates in the direction of the arrow A and the quick-moving taker-in 3a rotates in the direction of the arrow B. In the feed roller 1 the clothing 1' is wound on the roller body 1" as endless saw-tooth wire. The feed roller 1 draws the (not shown) fibre flock from the feeder chute 30 of the card feeder 18 and transports the fibre flocks through the clearance between the clothing 1' and the trough surface 2' of the feeder-table 2 in the direction on to the taker-in 3a which further transports the fibre Hocks. The taker-in 3a is equipped with short needles 3'.<br>
According to fig. 3, the area 2' of the passing trough of the one-piece feeder table 2 forms along with the clothing 1' of the feed roller 1 a clamping split 19. The feeder table 2 is supported by a spring 20 against the machine structure, so that a bypassing in case of especially strong thick points or alien bodies is possible. The spring-tension (spring 22) holding element 21 (summing bar) is similarly supported continuously and in a rotatable manner against the fixed structure of the machine for the purpose of measurement and filling of the fibre material. The flat springs 14a to 14n are fastened at one of their ends to the holding element 21 The flat springs 14a to 14n are simultaneously clamping springs for the fibre materials. The free ends of the flat springs 14a to I4n lift during operation from the front side 2" of the feeder table 2 and the clothing 1', The device for measuring thickness fluctuations of the fibre<br><br>
5<br>
material can be designed, for example, according to the German patent application P43 34 035.0.<br>
According fig. 4, a vertical reserve chute 23 is foreseen before the card 17, which is fed from above with fine dissoved fibre material. The feeding can take place for example though a condensor or through a feeding and distribution line. In the upper region of the reserve chute 23 there are openings for air exit 25, through which transporting air G enters (arrow H) after separation of the fibre flock from and in a suction device 26. The lower end of the lower chute 23 is closed by a draw-in roller 27, which works along with a drawn-in trough 28 The draw-in roller 27 is equipped with the saw-tooth clothing 27' as per the invention, which is wound on to the roller base body 27" in the form of an endless saw-tooth wire. The slow-running draw-in roller 27 rotates in the direction of the arrow C. By means of the (haw-in roller 27 the fihrc material from the reserve chute 23 is fed to a fast-running opener roller 29 which is below it and is provided with pins 29' or saw-tooth wire, which on one portion on its circumference is in connection with a lower feed chute 30. The opener roller 29 minting in the direction of the arrow D transports the fibre material determined by it into the feed chute 30. The feed chute 30 has a feed roller 1 at its lower end, which presents the fibre material to the card 17. This card feeder can, for example, be a Trutzschler card feeder DIRECTFEED of the company Trutzschler, Monchenglasbach. The draw-in roller 27 rotates slowly in clockwise direction (arrow C) and the opener roller 25 rotates in anti-clockwise direction (arrow D) so that a oposite direction of rotation is realized. The taker-in 4 is provided with an endless saw-tooth clothing 3".<br>
The figs. 5a, 5b show the geomatric data of the saw-tooth clothing 1' as per the invention. The designations/codes have been selected according to DIN 64 125.<br>
In fig. 5a the saw-tooth roller 1' is depicted as stretched wire which has several teeth 1' with the heigh h1, e.g. 2.5mm. Each tooth 1'1 has at the tooth tip l'4 a short straight zone l5, e.g. 0.6 to 1.5mm, which is aligned parallel to the foot level 1'9 of the tooth base 1'2. Furthermore, each tooth l'1 has a tooth front 1'5 and a tooth rear 1'6. The front angle a is 0°. The angle 5, i.e. the angle between the straight zone of the tooth tip 1'4 and the vertical with respect to the foot level 1'9 of the tooth base 1'2 is 90°. The rear angle ?, i.e the angle between the straight zone 1'4 and the verticle is 90°. The tooth region above the tooth base l'2 is denoted by 1'3 Between a tooth front 1'5 and tooth rear 1'6 of two adjacent teeth 1' there is a tooth gap 1'7<br><br>
6<br>
The tooth gap 1'7 has two somewhat quadrant-shaped arcs and a flat gap base 1'8 connecting both arcs. The radii of both arcs of the tooth gaps l'7 are identical with the tooth radii r'/ or r"z, e.g. approx. 0.6mm. The tooth gap height hi is, for example, approx. 0.6mm to 1.5mm The tooth pitch t (on the stretched wire) is approx. 2.45mm to 2.85mm.<br>
Both the teeth 1'1 shown in section in fig. 5b have a pitch traves P. Between the teeth 1'1 a spacer wire 31 is arranged which is also endlessly wound on to the roller body I" like the sawtooth clothing 1'. The teeth 1'1 can however also be arranged according to fig. 5c immediately against one another without any clearance between them. The tip width be of the tooth 1'1 can, for example, be greater than 0.2mm and lesser than I mm. The base width bF.- of the tooth 1'1 can be greater than 1mm and lesser than 4mm, e.g. 2mm. The tooth density T 10/t can be approx. 3.5 to 4.0/cm. The number of warper bands z = 10/bF can be approx 4.8 to 5.2/cni. The occupation density = GxT can be approx. 18.5 to 19.5 cm2.<br>
During operation, the (not shown) fibre material is transported with the tooth rear 1'6 through the clearance 19 (fig. 3) in the direction of the taker-in 3a. The tooth gaps 1'7 are filled with fibre material. The flat springs 14a to 14n (fig. 3) scan the fibre material overhanging the tooth gaps 1'7 and the tooth tips 1'4.<br>
The invention has been depicted on the example of the saw-tooth clothing I for the feed roller I of a card 17 and for the draw-feed roller 27 of a card feeder 18. The saw-tooth clothing 1' as per the invention can be also used in the draw-in toller of an opener or cleaner in blow room<br><br>
