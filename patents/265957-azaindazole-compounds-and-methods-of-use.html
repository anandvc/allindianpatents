AZAINDAZOLE COMPOUNDS AND METHODS OF USE<br>
CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/693,525<br>
filed on June 22, 2005, the contents of which is incorporated herein in its entirety for all<br>
purposes.<br>
STATEMENT AS TO RIGHTS TO INVENTIONS MADE UNDER<br>
FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT<br>

REFERENCE TO A "SEQUENCE LISTING," A TABLE, OR A COMPUTER<br>
PROGRAM LISTING APPENDIX SUBMITTED ON A COMPACT DISK.<br>
[0003] NOT APPLICABLE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004] The present invention provides compounds, pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing one or more of those compounds or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, which<br>
are effective in inhibiting the binding of various chemokines, such as MIP-1 a, leukotactin,<br>
MPIF-1 and RANTES, to the CCR1 receptor. As antagonists or modulators for the CCR1<br>
receptor, the compounds and compositions have utility in treating inflammatory and immune<br>
disorder conditions and diseases.<br>
[0005] Human health depends on the body's ability to detect and destroy foreign pathogens<br>
that might otherwise take valuable resources from the individual and/or induce illness. The<br>
immune system, which comprises leukocytes (white blood cells (WBCs): T and B<br>
lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages granulocytes, NK cell, mast cells, dendritic ceil, and<br>
immune derived cells (for example, osteoclasts)), lymphoid tissues and lymphoid vessels, is<br>
the body's defense system. To combat infection, white blood cells circulate throughout the<br>
body to detect pathogens. Once a pathogen is detected, innate immune cells and cytotoxic T<br>
cells in particular are recruited to the infection site to destroy the pathogen. Chemokines act<br>
as molecular beacons for the recruitment and activation of immune cells, such as<br>
lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes, identifying sites where pathogens exist.<br>
[0006] Despite the immune system's regulation of pathogens, certain inappropriate<br>
chemokine signaling can develop and has been attributed to triggering or sustaining<br><br>
WO 2007/002293	PCT/US2006/024313<br>
inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and others. For<br>
example, in rheumatoid arthritis, unregulated chemokine accumulation in bone joints attracts<br>
and activates infiltrating macrophages and T-cells. The activities of these cells induce<br>
synovial cell proliferation that leads, at least in part, to inflammation and eventual bone and<br>
cartilage loss (see, DeVries, M.E., et al., Semin Immunol ll(2):95-104 (1999)). A hallmark<br>
of some demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis is the chemokine-mediated<br>
monocyte/macrophage and T cell recruitment to the central nervous system (see, Kennedy, et<br>
al.,7. Clin. Immunol. 19(5):273-279 (1999)). Chemokine recruitment of destructive WBCs<br>
to transplants has been implicated in their subsequent rejection. See, DeVries, M.E., et al.,<br>
ibid. Because chemokines play pivotal roles in inflammation and lymphocyte development,<br>
the ability to specifically manipulate their activity has enormous impact on ameliorating and<br>
halting diseases that currently have no satisfactory treatment. In addition, transplant rejection<br>
may be minimized without the generalized and complicating effects of costly<br>
imrnunosuppressive pharmaceuticals.<br>
[0007] Chemokines, a group of greater than 40 small peptides (7-10 kD), ligate receptors<br>
expressed primarily on WBCs or immune derived cells, and signal through G-protein-coupled<br>
signaling cascades to mediate their chemoattractant and chemostimulant functions.<br>
Receptors may bind more than one ligand; for example, the receptor CCR1 ligates RANTES<br>
(regulated on activation normal T cell expressed), MlP-1α (macrophage inflammatory<br>
protein), MPIF-1/CKP8, and Leukotactin chemokines (among others with lesser affinities).<br>
To date, 24 chemokine receptors are known. The sheer number of chemokines, multiple<br>
ligand binding receptors, and different receptor profiles on immune cells allow for tightly<br>
controlled and specific immune responses. See, Rossi, et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol.<br>
18(l):217-242 (2000). Chemokine activity can be controlled through the modulation of their<br>
corresponding receptors, treating related inflammatory and immunological diseases and<br>
enabling organ and tissue transplants.<br>
[0008] The receptor CCR1 and its chemokine ligands, including, for example MDP- 1α,<br>
MPIF-1/CKP8, leukotactin and RANTES, represent significant therapeutic targets (see Saeki,<br>
et al., Current Pharmaceutical Design 9:1201-1208 (2003)) since they have been implicated<br>
in rheumatoid arthritis, transplant rejection (see, DeVries, M.E., et al., ibid.), and multiple<br>
sclerosis (see, Fischer, et al., JNeuroimmunol. 110(1-2): 195-208 (2000); Izikson, et al., J.<br>
Exp. Med. 192(7):1075-l080 (2000); and Rottman, et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 30(8):2372-<br>
2377 (2000). In fact, function-blocking antibodies, modified chemokine receptor ligands and<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2007/002293	PCT/US2006/024313<br>
small organic compounds have been discovered, some of which have been successfully<br>
demonstrated to prevent or treat some chemokine-mediated diseases (reviewed in Rossi, et<br>
al., ibid). Notably, in an experimental model of rheumatoid arthritis, disease development is<br>
diminished when a signaling-blocking, modified-RANTES ligand is administered (see Plater-<br>
Zyberk, et al., Immunol Lett. 57(1-3): 117-120 (1997)). While function-blocking antibody<br>
and small peptide therapies are promising, they suffer from the perils of degradation,<br>
extremely short half-lives once administered, and prohibitive expense to develop and<br>
manufacture, characteristic of most proteins. Small organic compounds are preferable since<br>
they often have longer half lives in vivo, require fewer doses to be effective, can often be<br>
administered orally, and are consequently less expensive. Some organic antagonists of CCR1<br>
have been previously described (see, Hesselgesser, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 273(25): 15687-<br>
15692 (1998); Ng, et al.,J Meet. Chem. 42(22):4680-4694 (1999); Liang, et al.,J. Biol.<br>
Chem. 275(25):19000-19008 (2000); and Liang, et al, Eur. J. Pharmacol. 389(l):41-49<br>
(2000)). In view of the effectiveness demonstrated for treatment of disease in animal models<br>
(see, Liang, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 275(25):19000-19008 (2000)), the search has continued to<br>
identify additional compounds that can be used in the treatment of diseases mediated by<br>
CCR1 signaling.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0015] NONE<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
I. Abbreviation and Definitions<br>
[0016] The term "alkyl", by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise<br>
stated, a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon radical, having the number of carbon atoms<br>
designated (i.e. C1-8 means one to eight carbons). Examples of alkyl groups include methyl,<br>
ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-<br>
octyl, and the like. The term "alkenyl" refers to an unsaturated alkyl group having one or<br>
more double bonds. Similarly, the term "alkynyl" refers to an unsaturated alkyl group having<br>
one or more triple bonds. Examples of such unsaturated alkyl groups include vinyl, 2-<br>
propenyl, crotyl, 2-isopentenyl, 2-(butadienyl), 2,4-pentadienyl, 3-(1,4-pentadienyl), ethynyl,<br>
1- and 3-propynyl, 3-butynyl, and the higher homologs and isomers. The term "cycloalkyl"<br>
refers to hydrocarbon rings having the indicated number of ring atoms (e.g., C3-6cycloalkyl)<br>
and being fully saturated or having no more than one double bond between ring vertices.<br>
"Cycloalkyl" is also meant to refer to bicyclic and polycyclic hydrocarbon rings such as, for<br>
example, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, etc. The term "heterocycloalkyl"<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2007/002293	PCT/US2006/024313<br>
refers to a cycloalkyl group that contain from one to five heteroatoms selected from N, O, and<br>
S, wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen atom(s) are<br>
optionally quaternized. The heterocycloalkyl may be a monocyclic, a bicyclic or a polycylic<br>
ring system. Non limiting examples of heterocycloalkyl groups include pyrrolidine,<br>
piperidinyl, imidazolidine, pyrazolidine, butyrolactam, valerolactam, imidazolidinone,<br>

heterocycloalkyl group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a ring<br>
carbon or a heteroatom.<br>
[0017] The term "alkylene" by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent<br>
radical derived from an alkane, as exemplified by -CH2CH2CH2CH2-. Typically, an alkyl (or<br>
alkylene) group will have from 1 to 24 carbon atoms, with those groups having 10 or fewer<br>
carbon atoms being preferred in the present invention. A "lower alkyl" or "lower alkylene" is<br>
a shorter chain alkyl or alkylene group, generally having four or fewer carbon atoms.<br>
Similarly, "alkenylene" and "alkynylene" refer to the unsaturated forms of "alkylene" having<br>
double or triple bonds, respectively.<br>
[0018] The terms "alkoxy," "alkylamino" and "alkylthio" (or thioalkoxy) are used in their<br>
conventional sense, and refer to those alkyl groups attached to the remainder of the molecule<br>
via an oxygen atom, an amino group, or a sulfur atom, respectively. Additionally, for<br>
dialkylamino groups, the alkyl portions can be the same or different and can also be<br>
combined to form a 3-7 membered ring with the nitrogen atom to which each is attached.<br>
Accordingly, a group represented as -NRaRb is meant to include piperidinyl, pyrrolidinyl,<br>
morpholinyl, azetidinyl and the like.<br>
[0019] The terms "halo" or "halogen," by themselves or as part of another substituent,<br>
mean, unless otherwise stated, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. Additionally,<br>
terms such as "haloalkyl," are meant to include monohaloalkyl and polyhaloalkyl. For<br>
example, the term "C1-4 haloalkyl" is mean to include trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 4-<br>
chlorobutyl, 3-bromopropyl, and the like.<br>
[0020] The term "aryl" means, unless otherwise stated, a polyunsaturated, typically<br>
aromatic, hydrocarbon group which can be a single ring or multiple rings (up to three rings)<br>
which are fused together or linked covalently. The term "heteroaryl" refers to aryl groups (or<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2007/002293	PCT/US2006/024313<br>
rings) that contain from one to five heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S, wherein the<br>
nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen atom(s) are optionally<br>
quaternized. A heteroaryl group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a<br>
heteroatom. Non-limiting examples of aryl groups include phenyl, naphthyl and biphenyl,<br>
while non-limiting examples of heteroaryl groups include pyridyl, pyridazinyl, pyrazinyl,<br>
pyrimindinyl, triazinyl, quinolinyl, quinoxalinyl, quinazolinyl, cinnolinyl, phthalaziniyl,<br>
benzotriazinyl, purinyl, benzimidazolyl, benzopyrazolyl, benzotriazolyl, benzisoxazolyl,<br>
isobenzofuryl, isoindolyl, indolizinyl, benzotriazinyl, thienopyridinyl, thienopyrimidinyl,<br>

tetrazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiadiazolyl, pyrrolyl, thiazolyl, furyl, thienyl and the like.<br>
Substituents for each of the above noted aryl and heteroaryl ring systems are selected from<br>
the group of acceptable substituents described below.<br>
[0021] For brevity, the term "aryl" when used in combination with other terms (e.g.,<br>
aryloxy, arylthioxy, arylalkyl) includes both aryl and heteroaryl rings as defined above.<br>
Thus, the term "arylalkyl" is meant to include those radicals in which an aryl group is<br>
attached to an alkyl group (e.g., benzyl, phenethyl, pyridylmethyl and the like).<br>
[0022] The above terms (e.g., "alkyl," "aryl" and "heteroaryl"), in some embodiments, will<br>
include both substituted and unsubstituted forms of the indicated radical. Preferred<br>
substituents for each type of radical are provided below. For brevity, the terms aryl and<br>
heteroaryl will refer to substituted or unsubstituted versions as provided below, while the<br>
term "alkyl" and related aliphatic radicals is meant to refer to unsubstituted version, unless<br>
indicated to be substituted.<br>
[0023] Substituents for the alkyl radicals (including those groups often referred to as<br>
alkylene, alkenyl, alkynyl and cycloalkyl) can be a variety of groups selected from: -halogen,<br>
-OR', -NR'R", -SR', -SiR'R"R"' -OC(O)R', -C(O)R', -CO2R', -CONR'R", -OC(O)NR'R",<br>

ranging from zero to (2 m'+1), where m' is the total number of carbon atoms in such radical.<br>
R', R" and R'" each independently refer to hydrogen, unsubstituted C1-8 alkyl, unsubstituted<br>
heteroalkyl, unsubstituted aryl, aryl substituted with 1-3 halogens, unsubstituted C1-8 alkyl,<br>
C1-8 alkoxy or C1-8 thioalkoxy groups, or unsubstituted aryl-C1-4 alkyl groups. When R' and<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2007/002293	PCT/US2006/024313<br>
R" are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to<br>
form a 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. For example, -NR'R" is meant to include 1-<br>
pyrrolidinyl and 4-morpholinyl.<br>
[0024] Similarly, substituents for the aryl and heteroaryl groups are varied and are<br>
generally selected from: -halogen, -OR', -OC(O)R', -NR'R", -SR', -R', -CN, -NO2, -CO2R',<br>
-CONR'R", -C(O)R', -OC(O)NR'R", -NR"C(O)R', -NR"C(O)2R', -NR'-C(O)NR"R"',<br>
-NH-C(NH2)=NH, -NR'C(NH2)=NH, -NH-C(NH2)==NR', -S(O)R', -S(O)2R', -S(O)2NR'R",<br>
-NR'S(O)2R", -N3, perfluoro(C1-C4)alkoxy, and perfiuoro(C1-C4)alkyl, in a number ranging<br>
from zero to the total number of open valences on the aromatic ring system; and where R', R"<br>
and R'" are independently selected from hydrogen, C1-8 alkyl, C3-6 cycloalkyl, C2-8 alkenyl,<br>
C2-8 alkynyl, unsubstituted aryl and heteroaryl, (unsubstituted aryl)-C1-4 alkyl, and<br>
unsubstituted aryloxy-C1-4 alkyl. Other suitable substituents include each of the above aryl<br>
substituents attached to a ring atom by an alkylene tether of from 1-4 carbon atoms.<br>
[0025] Two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may<br>
optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -T-C(O)-(CH2)q-U-, wherein T and U<br>
are independently -NH-, -O-, -CH2- or a single bond, and q is an integer of from 0 to 2.<br>
Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may<br>
optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -A-(CH2)r-B-, wherein A and B are<br>
independently -CH2-, -O-, -NH-, -S-, -S(O)-, -S(O)2-, -S(O)2NR'- or a single bond, and r is an<br>
integer of from 1 to 3. One of the single bonds of the new ring so formed may optionally be<br>
replaced with a double bond. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the<br>
aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -(CH2)S-<br>
X-(CH2)r, where s and t are independently integers of from 0 to 3, and X is -O-, -NR'-, -S-, -<br>
S(O)-, -S(O)2-, or -S(O)2NR'-. The substituent R' in -NR'- and -S(O)2NR'- is selected from<br>
hydrogen or unsubstituted C1-6 alkyl.<br>
[0026] As used herein, the term "heteroatom" is meant to include oxygen (O), nitrogen (N),<br>
sulfur (S) and silicon (Si).<br>
[0027] The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" is meant to include salts of the active<br>
compounds which are prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases, depending on the<br>
particular substituents found on the compounds described herein. When compounds of the<br>
present invention contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained<br>
by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2007/002293	PCT/US2006/024313<br>
base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of salts derived from<br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper,<br>
ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic, manganous, potassium, sodium, zinc and the<br>
like. Salts derived from pharmaceutically-acceptable organic bases include salts of primary,<br>
secondary and tertiary amines, including substituted amines, cyclic amines, naturally-<br>
occuring amines and the like, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, N,N'-<br>

piperazine, piperadine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine,<br>
trimethylamine, tripropylamine, tromethamine and the like. When compounds of the present<br>
invention contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by<br>
contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired acid,<br>
either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid<br>
addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic,<br>
nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric,<br>
dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and<br>
the like, as well as the salts derived from relatively nontoxic organic acids like acetic,<br>
propionic, isobutyric, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, mandelic, phthalic,<br>
benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic, and the like. Also included<br>
are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like, and salts of organic acids like<br>
glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like (see, for example, Berge, S.M., et al,<br>
"Pharmaceutical Salts", Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 1977, 66, 1-19). Certain specific<br>
compounds of the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow<br>
the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.<br>
[0028] The neutral forms of the compounds may be regenerated by contacting the salt with<br>
a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional manner. The parent<br>
form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such<br>
as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to the parent form of the<br>
compound for the purposes of the present invention.<br>
[0029] In addition to salt forms, the present invention provides compounds which are in a<br>
prodrug form. Prodrugs of the compounds described herein are those compounds that readily<br>
undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compounds of the<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2007/002293	PCT/US2006/024313<br>
present invention. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compounds of the present<br>
invention by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment. For example,<br>
prodrugs can be slowly converted to the compounds of the present invention when placed in a<br>
transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent.<br>
[0030] Certain compounds of the present invention can exist in unsolvated forms as well as<br>
solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms are equivalent to<br>
unsolvated forms and are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present<br>
invention. Certain compounds of the present invention may exist in multiple crystalline or<br>
amorphous forms. In general, all physical forms are equivalent for the uses contemplated by<br>
the present invention and are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0031] Certain compounds of the present invention possess asymmetric carbon atoms<br>
(optical centers) or double bonds; the racemates, diastereomers, geometric isomers,<br>
regioisomers and individual isomers (e.g., separate enantiomers) are all intended to be<br>
encompassed within the scope of the present invention. The compounds of the present<br>
invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of the<br>
atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled<br>
with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (3H), iodine-125 (125I) or carbon-14<br>
(14C). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive<br>
or not, are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention.<br>
II.	General<br>
[0032] The present invention derives from the discovery that compounds of formula Ia or<br>
Ib (as well as the subgeneric formulae Ia1-4 and Ib1-4 ) act as potent antagonists of the CCR1<br>
receptor. The compounds have in vivo anti-inflammatory activity. Accordingly, the<br>
compounds provided herein are useful in pharmaceutical compositions, methods for the<br>
treatment of CCR1 -mediated diseases, and as controls in assays for the identification of<br>
competitive CCR1 antagonists.<br>

IV. Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
[0082] In addition to the compounds provided above, compositions for modulating CCR1<br>
activity in humans and animals will typically contain a pharmaceutical earner or diluent.<br>
[0083] The term "composition" as used herein is intended to encompass a product<br>
comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which<br>
results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified<br>
amounts. By "pharmaceutically acceptable" it is meant the carrier, diluent or excipient must<br>
be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the<br>
recipient thereof.<br>
[0084] The pharmaceutical compositions for the administration of the compounds of this<br>
invention may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of<br>
the methods well known in the art of pharmacy and drug delivery. All methods include the<br>
step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier which constitutes one or<br>
more accessory ingredients. In general, the pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by<br>
uniformly and intimately bringing the active ingredient into association with a liquid carrier<br>
or a finely divided solid carrier or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the<br>
desired formulation. In the pharmaceutical composition the active object compound is<br>
included in an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect upon the process or condition<br>
of diseases.<br>
[0085] The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form<br>
suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions,<br>
dispersible powders or granules, emulsions and self emulsifications as described in U.S.<br>
Patent Application 2002-0012680, hard or soft capsules, syrups, elixirs, solutions, buccal<br>
patch, oral gel chewing gum, chewable tablets, effervescent powder and effervescent tablets.<br>
Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the<br>
art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain<br>
one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents,<br>
coloring agents, antioxidants and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically<br>
elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with<br>
non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of<br>
tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as cellulose, silicon<br>
dioxide, aluminum oxide, calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, glucose, mannitol, sorbitol,<br>
38<br><br>
WO 2007/002293	PCT/US2006/024313<br>
lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for<br>
example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example PVP, cellulose, PEG,<br>
starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid<br>
or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated, enterically or otherwise, by<br>
known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and<br>
thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material<br>
such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be<br>
coated by the techniques described in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and<br>
4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release.<br>
[0086] Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein<br>
the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate,<br>
calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is<br>
mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.<br>
Additionally, emulsions can be prepared with a non-water miscible ingredient such as oils<br>
and stabilized with surfactants such as mono-diglycerides, PEG esters and the like.<br>
[0087] Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients<br>
suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents,<br>
for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxy-<br>
propylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum<br>
acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example<br>
lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxy-<br>
ethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic<br>
alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetartol, or condensation products of ethylene<br>
oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene<br>
sorbitol monooleate. or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived<br>
from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The<br>
aqueous suspensions may also contain one or.more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-<br>
propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and<br>
one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.<br>
[0088] Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a<br>
vegetable oil, for example aracbis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil<br>
such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example<br>
39<br><br>
WO 2007/002293	PCT/US2006/024313<br>
beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and<br>
flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions<br>
may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
[0089] Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension<br>
by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or<br>
wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or<br>
wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above.<br>
Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be<br>

combination with, for example, cyclodextrin, PEG and surfactants.<br>
[0092] The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous<br>
or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art<br>
using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been<br>

or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a<br>
solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be<br>
employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition,<br>
sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this<br>

V. Methods of Treating Diseases Modulated by CCR1<br>
[0095] In yet another aspect, the present invention provides methods of treating CCR1 -<br>
mediated conditions or diseases by administering to a subject having such a disease or<br>
condition, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I above. The<br>
"subject" is defined herein to include animals such as mammals, including, but not limited to,<br>
primates (e.g., humans), cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, rats, mice and the<br>
like.<br>
41<br><br>
WO 2007/002293	PCT/US2006/024313<br>
[0096] CCR1 provides a target for interfering with or promoting specific aspects of<br>
immune cell functions, or more generally, with functions associated with CCR1 expression<br>
on a wide range of cell types in a mammal, such as a human. Compounds that inhibit CCR1,<br>
are particularly useful for modulating monocyte, macrophage, lymphocyte, granulocyte, NK<br>
cell, mast cells, dendritic cell, neutrophils, and certain immune derived cell (for example,<br>
osteoclasts) function for therapeutic purposes. Accordingly, the present invention is directed<br>
to compounds which are useful in the prevention and/or treatment of a wide variety of<br>
inflammatory and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases (see Saeki, et al., Current<br>
Pharmaceutical Design 9:1201-1208 (2003)).<br>
[0097] For example, an instant compound that inhibits one or more functions of CCR1 may<br>
be administered to inhibit (i.e., reduce or prevent) inflammation or cellular infiltration<br>
associated with an immune disorder. As a result, one or more inflammatory processes, such<br>
as leukocyte emigration or infiltration, chemotaxis, exocytosis (e.g., of enzymes, histamine)<br>
or inflammatory mediator release, can be inhibited. For example, monocyte infiltration to an<br>
inflammatory site (e.g., an affected joint in arthritis, or into the CNS in MS) can be inhibited<br>
according to the present method.<br>
[0098] Similarly, an instant compound that promotes one or more functions of CCR1 is<br>
administered to stimulate (induce or enhance) an inflammatory response, such as leukocyte<br>
emigration, chemotaxis, exocytosis (e.g., of enzymes, histamine) or inflammatory mediator<br>
release, resulting in the beneficial stimulation of inflammatory processes. For example,<br>
monocytes can be recruited to combat bacterial infections.<br>
[0099] Diseases and conditions associated with inflammation, immune disorders and<br>
infection can be treated using the method of the present invention. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the disease or condition is one in which the actions of immune cells such<br>
monocyte, macrophage, lymphocyte, granulocyte, NK cell, mast cell, dendritic cell, or certain<br>
immune derived cell (for example, osteoclasts) are to be inhibited or promoted, in order to<br>
modulate the inflammatory or autoimmune response.<br>
[0100] In one group of embodiments, diseases or conditions, including chronic diseases, of<br>
humans or other species can treated with modulators of CCR1 function. These diseases or<br>
conditions include: (1) allergic diseases such as systemic anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity<br>
responses, drug allergies, insect sting allergies and food allergies, (2) inflammatory bowel<br>
diseases, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, ileitis and enteritis, (3) vaginitis,<br>
42<br><br>
WO 2007/002293	PCT/US2006/024313<br>
(4) psoriasis and inflammatory dermatoses such as dermatitis, eczema, atopic dermatitis,<br>
allergic contact dermatitis, urticaria and pruritus, (5) vasculitis, (6) spondyloarthropathies,<br>
(7) scleroderma, (8) asthma and respiratory allergic diseases such as allergic asthma, allergic<br>
rhinitis, hypersensitivity lung diseases and the like, (9) autoimmune diseases, such as<br>
fibromyalagia, scleroderma, ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile RA, Still's disease, polyarticular<br>
juvenile RA, pauciarticular juvenile RA, polymyalgia rheumatica, rheumatoid arthritis,<br>
psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, polyarticular arthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus<br>
erythematosus, type I diabetes, type II diabetes, glomerulonephritis, and the like, (10) graft<br>
rejection (including allograft rejection and graft-v-host disease), and (11) other diseases in<br>
which undesired inflammatory responses or immune disorders are to be inhibited, such as<br>
cardiovascular disease including atherosclerosis and restenosis, myositis, neurodegenerative<br>
diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), encephalitis, meningitis, hepatitis, nephritis, sepsis,<br>
sarcoidosis, allergic conjunctivitis, otitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sinusitis,<br>
Behcet's syndrome and gout and (12) immune mediated food allergies such as Celiac disease.<br>
[0101] In another group of embodiments, diseases or conditions can be treated with<br>
modulators of CCR1 function. Examples of diseases to be treated with modulators of CCR1<br>
function include cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diseases in which angiogenesis or<br>
neovascularization play a role (neoplastic diseases, retinopathy and macular degeneration),<br>
infectious diseases (viral infections, e.g., HIV infection, and bacterial infections) and<br>
immunosuppressive diseases such as organ transplant conditions and skin transplant<br>
conditions. The term "organ transplant conditions" is meant to include bone marrow<br>
transplant conditions and solid organ (e.g., kidney, liver, lung, heart, pancreas or combination<br>
thereof) transplant conditions.<br>
[0102] The compounds of the present invention are accordingly useful in the prevention<br>
and treatment of a wide variety of inflammatory and immunoregulatory disorders and<br>
diseases.<br>
[0103] Depending on the disease to be treated and the subject's condition, the compounds<br>
of the present invention may be administered by oral, parenteral (e.g., intramuscular,<br>
intraperitoneal, intravenous, ICV, intracisternal injection or infusion, subcutaneous injection,<br>
or implant), by implantation (e.g., as when the compound is coupled to a stent device), by<br>
inhalation spray, nasal, vaginal, rectal, sublingual, or topical routes of administration and may<br>
be formulated, alone or together, in suitable dosage unit formulations containing conventional<br>
43<br><br>
WO 2007/002293	PCT/US2006/024313<br>
non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable earners, adjuvants and vehicles appropriate for each<br>
route of administration.<br>
[0104] In the treatment or prevention of conditions which require chemokine receptor<br>
modulation an appropriate dosage level will generally be about 0.001 to 100 mg per kg<br>
patient body weight per day which can be administered in single or multiple doses.<br>
Preferably, the dosage level will be about 0.01 to about 25 mg/kg per day; more preferably<br>
about 0.05 to about 10 mg/kg per day. A suitable dosage level may be about 0.01 to 25<br>
mg/kg per day, about 0.05 to 10 mg/kg per day, or about 0.1 to 5 mg/kg per day. Within this<br>
range the dosage may be 0.005 to 0.05, 0.05 to 0.5 or 0.5 to 5.0 mg/kg per day. For oral<br>
administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 1.0<br>
to 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient, particularly 1.0, 5.0,10.0,15.0, 20.0,25.0, 50.0,<br>
75.0, 100.0,150.0,200.0,250.0, 300.0,400.0,500.0, 600.0,750.0, 800.0, 900.0, and 1000.0<br>
milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the<br>
patient to be treated. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per<br>
day, preferably once or twice per day.<br>
[0105] It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage<br>
for any particular patient may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including<br>
the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action<br>
of that compound, the age, body weight, hereditary characteristics, general health, sex and<br>
diet of the subject, as well as the mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug<br>
combination, and the severity of the particular condition for the subject undergoing therapy.<br>
[0106] Diseases and conditions associated with inflammation, immune disorder, infection<br>
and cancer can be treated or prevented with the present compounds, compositions, and<br>
methods.<br>
[0107] The compounds and compositions of the present invention can be combined with<br>
other compounds and compositions having related utilities to prevent and treat the condition<br>
or disease of interest, such as inflammatory or autoimmune disorders, conditions and<br>
diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriatic<br>
arthritis, polyarticular arthritis, multiple sclerosis, allergic diseases, psoriasis, atopic<br>
dermatitis and asthma, and those pathologies noted above.<br>
[0108] For example, in the treatment or prevention of inflammation or autoimmunity or for<br>
example arthritis associated bone loss, the present compounds and compositions may be used<br>
44<br><br>
WO 2007/002293	PCT/US2006/024313<br>

amount commonly used therefor, contemporaneously or sequentially with a compound or<br>
composition of the present invention. When a compound or composition of the present<br>
invention is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical<br>
composition containing such other drugs in addition to the compound or composition of the<br>

VI. EXAMPLES<br>
[0110] The following examples are offered to illustrate, but not to limit the claimed<br>
invention.<br>
[0111] Reagents and solvents used below can be obtained from commercial sources such as<br>
Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA). 1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a<br>
Varian Mercury 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. Significant peaks are provided relative to<br>
TMS and are tabulated in the order: multiplicity (s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m,<br>
multiplet) and number of protons. Mass spectrometry results are reported as the ratio of mass<br>
over charge, followed by the relative abundance of each ion (in parenthesis). In the<br>
examples, a single m/e value is reported for the M+H (or, as noted, M-H) ion containing the<br>
most common atomic isotopes. Isotope patterns correspond to the expected formula in all<br>
cases. Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry analysis was conducted on a<br>
Hewlett-Packard MSD electrospray mass spectrometer using the HP 1100 HPLC for sample<br>
delivery. Normally the analyte was dissolved in methanol at 0.1 mg/mL and 1 microlitre was<br>
infused with the delivery solvent into the mass spectrometer, which scanned from 100 to<br>
1500 daltons. All compounds could be analyzed in the positive ESI mode, using acetonitrile /<br>
water with 1 % formic acid as the delivery solvent. The compounds provided below could<br>
also be analyzed in the negative ESI mode, using 2 mM NH4OAc in acetonitrile / water as<br>
delivery system.<br>

°C was added dropwise a solution of MeMgBr (3M in ether, 0.67 mL). The resultant mixture<br>
was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 3 hr. The reaction solution was cooled to 0<br>
°C and to it was added aqueous HCl solution (2M, 5 mL). The reaction solution was then<br>
stirred an additional 16 hr at room temperature and then neutralized by the addition of<br>
saturated sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) solution. The reaction solution was filtered to<br>
remove any precipitates and the filtrate was washed with ethyl acetate (3 x 10 mL) and<br>
aqueous brine (NaCl) solution (10 mL). The organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate<br>
(Na2SO4), filtered and concentrated in vacuo to give 3-acetyl-2-chloropyridine as a yellow<br>
powder which was used without further purification. The title compound (3-Methyl-1H-<br>
pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine) was synthesized from 3-acetyl-2-chloropyridine according to the<br>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<br>
A. Cells<br>
1. CCR1 expressing cells<br>
a)	THP-1 cells<br>
[0221] THP-1 cells were obtained from ATCC (TIB-202) and cultured as a suspension in<br>
RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 4.5<br>
g/L glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.05% 2-mercaptoethanol and 10%<br>
FBS. Cells were grown under 5% CO2/95% air, 100% humidity at 37°C and subcultured<br>
twice weekly at 1:5 (cells were cultured at a density range of 2x10 to 2x10 cells/mL) and<br>
harvested at 1 x 106 cells/mL. THP-1 cells express CCR1 and can be used in CCR1 binding<br>
and functional assays.<br>
b)	Isolated human monocytes<br>
[0222] Monocytes were isolated from human buffy coats using the Miltenyi bead isolation<br>
system (Miltenyi, Auburn, CA). Briefly, following a Ficoll gradient separation to isolate<br>
peripheral blood mononuclear cells, cells were washed with PBS and the red blood cells<br>
lysed using standard procedures. Remaining cells were labeled with anti-CD 14 antibodies<br>
coupled to magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA). Labeled cells were passed<br>
through AutoMACS (Miltenyi, Auburn, CA) and positive fraction collected. Monocytes<br>
express CCR1 and can be used in CCR1 binding and functional assays.<br>
91<br><br>
WO 2007/002293	PCT/US2006/024313<br>
B. Assays<br>
1.	Inhibition of CCR1 ligand binding<br>
[0223] CCR1 expressing cells were centrifuged and resuspended in assay buffer (20 mM<br>
HEPES pH 7.1,140 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, and with 0.2% bovine serum<br>
albumin) to a concentration of 5 x 106 cells/mL for THP-1 cells and 5 x 105 for monocytes.<br>
Binding assays were set up as follows. 0.1 mL of cells (5 x 105 THP-1 cells/well or 5 x 104<br>
monocytes) was added to the assay plates containing the compounds, giving a final<br>
concentration of ~2-10 µM each compound for screening (or part of a dose response for<br>
compound IC50 determinations). Then 0.1 mL of I25I labeled MIP-1α (obtained from Perkin<br>
Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) or 0.1 mL of 125I labeled CCL15/leukotactin (obtained as<br>
a custom radiolabeling by Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) diluted in assay buffer to<br>
a final concentration of ~50 pM, yielding -30,000 cpm per well, was added (using I25I<br>
labeled MlP-1α with THP-1 cells and I25I labeled CCL15/leukotactin with monocytes), the<br>
plates sealed and incubated for approximately 3 hours at 4°C on a shaker platform. Reactions<br>
were aspirated onto GF/B glass filters pre-soaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine (PEI) solution,<br>
on a vacuum cell harvester (Packard Instruments; Meriden, CT). Scintillation fluid (40 µl;<br>
Microscint 20, Packard Instruments) was added to each well, the plates were sealed and<br>
radioactivity measured in a Topcount scintillation counter (Packard Instruments). Control<br>
wells containing either diluent only (for total counts) or excess MlP-1α or MIP-1β (1 µg/mL,<br>
for non-specific binding) were used to calculate the percent of total inhibition for compound.<br>
The computer program Prism from GraphPad, Inc. (San Diego, Ca) was used to calculate<br>
IC50 values. IC50 values are those concentrations required to reduce the binding of labeled<br>
MIP-1α to the receptor by 50%. . (For further descriptions of ligand binding and other<br>
functional assays, see Dairaghi, et al., J. Biol. Ckem. 274:21569-21574 (1999), Penfold, et<br>
al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 96:9839-9844 (1999), and Dairaghi, et al,. J. Biol. Chem.<br>
272:28206-28209 (1997)).<br>
2.	Calcium mobilization<br>
[0224] To detect the release of intracellular stores of calcium, cells (THP-1 or monocytes)<br>
were incubated with 3 µM of INDO-1 AM dye (Molecular Probes; Eugene, OR) in cell media<br>
for 45 minutes at room temperature and washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). After<br>
92<br><br>
WO 2007/002293	PCT/US2006/024313<br>
INDO-1 AM loading, the cells were resuspended in flux buffer (Hank's balanced salt solution<br>
(HBSS) and 1% FBS). Calcium mobilization was measured using a Photon Technology<br>
International spectrophotometer (Photon Technology International; New Jersey) with<br>
excitation at 350 nm and dual simultaneous recording of fluorescence emission at 400 nm and<br>
490 nm. Relative intracellular calcium levels were expressed as the 400 nm/490 nm emission<br>
ratio. Experiments were performed at 37°C with constant mixing in cuvettes each containing<br>
106 cells in 2 mL of flux buffer. The chemokine ligands may be used over a range from 1 to<br>
100 nM. The emission ratio was plotted over time (typically 2-3 minutes). Candidate ligand<br>
blocking compounds (up to 10 µM) were added at 10 seconds, followed by chemokines at 60<br>
seconds (i.e., MlP-1α; R&amp;D Systems; Minneapolis, MN) and control chemokine (i.e., SDF-<br>
1α; R&amp;D Systems; Minneapolis, MN) at 150 seconds.<br>
3. Chemotaxis assays<br>
[0225] Chemotaxis assays were performed using 5 fm pore polycarbonate,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated filters in 96-well chemotaxis chambers (Neuroprobe;<br>
Gaithersburg, MD) using chemotaxis buffer (Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) and 1%<br>
FBS). CCR1 chemokine ligands (i.e., MlP-1α, CCL15/Leukotactin; R&amp;D Systems;<br>
Minneapolis, MN) are use to evaluate compound mediated inhibition of CCR1 mediated<br>
migration. Other chemokines (i.e., SDF-1α; R&amp;D Systems; Minneapolis, MN) are used as<br>
specificity controls. The lower chamber was loaded with 29 µl of chemokine (i.e., 0.1 nM<br>
CCL15/Leukotactin) and varying amounts of compound; the top chamber contained 100,000<br>
THP-1 or monocyte cells in 20 p.1. The chambers were incubated 1-2 hours at 37°C, and the<br>
number of cells in the lower chamber quantified either by direct cell counts in five high<br>
powered fields per well or by the CyQuant assay (Molecular Probes), a fluorescent dye<br>
method thai measures nucleic acid content and microscopic observation.<br>
C. Identification of inhibitors of CCR1<br>
1. Assay<br>
[0226] To evaluate small organic molecules that prevent the receptor CCR1 from binding<br>
ligand, an assay was employed that detected radioactive ligand (i.e, MIP-1α or<br>
CCL15/Leukotactin) binding to cells expressing CCR1 on the cell surface (for example,<br>
93<br><br>
WO 2007/002293	PCT/US2006/024313<br>
THP-1 cells or isolated human monocytes). For compounds that inhibited binding, whether<br>
competitive or not, fewer radioactive counts are observed when compared to uninhibited<br>
controls.<br>
[0227] THP-1 cells and monocytes lack other chemokine receptors that bind the same set of<br>
chemokine ligands as CCR1 (i.e., MIP-1α, MPIF-1, Leukotactin, etc.). Equal numbers of<br>
cells were added to each well in the plate. The cells were then incubated with radiolabeled<br>
MIP-1α. Unbound ligand was removed by washing the cells, and bound ligand was<br>
determined by quantifying radioactive counts. Cells that were incubated without any organic<br>
compound gave total counts; non-specific binding was determined by incubating the cells<br>
with unlabeled ligand and labeled ligand. Percent inhibition was determined by the equation:<br><br>
2.	Dose Response Curves<br>
[0228] To ascertain a candidate compound's affinity for CCR1 as well as confirm its ability<br>
to inhibit ligand binding, inhibitory activity was titered over a 1 x 10-10 to 1 x 10-4 M range of<br>
compound concentrations. In the assay, the amount of compound was varied; while cell<br>
number and ligand concentration were held constant.<br>
3.	CCR1 functional assays<br>
[0229] CCR1 is a seven transmembrane, G-protein linked receptor. A hallmark of<br>
signaling cascades induced by the ligation of some such receptors is the pulse-like release of<br>
calcium ions from intracellular stores. Calcium mobilization assays were performed to<br>
determine if the candidate CCR1 inhibitory compounds were able to also block aspects of<br>
CCR1 signaling. Candidate compounds able to inhibit ligand binding and signaling with an<br>
enhanced specificity over other chemokine and non-chemokine receptors were desired.<br>
[0230] Calcium ion release in response to CCR1 chemokine ligands (i.e., MlP-1α, MPEF-1,<br>
Leukotactin, etc.) was measured using the calcium indicator INDO-1. THP-1 cells or<br>
monocytes were loaded with INDO-1/AM and assayed for calcium release in response to<br>
94<br><br>
WO 2007/002293	PCT/US2006/024313<br>
CCR1 chemokine ligand (i.e., MlP-1α) addition. To control for specificity, non-CCR1<br>
ligands, specifically bradykinin, was added, which also signals via a seven transmembrane<br>
receptor. Without compound, a pulse of fluorescent signal will be seen upon MlP-la<br>
addition. If a compound specifically inhibits CCR1-MIP-1α signaling, then little or no signal<br>
pulse will be seen upon MIP-1α addition, but a pulse will be observed upon bradykinin<br>
addition. However, if a compound non-specifically inhibits signaling, then no pulse will be<br>
seen upon both MIP-1 a and bradykinin addition.<br>
[0231] One of the primary functions of chemokines is their ability to mediate the migration<br>
of chemokine receptor-expressing cells, such as white blood cells. To confirm that a<br>
candidate compound inhibited not only CCR1 specific binding and signaling (at least as<br>
determined by calcium mobilization assays), but also CCR1 mediated migration, a<br>
chemotaxis assay was employed. THP-1 myelomonocytic leukemia cells, which resemble<br>
monocytes, as wells as freshly isolated monocytes, were used as targets for chemoattraction<br>
by CCR1 chemokine ligands (i.e., MIP-1α, CCL15/leukotactin). Cells were place in the top<br>
compartment of a microwell migration chamber, while MlP-1α (or other potent CCR1<br>
chemokine ligand) and increasing concentrations of a candidate compound was loaded in the<br>
lower chamber. In the absence of inhibitor, cells will migrate to the lower chamber in<br>
response to the chemokine agonist; if a compound inhibited CCR1 function, then the majority<br>
of cells will remain in the upper chamber. To ascertain a candidate compound's affinity for<br>
CCR1 as well as to confirm its ability to inhibit CCR1 mediated cell migration, inhibitory<br>
activity was titered over a 1 x 10-10 to 1 x 10-4 M range of compound concentrations in this<br>
chemotaxis assay. In this assay, the amount of compound was varied; while cell number and<br>
chemokine agonist concentrations were held constant. After the chemotaxis chambers were<br>
incubated 1-2 hours at 37°C, the responding cells in the lower chamber were quantified by<br>
labeling with the CyQuant assay (Molecular Probes), a fluorescent dye method that measures<br>
nucleic acid content, and by measuring with a Spectrafluor Plus (Tecan). The computer<br>
program Prism from GraphPad, Inc. (San Diego, Ca) was used to calculate IC50 values. IC50<br>
values are those compound concentrations required to inhibit the number of cells responding<br>
to a CCR1 agonist by 50%.<br>

4. In Vivo Efficacy<br>
a)	Rabbit model of destructive joint inflammation<br>
[0232] To study the effects of candidate compounds on inhibiting the inflammatory<br>
response of rabbits to an intra-articular injection of the bacterial membrane component<br>
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a rabbit model of destructive joint inflammation is used. This<br>
study design mimics the destructive joint inflammation seen in arthritis. Intra-articular<br>
injection of LPS causes an acute inflammatory response characterized by the release of<br>
cytokines and chemokines, many of which have been identified in rheumatoid arthritic joints.<br>
Marked increases in leukocytes occur in synovial fluid and in synovium in response to<br>
elevation of these chemotactic mediators. Selective antagonists of chemokine receptors have<br>
shown efficacy in this model (see Podolin, et al., J. Immunol. 169(ll):6435-6444 (2002)).<br>
[0233] A rabbit LPS study is conducted essentially as described in Podolin, et al. ibid.,<br>
female New Zealand rabbits (approximately 2 kilograms) are treated intra-articularly in one<br>
knee with LPS (10 ng) together with either vehicle only (phosphate buffered saline with 1%<br>
DMSO) or with addition of CCX-105 (dose 1 = 50 µM or dose 2 = 100 uM) in a total volume<br>
of 1.0 mL. Sixteen hours after the LPS injection, knees are lavaged and cells counts are<br>
performed. Beneficial effects of treatment were determined by histopathologic evaluation of<br>
synovial inflammation. Inflammation scores are used for the histopathologic evaluation: 1 -<br>
minimal, 2 - mild, 3 - moderate, 4 - moderate-marked.<br>
b)	Evaluation of a candidate compound in a rat model of collagen<br>
induced arthritis<br>
[0234] A 17 day developing type II collagen arthritis study is conducted to evaluate the<br>
effects of a candidate compound on arthritis induced clinical ankle swelling. Rat collagen<br>
arthritis is an experimental model of polyarthritis that has been widely used for preclinical<br>
testing of numerous anti-arthritic agents (see Trentham, et al., J. Exp. Med. 146(3):857-868<br>
(1977), Bendele, et al., Toxicologic Pathol 27:134-142 (1999), Bendele, et al., Arthritis<br>
Rheum. 42:498-506 (1999)). The hallmarks of this model are reliable onset and progression<br>
of robust, easily measurable polyarticular inflammation, marked cartilage destruction in<br>
association with pannus formation and mild to moderate bone resorption and periosteal bone<br>
proliferation.<br>
96<br><br>
WO 2007/002293	PCT/US2006/024313<br>
[0235] Female Lewis rats (approximately 0.2 kilograms) are anesthetized with isoflurane<br>
and injected with Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant containing 2 mg/mL bovine type II collagen<br>
at the base of the tail and two sites on the back on days 0 and 6 of this 17 day study. A<br>
candidate compound is dosed daily in a sub-cutaneous manner from day 0 till day 17 at a<br>
efficacious dose. Caliper measurements of the ankle joint diameter were taken, and reducing<br>
joint swelling is taken as a measure of efficacy.<br>
[0236] In the table below, structures and activity are provided for representative<br>
compounds described herein. Activity is provided as follows for either the chernotaxis assay<br>
or binding assay as described above: +, IC50 &gt; 12.5 uM; ++, 2500 nM
