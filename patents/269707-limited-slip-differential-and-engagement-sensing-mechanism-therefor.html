				<td>TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
[0001]     Limited Slip Differential And Engagement Sensing Mechanism<br>
Therefor.<br>
EtACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
[0002]     The present invention relates to fraction modifying differentials, and<br>
more particularly, to such differentials of the type in which the differential action<br>
nay be retarded, and possibly even prevented ("locked"), in response to some<br>
sort of an input, for example, a mechanical input or an electrical input signal.<br>
[0003]     Furthermore, the present invention relates to engagement sensing<br>
nechanisms and systems of the type which may be utilized to sense a change-<br>
of-state within a traction modifying differential, for example, a change between<br>
an unlocked condition and a locked condition.<br>
[0004]     Traction modifying differentials of the type to which the present<br>
invention relates typically include a gear case defining a gear chamber, and<br>
disposed therein, a differential gear set including at least one input pinion gear,<br>
and a pair of output side gears,  The present invention will be described in<br>
connection with a differential of the bevel gear type, although those skilled in<br>
the art will understand that the invention is not so limited, and could be utilized<br>
h connection with differentials having other gearing types, such as helical or<br>
planetary.   Typically, a clutch pack is disposed between at least one of the side<br>
gears and an adjacent surface of the gear case, such that the clutch pack or<br>
locking mechanism is operable to limit relative rotation between the gear case<br>
and the one side gear. In most differentials of the type described, engaging the<br>
clutch pack or locking mechanism (to retard differentiation) is achieved by one<br>
of several different approaches.<br>
|0005]     In one approach, a "locking differential" of the type illustrated and<br>
described in U.S. Patent No, Re 28,004, assigned to the assignee of the<br><br>
present invention and incorporated herein by reference, the clutch pack is<br>
normally disengaged. When one of the wheels begins to spin out, relative to<br>
the other wheel, a speed sensitive mechanism senses the speed differential<br>
between the wheels, and by means of a cam and ramp mechanism, locks the<br>
.    clutch pack solid. In the incorporated patent, the speed sensitive mechanism<br>
comprises a fly-weight mechanism, the output of which comprises the<br>
mechanical "input", in response to which the differential gearing is locked,<br>
[0006]     U.S. Patent No. 5,019,021, also assigned to the assignee of the<br>
present invention and incorporated herein by reference, illustrates another<br>
approach to retarding differentiation.   This patent illustrates and describes a<br>
" imited slip differential" in which the loading on the clutch pack may be varied<br>
in response to an external electrical input signal, thus varying the amount of slip<br>
within the clutch pack. Therefore, the amount of bias torque transmitted from<br>
c ne side gear to the other is also varied in response to changes in the external<br>
electric input signal. As is well known to those skilled in the art, in a limited slip<br>
differential, there is typically a certain amount of "slip" or speed differential,<br>
between the two side gears whenever the vehicle encounters (ess than optimum<br>
faction conditions. In the above-incorporated patent, the "input" to the<br>
differential is the electrical Input signal, but within the differential, there is<br>
smother "input" which is the axial movement of one of the plates of a ball ramp<br>
actuator, the axial movement of which varies the loading on the clutch pack in a<br>
Manner which is now generally well known to those skilled In the art.<br>
[0007]     Finally, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,551,209, also assigned to the assignee of<br>
the present invention and incorporated herein by reference, there is illustrated a<br>
different approach to a "locking differential". In the above-incorporated patent,<br>
there is illustrated and described a locking differential in which there is no<br>
friction-type clutch pack, but instead, a mechanical locking arrangement.   In the<br>
differential of the cited '209 patent, there is a ball ramp actuator which is able,<br>
in response to an electrical input signal, to move a series of pins into mating<br><br>
openings in the differential side gear, thus locking the side gear relative to the<br>
d fferential gear case. For purposes of the present invention, the movement of<br>
the pins, toward or away from the side gear, to achieve either a locked condition<br>
o" an unlocked condition, respectively, is also considered an "input" in regard to<br>
a means for limiting rotation of an output gear relative to a gear case in a<br>
differential.<br>
[0008]     Thus, it may be seen, from a review of the above-described types of<br>
limited slip and locking differentials, that there are a number of different<br>
mechanisms known to those skilled in the art which are commonly used to limit<br>
(retard), or lock, the relative rotation between a differential gear case and one<br>
of the output side gears. However, it should be noted that most of the known,<br>
prior art limited slip and locking differential arrangements, and especially those<br>
which have been commercialized by the assignee of the present invention,<br>
have in common the presence of some sort of member which moves axiaily, in<br>
connection with the operation of the mechanism which achieves the slip limiting<br>
or locking function within the differentia).<br>
[D009]     More recently, an increasing percentage of vehicles (especially<br>
passenger cars and light trucks) are incorporating some sort of stability, or<br>
traction, or safety system Into the drive train. Examples of such systems would<br>
include a traction control system (TCS), an anti-skid braking system (ABS), and<br>
am electronic stability program (ESP),   it is quite common, and desirable, for<br>
such systems to include some sort of traction modifying device, and preferably,<br>
an electrically-actuated limited slip or locking differential. In order for these<br>
types of systems to operate most effectively and safely, it is important for the<br>
control logic of the system to receive some sort of feedback signal from the<br>
differential, whereby the control logic can know, at any given instant, whether<br>
ihe differential is in an actuated (locked) condition, or in an unactuated<br>
(unlocked) condition.<br>
|0010]     Unfortunately, sensing the occurrence of a locked condition (or an<br><br>
unlocked condition) in a locking differential, or sensing an Increasing clutch<br>
engagement (or a decreasing clutch engagement) in a limited slip differential<br>
involves sensing something such as the axial movement of a member within a<br>
differential gear case which, typically, is rotating within a stationary outer<br>
housing.   One seemingly obvious way of mounting a sensor on a rotating<br>
differential case is to fix the sensor to the exterior of the case, and transmit the<br>
generated electrical signal from the differential to the vehicle microprocessor by<br>
means of slip rings,   Unfortunately, such an arrangement is typically not<br>
feasible.   For most differential Installations, nothing can be attached to the<br>
exterior of (the outer diameter of) the differential case (or extend radially<br>
cutward therefrom), because, in the axle assembly plant, it must be possible to<br>
slide the ring gear over the case outer diameter, and bolt the ring gear to the<br>
case flange.<br>
[3011]     Another hindrance encountered by those skilled in the art, in<br>
attempting to develop arrangements for sensing the "change-of-state" in a<br>
limited slip or locking differentia! is the fact that the sensing system utilized<br>
needs to be able to survive and operate effectively in a fairly severe<br>
environment.   For example, the sensing mechanism and the overall system<br>
need to be able to operate predictably over a broad temperature range (e.g.,<br>
f"om about -40 degrees Celsius to about 190 degrees Celsius).  Also the<br>
sensing mechanism must be able to operate while submersed in a<br>
petrochemical-based lubricant, without any adverse effect upon the accuracy of<br>
the sensing system "output" signal, indicating the current state of the<br>
differential.<br>
E3RIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0012]     Accordingly, it Is an object of "the present invention to provide an<br>
improved differential gear mechanism, and an improved sensing mechanism<br>
and assembly for use therein, which will overcome the above-described<br><br>
p'oblems of the prior art.<br>
[0013]     It is a further object of the present invention to provide such an<br>
inproved differential gear mechanism and improved sensing system for use<br>
therein which achieves the above-stated object, but without any substantial<br>
redesign of the underlying differential mechanism, and with no substantial<br>
increase in the overall package size of the differential gear mechanism.<br>
[0014]     It is a more specific object of the present invention to provide such an<br>
improved differential gear mechanism, and sensing system therefor, in which<br>
the occurrence of a change in the state of the differential can be sensed<br>
utilizing the axial movement, within the differential, of a member which is<br>
already a required part of the differential mechanism, rather than requiring<br>
some sort of additional "target" member.<br>
[0015]     The above and other objects of the invention are accomplished by the<br>
provision of an improved differential gear mechanism including a gear case<br>
cefinlng an axis of rotation, and a gear chamber, differential gearing being<br>
cisposed In the gear chamber including at least one input gear and first and<br>
second output gears. The mechanism includes means operable to limit rotation<br>
cf the first output gear relative to the gear case, and actuation means for<br>
sctuating the rotation limiting means, the actuation means.being operable in<br>
response to an input, to move the rotation limiting means from an unactuated<br>
condition to an actuated condition. The rotation limiting means includes a<br>
member, disposed toward one axial end of the gear case and moveable in the<br>
direction of the axis of rotation between a first position corresponding to the<br>
unactuated condition of the rotation limiting means, and a second position<br>
corresponding to the actuated condition.<br>
[0016]     The improved differential gear mechanism Is characterized by a<br>
siensor assembly being disposed adjacent the one axial end of the gear case<br>
and including a sensor element and a wall-like member disposed axially<br>
between the rotation limiting means and the actuation means. The wall-like<br><br>
member includes a non-ferromagnetic portion disposed axially between the<br>
sensor element and the moveable member, whereby movement of the<br>
moveable member between the first and the second positions results in a<br>
Corresponding change in the electromagnetic flux coupling the sensor element<br>
and the moveable member.<br>
[0017]     In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there Is<br>
provided a mechanism including a case defining an axis and a chamber, the<br>
mechanism including an actuation means for actuating the mechanism, the<br>
actuation means being operable in response to an input to move the<br>
mechanism from an unactuated condition to an actuated condition. The<br>
mechanism includes an axially moveable member disposed toward one axial<br>
end of the case and moveable in the direction of the axis between a first<br>
position corresponding to the unactuated condition of the mechanism, and a<br>
second position corresponding to the actuated condition,<br>
[0018]     The improved mechanism is characterized by a sensor assembly<br>
being disposed adjacent the one axial end of the case and including a sensor<br>
element and a wall-like member disposed axially between the mechanism and<br>
the actuation means. The wall-like member includes a non-ferromagnetic<br>
portion disposed axially between the sensor element and the axially moveable<br>
nember, whereby movement of the axially moveable member between the first<br>
smd the second positions results in a corresponding change in the<br>
electromagnetic flux coupling the sensor element and the axially moveable<br>
member. The sensor element comprises an electromagnetic coil disposed<br>
adjacent the one axial end of the case and disposed generally concentrically<br>
about the axis.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0025]     Referring now to the drawings, which are not intended to limit the<br>
invention, FIG. 1 is an axial cross-section of a slip-limiting differential, and more<br>
specifically, of a locking differential including the present invention. The<br>
specific construction and operation of differentials of the general type to which<br>
t'lis invention relates, and of the specific type illustrated in FIG. 1, may be better<br>
understood by reference to the above-incorporated patents.   Specifically, the<br>
overall construction and function of the locking differential shown in FIG. 1 Is<br>
quite similar to that illustrated and described in above-incorporated U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,551,209.<br>
[0026]'    However, as has already been noted, the usefulness of the present<br>
invention is not restricted to only locking differentials, but could be also<br>
advantageous when used on limited slip differentials, at least on those including<br>
some sort of a member within the differential which moves axially within the<br><br>
differential case such that the movement of the member is representative of a<br>
change between a slipping condition and a slip-limiting condition. Furthermore,<br>
the use of the present invention is not restricted to any particular configuration<br>
o differential, except as is specifically noted in the appended claims. Finally, it<br>
should be noted that, in one aspect, the present invention comprises a sensing<br>
assembly and system which may be used effectively to sense the change of<br>
state of an associated mechanism which includes a member disposed therein,<br>
wherein movement of the member corresponds to a change in the operating<br>
state or condition of the associated mechanism.<br>
[0027]     The differential gear mechanism (locking differential) shown in FIG. 1<br>
includes a gear case 11 which defines therein a gear chamber, generally<br>
designated 13. In the subject embodiment, and by way of example only, the<br>
gear case 11 comprises a single, unitary gear case, and all parts within the<br>
differential are inserted through a "window" (not shown herein) in the gear case<br>
11, as is well known to those skilled In the art. However, it should be<br>
understood that the present invention is not limited to any particular<br>
configuration of gear case 11, or any particular configuration of window, or<br>
even, to the presence of such a window. Torque input to the differential is<br>
typically by means of an input ring gear (not shown herein), which may be<br>
attached to a flange 15 (shown only fragmentarily herein) of the gear case 11<br>
by any suitable means, such as a plurality of bolts (also not shown herein).<br>
[0028]     Disposed within the gear chamber 13 is a differential gear set<br>
including a pair of input pinion gears 17 which are rotatably mounted on a<br>
pinion shaft 19. Typically, the pinion shaft 19 is secured relative to the gear<br>
case by any suitable means, such as a locking pin 21. The pinion gears 17<br>
comprise the input gears of the differential gear set, and are in meshing<br>
engagement with a pair of side gears 23 and 25. The side gears 23 and 25<br>
define sets of internal, straight splines 27 and 29, respectively, which are<br>
adapted to be In splined engagement with mating external splines of a pair of<br><br>
axle shafts (not shown). The gear case 11 includes annular hub portions 31<br>
and 33 on which may be mounted a pair of bearing sets (not shown herein)<br>
which are used to provide rotational support for the differential mechanism<br>
relative to an outer differential housing (ai$o not shown herein).<br>
[0029]     As is well known to those skilled in the art, during normal straight-<br>
ahead operation of the vehicle, no differentiation occurs between the left and<br>
right side gears 23 and 25, and therefore, the pinion gears 17 do not rotate<br>
relative to the pinion shaft 19. The gear case 11, the pinion gears 17, and the<br>
side gears 23 and 25 all rotate about an axis of rotation A (shown only in FIGS.<br>
1 and 2) as a solid unit.<br>
[0030]     It should be understood that the locking differential of the present<br>
invention may be operated in either of several modes. The differential may be<br>
operated manually, i.e., wherein the driver manually selects the locked mode,<br>
such that the differential operates in the locked mode almost immediately after<br>
the vehicle begins to move. Alternatively, the locking differential may operate in<br>
an "automatic mode" wherein, by way of example only, the vehicle<br>
nicroprocessor senses an operating condition, such as incipient wheel slip and<br>
transmits an appropriate electrical input signal ("input") to the locking<br>
differential, thus locking the side gear 25 relative to the gear case 11, to prevent<br>
siny further differentiation.<br>
[0031]     in the case of the automatic mode of operation of the locking<br>
differential, it will be understood that under certain operating conditions, such<br>
us when the vehicle is turning or a slight difference In tire size exists, it is<br>
permissible for a certain amount of differentiating action to occur between the<br>
iside gears 23 and 25. However, in accordance with the present invention, the<br>
locking differential may or may not include a clutch pack, or any other similar<br>
mechanism which merely retards or limits differentiating action, but instead may<br>
provide a choice between only an unactuated condition as shown in FIG. 1 and<br>
an actuated, locked condition, not separately shown herein.<br><br>
[0032]     Referring now to FIG. 2, in conjunction with FIG. 1, the locking<br>
differential of the present invention includes a rotation limiting mechanism,<br>
generally designated 35. The rotation limiting mechanism 35 may be better<br>
understood by reference to the above-incorporated U.S. Pat. No. 6,651,209. it<br>
snould be understood by those skilled in the differential art that, because the<br>
present invention is not limited to any particular structure or mode of operation<br>
of the rotation limiting mechanism 35, except as specifically otherwise noted in<br>
the appended claims, the mechanism 35 will be described only briefly herein,<br>
and only by way of background and example. The gear case 11 includes an<br>
end wall 37 which defines two arrays of bores. The first array of bores (shown<br>
in FIG. 1), comprises a plurality of pin bores 39 which extend axially through the<br>
entire axial extent of the end wall 37. Disposed within each of the pin bores 39<br>
in an axially moveable, generally cylindrical pin member 41 (also referred to<br>
hereinafter, and in the appended claims, as a "lock member"). The second<br>
srray of bores (see FIG. 2) comprises a plurality of spring bores 43, which<br>
extend from the left end in FIG. 2 of the end wall 37 only partially through the<br>
eixial thickness of the end wall 37, such that within each spring bore 43 there is<br>
seated a coiled compression spring 45.<br>
[0033]    The left end of each of the compression springs 45 is seated against<br>
sin inner ramp plate 47 (see also FIG. 3) of a ball ramp actuator, generally<br>
designated 49. The ball ramp actuator 49 also includes an outer ramp plate 51,<br>
and a plurality of cam members (balls) 53 are disposed between the inner ramp<br>
plate 47 and the outer ramp plate 51, in a manner now well known to those<br>
skilled in the art of ball ramp actuators. The ball ramp actuator 49 may be<br>
considered as part of the rotation limiting mechanism 35.<br>
[0034]     Disposed axially outward of the gear case 11 (to the left In FIGS. 1<br>
(and 2 from the ball ramp actuator 49) is an electromagnetic actuator, generally<br>
designated 55, which preferably comprises an annular electromagnetic coil 57<br>
disposed radially outward from, and supported by, an annular support member<br><br>
59. The support member 59 surrounds the larger diameter portion of the<br>
annular hub portion 31, such that the electromagnetic actuator 65 is stationary,<br>
(I.e., is fixed relative to an outer differential housing which is not shown herein),<br>
and the gear case 11 is free to rotate therein, and relative thereto. The<br>
electromagnetic actuator 55 is, in certain aspects, illustrated and described in<br>
greater detail in one or more of the above-incorporated patents.<br>
[0035]     Actuation of the electromagnetic coil 57 occurs in response to an<br>
electrical input signal, transmitted to the coil 57 by means of a pair of electrical<br>
loads 61 (see FIG. 2), the reference numeral "61" to be used hereinafter to<br>
designate either the leads themselves, or the electrical input signal.<br>
[0036]     Referring now primarily to FIGS. 2 and 3, disposed immediately<br>
adjacent the electromagnetic coil 57 is an annular drive plate 63 which is fixed,<br>
by any suitable means such as splines, to be non-rotatable relative to the outer<br>
ramp plate 51. The connection between the drive plate 63 and the outer ramp<br>
plate 51 will be described in greater detail subsequently, in connection with the<br>
cescription of the sensing mechanism of the present invention. Therefore, and<br>
es is now well known to those skilled in the art, and as is illustrated and<br>
c escribed in the above-incorporated patents, when the coil 57 is energized, the<br>
resulting flux path passes through the drive plate 63 and draws the plate into<br>
fictional engagement with adjacent friction surfaces on a coil housing 65,  The<br>
coil housing 65 is preferably fixed to be non-rotatable relative to an outer<br>
differential housing, not shown herein, but represented in FIG. 2 by a "ground"<br>
symbol, designated 66. The result is to retard rotation of the annular drive plate<br>
63 and therefore of the outer ramp plate 51, relative to the gear case 11.<br>
However, the inner ramp plate 47 is fixed to rotate with the gear case 11, such<br>
as by means of a plurality of ears 67 (see FIG. 3), and therefore, the ramping<br>
action results in rightward axial movement (in FIGS. II through 3) of the inner<br>
ramp plate 47, in apposition of the biasing force of the compression springs 45.<br>
Referring again primarily to FIG. 1, the "outer" face of the side gear 23 (i.e., the<br><br>
side facing the end wall 37), defines a plurality of openings 69, the openings 69<br>
bsing arranged in an array which matches, or mates with, the array of pin bores<br>
39. Therefore, with the arrays of pin bores 39 and openings 69<br>
c rcurnferentially aligned (the position shown in FIG. 1), actuation of the<br>
electromagnetic coil 57 will move the Inner ramp plate 47 to the right in FIG. 1,<br>
and move the pin members 41 into engagement within the openings 69, thus<br>
locking the side gear 23 relative to the gear case 11 (the actuated or "locked"<br>
condition).<br>
[0037]     Most of what has been described up to this point is already known,<br>
primarily from the above-incorporated patents. Referring now to all of the<br>
drawing figures in conjunction with each other, an important aspect of the<br>
present invention will be described. As stated previously, one of the objects of<br>
this invention is to be able to sense the occurrence of either the locked<br>
condition, or the unlocked condition (i.e., to be able to sense the change of<br>
state of a mechanism), utilizing the axial movement, within the mechanism, of a<br>
member which comprises part of the mechanism.<br>
[0038]     In the subject embodiment, and by way of example only, the "axially<br>
moveable member" includes the inner ramp plate 47 of the ball ramp actuator<br>
^•9. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the inner ramp plate 47<br>
itself serves as the "axially moveable member", for purposes of the appended<br>
claims, without the need for any added structure to serve as a target to be<br>
sensed by the sensing mechanism, which is to be described hereinafter.<br>
[0039]     Referring now primarily to FIGS. 2, 3 and 4, the sensing mechanism<br>
of the present invention will be described.  In accordance with a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, the coil housing 65 is of the '"two cavity11 type, (i-e.,<br>
the coil housing 65 defines not only a cavity for the electromagnetic coil 57 (the<br>
"actuation" coil), but also provides a cavity within which is disposed a sensing<br>
coil 71), the function of which will be described subsequently.   The sensing coil<br>
71 may comprise simply an electromagnetic coil, or may comprise a<br><br>
magnetically-biased coil.   In either case, the sensing coil 71 (also referred to<br>
hereinafter in the appended claims as a "sensor element") preferably provides a<br>
"proximity" sensing device, as that term is well understood in the sensing art.<br>
As is well known to those skilled in the art of electromagnetic actuation, the coil<br>
housing 65 comprises a ferromagnetic member, as does the annular drive plate<br>
63 which comprises part of the electromagnetic "circuit" for purposes of<br>
actuation of the ball ramp actuator 49.  The inner ramp plate 47 also preferably<br>
comprises a ferromagnetic member, for reasons which will become apparent<br>
subsequently.<br>
[0040]     However, in accordance with an important saspect of the invention, the<br>
radially "inner" portion of the drive plate 63, immediately adjacent the sensing<br>
coll 71, is replaced by an annular window member 73, best seen in FIGS. 3 and<br>
A.  The term "window" is used herein in regard to the member 73 primarily to<br>
explain that, for purposes of the present invention, the window member 73 is<br>
not ferromagnetic, and therefore, the electromagnetic circuit (or flux "path") is<br>
not "contained" within the window member 73, but instead, permits the flux lines<br>
F: (see FIG. 4) to pass through.  By way of contrast, and as is well known in the<br>
electromagnetic arts, the flux lines resulting from actuation of the coil 57 would<br>
be contained within the drive plate 63, with lines of flux passing vertically<br>
therethrough.   In the subject embodiment, and by way of example only, the<br>
nnnular window member 73 comprises an aluminum member, such that the<br>
window member 73 has the structural integrity and durability to transmit torque<br>
trom the annular drive plate 63 to the outer ramp plate 51.  As is also well *<br>
known to those skilled in the art, the aluminum window member 73 will slightly<br>
increase the flux density, as compare to air.<br>
[0041]     At the same time, and as may best be seen in FIG. 4, tine annular<br>
window member 73 is disposed axially between the sensing coil 71 and the<br>
nner ramp plate 47, the axially movable member in the subject embodiment.<br>
When a sensing current is imposed upon the sensing coil 71, the result is the<br><br>
e ectromagnetic flux path F, as shown in FIG. 4.   The flux path F passes<br>
through the coll housing 65, around the sensing coll 71, passes through the<br>
window member 73, across an adjacent air gap, then through part of the inner<br>
ramp plate 47.  As is known from the previous, brief description of the<br>
operation of the rotation-limiting mechanism 35 and the electromagnetic<br>
actuator 55, the Inner ramp plate 47 moves axially (see arrow in FIG. 4)<br>
between a first condition (FIG. 2), corresponding to the unactuated condition of<br>
the mechanism 35, and a second condition (position toward which inner ramp<br>
plate 47 is moving in FIG. 4), corresponding to the actuated condition of the<br>
mechanism 35.<br>
[0042]      In accordance with an important aspect of trie invention, as the axial<br>
position of the inner ramp plate 47 changes, the magnetic flux path length<br>
changes, but is unaffected by the window member 73.   The changes in the flux<br>
path length which result from the inner ramp plate 47 moving further from, or<br>
closer to, the sensing coil 71 result in either a decrease or an increase,<br>
respectively, in the flux density (or Inductance) of the flux path F.  The changes<br>
in flux density (or inductance) may then be sensed, or monitored, by an external<br>
control circuitry which is capable of "converting" the sensed flux density (or<br>
inductance) into a value representative of the changes in the axial separation<br>
between the sensing coil 71 and the ramp plate 47.<br>
[0043]     Referring now primarily to FIG. 5, there is a graph of Voltage versus<br>
Time, illustrating an important relationship utilized by one embodiment of the<br>
sensing mechanism of the present invention.   In connection with the<br>
development of the invention, several different proximity-type sensing<br>
arrangements were investigated, including one known as pulse induction (PI)<br>
siensing.   In a PI sensing arrangement, the sensing coil 71 is charged to a<br>
known current ("Constant current pulse" in FIG. 5).  This known current<br>
produces a magnetic field which induces the magnetic flux path F shown in<br>
FIG, 4.   This flux path F stores energy in the materials (Energy = % LI2).   The<br>
-14-<br><br>
known coil current is then abruptly terminated, causing the magnetic flux path F<br>
to cease (decay) and energy to be dissipated.  As the magnetic flux path F<br>
cianges, the change will cause eddy currents to flow in the inner ramp plate 47,<br>
but the eddy currents will decay slowly because of the internal resistance of the<br>
ferromagnetic ramp plate 47.<br>
[0044]     As the above-described eddy currents flow in the ramp plate 47, the<br>
eddy currents also produce a magnetic field, which, in turn, induces a current<br>
back into the sensing coil 71, resulting in a back-EMF (electro-motive force).<br>
When the resulting voltage (from the back-EMF) is measured across the<br>
sensing coil 71, there is a negative voltage spike ("SPIKE" in FIG. 5), having an<br>
exponential decay rate or curve, as shown in FIG. 5.  The decay rate of the<br>
regative spike is a function of the inductance, which, in turn, is directly related<br>
to the air gap distance from the sensing coil 71 to the inner ramp plate 47,<br>
However, it should be understood by those skilled in the sensing art that the<br>
present Invention is not limited to the above-described, or any other particular,<br>
sensing concept, except as specifically noted otherwise in the appended claims.<br>
[0045]     A variety of sensing systems are available and well known and the<br>
present invention is not limited to pulse induction sensing.   Tuned lank"<br>
oscillator circuits, whereby an inductor and capacitor form a tuned frequency<br>
oscillator, can be used as well to determine the distance by measuring the<br>
frequency of oscillation.  As this concept can be used to look for any metal, it<br>
will not "see" thru the aluminum if the frequency is too high. It does include the<br>
tuned oscillator front end circuitry. Other known magnetic proximity sensors<br>
and LVDT arrangements could be implemented as well. It was found, in<br>
connection with the development of the present invention, that the pulse<br>
induction sensing was relatively simple and was effective when implemented in<br>
this particular environment.<br>
[0046]     in view of the particular application for the present Invention, the<br><br>
above-described sensing concept comprises a preferred embodiment, partly<br>
because it was found to be effective under a broad range of operating<br>
temperatures (from about -40 degrees Celsius to about 190 degrees Celsius),<br>
and while immersed in various petrochemical-based lubricants (such as gear<br>
o Is).   Neither the temperature variations nor the various oils appeared to have<br>
a negative effect upon the ability to accurately sense the change-of-state (axial<br>
movement) of the ramp plate 47.<br>
[0047]     Referring now primarily to FIG. 6, there is illustrated a portion of an<br>
electrical control circuitry, generally designated 81, which may be used to<br>
implement the sensing concept illustrated and described in connection with<br>
FIG. 5.   In the circuit shown in FIG. 6, a Pulse Train (shown as the Constant<br>
Current Pulse in FIG. 5) is an input to the control circuitry 81.  The "Output" of<br>
the control circuit 81 is an analog signal 91 which is representative of the<br>
c istance of the inner ramp plate 47 from the sensing coil 71.<br>
[3048]     The invention has been described in great detail in the foregoing<br>
specification, and it is believed that various alterations and modifications of the<br>
invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a reading and<br>
