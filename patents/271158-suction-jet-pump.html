				<td>Description<br>
Suction jet pump<br>
The subject matter of the invention is a suction jet pump,<br>
comprising a driving jet nozzle, a mixing tube, an intake<br>
opening, a working-fluid line connected to the driving jet<br>
nozzle and a valve which is arranged in the working-fluid line.<br>
Suction jet pumps are used in fuel tanks of motor vehicles.<br>
Such suction jet pumps are used in fuel tanks in order to<br>
supply fuel from various regions of the fuel tank to a feed<br>
unit, which feed unit feeds fuel from the fuel tank to an<br>
internal combustion engine of the motor vehicle. In order to<br>
drive the suction jet pump, a portion of the fuel fed by the<br>
fuel pump is branched off and supplied via the working-fluid<br>
line of the suction jet pump. When starting the internal<br>
combustion engine, the fuel pump should feed fuel in a<br>
sufficient quantity to the internal combustion engine as fast<br>
as possible. To this end, a valve is arranged in the working-<br>
fluid line, which valve only opens when the system pressure is<br>
reached so that, particularly in the event of a starting<br>
process, all the fed fuel is first supplied to the internal<br>
combustion engine.<br>
In order to improve the starting behavior of the motor vehicle,<br>
it is known to increase the pressure in the feed line for a<br>
short time. To this end, the flow rate of the fuel pump is<br>
increased for a short time during the starting process.<br>
However, the effect of the valve in the working-fluid line is<br>
thus cancelled out, which valve is supposed to release the<br>
working-fluid line only when the system pressure is reached.<br>
This has the disadvantage that, as a result of the increase in<br>
pressure, the valve opens, which valve is supposed to separate<br><br>
the suction jet pump from the fuel supply for the starting<br>
process. A portion of the fuel thus reaches the suction jet<br>
pump and is not available for the internal combustion<br><br>
engine. In order to nevertheless ensure a sufficient supply of<br>
the internal combustion engine with fuel during a starting<br>
process, the fuel pump must be dimensioned such that it, as<br>
well as the increased demand on the internal combustion engine,<br>
also supplies the increased feed quantity for the suction jet<br>
pump as a result of the opened valve. These two increased feed<br>
quantities lead to an overdimensioning of the fuel pump. Such<br>
fuel pumps require significantly more space and are more<br>
costly.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to create a suction<br>
jet pump which only operates when the fuel supply system<br>
operates with system pressure.<br>
According to the invention, the object is achieved in that a<br>
throughflow opening is arranged in the housing, that a valve<br>
body is arranged on both sides of the throughflow opening such<br>
that the throughflow opening can be closed both on the inlet<br>
side and on the outlet side, and that at least one spring is<br>
arranged within the housing such that it holds the valve body<br>
in a position closing the throughflow opening on the outlet<br>
side until the system pressure is reached.<br>
The valve arranged in the working-fluid line of the suction jet<br>
pump is closed in the depressurized state in that the spring<br>
holds the valve body on the outlet side in a position closing<br>
the throughflow opening. As soon as the fuel pump reaches<br>
system pressure, the force acting on the valve body is larger<br>
than the spring force, as a result of which the valve body is<br>
moved out of the position closing the throughflow opening on<br>
the outlet side. The valve is thus open and fuel can reach the<br>
suction jet pump. If the pressure rises above the system<br>
pressure during a starting process, the valve body is moved<br><br>
further counter to the spring force until it reaches a position<br>
closing the throughflow opening on the inlet side,<br><br>
as a result of which the valve closes. The valve according to<br>
the invention allows operation of the suction jet pump in a<br>
presettable pressure range, wherein the suction jet pump is<br>
switched off above and below this pressure range. This means<br>
that the suction jet pump operates only under normal<br>
conditions, while, in critical situations in which the supply<br>
of the internal combustion engine with fuel is supposed to be<br>
ensured, the fuel fed by the fuel pump only reaches the<br>
internal combustion engine. The fuel pump can thus be of<br>
smaller dimensions since the flow rate of the fuel pump is only<br>
determined by the internal combustion engine and the suction<br>
jet pump in the case of system pressure, while in the case of<br>
operation of the fuel pump above the system pressure the flow<br>
rate is exclusively determined by the internal combustion<br>
engine as a result of the switching off of the suction jet<br>
pump.<br>
The throughflow opening is of a particularly simple<br>
configuration if it is embodied as a diaphragm.<br>
A reliable sealing off is achieved according to another<br>
advantageous configuration in that the valve body possesses two<br>
sealing elements which interact on the inlet side and the<br>
outlet side with a sealing seat at the throughflow opening.<br>
The sealing elements of the valve body respectively comprise in<br>
a simple and thus low-cost formation an annular disk, which<br>
annular disks are arranged on the valve body.<br>
The structure of the valve body is simplified according to<br>
another configuration if the sealing elements are arranged on<br>
both sides of the diaphragm relative to the direction of flow<br>
such that they surround the throughflow opening.<br><br>
A defined position of the valve body in the open position in<br>
the case of system pressure is achieved in a further<br>
configuration<br><br>
in that a second spring is arranged relative to the first<br>
spring, wherein the first spring is designed with respect to<br>
the opening pressure and the second spring allows a further<br>
movement of the valve body only above the system pressure. In<br>
this manner, a movement of the valve body is prevented in the<br>
case of a system pressure in the open position.<br>
The springs used can be both pressure springs and tension<br>
springs, wherein the springs are arranged between the housing<br>
and the valve body.<br>
Insofar as pressure springs are used, these can also be<br>
arranged in a different configuration between the valve body<br>
and the throughflow opening. For improved guidance and<br>
receiving of the pressure springs, a shoulder is formed on the<br>
valve body in a further configuration.<br>
The invention is described in greater detail with reference to<br>
several exemplary embodiments. In the drawings<br>
Figure 1: shows a schematic representation of a fuel tank with<br>
a feed unit and a suction jet pump according to the<br>
invention,<br>
Figures<br>
2 to 4: show a schematic representation of the valve of the<br>
suction jet pump from Fig. 1 in various positions and<br>
Figures<br>
5 to 7: show further embodiments of the valve according to Fig.<br>
2.<br>
Figure 1 shows schematically a fuel tank 1 of a motor vehicle<br>
with a feed unit 2 arranged therein for feeding fuel to an<br><br>
internal combustion engine 3. Feed unit 2 has a fuel pump 5<br>
driven by an electric motor 4<br><br>
and is connected via a feed line 6 to internal combustion<br>
engine 3. A working-fluid line 7 leads from feed line 6 to a<br>
suction jet pump 8 which feeds fuel to feed unit 2. As well as<br>
working-fluid line 7, suction jet pump 8 comprises a valve 9<br>
arranged in working-fluid line 7, a driving jet nozzle 10<br>
connected to working-fluid line 7, a mixing tube 11 and an<br>
intake opening 12, by means of which fuel is sucked into mixing<br>
tube 11 by the fuel escaping from driving jet nozzle 10.<br>
Figure 2 shows schematically a first embodiment of valve 9 from<br>
Figure 1. The direction of flow is marked by an arrow. Valve 9<br>
comprises a valve housing 13 with an inlet 14 and an outlet 15.<br>
A diaphragm 16 is arranged in valve housing 13, which diaphragm<br>
16 has a throughflow opening 17. Valve 9 possesses a valve body<br>
18 with two disk-like regions 19, 20 which are connected to one<br>
another via a central part penetrating through throughflow<br>
opening 17 such that disk-shaped regions 19, 20 are arranged on<br>
the inlet side and outlet side of throughflow opening 17. Both<br>
regions 19, 20 have disk-shaped sealing elements 21, 22 which<br>
interact with sealing seats 23, 24 of diaphragm 16. A pressure<br>
spring 25 is arranged on the outlet side, which pressure spring<br>
25 moves valve body 18 counter to the direction of flow. The<br>
representation shows the depressurized state in which no fuel<br>
flows through valve 9. As a result of the spring force, valve<br>
body 18 lies on the outlet side against diaphragm 16, wherein<br>
sealing element 21 interacts with sealing seat 23 and thus<br>
closes throughflow opening 17.<br>
Figure 3 shows valve 9 in the case of system pressure. The fuel<br>
flowing in with system pressure via inlet 14 generates a force<br>
acting in the direction of flow, which force opposes the spring<br>
force. Pressure spring 25 is therein designed such that in the<br>
case of system pressure valve body 18 is moved so far in<br><br>
the direction of flow that both sealing elements 21, 22 are not<br>
in contact with sealing seats 23, 24. Throughflow opening 17 is<br>
thus free and the fuel can flow through valve 9 to outlet 15<br>
and further to the suction jet pump.<br>
Figure 4 shows valve 9 during a starting process of the<br>
internal combustion engine. Herein, the fuel pump is actuated<br>
such that the pressure in the feed line is increased for a<br>
short time. The increased pressure thus also acts in the<br>
working-fluid line and in inlet 14 of valve 9. Since the spring<br>
force generated by pressure spring 25 is smaller than the force<br>
acting on valve body 18 as a result of the increased pressure,<br>
valve body 18 is moved further in the direction of flow until<br>
sealing element 22 of region 20 lies against inlet-side sealing<br>
seat 24 of diaphragm 16. Throughflow opening 17 is thus closed<br>
so that no fuel reaches the suction jet pump during the<br>
starting process.<br>
Valve 9 shown in Figure 5 differs from the valve according to<br>
Figure 2 in the arrangement of pressure spring 25. Pressure<br>
spring 25 is supported between diaphragm 16 and region 20 of<br>
valve body 18. Region 20 possesses a shoulder 26 for this<br>
purpose. Shoulder 26 is used on the one hand as a guide for<br>
pressure spring 25 and ensures on the other hand sufficient<br>
space in the axial extension if pressure spring 25 is<br>
compressed.<br>
Figure 6 shows valve 9 with a tension spring 27 which is<br>
fastened on the inlet side between housing 13 and valve body 18<br>
and moves valve body 18 in the depressurized state counter to<br>
the direction of flow such that sealing element 21 interacts<br>
with sealing seat 23 of diaphragm 16 such that valve 9 is<br>
closed.<br><br>
In a further configuration, Figure 7 shows valve 9 in the case<br>
of system pressure. Herein, two pressure springs 25, 28<br><br>
are arranged on the outlet side. Pressure spring 25 behaves in<br>
accordance with its design as in Figures 2 to 4. Pressure<br>
spring 28 is harder and is designed with a shorter length,<br>
wherein the length and the spring rigidity of pressure spring<br>
28 are selected such that, in the case of system pressure,<br>
valve body 18 is moved in the direction of flow as a result of<br>
the force acting on it until it lies against pressure spring 28<br>
without pressure spring 28 being compressed. Valve 9 in an open<br>
position is located in this position. In this manner, a defined<br>
position is created for valve body 18 in the case of system<br>
pressure. In the case of a further pressure increase in the<br>
event of a starting process, the force acting on valve body 18<br>
is larger than the spring forces of pressure springs 25, 28<br>
such that the valve behaves as in Figure 4.<br><br>
