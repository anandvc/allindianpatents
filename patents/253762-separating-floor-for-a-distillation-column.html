				<td>Separating floor for a distillation column<br>
The invention relates to a separating floor for a column for distillation of a poly-<br>
merisable material, a process for production of a polymerisable material and the<br>
use of a polymerisable material obtainable by the above process, as well as<br>
chemical products which are based on the polymerisable material as starting mate-<br>
rial.<br>
As polymerisable material, in general, all monomers used in radical polymerisa-<br>
tion come into consideration. Methacrylic acid, acrylic acid, styrene or a-methyl<br>
styrene fall hereunder; in particular, methacrylic acid or acrylic acid, in the fol-<br>
lowing referred to collectively as "(meth)acrylic acid" should be mentioned,<br>
whereby acrylic acid is particularly preferred.<br>
The standards of purity of monomers used on a large scale for polymerisation are<br>
ever increasing. Ever higher purity standards are also demanded of mass plastics.<br>
This is particularly the case for polymers used in the areas of medicine or hygiene.<br>
Water or aqueous liquids-absorbing polymers, which are generally referred to as<br>
"superabsorbers", are an important component of many products in medical and<br>
hygiene areas. Preferably, superabsorbers are used in diapers, feminine hygiene<br>
products and incontinence articles. Superabsorbers, as well as other artificial ma-<br>
terials, are often obtained by radical polymerisation of monomers comprising a<br>
double bond. Such monomers comprising a double bond, such as (meth)acrylic<br>
acid are, thus, very reactive substances, which tend to radically polymerise spon-<br>
taneously under thermal stress.<br>
Distillation is a suitable processing method which has been proven on a large<br>
scale for obtaining high purities. Because of the thermal stress on the monomer to<br><br>
be purified which occurs during distillation, the monomer tends, however, to un-<br>
dergo undesired polymerisation. Here, despite addition of inhibitors, polymerisa-<br>
tion seeds form, initially mostly in dead zones through overheating and too long<br>
residence times of the monomer, which seeds grow in the course of time and lead<br>
to an ever increasing formation of undesired polymer, which leads to a shutting<br>
down of the distillation operation and to a time-consuming cleaning of the distilla-<br>
tion apparatus, which is very costly and linked with a significant strain for man<br>
and the environment.<br>
Distillation columns are, for example, known from WO 00/53561. In this docu-<br>
ment "Dual-Flow-Floors" are disclosed as column floors, with which the separa-<br>
tion performance should be increased, but no measures are disclosed with which<br>
the above disadvantages should be counteracted.<br>
In principle, it is the object of the present invention to overcome the disadvanta-<br>
geous linked to the state of the art.<br>
It is, in particular, an aim of the present invention to increase the temporal separa-<br>
tion of maintenance intervals of distillation columns of this type, whereby, pref-<br>
erably, the downtimes are also significantly reduced.<br>
A further object lies in achieving as high a degree of purity as possible in the<br>
course of the distillation process by means of more than one separating floor,<br>
whereby at each separation stage, exactly reproducible and/or pre-determined<br>
chemical processes take place.<br><br>
It is a farther object of the invention to provide a homogenous distribution of the<br>
polymerisable material in fluid or gaseous phase in a separation stage, without<br>
formation of polymer deposits.<br>
The above-mentioned object are solved by a separating floor with the features of<br>
claim 1, a process according to claim 14, a use according to claim 20 and 22 and a<br>
product according to claim 21 and 23. Further advantageous embodiments of the<br>
separating floor are described in the respective dependent claims, whereby the<br>
further advantageous embodiments mentioned therein can also be used in combi-<br>
nation with each other.<br>
The separating floor according to the invention for a column for distillation of a<br>
polymerisable material comprises at least one floor plate with a plurality of open-<br>
ings and at least one attachment which divides the plurality of openings into<br>
groups, whereby with the at least one attachment, apertures which can be flowed<br>
through by a fluid are formed.<br>
The floor plate preferably comprises metallic material, although other tempera-<br>
ture- and acid-resistant material can also be used. The outer design of the floor<br>
plate is to be selected with respect to the distillation column, so that this can com-<br>
prise, for example, round, square or similar forms. The floor plate is provided with<br>
a plurality of opening, whereby it is, in particular, intended that a fluid and/or gas<br>
exchange through the floor plate is possible.<br>
The openings are, thus, preferably so large that it is possible to retain the fluid<br>
material, and preferably a bubbling layer for heat and component exchange forms<br>
between the fluid and vapour material. The arrangement of the openings with re-<br>
spect to the floor plate can, in principal, be freely selected and should be aligned<br><br>
with the conditions on the inside of the column. It is thus, for example, possible to<br>
provide a uniform distribution of the openings over the whole floor plate, on the<br>
other hand, it can also be necessary to take a design of the floor plate which devi-<br>
ates herefrom. This would be, for example, the case, if edge regions of the floor<br>
plate were necessary for positioning in the column. A similar case is, for example,<br>
if the floor plate must be supported on one side because of its spatial extension<br>
and the supports would close openings of this type. It is then advantageous to pro-<br>
vide no openings in these regions of the floor plate.<br>
It is now proposed that the attachment divides the plurality of openings into<br>
groups, whereby with the at least one attachment, apertures are formed which can<br>
be flowed through by a fluid. A foreground function of this attachment is to influ-<br>
ence the movement of the fluid, which has collected on the floor plate, so that, on<br>
the one hand, a high flow speed is avoided, and on the other hand, however, that<br>
no "dead zones" are formed in which relatively long resistance times of the fluids<br>
prevail.<br>
Particularly high flow speeds can, for example, occur if the gaseous material pass-<br>
ing through the floor plate is not introduced completely uniformly over the cross-<br>
section of the floor plate, but, rather, in one region a particularly strong source is<br>
formed. A wave like stimulus to the fluid can then occur. In order to prevent a<br>
wave front of this type spreading over the whole floor plate and thus leading to<br>
different fluid levels on the floor plate, the attachment serves as a type of wave<br>
breaker, in that upper fluid or vapour bubble layers are calmed with respect<br>
waves.<br>
Indeed, the spatially strictly delimited division of the floor plates from each other<br>
into different sectors does not necessarily guarantee an improved behaviour of the<br>
fluid. Rather, by means of the division, groups of openings can be formed, which<br><br>
are less impinged on by the polymerisable material, so that, with respect to the<br>
sectors, different degrees of distillation can occur. For this reason, it is proposed<br>
that the fluid is indeed restricted in its freedom of movement by the attachment,<br>
but is not restricted with respect to the reachability of a plurality of openings of<br>
other sectors (in particular of all openings). This is achieved in that with the at-<br>
tachment, apertures which can be flowed through by a fluid are still formed. The<br>
apertures ensure that the fluid can preferably flow towards any opening of the<br>
floor plate.<br>
The design of the aperture should also be selected here taking into account the<br>
fluid, the polymerisable material, the column or its operation. By way of example,<br>
round apertures, square apertures, slots, etc. are mentioned here. It should also be<br>
clarified that the apertures can be fully or partially limited and/or formed by the<br>
attachment. In principal, it is advantageous in the arrangement of such apertures,<br>
to arrange these in lower regions, i.e. near to the floor plate. In this way it is en-<br>
sured that, on the one hand, the propagation of the wave movement of the upper<br>
liquid or fluid layers is interrupted, while deeper-lying layers near to different<br>
groups of openings can communicate with each other. Attention should be paid<br>
that the apertures are designed so that as few as possible, preferably no, dead<br>
zones are formed, whereby in this context, zones are meant in which the fluid has<br>
a relatively long residence time.<br>
The fluid tends to polymerise in dead zones of this type, whereby this can lead in<br>
the long term to at least partial blocking of the openings. This has the result that<br>
the gas or fluid exchange then only occurs through a smaller number of openings,<br>
whereby the increasing gas pressure results in an additional wave stimulus of the<br>
fluid. With increasing polymerisation of material, the distillation step can no<br>
longer be carried out in the desired quality, making purification and/or mainte-<br>
nance measures necessary. This in turn has the result that the distillation process<br><br>
must be interrupted and the column shut down. The separating floors must be fur-<br>
ther cleaned in a time-consuming process and then remounted. By means of the<br>
herein-proposed attachment on the floor plate, such complex measures can at least<br>
be deferred over a longer time period. Because of the fact that polymer deposits<br>
occur at significantly fewer positions, the purification can also be carried out more<br>
quickly. This means that the distillation column, on the one hand, is ready for op-<br>
eration over a longer time period with the desired distillation results, on the other<br>
hand, however, the purification procedure can be carried out more quickly and,<br>
thus, the down times of the distillation column are shortened.<br>
According to an advantageous further form of the separating floor, the apertures<br>
extend beyond the floor plate over a height in the range from 1 mm to 100 mm,<br>
preferably from 5 mm to 50 mm and particularly preferably from 10 mm to<br>
30 mm. This means, in particular, that the apertures are only partially limited by<br>
the attachment. They are, in this case, at least also partially limited by the floor<br>
plate. It is here possible, that the apertures are only limited by the floor plate and<br>
the attachment, however, further components can also be used for limitation of the<br>
apertures. The height is selected such the fluid in the proximity of the floor plate<br>
can move or flow relatively unhindered, and, thus, it is ensured that the liquid<br>
and/or the fluid can flow uniformly towards the openings. At the same time, the<br>
liquid and/or fluid layers which are far from the floor plate are pulled through by<br>
the attachment.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment the at least one attachment comprises at<br>
least one straight bar. Such an embodiment of the attachment should then be se-<br>
lected if the floor plate also has straight edges, i.e. is, in particular, square or quad-<br>
ratic. In this way, it is possible in a simple way, to divide the openings in the floor<br>
plate in groups of almost equal number. It can also, however, be necessary that the<br><br>
attachment, in addition to linear bars and/or sections, comprises curved guide sur-<br>
faces, which effect a flow of the appearing fluid in such way that dead zones near<br>
to the attachment are avoided. The orientation of the bar with respect to the floor<br>
plate can, in principle, be freely selected. This also means that the linear bar ex-<br>
tends over the entire floor plate or, however, also only part-regions of the floor<br>
plates.<br>
In exactly this context, it is advantageous that the attachment has at least one of<br>
the following configurations:<br>
a)	more than one attachment is provided with a bar;<br>
b)	one attachment is provided with more than one bar, preferably joined to-<br>
gether with each other.<br>
This means, in particular, that the attachment can be constructed as component<br>
with a plurality of different or same bars, on the other hand, one-piece attachments<br>
and/or connecting systems made from more than one bar, preferably connected<br>
with each other by means of joining technology, are suitable for production. The<br>
bars can, in connection systems of this type, be removable or connected to each<br>
other by means of material connection. As a different criterion with these two<br>
configurations can, for example, be mentioned that the more than one attachments<br>
comprising respectively one bar are merely in contact with each other by means of<br>
the floor plate and/or other components of the column, while with a one-piece,<br>
more complex attachment and/or the bars which are connected together to form an<br>
attachment, a direct connection and/or link by means of components of the bar<br>
and/or of the attachment is formed itself. While alternative (a) enables a very<br>
flexible arrangement of the bars with respect to each other, the configuration (b)<br>
has the advantage that this can be mounted simply and with little time expendi-<br><br>
ture. In view of these points, it can be advantageous that in a central region, the<br>
complex attachment formed from more than one bar is used, while in the edge<br>
areas, depending on the form and/or design of the attachment or of the column,<br>
additional individual bars are positioned for completion of the first attachment. In<br>
this way, it can be ensured that, for example, groups of openings are formed with<br>
substantially the same number.<br>
According to an advantageous further development, the at least one bar has a<br>
length, whereby the plurality of apertures is limited at least partially by at least<br>
one of the following elements:<br>
(a)	at least one rod, which is part of the bar;<br>
(b)	at least one spacer, which is a separate part.<br>
whereby these elements comprise a width and the sum of the widths of the ele-<br>
ments is less than 80 %, preferably less than 60 %, in particular less than 40 % of<br>
the length of the bar. Besides the possibility of fixing the attachment mentioned<br>
with a certain distance with respect to the floor plate at the column and/or the con-<br>
tainer, it is here preferred to propose an easily mountable construction unit with<br>
the floor plate. This means, in particular, that the floor plate with the at least one<br>
attachment can be incorporated together into the column. This has the result that<br>
the at least one attachment should be fixed onto the floor plate itself. It is now<br>
here proposed to effect this by means of rods or spacers or both elements.<br>
The rods, which are themselves parts of the bar, can, for example, be produced by<br>
form-giving processes, such as, for example, pouring, milling or the like. It fol-<br>
lows therefrom that the rods are formed from the same material as the bar itself. It<br>
can be, however, advantageous that the rods and the bar itself are built from dif-<br>
ferent materials, whereby, for example, first the bar is produced in one piece and<br><br>
then the rods are connected to the bar using a joining technology manufacturing<br>
process (removable or non-removable).<br>
Alternatively or in combination thereto, separate spacers can be positioned on the<br>
floor plate, which themselves comprise means for fixing of the bar. This has the<br>
advantage that the bars can, for example, all be formed substantially square,<br>
whereby by means of respective different designs of the spacer, the desired<br>
heights of the apertures can be generated. This results, on the one hand, in a cost-<br>
effective production of the bars and a simple process-dependent adaptation of the<br>
apertures.<br>
The rods and/or spacers serve in particular to stabilise and/or position the bar in<br>
relation to the floor plate. That means that the bar is arranged, for example, in the<br>
edge regions of the floor plate by means of respectively a rod and/or a spacer,<br>
while in the central regions, depending on the length of the bar, an additional ele-<br>
ment (rod and/or spacer) is provided. These then extend preferably to the floor<br>
plate; the rods can, however, also be designed shorter, in order to generate the<br>
certain profile of the apertures, which has, for example, advantageous influences<br>
with respect to the flow behaviour of the fluid.<br>
As already mentioned, it is particularly advantageous that the sum of the widths of<br>
the rods and/or spacers is less than 8 %, preferably less than 60 % and particularly<br>
preferably less than 40 % of the length of the bar. It is, accordingly, preferred that<br>
as few as possible, and preferably relatively slim elements for stabilisation of the<br>
bar should be used. This ensures that the flow of the fluid in the proximity of the<br>
floor plate can propagate relatively unhindered. It can be advantageous hereby to<br>
equip the bars and/or spacers with a flow-technical favourable profile, in particu-<br><br>
lar to form suitable edges for flowing around (e.g. round cross-section forms).<br>
Corresponding to the flow speed appearing, it can be necessary to provide an in-<br>
creased number of rods and/or spacers, but to design these relatively thin, while in<br>
other applications, respectively one rod and/or one spacer in the edge region of the<br>
floor plate is sufficient, but the central region is free from rods and/or spacers. By<br>
means of clarification, it should be maintained here that the length of the bar de-<br>
scribes the longest extension in a direction and the width of the rods and/or of the<br>
spacers should be determined in the same direction, whereby the widths and the<br>
lengths can be arranged in one level or in levels which are parallel to each other.<br>
According to yet a further design, the separating floor is designed such that the at<br>
least one attachment forms sectors of the floor plate with respectively one group<br>
of openings, whereby the sectors preferably comprise an area in the range from<br>
1.2 m2 to 0.3 m2, preferably 1.0 m2 to 0.5 m2 and in particular 0.8 m2 to 0.6 m2. In<br>
principle, separating floors of this type can be formed with a one-piece or a multi-<br>
piece floor plate and from more than one individual floor plate, whereby it is, in<br>
principle, ensured that an unevenness of the floor plate of less than 3 mm/m, in<br>
particular less than 2 mm/m and preferably less than 1 mm/m is achieved. A<br>
round floor plate preferably has, in total, a diameter in the range from 2 m to 7 m,<br>
in particular 3 m and 5 m. In this way, the openings in the floor plate preferably<br>
have a diameter of 15 mm to 40 mm, in particular from 20 mm to 30 mm. It is<br>
further proposed that the separating floor has a cover plate, whereby this is pref-<br>
erably arranged at a separation in the range from 60 mm to 200 mm, preferably<br>
from 80 mm to 150 mm and particularly preferably from 100 mm to 120 mm from<br>
the floor plate, and, in particular, likewise comprises a plurality of openings.<br>
The cover plate has a plurality of different functions. Thus, for example, one func-<br>
tion can be seen as being that in this way, it is hindered or at least substantially<br><br>
reduced that the rising vapour-form material pulls with it parts of the liquid mate-<br>
rial accumulated on the floor plate. In this way, the separated liquid which accu-<br>
mulates at the cover plate when the vapour-form material rises, is uniformly dis-<br>
tributed again and conducted back down to the floor plate. In order to strengthen-<br>
ing this effect, the cover plate comprises openings, which do not run parallel to<br>
the preferred flow direction of the vapour-form material, but, rather, diagonally<br>
thereto, e.g. within an angle between 10° and 50°. In this way, a more intensive<br>
contact of the material with the cover plate is enabled. These advantageous effects<br>
lead, individually and particularly in combination with each other, to an increase<br>
of the efficiency of the separating floor. Furthermore, the cover plate can favour at<br>
least the material exchange or the heat exchange, whereby a further improvement<br>
of the separation performance is created. At the same time, a uniform flowing<br>
away of the vapour-form material from the separating floor through which it has<br>
just passed to the next is enabled. Accordingly, the cover plate functions like a<br>
flow rectifier, which ensures a uniform flow to the following separating floor.<br>
Accordingly, the cover plate can be designed exactly like such a flow rectifier,<br>
with a grating structure or honeycomb structure or a hole plate similar to the floor<br>
plate. In the design of the cover plate according to a honeycomb structure of more<br>
than one structured plate layer, which form channels which can be flown through,<br>
the cover plate has a thickness of at least 50 mm, preferably at least 100 mm, in<br>
particular 150 mm, however, particular preferably not greater than 300 mm.<br>
According to an advantageous further development of the separating floor, this<br>
comprises a holder, which comprises at least one solid carrier, which is in contact<br>
with the side of the floor plate which faces away from the at least one attachment,<br>
preferably over at least a dimension in the range from 200 mm to 1000 mm, pref-<br>
erably from 350 mm to 800 mm and particularly preferably from 400 mm to<br>
600 mm. It also possible that the carriers are at least partially directly substantially<br>
perpendicular to each other and are optionally connected to each other with con-<br><br>
nection elements, whereby the carriers can be provided in different directions with<br>
different dimensions to each other.<br>
The holder mentioned can take over a plurality of functions, whereby, here, in<br>
particular, at least one of the following functions stands in the foreground: The<br>
fixing of the separating floor in relation to the column and/or further separating<br>
floors, or the increase of the stiffness of the separating floor. If this holder serves<br>
for fixing, these are preferably arranged such that it extends to the edge region of<br>
the separating floor, so that it can be connected to components of adjacent con-<br>
stituents (e.g. of the column of further separating floors). The function relating to<br>
the increase of the stiffness of the separating floor then comes, in particular, into<br>
the foreground if the separating floor or all floor plates together spans an area of<br>
more than 10 m2, preferably more than 13 m2 and particularly preferably more<br>
than 15 m2. With increasing sides of the separating floor, it is ensured by use of<br>
the holders that the floor plate is, nonetheless, even, and that in central regions, a<br>
sinking of the floor plate in relation to the edge regions is avoided. Unevennesses<br>
of the floor plate of this type would have the result that in proximity to the floor<br>
plate, border layers would be formed, which have a reduced tendency to flow and<br>
thus tend to polymerise. Since these unevennesses would have relatively large<br>
areas, a very large numbers of openings could be blocked by these polymerisation<br>
deposits. These processes which restrict the functional capability of the distillation<br>
column can be avoided by the use of the here-proposed holders.<br>
In this respect, it should be mentioned that by a solid carrier should be understood<br>
in particular a carrier without hollow spaces in its interior, i.e. spaces which are<br>
completely surrounded by the material of the carrier, whereby inclusions or cavi-<br>
ties necessary for production are excepted. Preferably, the carriers are also not<br>
designed such that stiff, yet hollow space-forming profiles are provided. Although<br><br>
it is, in principal, possible, to produce such holders from U-profiles with relatively<br>
thin walls, here, relatively thick-walled, solid carriers are preferably proposed.<br>
The carriers are affixed to the side of the floor plate which is facing away from the<br>
fluid level. Accordingly, they do not serve for direct flow influencing, but only<br>
optionally as flowing away edges or services for fluid or liquid which has passed<br>
through the openings of the floor plates or which is condensed at the holder or at<br>
the separating plate.<br>
According to a further embodiment, the at least one carrier has, near the floor<br>
plate, at least one recess with an extension, whereby the sum of the extensions lies<br>
at least in the range from 80 % to 30 %, preferably from 70 % to 40 % and par-<br>
ticularly preferably from 60 % to 55 % of the dimension 46. The recesses have<br>
inter alia the function of enabling a flowing through with the vapour-form mate-<br>
rial, and optionally of representing tear edges for fluid flows rippling towards the<br>
carrier. The greater the surface of such a carrier, the more the fluid which has<br>
passed through the openings can collect there. Thus, the risk would also exist that<br>
border layers are formed, in which polymerisation could rapidly occur. For this<br>
reason, it is here proposed that, already after short flow paths, edges are formed<br>
which prevent a further flow along the carrier as a result of gravity. These edges<br>
have the result that, for example, drops form, which separate from the carrier and<br>
continue to move freely in the direction of the lower floor of the distillation col-<br>
umn or separating floors lying therebetween. In order to ensure that, on the one<br>
hand, such advantageous dropping away of the fluid is ensured, but on the other<br>
hand, also, the stiffness-increasing property of the carrier is ensured, it is proposed<br>
that the sum of the dimensions lies in the above-mentioned percentage region of<br>
the dimension. It is also noted in this context that the dimension should be deter-<br>
mined in the direction of the longest extension of a carrier, whereby the extension<br>
of the recesses should be determined in the same direction, so that extension and<br><br>
dimension lie in the same level of the carrier or in levels of the carrier which are<br>
parallel to each other.<br>
According to a further embodiment, the carrier is designed T-shaped, whereby the<br>
at least one recess is arranged in the carrier part which is substantially perpendicu-<br>
lar to the floor plate. The T-shaped embodiment has the advantage that with the<br>
upper carrier part which lies substantially parallel to the floor plate, a contact area<br>
is formed with respect to the floor plate, which ensures an even and relatively<br>
large surface support. In this way, sufficient possibilities for connecting to the<br>
floor plate are given. In this respect, it is further advantageous that the floor plate<br>
comprises no openings in the region of the installation with the carrier. Further-<br>
more, this carrier part lying substantially parallel to the floor plate has the advan-<br>
tage that upon flowing away of the fluid, the first tear edge is formed already after<br>
a short path, namely, exactly there where the upper carrier part stops. The carrier<br>
part arranged substantially perpendicular to the floor plate is here positioned so far<br>
from this edge that an accumulation of fluid as a result of the surface tension in<br>
the region of the meeting of the upper and lower carrier part is avoided.<br>
It should be taken into account that the gaseous, polymerisable material can con-<br>
dense at the lower side of the carrier part lying substantially parallel to the floor<br>
plate, and now the possibility exists that this liquid flows away at the carrier part<br>
lying substantially perpendicular to the floor plate. For this reason, the arrange-<br>
ment of at least one recess is proposed. Furthermore, the provision of such re-<br>
cesses is advantageous because in this way, material is economised and thus the<br>
production costs, the component weight, and also the human strength for mount-<br>
ing of such separating floors can be considerably reduced. Taking these points<br>
into account, the recesses can also be designed according to the criteria of light<br><br>
building methods, as are already often used. The points of view of the light con-<br>
struction methods can be further strengthened by appropriate selection of material.<br>
According to an advantageous further embodiment of the separating floor, it is<br>
proposed that the at least one T-shaped carrier has a foot arranged parallel to the<br>
floor plate, with a dimension in the range from 50 mm to 100 mm, preferably<br>
from 60 mm to 90 mm and particularly preferably within 70 mm to 80 mm,<br>
whereby the at least one recess is arranged at a distance of less than 10 mm from,<br>
in particular directly at the foot, and preferably has a width in the range from<br>
40 mm to 120 mm, preferably from 60 mm to 100 mm and particularly preferably<br>
from 75 mm to 85 mm. For the production of such a carrier, it is also possible to<br>
connect more than one individual part removably (e.g. with connecting elements)<br>
or non-removably (e.g. by means of weld-connections) with each other. The di-<br>
mensioning of the T-shaped carrier occurs substantially taking into account two<br>
interests. On the one hand, care should be taken that the carrier provides suffi-<br>
ciently the desired stiffness of the separating floor; on the other hand, it should be<br>
taken into account that the head capacity of such a carrier can play an important<br>
role with respect to the operation of the distillation column. This means that with<br>
temperature variations inside the column, overly large temperature differences<br>
between the gas flowing past and the carrier must not occur, since this results in<br>
an increased risk of condensation and/or polymerisation of the material.<br>
It is further proposed that the at least one carrier and the least one attachment are<br>
arranged perpendicular to each other. This means that the carrier and the at least<br>
one attachment form a type of framework which results in stabilisation of the<br>
floor plate in a level. This is increasingly true as the at least one attachment com-<br>
prises direct connection regions with the floor plate (also in the central region).<br>
Such a stiffening of the floor plate by means of such a framework system has the<br><br>
result that the above-described regions concerning the dimension and/or the width<br>
of the T-shaped carrier can be designed more slimly, preferably in regions of the<br>
lower half or the lower third of the value regions given.<br>
It is further proposed that the separating floor is provided at least partially with a<br>
coating, which has an improved glide property for fluids compared to steel. It<br>
should here be mentioned that a coating of this type extends at least partially over<br>
one of the following components: the floor plate, the holder, the attachment, the<br>
spacer. In principle, the coating can extend, starting from the surface of the com-<br>
ponents, over a few micrometers up to a few millimetres (preferably 50 µm to<br>
1000 µm, in particular 100 µm to 800 µm, preferably 200 µm to 400 urn). As<br>
coating, in particular a polyfluorohydrocarbon, preferably Teflon®, polyaniline<br>
varnishes or coatings with a metal ion-free surface (e.g. glass) or also mixtures of<br>
at least two of these types of coatings are proposed. If glass is used as coating<br>
agent, in particular technical glass, which has been obtained from cooled melts of<br>
silicon dioxide (SiO2), calcium oxide (CaO), sodium oxide (Na2O), optionally<br>
with greater amounts of boron trioxide (B2O3), aluminium oxide (Al2O3), lead<br>
oxide (PbO), magnesium oxide (MgO), barium oxide (BaO) or potassium oxide<br>
(K2O) are preferred. Preferably this technical glass consists to at least 50 wt.%,<br>
yet more preferably to at least 65 wt.% and most preferably to at least 80 wt.% of<br>
SiO2.<br>
It is, in principle, also possible to produce the separating floor at least partially<br>
from a non-metallic material, so that a separate coating of the above-mentioned<br>
type is not required. In addition to the above-mentioned materials, plastics or a<br>
composite (e.g. from Teflon® and plastic) can be used for production of at least<br>
one component or of the entire separating floor. The provision of the floor plate<br>
from Teflon® or plastic is particularly advantageous.<br><br>
It should also be mentioned in addition, that it is advantageous that the container<br>
comprises a plurality of separating floors and at least one spray unit is provided,<br>
with which a lower side of at least one separating floor can be sprayed with the<br>
polymerisable material. A spray unit of this type removes effectively partial<br>
amounts of the polymerisable material adhering to the lower side of the separating<br>
floor, so that a polymerisation at these positions can be avoided. The embodiment<br>
is preferred here in which the lowest separating floor of the column is positioned<br>
within reach of such a spray unit. It is here advantageous that the spray unit is<br>
supplied with liquid polymerisable material from the collecting reservoir of the<br>
container and this is sprayed uniformly distributed on the lower side of the sepa-<br>
rating floor. The spray unit preferably comprises a plurality of nozzles, which<br>
form uniformly distributed spray regions over the cross-section of the separating<br>
floor. Particularly preferably, the spray unit is operated with high pressure, e.g. in<br>
the range from 2 to 5 bar, preferably at 3 bar. It is further preferred that the spray<br>
unit is positioned at a small distance to the lower side of the separating floor, pref-<br>
erably at most 1 meter or 50 cm, whereby this can be varied taking into account<br>
the spray region and/or the number of nozzles. The above-described spray unit<br>
should preferably be used in combination with a separating floor of the type de-<br>
scribed here according to the invention. Further details can be found in the figures<br>
description.<br>
The invention further relates to a process for purification of a polymerisable mate-<br>
rial, whereby the polymerisable material in the column according to the invention<br>
is introduced as a material fluid through the inlet and in the inner region is trans-<br>
ferred to an at least partially material gas phase. It is hereby preferred that the ma-<br>
terial gas phase flows with a isotropic density against a first separating floor ar-<br>
ranged above the inlet, whereby within a level between the inlet and the first sepa-<br>
rating floor the maximum deviation from an average volume of the isotropic den-<br><br>
sity is at most 50 %. It is particularly advantageous if the maximum deviation is at<br>
most 10 %, in particular only 5 %. The level here lies preferably relatively tight<br>
and parallel to the first separating floor, in order to ensure a relatively compact<br>
construction of the column. The level lies preferably at most 100 mm below the<br>
first separating floor, the distance of the level from the first separating floor can,<br>
however, also be at most 50 mm or even only at most 10 mm.<br>
A particularly even distillation with a very low tendency to polymerise in the col-<br>
umn is given if the at least one separating floor is designed such that the isotropic<br>
density is also reached in the fluid phase of the polymerisable material. This can<br>
be achieved particularly by the use of a so-called "Dual-Flow-Floor". In this way,<br>
optionally flows of the material gas phase over the separating floor can be imple-<br>
mented with the proposed isotropic density, whereby the maximum deviation oc-<br>
curring is further clearly reduced.<br>
In general, as polymerisable material, according to the invention, all chemical<br>
compounds which tend to polymerise and are known to the skilled person come<br>
into consideration. Preferred polymerisable materials are monomers used in the<br>
production of mass plastics, such as, styrene, a-methyl styrene, methylmethacry-<br>
late, butylacrylate and the like. It is, furthermore, preferred that the polymerisable<br>
material used in the process according to the invention is (meth)acrylic acid. The<br>
term "(meth)acrylic acid" here stands both for the compound with the nomencla-<br>
ture name "acrylic acid" and for the compound with the nomenclature name<br>
"methacrylic acid", whereby of the two, acrylic acid is preferred. It is additionally<br>
preferred that in the process according to the invention, in the inner region an ab-<br>
solute pressure prevails. This pressure preferably lies in the range from 50 to<br>
400 hPa (hectopascal), preferably 100 to 300 hPa and particularly preferably 150<br>
to 250 hPa in the inner region of the column (whereby 1 hPa = 1 mbar = 102 New-<br>
ton/meter2 [N/m2] = 102 Pa).<br><br>
It is additionally preferred in the process according to the invention that the mate-<br>
rial fluid is overheated. In this context, it is preferred that the temperature of the<br>
main component of the material fluid, mostly the polymerisable material, lies at<br>
least 1 °C, preferably at least 5 °C and particularly preferably at least 10 °C above<br>
the boiling temperature of the pure head component of the material fluid.<br>
The invention further relates to a process for production of a polymerisable mate-<br>
rial, whereby the polymerisable material is synthesised from at least one reagent<br>
in a reactor and then subjected to a process according to the invention for purifica-<br>
tion. The synthesis of the polymerisable material is not limited to a particular<br>
process. Rather, all processes known to the skilled person can be considered. In<br>
the synthesis of acrylic acid, a preferably at least two-step gas phase oxidation<br>
reaction, in which preferably in a first step, by catalytic oxidation of propylene,<br>
acrolein is obtained and in a further step, acrylic acid is obtained as gas phase.<br>
This gas phase is then brought into contact, in a quench unit, with a fluid, prefera-<br>
bly water or an organic compound which boils higher than water or a mixture<br>
thereof and indirectly or directly subjected to the process according to the inven-<br>
tion for purification. Details concerning the production and further purification<br>
processes for acrylic acid can be taken from WO 02/055469 and the reference<br>
cited therein, which are hereby referred as part of this disclosure.<br>
In addition, the invention relates to the use of an inlet according to the invention<br>
for distillation of a polymerisable material.<br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to a polymerisable material obtainable accord-<br>
ing to a process according to the invention, whereby the polymerisable material is<br>
preferably acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, particularly preferably acrylic acid.<br><br>
In addition, the invention relates to the use of a polymerisable material according<br>
to the invention, preferably of acrylic acid, as starting material in formed masses,<br>
fibres, sheets, absorbent polymers, in polymers for leather and textile processing,<br>
in polymers for water treatment or in polymers for soap production.<br>
The invention also relates to formed masses, fibres, sheets, absorbent polymers,<br>
polymers for leather and textile processing, polymers for water treatment or<br>
polymers for soap production, at least partially based on a polymerisable material<br>
according to the invention, preferably based on acrylic acid.<br>

Fig. 1 shows schematically and in a section view a column 1 for distillation of<br>
polymerisable material, whereby this comprises a container 2 with a lower floor 8<br>
as an inlet 4 for the polymerisable material. The inlet 4 leads into an inner region<br>
5 of the container 2. As more closely detailed in the following, column 1 com-<br>
prises various means for uniform distribution of the material in the container 2.<br><br>
In order to be able, in principal, to understand the flow course of the polymer-<br>
isable material, its path through column 1 is first described. Generally, the poly-<br>
merisable material is initially present as fluid and is transformed and/or over-<br>
heated into a vapour and/or gaseous state by means of a heater 27. Starting from<br>
heater 27, the material flows in flow direction 25 through an inlet 4 into the inner<br>
region 5 of the container 2. At entry, or a short time after entry into the inner re-<br>
gion 5, the partially fluid, partially vaporous material flows further in flow direc-<br>
tion 25 (here depicted vertically upwards by means of the arrows) towards a sepa-<br>
rating floor 23, in which a first distillation stage is carried out. Condensed compo-<br>
nents of the material in the form of drops fall back in the direction opposed to<br>
flow direction 25 onto the inlet 4 or onto the lower floor 8 of container 2. At the<br>
lowest position, container 2 comprises a collecting reservoir 24, in which the con-<br>
densate collects. This collecting reservoir is connected to a pump 28, which ef-<br>
fects the transport away of the condensate in the collecting reservoir 24 from col-<br>
umn 1.<br>
Upon closer observation of inlet 4, it can first be seen that this has an entry orifice<br>
13 and an exit orifice 14, whereby, here, the exit orifice 14 is arranged closer and<br>
substantially parallel to the lower floor 8 of container 2. The inlet 4 is depicted as<br>
separate component, which extends through an attachment 3 through container 2<br>
into the inner region 5. The inlet 4 comprises straight and bent partial regions,<br>
whereby these are here designed so that the exit orifice 14 is positioned with its<br>
central axis 19 central to the central axis 62 of container 2. On the inside of the<br>
inlet 4, a flow influencer 15 is arranged over a section 18 towards the exit orifice<br>
14. The flow influencer 15 comprises a plurality of baffles 16, which ensure chan-<br>
nels 17 for equilibration of the flow of the polymerisable material on the inside of<br>
the inlet 4. Central to the central axis 19 or to the central axis 62, a conical flow<br>
distributor 20 is arranged such that its tip 21 is closest to the exit orifice 14. As<br>
depicted in fig. 1 by means of the arrow (flow direction 25), the arrangement of<br><br>
the flow distributor 20 in the inner region 5 of the container 2 results in a devia-<br>
tion of the inflowing material, whereby in support, the container 8 is additionally<br>
designed such that the guiding surfaces 61 support the uniform distribution of the<br>
material in the container 2. Furthermore, with the depicted arrangement of the<br>
flow distributor 20, the advantage is achieved that the inflowing material is not<br>
mixed directly with the condensate stored in the collecting reservoir 24, so that the<br>
flow distributor 20 also has a protective function here.<br>
With respect to inlet 4, it should be noted that this is provided with a plurality of<br>
means for thermal insulation with respect to the inner region 5, whereby these are<br>
arranged in partial area 9, which extends over the total outer area 6 of inlet 4,<br>
which is in contact with the inner area 5 of container 2. The inlet 4 is formed as a<br>
double-walled pipe, so that it comprises two jackets 10, which are arranged co-<br>
axial to each other. Between the two jackets 10 a thermally insulated layer 11 is<br>
present as vacuum, whereby the inner surfaces 12 of the jacket 10 are mirrored.<br>
In order to prevent that in particular fluid components of the polymerisable mate-<br>
rial collect and/or remain adhered to the surfaces limiting the inner space 5, the<br>
whole outer surface 6 of the inlet 4, the whole jacket surface and/or tip 21 of the<br>
flow distributor 22 and also the inner wall of the container 2 are provided with the<br>
coating 22, which has an improved glide property for fluids compared to steel.<br>
Fig. 2 shows schematically and in a partial section a separating floor 23, which<br>
comprises a cover plate 41, an attachment 31, a floor plate 29 and a carrier 44.<br>
The fluid 60 is arranged between the cover plate 41 and the floor plate 29. The<br>
gaseous, polymerisable material comes into contact in flow direction 25 with the<br>
fluid 60 through the opening 30 of the floor plate 29, whereby different border<br>
layers form between the floor plate 29 and the cover plate 41. In this way, a fluid<br>
layer 36 can be recognized, which is substantially free from bubbles 59. Above<br><br>
this, a vapour bubble layer 57 and/or a type of foam layer is arranged. This repre-<br>
sents practically a type of border layer between the fluid 60 and the gaseous vol-<br>
ume. Between the cover plate 41 and this vapour bubble layer 57, a droplet<br>
layer 58 is further arranged, whereby this is substantially characterised by a gase-<br>
ous state of the material to be distilled, which is pervaded by fluid drops 26 com-<br>
ing from cover plate 41. While the gaseous material moves from below to above<br>
in flow direction 25 (as depicted in the picture) the fluid 60 follows gravity 55 and<br>
falls in the opposite direction (counter current flow principal) towards the lower<br>
floor 8 (not depicted).<br>
It should further be mentioned at this point that the cover plate 41 is not necessar-<br>
ily constructed in one part but can also be in more than one part. Preferably, the<br>
cover plate 41 comprises a plurality of structured plates and/or plastic elements,<br>
which are piled into packages and between which (preferably not linear) flow pas-<br>
sages form. The plates and/or plastic elements are preferably arranged substan-<br>
tially parallel to the direction of gravity, in particular at a distance 42 from the<br>
floor plate 29 in the range from 100 to 200 mm. The plates and/or plastic elements<br>
are preferably provided in such a way that a thickness of the cover plate 41 or of<br>
the package of about 100 to 200 mm results.<br>
The floor plate 29 comprises a plurality of openings 30, which are divided with<br>
assistance from the attachment 31 into more than one group 32 (see figure 3). The<br>
attachment 31 is, however, designed such that apertures 33 through which fluid<br>
and/or liquid 60 can flow and which ensure, in the direction of arrow 54 (i.e. sub-<br>
stantially parallel to floor plate 29 and/or substantially perpendicular to flow di-<br>
rection 25 of the material), a fluid exchange from openings 30 arranged adjacent<br>
to each other. Attachment 31 is here provided with a coating 22, which has an<br>
improved glide property for fluids compared to steel. At the same time, the at-<br>
tachment 31 functions as separation limiter and/or supporting wall with respect to<br><br>
the two plates 29 and 41. In this way, it is ensured that the cover plate 41 is ar-<br>
ranged at a pre-determined separation 42 from the floor plate 29, preferably paral-<br>
lel to floor plate 29. Taking into account the size and/or height 34 of the apertures<br>
33, it should be recognized that this is formed substantially somewhat smaller<br>
than the fluid layer 56, so that in upper-lying regions of the fluid layer 56 which<br>
are arranged near to the vapour bubble layer 57, the flow is hindered, while near<br>
to the floor plate 29 in the direction of the arrow 54 relatively unhindered fluid<br>
movements are enabled. The cover plate 41 can also be formed as flow rectifier<br>
64, in particular as honeycomb structure 68 with a plurality of channels through<br>
which a fluid can flow.<br>
On the side 45 facing away from attachment 31, a carrier 44 is provided as holder.<br>
The carrier 44 is formed T-shaped and comprises a foot 49 arranged substantially<br>
parallel to floor plate 29, with an imaginary dimension 50 as well as a lower car-<br>
rier part which is substantially perpendicular hereto. Recesses 47 are provided in<br>
the carrier part of the T-shaped carrier 44 substantially perpendicular to the floor<br>
plate 29. In the embodiment example depicted, the recesses 47 are arranged at a<br>
separation 51 of less than 3 mm. In this way, a plurality of tear edges 63 is formed<br>
which have the result that draining fluid (depicted as dashed line) forms drops 26<br>
and comes away from the surface in the direction of gravity 55. In support of this<br>
effect, both the floor plate 29 and the carrier 44 are provided with a coating 22,<br>
which comprises in particular Teflon®.<br>
Fig. 3 shows, schematically and in a top view, the further embodiment of a sepa-<br>
rating floor 23 according to the invention. As can be seen here, the depicted sepa-<br>
rating floor 23 spans the total inner area 5 of the column 1 or of the container 2. It<br>
is, however, also possible that a plurality of separating floors 23 of this type, but<br>
preferably square, are put together in a unified platform, which then spans the<br>
total inner area 5 of the column 1. The round embodiment shown here of the sepa-<br><br>
rating floor 23 comprises a plurality of openings 30, whereby these are divided by<br>
attachment 31 into several groups 32. The attachment 31 comprises a plurality of<br>
bars 35, which are connected in regular arrangement with each other by means of<br>
joining technology. The thus-designed attachment 31 forms sectors 40 of the floor<br>
plate 29 with respectively one group 32 of openings 30. The attachment 31 is de-<br>
signed such that, in the direction of the arrow 54, an exchange of liquid or fluid<br>
from neighbouring sectors 40 is still ensured. With dashed lines are shown in ad-<br>
dition the carriers 44 on the lower side 45 of the floor plate 29 provided with a<br>
coating 22. These are here connected directly to column 1 and serve inter alia to<br>
increase the stability of floor plate 29.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a further section view for illustration of a variant of the separating<br>
floor 23 according to the invention. As can be seen from fig. 4, the holder 43 of<br>
the separating floor 23 is provided with a carrier 44, which is connected by means<br>
of projections 53 to the container 2 of column 1, so that a substantially horizontal<br>
positioning of separating floor 23 in the inner region 5 of column 1 is ensured.<br>
The projections 53 are here shown simplified. In fact, a plurality of adjustment<br>
possibilities can be provided which enable an exact horizontal positioning of the<br>
separating floor 23 in the inner space 5. The carrier 44 shown has a dimension 46<br>
and is T-shaped. Besides the carrier part positioned substantially perpendicular to<br>
floor plate 29, the carrier 44 comprises a foot 49 which serves as support plate for<br>
the floor plate 29. Directly at this foot 49 is attached, in the perpendicular carrier<br>
part, a plurality of recesses 47, whereby these are here formed as semi-circles. The<br>
semi-circular design 47 is not compulsory, but has advantages with respect to<br>
stiffness aspects because of its rounded contours. These recesses 47 can be de-<br>
scribed by an extension 48, which should be determined substantially parallel to<br>
floor plate 29 and/or to foot 49. Perpendicular hereto, the recesses 47 comprise<br>
respectively a width 52. Preferably, the recesses 47 are so designed that the sum<br><br>
of the extensions 48 lies at least in the range from 80 % to 30 %, preferably from<br>
70 % to 40 % and particularly from 60 % to 65 % of the dimension 46.<br>
In fig. 4, above the floor plate 29 is depicted an attachment 31 in the form of bar<br>
35. The bar 35 is fixed by means of spacer 38 in the edge area of the floor plate 29<br>
near to the container 2. By the simple provision of such spacer 38, a gap would<br>
already be generated between the bar 35 and the floor plate 29, which could al-<br>
ready result in the here-described advantageous influencing of the fluid flow. In<br>
fig. 4, for illustration, however, a further particular embodiment of the bar 35 with<br>
individual bars 37 is depicted. The bars 37 and/or the spacer 38 have a breadth 39,<br>
whereby the sum of the breadth 39 is considerable smaller than the length 36 of<br>
the bar 35 (for example less than 50 %). With respect to the above-mentioned per-<br>
centages, it should be mentioned that preferably only the spacers 38 and/or bars<br>
37 with their width 39 go in, which are in direct contact with floor plate 29, i.e.<br>
actually hinder the flow over the total fluid layer. With assistance from the bars 37<br>
and/or the spacers 38, apertures 33 are accordingly formed, which preferably,<br>
starting from the flow plate 29, have a height 34 in a range from 1 mm to 100 mm,<br>
preferably from 5 mm to 50 mm and particularly preferably from 10 mm to<br>
30 mm.<br>
Fig. 5 shows schematically different embodiments of flow rectifiers 64, which<br>
serve to improve the flow of the vaporous polymerisable material towards a sepa-<br>
rating floor 23. In principal, it should first be mentioned that such a flow rectifier<br>
64 fulfils the function of achieving a uniform flow of the polymerisable material<br>
towards the at least one separating floor 23. Uniform in this sense means that<br>
preferably at least one of the factors flow speed and flow direction over the cross-<br>
section of the inner region of the column 1 near to separating floor 23 only has a<br>
deviation in the range of less than 20 %, in particular less than 10 % and advanta-<br>
geously less than 5 %. This means, for example, that with a given flow speed of<br><br>
the vapour-form material of 2 m/s to 5 m/s [meter per second] at most deviations<br>
upstream of the flow rectifier of 1 m/s [50 % of 2 m/s] to 7.5 m/s [150 % of 5 m/s]<br>
are present. With respect to flow direction 25 is meant that starting from a flow<br>
impinging perpendicularly on the at least one separating floor 23 (perpendicular<br>
flow direction towards) a tolerance about this perpendicular flow direction to-<br>
wards of at most 180 °, preferably 120 ° and particularly preferably 72 °, advanta-<br>
geously even only 45 ° and particularly preferably at most 20 ° is present. In re-<br>
spect of this, a symmetrical arrangement of the tolerances in respect of the per-<br>
pendicular flow direction towards is assumed.<br>
The flow rectifier 64 is preferably designed flat and positioned substantially paral-<br>
lel to the at least one separating floor 23 and/or fixed in the inner region 5 of col-<br>
umn 1. The flow rectifier 64 is preferably at least partially made from a corrosion-<br>
and high temperature-resistant material and can be flowed through by a fluid. For<br>
this, in particular, openings are provided which, on the one hand, influence a flow<br>
profile, preferably with respect to speed and/or direction, on the other hand, how-<br>
ever, prevent a blocking or closing of the openings. The flow rectifier 54 extends<br>
preferably over the total inner region 5 of the column 1.<br>
This flow rectifier 64 comprises accordingly at least one of the following ele-<br>
ments: At least one grating structure 67, at least one honeycomb structure 68, at<br>
least one hole plate 69 or a so-called package. These elements can be connected<br>
directly or indirectly to the separating floor 23, in particular be a part of the sepa-<br>
rating floor 23. The grating structure 67 comprises more than one longitudinal,<br>
fibre-like structure, which are connected with each other chaotically or like a web.<br>
Suitable as such longitudinal, fibre-like structures are, for example, coated metal<br>
wires. The honeycomb structures 68 can be produced in one piece or from a plu-<br>
rality of components. The embodiment shown here comprises more than one<br>
smooth and structured plate layer which are connected to form a honeycomb<br><br>
structure 68. The hole plate 69 can, besides the depicted round embodiment, also<br>
be designed square, oval, with plural corners or in another way. The number of<br>
holes preferably is more than 30 % of the total area of the hole plate 69.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a detail of an embodiment of a separating floor 23 comprising a floor<br>
plate 29 with the coating 22 which has a reduced adhesive property for fluids<br>
compared to steel. It can be seen from the depiction that the coating 22 can be<br>
described by means of the parameters layer thickness 71, surface roughness 72<br>
and porosity 73. The coating 22, which preferably comprises polytetrafluoroethyl-<br>
ene is applied to contact surfaces 70, which would otherwise stand in direct con-<br>
tact with the polymerisable material. In this way, it is prevented that the material<br>
accumulates and polymerises.<br>
Fig. 7 shows schematically an installation for production of acrylic acid which<br>
comprises a first gas phase oxidation reactor 76 for oxidation of propylene to ac-<br>
rolein, which is connected to a further gas phase oxidation reactor 77, in which the<br>
acrolein is subjected to a further oxidation to acrylic acid. The acrylic acid gas<br>
mixture thus obtained in the further reactor 77 is fed to a quench device 78, to<br>
which is connected indirectly or directly a column 1 according to the invention. At<br>
the column according to the invention, one or more further purification units 79<br>
can be connected. Among these can be, for example, crystallisation devices such<br>
as layer crystallisers, suspension crystallisers which are connected to wash col-<br>
umns, or extractors or azeotropic distillers. The purification unit 79 is preferably<br>
arranged at a part of column 1 at which the acrylic acid collects with the greatest<br>
purity, whereby it is preferably the column head 80. By means of this design of<br>
device for production of acrylic acid, this is obtained in very high purity, mostly<br>
above 99.8 %. Comparable device designs are likewise conceivable for other po-<br>
lymerisable materials other than acrylic acid.<br><br>
Fig. 8 shows schematically the construction of an experimental arrangement for<br>
determination of this density distribution of the material gas phase. Container 2<br>
and first separating floor 23 are shown with dashed line. With a section 85, below<br>
the separating floor 23 an imaginary level 81 is depicted in which the determina-<br>
tion of the isotropic density distribution in the material gas phase is carried out.<br>
The level 81 is, in the example depicted, free from other components of container<br>
2 or components arranged therein. On opposite-lying regions of the level 81 are<br>
provided a source 82 for a radioactive radiation as well as a corresponding detec-<br>
tor 83 for determination of the amount of impinging radioactive radiation. The<br>
source 82 sends a beam through the central point 87 of level 81 which substan-<br>
tially corresponds to the cross-section of container 2. Furthermore, a further posi-<br>
tion of the source and of the detector is depicted with a dashed line and identified<br>
with (II). The positions (I) and (II) are taken temporally one after the other and<br>
offset with respect to each other with a direction change 86, whereby respectively<br>
a measurement process has been carried out. In this process, the detector 83 has<br>
respectively counted the impinging impulse radiation.<br>
The measurement result is shown schematically in fig. 8 by means of two bar-type<br>
graphs. The measurement was carried out over a pre-determined time-period and<br>
with a certain beam width 88. The detector 83 has generated respectively a graph<br>
which shows the distribution of the count impulses (n) over the beam width 88.<br>
The maximum values of the first measurement (position I) and of the second<br>
measurement (position II) are indicated in the diagram with nI and n. The integral<br>
of the count impulses (n) over the beam width 88 is indicated with AI or A re-<br>
spectively. The value or the form respectively of the respective integral or of the<br>
value of the count impulse is characteristic for the density of the medium through<br>
which the beam has passed or for the material gas phase through which the beam<br>
has passed. A bar-type form of the integrals or a high value of the count impulse<br>
shows that a very large proportion of the radiation emitted from source 82 has<br><br>
reached detector 83. Conversely, a very low value of the count impulse or a sharp<br>
form of the graph indicates a denser medium through which at least part of the<br>
radioactive radiation did not pass.<br>
If a measurement of this type is carried out at more than one position (I, II, ...)<br>
with a previously described device, in particular with an inventive device, a<br>
maximum deviation of the isotropic density within the level 81 between inlet 4<br>
and the first separating floor 23 is at most 15 %. For the depicted embodiment<br>
example, this means that the value of nI is at least 70 % of nn. Because the number<br>
of detected impulses is characteristic for the density of the material gas phase<br>
through which the beam has passed, the parameter can be used as a measure for<br>
the density. Accordingly, in this way, it can be established that an isotropic den-<br>
sity distribution according to the invention is present.<br>
Fig. 9 shows schematically a detail of a particular form of a wave-form floor plate<br>
29 of a separating floor 23. Such a floor plate 29, in particular with the following<br>
properties, has a plurality of holes 30 and is particularly advantageous, in combi-<br>
nation with the here-described embodiment variants but also independent there-<br>
from. The advantage of a wave-form floor plate 29 is that at the lower side the<br>
adhering fluid drops 26 run down to the wave troughs 90 and mingle locally with<br>
each other there. This further reduces the danger of polymerisation. At the same<br>
time, this accumulation of fluid leads to this also finally detaching. With a wave<br>
form of this floor plate 29, attachment 31, as, for example, shown in fig. 2 and 3,<br>
can be dispensed with, since the wave form itself provides a sort of separation,<br>
which hinders an undesired flowing back and forth of the fluid. Preferably, more<br>
than one or even all separating floors 23 of a column 1 are equipped with such<br>
wave-form floor plates 29. Preferably, in this case, floor plates 23 positioned adja-<br>
cent to each other are arranged offset to each other with respect to the positioning<br><br>
and/or orientation of the wave form, in particular in the form that the wave peaks<br>
89 or wave troughs 90 respectively of floor plates 29 form an angle of about 90°.<br>
Particularly preferably, the form of the floor plate 29 is with a wave height 92 in<br>
the range from 0.5 to 5.0 cm; in particular in a range from 1.2 to 1.7 cm. With<br>
wave height 92, in this context, is meant the average vertical distance of a wave<br>
peak 89 and a wave trough 90 to each other. A wave peak 89 lies here at a hori-<br>
zontal separation from its adjacent wave trough 90 (corresponds to the wave<br>
length 91) of about 3.0 cm to 10 cm, in particular the wave length 91 lies in a<br>
range from 4.0 cm to 6.0 cm.<br>
A further improvement in respect of the reduction of the tendency to polymerise<br>
can be achieved by means of special forms of surfaces of column 1 which come<br>
into contact with the polymerisable material. This is particularly the case for at<br>
least a part of the separating floor 23, of the flow distributor 20, of the inlet 4, of<br>
the flow rectifier 64 or of the container 2.<br>
According to a variant, at least one of the above-mentioned surfaces or its coating<br>
respectively is at least partially provided with a particularly low average rough-<br>
ness value (Ra). The average roughness value is the arithmetic average (over a<br>
reference path 95) of the absolute amounts of the distances 96 of the actual profile<br>
94 from the central position 93. Here, the average roughness value preferably lies<br>
in a range less than 2.0 urn (micrometer), in particular in a range from 0.5 urn to<br>
1.0 urn. With such an average roughness value, the tendency of the fluid to adhere<br>
relative to the surface wetted by it is reduced, so that this fluid runs away or drops<br>
away more quickly. In fig. 9, such an average roughness value is depicted as an<br>
example and illustration with reference to the surface of the floor plate 29.<br><br>
In addition, the possibility also exitss (alternatively or cumulatively) to provide at<br>
least one of the above-mentioned areas at least partially with a so-called self-<br>
cleaning surface and/or coating. Preferably, this self-cleaning surface has an arti-<br>
ficial, at least partially hydrophobic surface structure of raised parts and recesses,<br>
whereby the raised parts and recesses are formed by particles fixed on the surface<br>
by means of a carrier. This is advantageously distinguished in that the particles<br>
comprise a jagged structure with raised parts and/or recesses in the nanometer<br>
range (nanostructure 97 is shown schematically in fig. 9). Preferably, the raised<br>
parts comprise on average a height of 20 to 500 nm (nanometer), particularly<br>
preferably from 50 to 200 nm. The separation of the raised parts or recesses re-<br>
spectively on the particles preferably amounts to less than 500 nm, most particu-<br>
larly preferably less than 200 nm. The jagged structure with raised parts and/or<br>
recesses in the nanometer range can be formed, e.g. by means of hollow spaces,<br>
pores, scores, peaks and/or spikes. The particles themselves have an average size<br>
of less than 50 µm (micrometer), preferably of less than 30 µm and most particu-<br>
larly preferably of less than 20 µm. Preferably, the particles comprise a BET-<br>
surface area from 50 to 600 m2/g (square meter per gram). Most particularly pref-<br>
erably, the particles comprise a BET-surface area from 50 to 200 m2/g. The so-<br>
called "BET-surface area" refers to the determination of this specific surface area<br>
by the well known process of BRUNAUER, EMMET and TELLER.<br>
As structure-forming particles, diverse compounds from many branches of chem-<br>
istry can be used. Inorganic particles are preferred here. Preferably, the particles<br>
comprise at least one material selected from silicates, doped silicates, minerals,<br>
metal oxides, silicic acids, polymers and metal powders coated with silicic acid.<br>
Most particularly preferably, the particles comprise pyrogenic silicic acid or pre-<br>
cipitation silicic acids, in particular aerosils, A12O3, SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2, zinc powder<br>
jacketed with aerosol R974, preferably with the particle size of 1 nm (micrometer)<br>
or powdery polymers, such as, for example, cryogenic, milled or spray-dried<br><br>
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or per-fluorinated copolymers or respectively co-<br>
polymers with tetrafluoroethylene. Particles of these types and coatings for gen-<br>
eration of self-cleaning surfaces can be obtained, for example, from DEGUSSA<br>
AG.<br>
Measurement methods<br>
The isotropic density ("direction-independent" density distribution) of the mate-<br>
rial gas phase and the deviation respectively are determined, for example, with a<br>
process of the company Ingenieurburo Bulander &amp; Esper GmbH in Zwingenberg,<br>
Germany. By means of a radioactive source, a directed beam (with a pre-<br>
determined width, e.g. 5 cm) is sent towards a detector. Source and detector are<br>
located on opposite sides of the column so that the beam extends substantially<br>
horizontally through the column. As source are used, for example, cobalt (Co 60)<br>
and caesium (Cs 137) with an activity of 0.3 to 3.7 GBq.<br>
The beam emitted during the operation of the column is measured advantageously<br>
with a scintillation detector in the form of impulses per unit time and forwarded to<br>
an analysis or display device. In principal, a plurality of detectors and/or sources<br>
can also be provided, which are optionally arranged distributed around the cir-<br>
cumference of the column. This latter arrangement has the advantage that for<br>
comparison measurements in different directions the same experimental construc-<br>
tion can be retained and simply other sources and/or detectors come into use, so<br>
that measurement imprecisions as a result of incorrect mounting can be avoided.<br>
Concerning the construction of the experimental arrangement, reference is further<br>
made to the details concerning fig. 8.<br><br>
While a radioactive beam of this type is emitted for a pre-determined time period<br>
through the material gas phase, a counter of the detector recognizes the impinging<br>
radiation and counts the impulses. The number of impulses per unit time is a<br>
measure of the density of the material located between source and detector. A<br>
high value characterises a low density, since a large proportion of the emitted ra-<br>
diation has reached the detector. Accordingly, a low value of the counted impulses<br>
is characteristic for a higher density.<br>
A uniform flow of the material gas phase can be recognized, for example, in that<br>
in a cross section the fluid and gaseous components are uniformly distributed. By<br>
this it can be recognized that the separating floors are locally blocked (so that,<br>
there, only a small proportion of fluid is present in the material gas phase and thus<br>
a lower density) or, for example, regions with reduced gas flows are present<br>
(where, because of the reduced counter-pressure, an increased fluid flow and thus<br>
an increased density can be observed).<br>
To determine the isotropy, it is now proposed, first to undertake a measurement in<br>
a first direction in a level below the first operating floor and to acquire the de-<br>
tected radiation over a given time period (t; e.g. 5 min) (n). In order to reduce the<br>
influence of operational variations of the column, this measurement can also be<br>
carried out plural times, whereby a value (ni) is recorded over the time period (t).<br>
An average value (N) is then formed and used as reference for the isotropy. It<br>
should here be further mentioned that the radioactive beam is emitted with a cer-<br>
tain width (e.g. 5 cm) and the detector optionally has a resolution which enables a<br>
differentiation of the measured values over this width. Then, in turn, the average<br>
value or the area under the graphs (the integral) can be taken as reference, which<br>
represents the impulse rates over the width.<br><br>
After a characteristic value or characteristic integral for the detected radiation has<br>
been recorded, the above-described procedure is repeated on the same level but in<br>
a direction deviating therefrom. The two directions enclose an angle which is<br>
preferably greater than 30° and particular even greater than 40°. In this way, at<br>
least two such measurements from different directions should be carried out, in<br>
particular even at least three.<br>
In principal, a direction along the diameter of the column should be selected, in<br>
order to ensure that the free radiation length through the material gas phase is<br>
equally long and that accordingly the values for the detected radiation can be<br>
compared with each other. This is then possible because the radiation has passed<br>
through the same volume of the material gas phase. It is, naturally, also possible,<br>
to select a radiation path deviating herefrom, it should simply be ensured that this<br>
has the same length for each measurement.<br>
The level can, in principal, be arranged in any way in the column and is preferably<br>
substantially parallel to at least one separating floor. In order to check the uni-<br>
formity of the flow, such directional radiations through a separating floor, the dis-<br>
tillate or through the material gas phase can be undertaken. In order to character-<br>
ise the flowing towards behaviour of the first separating floor, the level should<br>
preferably be selected in a region less than 200 mm below the first separating<br>
floor. In particular, the level lies in a region from 100 mm to 10 mm below the<br>
first separating floor.<br>
An isotropy of the density is present in the meaning of the invention, in particular,<br>
then, if the deviation of the recorded measured values (n and/or N) is at most<br>
15 %. For determination of the deviation, an arithmetic average (M) of the meas-<br>
ured value is determined. It is defined for a given number of direction measure-<br>
ments (X) as quotient from the sum of the measured values per direction (nx<br><br>
and/or Nx) and the number of measured values (X). With a maximum deviation<br>
of, for example, 5 %, it is meant that the highest measured value of the impulse<br>
rate and the lowest measured value lie in a range from 0.95 M to 1.05 M. With the<br>
deviation given here, the measurement deviation as the result of cosmic environ-<br>
mental radiation (around +/- 50 count impulses for generally 3 seconds measure-<br>
ment duration and a measurement band of about 50 mm) is preferably already<br>
taken into account.<br>
Fig. 10 shows, schematically and in perspective, a further embodiment of the inlet<br>
4 with a flow mixer 98 as a particular form of a flow influencer. The depicted inlet<br>
4 comprises a bend 99, in which the polymerisable material is deflected. If the<br>
polymerisable material would, without a flow influencer, flow freely through such<br>
an inlet 4, the bend 99 would cause a non-uniform speed distribution of the flow<br>
over the cross-section of the inlet 4. The reason for this is flow turbulence and<br>
backflows in the region of the bend 99. In order to prevent this, it is also possible<br>
to provide a flow mixer 98 upstream in the proximity (preferably directly before)<br>
bend 99. Such a flow mixer 98 divides the polymerisable material flowing to-<br>
wards it into more than one filament 100 and deflects these such that they follow<br>
substantially the same path through the bend 99. The polymerisable material is<br>
hereby preferably at least partially set in rotation. Thereby, a unified flow can be<br>
generated without pulsations and back-mixings, so that the cross-section of the<br>
inlet 4 is uniformly flowed across, also after bend 99, and the polymerisable mate-<br>
rial impinges, for example, on the flow distributor 20 uniformly distributed. It<br>
should further be mentioned that the provision of such a flow influencer and/or<br>
flow mixer 98 can occur at more than one bend 99 of inlet 4.<br>
Fig. 11 illustrates a partial section of a container 2 with a spray unit 101 in cross-<br>
section, whereby in fig. 12 a top view of the spray unit 101 shown in fig. 11 is<br>
shown. Container 2 has a separating floor 23, whose lower side 105 (in particular<br><br>
during operation of the column 1) is cleaned with a spray unit 101. Such a spray<br>
unit 101 is preferably provided at least for the lowest separating floor 23 of con-<br>
tainer 2, if this comprises a plurality of separating floors 23 arranged one above<br>
the other. Through this separating floor 23 flows a fluid of the polymerisable ma-<br>
terial with a certain composition, which is then collected, for example, in a col-<br>
lecting reservoir 24 of container 2. Advantageously, it is now proposed to make<br>
this fluid available, via a supply device 104 of the spray unit 101 and thus to clean<br>
the lower side 105 of separating floor 23. The use of this fluid has the advantages<br>
that no significant influence of the distillation in the lowest separating floor 23<br>
takes place. With this spray unit 101, components of the polymerisable material<br>
(optionally already partially polymerised) adhering to the lower side 105 of the<br>
separating floor 23 are effectively removed.<br>
The spray unit 101 itself can comprise a plurality of nozzles 102. These are de-<br>
signed such that a substantially uniform cleaning of the separating floor 23 over<br>
its entire cross-section can occur. In this case, the arrangement and/or the type of<br>
the nozzles can be accordingly selected. Fig. 12 shows schematically a possible<br>
embodiment of the spray unit 101 with uniformly distributed nozzle 102, which<br>
comprise a substantially uniform spray area 103. Such a design of the spray unit<br>
101 is technically and economically simple, but not absolutely necessary. The<br>
nozzles 102 are arranged here such that the spray regions 103 substantially do not<br>
overlap, this is, however, also not compulsory. As nozzles 102, both simple open-<br>
ings in the spray unit 101 as well as separate nozzle components (preferred) come<br>
into consideration.<br><br>
