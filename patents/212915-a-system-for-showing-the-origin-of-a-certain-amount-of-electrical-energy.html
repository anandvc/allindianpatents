SYSTEM FOR CERTIFIED USE OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY GENERATED BY A FIRST METHOD<br>
The present invention relates to the certifying of electrical energy generated by a first method.<br>
The concept of "green energy" has been employed in the Netherlands for several years now.."Green energy" relates to electrical energy which is generated by means of renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectric power, wind power, solar energy and so on. The electricity distribution companies offer their consumers the option of consuming "green energy". The electricity distribution company hereby undertakes to generate at least the amount of electrical energy consumed by the consumer in question by means of renewable energy sources or, when it purchases electrical energy, to ensure that at least the purchased quantity of electrical energy consumed by the relevant consumer is generated in renewable manner. In order to adjust the additional costs of the energy generated in renewable manner a higher amount per consumed energy unit is charged to consumers of "green energy" ,<br>
Such a system does function, but the interest in consuming "green energy" falls short of expectations.<br>
It is assumed that this is caused partly by the fact that there is little relationship between the consumption of "green energy" and the generation thereof. It will be apparent that it is not possible to connect the consumer of "green energy" directly to a generating unit for renewable forms of energy; transfer of electrical energy takes place over the distribution network for electrical energy, over which is also transported energy which is generated in conventional manner, i.e. by burning fossil fuels or by means of nuclear power.<br>
The problem thus remains of a not very direct link between the consumption of "green energy" and the<br><br>
It is therefore important that the measuring and interrupting device be adapted to transmit electrical energy only after human intervention. The attention of the user is herein drawn to the fact that his electrical energy generated by the first method is "running out" by the lights going out. By for instance pressing a button he can transfer to electrical energy generated by a different method.<br>
It is also possible for the measuring and interrupting device to be adapted to generate a signal when the energy generated by the first method and representing the certificate has the value 0 or has reached a low value. The user is then also provided with the opportunity to transfer to energy generated by a different method or to place a new certificate or to top up a certificate.<br>
The certificates can take diverse forms. In order to be readable for the measuring and interrupting device they can be formed by documents provided with a code. The measuring and interrupting device is then adapted for inputting of the code, wherein inputting of the code results in an increase of the quantity of electrical energy, which is registered by the measuring and interrupting device.<br>
It is of course also possible for the document to take the form of a card provided with a magnetic strip or a ** smart chip* , so that by swiping the magnetic strip of the card through a card reader arranged in the measuring and interrupting device the quantity of electrical energy represented by the document is transferred to the measuring and interrupting device.<br>
The document can also be formed by an imaginary document, for instance in the form of a code, which can be transferred in electronic manner, for instance via a telecommunications connection such as a telephone line or a coaxial connection, as is generally used for distributing television signals.<br><br>
It is also possible to use the telecommunications connection as a source of information for the conditions under which the electrical energy in question has been generated. The code is for instance used for this purpose. It is then possible via internet to obtain the relevant information, such as the location of the wind turbine, the type, the average wind power during generating, and so on,.<br>
Other communication possibilities are also available apart from this, for instance via internet.<br>
Other attractive preferred embodiments relate to the measuring and interrupting device.<br>
The present invention will be elucidated hereinbelow with reference to the annexed drawings, in which:<br>
figure 1 is a schematic view of a network situation in which the present invention is applied; and<br>
figure 2 is a schematic, perspective view of an embodiment of a measuring and interrupting device according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows an electricity distribution network 1 to which are connected inter alia a conventional power station 2 and a generator 3 driven by a wind turbine, both of which supply electricity for at least a part of the time. A large number of house service connections is further connected to electricity distribution network 1, only one of which, i.e. 4, is shown. The electricity distribution network 1 is of course coupled to other consumers, such as industrial users and offices, and electricity distribution network 1 is coupled to other electricity distribution networks.<br>
The house service connection comprises a feeder cable 5, junction box 6, a kWh-meter 7 and a group distribution box 8. A measuring and interrupting device 9 according to the present invention is placed between kWh-meter 7 and group distribution box 8. With the exception of the measuring and interrupting device, this whole configuration is conventional,<br><br>
In order to ensure that the user of house service connection 4 consumes only electrical energy generated by wind turbine 3, use is made of the measuring and interrupting device*<br>
Measuring and interrupting device 9 is adapted to read certificates made during generation of electrical energy by wind turbine generator 3,<br>
Wind turbine generator 3 is connected for this purpose to a computer 10 which produces certificates in electronic form representing a certain quantity of electrical energy generated by the wind turbine. In the present case these are certificates in electronic form, i•e. in the form of codes.<br>
The codes are supplied to a network 11 which is formed for instance by the telephone network or other telecommunications network, such as internet. Documents are supplied to measuring and interrupting device 9 by means of telecommunications network 11.<br>
It is not necessary for this purpose for the measuring and interrupting device 9 to be continuously connected to the telecommunications network; an intermittent connection is sufficient. It is hereby possible for instance to establish a connection only during topping-up of the amount of electrical energy available in the measuring and interrupting device. The user can then order a certificate, for instance via a PC or via a telephone, and have this fed to his measuring and interrupting device. The associated payment, generally represented by the higher cost of "green energy", can herein also be made per kWh.<br>
In the situation drawn here it is assumed that there are a number of certificates present in computer 10, During production of electrical energy by wind turbine 3 a number of certificates is topped up accordingly. All of this must of course take place under the supervision of a generally respected approvals institution, for instance the KEMA (Dutch quality-control institute for electrical materials and appliances).<br><br>
It is however also conceivable that certificates can be obtained only for the electrical energy being generated at that moment by the wind turbine generator.<br>
Although the above system is described on the basis of an electricity distribution network, it is of course possible to also apply such a system in other distribution networks, the media of which originate from different sources and cannot be recognized on the user side, such as in the distribution of gas or drinking water.<br>
Figure 2 shows an embodiment of a measuring and interrupting device in a different embodiment,<br>
The embodiment shown in figure 2 is suitable for connecting between a wall socket and an electricity user connected via a cord. For this purpose the measuring and interrupting device 12 is provided with a sticker part, not shown in the drawing, and a wall socket 13 integrated into the measuring and interrupting device. Arranged on the top side of the housing of measuring and interrupting device 12 is a groove 14 inside which is situated a magnetic card reader, A display 15 is further arranged on top of the housing, and an RS232-connection 16 is arranged on the side of the housing. The magnetic card reader can be used to transfer a document in the form of a code into the memory of the measuring and interrupting device.<br>
Display 15 is used to indicate the remaining amount of electrical energy of the first type to be used. As an alternative to magnet card reader 14 as shown in figure 2, use can be made of a computer connection 16* Use can also be made of a keyboard*<br><br><br><br>
