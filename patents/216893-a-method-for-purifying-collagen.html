				<td>PREPARATION OF COLLAGEN<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to methods for preparing collagen from tissues of humans<br>
and other animals. In particular, the present invention provides methods for the preparation<br>
of collagen suitable for biomedical, veterinary, and other applications.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Collagen is the most abundant protein in mammals. (See, U.S. Patent No. 5,043,426<br>
to Goldstein, herein incorporated by reference). Indeed, it represents 30% of the dry weight<br>
of the human body. (See, L.C. Junqueira and J. Carneiro, Basic Histology, 4th ed., Lange<br>
Medical Publications, Los Altos, CA, [1983], pp. 89-119). Vertebrate collagen is actually a<br>
family of proteins produced by several cell types. Within this protein family, the collagen<br>
types are distinguishable by their chemical compositions, different morphological and<br>
pathological features, distributions within tissues, and their functions. Although many types<br>
of collagen have been described, five major types have been recognized.<br>
A. Forms Of Collagen<br>
Collagen type I is the most abundant form of collagen, with widespread distribution<br>
within the body. It is present in tissues in structures classically referred to as "collagen<br>
fibers" that form bones, dentin, tendons, fascias, sclera, organ capsules, dermis, fibrous<br>
cartilage, etc. The primary function of type I collagen is to resist tension. Microscopically,<br>
type I collagen appears as closely packed, thick, non-argyrophilic, strongly birefringent red or<br>
yellow fibers. Its ultrastructure is characterized as being densely packed, thick fibrils with<br>
marked variation in diameter. It is produced by fibroblasts, osteoblasts, odontoblasts, and<br>
chondroblasts.<br>
Collagen type II is primarily found in cartilage (e.g., hyaline and elastic cartilages).<br>
The primary function of type II collagen is to resist intermittent pressure. Microscopically, it<br>
appears as a loose, collagenous network, that is visible only with picrosirius stain and<br>
polarization microscopy. Ultrastructurally, it is characterized as appearing to have no fibers,<br>
but with very thin fibrils embedded in abundant ground substance. It is produced by<br>
chondroblasts.<br>
Collagen type III is commonly associated with type I collagen in tissues, and may be<br>
the collagenous component of reticular fibers. It is present in smooth muscles, endoneurium,<br>
arteries, uterus, liver, spleen, kidney, an lung tissue. The primary function of type III<br>
collagen is to maintain the structure of expansible organs. Microscopically, it appears as a<br>
loose network of thin, argyrophilic, and weakly birefringent greenish fibers. Ultrastructurally,<br>
it is characterized as being loosely packed thin fibrils with fairly uniform diameters. It is<br>
produced by smooth muscle fibroblasts, reticular cells, Schwann cells, and hepatocytes.<br>
Collagen type IV is found in the epithelial and endothelial basal lamina and basement<br>
membranes. The primary function of type IV collagen involves support and filtration.<br>
Microscopically, it appears as a thin, amorphous, weakly birefringent membrane.<br>
Ultrastructurally, it appears to have neither fibers nor fibrils.<br>
Collagen type V is found in fetal membranes, blood vessels, placental basement<br>
membrane, and in small amounts in other tissues. This type of collagen remains largely<br>
uncharacterized.<br>
B. Structure Of Collagen<br>
The principal amino acids found in collagen are glycine, proline and hydroxyproline.<br>
Hydrdroxylysine is also characteristic of collagen. These hydroxy amino acids are, the result of<br>
hydroxylation of proline and lysine present in nascent collagen polypeptides during collagen<br>
synthesis. The collagen content in a tissue can be determined by measurement of its<br>
hydroxyproline content.<br>
Collagen is comprised of polypeptide chains, designated as "a." There are two types<br>
of a chains, referred to as "alpha-1" ("a 1") and "alpha-2 ("a -2"). The most important types<br>
of a 1 chains are a 1(1), a 1(11), al(III), and al(IV), which aggregate in different<br>
combinations to produce the triple helices of types I, II, III, IV, and V. Type I collagen is<br>
composed of two al and one a2 chains. It"s formula is (al[I])2 a 2. The formula for type<br>
II collagen is (a[II])3, while the formula for type III collagen is (al[III])3, and type IV is<br>
(al[IV])3.<br>
"Tropocollagen" is the protein unit that polymerizes into aggregations of microfibrillar<br>
subunits packed together to form "collagen fibrils." Hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic<br>
interactions are critical in this aggregation and packing. Covalent crosslinks reinforce the<br>
structure of the collagen fibrils. Collagen fibrils are thin and elongated, of variable diameter,<br>
and have transverse striations with a characteristic periodicity of 64 nm. The transverse<br>
striations is produced by the overlapping organization of the subunit tropocollagen molecules.<br>
In type I and III collagen, these fibrils associate to produce collagen "fibers." In collagen<br>
type I, collagen "bundles" may be formed by association of the fibers. Collagen type II is<br>
observed as fibrils, but does not form fibers, while types IV and V do not form fibrils or<br>
fibers.<br>
Collagen fibers are the most abundant fiber found in connective tissue. Their<br>
inelasticity and molecular configuration provide collagen fibers with a tensile strength that is<br>
greater than steel. Thus, collagen provides a combination of flexibility and strength to the<br>
tissues in which it resides. In many parts of the body, collagen fibers are organized in<br>
parallel arrays to form collagen "bundles."<br>
When fresh, collagen fibers appear as colorless strands, although when a large number<br>
of fibers are present, they cause the tissues in which they reside to be white (e.g., tendons and<br>
aponeuroses). The organization of the elongated tropocollagen in the fibers cause them to be<br>
birefringent. Staining with certain acidic dyes (e.g., Sirius red) enhances this birefringency.<br>
As this increase in birefringency us only observed in oriented collagen structures, it is useful<br>
as a method to detect the presence of collagen in a tissue.<br>
C. Properties And Uses Of Collagen<br>
There are many properties of collagen that make it an attractive substance for various<br>
medical applications, such as implants, transplants, organ replacement, tissue equivalents,<br>
vitreous replacements, plastic and cosmetic surgery, surgical suture, surgical dressings for<br>
wounds, burns, etc. (See e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,106,949, 5,104,660, 5,081,106, 5,383,930,<br>
4,485,095, 4,485,097, 4,539,716, 4,546,500, 4,409,332, 4,604,346, 4,835,102, 4,837,379,<br>
3,800,792,3,491,3,113,3,113,568, 3,71,598,2,202,566,and 3,157,524, all of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference; J.F. Prudden, Arch. Surg. 89:1046-1059 [1964]; and E. E.<br>
Peacock et al. Ann. Surg., 161:238-247 [1965]). For example, by itself, collagen is a<br>
relatively weak immunogen, at least partially due to masking of potential antigenic<br>
determinants within the collagen structure. Also, it is resistant to proteolysis due to its helical<br>
structure. In addition, it is a natural substance for cell adhesion and the major tensile load-<br>
bearing component of the musculoskeletal system. Thus, extensive efforts have been devoted<br>
to the production of collagen fibers and membranes suitable for use in medical, as well as<br>
veterinary applications.<br>
Collagen has been used in the area of soft tissue augmentation, as a replacement for<br>
paraffin, petrolatum, vegetable oils, lanolin, bees wax, and silicone previously used. (See e.g.,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,002,071, herein incorporated by reference). However, problems have been<br>
associated with the use of collagen in implants. As the non-collagenous proteins present in<br>
impure collagen preparations are more potent immunogens than the collagen, and can<br>
stimulate the inflammatory response, it is critical that highly pure collagen be used. If the<br>
inflammatory cascade is stimulated, the resorption of collagen occurs by the infiltrating<br>
inflammatory cells (e.g., macrophages, and granulocytes) that contain collagenase, resulting in<br>
thee digestion of the collagen. In addition, collagen itself is chemotactic, and becomes<br>
increasingly chemotactic as it is degraded into smaller peptide fragments. Also, there are<br>
concerns associated with the use of non-human collagen. For example, a repeatedly<br>
documented problem associated with the use of bovine collagen as a biomaterial is the<br>
consistent, chronic cellular inflammatory reaction that is evident following its implantation or<br>
use. This inflammation may result in residual scar tissue formation, adhesion formation,<br>
interference with healing of skin edges, pseudointima formation, pseudodiaphragm formation,<br>
disruption of anastomoses, transient low grade fever, aneurysms, or other problems.<br>
D. Preparation Of Collagen<br>
Collagen preparations are typically prepared from skin, tendons (e.g., bovine Achilles,<br>
tail, and extensor tendons), hideor other animal parts, by procedures involving acid and/or<br>
enzyme extraction. Basically, collagen preparation methods involve purification of collagen<br>
by extraction with diluted organic acids, precipitation with salts, optional gelation and/or<br>
lyophilization, tangential filtration etc. After separating facia, fat and ,the impurities, the<br>
tissue is subjected to moderate digestion with proteolytic enzymes, such as,pepsin, then the<br>
collagen is precipitated at a neutral pH, redissolved and the residual impurities precipitated at<br>
an acid pH. The tissue is then digested with a strong alkali and then exposed to acid to<br>
facilitated swelling. The collagen fibers are then precipitated with salts or organic solvents,<br>
and dehydrating the collagen fibers. (See e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,028,695, herein incorporated<br>
by reference). Eventually the extracted collagen can be converted into a finely divided<br>
fibrous collagen by treating water-wet collagen with acetone to remove water, centrifuging to<br>
obtain the solid mass of collagen and deaggregating the collagen during drying. (See e.g.,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4148664, herein incorporated by reference). The collagen preparation can<br>
then be brought back to a neutral pH and dried in the form of fibers. Completely transparent,<br>
physiological and hemocompatible gels, collagen films, and solutions can be prepared. These<br>
forms of collagen may then be used in the fabrication of contact lenses and implants.<br>
One disadvantage of treatment with pepsin, is that the collagen preparation may be<br>
partially degraded (i.e., the extraction enzymes cleave the collagen molecule at the terminal<br>
non-helical regions, which contain the inter-collagenous cross-linkages). Indeed, it has been<br>
found that collagen extracted with pepsin results in preparations that are too weak for certain<br>
applications, especially those for which substantial mechanical handling of the collagen<br>
preparation is required.<br>
Some acid treatments also have disadvantages. For example, the acid process<br>
described by Chvapil (M. Chvapil et al, Intl. Rev. Connective Tiss. Res., 6:1-55 [1979])<br>
involves acid solubilization of bovine tendon collagen to produce a collagen suspension. This<br>
suspension is then either dialyzed or precipitated in saline, resulting in an amorphous<br>
precipitate containing non-fibrillary denatured collagen. Collagen prepared according to this<br>
method is generally not directly suitable for medical purposes, as it lacks tensile strength in<br>
moist media and has little resistance against enzymatic degradation when applied to living<br>
tissue. In addition, denatured collagen or collagen that has undergone treatment to reform the<br>
physical and biological characteristics to approximate collagen in vivo is often not satisfactory.<br>
It often lacks the mechanical properties required for wet dressings, as it lacks the in vivo<br>
organized structure (i.e.,collagen fibers are not present in this artificial collagen).<br>
Thus, current methods for collagen preparation are unsatisfactory. Clearly, there is a<br>
need for the development of improved methods for the high volume production of high<br>
quality collagen suitable for use in medical treatment.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to methods for preparing collagen from tissues of humans<br>
and other animals. In particular, the present invention provides methods for the preparation<br>
of collagen suitable for biomedical, veterinary, and other applications.<br>
The present invention was developed in order to address the problems presented by<br>
commonly used collagen preparations. The present invention is predicated in part on the<br>
discovery that collagen may be prepared in a manner in which all non-collagenous materials<br>
are removed, while retaining the native molecular quaternary structure and other characteristic<br>
features of collagen (e.g., length, diameter, and periodicity of collagen type I fibrils, as<br>
described above). The methods of the present invention facilitate the enzymatic removal of<br>
all extraneous materials while preserving the native collagen molecules in their original fiber<br>
configuration. The processes of the present invention may be used to prepare highly purified<br>
collagen from various animal sources (including humans), as most if not all, conjugated<br>
proteolipids and phospholipid contaminating the source collagen are removed through use of a<br>
specific mixture of organic solvents. In various embodiments, the prepared collagen of the<br>
present invention has better wound healing and hemostatic properties than collagen<br>
preparations previously developed.<br>
Unlike previously reported enzymatic methods in which papain is used (e.g., U.S.<br>
Patent No. 3,529,530 and 5,316,942, herein incorporated by reference) for collagen<br>
preparation, the methods of the present invention utilize a two-step enzyme treatment process.<br>
In one embodiment, the two-step treatment process ("Twice Treatment Process™" or<br>
"TTP™") of the present invention renders collagen polymers non-inflammatory through the<br>
processes in which papain or other proteolytic enzymes are used in conjunction with oxidative<br>
and reducing agents. The "twice-treatment" refers to the use of proteolytic enzyme in two<br>
steps: a first proteolytic treatment is conducted, followed by treatment with a reducing agent,<br>
which is then followed by a second proteolytic treatment. In particularly preferred<br>
embodiments, this process is followed by removal of proteolipids and phospholipids using a<br>
solution of chloroform and methanol. In additional embodiments, the collagen is bioactivated<br>
by varied degrees of controlled phosphorylation.<br>
The use of papain was contemplated as providing a safe means for treating collagen<br>
intended for human use, as it is traditionally used in the food industry and in association with<br>
wound cleansers. In comparison with pepsin, the enzyme most commonly used to prepare<br>
collagen for biomedical applications, better results in terms of reduced immunogenicity was<br>
obtained with papain. Papain, an enzyme extracted from papaya, is known to break the<br>
disulfide bonds of cysteine. As many immunogenic molecules contain cystine disulfide<br>
bonds, papain may be used to degrade these molecules and render them non-immunogenic.<br>
For example, papain is capable of digesting numerous naturally occurring proteins and<br>
peptides, as well as benzoyl amino acid esters (See e.g., Smith and Kimmel, Enzymes, The,<br>
vol. 4, 2d ed., Academic Press, NY, page 138 [I960]). In addition, papain has been reported<br>
to have a lytic effect of elastin, one of the contaminants that is difficult to remove from<br>
purified collagen (See e.g., Coulson, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 237:378 [1971]; and Smith et<br>

Initial experiments involving a one-step papain treatment to remove immunogenic sites<br>
from collagen were largely unsuccessful in altering the in vivo performance of purified<br>
collagen (See, Example 3, below). These observations led to the development of the methods<br>
of the present invention, which result in the breaking and loosening of the natural crosslinks<br>
of collagen fibers (e.g., aldol condensation). In this manner, the papain used in the second<br>
treatment (i.e., papain is used in two treatment steps) is provided access to most, if not all of<br>
the collagen molecules" surfaces, and facilitates the release of trapped immunogenic sites from<br>
the collagen preparation. These developments resulted in one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, in which papain is used at two specific stages of the process (i.e., before and after<br>
the treatment the collagen with a reducing and/or a unfolding agent). These methods<br>
therefore, provide means to produce highly purified collagen that is non-immunogenic.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a delipidation process is contemplated, in which solvents<br>
are used to remove proteolipids and phospholipids. Early attempts to remove these<br>
compounds from collagen using single organic solvent(s) such as ether, acetone, ethanol,<br>
isopropyl alcohol, etc. were not effective in removing all the proteolipids or conjugated lipids<br>
like proteolipids. {See, Example 4). Therefore, a unique technique was developed in which a<br>
3:1 v/v mixture of chloroform : methanol was used to remove all the proteolipids and<br>
phospholipids.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, purified collagen may be chemically-modified by<br>
covalently binding phosphates to hydroxyl groups of hydroxylated amino acids, as shown in<br>
Example 6. Although it is not necessary to understand the present invention, this reaction<br>
likely involves covalent bonding of phosphate to hydroxyl group of serine, tyrosine and/or<br>
threonine, hydroxylysine and hydroxyproline. The reaction is controlled, in order to limit the<br>
degree of reaction. At the completion of this step, any of the potentially remaining reactive<br>
groups present in the collagen may be fully converted to phosphoryl, hydroxyl, or sulfonyl<br>
groups by exposure to trimetaphosphate or other active agents. The end product with<br>
different degrees of chemical modification or without the same that is either soluble or<br>
insoluble in a physiological buffer and is suitable for numerous applications. In this manner,<br>
the purified product can be customized to particular uses. For example, bioactive responses<br>
may be favored by reacting the collagen with a linear or cyclic polyphosphates at alkaline pH.<br>
The final collagen product may be used in solution or as a solid, and has been shown<br>
to be useful for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to, biological implants, grafts,<br>
transplants, and drug delivery. It is, moreover, contemplated that it is useful as a surgical<br>
adjunct during transplant surgery and to prevent post-operative graft dislocation, as a<br>
hemostatic agent, to augment soft tissues, and as a support for in vitro cell growth {i.e., in cell<br>
cultures).<br>
When used as a hemostatic agent, the collagen prepared according to the methods of<br>
the present invention is particularly applicable to the control of bleeding from surfaces,<br>
especially large surfaces. For example, the collagen of the present invention may be used as a<br>
hemostatic agent on cut or severed bone, organs {e.g., spleen, liver or kidney which has been<br>
cut surgically or traumatically), the central nervous system with its predominant collection of<br>
small blood vessels, prosthetic surgery, oozing surfaces resulting from the surgical removal of<br>
necrotic tissue, cosmetic surgery, and any surfaces with oozing of blood from one or more<br>
small sources {e.g. facial cuts). This hemostatic collagen preparation may be applied in a<br>
variety of forms (e.g., as a powder applied directly to the surface; as a styptic in pencil form;<br>
as a gel, a sponge or in fabric form). The amount of hemostatic collagen preparation utilized<br>
will vary with the extent of the bleeding, the surface area to be treated, and severity of the<br>
blood flow; the only requirement being that the achievement of the desired control.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
Isolation And Purification Of Collagen With Papain<br>
In this Example, collagen was purified from dehaired bovine hide, using a one-step<br>
enzyme treatment process.<br>
First, 100 g of clean, dehaired bovine hide obtained from a local slaughterhouse was<br>
chopped or sliced into pieces of approximately 1 cm thickness and approximately 10 cm long.<br>
The cut slices were washed in three liters of a wash buffer containing double distilled water<br>
containing 30 g NaCl, 3 g ZnCl, 4.5 g methyl paraben, 0.9 g propyl paraben. In some<br>
experiments, the wash buffer contained 30.0 g NaCl, 3 g ZnCl, 4.5 g methyl paraben, and 1.5<br>
g trichlorophenate or 3 g hypochlorite. No differences were observed in the purified collagen<br>
preparations using these different wash buffers. Washing was conducted at 5-15°C for 6-8<br>
hours under constant agitation using a Rotator (Model #4140, American). The wash<br>
procedure was repeated twice, with the fluid being decanted from the solids after each wash.<br>
The repeated wash procedure removed most of the albumins and globulins that usually<br>
constitute approximately 1-5% of the dry weight of the sample.<br>
Prior to application of the enzyme treatment, de-epithelialization of the sample was<br>
conducted. In this process, 1 liter of cold de-epithelialization buffer containing cold deionized<br>
water containing 24 g NaOH and 56 g calcium oxide was added to the previously washed<br>
sample, and centrifuged at 5,000 xg for 15 minutes to obtain solid chunks of material. The<br>
sample was agitated on a rotator at 80-100 rpm, for 48 hours at 15°C. The de-<br>
epithelialization solution was replaced every 16 hours. At the end of 48 hours, the chunks<br>
were soaked in 3 liters of deionized water for 2 hours, with agitation at 80-100 rpm, and the<br>
solids were recovered by centrifugation at 5,000 xg for 15 min. One hundred grams of boric<br>
acid solubilized in 3 liters of deionized water pre-chilled to 4°C, was added and the sample<br>
was agitated for 16 hours at 4°C. The pH was measured and adjusted to approximately 8.3.<br>
The sample was washed twice with 3 liters of deionized water for 2 hours each wash, and the<br>
solids were recovered by centrifugation as described above. Although this method was used<br>
in this Example, various methods for achieving de-epithelization of samples are available, and<br>
known to those in the art. It is contemplated that any of these standard methods available to<br>
those in the are will be successful in achieving the desired de-epithelization.<br>
After washing, the sample was treated with papain in a one-step enzymatic treatment.<br>
In this process, the sample was further washed in 3 liters of pyrogen-free deionized water for<br>
2 hours at room temperature. The sample was centrifuged for 15 minutes at 5,000 xg, and<br>
decanted. One liter of normal saline solution was then added to the sample. Papain (Sigma<br>
or Papain Products) was added at the rate of 1-2 mg per ml of the total volume (i.e., 1 liter),<br>
with continual stirring. Following addition of the papain, the solution was incubated under<br>
agitation using a rotator at 80-100 rpm, at 37°C for approximately 16 hours.<br>
Following this first enzyme treatment, the excess water was drained and the solids<br>
were washed three times with 2 liters of deionized water. One liter of 0.2 M sodium<br>
borohydride was then added to the washed solids. The solids were incubated for 3 hours<br>
under agitation with a rotator at 80-100 rpm. The excess water was drained, and the solids<br>
were washed three times with 2 liters of deionized water.<br>
Robust Treatment<br>
In addition to the normal enzyme treatment followed by reducing treatment, as<br>
described above, a "Robust Treatment" was also tested. In this treatment, a multifold increase<br>
in time of incubation and enzyme concentration were used, as compared to the "normal"<br>
treatment. Although the rest of the steps were the same as described for the normal treatment<br>
(i.e., the collagen used in the "Robust Treatment" was prepared using the same bovine hide,<br>
cutting and washing steps), in the Robust Treatment, 4 mg of papain was added per ml of<br>
solution and 24 hours of incubation were used in the enzymatic treatment step, rather than the<br>
1 mg of papain per ml of solution and 16 hours of incubation.<br>
The amount of remaining contaminants and collagen in this preparation was<br>
determined and compared with the results obtained using the methods described in Example 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Isolation And Purification Of Type I Collagen<br>
This Example describes the methods and aspects of the development of the "Twice-<br>
Treatment Process™" (TTP™) of one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In this Example, the "Twice-Treatment Process™" (TTP™) is described. In this<br>
Example, type I collagen was purified from dehaired bovine hide. First, 100 g of clean,<br>
dehaired bovine hide obtained from a local slaughterhouse was chopped or sliced into pieces<br>
of approximately 1 cm thickness and approximately 10 cm long. The cut slices were washed<br>
in three liters of a wash buffer containing double distilled water containing 30 g NaCl, 3 g<br>
ZnCl, 4.5 g methyl paraben, 0.9 g propyl paraben. In some experiments, the wash buffer<br>
contained 30.0 g NaCl, 3 g ZnCl, 4.5 g methyl paraben, and 1.5 g trichlorophenate or 3 g<br>
hypochlorite. No differences were observed in the purified collagen preparations using these<br>
different wash buffers. Washing was conducted at 5-15°C for 6-8 hours under constant<br>
agitation using a rotator (Model #4140, American) at 80-100 rpm. The wash procedure was<br>
repeated twice, with centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 15 minutes, and decanting of the<br>
supernatant each time. The repeated wash procedure removed most of the albumins and<br>
globulins that usually constitute approximately 1-5% of the dry weight of the sample.<br>
Prior to application of the enzyme treatment, de-epithelialization of the sample was<br>
conducted. In this process, 1 liter of cold de-epithelialization buffer containing cold deionized<br>
water containing 24 g NaOH and 56 g calcium oxide was added to the previously washed<br>
sample, and centrifuged at 5,000 xg for 15 minutes to obtain solid chunks of material. The<br>
sample was agitated on a rotator at 80-100 rpm, for 48 hours at 15°C. The deepithelialization<br>
solution was replaced every 16 hours. At the end of 48 hours, the chunks were soaked in 3<br>
liters of deionized water for 2 hours, with agitation at 80-100 rpm, and the solids were<br>
recovered by centrifugation at 5,000 xg for 15 min. One hundred grams of boric acid<br>
solubilized in 3 liters of deionized water pre-chilled to 4°C, was added and the sample was<br>
agitated for 16 hours at 4°C. The pH was measured and adjusted to approximately 8.3. The<br>
sample was washed twice with 3 liters of deionized water for 2 hours each wash, and the<br>
solids were recovered by centrifugation as described above. Although this method was used<br>
in this Example, various methods for achieving de-epithelization of samples are available, and<br>
known to those in the art. It is contemplated that any of these standard methods available to<br>
those in the are will be successful in achieving the desired de-epithelization.<br>
After washing, the sample was treated with the TTP™. In this process, the sample<br>
was further washed in 3 liters of pyrogen-free deionized water for 2 hours at room<br>
temperature, and the water was decanted. One liter of normal saline solution was then added<br>
to the sample. Papain was added at the rate of 1-2 mg per ml of the total volume (i.e., 1<br>
liter), with continual stirring. Following addition of the papain, the solution was incubated<br>
under agitation on a rotator at 80-100 rpm, at 37°C for approximately 16 hours.<br>
Following this first enzyme treatment, the excess water was drained and the solids<br>
were washed three times with 2 liters of deionized water. One liter of 0.2 M sodium<br>
borohydride was then added to the washed solids. The solids were incubated for 3 hours<br>
under agitation with a rotator at 80-100 rpm. The excess water was drained, and the solids<br>
were washed three times with 2 liters of deionized water. The second enzyme treatment was<br>
then conducted on the solids, using the same procedure described above for the first enzyme<br>
treatment. A strong reducing agent was found to be essential. Although it is not essential to<br>
understanding or using the present invention, it may be that this strong reducing agent<br>
stabilizes any reversibly reactive group that might remain following the first enzyme<br>
treatment. This step also reduced the amount of aldehyde potentially involved in aldol<br>
condensation reactions (i.e., reactions between two aldehyde groups) or Schiff-base reactions<br>
(i.e., reactions between an aldehyde group and an amino group (See e.g.,Nimni et<br>
al.,"Bioprosthesis derived from crosslinked and chemically modified collagenous tissues," in<br>
Collagen, vol. 3, M.E. Nimni et al, CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL [1988], p. 5). It may<br>
also reduce the interchain disulfide bonds in the helical region of the same molecule, present<br>
only in type III collagen {See e.g., D. Amiel et al, "Biochemistry of tendon and ligament," in<br>
Collagen, vol. 3, p. 229, supra).<br>
Following the second enzyme treatment, the excess water was drained, and the solids<br>
were washed three times with 2 liters of deionized water. Although it is not necessary to an<br>
understanding of the present invention, it may be that the first enzyme treatment liberates the<br>
collagen in the preparation to an extent that is susceptible for further attack by a reducing<br>
agent {e.g., sodium sulfide, thiothreitol, dithiothreitol, glutathione or sodium borohydride),<br>
with or without alkali compounds to swell the collagen. Following chemical treatment, a<br>
second treatment with papain was conducted, in order to thoroughly eliminate all of the<br>
residual non-collagenous contaminants {e.g., interstitial elastin).<br>
Collagen prepared according to the two-step enzymatic treatment, as well as collagen<br>
prepared with the one-step enzymatic treatment described in Example 1 was tested to<br>
determine the degree of removal of non-collagenous fibrous proteins (e.g., elastin) as<br>
described in Example 3.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Insoluble Non-Collagenous Protein (Elastin) Content<br>
In this Example, various samples of collagen preparations were tested for the amount<br>
of non-collagenous insoluble protein present, using the methods described by Soskel et al. {<br>
N.T. Soskel et al, Meth. Enzymol., 144:199 [1952]). The samples tested in this Example<br>
were treated as described below.<br>
Briefly, approximately 25 g of wet test sample were delipidated using 2:1<br>
chloroform:methanol (v/v). The samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and crushed into<br>
pieces. The pieces were then placed in 100% isopropyl alcohol to prevent bacterial growth.<br>
The pieces were then centrifuged at 5,000 xg for 15 min, the supernatants were decanted, and<br>
the pellets were air dried at 60°C. The dried samples were then brought to room temperature<br>
in a desiccator and the approximately 10 g of each sample were placed in 200 ml<br>
polypropylene tubes. One hundred ml of 0.1 N NaOH at 4°C, was added to each tube and<br>
the contents were mixed. The tubes were then placed into a boiling water bath for 45<br>
minutes. As elastin degradation begins to occur after 60 minutes, it was determined to be<br>
important to remove the tubes from the boiling water bath after 45 minutes. The samples<br>
were then washed with cold 0.1 N NaOH, and then washed with cold double distilled water.<br>
The samples were dried over P2O5 or lyophilized, in order to avoid the inclusion of moisture<br>
in the samples that would result in a higher weight measurement. The samples were kept in a<br>
desiccator until use. The samples were brought to a constant weight (i.e., the samples were<br>
repeatedly weighed until the weight no longer varied) for gravimetric quantification.<br>
In Table 1, the results are shown as percent dry weight from 10 g of dry starting<br>
sample. In this Table, results are shown from samples prepared using the "normal" and<br>
"robust" papain enzyme treatments (i.e., the robust treatment described in Example 1). In this<br>
Table, "Enzyme Only" refers to a sample that processed according to the method described in<br>
Example 1 (i.e., it was processed without any reducing agent--the first enzyme treatment was<br>
conducted and the treatment process was halted).<br>
In this experiment, samples prepared according to the TTP method described above<br>
were tested, as well as samples prepared according to the "Robust Treatment" described in<br>
Example 1. In addition, two other samples were tested using both the normal treatment and<br>
robust treatments. The "Enzyme—Reducing Agent" sample refers to a sample that was tested<br>
following one enzyme treatment and one reduction step (i.e., the first enzyme treatment of<br>
Example 2, followed by the reducing step of Example 2).<br>
The sample indicated as "Reducing Agent—&gt;Enzyme" refers to sample that was tested<br>
following one reduction step followed by one enzyme treatment. This "Reducing<br>
Agent-»Enzyme" sample was prepared from the same source of collagen, cut, and washed as<br>
described in Examples 1 and 2. The test sample was first reduced using the reduction method<br>
described in Example 2, but without the first enzyme treatment. Following this reduction<br>
step, the methods described for the first enzyme treatment were conducted on the reduced<br>
sample.<br>
The sample indicated as "TTP™-Treated" was a sample prepared according to the<br>
methods of Example 2. As no insoluble non-collagenous protein was detected using the<br>
normal methods of "TTP™-treatment, the robust version of this process was not conducted.<br>
The characteristics of this TTP™-treated sample are discussed in more detail in Example 5<br>
below.<br>
The untreated control contained 1.24 ±0.190 percent dry weight of non-collagenous<br>
insoluble protein, while the sample prepared by the TTP process, had no detectable dry<br>
weight non-collagenous insoluble protein. These results indicate that there was a significantly<br>
greater degree of removal of extraneous non-collagenous proteins in this experiment, as<br>
Delipidation Of TTP™-Treated Collagen<br>
In this Example, collagen treated with TTP™, as described in Example 2 was<br>
delipidated, in order to remove additional potentially immunogenic sites from the TTP™-<br>
treated collagen.<br>
Fractional Salt Precipitation<br>
First, the TTP™-treated type I collagen was separated by fractional NaCl salt<br>
precipitation as described by Hill and Harper (RJ. Hill and E. Harper, Anal. Biochem.,<br>
141:83-93 [1984]). Briefly, the enzyme-treated collagen was dissolved in 0.5 M NaCl in Tris<br>
(hydroxymethyl amino methane buffer), at pH 7.4. The NaCl concentration was then<br>
increased to 1.7 M. The solution was mixed and centrifuged at 10,000 xg for 1 hour at 0-<br>
4°C. The dewatered precipitate was mixed and solubilized in 0.5 M acetic acid, and the pH<br>
was adjusted to 7.0. Sodium chloride was added to a final concentration of 2.5 M, and the<br>
precipitate was collected by another centrifugation step as above.<br>
The precipitated collagen was then dialyzed against deionized water and lyophilized<br>
prior to delipidation for quantitative analysis of the lipid content in the collagen sample.<br>
In later experiments, it was found that this fractional salt precipitation was often not<br>
necessary, as it did not affect the purification level of the TTP™-treated type I collagen<br>
protocol. However, it is intended that this step may be conducted prior to delipidation.<br>
Delipidation<br>
The collagen preparation was then dilipidated using the method of Folch et al, (Folch<br>
et al, J. Biol. Chem., 226:497-509 [1957]), with modifications. This step involved solvent<br>
extraction of total lipids, including gangliosides and phospho-inosities. Briefly, the collagen<br>
preparation was stirred in a mixture of chloroform and methanol (2:1, v/v). The volume of<br>
the chloroform: methanol was 20 times that of the collagen sample {i.e., 20 parts of the<br>
chloroform:methanol mixture were added to 1 part of collagen sample). The sample was<br>
stirred well during this addition, and vigorously shaken for one hour at 40-4 5 °C.<br>
The homogenate was transferred to a vial, and 0.2 volumes of 0.88% KC1 were added.<br>
The two phases of the mixture were allowed to separate in a separating funnel. The lower<br>
phase containing major lipids was removed, and the upper phase, which contained the<br>
collagen was washed twice with a mixture of 3:48:47 (v/v) chloroform:methanol:water. The<br>
collagen preparation was then washed with a mixture of 5:80:15 (v/v) of the same<br>
components {i.e., chloroform:methanol:water), and dewatered using a pressure of 9,000 ±1000<br>
psi, using a hand press. This squeezed the water from the collagen preparation to produce a<br>
dewatered mass. However, it is contemplated that pressures ranging from approximately 8000<br>
psi to 30,000 psi are suitable for use in this step. Application of pressure at 8000 psi removes<br>
all of the extraneous water from outside of the molecules, while application of approximately<br>
30,000 psi removes even the intramolecular water. However, it is not intended that the<br>
present invention be limited to these specific pressures.<br>
The compressed cake was then dispersed, using a coffee grinder, and air dried in a<br>
ventilated drying oven at 40-45 °C. The purity of the delipidated sample was then tested for<br>
phospholipids, neutral lipids and glycolipids as described below.<br>
Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was used as described by Skipski et al, (Skipski et<br>
al, Biochem. J., 90:374-378 [1964]) to detect phospholipids in the samples. Briefly, 10 g of<br>
delipidated sample was tested using a silica gel TLC method. The TLC plate was prepared<br>
by first preparing a slurry of 45 g of silica gel H (Spectrum) in 65 ml deionized water. The<br>
slurry was poured onto a clean glass plate (20 cm x 20 cm), to a thickness of 0.5 mm, air<br>
dried and activated {i.e., cured) for 60 minutes, at 60°C, cooled to room temperature, and<br>
used immediately. A known quantity of extracted lipid (200 ul) was applied as a streak to<br>
the dried silica gel, approximately 2 cm from the bottom of the plate. The sample was<br>
allowed to air dry and then was run in an irrigating medium of chloroform:methanol:aqueous<br>
ammonia (28%), at a ratio of 65:25:5 (v/v) in a glass chamber. When the solvent front<br>
reached near the top of the plate, the plates were removed from the glass chamber and air<br>
dried. The plates were then developed with iodine vapor. Yellowish-brown spots appeared at<br>
locations where phospholipids were present. Quantification of the phospholipids present was<br>
conducted using the methods of Fiske and Subbarow, as described in Example 7, below. The<br>
results are shown in Table 2, below.<br>
The presence of neutral lipids and glycolipids in the TTP™-treated collagen was<br>
determined using a silicic acid column chromatographic method, as described by Rouser et al.<br>
(G. Rouser et al, Lipids 2:37-40 [1967]). Briefly, a column (10 mm x 20 mm) containing<br>
silicic acid (Spectrum) was prepared and 10 g of the delipidated collagen was applied in<br>
sequential portions of 2 grams each, to the column. Thus, the total 10 g sample was divided<br>
into five runs on the column; all of the eluted samples were pooled. The sample was eluted<br>
with 160 ml of chloroform:acetone (1:1, v/v), followed by a series of acetone and<br>
acetone:water solutions. The eluted neutral and glycolipids were collected from the column,<br>
air dried, and estimated gravimetrically. The results are shown in Table 2.<br>
For purposes of comparison, multiple samples of the lyophilized collagen samples<br>
prepared prior to the delipidation step described above, were subjected to lipid extraction<br>
using different organic solvents. Fifteen grams of dry sample were placed in multiple<br>
containers. Then, 100 ml of each of solvent was added to each container {i.e., one solvent<br>
was added to each sample). The solvents used in this experiment were ether, hexane,<br>
methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, benzene, chloroform, acetone, and chloroform:methanol<br>
(2:1). The containers were incubated at approximately 40°C, with agitation using an orbital<br>
rotator at 100 rpm, for 6 hours. The solvents were then separated from the collagen samples<br>
by centrifugation and evaporated. Ten grams of each delipidated and dried samples treated<br>
with the various solvents were used in the lipid estimations as described above. The results<br>
are shown in Table 2, below. In this table, the percentages are expressed as the percent of<br>
total dry sample weight of collagen.<br>
As indicated in Table 2, no detectable quantities of phospholipids, neutral lipids, nor<br>
glycolipids were detected in the chloroform:methanol extracted samples produced as described<br>
above. On the contrary, the same protein samples showed detectable quantities of<br>
phospholipids, neutral lipids and/or glycolipids, when the delipidation was done by traditional<br>
methods (e.g., using a single solvent system such as ether, hexane, methanol, ethanol,<br>
isopropyl alcohol, benzene, chloroform, or acetone). These phospholipids, neutral lipids<br>
and/or glycolipids are detectable in these samples even after prolonged extraction (e.g., several<br>
days) at room temperature or slightly higher temperatures (e.g., 50°C).<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Cysteine, Hydroxyproline And Hexosamine<br>
And Elastin (Insoluble Non-Collagenous<br>
Protein) Content Of TTP™-Treated Collagen<br>
In this Example, the cysteine, hydroxyproline, hexosamine, and elastin content of<br>
delipidated and TTP™-treated collagen was determined. The hydroxyproline content is<br>
recognized as a measure of the amount of collagen present in a sample.<br>
The delipidated and dehydrated type I collagen sample was reconstituted in 0.1 M<br>
acetic acid, to a concentration of 0.3% (w/v). The purity of the collagen was evaluated by<br>
HPLC to determine its amino acid content using a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer,<br>
according the manufacturer"s instructions. The cysteine content of the sample was<br>
determined, as was the cysteine content of a collagen preparation that was "less<br>
phosphorylated," as described in Example 6. These results indicated that the mole percentage<br>
of both the TTP™-treated collagen and "less phosphorylated collagen" was 0.09.<br>
In addition, the insoluble non-collagenous protein (i.e., elastin) content of TTP™-<br>
treated collagen was determined using the methods described in Example 3 for testing the<br>
insoluble non-collagenous protein content of collagen. As elastin was the only non-<br>
collagenous protein potentially remaining in the TTP™-treated type I collagen preparation, it<br>
was considered important to determine the elastin content of this preparation, in comparison<br>
with collagen treated using other methods (e.g., the phosphorylated collagen of Example 6).<br>
The results of these experiments are shown in Table 3, below. These results are expressed as<br>
a percentage (wt/wt) on a dry weight basis.<br>
The hydroxyproline and hexosamine contents of the delipidated and dehydrated type I<br>
collagen, as well as collagen prepared according to the methods described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,374,539, and two phosphorylated collagen samples ("more phosphorylated" and "less<br>
phosphorylated") described in Example 6, were tested in the following experiments.<br>
Determination Of Hydroxyproline Concentration<br>
The hydroxyproline content of the delipidated and dehydrated type I collagen, as well<br>
as collagen prepared according to the methods described in U.S. Patent No. 5,374,539, and<br>
two phosphorylated collagen samples ("more phosphorylated" and "less phosphorylated")<br>
described in Example 6, were estimated using the method described by Stegeman (H.<br>
Stegeman, J. Physiol. Chem., 311:41 [1958]). The 0.03 M chloramine T used in this<br>
Example was prepared by added 0.845 g chloramine T to 100 ml of a buffer comprised of 20<br>
ml water, 30 ml propanol, and 50 ml citrate-acetate buffer, pH 6. The citrate-acetate buffer<br>
(pH 6) was prepared by adding 50 g citric acid (1 H2O), 12 ml glacial acetic acid, 120 g<br>
sodium acetate (3 H2O), and 34 g NaOH to 500 ml water. The volume was adjusted to 1<br>
liter, and the pH was adjusted to 6. Perchloric acid (3 M) was prepared in 25.5 ml 70%<br>
HC1O4, and the volume adjusted to 100 ml in water. The hydroxyproline stock was<br>
comprised of 5 mg hydroxyproline per ml water. The hydroxyproline standards were prepared<br>
by adding 20 mg hydroxyproline per 100 ml water and 0.05 ml concentrated HC1.<br>
The hydroxyproline concentrations were determined as follows. One ml of each<br>
sample and 1 ml of standard solution containing 2-5 mg hydroxyproline were added to 1 ml<br>
chloramine solution in separate tubes, and mixed for 20 minutes at room temperature. One<br>
ml perchloric acid was then added to the tubes, and mixed at room temperature for 5 minutes.<br>
One ml of 5% p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in propanol was added to each tube, and mixed<br>
for 18 minutes in a 60°C water bath. The tubes were cooled to 20°C, and optical density was<br>
read at 550 nm. The results are shown in Table 3, below.<br>
Determination Of Hexosamine Concentration<br>
The total hexosamine concentration of the delipidated and dehydrated type I collagen,<br>
as well as collagen prepared according to the methods described in U.S. Patent No. 5,374,539,<br>
and two phosphorylated collagen samples ("more phosphorylated" and "less phosphorylated")<br>
described in Example 6, were also estimated, using the method described by Blumenkrantz et<br>
al. (N. Blumenkrantz and G. Absoe-Hansen, Clin. Biochem., 9:269 [1976]).<br>
The trisodium phosphate-potassium tetraborate solution used in this experiment was<br>
prepared by mixing 98 ml of 1 N tribasic sodium phosphate and 0.5 N potassium tetraborate.<br>
This trisodium phosphate-potassium tetraborate solution was then used as the solvent for the<br>
acetylacetone mixtures for determination of hexosamine in the samples. Acetylacetone I was<br>
prepared as a 3.5% (v/v) solution in sodium phosphate-potassium borate buffer.<br>
Acetylacetone II was prepared as a 3.5% (v/v) solution in 0.5 N potassium tetraborate. The<br>
Erlich"s reagent used in these Examples was prepared by adding 3.2 g p-<br>
dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in 30 ml 12 N HC1, diluted with 210 ml 2-propanol.<br>
Briefly, the delipidated sample was placed into a tube, 6 N HC1 was mixed into the<br>
sample, and the sample was allowed to hydrolyze for 30 minutes at 120°C (or 12-14 hours at<br>
100°C). The sample was then evaporated to dryness. Concurrently, standards of glucosamine<br>
and galactosamine (2.5 to 40 mg for each) were hydrolyzed and evaporated to dryness using<br>
the same methods. The samples and standards were resuspended in double distilled water.<br>
In the assay to determine the amount of total hexosamine, 0.8 ml of sample or<br>
standard was added to 0.6 ml 3.5% acetylacetone I in separate test tubes, and mixed. The<br>
tubes were heated at 100°C for 30 minutes, and cooled. Then, 2 ml Erlich"s reagent was<br>
added to each tube and mixed. The tubes were incubated for 5 minutes and the optical<br>
density at 535 nm was determined.<br>
In the assay to differentiate between glucosamine and galactosamine, 0.8 ml of sample<br>
or standard was added to 0.6 ml 3.5% acetylacetone II in separate test tubes, and mixed. The<br>
tubes were allowed to sit for 2 hours in crushed ice, followed by heating at 50°C for 15<br>
minutes. Then, 2 ml Erlich"s reagent were added to the tubes and mixed. The tubes were<br>
incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes and the optical density at 530 nm was<br>
determined. The results are shown in Table 3, below. The results are shown as a percentage<br>
(wt/wt) on a dry weight basis.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Chemical Modification Of Filter-Sterilized Collagen Type I<br>
In this Example, TTP™- treated collagen prepared according to the methods described<br>
in Example 5 were further treated to produce "CollagenPRO™." Thus, as it is used in the<br>
present invention, "CollagenPRO™" refers to purified collagen that has been phosphorylated.<br>
CollagenPRO™ was prepared from TTP™- treated collagen prepared according to the<br>
methods described in Example 5. First, TTP™- treated collagen was filter sterilized by<br>
passing the preparations through a 0.22 m filter attached to a 30 ml syringe. The filter-<br>
sterilized collagen suspensions were then stored until use at 4°C. These filter-sterilized<br>
collagen preparations were chemically modified in order to determine the optimum<br>
modifications for production of purified collagen suitable for biomedical applications. The<br>
entire procedure was conducted under sterile conditions, using pre-sterilized ingredients and<br>
pyrogen-free, sterile water.<br>
First, 100 ml of a 0.3% solution of collagen in 0.1 M acetic acid was treated with 5 N<br>
NaOH at 4°C, until the pH reached 11.5. Then, sodium trimetaphosphate was added to a<br>
final concentration of 0.03 M. The collagen was allowed to react in a sterile hood kept at<br>
room temperature for approximately 3 hours with agitation using an orbital rotator, at 160<br>
rpm. This modified collagen was washed by dialysis against deionized water at 4°C, until no<br>
residual ions leached out of the collagen sample. Portions of the modified collagen were<br>
dried by lyophilization (i.e., freeze-drying) using methods commonly known to those in the<br>
art. The lyophilized samples were stored in a desiccator for a minimum of five days prior to<br>
additional testing.<br>
For some experiments, it was of interest to include purified collagen with a varying<br>
degrees of phosphorylation. For samples with more phosphorylated collagen, referred to as<br>
"More Phosphorylated Collagen" in the accompanying Examples, approximately 40% of the<br>
modifiable sites available in the collagen were phosphorylated. For samples with lesser<br>
degree of phosphorylation; this preparation is referred to as "Less Phosphorylated Collagen" in<br>
the accompanying Examples. To achieve a purified collagen with less phosphorylation, 0.01<br>
M sodium trimetaphosphate was used in the phosphorylation step, rather than 0.03 M sodium<br>
trimetaphosphate. In addition, the incubation period was 1 hour, rather than the 3 hours used<br>
with 0.03 M sodium trimetaphosphate.<br>
It is contemplated that phosphorylation of biomolecules, such as growth factors (e.g.,<br>
EGF), interleukins (e.g., IL1), and other biologically active molecules is beneficial. For<br>
phosphorylation of EGF, 1 ml of 0.1% EGF adjusted to pH 11.5, is added to 0.2 ml sodium<br>
trimetaphosphate, at the same concentrations and conditions (e.g., agitation and temperature),<br>
as described above. The sample is then dialyzed to remove salts, and the phosphorylated EGF<br>
may be used as appropriate.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Testing For Covalently-Bound Phosphorous<br>
In this Example, washed collagen sample was tested for the presence of covalently<br>
bound phosphorous, using the procedure described by Fiske and Subbarow (C.H. Fiske and Y.<br>
Subbarow, J. Biol. Chem., 66:375-400 [1925]). Briefly, 1 mg of dry modified collagen<br>
prepared and lyophilized according to Example 6 was mixed with 1 ml of 72% perchloric<br>
acid, and then digested at 200°C, for 20 minutes. Deionized water was added to the digested<br>
sample to adjust the volume to 4 ml. Then, the following reagents were added in succession,<br>
and mixed well. First, 0.4 ml of 2.5% ammonium molybdate in 3 N sulfuric acid was added.<br>
To this mixture, 0.2 ml of the reducing agent, l-amino-2-naphthol sulfonic acid was added.<br>
The collagen mixture was then incubated for 10 minutes at 100°C, and observed for the<br>
development of color, as measured at 600 nm in a spectrophotometer (Beckman DU-2).<br>
Potassium dihydrogen monophosphate was used as a phosphorous standard. Unmodified<br>
collagen prepared according to Example 2 was used as a control.<br>
The phosphorous content was estimated by graphing the results obtained with the<br>
potassium dihydrogen monophosphate standards. In this experiment, no bound phosphorous<br>
was detected in the TTP™-treated samples. For samples with more phosphorylated collagen<br>
(i.e., where 40% of the modifiable sites available in the collagen were phosphorylated), 2.5%<br>
(wt/wt; dry weight basis) bound phosphorous was detected. For samples with less<br>
phosphorylation, 0.8% (wt/wt; dry weight basis) bound phosphorous was detected.<br>
These results indicated that there was a significant increase in the phosphorous content<br>
of the modified collagen as compared to the untreated control. No measurable amount of<br>
phosphorus was detected in the untreated collagen control sample. It was estimated that a<br>
considerable number of hydroxy amino acids (e.g., serine and tyrosine) were irreversibly<br>
phosphorylated to form phosphoester bonds. Although it is not necessary to understand the<br>
invention, Figure 2 shows a reaction that may occur during this phosphorylation.<br>
This modified collagen was shown to possess improved biological characteristics, as<br>
described in Examples 10-15. However, it is recognized that care must be taken in the<br>
purification of collagen, as impurities present in impure collagen preparations may engender<br>
unfavorable biological reactions due to the phosphorylation of contaminant proteins (e.g.,<br>
elastin).<br>
Importantly, the amount of modification can be controlled, ranging from none to a<br>
maximum of approximately 40% of the modifiable amino acids present in collagen. The pH<br>
conditions under which the reaction occurs may vary from 8 to 13, depending upon the<br>
amount of modification desired. In addition, the reaction temperature may range from 4-<br>
45 °C. It was observed in other experiments, that the samples tend to freeze at temperatures<br>
less than 4°C, while at temperatures above 45°C, the collagen may become denatured.<br>
The chemical used to react with the collagen may be selected from the group<br>
comprising, but not limited to, various polyphosphates (e.g., sodium hexametaphosphate,<br>
sodium ultraphosphate, and sodium tetrametaphosphate), phosphoric anhydride, and<br>
phosphoryl trichloride solubilized in organic non-polar solvents such as hexane, etc.<br>
It is also contemplated that other non-collagenous biological materials for various<br>
biological applications will be chemically modified in a like manner. It is also contemplated<br>
that other modifications useful for preparing collagen to be used in cell culture or in vivo<br>
applications, including, but not limited to fluorination, halogenation (e.g., chlorination),<br>
sulfonation, and/or hydroxylation may be performed on collagen prepared according to the<br>
methods of Example 2, as well as phosphorylated collagen prepared according to the above<br>
described methods. It is contemplated that these modifications be conducted in conjunction<br>
(i.e., multiple modification procedures may be conducted on the same preparation), as well as<br>
separately.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
Solubility Of Modified Collagen<br>
In this Example, the solubility of purified type I collagen, modified as described in<br>
Example 6 was determined, and compared with the solubility of native collagen..<br>
In this Example, 10 ml of 0.3% solutions of un-modified (i.e., native) collagen and<br>
modified collagen were prepared in 0.1 M acetic acid. The optical density of each solution<br>
was determined at 450 nm. A small quantity of 0.5 M NaOH was carefully added to each<br>
solution, in order to adjust the pH to neutrality (i.e., 7). The optical density was again<br>
measured at 450 nm. The following table shows the optical density values for these samples.<br>
The increase in optical density of the native collagen indicated that there was more insoluble<br>
protein in this sample, as compared to the modified collagen. Thus, the modified collagen<br>
was also found to have better solubility features under neutral conditions. While it is not<br>
necessary to understand the present invention, this observation may be the result of a shift in<br>
the isoelectric point of the collagen.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
Preparation Of CollagenPRO™ Film<br>
In this Example, films (i.e., membranes) of chemically-treated, filter-sterilized collagen<br>
(i.e., CollagenPRO™), prepared according to the methods described in Example 6 were<br>
prepared for use in in vivo and in vitro experiments. In some experiments, the collagen was<br>
prepared from bovine Achilles tendons, rather than bovine hide. Both collagen sources were<br>
found to be satisfactory for use in the following Examples.<br>
First, the suspension was poured into sterile 15 x 2 cm petri dishes to a depth of<br>
approximately 8 mm. The petri dishes were covered, and stored at a constant temperature of<br>
37°C for 48 hours, in order to promote uniform initial gelation. This often required 3-5 days<br>
for the films to visually appear to be dry. At the end of the 48 hour initial gelation phase, the<br>
petri dishes were uncovered, and drying was allowed to continue at room temperature in a<br>
chemical fume hood. At the end of drying, the collagen films were sterilized with ethylene<br>
oxide gas and used for animal implantation, transplantation, grafting, or other experiments.<br>
These films were also used in subsequent experiments.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
In Vivo Evaluation Of Chemically<br>
Modified Collagen In Skin Transplants<br>
In this Example, the suitability and biocompatibility for in vivo applications of the<br>
chemically-modified collagen type I produced as described in Example 6, unmodified collagen<br>
prepared as described in Example 2, were determined. Purified, washed collagen samples<br>
obtained as described in Example 9, were dried in the form of thin films of 0.3 mm thickness.<br>
In this Example, sixteen adult male Swiss albino mice were used to test the suitability<br>
and biocompatibility of these collagen preparations. First, a circular area of 1 cm in diameter<br>
of skin was surgically removed from the backs of the animals. These areas were then covered<br>
under aseptic conditions with test or control collagen film (i.e., grafted). The collagen used in<br>
this Example was sterilized by exposure to ethylene oxide. The animals were observed for<br>
gross indications of inflammation (i.e., redness, swelling, heat, etc.), for a three week period.<br>
No adverse responses were noticed for any of the animals. The animals were then sacrificed<br>
at the end of three weeks following the grafting of the collagen film.<br>
The entire skin flap, including the grafted collagen was removed from each of the<br>
animals from the surgical site, and fixed in 70% alcohol, dehydrated, and embedded in wax,<br>
using methods known in the art. Embedded samples were cut into sections 5 microns in<br>
thickness, and stained with Goldner"s one-step trichrome stain (OST), and hematoxylin and<br>
eosin (H &amp; E), using methods known in the art.<br>
The histological results showed no adverse response with either of the two<br>
experimental groups. Cellular infiltration and the rate of neo-epithelialization (i.e., epithelial<br>
cell infiltration towards the center of the graft) was not affected by any of the test graft<br>
materials. In contrast, the control sample showed noticeable numbers of foreign body giant<br>
cells attached to the collagen film. In addition, as shown in Figure 2, there was a slower rate<br>
of epithelialization observed in the controls.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
In Vivo Evaluation Of Chemically<br>
Modified Collagen In Implants<br>
In this Example, type I collagen obtained from tissue samples of bovine intestine<br>
(obtained from a local market) was purified and chemically modified using the methods of<br>
Example 6. These samples were then implanted into rabbits, in order to determine the<br>
suitability and biocompatibility of collagen prepared according to the methods of the present<br>
invention. In these experiments, control collagen prepared according to the methods described<br>
in Example 2 was also used.<br>
Adult, male New Zealand white rabbits of approximately 3.5 to 4 kg obtained from<br>
the Nitabell Rabittry were used in this Example. The animals were first sedated with an<br>
appropriate dosage of ketamine, and anesthetized with ketamine/xylaxine (PDL) as appropriate<br>
for minor surgery. The hair on the dorsal side of the animals was shaved and prepared for<br>
surgery with a betadine scrub and a 70% alcohol wipe. The animals were divided into three<br>
groups of two animals each. A small incision was made in the skin of each animal, in order<br>
to create subcutaneous pockets. Four implantations were made for each group of rabbits. Six<br>
of the rabbits (24 sites) were operated on bilaterally, with implants placed on both sides of the<br>
dorsal mid-line. Each implant comprised 50 mg of dried collagen sample were rolled into an<br>
approximately round ball and placed subcutaneously at each site.<br>
The animals were observed for three weeks for gross indications of inflammation (e.g.,<br>
redness, swelling, etc.). No adverse responses were observed for any of the animals. After 3<br>
weeks, the animals were sacrificed and the implants were surgically removed, fixed in 70%<br>
alcohol, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin, using methods commonly known in the art.<br>
Sections of 5 micron in thickness were cut, and stained with OST and H &amp; E, using methods<br>
commonly known in the art.<br>
The results showed more vascularization and fibroblastic ingrowth in both<br>
experimental groups. The control samples had relatively poor vascularization, as well as a<br>
prevalence of multi-nucleated giant cells, reflecting the lesser biocompatibility of these<br>
samples.<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
Alkaline Phosphatase Activity<br>
In this Example, the collagen implants tested as described in Example 9 were analyzed<br>
for their alkaline phosphatase activity. Alkaline phosphatase activity was of interest, as it has<br>
been hypothesized that this enzyme is involved in tissue formation and calcification. The<br>
assay used in this Example is based on the methods of Bradenberger and Hanson (H.<br>
Bradenberger and R. Hanson, Helv. Chim. Acta 36:900 [1953]; and Hofstee (B.H. Hofstee,<br>
Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 51:139 [1954]). In this colorimetric method, the effect of alkaline<br>
phosphatase on the hydrolysis of o-carboxy-phenyl phosphate is measured.<br>
Briefly, samples of approximately 10 mg from each of the harvested collagen implants<br>
from Example 10 were dispersed at a rate of 1 mg in 1 ml of Tris buffer (0.1 M Tris, pH 8.5)<br>
for five minutes. Care was taken to maintain the temperature of the dispersed samples at 0-<br>
5°C, in order to prevent enzymatic reactions from occurring prior to the assay procedure. A<br>
small amount of detergent (to a final concentration of 0.1 M sodium deoxycholate) was added<br>
to the dispersed samples, in order to facilitate the release of membrane-bound enzymes. The<br>
dispersed samples were then mixed in a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann), for 30 seconds,<br>
while they were chilled in an ice bath.<br>
For each sample, the solutions were incubated in a water bath at 25°C, for 20-30<br>
minutes in order to allow activation of the enzymes. A test solution comprised of 2 ml<br>
glycine (0.2 M, pH 8.8), 1 ml of 3.65 mM o-carboxy phenyl phosphate (OCCP), and 0.5 ml<br>
of 0.05 M MgCl2 was placed into a cuvette, and allowed to incubate for 3-4 minutes at 25°C.<br>
Collagen test samples (0.1 ml, prefiltered using a 0.22 micron filter attached to a 5 ml<br>
syringe) were added to the solutions in the cuvettes. The optical density of the cuvette<br>
contents was then determined at 300 nm, at room temperature.<br>
The activity is expressed in units per mg of tissue, as based on the number of<br>
micromoles of OCCP hydrolyzed per minute at 25 °C, at pH, under the conditions described<br>
above.<br>
The results showed significantly elevated amounts of alkaline phosphatase (34%<br>
increase; p

EXAMPLE 13<br>
Use Of CollagenPRO™ For Wound Healing<br>
In this Example, the suitability of type I collagen was extracted from bovine Achilles<br>
tendons (obtained from a local market), and made into uniformly thin dry films as described<br>
in Example 9. A control film was prepared using the standard pepsin enzyme treatment<br>
method described in U.S. Patent No. 5,374,539, herein incorporated by reference. In addition<br>
to the Collagen PRO™ described in Example 9, native type I bovine collagen prepared as<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,374,539, and bovine collagen cross-linked with glutaraldehyde<br>
(as described in this patent), were tested. All of these samples were tested without in the<br>
presence of 0.5 ml of reconstituted epidermal growth factor (EGF; Collaborative Research<br>
Inc.)(l mg/3 ml PBS), as well as without the addition of EGF.<br>
Epithelial cell cultures were chosen for this Example, as they provide a model system<br>
for investigating the events that govern the closure of superficial epithelial defects and for<br>
assaying the actions of exogenous agents on these events. These methods provide some<br>
advantages, as compared to in vivo models of wound closure. For example, it is much easier<br>
to manipulate the extracellular milieu in cell culture systems. Prior reports indicate that the in<br>
vitro epithelial response is similar to the response observed in vivo, and can be readily<br>
quantified (See e.g., S. Gunasekaran et al, Proc. Soc. Biomater., 20:311 [1994]; and S.<br>
Simmons et al, Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol., 88:13-23 [1987]). This experiment was designed<br>
to demonstrate the comparative suitability of various collagen substrata for wound closure. In<br>
particular, the interaction of the collagen substrata and EGF were investigated.<br>
Primary cell cultures were established from surgically removed corneas obtained from<br>
sacrificed New Zealand white rabbits (1.5-2.5 kg). The surgically isolated corneas were<br>
incubated in Dispase II (Boehringer Mannheim) at 37°C, in a humidified CO2 incubator.<br>
After 1 hour, the corneas were transferred to primary cell culture medium comprised of<br>
Dulbecco"s modified Eagle"s medium enriched with 5% fetal calf serum, 0.5% dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide (DMSO), 50 ng/ml gentamicin, 146 (mg/ml L-glutamine, 5 mg/ml insulin, and 10<br>
mg/ml EGF. The full thickness of the corneal epithelial sheets were gently peeled off the<br>
corneal samples and placed in trypsin, gently mixed, and centrifuged at 2,000 xg for 5<br>
minutes at 4°C. The supernatants were removed and the cells from six corneas were<br>
combined and resuspended in fresh primary culture medium and plated in six 35 mm culture<br>
dishes. The cultures were placed at 37°C, in a humidified CO2 incubator. The culture<br>
medium was changed three times per week.<br>
By day 7 of incubation, the primary cultures had grown to confluency and were<br>
trypsinized for 5-10 minutes. The cells were pipetted from the culture dishes and centrifuged<br>
at 2000 x g for 5 minutes. The supernatant were removed and the control culture medium<br>
composed of the Dulbecco"s modified Eagle"s medium described above, but exclusive of the<br>
EGF. The cells were pipetted to yield a suspension of single cells and counted using a<br>
hemacytometer. Twenty-four well multiplates were seeded at 3-4 x 104 cells/well in 1 ml<br>
medium per well. The subcultured cells were grown for 7 days, with the medium changed<br>
three times during this period.<br>
On day 7 of subculture, the cells contained in four wells were counted, in order to<br>
ensure that each well had at least 1.6 x 105 cells. The cell layers were injured ("wounded")<br>
using filter disks (7 mm diameter), as described by Jumblatt and Neufeld (See, M. Jumblatt<br>
and A. Neufeld, Invest. Ophthamol. Visual Sci., 15:4-14 [1986]). Briefly, the cell culture<br>
medium was removed from the wells and the filters were placed on top of the cell layer and<br>
pressed down with a plunger (7 mm diameter). A pre-chilled steel probe 6 mm in diameter<br>
was held for 5 second on the bottom of the wells, directly below each disk. Disks with<br>
adherent dead cells were then removed from each well. Prior to adding the control medium,<br>
the test materials (collagen prepared according to the methods described in Example 9<br>
(CollagenPro™), as well as native type I bovine collagen and cross-linked type I bovine<br>
collagen (prepared according to U.S. Patent No. 5,374,539), were added to each well. The<br>
multiplates containing the "wounded" cell layers and test collagens were re-incubated for 24<br>
hours, to allow the growth of cells into the wounded area. The wells were observed at<br>
intervals during this 24 hour growth period, to measure the area of cell layer wounded by the<br>
disk. These measurements were taken microscopically, at 0. 12, 18, and 24 hour time<br>
intervals.<br>
Closure of the injured area on the cell layer within the wells was stopped by fixation<br>
of the cell layers and collagen test samples, with 10% neutral buffered formalin, for at least<br>
10 minutes. The cells were then stained with Giemsa stock solution for at least 10 minutes,<br>
rinsed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and allowed to air dry. The stained wells contained<br>
in the microplate were observed microscopically and the wound areas were measured.<br>
Figure 3 is a bar chart that shows the in vitro wound closure results obtained in this<br>
Example. In this Figure, "SC" represents CollagenPro™, "NC" represents native collagen,<br>
"XC" indicates cross-linked type I bovine collagen, and "GF" indicates EGF. These results<br>
indicate that the collagen preparations do not perform in the same manner. The<br>
CollagenPro™ with and without EGF results showed a faster wound closure rate compared to<br>
the results obtained with the other collagen preparations. The in vivo experiments described<br>
in Examples 10 and 11, demonstrated that the delivery of growth factors was more effective<br>
when delivered through CollagenPro™, as compared to native type I collagen prepared<br>
according to the method of U.S. Patent No. 5,374,539. In addition, these results indicated<br>
that in general, cross-linking of collagen does not assist epithelization.<br>
EXAMPLE 14<br>
In Vitro Hemostatic Tests<br>
In this Example, collagen prepared as described in Example 6, was used in additional<br>
tests to determine its utility in in vivo as a hemostatic agent.<br>
Hemostasis (i.e., blood clotting) is a primary event during the steps involved in normal<br>
wound repair. Collagen is a natural hemostatic agent that is present in almost every tissue,<br>
and which also appears to have specific affinity for cells and growth factors essential for<br>
normal wound healing. (See e.g., Gunasekaran, in Encyclopedia of Biomaterials and<br>
Bioengineering, 2(37):2293-2310 [1995]). Although other materials may assist hemostasis, it<br>
is possible that, unlike collagen, they will not optimize the rate of wound healing. The object<br>
of this Example was to determine the hemostatic and wound healing abilities of various<br>
compounds and substances. In this Example, collagen fibers (Avitene, obtained from<br>
Medchem Products), sponges (Helistat, obtained from Collatek), and gelatin (Gelfoam,<br>
obtained from Arizona Health Sciences), and gelatin fragments prepared as described below<br>
were tested. Additional substances previously used as hemostatic agents, such as thrombin<br>
(e.g., Thrombinar and Thromostat), and cellulose (e.g., Surgicel and Oxycel, J &amp; J Medical)<br>
were not included in these experiments. Thrombin was not included as it may have<br>
immunological and local delivery problems.<br>
Native type I bovine collagen was prepared as described in Example 2. Avitene,<br>
Helistat, and Gelfoam were purchased from their respective suppliers. Gelatin fragments were<br>
prepared by limited, non-specific protease treatment of gelatin (Sigma). The gelatin<br>
fragments were then purified by size exclusion column chromatography on Sephadex G-50<br>
and G-100 gels in Multi-Spin columns (Axygen), as described by the manufacturer. Two<br>
groups of fragments were isolated and purified. One group was designated as "high molecular<br>
weight gelatin peptide." This group contained peptides of molecular weights in the range of<br>
50-100 kD. The other fragment group was designated "low molecular weight gelatin<br>
peptide." This group contained peptides with molecular weights in the range of 30-50 kD.<br>
The standard Lee-White clotting method was used in this Example, as described by<br>
Brown (B.A. Brown, Hematology: Principles and Practice, 3d ed., Lea &amp; Febiger,<br>
Philadelphia, [1980], pgs 125-126), commonly known to those in the hematology art.<br>
Multiple experiments were conducted using this method, in which the volume of blood tested<br>
was either 0.5 ml or 1 ml (and the other reagents maintained in the proper proportions). As<br>
no differences were observed between the tests run with these differing volumes, in most<br>
experiments, 0.5 ml blood was used. Briefly, 3 mg of each sample previously stored in a<br>
desiccator was carefully measured, and each was separately placed into 10 cm long clean<br>
polypropylene vials. Fresh blood (5 ml) obtained by venipuncture from healthy humans was<br>
collected, and the time of blood collection was noted. To each tube, 0.5 ml of blood was<br>
added and gently agitated every 30 seconds, until clots formed. The time of initial clot<br>
formation was noted.<br>
The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 4. As shown in this figure, the<br>
clotting time was the greatest for the low molecular weight gelatin peptide fragments ("LMW<br>
Gel. Pept."), and lowest for the CollagenPro™ (indicated as "native coll." in this Figure).<br>
The high molecular weight gelatin peptide fragments ("HMW Gel. Pept.") time was almost as<br>
high as the low molecular weight gelatin peptides. The collagen fibers obtained from Avitene<br>
("Avitene") had the second-most rapid clotting time, while the Helistat ("Helistat") and<br>
Gelfoam ("Gelfoam") preparations had the next most rapid times, respectively. As shown in<br>
Figure 4, the Gelfoam clotting time was only slightly faster than the high molecular weight<br>
gelatin peptide fragments.<br>
EXAMPLE 15<br>
Hemostasis In Vivo<br>
This Example, a continuation of the previous example, was conducted in order to<br>
assess the hemostatic capabilities of the collagen and other preparations used in Example 9 in<br>
vivo.<br>
In this Example, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Circular regions (2 cm)<br>
of full-thickness skin were surgically removed from the backs of anesthetized the animals, as<br>
described in Example 10. The exposed areas were aseptically covered with the collagen<br>
preparations {i.e., grafted) described in Example 13. After 3 weeks, the animals were<br>
sacrificed and the grafts were surgically removed, fixed in 70% alcohol, dehydrated and<br>
embedded in paraffin, using methods commonly known in the art. Sections of 5 micron in<br>
thickness were cut, and stained with OST and H &amp; E, using methods commonly known in the<br>
art.<br>
The relative extent of neo-epithelization and wound healing were observed and<br>
assessed histologically. There were no gross signs of inflammation apparent in or around the<br>
grafted areas on the animals" backs. The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 4.<br>
As indicated in this figure, the CollagenPRO™ film showed a significantly faster wound<br>
healing rate and blood clotting time, as compared to the rest of the samples, with Avitene<br>
showing the second fastest rates, and Helistat showing the third fastest rate. The percentage<br>
of wound healing and blood clotting time results are shown in Figure 4.<br>
As previously described, these differing substances provide varying results in<br>
biological systems. Although it is not necessary to understand the invention, the relatively<br>
poor performance of gelatin and gelatin peptides may indicate that the structure of collagen is<br>
important in the processes of hemostasis and wound healing.<br>
From the above, it is clear that the various embodiments of collagen prepared<br>
according to the methods of the present invention are suitable for various biomedical<br>
applications that require non-inflammatory collagen. It is contemplated that the non-<br>
inflammatory collagen of the present invention be used in multiple settings and for numerous<br>
applications, including but not limited to, non-inflammatory collagen sutures, collagen soft<br>
tissue replacements including wound and burn coverings, arterial vessel replacements,<br>
hemostatic agents, drug delivery matrices, vitreous replacement for ophthalmologic therapy,<br>
endodontic therapy, cell culture supports, etc. It is further contemplated that various<br>
embodiments of the present invention will find use in any form, including, but not limited to<br>
fibrous or membrane films, bags, sponges, suture threads, and aqueous suspensions, as well as<br>
composite materials. In addition, collagen prepared according to the present invention may be<br>
further modified as necessary for the desired application and to provide an improved bioactive<br>
response. It is also contemplated that the methods of the present invention will be applicable<br>
to the preparation of other biomolecules as well as collagen.<br>
