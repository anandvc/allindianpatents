3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a polyester resin composition, more particularly, a polyester resin composition having a high crystallization rate and excellent moldability.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Polyester resins such as polyethylene terephthalate, polymethylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate and polylactic acid are excellent in heat resistance, chemical resistance, mechanical properties, electrical properties and the like, as well as in the cost and performances, so that they are industrially widely used as fibers and films. Further, since they also have good gas barrier properties, sanitary performances and transparency, they are widely used also for beverage bottles, cosmetic and drug containers, detergent and shampoo containers and the like.<br>
However, in spite of the fact that polyester resins are crystalline resins, they generally show very low crystallization rate, so that their ranges of molding conditions are very narrow and enhancement of the processing cycle is difficult, and therefore their uses as molding materials are still limited. Further, since the heat distortion temperature of a molded product obtained by molding of a polyester resin is low, the temperature at which the product can be used is limited, which has been problematic.<br>
As the method to enhance the crystallization rate of a polyester resin, there is a generally-known method wherein a nucleating agent is added, and examples of such a nucleating agent include minerals, metal salts of organic acids, inorganic salts and metal oxides, and examples of compounds which are widely used as crystalline nucleating agents include metal salts such as sodium benzoate, p-tert-butyl aluminum benzoate, and metal salts of aromatic phosphates; and compounds such as dibenzylidene sorbitol.<br><br>
Further, there is a known method wherein an oligomer of the resin is blended for the purpose of enhancing the fluidity of the resin at the processing temperature. For example, in Patent Document 1, a method wherein a metal salt of an abietic acid compound is added in order to promote the crystallization rate of polyester is proposed. Further, in Patent Document 2, a method wherein 4-aminobenzenesulfonamide is added to an olefin resin is disclosed. Still further, in Patent Document 3, a method wherein a metal salt of a phosphoric acid ester and a metal salt of an aliphatic carboxylic acid are added to a crystalline polymer is proposed.<br>
Further, in Patent Document 4, a method wherein a transition metal salt of a carboxylic acid is used as a nucleating agent of a resin composition containing polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene naphthalate is proposed. Further, in Patent Document 5, a method wherein a polyester resin composition is obtained using an alkylene-bis fatty acid amide or a quinacridone compound as a nucleating agent is proposed. Still further, the present inventors proposed in Patent Document 6 a method to use a metal salt of a sulfonamide compound for a polyester resin.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
However, the improvement effects on the crystallization rates of polyester resins by the known additives described in Patent Documents 1 to 5 are still not satisfactory. Further, although a method wherein an oligomer of a resin such as ethylene glycol is added contributes to the crystallization rate of the resin to some extent, the mechanical strength or the like of the obtained molded product decreases in some cases, which has been problematic.<br>
Further, the method described in Patent Document 6 showed a good crystallization rate during isothermal crystallization in a high-temperature state (at about 215°C to 230°C) in cases where a crystalline nucleating agent was solely added, but, in injection molding wherein a polyester resin composition was cooled rapidly during metal molding, the crystallization rate of the polyester resin composition was not sufficient, so that further improvement has been demanded.<br>
Thus, the present invention aims to solve the problems in the conventional art, thereby providing a polyester resin composition which is excellent in the crystallization rate.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
The present inventors intensively studied to solve the above problems and discovered that, by blending a metal salt of a certain sulfonamide compound and a plasticizer to a polyester resin, the above purpose can be achieved, thereby completing the present invention.<br>

Further, in the polyester resin composition of the present invention, the plasticizer (c) is preferably a compound represented by the following General Formula (2):<br><br>
(wherein, in General Formula (2), Ar1 and Ar2 each independently represents a C6-C30 aryl group which optionally has a substituent; G1 represents a C2-C4 alkylene group which optionally has a branch; m represents an integer of 2 to 30; and the consecutive groups of (-G1-O-) optionally have different structures), or a compound represented by the following General Formula (3):<br><br>

Further, in the polyester resin composition of the present invention, M in the General Formula (1) is preferably a sodium atom, and the polyester resin (a) preferably contains at least one selected from the group consisting of polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate and polyethylene naphthalate.<br>
EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>

resin (a). In cases where the amount to be blended is less than 0.001 part by mass, the effect of addition is not sufficient, while in cases where the amount is more than 5 parts by mass, bleeding of the metal salt of the sulfonamide compound (b) may occur on the surface of the polyester resin composition.<br>
The average particle diameter of the metal salt of the sulfonamide compound (b) of the polyester resin composition of the present invention is preferably not more than 10 µm, especially preferably not more than 5 µm.

In the polyester resin composition of the present invention, the method for blending a metal salt of a sulfonamide compound (b) and a plasticizer (c) with the polyester resin (a) is not restricted, and these can be blended by a conventionally-known method. For example, powder or pellets of the polyester may be blended with (b) and (c) by dry blending, or a part of (b) and (c) is preblended followed by dry blending with the remaining components. The dry blending may be followed by blending with a mill roll, a Banbury mixer or a super mixer and kneading with a uniaxial extruder or a biaxial extruder. This kneading is usually carried out at a temperature of about 200 to 350°C. Further, it is also possible to employ a method wherein (b) and (c) are added during polymerization of the polyester; a method wherein a master batch containing (b) and (c) at high concentrations is prepared followed by adding the master batch to the polyester resin; or the like.<br>
Similarly to plastics in general, the polyester resin composition of the present invention is mainly used as a molding material for various molded products.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The present invention will be described in more detail by way of Production Examples and Examples, but the present invention is not restricted by the Production Examples and the Examples. Production Example means a method for producing the resin compositions of the present invention, and Example means evaluation of the obtained resin compositions.<br>
[Production Example 1]<br>
A polyester resin composition obtained by blending 0.3 part by mass of a crystalline nucleating agent and 5 parts by mass of a plasticizer shown in Table 2 below with 100 parts by mass of a polyethylene terephthalate resin (TR-8550; manufactured by TEIJIN CHEMICALS LTD.) was mixed, and this polyester resin composition was dried for 3 hours at 140°C under reduced pressure, followed by kneading the polyester resin composition using a biaxial extruder at a cylinder temperature of 260°C, to obtain a pellet. The obtained pellet was dried at 140°C for 3 hours and the evaluation shown below was carried out. In the table, "Compound No." corresponds to each of Nos. 1 to 21 described above.<br>
(1) Semi-crystallization Time<br>
A 5 mg piece of the pellet obtained by the above method was scraped off and placed in an aluminum pan for differential scanning calorimetry, followed by heating it for 1 minute with a heater which had been heated to 280°C. The resultant was allowed to cool to room temperature, and the pan was covered to prepare a sample. The sample was further heated for 30 seconds with a heater which had been heated to 280°C, and rapidly cooled by being soaked in a mixed solvent of dry ice/methanol for 3 seconds to prepare a sample, which was then used for determination of the semi-crystallization time (seconds) with a differential scanning calorimeter (Diamond; manufactured by PerkinElmer, Inc.).<br><br>
In the measurement, the rapidly-cooled sample was immediately heated at 100°C/min. to 110°Q and after the attainment of 110°C, the temperature was maintained for 30 minutes to determine the length of time required for the calorie of the endothermic enthalpy necessary for crystallization of the polyester resin composition to become a half, which length of time was defined as the semi-crystallization time (seconds). The results are shown in Table 2 below.<br>

Comparative Example 2	Compound No.3	-	119<br>
Comparative Example 3	Compound No.7	-	111<br>
Comparative Example 4	-	Compound No.19	64<br>
1) Control: crystalline nucleating agent unblended [Production Example 2]<br>
A polyester resin composition was obtained in the same manner as in Production Example 1 except that 0.3 part by mass of a crystalline nucleating agent and 3 parts by mass of a plasticizer shown in Table 3 below were blended and the cylinder temperature of the biaxial extruder was changed to 270°C, and the semi-crystallization time (seconds) of the resulting polyester resin composition was determined. The heater used for the evaluation had been heated to 290CC instead of 280°C. The results are shown in Table 3 below.<br><br>
