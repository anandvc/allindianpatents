				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The present self destructible fool proof disposable needle - syringe for medicinal application and usage invented device ensures single usage of the syringe for injecting medicine, and itself gets destroyed after the single usage, thus rendering it useless for re-usage. The needle assembly once fitted to the syringe can not be taken out without disfiguring or mutilating the needle or breaking the syringe. The piston rod on movement breaks the circular flaps or fins giving visual indicating about the usage of the piston assembly. Further on completion of the injection process, the piston gets punctured resulting in loss of its air and or hydraulic tightness so that fresh medicine can not be injected through the said piston assembly. In certain embodiments the syringe gets destroyed after injection process. Another salient feature of the invention is that by providing detachable caps at the rear end of the needle and also on the top of the syringe, the shelf life of the product is considerably enhanced as sterilization provided at factory end is not lost even when packaging deteriorates or looses its air tightness. The invented device enhances confidence in patients and doctors and in turn the society is saved from unwanted speared of dreadful diseases through unscrupulous re-usage(s)</td>

In figure-1A there is shown one of the embodiments of the needle assembly in accordance with the invention in which needle 1 is rigidly held concentrally in base member 2. Injection end 1A and rear end 1B of the needle 1 are sharpened and the said rear end 1B characteristically protrude out to a predetermined  length. A female taper 2A is provided to the base member 2. A disconnectable cap 3 is provided over needle 1 which is held with top surface 2B of the base member 2. In certain variant another cap 4 is provided over the rear end 1B of the needle 1. The caps 3 &amp; 4 on bending get disconnected from the base member 2. In figure-IB another variant of the needle assembly is shown in which male taper 2C is provided in lieu of female taper 2A. Another variant, shown through figure-1C, is having taper end with recess 2D near the said top surface 2B of the base member-2. Another variant, shown through figure-ID is having taper end with recess 2D and male taper 2C having blunt end of the needle 1C. While in variant shown through figure-IE, there is provided internal screw threads 2E instead of male taper 2C or female taper 2A to the base member 2. In certain variants, external screw threads are provided in lieu of internal screw threads.<br>
In figure-2A section view of an embodiment of a syringe 5 is shown with piston assembly in which a top member 6 is adequately rigidly connected to syringe 5 having a neddle member 7 provided with a male taper 8 and shaped groove 9. The male taper 8 and the female taper 2A of the needle assembly on adequately pressing provide air tight as well as hydraulically tight joint. The syringe 5 is provided with a smooth inside cylinder 10 in which piston 11 is smoothly slideable providing air tight and hydraulically tight feature. Piston 11 is either rigidly held or detachably held with piston rod 12 provided with piston handle 13. At an appropriate place on the piston rod 12 there is provided circular flap 14 which is fragile in nature and gets broken when pressed with syringe 5 having handle member 15 on moving the piston handle 12 towards needle 1. A shaped member 11A is provided at the top of the piston 11, having a shape adaptable to the shaped<br>
groove 9 of the said middle member 9. In another variant, instead of taper with recess 6A matching with the taper end with recess 2D provided to the needle assembly, the top member 6, there is provided a cylindrical groove which is matching with the base member 2. The said base member 2 of needle assembly is slideable or interference fit with the said top member 6 of the syringe 5. And on the fittment, the top surface 6C of the top member 6 flushes with the top surface 2B of the base member 2 of needle assembly. In certain variant, instead of flushing, either protrude out by small distance. In some variants a detachable cap 16 is provided on the syringe at the top member 6.<br>
In another embodiment of the syringe shown through figure-2B, there is provided a female taper 17 to the syringe. In such variant, the top member 6 is not provided. In some variants adaptable taper with recess, as shown in figure-2A is also provided. The piston handle 13 is shown with circular fin IX which  is fragile in nature and gets broken in the similar manner as that of the circlar flap 14. The female taper 17 and male taper 26, provided to the needle assembly, make air and hydraulic tight joint and the shaped taper end with recess gives locking effect with the taper end with recess 2D of the needle assembly. In another variant, taper male threads 19 are provided on the middle member 7 as shown in figure-2C which are matching and adaptable to female threads 2E provided to the base member 2 of the needle assembly. Such variant is shown with suitable taper with recess 20 which is adaptable to the taper with recess provided to the base member.<br>
In the above embodiments and the variants, the cylinder 10 is provided with volumetric marking at the outside and small circular grooves 21 &amp; 22 which give feel of the extreme positions of the piston 11.<br>
Detachable type of pistion 23 from the piston rod 12 has been shown in figure-3A. In an embodiment shown through figure 3B shape 24 is adaptable to the shaped groove 9 in the middle member 7. Characteristically protruded and sharpened rear  end of needle 1B pierces the said shape 24 on pressing the piston. In another embodiment, weaker section is provided<br>
at the centre of the piston and in certain variant this is provided by a suitable hollow shape as shown in figure-3B. Different style of shaped member 25 &amp; 26 are shown as example in figure-3C and 3F.  Another variant as shown in figure-3E shaped member 11A shown through figure -2A is provided. In another variant, a plug type insert 27 of softer material is provided which gets easily pierced by rear end 1B of the needle 1. Another variant with flat faced piston 28 with hollow end shape 29 of the piston rod is shown through figure-3D.<br>
Circular flap 30 shown through figure-4 is attached or insitu with the piston rod 12 at an appropriate place that during forward motion of the piston 11 the said circular flap 30 breake. The circular flap 30 is fragile in nature is of small thickness having serrations or grooves where the circular flap 30 breakes. Circular fins 18 attached to the piston handle is shown in figure-2B as another variant.<br>
Figure-5 shows assembled needle-syringe as one of the embodiments, in which top surface 6C of the top member 6 is shown flushed with top surface 2B of the base member 2 of the needle assembly, and firm locking of the needle assembly is provided by the matching and adaptable taper end with recess 2D in .the said top member and base member. The needle assembly cannot be withdrawn from the syringe without destroying needle 1 or top member 6. Rear end of the needle IB is shown protruding which pierces the piston 11  when pressed at extreme end position in the cylinder. In another embodiment, the shaped member 11A fits into the shaped groove 9 provided to the needle member 7, and on retraction of the piston 11, it gets destroyed resulting in  losing air tightness  between cylinder 10 and piston 11, which inturn renders the needle-syringe useless for reusage. In certain embodiments plurality of the feature of piston as shown through figure-3 are provided which effectively makes the piercing and destruction of the piston 11. In certain variants, the said shaped member 11A pushes the needle assembly resulting in detachment of top member 6 also from the syringe 5. This is one of the way  in which the invention when developed performs.<br>
In the prior art a number of features are provided in the disposable needle - syringe for medicinal purposes to make it fool proof. But they are either not fully fool proof or have different node of making them fool proof. In certain embodiments retaining spring is provided making the device costlier; in certain embodiments a cavity is provided in front of the piston which ruptures with compression; in certain embodiments locking is provided through concave grove in the syringe &amp; cylinder, while in other a hook is provided connected to the plunger (piston) which hooks the needle carrier; in some plunger body is broken to prevent retraction of the piston; in some embodiments piston is provided with a membrane &amp; a pointed member pierces the membrane; while is some, retraction is prevented by cavity in the syringe body; while in others - needle assembly is pulled back.<br>
Like in prior patent No. EPO 498376 related to Self destructive disposable syringe; piston is enclosed with a membrane which is pierced by a pointed element. In another prior art patent No. US 5556384; breakable circle and a retaining ring is provided and the piston is encased in the retaining ring. The intended destruction of seal of the piston is caused by cutting edge of the retaining ring. While in patent No. ES 2008949; a cavity is provided in front part of the piston &amp; with compression of the injectable fluid, elastic deformation of then cavity takes place resulting in rupture &amp; disabling of the syringe. None of the above inventive features exist in the present invention.<br>
The embodiments of the inventions of the prior art suffer from one or the other lacunae like; not fully fool proof or costlier or can be reused or the user can not find visually whether the device has already been used or not, or is not microbe free for a longer time.<br>
There are plurality of inventive features in the invention of self destructible fool proof needle - syringe assembly for medicinal usage:<br>
a)	The embodiments developed in accordance with the invention gets self destroyed after single usage. Rear end 1B or 1 C of the needle 1 pierces the piston 11 having shaped member 24, 25 or 28 or plug type inserts 27 or shaped member insert 26, resulting in destruction of the piston 11 as it looses its air &amp; hydraulic tightness.<br>
b)	Needle assembly once fitted with the syringe cannot be removed without destroying it as its top surface 2B flushes with top surface 6C of the top member of the syringe. If after the assembly, the needle assembly is pulled out, the needle shall gets destroyed.<br>
c)	Even from the look at the self destructible fool proof needle - syringe assembly,<br>
layman can find out that the device has been used earlier, as circular flap 14, 30 or<br>
circular fins 18, provided to the piston rod 12 get broken on single usage giving its<br>
clear visual indication.<br>
d)	The assembled unit of the syringe, needle assembly and piston remain microbe free<br>
for much longer time as the space in between piston 11 &amp; cylinder 10, and needle 11<br>
and detachable cap 3 remains air tight to prevent ingress of microbes. In another<br>
embodiment air tightness is separately provided to by detachable cap 16 to the<br>
syringe and detachable cap 3 and 4 to the needle assembly, when packed separately.<br>
Thus all the components of the self destructible fool proof needle - syringe assembly are not fit for second usage. This said fool proof needle-syringe gives the desired medical service and enhances confidence in the patient and the doctor, and in turn the society is saved from unwanted spread of dreadful diseases through unscrupulous re-use of the prior art needle-syringe.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
