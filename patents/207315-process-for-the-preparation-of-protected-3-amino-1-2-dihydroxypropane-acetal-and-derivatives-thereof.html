AND   DERIVATIVES   THEREOF<br>
CROSS-REFERENCS TO  RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/087,496, filed June   1,   1998,<br>
STATEMENT    REGARDING     FEDERALLY     SPONSORED	RESEARCH     OR<br>
DEVELOPMENT<br>
This invention was supported in part by a United States Department of Energy Grant No. DE-FG02-89ER14029, The U,S. government has certain rights in this   invention.<br>
BACKGROUND  OF  THE   INVENTION<br>
(1)    Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for<br>
the preparation of protected 3-amino-l, 2-dihydroxy-<br>
propane acetal, particularly in chiral forms, for use as<br>
an intermediate in the preparation of various 3-carbon<br>
compounds which are chiral. In particular, the present<br>
invention relates to the process for preparation of 3-<br>
amino-l, 2-dihydroxypropane isopropy lidene acetal. The<br>
invention is particularly useful for preparation of<br>
glyeidol, l-bromo-2 , 3-dihydroxy propane , or 3-amino-l, 2-<br>
dihydroxypropane	starting	from	3-hydroxy-y-<br>
butyrolactone.<br>
(2)      BACKGROUND   OF   THE   INVENTION<br>
Chiral 3-carbon synthons are very important compounds because they are used in a variety of pharmaceuticals and material science applications ranging from beta-blocker drugs, phospholipid and glycolipid    analogs,     thromboxane    synthase     inhibitors,<br><br>
sulfolipids and liquid crystal materials. However, chiral 3-carbon synthons are extremely expensive. Three key 3-carbon building blocks are (R)-glycidol (2), (R)-l-bromo-2,3-dihydroxypropane (i) and (S)-3-amino-l,2-dihydroxypropane (1).<br><br>
(R)-glycidol (2.) and its (S)-isomer are much used intermediates in the synthesis of chiral compounds. Because of this, much effort has been expended in developing routes to them- These include catalytic oxidations with peroxides and chiral transition metal complexes (Byun, H.-S, et al., J. Org. Chem. 59:668-671 (199 4)), enzymatic resolutions of racemic esters using lipases to selectively deacylate one member enantiomer (Bednarski, M.D., et al,, J. Am. Chem. See. 109:1283-1285 (1987); Fuganti, C,, et al., Tetrahedron 44:2575-2582 (1988); and Chen, J., et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 34:7 663-7666 (1993) ) , and treatment of a chiral 1,2-propane diol with a leaving group such as a halide or tosylate ester in the 3-position with base (Baldwin, J. J,, et al., J. Med. Chem. 25:931-936 (1982)). The availability of an easy route to 2. is therefore de facto a route to 2.. The aminodiol 1 is a substructure that appears in a large class of important drugs especially the 3-blockers such as Propanalol (5.) and Metoprolol (6) , the antiviral agent (2) and the thromboxane synthase inhibitor (8) .<br><br><br>
Thus, there is a need for a process to make chiral 3-carbon synthons which is inexpensive, safe, and easy to perform. In particular, it is desirable to have a process for making chiral 3-carbon synthons from renewable natural resources.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a protected 3-amino-l,2-dihydroxypropane acetal in a Hoffman rearrangement reaction mixture, which comprises reacting a 4-carbon protected 1,2-dihydroxybutryamide in a Hoffman rearrangement reaction mixture with a hypohalite in the presence of a base in a solvent for the reaction mixture to produce the 3-carbon protected 3-amino-l,2-dihydroxypropane acetal. The process uses 3-hydroxy-y-butyro lactone as the starting  material.     The  protected  3-aminG-l,2-<br><br>
dihydroxypropane is a useful intermediate for the synthesis of 3-carbon chiral compounds important for the manufacture  of  pharmaceuticals.<br>
In particular the present invention relates to a process wherein 3-hydroxy-y-butyrolactone is converted to an amide which is then converted to a protected butyramide using 2,2-dimethylpropane as the protecting group. The protected butyramide is then converted to 3-amino-l,2-dihydroxypropane isopropylidene acetal which is a precursor for the synthesis of other 3-carbon compounds such as glycidol, l-halo-2,3-dihydroxYpropane, and   3-amino-l,2-dihydroxYpropane.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a process for preparing 3-carbon compounds which are useful for the manufacture of a variety of pharmaceutical compounds. The process uses as the starting material, 3-hydroxy-y-butyrolactone (i) which is a renewable natural resource that is obtainable from starch, lactose, maltddextrins ' and other readily available carbohydrate  feedstock.<br>
OBJECTS<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process for the production of protected 3-amino-l,2-dihydroxypropane acetals, in particular 3-amino-l,2-dihydroxypropane isopropylidene acetal which is an intermediate to the desired 3-carbon synthons Z, 1 and A, preferably in chiral form from i. It is also an object of the present invention to provide a process which is simple and economical. These and other objects will become increasingly apparent by reference to the following description and the drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a protected 3-amino-l,2-dihydroxypropane acetal in a Hoffman rearrangement reaction mixture, having the formula:<br><br>
wherein R1 and R are protecting groups which can be combined which comprises reacting a protected 2,3-dihydroxybutryamide in a reaction mixture, having the formula:<br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are the same protecting groups with a hypohalite in the presence of a base in a solvent for the reaction mixture to produce the protected 3-amino-1,2-dihydroxypropane acetal.<br><br>
In the process, the protected 3,4-dihydroxybutyramide is produced from 3,4-dihydroxybutyramide in a reactive mixture which comprises an acid and a protecting group in a solvent for the reaction to produce the protected 3,4-dihydroxybutyramide. Furthermore, in the process the 3 ,4-dihydroxybutyramide is produced from 3-hydroxy-Y-butyrolactone in a reactive mixture comprising ammonia in a solvent for the reaction to produce the protected 3 , 4-dihydroxybutyramide, In the preferred process the 3-hydroxy-y-butyrolactone and protected 3-amino-l,2-dihydroxypropane acetal produced are chiral. The process can use protecting groups selected from the group consisting of alkyloxy, aryloxy, acyloxy, halo, sulfonyloxy, sulfate, phosphate, saccharide and combinations thereof. In particular, the protecting group is an acetal selected from the group consisting of alkylidene, arylidene, acylidene and coir±)inations thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the protecting group is a geminal dimethoxy-acetal.<br>
The present invention further relates to the production of 3-carbon intermediates useful manufacture of pharmaceutical compounds. In particular, the production of 3-amino-l,2-dihydroxypropane wherein the protected 3-amino-l,2-dihydroxypropane acetal produced is further reacted to an acid which produces the 1-amino-2,3-dihydroxypropane; the production of 1-halo-2,3-dihydroxypropane wherein the protected 3-amino-l,2-dihydroxypropane acetal produced is further reacted with a halide source and a nitrite in the presence of an acid to produce the 1-halo-2,3-dihydroxypropane; or the production of 2,3-epoxy wherein in addition the 1-halo-2, 3-dihydroxypropane is reacted with a base to form chiral 2,3-epoxy-l-hydroxypropane. In the preferred process the protected 3-amino-l,2-dihydroxypropane acetal is chiral and is converted as above to chiral 3-amino-l,2-dihydroxypropane   or   chiral   l*halo-2 , 3-<br><br>
dihydroxypropane are chiral. In the process for producing l-halo-2,3-dihydroxypropane the halo is selected from the group consisting of CI, Br, I and F,<br>
In a preferred process, the present invention relates to a process which comprises: (a) reacting 3-hydroxy-Y"butyrolactone with ammonia to produce 3,4-dihydroxybutyramide; (b) reacting the 3,4-dihydroxybutyramide with acetone and dimethyoxypropane in the presence of an acid to produce 3, 4* dihydroxybutyramide isopropylidene acetal; and (c) reacting the 1,2-dihydroxybutyramide isopropylidene acetal with an hypohalite in the presence of a base to produce 3-amino-l,2-dihydroxypropane isopropylidene acetal.<br>
The process uses chiral 3-hydroxy-Y"" butyrolactone as the starting material so that the product will be chiral- The use of (S)-3-hydroxy-Y-butyrolactone (1) as the starting material for synthesis of 5. is convenient over prior art methods "because 1 can be synthesized in high yield and in large quantities from renewable, natural resources. Inexpensive methods for synthesizing 1 have been described in: U.S. Patent No. 5,319,110 to R. Hollingsworth which discloses a process for synthesis of an internal cyclic ester such as a lactone by converting a hexose source, which contains hexose as a substituent and another sugar attached to the hexose substituent in the 4 position via (S)-3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid as an intermediate; U.S. Patent No. 5,374,773 to R. Hollingsworth which discloses a process for the synthesis (S) -3,4-dihydroxybutanoic salt by converting a hexose source which contains hexose as a substituent and another sugar attached to the hexose substituent in the 4 position via (S)-3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid as an intermediate; U.S. Patent No. 5,292,939 to R. Hollingsworth which discloses synthesis of (S)-3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid from substituted D-hexose; and U.S. Patent No. 5,808,107 to<br><br>
R. Hollingsworth which discloses another process for producing chiral lactones. These references are herein incorporated  by reference.<br>
The general pathway for the synthesis of protected 3-amino-l, 2'dihydroxypropane acetal is shown in  Scheme   1.<br><br>
In Scheme 1, Rl and R2 are protecting groups which are<br>
acetals, and X is a halide selected from the croup<br>
consisting of CI, F, Br, and I, In the process 3-<br>
hydroxy-y-lactone (i) is reacted in a reaction mixture<br>
with ammonia which produces the 1,2-dihydroxybutyramide<br>
(i) . To effect the transformation of the 4-carbon (S)-<br>
B-hydroxy-Y-butyrolactone (i) to the 3-carbon compounds,<br>
it first has to be converted to a protected<br>
dihydroxybutyramide     (10A) •	The    butyramide    is    then<br><br>
converted to a protected 3-carbon amine (llA) by treatment with hypohalite ion in the presence of hydroxide ion. The protected amine is then deprotected with an acid to give A or converted to a halo diol such as 2 by treatment with nitrous acid and halide ion. There are several established methods for converting 1 to the epoxyalcohol 2.<br>
The important step in obtaining H^ is a l-carbon chain descension step in which the 4-carbon protected dihydroxybutryamide (lOA) is stereospecifically and quantitatively converted to the pure 3-carbon primary amine (HA) via a Hoffman rearrangement reaction on the protected amide (lOA). In a Hoffman rearrangement reaction, primary amides react with OCl or OBr in the presence of a strong base to form amines with the loss of the car bony 1 carbon atom. However, such a reaction on a yhydroxyamide normally fails because of participation by the alcohol function to form a lactone. One important aspect of this invention is that participation of the alcohol functions can be avoided by tying up the interfering alcohol functions with blocking or protecting groups. The 3 and 4 hydroxyl groups of the dihydroxybutyramide (1) can be protected with any combination of protecting groups which includes but is not limited to the constituents of the group consisting of alkyloxy, aryloxy, acyloxy, halo, sulfonyloxy, sulfate, phosphate or saccharide. In particular, the groups may be any combination of alkylidene, arylidene or acylidene groups which includes such acetals such as propylidene, benzylidene, ethylidene and methylidene. In a preferred embodiment, the protecting group is a geminal dimethoxy-acetal such as 2,2-dimethoxypropane which forms a cyclic acetal with the 3 and 4 hydroxyl groups of the dihydroxybutyramide (5.) to form the protected dihydroxybutyramide (15D .<br>
Scheme 2 shows the preferred synthesis of 3-amino-1,2-dihydroxypropane isopropylidene acetal (11)<br><br>
and 3-carbon chiral intermediates.<br><br>
In Scheme 2, X is a halogen such as chlorine, iodine, fluorine or bromine. In the process, 3--hydrcxy-Y-butyrolactone (1) is converted to 3,4-dihydroxybutyr amide (2.) in a reaction with ammonium hydroxide at room temperature. The reaction of the 3-hydroxy-y-butyrolactone with ammonia in step (a) is preferably in aqueous solution at temperatures between -70OC and 100OC. The ammonia is preferably between 1 and 4 molar equivalents, optimally 1-2. The water is removed preferably at reduced pressures (10 to 30 mm of Hg) at 30O to 50OC. After removal of water, 2. is converted to the protected butyramide (10) in a reaction mixture containing a protecting group such as 2,2-dimethoxypropane,  and an acid in a solvent such as<br><br>
acetone. In particular, 2. is reacted witn acetone and dimethoxypropane in the presence of a strong acid (sulfuric, hydrochloric, phosphoric, toluene sulfonic acid) at 15O to 70oc for at least 30 minutes and then held at 20 to 25OC for about 6 to 12 hours. Silver oxide is added to eliminate the acid. Any compatible neutralizing agent can be used. The mixture is filtered and then it is concentrated to dryness to produce 2,3-dihydroxybutyramide isopropylidene acetal ia. This reaction is quantitative and produces the protected butyr amide (10) which can be crystallized upon concentration to dryness, A Hoffman rearrangement reaction completely converts 10 to 3-amino-l,2-dihydroxypropane isopropylidene acetal (il) . In particular, iQ is reacted with a hypohalite (CI, I, or Br) in the presence of a base (preferably an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide) with heating at a temperature between 4 0 and 70Oc to produce 3-amino-1,2-dihydroxy isopropylidene acetal 11 which is a key intermediate in the preparation of other compounds, particularly if the product is chiral• For example, 11 can be converted to 1-halo-2,3-dihydroxypropane halide (i) in a reaction containing an acid and the halide which can then be converted to an epoxyalcohol (2.) in a reaction containing a base. Alternatively, reacting l_l with an acid will convert the protected amide to 3-amino-l, 2-dihydroxypropane (A).<br>
The bromodiol ((R)-l-bromo-2,3-dihydroxypropane) can be readily converted to (R)" glycidol by treatment with silver oxide at room temperature in a polar aprotic solvent such as dimethylf ormamide or dimethylsulf oxide. The dihydroxyamide 1 can be protected with any acetal function including benzylidene, ethylidene, methylidene and propylidene. In addition, it may be protected by conversion to a cyclic carbonate by treatment with reagents such as phosgene, ethylch1oroformate or the<br><br>
corresponding  acyl  imidazole.<br>
In the present invention, the carbonyl carbon<br>
of 10 the protected form of 1, which is formed from the<br>
lactone (i) is removed via a Hoffman rearrangement<br>
reaction . In preparing 3-carbon intermiediates, the<br>
present invention has several advantages over the prior<br>
art. The major advantage is that 1 is readily available<br>
in high optical and chemical purity and the reagents<br>
employed in the 1-carbon descension are cheap and safe<br>
to handle. There are no environmentally undesirable<br>
materials such as heavy metal ions involved as in some<br>
prior art processes (Byun, Y.-S., et al., J. Org. Chem.<br>
59:668-671 (1994)). The optical purity of the product<br>
is high unlike in some prior art methods (Byun, H.-S.,<br>
et al., J. Org. Chem. 59:668-671 (1994); Bednarski, M.<br>
D. , et al. , J. Am. Chem. Soc. 109:1283-1285 (1987) ;<br>
Fuganti, C. , et al. , Tetrahedron 44 :2575-2582 (1988) ;<br>
and Chen, J,, et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 34:7663-7666<br>
(1993)). Furthermore, unlike in the prior art, recovery<br>
is simple with just a solvent extraction required.<br>
Therefore, the instant process provides a process the<br>
synthesis of chiral 3-carbon synthons from chiral 3-<br>
hydroxy-y-butyrolactone        i        which	is	virtually<br>
quantitative and avoids the use of expensive transition metal catalysts or enzymes as are used in the prior art. Furthermore, the process is inexpensive to perform and uses renewable natural resources such as starch, lactose, maltodextrins and other readily available carbohydrate  feedstock.<br>
The following examples are intended to promote a   further  understanding  of  the  present   invention.<br>

This Example shows the preparation of (S)-3-amino-1,2-dihydroxypropane isopropylidene acetal 11 from (S)-3-hydroxy-Y-butyrolactone  1.<br>
(S) -3-hydroxy-Y-butyrolactone   (51   g,   0.5  mol)<br><br>
was converted to the amide 2. by treatment at room temperature for 14 hours with 110 ml of 30% ammonium hydroxide (0.85 mol), The solution was then concentrated to a syrup at -50OC under reduced pressure until no more water could be removed. Acetone (500 mL) and 2,2-dimethoxYpropane (104 g, 1 mol) was added. Sulfuric acid (2 mL) was then added and the mixture protected from moisture with a calcium chloride drying tube, heated at 60oc for 30 minutes and stirred at room temperature for 12 hours. Silver oxide (20 g) was added and the mixture stirred for 1 hour. Methanol (200 ml) was then added and the mixture filtered and concentrated to dryness. The amide (15.) crystallized on concentrating and was used directly in the next step. Conversion was essentially quantitative. A small amount when recrystallized from acetone gave white crystals mp, 98-10oC.

Figures 1 and 2 show the 1H-NHR and 12C-MMR profiles, respectively, for 10,<br>
The amide (iS.) (1.59 g 0.01 mol) was treated<br>
with 10 to 12% sodium hypochlorite solution (10 ml) and<br>
the mixture stirred until all of the solid had dissolved<br>
(-5 mins) .  Sodium hydroxide (1,59 g dissolved in 10 ml<br>
water) was added to the mixture and the solution was<br>
warmed to 50-60OC and then kept there for 2 4 hours by<br>
which time conversion to amine 11  completed.   1H-NMR<br>

amine H was isolated by extraction of the mixture with<br>
