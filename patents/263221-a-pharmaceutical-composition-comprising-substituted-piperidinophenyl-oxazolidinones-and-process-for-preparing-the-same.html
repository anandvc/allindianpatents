Specific compounds, compositions and dosage forms to be administered must, be pharmaceutically acceptable. As used herein, such a &amp;quot;pharmaceutically acceptable&amp;quot; component is one that is suitable for use with humans and/or animals without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity, irritation, and allergic response) commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. The pharmaceutical compositions are prepared according to conventional procedures used by persons skilled in the art to make stable and effective compositions.  In the dosage forms, an effective amount of the active compound or the active ingredient is any amount, which produces the desired results. An effective amount can also be that amount of the active compound or active ingredient that will elicit the biological or medical response that is being sought. <br><br>
For the purpose of this invention, a pharmaceutical composition will contain one or more of the active compounds of the invention salts, and/or hydrates thereof, in a form to be administered alone, but generally in a form to be administered in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. Suitable carriers which can be used are, for example, diluents or excipients such as fillers, extenders, binders, emollients, wetting agents, disintegrants, surface active agents and lubricants which are usually employed to prepare such drugs depending on the type of dosage form.<br><br>
The compounds and compositions can be administered to a human or other animal by any suitable route of administration including, for example, oral, rectal, vaginal, parenteral (subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous), transdermal, topical and like. Dosage forms include solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, powders, troches, dispersions, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, pellets, gels, granules, capsules, injectable preparations, patches, ointments, creams, liniments, salves, cachets, aerosol sprays, lotions, shampoos and the like.<br><br>
The prophylactic or therapeutic dose of the compound of Formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutically acceptable solvates or polymorphs thereof, in the prevention, acute or chronic management of infection or disease will vary depending on one or more factors which include but are not limited to the severity of condition to be treated, the risk and the route of administration.  In addition, the dose, and perhaps the dose frequency, will also vary according to the age, sex, body weight and response of the individual patient.  In general, the total daily dose range, for the compounds of Formula I and salts thereof, for the conditions described herein, is from about 200 mg to 1800 mg or more, in single or divided doses. While parenteral administration may be a single dose or up to 3 divided doses, intravenous administration can include a continuous drip.<br><br>
The term &amp;quot;an amount sufficient to eradicate such infections but insufficient to cause undue side effects&amp;quot; is encompassed by the above ‚Äì described dosage amount and dose frequency schedule. <br><br>
A specific embodiment of the invention is that based on the pharmacokinetic profile of compounds the compounds can be administered once-a-day. <br><br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units, for example, such as capsules, cachets, or tablets, or aerosol sprays, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, as a powder or granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid, a non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion.  Such compositions may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy, but all methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier, which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients.  In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation.<br><br>
The compositions of the present invention include compositions such as suspensions, solutions, elixirs, aerosols, injectables and solid dosage forms.  Carriers as described in general below are commonly used in the case of oral solid preparations (such as powders, capsules and tablets). Examples of suitable carriers include excipients such as lactose, white sugar, sodium chloride, glucose solution, urea, starch, calcium carbonate, kaolin, crystalline cellulose and silicic acid, binders such as water, ethanol, propanol, simple syrup, glucose, starch solution, gelatin solution, carboxymethyl cellulose, shellac, methyl cellulose, potassium phosphate and polyvinyl pyrrolidone, disintegrants such as dried starch, sodium alginate, agar powder, laminaria powder, sodium hydrogen carbonate, calcium carbonate, Tween (fatty acid ester of polyoxyethylenesorbitan), sodium lauryl sulfate, stearic acid monoglyceride, starch, and lactose, disintegration inhibitors such as white sugar, stearic acid glyceryl ester, cacao butter and hydrogenated oils, absorption promoters such as quaternary ammonium bases and sodium lauryl sulfate, humectants such as glycerol and starch, absorbents such as starch, lactose, kaolin, bentonite and colloidal silicic acid, and lubricants such as purified talc, stearic acid salts, boric acid powder, polyethylene glycol and solid polyethylene glycol. The tablet, can be coated, and made into sugar-coated tablets, gelatin-coated tablets, enteric-coated tablets, film-coated tablets, or tablets comprising two or more layers. Tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or non-aqueous techniques.  In molding the pharmaceutical composition into pills, a wide variety of conventional carriers known in the art can be used.  Examples of suitable carriers are excipients such as glucose, lactose, starch, cacao butter, hardened vegetable oils, kaolin and talc, binders such as gum arabic powder, tragacanth powder, gelatin, and ethanol, and disintegrants such as laminaria and agar. Desirably, each oral dosage form contains from about 200 mg to about 2500 mg of the active ingredient. In molding the pharmaceutical composition into a suppository form, a wide variety of carriers known in the art can be used. Examples of suitable carriers include polyethylene glycol, cacao butter, higher alcohols, gelatin, and semi-synthetic glycerides.<br><br>
The composition can be administered parenterally by intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous administration by parenteral dosages. Parenteral dosages may be in the form of ready to use dosage forms or solutions for parenteral dosage may be diluted prior to its use.  When the pharmaceutical composition is formulated into an injectable preparation, in formulating the pharmaceutical composition into the form of a solution or suspension, all diluents customarily used in the art can be used.  Examples of suitable diluents are water, ethyl alcohol, polypropylene glycol, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohol, polyoxyethylene sorbitol, and sorbitan esters. Sodium chloride, glucose or glycerol may be incorporated into a therapeutic agent.<br><br>
Another route of administration is topically, for which creams, ointments, shampoos, lotions, dusting powders, and the like are well suited. Generally, an effective amount of the compound of present invention in a topical form is from about 0.1% w/w to about 10% w/w of the total composition. Topical application may be as a non-sprayable form, viscous to semi-solid or solid forms comprising a carrier compatible with topical application. Suitable formulations include but are not limited to solutions, suspensions, emulsions, creams, ointments, powders, liniments, salves, aerosols, etc., which are, if desired, sterilized or mixed with auxiliary agents, e.g. preservatives, antioxidants, stabilizers, wetting agents, buffers or salts for influencing osmotic pressure, etc.  For topical application, also suitable are sprayable aerosol preparations wherein the active ingredient in combination with a solid or liquid inert carrier material. In addition to the common dosage forms set out above, the compounds of the present invention may also be administered by controlled release means and/or delivery devices such as those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123 and 4,008,719; the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br><br>
