				<td>Process for the production of active ingredient<br>
compositions with controlled release from a matrix<br>
The invention relates to a novel process for the<br>
production of compositions with controlled release, in<br>
which the active ingredient is released from a matrix.<br>
Pharmaceutical forms with controlled release are dosage<br>
forms which are substantially adapted to therapeutic<br>
requirements and from which the release of medicinal<br>
substance is controlled by mechanisms which are<br>
influenced to an insignificant extent or not at all by<br>
physiological conditions (pH, enzymes, nature and<br>
quality of the diet). According to the control<br>
principles applied, a distinction is made between<br>
diffusion-, matrix-, swelling-, membrane- or chemically<br>
controlled release. According to the more comprehensive<br>
definition of the American Food and Drug<br>
Administration, controlled release products mean<br>
formulations which are intended to release the active<br>
ingredient at rates which differ significantly from the<br>
corresponding compositions with immediate release. This<br>
definition includes all types of slow release (depot)<br>
pharmaceutical forms as well as those with release at<br>
fixed times, for example enteric-coated products.<br>
A large number of processes for the production of such<br>
formulations are known from the available literature.<br>
For example, EP 324 989 describes the production of a<br>
novel pharmaceutical formulation with controlled<br>
release by wet granulation, wherein the active<br>
ingredient is mixed with appropriate ancillary<br>
substances and granulated in 95% ethanol. After<br>
subsequent drying, the resulting granules are screened<br>
to the required size.<br>
Formulations with controlled release can also be<br>
produced by melt granulation as described, for example,<br>
in DE 24 26 812. In this case, the binding ingredient is<br>
present in a liquid state of aggregation because the<br>
temperature during the granulation process is higher than<br>
the melting point of the low-melting ingredient.<br>
Further processes known in the prior art for producing<br>
formulations with controlled release are granulation or<br>
extrusion as described, for example, in DE 44 08 326.<br>
The active ingredient compositions obtained by the known<br>
processes in some cases show incomplete delay of release or<br>
wide variations in the individual values for release of<br>
active ingredient. This may have particularly<br>
disadvantageous effects for the patient because maintenance<br>
of the required plasma concentration, and thus the<br>
bioavailability, cannot be ensured.<br>
The present invention is now based on the object of<br>
developing a novel, industrially straightforward process for<br>
the production of formulations with controlled release,<br>
which makes reproducible releases of active ingredient<br>
possible.<br>
The object is achieved according to the invention by the<br>
active ingredient or a combination of active ingredients<br>
being granulated, alone or mixed with ancillary substances,<br>
with the addition of binders or mixtures of binders, which<br>
are either molten on addition or first converted into the<br>
molten state of aggregation by heating during this process,<br>
and being screened after the cooling, and the resulting<br>
granules subsequently undergoing after-treatment with<br>
heating in a fluidized bed.<br>
This procedure entails the active ingredient, which may be<br>
insoluble in water or else soluble in water, being<br>
introduced into an intensive mixer or previously mixed with<br>
ancillary substances and granulated in an intensive mixer,<br>
with addition of binders or mixtures of binders, which are<br>
either molten on addition or first converted into the molten<br>
state of aggregation by heating during the process in the<br>
intensive mixer, at temperatures between 10 and 100°C.<br>
Intensive mixtures which can be employed are high-speed<br>
mixers with or without heatable or coolable jacket, such as<br>
Gral Collette or Diosna. The process according to the<br>
invention is particularly advantageous with mixers which<br>
have no jacket heating.<br>
After the cooling, the granules obtained in this way can be<br>
screened through a screen, for example of mesh width 3.0 mm,<br>
and heated in the fluidized bed of a fluidized bed<br>
granulator until the melting point of the fusible binder<br>
employed in the mixture is reached. The after-treatment is<br>
continued in the temperature range 30 - 100°C while feeding<br>
in heated air until the time when the fluidized bed almost<br>
collapses. It is subsequently cooled again.<br>
After this thermal after-treatment, the granules which have<br>
been screened again can be mixed with suitable tabletting<br>
ancillary substances, packed in capsules or compressed to<br>
tablets and, where appropriate, coated with a film layer or<br>
coated with sugar.<br>
Coatings can be, for example, those based on polymethacrylic<br>
acid derivatives or cellulose derivatives.<br>
The production of formulations with controlled release by<br>
the process according to the invention is particularly<br>
suitable for substances from the following classes of active<br>
ingredients:<br>
non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, bronchodilators,<br>
vasodilators, muscle relaxants, antirheumatics such as<br>
diclofenac, antiinflammatory agents, antiepileptics such as<br>
carbamazepine, antihypertensives, antihistamines,<br>
anticoagulants, intestinal therapeutic agents, cytostatics,<br>
calcium antagonists such as verapamil, and cardiac remedies.<br>
Substances which can be used as binders are those having a<br>
melting point between 35 and 90°C. Suitable binders are:<br>
water-soluble or swellable binders such as macrogol,<br>
polyvidone, polymethacrylic acid derivatives (Eudragit),<br>
lipophilic binders such as paraffin, cetyl palmiate, fatty<br>
alcohols such as cetyl alcohol, beeswax, carnauba wax,<br>
hydrogenated vegetable oils, triglycerides and stearic acid.<br>
These substances represent only a list of examples, so that<br>
formulations with controlled release can also be produced in<br>
this way with other active substances and binders.<br>
It was not to be foreseen that the formulations made from<br>
granules produced by the process according to the invention<br>
have reproducible controlled rates of release, with very<br>
narrow variations in individual values, even when the<br>
formulas are changed.<br>
It is possible, surprisingly, by the thermal after-treatment<br>
according to the invention to adjust specific release<br>
characteristics.<br>
This after-treatment, which takes place by heating in the<br>
fluidized bed after previously increasing the surface area<br>
by screening, achieves, irrespective of the contents of the<br>
formula, complete embedding or coating of the active<br>
ingredient in or by the binder in the matrix. This leads to<br>
delay of release complying with specification without<br>
disproportionate losses in the fluidized bed resulting in<br>
deviations in the active ingredient content.<br>
These facts are illustrated in/Figures 1-3:<br>
Figure 1: Effect of the after-treatment according to<br>
the invention on the release of the active<br>
ingredient diclofenac sodium compared with<br>
granules produced by conventional melt<br>
granulation in an intensive mixer according to<br>
the prior art without after-treatment<br>
Figure 2: Comparison of the variations in individual<br>
values of the release of active ingredient from<br>
the dosage forms from the two processes<br>
considered in Figure 1<br>
Figure 3: Delay of release determined exclusively by<br>
the core and thus by the granulation conditions.<br>
The coating has no significant effect on the<br>
release of active ingredient.<br>
The process according to the invention can generally be<br>
applied to achieving specific rates of release, because the<br>
ensured optimal embedding or coating of the medicinal<br>
substance(s) makes it possible to achieve specific<br>
availabilities through the choice of a suitable binder in<br>
the process.<br>
The following examples are intended to illustrate the<br>
process according to the invention.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Tablet containing 100 mg of diclofenac sodium in mg/tablet<br>
consisting of:<br>
sucrose 105.0<br>
diclofenac sodium 100.0<br>
cetyl alcohol 55.20<br>
silicon dioxide 0.52<br>
magnesium stearate 1.30<br>
polyvidone 1.28<br>
Total 263.30<br>
Sucrose and the active ingredient diclofenac sodium are<br>
mixed. The molten cetyl alcohol (temperature 65 ± 2°C)<br>
is subsequently added in an intensive mixer. After a<br>
granulation time of less than 10 minutes, an increase<br>
in power occurs and the granulation is stopped. The<br>
granules are passed through a suitable screen. The<br>
after-treatment then takes place in a fluidized bed<br>
granulator, with the inlet air at a temperature of 60 -<br>
75°C. At a product temperature of about 43°C, the<br>
binder starts to melt, and further granule formation<br>
starts. The endpoint of the granulation is reached<br>
before the fluidized bed collapses, and it is cooled.<br>
Screening is subsequently carried out once again. After<br>
the addition of silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate and<br>
polyvidone and mixing, the resulting tabletting mixture<br>
is compressed to tablets with an active ingredient<br>
content of 100 mg.<br>
Example 2:<br>
Tablet containing 120 mg of verapamil hydrochloride in<br>
mg/tablet, consisting of:<br>
verapamil hydrochloride 120<br>
cetyl alcohol 183<br>
cellulose 101<br>
silicon dioxide 2<br>
magnesium stearate__________________4_<br>
Total 410<br>
Molten cetyl alcohol is added to the active ingredient<br>
verapamil hydrochloride while stirring in an intensive<br>
mixer. After a short granulation time, the granules are<br>
removed, screened and then heated in a fluidized bed.<br>
The required melting process starts at a product<br>
temperature of about 43°C and is continued up to an<br>
endpoint before the fluidized bed collapses. It is then<br>
immediately cooled, screened and mixed with silicon<br>
dioxide and magnesium stearate. Tablets with a content<br>
of 120 mg of verapamil hydrochloride are produced.<br>
Example 3:<br>
verapamil hydrochloride 120<br>
cetyl alcohol 66<br>
cellulose 101<br>
sucrose 117<br>
silicon dioxide 2<br>
magnesium stearate__________________4_<br>
Total 410<br>
Production takes place in analogy to Examples 1 and 2.<br>
