				<td>NOVEL BENZOIMIDAZOLE DERIVATIVES AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION COMPRISING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates, in general, to novel benzoimidazole derivatives and, more particularly, to novel benzoimidazole derivatives functioning as antagonists to a vanilloid receptor (capsaicin receptor; Transient Receptor Potential Channel, Vanilloid subfamily member 1; TRPV-1; Vanilloid receptor-1; VR-1). Also, the present invention is concerned with a method for preparing the benzoimidazole derivatives, uses of the derivatives and pharmaceutical compositions comprising the derivatives as active ingredients.<br>
Background Art<br>
The vanilloid receptor, the receptor for capsaicin (trans-8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide), has long been assumed to exist. Finally, it was cloned in 1997 and called vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (hereinafter referred to as "VR-1") by Caterina et al. (Caterina et al., Nature, .1997, 389, 816). Located on small unmyelinated nerve fibers (C-fibers) and myelinated nerve fibers (A-fibers), VR-1. is known as an ion channel which plays an important role in<br>
sensitizing pain stimuli by introducing the strong influx of cations such as calcium and sodium ions into the nerve endings upon activation in response to external or internal stimuli. External stimuli capable of activating VR-1 are reported to include heat and acids as well as vanilloid compounds (Tominaga et al., Neuron, 1998, 21, 531). As internal stimuli to VR-1, there are leukotriene metabolites such as 12-hydroperoxyeicosa tetraenoic acid (12-HPETE) (Hwang at al., PNAS, 2000, 97, 3655), and arachidonic acid derivatives such as anandamide (Premkumar et al., Nature, 2000, 408, 985).<br>
On the basis of these physiological activities, VR1 has attracted intensive attention as an integral controller playing a pivotal role in transferring various external injurable stimuli into nerve cells. According to a report, VRl knock-out mice responded like normal mice to general stimuli, but showed greatly reduced pain response to heat or thermal hyperalgesia, which reflects the importance of VRl against noxious stimuli (Caterina et al., Science, 2000, 288, 306).<br>
VRl is concentratively expressed in primary sensory neurons (Caterina et al., Nature, 1997, 389, 816), which are responsible for controlling functions of internal organs such as the skin, the bones, the bladder, the gastrointestinal tract, the lungs, and so on. In addition, being distributed in other neurons on the central nervous<br>
system, the kidneys, the stomach, and T-cells (Nozawa et al., Neuroscience Letter, 2001, 309, 33; Yiangou et al., Lanqet.(North America Edition), 2001, 357, 1338 ; Birder et<br>
al., PNAS, 2001, 98, 13396) and throughout the entire body, VR1 is inferred to play an important role in cell division and cellular signal control.<br>
Indications found, thus far, to be associated with the control mechanism of the activity of VR1 include pain, acute pain, chronic pain, neuropathic pain, postoperative pain, migraines, arthralgia, neuropathy, nerve injury, diabetic neuropathy, neurological illness, neurodermatitis, strokes, bladder hypersensitivity, irritable bowel syndrome, respiratory disorders such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, etc., irritation to the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes, itching, fever, gastric-duodenal ulcer, inflammatory intestinal diseases, and urge incontinence (Korean Pat. Laid-Open Publication No. 10-2004-0034804), and an anti-obestic effect (Pharmacol. Rev., 1986, 38, 179).<br>
Based on pharmaceutical mechanisms, both agonists and antagonists of VR1 may be used for the treatment of the above-mentioned diseases. Pain alleviating effects of VR1 agonists show the pharmaceutical mechanism based on the desensitization of capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves. That is, VR1 agonists cause pain and irritation of sensory nerves so as to desensitize them to other noxious stimuli.<br>
Due to the induction of pain in the early stage, VR1 agonists are developed only as local analgesics. In contrast, acting through the mechanism of blocking sensory nerves from recognizing pain signals, VRl antagonists do not cause early pain or irritation, and have been studied for use in the treatment of systemic diseases.<br>
As compounds capable of modulating VRl activity, agonists such as capsaicin,. DA-5018, resiniferatoxin, etc. are used as pain drugs or are under clinical study (Szallasi, J. Med chem., 2004, 47, 2717), while 20 VRl antagonists including capsazepine and iodoresiniferatoxin are under pre-clinical study (W00208221, WO03062209, W02004055003, W02004055004, W02004002983, WO0216317, W02004035549, W02004014871, W003099284, WO03022809, •W002090326, W002072536, W003068749, W02004033435, WO02076946, W00095420, W003055484, W003014064, W003080578, W003097586, W003070247, W003029199).<br>
Featuring superior VR-1 antagonistic effects, the novel benzoimidazole derivatives according to the present invention have chemical structures different from those of the VRl antagonists reported thus far.<br>
Although the compounds included within the scope of the present invention themselves are VRl antagonists, the possibility is not excluded that modified forms thereof in an intracellular environment or metabolites thereof act as. effective principles responsible for the medicinal<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Leading to the present invention, intensive and thorough research on the modulation of the activity of VR-1, conducted by the present inventors, resulted in the finding that benzoimidazole derivatives different in chemical structure from antagonists known in the art can act as excellent antagonists having potent medicinal effects (pain and inflammation relief and anti-ulcer effect) and are accepted as highly safe from measurements in animal models.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide novel benzoimidazole derivatives highly inhibitory of the activity of VR-1, or innoxious salts or solvates thereof.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a method for preparing the novel benzoimidazole derivatives, or innoxious salts or solvates thereof.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide pharmaceutical compositions inhibitory of the activity of VR-1, comprising the novel benzoimidazole derivatives, or innoxious salts or solvates thereof.<br>

In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method for preparing the compounds of Chemical Formula 1 is provided. The method may be conducted to chemically synthesize the compounds in accordance with the following reaction scheme, but is not limited thereto. The reaction scheme guides the preparation of representative compounds of the present invention, but modifications may be made to reagents and starting materials well known in the art so as to employ other compounds.<br>
Having chiral centers, some of the compounds represented by Chemical Formula 1 may be in form of enantiomers. Therefore, it should be noted that all optical isomers, R or S type stereoisomers, racemates and enantiomers of the compounds of Chemical Formula 1 are included within the scope of the present invention. In addition, the present invention includes the use of racemates, one or more enantiomers, one or more diastereomers, or combinations thereof, and methods for separating or preparing the isomers.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, provided is a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound of Chemical Formula 1 as an active ingredient in an effective amount in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The following reaction scheme 1 accounts for the<br>
synthesis  of   the   compounds   represented  by  Chemical   Formula 1:<br>
(Formula 1 Removed)<br>
As shown in Reaction Scheme 1, benzoic acid derivatives (IX) useful in synthesizing the object compound benzoimidazole compound 1 can be prepared by reacting commercially available halogen compounds (II) with boronic acid (III) in the presence of a palladium catalyst and a base in a typical reaction condition with the aid of microwaves (Tapolcsanyi et. al., Tetrahedron, 2002, 58, 10137).<br>
If not commercially available, boronic acid can be obtained through the oxidation of methylboronic acid (V) (Sharma et. al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1998, 8, 3459-3464). Alternatively, methylboronic acid (V) is reacted with a halogen compound (II), followed by oxidation to afford the benzoic acid derivatives (IX).<br>
On the other hand, halobenzoic acid (VIII) may be reacted with commercially available boronic acid (VII), or a commercially available benzoic acid (X) may be used.<br>
Such synthetic or commercially available benzoic acid derivatives are condensed with diamine derivatives (IX) in the presence of 0-(7-azabenzotriazol-l-yl)-N,N,N' , N'-tetramethyleuronium hexafluorophosphate to synthesize the intermediates, that is, amide compounds, which are then subjected to cyclization into the object compound benzoimidazole 1. In this case, the preparation of the benzoimidazole 1 may be achieved in the presence of acetic<br>
acid, a hydrochloric acid solution (Roglic et. al., Pharmazie, 2001, 56, 803), POC13 (Ries, et. al., J. Med. Chem, 1993, 36, 4040), polyphosphoric acid (Ries, et. al., J. Med. Chem, 1993, 36, 4040), or pyridine (Abha et. al., Indian Journal of Chemistry, 2002, 41, 1978) in a heated condition or with the aid of microwave (Lu, et. al., Syn. Comm. 2002, 32, 3703) .<br>
As shown above, the compounds of Chemical Formula 1 may be in form of salts, particularly pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The pharmaceutically available salts suitable for use in the present invention are those typically used in the art, such as acid addition salts, and include those disclosed in the literature (J. Pharm. Sci., 1977, 66, 1) .<br>
Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts suitable for use in the present invention include salts of inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, orthophosphoric aicd, sulfuric acid, and so on, and salts of organic acids, such as methanesulfonic acid, benzensulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, salicylic acid, maleic acid, glycerophosphoric acid, acetylsalicylic acid, and so on.<br>
In addition, pharmaceutically acceptable metal salts may be prepared using bases. Alkali metal salts or alkaline<br>
earth metal salts, lor example, may be obtained by dissolving compounds in an excess of an alrali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide solution, filtering off non-dissolved compound salts, and vaporizing and drying the filtrate. In this regard, sodium, potassium or calcium salts are pharmaceutically suitable metal salts. In addition, silver salts corresponding to the metal salts can be obtained by reacting alkaline metal or alkali earth metal with suitable silver salts (e.g., nitrate).<br>
Pharmaceutically unacceptable salts and/or solvates of compounds of Chemical Formula 1 may be useful as intermediates for the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or solvates of compounds of Chemical Formula 1, or for the preparation of the compounds themselves of Chemical Formula 1, which also constitutes another aspect of the present invention.<br>
Compounds of Chemical Formula 1 may be prepared in crystalline or non-crystalline forms. If crystalline, the compounds may be arbitrarily hydrated or solvated. Compounds with arbitrary numbers of water molecyules as well as stoichiomatric hydrates fall into the scope of the present invention.<br>
Suitable are solvates which are pharmaceutically acceptable, like hydrates.<br>
Solvates suitable for use in the present invention comprise both stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric<br>
solvates.<br>
It is believed that, because they possess antagonistic activity against the vanilloid receptor, compounds of Chemical Formula 1 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof have potential to be used for the prevention and treatment of indications and the treatment of the pain relevant thereto.<br>
The indications may be exemplified by pain, acute pain, chronic pain, neuropathic pain, postoperative pain, migraine, arthralgia, neuropathy, nerve injury, diabetic neuropathy, neurological illness, neurodermatitis, stroke, bladder hypersensitivity, irritable bowel syndrome, respiratory disorders such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, etc., burning, psoriasis, itching, vomiting, irritation of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes, gastric-duodenal ulcers, inflammatory intestinal diseases, and inflammatory diseases.<br>
Thus, the present invention also provides the compounds of Chemical Formula 1, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates thereof, which are useful as active ingredients for the prevention and treatment of indications.<br>
Particularly, the present invention provides the compounds of Chemical Formula 1, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates thereof, which are useful for the prevention and treatment of pain.<br><br>
Further, the present invention provides a method for preventing or treating symptoms for which antagonism to the vanilloid receptor is helpful in the therapy thereof, comprising the administration of compounds of Chemical Formula 1, or pharmaceutical acceptable salts or solvates thereof in a therapeutically effective amount to mammalians having the symptoms.<br>

EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE  1:  Assay  for  Inhibitory Activity against Vanilloid Receptor<br>
1) Preparation of test compounds<br>
Each of the compounds synthesized in the examples were  dissolved  in  dimethyl  sulfoxide  (DMSO)  at  a<br>
concentration sodium  tor use in the assay for inhibitory activity against, patch clamp activity, the solutions were diluted  to  a  concentration  of  1  µM with  the  same physiological saline as in the pipette solution of Table 1, below.<br>
2) Assay for inhibitory activity against VR1 patch clamp activity<br>
In this experiment, changes in VR1 activity were recorded in current using an electrophysiological technique.<br>
For use in this experiment, a rat TRPV1 cDNA was transfected into a subcultured HEK293 strain with the aid of lipofectamin.<br>
The rat TRPV1 gene-transfected HEK293 cells were detached from the cell culture dishes with trypsin and distributed on a patch clamp recording chamber.<br>
A cover glass slip on the bottom of the patch clamp recording chamber was treated for 15 min or longer with a 50% poly-L-lysine solution so that the HEK cells would readily adhere thereto. Cellular membranes wer ruptured at room temperature (~25°C) from randomly selected HEK cells to perform an inside-out patch clamp technique. 10 µM of capsaicin was fed into the chamber (cytoplasmic side) to activate a capsaicin current through the VR1. When the capsaicin current reached a stable stage, each compound was<br>
added along with in the of capeaicin to record the inhibitory activity of the completes computers with regard to the current. The inhibition was expressed as percentages. Because the capsaicin current showed rapid run-down in the presence of calcium ions across the membrane, experimental solutions comprising the ion compositions of Table 1 were used to prevent the run-down and record the inhibitory activity of effective compounds.<br>

Detected current was amplified using a Digidata 1200B A/D converter and an Axopatch ID amplifier (Axon instruments Inc.), and the data were recorded and analyzed with the aid of a computer. The inhibitory activity of each compound was expressed as a percentage relative to the capsaicin current immediately before the administration of each compound.<br>

Receptor<br>
•Experiments    for	calcium    influx    were    performed    to<br>
measure the activity of	the compounds as antagonists.<br>
1)   Cell culture<br>
The cell strain hVRl-HEK293 is the human embryonic kidney(HEK) 293 Tet-on cell transfected with a human vanilloid-1 gene (pTRE2hyg-hVRl, 7.8kb), which is capable of controlling the expression of VR1 according to the administration of deoxycycline, a tetracycline derivative analog. In a medium supplemented with deoxycycline two days before calcium influx experiments, the cell strain was cultured to induce the expression of VR1. After being grown to a confluency of about 80% in T75 flasks, hVRl-HEK293 was detached from the flask using trypsin. Cells harvested by centrifugation were suspended in a medium supplemented with lµg/mL of deoxycycline and diluted to a density of 2-4 x 105 cells/ml, after which a 100 µL aliquot of the cell suspension was added to each well of 96 well black plates. Before the measurement of calcium influx, the cells were incubated for two days at 370C in a 5% CO2 incubator.<br>
2)	Preparation of compound samples<br>
For use in calcium influx experiments, each compound was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).<br>
3)	Measurement of calcium influx<br>
To measure an intracellular calcium influx, cells were incubated at 37°C for 90 min in a medium containing the calcium indicator Fluo-3/AM so as to allow the fluorescent dye to. penetrate into the cells. Then, the cells were washed three times with D-PBS (Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline) containing lOmM HEPES to remove the<br>
fluorescent dye which remained outside. 193µL aliquot of D-PBS was added to each well, followed by the addition of various c'oncentrations of compounds thereto. In order to measure the antagonistic activity of the compounds, calcium influx was induced by treatment with luM capsaicin. The inhibitory effect of each compound on luM capsaicin-induced intracellular ..calcium influx according to compound concentration was measured using a fluorescent analyzer and the data thus obtained were analyzed on the basis of the Hill's equation.<br>
