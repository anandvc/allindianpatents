CHLOROPHENYL) -2-HYDROXY  PROPYL] -2,4-DIHYDRO- [ 1., 2,4]  TRIAZOLE-3-THIONE"<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a body corporate organised under the laws of Germany, of D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br><br><br>
GARNTED<br>
23/3/2000<br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
a)        racemic    2-[2-(l-chloro-cyclopropyl)-3-(2-chloro-phenyl)-2-hydroxypropyl]-2,4-dihydro-[l,2,4]-triazole-3-thione of the formula<br><br>
is chromatographed on a chiral stationary silica gel phase based on the optically active monomer N-methacryloyl-L-leucine-3-(2,4-dimethylpentyl)-amide using ethyl acetate as mobile phase at temperatures between 20°C and 25°C,<br>
b)	the eluate is concentrated under reduced pressure and<br>
c)	the resulting product is recrystallized from toluene.<br>
Finally, it has been found that the novel (-)-enantiomer of 2-[2-(l-chloro-cyclopro-pyl)-3-(2-chloro-phenyl)-2-hydroxypropyl]-2,4-dihydro-[ 1,2,4]-triazole-3-thione of the formula (I) has very good-microbicidal properties and can be used both in crop protection and in the protection of materials for controlling undesirable microorganisms, such as fungi.<br>
Surprisingly, the (-)-enantiomer of 2-[2-(l-chloro-cyclopropyl)-3-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxypropyl]-2,4-dihydro-[l,2,4]-triazole-3-thione of the formula (I) according to the invention has considerably better fungicidal activity than the corresponding (+)-enantiomer and the corresponding racemate, which is known as a highly effective active compound with fungicidal properties.<br><br><br><br>
5	or in the tautomeric "mercapto" form of the formula<br>
Some or all of the (-)-enantiomer according to the invention can be present in the "thiono" form of the formula<br><br>
For the sake of simplicity, only the "thiono" form is shown in each case.<br>
10	In the formula (I) and (Ib), the asymmetrically substituted carbon atom is in each case<br>
marked by an (*).<br>
The racemic 2-[2-(l-chloro-cyclopropyl)-3-(2-chloro-phenyl)-2-hydroxypropyl]-2,4-<br>
dihydro-[l,2,4]-triazole-3-thione of the formula (la) which is required as starting<br>
15	material for carrying out the process according to the invention is known (cf.<br>
WO 96-16 048).<br>
When carrying out the process according to the invention, methods of preparative<br>
chromatography, preferably the method of high-performance liquid chromatography<br>
20	(=HPLC), are employed. The separating material used for this purpose is known (cf.<br>
EP-A 0 397 917).<br><br><br><br>
The substance content in the eluate is determined by photometric detection. The<br>
collected eluate fractions are analyzed for enantiomeric purity. All the fractions<br>
which contain the same enantiomer are pooled and concentrated under reduced<br>
5	pressure. The resulting product is then recrystallized from toluene.<br>
The product that elutes first is the (-)-enantiomer according to the invention. From other fractions which elute later, the corresponding (+)-enantiomer can be isolated.<br>
10	The active compound according to the invention has potent microbicidal activity and<br>
can be employed for controlling undesirable microorganisms, such as fungi and bacteria, in crop protection and in the protection of materials.<br>
Fungicides can be employed in crop protection for controlling Plasmodiophoro-<br>
15	mycetes, Oomycetes, Chytridiomycetes, Zygomycetes, Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes<br>

5	The active compound can be used as such or in the form of its formulations or the use<br>
forms prepared therefrom, such as ready-to-use solutions, suspensions, wettable<br>
powders, pastes, soluble powders, dusts and granules. They are used in the customary<br>
manner, for example by pouring, spraying, atomizing, spreading, dusting, foaming,<br>
brushing on and the like. It is further possible to apply the active compound by the<br>
10	ultra-low-volume method or to inject the active compound formulation, or the active<br>
compound itself, into the soil. The seed of the plants can also be treated.<br>
When using the active compound according to the invention as fungicide, the application rate can be varied within a relatively wide range, depending on the type<br>
15	of application. In the treatment of parts of plants, the application rates of active<br>
compound are generally between 0.1 and 10,000 g/ha, preferably between 10 and 1000 g/ha. In the treatment of seed, the application rates of active compound are generally between 0.001 and 50 g per kilogram of seed, preferably between 0.01 and 10 g per kilogram of seed.

30	0.001 to 5% by weight, preferably 0.05 to 1.0% by weight, based on the material to<br>
be protected.<br><br><br>
The activity and the spectrum of activity of the active compound to be used according to the invention in the protection of materials, or of the compositions, concentrates or quite generally formulations prepared therefrom, can be increased by adding, if appropriate, other antimicrobially active compounds, fungicides, bactericides, herbicides, insecticides or other active compounds to" widen the spectrum of activity or to obtain particular effects, such as, for example, additional protection against insects. These mixtures may have a wider spectrum of activity than the compounds according to the invention.<br>

Preparation Example<br><br>
300 g of racemic 2-[2-(l-chloro-cyclopropyl)-3-(2-chloro-phenyl)-2-hydroxypropyl]-2,4-dihydro-[l,2,4]-triazole-3-thione are separated in portions of 0.2 g on a chiral stationary silica gel phase (CSP) based on the optically active monomer N-methacryloyl-L-leucine-3-(2,4-dimethyl-pentyl)-amide using ethyl acetate as mobile phase at room temperature (about 23°C), by the HPLC method. The eluate is subjected to photometric detection. Specifically, the preparation separation is carried out under the conditions outlined below.<br>
Column:	CSP as above, 10 urn; 570 * 50 mm1D<br>
Mobile phase:	ethyl acetate<br>
Flow rate:	100ml/min<br>
Detection:	UV; 254 tun<br>
Sample application:	0.2 g dissolved in 20 ml of ethyl acetate<br>
The fractions which contain the same enantiomer are pooled and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting product is then recrystallized from toluene.<br>
Under the stated conditions, the laevorotatory enantiomer elutes first, followed by the dextrorotatory enantiomer.<br><br><br>
This gives 117 g of the (-)-enantiomer of 2-[2-(l-chloro-cyclopropyl)-3-(2-chloro-phenyl)-2-hydroxypropyl]-2,4-dihydro-[l,2,4]-triazole-3-thione in the form of a solid of melting point 123 to 124°C.<br>

The eluate is subjected to photometric detection and the relative retention ratio of the eantiomers is expressed by the separation factor alpha, which is calculated according to the following formula:<br><br><br>
a	= separation factor alpha<br>
t0	= time at which the peak maximum of an unretained compound is detected<br>
t1	= time at which the peak maximum of the first eluted enantiomer is detected<br>
t2	= time at which the peak maximum of the second eluted enantiomer is detected<br>
A A separation factor alpha of 1 indicates that the racemate has not been resolved, whereas a separation factor alpha of higher than 1 indicates that the enantiomers have been separated. The higher the separation factor alpha is, the better is the resolution.<br>
