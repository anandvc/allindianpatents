				<td> IThe present invention relates to novel pharmaceutical compositions based on anticholinergics and EGFR kinase inhibitors, processes for preparing them and their use in the treatment of respiratory complaints.<br>
Description of the invention The present invention relates to novel pharmaceutical compositions based on anticholinergics and EGFR-kinase inhibitors, processes for preparing them and their use in the treatment of respiratory complaints.<br>
Surprisingly, an unexpectedly beneficial therapeutic effect, particularly a synergistic effect can be observed in the treatment of inflammatory and/or obstructive diseases of the respiratory tract if one or more, preferably one, anticholinergic is used with one or more, preferably one, EGFR-kinase inhibitor.  In view of this synergistic effect the pharmaceutical combinations according to the invention can be used in smaller doses than would be the case with the individual compounds used in monotherapy in the usual way.<br>
The combinations of active substances according to the invention are surprisingly characterised both by a rapid onset of activity and also by a long-lasting duration of activity. This is very important to the patient's feeling of well-being, as on the one hand they experience a rapid improvement in their condition once the combination has been administered and on the other hand the drug need only be taken once a day, thanks to its long-lasting effects.<br>
These effects are observed both when the active substances are administered simultaneously within a single active substance formulation and also when the two active substances are administered successively in separate formulations. It is preferable according to the invention to administer the two active ingredients simultaneously in a single formulation.<br>
Within the scope of the present invention the term anticholinergics 1 denotes salts which are preferably selected from among the tiotropium salts, oxitropium salts and ipratropium salts, of which the tiotropium salts are particularly preferred. In the above-mentioned salts the cations tiotropium.<br><br>
as described above combined with a device suitable for administering these formulations, preferably in conjunction with the Respimat®. Preferably, the invention relates to propellant-free inhalable solutions or suspensions characterised by the combination of active substances 1 and 2 according to the Invention In conjunction with the device known by the name Resplmat®. In addition, the present Invention relates to the above-mentioned devices for inhalation, preferably the Resplmat®, characterised In that they contain the propellant-free inhalable solutions or suspensions according to the invention as described hereinbefore.<br>
The propellant-free Inhalable solutions or suspensions aooordtng to the invention may take the form of concentrates or sterile inhalable solutions cr suspensions ready for use, as well as the above -mentioned solutions and suspensions designed for use in a Respimat®. Formulations ready for use may be produced from the concentrates, for example, by the addition of isotonic saline solutions. Sterile formulations ready for use may be administered using energy-operated fixed or portable nebulrsers which produce inhalable aerosols by means of ultrasound or compressed air by the Venturi principle or other principles.<br>
Accordingly, in another aspect, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions in the form of pnopellant-free inhalable solutions or suspensions as described hereinbefore which take the form of concentrates or sterile formulations ready for use, combined with a device suitable for administering these solutions, characterised in that the device is an energy-operated free-standing or portable nebuJiser which produces Inhalable aerosols by means of ultrasound or compressed air by the Venturi principle or other methods.<br>

acceptable excipients, the following physiologically acceptable excipients may<br>
be used to prepare these inhalable powders according to the invention:<br>
monosaccharides (e.g. glucose or arabinose), disaccharides (e.g. lactose,<br>
saccharose, maltose), oligo- and polysaccharides (e.g. dextran), polyalcohols<br>
(e.g. sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol), salts (e.g. sodium chloride, calcium carbonate)<br>
or mixtures of these excipients. Preferably, mono- or disaccharides are used,<br>
while the use of lactose or glucose is preferred, particularly, but not<br>
exclusively, in the form of their hydrates. For the purposes of the invention,<br>
lactose is the particularly preferred excipient, while lactose monohydrate is<br>
most particularly preferred.<br>
Within the scope of the inhalable powders according to the invention the<br>
excipients have a maximum average particle size of up to 250um, preferably<br>
between 10 and 150um, most preferably between 15 and 80um. It may<br>
sometimes seem appropriate to add finer excipient fractions with an average<br>
particle size of 1 to 9um to the excipient mentioned above. These finer<br>
excipients are also selected from the group of possible excipients listed<br>
hereinbefore. Finally, in order to prepare the inhalable powders according to<br>
the invention, micronised active substance 1 and 2, preferably with an<br>
average particle size of 0.5 to 10|im, more preferably from 1 to 6|j,m, is added<br>
to the excipient mixture. Processes for producing the inhalable powders<br>
according to the invention by grinding and micronising and by finally mixing<br>
the ingredients together are known from the prior art. The inhalable powders<br>
according to the invention may be prepared and administered either in the<br>
form of a single powder mixture which contains both 1 and 2 or in the form of<br>
separate inhalable powders which contain only 1 or 2.<br>
The inhalable powders according to the invention may be administered using<br>
inhalers known from the prior art. Inhalable powders according to the<br>
invention which contain a physiologically acceptable excipient in addition to 1<br>
and 2 may be administered, for example, by means of inhalers which deliver a<br>
single dose from a supply using a measuring chamber as described in<br>
US 4570630A, or by other means as described in DE 36 25 685 A. Preferably,<br>
the inhalable powders according to the invention which contain physiologically<br>
acceptable excipients in addition to 1 and 2 are packed into capsules (to<br>
produce so-called inhalettes) which are used in inhalers as described, for<br>
example, in WO 94/28958.<br>
A particularly preferred inhaler for using the pharmaceutical combination<br>
according to the invention in inhalettes is shown in Figure 1.<br>
This inhaler (Handyhaler) for inhaling powdered pharmaceutical compositions<br>
from capsules is characterised by a housing 1 containing two windows 2, a<br>
deck 3 in which there are air inlet ports and which is provided with a screen 5<br>
secured via a screen housing 4, an inhalation chamber 6 connected to the<br>
deck 3 on which there is a push button 9 provided with two sharpened pins 7<br>
and movable counter to a spring 8, and a mouthpiece 12 which is connected<br>
to the housing 1, the deck 3 and a cover 11 via a spindle 10 to enable it to be<br>
flipped open or shut and air holes 13 for adjusting the flow resistance.<br>
If the inhalable powders according to the invention are packed into capsules<br>
(inhalers) for the preferred use described above, the quantities packed into<br>
each capsule should be 1 to 50mg, preferably 3 to 45mg, more particularly 5<br>
to 40mg of inhalable powder per capsule. These capsules contain, according<br>
to the invention, either together or separately, the doses of 1 and 2<br>
mentioned hereinbefore for each single dose.<br>
B) Propellant gas-driven inhalation aerosols containing the<br>
combinations of active substances 1_and 2:<br>
Inhalation aerosols containing propellant gas according to the invention may<br>
contain substances l_and 2 dissolved in the propellant gas or in dispersed<br>
form. 1_and 2 may be present in separate formulations or in a single<br>
preparation, in which 1_and 2 are either each dissolved, dispersed or only one<br>
or two of the components is or are dissolved and the other or others is or are<br>
dispersed. The propellant gases which may be used to prepare the inhalation<br>
aerosols according to the invention are known from the prior art. Suitable<br>
propellant gases are selected from among hydrocarbons such as n-propane,<br>
n-butane or isobutane and halohydrocarbons such as fluorinated derivatives<br>
of methane, ethane, propane, butane, cyclopropane or cyclobutane. The<br>
propellant gases mentioned above may be used on their own or in mixtures<br>
thereof. Particularly preferred propellant gases are halogenated alkane<br>
derivatives selected from TG1 1, TG12, TG134a and TG227. Of the<br>
abovementioned halogenated hydrocarbons, TG134a (1,1,1,2-<br>
tetrafluoroethano) and TG227 (1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane) and<br>
mixtures thereof are preferred according to the invention.<br>
The propel lant-driven inhalation aerosols according to the invention may also<br>
contain other ingredients such as co-solvents, stabilisers, surfactants,<br>
antioxidants, lubricants and pH adjusters. All these ingredients are known in<br>
the art.<br>
The inhalation aerosols containing propellant gas according to the invention<br>
may contain up to 5 wt.-% of active substance 1 and 2. Aerosols according<br>
to the invention contain, for example, 0.002 to 5 wt.-%, 0.01 to 3 wt.-%, 0.015<br>
to 2 wt.-%, 0.1 to 2 wt.-%, 0.5 to 2 wt.-% or 0.5 to 1 wt.-% of active substance<br>
1 and/or 2.<br>
If the active substances 1 and/or 2 are present in dispersed form, the<br>
particles of active substance preferably have an average particle size of up to<br>
preferably from 0.1 to 5|im, more preferably from 1 to 5|j,m.<br>
The propellant-driven inhalation aerosols according to the invention<br>
mentioned above may be administered using inhalers known in the art (MDIs<br>
= metered dose inhalers). Accordingly, in another aspect, the present<br>
invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions in the form of propellantdriven<br>
aerosols as hereinbefore described combined with one or more<br>
inhalers suitable for administering these aerosols. In addition, the present<br>
invention relates to inhalers which are characterised in that they contain the<br>
propellant gas-containing aerosols described above according to the<br>
invention. The present invention also relates to cartridges which are fitted<br>
with a suitable valve and can be used in a suitable inhaler and which contain<br>
one of the above-mentioned propellant gas-containing inhalation aerosols<br>
according to the invention. Suitable cartridges and methods of filling these<br>
cartridges with the inhalable aerosols containing propellant gas according to<br>
the invention are known from the prior art.<br>
C) Propel I ant-free inhalable solutions or suspensions containing the<br>
combinations of active substances 1 and 2 according to the invention:<br>
It is particularly preferred to use the active substance combination according<br>
to the invention in the form of propellant-free inhalable solutions and<br>
suspensions. The solvent used may be an aqueous or alcoholic, preferably<br>
an ethanolic solution. The solvent may be water on its own or a mixture of<br>
water and ethanol. The relative proportion of ethanol compared with water is<br>
not limited but the maximum is up to 70 percent by volume, more particularly<br>
up to 60 percent by volume and most preferably up to 30 percent by volume.<br>
The remainder of the volume is made up of water. The solutions or<br>
suspensions containing 1 and 2, separately or together, are adjusted to a pH<br>
of 2 to 7, preferably 2 to 5, using suitable acids. The pH may be adjusted<br>
using acids selected from inorganic or organic acids. Examples of suitable<br>
inorganic acids include hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid,<br>
sulphuric acid and/or phosphoric acid. Examples of particularly suitable<br>
organic acids include ascorbic acid, citric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, maleic<br>
acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, acetic acid, formic acid and/or propionic acid<br>
etc. Preferred inorganic acids are hydrochloric and sulphuric acids. It is also<br>
possible to use the acids which have already formed an acid addition salt with<br>
one of the active substances. Of the organic acids, ascorbic acid, fumaric<br>
acid and citric acid are preferred. If desired, mixtures of the above acids may<br>
be used, particularly in the case of acids which have other properties in<br>
addition to their acidifying qualities, e.g. as flavourings, antioxidants or<br>
complexing agents, such as citric acid or ascorbic acid, for example.<br>
According to the invention, it is particularly preferred to use hydrochloric acid<br>
to adjust the pH.<br>
According to the invention, the addition of editic acid (EDTA) or one of the<br>
known salts thereof, sodium edetate, as stabiliser or complexing agent is<br>
unnecessary in the present formulation. Other embodiments may contain this<br>
compound or these compounds. In a preferred embodiment the content<br>
based on sodium edetate is less than 100 mg/100ml, preferably less than<br>
50mg/100ml, more preferably less than 20mg/100ml. Generally, inhalable<br>
solutions in which the content of sodium edetate is from 0 to 10mg/100ml are<br>
preferred.<br>
Co-solvents and/or other excipients may be added to the propellant-free<br>
inhalable solutions according to the invention. Preferred co-solvents are<br>
those which contain hydroxyl groups or other polar groups, e.g. alcohols -<br>
particularly isopropyl alcohol, glycols - particularly propyleneglycol,<br>
polyethyleneglycol, polypropyleneglycol, glycolether, glycerol,<br>
polyoxyethylene alcohols and polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters. The terms<br>
excipients and additives in this context denote any pharmacologically<br>
acceptable substance which is not an active substance but which can be<br>
formulated with the active substance or substances in the physiologically<br>
suitable solvent in order to improve the qualitative properties of the active<br>
substance formulation. Preferably, these substances have no<br>
pharmacological effect or, in connection with the desired therapy, no<br>
appreciable or at least no undesirable pharmacological effect. The excipients<br>
and additives include, for example, surfactants such as soya lecithin, oleic<br>
acid, sorbitan esters, such as polysorbates, polyvinylpyrrolidone, other<br>
stabilisers, complexing agents, antioxidants and/or preservatives which<br>
guarantee or prolong the shelf life of the finished pharmaceutical formulation,<br>
flavourings, vitamins and/or other additives known in the art. The additives<br>
also include physiologically acceptable salts such as sodium chloride as<br>
isotonic agents.<br>
The preferred excipients include antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, for<br>
example, provided that it has not already been used to adjust the pH, vitamin<br>
A, vitamin E, tocopherols and similar vitamins and provitamins occurring in the<br>
human body.<br>
Preservatives may be used to protect the formulation from contamination with<br>
pathogens. Suitable preservatives are those which are known in the art,<br>
particularly cetyl pyridinium chloride, benzalkonium chloride or benzoic acid or<br>
benzoates such as sodium benzoate in the concentration known from the<br>
prior art. The preservatives mentioned above are preferably present in<br>
concentrations of up to 50mg/100ml, more preferably between 5 and<br>
20mg/100ml.<br>
Preferred formulations contain, in addition to the solvent water and the<br>
combination of active substances 1 and 2, only benzalkonium chloride and<br>
sodium edetate. In another preferred embodiment, no sodium edetate is<br>
present.<br>
The propellant-free inhalable solutions according to the invention are<br>
administered in particular using inhalers of the kind which are capable of<br>
nebulising a small amount of a liquid formulation in the required therapeutic<br>
dose within a few seconds to produce an aerosol suitable for therapeutic<br>
inhalation. Within the scope of the present invention, preferred nebulisers are<br>
those in which a quantity of less than 100uL, preferably less than SOuiL, more<br>
preferably between 20 and 3 0 L of active substance solution can be<br>
nebulised in preferably one spray action to form an aerosol with an average<br>
particle size of less than 2 , preferably less than 10|am, in such a way that<br>
the inhalable part of the aerosol corresponds to the therapeutically effective<br>
quantity.<br>
An apparatus of this kind for propellant-free delivery of a metered quantity of a<br>
liquid pharmaceutical composition for inhalation is described for example in<br>
International Patent Application WO 91/14468 and also in WO 97/12687 (cf. in<br>
particular Figures 6a and 6b). The nebulisers (devices) described therein are<br>
known by the name Respimat®.<br>
This nebuliser (Respimat®) can advantageously be used to produce the<br>
inhalable aerosols according to the invention containing the combination of<br>
active substances 1_and 2. Because of its cylindrical shape and handy size of<br>
less than 9 to 15 cm long and 2 to 4 cm wide, this device can be carried at all<br>
times by the patient. The nebuliser sprays a defined volume of<br>
pharmaceutical formulation using high pressures through small nozzles so as<br>
to produce inhalable aerosols.<br>
The preferred atomiser essentially consists of an upper housing part, a pump<br>
housing, a nozzle, a locking mechanism, a spring housing, a spring and a<br>
storage container, characterised by<br>
- a pump housing which is secured in the upper housing part and which<br>
comprises at one end a nozzle body with the nozzle or nozzle<br>
arrangement,<br>
- a hollow plunger with valve body,<br>
- a power takeoff flange in which the hollow plunger is secured and<br>
which is located in the upper housing part,<br>
- a locking mechanism situated in the upper housing part,<br>
- a spring housing with the spring contained therein, which is rotatably<br>
mounted on the upper housing part by means of a rotary bearing,<br>
- a lower housing part which is fitted onto the spring housing in the axial<br>
direction.<br>
The hollow plunger with valve body corresponds to a device disclosed in<br>
WO 97/12687. It projects partially into the cylinder of the pump housing and<br>
is axially movable within the cylinder. Reference is made in particular to<br>
Figures 1 to 4, especially Figure 3, and the relevant parts of the description.<br>
The hollow plunger with valve body exerts a pressure of 5 to 60 Mpa (about<br>
50 to 600 bar), preferably 10 to 60 Mpa (about 100 to 600 bar) on the fluid,<br>
the measured amount of active substance solution, at its high pressure end at<br>
the moment when the spring is actuated. Volumes of 10 to 50 microlitres are<br>
preferred, while volumes of 10 to 20 microlitres are particularly preferred and<br>
a volume of 15 microlitres per spray is most particularly preferred.<br>
The valve body is preferably mounted at the end of the hollow plunger facing<br>
the valve body.<br>
The nozzle in the nozzle body is preferably microstructured, i.e. produced by<br>
microtechnology. Microstructured valve bodies are disclosed for example in<br>
WO-94/07607; reference is hereby made to the contents of this specification,<br>
particularly Figure 1 therein and the associated description.<br>
The nozzle body consists for example of two sheets of glass and/or silicon<br>
firmly joined together, at least one of which has one or more microstructured<br>
channels which connect the nozzle inlet end to the nozzle outlet end. At the<br>
nozzle outlet end there is at least one round or non-round opening 2 to 10<br>
microns deep and 5 to 15 microns wide, the depth preferably being 4.5 to 6.5<br>
microns while the length is preferably 7 to 9 microns.<br>
In the case of a plurality of nozzle openings, preferably two, the directions of<br>
spraying of the nozzles in the nozzle body may extend parallel to one another<br>
or may be inclined relative to one another in the direction of the nozzle<br>
opening. In a nozzle body with at least two nozzle openings at the outlet end<br>
the directions of spraying may be at an angle of 20 to 160° to one another,<br>
preferably 60 to 150°, most preferably 80 to 100°. The nozzle openings are<br>
preferably arranged at a spacing of 10 to 200 microns, more preferably at a<br>
spacing of 10 to 100 microns, most preferably 30 to 70 microns. Spacings of<br>
50 microns are most preferred. The directions of spraying will therefore meet<br>
in the vicinity of the nozzle openings.<br>
The liquid pharmaceutical preparation strikes the nozzle body with an entry<br>
pressure of up to 600 bar, preferably 200 to 300 bar, and is atomised into an<br>
inhalable aerosol through the nozzle openings. The preferred particle or<br>
droplet sizes of the aerosol are up to 20 microns, preferably 3 to 10 microns.<br>
The locking mechanism contains a spring, preferably a cylindrical helical<br>
compression spring, as a store for the mechanical energy. The spring acts on<br>
the power takeoff flange as an actuating member the movement of which is<br>
determined by the position of a locking member. The travel of the power<br>
takeoff flange is precisely limited by an upper and lower stop. The spring is<br>
preferably biased, via a power step-up gear, e.g. a helical thrust gear, by an<br>
external torque which is produced when the upper housing part is rotated<br>
counter to the spring housing in the lower housing part. In this case, the<br>
upper housing part and the power takeoff flange have a single or multiple<br>
V-shaped gear.<br>
The locking member with engaging locking surfaces is arranged in a ring<br>
around the power takeoff flange. It consists, for example, of a ring of plastic<br>
or metal which is inherently radially elastically deformable. The ring is<br>
arranged in a plane at right angles to the atomiser axis. After the biasing of<br>
the spring, the locking surfaces of the locking member move into the path of<br>
the power takeoff flange and prevent the spring from relaxing. The locking<br>
member is actuated by means of a button. The actuating button is connected<br>
or coupled to the locking member. In order to actuate the locking mechanism,<br>
the actuating button is moved parallel to the annular plane, preferably into the<br>
atomiser; this causes the deformable ring to deform in the annular plane.<br>
Details of the construction of the locking mechanism are given in<br>
WO 97/20590.<br>
The lower housing part is pushed axially over the spring housing and covers<br>
the mounting, the drive of the spindle and the storage container for the fluid.<br>
When the atomiser is actuated the upper housing part is rotated relative to the<br>
lower housing part, the lower housing part taking the spring housing with it.<br>
The spring is thereby compressed and biased by means of the helical thrust<br>
gear and the locking mechanism engages automatically. The angle of<br>
rotation is preferably a whole-number fraction of 360 degrees, e.g. 180<br>
degrees. At the same time as the spring is biased, the power takeoff part in<br>
the upper housing part is moved along by a given distance, the hollow plunger<br>
is withdrawn inside the cylinder in the pump housing, as a result of which<br>
some of the fluid is sucked out of the storage container and into the high<br>
pressure chamber in front of the nozzle.<br>
If desired, a number of exchangeable storage containers which contain the<br>
fluid to be atomised may be pushed into the atomiser one after another and<br>
used in succession. The storage container contains the aqueous aerosol<br>
preparation according to the invention.<br>
The atomising process is initiated by pressing gently on the actuating button.<br>
As a result, the locking mechanism opens up the path for the power takeoff<br>
member. The biased spring pushes the plunger into the cylinder of the pump<br>
housing. The fluid leaves the nozzle of the atomiser in atomised form.<br>
Further details of construction are disclosed in PCT Applications<br>
WO 97/12683 and WO 97/20590,-to which reference is hereby made.<br>
The components of the atomiser (nebuliser) are made of a material which is<br>
suitable for its purpose. The housing of the atomiser and, if its operation<br>
permits, other parts as well, are preferably made of plastics, e.g. by injection<br>
moulding. For medicinal purposes, physiologically safe materials are used.<br>
Figures 2a/b attached to this patent application, which are identical to Figures<br>
6a/b of WO 97/12687, show the nebuliser (Respimat®) which can<br>
advantageously be used for inhaling the aqueous aerosol preparations<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2a shows a longitudinal section through the atomiser with the spring<br>
biased while Figure 2b shows a longitudinal section through the atomiser with<br>
the spring relaxed.<br>
The upper housing part (51) contains the pump housing (52) on the end of<br>
which is mounted the holder (53) for the atomiser nozzle. In the holder is the<br>
nozzle body (54) and a filter (55). The hollow plunger (57) fixed in the power<br>
takeoff flange (56) of the locking mechanism projects partially into the cylinder<br>
of the pump housing. At its end the hollow plunger carries the valve body<br>
(58). The hollow plunger is sealed off by means of the seal (59). Inside the<br>
upper housing part is the stop (60) on which the power takeoff flange abuts<br>
when the spring is relaxed. On the power takeoff flange is the stop (61) on<br>
which the power takeoff flange abuts when the spring is biased. After the<br>
biasing of the spring the locking member (62) moves between the stop (61)<br>
and a support (63) in the upper housing part. The actuating button (64) is<br>
connected to the locking member. The upper housing part ends in the<br>
mouthpiece (65) and is sealed off by means of the protective cover (66) which<br>
can be placed thereon.<br>
The spring housing (67) with compression spring (68) is rotatably mounted on<br>
the upper housing part by means of the snap-in lugs (69) and rotary bearing.<br>
The lower housing part (70) is pushed over the spring housing. Inside the<br>
spring housing is the exchangeable storage container (71) for the fluid (72)<br>
which is to be atomised. The storage container is sealed off by the stopper<br>
(73) through which the hollow plunger projects into the storage container and<br>
is immersed at its end in the fluid (supply of active substance solution).<br>
The spindle (74) for the mechanical counter is mounted in the covering of the<br>
spring housing. At the end of the spindle facing the upper housing part is the<br>
drive pinion (75). The slider (76) sits on the spindle.<br>
The nebuliser described above is suitable for nebulising the aerosol<br>
preparations according to the invention to produce an aerosol suitable for<br>
inhalation.<br>

described above (Respimat®) the quantity delivered should correspond to a<br>
defined quantity with a tolerance of not more than 25%, preferably 20% of this<br>
amount in at least 97%, preferably at least 98% of all operations of the inhaler<br>
(spray actuations). Preferably, between 5 and 30 mg of formulation, most<br>
preferably between 5 and 20 mg of formulation are delivered as a defined<br>
mass on each actuation.<br>
However, the formulation according to the invention may also be nebulised by<br>
means of inhalers other than those described above, e.g. jet stream inhalers.<br>
as described above combined with a device suitable for administering these formulations, preferably in conjunction with the Respimat®.

The propellant-free inhalable solutions or suspensions according to the invention may take the form of concentrates or sterile inhalable solutions or suspensions ready for use, as well as the above-mentioned solutions and suspensions designed for use in a Respimat®.  Formulations ready for use may be produced from the concentrates, for example, by the addition of isotonic saline solutions.  Sterile formulations ready for use may be administered using energy-operated fixed or portable nebulisers which produce inhalable aerosols by means of ultrasound or compressed air by the Venturi principle or other principles.<br>
Accordingly, in another aspect, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions in the form of propellant-free inhalable solutions or suspensions as described hereinbefore which take the form of concentrates or sterile formulations ready for use, combined with a device suitable for administering these solutions, characterised in that the device is an energy-operated free-standing or portable nebuliser which produces inhalable aerosols by means of ultrasound or compressed air by the Venturi principle or other methods.<br>

The Examples which follow serve to illustrate the present invention in more<br>
detail without restricting the scope of the invention to the following<br>
embodiments by way of example.<br>
Starting materials<br>
Tiotropium bromide:<br>
The tiotropium bromide used in the following formulation examples may be<br>
obtained as described in European Patent Application 418 716 A1.<br>
In order to prepare the inhalable powders according to the invention,<br>
crystalline tiotropium bromide monohydrate may also be used. This<br>
crystalline tiotropium bromide monohydrate may be obtained by the method<br>
described below.<br>
15.0 kg of tiotropium bromide are placed in 25.7 kg of water in a suitable<br>
reaction vessel. The mixture is heated to 80-90°C and stirred at constant<br>
temperature until a clear solution is formed. Activated charcoal (0.8 kg)<br>
moistened with water is suspended in 4.4 kg of water, this mixture is added to<br>
the solution containing the tiotropium bromide and the resulting mixture is<br>
rinsed with 4.3 kg of water. The mixture thus obtained is stirred for at least 15<br>
minutes at 80-90°C and then filtered through a heated filter into an apparatus<br>
preheated to an external temperature of 70°C. The filter is rinsed with 8.6 kg<br>
of water. The contents of the apparatus are cooled at 3-5°C for every 20<br>
minutes to a temperature of 20-25°C. The apparatus is cooled further to<br>
10-15°C using cold water and crystallisation is completed by stirring for at<br>
least another hour. The crystals are isolated using a suction filter dryer, the<br>
crystal slurry isolated is washed with 9 litres of cold water (10-15°C) and cold<br>
acetone (10-15°C). The crystals obtained are dried at 25°C in a nitrogen<br>
current over a period of 2 hours.<br>
Yield: 13.4 kg of tiotropium bromide monohydrate (86% of theory).<br>
The crystalline tiotropium bromide monohydrate thus obtained is micronised<br>
by known methods in order to prepare the active substance in the form of the<br>
average particle size corresponding to the specifications according to the<br>
