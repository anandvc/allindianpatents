FLASHLIGHT<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to a flashlight having a flexible jacket which is adapted to be pressed inwardly to activate a lamp, and in particular to such a flashlight wherein the jacket is selectively removable to allow the selective removal and replacement of the batteries which energize the lamp.<br>
Prior flashlights having a flexible jacket for activating the flashlight, such as disclosed in United States Patent No. 4,419,718, which is assigned to Press-A-Lite Corporation, the applicant herein, include batteries which are not selectively removable and replaceable. Other such flashlights include a housing having oppositely facing concave channels adapted to receive batteries. In such flashlights, it is difficult to retain both batteries in the opposing channels while assembling the flashlight for use as one or the other of the batteries tends to fall out of its channel during assembly. Other flashlights include a housing having oppositely facing channels wherein each channel includes resilient arms which extend around greater than one-half the circumference of the battery. The opposing resilient arms are spaced apart to allow a battery be snapped into or out of the channel. However, the installation and/or removal of a battery from the gripping engagement of the arms of the housing can be difficult, especially for people that may have arthritis or other conditions which effect the use of their hands.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A flashlight is provided which includes a housing extending between a first end and<br>
a second end. The housing includes a first generally semicircular cradle having a chamber<br>
with an open top adapted to removably receive a first battery having a first terminal and a<br>
second terminal. The housing also includes a second semicircular cradle having a chamber<br><br>
with an open lop adapted to removably receive a second battery having a first terminal and a second terminal. The first and second cradles are oriented in the same direction relative to one another such that the open tops of the first and second cradles face in generally the same direction relative to one another. The housing also includes a lamp chamber located at the first end of the housing. A lamp including a first terminal and a second terminal is located within the lamp chamber. An electrical switch provides selective electrical communication between the first and second batteries and the lamp. A resiliently flexible tubular jacket extends around the housing and covers the electrical switch and the first and second batteries. The jacket is adapted be pressed inwardly to close the electrical switch and thereby illuminate the lamp. The first and second cradles allow the easy insertion and removal of the batteries from the respective chambers of the cradles as the cradles do not grip the batteries. When the open tops of the cradles are oriented upwardly, the cradles retain the batteries during the assembly of the jacket over the housing and the installed batteries. The jacket is selectively retained in place over the switch and batteries by a cap which is selectively removably connected to the second end of the housing by a stem. The stem is rotatably attached to the second end of the housing and extends through an aperture in the cap.<br>

The arm 184 extends through the slot formed by the groove 42 in the second end wall 36 of the first cradle member 20 to electrically engage the second terminal 148 of the first battery 144. The tip 186 of the first conductor member 182 extends at an angle towards the second cradle 22.<br><br>
The switch 180 aJso includes a second electrical conductor member 190 which extends along the bottom of the second cradle 22 on the side of the housing 12 opposite the chamber 70 and battery 150, The second conductor member 190 includes an arm 192 extending outwardly therefrom at generally a right angle at one end and a tip 194 located at the opposite end of the conductor member 190. The second conductor member 190 also includes a bend or fulcrum 196 located between the arm 192 and the tip 194. The tip 194 of the second conductor member 190 is positioned to overlie the tip 186 of the first conductor member 182, but to be normally spaced apart from the tip 186. The second conductor member 190 is resiliently flexible along its length and is adapted to flexibly bend along its length between the fulcrum 196 and the tip 194 such that the tip 194 may be selectively pressed into electrical contact with the tip 186 of the first conductor member 182 and with the second terminal 148 of the first battery 144. The switch 180 is located on the opposite side of the housing 12 from the batteries 144 and 150 such that the switch 180 does not interfere with the removal or replacement of the batteries.<br>
The flashlight 10 also includes a flexible and resilient generally tubular jacket 200 having a first end 202 and a second end 204. The jacket 200 is generally elliptical in cross section but may be formed in other shapes as desired such as circular or rectangular. The jacket 200 is preferably formed from a flexible material such as plastic and is preferably clear. A liner (not shown), such as sheet of paper, may be inserted within the jacket 200 to line the interior surface of the wall of the jacket 200, The liner may include printed indicia or advertising as desired which is visible through the jacket 200 to users of the flashlight 10. The jacket 200 is removably located around the housing 12 with the first end 202 in abutting engagement with the ridge 132 of the end cap 124. The end cap 124 substantially encloses the first end 202 of the jacket 200 and the ridge 132 prevents movement of the jacket 200<br><br>
beyond the end cap 124. The jacket 200 extends around the housWg 1*2 and extends over and encloses the switch 180 and batteries 144 and 150, and retains the batteries 144 and 150 in their respective cradles 20 and 22. When the first end 202 of the jacket 200 abuts the end cap 124, the second end 204 of the jacket 200 is located at the second end 16 of the housing<br>
12.<br>
A cap 208 is adapted to substantially enclose the second end 204 of the jacket 200. The cap 208 includes a wall 210 having a centrally located circular aperture 212, and a generally elliptical side wall 214 extending outwardly from the wall 210. The cap 208 is adapted to fit over the second end 16 of the housing 12 and the second end 204 of the jacket 200 such that the jacket 200 fits closely within the side wall 214. The cylindrical body 110 of the stem 100 extends through the aperture 212 in the cap 208 and is selectively rotatable within the aperture 212. A locking member 216, such as a split-ring key ring, chain, lanyard or other device is selectively attached to the stem 100 by inserting it through the bore 118. When the locking member 216 is attached to the stem 100, the locking member 216 prevents the removal of the cap 208 from the housing 12 and similarly prevents the removal of the jacket 200 from the housing 12. The stem 100 permits the locking member 216 to rotate with respect to the housing 12 and jacket 200 to prevent breakage of the stem 100,<br>
In operation, the bulb 142 of the lamp 136 is illuminated by pressing the jacket 200 inwardly towards the bottom of the cradles 20 and 22 and thereby resiliently bending the second conductor member 190 such that the tip 194 electrically engages the tip 186 of the first conductor member 182 and the second terminal 148 of the first battery 144, thereby completing a circuit between the batteries 144 and 150 and the lamp 136. When the pressure on the jacket 200 is released, the jacket 200 resiliently returns to its original unflexed orientation and the tip 194 of the second conductor member 190 resiliently flexes away from<br><br>
the first conductor member 182 to break or open the electrical connection between the second conductor member 190 and the first battery 144.<br>
When one or both of the batteries 144 or 150 require replacement, the locking member 216 is removed from the stem 100. The cap 208 is then slid along a longitudinal axis 218 to remove the cap 208 from the second end 204 of the jacket 200. The jacket 200 may then be slid along the axis 218 to remove the jacket 200 from the housing 12. When the jacket 200 is removed from the housing 12, the housing 12 is positioned such that the cradles 20 and 22 are open in a vertically upward orientation such that' the batteries 144 and 150 remain seated within the cradles 20 and 22 after the jacket 200 is removed. Once the jacket 200 is removed, the batteries 144 and/or 150 may be selectively removed from the cradles and replaced with fresh batteries. The lamp 136 may also be replaced if desired. The cradles 20 and 22 do not grip the batteries 144 or 150 and allow easy removal and replacement of the batteries.<br>
Once the new batteries have been inserted within the cradles 20 and 22, the second end 16 of the housing 12 is inserted within the first end 202 of the jacket 200 and the jacket 200 is slid along the housing 12 until the first end 202 engages the ridge 132 of the end cap 124. The cap 208 is then placed over the second end 204 of the jacket 200 such that the stem 100 extends through the aperture 212 in the cap 208. The locking member 216 is then attached to the stem 100 which thereby holds the cap 208 and jacket 200 in position with respect to the housing 12.<br>
