				<td>Method for a high temperature short-time distillation of residual oil<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a method for high temperature short-time distillation of a<br>
residual oil originating from the processing of crude petroleum, natural bitumen or oil<br>
sand, wherein in a mixing apparatus the residual oil is mixed with granular hot coke as<br>
heat transfer medium, is converted into oil vapour, gas and coke, and gases and<br>
vapours are evacuated from the mixing apparatus while being substantially separated<br>
from the granular coke, gases and vapours are cooled down and a product oil in form of<br>
condensate as well as gas is produced and wherein the coke, which has been<br>
evacuated from the mixing apparatus, is heated again and returned into the mixing<br>
apparatus as a heat transfer medium.<br>
Methods of this type are described in DE-C-19724074 as well as in DE-A-19959587.<br>
These methods are characterized in that the produced product oil contains pollutants,<br>
such as heavy metals (nickel, vanadium), Conradson carbon residue (CCR) as well as<br>
asphaltenes in comparison to the used residual oil only in a highly reduced<br>
concentration. This is highly advantageous for a subsequent catalytic conversion of the<br>
product oil fraction, the boiling point of which is higher than about 360°C, to benzine and<br>
gas oil in a Fluidized Catalytic Cracker (FCC). However, if the catalytic conversion of<br>
these heavy product oil fractions shall take place in a hydrocracker, the contents of<br>
pollutants of the catalyst have to be further reduced because of the higher requirements<br>
thereof.<br>
According to experience, the remaining pollutants are concentrated in the highest<br>
boiling fraction of the product oil. Thus, a reduction of the pollutants can be principally<br>
achieved by a subsequent vacuum distillation of the product oil, that boils above 360°C,<br>
in which a pollutant bearing vacuum residue (VR) and an almost pollutant free vacuum<br>
gas oil (VGO) are obtained. A disadvantage of this method is that a vacuum distillation<br>
requires a high technical effort and can only be carried out up to certain overlapping<br>
boiling temperatures of VGO and VR in the range comprised between about 500 and<br>
560°C. This leads to a big amount of pollutant bearing VR, which can be converted in<br>
the FCC installation but not in a hydrocracker.<br>
On the base of this state of the art, it is the object of the invention to improve the<br>
method for high temperature short-time distillation of residual oils, such that a residual<br>
fraction, which is as small as possible and in which the undesirable catalyst pollutants<br>
are mainly concentrated, can be obtained from the product oil in a technically simple<br>
way.<br>
According to the invention this aim is achieved in that a highly pollutant bearing residual<br>
fraction of the vapour product oil from the mixing apparatus is mixed with water vapour<br>
or gas in order to reduce the partial pressure and is then condensed at temperatures<br>
beneath 450°C)in a column and is extracted while being separated from the other<br>
product oil. Afterwards, the non condensed product oil vapours from the column can be<br>
introduced into a fractionating column, in which the remaining product oil, that has a low<br>
content of pollutants, is decomposed into a VGO and a benzine/gas oil fraction (e.g.<br>
gasoline/gas oil fraction).<br>
The invention makes use of the fact that all of the product oil is in a vapour state at the<br>
exit of the mixing apparatus and can be decomposed into the desired fractions by a<br>
fractionating condensation. For reducing the portion of highly pollutant bearing VR, the<br>
overlapping boiling range of VGO and VR has to be fixed as high as possible in a range<br>
comprised between 450°C and 650°C, such that the separated VR fraction contains<br>
more than 60% of the Conradson carbon residue (CCR), which is still contained in the<br>
product oil vapours, more than 70% of the heavy metals nickel (Ni) and vanadium (V),<br>
which are still contained the product oil vapours, as well as more than 80% of the<br>
asphaltenes, which are still contained in the product oil vapours.<br>
Since condensed oil fractions would quickly decompose or coke at temperatures above<br>
450°C, the partial pressure of the oil fractions to be separated is reduced by introducing<br>
water vapour or gas into the column, such that a heavy condensate having an initial<br>
boiling point above 450°C condenses there at temperatures beneath 450°C. The<br>
condensation of VGO having a low content of pollutants (initial boiling point of about<br>
360°C; final boiling point of 450 to 650°C) and the benzine/gas oil fraction (boiling range<br>
of C5 up to about 360°C) can then be carried out in a second condensation stage at<br>
correspondingly lower temperatures. The thus obtained VGO having a low content of<br>
pollutants can then be catalytically converted into benzine and gas oil in a hydrocracker<br>
and the heavy condensate can either be returned, into the mixing reactor or be<br>
differently used, for example as heavy fuel oil.<br>
Possible realizations of the method are exemplarily described by means of the accompanying drawing.<br>
Herein:<br>
Fig. 1 is a flow chart of the method.<br>
In Fig. 1 a heat transfer medium coke having a temperature comprised between 500<br>
and 700°C is introduced from collecting bin (2) via pipe (3) into a mixing reactor (1).<br>
Simultaneously, residual oil having a temperature comprised between 100 and 400°C is<br>
introduced via pipe (4) into the mixing reactor (1). During mixing, a conversion<br>
temperature of the mixture comprised between 450 and 600oC is reached. The heat<br>
transfer medium coke in the mixing reactor (1) usually has a grain size in the order of<br>
0.1 to 4 mm, such that an extensive separation of the coke from the gases and oil<br>
vapours generated in the mixing apparatus takes place at the exit of the mixing<br>
apparatus.<br>
The mixing apparatus (1) comprises at least two intermeshing screws, which rotate in<br>
the same direction. The screws are of the type of a feed screw and have coiled<br>
conveyor paddles.<br>
The hot, substantially oil free, granular coke leaves the mixing reactor (1) at the mixing<br>
apparatus exit with a temperature comprised between 450 and 600°C and falls through<br>
a channel (7) into a post-degasifying bin (8), into the lower part of which a strip gas (9)<br>
can be introduced. Residual gases and vapours can escape upwards from the post-<br>
degasifying bin (8) through channel (7). Excess coke is extracted via pipe (2a), wherein<br>
a part of the coke can also be extracted via pipes (12a). The coke from pipe (12) runs<br>
over a pneumatic conveyor (10), which is provided with combustion air via pipe (5) and<br>
with fuel via pipe (6), into the collecting bin (2). During the upwards conveyance by<br>
means of the pneumatic conveyor (10) a part of the coke and/or the introduced fuel is<br>
simultaneously burned. The coke, which has been heated in the pneumatic conveyor<br>
(10), reaches the collecting bin (2), from which exhaust gas is evacuated via pipe (11).<br>
The coke in the collecting bin (2) has temperatures comprised between 500 and 700°C.<br>
The gaseous and vapourous products of the mixing reactor (1) are introduced via pipe<br>
(13) into a cyclone (14). Here, a separation of the fine, coke particles takes place, which<br>
run via pipe (15) into the post-degasifying bin (8).<br>
The gaseous and vapourous products flow from cyclone (14) through pipe (16) into a<br>
column (17), where they are quenched and thus cooled down from 450 through 600°C<br>
to 350 through 450°C.<br>
Returned C4 product gas from vessel (23) or water vapour is introduced via pipe (24a)<br>
into the head of column (17). This reduces the partial pressure of the vapour product oil<br>
to such an extend that a heavy oil fraction having an initial boiling point between 450<br>
and 650°C, in which nearly all pollutants are concentrated, condenses there at 350 -<br>
450°C. Decomposition or coking of the condensed oil is thus prevented. The column is<br>
preferably a quench cooler with a downstream multi-venturi washer, in which the gases<br>
and vapours originating from the mixing reactor (1) are very efficiently cooled in a<br>
parallel flow and residual breeze is washed out with its own condensate. But other<br>
apparatuses can also be used for this purpose.<br>
For reducing the portion of heavy oil having a high content of pollutants, the overlapping<br>
boiling range of VGO and VR is set at a temperature as high as possible and comprised<br>
between 450 and 650°C. This is achieved by introducing gas or water vapour into the<br>
head of column (17) via pipe (24a) and by cooling the gases and vapours by means of<br>
cooled heavy oil condensate from pipe (27a). The heavy oil condensate having a<br>
temperature comprised between 350 and 450°C is extracted from the basin of column<br>
(17) via pipe (27), cooled down to the required temperature in a heat exchanger (25)<br>
and partially returned as cooling/washing medium to the head of column (17). The other<br>
part of the heavy oil condensate is extracted as product via pipe (27b). The heavy oil<br>
condensate from pipe (27b) can afterwards either be returned to the mixing reactor (1)<br>
or be differently used, for example as heavy heating oil.<br>
The non condensed gas/oil vapour mixture is extracted from the lower part of column<br>
(17) via pipe (18). According to another realization of the invention, it can be introduced<br>
into a fractionating column (19). There, the remaining product oil is separated into VGO<br>
having a low content of pollutants and a pollutant free benzine/gas oil fraction. The VGO<br>
having a final boiling point of 450 - 650°C is extracted via pipe (21) from the bottom of<br>
the fractionating column (19). The thus obtained VGO can afterwards be catalytically<br>
converted into benzine and gas oil in a non represented hydrocracker. The remaining<br>
gas/oil vapour mixture from the head of the fractionating column (19) is cooled in<br>
condenser (22) via pipe (20) and separated in vessel (23) into a benzine/gas oil fraction<br>
having a boiling range of e.g. C5 - 360°C and a C4 gas. The benzine/gas oil fraction is<br>
extracted via pipe (26) and partially returned to the head of the fractionating column (19)<br>
via pipe (26b). The remaining benzine/gas oil mixture is evacuated as product via pipe<br>
(26a).<br>
Non condensed C4 gas is evacuated upwards from vessel (23) via pipe (24) and partly<br>
returned into column (17) via pipe (24a) and partly extracted as product via pipe (24b).<br>
Example<br>
100 t/h residual oil having a temperature of 300°C are introduced into the mixing reactor<br>
(1) via pipe (4). 75 t/h gas/oil vapour mixture having a temperature of 550°C are<br>
introduced from mixing reactor (1) via pipe (13) into a cyclone (14) for dedusting. The<br>
remaining 25 t/h coke, together with heat transfer medium coke, are introduced via pipe<br>
(7) into the post-degasifying bin (8).<br>
The gas/oil vapour mixture is routed from cyclone (14) via pipe (16) into a column (17),<br>
where it is diluted with gas and cooled down from 550°C to 425°C. For this, column (17)<br>
is provided with 43 t/h C4 gas from pipe (24a) and 55 t/h cooled heavy oil condensate<br>
having a temperature of 380°C from pipe (27a).<br>
65 t/h heavy oil condensate having an initial boiling point of 600°C are extracted via<br>
pipe (27) from the bottom of column (17) and cooled down from 425°C to 380cC in a<br>
heat exchanger (25). Afterwards, 55 t/h cooled heavy oil condensate are returned to the<br>
head of column (17) via pipe (27a) and 10 t/h are extracted as product via pipe (27b).<br>
108 t/h non condensed gas/oil vapour mixture are introduced from the lower part of<br>
column (17) via pipe (18) into a fractionating column (19). 40 t/h VGO having a low<br>
content of pollutants and a temperature of 350°C are extracted from the bottom of the<br>
fractionating column (19) via pipe (21). The remaining .68 t/h gas/oil vapour mixture are<br>
extracted from the head of the fractionating column (19) via pipe (20), cooled down to<br>
43°C in a condenser (22), introduced into vessel (23) and separated there into a liquid<br>
benzine/gas oil fraction having a boiling range of C5 - 360°C and a C4 gas. 53 t/h C4<br>
gas are extracted via pipe (24) and 43 t/h thereof are returned into the head of column<br>
(17) via pipe (24a). The remaining 10 t/h C4 gas are extracted as product via pipe (24b).<br>
Furthermore, 15 t/h benzine/gas oil mixture are extracted as product via pipe (26a).<br>
In a single-stage condensation according to the state of the art, one would obtain 50 t/h<br>
residue having an initial boiling point of 360°C instead of 10 t/h heavy oil condensate<br>
having an initial boiling point of 600°C. Even with an extensive vacuum distillation, one<br>
could only obtain 20 t/h VGO having a low content of pollutants and a boiling range<br>
comprised between 360 and 510°C from the residue according to the state of the art.<br>
However, according to this invention, 40 t/h VGO having a low content of pollutants and<br>
a boiling range comprised between 360 and 600°C, i.e. the double quantity, can be<br>
obtained in a technically simpler manner.<br>
