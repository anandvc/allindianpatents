TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a mobile communication system, and more<br>
particularly, to a communication method using a relay station (RS) in a mobile<br>
communication system.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
FIG. 1 is an explanatory view illustrating a mesh mode communication network.<br>
In general, communication can be performed in a broadband wireless access system by<br>
using a mesh mode shown in FIG. 1 as well as a point-to-multipoint (hereinafter, referred to<br>
as "PMP") mode. The mesh mode allows access to a base station through relay of another<br>
subscriber group in order to actively adapt to the metropolitan indirect wave communication<br>
environment where a shadow area exists due to large-scaled buildings.<br>
In the mesh mode, a control sub-frame and a data sub-frame are used instead of<br>
existing frames. The control sub-frame comprises a network control sub-frame and a<br>
schedule control sub-frame to perform two basic functions. In other words, the network<br>
control sub-frame serves to make a connection between different systems and maintain such<br>
a connection while the schedule control sub-frame serves to perform equivalent scheduling<br>
in data transmission between systems. All the frames other than the network control sub-<br>
frame generated periodically are schedule control sub-frames, wherein the length of the control sub-frame is represented by a fixed MSH-CTRL-LEN (network descriptor). The<br>
network descriptor which is accompanied with network configuration after network entry<br>
allocation during the network control and schedule control sub-frames and indicates<br><br>
distributed scheduling during the schedule control sub-frame is generated within a control<br>
frame.<br>
Since IEEE 802.16a standard which is one example of the broadband wireless<br>
access system considers indirect wave communication in a band of 2-11 GHz, multi-path<br>
fading may seriously occur. In this respect, in order to ensure reliability, an automatic<br>
retransmission request (ARQ) scheme is adapted to a medium access control (MAC) layer.<br>
 Also, an advanced antenna system (AAS) is considered to improve coverage of a cell and<br>
system capacity through beam forming based on multi-antenna. A dynamic frequency<br>
selection (DFS) function is supported to solve a problem relating to a co-existence with<br>
other system in an unlicensed band.<br>
In general, a point-to-multipoint (PMP) mode considered in a broadband<br>
wireless metropolitan area network (MAN) and a mesh mode can selectively be supported.<br>
The mesh mode allows access to a base station through relay of another subscriber group,<br>
and is considered for the metropolitan indirect wave communication environment where a<br>
shadow area exists due to large-scaled buildings.<br>
FIG. 2 is an explanatory view illustrating a mesh mode frame structure. As<br>
shown in FIG. 2, the mesh mode includes a control sub-frame and a data sub-frame instead<br>
of existing frames. The control sub-frame is classified into a network control sub-frame and<br>
a schedule control sub-frame to perform two basic functions. In other words, the network<br>
control sub-frame serves to make a connection between different systems and maintain such<br>
a connection while the schedule control sub-frame serves to perform equivalent scheduling<br>
in data transmission between systems. All the frames other than the network control sub-<br>
frame generated periodically are schedule control sub-frames. A network descriptor, which<br>
constitutes a mesh mode network after network entry allocation during the network control<br>
. sub-frame and performs distributed scheduling during the schedule control sub-frame,<br><br>
generates schedule control frames. The network descriptor means a central- mobile<br>
subscriber station that can perform a similar function to that of a base station in the mesh<br>
mode.<br>
FIG. 3 is an explanatory view illustrating a concept of a. sub-channel in an<br>
OFDMA physical layer. Properties of the OFDMA physical layer in a broadband wireless<br>
access system will be described with reference to FIG. 3. The OFDMA physical layer divides active carriers_into_groups and transmits the groups to their respective receiver<br>
mobile subscriber stations. The groups of the earners transmitted to the receiver mobile<br>
subscriber stations are referred to as sub-channels. In this case, the carriers constituting the<br>
respective sub-channels may be adjacent to one another or may be spaced apart from one<br>
another at constant intervals. If multiple access is made for the unit of sub-channel,<br>
frequency diversity gain and power concentration gain can be obtained, and forward power<br>
control can efficiently be performed.<br>
FIG. 4 is an explanatory view illustrating a resource allocation technique in an<br>
OFDMA system. Referring to FIG. 4, slots allocated to respective mobile subscriber<br>
stations are defined by a two-dimensional data region, and are a set of successive sub-<br>
channels allocated by a burst. As shown in FIG. 4, a data region in OFDMA is schematized<br>
by a rectangle determined by two-dimensional combination of a time domain and a<br>
frequency (sub-channel) domain. The data region may be allocated to a mobile subscriber<br>
station for uplink data transmission, and downlink data can be transmitted to a mobile<br>
subscriber station through the data region. To define such a data region in a two-<br>
dimensional space, the number of OFDM symbols in the time domain and the number of<br>
successive sub-channels in a frequency domain are required, wherein the successive sub-<br>
channels start from a position spaced apart by offset from a reference point.<br><br>
FIGs. 5A and 5B are explanatory views illustrating a sub-channel mapping<br>
method in uplink and downlink frames. The allocated sub-channel regions are represented<br>
by two-dimensions, and data are mapped from the sub-channel of the first symbol for the<br>
- allocated two-dimensional sub-channel, region. In case of the uplink, the allocation region of<br>
the allocated sub-channels are first determined by one-dimension. In other words, duration<br>
is determined, and the sub-channels are allocated along a symbol axis from the next of the<br>
sub-channel previously allocated to a protocol data unit (PDU) burst.In this case,if it<br>
reaches the last symbol of the specific sub-channel domain, it continues to allocate the sub-<br>
channels from the next sub-channel.<br>
FIG. 6 is an explanatory view illustrating a frame structure of a communication<br>
system using OFDMA. As shown in FIG. 6, one frame includes a downlink (DL) frame and<br>
an uplink (UL) frame. The first symbol per frame is used as a preamble, and a mobile<br>
subscriber station (MSS) acquires a base station (BS) using the preamble. A downlink map<br>
(DL-MAP) and an uplink map (UL-MAP) are medium access control (MAC) messages<br>
having information as to how a channel resource is allocated to the uplink and downlink.<br>
Also, a downlink channel descriptor (DCD) and an uplink channel descriptor (UCD) are<br>
MAC messages indicating physical properties (for example, modulation mode and coding<br>
mode) of downlink and uplink channels. The mobile subscriber station and the base station<br>
transmit and receive data for the unit of burst using the allocated radio resource in<br>
accordance with the uplink map and the downlink map.<br>
FIG. 7 is an explanatory view illustrating a burst allocation scheme. Referring to<br>
FIG. 7, two-dimensional blocks for time axis and frequency axis are allocated for a burst in<br>
the downlink. In other words, the downlink map includes a start symbol number, a start sub-<br>
channel number, the number of used symbols, and the number of used sub-channels.<br>
Accordingly, it is noted from the downlink map how the radio resource has been allocated<br><br>
on the frame. Meanwhile, in case of the downlink, the radio resources are sequentially<br>
allocated in accordance with a symbol axis corresponding to the first sub-channel and then<br>
the radio resources corresponding to the next sub-channel in accordance with, the symbol<br>
axis are allocated. Accordingly, the uplink map can identify the. allocated radio resources<br>
through the number of the allocated symbols.<br>
FIG. 8 is a flow chart illustrating network access procedures of a mobile<br>
subscriber station in a PMP mode. Referring to FIG. 8, if the power is turned on, the mobile<br>
subscriber station scans downlink channels and acquires up/down synchronization with the<br>
base station (S41). The mobile subscriber station performs ranging with the base station to<br>
adjust an uplink transmission parameter, and is assigned with a basic management<br>
connection identifier (CID) and a primary management CID from the base station (S42).<br>
The mobile subscriber station performs negotiation with the base station regarding basic<br>
performance (S43), and performs authentication procedure (S44). If the mobile subscriber<br>
station is registered in the base station, the mobile subscriber station managed by IP is<br>
assigned with a secondary management CID from the base station to set IP connection<br>
(S45). The mobile subscriber station sets the current date and time (S46), downloads its<br>
configuration file from a server (S47), and establishes service connection (S48),<br>
FIG. 9 is a flow chart illustrating a ranging procedure. Referring to FIG. 9, the<br>
base station transmits initial ranging information element (IE) having a broadcasting CID by<br>
using the downlink map (UL-MAP) message (S51). The mobile subscriber station transmits<br>
ranging packets by using a ranging request message (RNG-REQ) in a connection mode<br><br>
. state (S52),.In the case that the base station receives the ranging packets that cannot be<br>
decoded, the base station transmits a ranging response message (RNG-RSP) including a<br>
frame number and retry frame information to the mobile subscriber station (S53), If the<br>
mobile subscriber station receives the frame number and the retry frame information, the<br><br>
mobile subscriber station adjusts parameters and transmits the ranging request message<br>
(RNG-REQ) on the basis of the retry frame information (S54). If the base station receives<br>
the ranging packets that can be decoded, the base station transmits a ranging" response message (RNG-RSP) including basic management CID (S55). If the.mobile subscriber<br>
station receives the ranging request message including its MAC address, the mobile<br>
subscriber station stores the basic management CID and adjusts other parameters. The base<br>
station transmits an initial ranging_information element to the mobile subscriber station by<br>
using the basic CID of the uplink map message (S56). The base station recognizes its basic<br>
CID from the uplink map message, and transmits the ranging request message in response<br>
to initial ranging opportunity poll (S57). The base station transmits the ranging response<br>
message in response to the ranging request message (S58). The mobile subscriber station<br>
which has received the ranging response message adjusts local parameters.<br>
The downlink map (DL-MAP) message defines usage allocated per burst for a<br>
downlink duration in a burst mode physical layer while the uplink map (UL-MAP) message<br>
defines usage of the burst allocated for an uplink duration.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The information element constituting DL-MAP includes downlink interval usage<br>
code (DRJC), a connection ID (CID), and a burst position information (sub-channel offset, a<br>
symbol offset, the number of sub-channels, and the number of symbols), A downlink traffic<br>
duration corresponding to each mobile subscriber station is divided by the information<br>
element. Meanwhile, the information element constituting UL-MAP message defines usage<br>
per CID by using uplink interval usage code (UIUC) and determines the position of a<br>
corresponding duration by using a 'duration' field. In this case, usage per duration is<br>
determined by a UIUC value used in the UL-MAP, wherein each of duration starts from a<br>
point far away from a previous IE start point by 'duration' determined by the UL-MAP IE.<br><br><br><br><br>
The uplink duration defined by UIUC 12 is allocated for initial ranging,<br>
handover ranging, periodical ranging or band request, and has a competition-based<br>
characteristic.<br>
As shown in Table 4, the information element constituting the UL-MAP<br>
message defines usage per CID by using the uplink interval usage code (UIUC) and<br>
determines the position of a corresponding duration by using a 'duration' field. In this case,<br>
usage per duration is determined by a UIUC value used in the UL-MAP, wherein each of<br><br>
duration starts from a point far away from a previous IE start point by 'duration" determined<br>
by the UL-MAP IE.<br>
For a mobile communication system including a broadband wireless access<br>
system, a relay station has been suggested to improve throughput or eliminate a shadow<br>
area, wherein the relay station serves to relay signals between the base station and the<br>
mobile subscriber station (MSS). In other words, the relay station serves to transmit the<br>
signals from the base jstation to the mobile subscriber station in case of the downlink while.	<br>
the relay station serves to transmit the signals from the mobile subscriber station to the base<br>
station in case of the uplink. The relay station may be fixed to a specific area or may be<br>
used as a semi-fixed type. Also, the relay station may be used as a mobile type by being<br>
installed in a public transportation means..<br>
The relay station can be used for enlargement of service coverage of the base<br>
station and improvement of throughput. The operation of the relay station can depend on its<br>
usage.<br>
In the case that the relay station is used for enlargement of service coverage of<br>
the base station (Type 1), the relay station relays all the control messages, which are<br>
transmitted from the base station or a mobile subscriber station, as well as data transmitted<br>
and received between the mobile subscriber station and the base station. In the case that the<br>
relay station is used for improvement of throughput (Type 2), the relay station relays user<br>
data only exchanged between the mobile subscriber station and the base station, and allows<br>
the mobile subscriber station and the base station to directly exchange a broadcasting type<br>
control message of the base station or an uplink control message of the mobile subscriber<br>
station with each other. The data relayed by the relay station may be delayed in comparison<br>
with the case where the mobile subscriber station and the base station directly exchange the<br>
data with each other. The relay station provides good signal quality to the mobile subscriber<br><br>
station where data are relayed, and relays the data to the corresponding mobile subscriber<br>
station by using a ...proper channel coding rate and a proper modulation mode, thereby<br>
improving total throughput.<br>
However, the mobile communication system provided with the relay station has.<br>
a problem in that the system fails to suggest how to perform scheduling and allocate a<br>
resource between the base.station and the relay station and between the relay station and the<br>
__mobile subscriber station. Also, in the OFDMA based mobile communication system,_if	<br>
relay communication is performed by the relay station, a problem relating to how to allocate<br>
a radio resource and how to transmit radio.resource allocation information occurs.<br>
In view of the technical aspect, the relay station can be divided into two types.<br>
First, the relay station simply amplifies (amplifies only the intensity of signal) a signal<br>
received from a transmitting mobile subscriber station and transmits the amplified signal to<br>
a receiving mobile subscriber station in an analog mode. In this case, since delay little<br>
occurs and the relay station has an amplification function only, it is advantageous in view of<br>
cost efficiency. However, a problem occurs in that noise may be amplified when the signal<br>
is amplified. Second, the relay station decodes the signal received from the transmitting<br>
mobile subscriber station and then encodes the decoded signal to transmit the encoded<br>
signal to the receiving mobile subscriber station. In this case, noise can be removed and<br>
high throughput can be obtained by a higher data rate coding mode. However, a problem<br>
still occurs in that delay may occur during decoding and encoding.<br>
In the frame structure of the aforementioned related art mobile communication<br>
system, the mobile subscriber station which receives service from the base station cannot<br>
recognize the exact start position of the downlink and uplink regions of the relay station<br>
with only information received from the relay station. Accordingly, the mobile subscriber<br>
station should synchronize with the relay station per frame, through RS-preamble. For<br><br>
example, if the position of the relay station region is changed by the base station, the mobile<br>
subscriber station has difficulty in recognizing the relay station region. Even though the<br>
mobile subscriber station recognizes the relay station region, error in transmission and<br>
. reception may occur between the mobile subscriber station and the base station as the<br>
mobile subscriber station incorrectly recognizes the relay station region.<br>

The relay station performs initialization, i.e., initial network entry, in the same<br>
manner as a mobile subscriber station when it first enters a cell of the base station. The base<br>
station determines whether to provide services to mobile subscriber stations subscribed to<br>

words, in the case that there exists a mobile subscriber station which performs relay through<br>
the relay station, the base station in advance allocates a resource for transmitting and<br>
_ receiving between the.relay. station and. the .mobile, subscriber station, to the corresponding	<br>
relay station so as to notify downlink/uplink map (DL/UL-MAP) information for the relay<br>
' station in a data burst mode of the relay station. The downlink/uplink map (DL/UL-MAP)<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The aforementioned advantages, objects, and features of the invention will<br>
become apparent through the appended drawings and the following description of the<br>
invention. Hereinafter, reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments<br>
of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Unlike an access pointer (AP) of a wireless LAN or a base station (BS) of a<br>
mobile communication system is connected with a cable backbone network, a relay station<br>
(RS) can communicate with a base station or a mobile subscriber station in a wireless mode.<br>
Also, unlike an amplifier which amplifies a received signal only, the relay station can<br>
amplify a received signal, decode the signal, and encode the decoded signal to transmit the<br>
signal to the mobile subscriber staTibn-or the base station during next frame.<br><br>
In the mobile communication system, the relay station can be used for various<br>
purposes. For example, the relay station may simply amplify the signal transmitted from the<br>
base station to re-transmit the amplified signal to the mobile subscriber station, or may<br>
,. decode the signal received from the base station and encode the decoded signal, to transmit<br>
the encoded signal to the mobile subscriber station. In the case that the relay station simply<br>
amplifies the signal and transmits the amplified signal, there is no delay time required to .<br>
..transmit .the...signal transmitted ..from the base station to the mobile subscriber station. In	<br>
other words, the signal can be transmitted within one frame. However, a problem occurs in<br>
that received noise may be amplified when the signal is amplified.<br>
	Meanwhile, in the case that the relay station transmits the signal transmitted<br>
from the base station to the mobile subscriber station after decoding the signal and then<br>
encoding the decoded signal, delay time equal to or greater than at lease one frame may be<br>
caused by decoding and encoding. However, as the relay station encodes the signal received<br>
from the base station and then transmits the encoded signal, better signal quality can be<br>
obtained.<br>
The relay station can use frequency bands as follows. The relay station may use<br>
a frequency band used by the base station and an independent frequency band. Also, the<br>
relay station may use some of the frequency band used by the base station. Moreover, the<br>
relay station may use the same frequency band as that of the base station, amplify a control<br>
signal or data received from the base station, and retransmit the amplified signal or data.<br>
Meanwhile, examples of the relay station include a fixed relay station, a nomadic relay<br>
station, and a mobile relay station.<br>
FIG. 10 is an explanatory view illustrating the operation of the relay station. As<br>
shown in FIG. 10, a third mobile subscriber station, a fourth mobile subscriber station, and a<br>
fifth mobile subscriber station are within the coverage of the base station, whereby the<br><br>
mobile subscriber stations can communicate with the base station. However, a first mobile<br>
subscriber station and a second subscriber station are out of the coverage of the base station.<br>
In this case, if the relay station does not relay the signal transmitted from the base station,<br>
the first mobile subscriber. station and the second subscriber station cannot receive the<br>
signal. Accordingly, the relay station relays the signal transmitted from the base station to<br>
communicate with mobile subscriber stations which are out of the coverage of the base<br>
station but within the coverage of the relay station. As a result, the mobile subscriber<br>
stations which are out of the coverage of the base station but within the coverage of the<br>
relay station can perform network entry through the relay station. As described above, the<br>
relay station can be used for enlargement of the coverage.<br>
Meanwhile, although the third mobile subscriber station, the fourth subscriber<br>
station, and the fifth mobile subscriber station can communicate with the base station<br>
because they are within the coverage of the base station, the relay station may relay signal<br>
transmission for the third, fourth and fifth mobile subscriber stations to enhance throughput.<br>
The mobile relay station can perform subscription to the base station and<br>
periodic ranging. The relay station manages a table of connection identifiers (CIDs) of<br>
mobile subscriber stations within its coverage, and transmits update information to the base<br>
station through periodic ranging if update of the table is required.<br>
In general, when the mobile relay station first enters a cell coverage of the base<br>
station, the mobile relay station performs an initiating step similarly to a network entry step<br>
of the mobile subscriber station. The relay station which has entered the network needs to<br>
identify CIDs of the mobile subscriber stations which perform communication through relay<br>
of the relay station. The base station determines whether to perform relay communication<br>
with the mobile subscriber stations subscribed to the base station through the relay station or<br>
to perform direct communication^ with the mobile subscriber stations.. If relay<br><br>
communication through the relay station is required, the base station transmits to the relay<br>
station CIDs of the mobile subscriber stations which should perform relay communication .<br>
through the relay station.<br>
Table 5 illustrates a CID table indicate message for allowing the base station to -<br>
transmit CIDs of the mobile subscriber stations which should perform relay communication<br>
through the relay station..<br><br>
FIG. 11 is a diagram illustrating a frame structure of the base station in the<br>
mobile communication system including the relay station. As shown in FIG. 11, the base<br>
station transmits a preamble 71 for synchronizing with the relay station (RS) during the nth<br>
frame, and also transmits a downlink map message 72 including a first information element<br>
72a and a second information element 72a. The first information element has burst<br>
allocation information corresponding to the specific relay station during the nth frame. In<br>
other words, the first information element has burst allocation information for transmitting<br>
data from the base station to the relay station. Meanwhile, the second information element<br>
has burst allocation information corresponding to the specific mobile subscriber station<br>
during the (n+l)th frame. In other words, the second information element has burst<br>
allocation information for transmitting data from the relay station to the. mobile subscriber<br>
station.<br>
Table 6 is an example illustrating the downlink map information element.<br><br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 6, one field (Co-operation configuration in this embodiment)<br>
of the information element is set to '0' or '1' so as to identify whether the information<br>
element represents the first information element or the second information element. In other.<br>
words, it is possible to identify whether to represent a burst allocated during the nth frame .<br>
or a burst allocated during the (n+l)th frame.<br>
At this time, a burst region 73 allocated to transmit data from the relay station to<br>
the mobile subscriber station does not perform signal transmission from the base station to<br>
the relay station. In other words, the region allocated by the second information element<br>
during the previous frame to transmit data from the relay station to the mobile subscriber<br>
station is not allocated for data transmission from the base station to the relay station during<br>
the same frame. This is to avoid collision caused as the burst region is repeatedly allocated<br>
for. data transmission of the base station and data transmission of the relay station.<br>
FIG. 12 is an explanatory view illustrating a frame structure of the relay station<br>
(RS) in the mobile communication system provided with the relay station (RS). As shown<br>
in FIG. 12, the relay station receives a preamble 81 for synchronizing with the relay station<br>
(RS) during the nth frame, and also receives a downlink map message 82 including a first<br>
information element 82a and a second information element 82a. The first information<br>
element has burst allocation information corresponding to the specific relay station during<br>
the nth frame. In other words, the first information element has burst allocation information<br>
for transmitting data from the base station to the relay station. Meanwhile, the second<br>
information element has burst allocation information corresponding to the specific mobile<br>
subscriber station during the (n+l)th frame. In other words, the second information element<br>
has burst allocation information for transmitting data from the relay station to the mobile<br>
subscriber station.<br><br>
The relay station identifies burst allocation information for data transmission<br>
from the base station to the relay station through the first information element, and receives<br>
relay data for the mobile subscriber station through the allocated burst region 83. Data<br>
-transmission from the base station to the relay station is performed during the nth frame,<br>
The relay station receives the data during the nth frame, decodes the received data, and<br>
encodes the decoded data.<br>
		. Meanwhile, the.relay. station can identify a burst xegion-8.4&gt;..whichJs.allocat.ed_to	<br>
transmit the data received during the nth frame, decoded and encoded, through the second<br>
information element. Accordingly, the relay station transmits the encoded data to the mobile<br>
. subscriber station by using the burst region 84 allocated through the second information	<br>
element. As a result, the burst region 83 allocated to transmit data from the relay station to<br>
the mobile subscriber station does not transmit any signal from the base station to the relay<br>
station, whereby collision can be avoided.<br>
As described above, if scheduling is performed in such a manner that the burst<br>
region for data transmission from the base station to the relay station is allocated during the<br>
nth frame while the burst region for data transmission from the relay station to the mobile<br>
subscriber station is allocated during the (n+l)th frame, the relay station can ensure the time<br>
for decoding and encoding the relay data received from the base station. Meanwhile,<br>
although one frame has been exemplarily described in the aforementioned embodiment as a<br>
delay time for decoding and encoding, data transmission may be performed with delay time<br>
more than two frames.<br>
FIGs. 13A to 13C are explanatory views illustrating a first example of a radio<br>
resource allocation method in the mobile communication system provided with the relay<br>
station (RS). In the first example, a method for allocating the radio resource corresponding<br>
. to.each mobile subscriber station from the base station will be described. . ...<br><br>
FIG. 13A is a frame schematic view illustrating radio resource allocation<br>
information transmission and a radio resource allocation method. FIG. 13A illustrates the<br>
operation of the base station in radio resource allocation and radio resource allocation<br>
information transmission...<br>
Referring to FIG. 13A, the base station transmits downlink radio resource<br>
(region on OFDMA map, hereinafter, referred to as "region") allocation information for<br>
_ transmitting datato the relay station, through a downlink map (PL-MAP) 91 during a T	<br>
frame. Also, the base station transmits downlink data to the relay station through a region<br>
92 allocated by the downlink map (DL-MAP). Meanwhile, the relay station receives the<br>
downlink data transmitted from the base station, and transmits the received data to the<br>
mobile subscriber station during a (T+l) frame. .<br>
To avoid collision (interference) and data transmission from, the relay station to<br>
the mobile subscriber station, of the downlink region during the (T+l) frame of the base<br>
station, a region 94 for transmitting data from the relay station to the mobile subscriber<br>
station is not allocated for any other usage. This region allocation information is<br>
transmitted to the relay station and the mobile subscriber station within the region through a<br>
downlink map 93 of the (T+l) frame. The control signal transmitted from the base station to<br>
the relay station during the T frame may be transmitted to the same frame. The control<br>
signal includes a preamble, a downlink map (DL-MAP), DCD, and UCD.<br>
FIG. 13B is a frame schematic view illustrating radio resource allocation<br>
information transmission and a radio resource allocation mode. FIG. 13B illustrates the<br>
operation of the base station in radio resource allocation and radio resource allocation<br>
information transmission.<br>
Referring to FIG. 13B, the relay station receives region allocation information<br>
for receiving downlink data .transmitted from the base station, through a downlink map (DL-<br><br>
MAP) 95 during the T frame. Also, the relay station receives the downlink data from the<br>
base station through a region 96 (corresponding to 92 of FIG. 13A) allocated by the<br>
downlink map (DL-MAP) 95. Meanwhile, the relay station receives the downlink data<br>
transmitted from the base station, and transmits the received data corresponding to each<br>
mobile subscriber station to each mobile subscriber station during the (T+"l) frame. As<br>
described above, the base station does not allocate regions 98a, 98b and 98c for any usage<br>
__Qther_ than. usage for ..transmitting _data corresponding to each mobile subscriber station.<br>
Accordingly, the relay station can transmit the downlink data corresponding to each mobile<br>
subscriber station through the allocated regions 98a, 98b and 98c (corresponding to 94 of<br>
FIG. 13A). _ _ _	. _ .		_<br>
The region information allocated to the mobile subscriber stations is transmitted<br>
to the relay station and each mobile subscriber station through a downlink map (DL-MAP) .<br>
91 (corresponding to 93 of FIG. 13A). In this case, region (98a, 98b and 98c) allocation to<br>
the mobile subscriber station is performed by the base station. Accordingly, the base station<br>
can allocate a region for transmitting data from the base station to the relay station and a<br>
region for transmitting data from the relay station to the mobile subscriber station every<br>
frame.<br>
Table 7 illustrates a downlink map information element including a mobile<br>
subscriber station where data transmission is relayed by the relay station and region<br>
allocation information of each mobile subscriber station.<br><br><br><br>
Region allocation information of the mobile subscriber station corresponding to<br>
each relay station can be transmitted to the relay station through a DL-MAP information<br>
element 97 (corresponding to 93 of FIG. 13 A) as shown in Table 7.<br>
FIG. 13C is a frame schematic view illustrating radio resource allocation<br>
information transmission and a radio resource allocation mode. FIG. 13C illustrates the<br>
operation of the mobile subscriber station in radio resource allocation and radio resource<br>
allocation information transmission. Referring to FIG. 13C, the first mobile subscriber<br>
station exemplarily receives data.<br>
The data transmitted from the base station during the T frame is transmitted to<br>
the mobile subscriber station through the relay station during the (T+l) frame. Accordingly,<br>
each mobile subscriber station can identify a region allocated to itself by receiving a<br>
downlink map 100 (corresponding to 93 of FIG. 13A and 97 of FIG. 13B) transmitted<br>
•during the (T+l) frame. As a result, as shown in FIG. 13C, the first mobile subscriber<br>
station allocated with the downlink region can receive the downlink data through the<br>
allocated region 81.<br>
FIGs. 14A to 14C are explanatory views illustrating a second example of a radio<br>
resource allocation method in a mobile communication system provided with a relay station<br><br>
(RS). In the second example, data corresponding to each mobile subscriber station are<br>
transmitted through sub-frames. A method for allocating a radio resource corresponding to<br>
each mobile subscriber station from the relay station in the sub-frames will be described.<br>

information transmission and a radio resource allocation method. FIG. 14A illustrates the<br>
operation of the base station in radio resource allocation and radio resource allocation<br>

Referring to FIG. 14A, the base station transmits downlink radio resource<br>
(region on OFDMA map, hereinafter, referred to as "region") allocation information for<br>
transmitting data to the relay station through a downlink map (DL-MAP) 103 during a T<br>
frame. Also, the base station transmits downlink data to the relay station through a region<br>
104 allocated by the downlink map (DL-MAP) 103. Meanwhile, the relay station receives<br>
the downlink data transmitted from the base station, and transmits the received data to the<br>
mobile subscriber station during a (T+1) frame.<br>
To avoid collision (interference) and data transmission from the relay station to<br>
the mobile subscriber station, of the downlink region of the (T+l) frame of the base station,<br>
a region 107 for transmitting data from the relay station to the mobile subscriber station is<br>
not allocated for any other usage. This region allocation information of the (T+l) frame is<br>
transmitted to the relay station and the mobile subscriber station within the region through a<br>
downlink map 106 of the (T+l) frame.<br>
FIG. 14B is a frame schematic view illustrating radio resource allocation<br>
information transmission and a radio resource allocation mode. FIG; 14B illustrates the<br>
operation of the relay station in radio resource allocation and radio resource allocation<br>
information transmission.<br><br>
.Referring to FIG. 14B, the relay station receives region allocation information<br>
for transmitting data to the relay station, through a downlink map (DL-MAP) 108 during the<br>
T frame. Also, the relay station receives downlink data from the base station through a<br>
region 109 allocated by the downlink map (DL-MAP) 108. Meanwhile, the relay station<br>
receives the downlink data transmitted from the base station, and transmits the received data<br>
corresponding to each mobile subscriber station during the (T+l) frame.<br>
.Atjhis time, in .order to. transmit the .receiveddownlink data to .eachjnpbile	<br>
subscriber station, the relay station can allocate regions 112b, 112c and 112d corresponding<br>
to each mobile subscriber station. In other words, the relay station can determine how to<br>
allocate regions 112a to 112d (corresponding to 107 of FIG. 14A) allocated from the base<br>
station to each mobile subscriber station during the (T+l) frame. In order to notify each<br>
mobile subscriber station of region information to be allocated to each mobile subscriber<br>
station, one 112a of the regions allocated from the base station can be used as a downlink<br>
map (DL-MAP) from the relay station to the mobile subscriber station. In other words, the<br>
relay station constitutes the region allocated from the base station as a single sub-frame to<br>
perform region allocation and region allocation information transmission to each mobile<br>
subscriber station.<br>
Meanwhile, the relay station can notify the base station of region allocation<br>
information to the mobile subscriber station. In other words, as shown in FIG. 14A and FIG.<br>
14B, the relay station can in advance notify the base station of downlink region allocation<br>
information to be used for sub-frames 112a to 112d belonging to the next frame ((T+l)<br>
frame), through an uplink region (corresponding to 105 of FIG. 14A and 110 of FIG. 14B)<br>
allocated to the relay station during the T frame. At this time, the relay station may notify<br>
the base station of the downlink allocation information by using a feedback header.<br><br>
FIG. 15 is a schematic view illustrating the feedback header. Table 8 illustrates<br>
feedback information for downlink allocation information report according to a feedback<br>
header format of FIG. 15.<br><br>
Meanwhile, the uplink region (corresponding to 105 of FIG. 14A and 110 of FIG.<br>
14B) allocated to the relay station for downlink allocation information report to the mobile<br>
subscriber station during the T frame is transmitted through a downlink map (DL-MAP)<br>
(corresponding to 102 of FIG. 14A and 113 of FIG. 14B). At this time, the uplink region<br>
allocation information may be transmitted through an information element<br>
(RS_Feedback_allocation_IE) included in the downlink map (DL-MAP).<br>
Table 9 illustrates an example of an information element<br>
(RS_Feedback_allocation_IE) having uplink region information allocated to the relay<br>
station for downlink allocation information report to the mobile subscriber, station.<br><br><br>
The relay station reports the downlink allocation information of the mobile<br>
subscriber station to the base station through the uplink region (corresponding to 105 of FIG.<br>
14A and 110 of FIG. 14B) allocated to the relay station as described above. At this time, the .<br>
downlink allocation information can be transmitted through the feedback header.<br>
As shown in FIG. 14B, the relay station reports the downlink allocation<br>
information of the mobile subscriber station to the base station by using the feedback header<br>
during the T frame, and transmits data to each mobile subscriber station through the sub-<br>
frame of the (T+l) frame. In other words, the relay station transmits the downlink region<br>
information allocated to each mobile subscriber station through the downlink map (DL-<br>
MAP) 112a. At this time, the downlink region is allocated considering the channel status of<br>
each mobile subscriber station. Meanwhile, the data can be transmitted by using DlUC<br>
more suitable for each mobile subscriber station.<br>
Table 10 illustrates an example of the downlink map (DL-MAP) of the sub-<br>
frame.<br><br><br>
FIG. 14C is a frame schematic view illustrating radio resource allocation<br>
information transmission and a radio resource' allocation mode. FIG. 14C illustrates the<br>
operation of the mobile subscriber station in radio resource allocation and radio resource<br>
i<br>
allocation information transmission. FIG. 14C illustrates an example of the first mobile<br>
subscriber station receiving data.<br>
The data transmitted from the base station during the T frame is transmitted to<br>
...the mobile subscriber station through the relay station during the (T+.l) frame._Acc.ordingly,	<br>
each mobile subscriber station can identify a downlink region allocated to itself by<br>
receiving a downlink map 116 (corresponding to 112a of FIG. 14B) of the sub-frame<br>
transmitted from the relay station during the (T+l) frame. As a result, as shown in FIG. 14C,	<br>
the first mobile subscriber station allocated with the downlink region can receive the<br>
downlink data through the allocated region 117.<br>
FIG. 16 is a schematic view illustrating a relay network according to the<br>
preferred embodiments of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 16, the base station BS<br>
communicates with two mobile subscriber stations MS 1 and MS 3 through a relay station<br>
RS 1 and communicates with the other mobile subscriber station MS 2 through a relay<br>
station RS 2. Although FIG. 16 illustrates the mobile subscriber stations which are out of a<br>
cell area managed by the base station, technical features of the present invention may be<br>
applied to mobile subscriber stations which are within the cell area of the base station and<br>
perform communication through the relay station.<br>
FIGs. 17A to. 17D are schematic views illustrating frames transmitted and<br>
received sequentially between the base station or the relay station and the mobile subscriber<br>
stations in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 17A illustrates a structure of an nth frame transmitted and received between<br>
the base station BS and the relay stations RS 1 and RS 2. It is apparent that the base station,<br><br>
the relay.stations, or other mobile subscriber stations communicating with the base station<br>
without through the relay station can transmit and receive data through the nth frame. In the<br>
OFEfM^of OFDMA communication system, the frame can be defined by a two-dimensional<br>
plane of a horizontal axis of a symbol (or time) and a vertical axis of a subchannel (or<br>
frequency). The whole frame is comprised of a downlink sub-frame (DL sub-frame) and an<br>
uplink sub-frame (UL sub-frame).<br>
	If communication is...performed between, the. base station and the mobile	<br>
subscriber station through the relay station, the frame should be assigned with a region for<br>
performing communication between the relay station and the mobile subscriber station. The<br>
region is defined as 'relay station region (or RS region)' herein. In FIG. 17A, a portion<br>
marked by 'RS DL' is a relay station downlink region, and a portion marked by 'RS UL' is •<br>
a relay station uplink region. The data transmitted from the base station to the relay station<br>
is allocated to the downlink of the frame in a burst mode while the data transmitted from the<br>
relay station to the mobile subscriber station is allocated to the relay station downlink region.<br>
In the case that the mobile subscriber station has data to be transmitted to the base station,<br>
the data are transmitted through the region allocated to the mobile subscriber station from<br>
the uplink region indicated by the uplink map (UL-MAP) of the relay station, and the relay<br>
station transmits the data received from the mobile subscriber station to the base station<br>
through the relay station uplink region (RS UL).<br>
The relay station downlink region includes a length of the relay station downlink<br>
and uplink map (RS DL/UL MAP), RS-FCH (frame controller header) including coding<br>
information, an RS-preamble region for synchronizing with the mobile subscriber station,<br>
relay station downlink and uplink map regions, and relay station downlink and uplink data<br>
burst regions. The RS-preamble may have different sequences per relay station. The map<br><br>
structure of the relay station region and burst allocation within the relay station region are<br>
determined by the base station.<br>
The base station includes identification information for identifying the relay<br>
station downlink region and the relay station uplink region within the frame, in the<br>
downlink map (DL-MAP), and transmits the information to the relay station and the mobile<br>
subscriber station, wherein the identification information may be included in the relay.<br>
-station downlink region information element .(RS. DL Zone..IE).and .the.relay_statipn_uplink_	<br>
region information element (RS UL.Zone IE).<br>
The base station transmits the relay station downlink map (DL-MAP)<br>
information and the relay station uplink map (UL-MAP) information to'each relay station. 	<br>
The relay station downlink map information and the relay station uplink map information<br>
include downlink and uplink map information for each mobile subscriber station in the relay<br>
station downlink and uplink regions. Also, the relay station downlink and uplink map<br>
information may include a frame number (for example, (n+l)th frame) which is to transmit<br>
data of the mobile subscriber station received from the base station, position information<br>
(for example, symbol and subchannel offset value based on the RS-preamble) of RS DL/UL<br>
MAP of each relay station, RS DL/UL MAP length, and FCH information including coding<br>
information. The downlink and uplink map information for each mobile subscriber station<br>
includes downlink data burst allocation information and uplink data burst allocation<br>
information, wherein the downlink data burst allows each relay station to transmit data to<br>
each mobile subscriber station and the uplink data burst allows each mobile subscriber<br>
station to transmit data to each relay station.<br>
The base station may include the relay station downlink and uplink map<br>
information in the downlink map (DL-MAP) region and the uplink map (UL-MAP) region<br>
aiong with the downlink and uplink map information allocated to the mobile subscriber<br><br>
station which directly-communicates with the base station without through the relay station.<br>
Each relay station includes the relay station uplink/downlink map information included in<br>
the downlink map region and the uplink map region in the relay station downlink map<br>
region (RS DL-MAP .Zone), and the relay station uplink map region (RS DL-MAP Zone) of<br>
the relay station downlink region or the relay station uplink region, and then transmits the<br>
map information to the mobile subscriber station. Each mobile subscriber station is<br>
allocated with the downlink data burst for receiving data from the relay station .and the __<br>
uplink data burst for transmitting data to the relay station in accordance with the relay<br>
station downlink/uplink map information included in the relay station downlink map region<br>
(RS DL-MAP Zone) and the relay station uplink map region (RS UL-MAP Zone). In this<br>
case, since each relay station should include downlink map information and uplink map<br>
information of other relay stations in the relay station downlink map region (RS DL-MAP<br>
Zone) and the relay station uplink map region (RS UL-MAP Zone), a problem occurs in that<br>
the radio resource is consumed.<br>
To solve the above problem, the base station can include the relay station<br>
downlink and uplink map information in the data burst allocated to each relay station and<br>
then can transmit the map information to each relay station. In other words, if there exist<br>
data to be transmitted to the mobile subscriber stations MS 1, MS 2, and MS 3 through the<br>
relay stations RS 1 and RS 2, the base station allocates the data burst of each relay station to<br>
the downlink data burst region and transmits the data through the allocated data burst. In<br>
FIG. 17A, a region 'A' represents a data burst including data to be transmitted from the base<br>
station to the mobile subscriber stations MS ) and MS 3 through the relay station RS 1 and<br>
is allocated to the relay station RS 1, and a region 'B' represents a data burst including data<br>
to be transmitted from the base station to the mobile subscriber station MS 2 through the<br>
relay station R.S 2 and is allocated to the relay station RS 2. At this time, the data bursts A<br><br>
and B respectively allocated to the relay stations RS 1 and RS 2 include the relay station<br>
downlink and uplink map (RSI DL/UL-MAP and RS2 DL/UL-MAP) information along<br>
with the data to be transmitted to the mobile subscriber stations. The base station designates<br>
the positions of the data bursts A and B allocated to the relay stations RS 1 and RS 2 and a<br>
frame number for transmitting data to the mobile subscriber station in the relay stations RS<br>
1 and RS 2 through the DL-MAP information element (IE) of the downlink map (DL-MAP)<br>
..region. ..<br>
The relay stations RS 1 and RS 2 identify the positions of the data bursts A and<br>
B allocated thereto through the DL-MAP information element, and transmit the relay station<br>
downlink region to the mobile subscriber station by using the relay station downlink and<br>
uplink map (RSI DL/UL-MAP and RS2 DL/UL-MAP) information included in their<br>
corresponding data bursts.<br>
FIG. 17B illustrates a structure of a frame ((n+l)th frame) designated by the base<br>
station to allow the relay station RS 1 to transmit the data to the mobile subscriber stations<br>
MS 1 and MS 3, i.e., a structure of the (n+l)th frame transmitted from the relay station RS 1<br>
to the mobile subscriber stations MS 1 and MS 3. Referring to FIG. 17B, the relay station<br>
RS 1 includes the relay station downlink and uplink map (RSI DL/UL-MAP) information<br>
in the RSI UL-MAP region and RSI DL-MAP region of the relay station downlink region,<br>
wherein the relay station downlink and uplink map (RSI DL/UL-MAP) information is<br>
included in the data burst A allocated from the base station to the relay station RS I. The<br>
relay station RS 1 includes data to be transmitted to respective mobile subscriber stations<br>
MS 1 and MS 3 in data bursts C and D for the respective mobile subscriber stations MS 1<br>
and MS 3 indicated by the relay station downlink and uplink map information and then<br>
transmits the data. Since the relay station downlink and uplink map (RSI DL/UL-MAP)<br>
information for each relay station is transmitted through the data bursts for each relay<br><br>
station, relay station downlink and uplink map (RSI DL/UL-MAP) information for other<br>
relay station is not included repeatedly in UL-MAP or DL-MAP region of the relay station.<br>
The mobile subscriber stations MS 1 and MS 3 synchronize with the relay station RS 1<br>
through the RS-preamble of the (n+l)th frame of FIG. 17B, identify the positions of the<br>
data bursts C and D allocated from the relay station downlink map (RSI DL-MAP)<br>
information included in the RSI UL-MAP region of.the relay.station downlink region, and<br>
.receive-the data					 	.	<br>
FIG. 17C illustrates a structure of the frame ((n+l)th frame) designated by the<br>
base station to allow the relay station RS 2 to transmit data to the mobile subscriber station<br>
MS 2. The relay station RS 2 includes relay station downlink and uplink map (RS2 DL/UL- -	<br>
MAP) information included in the data burst B allocated from the base station in RS2 UL-<br>
MAP region and RS2 DL-MAP region of the relay station downlink region, and includes<br>
the data to be transmitted to the mobile subscriber station MS 2 in a data burst E for the<br>
mobile subscriber station MS 2 indicated by the relay station downlink and uplink map<br>
information. The mobile subscriber station MS 2 synchronizes with the relay station RS 2<br>
through the RS-preamble of the (n+l)th frame of FIG. 17C, identifies the position of the<br>
data burst E allocated from the relay station downlink map (RS2 DL-MAP) information<br>
included in the RS2 UL-MAP region of the relay station downlink region, and receives the<br>
data. In FIG. 17C, a region 'F' represents an uplink data burst allocated to the mobile<br>
subscriber station MS 2.<br>
FIG. 17D illustrates a structure of a frame ((n+2)th frame) designated by the<br>
base station to allow the mobile subscriber station MS 2 to transmit data to the relay station<br>
RS 2. The relay station RS 2 transmits the data received from the mobile subscriber station<br>
MS 2 to the base station through an uplink data burst G for the relay station RS 2 indicated<br>
by theuplinkmap (UL-MAP) information.<br><br>
FIGs. 18A and 18B are schematic views illustrating a frame structure according<br>
to the preferred embodiments of the present invention. FIGs. 18A and 18B respectively<br>
illustrate the nth frame transmitted and received between the base station BS and the relay<br>
stations RS 1 and RS 2, and the (n+l)th frame transmitted from the relay station RS 1 to the ' "<br>
mobile subscriber stations MS 1 and MS 3..<br>
In the embodiment shown in FIG. 18A, the base station transmits the relay<br>
station downlink and uplink map information included in the data bursts to~the relay station..._<br>
in the same manner as the embodiment shown in FIG. 17A. However, in the embodiment of<br>
FIG. 17A, the base station transmits the relay station downlink and uplink map information<br>
included in the data burst to which the data transmitted to each relay station is allocated,	<br>
whereas in the embodiment of FIG. 18A, the base station transmits the relay station<br>
downlink and uplink map information through a data burst different from the data burst to<br>
which the data transmitted to each relay station is allocated.<br>
In the embodiment of FIG. 18A, the relay station downlink and uplink map<br>
information for each relay station may be transmitted through a separate data burst.<br>
Alternatively, the relay station downlink and uplink map information for two or more relay<br>
stations may be transmitted through a single data burst. Also, the relay station downlink and<br>
uplink map information for all the relay stations may be transmitted through a single data<br>
burst. In each case, the base station should notify each relay station of the position of the<br>
burst to which the relay station downlink and uplink map information is allocated, wherein<br>
the relay station downlink and uplink map information is allocated to each relay station<br>
through the relay station map information (RS-MAP info) IE included in the downlink map<br>
(DL-MAP) region. In the case that the relay station downlink and uplink map information<br>
for all the relay stations is transmitted through a single data burst, a data burst based on a<br><br>
broadcast CID is preferably used. In FIG. I8A, a region 'H" represents a data burst<br>
including the relay station downlink and uplink map information for all the relay stations.<br>
The operation performed after each of the relay stations R'S 1 and RS 2 receives<br>
: the frame shown in FIG. 18A is almost similar to that described with reference to FIGs. 17A<br>
to 17D. However, since the data burst including the relay station downlink and uplink map<br>
information is different from the data burst including data to be transmitted to the mobile<br>
—subscriber station, each relay station should recognize theposition of-data. burst .including	<br>
the relay station downlink and uplink map information allocated from the DL-MAP region<br>
included in the nth frame and the position of the data burst including the data to be<br>
—transmitted-to-the-mobile.sub.scrib-er_s,tation so as to receive the relay station downlink and	<br>
uplink map information and the data to be transmitted to the mobile subscriber station.<br>
Referring to FIG. 18B, the relay station RS 1 transmits the relay station<br>
downlink and uplink map (RSI DL/UL-MAP) information and the data to be transmitted to<br>
each mobile subscriber station by including the relay station downlink and uplink map (RSI<br>
DL/UL-MAP) information in the RSI UL-MAP region and the RSI DL-MAP region of the<br>
relay station downlink region, wherein the relay station downlink and uplink map (RSI<br>
DL/UL-MAP) information is included in the data burst H including the relay station<br>
downlink and uplink map information, and also including the data to be transmitted to each<br>
mobile subscriber station in data bursts I and J for the respective mobile subscriber stations<br>
MS 1 and MS 3 indicated by the relay station downlink and uplink map information. The<br>
mobile subscriber stations MS 1 and MS 3 synchronize with the relay station RS 1 through<br>
the RS-preamble of the (n+l)th frame of FIG. 18B, and receives data by recognizing the<br>
positions of the data bursts I and J allocated from the relay station downlink map (RSI DL-<br>
MAP) information included in the RSI UL-MAP region of the relay station downlink<br>
region.<br><br>
Table 11 illustrates an example of a data format of the downlink map<br>
information element (DL-MAP IE) for allowing the base station to indicate the relay station<br>
on the position of the burst including the relay station downlink and uplink map information.<br><br><br><br>
Table 12 and Table 13 define a new DIUC type (extended DIUC) for an<br>
information element indicating the position of the burst including the relay station downlink<br>
and uplink map information.<br><br>
Table 14 illustrates an example of a data format of the relay station downlink<br>
map information element (RS MAP_Info IE) for allowing the base station to indicate the<br>
relay station on the position of the burst including the relay station downlink and uplink<br>
map information. In the case that DIUC is '15' and 'Extended DIUC dependent IE' field is<br><br>
V0C,' the relay station reads out the RS MAPJnfo IE of Table 14 referring to DL-MAP IE<br>
of Table 3 to identify the position of the burst including the relay station downlink and<br>
uplink map information. Although the position of the burst is designated by subchannel<br>
offset, symbol offset, the number of subchannels,-and the number of symbols in Table 14, it<br>
is not limited to such examples of Table 14.<br><br>
Hereinafter, examples of a method for designating and retrieving a relay station<br>
region according to the present invention will be described with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
If communication is performed between the base station and the mobile<br>
subscriber station through the relay station, a region for performing communication between<br>
the relay station and the mobile subscriber station should be allocated to the frame, wherein<br>
the region is referred to as 'relay station region (or RS region).' FIG. 19 is a schematic view<br>
illustrating a frame structure suggested for communication through the relay station. In FIG.<br>
19, a portion 'RS DL' represents a downlink relay station region while a portion 'RS UL'<br>
represents an uplink relay station region.<br><br>
The data transmitted from the base station to the relay station is allocated to the '<br>
downlink of the existing frame in a burst mode while the data transmitted from the relay<br>
station to the mobile subscriber station is allocated to the downlink relay station region. In<br>
the case that the-mobile subscriber station has data to be transmitted to the base station, the<br>
data is transmitted through the region allocated to the mobile subscriber station from the<br>
uplink region indicated by the uplink map (UL-MAP) of the relay station, and the relay<br>
..station transmitstheLdata^received from the mobile subscriber station to the base station	<br>
through the uplink relay station region (RS UL).<br>
The downlink relay station region includes a length of the relay station downlink<br>
and uplink map (RS DL/UL MAP), RS-FCH (frame controller header) including coding<br>
information, an RS-preamble region for synchronizing with the mobile subscriber station,<br>
relay station downlink and uplink map regions, and relay station downlink and uplink data<br>
burst regions. The RS-preamble may have different sequences per relay station. The map<br>
structure of the relay station region and burst allocation within the relay station region are<br>
determined by the base station.<br>
FIGs. 20 and 21 are schematic views illustrating frames transmitted and received<br>
from the base station and the relay station to the mobile subscriber station.in accordance<br>
with the preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 20 illustrates a structure of the nth frame transmitted and received between<br>
the base station and the relay stations RS 1 and RS 2. In the OFDM or OFDMA<br>
communication system, the frame can be defined by a two-dimensional plane of a<br>
horizontal axis of a symbol (or time) and a vertical axis of a subchannel (or frequency). The<br>
whole frame is comprised of a downlink sub-frame (DL sub-frame) and an uplink sub-<br>
frame (UL sub-frame).<br><br>
The base station includes identification information for designating the downlink<br>
and uplink relay station regions within the frame, in the downlink map (DL-MAP), and<br>
transmits the identification information to the relay station and the mobile subscriber station,<br>
"wherein the identification information-may be included in the relay, station downlink region<br>
information element (RS DL Zone IE) and the relay station uplink region information<br>
element (RS UL Zone IE).<br>
. The. identification information for the relay stationregiqn includes jjJejijtificajti_qn_	<br>
information of a start point of the relay station region. Also, the identification information<br>
may include identification information of a start point of the relay station region during at<br>
least one next frame as well as identification information of a start point of the relay station<br>
region during the current frame. In FIG. 20, the start point of the relay station region<br>
represents a start point of the relay station preamble (RS-preamble). The identification<br>
information for the relay station region may be included in the data bursts A and B allocated<br>
to each relay station. The positions of the data bursts allocated to each relay station are<br>
designated by a message included in the downlink map (DL-MAP) region of the frame.<br>
The base station transmits the relay station downlink map (RS DL-MAP)<br>
information and the relay station uplink map (RS UL-MAP) information to each relay<br>
station. The relay station downlink map information and the relay station uplink map<br>
information include a frame number (for example, (n+l)th frame) which is to transmit data<br>
of the mobile subscriber station received from the base station, position information (for<br>
example, symbol and subchannel offset value based on the RS-preamble) of RS DL/UL<br>
MAP of each relay station, RS DL/UL MAR length, FCH information including coding<br>
information, and downlink and uplink map information for each mobile subscriber station in<br>
the downlink and uplink relay station regions. The downlink and uplink map information<br>
for each mobile subscriber station includes downlink data burst allocation information and<br><br>
uplink data burst allocation information, wherein the downlink data burst allows each relay<br>
station to transmit data to each mobile subscriber station and the uplink data burst allows<br>
each mobile subscriber station to transmit data to each relay station.<br>
The base station may include the relay station downlink and uplink map<br>
information in the downlink map (DL-MAP) region and the uplink map (UL-MAP) region<br>
along with the downlink and uplink map information allocated to the mobile subscriber<br>
_ station, which directly communicates with the base .station, without through the relay station.	<br>
Each relay station includes the relay station uplink/downlink map information included in<br>
the downlink map region and the uplink map region in the relay station downlink map<br>
region (RS DL-MAP Zone) and the relay station uplink map region (RS DL-MAP Zone) of<br>
the downlink relay station region (RS DL) or the uplink relay station region (RS UL), and<br>
then transmits the map information to the mobile subscriber station. Each mobile subscriber<br>
station is allocated with the downlink data burst for receiving data from the relay station and<br>
the uplink data burst for transmitting data to the relay station in accordance with the relay<br>
station downlink/uplink map information included in the relay station downlink map region<br>
(RS DL-MAP Zone) and the relay station uplink map region (RS UL-MAP Zone).<br>
The base station can include the relay station downlink and uplink map<br>
information in the data burst allocated to each relay station and then can transmit the map<br>
information to each relay station. In other words, there exist data to be transmitted to the<br>
mobile subscriber stations MS 1, MS 2, and MS 3 through the relay stations RS 1 and RS 2,<br>
the base station allocates the data burst of each relay station to the downlink data burst<br>
region and transmits the data through the allocated data burst. In FIG. 20, a region 'A'<br>
represents a data burst including data to be transmitted from the base station to the mobile<br>
subscriber stations MS 1 and MS 3 through the relay station RS 1 and is allocated to the<br>
relay station RS 1, and a region .'B' represents a data burst including data to be transmitted<br><br>
from the base station to the mobile subscriber station MS 2 through the relay station RS 2<br>
and is allocated to the relay station RS 2. At this time, the data bursts A and B respectively<br>
allocated to the relay stations RS 1 and RS 2 include the relay station downlink and uplink<br>
map (RSI DL/UL-MAP and RS2 DL/UL-MAP) information along with the data to be ..<br>
transmitted to the mobile subscriber stations. The base station designates the positions of the<br>
data bursts A and B allocated to the relay stations RS 1 and RS 2 and a frame number for<br>
..transmitting .data.to the mobile.subscriber.siationjln.ihe_reJay stations R^^<br>
through the DL-MAP information element (IE) of the downlink map (DL-MAP) region.<br>
The relay stations RS 1 and RS 2 identify the positions of the data bursts A and<br>
B allocated thereto through the DL-MAP information element, and transmit the downlink<br>
relay station region to the mobile subscriber station by using the relay station downlink and<br>
uplink map (RSI DL/UL-MAP and RS2 DL/UL-MAP) information included in their<br>
corresponding data bursts.<br>
FIG. 21 illustrates a structure of a frame ((n+l)th frame) designated by the base<br>
station to allow the relay station RS 1 to transmit the data to the mobile subscriber stations<br>
MS 1 and MS 3, i.e., a structure of the (n+l)th frame transmitted from the relay station RS 1<br>
to the mobile subscriber stations MS 1 and MS 3. Referring to FIG. 21, the relay station RS<br>
1 includes the relay station downlink and uplink map (RSI DL/UL-MAP) information in<br>
the RSI UL-MAP region and the RSI DL-MAP region of the relay station downlink region,<br>
wherein the relay station downlink and uplink map (RSI DL/UL-MAP) information is<br>
included in the data burst A allocated from the base station to the relay station RS 1. The<br>
relay station RS 1 includes data to be transmitted to respective mobile subscriber stations<br>
MS 1 and MS 3 in data bursts C and D for the respective mobile subscriber stations MS 1<br>
and MS 3 indicated by the relay station downlink and uplink map information. Then, the<br>
relay station RS 1 transmits the map information and the data.<br><br>
The relay station RS 1 transmits a message including the identification<br>
information for the relay station region to the mobile subscriber station through the relay<br>
station downlink map (RSI DL-MAP) region, wherein the identification information is<br>
received from the base station. As described above, the-identification information for the<br>
relay station region includes identification information of a start point of the relay station<br>
region during at least one next frame as well as identification information of a start point of,<br>
the relay station region duringjthe cjarrentJrarne._.The start point of the re[aystatipn_.region<br>
represents a start point of the relay station preamble (RS-preamble).<br>
Table 15 illustrates an example of a data format of a message (RSL DL-MAP<br>
message) including identification information of the start point of the relay station preamble.<br><br><br><br>
In Table 15, identification information of the start point of the relay station<br>
preamble is expressed by a 'Current Preamble Offset' field and a 'Next Preamble Offset'<br>
field. The 'Current Preamble Offset' field means symbol offset from a specific reference<br>
point to the start point of the current relay station preamble (RS-preamble), and the "Next<br>
Preamble Offset' field means symbol offset from a specific reference point to the start point<br>
of the relay station preamble during the next frame. Although the specific reference point<br>
preferably corresponds to the symbol position of the message including the identification<br>
information of the start point of the relay station preamble, it is not limited to such position.<br>
The identification information of the start point of the relay station preamble<br>
may be expressed by various methods in addition to the example of Table 15. For example,<br>
the 'Current Preamble Offset' field may mean symbol offset from a specific reference point<br>
to the start point of the current relay station preamble (RS-preamble), and the "Next<br>
Preamble Offset' field may mean symbol offset from the start point of the relay station<br>
preamble during the current frame to the start point of the relay station preamble during the<br>
next frame. The identification information may include the 'Next Preamble Offset' only.<br>
Also, although the identification information may designate the start point of the relay<br>
station preamble during a single next frame after the current frame, the identification<br>
information may designate the start point of the relay station preamble during two or more<br>
next frames.<br>
Since the mobile subscriber station can easily retrieve the start point of the relay,<br>
station preamble from the identification information during the next frame, there is no need<br>
to synchronize with the relay station preamble to retrieve the relay station region for every<br><br>
frame, and the start point of the relay station region can be retrieved quickly and exactly<br>
even in the case that the position of the relay station region is varied.<br>
As described above, the communication method using the relay station in the<br>
mobile communication system according to the present invention has the following<br>
advantages.<br>
First, in the mobile communication system provided with the relay station, data<br>
—relay communication can efficiently be-performed			__.		<br>
Second, the data can be transmitted to mobile subscriber stations corresponding<br>
to a shadow area by relay communication, and higher throughput can be supported to'<br>
	mobile subscriber stations not corresponding to the shadow area.	<br>
Third, in the case that communication is performed between the base station and<br>
the mobile subscriber station through the relay station, the communication resource<br>
allocation procedure can clearly be defined and the communication resource can efficiently<br>
be allocated.<br>
Finally, the mobile subscriber station does not need to synchronize with the relay<br>
station preamble to retrieve the relay station region for every frame, and the start point of<br>
the relay station region can be retrieved quickly and exactly even in the case that the<br>
position of the relay station region is varied.<br>

Abstract<br><br><br>
A Method Of Relaying Data In<br>
A Communication System<br>
A communication method using a relay station (RS) in a mobile<br>
communication system is disclosed. A base station transmits a first DL_MAP<br>
information (RS DL Zone IE and RS UL Zone IE) for indicating radio resource<br>
allocation for transmitting data from the base station to the RS and a second DL-<br>
MAP information (RS1 and RS2) for indicating radio resource allocation for<br>
transmitting data from the relay station to a mobile subscriber station. The base<br>
station can transmit data to the RS by using the resource allocated in accordance<br>
with the first DL-MAP information.</td>
