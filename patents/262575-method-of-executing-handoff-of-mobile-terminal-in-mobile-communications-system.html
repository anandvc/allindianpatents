Description<br>
METHOD OF EXECUTING HANDOFF OF MOBILE<br>
TERMINAL IN MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to mobile communication systems, and more par-<br>
ticularly, to a method for an idle state mobile station of a mobile communications<br>
system to perform and support handoffs more efficiently.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	Figure 1 shows an example of an overall call processing procedure beginning from<br>
power turn on of a mobile station in a mobile communication system. When power is<br>
applied to the mobile station, necessary system information is read from memory and<br>
set in a RAM (or other storage means), synchronization with the system is performed<br>
by using a pilot channel and a sync channel, and a mobile station initialization state for<br>
receiving required system information is entered. In a message (e.g., a sync channel<br>
message) that is transmitted through the sync channel, system information, and<br>
frequency information related to a paging channel or a P-BCCH (Primary Broadcast<br>
Control CHannel) to allow a mobile station in idle state to decode the paging channel<br>
or the P-BCCH, and data rate or coding rate information are included. If the P-BCCH<br>
is employed, transmit diversity related information is additionally included.<br>
[3]	The mobile station idle state refers to a state when, after the mobile station in ini-<br>
tialization state received all system information and normal operations are complete,<br>
overhead messages have been received from a base station through the paging channel<br>
or the P-BCCH by using the information transmitted via the sync channel message.<br>
Some examples of these overhead messages are a system parameters message (SPM)<br>
that contains system related information, an extended system parameters message<br>
(ESPM), a general neighbor list message (GNLM) that contains information about<br>
neighbor cells or sectors, an extended neighbor list message (ENLM), a universal<br>
neighbor list message (UNLM), and the like.<br>
[4]	The system access state refers to a state for allowing the mobile station to access the<br>
system, while the traffic state refers to when the mobile station is performing commu-<br>
nications, i.e., a call is being performed. When a mobile station in system access state<br>
completes a particular operation, it returns to the idle state or traffic state. While in idle<br>
state, if a message transmitted through the paging channel or the P-BCCH is not<br>
received, the initialization procedure is started again. For a mobile station in traffic<br>
state, if a call ends while being performed, the initialization procedure is started again<br>
to re-establish sync.<br><br>
[5]	The mobile station not only measures the pilot signal strength of a serving base<br>
station, but also obtains information, such as PILOT_PN and the like, with respect to<br>
neighbor cells, through neighbor messages such as GNLM, ENLM, UNLM, etc., and<br>
continuously monitors the pilot signal strengths of the neighbor cells. As a result of<br>
such monitoring, if the pilot signal strength of a neighbor cell increases above a certain<br>
threshold when compared to the pilot signal strength of the serving base station, the<br>
mobile station performs idle handoff, which refers to receiving a paging channel or P-<br>
BCCH from a base station having greater pilot signal strength.<br>
[6]	Hereafter, the base station that the mobile station moves to upon performing idle<br>
handoff is called a target base station, while the current base station is called a source<br>
base station.<br>
[7]	In the situation where a mobile station that had received a paging channel, moves to<br>
a target base station and must receive a P-BCCH, the related art suffers from problems<br>
because the mobile station does not receive from the source base station any in-<br>
formation needed for decoding the P-BCCH. In more detail, as shown in Figures 2 and<br>
3, during idle state handoff, the idle state does not directly change over to idle state,<br>
but the mobile station moves to the target base station and after entering a system de-<br>
termination sub-state, the pilot channel and sync channel are received, information<br>
regarding the P-BCCH is received therefrom, and thereafter, idle state is entered. This<br>
causes the problem of creating delays.<br>
[8]	Additionally, in the situation where a paging channel had been received from the<br>
source base station and a paging channel is to be received upon moving to the target<br>
base station, if the data rate changes upon moving to the target base station due to<br>
handover (e.g., changing from 4800 bps to 9600 bps), because the related art mobile<br>
station should go into the system determination sub-state and then enter the idle state,<br>
the problems of delay may occur. Similar problems occur when the related art mobile<br>
station that had received a P-BCCH from the source base station, needs to receive a<br>
paging channel after performing handover to the target base station.<br>
[9]	Similarly, in the situation where a P-BCCH was received from the source base<br>
station and a P-BCCH is to be received from the target base station, if the data rate or<br>
coding rate or Walsh code changes at the target base station, the related art mobile<br>
station should go into the system determination sub-state and then enter the idle state,<br>
thus causing problems of delay.<br>
[10]	If such delays occur during idle state handoff, if the related art mobile station had<br>
been receiving a broadcast service from the source base station while in idle state,<br>
these delays can greatly affect the broadcast service quality (QoS). In other words, as<br>
the related art mobile station in idle state receives a broadcast service through a<br>
forward supplement channel (F-SCH), the broadcast service cannot be received during<br><br>
the time consumed by the delay in entering the idle state by going through the<br>
system determination sub-state upon performing idle handoff.<br>
US 2001/016493 relates to method for idle handoff in a cellular system. However, it<br>
fails to disclose a method, wherein the configuration information is received via<br>
overhead messages comprising point-to-multipoint service parameters and a list of<br>
neighbor base stations.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[11] One aspect of the present invention involves the recognition by the present<br>
inventors of the drawbacks in the related art, as explained above. Based upon such<br>
recognition, improvements to idle state handoff procedures can be achieved<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
[12] The present invention has been developed to solve the above-described<br>
problems of the related art. One desirable result of the present invention is to<br>
minimize unnecessary delays that may occur when an idle state mobile station of a<br>
mobile communications system performs handoff, and to thus minimize quality<br>
degradation of a particular service being received from a source base station.<br>
[13] The present invention provides a method of supporting idle state handoffs of a<br>
mobile station performed by a base station of a mobile communications system. The<br>
present invention provides a method of performing handoff of an idle state mobile<br>
station of a mobile communications system that can continue to receive a broadcast<br>
or multicast service before and after idle state handoff is performed.<br><br>
[14] More specifically, the present invention determines whether configuration<br>
information of the target base station exists in previously stored configuration<br>
information received from the neighboring base station, and performs idle handoff<br>
using the stored configuration information of the target base station if the<br>
configuration information is determined to exist, or returns to a system<br>
determination sub-state if the configuration information is determined not to exist.<br>
[15] Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be set forth in<br>
part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those<br>
having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned<br>
from practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention may be<br>
realized and attained as particularly pointed out in the appended claims.<br>

from power turn on of a mobile station in a mobile communication system.<br>
[17] Figures 2 and 3 show an idle handoff performing procedure according to the<br>
related art.<br>
[18] Figures 4 and 5 show an idle handoff performing procedure according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
[19] Figure 6 shows a procedural flow of an exemplary embodiment of the present<br><br>
invention.<br>
Mode for the Invention<br>
[20]	The present invention is described as being implemented in a 3GPP2 type mobile<br>
communications system. However, the features of the present invention may also be<br>
adapted and implemented in communications systems operating under other types of<br>
communication specifications (e.g., 3GPP, 4G, IEEE, OMA, etc.), because the<br>
concepts and teachings of the present invention could be applied to various com-<br>
munication schemes that operate in a similar manner based upon common techniques.<br>
[21]	Also, the present invention will be explained in die context of broadcast/multicast<br>
services (BCMCS), but the features of the present invention may apply to various types<br>
of point-to-multipoint services that provide multimedia data to users, such as<br>
multimedia broadcast/multicast service (MBMS), media broadcasting, contents<br>
delivery, and the like.<br>
[22]	Non-limiting exemplary embodiments of the present invention are explained below<br>
with reference to the attached Figures.<br>
[23]	For a mobile communications system, the present invention provides a method by<br>
which when an idle state mobile station performs handoff between a source base<br>
station and a target base station, unnecessary delays are minimized such that quality<br>
degradation of a service received from the target base station is minimized.<br>
[24]	Figures 4 and 5 explain the features of some embodiments of the present invention.<br>
In the situation where neighbor base station information is transmitted from the source<br>
base station to the mobile station through a paging channel using overhead messages<br>
(such as GNLM, ENLM, UNLM, etc.), if such neighbor base station is a base station<br>
that transmits overhead messages through a P-BCCH (or other equivalent or similar<br>
control channel), in order to support idle state handoff, channel information of the P-<br>
BCCH for the target base station is received ahead of time from the source base station<br>
via the overhead messages. After handoff is completed, such channel information is<br>
used in receiving the P-BCCH of the target base station to allow reception of overhead<br>
messages with minimal delays.<br>
[25]	Figure 6 shows a procedural flow of an exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention. A mobile station in idle state receives, from the source base station via a<br>
paging channel, an overhead message containing channel information of a P-BCCH of<br>
at least more than one neighbor base stations (S41).<br>
[26]	The source base station may receive such channel information from a base station<br>
controller (BSC) or some other network entity with similar functions. Some examples<br>
of these overhead messages are a general neighbor list message (GNLM), an extended<br>
neighbor list message (ENLM), a universal neighbor list message (UNLM), BCMC<br><br>
service parameters message (BSPM), and the like. Here, it can be understood that other<br>
types of messages that have the same or similar functions may also be used.<br>
[27]	The BSPM message is a message that is broadcast for mobile stations that desire to<br>
receive a broadcasting service, and includes control information for receiving<br>
broadcast service data. It should be noted that if the BSPM is not received, the mobile<br>
station may enter the system determination sub-state before going into the idle state in<br>
order to obtain the necessary broadcast/multicast service parameters.<br>
[28]	The channel information refers to information for decoding the P-BCCH, and may<br>
include information related to the P-BCCH usage frequency, coding rate, data rate, and<br>
transmit diversity of the P-BCCH. Table 1 shows an example of a data format of the<br>
channel information of the P-BCCH included in the overhead message. The channel<br>
information may include all or some of the contents described in Table 1.<br>
[29]	{Table 1}<br>

labels of the fields listed in Table 1 above are merely exemplary. Additional and/or<br>
other equivalent or similar names or labels may also be used to denote the particular<br>
fields that may be employed in the present invention.<br>
[32]	In the example of Table 1, for SRI (Spreading Rate 1), information related to<br>
whether or not transmit diversity is used, frequency used for P-BCCH according to<br>
whether or not transmit diversity is used, coding rate, data rate are included therein.<br>

[55]	Table 2 shows an exemplary message when information related to the P-BCCH of<br>
neighbor base stations is informed by the source base station to the mobile station via<br>
the BSPM (BCMC Service Parameters Message). In Table 2, BCMC_NUM_NGHBR<br>
indicates the number of neighbor base stations to which P-BCCH related information is<br>
to be informed through the BSPM, while BCMC_NGHBR_PN includes PN offset in-<br>
formation of each neighbor base station. The information related to the<br>
BCMC_NGHBR_PN and P-BCCH are included by as much as the number of neighbor<br>
base stations [BCMC_NUM_NGHBR].<br>

[57]<br><br><br>
[58]	Here, it can be understood by those skilled in the art that the particular names or<br>
labels of the fields listed in Table 2 above are merely exemplary. Additional and/or<br>
other equivalent or similar names or labels may also be used to denote the particular<br>
fields that may be employed in the present invention,<br>
[59]	As a method of transmitting such channel information by the source base station to<br>
the mobile station, transmission of all data related to such channel information could<br>
be possible, but another method may also be considered. Namely, matching of the<br>
channel information with bit information can be performed according to associations<br>
(combinations or sets) of channel information. Here, the number of bit information is<br>
previously determined between the source base station, the mobile station, and<br>
neighbor base stations. For example, to indicate the 'configuration' of neighbor base<br>
stations, the reserved values of the NGHBR_CONFIG (which is a 3-bit field that is<br>
transmitted through the GNLM as many times as the number of neighbor base stations)<br>
are used to perform matching of each association (combination or set) of the P-BCCH<br>
usage frequency, coding rate, and data rate (that are included in the channel in-<br>
formation) to the bit information of 3 bits, to thereby transmit the bit information that<br>
has been matched with current channel information of the P-BCCH of neighbor base<br>
stations, to thus reduce the amount of load for transmitting channel information. Also,<br>
when the neighbor base stations transmit the P-BCCH at a particular usage frequency,<br>
coding rate, and data rate that were previously determined between the source base<br>
station and the mobile stations, the channel information can be transmitted by means of<br>
a simple procedure, such as setting the 1-bit 'Indication' to '1' or the like.<br>
[60]	The mobile station that received, from the source base station, the P-BCCH channel<br>
information of neighbor base stations, retains the received information upon storage in<br>
memory, and can later use such during subsequent handoffs.<br>
[61]	If the received BCMC_SRl_BCCH_NON_TD_TNCL has been set to T the mobile<br>
station stores in memory, the values of the BCMC_SRl_NON_TD_FREQ_INCL,<br>
BCMC„SRl_BRAT_NON_TD, BCMC_SRl_CRAT_NON_TD, and<br>
BCMC_SRl_BCCH_CODE_CHAN_NON _TD that were received from the base<br>
station, and if the received BCMC_SRl_NON_TD_FREQ_INCL has been set to T,<br>
the BCMC_SRl_CDMA_FREQ_NON_TD that was received from the base station is<br>
stored.<br>
[62]	If BCMC_SR1__TD_INCL has been set to T', the BCMC_SR1_CDMA_FREQ<br>
_TD, BCMC_SR1_BRAT_TD, BCMC_SR1_CRAT_TD,<br>
BCMC_SRl_BCCH_CODE_CHAN_TD, BCMC_SR1_TD_ MODE, and<br>
BCMC_SRl_TD_POWER_MODE, which were received from the base station are<br>
stored.<br>
[63]	Also, if the BCMC_SR3JBRAT_TD received from the base station has been set to<br><br>
'1', the information of BCMC_SR3_CENTER„FREQ_INCL, BCMC_SR3_BRAT,<br>
BCMC_SR3_BCCH_CODE_CHAN,BCMC_SR3_PRIMARY_PILOT,<br>
BCMC_SR3JPILOTJPOWERl, and BCMC_SR3_PILOT_POWER2 are stored, and<br>
if BCMC_SR3_CENTER_FREQ_INCL has been set to T the<br>
BCMC_SR3_CENTER_FREQ received from the base station is also stored.<br>
[64]	The mobile station continuously monitors the pilot signal strength of neighbor base<br>
stations, and if the pilot signal strength of a neighbor base station increases to above a<br>
certain threshold value over the pilot signal strength of the source base station, a cor-<br>
responding neighbor base station is determined to be the target base station and<br>
handoff is performed (S42).<br>
[65]	Upon performing handoff, the mobile station uses the channel information that was<br>
retained upon receipt from the source base station, to receive with minimal delays, the<br>
P-BCCH that is transmitted by the target base station (S43). Accordingly, as the<br>
mobile station in idle station is receiving a different service (such as a broadcast<br>
service) through a F-SCH (Forward Supplemental Channel) from the source base<br>
station, even if idle handoff to a target base station is performed, because the idle state<br>
may be directly entered without any delays being created due to going through a<br>
system determination state before entering the idle state, the service that had been<br>
provided from the source base station may continue to be received from the target base<br>
station without service disconnection.<br>
[66]	Upon performing idle state handoff by the mobile station, the operation procedures<br>
at the target base station will be explained in more detail as follows. When the mobile<br>
station performs initialization of the sequence number with respect to overhead<br>
messages to be received through the P-BCCH from the target base station, initially, the<br>
sequence number with respect to an overhead message related to an access channel or<br>
an enhanced access channel is initialized, a PILOTJPN of the memory is received<br>
from the source base station for setting to the value of the BCMC_NGBHR_PN that<br>
was retained in storage. As a result of receiving an overhead message from the P-<br>
BCCH of the target base station, if the information of the overhead that was retained in<br>
storage is deemed to be most recent, the received information is used to perform<br>
hashing to a new F-CCCH, and paging and the like is received from the F-CCCH. As a<br>
result of receiving an overhead message, if the information of the overhead that was<br>
retained in storage is deemed to be not most recent, the mobile station performs ini-<br>
tialization with respect to sequence numbers of related messages. The question of<br>
whether the overhead message is most recent or not can be determined by comparing<br>
the received sequence number of the corresponding message with a stored sequence<br>
number. After going through the above procedures, the mobile station compares to see<br>
if the NGBHR_FSCH_FREQ (i.e., corresponding frequency information of the FSCFJ<br><br>
that is a channel for receiving a broadcast service) that was received through the BSPM<br>
of the source base station and retained in memory, matches the CDMACH of the<br>
target base station. If not a match, CDMACH is set to NGHBRJFSCHJFREQ and<br>
upon performing tuning to a new CDMA channel, the broadcast from the FSCH is<br>
monitored.<br>
[67]	Thus far, an embodiment where the mobile station has been receiving a paging<br>
channel from the source base station, then moves to the target base station to receive a<br>
P-BCCH, has been explained. As another embodiment, during the procedure where the<br>
mobile station that was receiving a P-BCCH from the source base station, moves to the<br>
target base station upon performing idle state handover and receives a P-BCCH, if the<br>
data rate, code rate, and/or Walsh code change, the features of the present invention<br>
can be applied.<br>
[68]	If the above situation is explained in more detail, when a related art mobile station<br>
performs handover and has moved to a target base station, delays occur because the<br>
idle state must be entered by first entering a system determination state. But according<br>
to the present invention, the mobile station receives in advance from the source base<br>
station via P-BCCH overhead messages, the P-BCCH channel information (frequency,<br>
data rate, coding rate, Walsh code, etc.) of the target base station, such that the channel<br>
information is used after handoff is complete to receive the P-BCCH of'the target base<br>
station to allow reception of overhead messages with minimal or no delays.<br>
[69]	In another embodiment of the present invention, in case a paging channel was<br>
received from the source base station and a paging channel is again received after<br>
moving to the target base station, even if the data rate changes upon moving to the<br>
target base station due to handover (e.g., changes from 4800 bps to 9600 bps), the<br>
features of the present invention can be applied. In such case, the mobile station<br>
receives in advance from the source base station, paging channel information of<br>
neighbor base stations (e.g., GNLM, ENLM, UNLM, BSPM, etc.) via overhead<br>
messages, such that the channel information is used after handoff is complete to<br>
receive the P-BCCH of the target base station to allow reception of overhead messages<br>
without delay.<br>
[70]	In a further embodiment of the present invention, in case a P-BCCH was received<br>
from the source base station but a paging channel is received after moving to the target<br>
base, even if there is a difference in the default data rate (e.g., 9600 bps) for<br>
transmitting the paging channel by the target base station upon moving to such target<br>
base station due to handover, the features of the present invention can be applied. In<br>
such case, the source base station transmits to the mobile station via overhead<br>
messages, paging channel information of the target base station (in particular, a current<br>
data rate) in order to prevent or minimize unnecessary delays in the handover<br><br>
procedure.<br>
[71]	To implement the various features described above, the present invention can<br>
employ various types of hardware and/or software components (modules). For<br>
example, different hardware modules may contain various circuits and components<br>
necessary to perform the steps of the above method. Also, different software modules<br>
(executed by processors and/or other hardware) may contain various codes and<br>
protocols necessary to perform the steps of the present invention method.<br>
[72]	The present invention provides a method of supporting handoff when a mobile<br>
station is in idle mode, the method comprising: receiving and storing configuration in-<br>
formation of neighboring base stations; while checking a strength of pilot channels of<br>
the neighboring base stations, detecting a pilot signal strength of a target base station<br>
that is greater than that of a source base station; checking whether configuration in-<br>
formation of the target base station exists among the stored configuration information<br>
of the neighboring base stations; and determining how to perform idle handoff based<br>
upon the checking.<br>
[73]	The determining step comprises, if the configuration information does not exist,<br>
returning to a system determination sub-state. The determining step comprises, if the<br>
configuration information exists, performing idle handoff using the stored con-<br>
figuration information of the target base station.<br>
[74]	The configuration information is received through overhead messages. The<br>
overhead messages comprises a Broadcast/Multicast Service Parameters Message<br>
(BSPM) and neighbor list messages. The neighbor list messages comprise at least one<br>
of. a General Neighbor List Message (GNLM), an Extended Neighbor List Message<br>
(ENLM), and a Universal Neighbor List Message (UNLM).<br>
[75]	The overhead messages include fields that indicate information of a physical<br>
channel, in which overhead messages are sent, used by the mobile station in idle state.<br>
The information of the physical channel indicates whether transmit diversity is<br>
supported or not. If transmit diversity is supported, appropriate values for parameters<br>
comprising frequency assignment, data rate, code rate, Walsh code, transmit diversity<br>
mode, and power level are used. If transmit diversity is not supported, appropriate<br>
values for parameters comprising frequency assignment, data rate, code rate, and<br>
Walsh code are used.<br>
[76]	If the mobile station has monitored a PCH from before performing idle handoff, and<br>
has selected a neighbor base station for idle handoff which supports P-BCCH and the<br>
mobile station has received parameters for the P-BCCH of the neighbor base station<br>
from the BSPM, then the mobile station performs normal handoff procedures.<br>
[77]	The source base station sends overhead messages via a first control channel for<br>
overhead messages, and the target base station sends overhead messages via a second<br><br>
control channel for overhead messages. The first and second control channels are<br>
broadcast control channels. The first control channel is a PCH and the second control<br>
channel is a P-BCCH.<br>
[78]	The information includes at least one of a pilot PN sequence offset, and appropriate<br>
values for frequency assignment, data rate, code rate, and Walsh code. The information<br>
is provided in a quantity that matches the total number of neighbor base stations.<br>
[79]	Also, the present invention provides a method of supporting handoff when a mobile<br>
station is in idle mode, the method comprising: detecting a pilot signal strength of a<br>
target base station that is greater than that of a source base station upon checking pilot<br>
channel strengths of multiple neighboring base stations; determining whether con-<br>
figuration information of the target base station exists in previously stored con-<br>
figuration information received from the neighboring base stations; and performing<br>
handoff using the stored configuration information of the target base station if the con-<br>
figuration information exists, or returning to a system determination sub-state if the<br>
configuration information fails to exist.<br>
[80]	The configuration information is received via overhead messages comprising point-<br>
to-multipoint service parameters and a list of neighbor base stations. The overhead<br>
messages includes parameters for a physical channel that is used in sending the<br>
overhead messages, the parameters indicating whether transmit diversity is supported<br>
or not. If transmit diversity is supported, values for frequency assignment, data rate,<br>
code rate, Walsh code, transmit diversity mode, and power level are included in the<br>
overhead messages. If transmit diversity is not supported, values for frequency<br>
assignment, data rate, code rate, and Walsh code are included in the overhead<br>
messages.<br>
[81]	The parameters for each neighbor base station are respectively provided, such that<br>
the total number of parameters match the total number of neighbor base stations.<br>
[82]	As described thus far, those skilled in the art related to the field of the present<br>
invention would understand that various substitutions, modifications, and changes are<br>
possible within the technical scope of the present invention, without being limited to<br>
the exemplary embodiments and attached Figures described herein.<br>
[83]	As for some desirable results and effects of the present invention, according to the<br>
handoff executing method for a mobile station in idle state in a mobile commu-<br>
nications system, when an idle state mobile station performs handoff between a source<br>
base station and a target base station that respectively transmit overhead messages<br>
through different types of channels, unnecessary delays are prevented such that the<br>
quality of the service that was received from the source base station can be maintained<br>
without service quality degradation upon performing handoff. In particular, this results<br>
in reception of broadcast or multicast service without being disconnected before and<br><br>
after a mobile station in idle state performs handoff.<br>

invention. The scope of the claims is intended to cover various modifications and<br>
equivalent arrangements of the illustrative embodiments disclosed in the specification.<br>
