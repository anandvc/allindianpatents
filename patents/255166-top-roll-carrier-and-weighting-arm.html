3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be  performed : -<br><br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a top roller carrier and weighting arm according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
Spinning machine-drafting arrangements generally have top roller carrier and weighting arms, in which the top rollers can be weighted individually be means of spring elements. To achieve favourable operating conditions, the weighting pressure on the individual top rollers may be adjusted as finely as possible and thus be adapted to the respective spinning conditions.<br>
A top roller carrier and weighting arm of this type is known, for example from DE-AS-1 087 496. The top rollers are held on guide arms, which, with their weighting springs and with substantially U-shaped or bow-shaped slides, form units which are displaceable and fixable inside the top roller carrier and weighting arm. A unit of this type is dismantled complete as a module from the top roller carrier and weighting arm and the adjustment of the weighting of the spring is carried out in the dismantled state. The individual units are designated by marks or designations on the slides or on the guide arms, for example in the region of their bearing points, in order to thus provide the respective weighting pressures for the individual pressure stages of the weighting spring and the individual positions of the pressure piece. After installation in the top roller carrier and weighting arm and the fixing of the adjusted unit by means of fastening screws, the marks and designations can no longer be seen. The operating lever, with which the top roller carrier and weighting arm is actuated, in the operating position, covers the fastening screws on the upper side of the top roller carrier and weighting arm completely.<br>
DE-AS-1169 342 shows a top roller carrier and weighting arm with a spring element, which is designed as a two-legged bow spring formed from one piece. The spring force acting on the top rollers can be adjusted with a hexagon screw arranged on the upper side of the top roller carrier and weighting arm, by turning the screw. In a<br><br><br>
different configuration, to adjust the spring force, a cam rigidly connected to a bolt acts on the spring. The spring force is adjusted by turning the bolt. The level of the weighting cannot be read from the position of the hexagon head of the screw.<br>
In a further configuration, which is shown in DE-AS-1 169 342, the spring force is adjusted for the weighting of all the top rollers together by means of an adjusting screw, which can be longitudinally displaced and fixed in a slot on the upper side of the top roller carrier and fastening arm. A scale is arranged next to the slot. The respective position of the adjusting screw relative to the scale allows a reproducible adjustment of the spring force. It is no longer possible to read the spring force in the operating position of the top roller carrier and weighting arm.<br>
DE 30 16 814 Al describes a top roller carrier and weighting arm with a pressure spring arranged obliquely to the drafting field plane, the effective spring length of which can be changed and fixed. The weighting adjustment is carried out by means of an adjustment tool, which is inserted into the opening of an adjustment eccentric. The opening of the adjustment eccentric has a shape which, in conjunction with the adjustment tool, allows only single allocation of the two parts. During the weighting adjustment with the adjustment tool inserted, the respectively adjusted weighting stage can therefore clearly be seen from the angle position of the adjustment tool. The weighting stages can be read by means of markings on the adjustment tool. Once the adjustment tool has been removed again when the weighting adjustment has been completed and the upper side of the top roller carrier and weighting arm is covered by the operating lever, it can no longer be seen which weighting stage has been adjusted.<br>
The generic DE 6609341 U discloses a drafting arrangement for spinning machines with a plurality of pressure rollers, which are loaded with pressure by associated weighting devices. The weighting devices are part of top roller carrier and weighting arms. The top roller carrier and weighting arms in each case have a single display device with a scale and a display member, from which the adjusted pressure, which<br><br><br>
acts on the pressure rollers, can be read off at the head end of the top roller carrier and weighting arm. The spring characteristic in this case is included in the displayed value. The display is subjected to an adjustment or calibration process. The expensive adjustment process is a prerequisite for the comparison of the displays of different display devices with one another. The display device continuously shows the value of the so-called absolute pressure actually acting on the top roller after the adjustment process. This absolute pressure is, however, only displayed during weighting of the top roller, in other words in the operating position of the top roller carrying and weighting arm. In the operating position, the top roller cooperates with the respectively associated bottom roller for clamping a fibre band, which runs through the drafting arrangement. If the top roller does not exert any pressure on the bottom roller when the top roller carrier and weighting arm is pivoted up, the display of the display device is not suitable either for information regarding the adjusted weighting or for a comparison with the adjusted weighting of other top rollers. If more than one pressure weighting of pressure rollers is adjusted separately from one another at a top roller carrier and weighting arm, of those only a single pressure value can be read off in each case on the display device at the head end of the top roller carrier and weighting arm.<br>
A simultaneous rapid check as to whether the respectively required weighting of different top rollers of a top roller carrier and weighting arm is correctly adjusted is therefore not always possible in the previously known top roller carrier and weighting arms.<br>
The object of the invention is to allow easy and rapid recognition and checking of the respectively adjusted weighting of top rollers of a top roller carrier and weighting arm at any time regardless of their position or number and regardless of the position of the top roller carrier and weighting arm.<br>
This object is achieved by a top roller carrier and weighting arm according to claim 1.<br><br><br>
Further advantageous configurations of the top roller carrier and weighting arm according to the invention are the subject of the sub-claims.<br>
A top roller carrier and weighting arm which comprises an adjustable display means for displaying the level of the weighting, which is arranged in such a way that it can be seen during operation of the drafting arrangement in a side view of the top roller carrier and weighting arm, at all times makes the adjusted loading at each top roller, in particular also at the central and feed roller of the top roller carrier and weighting arm, visible and readable. Easy and rapid checking as to whether the correct weighting is adjusted is possible at any time regardless of the position of the top rollers and regardless of the position of the top roller carrier and weighting arm. It is not necessary to interrupt the production and fold up the operating lever for checking. A weighting of different rollers of the top roller carrier and weighting arm, adjusted separately from one another in each case, can be seen at a glance. A display base part, which is configured as a display frame, and a display means, which can be adjusted inside the display frame, relative thereto, easily allow, in a rapid and clearly recognisable manner, an allocation to one of, for example, three, adjustable weighting stages. When the spacing of the top rollers is changed, the so-called field width, a displacement of the display frame together with the top roller takes place, the position of the display means relative to the display frame also remaining unchanged in the event of unchanged weighting. After a displacement of the top rollers, the display means does not have to be adjusted again nor does the weighting have to be readjusted.<br>
If the adjustment element is configured in such a way that the adjustment position of the adjustment element is changed exclusively stepwise via weighting stages, the adjusted weighting stage can be seen particularly easily and distinguished from other weighting stages.<br>
If at least one display face, which can clearly be allocated in each case to an adjustment position of the adjustment element on the basis of its appearance, is<br><br><br>
formed owing to the position of the display means with respect to the display base part, easy and rapid recognition and distinguishing of the weighting stages is possible. The allocation of the respective display face to a weighting stage can take place on the basis of the geometric shape and the position of the display face or the colour of the display face.<br>
An adjustment element which can be rotated to adjust the weighting and in which the adjustment position emerges from the angle position, is particularly suitable for adjusting the pressure weighting of a helical spring, as used for the pressure loading of the individual top rollers, and has a small space requirement.<br>
The rotary movement of the adjustment element can advantageously be converted into a linear movement of the display means in the longitudinal direction of the top roller carrier and weighting arm.<br>
If the display means is preferably arranged on at least one of the two longitudinal sides of the top roller carrier and weighting arm, it can be seen particularly easily and clearly.<br>
A preferred configuration comprises a cam, the adjustment element being connected in a rotationally engaged manner to the cam, the rotational movement of which changes the position of the display means. Avantageously, the adjustment element is either configured at least partially as a multi-sided pin, which is connected in a rotationally engaged manner to a cam plate, and, advantageously, the cam plate engages in a cutout of the display means in such a way that the position of the display means is dependent on the angle of position of the adjustment element, or the adjustment element, in an advantageous alternative configuration, comprises a head which on its lower side has a raised cam contour, which engages in a cutout of the display means in such a way that the position of the display means is dependent upon the angle position of the adjustment element. In a further advantageous alternative configuration, the adjustment element comprises a head, which has, on<br><br><br>
its lower side, an eccentrically arranged pin, the pin engaging in a slot of the display means running transversely to the possible movement direction of the display means. In another advantageous alternative configuration, the axis of rotation of the adjustment element runs transversely to the weighting direction of the spring element and an eccentric element is arranged in such a way that by means of the eccentric element, the weighting of the spring element is adjustable and the position of the display means can be changed. These configurations allow simple and reliable conversion of the rotary movement of the adjustment element into a linear movement of the display means. Both the number of components and the outlay for assembly can be kept low.<br>
If the display means has a U-shaped profile, which encompasses the also U-shaped profile of the top roller carrier and weighting arm, the display means can be mounted in a space saving manner on the top roller carrier and weighting arm and can easily be displaced and fixed together with the frame and the holding device in the longitudinal direction of the top roller carrier and weighting arm.<br>
A top roller carrier and weighting arm, which comprises an operating lever and at least one adjustment element with a head, the head being substantially covered by a display frame and the periphery of the head carrying display faces, of which one display face is visible in each case through an opening in the display frame, and wherein the operating lever in the operating position is arranged at a spacing from the U-shaped profile of the top roller carrier and weighting arm such that the display face can be seen, allows a particularly simple configuration. The outlay for a transfer of the movement of the adjustment element is not required. For example a display face, which is a coloured face, designates the adjusted angle position of the adjustment element and therefore the adjusted weighting, without requiring further components. By means of the selection of different colours, it offers diverse display possibilities.<br><br><br>
The display of the preselected weighting stage of each top roller is possible separately for each individual top roller and, regardless of the arrangement of the top roller on the top roller carrier and weighting arm can be read off and checked easily both in the working position of the drafting arrangement and when the top roller carrier and weighting arm is pivoted up.<br>
The invention allows easy comparability of the weighting stages, which are adjusted on drafting arrangements arranged next to one another for example on a spinning machine, in each case on top rollers in the same position.<br>

Fig. 1 shows a longitudinal side of the top roller carrier and weighting arm 1 of a spinning machine-drafting arrangement in the operating position with adjustable holding devices for top rollers. The associated top view in Fig. 2 shows the top roller carrier and weighting arm 1 without operating lever 14, so the carrying profile 24 of the top roller carrier and weighting arm 1 is shown in the manner in which it appears to the view of the operator when the operating lever 14 is folded up. The holding devices comprise, holders 2, 3, 4 for the respective top roller arranged as a delivery roller 11, as a central roller 12 and as a feed roller 13. The top rollers are configured as twin rollers and rotatably held with their axles 8, 9,10 in the receivers 5, 6, 7 of the holders 2, 3, 4.<br><br><br>
The holding device 15 shown separately without carrying profile 24 in the Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 for better recognisabilty, comprises a holding profile 16, a helical screw 17, an adjustment element 18, two cooperating weighting elements 19, 20, a pivot pin 21 mounted in the holding profile 16, a holder 4, which can be pivoted about the pivot pin 21, and a fastening screw 22. The fastening screw 22, apart from the holding profile 16, also fixes a display frame 23 to the carrying profile 24. A display means 25 is allocated to the display frame 23. To adjust the selected weighting stage and therefore the respective prestress of the helical spring 17, the adjustment element 18 is brought into the angle position corresponding to the weighting stage. The rotation of the head 26, having a hexagon socket, of the adjustment element 18, is carried out easily with a hexagonal wrench. The adjustment element is partially configured as a hexagonal pin 27. The hexagonal pin 27 engages in a rotationally engaged manner in the weighting element 9 and is axially secured. On its lower side, the weighting element 19 has flat steps which are connected to one another in each case by ramps, and which are distributed in a circular manner. The weighting element 19 rests axially on the weighting element 20. The weighting element 20, on its upper side facing the weighting element 19, has steps 29 also connected to one another by ramps 28, as shown in Fig. 8. By rotating the weighting element 19 relative to the weighting element 20, seen from above, counter to the clockwise direction, the weighting element 20 is pressed vertically downwardly. The weighting element 20 is guided by its sides 30, 31 by means of the side parts 32, 33 of the holding profile 16 and is therefore not rota table. On rotation of the weighting element 19 in the counter direction, the weighting element 20 is moved upwardly again under the action of the axially acting spring force of the helical spring 17. The vertical movement of the weighting element 20 results in a change in the prestressing of the helical spring 17. The weighting elements 19, 20 are configured such that the prestressig can be adjusted in three stages. The head 26 of the adjustment element 18, on its lower side has a raised cam contour 34, shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 9, adjoined by the hexagonal pin 27.<br><br><br>
In the assembled state, as shown in Figs. 3 to 6, the cam contour 35 engages in a window cutout 35 of the display means 25. The cam contour 34 and window cutout 35 are shaped in such a way that the cam contour 34 and window cutout 35 over the rotation range of the adjustment element 18, continually contact two opposing points and, therefore, in the event of a rotary movement of the adjustment element 18, this rotary movement is unambiguously converted into a linear movement of the display means 25 in the longitudinal direction of the top roller carrier and weighting arm 1 relative to the carrying profile 24. In the process, the display means 25 moves inside the display frame 23 which is fixed by the fastening screw 22 on the carrying profile 24. The head 26 of the adjustment element 18 has a nose 36, which, in conjunction with a scale 37, which is arranged on the display frame 23, facilitates a rapid and precise adjustment of the weighting stage, which is selected for prestressing the helical spring 17. During the adjustment, the manually-actuated operating lever 14 is pivoted up, the adjustment element is easily accessible from above and the position of the nose 36 and the scale 37 is easily recognisable from above for the operator. In the operating position, as shown, for example in Fig. 1, the operating lever 14 is folded down into the position shown. It covers the head 26 of the adjustment element 18 here and the scale 37. The adjusted angle position of the adjustment element 18 is thereby removed from the view of the operator as is also, therefore, the possibility, of deducing the weighting stage from the angle position. However, the position of the display means 25 in the display frame 23 can always be seen at first glance, as shown in Figs. 1, 3 or 7. The display means 25 adopts a position here in which it rests on the left-hand part of the display frame 23 in this view. This corresponds to the angle position of the adjustment element 18, in which the nose 36 is directed to the upper line of the scale 37 in the view of Figs. 2 or 4. In this state, the weighting stage is adjusted with the lowest prestress of the helical spring 17.<br>
The display means 25 comprises a constantly visible triangular face, which in the embodiment can be adjusted to three different positions corresponding to the weighting stages. Depending on the weighting stage adjusted, different display faces 86, 87, 88 are produced between the display means 25 and the display frame 23. The<br><br><br>
appearance of the display face 86, 87, 88 allows the corresponding weighting stage to be recognised easily and rapidly or to be distinguished from other weighting stages. The allocation to one weighting stage may take place on the basis of the geometric shape and the position of the display face 86, 87, 88 or the colour of the display face 86, 87, 88. Fig. 10 shows the display means 25 in the central position in the display frame 23. This position corresponds to the adjustment of the weighting stage with mean prestressing of the helical spring 17. Fig. 11 shows the display means 25 in the right-hand edge position of display frame 23. This position corresponds to the adjustment of the weighting stage with the highest prestressing of the helical spring 17. The display means 25 is guided in the movement direction in that its U-shaped profile positively encompasses the also U-shaped carrying profile 24 of the top roller carrier and weighting arm 1. The display means 25 moves inside the display frame 23, which has the same U-shaped profile as the display means 25 and limits the adjustment path of the display means 25 in the two directions. The position of the display means 25, display frame 23, carrying profile 24, holding profile 16 and adjustment element 18 with respect to one another is shown in Figs. 1, 2, 4 and 12.<br>
Fig. 13 shows a simply configured display means 38. The head of the adjustment element 39, not visible in the view of Fig. 13, on its lower side, has a pin 40. The pin 40 engages in a slot 41, which extends transversely to the movement direction of the display means 38. The adjustment element 39 passes through a centrally arranged slot 42 of the display means 38, which is oriented in the movement direction of the display means 38. The position of the display means 38 in the central position corresponds to a mean prestress. If the adjustment element 39 is rotated, the pin 40 displaces the display means relative to the display frame 23 and to the adjustment element 39. An always easily recognisable display and easy recognition of the weighting stage is also possible with this configuration.<br>
Fig. 14 shows a further alternative embodiment of the subject of the invention. The adjustment element 43 shown can be rotated about a pivot pin 80, which is mounted at its two ends in the holding profile 48, in each case. The holding profile 48 is fixed<br><br><br>
to the carrying profile 44 with the fastening screw 49. The pivot pin 80 of the adjustment element 43 extends horizontally and transversely to the longitudinal direction of the carrying profile 44 and transversely to the weighting direction of the helical spring 45. The carrying profile 44 is part of the top roller carrier and weighting arm 46. In order to make the position of interior components recognisable, the carrying profile 44 and the operating lever 40 are partly laterally cut open in the view of Fig. 14. For clarification, the detail A of Fig. 14 is shown enlarged in Fig. 14A. The adjustment element 43 is substantially configured as a disc-shaped, multi-sided eccentric 81 with the eccentric faces 82, 83, 84. The eccentric face 82 in the view of Fig. 14 or Fig. 14A rests on the base plate 85, which supports one end of the helical spring 45. If the eccentric 81 is rotated (in the view of Fig. 14A in the clockwise direction), until the eccentric face 83 rests on the base plate 85 instead of the eccentric face 82, the base plate 85 adopts a new position. Compared to the position shown in Fig. 14A, the new position is further removed from the pivot pin 80. The helical spring 45 is more compressed in the new position of the base plate 85. The weighting, with which the associated top roller is acted upon, is thereby increased. The eccentric 81 shown in the embodiment, with the eccentric faces 82, 83, 84, allows an adjustment of the weighting in three stages. The adjustment element 43 engages directly on the display means 47. If the adjustment element 43 is subjected to a rotary movement, the position of the display means 47 is changed thereby. The display means 47 in each case adopts a position in the display frame 51 corresponding to the weighting stage of the adjusted prestressing of the helical spring 45. A display brought about in the same manner can be seen with the aid of the position of the display means 47A in the display frame 51A.<br>
Top rollers, which adopt the same position on top roller carrier and weighting arms arranged next to one another in a spinning machine, for example as a delivery roller 13 in the view of Fig. 1 and 2 to the far right, are generally adjusted to the same weighting stage. Thus with the correct adjustment of the weighting stage, all the display faces 86, 87, 88, which display the specific weighting stage of the delivery rollers 13, have the same appearance. With faulty adjustment, a differing appearance<br><br><br>
of the display face 86, 87, 88 of the delivery roller 13 of a top roller carrier and weighting arm has a signalling effect and is immediately obvious.<br><br><br>

ABSTRACT<br>
The top roll support and loading arm (1) for a spinning machine drawing frame comprises holding devices for holding the top rolls. At lease one of the holding devices is assigned a spring element for loading the associated top roll. The loading takes place by means of a loading element which acts on the spring element and can be set by an adjusting element. The adjusting element is at least largely covered in the operating position of the drawing frame. There is an adjustable display means (25) for displaying the magnitude of the loading. The display means (25) can move relative to the top roll support and loading arm (1) and is coupled to the adjusting element in such a way that its position changes with the setting position of the adjusting element. The display means (25) is arranged such that it can be seen readily at any time, irrespectively of the position of the top roll support and loading arm (1).<br>
