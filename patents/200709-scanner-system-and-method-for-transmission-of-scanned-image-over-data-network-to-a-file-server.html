This invention aims at enabling a scanner device to send scanned image to a file server present in local network or via any other media (internet, wireless) using file transfer method in any of the image formats like JPEG, TIFF, PDF, etc. as specified by the user.<br>
File transfer is one of the most primary methods over the internet and is used by number of users at any time. Due to the design, different machines, using different operating systems and different hardware can exchange files efficiently in a safe manner.<br>
This invention involves:<br>
1)	Scanner sub-system:<br>
2)	User Interface:<br>
3)	File conversion module:<br>
4)	File transfer capable network client:<br>
5)	Network interface: and<br>
6)	Network connection to file server.<br>
The user will provide the information about the file server account it wants to use. This information has 3 essential parts:<br><br>
i)        File server address; ii)       User name; and iii)      Password.<br>
The scanner device connects to file server using this information and transfers the scanned image over the network. Network interface part of the scanner device has a File transfer capable network client that can connect to specified server using the information provided by the user.<br>
The physical network connection can be LAN or internet using wired or wireless connection. The overall block diagram of the scanner device is shown in Figure 3.<br>
Structure of the Invention<br>
Figure 2 shows a typical scanner system shows a scanner device connected to LAN comprising various computers/devices and workstations, which can act as file servers. The scanner device is interconnected to the file servers across the internet. A wireless device acting as file server is shown as an example. The scanned data is sent from the scanner sub system to any of the file servers across the network by file transfer method either as raw data or in JPEG, TIFF or PDF format based on the information provided by the user via user interface module of the scanner sub system.<br>
The scanner system comprises the following sub modules:<br>
a.	An interface device with User Interface (e.g. alphanumeric keyboard, touch<br>
screen and the like), to get user request and file access information;<br>
b.	Scanner subsystem for scanning the document;<br>
c.	Module to convert the file in desired format;<br>
d.	Module to connect to file server over data network and transmitting the file in<br>
electronic format.<br><br>
Operation of the Invention<br>
The main operation of the proposed invention as explained in the Figure 3 involves sending scanned images in various image formats from the scanner device to a file sen/er across LAN or internet through file transfer method. Given below is the stepwise description of the operation of the invention:<br>
•	The user feeds user account detail and optional information for required file format<br>
•	The scanner sub system scans the document whenever the document is ready and produces scanned data as bitmap image;<br>
•	The file conversion module converts the scanned data to required format i.e. JPEG, TIFF or PDF based on the format information provided by the user;<br>
•	The image is transferred to the file server across the network through file transfer agent using file transfer method. The File Transfer Protocol is platform independent and the image can be sent to different machines across the network running different Operating Systems,<br>
Operation for account information input<br>
Referring to Figure 4 the scanner device keeps waiting for the user input. If user input is the selection of File transfer mode (current invention) the flow is shown. The user can input the File server account information or it can be selected from a list. Basic validation is done for account information (e.g. IP address should be in the form a.b.c.d and a, b, c and d must not be more than 255). The steps involved are as follows:<br>
1.	A user interface(UI) is provided to allow the user to enter the file server address, the account name and password for authentication with the server;<br>
2.	Basic validation for File server address, username and password can be done at Ul;<br>
3.	Alternatively, user is allowed to select from a list of predefined accounts. The entries to this account information list may be added or deleted as required;<br><br>
4.	User may select the desired file format (e.g. TIFF, JPEG, PDF and BMP etc.) or can directly use the default format;<br>
5.	User may provide the destination file name or the scanner device generates a unique file name.<br>
Operation for scanning and file transfer<br>
In the figure 5 if the user is allowed to select the destination file format before scanning. If document is ready for scanning, the provided document is scanned and produces scanned data as bitmap referred to as raw data. If the File format conversion is needed, the data is sent to File format conversion sub-module (it is shown as Data path 1) otherwise data is directly sent to File transfer agent (it is shown as Data path 2).<br>
The scanned document is converted to the format specified by the user or to the default format. The user interface is meant for accepting valid information like file server address, user account and password as well as image formats information. A destination file name needs to be given through Ul or a unique file name is generated by adding current date and time stamp to a base name.<br>
According to Figure 6, the File transfer sub-module connects to the File server across the network via network interface which can be wired or wireless interface using account information provided by the user. If destination file name is provided by the user, it is used directly otherwise a unique name is generated by appending current date and time stamp to a base name. The file is transferred to the File server and connection is closed after completion. However, at any point of time if an error occurs, it sends appropriate information to the user.<br>
Following are some of the additional features of the proposed invention:<br>
1.	A default server can be used if all the scanned images are to be sent to one system (for example, a file server in an organization).<br>
2.	A default user name and password (may be anonymous user account) can be used.<br><br>
3.	Different image formats (TIFF, PDF, JPEG, bmp etc.) can be used for scanned image data,<br>
4.	The File transfer can be time scheduled if enough memory is available to store the scanned file and continue with the normal operation.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a computer, printer or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br>
