FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to rapidly dissolving films and methods of their preparation.<br>
The films contain an active ingredient that is evenly distributed throughout the film. The<br>
even or uniform distribution is achieved by controlling one or more parameters, and<br>
particularly the elimination of air pockets prior to and during film formation and the use of a<br>
drying process that reduces aggregation or conglomeration of the components in the film as it<br>
forms into a solid structure. The drying process further permits exposure of the film to<br>
temperatures above that at which the active ingredient typically would degrade without loss<br>
of a desired level of activity.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE RELATED TECHNOLOGY<br>
Active ingredients, such as drugs or pharmaceuticals, may be prepared in a tablet<br>
form to allow for accurate and consistent dosing. However, this form of preparing and<br><br>
dispensing medications has many disadvantages including that a large proportion of<br>
adjuvants that must be added to obtain a size able to be handled, that a larger medication form<br>
requires additional storage space, and that dispensing includes counting the tablets which has<br>
a tendency for inaccuracy. In addition, many persons, estimated to be as much as 28% of the<br>
population, have difficulty swallowing tablets. While tablets may be broken into smaller<br>
pieces or even crushed as a means of overcoming swallowing difficulties, this is not a<br>
suitable solution for many tablet or pill forms. For example, crushing or destroying the tablet<br>
or pill form to facilitate ingestion, alone or in admixture with food, may also destroy the<br>
controlled release properties.<br>
As an alternative to tablets and pills, films may be used to carry active ingredients<br>
such as drugs, pharmaceuticals, and the like. However, historically films and the process of<br>
making drug delivery systems therefrom have suffered from a number of unfavorable<br>
characteristics that have not allowed them to be used in practice.<br>
Films that incorporate a pharmaceutically active ingredient are disclosed in expired<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,136,145 to Fuchs, et al. ("Fuchs"). These films may be formed into a sheet,<br>
dried and then cut into individual doses. The Fuchs disclosure alleges the fabrication of a<br>
uniform film, which includes the combination of water-soluble polymers, surfactants, flavors,<br>
sweeteners, plasticizers and drugs. These allegedly flexible films are disclosed as being<br>
useful for oral, topical or enteral use. Examples of specific uses disclosed by Fuchs include<br>
application of the films to mucosal membrane areas of the body, including the mouth, rectal,<br>
vaginal, nasal and ear areas.<br>
Examination of films made in accordance with the process disclosed in Fuchs,<br>
however, reveals that such films suffer from the aggregation or conglomeration of particles,<br>
i.e., self-aggregation, making them inherently non-uniform. This result can be attributed to<br>
Fuchs' process parameters, which although not disclosed likely include the use of relatively<br>
long drying times, thereby facilitating intermolecular attractive forces, convection forces, air<br>
flow and the like to form such agglomeration.<br>
The formation of agglomerates randomly distributes the film components and any<br>
active present as well. When large dosages are involved, a small change in the dimensions of<br>
the film would lead to a large difference in the amount of active per film. If such films were<br><br>
to include low dosages of active, it is possible that portions of the film may be substantially<br>
devoid of any active. Since sheets of film are usually cut into unit doses, certain doses may<br>
therefore be devoid of or contain an insufficient amount of active for the recommended<br>
treatment. Failure to achieve a high degree of accuracy with respect to the amount of active<br>
ingredient in the cut film can be harmful to the patient. For this reason, dosage forms formed<br>
by processes such as Fuchs, would not likely meet the stringent standards of governmental or<br>
regulatory agencies, such as the U.S. Federal Drug Administration ("FDA"), relating to the<br>
variation of active in dosage forms. Currently, as required by various world regulatory<br>
authorities, dosage forms may not vary more than 10% in the amount of active present.<br>
When applied to dosage units based on films, this virtually mandates that uniformity in the<br>
film be present.<br>
The problems of self-aggregation leading to non-uniformity of a film were addressed<br>
in U.S. Patent No. 4,849,246 to Schmidt ("Schmidt"). Schmidt specifically pointed out that<br>
the methods disclosed by Fuchs did not provide a uniform film and recognized that that the<br>
creation of a non-uniform film necessarily prevents accurate dosing, which as discussed<br>
above is especially important in the pharmaceutical area. Schmidt abandoned the idea that a<br>
mono-layer film, such as described by Fuchs, may provide an accurate dosage form and<br>
instead attempted to solve this problem by forming a multi-layered film. Moreover, his<br>
process is a multi-step process that adds expense and complexity and is not practical for<br>
commercial use.<br>
Other U.S. Patents directly addressed the problems of particle self-aggregation and<br>
non-uniformity inherent in conventional film forming techniques. In one attempt to<br>
overcome non-uniformity, U.S. Patent 5,629,003 to Horstmann et al. and U.S. Patent<br>
5,948,430 to Zerbe et al. incorporated additional ingredients, i.e. gel formers and polyhydric<br>
alcohols respectively, to increase the viscosity of the film prior to drying in an effort to<br>
reduce aggregation of the components in the film. These methods have the disadvantage of<br>
requiring additional components, which translates to additional cost and manufacturing steps.<br>
Furthermore, both methods employ the use the conventional time-consuming drying methods<br>
such as a high-temperature air-bath using a drying oven, drying tunnel, vacuum drier, or other<br>
such drying equipment. The long length of drying time aids in promoting the aggregation of<br>
the active and other adjuvant, notwithstanding the use of viscosity modifiers. Such processes<br>
also run the risk of exposing the active, i.e., a drug, or vitamin C, or other components to<br><br>
prolonged exposure to moisture and elevated temperatures, which may render it ineffective or<br>
even harmful.<br>
In addition to the concerns associated with degradation of an active during extended<br>
exposure to moisture, the conventional drying methods themselves are unable to provide<br>
uniform films. The length of heat exposure during conventional processing, often referred to<br>
as the "heat history", and the manner in which such heat is applied, have a direct effect on the<br>
formation and morphology of the resultant film product. Uniformity is particularly difficult<br>
to achieve via conventional drying methods where a relatively thicker film, which is well-<br>
suited for the incorporation of a drug active, is desired. Thicker uniform films are more<br>
difficult to achieve because the surfaces of the film and the inner portions of the film do not<br>
experience the same external conditions simultaneously during drying. Thus, observation of<br>
relatively thick films made from such conventional processing shows a non-uniform structure<br>
caused by convection and intermolecular forces and requires greater than 10% moisture to<br>
remain flexible. The amount of free moisture can often interfere over time with the drug<br>
leading to potency issues and therefore inconsistency in the final product.<br>
Conventional drying methods generally include the use of forced hot air using a<br>
drying oven, drying tunnel, and the like. The difficulty in achieving a uniform film is directly<br>
related to the rheologjcal properties and the process of water evaporation in the film-forming<br>
composition. When the surface of an aqueous polymer solution is contacted with a high<br>
temperature air current, such as a film-forming composition passing through a hot air oven,<br>
the surface water is immediately evaporated forming a polymer film or skin on the surface.<br>
This seals the remainder of the aqueous film-forming composition beneath the surface,<br>
forming a barrier through which the remaining water must force itself as it is evaporated in<br>
order to achieve a dried film. As the temperature outside the film continues to increase, water<br>
vapor pressure builds up under the surface of the film, stretching the surface of the film, and<br>
ultimately ripping the film surface open allowing the water vapor to escape. As soon as the<br>
water vapor has escaped, the polymer film surface reforms, and this process is repeated, until<br>
the film is completely dried. The result of the repeated destruction and reformation of the<br>
film surface is observed as a "ripple effect" which produces an uneven, and therefore non-<br>
uniform film. Frequently, depending on the polymer, a surface will seal so tightly that the<br>
remaining water is difficult to remove, leading to very long drying times, higher<br>
temperatures, and higher energy costs.<br><br>
Other factors, such as mixing techniques, also play a role in the manufacture of a<br>
pharmaceutical film suitable for commercialization and regulatory approval. Air can be<br>
trapped in the composition during the mixing process or later during the film making process,<br>
which can leave voids in the film product as the moisture evaporates during the drying stage.<br>
The film frequently collapse around the voids resulting in an uneven film surface and<br>
therefore, non-uniformity of the final film product. Uniformity is still affected even if the<br>
voids in the film caused by air bubbles do not collapse. This situation also provides a non-<br>
uniform film in that the spaces, which are not uniformly distributed, are occupying area that<br>
would otherwise be occupied by the film composition. None of the above-mentioned patents<br>
either addresses or proposes a solution to the problems caused by air that has been introduced<br>
to the film.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for methods and compositions for film products, which use<br>
a minimal number of materials or components, and which provide a substantially non-self-<br>
aggregating uniform heterogeneity throughout the area of the films. Desirably, such films are<br>
produced through a selection of a polymer or combination of polymers that will provide a<br>
desired viscosity, a film-forming process such as reverse roll coating, and a controlled, and<br>
desirably rapid, drying process which serves to maintain the uniform distribution of non-self-<br>
aggregated components without the necessary addition of gel formers or polyhydric alcohols<br>
and the like which appear to be required in the products and for the processes of prior patents,<br>
such as the aforementioned Horstmann and Zerbe patents. Desirably, the films will also<br>
incorporate compositions and methods of manufacture that substantially reduce or eliminate<br>
air in the film, thereby promoting uniformity in the final film product.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
For the purposes of the present invention the term non-self-aggregating uniform<br>
heterogeneity refers to the ability of the films of the present invention, which are formed from<br>
one or more components in addition to a polar solvent, to provide a substantially reduced<br>
occurrence of, i.e. little or no, aggregation or conglomeration of components within the film<br>
as is normally experienced when films are formed by conventional drying methods such as a<br>
high-temperature air-bath using a drying oven, drying tunnel, vacuum drier, or other such<br>
drying equipment. The term heterogeneity, as used in the present invention, includes films<br>
that will incorporate a single component, such as a polymer, as well as combinations of<br>
components, such as a polymer and an active. Uniform heterogeneity includes the substantial<br>
absence of aggregates or conglomerates as is common in conventional mixing and heat<br>
drying methods used to form films.<br>
Furthermore, the films of the present invention have a substantially uniform thickness,,<br>
which is also not provided by the use of conventional drying methods used for drying water-<br>
based polymer systems. The absence of a uniform thickness detrimentally affects uniformity<br>
of component distribution throughout the area of a given film.<br>
The film products of the present invention are produced by a combination of a<br>
properly selected polymer and a polar solvent, optionally including an active ingredient as<br>
well as other fillers known in the art. These films provide a non-self-aggregating uniform<br>
heterogeneity of the components within them by utilizing a selected casting or deposition<br>
method and a controlled drying process. Examples of controlled drying processes include,<br>
but are not limited to, the use of the apparatus disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,631,837 to<br>
Magoon ("Magoon"), herein incorporated by reference, as well as hot air impingement across<br>
the bottom substrate and bottom heating plates. Another drying technique for obtaining the<br>
films of the present invention is controlled radiation drying, in the absence of uncontrolled air<br>
currents, such as infrared and radio frequency radiation (i.e. microwaves).<br><br>
The objective of the drying process is to provide a method of drying the films that<br>
avoids complications, such as the noted "rippling" effect, that are associated with<br>
conventional drying methods and which initially dry the upper surface of the film, trapping<br>
moisture inside. In conventional oven drying methods, as the moisture trapped inside<br>
subsequently evaporates, the top surface is altered by being ripped open and then reformed.<br>
These complications are avoided by the present invention, and a uniform film is provided by<br>
drying the bottom surface of the film first or otherwise preventing the formation of polymer<br>
film formation (skin) on the top surface of the film prior to drying the depth of the film. This<br>
may be achieved by applying heat to the bottom surface of the film with substantially no top<br>
air flow, or alternatively by the introduction of controlled microwaves to evaporate the water<br>
or other polar solvent within the film, again with substantially no top air flow. Yet<br>
alternatively, drying may be achieved by using balanced fluid flow, such as balanced air<br>
flow, where the bottom and top air flows are controlled to provide a uniform film. In such a<br>
case, the air flow directed at the top of the film should not create a condition which would<br>
cause movement of particles present in the wet film, due to forces generated by the air<br>
currents. Additionally, air currents directed at the bottom of the film should desirably be<br>
controlled such that the film does not lift up due to forces from the air. Uncontrolled air<br>
currents, either above or below the film, can create non-uniformity in the final film products.<br>
The humidity level of the area surrounding the top surface may also be appropriately adjusted<br>
to prevent premature closure or skinning of the polymer surface.<br>
This manner of drying the films provides several advantages. Among these are the<br>
faster drying times and a more uniform surface of the film, as well as uniform distribution of<br>
components for any given area in the film. In addition, the faster drying time allows viscosity<br>
to quickly build within the film, further encouraging a uniform distribution of components<br>
and decrease in aggregation of components in the final film product. Desirably, the drying of<br>
the film will occur within about ten minutes or fewer, or more desirably within about five<br>
minutes or fewer.<br>
The present invention yields exceptionally uniform film products when attention is<br>
paid to reducing the aggregation of the compositional components. By avoiding the<br>
introduction of and eliminating excessive air in the mixing process, selecting polymers and<br>
solvents to provide a controllable viscosity and by drying the film in a rapid manner from the<br>
bottom up, such films result.<br><br>
The products and processes of the present invention rely on the interaction among<br>
various steps of the production of the films in order to provide films that substantially reduce<br>
the self-aggregation of the components within the films. Specifically, these steps include the<br>
particular method used to form the film, making the composition mixture to prevent air<br>
bubble inclusions, controlling the viscosity of the film forming composition and the method<br>
of drying the film. More particularly, a greater viscosity of components in the mixture is<br>
particularly useful when the active is not soluble in the selected polar solvent in order to<br>
prevent the active from settling out However, the viscosity must not be too great as to hinder<br>
or prevent the chosen method of casting, which desirably includes reverse roll coating due to<br>
its ability to provide a film of substantially consistent thickness.<br>
In addition to the viscosity of the film or film-forming components or matrix, there<br>
are other considerations taken into account by the present invention for achieving desirable<br>
film uniformity. For example, stable suspensions are achieved which prevent solid (such as<br>
drug particles) sedimentation in non-colloidal applications. One approach provided by the<br>
present invention is to balance the density of the particulate (pp) and the liquid phase (pO and<br>
increase the viscosity of the liquid phase (µ). For an isolated particle, Stokes law relates the<br>
terminal settling velocity (Vo) of a rigid spherical body of radius (r) in a viscous fluid, as<br>
follows:<br>
V0-(2grT)(pp-p1)/9µ<br>
At high particle concentrations, however, the local particle concentration will affect<br>
the local viscosity and density. The viscosity of the suspension is a strong function of solids<br>
volume fraction, and particle-particle and particle-liquid interactions will further hinder<br>
settling velocity.<br>
Stokian analyses has shown that the incorporation of a third phase, dispersed air or<br>
nitrogen, for example, promotes suspension stability. Further, increasing the number of<br>
particles leads to a hindered settling effect based on the solids volume fraction. In dilute<br>
particle suspensions, the rate of sedimentation, v, can be expressed as:<br>
v/V0= 1/(1+k)<br><br>
where K = a constant, and φ is the volume fraction of the dispersed phase. More particles<br>
suspended in the liquid phase results in decreased velocity. Particle geometry is also an<br>
important factor since the particle dimensions will affect particle-particle flow interactions.<br>
Similarly, the viscosity of the suspension is dependent on the volume fraction of<br>
dispersed solids. For dilute suspensions of non-interaction spherical particles, an expression<br>
for the suspension viscosity can be expressed as:<br>
µ/µo-1+2.5*<br>
where µo is the viscosity of the continuous phase and  is the solids volume fraction. At<br>
higher volume fractions, the viscosity of the dispersion can be expressed as<br>
µ/µo=1+ 2.5φ + C1φ2 + C2φ3 +	<br>
where C is a constant.<br>
The viscosity of the liquid phase is critical and is desirably modified by customizing<br>
the liquid composition to a viscoelastic non-Newtonian fluid with low yield stress values.<br>
This is the equivalent of producing a high viscosity continuous phase at rest Formation of a<br>
viscoelastic or a highly structured fluid phase provides additional resistive forces to particle<br>
sedimentation. Further, flocculation or aggregation can be controlled minimizing particle-<br>
particle interactions. The net effect would be the preservation of a homogeneous dispersed<br>
phase.<br>
The addition of hydrocolloids to the aqueous phase of the suspension increases<br>
viscosity, may produce viscoelasticity and can impart stability depending on the type of<br>
hydrocolloid, its concentration and the particle composition, geometry, size, and volume<br>
fraction. The particle size distribution of the dispersed phase needs to be controlled by<br>
selecting the smallest realistic particle size in the high viscosity medium, i.e., 
presence of a slight yield stress or elastic body at low shear rates may also induce permanent<br>
stability regardless of the apparent viscosity. The critical particle diameter can be calculated<br>
from the yield stress values. In the case of isolated spherical particles, the maximum shear<br>
stress developed in settling through a medium of given viscosity can be given as<br>
Tmax = 3Vµ/2r<br>
For pseudoplastic fluids, the viscosity in this shear stress regime may well be the zero shear<br>
rate viscosity at the Newtonian plateau.<br><br>
A stable suspension is an important characteristic for the manufacture of a pre-mix<br>
composition which is to be fed into the film casting machinery film, as well as the<br>
maintenance of this stability in the wet film stage until sufficient drying has occurred to<br>
lock-in the particles and matrix into a sufficiently solid form such that uniformity is<br>
maintained. For viscoelastic fluid systems, a rheology that yields stable suspensions for<br>
extended time period, such as 24 hours, must be balanced with the requirements of high-<br>
speed film casting operations. A desirable property for the films is shear thinning or<br>
pseudoplasticity, whereby the viscosity decreases with increasing shear rate. Time dependent<br>
shear effects such as thixotropy are also advantageous. Structural recovery and shear<br>
thinning behavior are important properties, as is the ability for the film to self-level as it is<br>
formed.<br>
The rheology requirements for the inventive compositions and films are quite severe.<br>
This is due to the need to produce a stable suspension of particles, for example 30-60 wt%, in<br>
a viscoelastic fluid matrix with acceptable viscosity values throughout a broad shear rate<br>
range. During mixing, pumping, and film casting, shear rates in the range of 10 - 10s sec.'1<br>
may be experienced and pseudoplasticity is the preferred embodiment.<br>
In film casting or coating, rheology is also a defining factor with respect to the ability<br>
to form films with the desired uniformity. Shear viscosity, extensional viscosity,<br>
viscoelasticity, structural recovery will influence the quality of the film. As an illustrative<br>
example, the leveling of shear-thinning pseudoplastic fluids has been derived as<br><br>
where a is the surface wave amplitude, , is the initial amplitude, X is the wavelength of the<br>
surface roughness, and both "n" and "K" are viscosity power law indices. In this example,<br>
leveling behavior is related to viscosity, increasing as n decreases, and decreasing with<br>
increasing K.<br>
Desirably, the films or film-forming compositions of the present invention have a<br>
very rapid structural recovery, i.e. as the film is formed during processing, it doesn't fall apart<br>
or become discontinuous in its structure and compositional uniformity. Such very rapid<br>
structural recovery retards particle settling and sedimentation. Moreover, the films or film-<br><br>
forming compositions of the present invention are desirably shear-thinning pseudoplastic<br>
fluids. Such fluids with consideration of properties, such as viscosity and elasticity, promote<br>
thin film formation and uniformity.<br>
Thus, uniformity in the mixture of components depends upon numerous variables. As<br>
described herein, viscosity of the components, the mixing techniques and the Theological<br>
properties of the resultant mixed composition and wet casted film are important aspects of the<br>
present invention. Additionally, control of particle size and particle shape are further<br>
considerations. Desirably, the size of the particulate a particle size of 150 microns or less, for<br>
example 100 microns or less. Moreover, such particles may be spherical, substantially<br>
spherical, or non-spherical, such as irregularly shaped particles or ellipsoidally shaped<br>
particles. Ellipsoidally shaped particles or ellipsoids are desirable because of their ability to<br>
maintain uniformity in the film forming matrix as they tend to settle to a lesser degree as<br>
compared to spherical particles.<br>
A number of techniques may be employed in the mixing stage to prevent bubble<br>
inclusions in the final film. To provide a composition mixture with substantially no air<br>
bubble formation in the final product, anti-foaming or surface-tension reducing agents are<br>
employed. Additionally, the speed of the mixture is desirably controlled to prevent cavitation<br>
of the mixture in a manner which pulls air into the mix. Finally, air bubble reduction can<br>
further be achieved by allowing the mix to stand for a sufficient time for bubbles to escape<br>
prior to drying the film. Desirably, the inventive process first forms a masterbatch of film-<br>
forming components without active ingredients such as drug particles or volatile materials<br>
such as flavor oils. The actives are added to smaller mixes of the masterbatch just prior to<br>
casting. Thus, the masterbatch pre-mix can be allowed to stand for a longer time without<br>
concern for instability in drug or other ingredients.<br>
When the matrix is formed including the film-forming polymer and polar solvent in<br>
addition to any additives and the active ingredient, this may be done in a number of steps.<br>
For example, the ingredients may all be added together or a pre-mix may be prepared. The<br>
advantage of a pre-mix is that all ingredients except for the active may be combined in<br>
advance, with the active added just prior to formation of the film. This is especially<br>
important for actives that may degrade with prolonged exposure to water, air or another polar<br>
solvent.<br><br>
Figure 6 shows an apparatus 20 suitable for the preparation of a pre-raix, addition of<br>
an active and subsequent formation of a film. The pre-mix or master batch 22, which<br>
includes the film-forming polymer, polar solvent, and any other additives except a drug<br>
active is added to the master batch feed tank 24. The components for pre-mix or master batch<br>
22 are desirably formed in a mixer (not shown) prior to their addition into the master batch<br>
feed tank 24. Then a pre-determined amount of the master batch is controllably fed via a first<br>
metering pump 26 and control valve 28 to cither or both of the first and second mixers, 30,<br>
30'. The present invention, however, is not limited to the use of two mixers, 30, 30', and any<br>
number of mixers may suitably be used. Moreover, the present invention is not limited to any<br>
particular sequencing of the mixers 30, 30', such as parallel sequencing as depicted in Figure<br>
6, and other sequencing or arrangements of mixers, such as series or combination of parallel<br>
and series, may suitably be used. The required amount of the drug or other ingredient, such<br>
as a flavor, is added to the desired mixer through an opening, 32, 32', in each of the mixers,<br>
30, 30'. Desirably, the residence time of the pre-mix or master batch 22 is minimized in the<br>
mixers 30, 30'. While complete dispersion of the drug into the pre-mix or master batch 22 is<br>
desirable, excessive residence times may result in leaching or dissolving of the drug,<br>
especially in the case for a soluble drug. Thus, the mixers 30, 30' are often smaller, i.e. lower<br>
residence times, as compared to the primary mixers (not shown) used in forming the pre-mix<br>
or master batch 22. After the drug has been blended with the master batch pre-mix for a<br>
sufficient time to provide a uniform matrix, a specific amount of the uniform matrix is then<br>
fed to the pan 36 through the second metering pumps, 34, 34'. The metering roller 38<br>
determines the thickness of the film 42 and applies it to the application roller. The film 42 is<br>
finally formed on the substrate 44 and carried away via the support roller 46.<br>
While the proper viscosity uniformity in mixture and stable suspension of particles,<br>
and casting method are important in the initial steps of forming the composition and film to<br>
promote uniformity, the method of drying the wet film is also important. Although these<br>
parameters and properties assist uniformity initially, a controlled rapid drying process ensures<br>
that the uniformity will be maintained until the film is dry.<br>
The wet film is then dried using controlled bottom drying or controlled microwave<br>
drying, desirably in the absence of external air currents or heat on the top (exposed) surface<br>
of the film 48 as described herein. Controlled bottom drying or controlled microwave drying<br><br>
advantageously allows for vapor release from the film without the disadvantages of the prior<br>
art. Conventional convection air drying from the top is not employed because it initiates<br>
drying at the top uppermost portion of the film, thereby forming a barrier against fluid flow,<br>
such as the evaporative vapors, and thermal flow, such as the thermal energy for drying.<br>
Such dried upper portions serve as a barrier to further vapor release as the portions beneath<br>
are dried, which results in non-uniform films. As previously mentioned some top air flow<br>
can be used to aid the drying of the films of the present invention, but it must not create a<br>
condition that would cause particle movement or a rippling effect in the film, both of which<br>
would result in non-uniformity. If top air is employed, it is balanced with the bottom air<br>
drying to avoid non-uniformity and prevent film lift-up on the carrier belt. A balance top and<br>
bottom air flow may be suitable where the bottom air flow functions as the major source of<br>
drying and the top air flow is the minor source of drying. The advantage of some top air flow<br>
is to move the exiting vapors away from the film thereby aiding in the overall drying process.<br>
The use of any top air flow or top drying, however, must be balanced by a number of factors<br>
including, but not limited, to rheological properties of the composition and mechanical<br>
aspects of the processing. Any top fluid flow, such as air, also must not overcome the<br>
inherent viscosity of the film-forming composition. In other words, the top air flow cannot<br>
break, distort or otherwise physically disturb the surface of the composition. Moreover, air<br>
velocities are desirably below the yield values of the film, i.e., below any force level that can<br>
move the liquids in the film-forming compositions. For thin or low viscosity compositions,<br>
low air velocity must be used. For thick or high viscosity compositions, higher air velocities<br>
may be used. Furthermore, air velocities are desirable low so as to avoid any lifting or other<br>
movement of the film formed from the compositions.<br>
Moreover, the films of the present invention may contain particles that are sensitive to<br>
temperature, such as flavors, which may be volatile, or drugs, which may have a low<br>
degradation temperature. In such cases, the drying temperature may be decreased while<br>
increasing the drying time to adequately dry the uniform films of the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, bottom drying also tends to result in a lower internal film temperature as<br>
compared to top drying. In bottom drying, the evaporating vapors more readily carry heat<br>
away from the film as compared to top drying which lowers the internal film temperature.<br>
Such lower internal film temperatures often result in decreased drug degradation and<br>
decreased loss of certain volatiles, such as flavors.<br><br>
During film preparation, it may be desirable to dry films at high temperatures. High<br>
heat drying produces uniform films, and leads to greater efficiencies in film production.<br>
Films containing sensitive active components, however, may face degradation problems at<br>
high temperatures. Degradation is the "decomposition of a compound ... exhibiting well-<br>
defined intermediate products." The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language<br>
(4* ed. 2000). Degradation of an active component is typically undesirable as it may cause<br>
instability, inactivity, and/or decreased potency of the active component. For instance, if the<br>
active component is a drug or bioactive material, this may adversely affect the safety or<br>
efficacy of the final pharmaceutical product. Additionally, highly volatile materials will tend<br>
to be quickly released from this film upon exposure to conventional drying methods.<br>
Degradation of an active component may occur through a variety of processes, such<br>
as, hydrolysis, oxidation, and light degradation, depending upon the particular active<br>
component. Moreover, temperature has a significant effect on the rate of such reactions. The<br>
rate of degradation typically doubles for every 10°C increase in temperature. Therefore, it is<br>
commonly understood that exposing an active component to high temperatures will initiate<br>
and/or accelerate undesirable degradation reactions.<br>
Proteins are one category of useful active ingredients that will degrade, denature, or<br>
otherwise become inactive when they are exposed to high temperatures for extended periods<br>
of time. Proteins serve a variety of functions in the body such as enzymes, structural<br>
elements, hormones and immunoglobulins. Examples of proteins include enzymes such as<br>
pancreatin, trypsin, pancrelipase, chymotrypsin, hyaluronidase, sutilains, streptokinaw,<br>
urokinase, altiplase, papain, bromelainsdiastase, structural elements such as collagen and<br>
albumin, hormones such as thyroliberin, gonadoliberin, adrenocorticottropin, corticotrophin,<br>
cosyntropin, sometrem, somatropion, prolactin, thyrotropin, somatostatin, vasopressin,<br>
felypressin, lypressin, insulin, glucagons, gastrin, pentagastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin-<br>
pancreozymin, and immunomodulators which may include polysaccharides in addition to<br>
glycoproteins including cytokines which are useful for the inhibition and prevention of<br>
malignant cell growth such as tumor growth. A suitable method for the production of some<br>
useful glycoproteins is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,281,337 to Cannon-Carlson, et al.,<br>
which in incorporated herein in its entirety.<br><br>
Temperatures that approach 100°C will generally cause degradation of proteins as<br>
well as nucleic acids. For example some glycoproteins will degrade if exposed to a<br>
temperature of 70°C for thirty minutes. Proteins from bovine extract are also known to<br>
degrade at such low temperatures. DNA also begins to denature at this temperature.<br>
Applicants have discovered, however, that the films of the present invention may be<br>
exposed to high temperatures during the drying process without concern for degradation, loss<br>
of activity or excessive evaporation due to the inventive process for film preparation and<br>
forming. In particular, the films may be exposed to temperatures that would typically lead to<br>
degradation, denaturization, or inactivity of the active component, without causing such<br>
problems. According to the present invention, the manner of drying may be controlled to<br>
prevent deleterious levels of heat from reaching the active component<br>
As discussed herein, the flowable mixture is prepared to be uniform in content in<br>
accordance with the teachings of the present invention. Uniformity must be maintained as<br>
the flowable mass was formed into a film and dried. During the drying process of the present<br>
invention, several factors produce uniformity within the film while maintaining the active<br>
component at a safe temperature, i.e., below its degradation temperature. First, the films of<br>
the present invention have an extremely short heat history, usually only on the order of<br>
minutes, so that total temperature exposure is minimized to the extent possible. The films are<br>
controllably dried to prevent aggregation and migration of components, as well as preventing<br>
heat build up within. Desirably, the films are dried from the bottom. Controlled bottom<br>
drying, as described herein, prevents the formation of a polymer film, or skin, on the top<br>
surface of the film. As heat is conducted from the film bottom upward, liquid carrier, e.g.,<br>
water, rises to the film surface. The absence of a surface skin permits rapid evaporation of<br>
the liquid carrier as the temperature increases, and thus, concurrent evaporative cooling of the<br>
film. Due to the short heat exposure and evaporative cooling, the film components such as<br>
drag or volatile actives remain unaffected by high temperatures. In contrast, skinning on the<br>
top surface traps liquid carrier molecules of increased energy within the film, thereby causing<br>
the temperature within the film to rise and exposing active components to high, potentially<br>
deleterious temperatures.<br>
Second, thermal mixing occurs within the film due to bottom heating and absence of<br>
surface skinning. Thermal mixing occurs via convection currents in the film. As heat is<br><br>
applied to the bottom of the film, the liquid near the bottom increases in temperature,<br>
expands, and becomes less dense. As such, this hotter liquid rises and cooler liquid takes its<br>
place. While rising, the hotter liquid mixes with the cooler liquid and shares thermal energy<br>
with it, i.e., transfers heat. As the cycle repeats, thermal energy is spread throughout the film.<br>
Robust thermal mixing achieved by the controlled drying process of the present<br>
invention produces uniform heat diffusion throughout the film. In the absence of such<br>
thermal mixing, "hot spots" may develop. Pockets of heat in the film result in the formation<br>
of particle aggregates or danger areas within the film and subsequent non-uniformity. The<br>
formation of such aggregates or agglomerations is undesirable because it leads to non-<br>
uniform films in which the active may be randomly distributed. Such uneven distribution<br>
may lead to large differences in the amount of active per film, which is problematic from a<br>
safety and efficacy perspective.<br>
Furthermore, thermal mixing helps to maintain a lower overall temperature inside the<br>
film. Although the film surfaces may be exposed to a temperature above that at which the<br>
active component degrades, the film interior may not reach this temperature. Due to this<br>
temperature differential, the active does not degrade.<br>
Fig. 8 is a sequential representation of the drying process of the present invention.<br>
After mechanical mixing, the film may be placed on a conveyor for continued thermal mixing<br>
during the drying process. At the outset of the drying process, depicted in Section A, the film<br>
1 preferably is heated from the bottom 10 as it is travels via conveyor (not shown). Heat may<br>
be supplied to the film by a heating mechanism, such as, but not limited to, the dryer depicted<br>
in Fig. 7. As the film is heated, the liquid carrier, or volatile ("V"), begins to evaporate, as<br>
shown by upward arrow 50. Thermal mixing also initiates as hotter liquid, depicted by arrow<br>
30, rises and cooler liquid, depicted by arrow 40, takes its place. Because no skin forms on<br>
the top surface 20 of the film 1, as shown in Section B the volatile liquid continues to<br>
evaporate 50 and thermal mixing 30/40 continues to distribute thermal energy throughout the<br>
film. Once a sufficient amount of the volatile liquid has evaporated, thermal mixing has<br>
produced uniform heat diffusion throughout the film 1. The resulting dried film 1 is a visco-<br>
elastic solid, as depicted in Section C. The components desirably are locked into a uniform<br>
distribution throughout the film. Although minor amounts of liquid carrier, i.e., water, may<br><br>
remain subsequent to formation of the visco-elastic, the film may be dried further without<br>
movement of the particles, if desired.<br>
Furthermore, particles or particulates may be added to the film-forming composition<br>
or matrix after the composition or matrix is cast into a film. For example, particles may be<br>
added to the film 42 prior to the drying of the film 42. Particles may be controllably metered<br>
to the film and disposed onto the film through a suitable technique, such as through the use of<br>
a doctor blade (not shown) which is a device which marginally or softly touches the surface<br>
of the film and controllably disposes the particles onto the film surface. Other suitable, but<br>
non-limiting, techniques include the use of an additional roller to place the particles on the<br>
film surface, spraying the particles onto the film surface, and the like. The particles may be<br>
placed on either or both of the opposed film surfaces, i.e., the top and/or bottom film<br>
surfaces. Desirably, the particles are securably disposed onto the film, such as being<br>
embedded into the film. Moreover, such particles are desirably not fully encased or fully<br>
embedded into the film, but remain exposed to the surface of the film, such as in the case<br>
where the particles are partially embedded or partially encased.<br>
The particles may be any useful organoleptic agent, cosmetic agent, pharmaceutical<br>
agent, or combinations thereof. Desirably, the pharmaceutical agent is a taste-masked or a<br>
controlled-release pharmaceutical agent. Useful organoleptic agents include flavors and<br>
sweeteners. Useful cosmetic agents include breath freshening or decongestant agents, such as<br>
menthol, including menthol crystals.<br>
Although the inventive process is not limited to any particular apparatus for the<br>
above-described desirable drying, one particular useful drying apparatus SO is depicted in<br>
Figure 7. Drying apparatus SO is a nozzle arrangement for directing hot fluid, such as but not<br>
limited to hot air, towards the bottom of the film 42 which is disposed on substrate 44. Hot<br>
air enters the entrance end 52 of the drying apparatus and travels vertically upward, as<br>
depicted by vectors 54, towards air deflector 56. The air deflector 56 redirects the air<br>
movement to minimize upward force on the film 42. As depicted in Figure 7, the air is<br>
tangentially directed, as indicated by vectors 60 and 60', as the air passes by air deflector 56<br>
and enters and travels through chamber portions 58 and 58' of the drying apparatus 50. With<br>
the hot air flow being substantially tangential to the film 42, lifting of the film as it is being<br>
dried is thereby minimized. While the air deflector 56 is depicted as a roller, other devices<br><br>
and geometries for deflecting air or hot fluid may suitable be used. Furthermore, the exit<br>
ends 62 and 62' of the drying apparatus 50 are flared downwardly. Such downward flaring<br>
provides a downward force or downward velocity vector, as indicated by vectors 64 and 64',<br>
which tend to provide a pulling or drag effect of the film 42 to prevent lifting of the film 42.<br>
Lifting of the film 42 may not only result in non-uniformity in the film or otherwise, but may<br>
also result in non-controlled processing of the film 42 as the film 42 and/or substrate 44 lift<br>
away from the processing equipment.<br>
Monitoring and control of the thickness of the film also contributes to the production<br>
of a uniform film by providing a film of uniform thickness. The thickness of the film may be<br>
monitored with gauges such as Beta Gauges. A gauge may be coupled to another gauge at<br>
the end of the drying apparatus, i.e. drying oven or tunnel, to communicate through feedback<br>
loops to control and adjust the opening in the coating apparatus, resulting in control of<br>
uniform film thickness.<br>
The film products are generally formed by combining a properly selected polymer and<br>
polar solvent, as well as any active ingredient or filler as desired. Desirably, the solvent<br>
content of the combination is at least about 30% by weight of the total combination. The<br>
matrix formed by this combination is formed into a film, desirably by roll coating, and then<br>
dried, desirably by a rapid and controlled drying process to maintain the uniformity of the<br>
film, more specifically, a non-self-aggregating uniform heterogeneity. The resulting film will<br>
desirably contain less than about 10% by weight solvent, more desirably less than about 8%<br>
by weight solvent, even more desirably less than about 6% by weight solvent and most<br>
desirably less than about 2%. The solvent may be water, a polar organic solvent including,<br>
but not limited to, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone, methylene chloride, or any combination<br>
thereof.<br>
Consideration of the above discussed parameters, such as but not limited to rheology<br>
properties, viscosity, mixing method, casting method and drying method, also impact<br>
material selection for the different components of the present invention. Furthermore, such<br>
consideration with proper material selection provides the compositions of the present<br>
invention, including a pharmaceutical and/or cosmetic dosage form or film product having no<br>
more than a 10% variance of a pharmaceutical and/or cosmetic active per unit area. In other<br>
words, the uniformity of the present invention is determined by the presence of no more than<br><br>
a 10% by weight of pharmaceutical and/or cosmetic variance throughout the matrix.<br>
Desirably, the variance is less than 5% by weight, less than 2% by weight, less than 1% by<br>
weight, or less than 0.5% by weight.<br>
Film-Forming Polymers<br>
The polymer may be water soluble, water swellable, water insoluble, or a combination<br>
of one or more either water soluble, water swellable or water insoluble polymers. The<br>
polymer may include cellulose or a cellulose derivative. Specific examples of useful water<br>
soluble polymers include, but are not limited to, pullulan, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, sodium aginate, polyethylene glycol, xanthan gum, tragancanth<br>
gum, guar gum, acacia gum, arabic gum, polyacrylic acid, methylmethacrylate copolymer,<br>
carboxyvinyl copolymers, starch, gelatin, and combinations thereof. Specific examples of<br>
useful water insoluble polymers include, but are not limited to, ethyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxypropyl ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose<br>
phthalate and combinations thereof.<br>
As used herein the phrase "water soluble polymer" and variants thereof refer to a<br>
polymer that is at least partially soluble in water, and desirably fully or predominantly soluble<br>
in water, or absorbs water. Polymers that absorb water are often referred to as being water<br>
swellable polymers. The materials useful with the present invention may be water soluble or<br>
water swellable at room temperature and other temperatures, such as temperatures exceeding<br>
room temperature. Moreover, the materials may be water soluble or water swellable at<br>
pressures less than atmospheric pressure. Desirably, the water soluble polymers are water<br>
soluble or water swellable having at least 20 percent by weight water uptake. Water<br>
swellable polymers having a 25 or greater percent by weight water uptake are also useful.<br>
Films or dosage forms of the present invention formed from such water soluble polymers are<br>
desirably sufficiently water soluble to be dissolvable upon contact with bodily fluids.<br>
Other polymers useful for incorporation into the films of the present invention include<br>

Other specific polymers useful include those marketed under the Medisorb and Biodel<br>
trademarks. The Medisorb materials are marketed by the Dupont Company of Wilmington,<br>
Delaware and are generically identified as a "lactide/glycolide co-polymer" containing<br>
"propanoic acid, 2-hydroxy-polymer with hydroxy-polymer with hydroxyacetic acid." Four<br>
such polymers include lactide/glycolide 100L, believed to be 100% lactide having a melting<br>
point within the range of 338°-347°F (170°-175dC); lactide/glycolide 100L, believed to be<br>
100% glycolide having a melting point within the range of 437°-455°F (225°-235°C);<br>
lactide/glycolide 85/15, believed to be 85% lactide and 15% glycolide with a melting point<br>
within the range of 338°-347°F (170°-175° C); and lactide/glycolide 50/50, believed to be a<br>
copolymer of 50% lactide and 50% glycolide with a melting point within the range of 338°-<br>
347°F(170°-175°C).<br>
The Biodel materials represent a family of various polyanhydrides which differ<br>
chemically.<br>
Although a variety of different polymers may be used, it is desired to select polymers<br>
to provide a desired viscosity of the mixture prior to drying. For example, if the active or<br>
other components are not soluble in the selected solvent, a polymer that will provide a greater<br>
viscosity is desired to assist in maintaining uniformity. On the other hand, if the components<br>
are soluble in the solvent, a polymer that provides a lower viscosity may be preferred.<br>
The polymer plays an important role in affecting the viscosity of the film. Viscosity is<br>
one property of a liquid that controls the stability of the active in an emulsion, a colloid or a<br>
suspension. Generally the viscosity of the matrix will vary from about 400 cps to about<br><br>
100,000 cps, preferably from about 800 cps to about 60,000 cps, and most preferably from<br>
about 1,000 cps to about 40,000 cps. Desirably, the viscosity of the film-forming matrix will<br>
rapidly increase upon initiation of the drying process.<br>
The viscosity may be adjusted based on the selected active depending on the other<br>
components within the matrix. For example, if the component is not soluble within the<br>
selected solvent, a proper viscosity may be selected to prevent the component from settling<br>
which would adversely affect the uniformity of the resulting film. The viscosity may be<br>
adjusted in different ways. To increase viscosity of the film matrix, the polymer may be<br>
chosen of a higher molecular weight or crosslinkers may be added, such as salts of calcium,<br>
sodium and potassium. The viscosity may also be adjusted by adjusting the temperature or<br>
by adding a viscosity increasing component. Components that will increase the viscosity or<br>
stabilize the emulsion/suspension include higher molecular weight polymers and<br>
polysaccharides and gums, which include without limitation, alginate, carrageenan,<br>
hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, locust bean gum, guar gum, xanthan gum, dextran, gum<br>
arabic, gellan gum and combinations thereof.<br>
It has also been observed that certain polymers which when used alone would<br>
ordinarily require a plasticizer to achieve a flexible film, can be combined without a<br>
plasticizer and yet achieve flexible films. For example, HPMC and HPC when used in<br>
combination provide a flexible, strong film with the appropriate plasticity and elasticity for<br>
manufacturing and storage. No additional plasticizer or polyalcohol is needed for flexibility.<br>
Controlled Release Films<br>
The term "controlled release" is intended to mean the release of active at a pre-<br>
selected or desired rate. This rate will vary depending upon the application. Desirable rates<br>
include fast or immediate release profiles as well as delayed, sustained or sequential release.<br>
Combinations of release patterns, such as initial spiked release followed by lower levels of<br>
sustained release of active are contemplated. Pulsed drug releases are also contemplated.<br>
The polymers that are chosen for the films of the present invention may also be<br>
chosen to allow for controlled disintegration of the active. This may be achieved by<br>
providing a substantially water insoluble film that incorporates an active that will be released<br>
from the film over time. This may be accomplished by incorporating a variety of different<br><br>
soluble or insoluble polymers and may also include biodegradable polymers in combination.<br>
Alternatively, coated controlled release active particles may be incorporated into a readily<br>
soluble film matrix to achieve the controlled release property of the active inside the digestive<br>
system upon consumption.<br>
Films that provide a controlled release of the active are particularly useful for buccal,<br>
gingival, sublingual and vaginal applications. The films of the present invention are<br>
particularly useful where mucosal membranes or mucosal fluid is present due to their ability<br>
to readily wet and adhere to these areas.<br>
The convenience of administering a single dose of a medication which releases active<br>
ingredients in a controlled fashion over an extended period of time as opposed to the<br>
administration of a number of single doses at regular intervals has long been recognized in<br>
the pharmaceutical arts. The advantage to the patient and clinician in having consistent and<br>
uniform blood levels of medication over an extended period of time are likewise recognized.<br>
The advantages of a variety of sustained release dosage forms are well known. However, the<br>
preparation of a film that provides the controlled release of an active has advantages in<br>
addition to those well-known for controlled release tablets. For example, thin films are<br>
difficult to inadvertently aspirate and provide an increased patient compliance because they<br>
need not be swallowed like a tablet. Moreover, certain embodiments of the inventive films<br>
are designed to adhere to the buccal cavity and tongue, where they controllably dissolve.<br>
Furthermore, thin films may not be crushed in the manner of controlled release tablets which<br>
is a problem leading to abuse of drugs such as Oxycontin.<br>
The actives employed in the present invention may be incorporated into the film<br>
compositions of the present invention in a controlled release form. For example, particles of<br>
drug may be coated with polymers such as ethyl cellulose or polymethacrylate, commercially<br>
available under brand names such as Aquacoat ECD and Eudragit E-100, respectively.<br>
Solutions of drug may also be absorbed on such polymer materials and incorporated into the<br>
inventive film compositions. Other components such as fats and waxes, as well as<br>
sweeteners and/or flavors may also be employed in such controlled release compositions.<br>
The actives may be taste-masked prior to incorporation into the film composition, as<br>
set forth in co-pending PCT application titled, Uniform Films For Rapid Dissolve Dosage<br><br>
Form Incorporating Taste-Masking Compositions, (based on U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. Express Mail Label No.: EU552991605 US of the same title, filed September 27, 2003,<br>
attorney docket No. 1199-15P) the entire subject matter of which is incorporated by reference<br>
herein.<br>
Actives<br>
When an active is introduced to the film, the amount of active per unit area is<br>
determined by the uniform distribution of the film. For example, when the films are cut into<br>
individual dosage forms, the amount of the active in the dosage form can be known with a<br>
great deal of accuracy. This is achieved because the amount of the active in a given area is<br>
substantially identical to the amount of active in an area of the same dimensions in another<br>
part of the film. The accuracy in dosage is particularly advantageous when the active is a<br>
medicament, i.e. a drug.<br>
The active components that may be incorporated into the films of the present<br>
invention include, without limitation pharmaceutical and cosmetic actives, drugs,<br>

especially where the active is photosensitive.<br>
Cosmetic active agents may include breath freshening compounds like menthol, other<br>
flavors or fragrances, especially those used for oral hygiene, as well as actives used in dental<br>
and oral cleansing such as quaternary ammonium bases. The effect of flavors may be<br>

Also color additives can be used in preparing the films. Such color additives include<br>
food, drug and cosmetic colors (FD&amp;C), drug and cosmetic colors (D&amp;C), or external drug<br>
and cosmetic colors (Ext. D&amp;C). These colors are dyes, their corresponding lakes, and<br>
certain natural and derived colorants. Lakes are dyes absorbed on aluminum hydroxide.<br>
Other examples of coloring agents include known azo dyes, organic or inorganic<br>
pigments, or coloring agents of natural origin. Inorganic pigments are preferred, such as the<br>
oxides or iron or titanium, these oxides, being added in concentrations ranging from about<br>

K), and sodium and calcium salts thereof, and natural intensive sweeteners, such as Lo Han<br>
Kuo. Other sweeteners may also be used.<br>
When the active is combined with the polymer in the solvent, the type of matrix that<br>
is formed depends on the solubilities of the active and the polymer. If the active and/or<br>
polymer are soluble in the selected solvent, this may form a solution. However, if the<br>
components are not soluble, the matrix may be classified as an emulsion, a colloid, or a<br>
suspension.<br>
Dosages<br>
The film products of the present invention are capable of accommodating a wide<br>
range of amounts of the active ingredient. The films are capable of providing an accurate<br>
dosage amount (determined by the size of the film and concentration of the active in the<br>
original polymer/water combination) regardless of whether the required dosage is high or<br>
extremely low. Therefore, depending on the type of active or pharmaceutical composition<br>
that is incorporated into the film, the active amount may be as high as about 300mg, desirably<br>
up to about 150mg or as low as the microgram range, or any amount therebetween.<br><br>
The film products and methods of the present invention are well suited for high<br>
potency, low dosage drugs. This is accomplished through the high degree of uniformity of<br>
the films. Therefore, low dosage drugs, particularly more potent racemic mixtures of actives<br>
are desirable.<br>
Anti-foaming and De-foaming Compositions<br>
Anti-foaming and/or de-foaming components may also be used with the films of the<br>
present invention. These components aid in the removal of air, such as entrapped air, from<br>
the film-forming compositions. As described above, such entrapped air may lead to non-<br>
uniform films. Simethicone is one particularly useful anti-foaming and/or de-foaming agent.<br>
The present invention, however, is not so limited and other anti-foam and/or de-foaming<br>
agents may suitable be used.<br>
Simethicone is generally used in the medical field as a treatment for gas or colic in<br>
babies. Simethicone is a mixture of fully methylated linear siloxane polymers containing<br>
repeating units of polydimethylsiloxane which is stabilized with trimethylsiloxy end-blocking<br>
unites, and silicon dioxide. It usually contains 90.5-99% polymethylsiloxane and 4-7%<br>
silicon dioxide. The mixture is a gray, translucent, viscous fluid which is insoluble in water.<br>
When dispersed in water, simethicone will spread across the surface, forming a thin<br>
film of low surface tension. In this way, simethicone reduces the surface tension of bubbles<br>
air located in the solution, such as foam bubbles, causing their collapse. The function of<br>
simethicone mimics the dual action of oil and alcohol in water. For example, in an oily<br>
solution any trapped air bubbles will ascend to the surface and dissipate more quickly and<br>
easily, because an oily liquid has a lighter density compared to a water solution. On the other<br>
hand, an alcohol/water mixture is known to lower water density as well as lower the water's<br>
surface tension. So, any air bubbles trapped inside this mixture solution will also be easily<br>
dissipated. Simethicone solution provides both of these advantages. It lowers the surface<br>
energy of any air bubbles that trapped inside the aqueous solution, as well as lowering the<br>
surface tension of the aqueous solution. As the result of this unique<br>
functionality, simethicone has an excellent anti-foaming property that can be used for<br>
physiological processes (anti-gas in stomach) as well as any for external processes that<br>
require the removal of air bubbles from a product.<br><br>
In order to prevent the formation of air bubbles in the films of the present invention,<br>
the mixing step can be performed under vacuum. HoweVer, as soon as the mixing step is<br>
completed, and the film solution is returned to the normal atmosphere condition, air will be<br>
re-introduced into or contacted with the mixture. In many cases, tiny air bubbles will be<br>
again trapped inside this polymeric viscous solution. The incorporation of simethicone into<br>
the film-forming composition either substantially reduces or eliminates the formation of air<br>
bubbles.<br>
Simethicone may be added to the film-forming mixture as an anti-foaming agent in an<br>
amount from about 0.01 weight percent to about S.O weight percent, more desirably from<br>
about 0. 05 weight percent to about 2.5 weight percent, and most desirably from about 0. 1<br>
weight percent to about 1.0 weight percent.<br>
Optional Components<br>
A variety of other components and fillers may also be added to the films of the<br>
present invention. These may include, without limitation, surfactants; plasticizers which<br>
assist in compatibilizing the components within the mixture; polyalcohols; anti-foaming<br>
agents, such as silicone-containing compounds, which promote a smoother film surface by<br>
releasing oxygen from the film; and thermo-setting gels such as pectin, carageenan, and<br>
gelatin, which help in maintaining the dispersion of components.<br>
The variety of additives that can be incorporated into the inventive compositions may<br>
provide a variety of different functions. Examples of classes of additives include excipients,<br>
lubricants, buffering agents, stabilizers, blowing agents, pigments, coloring agents, fillers,<br>
bulking agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, fragrances, release modifiers, adjuvants,<br>
plasticizers, flow accelerators, mold release agents, polyols, granulating agents, diluents,<br>
binders, buffers, absorbents, glidants, adhesives, anti-adherents, acidulants, softeners, resins,<br>
demulcents, solvents, surfactants, emulsifiers, elastomers and mixtures thereof. These<br>
additives may be added with the active ingredient(s).<br>
Useful additives include, for example, gelatin, vegetable proteins such as sunflower<br>
protein, soybean proteins, cotton seed proteins, peanut proteins, grape seed proteins, whey<br>
proteins, whey protein isolates, blood proteins, egg proteins, acrylated proteins, water-soluble<br><br>
polysaccharides such as alginates, carrageenans, guar gum, agar-agar, xanthan gum, gellan<br>
gum, gum arabic and related gums (gum ghatti, gum karaya, gum tragancanth), pectin, water-<br>
soluble derivatives of cellulose: alkylcelluloses hydroxyalkylcelluloses and<br>
hydroxyalkylalkylcelluloses, such as methylcelulose, hydroxymethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxyethylmethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxybutylmethylcellulose, cellulose esters and<br>
hydroxyalkylcellulose esters such as cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP),<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC); carboxyalkylcelluloses,<br>
carboxyalkylalkylcelluloses, carboxyalkylcellulose esters such as carboxymethylcellulose<br>
and their alkali metal salts; water-soluble synthetic polymers such as polyacrylic acids and<br>

suitable are phthalated gelatin, gelatin succinate, crosslinked gelatin, shellac, water soluble<br>
chemical derivatives of starch, cationically modified acrylates and methacrylates possessing,<br>
for example, a tertiary or quaternary amino group, such as the diethylaminoethyl group,<br>
which may be quaternized if desired; and other similar polymers.<br>
Such extenders may optionally be added in any desired amount desirably within the<br>
range of up to about 80%, desirably about 3% to 50% and more desirably within the range of<br>
3% to 20% based on the weight of all components.<br>
Further additives may be inorganic fillers, such as the oxides of magnesium<br>
aluminum, silicon, titanium, etc. desirably in a concentration range of about 0.02% to about<br>
3% by weight and desirably about 0.02% to about 1% based on the weight of all components.<br>
Further examples of additives are plasticizers which include polyalkylene oxides,<br>
such as polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols, polyethylene-propylene glycols, organic<br>
plasticizers with low molecular weights, such as glycerol, glycerol monoacetate, diacetate or<br>
triacetate, triacetin, polysorbate, cetyl alcohol, propylene glycol, sorbitol, sodium<br>
diethylsulfosuccinate, triethyl citrate, tributyl citrate, and the like, added in concentrations<br>
ranging from about 0.5% to about 30%, and desirably ranging from about 0.5% to about 20%<br>
based on the weight of the polymer.<br><br>
There may further be added compounds to improve the flow properties of the starch<br>
material such as animal or vegetable fats, desirably in their hydrogenated form, especially<br>
those which are solid at room temperature. These fats desirably have a melting point of 50°C<br>
or higher. Preferred are tri-glycerides with C12-, C14-, C16-, Q18-, C20- and C22- fatty acids.<br>
These fats can be added alone without adding extenders or plasticizers and can be<br>
advantageously added alone or together with mono- and/or di-glycerides or phosphatides,<br>
especially lecithin. The mono- and di-glycerides are desirably derived from the types of fats<br>
described above, i.e. with C12-, C14-, C16-, C18-, C20- and C22- fatty acids.<br>
The total amounts used of the fats, mono-, di-glycerides and/or lecithins are up to<br>
about 5% and preferably within the range of about 0.5% to about 2% by weight of the total<br>
composition<br>
It is further useful to add silicon dioxide, calcium silicate, or titanium dioxide in a<br>
concentration of about 0.02% to about 1% by weight of the total composition. These<br>
compounds act as texturizing agents.<br>
These additives are to be used in amounts sufficient to achieve their intended purpose.<br>
Generally, the combination of certain of these additives will alter the overall release profile of<br>
the active ingredient and can be used to modify, i.e. impede or accelerate the release.<br>
Lecithin is one surface active agent for use in the present invention. Lecithin can be<br>
included in the feedstock in an amount of from about 0.25% to about 2.00% by weight.<br>
Other surface active agents, i.e. surfactants, include, but are not limited to, cetyl alcohol,<br>
sodium lauryl sulfate, the Spans™ and Tweens™ which are commercially available from ICI<br>
Americas, Inc. Ethoxylated oils, including ethoxylated castor oils, such as Cremophor® EL<br>
which is commercially available from BASF, are also useful. Carbowax™ is yet another<br>
modifier which is very useful in the present invention. Tweens™ or combinations of surface<br>
active agents may be used to achieve the desired hydrophilic-lipophilic balance ("HLB").<br>
The present invention, however, does not require the use of a surfactant and films or film-<br>
forming compositions of the present invention may be essentially free of a surfactant while<br>
still providing the desirable uniformity features of the present invention.<br><br>
As additional modifiers which enhance the procedure and product of the present<br>
invention are identified, Applicants intend to include all such additional modifiers within the<br>
scope of the invention claimed herein.<br>
Other ingredients include binders which contribute to the ease of formation and<br>
general quality of the films. Non-limiting examples of binders include starches, pregelatinize<br>
starches, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
ethylcellulose, polyacrylamides, polyvinyloxoazolidone, and polyvinylalcohols.<br>
Forming the Film<br>
The films of the present invention must be formed into a sheet prior to drying. After<br>
the desired components are combined to form a multi-component matrix, including the<br>
polymer, water, and an active or other components as desired, the combination is formed into<br>
a sheet or film, by any method known in the art such as extrusion, coating, spreading, casting<br>
or drawing the multi-component matrix. If a multi-layered film is desired, this may be<br>
accomplished by co-extruding more than one combination of components which may be of<br>
the same or different composition. A multi-layered film may also be achieved by coating,<br>
spreading, or casting a combination onto an already formed film layer.<br>
Although a variety of different film-forming techniques may be used, it is desirable to<br>
select a method that will provide a flexible film, such as reverse roll coating. The flexibility<br>
of the film allows for the sheets of film to be rolled and transported for storage or prior to<br>
being cut into individual dosage forms. Desirably, the films will also be self-supporting or in<br>
other words able to maintain their integrity and structure in the absence of a separate support.<br>
Furthermore, the films of the present invention may be selected of materials that are edible or<br>
ingestible.<br>
Coating or casting methods are particularly useful for the purpose of forming the<br>
films of the present invention. Specific examples include reverse roll coating, gravure<br>
coating, immersion or dip coating, metering rod or meyer bar coating, slot die or extrusion<br>
coating, gap or knife over roll coating, air knife coating, curtain coating, or combinations<br>
thereof, especially when a multi-layered film is desired.<br>
Roll coating, or more specifically reverse roll coating, is particularly desired when<br>
forming films in accordance with the present invention. This procedure provides excellent<br><br>
control and uniformity of the resulting films, which is desired in the present invention. In this<br>
procedure, the coating material is measured onto the applicator roller by the precision setting<br>
of the gap between the upper metering roller and the application roller below it. The coating<br>
is transferred from the application roller to the substrate as it passes around the support roller<br>
adjacent to the application roller. Both three roll and four roll processes are common.<br>
The gravure coating process relies on an engraved roller running in a coating bath,<br>
which fills the engraved dots or lines of the roller with the coating material. The excess<br>
coating on the roller is wiped off by a doctor blade and the coating is then deposited onto the<br>
substrate as it passes between the engraved roller and a pressure roller.<br>
Offset Gravure is common, where the coating is deposited on an intermediate roller<br>
before transfer to the substrate.<br>
In the simple process of immersion or dip coating, the substrate is dipped into a bath<br>
of the coating, which is normally of a low viscosity to enable the coating to run back into the<br>
bath as the substrate emerges.<br>
In the metering rod coating process, an excess of the coating is deposited onto the<br>
substrate as it passes over the bath roller. The wire-wound metering rod, sometimes known<br>
as a Meyer Bar, allows the desired quantity of the coating to remain on the substrate. The<br>
quantity is determined by the diameter of the wire used on the rod.<br>
In the slot die process, the coating is squeezed out by gravity or under pressure<br>
through a slot and onto the substrate. If the coating is 100% solids, the process is termed<br>
"Extrusion" and in this case, the line speed is frequently much faster than the speed of the<br>
extrusion. This enables coatings to be considerably thinner than the width of the slot.<br>
The gap or knife over roll process relies on a coating being applied to the substrate<br>
which then passes through a "gap" between a "knife" and a support roller. As the coating and<br>
substrate pass through, the excess is scraped off.<br><br>
Air knife coating is where the coating is applied to the substrate and the excess is<br>
"blown off' by a powerful jet from the air knife. This procedure is useful for aqueous<br>
coatings.<br>
In the curtain coating process, a bath with a slot in the base allows a continuous<br>
curtain of the coating to fall into the gap between two conveyors. The object to be coated is<br>
passed along the conveyor at a controlled speed and so receives the coating on its upper face.<br>
Drying the Film<br>
The drying step is also a contributing factor with regard to maintaining the uniformity<br>
of the film composition. A controlled drying process is particularly important when, in the<br>
absence of a viscosity increasing composition or a composition in which the viscosity is<br>
controlled, for example by the selection of the polymer, the components within the film may<br>
have an increased tendency to aggregate or conglomerate. An alternative method of forming<br>
a film with an accurate dosage, that would not necessitate the controlled drying process,<br>
would be to cast the films on a predetermined well. With this method, although the<br>
components may aggregate, this will not result in the migration of the active to an adjacent<br>
dosage form, since each well may define the dosage unit per se.<br>
When a controlled or rapid drying process is desired, this may be through a variety of<br>
methods. A variety of methods may be used including those that require the application of<br>
heat. The liquid carriers are removed from the film in a manner such that the uniformity, or<br>
more specifically, the non-self-aggregating uniform heterogeneity, that is obtained in the wet<br>
film is maintained.<br>
Desirably, the film is dried from the bottom of the film to the top of the film.<br>
Desirably, substantially no air flow is present across the top of the film during its initial<br>
setting period, during which a solid, visco-elastic structure is formed. This can take place<br>
within the first few minutes, e.g. about the first 0.5 to about 4.0 minutes of the drying<br>
process. Controlling the drying in this manner, prevents the destruction and reformation of<br>
the film's top surface, which results from conventional drying methods. This is accomplished<br>
by forming the film and placing it on the top side of a surface having top and bottom sides.<br>
Then, heat is initially applied to the bottom side of the film to provide the necessary energy to<br>
evaporate or otherwise remove the liquid carrier. The films dried in this manner dry more<br><br>
quickly and evenly as compared to air-dried films, or those dried by conventional drying<br>
means. In contrast to an air-dried film that dries first at the top and edges, the films dried by<br>
applying heat to the bottom dry simultaneously at the center as well as at the edges. This also<br>
prevents settling of ingredients that occurs with films dried by conventional means.<br>
The temperature at which the films are dried is about 100oC or less, desirably about<br>
90°C or less, and most desirably about 80°C or less.<br>
Another method of controlling the drying process, which may be used alone or in<br>
combination with other controlled methods as disclosed above includes controlling and<br>
modifying the humidity within the drying apparatus where the film is being dried. In this<br>
manner, the premature drying of the top surface of the film is avoided.<br>
Additionally, it has also been discovered that the length of drying time can be<br>
properly controlled, i.e. balanced with the heat sensitivity and volatility of the components,<br>
and particularly the flavor oils and drugs. The amount of energy, temperature and length and<br>
speed of the conveyor can be balanced to accommodate such actives and to minimize loss,<br>
degradation or ineffectiveness in the final film.<br>
A specific example of an appropriate drying method is that disclosed by Magoon.<br>
Magoon is specifically directed toward a method of drying fruit pulp. However, the present<br>
inventors have adapted this process toward the preparation of thin films.<br>
The method and apparatus of Magoon are based on an interesting property of water.<br>
Although water transmits energy by conduction and convection both within and to its<br>
surroundings, water only radiates energy within and to water. Therefore, the apparatus of<br>
Magoon includes a surface onto which the fruit pulp is placed that is transparent to infrared<br>
radiation. The underside of the surface is in contact with a temperature controlled water bath.<br>
The water bath temperature is desirably controlled at a temperature slightly below the boiling<br>
temperature of water. When the wet fruit pulp is placed on the surface of the apparatus, this<br>
creates a "refractance window." This means that infrared energy is permitted to radiate<br>
through the surface only to the area on the surface occupied by the fruit pulp, and only until<br>
the fruit pulp is dry. The apparatus of Magoon provides the films of the present invention<br><br>
with an efficient drying time reducing the instance of aggregation of the components of the<br>
film.<br>
The films may initially have a thickness of about 500 urn to about 1,500 urn, or about<br>
20 mils to about 60 mils, and when dried have a thickness from about 3 urn to about 250 urn,<br>
or about 0.1 mils to about lOmils. Desirably, the dried films will have a thickness of about 2<br>
mils to about 8 mils, and more desirably, from about 3 mils to about 6 mils.<br>
Uses of Thin Films<br>
The thin films of the present invention are well suited for many uses. The high degree<br>
of uniformity of the components of the film makes them particularly well suited for<br>
incorporating pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, the polymers used in construction of the films<br>
may be chosen to allow for a range of disintegration times for the films. A variation or<br>
extension in the time over which a film will disintegrate may achieve control over the rate<br>
that the active is released, which may allow for a sustained release delivery system. In<br>
addition, the films may be used for the administration of an active to any of several body<br>
surfaces, especially those including mucous membranes, such as oral, anal, vaginal,<br>
ophthalmologjcal, the surface of a wound, either on a skin surface or within a body such as<br>
during surgery, and similar surfaces.<br>
The films may be used to orally administer an active. This is accomplished by<br>
preparing the films as described above and introducing them to the oral cavity of a mammal.<br>
This film may be prepared and adhered to a second or support layer from which it is removed<br>
prior to use, i.e. introduction to the oral cavity. An adhesive may be used to attach the film to<br>
the support or backing material which may be any of those known in the art, and is preferably<br>
not water soluble. If an adhesive is used, it will desirably be a food grade adhesive that is<br>
ingestible and does not alter the properties of the active. Mucoadhesive compositions are<br>
particularly useful. The film compositions in many cases serve as mucoadhesives<br>
themselves.<br>
The films may be applied under or to the tongue of the mammal. When this is<br>
desired, a specific film shape, corresponding to the shape of the tongue may be preferred.<br>
Therefore the film may be cut to a shape where the side of the film corresponding to the back<br>
of the tongue will be longer than the side corresponding to the front of the tongue.<br><br>
Specifically, the desired shape may be that of a triangle or trapezoid. Desirably, the film will<br>
adhere to the oral cavity preventing it from being ejected from the oral cavity and permitting<br>
more of the active to be introduced to the oral cavity as the film dissolves.<br>
Another use for the films of the present invention takes advantage of the films'<br>
tendency to dissolve quickly when introduce to a liquid. An active may be introduced to a<br>
liquid by preparing a film in accordance with the present invention, introducing it to a liquid,<br>
and allowing it to dissolve. This may be used either to prepare a liquid dosage form of an<br>
active, or to flavor a beverage.<br>
The films of the present invention are desirably packaged in sealed, air and moisture<br>
resistant packages to protect the active from exposure oxidation, hydrolysis, volatilization<br>
and interaction with the environment. Referring to Figure 1, a packaged pharmaceutical<br>
dosage unit 10, includes each film 12 individually wrapped in a pouch or between foil and/or<br>
plastic laminate sheets 14. As depicted in Figure 2, the pouches 10, 10' can be linked<br>
together with tearable or perforated joints 16. The pouches 10,10'may be packaged in a roll<br>
as depicted in Figure S or stacked as shown in Figure 3 and sold in a dispenser 18 as shown in<br>
Figure 4. The dispenser may contain a full supply of the medication typically prescribed for<br>
the intended therapy, but due to the thinness of the film and package, is smaller and more<br>
convenient than traditional bottles used for tablets, capsules and liquids. Moreover, the films<br>
of the present invention dissolve instantly upon contact with saliva or mucosal membrane<br>
areas, eliminating the need to wash the dose down with water.<br>
Desirably, a series of such unit doses are packaged together in accordance with the<br>
prescribed regimen or treatment, e.g., a 10-90 day supply, depending on the particular<br>
therapy. The individual films can be packaged on a backing and peeled off for use.<br>
The features and advantages of the present invention are more fully shown by the<br>
following examples which are provided for purposes of illustration, and are not to be<br>
construed as limiting the invention in any way.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Examples A-I:<br><br><br>
The ingredients of inventive compositions A-I were combined by mixing until a<br>
uniform mixture was achieved. The compositions were then formed into a film by reverse<br>
roll coating. These films were then dried on the top side of an infrared transparent surface,<br>
the bottom side of which was in contact with a heated water bath at approximately 99°C. No<br>
external thermal air currents were present above the film. The films were dried to less than<br>
about 6% by weight water in about 4 to 6 minutes. The films were flexible, self-supporting<br>
and provided a uniform distribution of the components within the film.<br>
The uniform distribution of the components within the film was apparent by<br>
examination by either the naked eye or under slight magnification. By viewing the films it<br>
was apparent that they were substantially free of aggregation, i.e. the carrier and the actives<br>
remained substantially in place and did not move substantially from one portion of the film to<br><br>
water, the films rapidly dissolve which provides a flavored drink when the active is chosen to<br>
be a flavoring.<br>
Examples J-L:<br>
Thin films that have a controlled degradation time and include combinations of water<br>
soluble and water insoluble polymers and water soluble films that allow controlled release of<br>
an active are prepared using approximately the amounts described in Table 3.<br><br>
The components of inventive compositions J-L were combined and formed into films<br>
using the methods for preparing inventive compositions A-I above. These films were also<br>
flexible, self-supporting and provided a uniform distribution of active which permits accuracy<br>
in dosing.<br>
The uniformity of the films prepared from inventive compositions J-L may also be<br>
tested by either visual means measuring the weights of individual dosage films, or by<br>
dissolving the films and testing for the amount of active as described above.<br>
Examples M-O:<br>
An alternative method of preparing films which provides an accurate dosing may be<br>
used for any of inventive compositions A-I. The method begins with first combining the<br>
ingredients with mixing. The combination of ingredients is then divided among individual<br>
wells or molds. In such a method, aggregation of the components during drying is prevented<br>
by the individual wells.<br><br><br>
The ingredients in the above Table 4 were combined and formed into a film by<br>
casting the combination of ingredients onto the glass surface and applying heat to the bottom<br>
side of the glass. This provided inventive compositions M-O.<br>
The film of composition M was examined both prior to and after drying for variations<br>
in the shading provided by the red dye. The film was examined both under sunlight and by<br>
incandescent bulb light. No variations in shade or intensity of color were observed.<br>
Further testing of the films of composition M included Resting of absorption which is<br>
directly related to concentration. The film was cut into segments each measuring 1.0 in. by<br>
0.75 in., which were consecutively assigned numbers. Approximately 40 mg of the scrap<br>
material from which the segments were cut was dissolved in about 10 ml of distilled water<br>
and then quantitatively transferred to a 25 ml volumetric flask and brought to volume. The<br>
solution was centrifuged and scanned at 3nm intervals from 203-1200nm. The frequency of<br>
maximum absorption was found to be 530nm. The solution was then re-centrifuged at a<br>
higher RPM (for the same length of time) and re-scanned, which demonstrated no change in<br>
the % transmission or frequency.<br><br>
Each of the segments were weighed to 0.1mg and then dissolved in 10ml distilled<br>
water and transferred quantitatively to a 25 ml volumetric flask and brought to volume with<br>
distilled water. Each segment solution was then centrifuged as above, and then scanned, at<br>
first from 203-1200nm and later from only 500nm to 550nm at a lnm scanning speed. The<br>
value recorded was the % transmission at the lowest wave length, which was most frequently<br>
530nm.<br><br>
The overall average absorption was 1.724. Of the 15 segments tested, the difference<br>
between the highest and lowest values was 0.073 units, or 4% based on the average. This<br>
shows excellent control over the uniformity of the dye within the composition because the<br>
absorption is directly proportional to the concentration of the dye within each segment.<br>
The film of inventive composition N provided a very flexible film. This film was able<br>
to be stretched and exhibited a very high tensile strength.<br>
After forming the film of inventive composition O, the film was removed from the<br>
glass by very rapidly stripping the length of the glass with a razor. This provided very tightly<br>
wound "toothpick-like" dosage forms. Each dosage form consistently weighed 0.02 g. This<br>
demonstrates the uniformity of the dosage forms as well as the superior self-supporting<br>
properties of the films.<br>
Examples P-W:<br><br>
Compositions P-W were prepared to demonstrate the interaction among various<br>
conditions in production of films as they relate to the present invention. The ingredients in<br>
the below Table 6 were combined and formed into a film using the process parameters listed<br>
in Table 7 below, prepared in a 6m drying tunnel designed to incorporate bottom drying of<br>
the films. Each of the examples shows the effect of different ingredient formulations and<br>
processing techniques on the resultant film products.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
In Table 7, each of the process parameters contributes to different properties of the<br>
films. Film thickness refers to the distance between the blade and the roller in the reverse roll<br>
coating apparatus. Bottom velocity and top velocity refer to the speed of air current on the<br>
bottom and top sides of the film, respectively. The film weight is a measure of the weight of<br>
a circular section of the substrate and the film of 100 cm2.<br><br>
Compositions P-R show the effects of visco-elastic properties on the ability to coat<br>
the film composition mixture onto the substrate for film formation. Composition P displayed<br>
a stringy elastic property. The wet film would not stay level, the coating was uneven, and the<br>
film did not dry. In Composition Q, substantially the same formulation as P was used<br>
however the xanthan was not included. This product coated the substrate but would not stay<br>
level due to the change in the visco-elastic properties of the wet foam. Composition R was<br>
prepared using substantially the same formulation, but incorporated one-half of the amount of<br>
xanthan of Composition P. This formulation provided a composition that could be evenly<br>
coated. Compositions P-Q demonstrate the importance of proper formulation on the ability<br>
of the film matrix to conform to a particular coating technique.<br>
The films produced from Composition S contained a large amount of air in the films.<br>
This is shown by the dried film thickness which was the same despite that variation in the<br>
coated thickness as in Table 7. Microscopic examination of the film revealed a large number<br>
of air bubbles in the film. In order to correct for the addition of air in the films, care must be<br>
taken in the mixing process to avoid air inclusion.<br>
Composition T included a change in the solvent to 60/40 water ethanol. Composition<br>
T was stirred slowly for 45min. to deaerate the mixture. The dried weight film products T1<br>
and T2 were consistent with the increase in solids from Tl to T2. The films dried much<br>
faster with less than 5% moisture. With the particular combination of ingredients in<br>
Composition T, the substitution of part ethanol for part water allowed the film to dry more<br>
quickly. The elimination of air from the film as a result of the slow stirring also contributed<br>
to the uniformity of the final film product and the faster drying time.<br>
Only water was used as a solvent in Composition U. The dried weight of the U1-U3<br>
changed consistently in accordance with the change in coating thickness indicating that no air<br>
bubbles were present. However, these films contained 20% moisture upon exit from the<br>
oven, unlike the films of Composition T, which included part ethanol and dried completely.<br>
The amount of solids was increased and the amount of water was decreased in<br>
Compositions V1 and V2. The dried weight was greater than U1-U3 due to the increase in<br>
solids, however the films still contained 20% moisture upon exit from the oven, similar to<br>
Composition U.<br><br>
The coating line speed was reduced for Composition V3, to prevent premature drying<br>
of the exposed top film surface. This film product dried to 6% moisture.<br>
While increasing the amount of solids improved the film weight, longer drying times<br>
were required. This was due to the surface of the film sealing preventing easy removal of the<br>
water. Therefore, for Compositions W1-W3, the temperature in the first 3m section of the<br>
dryer was decreased. This prevented the premature drying of the top surface of the films.<br>
Even at greater film thicknesses, the films were dried to 5% moisture even at faster coater<br>
line speeds.<br><br>
Compositions X, Y and Z of Table 8 were taste mask coated using a Glatt coater and<br>
Eudragit E-100 polymethacrylate polymer as the coating. The coating was spray coated at a<br>
20% level. Therefore 10mg of drug 12.5 mg of the final dry product must be weighed.<br>
The base formula which excluded the drug additive was mixed with care to not<br>
incorporate air. After initial mixing the formula was slowly mixed to deaerate over 30 min.<br>
During this time the drug was weighed and prepared for addition to the base mix.<br><br>
For Composition X, the Loratadine (80% drug) was added slowly to the mix with<br>
stirring. After 5 min. of stirring, the total mix was added to the pan of a three roll coater set<br>
(reverse roll coater) at 30 micron coating thickness.<br>
The process bottom temperature was set at 90°C with no top heat or air, the bottom air<br>
velocity was set at 40 m/sec., and the line speed was set at 1.3 m/min. Total drying time for<br>
the film was 4.6 min.<br>
The liquid was coated at 30 microns and dried in the oven in less than 5 min. The<br>
film was flexible and a 1" x .75" piece weighed 70 mg and contained 10 rog of Loratadine.<br>
The experiment was repeated for Compositions Y and Z, Zomig and Paxil,<br>
respectively. Both produced flexible films with the target weight of 70 mg containing 5 mg<br>
of Zomig and 70 mg containing 10 mg of Paxil, respectively.<br>
The products were sweet without any noticeable drug aftertaste.<br>
The ingredients of Composition AA were mixed in order to reduce air captured in the<br>
fluid matrix. After mixing 45 g of loratadine coated at a 80% active level and 20% coating<br>
using Eudragit E-100, this mixture was added slowing with mixing until the drug was evenly<br>
dispersed, approximately 5 min. The liquid was then deposited into the 3 roll coater (reverse<br>
roll coater) and coated at 30 microns at a line speed of 1.3 m/min. The oven temperature was<br>
set at 90°C to apply air and heat to the bottom only, with an air velocity set at 40 m/sec. The<br>
dried film was 0.005 inch, thick (5 mil) and was cut into 1 in. x 0.75 in. pieces weighing 70<br>
mg +/- 0.7 mg, demonstrating the uniformity of the composition of the film. The film was<br>
flexible with 5% moisture, free of air bubbles, and had uniform drug distribution as seen<br>
under the light microscope, as well as shown by the substantially identical weight<br>
measurements of the film pieces.<br>
Examples BA-BI:<br>
The incorporation of the anti-foaming/de-foaming agent (i.e., simethicone) provided a<br>
film that not only provided a uniform film that substantially reduced or eliminated air bubbles<br>
in the film product, but also provided other benefits. The films displayed more desirable<br><br>
organoleptic properties. The films had an improved texture that was less "paper-like"<br>
provided a better mouth-feel to the consumer.<br>
The compositions in Table 9 were prepared (including the addition of simethicone in<br>
inventive compositions BA-BG) and mixed under vacuum to remove air bubbles.<br>
The resultant uncut films of inventive compositions BA-BG exhibited uniformity in<br>
content particularly with respect to the insoluble active, as well as unit doses of 3/4 by 1" by 5<br>
mils cut therefrom. The inventive compositions also were observed to have a smooth surface,<br>
absent of air bubbles. The significantly higher amounts of simethicone present in inventive<br>
compositions BF-BG also provided a very uniform film, but not significantly improved from<br>
that of inventive compositions BA-BE.<br>
By contrast, comparative examples BH-BI were observed to have a rougher surface,<br>
exhibiting the inclusion of air bubbles in the resultant film which provided a less uniform<br>
texture and distribution of the ingredients.<br><br><br>

The above ingredients were added at 30% to 70% water and stirred until polymers<br>
were fully hydrated which took 45 min. The mix was then put under vacuum to eliminate<br>
entrapped air. Vacuum was added in a steady manner starting at 500 mm and progressing up<br>
to 760 mm over 45 min.<br>
After release of the vacuum, 6 grams of the liquid was added to a coating paper using<br>
a 200 micron spiral wound rod and a K Control Coater Model 101 (RK Print Coat Inst. Ltd.).<br>
The paper substrate onto which the coating was added was a silicone coated paper. The<br>
coated paper was then dried at 90°C until about 5% moisture remained. The formula coated<br>
and dried to a film thickness of approx. 60 microns and quickly dissolved in the mouth.<br><br><br>
The above ingredients were added to water at 40% until a homogeneous suspension<br>
was made. Vacuum was added over 20 min. starting at 500 mm Hg. and ending at 660 mm<br>
Hg. until all air was removed from suspension. Film was made as described in prior<br>
experiments. The liquid coated the silicone release substrate and dried to a uniform flexible<br>
film. The film passed the 180° bend test without cracking and dissolved in the mouth.<br><br><br>
The above ingredients, except for the pharmaceutically active agent and flavors, were<br>
added at 35 grams water and stirred until polymers were fully hydrated which took about 20<br>
min. Food coloring (7 drops of red food coloring and 1 drop of yellow fool coloring) was<br>
also added. The mix was then put under vacuum to eliminate entrapped air. Vacuum was<br>
added in a steady manner starting at 500 mm and progressing up to 760 mm over about 10 to<br>
20 minutes. The taste-masked Acetaminophen was added to the mix in about 4 minutes was<br>
stirring under vacuum. The flavors were then added to the mix in about 4 minutes was<br>
stirring under vacuum.<br>
After release of the vacuum, the liquid solution was added to a coating paper using a<br>
350 micron smooth bar. The paper substrate onto which the coating was added was a silicone<br>
coated paper. The coated paper was then dried at 90°C for about 11 minutes until about 3%<br>
moisture remained.<br>
The formula coated and dried to a film. The film had an acceptable taste and<br>
moderately quickly dissolved in the mouth. The film did not curl on standing. The film<br>
passed the 180° bend test without cracking and dissolved in the mouth.<br>
While there have been described what are presently believed to be the preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention, those skilled in the art will realize that changes and<br>
modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit of the invention, and it<br><br>
is intended to include all such changes and modifications as fall within the true scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
Examples CE-CF:<br>
Thin film compositions of the present invention were prepared using the amounts<br>
described in Table 14.<br><br>
The above ingredients were combined by mixing until a uniform mixture was<br>
achieved. A sufficient amount of water was present in the film compositions prior to drying,<br>
i.e., q.s., which may range between about 200g to about 1000g. The compositions then were<br>
cast into films onto release paper using a K-Control Coater with a 2S0 micron smooth bar.<br>
In Example CE, the films subsequently were dried in an oven at approximately 80°C<br>
for about 6 minutes. The films were dried to about 4.3 percent moisture. In Example CF, the<br>
films were dried in an oven at approximately 60°C for about 10 minutes. The films were<br>
dried to about 5.06 percent moisture. After drying, the protein derived from bovine extract,<br>
which was contained in the films, was tested to determine whether or not it remained active.<br>
The protein was found to be approximately 100 percent active in the final, dried film products<br>
of both Examples CE and CF. Therefore, the heat sensitive active did not substantially<br>
degrade or denaturize during the drying process.<br><br>
Examples CG-CI:<br>
Example CG:<br>
Thin film compositions of the present invention were prepared using the amounts<br>
described in Table 15.<br><br>
The above ingredients were combined by mixing, and then cast into two films on<br>
release paper using a K-Control Coater with a 350 micron smooth bar. The films were<br>
subsequently dried according to conventional drying techniques, rather than via the uniform<br>
drying process of the present invention. One film was dried in an oven at 80°C for 9 minutes<br>
on a wire rack. The second film was dried in an oven at 80°C for 9 minutes on a wire screen.<br>
Both films were dried to about 2.4 percent moisture.<br>
The resulting dried films showed imprints of the wire rack and screen after drying. In<br>
particular, the films exhibited aggregations of particles in both line and diamond<br>
configurations, as shown in Figs. 9-16. These configurations comprise imprints of wire<br>
supports typically used in the drying process. Without uniform heat diffusion, the wire<br>
supports conducted heat more intensely at the points of contact with the substrate, leading to<br>
increased evaporation at these points. This caused more vigorous mixing, thereby pulling<br><br>
more particles to the contact points. The resulting increased particle density at the contact<br>
points is depicted in Figs. 9-16.<br>
Example CH;<br>
A composition including the ingredients of Example CG was combined and formed<br>
into films, as in Example CG. The films were dried by the process of the present invention,<br>
under the same time and temperature conditions as in Example CG. In particular, the films<br>
were dried in an 80°C air oven for 9 minutes on trays lined with furnace filters. The films<br>
were dried to about 1.89 percent moisture. The resulting films had no streaks, and were<br>
homogenous. Due to uniform heat diffusion throughout the film, no particle aggregations<br>
developed, as depicted in Fig. 17.<br><br>
