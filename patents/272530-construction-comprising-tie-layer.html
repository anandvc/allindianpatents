				<td>CONSTRUCTION COMPRISING TIE LAYER<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
The present application claims the benefit of PCT Application No. Not yet Available (Aoki's Ref. YR,EXOC-S835-PCT), filed on 29 September 2006 and PCT/US2005/38705, filed on 27 October 2005, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This disclosure relates to compositions useful in multilayer constructions, for example in tire construction, especially a tire tie layer between an innerliner and carcass.  In particular, this disclosure relates to rubber compositions utilizing blends of high diene-containing elastomer or rubber, such as natural rubber (NR) and styrene butadiene rubber (SBR), and epoxidized .natural rubber.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
To prevent tire cord strike-through, a condition wherein the reinforcing tire cord penetrates the innerliner layer, leading to air leakage and tire failure, it is a common practice to add a buffer layer between the carcass layer containing textile or steel cords and the innerliner layer.  This buffer layer has been referred to as tie gum, tie layer, cushion compound, or liner backing layer and typically includes blends of natural rubber (NR) and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR). For purposes of the present disclosure, this tire component is referred to as the "tie layer."  Typically, the composition of the tie layer is similar to the composition of the carcass compound in order to provide the necessary building tack for maintaining a coherent tire structure in the uncured, or "green," state, cured adhesion, and satisfactory dynamic properties during tire<br>
use.  However, a conventional tie layer based on NR and SBR cannot provide sufficient tack and cured adhesion, for example, between a thermoplastic elastomeric tire innerliner composition based on vulcanized blends of engineering resins and halogenated isobutylene containing elastomers and carcass layer.  The present disclosure is useful in tires employing conventional innerliner compositions based on halogenated isobutylene-containing elastomer components as well as thermoplastic elastomeric tire innerliner compositions based on vulcanized blends of engineering resins, e.g., polyamides and BIMS, produced, for example, using dynamic vulcanization, as disclosed in EP 0 722 850 Bl.  Consequently, the present disclosure provides a tie layer suitable for joining a layer based on a dynamically vulcanized alloy of polyamide and a brominated copolymer of isobutylene-para-methylstyrene, such as an innerliner composition, to a tire carcass without impairing the improved permeability characteristics achieved by the innerliner.  It is also useful in other applications in which an air or fluid holding layer is used in combination with another layer, particularly where the other layer includes reinforcing fibers or cords, e.g., hoses and other vessels required to retain a gas or a fluid.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,738,158 discloses a pneumatic tire having an air permeation prevention layer or innerliner layer composed of a thin film of a resin composition including at least 20% by weight of a thermoplastic polyester elastomer comprised of a block copolymer of polybutylene terephthalate and polyoxyalkylene diimide diacid at a weight ratio of polybutylene<br>
terephthalate/polyoxyalkylene diimide diacid of 85/15 or less.  The resin composition can further include dispersed rubber particles wherein the rubber particles have been dynamically vulcanized.  The concept of using a resin composition as an innerliner layer has been further developed by various inventors of the same assignee, see,<br>
e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,079,465, which claims a pneumatic tire that incorporates such an innerliner and discloses the use of various thermoplastic resins for use in the composition.  This patent also discloses the presence of a tie layer and another layer to promote bond or adhesive strength of the innerliner layer in the overall structure.  The further development of this technology to improve adhesion of the innerliner layer in the structure is described in U.S. Patent No. 6,062,283 wherein melt viscosities and solubility parameters of thermoplastic resin components and elastomer components are controlled according to a specific mathematical formula.<br>
Published application U.S. 2002/0066512 discloses a pneumatic tire comprising a carcass comprising a ply of cords defining the innermost reinforcing cord layer extending between bead portions, and an airtight layer disposed inside the cords of the carcass ply along the inner surface of the tire, covering the substantially entire inner surface of the tire, wherein the airtight layer is made of air-impermeable rubber including at least 10 weight % of halogenated butyl rubber and/or halogenated isobutylene-paramethyl styrene copolymer in its rubber base, and a thickness of the airtight layer measured from the inner surface of the tire to the cords of the carcass ply is in a range of from 0.2 to 0.7 mm. The publication also discloses that the "airtight layer," defined by a rubber layer between the tire inner surface and the innermost tire cords or carcass cords, can be a double layer comprising an inner layer of an air-impermeable rubber compound and an outer layer of a diene-based rubber which is not air-impermeable. Alternatively, the outer layer may be of the same air-impermeable rubber compound or a similar air-impermeable rubber compound, which compound is further described in the publication as including halogenated butyl rubber and/or halogenated isobutylene-paramethyl styrene copolymer and diene rubber as well as carbon black (see<br>
paragraphs 28-34).<br>

the tie layer comprises epoxidized natural rubber, natural rubber and a mixture of tackifiers.  In another aspect, the disclosure relates to a hose comprising the improved vulcanizable layered construction.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
The present disclosure relates to a rubber composition for a relatively impermeable tie layer between innerliner and carcass for tire weight reduction while maintaining the heat resistance, durability, and flexibility demanded for a pneumatic tire.  The present disclosure is also directed to reducing the permeability of the tie layer with improved durability while maintaining its excellent adhesion to carcass and innerliner and/or its fatigue resistance.<br>
As used herein, the new numbering scheme for the Periodic Table Groups is used as disclosed in CHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING NEWS, 63(5), 27 (1985).  All molecular weights are weight average unless otherwise noted.<br>
Polymer may be used to refer to homopolymers, copolymers, interpolymers, terpolymers, etc.  Likewise, a copolymer may refer to a polymer comprising at least two monomers, optionally with other monomers.<br>
When a polymer is referred to as comprising a monomer, the monomer is present in the polymer in the polymerized form of the monomer or in the derivative form the monomer.  However, for ease of reference the phrase "comprising the (respective) monomer" or the like is used as shorthand.  Likewise, when catalyst components are described as comprising neutral stable forms of the components, it is well understood by one skilled in the art, that the active form of the component is the form<br>
that reacts with the monomers to produce polymers.<br>
Isoolefin refers to any olefin monomer having two substitutions on the same carbon.<br>
Multiolefin refers to any monomer having two or more double bonds.  In some embodiments, the multiolefin is any monomer comprising two double bonds, preferably two conjugated double bonds such as a conjugated diene like isoprene.<br>
Elastomer(s) as used herein, refers to any polymer or composition of polymers consistent with the ASTM D1566 definition.  The terms may be used interchangeably with the term "rubber (s) ."<br>
Alkyl refers to a paraffinic hydrocarbon group which may be derived from an alkane by dropping one or more hydrogens from the formula, such as, for example, a methyl group (CH3) , or an ethyl group (CH3CH2) , etc.<br>
Aryl refers to a hydrocarbon group that forms a ring structure characteristic of aromatic compounds such as, for example, benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, anthracene, etc., and typically possess alternate double bonding  ("unsaturation") within its structure.  An aryl group is thus a group derived from an aromatic compound by dropping one or more hydrogens from the formula such as, for example, phenyl, or C6H5.<br>
Substituted refers to at least one hydrogen group replaced by at least one substituent selected from, for example, halogen (chlorine, bromine, fluorine, or iodine), amino, nitro, sulfoxy (sulfonate or alkyl sulfonate), thiol, alkylthiol, and hydroxy; alkyl, straight or branched chain having 1 to 20 carbon atoms which includes methyl, ethyl, propyl, tert-butyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, etc.; alkoxy, straight or branched chain alkoxy having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and includes, for example, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy, isobutoxy, secondary butoxy, tertiary butoxy, pentyloxy, isopentyloxy, hexyloxy, heptyloxy, octyloxy, nonyloxy, and decyloxy; haloalkyl, which means straight<br>
or branched chain alkyl having 1 to 20 carbon atoms which contains at least one halogen, and includes, for example, chloromethyl, bromomethyl, fluoromethyl, iodomethyl, 2-chloroethyl, 2-bromoethyl, 2-fluoroethyl, 3-chloropropyl, 3-bromopropyl, 3-fluoropropyl, 4-chlorobutyl, 4-fluorobutyl, dichloromethyl, dibromomethyl, difluoromethyl, diiodomethyl, 2,2-dichloroethyl, 2,2-dibromomethyl, 2,2-difluoroethyl, 3,3-dichloropropyl, 3,3-difluoropropyl, 4,4-dichlorobutyl, 4,4-difluorobutyl, trichloromethyl, 4,4-difluorobutyl, trichloromethyl, trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 2,3,3-trifluoropropyl, 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl, and 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl.  Thus, for example, a "substituted styrenic unit" includes p-methylstyrene, p-ethylstyrene, etc.<br>
In various preferred embodiments, the present disclosure is directed to a layered construction comprising at least one layer comprising an thermoplastic engineering resin (also called an "engineering resin" or a "thermoplastic resin") as a continuous phase and a vulcanized (or partially vulcanized) elastomer as a dispersed phase.  Such a composition is prepared, for example by utilizing technology known as dynamic vulcanization and the resulting composition is known as a dynamically vulcanized alloy (DVA); details of such a composition and its method of preparation are described herein.  The construction further comprises a layer of an elastomeric composition comprising (a) a high diene rubber, for example, natural rubber and/or styrene butadiene rubber, further described herein, (b) a halogenated elastomer or mixtures of (a) and (b).  Each of these layers typically contain additional components such as reinforcing agents and process' aids, for example, carbon black and/or exfoliated, intercalated, or simply dispersed clay and rubber processing oil, respectively. The high diene rubber-containing layer is typically prepared by standard rubber compounding methods, and<br>
includes curatives or a cure system so that the composition is vulcanizable.  Sandwiched between the two layers is a tie layer, so named because it ties the two layers together.  It too is preferably a vulcanizable composition, typically containing at least one reinforcing filler as well as optional additives such as processing aids, etc., and, for purposes of the present disclosure, the tie layer comprises a halogenated isobutylene-containing elastomer.  The thermoplastic engineering resin layer of the present disclosure can comprise at least one reinforcing filler and other components such that it serves to inhibit the permeation of fluids through it.  In the context of its use in pneumatic tires, it serves as a liner, typically at the innermost surface of the tire construction and is referred to in the tire industry as an innerliner.  Its composition and method of preparation are designed by a rubber compounder to inhibit the passage of air or oxygen through the layer so as to maintain tire pressure over extended periods of time.<br>
When the engineering resin-containing layer is used as a layer (typically the innermost layer) of a hose construction, it will also inhibit passage of fluids through it.  Such fluids can include air, oxygen and other gases, as well as liquids such as water or industrial fluids.  The nature of the fluid to be contained will dictate the selection of the components of the engineering resin-containing layer, including the choice of vulcanizable rubber used to prepare the DVA composition.  Such selections are well known to compounders of ordinary skill in the hose industry.<br>
When the engineering resin-containing layer is used as a tire innerliner, the tire innerliner composition of the present disclosure may be used in producing innerliners for motor vehicle tires such as truck tires, bus tires, passenger automobile, motorcycle tires, moped tires, all terrain vehicle tires, and the like.<br>
Furthermore, such a layer can be used in tires intended for non-motorized vehicles such as bicycles.<br>
The first layer, or fluid permeation prevention layer, in a construction is typically a dynamically vulcanized alloy (DVA) composition as described in detail below and is typically present in the form of a sheet or a film, but may also be present in the form of a tubular layer of a hose construction.<br>
The second layer in a construction (such as a film or sheet or tire carcass layer) is- typically a composition comprising .a high diene rubber. Alternatively, such second layer can be a tubular layer of a hose construction.  This layer can also comprise reinforcing fibers such as tire cords, carbon black or other suitable reinforcement useful in tire applications or hose applications.<br>
The tie layer is typically present as a sheet or film that is formed, e.g., by the use of extrusion or calendering processes.<br>
Halogenated rubber is defined as a rubber having at least about 0.1 mole% halogen, such halogen selected from the group consisting of bromine, chlorine and iodine. Preferred halogenated rubbers useful in this disclosure include halogenated isobutylene containing elastomers (also referred to as halogenated isobutylene-based homopolymers or copolymers).  These elastomers can be described as random copolymers of a C4 to C7 isomonoolefin derived unit, such as isobutylene derived unit, and at least one other polymerizable unit.  In one embodiment of the disclosure, the halogenated isobutylene-containing elastomer is a butyl-type rubber or branched butyl-type rubber, especially brominated versions of these elastomers.  (Useful unsaturated butyl rubbers such as homopolymers and copolymers of olefins or isoolefins and other types of elastomers suitable for the disclosure are well known and are described in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY 209-581 (Maurice Morton ed., Chapman &amp; Hall 1995), THE VANDERBILT<br>
RUBBER HANDBOOK 105-122 (Robert F. Ohm ed., R.T. Vanderbilt Co., Inc. 1990), and Edward Kresge  and H.C. Wang  in 8 KIRK-OTHMER ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY 934-955 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 4th ed. 1993)). Preferred halogenated isobutylene-based homopolymers or copolymers useful in this disclosure include halobutyl rubbers, such as bromobutyl rubber and chlorobutyl rubber.<br>
Butyl rubbers are typically prepared by reacting a mixture of monomers, the mixture having at least (1) a C4 to C12 isoolefin monomer component such as isobutylene with (2) a multiolefin, monomer component.  The isoolefin is in a range from 70 to 99.5 wt% by weight of the total monomer mixture in one  embodiment, and 85 to 99.5 wt% in another embodiment.  The multiolefin component is present in the monomer mixture from 3 0 to 0.5 wt% in one embodiment, and from 15 to 0.5 wt% in another embodiment. In yet another embodiment, from 8 to 0.5 wt% of the monomer mixture is multiolefin.  The isoolefin is preferably a C4 to Ci2 compound, non-limiting examples of which are compounds such as isobutylene, isobutene, 2-methyl-1-butene, 3-methyl-l-butene, 2-methyl-2-butene, 1-butene, 2-butene, methyl vinyl ether, indene, vinyltrimethylsilane, hexene, and 4-methyl-l-pentene. The multiolefin is a C4 to C14 multiolefin such as isoprene, butadiene, 2,3-dimethyl-l,3-butadiene, myrcene, 6,6-dimethyl-fulvene, hexadiene, cyclopentadiene, and piperylene, and other monomers such as disclosed in EP 0 279 456 and US 5,506,316 and 5,162,425.  Other polymerizable monomers such as styrene and dichlorostyrene are also suitable for homopolymerization or copolymerization in butyl rubbers.  One embodiment of the butyl rubber polymer useful in the disclosure is obtained by reacting 95 to 99.5 wt% of isobutylene with 0.5 to 8 wt% isoprene, or from 0.5 wt% to 5.0 wt% isoprene in yet another embodiment.   Butyl rubbers and methods of their production are described in detail in,<br>
for example, US 2,356,128, 3,968,076, 4,474,924, 4,068,051 and 5,532,312.<br>
Halogenated butyl rubber is produced by the halogenation of the butyl rubber product described above. Halogenation can be carried out by any means, and the disclosure is not herein limited by the halogenation process.  Methods of halogenating polymers such as butyl polymers are disclosed in U.S. 2,631,984, 3,099,644, 4,288,575, 4,554,326, 4,632,963, 4,681,921, 4,650,831, 4,384,072, 4,513,116 and 5,681,901.  In one embodiment, the butyl rubber is halogenated in hexane diluent at from 4 to 60°C using bromine (Br2) or chlorine (CI2) as the halogenation agent.  Post-treated halogenated butyl rubber can also be used, as disclosed in US 4,288,575. The halogenated butyl rubber typically has a Mooney<br>
Viscosity of about 20 to about 70 (ML 1+8 at 125°C) ; for example, about 25 to about 55 in another embodiment.  The halogen content is typically about 0.1 to 10 wt% based on the weight of the halogenated butyl rubber; for example, about 0.5 to 5 wt%; alternatively, about 0.8 to about 2.5 wt%; for example, about 1 to about 2 wt%.<br>
A commercial embodiment of a halogenated isobutylene containing elastomer useful in the present disclosure is Bromobutyl 2222 (ExxonMobil Chemical Company).  Its Mooney Viscosity is typically about 27 to 37 (ML 1+8 at 125°C, ASTM 1646, modified), and its bromine content is about 1.8 to 2.2 wt% relative to the Bromobutyl 2222. Furthermore, the cure characteristics of Bromobutyl 2222 as provided by the manufacturer are as follows:  MH about 28 to 40 dN-m, ML is about 7 to 18 dN-m (ASTM D2084). Another commercial embodiment of a halogenated isobutylene containing elastomer useful in the present disclosure is Bromobutyl 2255 (ExxonMobil Chemical Company).  Its Mooney Viscosity is about 41 to 51 (ML 1+8 at 125°C, ASTM D1646), and its bromine content is about 1.8 to 2.2 wt%.  Furthermore, its cure characteristics as<br>
disclosed by the manufacturer are as follows:  MH is from 34 to 48 dN-m, ML is from 11 to 21 dN-m (ASTM D2084) .<br>
Another embodiment of halogenated isobutylene containing elastomer is halogenated, branched or "star-branched" butyl rubber.  These rubbers are described in, for example, EP 0 678 529 Bl, US 5,182,333 and US 5,071,913, each incorporated herein by reference.  In one embodiment, the star-branched butyl rubber ("SBB") is a composition comprising butyl rubber and a polydiene or block copolymer.  For purposes of the present disclosure, the method of forming the SBB is not a limitation.  The polydienes, block copolymer, or branching agents (hereinafter "polydienes"), are typically cationically reactive and are present during the polymerization of the butyl or halogenated butyl rubber, or can be blended with the butyl rubber to form the SBB.  The branching agent or polydiene can be any suitable branching agent, and the disclosure is not limited to the type of polydiene or branching agent used to make the SBB.<br>
In one embodiment, the SBB is a composition of butyl or halogenated butyl rubber as described above and a copolymer of a polydiene and a partially hydrogenated polydiene selected from the group consisting of styrene, polybutadiene, polyisoprene, polypiperylene, natural rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber, ethylene-propylene diene rubber (EPDM), ethylene-propylene rubber (EPM), styrene-butadiene-styrene and styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymers.

where: m is the copolymer sequence distribution parameter,<br>
A is the molar ratio of p-alkylstyrene to isoolefin in the copolymer and,<br>
F is the p-alkylstyrene-isoolefin-p-alkylstyrene triad fraction in the copolymer.<br>
Parameters F and A can be measured experimentally. The m value (a positive number) is obtained by solving this equation for copolymerization of the isoolefin and p-alkylstyrene in a particular diluent.  In certain embodiments, m is from less than 38; alternatively, from less than 36; alternatively, from less than 35; and alternatively, from less than 30.

Such polymers and methods to measure such characteristics are disclosed in WO 2004058825 and WO 2004058835.<br>
In another embodiment, the relationship between the triad fraction of an isoolefin and a multiolefin and the mol% of multiolefin incorporated into the halogenated rubber copolymer is described by the copolymer sequence distribution equation below and is characterized by the copolymer -sequence distribution parameter, m.<br>
F = m A / (1 + mA)2<br>
where: m is the copolymer sequence distribution parameter,<br>
A is the molar ratio of multiolefin to isoolefin in the copolymer and,<br>

Measurement of triad fraction of an isoolefin and a multiolefin and the mol% of multiolefin incorporated into the copolymer is described below.  Parameters F and A can be measured experimentally.

In another embodiment, the halogenated rubber is substantially free of long chain branching.  For the purposes of this disclosure, a polymer that is substantially free of long chain branching is defined to be a polymer for which g'vis.avg. is determined to be greater than or equal to 0.978, alternatively, greater than or equal to 0.980, alternatively, greater than or equal to 0.985, alternatively, greater than or equal to 0.990, alternatively, greater than or equal to 0.995, alternatively, greater than or equal to 0.998, alternatively, greater than or equal to 0.999, as determined by triple detection SEC as follows.  The presence or absence of long chain branching in the polymers is determined using triple detection SEC. Triple detection SEC is performed on a Waters (Milford, Massachusetts) 150C chromatograph operated at 40°C equipped a Precision Detectors (Bellingham, Massachusetts) PD2040 light scattering detector, a Viscotek (Houston, Texas) Model 150R viscometry detector and a Waters differential refractive index detector (integral with the 150C).  The detectors are connected in series with the light scattering detector being first, the viscometry detector second and the differential refractive index detector third.  Tetrahydrofuran is used as the eluent (0.5 ml/min.) with a set of three Polymer Laboratories, Ltd. (Shropshire, United Kingdom) 10 micron mixed-B/LS GPC columns.  The instrument is calibrated against 16 narrow polystyrene standards (Polymer Laboratories, Ltd.).  Data is acquired with TriSEC<br>
software (Viscotek) and imported into WaveMetric's Igor Pro program (Lake Oswego, OR) for analysis.  Linear polyisobutylene is used to establish the relationship between the intrinsic viscosity []linar determined by the viscometry detector) and the molecular weight (Mw, determined by the light scattering detector) .  The relationship between [r|]linear and Mw is expressed by the Mark-Houwink equation.<br>
[]linear   =   KMw  α<br>
Parameters K and a are obtained from the double-logarithmic plot of intrinsic viscosity against Mw/ α is the slope, K the intercept.  Significant deviations from the relationship established for the linear standards indicate the presence of long chain branching. Generally, samples which exhibit more significant deviation from the linear relationship contain more significant long chain branching.  The scaling factor g' also indicates deviations from the determined linear relationship.<br>
[|] sample = g'  [ J linear<br>
The value of g' is defined to be less than or equal to one and greater than or equal to zero.  When g' is equal or nearly equal to one, the polymer is considered to be linear.  When g' is significantly less than one, the sample is long chain branched.  See e.g.  E.F. Casassa and G.C. Berry in Comprehensive Polymer Science, Vol. 2, (71-120) G. Allen and J.C. Bevington, Ed., Pergamon Press, New York, 1988.  In triple detection SEC, a g1 is calculated for each data slice of the chromatographic curve.  A viscosity average g' or g'vis.avg. is calculated across the entire molecular weight distribution.  The scaling factor g'vis.avg. is calculated<br>
from the average intrinsic viscosity of the sample.<br>
g'vis.avg. =  [)]avg. /  (KMwα]<br>

The block portion A are the hard blocks and are derived from materials which have a sufficiently high glass transition temperature to form crystalline or glassy domains at the use temperature of the polymer.  Such hard blocks generally form strong physical "crosslinks" or agglomerates with other hard blocks in the copolymers.  The hard block portion, A, generally comprises a polyvinylarene derived from monomers such as styrene, alpha-methyl styrene, other styrene derivatives, or mixtures thereof.  The hard block portion A may also be a copolymer derived from styrenic monomers such as those described above and olefinic monomers such as ethylene, propylene, butene, isoprene, butadiene, and mixtures thereof.  Useful such polymers for the present disclosure typically include less than about 50% glassy phase such that the glass transition of the polymer, Tg, should be less than about -50°C.<br>

A particularly useful rubber component of the tie layer is epoxidized natural rubber, ENR.  Epoxidized rubber is a modified rubber where some of the rubber's unsaturation is replaced by epoxide groups.  This modification is typically accomplished by an epoxidation reaction.<br>
Epoxidation reactions can be effected by reacting natural rubber, an unsaturated rubber, with an epoxidizing agent.  Useful epoxidizing agents include peracids such as m-chloroperbenzoic acid and peracedic acid.  Other examples include carboxylic acids, such as acetic and formic acid, or carboxylic anhydrides such as acetic anhydride, together with hydrogen peroxide.  A catalyst, such as sulfuric acid, p-tolulene sulfonic acid, or a cationic exchange resin such as sulfonated polystyrene may optionally be employed.  The epoxidation reaction is preferably conducted at a temperature from<br>
about 0 °C to about 150 °C and preferably from about 25 °C to about 80 °C.  The time required to effect the epoxidation reaction is typically from about 0.25 hours to about 10 hours, and preferably from about 0.5 hours to about 3 hours.<br>
The epoxidation reaction is preferably conducted in a solvent that is capable of substantially dissolving the rubber both in its original condition and after epoxidation.  Suitable solvents include aromatic solvents such as benzene, tolulene, xylene, and chlorobenzene, as well as cycloaliphatic solvents such as cyclohexane, cycloheptane, and mixtures thereof.  After epoxidation, the epoxidized rubber is preferably removed or isolated from the acidic environment, which may include the epoxidizing agents as well as the acidic catalyst.  This isolation can be accomplished via filtration, or by<br>
adding a dilute aqueous base to neutralize the acid and then subsequently coagulate the polymer.  The epoxidized polymer can be coagulated by using an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, or propanol.  An antioxidant is typically added after the isolation procedure, and the final product may be dried by using techniques such as vacuum distillation.  Alternatively, other known methods for removing polymers from hydrocarbon solvents and the like may be employed including steam stripping and drum drying.<br>
Useful epoxidized rubbers have an extent of epoxidation of about 5 mole% to about 95 mole%, preferably from about 15 mole% to about 80 mole%, and more preferably from about 25 mole% to about 50 mole %, where the extent of epoxidation is defined as the mole percentage of olefinically unsaturated sites originally present in the rubber that have been converted to oxirane, hydroxyl, or ester groups.  The epoxidized natural rubber is also characterized by its Mooney viscosity (large rotor (ML), one minute preheat and reading at four minutes (1 + 4), measured at 100 °C) , which can also very greatly, although it is typically about 85 to about 170, preferably from about 95 to about 155, and more preferably from about 105 to about 145.<br>
Useful epoxidized natural rubber typically contains about 10 mole% to about 75 mole% epoxide; preferably about 15 mole% to about 60 mole%; more preferably about 20 mole% to about 55 mole%; still more preferably about 25 mole% to about 50 mole%; for example, products having about 25 mole % and about 50 mole% epoxide.  Epoxidized natural rubber is commercially available under the tradename "Epoxyprene" (Kumpulan Guthrie Berhad,<br>
Malaysia) as grades ENR 25, which contains about 25+2 mole% epoxide, and ENR 50, which contains about 50±2 mole% epoxide; similar products are also available from Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia (RRIM).  Both of<br>
the commercial materials exhibit a Mooney viscosity (ML, 1+4 at 100 °C) of about 70 to about 90.  Tie layer compositions according to the present disclosure preferably employ epoxidized natural rubber comprising about 50 mole% epoxide, such as ENR 50.<br>
Epoxidized natural rubber is typically present in the tie layer composition at a level of about 10 parts by weight to about 70 parts by weight of ENR relative to 100 parts by weight of total rubber present in the mixture; preferably about 20 parts to about 60 parts; more preferably about 30 parts to about 50 parts; for example, about 25 parts to about 55 parts; alternatively about 33 parts to about 48 parts; such as 40 parts.  Preferably, the tie layer compositions of the present disclosure also include a high unsaturation rubber selected from the group consisting of natural rubber, styrene butadiene rubber, polyisoprene rubber, polybutadiene rubber and mixtures thereof; preferably natural rubber is included. Typically, the tie layer composition comprises about 3.0 to about 90 parts by weight of natural rubber relative to 100 parts by weight of total rubber present in the tie layer composition; preferably about 35 to about 80 parts; more preferably about 40 to about 70 parts; still more preferably about 4 5 to about 7 0 parts; for example about 50 to about 65 parts; such as 60 parts.<br>
As described in detail hereinbelow, particularly preferred compositions include additives to improve the uncured tack properties of the tie layer composition in addition to the use of ENR.  Such additives improve the processing of the uncured compositions in that they facilitate construction of multilayer structures by maintaining the structural integrity of the construction until it is vulcanized and cured adhesion between the layers is established.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the use of ENR improves the cured or vulcanized adhesion of the tie layer to the fluid<br>
permeation prevention layer (such as the innerliner layer in a tire), particularly where a polyamide is used in the innerliner composition.  Similarly, the presence of natural rubber in the tie layer improves vulcanized adhesion to the other layer with which it is in contact, for example, the carcass layer or sidewall layer of a tire.  Additionally, the use of ENR lowers the air permeability of tie layer considering that ENR is substantially impermeable to air relative to NR and SBR. Generally, polymer compositions, e.g., those used to produce tires, are crosslinked in the finished tire product.  Crosslinking or vulcanization is accomplished by incorporation of curing agents and/or accelerators; the overall mixture of such agents being typically referred to as a cure "system."  It is known that the physical properties, performance characteristics, and durability of vulcanized rubber compounds are directly related to the number (crosslink density) and types of crosslinks formed during the vulcanization reaction. (See,   e.g.,   Helt et al., The Post   Vulcanization  Stabilization  for NRr   RUBBER WORLD 18-23 (1991).  Curing agents include those components described above that facilitate or influence the cure of elastomers, and generally include metals, accelerators, sulfur, peroxides, and other agents common in the art, and as described above.  Crosslinking or curing agents include at least one of, e.g., sulfur, zinc oxide, and fatty acids and mixtures thereof.  EDeroxide-containing cure systems may also be used.  Generally, polymer compositions may be crosslinked by adding curative agents, for example sulfur, metal oxides (i.e., zinc oxide, ZnO), organometallic compounds, radical initiators, etc. and heating the composition or mixture.  When the method known as "dynamic vulcanization" is used, the process is modified so as to substantially simultaneously mix and vulcanize, or crosslink, at least one of the vulcanizable components in a composition comprising at least one vulcanizable rubber, elastomer or polymer and at least one elastomer or polymer<br>
not vulcanizable using the vulcanizing agent(s) for the at least one vulcanizable component.  (See, e.g.,   US 6,079,465 and the references cited therein).  In particular, the following are common curatives that can function in the present disclosure:  ZnO, CaO, MgO, A1203, Cr03, FeO, Fe203, and NiO.  These metal oxides can be used in conjunction with the corresponding metal stearate complex (e.g., the stearate salts of Zn, Ca, Mg, and Al), or with stearic acid, and either a sulfur compound or an alkylperoxide compound.  (See also, Formulation Design  and Curing Characteristics  of NBR Mixes  for Seals,   RUBBER WORLD 25-30 (1993).  To the curative agent (s) there are often added accelerators for the vulcanization of elastomer compositions.  The curing agent (s), with or without the use of at least one accelerator, is often referred to in the art as a curing "system" for the elastomer(s).  A cure system is used because typically more than one curing agent is employed for beneficial effects, particularly where a mixture of high diene rubber and a less reactive elastomer is used.<br>
For purposes of dynamic vulcanization in the presence of an engineering resin to form the highly impermeable layer, any conventional curative system which is capable of vulcanizing saturated halogenated polymers may be used to vulcanize at least the elastomeric halogenated copolymer of a C4 to C7 isomonoolefin and a para-alkylstyrene, except that peroxide curatives are specifically excluded from the practice of this disclosure when the thermoplastic engineering resin(s) chosen are such that peroxide would cause these resins themselves to crosslink since the engineering resin would itself vulcanize or crosslink, thereby resulting in an excessively cured, non-thermoplastic composition. Suitable curative systems for the elastomeric halogenated copolymer component useful in the present disclosure include zinc oxide in combination with zinc stearate or stearic acid and, optionally, one or more of the<br>
following accelerators or vulcanizing agents:  Permalux, the di-ortho-tolylguanidine salt of dicatechol borate; HVA-2 (m-phenylene bis maleimide); Zisnet, 2,4,6-trimercapto-5-triazine; ZDEDC (zinc diethyl dithiocarbamate) and also including for the purposes of the present disclosure, other dithiocarbamates; Tetrone A (dipentamethylene thiuram hexasulfide); Vultac 5 (alkylated phenol disulfide), SP1045 (phenol formaldehyde resin); SP1056 (brominated alkyl phenol formaldehyde resin); DPPD (diphenyl phenylene diamine); salicylic acid, ortho-hydroxy benzoic acid; wood rosin, abietic acid; and TMTDS (tetramethyl thiuram disulfide), used in combination with sulfur.<br>
Dynamic vulcanization is conducted at conditions to vulcanize at least partially, preferably fully, the elastomeric halogen containing copolymer of the fluid (gas or liquid, preferably air) permeation prevention layer.<br>
With reference to the polymers and/or elastomers referred to herein, the terms "cured," "vulcanized," or "crosslinked" refer to the chemical reaction comprising forming bonds as, for example, during chain extension, or crosslinks between polymer chains comprising the polymer or elastomer to the extent that the elastomer undergoing such a process can provide the necessary functional properties resulting from the curing reaction when the tire is put to use.  For purposes of the present disclosure, absolute completion of such curing reactions is not required for the elastomer-containing composition to be considered "cured," "vulcanized" or "crosslinked." For example, for purposes of the present disclosure, a tire comprising the tie layer is sufficiently cured when the tire of which it is a component passes the necessary product specification tests during and after manufacturing and performs satisfactorily when used on a vehicle.  Furthermore, the composition is satisfactorily, sufficiently or substantially cured, vulcanized or<br>
crosslinked when the tire can be put to use even if additional curing time could produce additional crosslinks.  With limited experimentation using known tools and standard techniques, one of ordinary skill in the art can readily determine the appropriate or optimum cure time required for the elastomer(s) and polymer(s) selected for use in the tie layer composition, as well as the amount and type of crosslinking agent(s) and accelerator(s) and the curing temperature that will be used to manufacture the tire.<br>
Accelerators useful herein include amines, guanidines, thioureas, thiazoles, thiurams, sulfenamides, sulfenimides, thiocarbamates, xanthates, and the like. Acceleration of the cure process may be accomplished by adding to the composition an amount of the accelerant.  The mechanism for accelerated vulcanization of natural rubber involves complex interactions between the curative, accelerator, activators and polymers.  Ideally, all of the available curative is consumed in the formation of effective crosslinks which join together two polymer chains and enhance the overall strength of the polymer matrix. Numerous accelerators are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, the following: stearic acid, diphenyl guanidine (DPG), tetramethylthiuram disulfide (TMTD), 4,4'-dithiodimorpholine (DTDM), tetrabutylthiuram disulfide (TBTD), 2,2'-benzothiazyl disulfide (MBTS), hexamethylene-1,6-bisthiosulfate disodium salt dihydrate, 2-(morpholinothio) benzothiazole (MBS or MOR), compositions of 90% MOR and 10% MBTS (MOR 90), N-tertiarybutyl-2-benzothiazole sulfenamide (TBBS), and N-oxydiethylene thiocarbamyl-N-oxydiethylene sulfonamide (OTOS), zinc 2-ethyl hexanoate (ZEH), N, N'-diethyl thiourea.  Curatives, accelerators and cure systems useful with one or more crosslinkable polymers are well-known in the art.<br>
In one embodiment of the disclosure, at least one curing agent is typically present at about 0.1 to about 15 phr; alternatively at about 0.5 to about 10 phr.<br>
The compositions described herein may have one or more filler components such as calcium carbonate, clay, mica, silica and silicates, talc, titanium dioxide, starch and other organic fillers such as wood flour, and carbon black.  Suitable filler materials include carbon black such as channel black, furnace black, thermal black, acetylene black, lamp black and the like. Reinforcing grade carbon black, is most preferred.  The filler may also include other reinforcing or non-reinforcing materials such as silica, clay, calcium carbonate, talc, titanium dioxide and the like.  The filler is normally present in the compositions (preferably the innerliner) at a level of from about 20 to about 50% by weight of the total composition, more preferably from about 25 to 40% by weight.  In one embodiment., the filler is carbon black or modified carbon black.  A preferred filler is semi-reinforcing grade carbon black, typically used at a level of about 10 to 150 parts per hundred of rubber, by weight (phr), more preferably about 30 to about 120 phr.  Grades of carbon black useful herein include NllO to N990, as described in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY 59-85 (1995).  More desirably, grades of carbon black useful in, for example, tire treads, such as N229, N351, N339, N220, N234 and NllO provided in ASTM (D3037, D1510, and D3765) are useful herein. ' Embodiments of carbon black useful in, for example, tire sidewalls such as N330, N351, N550, N650, N660, and N762 are particularly useful herein.  Embodiments of carbon black useful in, for example, innerliners or innertubes, such as N550, N650, N660, N762, N990, and Regal 85 (Cabot Corporation, Alpharetta, GA) and the like are similarly particularly useful herein.<br>
Exfoliated, intercalated, or dispersed clays may also be present in the composition.  These clays, also referred to as "nanoclays", are well known, and their identity, methods of preparation and blending with polymers is disclosed in, for example, JP 2000109635, JP<br>
2000109605, JP 11310643; DE 19726278/ WO98/53000; and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,091,462, 4,431,755, 4,472,538, and 5,910,523.  Swellable layered clay materials suitable for the purposes of the present disclosure include natural or synthetic phyllosilicates, particularly smectic clays such as montmorillonite, nontronite, beidellite, volkonskoite, laponite, hectorite, saponite, sauconite, magadite, kenyaite, stevensite and the like, as well as vermiculite, halloysite, aluminate oxides, hydrotalcite and the like.  These layered clays generally comprise particles containing a plurality of silicate platelets having a thickness typically about 4 to about 20A in one embodiment, and about 8 to about 12A in another embodiment, bound together and containing exchangeable cations such as Na+, Ca+2, K+ or Mg+2 present at the interlayer surfaces.<br>
Layered clay may be intercalated and exfoliated by treatment with organic molecules (swelling agents) capable of undergoing ion exchange reactions with the cations present at the interlayer surfaces of the layered silicate.  Suitable swelling agents include cationic surfactants such as ammonium, alkylamines or alkylammonium (primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary), phosphonium or sulfonium derivatives of aliphatic, aromatic or arylaliphatic amines, phosphines and sulfides.   Desirable amine compounds (or the corresponding ammonium ion) are those with the structure R1R2R3N, wherein Ri, R2, and R3 are Ci to C30 alkyls or alkenes which may be the same or different.  In one embodiment, the exfoliating agent is a so-called long chain tertiary amine, wherein at least Ri is a C12 to C20 alkyl or alkene.<br>
Another class of swelling agents includes those which can be covalently bonded to the interlayer surfaces.  These include polysilanes of the structure -Si(R')2R2 where R' is the same or different at each occurrence and is selected from alkyl, alkoxy or<br>
oxysilane and R2 is an organic radical compatible with the matrix polymer of the composite.  Other suitable swelling agents include protonated amino acids and salts thereof containing 2-30 carbon atoms such as 12-aminododecanoic acid, epsilon-caprolactam and like materials.  Suitable swelling agents and processes for intercalating layered silicates are disclosed in US 4,472,538, 4,810,734, 4,889,885 and WO92/02582.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the disclosure, the exfoliating or swelling agent is combined with a halogenated polymer.   In one embodiment, the agent includes all primary, secondary and tertiary amines and phosphines; alkyl and aryl sulfides and thiols; and their polyfunctional versions.  Desirable additives include: long-chain tertiary amines such as N,N-dimethyl-octadecylamine, N,N-dioctadecyl-methylamine, dihydrogenated tallowalkyl-methylamine and the like, and amine-terminated polytetrahydrofuran; long-chain thiol and thiosulfate compounds such as hexamethylene sodium thiosulfate.  In another embodiment of the disclosure, improved interpolymer impermeability is achieved by the use of polyfunctional curatives such as hexamethylene bis(sodium thiosulfate) and hexamethylene bis(cinnamaldehyde).<br>
The amount of exfoliated, intercalated, or dispersed clay incorporated in the composition in accordance with this disclosure is an amount sufficient to develop an improvement in the mechanical properties or barrier properties of the composition, e.g. tensile strength or air/oxygen permeability.  Amounts typically can be from about 0.5 to about 15 wt% in one embodiment, or about 1 to about 10 wt% in another embodiment, and about 1 to about 5 wt% in yet another embodiment, based on the polymer content of the composition.  Expressed in parts per hundred rubber, the exfoliated, intercalated, or dispersed clay may be present at about 1 to about 30 phr in one embodiment, and about 3 to about 20 phr in another<br>
embodiment.  In one embodiment, the exfoliating clay is an alkylamine-exfoliating clay.<br>
As used herein, the term "process oil" means both the petroleum derived process oils and synthetic plasticizers.  A process or plasticizer oil may be present in air barrier compositions.  Such oils are primarily used to improve the processing of the composition during preparation of the layer, e.g., mixing, calendaring, etc.  Suitable plasticizer oils include aliphatic acid esters or hydrocarbon plasticizer oils such as paraffinic or naphthenic petroleum oils. The preferred plasticizer oil for use in standard, non-DVA, non-engineering resin-containing innerliner compositions is a paraffinic petroleum oil; suitable hydrocarbon plasticizer oils for use in such innerliners include oils having the following general characteristics.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Generally, the process oil may be selected from paraffinic oils, aromatic oils, naphthenic oils, and polybutene oils.  Polybutene process oil is a low molecular weight (less than 15,000 Mn) homopolymer or copolymer of olefin-derived units having from about 3 to about 8 carbon atoms, more preferably about 4 to about 6 carbon atoms.  In another embodiment, the polybutene oil is a homopolymer or copolymer of a C4 raffinate.  Low molecular weight "polybutene" polymers is described in, for example, SYNTHETIC LUBRIC/iNTS AND HIGH-PERFORMANCE FUNCTIONAL FLUIDS 357-392 (Leslie R. Rudnick &amp; Ronald L.<br>
Shubkin, ed., Marcel Dekker 1999) (hereinafter "polybutene processing oil" or "polybutene").  Useful examples of polybutene oils are the PARAPOL™ series of processing oils (previously available form ExxonMobil Chemical Company, Houston TX, now available from Infineum International Limited, Milton Hill, England under the "INFINEUM c, d, f or g tradename), including grades previously identified as PARAPOL™ 450, 700, 950, 1300, 2400, and 2500. Additionally preferred polybutene oils are SUNTEX™ polybutene oils available from Sun Chemicals. Preferred polybutene processing oils are typically synthetic liquid polybutenes having a certain molecular weight, preferably from about 420 Mn to about 2700 Mn. The molecular weight distribution -Mw/Mn- ("MWD") of preferred polybutene oils is typically about from 1.8 to about 3, preferably about 2 to about 2.8.  The preferred density (g/ml) of useful polybutene processing oils varies from about 0.8 5 to about 0.91.  The bromine number (CG/G) for preferred polybutene oils ranges from about 40 for the 450 Mn process oil, to about 8 for the 2700 Mn process oil.<br>
Rubber process oils also have ASTM designations depending on whether they fall into the class of paraffinic, naphthenic or aromatic hydrocarbonaceous process oils.  The type of process oil utilized will be that customarily used in conjunction with a type of elastomer component and a rubber chemist of ordinary skill in the art will recognize which type of oil should be utilized with a particular rubber in a particular application.  For an innerliner composition the oil is typically present at a level of 0 to about 25 wt %; preferably about 5 to 20 wt % of the total composition.<br>
In addition, plasticizers such as organic esters and other synthetic plasticizers can be used.  A particularly preferred plasticizer for use in a DVA composition is N-butylsulfonamide or other plasticizers suitable for<br>
polyamides.  In another embodiment, rubber process oils such as naphthenic, aromatic or paraffinic extender oils may be present at about 1 to about 5 phr.  In still another embodiment, naphthenic, aliphatic, paraffinic and other aromatic oils are substantially absent from the composition.  By "substantially absent", it is meant that naphthenic, aliphatic, paraffinic and other aromatic oils may be present, if at all, to an extent no greater than 1 phr in the composition.  In still another embodiment, naphthenic, aliphatic, paraffinic and other aromatic oils are present at less than 2 phr.<br>
The term "dynamic vulcanization" is used herein to denote a vulcanization process in which the engineering resin and the rubber are mixed under conditions of high shear and elevated temperature in the presence of a curing agent.  As a result, the rubber is simultaneously . crosslinked and dispersed as fine particles, for example, in the form of a microgel, within the engineering resin which forms a continuous matrix; the resulting composition is known in the art as a "dynamically vulcanized alloy" or DVA.  Dynamic vulcanization is effected by mixing the ingredients at a temperature which is at or above the curing temperature of the rubber using equipment such as roll mills, Banbury® mixers, continuous mixers, kneaders, or mixing extruders ( such as twin screw extruders).  The unique characteristic of the dynamically cured composition is that, notwithstanding the fact that the rubber is cured, the composition can be processed and reprocessed by conventional thermoplastic processing techniques such as extrusion, injection molding, compression molding, etc.  Scrap and or flashing can also be salvaged and reprocessed.<br>
The dynamic vulcanization process is conducted at conditions to vulcanize at least partially, preferably fully, the elastomeric halogen-containing copolymer.  To accomplish this, the thermoplastic engineering resin, the elastomeric copolymer and optional other polymers, are<br>
mixed together at a temperature sufficient to soften the resin or, more commonly, at a temperature above the melting point of a crystalline or semi-crystalline resin. Preferably the cure system is premixed in the elastomer component.  Heating and masticating at vulcanization temperatures are generally adequate to complete vulcanization in about 0.5 to about 10 minutes.  The vulcanization time can be reduced by elevating the temperature of vulcanization.  A suitable range of vulcanization temperatures is typically from about the melting point of the thermoplastic resin to about 300 °C; for example, the temperature may range from about the melting point of the matrix resin to about 275 °C. Preferably the vulcanization is carried out at a temperature range from about 10 °C to about 50 °C above the melting temperature of the matrix resin.<br>
It is preferred that the mixing process be continued until the desired level of vulcanization or crosslinking is completed.  If vulcanization is permitted to continue after mixing has stopped, the composition may not be reprocessable as a thermoplastic.  However, dynamic vulcanization can be carried out in stages.  For example, vulcanization can be commenced in a twin screw extruder and pellets formed of the DVA material or material using an underwater pelletizer, thereby quenching the vulcanization before it is completed.  The vulcanization process can be completed at a later time under dynamic vulcanization conditions.  Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate the appropriate quantities, types of curatives and extent of mixing time required to carry out the vulcanization of the rubber.  Where necessary or desirable to establish the appropriate concentrations and conditions, the rubber alone can be vulcanized using varying amounts of curative, which may include one or more curatives and/or accelerators, to determine the optimum cure system to be utilized and the appropriate<br>
cure conditions to achieve a substantially full cure.<br>
While it is preferred that all components be present in the mixture prior to carrying out the dynamic vulcanization process, this is not a necessary condition. For example, in one embodiment, the elastomer to be cured can be dynamically vulcanized in the presence of a portion or all of the thermoplastic engineering resin. This blend can then be let down, or dispersed under suitable conditions into additional thermoplastic engineering resin.  Similarly, it is not necessary to add all of the fillers and oil, when used, prior to the dynamic vulcanization stage.  A portion or all of the fillers and oil can be added after the vulcanization is completed.  Certain ingredients, such as stabilizers and process aids function more effectively if they are added after curing.<br>
The degree of cure of the vulcanized rubber can be described in terms of gel content, cross-link density, the amount of extractable components or it can be based on the state of cure that would be achieved in the rubber were it to be cured in the absence of the resin.  For example, in the present disclosure, it is preferred that the halogenated elastomer achieve about 50 to about 85% of full cure based on the elastomer per se as measured, e.g., by tensile strength or using the oscillating disc cure meter test (ASTM D 2084, Standard Test Method for Rubber Property-Vulcanization Using Oscillating Disk Cure Meter).<br>
Typically, the vulcanizable tie layer composition comprises a mixture (expressed as parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of total rubber present in the mixture) of:  (1)  about 10 parts to about 70 parts of epoxidized natural rubber; (2)  about 30 parts to about 90 parts of at least one high diene elastomer; (3)  about 20 parts to about 90 parts of at least one filler; (4) about 1 parts to about 20 parts of at least one tack improving component (tackifier); and (5)  at least about<br>
0.1 to about 15 parts of a curing system for the elastomers.  Optionally, the tie layer composition can include greater than about 0 parts to about 20 parts of at least one processing oil.  In a preferred embodiment the epoxidized natural rubber comprises about 50±2 mole% epoxide.  Alternatively, the amount of epoxidized natural rubber suitable for use in tie layer compositions, expressed in parts by weight per hundred parts of total rubber in the mixture, is selected from the group • consisting of: 10-70; 20-60; 30-50; 25-55; 33-48; and 40 parts by weight.<br>
The high diene elastomer suitable for use in the tie layer compositions of the present disclosure is preferably a natural or synthetic rubber, most preferably natural rubber, comprising at least 50 mole % of diene monomer and selected from the group consisting of polyisoprene, polybutadiene, poly(styrene-co-butadiene), poly(styrene-butadiene-styrene) block copolymer, natural rubber and mixtures -hereof.  The amount of the at least one high diene elastomer suitable for use in the tie layer compositions, expressed in parts by weight per hundred parts of total rubber in the mixture, is selected from the group consisting of: 30-90, 35-80; 40-70; 45-70; 50-65; and 60 parts by weight.<br>
Fillers useful in the tie layer include at least one filler is selected from the group consisting of carbon black, clay, exfoliated clay, intercalated clay, dispersed clay, calcium carbonate, mica, silica, silicates, talc, titanium dioxide, wood flour and mixtures thereof.  Preferably, the filler is selected from the group consisting of carbon black, exfoliated clay, intercalated clay, and dispersed clay, and mixtures thereof. . The amount of the at least one filler, expressed in terms of parts by weight per 100 parts total by weight of rubber, is typically about 20 parts to about 90 parts; preferably about 25 parts to about 85 parts; for example about 30 parts to about 80 parts; or about 35<br>
parts to about 70 parts; such as 60 parts; alternatively 50 parts.<br>
The tie layer optionally includes a rubber process or plasticizer oil selected from those described hereinabove.  Suitable plasticizer oils include aliphatic acid esters or hydrocarbon plasticizer oils such as paraffinic or naphthenic petroleum oils or polybutene oils.  The amount of the rubber process oil or plasticizer oil, expressed on the basis of parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of total rubber present in the composition, is typically about 0 to about 20 parts; preferably about 0 to about 15 parts; more preferably about 0 to about 10 parts, based on the total weight of the tie layer composition.  When used, the process oil preferably is a naphthenic or polybutene type oil; most preferably a polybutene oil.<br>
The tie layer is cured or vulcanized using a cure system comprising at least one curing agent and at least one accelerator useful for the halogenated isobutylene-containing elastomers and high diene elastomers comprising the composition.  Such curing agents and accelerators are described above and can also be found in standard reference texts of materials useful for compounding rubber.  See, for example, "Blue Book 2000 (and later editions), materials, compounding ingredients, machinery and services for rubber," D.R. Smith ed., 2000, Lippincott &amp; Peto Inc. Publication.  Typically the cure system is present in the amount of at least about 0.1 to about 15 parts per hundred of rubber (phr), although, as one of ordinary skill in the art will know, the specific amount of the cure system is not limited and the amount used will depend, in large measure, on the particular components of the cure system selected.<br>
Further optional, useful additives are typically added at a level of less than about 10 phr and can be selected from the group consisting of pigments, antioxidants, antiozonants, processing aids, compound<br>
compatibilizers and the like and mixtures thereof.  Such optional additives can be included at the discretion of the compounder in order to achieve a particular advantage in the composition, e.g., the use of an antioxidant to improve heat aging characteristics of the cured composition.<br>
In a preferred embodiment at least one tackifier is included in the tie layer composition.  For purposes of the present disclosure, a tackifier includes materials identified as rosins or rosin derivatives as well as various derivatives such as acetylene-phenolic compounds that are known as tackifiers for elastomer or polymer containing compositions.  Particularly useful tackifiers include condensation products of butyl phenol and acetylene, such as acetylene-p-tert-butyl phenol, available commercially as "Koresin" (BASF) and rosin tackifier available commercially as "MR1085A" (Mobile Rosin Oil Company, Mobile, AL), a blend of tall oil rosin and fatty acids (for purposes of the present disclosure, blends including rosin are included within the description of "rosin derivatives").  Tackifiers useful in elastomer compounds and the rubber compounding industry in general are listed and described, for example, in the "Blue Book 2000," D.R. Smith, Ed., pages 245-253 (Lippincott &amp; Peto Inc., 2000).  Some tackifiers are designated as particularly useful for imparting tack to specific polymers or elastomers, but it may be determined that they are also useful for compounds of the present disclosure.  Tackiness generally refers to the ability of an uncured rubber compound to stick to itself or to another compound when the compounds are contacted using a relatively short dwell time and only a moderate amount of pressure (Rubber Technology: Compounding and Testing for Performance," J.S. Dick, Ed., 42, 2001).  The dwell time and pressure are often determined by the equipment used for that purpose and by the potential for a sheet of the uncured composition to be damaged by<br>
excessive pressure and dwell time.  Tack can also be affected by the solubility of the various rubber components in one another as well as in the overall composition.  In some instances, a component of the composition may diffuse to the surface of a calendered or extruded sheet or film and either interfere with tack, for example, if it is an inorganic particulate (sometime referred to as "bloom").  On the other hand such diffusion may improve tack, for example, if the diffusing component is a one that itself exhibits tack.  It is appreciated by those skilled in the art that tack is a difficult property to measure and, at times one skilled in the art may be required to determine if a composition has achieved a sufficient level of tack by evaluating performance of the composition(s) in a factory trial or environment in which the end product is produced.  In the present case, that will typically involve actual tire building and a determination of whether the tie layer exhibits sufficient nire building tack so that the uncured tire construction will hold together during the tire building stage and during initial stages inflation during vulcanization until the structure achieves a sufficient level of cure and, consequently, cured adhesion of the various tire layers to one another; including adhesion of the tie layer to those layers that with which it is in proximate contact, including, for example, the carcass layer and the innerliner layer. There are no standardized test procedures for measuring tack of rubber compounds, but a widely used instrument is the "Tel-Tak Tackmeter," introduced by Monsanto in 1969. Another test instrument is the PICMA tack tester made by Toyo Seiki Seisakusho (Japan).  In a preferred embodiment of the present disclosure, at least one tackifier is added to the tie layer composition at a concentration of about 1 phr to about 20 phr; preferably about 2 phr to about 18 phr; more preferably about 3 phr to about 16 phr; for example, about 4 phr to about 14 phr.<br>
Alternatively, the at least one tackifier is typically used at a level of about 15 phr or less; preferably about 12 phr or less; more preferably about 10 phr or less; still more preferably about 9 phr or less; most preferably about 8 phr or less; such as, for example, about 1 phr to about 10 phr; about 1 phr to about 9 phr; about 2 phr to about 9 phr; about 2 phr to about 8 phr; about 2 phr to about 7 phr and the like, including individual values and ranges including each of the values, in phr, of about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.  Similarly, where a mixture of tackifiers is used, such as for example two tackifiers of the same or different chemical type, each of the tackifiers can be present in equal amounts or in amounts that are not equal, the total amount of tackifier used preferably constrained by the total amounts recited immediately above.<br>
The tie layer composition can be prepared using mixing equipment such as Banbury mixers, mill roll mixers, extruder mixers and the like, individually and in combination in order to mix the elastomers, filler(s), processing oil and other additives as well as to disperse the cure system components.  Typically the ingredients other than the cure system components are mixed at elevated temperature and high shear to obtain satisfactory dispersion of all non-elastomeric components into the elastomers and of the elastomers in one another. After such a mixing step, the composition absent the cure system components, sometimes referred to as a masterbatch, is cooled to a lower temperature using, e.g., a rubber mill or a lower temperature, lower shear section of a mixing extruder or an internal mixer and the cure system components are dispersed into the masterbatch.  The temperature for mixing curatives is typically less than about 120 °C, preferably less than about 100 °C.<br>
The vulcanizable tie layer composition can be formed<br>
into a layer suitable for the end use application, using, for example, an extruder or a calender.  Where convenient or useful, extrusion can include the use of equipment allowing for the dual or multiple extrusion of the fluid (preferably air) permeation prevention layer, the tie layer and the outside, high diene rubber layer.  In a preferred embodiment, the tie layer is prepared for use in a tire construction and has a thickness that is typically about 5 mm or less; preferably about 2.5 mm or less; more preferably about 0.2 to about 2.0 mm; most preferably about 0.2 to about 1.5 mm; for example about 0.3 to about 0.9 mm.  The thickness of the tie layer for use in a hose construction can be the same or different depending on the application in which the hose will be employed.  For example, an unreinforced, low pressure hose can have different performance requirements than a high pressure, reinforced hose and, similarly, a hose intended for use with a liquid can differ from one for use with a gas.  Adjustment of the thickness is within the skill of the product designer, engineer or chemist, based, if necessary, on limited experimentation.<br>
Mixing of the components may be carried out by combining the polymer components and, when the filler is clay, the clay in the form of an intercalate in any suitable mixing device such as a Banbury™ mixer, Brabender™ mixer (for laboratory mixing) or preferably a mixer/extruder.  Mixing is performed typically at temperatures equal to or greater than about the softening point of the elastomer and/or secondary elastomer or rubber used in the composition; for example, about 8 0 °C up to about 300 °C in another embodiment, and from 120 °C to about 250 °C in yet another embodiment, under conditions of shear sufficient to allow the clay intercalate to exfoliate and become uniformly dispersed within the polymer to form a nanocomposite.  When preparing a composition that is not dynamically<br>
vulcanized, typically, about 70% to about 100% of the elastomer or elastomers is first mixed for about 20 to about 90 seconds, or until the temperature reaches about 40 to about 60°C.  Then, the filler, and the remaining amount of elastomer, if any, is typically added to the mixer, and mixing continues until the temperature reaches about 90 °C to about 150 CC.  The finished mixture is then sheeted on an open mill and allowed to cool to about 60 °C to about 100 °C at which time the cure system or curatives are added.  Alternatively, the cure system can be mixed in an internal mixer or mixing extruder provided that suitable care is exercised to control the temperature in order to avoid premature curing during mixing, otherwise known as scorching.<br>
Mixing with clays is performed by techniques known to those skilled in the art, wherein clay is added to the polymer (s) at the same time as the carbon black in one embodiment.  The processing oil, when used, is typically added later in the mixing cycle after the carbon black and clay have achieved adequate dispersion in the elastomeric or polymer matrix.<br>
The compositions of the present disclosure and layered structures formed using such compositions can be used in tire applications; tire curing bladders; air sleeves, such as air shock absorbers, diaphragms; and hose applications, including gas and fluid transporting hoses.  The compositions and tie layer comprising such compositions are particularly useful in pneumatic tires to facilitate the adhesion and air holding qualities of a tire innerliner to the inner surface of the tire.  An especially useful construction is one in which a tire innerliner layer forms the innermost surface of the tire and the innerliner layer surface opposite the one that forms the air holding chamber is in contact with the tie layer of the present disclosure.  Alternatively, an adhesive layer can be used between the innerliner layer<br>
and the tie layer.  The surface of the tie layer opposite the one that is in contact with the innerliner (or adhesive layer) is in contact with the tire layer referred to as the carcass; in other words, the tire layer typically comprising reinforcing tire cords.  As discussed in detail above, the innerliner layer exhibits advantageously low permeability properties and preferably comprises a dynamically vulcanized composition comprising an engineering resin, particularly polyamide, and a halogenated isobutylene-paramethyl styrene copolymer. Furthermore, as a consequence of the unique composition of the tie layer based on epoxidized natural rubber and tackifier, in particular uncured tack strength and ability to generate high vulcanized adhesion to the innerliner layer surface in which it is in contact, allows for the use of a thin tie layer compared to compositions of the prior art.  The resulting overall structure based on such innerliner and tie layers allows for a tire construction (as well as other constructions comprising an air or fluid holding layer and tie layer) having reduced weight.  Such weight savings in a tire construction are significant:<br>
The tire innerliner composition (i.e. preferably a DVA of nylon and BIMS) may be prepared by using conventional mixing techniques including, e.g., kneading, roller milling, extruder mixing, internal mixing (such as<br>
with a Banbury® mixer) etc.  The sequence of mixing and temperatures employed are well known to the rubber compounder of ordinary skill in the art, the objective being the dispersion of fillers, activators and curatives in the polymer matrix under controlled conditions of temperature that will vary depending on whether the innerliner is based on the incorporation of an engineering resin in combination with DVA technology, as described above, or on non-DVA technology.  For preparation of an innerliner based on non-DVA technology, a useful mixing procedure utilizes a Banbury mixer in<br>
which the copolymer rubber, carbon black and plasticizer are added and the composition mixed for the desired time or to a particular temperature to achieve adequate dispersion of the ingredients.  Alternatively, the rubber and a portion of the carbon black (e.g., one-third to two thirds) is mixed for a short time (e.g., about 1 to 3 minutes) followed by the remainder of the carbon black and oil.  Mixing is continued for about 5 to 10 minutes at high rotor speed during which time the mixed components reach a temperature of about 140 °C.  Following cooling, the components are mixed in a second step, e.g., on a rubber mill or in a Banbury mixer, during which the cure system, e.g., curing agent and optional accelerators, are thoroughly and uniformly dispersed at relatively low temperature, e.g., about 80 to about 105 °C, to avoid premature curing or "scoirching" of the composition.  Variations in mixing will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art and the present disclosure is not limited to any specific mixing procedure.  The mixing is performed to disperse all components of the composition thoroughly and uniformly.<br>
The innerliner layer or "stock" is then prepared by calendering the compounded rubber composition into sheet material having a thickness of about 0.5 mm to about 2 mm and cutting the sheet material into strips of appropriate width and length for innerliner application in a particular size or type tire.  The innerliner is then ready for use as an element in the construction of a pneumatic tire.  The pneumatic tire is typically comprised of a multilayered laminate comprising an outer surface which includes the tread and sidewall elements, an intermediate carcass layer which comprises a number of plies containing tire reinforcing fibers, (e.g., rayon, polyester, nylon or metal fibers) embedded in a rubbery matrix, a tie layer as described herein, an optional adhesive layer, and an innerliner layer.  Tires are normally built on a tire forming drum using the layers<br>
described above.  After the uncured tire has been built on the drum, it is removed and placed in a heated mold. The mold contains an inflatable tire shaping bladder that is situated within the inner circumference of the uncured tire.  After the mold is closed the bladder is inflated and it shapes the tire by forcing it against the inner surfaces of the closed mold during the early stages of the curing process.  The heat within the bladder and mold raises the temperature of the tire to vulcanization temperatures.  Vulcanization temperatures are typically about 100 °C to about 250 °C; preferably about 150 °C to about 200 °C.  Cure time may vary from about one minute to several hours; preferably from about 5 to 30 minutes. Cure time and temperature depend on many variables well known in the art, including the composition of the tire components, including the cure systems in each of the layers, the overall tire size and thickness, etc. Vulcanization parameters can be established with the assistance of various well-known laboratory test methods, including the test procedure described in ASTM D 2084 (Standard Test Method for Rubber Property-Vulcanization Using Oscillating Disk Cure Meter) as well as stress-strain testing, adhesion testing, flex testing, etc. Vulcanization of the assembled tire results in complete or substantially complete vulcanization or crosslinking of all elements or layers of the tire assembly, i.e., the innerliner, the carcass and the outer tread and sidewall layers.  In addition to developing the desired strength characteristics of each layer and the overall structure, vulcanization enhances adhesion between these elements, resulting in a cured, unitary tire from what were separate, multiple layers.<br>

On the tire inner surface, inside of the carcass layer 2 there is provided an innerliner layer 3.

The following examples are provided as specific illustrations of embodiments of the claimed disclosure. It should be understood, however, that the disclosure is not limited to the specific details set forth in the examples.  All parts and percentages in the examples, as well as in the specification, are by weight unless otherwise specified.  Furthermore, any range of numbers recited in the specification or claims, such as that representing a particular set of properties, units of measure, conditions, physical states or percentages, is intended to literally incorporate expressly herein by reference or otherwise, any number falling within such range, including any subset of numbers within any range so recited.  For example, whenever a numerical range with a lower limit, RL, and an upper limit RD, is disclosed, any number R falling within the range is specifically disclosed.  In particular, the following numbers R within the range are specifically disclosed:  R = RL + k(Ru -RL) , where k is a variable ranging from 1% to 100% with a 1% increment, e.g., k is 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%. ... 50%, 51%, 52%. ... 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100%.  Moreover, any numerical range represented by any two values of R, as calculated above is also specifically disclosed.<br>
For purposes of the present disclosure, unless otherwise defined with respect to a specific property, characteristic or variable, the term "substantially" as applied to any criteria, such as a property, characteristic or variable, means to meet the stated criteria in such measure such that one skilled in the art<br>
would understand that the benefit to be achieved, or the condition or property value desired is met.<br>
Throughout the entire specification, including the claims, the word "comprise" and variations of the word, such as "comprising" and "comprises," as well as "have," "having," "includes," "include" and "including," and variations thereof, means that the named steps, elements or materials to which it refers are essential, but other steps, elements or materials may be added and still form a construct, composition or process within the scope of the claim or disclosure.  When recited in describing the disclosure and in a claim, it means that the disclosure and what is claimed is considered to be what follows and potentially more.  These terms, particularly when applied to claims, are inclusive or open-ended and do not exclude additional, unrecited elements or methods steps.<br>
In the present context the phrase "consisting essentially of" is meant to exclude any element or combination of elements as well as any amount of any element or combination of elements that would alter the basic and novel characteristics of the disclosure.  Thus, by way of example, a layered construction in which high diene rubber or other polymer or polymer combination is used to the exclusion of epoxidized natural rubber in a tie layer and/or in which an air permeation prevention layer is prepared from a composition other than by dynamically vulcanizing an engineering resin-containing composition would be excluded.  Similarly, and again for exemplary purposes only, a tie layer containing one or more additional additive(s) that does not interfere with achieving a suitable level of tack strength and cured adhesion of the resulting layered structure would not be excluded.  For example, a small amount of compatibilizer, antioxidant, process oil, or other low molecular weight additives, to the extent that they do not significantly impair the tack, adhesion or air or fluid permeability of the layered structure or tie layer, could still be used.<br>
As used throughout the specification, including the described embodiments, the singular forms "a," an," and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.  Thus, for example, reference to "a tackifier" includes a single tackifier as well a two or more different tackifiers in combination; reference to "an epoxidized natural rubber" includes mixtures of two or more epoxidized natural rubbers as well as an epoxidized natural rubber, and the like.<br>
The term "about" encompasses greater and lesser values than those specifically recited provided that the value of the relevant property or condition facilitates reasonably meeting the technologic objective(s) of the present disclosure as described in detail in the specification and claims.  More specifically, the term "about" when used as a modifier for, or in conjunction with, a variable, is intended to convey that the numbers and ranges disclosed herein are flexible and that practice of the present disclosure by those skilled in the art using, for example, concentrations, amounts, contents, carbon numbers, temperatures, pressures, properties such as density, purity, strength, tack, etc., that are outside of a stated range or different from a single value, will achieve the desired result, namely, an elastomer composition comprising an epoxidized natural rubber, preferably in combination with at least one tackifier, suitable for use in a tie layer, wherein the composition has improved building tack, cured adhesion and impermeability properties useful in constructions such as pneumatic tires and the like.<br>
In an alternate embodiment, the compositions described herein may be used in a pressure vessel, e.g. any vessel designed to hold greater than atmospheric pressure of a fluid (liquid or gas, such as air or water).  Preferably the vessel holds at least 10 psi of pressure for 24 hours at 230 °C, more preferably at least 20 psi.<br>

In accordance with the compositions or formulations listed in Table 1, Comparative Examples 1 to 6 were prepared using a Banbury™ internal mixer and mixed using standard, non-DVA mixing procedures.  In a typical mix cycle, a Banbury internal mixer is preheated to between 4 0 °C and 60 °C and the polymers are added and mixed; at one minute the remainder of the ingredients (except curatives) are added and mixing is continued to a temperature of about 130 °C to about 150 °C at which time the composition is dumped and cooled.  The cooled material is then placed back in the Banbury mixer at a temperature below that which would cause the cure system components to react and the components of the cure system are added to the composition in the Banbury mixer and the composition mixed to a temperature of about 100 °C and then released from the mixer ("dumped") and cooled.<br>
