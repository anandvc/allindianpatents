It has been recognised that obesity is a disease process influenced by environmental factors in which the traditional weight loss methods of dieting and exercise need to be<br>
supplemented by therapeutic products (S. Parker, "Obesity: Trends and Treatments", Scrip Reports, PJB Publications Ltd, 1996).<br>
Whether someone is classified as overweight or obese is generally determined on the basis of their body mass index (BMI), which is calculated by dividing body weight<br>
*)	"5<br>
(kg) by height squared (m ). Thus, the units of BMI are kg/m and it is possible to calculate the BMI range associated with minimum mortality in each decade of life. Overweight is defined as a BMI in the range 25-30 kg/m2, and obesity as a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2. There are problems with this definition in that it does not take into account the proportion of body mass that is muscle in relation to fat (adipose tissue). To account for this, obesity can also be defined on the basis of body fat content: greater than 25% and 30% in males and females, respectively.As the BMI increases there is an increased risk of death from a variety of causes that is independent of other risk factors. The most common diseases with obesity are cardiovascular disease (particularly hypertension), diabetes (obesity aggravates the development of diabetes), gall bladder disease (particularly cancer) and diseases of reproduction. Research has shown that even a modest reduction in body weight can correspond to a significant reduction in the risk of developing coronary heart disease.<br>
Compounds marketed as anti-obesity agents include Orlistat (XENICAL®) and Sibutramine. Orlistat (a lipase inhibitor) inhibits fat absorption directly and tends to produce a high incidence of unpleasant (though relatively harmLess) side-effects such as diarrhoea. Sibutramine (a mixed 5-HT/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor) can increase blood pressure and heart rate in some patients. The serotonin releaser/reuptake inhibitors fenfluramine (Pondimin®) and dexfenfluramine (Redux™) have been reported to decrease food intake and body weight over a prolonged period (greater than 6 months). However, both products were withdrawn after reports of preliminary evidence of heart valve abnormalities associated with their use. There is therefore a need for the development of a safer anti-obesity agent.<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide selective, directly acting 5HT2 receptor ligands for use in therapy and particularly for use as anti-obesity agents. It is a further object of this invention to provide directly acting ligands selective for 5-HT2B and/or 5-HTac receptors, for use in therapy and particularly for use as anti-obesity agents. It is a further object of this invention to provide selective, directly acting 5-HT2C receptor ligands, preferably S-HTac receptor agonists, for use in therapy and particularly for use as anti-obesity agents.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are useful in the treatment and/or prevention of disorders involving elevated plasma blood glucose, particularly diabetes mellitus (including Type II or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM); Type I or insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM); and Type III or malnutrition-related diabetes). The diabetes may be diabetes secondary to pancreatic disease; or diabetes related to steroid use. The compounds of formula (I) are also useful in the treatment and/or prevention of the sequelae of hyperglycaemia; in the treatment and/or prevention of diabetic complications; and in the treatment of insulin dependence.<br>
The invention is of particular use in the treatment or prevention of diabetes mellitus (including Type II or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM); Type I or insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM); and Type III or malnutrition-related diabetes), and particularly in the treatment or prevention of Type II diabetes.<br>
The present invention encompasses the use of compounds according to formula I for the acute and/or chronic treatment and/or prevention of disorders involving elevated plasma blood glucose, particularly the acute and/or chronic treatment of disorders involving elevated plasma blood glucose, and especially acute treatment of disorders involving elevated plasma blood glucose.<br>
Diabetes is a disease in which a patient's ability to control glucose levels in blood is impaired, because the ability to respond properly to the action of insulin has been partially lost. In type II diabetes, often referred to as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), which afflicts 80-90% of all diabetic patients in developed countries, the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas still produce insulin. However, the target organs, mainly muscle, liver and adipose tissue, exhibit a profound resistance to insulin<br>
stimulation, thus the body compensates by producing abnormally high levels of insulin. In the later stages of the disease, however, insulin secretion decreases due to pancreas exhaustion.<br>
Current first line treatment for diabetes generally involves adoption of a diet low in fat and glucose and taking regular exercise. However, compliance can be moderate and as the disease progresses, treatment with hypoglycemic drugs, e.g. sulfonylureas or metformin, becomes necessary. A promising new class of drugs has recently been introduced that resensitize patients to their own insulin (insulin sensitizers), thereby reverting blood glucose and triglyceride levels to normal, and thus abolishing, or at least reducing, the requirement for exogenous insulin. Trogiitazone (Resulin™) and rosiglitazone (AvandiarM) belong to the miazolidinediones (TZD) class of PPARy-agonists and were the first representatives of the class approved for NIDDM treatment in several countries. These compounds, however, suffer from side effects including rare but severe liver toxicity (as seen with troglitazone), and increased body weight in humans. Therefore, new, better and more efficacious drugs for the treatment of conditions involving hyperglycemia, particularly NIDDM are urgently needed. Recent studies provided evidence that coagonism of PPARa and PPARy would result in compounds with enhanced therapeutic potential, i. e. with an improved lipid profile effect on top of the normalization of glucose- and insulin-levels (Keller and Wahli: Trends Endocrin. Metab. 1993; 4: 291-296, Macdonald and Lane: Current Biology Vol.5 pp. 618-621 (1995)). The novel compounds of the present invention can be used as efficacious drugs for the treatment and prevention of diabetes, particularly of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.<br>

Processes for the manufacture of the compounds according to formula I are an object of the present invention. The substituents and indices used in the following schemes have the significance given above unless indicated to the contrary.<br>
Hydroxy groups can be protected in the following reactions by methods known in the art such as for example tert-butyl-dimethylsilyl.<br>
Scheme 1<br><br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
l,2,3,4-Tetrahydro[2,4a,5]triaza-fluorenes of formula II can be prepared according to scheme 1 by a process where the 7-aza-indole-2-carboxylate of formula A is first reacted with an alpha halo alkanenitrile (e.g. 2-bromo propionitrile) in a suitable solvent (e.g. N,N-dimethylforrnamide) with a suitable base (e.g. sodium hydride). Compounds of formula II correspond to compounds of formula I, wherein R4 is hydrogen.<br>
The intermediate B is reduced and cyclized to the tetrahydro[2,4a,5]triaza-fluorene II by reaction with a suitable reducing agent in a suitable solvent (e.g. LiAlH4 in tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether). Ra in scheme 1 is an alkyl group, preferably a lower alkyl group, preferably methyl or ethyl.<br>
Preparation of compounds according to formula A:<br>
Compounds of formula A, wherein R1 is hydrogen or halogen, particularly chlorine and R2 is hydrogen, particularly chlorine and R3 is hydrogen are described in WO 0044753.<br>
Compounds of formula A, wherein R1, R2 and R3 are defined as before with the proviso that R1 and R2 is are not hydrogen can be obtained by an analogous process as described in WO 0044753 by, e.g. oxidation of the pyridine nitrogen to the N-oxide under appropriate oxidizing conditions, such as meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid in dichloromethane and treatment of the N-oxide with a nucleophilic system, such as neat acetic acid anhydride or benzoic acid bromide in the presence of a suitable base, like e.g. hexamethyldisilazane in a suitable solvent such as, e.g. tetrahydrofuran. The indole nitrogen can be optionally protected in this process, preferably with a Boc group.<br>
Compound of formula A, wherein R1, R2 and R3 are as defined before with the proviso that R1, R2 and R3 are not halogen can also be obtained by analogous process as described in Synthesis 1996, 877 from N-protected (preferably Boc) 3-alkyl-2-aminopyridines, through double deprotonation with a base, such as n-butyllithium in a suitable solvent like, e.g. tetrahydrofuran and subsequent treatment of the intermediate with diethyloxalate and dehydration of the resulting adduct under acidic conditions, e.g. with hydrochloric acid in an appropriate alcohol, such as, e.g. ethanol.<br>
Alpha halo alkanenitriles can be either purchased from commercial sources or synthesized from, e.g. reaction of acrylonitrile with bromoalkanes under UV irradiation in the presence of, e.g. triphenylphosphine and a suitable catalyst such as copper(I)chloride in an appropriate solvent like, e.g. tetrahydrofuran (analogous to the process described in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983, 105(22), 6719). Alpha halo alkanenitriles can also be prepared in a process, where an alkoxyacetonitrile derivative is irradiated in the presence of a suitable brominating agent like, e.g. N-bromosuccinimide in tetrahydrofuran (analogous to the process described in J. Org. Chem. 1976, 14 (17), 2846). In the case where R5 is hydroxymethyl the free OH is protected.<br>
Scheme 2<br>
methyl ether<br>
l,2,3,4-Tetrahydro[2,4a,5]triaza-fluorenes of formula II can also be prepared according to scheme 2 by a process where the 7-aza-indole-2-carboxylate of formula A is first reacted with the Boc-sulfamidate IX in a suitable solvent (e.g. N,N-dimethylformamide) with a suitable base (e.g. potassium tert-butylate or sodium hydride) followed by removal of the Boc protecting group (Boc means tert-butoxycarbonyl) with a suitable reagent e.g. trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and ring closure in the presence of base<br>
(e.g. potassium carbonate). The stereochemistry of the carbon atom attached to R5 in Boc-sulfamidate IX is inverted (&gt;90% e.e.) in this reaction sequence. The intermediate amide D is reduced with a suitable reducing agent in a suitable solvent (e.g. LiAlH4 in tert-butyl methyl ether or borane-dimethylsulfide complex in tetrahydrofuran). Ra in scheme 2 is an alkyl group, preferably a lower alkyl group, preferably methyl or ethyl. Compounds II are defined as in scheme 1. Chiral compounds according to formula II can e.g. be obtained as follows:<br>
Scheme 3<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
If racemic Boc-sulfamidate IX is used in this process, the enantiomers of intermediate D can be obtained by methods known in the art, e.g. by preparative chiral HPLC.<br>
Scheme 4<br><br><br>
e enantiomers of l,2,3,4-tetrahydro[2,4a,5]triaza-fluorenes II can be obtained either by using a chiral sulfamidate IX or by separation of the enantiomers by preparative<br>
chiral HPLC or by crystallisation with suitable chiral acids, separation of the diastereomeric salts and isolation of the enantiomers from these salts. An alternative access to the enantiomers of l,2,3,4-tetrahydro[2,4a,5]triaza-fluorenes II involves the separation of the enantiomers of the precursor C, e.g. by preparative chiral HPLC.<br>
Scheme 5<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
7-Aza-indole derivatives H can be prepared according to scheme 5, starting from optionally protected  o-iodoanilines 2-amino-3-iodopyridines (PG1  means a suitable<br>
protective group such as e.g. N-methoxycarbonyl) by cross-coupling reaction with suitably substituted and optionally protected carbinols (preferred protective groups PG2 are silyl ethers, especially preferred is tert-butyl-dimethylsilyl). The reaction proceeds in the presence of a suitable catalyst (e.g. bis(-triphenylphosphine) palladium dichloride and copper(I)iodide as co-catalyst) in a suitable solvent (e.g. triethylamine). The intermediate E is treated with a base (e.g. LiOH in tetrahydrofuran/water) to yield the indole derivative F. Alternatively, if the amine in intermediate E is unprotected (PG1 is hydrogen), intermediate F can be obtained by treatment of the intermediate E with trifluoroacetic acid anhydride followed by reaction with a suitable catalyst such as e.g. palladium(II)acetate and heating the reaction mixture in an appropriate solvent (e.g. triethylamine). After deprotection (e.g. with tetrabutylammonium fluoride) in a suitable solvent (e.g. tetrahydrofuran), the resulting alcohol is oxidized (e. g., with manganese dioxide in dichloromethane), to yield the indole derivative G. Alkylation of G with the Boc-sulfamidate X in a suitable solvent (e.g. N,N-dimethylformamide) in the presence of a suitable base (e.g. sodium hydride or potassium tert-butylate) leads to intermediate H. The stereochemistry of the carbon atom attached to R5 in Boc-sulfamidate IX is inverted (&gt;90% e.e.) in this reaction sequence. Alternatively, the intermediate F can be subjected to alkylation with the Boc-sulfamidate IX under similar conditions as mentioned above lor the conversion of G to H, to furnish intermediate I which can be converted to intermediate H by deprotection and oxidation as mentioned in the conversion of F to G.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula H can be prepared according to scheme 6: Scheme 6<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
7-Aza-indole derivatives H can also be prepared according to scheme 6, starting from protected o-iodoanilines (a suitable protective group, PG, is, e.g. N-methoxycarbonyl) by cross-coupling reaction with propargyl alcohol derivatives in the presence of a suitable catalyst (e.g. bis-triphenylphosphine palladium dichloride and copper(I)iodide as co-catalyst) in a suitable solvent (e.g. triethylamine), followed by treatment with a base (e.g. LiOH in tetrahydrofuran/water). The alcohol intermediate is oxidized, e. g. with manganese dioxide in dichloromethane, to yield the indole derivative G. Alkylation of G with the Boc-sulfamidate IX in a suitable solvent (e.g. N,N-dimethylformamide) in the presence of a suitable base (e.g. potassium tert-butylate or sodium hydride) leads to intermediate H. The stereochemistry of the carbon atom attached to R5 in Boc-sulfamidate IX is inverted (&gt;90% e.e.) in this reaction sequence.<br>
Scheme 7<br><br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
As described in scheme 7, the intermediates of formula H can be further processed to compounds of formula II by either removal of the Boc protecting group (e. g., with trifluoroacetic acid) to yield an imine intermediate which is not isolated but reduced directly with lithium aluminium hydride to yield II as a separable mixture of epimers, or by direct reductive animation (e.g. with sodium triacetoxyborohydride, molecular sieves and acetic acid in a suitable solvent, e.g. dichloromethane) to yield compound III, followed by removal of the protecting group (e.g. with hydrochloric acid in ethyl acetate).<br>

(Scheme Removed)<br>
A variety of substituents R1, R2 and R3, preferably those functional groups that do not tolerate the methods described for the l,2,3,4-tetrahydro[2,4a,5]triaza-fluorenes synthesis can be introduced starting from l,2,3,4-tetrahydro[2,4a,5]triaza-fluorene II according to scheme 8. To that end, the amine nitrogen of II may be protected, e. g., as the tert-butyl carbamate, to generate compounds of formula III.<br>
Scheme 9<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
l,2,3,4-Tetrahydro[2,4a,5]triaza-fluorenes of formula II in which R3 equals a methyl substituent can also be prepared as depicted in scheme 9 from intermediate III by a two step process where an aldehyde moiety is first introduced by, e.g. a Vilsmeier-Haack formylation reaction and subsequent reduction of the formyl intermediate under suitable conditions (e. g., triethylsilane and trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane). Under these conditions the protective group may also be cleaved-off, e.g. if it is a tert-butyl carbamate group.<br>
Scheme 10<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
The hexahydro[2,4a,5]triaza-fluorene derivatives of formula V can be prepared as described in scheme 10 from compounds of formula II (analogous to WO 0044753) by reduction with suitable reducing agents in suitable solvents or solvent mixtures (e.g. sodium borohydride in tetrahydrofuran/TFA or NaCNBHs in acetic acid, respectively). Compounds of formula V may also be prepared from compounds of formula III (analogous to WO 0044753) by either simultaneous reduction and deprotection of the tert-butoxy carbonyl group with suitable reducing agents in suitable acidic solvents or solvent mixtures (e.g. tetrahydrofuran/TFA) or via removal of the protecting group from intermediates IV, which in turn can be obtained by reduction of intermediates III with a suitable reducing agent in an appropriate solvent (e.g. sodium cyanoborohydride in e.g. acetic acid). Compounds of formula la can be prepared as shown in scheme 11:<br>
Scheme 11<br><br>

Hexahydro[2,4a,5]triaza-fluorene derivatives of formula la with the proviso that R1, R2 and R3 are not bromine can also be prepared as depicted in scheme 11 from intermediate J where the indole moiety is reduced with magnesium in methanol to produce indoline-amide K, which is then reduced under suitable conditions (e. g., LiAlH4 in diethyl ether). Compound J can be obtained according to Scheme 2 (R4 is hydrogen). In case R4 is alkyl compound J can be obtained e.g. by reaction of compound D with aikyl-Br under basic conditions.Scheme 12<br><br><br><br>

Compounds V with the proviso that R , R and R are not bromine can alternatively be prepared as depicted in scheme 12. Indole intermediates L are reduced with a suitable reducing agent (e.g. magnesium in methanol).

Assay Procedures<br>
1. Binding to serotonin receptors<br>
The binding of compounds of formula (I) to serotonin receptors was determined in vitro by standard methods. The preparations were investigated in accordance with the assays given hereinafter.<br>
Method (a): For the binding to the 5-HT2C receptor the 5-HT2C receptors were radiolabeled with [3H]-5-HT. The affinity of the compounds for 5-HT2C receptors in a CHO cell line was determined according to the procedure of D. Hoyer, G. Engel and H.O. Kalkman, European J. Pharmacol., 1985, 118, 13-23.<br>
Method (b): For the binding to the 5-HT2B receptor the 5-HT2B receptors were radiolabeled with [3H]-5-HT. The affinity of the compounds for human 5-HT2B receptors in a CHO cell line was determined according to the procedure of K. Schmuck, C. Ullmer, P. Engels and H. Lubbert, FEBS Lett., 1994, 342, 85-90.<br>
Method (c): For the binding to the 5-HT2A receptor the 5-HT2A receptors were radiolabeled with [125I]-DO1. The affinity of the compounds for 5-HT2A receptors in a CHO cell line was determined according to the procedure of D. J. McKenna and S. J. Peroutka,./ Neurosci., 1989, 9, 3482-90.<br>
The thus determined activity of the compound of the Example is shown in Table 1.<br>
Table<br><br>
Preferred compounds of formula I as described above have Ki (2C) values below 10000 nM; especially preferred compounds have Ki (2C) values below 1000 nM, particularly preferred compounds have Ki (2C) values below 100 nM. Most preferred compounds have Ki (2C) values below 30nM.<br>
2. Functional activity<br>
The functional activity of compounds of formula (I) was assayed using a Fluorimetric Imaging Plate reader (FLIPR). CHO cells expressing the human 5-HT2C or human 5-HTiA receptors were counted and plated into standard 96 well microtitre plates on the day before testing to give a confluent monolayer. The cells were then dye loaded with the calcium sensitive dye, Fluo-3-AM. Unincorporated dye was removed using an automated cell washer to leave a total volume of 100 |j.L/well of assay buffer (Hanks balanced salt solution containing 20 mM Hepes and 2.5 mM probenecid). The drug (dissolved in 50 ^L of the assay buffer) was added at a rate of 70 uL/sec to each well of the FLIPR 96 well plate during fluorescence measurements. The measurements were taken at 1 sec intervals and the maximum fluorescent signal was measured (approx 10-15 sees after drug addition) and compared with the response produced by 10 uM 5-HT (defined as 100%) to which it was expressed as a percentage response (relative efficacy). Dose response curves were constructed using Graphpad Prism (Graph Software Inc.).<br>

Preferred compounds of formula I as described above have activity at the h5-HT2c receptor below lOOOOnM; especially preferred compounds below lOOOnM, particularly preferred compounds below lOOnM. Most preferred compounds have activity at the h5-HT2c receptor below 30nM.<br>
3. Regulation of feeding behaviour<br>
The in vivo activity of compounds of formula (1) was assessed for their ability to regulate feeding behaviour by recording food consumption in food deprived animals.<br>
Rats were trained to have access to food for 2h per day and were food deprived for 22h. When they were trained under this schedule, the amount of food taken every day during these 2h food intake session was consistent day after day.<br>
To test the ability of the S-HTac receptor agonists to decrease food intake, 8 animals were used in a cross-over study. Rats were individually housed in plexiglass boxes with a grid on the floor and a paper was placed below the cage floor to collect any spillage. A food dispenser (becher) filled with a preweighed amount of food was presented to them for 2h. At the end of the food intake session, rats returned to their<br>
home cage.  Each rat was weighed before the start of the experiment and the amount of<br>
food consumed during this 2h food intake session was recorded. Either various doses of<br>
test compound or Vehicle was administered orally 60 min before the 2h food intake<br>
session. A positive control Sibutramine was included in the experiment.<br>
An Anova analysis with repeated measures was used followed by a posthoc test Student<br>
Neumann-Keuls, * P 
The minimum effective dose (m.e.d.) is defined as the lowest dose which produces a<br>
statistically significant reduction in food intake. The minimum effective doses for<br>
selected particularly preferred compounds of formula I are 30 mg/kg p.o. and below.<br>
