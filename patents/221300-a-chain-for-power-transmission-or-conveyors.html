A CHAIN FOR POWER TRANSMISSION OR CONVEYORS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to chains, which can be used for power transmission or conveyors.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The conventional chain used for power transmission and conveyors comprises plurality of bushes. Pairs of bushes are linked together with pairs of inner link plates on both ends of the bushes. Each said pair of bushes linked with a pair of inner link plates are linked to similar pairs of bushes linked with pairs of inner link plates by means of a pair of outer link plates and the ends of a pin through each bush is attached to the outer link plates to form the chain. A freely rotating roller is often provided on each bush for smooth operation.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The chain according to the invention comprises novel features which provides ease of assembly by press fitting.    The<br><br>
chain is formed without any rivetting and provides better strength and easy end connections.<br>
The chain according to the invention comprises plurality<br>
oushes in which pairs of bushes are linked with a pairs of inner links on both ends of each pair of bushes. The pairs of bushes linked with the pairs of inner links are linked together by pairs of outer links linking one of the bush from one pair of bushes linked with one pair of inner links with one of the bushes from another pair of bushes linked with another pair of inner links* The said outer link on each end of a pair of bushes comprises parts of a pair of pins passing through pair of bushes. Each pair of outer links are identical with part of one pin with an extended portion and a part of the adjacent pin with a recessed portion. The pair of outer links are fitted as a male-female joint with the pair of bushes between them, in which one bush is selected from adjacent pairs of bushes linked with one pair of inner links and the other bush is selected from an adjacent pair of bushes linked with another pair of inner links; such that one of the outer link with part of a pin having extended portion fitting into the other outer link with part of the same pin having recessed portion and vice versa.<br><br>
A chain is formed by linking number of pairs of bushes linked with pairs of inner links with pairs of outer links. Freely rotating rollers are preferably provided on each bush for smooth operation of the chain.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the chain according to the invention at least one pair of bushes linked with outer links are provided with a pair of threaded bolts passing through a central bore in the parts of the pins of each of the outer links. Part of the pin portions in which the bolts are received are provided with inner threads matching the outer threads on the bolts, so that the two outer links may be fixed to-gether by tightening the bolts and they may be separated by loosening the bolts. Such a link in a chain may serve as an end joint to form an endless chain.<br>
It is desirable to provide a pair of fatigue relieving gaps on each part of the pins in the outer links, close to flat portion of the outer links, to increase the fatigue life of the chain. A free running roller may be preferably provided on each bush for smooth operation of the chain.<br><br>
Thus the invention provides a chain for power transmission or conveyors, said chain comprising plurality of bushes, pairs of said bushes being linked together with a pair of inner links; said pairs of bushes linked with said pairs of inner links are linked together with pairs of outer links to form the chains characterised in that each said outer link is a single piece comprising a flat portion with parts of a pair of pins perpendicular to the flat portion, one of said part of a pin is provided with an extended portion and the other part of said pin is provided with a matching recessed portion, said pairs of outer links are fitted as a male-female joint from the two ends of said pair of bushes selecting one bush from a pair of bushes linked with one pair of inner links and the other bush from a pair of bushes linked with another pair of inner links.<br>

DE SCRIPTION	WITH	REFERENCE	TO	THE<br>
ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS :<br>
The chain according to the invention comprises plurality of bushes (6) and pairs of bushes are linked together with pairs of inner links (1, I7) at both ends of said pairs of bushes (6). One of the bush from said pairs of bushes (6) linked with pairs of inner links (1, V) is linked with a pair of outer links to an adjacent bush from a pair of bushes linked with an adjacent pair of inner links. By linking many pairs of bushes linked with pairs of inner links with many pairs of outer links the chain is formed- Each said outer link (2, 2*) is a single piece with a flat portion and part of a<br><br>
pin (3, 3') with an extended portion (49 49) and part of an adjacent pin (3, 3') with a matching recessed portion (5, 5')- The outer links (2, 2') are fitted as a male-female joint with the parts of pair of pins with extended portions (4, 4') fitting into the parts of pair of pins with recessed portions and forming a pair of pins (3, 3') through pairs of bushes, in which one of the bush is selected from pairs of bushes linked with inner links (1, 1) and the other bush is selected from another pair of bushes linked with another pair of inner links, to form the chain. Preferably on each said bushes (6) a freely rotating roller (7) is provided for reducing the friction in the chain during use. Each outer link (2, 2) are preferably provided with a pair of fatigue relieving gap (10, 10') one in each part of the pins (4, 47; 5, 5') close to the flat portion of the outer links (2, 2') to increase the fatigue life of the chain.<br>
At least one pair of outer links (2? 2?) may be preferably provided with threaded fixing bolts (8, 8') passing through a pair of bores in the pair of pins (3, 3) of each said outer links (2, 2'). Matching the threads in the bolts (8, 8') inner threads are provided in the bores of the matching parts of the pins (3, 3') in one of the outer links (2, 2') or one of the matching pin parts in<br><br>
each of said outer links (2, 2'). The pair of outer links with fixing bolts (8, 8') may be used for making an endless chain or for extending length of a chain as required. The threaded fixing bolts (8, 8;) may have case head so that the bolts do not protrude from the outer links (2, 2'). Exploded views showing clearly the assembly of the two embodiments of the outer links are shown in figures 7 and 8.<br>
Compared to conventional chains for similar purpose, the chain according to the invention has about 75% more tensile strength and 3 to 4 times more in fatigue life. In the conventional chain the outer link comprises a plate with press fitted pins through a pair of holes in the plate. In the chain according to the invention, the outer link has no holes and no riveted joint in the flat portion. This helps in reducing the width of the chain compared to a conventional chain for the same purpose. Since the outer links of the chain according to the invention do not have pin head extensions for riveting as in a conventional chain, it is possible to achieve transverse pitch as specified for multi-strand chains with the relevant standards without making separate multi strand chains with longer pins   which is the practice while using<br><br>
conventional   chains.      Obviously  the   chain   according  to   the invention is cost effective due to the abovementioned features.<br><br><br><br>
