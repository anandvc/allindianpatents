				<td>PIPERAZINE WITH OR-SUBSTITUTED PHENYL GROUP AND THEIR USE AS GLYT1 INHIBITORS<br>
The present invention relates to compounds of the general formula I<br><br><br><br><br>
l-[5-(aminosulfonyl)-2-methoxybenzoyl]-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-piperazineand<br>
1 - [ 5-(aminosulfonyl)-2-methoxybenzoyl] -4- [ 3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] -piperazine<br>
are specifically described in EP 0171636, possessing inhibiting activity towards carbonic<br>
anhydrase which plays a determining role in many physiological and pathological<br>
processes.<br>
The other excluded compounds are commercially available products.<br>
The present invention relates to compounds of general formula I, to pharmaceutical composition containing them and their use in the treatment of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. It has surprisingly been found that the compounds of general formula I are good inhibitors of the glycine transporter 1 (GlyT-1), and that they have a good selectivity to glycine transporter 2 (GlyT-2) inhibitors.<br>
Schizophrenia is a progressive and devastating neurological disease characterized by episodic positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, thought disorders and psychosis and persistent negative symptoms such as flattened affect, impaired attention and social withdrawal, and cognitive impairments (Lewis DA and Lieberman JA, Neuron,, 28:325-33, 2000). For decades research has focused on the “dopaminergic hyperactivity” hypothesis which has led to therapeutic interventions involving blockade of the dopaminergic system (Vandenberg RJ and Aubrey KR., Exp. Opin. Ther. Targetsy 5(4): 507-518, 2001i Nakazato A and Okuyama S, et al., Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents, 10(1): 75-98, 2000). This pharmacological approach poorly address negative and cognitive symptoms which are the best redictors of functional outcome (Sharma T., Br.J. Psychiatry, 174(suppl. 28): 44-51,1999).<br>
A complementary model of schizophrenia was proposed in the mid-1960, based upon the psychotomimetic action caused by the blockade of the glutamate system by compounds like phencyclidine (PCP) and related agents (ketamine) which are non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists. Interestingly in healthy volunteers, PCP-induced psychotomimetic action incorporates positive and negative symptoms as well as cognitive dysfunction, thus closely resembling schizophrenia in patients (Javitt DC et al., Biol. Psychiatry, 45: 668-679, 1999). Furthermore transgenic mice expressing reduced levels of the NMDAR1 subunit displays behavioral abnormalities similar to those observed in pharmacologically induced models of schizophrenia, supporting a model in which reduced NMDA receptor activity results in schizophrenia-like behavior (Mohn AR et al., Cell 98: 427-236, 1999j.<br>
Glutamate neurotransmission, in particular NMDA receptor activity, plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, such as the NMDA receptors appears to serve as a graded switch for gating the threshold of synaptic plasticity and memory formation (Wiley, NY; Bliss TV and Collingridge GL, Nature, 361:31-39, 1993).<br><br>
Transgenic mice overexpressing the NMDA NR2B subunit exhibit enhanced synaptic plasticity and superior ability in learning and memory (Tang JP et al., Natur, 401- 63-69, 1999).<br>
Thus, if a glutamate deficit is implicate in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, enhancing glutamate transmission, in particular via NMDA receptor activation, would be predicted to produce both anti-psychotic and cognitive enhancing effects.<br>
The amino acid glycine is known to have at least two important functions in the CNS. It acts as an inhibitory amino acid, binding to strychnine sensitive glycine receptors, and it also influences excitatory activity, acting as an essential co-agonist with glutamate for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function. While glutamate is released in an activity-dependent manner from synaptic terminals, glycine is apparently present at a more constant level and seems to modulate/control the receptor for its response to glutamate.<br>
One of the most effective ways to control synaptic concentrations of neurotransmitter is to influence their re-uptake at the synapses. Neurotransmitter transporters by removing neurotransmitters from the extracellular space, can control their extracellular lifetime and thereby modulate the magnitude of the synaptic transmission (Gainetdinov RR et al, Trends in Pharm. Sci., 23(8): 367-373, 2002).<br>
Glycine transporters, which form part of the sodium and chloride family of neurotransmitter transporters, play an important role in the termination of post-synaptic glycinergic actions and maintenance of low extracellular glycine concentration by re-uptake of glycine into presynaptic nerve terminals and surrounding fine glial processes.<br>
Two distinct glycine transporter genes have been cloned (GlyT-1 and GlyT-2) from mammalian brain, which give rise to two transporters with -50 % amino acid sequence homology. GlyT-1 presents four isoforms arising from alternative splicing and alternative promoter usage (la, lb, 1c and Id). Only two of these isoforms have been found in rodent brain (GlyT-la and GlyT-lb). GlyT-2 also presents some degree of heterogeneity. Two GlyT-2 isoforms (2a and 2b) have been identified in rodent brains. GlyT-1 is known to be located in CNS and in peripheral tissues, whereas GlyT-2 is specific to the CNS. GlyT-1 has a predominantly glial distribution and is found not only in areas corresponding to strychnine sensitive glycine receptors but also outside these areas, where it has been postulated to be involved in modulation of NMDA receptor function (Lopez-Corcuera B et al., Mol. Mem. Biol, 18:13-20, 2001). Thus, one strategy to enhance NMDA receptor activity is to elevate the glycine concentration in the local microenvironment of synaptic NMDA receptors by inhibition of GlyT-1 transporter (Bergereon R. et al., Proc. NatL Acad. Sci. USA, 95:15730-15734, 1998; Chen L. et al., /. Neurophysiol, 89(2): 691-703,2003).<br><br>
Glycine transporters inhibitors are suitable for the treatment of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. The majority of diseases states implicated are psychoses, schizophrenia (Armer RE and Miller DJ, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents, 11 (4): 563-572, 2001), psychotic mood disorders such as severe major depressive disorder, mood disorders associated with psychotic disorders such as acute mania or depression, associated with bipolar disorders and mood disorders, associated with schizophrenia, (Pralong ET et al., Prog. NeurobioL, 67:173-202, 2002), autistic disorders (Carlsson ML, /. Neural Trans,. 105: 525-535, 1998), cognitive disorders such as dementias, including age related dementia and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, memory disorders in a mammal, including a human, attention deficit disorders and pain (Armer RE and Miller DJ, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents, 11 (4): 563-572, 2001).<br>
Thus, increasing activation of NMDA receptors via GlyT-1 inhibition may lead to agents that treat psychosis, schizophrenia, dementia and other diseases in which cognitive processes are impaired, such as attention deficit disorders or Alzheimer’s disease.<br>

WO 2005/014563	PCT/EP2004/008633<br><br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically usable addition salts possess valuable pharmacological properties. Specifically, it has been found that the compounds of the present invention are good inhibitors of the glycine transporter I (GlyT-1).<br>
The compounds were investigated in accordance with the test given hereinafter.<br>
Solutions and materials<br>
DMEM complete medium: Nutrient mixture F-12 (Gibco Life-technologies), fetal bovine serum (FBS) 5 %, (Gibco life technologies), Penicillin/Streptomycin 1 % (Gibco life technologies), Hygromycin 0.6 mg/ml (Gibco life technologies), Glutamine 1 mM Gibco life technologies)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The compounds of formula I and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The administration can, however, also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula I can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose,corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acids or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like. Depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are however usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oil and the like. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations can, moreover, contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying<br><br>
the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
Medicaments containing a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a therapeutically inert carrier are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for their production, which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I and/or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical administration form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br>
The most preferred indications in accordance with the present invention are those, which include disorders of the central nervous system, for example the treatment or prevention of schizophrenia, cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, have to be adjusted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In the case of oral administration the dosage for adults can vary from about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg per day of a compound of general formula I or of the corresponding amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The daily dosage may be administered as single dose or in divided doses and, in addition, the upper limit can also be exceeded when this is found to be indicated.<br><br><br>
