METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR SINGLE ION DOPING AND MACHINING<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention concerns a method and system for single ion doping and<br>
machining by detecting the impact, penetration and stopping of single ions in a<br>
substrate.. Such detection is essential for the successful implantation of a<br>
counted number of 31P ions into a semi-conductor substrate for construction of<br>
a Kane quantum computer.<br>
An ion is an atom that has been ionised. We adopt the convention<br>
of using the term "ion" while the atcm is in motion, regardless of its ionised<br>
state. After the ion has come to rest, we call it an "atom".<br>
Background Art<br>
The Kane computer1 requires single donor 31P atoms to be placed in an<br>
ordered 1D or 2D array in crystalline silicon. The atoms must be separated<br>
from each other, by 20 nm or less. An alternative architecture is that of Vrijen<br>
et al.2 who propose an array of 31P atoms in a heterostructure where the atom<br>
spacing can be larger than the Kane computer but still of the order of 100 nm.<br>
Such precise positioning has proved extremely difficult using conventional<br>
lithographic and ion implantation techniques, or using focused deposition. This<br>
difficulty is not only with regard to forming arrays of donor atoms with sufficient<br>
precision, but also ensuring that only single donor atoms have been introduced<br>
into each cell of the array.<br>
Optical lithography has been utilised by semiconductor industries to<br>
manufacture integrated circuits with great precision. Optical lithography<br>
systems include an exposure tool, mask, resist and processing steps to<br>
accomplish pattern transfer from a mask, to a resist, and then to a device.<br>
However, the use of resist layers can limit resolution to the wavelength of the<br>
radiation used to transfer the pattern in the mask onto the resist. This is<br>
presently about 100 nm.<br>
Electron beam lithography, which uses a finely focused electron beam to<br>
directly write patterns into resists, can attain better than 20 nm resolution.<br>
Further, the "top-down-process", described in a recent patent application3, uses<br>
electron beam lithography to construct arrays of nanoscale channels in resists.<br>
The resist is then irradiated with an ion beam so that ions impact at random on<br>
the surface allowing a random array of channels to direct one or more atoms<br>
through into the substrate to construct nanoscale structures.<br>
However, in all of these lithographic techniques, control of the number of<br>
atoms reaching the substrate is not possible.<br>
Luthi et al.4 describe a resistless lithography technique which enables<br>
the fabrication of metallic wires with linewidths below 100 nm. The technique is<br>
based on an ultra-high resolution scanning shadow mask, called a nanostencil.<br>
A movable sample is exposed to a collimated atomic or molecular beam<br>
through one or more apertures in an atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilever<br>
arm. Standard V-shaped S13N4 cantilevers with integrated tips having a spring<br>
constant below 0.1 Nm-1 were used. The aperture diameter ranged from 50 to<br>
250nm depending on the desired mask structure. Scanning the sample with<br>
respect to the nanostencil allowed the structure to be laid down on the surface<br>
of the sample. After nanostructuring, the structure was inspected with the AFM<br>
tip.<br>
This former method allows precise positioning of large numbers of atoms<br>
but not implanting and detecting single ions.<br>
Shinada et al.5 have developed a single ion detection technique using a<br>
single ion implantation assembly developed by Koh et al.6 The single ion<br>
implantation assembly consisted of a pair of deflector plates, an objective slit, a<br>
precision quadropole-magnet, a target, an electron multiplier tube (EMT) and a<br>
chopper control circuit connected to the deflector plates and the EMT. The ion<br>
beam is chopped with the pair of deflector plates, over which the potential<br>
difference can be switched. Each single ion is extracted one by one from a<br>
continuous ion beam by adjusting the ion beam current, the objective slit<br>
diameter and the switching time of the potential difference applied to the<br>
deflector plates.<br>
The extracted single ion is then focused with the quadropole-magnet<br>
lens and impacts on the target. The number of incident ions is controlled by<br>
the EMT by detecting secondary electrons emitted upon ion incidence. Signals<br>
from the EMT are fed to the chopper control circuit which keeps on sending the<br>
beam chopping signals to the deflector until the desired number of single ions<br>
are detected.<br>
Shinada et al.5 emphasised findings by Koh6 by reporting that the key to<br>
controlling the incident ion number is the detection of secondary electrons<br>
emitted from a target upon ion incidence.<br>
The secondary electron detection efficiency Pd is defined as follows:<br><br>
where WSe is the average number of detected secondary electrons by a single<br>
chop and Next is the average number of extracted ions by a single chop, where<br>
Next is proportional to the ion beam current and the time of beam chopping.<br>
To determine the efficiency in the determination of secondary electrons,<br>
a 60 keV Si2+ ion beam was chopped with a frequency of 100 kHz. Nse was<br>
estimated by dividing the number of secondary electron counts per second by<br>
105. To evaluate Next, a standard fission track detector was used.<br>
The secondary electron detector included a photomultiplier tube with a<br>
scintillator and a light guide. A grid electrode was used to guide the secondary<br>
electrons to the sensitive part of the scintillator.<br>
The experimental result for Pd was 90%. The error was partially<br>
attributed to the limitations of the secondary electron detection system.<br>
Furthermore, results showed that the single ion incident position could be<br>
successfully controlled with an error of less than 300 nm.<br>
This detection of impacts from the pulse of secondary electrons emitted<br>
from the surface due to the ion impacts does not distinguish ion impacts with a<br>
mask from ion impacts with an exposed substrate under the mask.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
In first aspect the invention is a method for single ion doping and<br>
machining by detecting the impact, penetration and stopping of a single heavy<br>
ion in a substrate, the method comprising the steps of<br>
impacting electrically active substrate with single ions to generate<br>
electron-hole pairs;<br>
applying a potential applied across two electrodes on the surface of the<br>
substrate to create a field to separate and sweep out electron-hole pairs formed<br>
within the substrate; and<br>
detecting transient current in the electrodes and so determine the arrival<br>
of a single ion in the substrate.<br>
An advantage of the method is that it can be scaled to produce arrays of<br>
single atoms using low energy (keV) ion implantation. Also, ft is sensitive only<br>
to ions that reach the substrate and ignores ions that strike surface masks. It<br>
produces a record of each ion impact for verification and further analysis. The<br>
ions are detected with close to 100% efficiency. And, it can be used with MeV<br>
ions to exploit the latent damage from the passage of a single ion to<br>
nanomachine sensitive materials.<br>
The substrate may be a pure semiconductor substrate, such as a high<br>
resistivity silicon substrate. However any substrate may be used that is<br>
electrically active in the sense that it is ioniseable to form electron-hole pairs<br>
with a useful lifetime.<br>
Ions may be applied by the use of a focused beam of ions from a field<br>
ionisation ion source producing sub-20 nm ion beam probes. Alternatively, a<br>
broad-beam implanter can be used. The ion beam current may be adjusted to a<br>
level low enough to minimise the probability of multiple ion strikes during the<br>
time required to gate off the beam. The required current will depend on the<br>
response speed of the ion strike detection and beam gating circuitry. Typically<br>
the current will be one hundred atoms per second. Such a beam probe can be<br>
used to inject single ions at desired locations either with or without a mask.<br>
The required beam current can be tuned by using the single ion detector signal<br>
incident on a peripheral region of the substrate that is not itself required in the<br>
device to be fabricated.<br>
We will now describe the technique by which ions are detected using the<br>
invention. Implanted ions stop in the substrate at a depth determined by the<br>
initial ion energy and the stopping power of the substrate. There are two<br>
energy loss processes which determine the stopping power. First, nuctear<br>
processes where a close collision occurs between a projectile and the<br>
substrate nucleus causing a recoil and straggling. Second, electronic<br>
processes where ion kinetic energy is transferred to ionisation of the substrate<br>
and its attendant production of electron hole pairs. It should be appreciated<br>
that only the electronic processes produce a signal detectable by the method.<br>
The ionisation is detected by electrodes which may be placed adjacent to<br>
the region to be implanted. Both electrodes may be on the front surface, or one<br>
on the front surface and one on the rear surface depending on application. A<br>
bias voltage may be applied across them to detect the ion impacts. This leads<br>
to the possibility of measuring the polarity of the ion-impact-induced signal as a<br>
measure of the proximity of the ion strike to the positive or negative electrode.<br>
So, it may be possible to have two nanomachined apertures in the substrate<br>
that are implanted with a broad beam, then the aperture which actually receives<br>
the ion strike could be identified from the relative strength and polarity of the<br>
signal collected from the two electrodes.<br>
A substrate cooling system may be required to maintain the substrate at<br>
a low enough temperature (of the order of 77K) to allow sufficient signal to<br>
noise ratio to detect keV ions (for MeV ions the substrate may be held at room<br>
temperature).<br>
A prototype system has been shown to give very few false signals, such<br>
as random noise or from ions that do not penetrate sufficiently far into the<br>
substrate. Pulse shape discrimination can eliminate these events.<br>
Acceptable detection signals may be used to generate a gate signal, via<br>
a computer, to a feedback circuit which may then gate off the ion beam. Such<br>
a control signal may also step a mask to a new position above the substrate for<br>
a further implant whereupon the beam is gated on once again.<br>
The system may be enhanced by the use of a thin, ion sensitive resist,<br>
that may be processed to reveal the impact sites of single ions. The incident<br>
ions pass through the thin resist and enter the substrate leaving a trail of latent<br>
damage which can be developed by standard techniques to reveal a pit that<br>
can be imaged with an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). The resulting image<br>
of the pits reveals the sites where the implanted ions have entered the<br>
substrate.<br>
The system may also be enhanced by the use of a thick resist layer as a<br>
nanomachined mask, that blocks the ions from entering the substrate except<br>
for the open areas in the mask which expose the desired areas in the substrate<br>
where single ions are to be implanted.<br>
For the construction of a two atom device, two apertures may be opened<br>
in the mask. This may be achieved using some of the metal electrodes in the<br>
finished device. In this case, metal electrodes are fabricated using conventional<br>
Electron Beam Lithography (EBL), then a resist layer is deposited. A cross line<br>
is drawn with the EBL system across the linear electrodes which upon<br>
development then opens a path to the surface leaving the substrate exposed.<br>
The mask now consists of the thick metal electrode and the resist layer. Ions<br>
can be implanted down the paths beside the electrodes. Some ions will stop in<br>
the metal of the electrode, but this will not produce a signal in the ion detection<br>
system because ion impacts with metals produces very little charge.<br>
There will be an approximately 50 % chance of producing a device with<br>
a single ion in each aperture. This chance will be actually greater than 50%<br>
owing to lateral ion straggling. For example, the lateral straggling of 15 keV 31P<br>
ions implanted into silicon for the Kane quantum computer is about 7 nm7.<br>
There is a significant probability that the situation where both ions entered the<br>
substrate through the same aperture will result in the implanted atoms ending<br>
up in different locations. They may therefore be separately addressed with the<br>
A and J gate electrodes of the quantum computer. There is a significant<br>
probability that one or both of the ions will end up in the most desirable location<br>
under the A gate electrode itself due to ion straggling. In any case, appropriate<br>
tuning of the gate potential can still address the atom, even if it is not precisely<br>
located under the electrode. Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD)<br>
calculations show that as long as the two atoms are in different places, they<br>
can still be individually addressed.<br>
The system may be used to scale up the array of implanted ions by the<br>
use of a moveable mask consisting of a nanomachined aperture in an AFM<br>
cantilever which may be accurately positioned above the desired location of the<br>
atoms and then irradiated with an ion beam.<br>
The nanomachined apertures may be fabricated with EBL in the resist<br>
layer. Alternatively, the nanomachined aperture may be drilled in a standard<br>
cantilever and may form part of a Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) or an<br>
Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). The nanomachined aperture may be<br>
fabricated using a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) which itself usually employs a<br>
focused beam of Ga ions, diameter less than 20 nm, to image and machine the<br>
specimen. By first imaging the cantilever tip with the FIB, the location of the<br>
nanomachined aperture can be then accurately drilled at a known location<br>
relative to the cantilever tip.<br>
Accurate positioning of the nanomachined aperture above the specimen<br>
may be accomplished by using the STM or AFM to first locate and image<br>
registration marks on the substrate using the same cantilever containing the<br>
nanomachined aperture and to thus effectively align the aperture for an ion to<br>
pass through the aperture to implant an ion into the substrate.<br>
Between each implant step, the cantilever could be used to image the<br>
ion impact site to image chemical or morphological changes that occur as a<br>
result of ion impact to verify that a single ion has been successfully delivered to<br>
the substrate.<br>
The moveable mask may be controlled to a precision of less than about<br>
1 nm. The thickness of the moveable mask is sufficient to stop the incident ion<br>
beam so that no ions are transmitted except through the aperture.<br>
The system can also be used to produce scaled up arrays directly by<br>
using a FIB to implant the ions. The focused probe in the FIB is a sub-20 nm<br>
spot. In this case the focused probe is scanned over the substrate, dwelling on<br>
the places where the ions are to be implanted. The beam blanking and scan<br>
advance is gated on the ion impact signal. The FIB is configured to produce<br>
the ion beam required for the particular application by use of an appropriate<br>
eutectic alloy in the ion source. A combination of the nanomachined mask and<br>
the scanned FIB can be used if the FIB probe size is larger than the apertures<br>
in the mask. In this case the probe is scanned to dwell on the apertures in the<br>
mask.<br>
We will now describe a method of testing the detector. The method may<br>
also be used in a test mode where other ionising radiation, such as X-rays or<br>
electrons are applied to cause detectable ionisation. Such a test will confirm<br>
that the substrate is electrically active and that the system is working and is<br>
sufficiently efficient to detect ion impacts, before ion implantation.<br>
This may be done with a small radioactive source (or other appropriate<br>
source of X-rays) that is swung into place in front of the substrate to be<br>
implanted. The X-rays deposit the fixed amounts of energy, depending on the<br>
source, in the substrate without doing any damage, A pulse height spectrum<br>
then provides an indication of the quality of the device. The X-rays penetrate<br>
surface layers and can therefore be used even in devices that are completely<br>
covered with resist films.<br>
A tuneable energy electron source, or a source of different energy x-<br>
rays, could also be used to provide multiple energy particles for energy<br>
calibration of the pulse height spectrum.<br>
For all these methods, the ion-induced damage in the substrate must be<br>
annealed. After ion implantation a focused laser beam may be used to anneal<br>
the ion beam induced damage from the single ion impacts. We have shown<br>
this to work well with diamond8-9 where localised regions (less then 10 microns<br>
in diameter) can be annealed without significantly heating the rest of the<br>
specimen. An alternative strategy is to use rapid thermal annealing which<br>
heats the entire substrate, but this may cause damage to pre-existing<br>
structures<br>
In a second aspect the invention is a system for single ion doping and<br>
machining by detecting the impact, penetration and stopping of a single ion,<br>
such as 31P below 20 keV, in a substrate, comprising:<br>
an electrically active substrate where ion or electron impact generates<br>
electron-hole pairs;<br>
at least two electrodes applied to the substrate;<br>
a potential applied across the electrodes to create a field to separate<br>
and sweep out electron-hole pairs formed within the substrate; and<br>
a current transient sensor to detect current in the electrodes and so<br>
determine the arrival of a single ion in the substrate.<br>
In other applications the invention may be used to employ the passage<br>
of a single ion to nanomachine optical fibres or other materials with high<br>
precision. In this application the object to be machined is positioned on top of<br>
an active substrate (which can be a commercially available particle detector).<br>
Typically MeV ions would be used which have a range of the order of 100<br>
micrometres. The active substrate produces a signal which records the<br>
passage of single ions through the object to be machined allowing the ion<br>
beam to be stepped by one of the methods already described. After exposure<br>
in the desired locations, the latent damage produced by the passage of single<br>
ions can be developed to create the nanomachined structures.<br>
The invention may be used to control dopant implantation in integrated<br>
chip components in order, for example, to create a regular array of dopant<br>
atoms in the gates of transistors. Ordered arrays of dopants may give the<br>
device desirable electrical properties for the reduction of electron scattering.<br>

Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
This example describes the invention in the context of the construction of<br>
a Kane quantum computer which requires 31P ions with an energy below 20<br>
keV.<br>
Referring first to Fig. 1 system 10 is used for detecting the impact,<br>
penetration and stopping of a single heavy ion, such as 31P below 20 keV, in a<br>
substrate. The substrate 20 is a 0.2mm thick silicon wafer of greater than 1000<br>
Clem resistivity mounted on a metal contact and earthed. The entire substrate<br>
is electrically active silicon and the implantation of a 31P ion with generate<br>
electron-hole pairs. There is a layer of oxide 5 nm thick 21 and two electrodes<br>
22 and 23 on the surface of the substrate. A potential 24 is applied across the<br>
electrodes to create an electric field parallel with the surface to separate and<br>
sweep out electron-hole pairs formed within the substrate. A current transient<br>
sensor 30 is used to detect transient current in the electrodes and so determine<br>
the arrival of a single ion in the substrate.<br>
Since the device 10 has no metal layer or doped layer at the surface, the<br>
dead layer 21 thickness can be made much thinner than in devices constructed<br>
with a p-n junction or a Schottky structure.<br>
The results of the charge collection efficiency measured in the substrate<br>
20 improved by about 10% to at least 96% when the resistivity of the silicon<br>
substrate was increased from 1000 to around 5000-7000 Ocm when tested<br>
with MeV ion impacts. Hence, substrates made with a high resistivity silicon<br>
substrate of high resistivity are most suitable in the fabrication of arrays of<br>
single ions using the detection of electrical transients in the substrate from ion<br>
impact method. Further improvements in efficiency occur upon cooling the<br>
substrate and associated ion detection circuitry to low temperatures, and using<br>
Schottky barriers under the electrodes.<br>
When an ion penetrates the substrate it excites electrons out of their<br>
energy levels and consequentially leaves holes. These charge cariers are<br>
separated by an electric field applied to the electrodes. The negative charge<br>
carrier drifts towards the positive electrode and the positive charge carriers drift<br>
towards the negative electrode with a velocity which is dependent on for<br>
electric field strength. The resulting electrical transient is detected to generate<br>
the ion impact signal,<br>
If the high field region does not extend completely through the substrate,<br>
a dead region may exist between the electrodes corresponding to an area of<br>
low field. Any charge carriers which enter this dead region will have a velocity<br>
close to zero and will only drift a minimal distance and will hence recombine.<br>
Therefore the electrode configuration must be such that the dead region is as<br>
small as possible. The movement of the remaining charge carriers constitutes<br>
a small current which can be expressed in terms of a current transient.<br>
The detection of a current transient, indicates that a single atom has<br>
been implanted into the substrate at the desired location. The signal from the<br>
ion detection system is then used to deflect the ion beam thereby preventing<br>
penetration of further ions.<br>
Numerical simulations have been used to optimise the electrode<br>
positions to maximise this signal. For 31P ions with an energy up to a few 10"s<br>
of keV, only about 15 % of the residual kinetic energy deposited in the active<br>
layer below the oxide produces electron-hole pairs and hence a signal. The<br>
remainder, termed the pulse height defect, is lost to nuclear collisions.<br>
Cooling the high purity substrate to the temperature of liquid nitrogen,<br>
and appropriate thermal treatment of the detector electrodes to allow large bias<br>
voltages to be applied improve system performance.<br>
The current transient sensor 30 includes a detector preamplifier and<br>
amplifier system capable of pulse shape discrimination. Pulse shape<br>
discrimination may be accomplished by use of a digital storage oscilloscope<br>
which digitises the entire transient caused by ion impact, or noise signal.<br>
Transient shapes which do not conform to those expected for ion impacts can<br>
be rejected.<br>
The discimination can be performed by specialised electronics in the<br>
amplifier used to produce the charge transient signal. Spectroscopy amplifiers<br>
are available commercially with in-built pulse shape discrimination circuits<br>
(such as the ORTEC type 572) that produce a reject signal when pulse pile-up<br>
is detected. Pulse pile-up is when two ion signals arrive within a short time<br>
period resulting in one pulse with a distorted shape. Although pulse pile-up is<br>
not a problem for the strategy outlined here, similar circuits could be used to<br>
eliminate large, random noise pulse on the basis of their pulse shape.<br>
The electrical pulse height of any ion beam induced charge in the<br>
detector system is used to register a single ion implant event To prevent<br>
multiple implantation of ions at the same location in the substrate, a fast<br>
electrostatic deflector unit located upstream of the ion beam target chamber is<br>
utilised to deflect the incident ion beam after implantation of one ion is<br>
detected.<br>
The substrate and system are first tested by irradiating with X-rays from<br>
a radioactive source 40, for instance 55Fe or 57Co. The X-rays penetrate the<br>
substrate and cause ionisation in a reversible manner without causing any<br>
damage. Fig. 2 is a graph of the results. The major peak 50 is made up of a<br>
signal peak 51 at 5.989 keV, representing 55Mn Ka x-rays, the decay product<br>
from 55Fe, and a noise signal 52. There is also another minor peak centred at<br>
6.4 keV from Mn Ka x-rays. The peak 50 shows the X-rays have been<br>
detected.<br>
For 31P Ions with an energy up to a few 10"s of keV, only about 15 % of<br>
the residual kinetic energy deposited in the active layer below the oxide<br>
produces electron-hole pairs and hence a signal. Nevertheless, the noisy peak<br>
60 shown in Fig. 3 demonstrates the the system works, and the spectrum<br>
shows the detection of 17,000 ion impacts. The noise signal 61 level of 1 keV<br>
will be reduced to below 0.5 keV with future improvements to the shielding of<br>
the ion detection circuits. The commercially available electronics for this<br>
application is rated at 0.2 keV noise level which is suitable for the Kane device.<br>
Further work has taken place with a system in which the silicon<br>
substrate is covered with a 60 nm resist containing two nanomachined<br>
apertures irradiated with 15 keV 31P ions. This experiment has detected two<br>
single 31P Ions being implanted. The evidence for this is shown by the spectra<br>
shown in Fig. 4.<br>
In Fig. 4 the noise signal 71 is greater than before, about 3 keV, so the<br>
trigger level was set at just above 3.4 keV. The experiment involved testing the<br>
noise signals with the beam off to set the trigger level above expected noise<br>
counts, and then only irradiating for a short time to decrease the likelihood of<br>
counting noise. A first ion ion impact signal 80 was detected after 50 s, and<br>
another 81 after 68 s. These results were at 3.55 keV and 3.71 keV<br>
respectively and represent deeply implanted atoms that experienced greater<br>
electronic stopping and less nuclear stopping than the average. This result will<br>
be improved later by reduction of the noise level.<br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to a particular<br>
example it should be appreciated that many variations and refinements are<br>
possible. So too are many applications for the system and method.<br>
Other devices will have a different configuration; the 5 nm surface oxide<br>
described here may not necessarily be present and the beam energy and<br>
species may be different.<br>
The straggling caused by nuclear stopping process will introduce lateral<br>
and longitudinal tolerances in the 31P atom locations. Also, calculations by<br>
Koiller et al suggest that the exchange coupling between electrons in silicon<br>
matrix is a strong function of separation Compensation of these effects will<br>
require appropriate potentials to be applied to the gates associated with each<br>
qubit. These gates allow the environment of the qubit to be changed allowing<br>
individual qubits to be addressed by an NMR pulse or other signals. The<br>
fidelity of this operation will depend on the tolerance of the qubit location and<br>
the amount of cross talk between qubits from a particular gate field. The gate<br>
fields have been calculated by TCAD which also provides the potential for the<br>
solutions to the Schrodinger equation allowing the qubit wave functions to be<br>
calculated. A fidelity of better than 1 part in 104, required for operation of the<br>
device, can be achieved with potentials of less than 1 - 2 V per electrode which<br>
is less than the breakdown field of the oxide barrier.<br>
An ion energy of around 15 keV is necessary to ensure the ion range is<br>
at the required depth in the substrate which is about 20 nm for the Kane device.<br>
A prototype quantum computer element is presently under construction which<br>
consists of 2 donors, to be implanted through a mask containing two apertures.<br>
When two ion impacts are registered, there is a 50 % probability that each<br>
aperture contains 1 donor. Future devices will be fabricated using a focused<br>
31P beam stepped from cell to cell gated on an ion registration signal which<br>
provides the pathway to scaling up to many qubit devices.<br>
We are also developing a moveable nanomachined mask integrated with<br>
an AFM cantilever as another pathway to scaling up the device.<br>
The surface of the substrate may be patterned with registration marks to<br>
enable the region where the single atom array is to be located. The surface<br>
may then be scanned using an AFM in order to locate the registration marks on<br>
the surface. The known offset between the cantilever tip and a nano-machined<br>
aperture is then used to reposition the cantilever arm with the nano-machined<br>
aperture located above the desired location for implantation of the first atom.<br>
The coarse positioning system may be used to move the AFM stage into<br>
position beneath the ion beam collimator so that the ion beam can irradiate the<br>
back of the cantilever lever and illuminate the nano-machined aperture.<br>
Using an upstream Faraday cup, the beam current from the ion source is<br>
adjusted to a beam current of a few tens of pA. The beam is prevented from<br>
reaching the cantilever by switching on the deflector unit. Then the beam is<br>
directed to a non-essential comer of the substrate to tune the beam current to a<br>
few hundred atoms per second using the single ion detection system.<br>
Switching off the deflector unit allows the ion beam to irradiate the<br>
cantilever arm.<br>
The substrate is moved to the next location by moving the AFM stage 43.<br>
In some cases the AFM 32 can be used to image the location of the ion strike<br>
from the changes to the morphology of the surface caused by ion impact and<br>
hence verify the success of the ion implant. This will be the case with MeV<br>
heavy ions.<br>
To enhance performance charge induced in the substrate must be<br>
collected to high efficiency. The device must have a low density of free charge<br>
carriers and a low density of defects ie., the charge carriers trapping centres.<br>
Cooling of the substrate can be used to reduce free carriers and also noise<br>
from the process of thermal ionisation. Without free carriers a low leakage<br>
current may be sustained when a high electrical field is applied in the sensitive<br>
volume ensuring efficient charge separation. A low density of charge carrier<br>
trapping centres and a high charge carrier drifting velocity will reduce the loss<br>
to the trapping centres during the charge collection. Additionally, it is desirable<br>
that the substrate has a high breakdown electrical field, so that high velocities<br>
of the carriers can be obtained in biased devices.<br>
The pulse height in a device is often reduced or shows non-linear<br>
response to the ion energy due to three reasons:<br>
I.The proportion of the ions energy loss to nuclear stopping without<br>
involvement in the ionisation process leading to the e-h pairs production<br>
(the Pulse Height Defect - PHD);<br>
2. Charge loss at the trapping centres during charge drift or diffusion. This<br>
loss increases when the dense plasma produced by heavy ions shields<br>
the electrical field; and<br>
3. Energy loss at the dead layers. Dead layers must be kept as thin as<br>
possible when keV ions are employed.<br>
