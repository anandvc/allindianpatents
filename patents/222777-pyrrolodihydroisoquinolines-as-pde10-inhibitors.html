may also be mentioned as exemplary compounds according to this invention by means of the substituent meanings for R5, R6 and R7 in the following Tables Bl, B2, B3 and B4: Table Bl:<br><br><br><br><br>
The compounds according to the present invention can be prepared, for example, in an art-known manner, or in a manner described and shown as follows, or as disclosed in WO 02/48144, WO 03/014115, WO 03/014116, WO 03/014117 or WO 03/051877, or as described by way of example in the following examples, or analogously or similarly thereto.<br><br><br>
(I)<br>
As shown in the scheme above, in a first reaction step compounds of formula VIII, in which Rl, R2, R3, R4, R41, R5 and R51 have the meanings indicated above, are reacted with compounds of formula VII, in which R8 has the meanings indicated above and L is a suitable leaving group, for example chlorine or an acyloxy radical (e.g. the R8-CH2-C(0)-0- radical), to give in the presence of a suitable organic or inorganic base corresponding compounds of formula VI.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula VI are also accessible from compounds of formula VIII, in which Rl, R2, R3, R4, R41, R5 and R51 have the meanings indicated above, and compounds of formula VII, in which R8 has the meanings indicated above and L is hydroxyl, by reaction with amide bond linking reagents known to the person skilled in the art. Exemplary amide bond linking reagents known to the person skilled in the art which may be mentioned are, for example, the carbodiimides (e.g. dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or, preferably, l-ethyI-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride), azodicarboxylic acid derivatives (e.g. diethyl azodicarboxylate), uronium salts [e.g. 0-(benzotriazol-l-yl)-N,N,N",N"-tetramethyluronium terafluoroborate or 0-(benzotriazol-lyl)-N,N,N,N"-tetramthyl-uronium-hexafluorophosphate] and N,N"-carbonyldiimidazole. In the scope of this invention preferred amide bond linking reagents are uronium salts and, particularly, carbodiimides, preferably, l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride. Said reactions are carried out under conditions known to the person skilled in the art or as described exemplarily in the following examples.<br>
As shown in the next step, compounds of the formula IV, in which Rl, R2, R3, R4, R41, R5, R51 and R8 have the meanings indicated above, can be obtained by cyclocondensation of corresponding compounds of the formula VI. Said cyclocondensation reaction is carried out in a manner habitual per<br><br>
se to the person skilled in the art or as described by way of example in the following examples, according to Bischler-Napieralski (e.g. as described in J. Chem. Soc, 1956, 4280-4282) in the presence of a suitable condensing or dehydrating agent, such as, for example, polyphosphoric acid, phosphorus pentachloride, phosphorus pentoxide or phosphorus oxychloride, in a suitable inert solvent, e.g. in a chlorinated hydrocarbon such as chloroform, or in a cyclic hydrocarbon such as toluene or xylene, or another inert solvent such as acetonitrile, or without further solvent using an excess of condensing agent, at reduced temperature, or at room temperature, or at elevated temperature or at the boiling temperature of the solvent or condensing agent used. Compounds of formula IV are converted either with compounds of formulae II, in which R7 has the meanings given above, and III, in which R6 is l-6C-alkyl or l-4C-alkyl substituted by 1-4C-alkoxycarbonyl, or with compounds of formula V, in which R7 has the meanings given above and R6 is l-6C-alkyl or l-4C-alkyI substituted by l-4C-alkoxycarbonyl, optionally in a one pot synthesis and suitably in the presence of an inorganic or organic base (in particular a cyclic amine, e.g. piperidine) into the corresponding compounds of formula I.<br>
Said conversion can be carried out as known to the skilled person or as described in the following examples or analogously or similarly thereto.<br>
Compounds of formulae VIII, VII, III and II are commercially available or can be obtained in a manner known to the skilled person from his/her expert knowledge and/or from literature. Compounds of formula V are known or are accessible by reaction of compounds of formula II with compounds of formula III in the presence of a suitable organic or inorganic base in a manner customary per se to the skilled person.<br>
Compounds of formula I obtained can be converted into further compounds of formula I by methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art. More specifically, for example, from compounds of the formula I, in which<br>
a.) R8, R61, R71, R74 or R76 are an ester group, the corresponding acids can be obtained by acidic or, particularly, alkaline hydrolysis;<br>
b.) R8 is an ester group, the corresponding reduced forms thereof (e.g. the hydroxymethyl or methyl radicals) can be obtained by selective reduction reactions;<br>
c.) R8 is a hydroxymethyl group obtainable according b.), the corresponding ester or ether derivatives -CH2-O-R81 can be obtained by esterification or etherification reactions;<br>
d.) R8 is an ester or carboxyl group, the corresponding amides can be obtained by amidifcation reactions;<br>
e.) R6 is l-4C-aIkyl, particularly methyl, the corresponding halogenated, preferably chlorinated, groups can be obtained by halogenation reaction, particularly by reaction with a chlorination reagent such as sulfuryl chloride, thionyl chloride or N-chlorosuccinimide;<br>
f.) R6 is l-4C-alkyl substituted by halogen obtainable according e.), the corresponding derivatized   l-4C-alkyl   radicals   substituted   by   l-4C-alkoxy,   hydroxyl,   halogen   or  -<br><br>
N(R611)R612   can   be   obtained   by   nucleophilic   substitution   reactions   with   suitable<br>
nucleophiles; g.) R6 is l-4C-alkyl substituted by hydroxyl obtainable according f.), the corresponding<br>
derivatized l-4C-aIkyl radicals substituted by l-4C-alkoxycarbonyl can be obtained by<br>
oxidation and esterification reactions under suitable conditions; h.) R6 is methyl, the corresponding oxidized forms thereof (e.g. the hydroxymethyl or formyl<br>
radicals) can be obtained stepwise or directly by selective oxidation reactions (e.g. with the<br>
aid of manganese dioxide to obtain the formyl radicals); i.)   R6 is formyl obtainable according h.), the corresponding aminated compounds can be<br>
obtained by reductive amination reaction; j.)   R6 is hydroxymethyl obtainable according h.), the corresponding fluorine compounds can be<br>
obtained by fluorination reaction; k.)  R6 is methyl, the corresponding amino compounds can be obtained by nitration reaction and<br>
subsequential reduction of the nitro compounds obtained. The methods mentioned under a.) to k.) are expediently carried out analogously to the methods known to the person skilled in the art or as described by way of example in the following examples. It is moreover known to the person skilled in the art that if there are a number of reactive centers on a starting or intermediate compound it may be necessary to block one or more reactive centers temporarily by protective groups in order to allow a reaction to proceed specifically at the desired reaction center. A detailed description for the use of a large number of proven protective groups is found, for example, in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" by T. Greene and P. Wuts (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1999, 3rd Ed.) or in "Protecting Groups (Thieme Foundations Organic Chemistry Series N Group" by P. Kocienski (Thieme Medical Publishers, 2000). The isolation and purification of the substances according to the invention is carried out in a manner known per se, e.g. by distilling off the solvent in vacuo and recrystallizing the resulting residue from a suitable solvent or subjecting it to one of the customary purification methods, such as, for example, column chromatography on suitable support material.<br>
Salts are obtained by dissolving the free compound in a suitable solvent (e.g. a ketone, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or methyl isobutyl ketone, an ether, such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, such as methylene chloride or chloroform, or a low molecular weight aliphatic alcohol such as ethanol or isopropanol) which contains the desired acid or base, or to which the desired acid or base is then added. The salts are obtained by filtering, reprecipitating, precipitating with a nonsolvent for the addition salt or by evaporating the solvent. Salts obtained can be converted by alkalization or by acidification into the free compounds, which in turn can be converted into salts. In this way, pharmacologically intolerable salts can be converted into pharmacologically tolerable salts.<br>
The person skilled in the art knows on the basis of his/her knowledge and on the basis of those synthesis routes, which are shown and described within the description of this invention, how to find other possible synthesis routes for compounds of the formula I. All these other possible synthesis routes are also part of this invention. Having described the invention in detail, the scope of the present invention is not limited only to those described characteristics or embodiments. As will be apparent to persons skilled in the art,<br><br>
modifications, variations and adaptations to the described invention can be made on the base of the<br>
disclosure (e.g. the explicite, implicite or inherent disclosure) of the present invention without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of this invention.<br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the invention in greater detail without restricting it.<br>
Likewise, further compounds of the formula I, whose preparation is not explicitly described, can also<br>
be prepared in an analogous manner or in a manner familiar per se to the person skilled in the art<br>
using customary process techniques.<br>
In the examples, m.p. stands for melting point, h for hour(s), min for minutes, cone, for concentrated,<br>
satd. for saturated, MS for mass spectrum, M for molecular ion.<br>
Unless otherwise noted, if the exemplary compounds mentioned expressis verbis herein contain a<br>
chirality center, they are desribed illustratively as racemic mixtures herein, without restricting this<br>
invention thereto.<br>
The compounds mentioned in the examples as well as their salts and stereoisomers are a preferred<br>
subject of the invention.<br>

Intracellular levels of the second messengers cAMP and cGMP are regulated by both their rates of synthesis by cyclases and their hydrolysis by phosphodiesterases. Of the 11 phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoenzymes which are presently known, PDE10 was described for the first time in 1999 (Soderling SH, Bayuga SJ, Beavo JA. Isolation and characterization of a dual-substrate phosphodiesterase gene family: PDEIOA. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1999 Jun 8;96(12):7071-6; Fujishige K, Kotera J, Michibata H, Yuasa K, Takebayashi S, Okumura K, Omori K. Cloning and characterization of a novel human phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes both cAMP and cGMP (PDEIOA). J Biol Chem. 1999 Jun 25;274(26):18438-45; Loughney K, Snyder PB, Uher L, Rosman GJ, Ferguson K, Florio VA. Isolation and characterization of PDEIOA, a novel human 3", 5"-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase. Gene. 1999 Jun 24;234(1):109-17). The first gene of this new PDE subfamily was designated PDEIOA and the first splice variant was described as PDE10A1, according to the current nomenclature. Due to alternative splicing, other splice variants of PDEIOA exist and have been described in the subsequent years (Kotera J, Fujishige K, Yuasa K, Omori K. Characterization and phosphorylation of PDE10A2, a novel alternative splice variant of human phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes cAMP and cGMP. Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1999 Aug ll;261(3):551-7; Fujishige K, Kotera J, Omori K. Striatum- and testis-specific phosphodiesterase PDEIOA isolation and characterization of a rat PDEIOA. Eur J Biochem. 1999 Dec;266(3):1118-27; Fujishige K, Kotera J, Yuasa K, Omori K. The human phosphodiesterase PDEIOA gene genomic organization and evolutionary relatedness with other PDEs containing GAF domains. Eur J Biochem. 2000 Oct;267(19):5943-51). PDEIOA has been described as a cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase exhibiting properties of a cAMP PDE and a cAMP-inhibited cGMP PDE. Individual representatives of the PDE10 isoenzyme are characterized by being particularly prominently expressed in specific areas of the brain (striatum, putamen, caudate nucleus, cerebellum, thalamus), in testis, in the thyroid gland, in the pituitary gland, in kidney and in placenta.<br><br><br>
Increased expression levels in a broad variety of tumor cell lines and tissues, namely of the lung, breast, pancreas, brain, prostate and ovar indicates that PDE10 may play an important role in tumor cell growth and/or survival under conditions of elevated cAMP and/or cGMP generation. Increased expression levels and activities of PDE10A have been also found in testis suggesting that PDE10A may contribute to spermatogenesis (Fujishige K et al., Eur J Biochem. 1999, 266:1118-27). Certain PDE inhibitors, namely e.g. PDE3 or PDE11A inhibitors, are known to augment glucose-induced insulin secretion and thus may be useful for treating diabetes (see e.g. WO 03/077949). The compounds according to the invention have miscellaneous valuable pharmacological properties which make them commercially utilizable.<br>
Thus, for example, the compounds according to this invention are PDE inhibitors. Yet thus, for example, the compounds according to the invention are potent PDE10 inhibitors, some of which are apparently selective (by &gt;100 fold) among other PDE isoenzymes, whereby these selective compounds are particularly preferred in the context of the present invention. The compounds according to the invention therefore can be employed as therapeutic agents for the treatment or prophylaxis of diseases in human and veterinary medicine.<br>
Due to their potent and selective PDE10 inhibitory activity, the compounds according to the present invention may be, in a first facet of the present invention, of potential value in treating disorders of the central nervous system, in particular neurologic and psychiatric disorders, for example those mentioned in EP 1250923 and/or, in more particular, psychotic disorders, anxiety disorders, mood disorders or episodes, drug addiction, movement disorders or disorders comprising deficient cognition as a symptom (e.g. dementia, Parkinson"s disease or Alzheimer"s disease). Furthermore, the compounds according to the present invention may be, in a second facet of the present invention, of potential value in treating certain disorders of the central nervous system, in particular neurologic and psychiatric disorders, for example those mentioned generically, specifically or exemplarily in EP 1250923, US 2003/0008806 and/or US 2003/0018047, such as, for example, anxiety or psychotic disorders, movement disorders, obsessive/compulsive disorders, drug addictions, cognition deficiency disorders, mood disorders or mood episodes, or neurodegenerative disorders.<br>
In this context, examples of anxiety disorders, which may be treated by the compounds according to the present invention, include, without being limited thereto, panic disorder, agoraphobia, a specific phobia, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, or generalized anxiety disorder.<br>
Examples of psychotic disorders, which may be treated by the compounds according to the present invention, include, without being limited thereto, schizophrenia (for example of the paranoid, disorganized, catatonic, undifferentiated, or residual type), schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder (for example of the delusional type or the depressive type), delusional disorder,  substance-induced  psychotic  disorder   (for  example  psychosis  induced  by  alcohol,<br><br>
amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, or phencyclidine), personality<br>
disorder of the paranoid type, or personality disorder of the schizoid type.<br>
Examples of movement disorders, which may be treated by the compounds according to the present<br>
invention, include, without being limited thereto, Parkinson"s disease, or restless leg syndrome.<br>
Examples of obsessive/ compulsive disorders, which may be treated by the compounds according to<br>
the present invention, include, without being limited thereto, Tourette"s syndrome, or other tic<br>
disorders.<br>
Examples of drug addictions, which may be treated by the compounds according to the present<br>
invention, include, without being limited thereto, an alcohol, amphetamine, cocaine, or opiate<br>
addiction.<br>
Examples of cognition deficiency disorders, which may be treated by the compounds according to the<br>
present invention, include, without being limited thereto, Alzheimer"s disease, multi-infarct dementia,<br>
alcoholic dementia or other drug-related dementia, dementia associated with intracranial tumors or<br>
cerebral trauma, dementia associated with Huntington"s disease or Parkinson"s disease, or AIDS-<br>
related dementia, delirium, amnestic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, mental retardation, a<br>
learning disorder, for example reading disorder, mathematics disorder, or a disorder of written<br>
expression, attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder, or age-related cognitive decline.<br>
Examples of mood disorders or mood episodes, which may be treated by the compounds according to<br>
the present invention, include, without being limited thereto, a major depressive episode of the mild,<br>
moderate or severe type, a manic or mixed mood episode, a hypomanic mood episode, a depressive<br>
episode with a typical features, a depressive episode with melancholic features, a depressive episode<br>
with catatonic features, a mood episode with postpartum onset, post-stroke depression, major<br>
depressive  disorder,  dysthymic  disorder,  minor depressive  disorder,  premenstrual dysphoric<br>
disorder,  post-psychotic  depressive  disorder  of  schizophrenia,   a  major  depressive  disorder<br>
superimposed on a psychotic disorder such as delusional disorder or schizophrenia, a bipolar<br>
disorder (for example bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder), or cyclothymic disorder.<br>
Examples of neurodegenerative disorders, which may be treated by the compounds according to the<br>
present invention, include, without being limited thereto, Parkinson"s disease, Huntington"s disease,<br>
dementia (for example Alzheimer"s disease, multi-infarct dementia, AIDS-related dementia, or Fronto<br>
temperal   Dementia),   neurodegeneration   associated   with   cerebral   trauma,   neurodegeneration<br>
associated with stroke, neurodegeneration associated with cerebral infarct, hypoglycemia-induced<br>
neurodegeneration,   neurodegeneration   associated   with   epileptic   seizure,   neurodegeneration<br>
associated with neurotoxin poisoning, or multi-system atrophy.<br>
Yet in this context, the compounds according to the present invention may be of potential value for<br>
treating diseases or conditions, in which abnormal function of the basal ganglia has been implicated.<br>
Thus, abnormal function of the basal ganglia may be involved in disregulated motoric, appetitive<br>
and/or cognitive processes. Exemplary neuropsychiatric conditions, in which abnormal function of<br>
the basal ganglia has been implicated, are mentioned e.g. in EP 1250923, US 2003/0008806 and/or US<br><br><br>
2003/0018047, such as e.g. psychosis, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and related attentional disorders, depression, obsessive conpulsive disorders including Tourette"s syndrome and other tic disorders, and substance abuse. Several neurological disorders including Parkinson"s disease, restless leg syndrom and Huntington"s disease can be also linked to basal ganglia dysfunction.<br>
Still yet in this context, the compounds according to the present invention may be of potential value for improving cognition, powers of concentration, learning skills or hypermesia, in particular if the disorder is a symptom of dementia.<br>
Yet furthermore, the compounds according to the present invention may be, in a third facet of the present invention, of potential value for regulating fertility, e.g. via reducing spermatogenesis and/or via reducing sperm motility.<br>
Still yet furthermore, the compounds according to the present invention may be, in a fourth facet of the present invention, of potential value for treating diabetes, such as, for example, typ II diabetes, e.g. via augmenting glucose-induced insulin secretion.<br>
A special interest in the compounds according to the present invention lies in their use in therapy of schizophrenia.<br>
Another special interest in the compounds according to the present invention lies in their use in the therapy of psychotic disorders.<br>
Another special interest in the compounds according to the present invention lies in their use in the therapy of drug addictions.<br>

The pharmaceutical compositions according to this invention are produced using methods with which the skilled person is familiar. When employed in pharmaceutical compositions, the compounds according to the invention (= active compounds) are either used as such or, preferably, in<br><br><br>
combination with suitable pharmaceutical auxiliaries or formulating agents, for example in the form<br>
of tablets, coated (e.g. sugar-coated) tablets, capsules, caplets, suppositories, patches (e.g. as TTS),<br>
plasters,   emulsions,   suspensions,   gels   or   solutions,   with   the   content   of   active   compound<br>

pastes, gels and solutions.<br>
The required dosage of the active compounds according to this invention can vary depending on the<br>
mode of administration, the particular condition to be treated and the effect desired. In general,<br>
satisfactory results are indicated to be obtained systemically at daily dosages of from about 0.01 to<br>
about 100 mg/kg body weight, conveniently administered, for example, in divided doses up to four<br>
times a day or in retard form.<br>
The optimal dose and manner of administration of the active compounds necessary in each case can<br>
easily be determined by any person skilled in the art on the basis of his/her expert knowledge.<br>
Depending upon the particular disease, to be treated or prevented, additional therapeutic active<br>
agents, which are normally administered to treat or prevent that disease, may optionally be<br>
coadministered separately, simultaneously, sequentially or chronologically staggered with the<br>
compounds according to this invention. As used herein, additional therapeutic agents that are<br>
normally administered to treat or prevent a particular disease are known as appropriate for the<br>
disease being treated.<br>
The person skilled in the art is aware on the base of his/her expert knowledge of the total daily<br>
dosage(s) of the additional therapeutic agent(s) coadministered. Said total daily dosage(s) can vary<br>

Biological investigations<br>
Methods to determine the activity and selectivity of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor are known to the<br>
person skilled in the art. In this connection it may be mentioned, for example, the methods described<br>
by Thompson et al. (Adv Cycl Nucl Res 10: 69-92,1979), Giembycz et al. (Br J Pharmacol 118:1945-<br>
1958,1996) and the phosphodiesterase scintillation proximity assay of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.<br>
Inhibiting the activity of PDE10A<br>
The PDE10A is cloned into pCR2.1-Topo (Invitrogen) via PCR from human whole brain cDNA using<br>
primers   OZ   353   (5"-   ACCATGTTGACAGATGAAAAAGTGAAGGC   -3")   and   OZ   317   (5"-<br>
TCAATCTTCAGATGCAGCTGCC -3"). The ORF encoding for the PDE10A is cut with EcoRV and<br>
BamHI and subcloned into Smal and Bgl II of the expression vector pBP9 (Clontech). The encoded<br>
protein represents the PDE10A1 (GenBank Acc.-# AB020593) truncated at its N-terminus at aa 14.<br>
The recombinant baculoviruses are prepared by means of homologous recombination in Sf9 insect<br>
cells. The expression plasmids are cotransfected with Bac-N-Blue (Invitrogen) or Baculo-Gold DNA<br>
(Pharmingen) using a standard protocol (Pharmingen). Wildtype virus-free recombinant virus<br>
supernatants are selected using plaque assay methods. After that, high-titre virus supernatants are<br>
prepared by amplifying 3 times. PDE10A1 is expressed in Sf21 cells by infecting 2x10* cells/ml with<br>
an MOI (multiplicity of infection) between 1 and 10 in serum-free SF900 medium (Life Technologies,<br>
Paisley, UK). Cells are cultured at 28CC, typically for 48 hours, after which they are pelleted for 5-10<br>
min at 1000 g and 4°C. In spinner flasks, cells are cultured at a rotational speed of 75 rpm. The SF21<br>
insect cells are resuspended, at a concentration of approx.  lxlO7 cells/ml, in ice-cold (4°C<br>
homogenization buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.2, containing the following additions: 140 mM NaCl, 3.8<br>
mM KC1, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM (J-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM benzamidine, 0.4 mM<br>
Pefabloc,  10 µM  leupeptin,  10  uM  pepstatin  A,  5  µM  trypsin  inhibitor)  and  disrupted by<br>
ultrasonication on ice. The homogenate is then centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 g (4 °C) and the<br>
supernatant is stored at - 80 °C until subsequent use (see below). The protein content is determined by<br>
the Bradford method (BioRad, Munich) using BSA as the standard.<br>
The PDE10A activity is inhibited by said compounds in a modified SPA (scintillation proximity assay)<br>
test, supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (see procedural instructions "Phosphodiesterase<br>
[3H]cAMP SPA enzyme assay, code TRKQ 7090"), carried out in 96-well microtitre plates (MTPs). The<br>
test volume was 100 µl and contained 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4), 0.1 mg of BSA (bovine serum<br>
albumin)/ml, 5 mM Mg2+, 0.5 uM cAMP (including about 50,000 cpm of [3H]cAMP), 1 ul of the<br>
respective substance dilution in DMSO and sufficient recombinant PDE10A1 (lOOOxg supernatant, see<br>
above) to ensure that 15-20% of cAMP was converted under said experimental conditions. After a<br>
preincubation of 5 min at 37°C, the reaction is started by adding a substrate (cAMP) and the assays<br>
are incubated for a further 15 min; after that, they are stopped by adding SPA beads (50 ul). In<br>
accordance with the manufacturer"s instructions, the SPA beads have previously been resuspended in<br>
water and diluted 1:3 (v/v) and added to IBMX (3 mM). After the beads have been sedimented<br>
(&gt;30min), the MTPs are analyzed in commercially available measuring appliances and the<br><br><br>
corresponding IC50 values of the compounds for the inhibition of PDEIOA activity are determined<br>
from concentration-effect curves by means of non-linear regression.<br>
Representative inhibitory values [inhibitory concentration as -loglCso (mol/1)] which are determined<br>
for the compounds according to the invention are shown in the following table 1, in which the<br>
numbers of the compounds correspond to the numbers of the examples.<br>
Particular interesting compounds according to this invention are those compounds mentioned in<br>
table 1 below. Table 1: Inhibition of PDEIOA activity<br><br>
