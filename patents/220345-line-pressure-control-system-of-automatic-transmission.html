				<td>LINE PRESSURE CONTROL SYSTEM OF AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(e)   Reid of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic pressure control system of an automatic transmission capable of adjusting line pressure of the hydraulic ^ system.<br>
(b)   Description of the Related Art<br>
Generally, a conventional automatic transmission for a vehicle includes a multi-stage gear shift mechanism connected tc a torque converter, and a plurality of friction elements actuated by hydraulic pressure for selecting a gear stage of the gear shift mechanism.<br>
In such hydraulic control systems, hydraulic pressure generated by a hydraulic pump is selectively supplied to each friction element by a plurality of control valves such that automatic shifting is realized in accordance with a driving state of the vehicle and engine throttle opening.<br>
The above hydraulic control system generally comprises a pressure regulating controller for controlling hydraulic pressure generated by the hydraulic pump, manual and automatic shift controllers for selecting a shift mode, a hydraulic pressure controller for controlling shift response and shift quality, a damper clutch controller for actuating a damper clutch of the torque converter, and a hydraulic pressure distributor for supplying an appropriate<br>
amount of hydraulic pressure to each of the friction elements.<br>
The hydraulic pressure distributor distributes a variable amount of pressure in accordance with an ON/OFF or duty operation of solenoid valves by a transmission control unit such that shift control is realized.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a conventional line pressure control system in such a hydraulic system.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, the hydraulic pressure generated by the hydraulic pump 200 is adjusted so as to have a predetermined level of line pressure, by a regulator valve 202. Partially, the regulated line pressure Is adjusted by a torque converter control valve 204 and then supplied to a damper clutch valve 206 under control of the damper clutch solenoid valve S1, and partially the pressure level of the line pressure is reduced so to be supplied to the damper clutch control valve 206 or to friction elements via hydraulic pressure control means and hydraulic pressure distribution means by driver's manipulation of a manual valve 210, that converts ports so as to direct the pressure to appropriate lines.<br>
The regulator valve 202 is controlled by pressure from the manual valve 210 via a forward pressure line 212 in ranges of N, D, 2, and L; by pressure via a pressure line 214 which is connected to the friction elements that operate in third and fourth speed of D range; and by reverse pressure via a reverse pressure line 216 connected to the main valve 210 in range R.<br>
In this conventional line pressure control system, however, since the pressure control is performed by pressure from the lines 212, 214. and 216 biasing the valve spool of the manual valve, and Ein elastic force of a spring 218, it is difficult to electrically and actively control the line pressure, resulting in mileage reduction of the vehicle.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made in an effort to solve the above problems.<br>
It is an object of the present Invention to provide a line pressure control system of an automatic transmission capable of maintaining optimal line pressure in a present running condition so as to improve gasoline mileage, and making a line pressure control range broader using a full line pressure control mechanism by adapting a line pressure control so end valve.<br>
To achieve the above object, the line pressure control system of an automatic transmission of the present invention comprises a hydraulic pump for generating hydraulic pressure, a regulator valve for adjusting the pressure from the hydraulic pump to a predetermined level, a torque converter control valve for adjusting a partial pressure from the regulator valve, a damper clutch valve receiving the adjusted pressure from the torque converter control valve for feeding the pressure to a damper clutch, a damper clutch solenoid valve for controlling the damper clutch valve, a reducing valve for reducing a partial pressure from the regulator valve and then suppying the reduced pressure to the damper clutch control valve, wherein the regulator valve comprises a valve body, a first and a second valve spool coaxially inserted into the valve body, a sleeve encapsulating the second valve spool, and a coil spring interposed between the first and the second valve spools.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, hydraulic pressure generated by a hydraulic pump 2 is adjusted so as to have a predetermined level of line pressure, by a regulator valve 4. Partially, the regulated line pressure is adjusted by a torque converter control valve 6 and then supplied to a damper clutch valve 8 under control of the damper clutch solenoid valve S1, and partially the line pressure is reduced by a reducing valve 10 so as to be supplied to the damper clutch control valve 8 or to friction elements via hydraulic pressure control means and<br>
hydride pressure means that convert port so as to direct the pressure to appropriate lines by driver's manipulation of a manual valve 12.<br>
The regulator valve 4 communicates with the reducing valve 10 through a pressure line under control of a line pressure control solenoid valve S2 interposed on the pressure line, and with the manual valve 12 through a reverse pressure line 14. The line pressure is controlled by the line pressure control solenoid valve S2 except for in reverse range.<br>
FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 respectively are a detailed view of the line pressure control system and an enlarged view of a regulator valve of the line pressure control system.<br>
The regulator valve 4 comprises a valve body, first and second valve spools 20 and 22 in the valve body, a sleeve 24 encapsulating the second valve spool 22, and a coil spring 26 interposed between the first valve spool 20 and the sleeve 24.<br>
The valve body of the regulator valve 4 to provided with a first port 30 for receiving pressure from the oil pump 2, a second port 32 for returning the pressure from the first port 30, a third port 34 for supplying the pressure to the torque converter control valve 6, a fourth port 36 communicated with the first port 30 and communicating with a downstream end portion of the third port 34, a fifth port 38 separated from an upstream end portion of the first port 30 so as to supply control pressure to the first valve spool 20, a sixth port 40 communicating with the reverse pressure line 14, and a seventh port 42 for receiving control pressure from the fine pressure control solenoid valve S2.<br>
The first valve spool 20 installed in the valve body is provided with a first land 50 formed at a right end portion of the first valve spool on which the pressure from the fifth port 38 is applied, a second land 52 formed close to the<br>
first land 50, a third land 54 interposed between the first and the second ports 30 and 32, and a fourth land 66 formed on a left Hide of the first valve spool for selectively communicating the first and the third ports 30 and 34.<br>
The second valve spool 22 arranged at a left side of the fourth land 56 of the first valve spool 20 is provided with first and second lands 60 and 62 formed with a predetermined distance, a projection 64 formed at a right end of the second valve spool 22 for contacting a projection 58 of the first valve spool 20.<br>
The second valve spool is provided with a vertical hole 66 vertically penetrating the second land 62 by passing an axial center of the second valve spool 22 and a horizontal hole 68 formed from the right end of the second valve spool 22 to the vertical hole 66 along an axis of the second valve spool 22.<br>
The sleeve 24 encapsulating the second valve spool 22 is provided with  first opening 70 formed between the first and the second lands 60 and 62 of the second valve spool 22 for communicating with the sixth port 40 of the valve body, and a second opening 72 formed to the left side of the second land 62 of the second valve spool 22 for communicating with the seventh port 42 of the valve body for applying control pressure to the second land 62 of the second valve spool 22.<br>
On the left side of the second valve spool 22, an adjust screw 74 is installed such that it is possible to adjust the elastic force of the coil spring 26 between the first and the second valve spools 20 and 22 by moving the sleeve 24 by screwing the adjust screw 74, basically determining the line pressure.<br>
That is, the pressure supplied from the first and the fifth ports 30 and 38<br>
and the elastic force of the coil spring 26 cooperate so as to move the first valve spool such that the line pressure Is determined by the amount of fluid returned through the second port 32.<br>
The pressure fed from the line pressure control solenoid valve S2 is applied on the second land 62 of the second valve spool 22 such that the second valve spool 22 moves to the right. Accordingly, the projection 64 of the second valve spool 22 contacts the projection 58 of the first valve spool 20 so as to push the first valve spool 22 to the right such that the line pressure adjustment is achieved.<br>
This line pressure control is defined by the size of the lands of the first and the second valve spools 20 and 22 whereon the pressure is applied and the pressure level supplied from the first, fifth, and seventh ports 30, 36, and 42. The size of the lands and the applied pressure have the following relationship:<br>
In forward driving range,<br>
A1 x Pd = Fs + A3 x Ps<br>
Pd = (A3/A1) x Ps+(Fs/AI)<br>
In reverse range,<br>
A1 x Pr = Fs + A3 x Ps + (A2 - A3) Pr<br>
(A1 - A2 + A3) x Pr = Fs + A3 X Ps<br>
Pr= {A3/(A1 -A2+A3)} x Ps + Fs / (Al - A2 +A3)<br>
In any of the above equations, the relationship can be expressed as PI = a x Ps x b ("a" and "b" are constants consisting of A1, A2, A3, and Fs).<br>
Wherein,<br>
Ps: S2 control pressure<br>
Ex: exhaust port<br>
Pr: reverse line pressure<br>
PC: torque converter control valve pressure<br>
P1: line pressure<br>
Psu: pump return pressure<br>
Pd: forward line pressure<br>
Fs: elastic force of coil spring<br>
A1: first land size of first valve<br>
A2: first land size of second valve<br>
A3: second land size of second valve.<br>
Accordingly, the line pressure can be controlled by adjusting the control pressure using the line pressure control solenoid valve S2.<br>
The sleeve 24 is used so as to utilize the valve body, especially when processing the valve body without changing the tooling of the valve spool 20, and to easily adapt to change of the reverse pressure to the forward pressure and vice versa.<br>
The vertical hole 66 and the horizontal hole 68 of the second valve spool 22 are formed so as to prevent the pressure level from being changed by pressure leakage between the control pressure of the line pressure control solenoid valve S2 and the reverse pressure such that unexpected pressure is exhaust.<br>
Even though an exhaust port can be directly arranged, the direct arrangement of the exhaust port requires addition of a land to the valve spool 22 such that the valve and the sleeve should be longer, resulting in layout<br>
limitations in designing the valve body.<br>
As described above, in the line pressure control system to the automatic transmission of the present invention, the pressure from the reducing valve to the regulator valve is controlled by the line pressure control solenoid valve such that the line pressure can be optimized in accordance with the present running condition, which improves gasoline mileage and broadens the control range during the gear shift operation.<br>
