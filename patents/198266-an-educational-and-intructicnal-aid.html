				<td>This invention relates to an educational and instructional aid to teach mathematics to children. The body of the educational aid could be in cylindrical or other form and the same could be a pencil box, a scale or even a cylindrical tiffin box, a container or a pen holder. Though hereinafter the invention will be described with reference to a pencil box in cylindrical shape, it can be understood that the same is applicable to all the other objects of various shapes mentioned hereinabove.<br>
It is an universally accepted fact that the present number line which is currently used in marking numbers, in a straight line, is primarily a line aimed at depicting the property of addition and substraction. The said principle is used in scale for measuring small straight lines and the same principle is also used in the manufacture of measuring tapes. The said number line is also used in Geometrical studies, which is a part of Mathematics.<br>
The current number line is not able to the following—<br>
a.	To be used as a mathematical programmer.<br>
b.	To be used as a Multiplication or divisible programmer in<br>
Maths.<br>
c.	It cannot record large numbers.<br><br>
d.' There is no creative feature factor in the use of number line or scales.<br>
e.	Nothing to discover in Maths field.<br>
f.	It fails to make the student learn the relationship of numbers<br>
Dther than addition and substraction.<br>
g.	The decimal number concept is not included in the number line,<br>
h. The present number line is preferred to that of the Roman<br>
number line system, which has no zero in it. Roman numbers were<br>
discarded in favour of decimal numbers only to reduce the length<br>
of the number program and to increase versatality of the numbers.<br>
While the numbers of Roman type are replaced, the number line has<br>
not been suitably replaced.<br>
The above mentioned disadvantages are the reasons for inventing a new number line. Helix is the Nature's number line. Mostly Nature has expressed itself in helical or spiral forms. Even a DMA structure of the cells is expressed in a helical form. What happens if the numbers are put in the helical form? When put in helical form, it becomes a mathematical program or algorithm.<br>
The following are the advantages of a new number lines<br>
1.	Represent the decimal numbers in a short and brief manner.<br>
2.	To include the zero concept and the place value system on the number line.<br><br>
3. To represent Multiplication and division property of the Hindu Number System, in a number line which is not a straight line, and the true character of the Hindu Number system represented on the tubular / cylindrical surface.<br>
This invention thus provides an educational and instructional aid which consists of a body either in cylindrical or other form, atleast one end of the body being kept open characterized in that the body of the aid is provided with the number line in the form of a coiled coil or super coil alongwith an indicator means which when placed on the number line will indicate various mathematical relationship between numbers.<br>
The number line is placed in a helical form in the increasing or decreasing order, in sub¬<br>
divisions of 1 to 10 or 1 to 9, or 1 to B	1 to 0 i.e. numbers of all different sub¬<br>
divisions. Various mathematical relationships can be created by changing the number of<br>
elements in a helix segment. The number line is either pasted or printed or engraved on the<br>
body of the educational aid.<br>
The numbers could also be in a negative to positive series i.e. -100 to +100 or it could also be in decimal form i.e. 1.1 to 10.1<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein:-<br>
Fig. 1 is typical example of the educational and instructional aid in the form of a pencil box;<br><br>
Fig.  2 is a one of the number line  in the increasing order  for<br>
example 1 to lOO, to be pasted or printed in the teaching  object<br>
in form of a table, wherein the prime numbers are highlighted.<br>
Fig. 3 is another number line in the reverse order.<br>
Fig.  4 is a third example wherein the number line is divided  in<br>
nine columns i.e., 1 to 9.<br>
Fig.  5  is a fourth example wherein the number line  is  in  the<br>
order form —ve to +ve integer.<br>
Fig. 6 is a fifth example wherein the number line is in the decimal form.<br>
Fig. 7 is a sixth example wherein the number lines is a four part prime number indicator.<br>
From Fig. 1, it can be observed that the numbers are indicated in a helical form. The numbers are in the increasing order and the indicator marked "C* is a string which can be wound around the pencil box. The indicator device can be another cylindrical attachment with windows provided to see the numbers. It can even be an electronic device wherein the numbers can be seen with liquid crystal displays.<br><br>
The following  are some of the number relations, a  child could arrive  at  when  playing  with  the  educational  aid  of   this<br><br><br><br>
In diagonals -from  left to right down you Mill get the difference of NINE ; so this converts as a table of number NINE through out.<br>
In  diagonal  from  left  to right  upwards,  you  Mill  get  the difference of eleven, which is the table for number eleven.<br>
The formulation for multiplication table can be worked out in the following manners<br>
Let  us work out the multiplication table for the number 23  i.e. the multiplicand is 23.<br><br><br>
23 x 3 = 69, this can be obtained by adding three consequtive numbers wherein the multiplicand i.e. 23 will be in the middle or ever three numbers appearing horizontally or cross-sectional ly.<br><br>
From the above example* it can be formulated that s<br>
1.	If  the  multiplier  is  an odd  number  i.e.  1,  3,  5,  7,<br>
9. ......«..,  that many consecutive numbers appearing  vertically<br>
or horizontally or cross-sectionally, with the multiplicand in the centre/middle, should be added. For example, if three is the multiplies, three consecutive numbers appearing either horizontally, vertically or cross—sectionally should be added, including  the multiplicand.<br>
2.	If the multiplier is an even number such as 2, 4, 6, 8,<br>
lO....., then leaving the multiplicand in the centre, the<br>
adjacent numbers equal to the multiplier should be added. In<br>
other words, if two is the multiplier and twenty-three is the<br>
multiplicand, then one each number appearing on either side of<br>
twenty three should be taken. In this case, the multiplicand<br>
should not be added.<br><br>
rom Fig 2. one can at a glance make out that the 'Prime Numbers* -e all odd numbers and that the number line containing the even ambers including the line which contains multiplies of five, Lth the exception of number five itself, do not have any prime imbers. This prime number identification can replace the age Id prime number seive of Eratosthenes. Similarly, various »lat ions of numbers could be worked out from the tables attained in Figs. 3 to 6. Fig. 7, which contains the four part ime number indicator, indicates the places in which the prime imbers could be found.<br>
te pencil box is an essential part of the educational kit of all :udents to hold, pencils, rubbers, pens, scale or other useful ems for use or storage and safe keeping.<br>
&gt;e pencil box with Number Program has two sides, imprinted on the surface with numbers.<br>
affixed or pasted or fixed in any form with a pre-written program on paper, plastic or any other medium, the number program is made water proof by transparent  casing or plastic coating to provide long life to the gadget.<br>
-9-<br><br>
The  following  are the  advantages of the  pencil  box  of  the invention.<br>
1.	First  and foremost is that it is an aid in the  teaching  of mathematics.<br>
2.	It is a mini calculator.<br>
3.	It is a part of a Math's Lab.<br>
4.	It can be used to test Maths ability in human beings.<br>
5.	As a gadget to promote the cause of Math's education.<br>
6.	As a number line for prime number seive.<br>
7.	To lay the basis for the concept of Decimal number system and others.<br>
8.	To display the Decimal fractions.<br>
9.	The gadget is useful for developing teaching aids in number theory.<br>
10.	It  can  be used in auto computation  system  and  also  in developing comples patterns, to analyse computations.<br>
11.	To teach logrithams and to develop coiled—coil structures of numbers, useful in Maths operations.<br>
12.	As a tool or aid to discover number relations with  attached guides.<br>
13.	As a gift article.<br>
The only limitation of the education aid of the present invention is that it fails to show the coild coil structure of number line.<br><br><br>
