				<td>This invention relates to A Composition For Baked Products And A Process Therefor.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The invention further relates to millet based particularly finger millet based composition for baked products such as cookies, and cakes. The composition is having enhanced nutritional value and shelf life. The composition is a good source of calcium imparts convenience in the form of ready mix. Sweet or salt cookies can be baked as and when required and sweet cookies will be more nutritious product for children and the aged as the millets are well known for its nutritional strengths that include minerals, vitamins particularly thiamine and dietary fibres. Further, the low glycemic index of millets gives added advantage for the suitability of the composition for people suffering from diabetes, which is prevalent in most parts of the world due to life style and eating habits. Additionally, millet has preferred regional requirement, easy guaranteed availability at reasonable price thereby making the product widely affordable and accessible. The products prepared from the composition of the present invention has excellent melt in the mouth, higher sensory attributes, enhanced organoleptic properties, increased shelf life, and added nutritional &amp; health value. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The prior art known to the inventor include Japanese Patent No.JP 2000184848. The invention intends to obtain wheat flour composition for cakes having excellent melt in the mouth. The patent teaches using durum wheat flour of specific particle size in specific quantities to achieve the desired property.<br>
Japaneses Patent No. JP 5168397 discloses a mix for low calorie cookies. The mix comprises (i) coarse particle size wheat flour containing 20 to 100wt.% having particle diameters of 100 to 300 mµ, (ii) fat or oil (usually butter shortening or margarine) in an amount of 13 to 20 wt.% based on component (i), (iii) sugar and (iv) swelling agent. The product is further mixed with thickening agent to maintain the texture and flavor of the products thus produced particularly when the contents of fat and oils are on lowerside.<br>
In accordance with the disclosure in WO03079814, a German patent application No. 2415861 (1975), teaches using soy mass to partly replace carbohydrates to prepare a dry<br>
mix for food products including cookies.<br>
The patent also cites a US patent No. 3,697,290 (1972), where baked leavened products contain non-elastic protein ( seasame or seasame and soya bean), elastic type vegetable protein (wheat gluten in isolation or in combination with edible gums) and flavoring texturing agents including vegetables.<br>
Wheat based cookies are a common product of trade and at the cottage scale, small quantities of millet based cookies are also seen. The limitation is the blackish brown colour of the product because of brown variety of millet. There are reports on the storage/shelf-life of millet based biscuits (Selvaraj etal, 2002). The limitation is that the baked product storage life is established and not the shelf life of a mix. Yet another disadvantage is that the colour of biscuits is dark brown, which reduces the acceptance of the product. The process for producing bakery products using wheat germ and maize flours has been patented by Mueller (DE4331833, 1995). The limitation is that it is a general process in which wheat germ and maize are incorporated. Yet another disadvantage is that because of wheat germ addition, the expected shelf life of the product may be reduced. Vaidehi et.al have reported biscuits with ragi flour and oil seed flour blends in the ratio of 70 : 30 with control biscuits made of maida alone. The acceptability of the biscuits was less than fair irrespective white or brown ragi flour is used. The peanut flour blends with ragi flour biscuits, appears to have better scores of fair as compared to control biscuits of maida. The limitation of the process is not having a binding agent to give the feel and texture of biscuits. Yet another limitation is the fresh biscuits were evaluated and lacks the storage data and hence shelf-life is questionable because of oil seed flours. Besides, some recipes are available on websites where maida is used as a major ingredient for preparation of biscuits and ragi flour contributes to about 10%. The limitations of these are lack of scientific criteria, and nutritionally not so much improved. Yet another limitation is the process is only biscuit preparation, thereby fails to provide information on storage life. The present invention intends to provide convenience composition for baked products such as cookie mix, which can be used for baking of hot cookies as and when required. Secondly, the main thrust is on high content of ragi flour to supply reasonal quantity of calcium, iron and vitamins.    Maida and<br>
custard powder are used for better binding properties. The cookie mix impart convenience with high nutritional values, increased sensory characteristicas, improved organoleptic values, and a better shelf life of 10 months in trilaminate pouches.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a composition for baked products<br>
and a process therefor.<br>
Other object is to provide a millet based particularly finger millet based composition for baked products such as cookies, and cakes.<br>
Another object is to provide a composition having enhanced nutritional value and shelf life.<br>
Yet other object is to provide a composition with a good source of calcium, iron vitamins, and fibres imparting convenience in the form of ready mix.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a composition for preparing Sweet or salt cookies as and when required and sweet cookies will be more nutritious product for children and the aged as the millets are well known for its nutritional strengths that include minerals, vitamins particularly thiamine and dietary fibres.<br>
Further, the low glycemic index of millets gives added advantage for the suitability of the composition for people suffering from diabetes, which is prevalent in most parts of the world due to life style and eating habits.<br>
Additionally, millet has preferred regional requirement, easy guaranteed availability at reasonable price thereby making the product widely affordable and accessible.<br>
The products prepared from the composition of the present invention has excellent melt in the mouth, higher sensory attributes, enhanced organoleptic properties, increased shelf<br>
life, and added nutritional &amp; health value.<br>
In accordance with the other aspect of this invention is to provide a process for preparing desired baked products.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a composition for baked products comprising<br>
(i)	28 to 32 wt.% millet flour,<br>
(ii)	10 to 19 wt.% source of protein (flour),<br>
(iii)	7 to 23 wt.% binding agent,<br>
(iv)	20 to 24 wt.% fat,<br>
(v)	0.1 to 0.2wt% leavening agent,<br>
(vi)	sweetener or salt depending on the product intended to prepare and<br>
(vii)	one or more flavoring agents ~ as per taste<br>
One of the embodiments of the present invention is to provide a composition/ ready mix/instant mix wherein the the baked products are cookies, biscuits, and/or cakes preferably cookies sweet or salt particularly sweet. A composition for the baked products are millet based preferably finger millet based. Further, millet flour used may be finger millet (Eleucina coracana), particularly, white variety - Indaf-11, cleaned and ground to pass through a 18 mesh sieve.<br>
Other embodiment of the present invention is to provide a composition/instant mix wherein the source of protein may be defatted soy flour, and milk powder and are added in an amount ranging from 14 to 15 wt.%. The contents of protein may ranges from 4 to 7.6wt.%, preferably 5.5 to 6wt.%.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is to provide a composition/instant mix wherein the binding agent employed may be custard powder, maida and in an amount in the range of 18 to 22wt.%.<br>
Yet other embodiment of the present invention is to provide a composition/instant mix wherein the leavening agent such as baking powder or sodium bicarbonate may be added.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the present invention wherein sweetner used may preferably be icing sugar and added up to 21wt%.<br>
The fat used may be such as butter, marvo etc. and the contents of fat added may br<br>
21wt.%<br>
In accordance with one aspect of this invention there is provided a process for preparing the composition as claimed herein above comprising blending all the ingredients to get a homogeneous blend and packing desired quantity in a suitable package. Trilaminated pouches may preferably be used for packing the composition. In accordance with other aspect of this invention there is provided a process for preparing baked products which comprises preparing a dough, mould the dough and baked in a conventional manner. The baking may preferably be performed at I8O0C for 25 ± 5 minutes.<br>
As can be seen from the disclosure made herein above, the essential ingredients of bakery goods are- flour, shortening, eggs, water/ milk, leavening agents, and sugar. Truly speaking, the quantity and quality of these ingredients determines the structural and sensory attributes of the baked item- whether it is a cake, cookie, or bread. All baked goods require sugar for flavor, color, tenderness, and uniformity of grain, gluten development, moisture retention, improved shelf life.<br>
During the mixing process, sugar acts as a tenderizing agent by absorbing water and slowing gluten development. Sugar competes with these gluten-forming proteins for water in the batter and prevents full hydration of the proteins during mixing. If too much gluten develops, the dough or batter becomes rigid and tough. Thus, by retarding the gluten development, sugar renders the final baked product, a tender crumb texture and a good volume. Sugar also helps in regulating the leavening process.<br>
Not only this, sugar acts as a whipping-aid and props up lightness by incorporating air into the shortening during the creaming process. Air is trapped on the face of sugar's irregular crystals. Thus, sugar helps produce fine crumb texture and good volume during mixing and baking.<br>
Sugar also acts as a stabilizer since it interacts with proteins to stabilize the whipped foam structure. Interestingly, sugar accounts for the delayed coagulation of proteins during baking. During heating while baking, proteins tend to coagulate i.e. start forming bonds among each other. The sugar molecules raise the temperature at which bonds form between these proteins by surrounding the proteins and interfering with bond formations. Icing sugar due to its finest granulation and enhanced surface area catches more air and moisture. This helps in melting, blending, and dissolving smoothly &amp; instantly thereby improving sensory attributes.<br>
PROCESSING OF MIX<br>
The quantities of finger millet flour (28.86-31.15g wt.%), milk powder (7.21-3.1g wt. %), defatted soy flour (7.21-12.46g wt. %) custard powder (7.21-6.22g wt. %) and baking powder (0.14-0.15g wt. %) were varied. While maida, icing sugar, fat and cardamom were kept at fixed levels. Twenty-five combinations were formulated. Each combination was mixed well and kneeded well and formed into round small discs (10 g) using mould and baked in an oven at about 1800C for 20 minutes. All the combinations of mixes were baked in a similar way to get cookies. These samples were subjected to evaluation by a team of 15 taste panelists for texture, taste, colour, and over all acceptability. Texture hardness of all these samples was also studied by using textur o-graph. The texture hardness of the cookies was in the range of 340-675 B.U and acceptability score ranged from 7.9 to 8.4 on 9-point hedonic scale. The cookies had 112 mg% calcium and 4.2 mg% iron with a dietary fibre level of about 10-12%. The cookies were crisp and very much liked.<br>
Working Example-1<br>
Finger millet flour (120 g), maida (80 g), icing sugar (60 g), cardamom (0.5 g), milk powder (5 g), baking powder (0.2 g), custard powder (5 g), defatted soybean flour (5<br>
g) were weighed. Mixed all the ingredients thoroughly, added fat / marvo (50 g), kneeded well for homogeneity and formed into a small discs using mould and baked in an oven at about 180°C. The cookies were accepted well with a score of 8.4 and texture hardness of 475 B.U.<br>
Working Example-2<br>
Finger millet flour (100 g), maida (100 g), icing sugar (50 g), cardamom (1.0 g), milk powder (10 g), defatted soybean flour (20 g) and custard powder (vanilla flavor) (10 g) were weighed. Mixed all the ingredients thoroughly, added fat / marvo (50 g), kneeded well and formed into a small discs using mould and baked in an oven at about 180°C. The cookies were accepted recording a score of 8.3 with a texture hardness of 450 B.U.<br>
Twenty five formulations were run and cookies were prepared by baking for 20 minutes at about 180°C. The product with excellent score eating with reference to the sensory parameters was selected as the optimum one and the texture was also highly acceptable. The optimized composition of sweet cookies mix is as follows:<br>
