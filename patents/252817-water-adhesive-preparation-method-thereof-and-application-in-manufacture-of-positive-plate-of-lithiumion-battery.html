WATER ADHESIVE, PREPARATION METHOD THEREOF AND APPLICATION IN MANUFACTURE OF POSITIVE PLATE OF LITHIUMION BATTERY;<br>
SHENZHEN BAK BATTERY CO., LTD, A<br>
CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING<br>
UNDER THE LAWS OF CHINA, WHOSE<br>
ADDRESS IS BAK INDUSTRIAL PARK,<br>
KUICONG,	LONGGANG	DISTRICT,<br>
SHENZHEN, GUANGDONG 518119, CHINA.<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY	DESCRIBES	THE<br>
INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED. 1<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the materials chemistry field and the high-energy battery technology, and particularly to a water adhesive, a preparation method thereof and application in manufacture of a positive plate of a lithium ion battery.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A lithium ion battery is a high-performance secondary battery. It has such advantages as high working voltage, high volume and weight energy density, long service life, low self-discharge rate, no memory effect, and environment friendliness, and is widely applied in the fields of mobile communication devices, notebook computers, video recorders, personal digital assistants (PDAs), digital cameras, electric tools, torpedos, missiles, etc. In recent years, the manufacturing technology of the lithium ion battery has progressed considerably, such that the capacity of a cylindrical battery, Model 18650, for example, is increased from the original 1200 mAh to the present 2400 mAh. However, as for the manufacturing method of battery plates (positive plate and negative plate), the coating process is still used. The coating method is classified into oil-phase coating process and water-phase coating process. In the oil-phase coating process, positive and negative electrode active powders and a conductive agent are made into slurry with an organic solvent and an adhesive soluble in the organic solvent. In the water-phase coating process, positive and negative electrode active powders and a conductive agent are made into slurry with water as the solvent and an adhesive soluble in water.<br>
2<br><br>
The water-phase coating technology has been adopted in the current mass production of negative plates, for example, with water as the solvent and sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) latex as the adhesive. However, the oil-phase coating technology is generally used in the mass production of positive plates. The adhesive most used currently is a fluoropolymer adhesive, for example, using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and N-methylpyrrolidone solutions as the adhesive. With a fluoroolefin polymer as the adhesive of the positive electrode material of the lithium ion battery, the vaporized solvent produced in the manufacturing process will not only pollute environment, but also endanger operators' health. Moreover, the fluoropolymer solvent is expensive, which will undoubtedly increase the production cost of lithium ion battery.<br>
In order to resolve the problems, R&amp;D work has also been done on the water adhesive of the positive electrode material of the lithium ion battery. R. Dominko et al. proposed a manufacturing method of the positive plate using a water adhesive (R. Dominko et al., Electrochemical and Solid-state Letters, 4(11)A187-A190 (2001)), which is as below: First, treat the particles of positive electrode material to be applied with a polyelectrolyte such as gelatin; then add a highly conductive carbon black (Printen XE2, Degussa), so that each particle of the positive electrode material is deposited on the surface with a layer of carbon black particles of 0.1 urn in particle size; and finally make the particles of positive electrode material treated with gelatin and carbon black adhere to a current-collecting aluminum foil with an additional polyelectrolyte (gelatin, cellulose, etc.) to get an electrode plate. However, the following disadvantages exist in the manufacturing process of positive plates with the common mass production equipments according to the method proposed by R. Dominko et al.: (1) Adhesion between the positive electrode material and the aluminum foil is<br>
3<br><br>
poor, which results in serious falling of materials, especially in a single-side coating process. (2) The aluminum foil adhered with the positive electrode slurry turns out to be hard with gelatin as the adhesive, and less flexible than that with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as the adhesive. (3) Due to too low the molecular weight of gelatin, the positive plate with a qualified surface density cannot be obtained merely with gelatin as the adhesive, that is, the positive plate with a sufficient thickness cannot be obtained. A water adhesive was disclosed in the Chinese patent CN 01108511 and CN 01108524, whose preparation method is as below: With a hydrophilic monomer and a lipophilic monomer denoted by the general formula of CH2=CRiR2 as the starting monomer, mix one, two or more kinds of hydrophilic monomers and one, two or more kinds of lipophilic monomers, and add an emulsifier and other assistants; with a redox system as the initiating system composed of a water-soluble initiator such as ammonium persulfate, Na2S03, FeS04, etc., react at 30-80 °C for 3-24 hours to produce the water adhesive. This preparation method, with a relatively higher production cost and a more tedious preparation process, has no use value to industrial production.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention provides a water adhesive containing gelatin, a water-soluble polymer and water, which can be applied in manufacture of a positive plate of a lithium ion battery. In this application, gelatin can make the conductive carbon black uniformly adhere to the surface of the positive electrode active material, thus increasing conductivity of the positive electrode active material. If the content of gelatin is too low ( 5%), the coated positive plate may be excessively high in hardness, and the aliquation phenomenon is likely to occur. The water-soluble polymer can increase viscosity of the adhesive, increase the adhesion between the positive electrode slurry and the current collector, and improve coating performance of the positive electrode slurry. If the content of the water-soluble polymer is too low ( 2%), the adhesive viscosity may be too high, which is also to the disadvantage of application of the positive electrode slurry, and will<br>
7<br><br>
result in a high internal resistance of the battery provided with the positive plate. Besides, as for the selection of water-soluble polymers, it is feasible to use a water-soluble polymer having a high molecular weight and that having a low molecular weight together, and control the average molecular weight around 200,000-300,000, so as to achieve better effects. Water is used to dissolve gelatin and the water-soluble polymers. If the water is far from sufficient, gelatin and the water-soluble polymers cannot be completely dissolved; and if the water is too much, the slurry made with the adhesive will be too thin, which is unfavorable for the coating process.<br>
The adhesive can be prepared by the following method:<br>
(a)	Dissolve the scaled gelatin in water.<br>
(b)	Titrate the above solution with an alkaline solution to make its pH value being 7-9.<br>
(c)	Then add the scaled water-soluble polymer to the solution.<br>
(d)	Stir the solution to completely dissolve the ingredients.<br>
The reason for adjusting the pH value to 7-9 during preparation of the adhesive is as below: Gelatin is mainly composed of amino acid molecules, which are an amphoteric compound and between which strong hydrogen bonds can be formed under this environment, which will enhance the adhesion, make the conductive agent adhere to the surface of the positive electrode active material more uniformly during the slurry preparation process, and enhance the conductivity. An excessive high (&gt; 9) or an excessive low (

(1) Manufacture of positive plate<br>
Apply the slurry prepared above to a coater of 4 meters in length. The temperatures of the three baking channels in the front, middle and rear of the coater are set at 100°C, 95°C and 100°C, respectively. The current-collecting aluminum foil is 20 urn in thickness and 280 mm in width.

The foil, after being dried, turns out to be the positive plate.<br>
12<br><br>
(2)	Manufacture of negative plate<br>
The negative plate is manufactured according to the production process of a negative plate of a liquid-electrolyte lithium ion battery. The graphite from Xingcheng, Changsha is selected as the negative electrode material, and the water adhesives, sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and SBR latex, are selected as the adhesive. During the slurry preparation process, first dissolve 2 parts by weight of CMC in 100 parts by weight of water, then add 5 parts by weight of SBR latex while stirring, add 92 parts by weight of graphic powder, and finally obtain the negative electrode slurry after continuous intense stir for 4 hours. Then apply the negative electrode slurry to the double sides of a copper foil of 12 urn in thickness with the small coater of 4 m in length, and obtain a negative plate after drying.<br>
(3)	Manufacture of square "053048S" battery<br>
Cut the positive plate, the negative plate, and a diaphragm paper (Celgard 2300) according to the required size of Model "053048S" battery. Then go through in sequence the following processes commonly adopted in manufacture of the batteries: Spot welding of a tab, drying of the plate, rolling, cladding, laser welding of a cover, drying, and injecting of the electrolyte. The produced battery can then go through a precharging process and a formation process.<br>
(4)	Battery test<br>
Inject 2.4 g of the organic electrolyte into the dried semifinished battery, and leave it for 2 hours. Then test according to a certain charge-discharge system, which is as below: In Step 1, charge with a constant current of 0.05 CmA for 60 min; in Step 2, charge with a constant current of 0.1 CmA for 50 min; in Step 3, charge with a constant current of 0.5 CmA till the voltage reaches 4.2 V; in Step 4, charge with a constant voltage of 4.2 V till the current<br>
13<br><br>
reaches 30 mA, and leave it for 5 min; in Step 5, discharge at a constant current of 0.5 CmA till the voltage reaches 3.0 V, and leave it for 5 min; in Step 6, charge with a constant current of 1 CmA at a constant voltage; in Step 7, discharge at a current of 1 CmA till the voltage reaches 2.75 V; and thereby finish the steps of precharge and formation of the battery. Finally, seal the battery to produce the finished steel-clad battery Model "0530488".<br>
Then perform a cycle test on the battery that has been precharged and formed according to the following system: In Step 1, charge with a constant current of 1 CmA till the voltage reaches 4.2 V; in Step 2, charge with a constant voltage of 4.2 V till the current reaches 30 mA, and leave it for 5 min; in Step 3, discharge at a constant current of 1 CmA till the voltage reaches 2.75 V; and cycle according to such a system for times as required.<br>
Comparative example 1: Use a commercial lithium-ion secondary battery provided with the positive plate, which is made with LiCoO2 provided by CITIC Guoan Information Industry Co., Ltd. as the positive electrode material, and with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and N-methylpyrrolidone as the adhesive. Composition of the positive electrode is as below: 1000 g LiCoO2, 28 g Super P, 30 g PVDF, and 400 g NMP. Manufacture the negative plate and the 053048S steel-clad battery according to Embodiment 14, and test with the same method as above.<br>
The test result shows that, the battery provided with the positive plate manufactured by the method of the present invention has substantially the same performance as that manufactured with the common oil-phase coating process (refer to Figure 3). After the 100-time charge-discharge cycle test, the discharge capacity retention rate of the battery provided with the positive plate manufactured by the method of the present invention can reach up to 92%, which satisfies the battery quality standards (refer to Figures 1 and 2).<br>
