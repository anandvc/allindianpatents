				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a cyclopropylacetylene derivative, an intermediate in synthesis of the<br>
cyclopropylacetylene derivative and a process for the preparation of the same.  A cyclopropylacetylene derivative produced according to the present invention is useful as an intermediate in synthesis for a compound having a cyclopropane skeleton, for example a benzoxazinone derivative (L-743726), which has an anti-HIV activity (Tetrahedron Letters, vol. 36, p. 8937 (1995)). Description of the Related Art<br>
Recently, a large number of physiologically active substances having a cyclopropane skeleton have been discovered.  Examples of known methods of producing cyclopropylacetylene, which is useful for an intermediate in synthesis for these compounds, are:  (1) a method in which 5-chloropentyne is reacted with n-butyllithium (Tetrahedron Letters, vol. 36, p. 8937 (1995)); and (2) a method in which cyclopropyl methyl ketone is reacted with phosphorus pentachloride in carbon tetrachloride to produce l,1-dichloro-l-cyclopropylethane, which is subsequently dehydrochlorinated by potassium tert-butoxide (Synthesis, p. 703 (1972)).<br>
However, the method (1) provides as a low yield of the raw material 5-chloropentyne as 57% (Journal of American Chemical Society, vol. 67, p-484 (1945)), and the method (2) gives many byproducts and hence is low in the yield of the target<br>
-1A<br><br>
product.  Therefore, these methods are hard to evaluate as being industrially useful methods for cyclopropylacetylene.<br>
On the other hand, known is a method in which a propynol derivative is reacted with an alkyl (di)halide in liquid ammonia in the presence of lithium amide to give an acetylene derivative (Bulletin de la Societe Chimique de France, pp. 201-204 (1968)), but no method for transforming the obtained acetylene derivative to a compound having a cyclopropane skeleton is disclosed or suggested therein.  In addition, there is known a method in which cyclopropylacetylene is reacted with acetone or cyclopropyl methyl ketone by ethynylation to give 2-methyl-4-cyclopropyl-3-butyn-2-ol or 2,4-dicyclopropyl-3-butyn-2-ol (Izvetiya Akademii Nark SSSR, Seriya Khimicheskaya, pp. 1339-1344 (1978)), but no description is found for its reverse reaction.<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a method by which a cyclopropylacetylene derivative can be produced in a good yield and advantageously in a commercial production.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an intermediate, which is useful in the production of the cyclopropylacetylene derivative, and a method for the preparation of the intermediate.<br>

The leaving groups on the 1- and 3-positions of the propane derivative (VI) may be identical or different.  The use of leaving groups having<br>

When the amount of the base is 2 or more equivalents, preferably from 2 equivalents to 10 equivalents, relative to the propynol derivative (I), a cyclopropane derivative (III) is predominantly obtained.  On the contrary, when a reaction is conducted using less than 2 equivalents, preferably 1 or more equivalent and less than 2 equivalents of the base relative to the propynol derivative (I) at a reaction temperature of 0oc or lower, preferably<br>
-40oC or lower, an acetylene derivative (II) is predominantly obtained.<br>

A reaction may usually be conducted in any solvent as far as it gives no adverse influence on the reaction.  Example of the solvents include diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane and other ethers; pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, petroleum ether, benzene, toluene, xylene and other hydrocarbons; N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, hexamethylphosphoric triamide and other amides; dimethyl sulfoxide; ammonia; methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, butylamine, diethylamine, ethylenediamine, N,N,N',N'-<br>
tetramethylethylenediamine and other amines; or mixture solvents of these solvents.  The amount of the solvent is preferably within the range from 1 to 200 times as much as the weight of the propynol derivative (I).<br>
The reaction is carried out by reacting a base to with a mixture of a propynol derivative (I) and a solvent under an inert gas atmosphere and subsequently adding a propane derivative (VI) to the resulting mixture.  The reaction temperature is preferably within the range from -lOOOC to 100OC and more preferably from -50oC to 30Oc for the purpose of obtaining a cyclopropane derivative (III).<br>

By way of example, the reaction mixture is poured into water, aqueous ammonium chloride solution or the like, subjected to extraction with an organic solvent such as diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, methylene chloride or the like, and an extract is washed, if necessary, with an aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, water, a saline solution or the like to remove an acidic substance and a water-soluble substance, the extract is further dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, anhydrous magnesium sulfate or the like and thereafter further concentrated. The obtained crude product can be, as necessary, purified by distillation, chromatography.<br>
- 11-<br><br>
recrystallization or the like.  Without purification the crude product may be provided for next reaction.<br>
Step 3:  A step of producing a cyclopropylpropynol derivative (IV) by deprotecting a protecting group for hydroxyl group of a cyclopropane derivative (III)<br>
When the protecting group for a hydroxyl group is a tri-substituted silyl group, a<br>
cyclopropylpropynol derivative (IV) can be obtained by a commonly used desilylation method.  Such methods include, for example, a method of reacting a cyclopropane derivative (III) with<br>
tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran, a method of reacting it with hydrofluoric acid in water, a method of reacting it with acetic acid in water or in a mixture solvent of tetrahydrofuran and water, and a method of reacting it with potassium carbonate in methanol.  When the protecting group for a hydroxyl group is an acetal group, a cyclopropylpropynol derivative (IV) can be obtained by a commonly used deacetalation method, including for example a method of reacting a cyclopropane derivative (III) with an acid in an alcoholic solvent.<br>
The reaction temperature is preferably within the range from -lOOOC to 100OC and more preferably from -30OC to 70OC .<br>
Thus obtained cyclopropylpropynol derivative (IV) can be isolated and purified in the usual manner for isolation and purification of organic compounds.  By way of illustration, after confirming the completion of the reaction and neutralizing an acid catalyst with a base such as sodium methoxide, the reaction mixture is poured into water, subjected to extraction with an organic solvent such as<br>
- 12-<br><br>
remove an acidic substance and a water-soluble substance, the extract is further dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, anhydrous magnesium sulfate or the like and thereafter further concentrated, and the obtained crude product can be, as necessary, purified by distillation, chromatography, recrystallization or the like. Without purification, the crude product may be provided for next reaction.<br>
Step 2 :  A step of producing a cyclopropane derivative (III) by reacting an acetylene derivative (II) with a base<br>
Examples of the bases include methyllithium, n-butyllithium, sec-butyllithium, tert-butyllithium and other alkyllithium compounds; phenyllithium and other aryllithium compounds; methylmagnesium chloride, ethylmagnesium bromide and other alkylmagnesium halides; lithium amide, sodium amide, potassium amide, lithium diethylamide, lithium diisopropylamide, lithium bistrimethylsilylamide, sodium bistrimethylsilylamide, potassium bistrimethylsilylamide, bromomagnesium diisopropylamide and other metal amides; lithium methoxide, sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide, sodium tert-butoxide, potassium tert-butoxide and other metal alkoxides; sodium hydride, potassium hydride and other alkali metal hydrides and others.  The base is preferably used in an amount in the range from 1 equivalent to 3 equivalents relative to the acetylene derivative (II).<br>
In usual, a reaction may be conducted in any solvent as far as it gives no adverse influence on the reaction.  Examples of the solvents include diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane and<br>
- 10-<br><br>
diethyl ether, ethyl acetate or methylene chloride, and an extract is washed, if necessary, with an aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, water, a saline solution or the like in order to remove an acidic substance and a water-soluble substance, the extract is further dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, anhydrous magnesium sulfate or the like and thereafter further concentrated, and the obtained crude product can be, as necessary, purified by distillation, chromatography, recrystallization or the like.  Without purification, the crude product may be provided for next reaction.<br>
Step 4:  A step of producing a cyclopropylacetylene derivative (V) by subjecting a cyclopropylpropynol derivative (IV) to retro-ethynylation<br>
As a method for retro-ethynylation of a cyclopropylpropynol derivative (IV), a method of reacting the compound with a base is commonly employed.  Examples of the bases used here include lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and other alkali metal hydroxides; magnesium hydroxide and other alkaline earth metal hydroxides ,* lithium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate and other carbonates; methyllithium, n-butyllithium, sec-butyllithium, tert-butyllithium and other alkyllithium compounds; phenyllithium and other aryllithium compounds ,-methylmagnesium chloride, ethylmagnesium bromide and other alkylmagnesium halides; lithium amide, sodium amide, potassium amide, lithium diethylamide, lithium diisopropylamide, lithium bistrimethylsilylamide, sodium bistrimethylsilylamide, potassium bistrimethylsilylamide, bromomagnesium diisopropylamide and other metal amides; lithium<br>

methoxide, sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide, sodium tert-butoxide, potassium tert-butoxide and other metal alkoxides; sodium hydride, potassium hydride and other alkali metal hydrides and the like.  A catalytic amount of the base is sufficient to use, whereas the amount of the base is preferably within the range from 0.001 equivalent to 5 equivalents relative to the cyclopropylpropynol derivative (IV).<br>
A reaction may generally be conducted in the presence or in the absence of a solvent.  The solvent is not specially restricted as far as it does not adversely affect the reaction and includes, for instance, methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, sec-butanol, tert-butanol, n-octanol and other alcohols; diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane and other ethers; pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, petroleum ether, benzene, toluene, xylene and other hydrocarbons; N,N-dimethyIformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, hexamethylphosphoric triamide and other amides; dimethyl sulfoxide; or mixture solvents of these solvents.  The amount of the solvent is preferably within the range from 1 to 200 times as much as the weight of the cyclopropylpropynol derivative (IV).<br>
The reaction is preferably carried out under an inert gas atmosphere.  The reaction temperature is preferably within the range from -100OC to 15OC , and more preferably from -30OC to 80OC .  The reaction can also be conducted while distilling a cyclopropylacetylene derivative (V) produced during the reaction.<br>
Thus obtained cyclopropylacetylene derivative (V) can be isolated and purified in the usual manner for isolation and purification of organic compounds.<br>
- 14-<br><br>
By way of example, the reaction mixture is poured into water, subjected to extraction with an organic solvent such as diethyl ether, ethyl acetate or methylene chloride, and an extract is washed, if necessary, with an aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, water, a saline solution or the like to remove an acidic substance and a water-soluble substance, the extract is further dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, anhydrous magnesium sulfate or the like and thereafter further concentrated, and the obtained crude product can be, as necessary, purified by distillation, chromatography, recrystallization or the like.<br>
As thus described, the present invention provides a process whereby a cyclopropylacetylene derivative can be obtained in a good yield and advantageously on an industrial scale.<br>
The propynol derivative (I) as a starting material in the above steps can be obtained by introducing a protecting group for a hydroxyl group into a propynol compound represented by the following formula:<br><br>
R6<br>
OH<br>
R7<br>
wherein R6 and R7 have the same meanings as defined above.  As such propynol compounds, use can be made of various available compounds, of which preferred are 2-methyl-2-hydroxy-3-butyne, 3-methyl-3-hydroxy-4-propyne, 2,6-dimethyl-6-hydroxy-7-octyne, 2,6-dimethyl-6-hydroxy-oct-2-en-7-yne or the like for their availability on an industrial scale.<br>
The aforementioned reaction of introducing a protecting group for a hydroxyl group into the propynol compound can be carried out in the<br>
- 15-<br><br>
following manner:  For example, a tri-substituted silyl group can be introduced as a protecting group for a hydroxyl group by reacting a tri-substituted silyl halide such as trimethylchlorosilane, tert-butyldimethylchlorosilane or tert-<br>
