Process for the preparation of pure flupirtine maleate<br>
and its A modification<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the<br>
preparation of pure flupirtine maleate and the pure A<br>
crystal modification of flupirtine maleate.<br>
Flupirtine maleate is 2-amino-3-carbethoxyammo-6- (p- J<br>
fluorobenzylammo)pyridine maleate (I) . This compound<br>
is commercially available under the trade name<br>
Katadolon® and is used in particular as an analgesic.<br>
The preparation of flupirtine maleate is described in<br>
DE 31 33 519.<br>
2-amino-3-nitro-6-(4-fluorobenzylamino)pyridine (ANFP)<br>
is dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol and is hydrogenated<br>
with hydrogen in the presence of Raney nickel at 5 bar<br>
and 60°C to give 2,3-diammo-6- (4-fluorobenzyl-<br>
ammo)pyridine. This is acylated with ethyl<br>
chloroformate and triethylamine under inert gas to give<br>
flupirtine base. The catalyst is filtered off and a<br>
solution of isopropanol and maleic acid is added<br>
directly to the filtrate which contains triethylamine<br>
hydrochloride, crude flupirtine maleate being precipi-<br>
tated with vigorous stirring under an inert-gas<br>
atmosphere.<br>
Since it became known that the solvent 2-methoxyethanol<br>
used for the hydrogenation of ANFP is associated with a<br>
health risk owing to its considerable potential danger<br>
in the urogenital region, this compound is an unaccept-<br>
able solvent for this reaction on the industrial scale.<br>
During the precipitation of flupirtine maleate from the<br>
parent base, the avoidance of troublesome coloured<br>
complexes induced by atmospheric oxygen is of decisive<br>
importance. According to the colour intensity, they may<br>
very greatly impair the further purification up to on-<br>
spem flupirtine maleate.<br><br>
The exclusion of atmospheric oxygen by an intensive<br>
supply of inert gas and a closed reactor system is<br>
therefore absolutely essential in this reaction step.<br>
In a very time-consuming and inconvenient purification<br>
process, crude flupirtine maleate is converted into<br>
crude flupirtine base by liberation with ammonia or<br>
sodium hydroxide solution. The liberation process gives<br>
ammonium or sodium salts which pollute the waste water<br>
and constitute a troublesome accompanying phenomenon<br>
from the ecological point of view. The crude flupirtine<br>
base is recrystallized from isopropanol and, after<br>
clarification with activated carbon/kieselguhr, is<br>
reacted with a solution of maleic acid in isopropanol<br>
to give pure flupirtine maleate.<br>
The complicated process used to date can be illustrated<br>
by the following reaction scheme:<br>
A: ANFP → hydrogenation → acylation → crude<br>
flupirtine base I<br>
B: crude flupirtine base I → maleic acid →<br>
crude flupirtine maleate<br>
C: crude flupirtine maleate → liberation →<br>
crude flupirtine base II<br>
D: crude flupirtine base II → recrystallization<br>
→ pure flupirtine base<br>
E: pure flupirtine base → maleic acid →<br>
modification → pure flupirtine maleate<br>
where reaction steps C - E are required purification<br>
steps without which pure, uniform and on-spec pure<br>
maleate could not be obtained. They are very labour-<br>
intensive and expensive purification operations,<br><br><br>
considerably lengthen the synthesis process and lead to<br>
an on-spec pure flupirtine maleate only by a compli-<br>
cated and inconvenient route which is very expensive in<br>
terms of production technology.<br>
The extremely large reactor volumes which are required<br>
for the crystallization of the flupirtine base and for<br>
the precipitation of the flupirtine maleate and tie up<br>
a considerable amount of production capacity are<br>
considered a further criterion indicating a very high<br>
level of technical complexity in the purification steps<br>
C and E.<br>
By metric ton of flupirtine maleate, 25 t of waste<br>
solution which contain 2-methoxyethanol, isopropanol,<br>
ammonia, ammonium maleate and water must be disposed of<br>
by incineration.<br>
This procedure is very uneconomical and difficult to<br>
handle and furthermore does not meet the requirements<br>
for environmentally acceptable production.<br>
The flupirtine maleate is generally obtained as a<br>
mixture of 2 crystal modifications A and B, these being<br>
present in the mixture in different ratios.<br>
Such mixtures present a major problem with regard to<br>
further pharmaceutical processing In particular, this<br>
has an adverse effect with regard to maintaining<br>
constant pharmaceutical production conditions and hence<br>
with respect to guaranteeing the pharmaceutical quality<br>
of an active ingredient. These different mixtures of<br>
crystal modifications lead to different release rates<br>
during release from the pharmaceutical formulation in<br>
the human body. This deficiency may delay the onset of<br>
action of flupirtine maleate as the active ingredient<br>
and hence falsify the activity balance<br><br>
It is thus the object to develop a simple, environ-<br>
mentally acceptable process for the preparation of pure<br>
flupirtine maleate from which the pure A modification<br>
can be obtained by crystal modification.<br>
According to the invention, the object is achieved by<br>
carrying out the hydrogenation of 2-amino-3-nitro-6-(4-<br>
fluorobenzylamino)pyridine (ANFP) in the presence of<br>
Raney nickel, acylation of the intermediate 2,3-di-<br>
amino-6-(4-fluorobenzylamino)pyridine (DAFP) with ethyl<br>
chloroformate and the reaction of the resulting flupir-<br>
tine base with maleic acid in water-soluble alcohols,<br>
such as ethanol or isopropanol.<br>
The following process variants are possible:<br>
1st process variant:<br>
A: ANFP → hydrogenation → acylation →<br>
crude flupirtine base<br>
B: crude flupirtine base → maleic acid →<br>
crude flupirtine maleate<br>
C - E: not applicable<br>
F: crude maleate → pure maleate<br>
The dissolved and very oxygen-sensitive crude base<br>
synthesized in situ in process step A was con-<br>
verted by a very rapid suction filtration process<br>
into an aqueous maleic acid solution from which<br>
crude flupirtine maleate having far less colour<br>
than the earlier product is immediately precipi-<br>
tated with stirring. After crystallization in<br>
isopropanol-water, said crude flupirtine maleate<br>
gave an on-spec pure maleate in about 85% yield<br><br><br>
This dramatic shortening of the preparation pro-<br>
cess for flupirtme maleate in comparison with the<br>
processes practised to date, with bypassing of the<br>
process steps C-E, makes it possible to obtain the<br>
pure maleate directly from the crude flupirtme<br>
maleate and to eliminate the troublesome colour<br>
problems in the flupirtme preparation at an early<br>
stage.<br>
2nd process variant:<br>
A: ANFP → hydrogenation → acylation →<br>
crude flupirtine base<br>
B: flupirtine base v maleic acid → crude<br>
flupirtine maleate<br>
C - F: not applicable<br>
G: without isolation of the crude maleate →<br>
pure maleate<br>
As compared with process step F, process step G<br>
represents a substantially shorter alternative<br>
process in which the precipitation of crude<br>
flupirtme maleate from the flupirtme base formed<br>
in situ in isopropanol is effected by filtration<br>
with suction into an aqueous maleic acid solution<br>
at 50-60°C and, after crystal modification,<br>
colourless pure flupirtine maleate is obtained in<br>
85-90% yield.<br>
3rd process variant:<br>
A.	ANFP → hydrogenation → acylation →<br>
crude flupirtme base (isolated)<br>
B.	pure flupirtme base → maleic acid →<br>
pure flupirtine maleate<br><br>
Here, after acylation is complete, the flupirtxne<br>
base is precipitated preferably in ethanol or<br>
water and is purified by simple recrystallization<br>
The preparation of the pure flupirtme maleate is<br>
then carried out analogously to the process<br>
variants mentioned.<br>
It was completely surprising that both the<br>
hydrogenation of ANFP and the acylation of the DAFP<br>
formed with ethyl chloroformate can be carried out in<br>
water-soluble alcohols, such as ethanol or isopropanol.<br>
Here, precipitation in aqueous maleic acid solution<br>
 gives a nickel-free flupirtine maleate which no longer<br>
need be subjected to a complicated, multistage<br>
purification process.<br>
The fact that for the first time a white product free<br>
of coloured complexes was obtained in the precipitation<br>
of crude flupirtme maleate, so that here too no addi-<br>
tional purification operations are required, proved to<br>
be a further advantage.<br>
In the subsequent crystal modification to obtain the<br>
pure A modification of flupirtine maleate, it was<br>
found, totally surprisingly, that mixtures of the two<br>
imodifications A and B of flupirtme maleate can be<br>
converted into a ^single-phase flujDirj^ine maleate con-<br>
sisting only of the A modifition under certain<br>
conditions by stirring. <br>
A high proportion of the A modification in the starting<br>
sample, high solids concentration m the suspension<br>
(1:1 to 1:0.8) and temperatures in the range from -10<br>
to 60°C have proved particularly advantageous<br>
At high solids concentration (1-1) and temperatures<br>
between 20 and 60°C, however, it was also possible to<br><br>
convert flupirtme maleate present predominantly in the<br>
B modification (90% of B) completely into the A<br>
modification in stirring times of 2 to 5 hours, the<br>
fact that the establishment of the desired crystal<br>
modification A can also be achieved at temperatures of<br>
0 to 30°C having been found as a particularly surpris-<br>
ing advantage.<br>
If these discoveries are applied to the precipitation<br>
process (combination of flupirtine base and maleic acid<br>
in a suitable solvent), the conditions required<br>
according to prior art for achieving a very high<br>
primary proportion of the A modification will first be<br>
maintained but then the complete conversion of B<br>
fractions present into the A modification will be<br>
ensured by an appropriately performed stirring process.<br>
Expediently, the stirring process will follow directly<br>
after the precipitation, that is to say that, beginning<br>
during the cooling, the stirring is also continued<br>
after cooling to room temperature until the conversion<br>
is complete. The solids concentration is kept as high<br>
as possible.<br>
Surprisingly, previously unknown crystallized solvates<br>
of flupirtme maleate were found during the recrystal-<br>
lization and precipitation, both in isopropanol and in<br>
ethanol<br>
The solvates observed in the crystal suspensions are<br>
converted into the A modification during the stirring<br>
process On the other hand, no solvate or hydrate<br>
formation is observed when crystals dried beforehand to<br>
constant weight are dispersed in isopropanol, ethanol<br>
or water. The solvates were observed only during the<br>
primary crystallization (nucleation).<br>
Furthermore, it was found that predried crystals which<br>
are freed from externally adsorbed solvent but still<br><br>
contaxn solvent bound internally within the crystal can<br>
be converted into the B modification by heating to<br>
temperatures of about 80 - 100°C. Subsequent formation<br>
of the B modification from solvate during the technical<br>
drying is prevented by sufficiently long stirring of<br>
the crystal suspension after the maleate precipitation.<br>
Phase analysis<br>
The crystallized phases of flupirtme maleate,<br>
modifications A and B and isopropanol and ethanol<br>
solvate were determined by X-ray diffraction using a<br>
powder diffractometer. In this method, a transformed<br>
image of the crystal structure or structures present is<br>
obtained, which image is formed by summation of the<br>
diffraction effects at a very large number of crystals.<br>
This method is therefore particularly suitable for<br>
determining the composition of mixtures consisting of<br>
different crystallized phases. Fresh, still solvent-<br>
moist samples can also be investigated by this method.<br>
Furthermore, structural changes associated with phase<br>
transitions can be directly observed.<br>
Method: X-ray diffractometry<br>
Diffraction patterns of modifications A and B<br>
The lower part of Figure 1 shows the diffraction<br>
patterns of modifications A and B, and Table 1 shows<br>
the powder data. Both modifications show characteristic<br>
reflections which do not coincide with the reflection<br>
of the respective other modification. These are in<br>
particular the strong reflections at 6.9, 9.2 and<br>
17.9°2d in the case of the A modification and in<br>
particular the strongest reflection at 5.5°2d in the<br>
case of the B modification The limit of detection for<br>
the B modification is ≤ 1% (Figure 2).<br><br><br><br><br>
Diffraction patterns of the solvates<br>
The upper part of Figure 1 shows the two solvates of<br>
flupirtme maleate.<br>
The diffraction patterns of the solvates differ from<br>
those of modifications A and B in particular in the<br>
occurrence of additional reflections. Solvate is<br>
detectable alongside the two modifications in<br>
particular from the reflection at 6.4°2d (d=13.7 A).<br>
The B modification is detectable alongside solvate<br>
whereas small proportions of the A modification are not<br>
detected alongside solvate. The relationship between<br>
the diffraction patterns of the solvates and the<br>
diffraction pattern of the A modification indicates<br>
that the intracrystalline solvent incorporation takes<br>
place during the nucleation of the A modification.<br>
Thermal reactions of the crystal phases<br>
Methods:<br>
•	Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)<br>
•	Thermal gravimetry (TG)<br>
•	Temperature-controlled X-ray diffractometry<br>
Figure 3 shows the DSC curves of the two modifications.<br>
The A modification undergoes two endothermic reactions,<br>
that is to say the transformation point A	&gt; B at<br>
164 °C (onset) and the melting point for the B<br>
modification at 184°C (onset) The B modification shows<br>
only one endothermic effect at 184°C, which indicates<br>
melting<br><br>
Figure 4 shows the thermal lattice transformation<br>
A	&gt; B. In agreement with the DSC result, the strong<br>
reflection of the B modification at 5.5°29 appears at<br>
165°C.<br>
Figures 5 and 6 show the different courses of the<br>
crystal reactions on heating solvent-moist and predried<br>
crystals, taking crystals obtained from isopropanol as<br>
an example. In the moist state, desolvation occurs<br>
together with release of the externally bound solvent<br>
with formation of the A modification, which is then<br>
converted into the B modification at 164°C<br>
In the dry state, the dehydration takes place at<br>
substantially higher temperature with formation of the<br>
B modification.<br>
Figure 7 shows the thermal lattice transformations in<br>
the case of crystals obtained from isopropanol.<br>
Initially, solvate (6.4°2d) is present alongside the A<br>
modification. At 95°C, the characteristic solvate<br>
reflection disappears and the characteristic reflection<br>
of the B modification at 5.5°29 appears. On further<br>
heating, the characteristic reflections of the A modi-<br>
fication at 6.9 and 9.2°29 also disappear while the<br>
intensity of the B reflection increases greatly.<br>
The process according to the invention for the<br>
preparation of pure flupirtine maleate and of the pure<br>
A modification of flupirtine maleate has the following<br>
decisive advantages:<br>
•	In process step A, the unacceptable solvent<br>
2-methoxyethanol is replaced by water-soluble<br>
alcohols, such as isopropanol or ethanol<br>
•	In the same process step, the reaction time of the N-<br>
acylation can be reduced from two hours to half an<br><br>
hour, resulting in a reduction m the range of by-<br>
products and in the concentration of troublesome<br>
coloured complexes.<br>
•	The complicated purification steps C - E of the<br>
flupirtine process used to date are dispensed with.<br>
The crude maleate can be converted into pure<br>
flupirtine maleate by a problem-free purification<br>
process or the preparation of the pure flupirtine<br>
maleate is effected directly from the flupirtine base<br>
formed in situ.<br>
•	The temperature for the establishment of the pure<br>
crystal modification was reduced from a range of 60<br>
to 65°C to a range of -10 to 60°C.<br>
•	It was possible for the first time to prepare the<br>
pure A modification of flupirtine maleate<br>
The process according to the invention is to be<br>
illustrated in more detail with reference to examples:<br>
1st Example<br>
Preparation of pure flupirtine maleate<br>
75 g (0.286 mol) of ANFP are hydrogenated in a<br>
suspension of 12.5 g of Raney nickel in 400 ml of<br>
isopropanol at 65°C and a hydrogen pressure of 5 bar.<br>
After hydrogenation is complete, 26.4 ml of ethyl<br>
chloroformate and then 50.6 ml of triethylamine are<br>
added to the solution. After the addition of a further<br>
6.3 ml of ethyl chloroformate, the reaction solution is<br>
stirred for a further hour at 60°C. The hot solution is<br>
then sucked, with stirring, into a solution of 53.3 g<br>
of maleic acid in 1 5 1 of H2O, which solution has been<br>
heated to 50 - 60°C, and the catalyst is rinsed with a<br>
little isopropanol.<br><br>
The flupirtxne maleate is precipitated in colourless<br>
form and the crystal suspension is cooled to 20°C with<br>
further stirring and is left at this temperature for 20<br>
minutes. The flupirtine maleate is filtered off with<br>
suction, rinsed with about 500 ml of water and dried in<br>
vacuo at 35°C.<br>
Yield: 107 55 g (89.6% of theory, based on ANFP used).<br>
2nd Example<br>
Preparation of pure flupirtine maleate<br>
18.5 g (0.07 mol) of ANFP are hydrogenated analogously<br>
to Example 1 in a suspension of 2.0 g of Raney nickel<br>
in 140 ml of ethanol at 60 - 70°C and a hydrogen<br>
pressure of 5 bar. After hydrogenation is complete, the<br>
further reaction is carried out at 40 - 50°C with 9.3 g<br>
of ethyl chloroformate (0.86 mol) and 9.2 g of<br>
triethylamme (0.91 mol). The reaction solution separ-<br>
ated from the catalyst is introduced into 540 ml of<br>
water with stirring. After stirring has been carried<br>
out for 2 hours at room temperature, the precipitated<br>
base is filtered off with suction, washed with water<br>
and isopropanol and crystallized in 3.7 times the<br>
amount of isopropanol.<br>
Yield: 18.4 g (86.0% of theory).<br>
The precipitation and modification of pure flupirtine<br>
maleate is carried out according to Examples 7 and 8.<br>
3rd Example<br>
Preparation of the pure A modification of flupirtine<br>
maleate<br>
Dried flupirtine maleate which was crystallized from<br>
isopropanol and contained 10% of the A modification in<br><br>
addition to 90% of the B modification (Figure 8, bottom<br>
curve) was dispersed in isopropanol in a ratio of<br>
1:0.8. After stirring had been carried out for 200<br>
minutes at 20°C, the characteristic strong B reflection<br>
at 5.5°29 had disappeared and only the characteristic<br>
reflections of the A modification at 6.9 and 9.2°29<br>
were observed (Figure 8. middle curve).<br>
4th Example<br>
Dried flupirtme maleate which was crystallized from<br>
isopropanol and contained 10% of the A modification in<br>
addition to 90% of the B modification was dispersed in<br>
isopropanol in a ratio of 1:0.8 and stirred at 35°C.<br>
After stirring had been carried out for only 70<br>
minutes, the characteristic strong B reflection at<br>
5.5°29 had disappeared and only the characteristic<br>
reflections of the A modification at 6.9 and 9.2° 29<br>
were observed.<br>
5th Example<br>
Slightly less than the maximum soluble amount of<br>
flupirtine maleate was completely dissolved in isoprop-<br>
anol at 60°C, slowly cooled to 20°C and then stirred at<br>
20°C. Before the beginning of stirring, solvate was<br>
observed in addition to the A modification (Figure 9.<br>
bottom curve). After 12 0 minutes, only the A modifica-<br>
tion was detectable (Figure 9. middle curve) No re-<br>
formation of solvate was observed even after the<br>
suspension was allowed to stand for 3 days (Figure 9.<br>
top curve).<br>
6th Example<br>
Slightly less than the maximum soluble amount of<br>
flupirtme maleate was completely dissolved at 60°C in<br>
isopropanol which contained 5% of water, cooled to 20°C<br>
and then stirred at 20°C Before the beginning of<br><br>
stirring, solvate was present in addition to the A<br>
modification. After stirring had been carried out for<br>
130 minutes, only the A modification was detectable.<br>
7th Example<br>
Stoichiometric amounts of flupirtme base and of maleic<br>
acid were dissolved in isopropanol at 50°C. The<br>
precipitation of the flupirtine maleate was carried out<br>
by dropwise addition of the maleic acid solution to the<br>
solution of the base at 40°C. The freshly precipitated<br>
crystals contained solvate in addition to the B<br>
modification (Figure 10. lower curve) After stirring<br>
had been carried out for only 40 minutes at 40°C, both<br>
the solvate and the B modification had been completely<br>
converted into the A modification (Figure 10, upper<br>
curve).<br>
8th Example<br>
Stoichiometric amounts of flupirtine base and of maleic<br>
acid were dissolved m ethanol at 40°C. The precipita-<br>
tion of the flupirtine maleate was carried out by<br>
dropwise addition of the maleic acid solution to the<br>
solution of the base at 40°C. In the freshly prepared<br>
crystals, only solvate was detectable (Figure 11. lower<br>
curve). After stirring had been carried out for only 15<br>
minutes at 40°C, the solvate had been completely<br>
converted into the A modification (Figure 11. upper<br>
curve).<br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	Process for the preparation of pure flupirtine maleate by<br>
hydrogenation of 2-amino-3-nitro-6-(4-fiuorobenzylamino)<br>
pyridine (ANFP) in the presence of Raney nickel, acylation with<br>
ethyl chloroformate and reaction of the resulting flupirtine base<br>
with maleic acid, characterized in that the hydrogenation, acylation<br>
and precipitation are carried out in water-soluble alcohols.<br>
2.	Process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the alcohols used are<br>
preferably ethanol or isopropanol.<br>
3.	Process as claimed in claim 1, wherein either<br><br>
a)	the crude flupirtine maleate is isolated and is converted into<br>
[sic] the pure maleate or<br>
b)	the maleate is precipitated by reacting the flupirtine base<br>
formed in situ with maleic acid and is converted into the pure<br>
flupirtine maleate without isolation or<br>
c)	the crude flupirtine base is precipitated and recrystallized and<br>
then converted into pure flupirtine maleate by reaction with<br>
maleic acid<br>
4.	Process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the reaction is<br>
carried out at a temperature between -10 and 60°C.<br><br>
5.	Process for the preparation of the pure 'A' modification of flupirtine<br>
maleate, characterized in that the flupirtine maleate obtained as<br>
claimed in any of claims 1 to 3 is stirred in optionally water-<br>
containing isopropanol or ethanol.<br>
6.	Process as claimed in claim 5, wherein the stirring process is<br>
preferably carried out in the reaction mixture as claimed in claim<br>
3 c, containing flupirtine maleate which has crystallized out.<br>
