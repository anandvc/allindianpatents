				<td>Differential pressure microphone<br>
The invention relates to a sound pick-up having a pressure-difference microphone, arranged in a housing, for converting acoustic signals which are produced in the acoustic near field of the sound pick-up into an electric signal.<br>
The invention also relates to a remote control<br>
unit, in particular for wireless control of equipment by<br>
"acoustic input of command signals having a<br>
pressure-difference microphone arranged in the housing of<br>
the remote control unit.<br>
A known field of application of such sound pick ups relates, for example, to voice communication in a noisy environment. On the basis of the pressure-difference principle applied in this case, sound produced in the acoustic far field of the sound pick-up can be faded out or at least reduced so far that words spoken in the acoustic near field of the sound pick-up can be transmitted virtually undistorted for the purpose of intelligibility.<br>
Because of these properties, such sound pick-ups are also suitable for remote control devices with voice input of control commands, called voice commands below, into an appropriate remote control unit. However, it has been shown that breathing noises and the manner of pronunciation of specific command words can lead to misinterpretation of a voice command - such as,"p", in the case of a command word with a consonant which is pronounced hard.<br>
It is therefore the object of the invention to improve intelligibility in the case of a sound pick-up.<br>
This object is achieved by means of a sound pickup specified in Claim 1.<br>
It is therefore also the object of the invention to improve the recognition of command words in the case of a remote control device with such a sound pick-up.<br>
This object is achieved by means of a remote control unit specified in Claim 7.<br>
The invention is based on the idea of arranging a pressure-difference microphone in a housing, and of providing in one of the housing walls a single opening directed onto the front side of the microphone, for feeding voice commands which can be produced in the acoustic near field of the housing, the aim being to arrange the microphone in the housing in such a way that, and/or to form the air volume which is to surround the microphone, in such a way that the microphone can be irradiated with sound through the opening, using the pressure-difference principle.<br>
This configuration of the sound pick-up has the advantage, moreover, that a wind shield or the like can additionally be arranged in a simple way between the opening and the microphone.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail with the aid of an exemplary embodiment. In the accompanying drawing: Figure 1 shows a remote control with a sound pickup,<br>
and<br>
Figure 2 shows the remote control on an enlarged scale.<br>
Figure 1 shows with the aid of interconnected sketches a) and b) a remote control unit 1 of a remote control device (not illustrated) with a voice command input. It may be noted that in this case it is only the elements required to understand the invention which are illustrated.<br>
Sketch a) shows a sectional illustration of the top part of the remote control unit 1, which is designed according to the invention as a sound pick-up device. The structural principle of this sound pick-up device, termed sound pick-up below, can also be applied, according to the invention, to non-enclosed sound pick-ups, for example in combined intercommunication systems serving to communicate in a noisy environment, also called headsets.<br>
Sketch b) is a frontal illustration of the remote control device 1.<br>
Figure 2 shows a sectional illustration of the upper part of the remote control unit 1 on an enlarged scale with the sound pressure distribution on a pressure-difference microphone 3 of cuboid design, which is preferably mounted in a self-closed fashion in a rubber-like frame. Mutually corresponding parts are provided in this case with the same reference symbols. The frame 10 is arranged inside the remote control unit 1 by means of a holder (not illustrated) which is formed on the housing of the remote control unit 1.<br>
In principle, the sound pick-up is formed with the pressure-difference microphone 3 arranged in a cavity<br>
2. The cavity 2 forms in this case the upper housing wall 4 in conjunction with the lateral housing wail 5 of the remote control unit 1. The pressure-difference microphone 3 is arranged in the cavity 2 by means of the aforesaid holder and frame 10 in such a way that an acoustic signal 6 directed onto the front side of the microphone 3 and produced as a voice command by a voice command speaker 7 in the acoustic near field of the sound pick-up can flow virtually completely around the microphone 3, a single opening 8, directed onto the front side of the microphone<br>
3, being provided in one of the housing walls 5 for feeding the signal. As a result, according to the invention the microphone 3 is irradiated with sound through the opening 8 using the pressure-difference principle.<br>
The opening 8 is preferably of tubular design in the housing wall 5. Moreover, the size and arrangement of the opening 8 are matched to one another with reference to the microphone 3 and/or the air volume which surrounds the microphone 3 in the housing. The size and arrangement of the opening 8 can be determined empirically for example. It has emerged that in the case of the size relationship to be gathered from sketch a) a diameter of virtually 2 mm leads to optimum results.<br>
The pressure-difference principle for irradiating the microphone 3 with sound is maintained owing to the arrangement according to the invention of the microphone 3 in conjunction with the signal feed according to the invention, in particular that to be gathered from Figure 2. Consequently, intelligibility can be enhanced in conjunction with a sound pick-up serving merely for communication, and the command word recognition is improved in conjunction with a remote control device based on processing voice commands.<br>
In a development of the invention, a wind shield 9 is additionally provided between the opening 8 and the microphone 3. The wind shield 9 preferably consists of a foamed plastic or the like which is known per se and damps noise. Such a foamed plastic is also termed an acoustic foamed plastic. In this case, the shaping and arrangement of the wind shield 9 in the cavity 2 are such that the irradiation of the microphone 3 with sound is brought about virtually entirely through the wind shield 9. It is possible with the aid of this measure for undesired acoustic signal components such as, in particular, consonants pronounced hard in a voice command to be damped according to the invention, and this contributes to a further improvement in the command word recognition.<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1. Remote control unit 
one single opening (8) is arranged in a housing wall of the housing (4,5,) in front of the front side of the pressure-difference microphone (3) of the remote control unit, for the purpose of feeding the acoustic signal (6), and<br>
the microphone (3) is arranged in such a way that an air volume which surrounds the microphone (3) in the housing is formed in such a way that the microphone (3) is irradiated with sound through the opening (8), using the pressure—difference principle.<br>
2. Remote control unit as claimed in claim 1, wherein the size and arrangement of the opening (8) are matched to one another with reference to the microphone (3) or the air volume, which surrounds the microphone (3).<br>
3. Remote control unit as claimed in claim 2, wherein the opening (8) is of tubular design.<br>
4. Remote control unit as claimed in claim 1, wherein a wind shield (9) is additionally provided between the opening (S) and the microphone in order to suppress undesired acoustic signal components in the command signal (6).<br>
5. Remote control unit as claimed in claim 4, wherein the wind shield (9) consists of a foamed plastic.<br>
The pressure—difference microphone (3) is arranged in a housing,<br>
and there is provided in one of the housing walls (4,5) a single<br>
opening (8) directed onto the front side of the microphone, for<br>
feeding voice commands which can be produced in the acoustic near<br>
field of the housing. According to the invention, the arrangement<br>
of the microphone and/or the air volume which surrounds the<br>
microphone in this case are such that the microphone can be<br>
irradiated with sound through the opening, using the pressure-<br>
difference princple.</td>
