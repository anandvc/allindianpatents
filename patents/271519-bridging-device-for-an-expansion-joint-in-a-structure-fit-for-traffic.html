BRIDGING   DEVICE   FOR  AN  EXPANSION   JOINT   IN  A   STRUCTURE   FIT<br>
FOR  TRAFFIC<br>
The instant invention relates to a bridging device for an<br>
expansion joint fit for traffic, said expansion joint being<br>
placed between an abutment and a superstructure comprising<br>
the  following  features:<br>
a   number   of   cross-members   that   bridge   the   joint   gap<br>
extend  between  the  abutment  and  the  superstructure  and<br>
are        supported       on       the       abutment       and       on       the<br>
superstructure;<br>
a    multitude     of     slats     extending     in    a     longitudinal<br>
direction  of  the  joint  are  placed  between  the  abutment<br>
and   the   superstructure   and   are   each   supported   on   at<br>
least  one  portion  of  the  cross-members;<br>
the     distance     of     the     slats     from     one     another     is<br>
controlled   by    spring    devices    to    which    the    relevant<br>
slats  are  connected.<br>
Bridging devices of the type specified above, as they are<br>
used in particular in bridge building, are known in<br>
different designs. Possibilities for variations thereby<br>
exist, for example, with regard to the positioning of the<br>
cross-members in that one side thereof can be fixedly<br>
clamped (see, e.g., DE 19607593 Al) or in that they can be<br>
supported so as to slide on the abutment as well as on the<br>
superstructure (see, e.g., DE 3201751 C2). The slats can be<br>
supported so as to slide on all of the cross-members or<br>
individual slats or all of the slats are fixedly connected<br>
with assigned cross-members that, in each case, are<br>
supported so as to slide on the superstructure as well as<br>
on the abutment, whereby, in this case, a sliding support<br>
of the slats on the remaining cross-members is possible,<br>
but not imperative. The spring devices that are connected<br>
in serj.es in the form of a control chain are thereby<br>
supposed    to    provide    for    the    most    even    distances    of    the<br><br>
-  2  -<br>
slats to one another. Such a control of the slat distances<br>
across the entire spring devices is superior to a positive<br>
control of the slats (see, e.g., EP 0215980 Al) that<br>
provides for exactly the same slat distances in that it is<br>
far less susceptible to damages that can arise from<br>
possible constraints. These constraints can be created due<br>
to construction (with very large bridging devices due to<br>
the limited possibility for an inclination of the cross-<br>
members) as well as due to external influences (e.g.:<br>
jamming of a slat due to dirt in the sliding surfaces,<br>
blocking of an individual gap due to dirt or foreign<br>
objects   (e.g.   rock)   etc.).<br>
With narrow joint widths, the known bridging devices of the<br>
type specified above have indeed proven their worth.<br>
However, with average and in particular with large joint<br>
widths, special measures are required so as to prevent<br>
excessively large differences in the widths of the<br>
individual gap existing between, in each case, two mutually<br>
adjacent slats. The use of particularly low-friction<br>
sliding materials in the region of the support of the slats<br>
on the cross-members and/or the increase of the controlling<br>
forces via larger and harder control springs, respectively,<br>
deserve a particular mention here. These measures are<br>
associated with additional expenses and are not able to<br>
reliably prevent the particularly critical opening of<br>
individual gaps beyond a reliable measure with bridging<br>
devices that are designed for very large joint widths. With<br>
known bridging devices of the type specified above provided<br>
for particularly large joint widths, the latter requires<br>
the additional use of stops that confine the width of the<br>
individual gap. A mechanical coupling of mutually adjacent<br>
slats via activated stops, however, results in considerable<br>
dynamic stresses that, in turn, act to support wear.<br>
Incidentally, the stops are not suitable to contribute to a<br>
standardization of the gap widths of the individual gap<br>
below  the  maximally  admissible  gap  width.<br><br>
-   3  -<br>
It is the object of the instant invention to provide a<br>
bridging -device of the type specified above that, with a<br>
comparatively low constructive and production effort, is<br>
particularly suitable for very large joint widths, in that<br>
especially the opening of individual gaps beyond an<br>
admissible measure is, as a rule, reliably avoided simply<br>
via the control springs, that is, without requiring stops<br>
for doing so. It would thereby be particularly desirable if<br>
the result thereof were a steadying effect for the gap<br>
widths of the individual gap in the remaining operating<br>
sectors of the bridging device, e.g., in the event of a<br>
comparatively  small  joint  width.<br>
This object is solved with a bridging device of the type<br>
specified above in that the individual spring devices<br>
provide different controlling forces according to their<br>
arrangement inside the device, whereby the respective<br>
controlling force of the spring devices has a gradient<br>
transversal to the longitudinal direction of the joint. The<br>
controlling forces of the individual spring devices that<br>
are different in the direction of the control chain allow,<br>
in particular, for a consideration of those frictional<br>
forces acting between the slats and the cross-members with<br>
a sliding support of the slats on the cross-members that<br>
have to be overcome in the event of a tracking of the slats<br>
due to a change of the joint width and that add up from<br>
slat to slat. In other words, according to the instant<br>
invention, the frictional forces that act between the slats<br>
and the cross-members and that restrain a compensatory<br>
movement of the slats in the event of a changing joint<br>
width and that add up in the case of cross-members being<br>
clamped on one side from one joint edge to the other joint<br>
edge and in the case of cross-members being supported on<br>
both sides so as to slide from both joint edges to the<br>
center of the joint are compensated by the controlling<br>
forces    that    change    across    the    width    of    the    joint.     By<br><br>
-   4   -<br>
suitably tuning those controlling forces that are provided<br>
by the spring devices in the operating sector of large<br>
joint widths to the frictional forces that are different<br>
(summed up) in the direction of the control chain, an<br>
approximated balance of forces can be achieved between the<br>
controlling forces and the respective frictional forces<br>
that are to be overcome, whereby an inadmissibly large<br>
opening of individual gaps of the opening bridging device<br>
is  prevented.<br>
Especially the opening of individual gaps beyond an<br>
admissible measure can be reliably avoided with the<br>
application of the instant invention for such generic<br>
bridging devices that are designed for particularly large<br>
joint widths and that accordingly have a particularly high<br>
number of slats (e.g., more than 15), generally solely with<br>
the specific tuning of the controlling force gradient<br>
according to the invention and thus without forced control<br>
of the slats and without the use of stops. However, the<br>
instant invention is not only advantageous in this regard.<br>
Instead, representing an absolutely surprising result, the<br>
invention can, under the conditions that will be described<br>
in more detail below, can also have a positive effect on a<br>
standardization of the slat distances in other operating<br>
states of the bridging device as well (e.g. with a<br>
comparatively  small  joint  width).<br>
If one of the supports of the cross-members in the bridging<br>
device according to the invention is designed as a clamp<br>
and the other one is designed in a sliding manner, the<br>
gradient of the controlling force advantageously extends<br>
across the entire joint width. If, according to a preferred<br>
development of the invention, the spring devices, in the<br>
event of a maximal joint width, thereby each have a tension<br>
that acts in terms of a decrease of the slat distance, the<br>
controlling force gradient must be chosen in such a manner<br>
that   the   respective   controlling   force  of  the   spring  devices<br><br>
-  5   -<br>
increases in the direction from the clamp of the cross-<br>
members towards their sliding support. In case of a<br>
reversed tension that acts in terms of an increase of the<br>
slat distance in the event of a maximal joint width, the<br>
gradient extends in opposite direction. The above applies<br>
independent on whether the spring devices, according to a<br>
further preferred development of the invention, are<br>
substantially tension-free in a nominal position that lies<br>
between the maximally and the minimally admissible joint<br>
width or whether the spring devices, across the entire<br>
operating range of the bridging device, have a tension that<br>
acts in the same direction in terms of a decrease or an<br>
increase  of  the  slat  distance.<br>
The same applies in the case of a two-sided sliding support<br>
of the cross-members, that is, on the abutment as well as<br>
on the superstructure, provided that two opposite<br>
controlling force gradients prevail on both sides of a more<br>
or less centrally placed slat. Particularly in this case,<br>
provided that the spring devices have a tension in terms of<br>
a decrease of the slat distance in the event of a maximal<br>
joint width, the respective controlling force of the spring<br>
devices can increase in the direction from the center of<br>
the joint to the edges of the joint. This development will<br>
be  discussed  in  detail  below.<br>
Particular advantages of the invention arise if the spring<br>
devices in terms of the above explanations are<br>
substantially tension-free in a nominal position that lies<br>
between the maximally and the minimally admissible joint<br>
width and if the spring devices that provide different<br>
controlling forces have different degrees of stiffness,<br>
that        is,         differently        steep        force-displacement<br>
characteristics. This is so because, in this case, the<br>
controlling force gradient has a standardizing effect on<br>
the slat distances when opening the joint in the region of<br>
large   joint  widths   as  well  as  when  closing  the   joint   in  the<br><br>
-   6  -<br>
region of small joint widths. In so doing, a mechanical<br>
contact of the slats is effectively ruled out in operating<br>
positions that are close to the minimal joint width as<br>
well.<br>
In bridging devices, where the spring devices, in<br>
abandonment of the above-presented additional advantages,<br>
are not substantially tension-free in a nominal position<br>
located between the maximally and the minimally admissible<br>
joint width but instead are tensioned across the entire<br>
operating sector of the bridging device, it is also<br>
possible in the context of the instant invention that the<br>
spring units that provide different controlling forces do<br>
not have different degrees of stiffness, but are instead<br>
highly pretensioned to different degrees according to the<br>
controlling  force  gradient.<br>
The above-explained advantages that can be achieved if the<br>
instant invention is applied, are particularly pronounced,<br>
if the cross-members are supported so as to slide on both<br>
sides, that is, on the abutment as well as on the<br>
superstructure. This is so because, in this case, the<br>
respective frictional forces that sum up and that are to be<br>
compensated via the controlling force gradients according<br>
to the invention are cut in half. The result is a<br>
particularly slight deviation of the slats from their<br>
target position. In application of the above-explained<br>
basic principles and in accordance with the invention, the<br>
individual spring devices provide different controlling<br>
forces in such a bridging device comprising cross-members<br>
that are supported so as to slide on both sides, whereby<br>
the respective controlling force of the spring devices<br>
increases or decreases via two opposite controlling force<br>
gradients, in each case from the center of the joint gap in<br>
the direction of its edges - according to the direction of<br>
the tension of the spring units. If the spring devices, at<br>
maximal   joint  width,   have  a  tension  that  acts   in  terms  of  a<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
decrease of the slat distance, the respective controlling<br>
force of the spring devices increases in the direction from<br>
the center of the cross-members to the edges of the joint.<br>
In the event of a tension of the spring devices at maximal<br>
joint width in terms of an increase of the slat distance,<br>
the respective controlling force of the spring devices, in<br>
contrast, decreases in the direction from the center of the<br>
cross-members to the edges of the joint.<br>
If all of the slats or, if applicable, all of the slats<br>
except for one that is centrally placed, are supported on<br>
the cross-members so as to slide, said cross-members can,<br>
in the event of a two-sided sliding positioning of the<br>
cross-members, be positively controlled according to yet<br>
another preferred development of the invention in such a<br>
manner that the center of the cross-members, relating to<br>
the joint center, is constant independent on the current<br>
joint width. Rope controls, for example, are possible here,<br>
such as they are known from the positive control of slats.<br>
Such a positive control of the cross-members is also<br>
advantageous and especially if all of the slats are<br>
supported so as to slide on the cross-members, that is, if<br>
a middle slat is also not rigidly connected with the cross-<br>
members. Meanwhile, it will be possible to do without such<br>
a positive control of the cross-members in most practically<br>
relevant applications. Obviously, the instant invention is<br>
incidentally also suited for application in such bridging<br>
devices, in which the slats and a number of slats,<br>
respectively, in each case comprising different cross-<br>
members that are supported on both sides so as to slide,<br>
are rigidly connected and in which the cross-members thus<br>
shift to a varying degree in the event of a changing joint<br>
width. This is so because the frictional forces between the<br>
cross-members and the superstructure and the abutment,<br>
respectively, that add up in the direction of the control<br>
chain, can also be compensated here with the use of the<br>
invention in terms of a balance of forces.<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
With bridging devices that are designed for extremely large<br>
joint widths (e.g. with 30 or more slats), it may be<br>
advantageous if a part of the slats, for example a portion<br>
between 5% and 15%, is positively controlled in an<br>
intermittent arrangement or is additionally controlled via<br>
another system by means of a spring. Especially every tenth<br>
slat can thus be positively controlled. In turn, the<br>
measures inherently known for the positive control of<br>
slats, such as rope controls, for example, lend themselves<br>
for this purpose.<br>
It was already presented above that the provision of<br>
different controlling forces by the individual spring<br>
devices can be realized under certain conditions by means<br>
of a differently high pretension of the respective spring<br>
units or that the spring devices can have different degrees<br>
of stiffness in that they comprise different spring units<br>
comprising         differently         steep         force-displacement<br>
characteristics. Additional possibilities for providing<br>
spring devices comprising different degrees of stiffness<br>
lie in that the spring devices comprise different amounts<br>
of identical spring units or different spring units, the<br>
spring elements of which (e.g. elastomer blocks) have<br>
different force-displacement characteristics (e.g. by<br>
different measurements or different material selection). If<br>
necessary, the illustrated measures can also be (randomly)<br>
combined with one another.<br>
The maximal total incline of the controlling force effected<br>
by the controlling force gradient depends on a series of<br>
impact variables, such as, in particular, the style of the<br>
bridging device (cross-members supported so as to slide on<br>
one side or on both sides), the amount of slats and the<br>
sliding behavior of the slats on the cross-members. The<br>
total incline thus generally increases with the number of<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
the slats and with the increase of the frictional value of<br>
the sliding support of the slats.<br>
The instant invention can be converted with spring devices<br>
of the most diverse designs. Particularly good results can<br>
thereby be achieved by means of spring devices that<br>
comprise spring elements designed as elastomer springs,<br>
whereby the corresponding elastomer blocks are stressed in<br>
particular on impulse. In this respect, a development of<br>
the invention that is particularly preferable in terms of<br>
overall size and costs is characterized in that the spring<br>
units of two adjacent spring devices are coupled in each<br>
case via a plate that is rigidly connected with the middle<br>
one.of three adjacent slats with both adjacent slats, being<br>
connected to the plate via thrust springs in the form of<br>
elastomer blocks. Preferably, the elastomer blocks are<br>
tension-free in a neutral position of the bridging device<br>
that lies between the minimal and the maximal gap width<br>
(see above).<br>
According to a further aspect of the instant invention, the<br>
spring devices can comprise spring units that are placed in<br>
each case between two adjacent cross-members so as to be<br>
distributed on a number of control bays that are placed in<br>
each case between two mutually adjacent cross-members,<br>
whereby abrupt increases of the controlling force within<br>
the control chain of the individual control bays are offset<br>
to one another in the different control bays. With the use<br>
of identical spring elements, which is advantageous in<br>
consideration of costs, this also allows, in the context of<br>
the entire device, for a smoothing of the controlling force<br>
increases existing within the individual control bays with<br>
the result of a virtually or completely uniform gradient of<br>
the controlling force of the entire device.<br>
For clarification purposes, it is pointed out that in the<br>
context of the instant invention, the controlling force<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
according to the relevant gradient must not necessarily<br>
increase and decrease, respectively, from individual gap to<br>
individual gap. Instead, it is also possible that a number<br>
of mutually adjacent slats form a group in the sense that<br>
the spring devices acting between them are designed for<br>
corresponding controlling forces. The deviations from a<br>
theoretically optimal controlling force characteristic that<br>
is connected therewith is justifiable and is warrantable by<br>
cost savings.<br>
Likewise, only for the purpose of clarification, it is<br>
pointed out that with bridging devices according to the<br>
invention, additional stop-like devices could also be<br>
provided, possibly as supplemental safety measures, which,<br>
in case of a disruption of the normal function prevent the<br>
local opening of individual gaps beyond the admissible<br>
measure. Such devices, however, do not have any effect in<br>
normal operation, because, due to the design of the control<br>
chain that is characteristic for the invention, the at<br>
least largely even distance of the slats and, in<br>
particular, the adherence to individual gap widths within<br>
the admissible range is ensured solely by means of the<br>
control springs.<br>
The instant invention will be explained in more detail<br>
below by means of a preferred exemplary embodiment<br>
illustrated in the drawing.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a vertical section guided  in the region of a<br>
cross-member transversal to      the longitudinal<br>
direction of the joint through   a bridging device<br>
according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 2 shows in a view from below the region of the<br>
bridging device according to Fig. 1 located between<br>
two cross-members and<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
Fig. 3 shows a vertical section through the bridging device<br>
according to Figs. 1 and 2 along the line III-III.<br>
The bridging device 1 for an expansion joint 4 placed<br>
between an abutment 2 and a superstructure 3 reproduced in<br>
the drawing comprises a number of cross-members 5 that-<br>
bridging the joint gap - extend between the superstructure<br>
3 and the abutment 2 and that are supported on the abutment<br>
and on the superstructure. The cross-members 5 are thereby<br>
clamped on the superstructure 3. Meanwhile, provision is<br>
made on the abutment 2 for a sliding support 6 of the<br>
cross-members, said sliding support 6 allowing for a<br>
relative movement (double arrow A) of the cross-members 5<br>
in its longitudinal direction, relating to the abutment 2.<br>
A multitude of slats 7 extending in a longitudinal<br>
direction of the joint (double arrow B) are placed between<br>
the abutment 2 and the superstructure 3 and are supported<br>
so as to slide on the cross-members 5. In view of a bearing<br>
that is safe from being lifted off and in view of a<br>
canting-free position of the slats, each slat is installed<br>
on fasteners 8 that encompass the cross-members 5 and on<br>
which sliding sliding blocks 9, 10 are attached on assigned<br>
sliding surfaces of the cross-members. Those of the sliding<br>
blocks 9, 10 that are placed below the cross-members also<br>
serve for pretensioning the units. The distance of two<br>
mutually adjacent slats 7 to one another is also controlled<br>
by means of spring devices 11 to which the respective slats<br>
are connected. The totality of all spring devices 11 forms<br>
a control chain that extends from the abutment 2 to the<br>
superstructure 3.<br>
To the extent set forth above, the bridging device<br>
according the drawing corresponds to the inherently known<br>
state of the art so that, in this respect, detailed<br>
explanations are not necessary.<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
Each spring device 11 comprises a multitude of spring units<br>
12 that are distributed in longitudinal direction of the<br>
joint B and that are each placed between the cross-members<br>
5. Viewed from the superstructure 3, the two spring units<br>
1212-13.1 and 1212-13.2 are effective between the 12th slat -712<br>
and the 13th slat 713 between the two cross-members 51 and<br>
52. Further spring units of the corresponding spring device<br>
1112-13 are placed between further cross-members.<br>
The spring unit 1212-13.1 comprises a plate 13 that is<br>
rigidly connected with the slat 713 via a bar 14 and a<br>
spring element 1512-13 in the form of an elastomer spring<br>
1612-13. Said elastomer spring is stressed on impulse, for<br>
the purpose of which it is connected with the plate 13 from<br>
below and is fixed to the lower side of the slat 712 at the<br>
top. The spring unit 1212-13.2 comprises a plate 17 that is<br>
accordingly fixedly connected with the slat 712 via a bar<br>
and two spring elements in the form of two elastomer<br>
springs that are stressed on impulse. Viewed over the<br>
entire length of the slats, the spring units are placed as<br>
symmetrically as possible so as to obtain a distribution of<br>
the controlling forces acting between the respective slats<br>
that is free from moments about the vertical axis.<br>
In view of a design of the entire spring system that is as<br>
compact as possible, each of said plates is assigned to two<br>
mutually adjacent spring units. The plate 13 is thus<br>
extended beyond the slat 713 as far as below the slat 714.<br>
The elastomer spring I613-14 that forms the spring element<br>
1513-14 that is connected to the lower side of the slat 714<br>
is also connected therewith.<br>
Substantially the same holds true for the connection of the<br>
control chain to the abutment 2 and to the superstructure 3<br>
as for the connection of two slats among one another. The<br>
spring device llÜ-1 acting between the superstructure 3 and<br>
the adjacent slat 71 comprises in each case a spring unit<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
12Ü-1 between two mutually adjacent cross-members. Said<br>
spring unit 12Ü-1 comprises a plate 18 that is rigidly<br>
connected with the slat 71 via a bar 19 and two spring<br>
elements 15Ü-1 in the form of two elastomer springs I6Ü-1<br>
stressed on impulse. Said elastomer springs I6Ü-1 are fixed<br>
on top on the lower side of a counterplate 20 that is<br>
fixedly connected with the superstructure 3 via a console<br>
21. In the case of the spring device 1126-W acting between<br>
the 2 6th slat 726 and the abutment 2, the spring unit 1226-w<br>
comprises four elastomer springs that are stressed on<br>
impulse.<br>
As is particularly illustrated in Fig. 3, the individual<br>
spring devices 11 provide different controlling forces<br>
according to their arrangement inside the device. That is<br>
to say, the increase of the number of spring elements 15<br>
provided per spring unit 12 from the superstructure 3 in<br>
the direction of the abutment 2, the stiffness of the<br>
spring units 12 increases from the superstructure 3 in the<br>
direction of the abutment 2 so that, as a result, the<br>
respective controlling force of the spring devices 12 has,a<br>
gradient transversal to the longitudinal direction of the<br>
joint. Within the control bay illustrated in Fig. 3, the<br>
controlling force increase from the superstructure 3 in the<br>
direction of the abutment 2 in two jumps, that is, at the<br>
11th slat 711 and at the 20th slat 720. For the<br>
standardization of the controlling force gradient within<br>
the entire device, that is, including the individual<br>
control chains that are placed so as to be distributed<br>
across all of the control bays, the controlling force jumps<br>
in the other control bays are offset to those of the<br>
control bay illustrated in Fig. 3.<br>
The figure shows the bridging device in a nominal position<br>
that lies between the maximally and the minimally<br>
admissible joint width. Fig. 3 illustrates graphically that<br>
the spring units 12 in this nominal position are<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
substantially tension-free so that, in the event of a joint<br>
width assigned to that above the nominal position, the<br>
spring devices 11 have a tension in terms of a decrease of<br>
the slat distance and in the event of a joint width<br>
assigned to that below the nominal position, the spring<br>
devices 11 have a tension in terms of an increase of the<br>
slat distance.<br><br>
