FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to process for preparation of self emulsifying drug delivery systems for active ingredients including drugs and nutritional supplements, cosmeceuticals, and diagnostic agents. In particular, the present invention provides compositions and dosage forms comprising self emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS), self micro emulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) having globule size less than 1000 nm, self nano emulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS) having globule size less than 100 nm and micro emulsions incorporated with the active(s) in solid dosage forms to enhance bioavailability and minimize the fluctuation in bioavailability due to type of food, for poorly soluble (drug showing dissolution rate limited bioavailability) as well as highly water soluble (drug showing permeation rate limited bioavailability) drugs. This invention also relates to self emulsifying tablets (SETs), self micro emulsifying tablets (SMETs®) and self nano emulsifying tablets (SNETs) with a good hardness.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Hydrophobic active ingredients such as progesterone, cyclosporine, itraconazole and glyburide present delivery challenges due to their poor aqueous solubility and slow dissolution rate and thus poor bioavailability, whilst other drug have good bioavailability but their solubility varies depending on the nature of the food e.g. in presence of fatty meal their dissolution rate get increased resulting in improved bioavailability and under influence of normal meal they remains insoluble resulting in poor bioavailability. These types of fluctuations in bioavailability can be well handled by giving the drug in solublized form either as microemulsions or as SEDDS, SMEDDS and SNEDDS.<br>
Several commercial products of these hydrophobic drugs are available based on different technologies so as to enhance their in vivo performance. One approach is size reduction by micronization such as in Prometrium (micronized progesterone) and Micronase (micronized glyburide). Other approaches include size reduction in emulsion formulations such as in Sandimmune (cyclosporine emulsion) and Neoral (cyclosporine<br><br><br>
microemulsion). These approaches suffer from several disadvantages. Micronization/ nanonization present processing and stability challenges as well as dissolution limitations, since the micronized/ nanosized drug still possesses a high degree of crystallinity. Liquid formulations present drug precipitation and packaging challenges mainly due to solvent evaporation. Moreover, non-solid formulations are more prone to chemical instability and capsule-shell incompatibility leading to the possibility of leakage upon storage and even during handling.<br>
For hydrophilic active ingredients, the formulation challenges are different. Although these compounds are readily soluble in the aqueous gastrointestinal environment, they are poorly absorbed due to poor membrane permeability and/or enzymatic degradation. Surfactants and lipophilic additives have been reported to improve membrane permeability; e.g., Y.V. Rama Prasad et.al.in "Evaluation of Oral Formulations of Gentamicin Containing Labrasol in Beagle Dogs" International Journal of Pharmaceutics 268 (2003) 13-21; indicated that bioavailability of such highly hydrophilic drugs can be improved by using some^jo-enhancejrs^Labrasol in this case. These may be given as microemulsions or SMEDDS. Most solid dosage forms of hydrophilic active ingredients exhibit poor or no absorption of the active. Moreover, these non-solid formulations suffer from the disadvantages of chemical instability, leakage and capsule shell incompatibility as discussed above.<br>
In order to eliminate or reduce these problems associated with liquid formulation the present invention is focused on development of SEDDS, SMEDDS or SNEDDS as tablets referred as Self Emulsifying, Micro-Emulsifying, Nano Emulsifying Tablets (SETs, SMETs®, SNETs). These tablets (SETs, SMETs®, SNETs) possess following advantages- they are convenient and easy to handle and more robust, stable dosage; better compliance for patients having allergy to capsule shells or who do not prefer to take capsules. Furthermore, oral administration of peptides is feasible. Also these tablets (SETs, SMETs®, SNETs) have capacity to reduce/ eliminate the localized release of drug and surfactant in the intestinal mucosa which may cause the gastrointestinal mucosal<br><br><br>
damage and may have capacity to release drug faster as compared to its capsule counterpart i.e. SMEDDS.<br>
Tablets are uncoated solid dosage forms that are produced by compression of solid tabletting ingredients between upper and lower punches in definite boundary of die cavity or by molding. Tablets contain not only medicaments but also other excipients (inert) which act as filler, binder, disintegerants, glidants, coloring agents and flavoring agents. These inactive substances do not affect the dosage form therapeutically but affect the mechanical and aesthetic properties which are the most important requirement in the success of dosage form along with its therapeutic value.<br>
Design of tablet dosage form needs powder or granules which have to be compacted in the form of tablet, the resulting tablet should have sufficient strength to maintain its shape during post formulation steps till it is being ingested.<br>
This led us to process self emulsifying tablets, self micro emulsifying tablets and self nano emulsifying tablets with a good hardness which consists of lipid based drug delivery system utilizing anhydrous micro emulsion (SEDDS, SMEDDS &amp; SNEDDS) system and further adsorbed on to solid particulate adsorbent and formulated into solid dosage form. The compositions and dosage forms of the present invention have capacity to improve the bioavailability of a wide range of drugs including drugs that are known or suspected of having poor bioavailability.<br>
Micro emulsions are clear, thermodynamically stable solutions that generally contain water, surfactant, and oil. Micro emulsions differ from emulsions in that the dispersed phase consists of globules less than 100 nm and more particularly about 30-60 nm in diameter. The difference between coarse (macro) emulsions and micro emulsions is not only the size of the globules but also the ease of dispersion. Micro emulsions do not separate on standing where as emulsions will separate.<br><br><br>
SMEDDS are a novel system developed by.-.Gattefosse, based upon specific blends of excipients. SMEDDS comprises of a surfactant, a co surfactant, a_ lipid phase and an active _compound. These systems are custom designed for each active molecule. On dilution, SMEDDS spontaneously convert into optically clear, thermodynamically stable micro emulsions which contain the drug in molecular dispersion. SMEDDS can be filled into hard gelatin capsule and delivered orally.<br>
I US patent 5993858 discloses the method and formulation for increasing the bio availability of poorly water soluble drugs which comprises an emulsion and includes oil or other lipid material, a surfactant, and a hydrophilic co surfactant.<br>
) WOOO 16744 discloses pharmaceutical solution preparation containing prostaglandin El for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, which is prepared into a form of microemulsion preconcentrate (SEDDS formulation). This preparation is prepared by dispersing or dissolving a drug into a liquid mixture of oil, surfactant and co surfactant.<br>
Eutectic-self-nanoemulsified drug delivery systems formulated from polyoxyl 35 castor oil (cremphor), medium chain mono and diglycerides (capmul), essensial oils, and a pharmacologically effective drug was disclosed in US2003147927.<br>
WO03017986 describes the SMEDDS compositions containing Itraconazole with a greatly increased bioavailability and their preparation methods.<br>
^ The nearest prior art to our invention is US patent 6,280,770 entitled "Microemulsions as Solid Dosage Forms for Oral Administration" which discusses the development of tablet from the liquid microemulsion to improve the rate and/ or extent of absorption. The patent further describes in their invention figure- 1 wherein tablet contains core containing emulsion concentrate adsorbed on the powder and an optional compression coated effervescent layer and an enteric coating layer. In figure-2 of the same patent, schematic preparation of a soft tablet consisting of agglomerates of adsorbent containing adsorbed microemulsion which are coated with an enteric material is shown. Whilst in<br>
5<br><br>
detailed description of the invention, the inventors had mentioned in granulation procedure that dry__granulation may be achieved through slugging or chilsonation. But neither have they claimed this point nor they have mentioned at what step the slugging is required. On our trials, the direct compression of mixture of adsorbate and tabletting ^excpients failed to yield structurally strong tablets. Slugging of adsorbate-inert excipients mixture followed by direct compression also fails to yield structurally strong tablets. Slugging at an intermediate stage was the most critical part governing structurally strong tablets. During description of hardness, inventors of the US patent no 6,280,770 have mentioned that tablet hardness is preferably between about 5N and about 5 ON and more preferably between about 5N and 35N. The tablet having hardness up to 50 N which is the upper limit of this range is really a soft tablet and may break during the packaging or even during the shipping. Thus, an easy and suitable method circumventing coating was developed for tabletting which was able to give sufficiently hard tablets having capacity) to withstand the stress during packing and shipping.<br>
Direct compression of adsorbate-inert excipients mixture does not give structurally strong tablets. Slugging at an intermediate stage is the most critical part to yield structurally strong tablets. Our invention starts from the draw back of the earlier prior art which yields tablets with poor hardness utilizing complicated procedures as indicated in figure 1. Our invention relates to adsorbates of SMEDDS with or without disintegerants, made into slugs using slugging and then tabletted through direct compression technique mixed with additives especially hardening agents. This process results in sufficiently hard tablets.<br>
The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical dosage forms of particularly insoluble/ soluble drugs that display poor bioavailability and slow absorption in the gastro intestinal system. The drugs incorporated with SMEDDS adsorbed on the solid particulate adsorbent may further be formulated in to dosage forms either before or after chilsonation.<br>
