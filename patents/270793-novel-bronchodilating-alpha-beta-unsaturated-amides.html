COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
1. TITLE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
NOVEL BRONCHODILATING ALPHA, BETA-UNSATURATED AMIDES<br>
2. APPLICANT:<br>
Name: Respiratorius AB Nationality: Sweden<br>
Address : Magistratsvagen 10, 226 43 LUND, Sweden.<br>
3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION:<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
Field of (lie invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel bronchorclaxing compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, and a method of treating or alleviating conditions accompanied by broncho con strict ion and/or inflammation of the respiratory tract, and/or vasoconstriction, by use of such compounds.<br>
Background<br>
Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) arc diseases affecting the respiratory system, which millions of people suffer from. These diseases are today regarded as inflammatory diseases and the symptoms comprise constriction of the airways. Common treatment of the associated bronchoconstriction involves use of beta-agonists, such as tcrbutalin and formotcrol, and anticholinergics, such as ipratropium bromide and thiotropium bromide.<br>
Hypertension, i.e. high blood pressure, increases the risk of stroke, heart attacks, heart failure and kidney disease. Medications presently used for the treatment of hypertension include the administration of bcta-b lockers, calcium channcl blockers, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II rcccptor antagonists. Vasoconstriction results in an increase in the blood pressure.<br>
The treatments for prevention or reduction of bronchoconstri cion, inflammation, such as inflammation of the respiratory tract, and vasoconstriction are in many ways insufficient and there is a need for alternative treatments.<br>

Further, the term should neither be construed to mean that a condition not might occur, at least to some extent, after such use to prevent said condition. Rather, "prevent/preventing'" is intended to mean that the condition to be prevented, if occurring despite such use, will be less severe than without such use.<br>
The usefulness of the compounds, as defined in the preceding embodiments, in treating, prctrcating, revoking, mitigating, alleviating and'or preventing a condition of the respiratory apparatus characterized by broncho constrict ion, were evaluated in a complex and relevant in vitro model, The in vitro model was in accordance with the in vitro model disclosed in US 2006-0040254 AI and by Skogvall, S., Berglund, M., Da 1 ence-Guzman, M. F,, Svensson, Kr, Jonsson, P., Persson. C. G. A and Sterner, 0„ in Pulmonary Pharmacology and Therapeutics, vol 20:3, 2007, p, 273-280. All refercnccs disclosed herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference.<br>
In short, lung tissue was obtained from patients undergoing lobectomia or pulmectomia due to lung carcinoma. From the bronchus of this tissue were rectangular oblong preparations obtained. The contraction induced by inflammatory mediators, such as Lcukotricnc D4, histamine, prostaglandin D2 or acetylcholine, in the presence and absence of the compound to be evaluated, were compared.<br>
Capsazepine, one of the first reported TRPV1 -antagonists, has been shown to have an cffcct of human airways (Skogvall, S., BcrgJund, M., Da I en cc-Guzman, M. F., Svensson, K., Jonsson, P., Persson, C. G. A and Sterner, O., Pulmonary Pharmacology and Therapeutics, vol 20:3, 2007, p. 273-280), but is also known to posses a range of other biological effects. Consequently capsazepine is not selective towards one target and accordingly its usefulness as a molccular tool has been questioned (Gunthorpc, M. J., Neurpharmacology, 2004, 46, 133).<br>
Aecording to one embodiment, preferred compounds according to any of the embodiments disclosed herein arc those being at least comparably active to Capsazepine, in the in vitro model referred to herein.<br>
Aecording to another embodiment, preferred compounds according to any of the embodiments disclosed herein arc those being at least comparably active to Rcs-4- 95, disclosed in Pulmonary Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics, 2007, 21(1), 125-133 as a potent analogue to Capsazepine, in the in vitro model referred to herein.<br>
Inflammation is closely associated with COPD. New drugs that rcduce pulmonary inflammation by modulation of inflammatory pathways involving inflammatory mediators, such as lcukotricnc B4 (LTB4) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), is believed to provide effective and disease-modifying therapies and is therefore much desired (Friedman et a!, Clinical Cornerstone, 2003, 5, 45-51).<br>
MCP-1 attracts monocytes that can differentiate into macrophages. Macrophages are generally believed to be responsible for the continued protolytic activity in the lungs of COPD-paticnts, as well as driving the inflammatory process in the same by recruitment of neutrophils. The fact that increased levels of various inflammatory mediators, or associated receptors, correlates with the diagnosis of COPD, is indicative of their rclevancc in disease severity and progression. Comparative studies between COPD-paticnts and non-COPD subjects have, for example, shown that the former group has increased levels of MCP-I in the sputum (Traves, L.S. eta!, Thorax, 2002. 57, 590-595). increased mRN A expression of MCP-1 in lung tissue (Tomaki, M. et aL Pulmonary Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics, 2007, 20, 596-605), and increased lipopolysaccharide (TPS) stimulated release of MCP-1 from isolated blood monocytes<br>
(Aldonyte, R. et al, Respiratory Research, 2003, http://respiratory- research.com/content/4/1/11).<br>
LTB4 is an araeidonic acid metabolite involved in leukocyte recruitment. LTD4 is a potent chcmoattractant and activator for neutrophils. The LTB4-receptors BLT1 and PPAR are upregulatcd in peripheral lung of COPD patients (Marian, E. et al 2006. 129, 1523-1530). Higher sputum- (Profita, M. et al Allergy, 2005, 60. 13611369) and scrum- (Scgger, J.S. etaU Chest, 1991, 99, 289-291) concentrations of LTB4 is found in COPD-paticnts as compared to healthy controls. Reduction of serum inflammatory mediator levels, including LTB4-levels, by a dietary supplement containing omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, correlated significantly to a clinical improvement in COPD-paticnts (Matsuyama, W. et al, Chest, 2005, 128, 3817-3827).<br>
Accordingly, the anti-inflammatory effect, i.e. the usefulness in treating, prctrcating. revoking, mitigating, alleviating and/or preventing an inflammation, such as an inflammation of the airways, of the compounds, as defined in the embodiments herein, may be assessed in an in vitro human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) model. Further, the anti-inflammatory effect may be compared to the effect of dcxamcthasone, a known potent anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid.<br>
According to one embodiment, preferred compounds according to any of the preceding embodiments arc those being at least comparably active to dexamethaonsc in such an anti-inflammatory in-vitro model.<br>
A mcdicamcnt, e.g. a pharmaceutical composition, as has been dcscribcd herein above may further comprise pharmaceutical^ acceptable carriers, diluents, stabilisers and/or exeipients,<br>
"Pharmaceutically acceptablc" means a carrier, stabiliser, diluent, cxcipicntor other constituents that, at the dosage and concentrations employed, does not cause any unwanted effects in the patients to whom it is administered. Such pharmaceuiically acceptable carriers, stabilisers, dilutents or exeipients arc well-known in the art, and examples of such are for example disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th edition, A.R Gennaro, Ed,, Mack Publishing Company (1990) and handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 3rd edition, A. Kibbc, Ed., Pharmaceutical Press (2000).<br>
A medicament according to embodiments herein maybe administered to a patient in a pharmaccutically effective dose. By "pharmaceutically effective dose" is meant a dose that is sufficient to produce the desired effects in relation to the condition for which it is administered. The exact dose may depend on the activity of the<br>
compound, manner of administration, nature and severity of the disorder and/or disease and the general conditions, such as age and body weight olThe patient,<br>
Aecording to one embodiment, a medicament aecording embodiments herein may be administered id one or in combination with other therapeutic agents, such as anti-asthmatics. These agents may be incorporated as part of the same medicament or may be administered separately. It is well known in the art that a combination of mechanistically unrelated therapeutic agents in the same mcdicamcnt may have beneficial effects in the treatment of conditions or diseases characterized by bronchocon strict ion, as described in, tor example, M.F. Fitzgerald and J.C. Fox, Drug Disco very Today, 2007, 12 (11/12), p. 472-478.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention such other therapeutic agents to be administered in combination with a mcdicamcnt according to embodiments of the invention arc selected from therapeutic agents known to the one skilled in the art to prevent bronchoconstriction or revoke, fully or partly, any present bronchoconstriction. Examples of such agents are, but not limited to, p2-agonists, anticholinergics calcium antagonists, and other agents suitable for the treatment of asthma and/or COPD and related diseases and/or disorders. Preferred agents in this aspect arc p2-agonists and anticholinergics. Furthermore such other therapeutic agents to be administered in combination with the medicament of the invention may also comprise therapeutic agents known to the one skilled in the art to be useful to treat, revoke, mitigate, alleviate or prevent inflammation associated with diseases and disorders of rcspiratoiy tract. Examples of such agents arc corticosteroids.<br>
When a compound according to embodiments disclosed herein is combined with at least another therapeutic agent, such as an anti-asthmatic, in a mcdicamcnt, such as a pharmaceutical composition, a therapeutically effective dose of said medicament may comprise I to 10 times less than the respective established therapeutically effective dose of the components, i.e. a compound according to embodiments disclosed herein and the therapeutic agent, when administered alone for prevention or treatment of the same disease or condition of each. Accordingly, by combining a compound according to the present invention with another therapeutic agent, such as an anti-asthmatic, it may be possible to achieve synergistic effects compared to if only a compound according to the present invention, or the other therapeutic agent, were administrated alone. Furthermore, it may be possible to improve both the underlying cause, e.g. the inflammation, and the clinical signs, e.g. airflow obstruction and exacerbations.<br>
A method to treat, revoke, mitigate, alleviate or prevent bronchoconstriction and/or an inflammatory condition in a mammal, such as a human being, in need thereof, by the administration of a compound or medicament, such as a pharmaceutical composition, according to embodiments disclosed herein may also include the simultaneous or consecutive administration a therapeutic agent, such as an antiasthmatic. In such a method the therapeutically effective dose of said compound, medicament or pharmaceutical composition and said therapeutic agent may comprise 1 to 10 times less than the respective established therapeutically effective dose when administered alone for prevention or treatment of the same disease or condition. The advantageous of such co-ad ministration arc discussed above.<br>
A medicament according to embodiments disclosed herein may be administered through different routes such as, but not limited to, intravenously, intraperitoncaly, intramuscularly, intranasaleously, subcutancously, sublingually, rcctally, orally or through inhalation or insufflation.<br>
Particular suitable formulations of the medicament of the invention are formulations suitable to be taken orally or to be administrated through inhalation or insufflation.<br>
Administration by inhalation or insufflation will allow a high proportion of the delivered dose to reach the site of action, that is, the bronchi and the lung in general. Furthermore the systemic effects may be lower if the mcdicamcnt is administrated through inhalation or insufflation compared toother administration routes.<br>
Inhalation may be by the oral or the nasal route. Conventional pulmonary applicators may be employed, such as pressurized spray containers comprising suitable propel I ants for aerosols and powder spray dcviccs for preparations in form of fine powders. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration by the inhalation or insufflation route are known in the art. The compound may be dissolved in a suitable vehicle or employed as a fine powder, such as a micronized powder of a particle size from about 2 pm to about 20 pm. An indicated daily dose for administration by inhalation may be 10 times and more lower than the corresponding oral dose. Satisfactory doses, preferably metered by using a device capable of metering, or by single doses of predetermined size, may easily be determined by experimentation.<br>
Compounds according to embodiments of the present invention may also be useful in treatment or prevention of hypertension. In the treatment of conditions or diseases characterized by hypertension, by employment of the compounds of the present invention, oral administration is the preferred route of administration.<br>
In addition to their use in therapeutic medicine, compounds according to formula I may also be useful as pharmacological tools in the development and standardisation of in vitro and in vivo test systems for the evaluation of other compounds with similar activity. Furthermore, compounds of formula I may be used as molecular probes to identify and/or locate the target of their action, such as a target within the airways, as well as employed as a diagnostic tool for diagnosis of a disease or condition in vivo, ex vivo or in vitro, or as synthetic precursors to such probes. Molecular probes of formula I may include reactive, labeled, i.e. compounds of formula I wherein one or several of the composing atoms have been enriched with a radioactive or by other means detectable isotope, and fluorescent compounds as well known to the one skilled in the art.<br>

Methods of preparation of final compounds of formula I by coupling of intermediates II and HI (Scheme I)<br>
R1 R3<br><br>
Scheme 1<br><br>
Formation of compounds of formula I, may be accomplished by coupling of II and 111 (wherein depleted "(het)Ar" is represented by aryl or heteroaryl, R corresponds to R5 and RK of formula I, R* corresponds to R6 and R9 of formula I) under standard amide coupling conditions, such as in the presence of N-(3-dimcthylami nop ropy l)-N ethyl-carbodiimidc hydrochloride, 1-hydro xybenzotri azoic hydrate, 4- d imethylaminopyridine and caesium carbonate (see for example Toftered et a I., SYNLETT, 2004, 2517-2520), or, for example, via initial conversion of the acid 111 into the corresponding acid chloride, followed by coupling with II according to standard protocols. The N-acylation of 11 may be accompanied by competing O-acylation when one or both of the substituents R1 and R2 arc hydrogens. Thus, it is preferred to protcct the corresponding phenolic moieties with suitable protective groups, such as methyl, before N-acylation of II, Methyl protective groups may be introduced by treatment with a methyl halide in the presence of a base according to standard procedures, and removed after the N-acylation by treatment with, for example, hydrogen bromide or boron tribromide (Hall et ah, Bioorg. Med. Chem, 2005, 13, 1409-1413). Other aromatic methyl ethers, optionally present in the molecule, are then simultaneously cleaved off.<br>
Methods of preparation of intermediates of formula II (Scheme 2)<br><br><br>
II<br><br>
Scheme 2<br><br>
Examples of two nan-limiting methods for the preparation of intermediates of formula II, by assembly of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring, include pathway A and pathway B.<br>
The synthesis according to pathway A involves a Pictct-Spcngler reaction in which readily available phenylcthylaminc IV is reacted with formaldehyde to yield V, followed by cyclisatiori under acidic conditions (Yokoyama et al., J Org Chem, 1999, 64, 611-617; for a modified procedure allowing eyelisation onto electron poor aromatics see for example Stokker et al., Tetrahedron Lett, 1996, 37, 5453-5456).<br>
The synthesis corresponding to pathway B involves a Pomcrantz-Fritsch reaction under reductive conditions in which readily available benzaldchydcs VI arc reacted with aminoacetales VII (depicted "alkyl" is preferably short alky Is such as ethyl) to yield VII I, followed by cyclisation under acidic and reductive conditions to yield II (see for example: Bobbit et al., J Org Chem. 1965, 30. 2247-2250; Bobbit et al., J Org Chem, 1968, 33, 856-858).<br>
Additional methods for the preparation of intermediates II include, for example, the direct introduction of the substituents R3 and R4 by electrophilic aromatic substitution, such as chlorination by treatment with sulphury I chloride in acetic acid, or bromination as described in Okano et al., Tetrahedron, 2006. 128, 7136-7137.<br>

Intermediates of formula 111 may be prepared from readily available esters IX (depicted "alkyl" is preferably short alkyls such as methyl) by, for example, standard palladium catalyzed Heck-coupling with aryl- and hcteroaryl-halidcs X (depicted X is lodo, bromo or chloro), followed by hydrolysis with, for example, sodium hydroxide in<br><br><br><br>
a mixture of THF and ethanok The suitable reaction conditions, and the type of palladium catalyst employed in the Heck-co up ling, is much dependant on the nature of the substituent R' of IX and to the type of halide in X as well known to the one skilled in the art. For example, for electron-rich aryl- and hcteroaryl-halidcs X, iodo or bromo is preferred over chloro as the halide unless a palladium-catalyst w ilh relatively high activity is employed.<br>
Additional methods for the preparation of intermediates of formula III include standard Knoevenagel condensation between malonic acid XII. and aryl- or heteroaryl aldehydes XIII, followed by decarboxylation (lower part of scheme 3). Furthermore, when aiming for intermediates of formula XI (and then III after hydrolysis, as described above) in which R' ^ H, the Heck reaction may be low yielding bccause of steric hindrance at the terminal position of the double bond of structures such as IX, Instead one may employ the Homer Wads worth Emmons (HWE) reaction, in which a phosphinc oxide of general formula XIV reacts with a heteroaryl ketone of general formula XV (Scheme 4). <br>

General Methods<br>
All materials were obtained from commercial sources, unless not stated otherwise, and were used without further purification unless otherwise noted. DMF was dried over molecular sieves (4A). THF was distilled from sodium and benzophenone. HRMS (ESI) spectra were recorded with a micro mass Q-TOF Micro spectrometer. NMR spectra (in CDCI3, CD30D or DMS0-d6) were recorded on a Bruker DRX 400 or on a Bruker U It rash i eld 400 spectrometer at400MHz.All chemical shifts are in ppm on the delta-scalc (5) relative to TMS using the residual CHCI3 peak in CDC13, or the residual CD2HOD peak in CD30D, or the residual CD3SOCD2H peak in (CD3)2SO as <br><br>
internal standard (7.26, 3.31 or 2.50 ppm respectively relative to TMS) and the fine splitting of the signals as appearing in the recordings (s: singlet, d: doublet, t: triplet, q: quartet, m: multiples br: broad signal). Flash chromatography was performed using 60A 35-70 um Davisil silica gel. TLC analyses were made on Silica Gel 60 F254 (Merck) plates and visualised under a 254/365 nm UV-lamp,<br>

Cryoprcscrvcd PBMC's (SeraCare, # 72001) were thawed, washed with eulture media (RPM1-1640 from Invitrogen, # 61870-036 + 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum from fnvitrogen. # 10082-147 + 100 U/ml penicillin + lOO^ml streptomycin) and tested for viability using Trypan blue (PBMC viability = 96%). Cells were then resuspended to 1 x 106 cells/ml in culture media and 0.5 ml was plated into 24 well culture plates (5 x 105 cells/well) before incubation for 30 minutes at 37°C with 5% C02 prior to addition of a compound of the present invention (10 pM) or dcxamcthasone (1 pM). One hour thereafter, LPS (0.1 pg/rnl, Salmonella abortus eqiti, Sigma, # LI 887) was added and the cells were incubated for another 24h before collection of the cell culture supematants, which were assayed for the prescncc of MCP- 1 and LTB4.<br>
MCP-1 levels were quantified employing a Luminex-based assay according the manufacturer's instructions. Data was collected using a Luminex 100 (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX). Standard curves were generated using a 5-parameter logistic curve fitting equation weighted by 1/y (StarStation V 2.0; Applied Cytometry Systems, Sacramento, CA). F.ach sample reading was interpolated from the appropriate standard curve. Calculated concentrations were mu hip lied by the appropriate dilution factor when ncccssary.<br>
LTB4 levels were quantified by EL ISA follow ing the manufacturer's instructions. Absorb ance readings were detected using a ThermoMax mi crop I ate reader (Molecular Devices). Standard curvcs were generated using a4-paramctcr logistic curve fitting equation (SoftMax Pro 4.7.1; Molecular Devices). Each sample reading was interpolated from the appropriate standard curve. Duplicate interpolated sample values were averaged and standard deviations were calculated. Calculated concentrations were multiplied by the appropriate dilution factor.<br>
