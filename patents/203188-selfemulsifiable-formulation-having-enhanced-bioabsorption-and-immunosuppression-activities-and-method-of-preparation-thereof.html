Complete Specification:<br>
The following specification particularly describes the Invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>

GRANTED<br>

Technical Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a formulation, particularly to a selfemulsifiable formulation for oral administration having enhanced bioabsorption and immunosuppression activities, more particularly it relates to a selfemulsifiable formulation for early delivery of drug, even more particularly it relates to a selfemulsifiable formulation, which will form thermodynamically stable oil in water emulsion preferably in upper part of gastrointestinal tract and facilitate the early delivery of drug, particularly of the immunosuppression agent, still more particularly it relates to a selfemulsifiable formulation not only having the improved bioavailability and bioabsorption but also has improved capability to release the drug in reduced time with reduced toxicity and variability that is inter and intra patient bioabsorption variability. The present invention particularly relates to a selfemulsifiable formulation, which facilitates increased solubility, transport rate, bioavailability and bioabsorption of an agent having immunosuppression activity. Background Art of Invention<br>
The immunosuppression activity of a drug acting as an immunosuppression agent is achieved by inhibiting the growth and differentiation of T-cells. Such immunosuppression agents also have other pharmacological activities like anti¬inflammatory and/or antiparasitic, in particular antiprotozoal, like antimalerial activities. The commonly used immunosuppression agents include cyclosporine. There are many cyclosporines known in the art, like cyclosporine A, cyclosporine B, cyclosporine C, cyclosporine D, cyclosporine E etc. The cyclosporine A is preferably used in the clinical field due to its proven pharmacological activity and clinical indication and effectiveness.<br>
This immunosuppression agent, that is, cyclosporine A has been found useful in various other areas, like in autoimmune diseases, inflammatory conditions, particularly in inflammatory conditions with an aetiology including an autoimmune component like arthritis.<br>
Further, this immunosuppression agent is applicable in rheumatoid arthritis, arthritis chronica, and progredientic and arthritis deformana. Further, this immunosuppression agent is also applicable in rheumatic diseases.<br><br><br>
The immunosuppression therapy using this immunosuppression agent has been proposed or applied in autoimmune hematological disorder, like hemolytic anemia, aplastic anaemia, pure red cell anaemia and idiopathic thrombocytopaenia, systemic lupus erythematosus, dematomyositis, chronic active hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, psoriasis, Steven-Johnson syndrome, idiopathic spure, autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, endocrine opthalmopathy, Graves disease, sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis, primary billiary cirrhosis, juvenile diabetes, like diabetes mellitus Type I, anterior and posterior uveitis, and keratoconjuncativities sicca an vernal keratoconjuncativities, intestinal lung fibrosis, psoriatic arthritis and glomerulonephritis -with or without nephrotic syndrome, like idiopathic nephrotic syndrome or minimal change nephropathy.<br>
Therefore, this immunosuppression agent is widely acceptable immunosuppression agent. This agent is made available in the form of pharmaceutical formulation. The clinical acceptance of such formulations comprising of this immunosuppression agent has suffered due to low solubility and low transport rate and delayed bioavailability and bioabsorption of the immunosuppression agent.<br>
Therefore, in recent past the research has been directed to improve its solubility and transport rate. In addition efforts have been on to improve its early bioavailability, particularly in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract and bioabsorption.<br>
Various formulations, comprising this immunosuppression agent as one of the essential ingredients, have been developed and made available. Although there are many formulations to form microemulsions, but many of them do not have satisfactorily acceptable bioavailability and bioabsorption. The formation of microemulsions of the clinically acceptable particle size that is of less than 200 nm, particularly of less than 100 nm, is one of the desired requirements for the formulation to be clinically acceptable. Therefore, the efforts are still on to develop new formulations, particularly the formulations which will have better bioavailability, particularly in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract and better bioabsorption and at the same time will have better solubility and reduced variability, that is inter and intra patient bioabsorption variability, and form the microemulsions of the clinically acceptable particle size.<br>
The another parameter controlling the applicability of formulations of the immunosuppression agent is its manner of administration. The formulation comprising of the immunosuppression agent, particularly of this immunosuppression agent is generally<br><br>
administered after filling it in a soft or hard shell, known as capsule, or in the form of solution for oral administration. The solution form of formulation of the immunosuppression agent is taken after dilution with flavored milk or fruit juice. The mixing with milk or the juice forms the emulsion, particularly microemulsions of varying particle sizes, generally varying above 100 nm, preferably varying above 150 run. The preferred form of administration of the formulation of this immunosuppression agent is after filling the formulation in a shell, which may be soft or hard shell.<br>
The major problem arises, when the immunosuppression agent or its formulation is administered after filling in a hard or soft-shell. It has been generally observed that, the availability of the immunosuppression agent will depend upon the rupture time of the shell.<br>
The known formulations of the immunosuppression agent, which are made available in the shell, have rupture time of shell varying from 12 minutes to 15 minutes or above. The problem arises due to this longer rupture time, which delays the availability of the immunosuppression agent, which in-turn effects its bioabsorption. The desired rupture time of the shell in order to make the availability of the immunosuppression agent at an early time, preferably in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract is less than 12 minutes, preferably less than 10 minutes. Need of Invention<br>
Therefore, there is a need to have a formulation, particularly a selfemulsifiable formulation for oral administration, which can overcome all or some of the disadvantages and limitations of the prior art, as described herein above and more particularly of a selfemulsifiable formulation, which facilitates increased solubility, transport rate, bioavailability and bioabsorption of the immunosuppression agent.

d)	treatment of the solubilised drug entrapped with oil and combination of surfactants with preservative and antioxidant.<br>
In accordance with the preferred method of the present invention the first step involves dissolution of a selected amount of immunosuppression agent in a selected amount of hydrophilic agent. The concentration of hydrophilic agent is optimized to such a level in the present invention, that it will keep the immunosuppression agent in solubilized form for the shelf life of the formulation. The solubilisation step of the presently disclosed method is followed by entrapping with a selected amount of the lipophilic agent, which acts as a carrier during absorption of the immunosuppression agent in the gastrointestinal tract. The third step of the presently disclosed process for manufacture of presently disclosed formulation involves treatment of oil entrapped solubilised form of drug with a selected amount of combination of the surfactants. The fourth step of the process involves treatment of solubilised drug entrapped with oil and the surfactants with a selected amount of the preservative and antioxidant.<br>
In accordance with one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention the formulation is made available in a shell, preferably soft shell, wherein the said shell essentially comprises of gelatin, glycerin, water and one or more preservatives, like methyl paraben or propyl paraben, and one or more colorants, like iron oxide black or titanium dioxide.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a formulation having presently disclosed composition and prepared in accordance with the preferred method, as described herein above is filled in a shell, preferably in a soft shell, and more preferably in a disintegrating soft gelatin shell, which becomes part of the formulation for oral administration and it cannot be separate entity of the medicament taken by the patient.<br>
However, the present invention is not restricted by making availability of the formulation filled in the presently disclosed shell. It is obvious to those who have knowledge of the art that the presently disclosed formulations can also be administered in the form of a solution or after filling in any of the known shells, which may be soft or hard shell. It is further obvious to those who have knowledge of the art that the presently disclosed shell can also be used for filling any other formulation including similar formulations.<br>
Therefore, in accordance with one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention a disclosure is made of shell essentially comprising gelatin, glycerin, water and one or more preservatives, like methyl paraben or propyl paraben, and one or more colorants, like iron oxide black or titanium dioxide, wherein gelatin is taken in an amount of about 35 to 50% by weight of the shell, glycerin is taken in an amount of about 15 to 30% by weight of the shell, the preservatives, like methyl paraben or propyl paraben are taken in an amount of about 0.2% to about 0.8% by weight of the shell, water is taken in an amount of about 30 to 45% by weight of the shell, and colorants, like iron oxide black or titanium dioxide are taken in an amount of about 0.5% by weight of the shell.<br>
It is obvious from the foregoing description that the advantages of the presently disclosed selfemulsifiable formulations for oral administration, as disclosed and described herein above includes increased solubility, transport rate, bioavailability and bioabsorption of the immunosuppression agent; capability of making early bioavailability of the immunosuppression agent, particularly in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract; capability to meet satisfactorily the clinical requirements; capability to form microemulsions of particle size less than 200 run, preferably less than 100 nm whether administered orally in the form of microemulsions mixed with fruit juice, milk or any aqueous medium, or administered orally after filling in a soft or hard shell; capability to facilitate the availability of the immunosuppression agent, preferably in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract in less than 12 minutes, more preferably in less than 10 minutes by rupturing the shell; reduced inter and intra patient bioabsorption variability; capability<br><br>
to be stored in the tropical countries for a longer time; capability to form thermodynamically stable oil in water microemulsions in-situ, which are stable for more than 24 hrs and also having capability to be administered orally after filling in a soft or hard shell, or in the form of solution.<br>
Formulations in accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention have shown enhanced bioabsorption, bioavailability and immunosuppression activities as a result of entrapping the solubilised immunosuppression agent with the lipophilic agent and subsequent treatment with surfactants, preservatives and antioxidants before being filled into soft-gelatine shell which are capable of rupturing preferably in less than 10 minutes to deliver the formulation in upper part of gastrointestinal tract. The formation of thermodynamically stable oil in water microemulsions in-situ provides enhanced bioavailability and bioabsorption of the immunosuppression agent, which can as a result provide enhanced immunosuppression to be achieved. Experiments<br>
The presently disclosed formulations were prepared in accordance with the preferred method of preparation, as described herein above, and phase diagrams (Figure 1), relative concentrations of various phases, i.e. oil phase, water phase and mixture of surfactants (Figure 2), rupture identification test in dissolution medium by analysing the percent drug content at different time intervals (Figure 3), percent amount of normalised particle size (Figure 4) and mean plasma concentration of the drug (cyclosporine) after administration of the shell (Figure 5) were studied/carried out in case of selected preparations XIII, XIV and XV.<br>
Formulations of experiments I to XIII are not in accordance with the present invention and are for comparison purposes. The scope of the present invention is restricted by the formulations of experiments XIV and XV.<br>
It was observed that all formulations were clear solutions, some formulations were slightly turbid in contact with aqueous media but when subjected to <br><br><br><br>
particle size analysis, passes the microemulsion properties. The formulations were filled in soft gelatin shell of the present invention.<br>
The formulations were prepared having compositions as given in figure 6. For experimental purpose only different combinations of said agents were used. However, the combination of experiments XIII, XIV and XV, particularly of XIV and XV were observed to better and were according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention. These experimental formulations were subjected to microemulsion tests. From these experiments it was observed that presence of labrafac lipophile as lipopholic agent in combination with other selected agents improves the microemulsion quality significantly.<br>
Now referring to accompanying figures, the figure 1 shows the two way plot for cyclosporine microemulsion - phase behaviour. These phases are mixture of surfactants (I), oil phase (II) and water phase (III). Point 1 represents water in oil microemulsion existence, while point 2 represents oil in water microemulsion existence part and point 3 is coarse emulsion part while point 4 is micelle phase. According to this phase diagram, the oil phase (II) contains 10% of cyclosporine-A dissolved in hydrophilic agent and then entrapped in oil. The oil phase (II) concentration increase from 0% along the left-hand margin to 100% as shown by arrow. The concentration of aqueous phase (HI) increase from 0% along the right hand margin to 100% as shown by arrow, while the concentration of surfactants mixture (I) increase from 0% at the base line of the plot to 100% as shown by arrow. The relative portion of oil, surfactants and water phases will suitably lie with the area (2), i.e. microemulsion existence field as shown in the figure 1. All the experiments were carried out in the laboratory at a temperature less than 25°C having relative humidity less than 60%.<br>
The figure 2 shows three way plot for cyclosporine microemulsion. This figure represents the relative concentration of oil phase (II), water phase (III) and mixture of surfactants (I). The point A represents the preferred concentration of microemulsion that is oil phase (II), water phase (III) and surfactant phase (I).<br>
The figure 3 represents the comparative dissolution profile of experiments XIII, XIV, XV and standard experiment for which Sandimmun Neoral was taken as standard. The X-axis represents time in minutes required to rupture the shell as USP-specification for cyclosporine shells. The rupture time was identified by content analysis in the dissolution fluid. The Y-axis represents the percentage of cyclosporine dissolved in<br><br>
dissolution fluid, which was analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).<br>
In view of stringent dissolution test specification of cyclosporine capsule USP in USP/NF 24 that each capsule should rupture within 15 minutes, the presently disclosed formulation of immunosuppression agent, particularly cyclosporine was also subjected to dissolution tests as per USP specifications and tested for rupture test and shell stability test. The soft gelatin shells having following compositions were used in four set of experiments for these studies :-<br><br>
Experiment No.	-►A	B	C	O<br>
Ingredient 4-	|	Composition	<br>
Gelatin	35%	40%	45%	45%<br>
Glycerine	15%	25%	25%	20%<br>
Sorbitol	18.7%	—	—	—<br>
Propyl Paraben	0.04%	0.04%	0.04%	0.04%<br>
Methyl Paraben	0.76%	0.76%	0.76%	0.76%<br>
Colorants	0.5%	0.5%	0.5%	0.5%<br>
Water	30.0%	33.7%	28.7%	33.7%<br>
The soft gelatin shells having above compositions were prepared in accordance to the preferred method of the present invention and were cured at lower humidity and temperature for less than 25°C for sufficient time. The cured shells were subjected to rupture test. The in-vitro dissolution conditions were maintained as follows :-<br><br>
Apparatus	USP Type-II (paddle)<br>
Medium	Water (500 ml)<br>
Rotation per minute (RPM)	50<br>
Temperature of medium	37°C<br>
Time	15 mins<br>
As per USP dissolution test of cyclosporine, it mentions the rupture of the shell<br>
should be within 15 mins. In the present invention, the efforts were taken not only to<br>
comply with the dissolution but also to quantify the rupture time, which gives clear<br>
identification of the rupture. The rupture identification tests have been designed and were<br>
performed in dissolution medium by analysing the percent drug content at different time<br>
intervals, viz. 8, 12 and 15 minutes by HPLC. The percent drug contents for each rupture<br>
time interval are given in figure 3, as described herein above. The percent drug contents in<br>
case of experiments XIII, XIV, XV and standard (Sandimmun Neoral) were observed to<br><br>
be 30, 31.8, 35 and 0 respectively at time interval of 8 mins, and 75, 70.86, 75 and 28.73 respectively at time interval of 12 mins, and 90, 86.83, 95 and 91.01 respectively at time interval of 15 mins. This data clearly shows that the shell of the present invention releases higher amount of the drug as compared to the standard.<br>
The figure 4 represents percent amount of normalised particle size in experiment XV, the best mode of the present invention. The X-axis represents the particle diameter in nm and Y-axis represents the amount of normalised particle size in percent. It is observed from the figure that the mean particle size is less than 100 nm.<br>
The figure 5 represents the mean plasma concentration of cyclosporine after administration of shells of the present invention of experiment XV. The X-axis represents the time in hours and Y-axis represents mean plasma concentration in ng/ml. It is observed from the figure that the mean plasma concentration that is the bioavailability of the drug is more than the standard at the early part of the gastrointestinal tract and having the less variability in the inter and intra patient for the dose response.<br>
The presently disclosed formulation (experiment XV) was subjected to bioequivalence study and the results were compared with the standard - Sandimmun Neoral. The bioequivalence study of formulation of experiment XV, best mode of performing the present invention, was carried out on 24 healthy male subjects using 50 mg of sample of this preparation and the results were compared with 50 mg of sample of Sandimmun Neoral. All the subjects were adult, healthy, non-smoking males. The mean (+S.E.) age and weight for the subjects were 27.42 + 0.97 years and 63.63 + 1.38 kg respectively. Subjects were selected for the participation in the study after providing informed written consent and successfully completing a battery of medically related examinations including medical history, complete physical examination, electrocardiogram and a laboratory profile with hematological, urine and biochemical, tests. Subjects were excluded if they had received any drug that are known to induce the drug-metabolising enzymes within three months of study entry. History of hypersensitivity to any drug was ruled out. In a randomized cross over and comparative study designed, 24 subjects received these two preparations on two occasions with a wash out period of two weeks. Subjects reported to the test facility in the evening before drug administration. No food was permitted for at least 10 hrs before the administration of the drug. Next morning after attending to the morning routine, subjects were made to lie to supine. An indwelling teflon needle was introduced in the left fore arm vein and fasting blood sample was<br><br>
collected. Two shells of either formulations were administered with 240 ml of water. Blood was collected in centrifuge tube containing 0.1 ml of 10% ETDA. Post dose sampling time after drug administration were 0.50, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00, 2.50, 3.00, 3.50, 4.00, 5.00, 6.00, 8.00 10.00, 12.00, 24.00 and 48.00 hrs. Blood samples were centrifuged in cooling centrifuge, maintained at -20°C + 5°C; with appropriate labels, identifying subject numbers, study day and time of blood collection. Fluid intake was controlled and consistent for the first four hours following drug administration as follows : drug was administered with 240 ml of water, 280 ml of a non-caffeine containing soft drink provided 4.0 hrs post dose. Water was allowed ad libitum there after. Standarised breakfast, lunch and dinner were served to the subjects at 4.0, between 7 to 8 hrs and 14 hrs respectively. Emergence of symptoms, if any were noted by the subjects at the end of the study in the symptom check list formed. The subjects were housed in the laboratory for the entire period. It was randomised comparative study with a two way cross over design. Plasma cyclosporine levels were measured by HPLC method. The drug was extracted from plasma and injected on HPLC system. The chromatography was carried out on C18 column using acetonitrile:distilled water in the ratio of 70:30 (v/v) at flow rate of 1.0 ml per min at 80°C. The detection was carried out using a UV-detector. The lowest limit of qualification of the drug from plasma 20 ng/ml.<br>

The AUC(o-t) for standard formulation was 518.35 + 50.15 ng/ml x hr (In AUC(0-t) 6.1406 + 0.1010) and for test formulation, it was 518.71 ± 46.97 ng/ml x hr (In AUC(0-t) 6.1238 + 0.1163).<br>
The AUC(0-oo) for standard formulation was 611.64 + 54.55 ng/ml x hr (In AUC(0-oo) 6.3262 + 0.0897) and for test formulation, it was 597.27 + 50.13 ng/ml x hr (In AUC(0-oo) 6.2847 ±0.1062).<br>
The elimination rate constants for standard and test formulations were 0.140 ± 0.023 hr-1 and 0.168 ± 0.028 hr-1 and elimination half-lives were 7.98 ± 0.97 hrs and 7.34 + 1.44 hrs respectively.<br><br>
In this study, with both the formulations, standard and experiment XV, cyclosporine was detected in plasma in few subjects at 0.50 hrs after ingestion of formulation. Cyclosporine was detected up to 8 hrs in some of the subjects post-dose with both the formulations. Cmax values, time at which they were achieved Tmax were comparable with both the formulations, so also were  When ANOVA was applied with the subjects, period and treatment as variables no significant variation was observed for Tmax, whereas subject parameter was found significant for <br>
The 90% confidence interval for cyclosporine for the  values were 87.26% to 104.34%, 84.10% to 117.23% and 81.76% to 114.60% respectively. For the log-transformed data they were 90.54% to 109.69%, 82.24% to 118.00% and 80.21% to 115.57% respectively. The ratio of the least squares means of the<br>

The above bioequivalence data shows that the trial of composition of formulation of experiment XV has less percentage of Coefficient of Variation (COV) and standard error (SE) than the standard formulation. From this data, it can be concluded that the presently disclosed formulation shows significantly less variability in inter and intra patient dose response than the standard formulation, which is a unique characteristic<br><br><br>
required for the formulation, particularly for the cyclosporine formulation microemulsions. From the above bioequivalence data, one another advantage of the presently disclosed formulation which is apparent, is that the soft gelatin shell having very low rupture time, that is, about 8 mins, will give fast release of the drug out of the formulation for the immediate bioavailability of the drug, that is, of the immunosuppression agent, that is, of the cyclosporine, i.e. 22.8 ng/ml in 30 mins as against standard formulation i.e. 19.1 ng/ml.<br><br>
