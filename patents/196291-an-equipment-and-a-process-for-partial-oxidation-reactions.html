				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to equipment for carrying out partial oxidation by means of a suitable catalyst.<br>
In particular this equipment can be used for producing synthesis gas by the partial oxidation of natural gas in the presence of oxygen and/or air by the reaction<br><br>
On an industrial scale, the partial oxidation of natural gas is carried out with two types of technolo¬gical solutions.<br>
In the first type of technological solution non-catalytic reactors are used in which the reaction gases are mixed in a water-cooled burner and react in a combustion chamber (T=1300-1500°C) lined with refracto¬ry materials. In this process the partial oxidation reactions (OP) (1) compete with the following total oxidation reactions (2) and with the cracking reactions<br><br>
(3):<br><br>
In addition, the sub-stoichiometric combustion reactions cause radicalic dehydrogenation reactions of the molecules with two or more carbon atoms and the formation of ethylene and/or acetylene compounds. These in turn can be precursors of carbonaceous residues.<br>
The reaction products enter at 1400 ° C into an exchanger whose design and functioning are complicated by the combination of factors relating to the high temperature and presence of carbonaceous residues. To eliminate the carbonaceous residues from the products the synthesis gas is washed with water.<br>
The selectivity and conversions depend on various factors among which the most important are:<br>
-	design of the burner;<br>
-	the ratio O^/C (oxygen moles/carbon atom moles) in the mixture of the reagents;<br>
-	reduced residence time inside the reactor;<br>
-	the rapid cooling of the reaction products which at<br>
intermediate temperatures (700-400°C) can recombine<br>
to reform methane and H2O by means of the reaction<br><br>
In the second type of technological solution<br><br>
autothermal catalytic reactors are used.<br>
In this process the streams of the preheated reagents are mixed at 500-650°C in a burner situated at the inlet of the reactor, generating a turbulent flame which spreads to a combustion chamber situated between the burner and an underlying catalytic bed.<br>
The sub-stoichiometric combustion reactions use up part of the natural gas and produce mixtures of carbon monoxides and steam as well as the heat necessary for the following reforming strongly endothermic reactions of steam (5) and CO^ (6) :<br>
CH^ + HjO	&gt; CO + SHj (5)<br>
CH^ + COj	&gt; 2C0 + 2H2 (6)<br>
The latter take place in a catalytic bed beneath the combustion chamber filled with a catalyst based on Ni (15-30% by weight deposited on spinels of aluminium and magnesium oxides with a high thermal resistance) . These reactors operate at a GHSV which is typically between 5000-10000 NL/{Lcat x h) and in any case not higher than 15000 NL/(Lcat x h).<br>
As already mentioned, in the case of non-catalytic processes the synthesis gas produced must be purified by washing with water. In autothermal reactors on the other hand the unsaturated molecules and carbonaceous residues are decomposed in the catalytic bed making the<br><br>
washing of the gas useless; also the temperatures leaving the reactor are lower (typically 950°C). These characteristics simplify the characteristics of the exchangers for the thermal recovery of the gas leaving the reactor and improve the thermal efficiency of the process.<br>
Several patent applications have recently been published CWO-95/18062; EP-576096; EP-629578) which claim catalytic processes carried out at a high temper¬ature (T&gt;950""C) and also high pressure (P=l-150 Bars) in tubular reactors with a GHSV of between 20,000 and 20,000,000 KL/(Lcat x h).<br>
In experiments carried out in our laboratories it has been found that the conditions of high temperature and high pressure claimed in these patents are diffi¬cult to apply at pressures greater than 10 atm and temperatures higher than 950°C as, under the fluid-dy¬namic conditions described, the mixtures of the re¬agents and products ignite in gaseous phase causing the total combustion of the hydrocarbons with losses in selectivity towards CO and H2 and the formation of carbon black which rapidly blocks the catalytic bed.<br>
In a recent patent application of the same appli¬cant (EP-64 0559J integrated processes of catalytic partial oxidation are claimed for the production of CO<br><br>
and Hj and the synthesis of methanol, dimethylether and FT, in which formaldehyde is also produced, carried out at temperatures of between 300 and 950"C, pressures of between 1 and 40 atms and a GHSV of between 20,000 and 1,500,000 NL/(L cat x h).<br>
Also in this process, in which the operating conditions are less drastic than the three patents cited above, from which it also differs in the possi¬bility of carrying out the reactions with O^/CH^ ratios &gt; 0.5 (v/v), the process conditions are difficult to apply for the same reasons specified above when the pressures exceed 15 atms.<br>
A catalytic reactor has now been found which improves the quality of the process claimed in the above application of the same applicant, capable of carrying out partial oxidation reactions which, apart from having considerably reduced dimensions with respect to those used in commercial processes, does not require the presence of a burner and enables partial oxidation catalytic reactions to be carried out main¬taining the mixtures of reagents at rates higher than flame speed and avoiding drops in pressure due to expansion of the gaseous reaction mixture.<br>
The equipment which is the main object of the present invention, is characterized in that it compris-<br><br>
es four operating zones: a feeding zone (A);<br>
a distribution zone (B) with a constant or de-Creasing section along the axis of the equipment in the direction of the gas propagation; a reaction zone (C) , consisting of a catalytic bed, with an increasing section along the axis of the equipment in the direction of the gas propaga¬tion, communicating with said distribution zone by means of a common transversal section; a gas expansion zone (D).<br>
The distribution zone (B) is preferably in the form of a cylindrical, truncated-conical or truncated-pyramidal solid, consisting of one or more parts of said solid, optionally substituted by their external or internal envelope curved surface, wherein the angle (a) of the generatrix with the vertical, parallel to said axis, is between 0 and 65°, more preferably between 10 and 45°.<br>
The reaction zone (C) is preferably in the form of a truncated-conical or truncated-pyramidal solid, consisting of one or more parts of said solid, option¬ally substituted by their external or internal envelope curve surface, wherein the angle (j3) of the generatrix with the vertical parallel to said axis is between 5<br><br>
and 65°, more preferably between 10 and 45°.<br>
The functions of the distribution zone are the following:<br>
-	to act as propagation barrier of the radicalic<br>
reactions towards the feeding inlet, both by<br>
acceleration of the fluid and by the presence of<br>
inert surfaces, capable of capturing the radicals;<br>
to distribute the fluid uniformly on the trans¬<br>
versal section common to the two distribution and<br>
reaction zones.<br>
The functions of the reaction zone are:<br>
to activate the reaction in the section where<br>
there is the highest gas velocity;<br>
-	to follow the expansion of the fluid due to an<br>
increase in the number of moles and temperature<br>
without the inconveniences caused by high losses<br>
in the charge;<br>
maintain a surface rate in the whole bed higher than the critical value which causes the produc¬tion of flame and carbon black.<br>
The fluid-dynamic conditions inside the reaction zone must be such as to avoid overheating of the reaction mixture but also drops in pressure in the direction of the gas propagation. The drop in pressure is caused by the rapid increase in the volume of the<br><br>
gaseous mixture in correspondence with the necKing inside the catalytic zone. The stagnation of the reagent mixture upstream of the necking causes its overheating and ignition and must therefore be avoided. The variation in the diameter of the reaction gone and the consequent decrease in the gas velocity reduces the effect of the drop in pressure. A differential filling of the catalytic bed with particles with an increasing diameter along the gas propagation direction contributes to reducing the drop in pressure.<br>
The equipment of the present invention can have cooling systems both in the feeding zone and/or in the post-reaction zone and in the distribution and/or reaction zone.<br>
The partial oxidation process with the catalytic autothermal reactor described above, which forms a second object of the present invention, basically :;onsists in the following steps:<br>
premixing and, upon activation, preheating to temperatures of between 2 00 and 600"C, below flammability values, the reagents consisting of natural gas, oxygen or air or air enriched vith oxygen, optionally steam and/or CO2, so that the surface velocity of the reaction gases is main¬tained above the flame speed and the temperature<br><br>
of the reagent mixture in the zone preceding the catalytic bed is below its fiammability tempera¬ture ;<br>
reacting by interaction of the catalysts the mixture of reagents in the reaction zone, the reaction being activated at temperatures of between 200 and 600°C and carried out at space velocities of between 10,000 and 10,000,000 Nl reagents/L cat x h, more preferably between 100,000 and 5,000,000, reaching temperatures of between 700 and 1350°C.<br>
The limits of the first step are necessary for avoiding the creation of uncontrolled combustion phenomena in gaseous homogeneous phase in the zone preceding or inside the catalytic bed. These reactions reduce the selectivity towards the production of synthesis gases, cause the formation of carbonaceous residues which deactivate the catalyst and when there Ls nitrogen in the reagent mixture, they also cause the formation of nitrogen oxides (NOx) .<br>
The preferred ratios between the reagents in the reaction mixture consisting of natural gas, air or air snriched with oxygen, possibly steam and/or COx, are the following:<br>
ratio between steam moles/moles of hydrocarbon<br><br>
carbon atoms (steam/C) of between 0 and 3.5, more preferably between 0,1 and 1.5; -ratio molecular oxygen moles/moles of hydrocarbon carbon atoms {O2/C) of between 0.15 and 0-7, more preferably between 0.4 and 0.6.<br>
The use of these space velocities allows very low quantities of catalyst to be consumed and high productivities to be obtained which easily exceed values of about 200,000 m^ CO + H2/day x kg catalyst, i.e. twice as higher than those obtained with the known processes for the production of synthesis gases.<br>
The distribution zone of the equipment is filled with foamy monolitiis and/or particles of ceramic material. The porous ceramic material is selected from a-Al203, Al^Mgj,02, ZrO; and SiC.<br>
The presence of steam and CO2 as well as other molecules more chemically inert, such as nitrogen, changes the flammibility point of the gaseous reagent mixtures, enabling the geometry to be varied in the reaction zone and higher pressures to be applied with lower surface velocities.<br>
In the reactor adopted in the process, catalysts are preferably used in which one<br>
or more noble metals (Rh, Ru, Ir, Pd, Pt, etc.) and/or Ni are deposited on a carrier<br>
consisting of a material capable of supporting considerable thermal and mechanical<br>
stress (typically SiC, Mg^AlyO^, a-Al203, ZTOJ, yttrium stabilized with zirconium).<br>
The catalysts are prepared by ancho-ring the noble metals (preferably Rh, Ru, Ir)<br>
and/or Ni	<br><br>
in percentages of between 0.05 and 15% by weight, preferably between 0.1 and 5% by weight, onto the carriers. This operation is carried out with three methods.<br>
A first method is carried out by solid-liquid reactions, by interaction between the carriers dis¬persed in an organic solvent and solutions of clusters of noble metals (such as Rh^(C0),2" ^^(,i"^^)^6" R"-isCCO),^, IrJCO),^;<br>
A second method is carried out by impregnation of the solid carriers with water solutions of inorganic salts of noble metals (such as RhCl;, Rh (NOj) 3. xH^O, RuCNO) (N03)3.XH20, NiNOj.xH^O).<br>
The method which comprises the use of small carbonyl clusters of noble metals enables the produc¬tion of particularly active catalysts, capable of activating partial oxidation reactions at lower temper¬atures (typically 250°C). The method comprising the use of inorganic salts of noble metals leads to the production of catalytic materials capable of activating combustion reactions only at temperatures higher than 350°C. In both cases however the activating tempera¬tures are much lower than those used in the burners of non-catalytic reactors or catalytic autothermal reac¬tors.<br><br>
A third method for preparing the catalysts in¬volves the synthesis of an intermediate of the hydro-talcite type,  described  in patent application IT-Mi95A00184, represented with the formula:<br>
[Rh^RUt,X^Y^(0H)2]^"CA"\,J .mHjO   wherein X is a bivalent or monovalent metal cation Y is a trivalent or tetravalent metal cation 0 
0 
The bivalent metal cation X is preferably selected from Mg, Ni, Co, Zn, Fe, Mn, Cu, Ca and Cd. The monova¬lent metal cation X is preferably lithium. The triva¬lent metal cation Y is preferably selected from Al, Ga, Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, Cr, V, Ti and In. The tetravalent metal cation Y is preferably titanium.<br>
The hydrotalcite intermediate is subjected to a<br><br>
thermal treatment at temperatures higher than 700°C before being used in the catalytic reactions.<br>
The preparation of the hydrotalcits material described above can be carried out as described in "Catalysis Today", 11, 173 (1991) (F.Cavani, F.Trifirb and A.Vaccari) and in "Expanded Clays and Other Micro-porous Solids", (A de Roy, C.Forano, K.El Malki and J.P.Besse) Ed., M.L.Occelli and H.E.Robson, Vol- 2, Reinhold, New York, 1992, page 108).<br>
In particular the hydrotalcite catalytic materials can be prepared using a water solution containing in suitable proportions the salts of rhodium and/or ruthenium, a bivalent or monovalent element and another trivalent or also tetravalent element. This solution is added under vigorous stirring and at a temperature of between 30 and 90" C, and preferably between 50 and ycc, to a solution of alkaline carbonate or bicarbon¬ate, care being taken, also by the additional addition of acids or bases, that the pH be maintained during the precipitation at a constant value within the range of 7-12 and preferably 8-11. In this way there is the contemporaneous precipitation of all the elements and their fine interdispersion. The crystalline precipitate formed is separated and washed with water, preferably hot, until there is a content of alkaline expressed as<br><br>
oxide of less than 0.1%. The precipitate is subsequent¬ly dried at 100°C and calcined in air or nitrogen at a temperature of between 200 and 1100°C, preferably between 350 and SSCC.<br>
f	To come back to the composition of the catalysts<br>
both rhodium and ruthenium can be used contemporaneous¬ly or rhodium and nickel, the rhodium being used in a first layer of the catalytic bed and the ruthenium or nickel in a second layer of the bed underneath the first.<br>
In this case the catalytic bed containing rhodium is preferably between 20 and 35% by volume of the whole catalytic bed.<br>
With this configuration, it is possible to reduce, if necessary owing to lack of availability and/or high costs, the use of rhodium in the whole catalytic bed, by completely substituting it with ruthenium or with nickel and using compositions of the charge and reac¬tion conditions which are less favourable to cracking reactions of the hydrocarbons.<br>
With respect to the catalytic bed, it is advisable to fill this with catalyst having an increasing average particle diameter along the direction of the gas propagation so as to increase the vacuum degree and<br>
"    reduce losses of the charge.<br><br>
A particular advantage of the catalytic reactor described above and consequently of the processes in which it is used, consists in enabling the production of synthesis gases using mixtures containing air or air enriched with oxygen reducing the formation of NO^^.<br>
This surprising advantage allows the partial oxidation catalytic reactor to be used both for the production of CO and H^ for chemical use and for the generation of electric energy with gas turbines thus avoiding polluting effects due to the production of NO^.<br>
At present pollution due to the production of NO^^ is reduced by the use of selective reduction processes in the presence of ammonia whose chemistry is syntheti¬cally represented by the equation:<br>
NH3 + NO^	&gt; Nj + HjO  (7)<br>
An embodiment of the invention is provided with the help of fig. 1, but this should not be considered as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
The equipment consists of a first feeding zone (A) , followed by a distribution zone (B) , with a decreasing section, in the fomti of a truncated cone, having the a angle of the generatrix with the vertical equal to 25°, followed by a reaction zone (C),having the circle-shaped section (1) in common with the previous zone, with an increasing section, in the form<br><br>
Df a truncated cone, having the 0 angle of the generat¬rix with the vertical equal to 3 5°, followed by an sxpansion zone (D) consisting of a honeycomb carrier (2) and a wider chamber.<br>
The fallowing examples provide a better illustra¬tion of both the catalytic reactor and the process :;laimed. Example 1 - Comparative<br>
Refractory alumina cylinders shaped so as to be ible to contain a conventional cylindrical catalytic DBd (diameter 15 mm, height 20 mm, weight 1 g) are Introduced into a cylindrical steel reactor having a :hickness of 1 cm and an internal diameter of 5 cm. The catalyst was obtained using as carrier a foamy ceramic nonolith in a-Al^Oj with a porosity of 30 pores per inch ;ppi), containing 3% by weight of Ru. The noble metal jas deposited by dripping a water solution of iu(NO) (NO3) .xHjO onto the monolith; the monolith was subsequently calcined for 4 h at a temperature of 550°C, to decompose the ruthenium salts. The metal of :he carrier was subjected to thermal treatment in an itmosphere of H^/N^ = 1/1 (v/v) at 600°C for 8 hCJurs jefore the beginning of the catalytic test.<br>
The test was carried out at a pressure of 6 atm,, iir cooling helped to maintain the temperature of the<br><br>
reagents at the inlet at less than 300°C. A series of thermocouples, inserted in two sheaths, the internal one made of steel and the external one of quartz, situated along the longitudinal section of the reactor, enabled the temperature to be monitored in different positions and in particular at the inlet and outlet of the catalytic bed (at 5 and 9 mm therefrom respective¬ly) . The mixture of outgoing products is cooled with a ceramic water exchanger. The duration of the catalytic test was 100 h. In this test the feeding (1000 Nl/h) consisted of a mixture of CH^, 0^ and H^O in a ratio of 2/1/1.<br>
The operating conditions and results are summa¬rized in table 1.<br>
At pressures higher than 8.5 atms. the cylindrical reactor no longer enabled the operating parameters to be correctly handled owing to the uncontrolled forma¬tion of flame reactions and an increase in the loss values of the charge. Examples 2-5<br>
Refractory alumina cylinders shaped so as to be able to form a gas distribution zone and an sandglass-shaped catalytic bed as schematized in fig. 2, are introduced into a cylindrical steel reactor having a thickness of 1 cm and an internal diameter of 5 cm.<br><br>
The equipment consists of:<br>
a first feeding zone (A) into which the reagents are charged, equipped with a cooling system using a suitable fluid (F);<br>
a distribution zone (B), with a decreasing sec¬tion, in the form of a truncated cone, having the a angle of the generatrix with the vertical equal to 20° on the outside of which is a cooling system;<br>
a reaction zone (C), having the circle-shaped section (1) in common with the previous zone, with an increasing section, in the form of a truncated cone, having the ,S angle of the generatrix with the vertical equal to 3 0°, on the outside of which is a cooling system;<br>
a post-reaction zone consisting of a honeycomb carrier (2) and a wider chamber equipped with a cooling system.<br>
The distribution system of the reagent mixture was obtained using alumina spherical particles (d = 1.5-2 mm), calcined for 4 h at 1020°C. The distributor has a diameter at the inlet (rj) of 15 mm, a diameter at the outlet (r^) of 5 mm and a length (L) of 20 mm. The catalytic bed (2.45 g) was formed using the same alumina particles used in the distributor, containing<br><br>
0.5% of Rh. The noble metal was deposited on the alumina by contact with a solution of 1^1^(00)^2 ^" n-hexane. After drying the catalyst was charged into the reactor and used in reaction without any activation treatment. The dimensions of the reaction zone are the following:<br>
r,- = 5 mm; rf = 25mm; L=20mm.<br>
As a support for the spherical particles of catalyst a porous ceramic monolithic disk was used, with 40 ppi, in alumina (diameter 40 mm and thickness 20 ram) .<br>
The test was carried out at a pressure of 10 atms. The thermocouples for monitoring the temperature at the inlet and outlet of the catalytic bed were positioned at a distance of 25 and 27 mm respectively. The dura¬tion of the catalytic test was 20 h. The pressure loss was equal to about 0.2 atms. In these examples CH^ and Oj were fed with volumetric ratios CK^/O^ varying from 2.4 to 6. During the catalytic tests the temperature of the gas at the inlet of the distribution zone was maintained at between 250 and SOCC.<br>
The results obtained are shown in table 2. Example 6<br>
The same experimental conditions were applied as in examples 2-5 with the same catalyst, but feeding in<br><br>
addition to CH4 and O2, also CO2 in the ratio of 8:^:1.<br>
The results obtained are shown in table 2. Examples 7-9<br>
In this case the distribution zone has a diameter at the inlet (r,-) of 15 mm, a diameter at the outlet (r^) of 5 mm and a length (L) of 20 mm, whereas the catalytic reaction zone is characterized by an r, of 5 mm, an r^ of 33mm and a length equal to 30 mm.<br>
The catalyst is obtained using the same alumina spherical particles described in examples 2-6 but vith an increasing diameter of between 1.5 and 5 mm. As a support for the catalyst a porous ceramic monolithic zirconia disk was used (40 ppi), having a diameter of 40 mm and a thickness of 20 mm. The catalytic test was carried out at a pressure of 17 atms. To increase the thermal exchange and reduce the temperatures at the inlet an air-cooling circuit was used consisting of a copper perforated tube, ring-shaped and positioned around the core of the reactor. The thermocouples for monitoring the temperature at the inlet and outlet of the catalytic bed were positioned in both cases at a distance of 25 mm. In example 7 a reagent mixture consisting of CH2, O2 was fed in a ratio of 3:1. In example 9 a reagent mixture consisting of CH,, 0- and CO2 was fed in a ratio of 4:2:1. The remaining experi-<br><br>
mental conditions are the same as in example 1. The operating conditions and results of the catalytic tests described in examples 1, 8 and 9 are schematized in table 3.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
