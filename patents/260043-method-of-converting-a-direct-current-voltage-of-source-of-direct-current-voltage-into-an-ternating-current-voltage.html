The invention relates to a method of converting a direct current voltage of a<br>
source of direct current voltage, more specifically of a photovoltaic source<br>
of direct current voltage, into an alternating current voltage at a frequency.<br>
The document DE 197 32 218 C1 describes a transformerless inverter<br>
circuit arrangement with an inverting buck-boost converter circuit and a<br>
non-inverting converter circuit. Such type inverters are used for coupling<br>
photovoltaic systems. The circuit comprises a direct connection that is<br>
steady in terms of potential, that is, a conductor connection that remains at<br>
a fixed potential. At need, it is possible to use this direction connection as<br>
the neutral of the system between one of the two direct current connection<br>
terminals and one of the alternating current connection terminals and to<br>
couple thereto the negative terminal of the source of direct current for<br>
example, which has the great advantage of avoiding EMC problems. The<br>
circuit is intended to provide a lightweight transformerless inverter of a<br>
small construction that also ensures high personal safety and causes little<br>
EMC problems.<br>
An inverter circuit having a semiconductor bridge, a solar generator and a<br>
switching element mounted between the solar generator and the<br>
semiconductor bridge is known from DE 103 12 921 A1. This circuit<br>
arrangement is configured such that the switching element opens when a<br>
defined direct current voltage of the solar generator is exceeded and the<br>
switching element is switched on when the voltage remains below the<br><br>
generator voltage so that the input voltage range, which is possible for the<br>
inverter circuit or the consumer, is increased. The circuit as configured does<br>
not avoid high-frequency voltages and does not eliminate EMC problems.<br>
The document DE 102 21 592 A1 discloses a transformerless inverter with<br>
a bridge circuit. In this circuit, there are provided two separate electrical<br>
connection paths in each of which there are provided one switch and<br>
rectifier diodes connected in series. They are connected in the forward<br>
direction in the various connection paths. As contrasted with symmetric<br>
clocking, this circuit permits to clearly lower a current ripple in the output<br>
current. The additional free-wheeling diodes allow for ohmic decoupling<br>
between a solar generator and the alternating current voltage connection<br>
terminals. This permits to avoid high-frequency voltage transients at the<br>
connecting lines of the generator and improves EMC behaviour as a result<br>
thereof,<br>
It is moreover known to utilize for transformerless photovoltaic inverters an<br>
H-bridge circuit with fourth semiconductor switches that are alternately<br>
connected in such a manner that, from the direct current voltage applied, an<br>
alternating current voltage is obtained between the branch connections of<br>
the bridge halves. What is more, the switching elements are provided with<br>
symmetric clocking. An upper switch of a bridge half is hereby clocked and<br>
pulse-width modulated at a high clock rate in synchronism with another<br>
lower switch of the other bridge half.<br>
To reduce harmonics of the thus produced alternating current voltage,<br>
reactors are utilized. In order to keep harmonics in the alternating current<br>
voltage low, the reactors must be of quite large dimensions. This solution<br>
results in quite high hysteresis losses in the reactors so that the efficiency<br>
of the circuit is reduced.<br><br>
Further losses also occur because two switching elements are switched on<br>
and off concurrently and because, at free-wheeling state, the current flows<br>
into the direct current voltage intermediate circuit through two free-wheeling<br>
diodes. At free-wheeling state, the direct current voltage in the intermediate<br>
circuit acts as a reverse voltage, which results in an increased current ripple<br>
and in an increased power loss.<br>
In order to reduce these losses, it is known to asymmetrically clock the<br>
bridge. This means that while the upper switches are gated with mains<br>
frequency, the lower switches are gated at the high clock rate. As a result,<br>
at free-wheeling state, the reverse voltage from the intermediate circuit is<br>
eliminated as the current only commutates through a diode and a switch.<br>
This results in a lower current ripple and in reduced losses. This<br>
asymmetric gating however generates high-frequency potential fluctuations<br>
at the terminals of the photovoltaic generator which worsen the EMC<br>
behaviour of the generator.<br>
A provision preventing the drawbacks of the two solutions is shown and<br>
described in the printed document DE 102 21 592 A1. There is hereby<br>
provided that two connection paths are additionally provided between the<br>
outputs of a bridge circuit or of an H-bridge. Four semiconductor<br>
components are located in the connection paths, namely each being<br>
another switching element with an associated driver stage and a diode<br>
connected in series.<br>
Accordingly, the two drawbacks are avoided at the price of a more complex<br>
circuitry due to the much greater number of components which translates<br>
into a less reliable circuit and in increased material cost.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to indicate a method of the generic<br>
type by which high-frequency voltage fractions at the connection terminals<br>
 of the generator are avoided on the one side and which, on the other side,<br><br><br>
allows for simple low-loss circuitry and, as a result thereof, for high<br>
efficiency. It furthermore aims at reducing the material cost and at<br>
increasing reliability.<br>
This object is solved in that the alternating current voltage circuit is<br>
decoupled from the direct current voltage circuit during the free-wheeling<br>
phases by means of a switching element additionally disposed in the direct<br>
current voltage circuit. In accordance with the invention, a free-wheeling<br>
current flows through the inner elements of the bridge in the bridge circuit<br>
so that, thanks to the decoupled state of the two circuits achieved by means<br>
of the additional opened switch, no high-frequency disturbances generated<br>
by clock operations occur in the direct current voltage circuit.<br>
The method of the invention permits to readily avoid high-frequency voltage<br>
fractions at the connection terminals of the direct current voltage<br>
intermediate circuit using therefore but one additional component (as<br>
compared to a simple H-bridge having four switching elements and four<br>
free-wheeling diodes). The complexity of the circuit is reduced over an H-<br>
bridge having additional connection paths (according to DE 102 21 592 A1<br>
with six switching elements and six free-wheeling diodes), as but one<br>
semiconductor switching element with associated gating unit is needed<br>
instead of two additional semiconductor switching elements including gating<br>
units and two additional diodes (overall, only five switching elements with<br>
five free-wheeling diodes). Additional costs and the probability of failure are<br>
minimized as a result thereof.<br>
A gating signal for the additional switching element may moreover be<br>
obtained for a gating circuit without additional expense thanks to the<br>
solution of the invention by logical interconnection of the gating signals of<br>
the lower switching elements of the H-bridge for example.<br><br>
The method of the invention makes it possible to have an asymmetric<br>
operation without high-frequency disturbances, more specifically if,<br>
according to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the bridge<br>
circuit is gated in such a manner that the additional switching element<br>
located in the direct current voltage circuit is clocked in synchronism with a<br>
lower switch of the one bridge half during one half-wave while being<br>
clocked in synchronism with a lower switch of the other bridge half during<br>
the other half wave, Accordingly, the additional switch is clocked<br>
simultaneously with only one single switch.<br>
Asymmetric operation permits to minimize losses and to improve the<br>
efficiency of the circuit. In accordance with this advantageous embodiment,<br>
the method of the invention combines at minimum component expense the<br>
advantages of a simple H-bridge circuit with asymmetric clocking exhibiting<br>
good efficiency with the advantages of a simple H-bridge circuit with<br>
symmetric clocking that avoids high-frequency signals at the terminals of<br>
the generator.<br>
As contrasted with the symmetric clocking, a zero voltage state occurs like<br>
with asymmetric clocking since the voltage at the output terminals of the<br>
inverter are commutated between +U, zero, -U. As a result thereof, the<br>
hysteresis losses in the line reactors are reduced and the partial load<br>
efficiency in particular is improved as well.<br>
If the corresponding switching elements of the bridge circuits are clocked in<br>
the kHz range, the forward losses are less important than the switching<br>
losses so that, thanks to the additional switching element, the efficiency is<br>
almost the same as with the H-bridge with additional connection paths<br>
between the outputs of the bridge circuit.<br>
 Since, as a result of the invention, a voltage at the alternating current<br>
voltage terminals virtually switches back and forth between a positive<br><br>
voltage potential, zero and a negative voltage potential on the one side and<br>
since, on the other side, load can be matched by pulse-width modulated<br>
clocking, it is possible to use the invention in a transformerless photovoltaic<br>
inverter for example.<br>
By providing an anti-parallel diode of the additional switch that does not act<br>
as a free-wheeling diode or that is not engaged, like the lower free-wheeling<br>
diodes of the clocked switches, which are not engaged either in the normal<br>
case, the semiconductors used can be optimized. As a result thereof,<br>
semiconductor components can be used which, although they have<br>
unfavourable diode properties, exhibit good switching properties and low<br>
forward losses. As a result, the latest MOSFET-semiconductor components<br>
can be utilized for the switching elements to be clocked, said components<br>
permitting to further optimize efficiency and reduce cost.<br>
Further developed implementations of the invention are described<br>
hereinafter.<br>
The invention as well as the advantages thereof will be explained with<br>
reference to the drawings. In the drawings:<br>
FIG. 1 shows a circuit arrangement of an inverter in accordance with the<br>
invention<br>
FIG. 2 is a schematic with a current path during a positive half wave<br>
FIG. 3 is a schematic with a current path during a negative half wave<br>
FIG. 4 is a schematic with a current path in the decoupled state.<br>
FIG. 1 shows an inverter 1 of the invention with a solar generator SG or<br>
with a photovoltaic generator. This circuit allows for a method of converting<br>
a direct electric current of a photovoltaic source of direct current into an<br>
alternating current at a frequency of 50 Hz for example.<br><br>
At the input terminals 2 of the inverter 1, a filter capacitor C or storage<br>
capacitor is connected in parallel to the solar generator SG. Together with<br>
the capacitor C, the solar generator SG forms a direct current voltage<br>
intermediate circuit or a DC-circuit. The inverter has an H-bridge 3 with four<br>
semiconductor switching elements V1-V4 and one additional switch V5.<br>
Free-wheeling diodes D1-D5 are connected in parallel to the switching<br>
elements V1-V5. Two reactors L1 and L2 are located at the bridge branch<br>
in the alternating current voltage part,<br>
The upper switching elements V1 and V3 are gated at a mains frequency of<br>
50 Hz for example whereas the lower switching elements V2 and V4 are<br>
provided with a pulse-width modulated clocking at a high clock rate in the<br>
kHz range, for example at 16 kHz.<br>
The additional semiconductor switching element V5, which could more<br>
specifically also be implemented as a MOSFET component, is clocked<br>
together with the lower switching elements V2 and V4 respectively at the<br>
high clock rate of for example 16 kHz. Accordingly, during the one half<br>
wave of the mains voltage in which the switching element V1 is switched<br>
on, the switching element V5 is clocked and pulse-width modulated in<br>
synchronism with the switching element V4, The load current is then built<br>
up through the switching elements V5, V1 and V4. If the semiconductor<br>
switches V5 and V4 provided with a high-frequency clocking are switched<br>
off in synchronism, the load current commutates into a free-wheeling path<br>
consisting of V1 and of the diode D3 that is anti-parallel to VS.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 3, the switching element V5 is clocked and pulse-width<br>
modulated in synchronism with the switching element V2 during the other<br>
half wave of the mains voltage (negative half wave) in which the switching<br>
element V3 is switched on. Then the load current is built up through the<br>
switching elements V5, V3 and V2. If the semiconductor switches V5 and<br>
V2 provided with a high-frequency clocking are switched off in synchronism,<br><br>
the load current commutates to the parallel free-wheeling diode D1 of the<br>
switching element V1, as can be seen from FIG. 4.<br>
As a result thereof, the load circuit is decoupled, in accordance with the<br>
invention, from the terminals of the generator by means of a switching<br>
element V5 disposed in the direct current voltage circuit, high-frequency<br>
voltage components on these connecting lines being avoided as a result<br>
thereof. Accordingly, the switching element V5 serves as an additional<br>
decoupling switch of the one direct current voltage connection terminal with<br>
respect to the alternating current voltage circuit. The other direct current<br>
voltage connection terminal is also decoupled from the alternating current<br>
voltage circuit through a respective one of the switches V2 and V4.<br>
It is thereby important that the voltage be distributed symmetrically to the<br>
switching elements V5 and V2 or V4 respectively. It is therefore preferred to<br>
utilize switching elements or diode elements exhibiting the same properties.<br>
Additionally, this freewheel permits to reduce the current ripple and, as a<br>
result thereof, the hysteresis losses in the line reactors L1 and 12.<br>
This invention readily provides a low-loss, transformerless and cost-<br>
optimized inverter that does not cause high-frequency disturbances to<br>
occur in the direct current voltage circuit.<br><br>
