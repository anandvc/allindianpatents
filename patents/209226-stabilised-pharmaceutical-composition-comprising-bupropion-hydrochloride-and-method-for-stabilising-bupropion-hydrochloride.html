The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising bupropion hydrochloricle and a pharmaceutically acceptable stabiliser mid methods of stabilizing bupropion hydrochloride in a pharmaceutical composition.<br>
Bupropion hydrochloride is a known amtidepressant sold in instant release tablet form under the brand name WELLBUTRINR. (Also see U.S. Patents 3,819,706 and 3,885,046; 1993 Physicians Desk Reference and the Merck Index. Eleventh Edition, Entry No. 1488. Bupropion hydrochloride is also useful as an anticholesterol agent, in suppressing prolacttn secretion, in preventing functional impairment and drowsiness seen upon administration of benzodiazepine, in the treatment or minimal bruin dysfunction, tardive dyskinesia, impaired mental alertness upon ingestion of ethanol and psychosexual dysfunction. While the instant release tablets currently sold are quite suitable for the indicated use, the method of manufacturing these is less than desirable based on cost as well as process conditions .<br>
The object of the present invention is to prevent (inhibit) the degradation of bupropion hydrochloric using stabilizer ingredients, thus allowing the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions such as instant and sustained release tablets and capsules which, from a cost of manufacture and processing standpoint, are much improved over those achievable in the past.<br>
The invention provides a pharmaceutical composition in solid form comprising bupropion hydrochloride and a pharmaceutically acceptable stabiliser in an effective stabilising amount, in which the composition contains at least 80% w/w of undegraded bupropion hydrochloride after storage for 6 weeks at 40째C and. 75% relative humidity, an aqueous solution of the stabiliser in a concentration of 6% W/W having a pH of 0.9 to 4, and the stabiliser being selected from an organic acid, a carboxylic acid, an acid salt of an amino acid and sodium metabisulphite; with the proviso that a sustained release tablet comprising (i) bupropion hydrochloride and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, the amount of hydroxypropyl methylceliulose to the amount of bupropion hydrochloride being from 0.19 : 1 to 1.1 : 1, and (ii) glycine hydrochloride or cysteine hydrochloride, is excluded.<br>
The invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition in solid form comprising bupropion hydrochloride and a pharmaceutically acceptable stabiliser in an effective stabilising amount, in which the composition contains at least 80% wlw of undegraded bupropion hydrochloride after storage for 6 weeks at 50째C and 27% relative humidity, an aqueous solution of the stabiliser in a concentration of 6% wlw having a pH of 0.9 to 4, and the stabiliser being selected from an organic acid, a carboxylic acid other than ascorbic acid and isoascorbic acid, an acid salt of an amino acid and sodium metabisulphite.<br><br>
-2-<br>
The preferred pH of the aqueous solution of the stabilizer is 0.9 to about 2 and most preferably.<br>
Preferably the pharmaceutica! composition according to the present invention contains at least about 90% w/w of undegraded bupropion hydrochloride after storage for 6 weeks under the above conditions and more preferably 95% or even 98%. In an additional aspect, the amount of undegrade bupropion hydrochloride is greater than 80% of its labelled strength, and more preferably greater 'than 90% percent of the labelled strength after one year of storage under the humidity and temperature conditions usually encountered in pharmacies and medicine cabinets ie. room temperature and 35-60% humidity. Thus, when used in a pharmaceutical preparation for example, a tablet will still retain at least 80% of its potency and preferably at least 90% after one year of storage at room temperature (15-25째C (59-77째F)) at 35-60% humidity. For example if the tablet initially contains lOOmg bupropion hydrochloride (labeled amount) at time of preparation, after one year storage at least 80mg of undegraded bupropion hydrochloride will remain in the tablet.<br>
The amount of the stabiliser which may be used with the present invention may vary but preferably is about 2.7% to 27%, most preferably about 5% to 16.2% based on the label strength of bupropion. hydrochloride in the pharmaceutical formulation (composition) in solid form. For example if a formulation contains lOOmg of bupropion hydrochloride it would preferably contain-about 2.7 to 27g of stabilizer.<br>
Stabilizers of use in this invention include organic acids, carboxylic acids, acid salts of amino acids and sodium metabisulphite. Preferably, the acid salts of amino acids are hydrochloride salts such as cysteine hydrochloride, glycine hydrochloride or cystine dihydrochloride. Other, preferred examples ,of stabilisers according to the present invention include: ascorbic acid, malic acid, isoascorbic acid, citric acid and tartaric<br><br>
-3-<br>
acid. L-cysteine hydrochloride and glycine hydrochloride are the most preferred stabilisers.<br>
In the examples the cysteine hydrochloride is in the L form and NF and USP are designations for standards published in the National Formulary and US Pharmacopeia, respectively.<br>
The present invention extends to the use of combinations of stabilisers especially combinations of the aforementioned stabilisers.<br>
The pH of the aqueous solution of the stabilisers may be determined as follows:<br>
The stabiliser is weighed out to provide 3.75 grams thereof, (except for 3.34 grams of L-cystine dihydrochloride) and is then added to 60 grams of distilled water in a glass PyrexR beaker. The resulting mixture is stirred for approximately 5 minutes, using a stir plate and magnetic stir bar. The resulting solution or dispersion is examined using either a Orion Model 701A Ionalyzer^-, or an Accumet pH Meter Model 915. Solutions are stirred with a magnetic stir bar during analysis. Measurements of pH are performed in triplicate and the average thereof is used.<br>
Examples of forms of preferred solid pharmaceutical composition include a tablet or capsule. Such forms are prepared using standard procedures known in the art which involve admixing buproprion hydrochloride and the stabiliser with the tablet or capsule excipients. Such excipients may include, for example, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate and/or corn starch, talc, magnesium stearate and colloidal silicon dioxide. Caplets are tablets generally shaped in the form of capsules. Capsules of this invention are generally prepared by mixing the stabiliser with bupropion hydrochloride and other excipients and placing same in, e.g., a two-part hard gelatin capsule.<br>
Preferably the weight of the inactive ingredients is greater than about 1 lA times that of bupropion hydrochloride but less than about 4 times that of bupropion hydrochloride. The tablets or capsules of this invention generally contain 25mg to 500mg of bupropion hydrochloride and usually contain 50mg, 75mg, lOOmg or 150mg of bupropion hydrochloride.   The amount of bupropion hydrochloride in solid form pharmaceutical<br><br>
-4-<br>
compositions e.g. tablets after storage, may be determined using standard procedures such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).<br>
This invention is also directed to a new and improved method for stabilising the antidepressant bupropion hydrochloride to prevent the degradation thereof by admixing the stabiliser with bupropion hydrochloride. In this way a pharmaceutical composition is produced in which the bupropion hydrochloride is inhibited from degrading thus facilitating the storage of the composition over a prolonged period of time at room temperature i.e. under humidity and temperature conditions usually encountered in pharmacies and in medicine cabinets.<br>
The compositions according to the present invention include those suitable for oral, rectal, topical (including buccal and sublingual) or transdermal administration.<br>
The compositions may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing bupropion hydrochloride and the stabiliser into association with a carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the composistions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing bupropion hydrochloride and the stabiliser into association with a finely divided solid carrier and then, if necessary, shaping the product.<br>
Compositions of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets, tablets or lozenges, each containing a predetermined amount of bupropion hydrochloride and the stabiliser; as a powder or granules including microencapsulated or time-release forms.<br>
A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine, bupropion hydrochloride and the pharmaceutically acceptable stabiliser in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules optionally mixed with a binder, disintegrant, lubricant, inert diluent, surface active agent or dispersing agent. Molded tablets comprising a mixture of the powdered bupropion hydrochloride and the stabiliser with any suitable carrier may be made by molding in a suitable machine.<br><br>
-5-<br>
Compositions suitable for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a conventional carrier such as cocoa butter, hydrogenated fats or hydrogenated fatty carboxylic acids.<br>
Compositions suitable for topical administration in the mouth, for example buccally or sublingually, include lozenges comprising bupropion hydrochloride and the stabiliser in a flavoured basis such as sucrose and acacia or tragacanth, and pastilles comprising the active compound in a basis such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia.<br>
In addition to the aforementioned ingredients, the compositions of this invention may further include one or more accessory ingredient(s) selected as appropriate from diluents, buffers, flavouring agents, binders, disintegrants, surface active agents, thickeners, lubricants, preservatives (including antioxidants) and the like.<br>
The following examples are representative of the invention.<br>
In the examples, cysteine hydrochloride means L-cysteine hydrochloride.<br>

The powder ingredients were weighed out for a 120,000 tablet batch size for the lOOmg potency and a 160,000 tablet batch size for the 75mg potency.<br>
The bupropion hydro chloride, microcystalline cellulose and sodium starch glycolate were sifted through a 30 mesh Russell-Finex sifter.<br>
The sifted ingredients were blended for 15 minutes in a 3 cu. ft. slant-cone blender. The blended ingredients were granulated as follows:<br>
The cysteine hydrochloride was dissolved in 1.28kg of purified water using a Lightnin'R Mixer. This cysteine hydrochloride solution was added to 5.12 kg of SD3A alcohol (anhydrous) and mixed thoroughly using a Lightnin'^- Mixer. The blended ingredients were placed in a 3 cu. ft. Littleford Lodige granulator and ganulated using the cysteine hydrochloride solution. Mixing time was 3 to 5 minutes and chopper time was 3 to 5 minutes. Wetness was checked and additional 80% w/w SD3A alcohol (aqueous) solution was added to achieve appropriate massing.<br>
Clumps of wet granule were broken up by hand.<br>
Granule was dried in a WST-30 Glatt fluid-bed dryer until loss on drying (by Compu-Trac^-, 90째C) of granule was between 1 to 2%. Fluid-bed dryer parameters were set as follows:<br>
Inlet air temperature: 60째C.<br>

-7-<br>
the remainder of the granule for 5 minutes. Magnesium stearate and colloidal silicon dioxide was sifted together through a 30 mesh Russell-Finex sifter and blended in a table-top v-shell blender for 20 minutes. This magnesium stearate/colloidal silicon dioxide blend was then added to the dried granule in the 3 cu. ft. slant-cone blender and blended an additional 5 minutes.<br>
The lubricated granule was compressed on a rotary-type Manesty BetapressR in a controlled humidity environment of less than 30% relative humidity. Tablets were compressed at a compression weight of about 230mg for the lOOmg potency and about 172.6mg for the 75mg potency. Round, 7.8 mm, concave, plain punches were used for the lOOmg potency and round, 7.0 mm, concave, plain punches were used for the 75mg potency.<br>
Tablets were dedusted using a Manesty Tablet Deduster.<br>
A portion of tablets was film-coated using a compu-lab Acella - CotaR film-coater. The aqueous film coat OpadryR Red YS-1-1846 was used for the lOOmg potency and OpadryR Yellow YS-1-2186 for the 75mg potency (supplied by Colocon, Inc. of 415 Moyer Blvd, West Point, PA 19486. The Accela - Cota^- parameters were:<br>
