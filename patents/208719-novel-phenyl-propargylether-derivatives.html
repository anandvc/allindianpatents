In the above definitions -halogen- includes fluoR1ne, chloR1ne, bromine and iodine. The alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl R8dicals may be stR8ight-chain or bR8nched. This applies also to the alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl parts of other alkyl-, alkenyl- or alkynyl-containing groups. Depending upon the number of carbon atoms mentioned, alkyl on its own or as part of another substituent is to be undeR9tood as being, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl and the isomeR9 theR6of, for example isopropyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl or sec-butyl, isopentyl or tert-pentyl. Cycloalkyl is, depending upon the number of carbon atoms mentioned, cyclopropyl, cyclo-butyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl or cyclooctyl.<br>
Depending upon the number of carbon atoms mentioned, alkenyl as a group or as a structuR8l element of other groups is to be undeR9tood as being, for example, ethenyl, aliyl, 1-propenyl, buten-2-yl, buten-3-yl, penten-1-yl, penten-3-yl, hexen-1-yl, 4-methyl-3-pentenyl or 4-methyl-3-hexenyl.<br>

A haloalkyl group may contain one or moR6 (identical or diffeR6nt) halogen atoms, and for example may stand for CHCI2, CH2F, CCI3, CH2CI, CHF2, CF3, CH2CH2Br, C2CI5, CHsBr, CHCIBr, CF3CH2. etc..<br>
The pR6sence of at least one asymmetR1c carbon atom in the compounds of formula I means that the compounds may occur in optically isomeR1c and enantiomeR1c forms. As a R6sult of the pR6sence of a possible aliphatic C=C double bond, geometR1c isomeR1sm may also occur. Formula I is intended to include all those possible isomeR1c forms and mixtuR6s theR6of.<br>

The compounds of formula I are oils or solids at room temperature and are distinguished by valuable microbiocidal properties. They can be used in the agricultural sector or related<br><br>
fields preventatively and curatively in the control of plant-destructive microorganisms. The compounds of formula I according to the invention are distinguished at low rates of concentration not only by outstanding microbiocidal, especially fungicidal, activity but also by being especially well tolerated by plants.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the compounds of formula I have for practical purposes a very advantageous microbiocidal spectrum in the control of phytopathogenic microorganisms, especially fungi. They possess very advantageous curative and preventive properties and are used in the protection of numerous crop plants. With the compounds of formula I it is possible to inhibit or destroy phytopathogenic microorganisms that occur on various crops of useful plants or on parts of such plants (fruit, blossom, leaves, stems, tubers, roots), while parts of the plants which grow later also remain protected, for example, against phytopathogenic fungi.<br>
The novel compounds of formula I prove to be effective against specific genera of the fungus class Fungi imperfecti (e.g. Cercospora), Basidiomycetes (e.g. Puccinia) and Ascomycetes (e.g. Erysiphe and Venturia) and especially against Oomycetes (e.g. Plasmopara, Peronospora, Pythium and Phytophthora). They therefore represent in plant protection a valuable addition to the compositions for controlling phytopathogenic fungi. The compounds of formula I can also be used as dressings for protecting seed (fruit, tubers, grains) and plant cuttings from fungal infections and against phytopathogenic fungi that occur in the soil.<br>
The invention relates also to compositions comprising compounds of formula I as active ingredient, especially plant-protecting compositions, and to the use thereof in the agricultural sector or related fields.<br>
In addition, the present invention includes the preparation of those compositions, wherein the active ingredient is homogeneously mixed with one or more of the substances or groups of substances described herein. Also included is a method of treating plants which is distinguished by the application of the novel compounds of formula I or of the novel compositions.<br><br>
Target crops to be protected within the scope of this invention comprise, for example, the following species of plants: cereals (wheat, barley, rye, oats, rice, maize, sorghum and related species); beet (sugar beet and fodder beet); pomes, stone fruit and soft fruit (apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries); leguminous plants (beans, lentils, peas, soybeans); oil plants (rape, mustard, poppy, olives, sunflowers, coconut, castor oil plants, cocoa beans, groundnuts); cucurbi-taceae (marrows, cucumbers, melons); fibre plants (cotton, flax, hemp, jute); citrus fruit (oranges, lemons, grapefruit, mandarins); vegetables (spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, paprika); lauraceae (avocado, cinnamon, camphor) and plants such as tobacco, nuts, coffee, sugar cane, tea, pepper, vines, hops, bananas and natural rubber plants, and also ornamentals.<br>
The compounds of formula I are normally used in the form of compositions and can be applied to the area or plant to be treated simultaneously or in succession with other active ingredients. Those other active ingredients may be fertilisers, micronutrient donors or other preparations that influence plant growth. It is also possible to use selective herbicides or insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, nematicides, molluscicides or mixtures of several of those preparations, if desired together with further carriers, surfactants or other application-promoting adjuvants customarily employed in formulation technology.<br>

In the above mentioned mixtures, the mixture ratio of the active ingredients is so selected that it reaches optional control of the phytopathogenic microorganism on the host plants. This ratio is in general between 100:1 and 1:100. more preferably between 10:1 and 1:10 of a compound of formula I vis-a-vis the second fungicide. The mixtures may not only comprise one of the listed combinational active ingredients, but may comprise more than one additional active ingredients selected from that specified group, thus forming for example 3-way- or even 4-way-mixtures.<br>
Suitable carriers and surfactants may be solid or liquid and correspond to the substances ordinarily employed in formulation technology, such as e.g. natural or regenerated mineral<br><br>
substances, solvents, dispersants, wetting agents, tackifiers, thickeners, binders or fertilisers. Such carriers and additives are described, for example, in WO 95/30651.<br>
A preferred method of applying a compound of formula I, or an agrochemical composition comprising at least one of those compounds, is application to the foliage (foliar application), the frequency and the rate of application depending upon the risk of infestation by the pathogen in question. The compounds of formula I may also be applied to seed grains (coating) either by impregnating the grains with a liquid formulation of the active ingredient or by coating them with a solid formulation.<br>
The compounds of formula I are used in unmodified form or, preferably, together with the adjuvants conventionally employed in formulation technology, and are for that purpose advantageously formulated in known manner e.g. into emulsifiable concentrates, coatable pastes, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts, granules, and by encapsulation in e.g. polymer substances. As with the nature of the compositions, the methods of application, such as spraying, atomising, dusting, scattering, coating or pouring, are chosen in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing circumstances.<br>
Advantageous rates of application are normally from 1 g to 2 kg of active ingredient (a.i.) per hectare (ha), preferably from 10 g to 1 kg a.i./ha, especially from 25 g to 750 g a.i./ha. When used as seed dressings, rates of from 0.001 g to 1.0 g of active ingredient per kg of seed are advantageously used.<br>
The formulations, i.e. the compositions, preparations or mixtures comprising the com-pound(s) (active ingredient(s)) of formula I and, where appropriate, a solid or liquid adjuvant, are prepared in known manner, e.g. by homogeneously mixing and/or grinding the active ingredient with extenders, e.g. solvents, solid carriers and, where appropriate, surface-active compounds (surfactants).<br>
Further surfactants customarily used in formulation technology will be known to the person skilled in the art or can be found in the relevant technical literature.<br><br>
The agrochemical compositions usually comprise 0.01 to 99 % by weight, preferably 0.1 to 95 % by weight, of a compound of formula I, 99.99 to 1 % by weight, preferably 99.9 to 5 % by weight, of a solid or liquid adjuvant, and 0 to 25 % by weight, preferably 0.1 to 25 % by weight, of a surfactant.<br>
Whereas commercial products will preferably be formulated as concentrates, the end user will normally employ dilute formulations.<br>
The compositions may also comprise further ingredients, such as stabilisers, antifoams, viscosity regulators, binders and tackifiers, as well as fertilisers or other active ingredients for obtaining special effects.<br>
