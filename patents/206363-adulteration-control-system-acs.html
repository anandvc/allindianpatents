5.   A Summary of Invention:<br>
The Invention aims to restrain and identify cases of adulteration and provide information to concerned officials / persons on real time basis by way of continuous intelligent interaction between the Retail Sale Point and the Dispatch Station using convergence of instrumentation, software, hardware telecommunication technologies to achieve the desired results and keep the system functional on real time basis devoid of any human intervention thus eliminating possibility of tampering and manipulations.<br>
Typically, the Gasoline/HSD/LDO all petroleum product selling units are known as Retail Outlets / Gas Stations / Petrol Pumps etc.<br>
The adulteration occurs at these places by way of addition of non-standard fuel to the storage tank, which is later on dispensed through the Dispensing Unit to the vehicles, which come for refueling.<br>
In principle the adulterant has to go through the storage tanks to be sold to the customer. Hence, we propose to control these tanks by way of convergence technologies (Software, Instrumentation, Telecommunication etc.) and by connecting them with the Dispatch Station / Dispatch Location System on real time basis to detect any non-standard product coming from the illegal source.<br>
"ACS" System has 2 (Two) Modules, RO Installation Module and Dispatch Station Module.<br>
RO Module:<br>
RO Module consist of "ACD-R" used for reporting of data to Terminal / Regional Sales Office, data such as inventory, total fuel dispensed, stock updates and any other data required to be collected and compared with the data at the Dispatch Location. Data is logged and transmitted to Dispatch Station Modules using<br><br><br>
"ACD-R" which can use a variety of communication channels including but not limited to GSM, CDMA, TDMA, PSTN, Leased lines, VSAT, RF networks etc.,<br>
Dispatch Station Module:<br>
Dispatch Station Module consists of an "ACD-D". ACD-D is made up of two modules ACD-D Hardware and ACD-D Software used for processing inputs from ACD-R intelligently and sending real time alerts, in case of adulteration detection, logging of data, reconciliation and MIS reports.<br>

The ACD-D Software part consists of software within the server having:<br>
■	Existing Database System.<br>
■	Database interface layer.<br>
■	Local database (ACD-D).<br>
■	Management Information System.<br>
■	Authentication Model.<br>
■	Communication Unit Interface layer.<br>
■	ACD-D Communication hardware unit<br>
The communication modem picks up the data from ACD-R and sends it to the authentication module through which it is routed to the database interface where it intelligently fires the required queries and processes the data after which it communicates to the MIS Module and the Communication Modem for required action. This module is deployed at Dispatch Station for data analysis, data reconciliation and MIS reports. This module has four sub modules;<br>
a)  Communication server.<br><br><br>
b)	MIS (Management information system)<br>
c)	Authentication module<br>
d)	Database interface<br>
Refer to annexed Dispatch Station Module Integration Diagram - Figure No.4.<br>
(a)	Communication Server:<br>
Communication Server installed at Dispatch Station collects data from remote RO's having an ACS system. Communication Server collects data from each RO through the ACS system installed. All alerts are forwarded to respective recipients. By default, the Communication Server is configured for GSM as primary network and PSTN as backup, but can be configured for other wireless networks like CDMA, TDMA, VSAT, RF networks etc.<br>
(b)	MIS (Management Information System):<br>
Following type of analysis, data reconciliation is done using this module, the reports produced by the system include;<br>
■	Tank Inventory<br>
■	Accumulated Grade Totals<br>
■	Tank Delivery<br>
■	Dispenser Total Reconciliation<br>
■	Tank Variance<br>
■	Site Statistics &amp; Summary<br>
■	Site Configuration<br>
■	Tank Reconciliation History<br>
■	Alert Raised<br>
■	Customized reports can be added, if required.<br>
(c)	Authentication Module:<br>
This module permits only authenticate users to logon the system, every data retrieved or collected from the RO module is first authenticated and then it is send for further<br><br>
processing. The modules are responsible for changing the password of ACD-R all across RO randomly.<br>
(d) Database Interface:<br>
This module is responsible for retrieving or collecting the required data from the existing Dispatch Station database server. The data retrieved by the database interface layer is read only data, i.e., no updates or changes are made to the Dispatch Station database.<br>
ACD-D Software:<br>
This document describes the modules in the ACD-D Software; it explains every module and their functionality in brief.<br>
ACD-D is divided in two parts.<br>
1.	ACD-D Software<br>
2.	ACD-D Hardware<br>
ACD-D Software works in synergy with ACD-D Hardware. Every data received from Retail Outlet is collected by ACD-D Hardware, which sends this data for processing to ACD-D Software. This document describes about the ACD-D Software part.<br>
ACD-D Software modules: ACD-D consists of mainly three modules.<br>
1.	ACD-D Client &amp; ACD-D message processor.<br>
2.	Management Information System.<br>
3.	Communication Unit Interface Layer.<br>
1.  ACD-D Client &amp; ACD-D Message Processor:<br>
ACD-D Client provides the way to the user to interact with ACD-D system. Logically client is divided into two modules user authentication &amp; authorization and user interface for activities. The details of each module are given below;<br><br>
User authentication &amp; authorization:<br>
This module will authenticate the user during log on and authorizes the user for the set privileges. The module provides the facility to create the users. As per requirement the privileges of the users can be altered. Log is maintained to keep track of all the users who use the system. In short following functions are taken care by the module.<br>
■	Authenticating and authorizing users<br>
■	Creating and altering users<br>
■	Maintaining log of activities<br>
■	User interface for activities<br>
The various activities that can occur during usage are grouped into two. Activities related to data and activities related to communication.<br>
Client PC is provided with the required data entry screens to maintain the master and transaction data, which includes:<br>
Depot/Terminal details. Personnel data. Product details. Retail Outlet details. ACD-R configuration details. Retail Outlet-wise tank details. Retail Outlet-wise dispensing unit data Retail Outlet configuration data. Retail Outlet-wise dispatches.<br>
Client PC also includes the screens to communicate with Retail Outlets. It is possible to make the request for following details;<br>
■	Current ACD-R configuration<br>
■	Modify ACD-R configuration<br>
■	Current Dispensing Unit reading<br>
■	Current tank reading<br>
■	Request for backup logs<br><br>
ACD-D Message Processor:<br>
This is a background process that doesn't need any user interaction. At Retail Outlets ACD-R are configured to send data messages to terminal / depot. ACD-D Message Processor is responsible for parsing these messages and store in database. The various data messages that need to be parsed are as follows:<br>
■	Fuel addition.<br>
■	Sales Log.<br>
■	Backup Sales Log.<br>
■	DU Log.<br>
■	Backup DU Log.<br>
■	Request Sales Log.<br>
■	Request DU Log.<br>
■	Exception Log.<br>
■	Backup exception Log.<br>
■	Configuration.<br>
The Message Processor keeps on looking for non-conformance against fuel addition message data and invoiced data for the Retail Outlet. On non-conformance, the alert will be generated. Alert will be communicated to concerned person.<br>
To protect the tampering of ACD-R Message Processor will generate the random password. Every week new password will be remotely configured.<br>
In addition to activities mentioned above Message Processor archives the data every day for last seven days safeguarding against loss of data.<br>
In short the Message Processor will carry out following activities:<br>
■	Retail Outlet message data parsing.<br>
■	Non-conformance alert.<br>
■	Archiving log data.<br>
■	New password configuration.<br><br>
2.  Management Information System (MIS):<br>
The data received from each of the RO can be analyzed for different purposes using MIS Module. Data reconciliation is also available for dispensing units. The below mentioned MIS is available in Data report format and different chart format.<br>
Retail Outlet-wise Tank Analysis:<br>
The analysis can be done on tanks / products. This analysis is based on the data collected from the Retail Outlets. If tank data is not available for the particular day due to some unexpected reasons, then the reading for that day will be treated as reading with exceptions, so that the correct analysis can be possible on the available data.<br>
Variance Report - Dispensers vs. Tank:<br>
ACD-D automatically gathers information from the meter readings, deliveries from the dispensing unit and daily sales from the tank. It reconciles the total at the end of the day. Variance report shows sudden losses and short deliveries from the dispensing unit.<br>
Variance Report - Dispatches vs. Receipt:<br>
It is possible to capture information on the dispatches, but the option of integrating with the existing system is also available (as most of the terminals have their own dispatching software). Every dispatches of the product to retail outlet will reply back with the automatic receipt. This report can display any non-conformance, if found in the dispatches and receipt.<br>
Alert raised:<br>
If there is non-conformance in dispatches and receipt, then software will send alert in the form of wireless data messages / e-mail / fax to the configured recipient in the database. Every time the alert is send, it will be logged by the system. This report will help user in tracking, when the alert was raised, to which concerned officer the alert was sent, etc.<br><br>
Exception raised:<br>
Every exceptions like dispensing unit not responding, tank gauging probe not responding or frequent power failure etc., are reported to ACD-D software by the (ACD-R) communication unit installed at Retail Outlet. This expectation data collected can be used for exception analysis.<br>
Retail Outlet details:<br>
If required, it is possible to get the information on the owner name, address, site address, latest stock, numbers of tanks and dispensing unit connected.<br>
Retail Outlet configuration:<br>
This will display the configuration of Communication Unit (ACD-R) installed at the Retail Outlet. Here, user can see the latest configuration and can change it remotely on just pressing of the button.<br>
3.   Communication Unit Interface Layer:<br>
The Communication Unit Interface Layer (CUIL) handles the hardware interfacing with the ACD-D hardware. Advantage of this layer is that it is scalable to cope up with communication traffic; this is possible due to modem pool solution. It is reliable as the system hardware is backed with battery and inverter, which doesn't lead to any data losses. It handles below mention functions.<br>
Receive message from Retail Outlets:<br>
Messages are collected form every Retail Outlet, and are stored in the received message queue; this queue is then processed by ACD-D software. Every message is processed on the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.<br>
Send alerts to personnel:<br>
An alert that has to be sent to concerned personnel will be sent using this feature.<br><br>
Send messages to Retail Outlet:<br>
■	Messages that have to be sent to concerned Retail Outlet will be sent using this feature.<br>
■	Maintain in/out message log with date/time stamp.<br>
■	Every message received and sent is logged with the time stamp as history of data.<br>
■	Modem stack support.<br>
■	Scale up option to cope up with communication traffic.<br>
■	Backup support for PSTN line.<br>
If primary communication link fails, then this layer will automatically shift to backup support of PSTN line. This will help the system to work round the clock.<br>
Configuration of Communication Server User Interface:<br>
This is used to configure the ACD-D hardware. Parameter required for communication between ACD-D software and hardware can be configured using this feature.<br>
Communication log status:<br>
Pending or not communicated message status can be found using this feature.<br>
Overall description of the operations of the system is as described in Figure / Drawing No. 5.<br>
The Figure / Drawing No.5 shows an overview of the Adulteration Control System characterized in that is a Retail Outlet Module, Dispatch Station Module, Sales Offices, the Officers and the alert messages on the field.<br>
The Retail Outlet Module as shown in 1 of Figure No.5 consists of ACD-R connected to the underground tank gauging system and the dispensing units as shown in 1 of Figure No.5.<br><br>
Functioning:<br>
At the time of any input to the underground storage tank, the probes therein records the required information like level, density, temperature etc. and sends it across to the ACD-R device installed in the RO office.<br>
Similarly, when any sales takes place, the sales volume and amount is sent to the ACD-R by the dispensing units via the cables shown in the figure.<br>
ACD-R processes the data further and sends it to the communication modem of the Dispatch Station Module shown as 2 in the Figure No.5.<br>
The Dispatch Station Module shown as 2 in the Figure No.5 consists of ACD-D, Database Interface Module, Authentication Module and MIS Module.<br>
The Dispatch Station Module on receipt of the information from the ACD-R processes it further and seeks from the ERP system of the company verification of the receipt at the RO by way of dispatch details.<br>
If the said quantity of the said quality has been dispatched to the said RO then the system logs the dispatch in its database. However, if there is a mismatch in quantity or quality of the product dispatched and the product received at the Retail Outlet, then an alert by way of SMS / Fax / E-mail is sent to various officers at various sites as shown in 3 of the Figure No.5.<br><br>
