Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to wireless communication field and more particularly to a<br>
method and a device for suppressing narrowband interference.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In a spread spectrum communication system, when narrowband interference falls into a<br>
receive pass-band due to factors such as co-channel or inter-modulation, the unprocessed<br>
interference will deteriorate the normal demodulation performance of all subscribers in the<br>
cell and reduce capacity and coverage of the cell. Narrowband interference with high energy<br>
may even result in congestion in the cell. Moreover, the capacity and coverage of the<br>
neighboring co-channel cells will also be affected. Therefore, how to reduce the influence of<br>
narrowband interference on the limited frequency spectrum resource is a major concern.<br>
In a wideband communication system, such as a Code Division Multiple Access<br>
(CDMA), Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) or Time<br>
Division-Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access (TD-SCDMA) system, the influence<br>
of interference on the system may be reduced greatly and the overall communication quality<br>
and coverage reliability may be maintained by enhancing suppression of narrowband<br>
interference falling into the receive pass-band due to factors such as co-channel or<br>
inter-modulation.<br>
Usually, the characteristics of narrowband interference are difficult to be foreseen and<br>
may vary with time. Accordingly, the influence of interference on the system may be<br>
reduced as far as possible only if the interference is detected and suppressed in real time.<br>
Therefore, in some frequency bands that are not completely cleaned (e.g., that are<br>
unlicensed or shared) as well as in the initial stage after a base station is brought into use and<br>
during the maintenance of the base station, it is of great significance that the system<br>
provides adaptive detection and suppression of in-band narrowband interference.<br>
One of the prior arts related to the present invention is the patent application No.<br>
00803299 filed by C. E. Jagger, which disclosed a notch filtering method and device<br>
inserted in a Radio Frequency (RF) signal path. Detection of interference is carried out by<br>
scanning a pre-segmented analog signal frequency band and a group of notch filters (the<br>
notch part includes a two-stage frequency mixer, a local oscillator, a band-pass filter and an<br>
intermediate frequency notch filter.) are provided to work serially according to the number<br><br><br>
of the detected interference, so as to achieve the suppression of narrowband interference.<br>
Though the above prior art can achieve interference suppression in the analog signal<br>
frequency band at the front end of the receiver and thereby prevent congestion resulted from<br>
extremely high interference, the method and device in the prior art require additional<br>
devices in the radio-frequency circuit, including a number of notch devices. Because the<br>
implementation procedure is complex and costs highly, it is not competitive in the market.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

provide a method and a device for suppressing narrowband interference. The cost of the<br>

Detailed Description of the Embodiments<br>
The present invention is applicable to a digital signal processing part in front of<br>
baseband demodulation of the wideband receiver. In other words, a separate narrowband<br>
interference suppression device is added behind an Analog-Digital Converter (ADC) of the<br>
wideband receiver and in front of a baseband demodulation chip, to process interfered<br>
digital signals, thereby effectively enhancing robustness of the receiver against co-channel<br>
narrowband interference.<br>
The present invention detects the characteristics of interference in a transform domain in<br>
real time, maps the interference detection result into an interference suppression pulse<br>
function according to a unit noise pulse function and accomplishes interference suppression<br>
filtering in the transform domain with the interference suppression pulse function, thereby<br>
enhancing interference resistance capability of the system.<br>
In the diversity reception of signals by the receiver, the method and the device for<br>
suppressing narrowband interference may be applied in each diversity reception link. Figure<br>
1 shows the position where the present invention is applied in two diversity reception links:<br>
a separate narrowband interference suppression device 200 is added behind an ADC<br>
component of a wideband receiver and in front of a baseband demodulation chip. Therefore,<br>
in each receiving link, the present invention is implemented after digital frequency<br>
conversion and before down-sampling and matched filtering, carries out real-time detection<br>
and suppression of in-band narrowband interference in the receive channel and reports<br>
interference frequency point and intensity.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, a specific implementation of the device provided in the present<br>
invention includes an interference detection unit 280 and an interference suppression unit<br>
290.<br>
The interference detection unit 280 segments and weights the data of a digital signal,<br>
then performs a complex Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to obtain the modulus of the<br><br><br>
signal in frequency domain, and then performs filtering on the modulus of the signal in<br>
frequency domain, detects whether there is a narrowband interference, obtains the detection<br>
result, for example, characteristics information including spectrum line, bandwidth and<br>
energy of the interference to be suppressed, to be used for processing by an interference<br>
filter function and reports the information to the Central Processing Unit (CPU) of the<br>
receiver (not shown).<br>
The interference suppression unit 290 synthesizes in real-time an interference filter<br>
function matching the interference according to the interference detection result and<br>
performs overlap-save process on the input data, to implement an adaptive suppression<br>
filtering on interference in DFT domain at different frequency points and energy levels.<br>
Referring to Figure 2 again, the interference detection unit 280 includes a preprocessing<br>
sub-unit 211, a detection transform-domain processing sub-unit 212 and a filtering sub-unit<br>
213.<br>
The preprocessing sub-unit 211 is configured to weight the data of the sampled digital<br>
signal.<br>
The present invention employs a structure in which an interference detection channel<br>
and an interference suppression channel are separated. The interference detection structure<br>
is designed to be flexible. To improve the interference detection effect, various appropriate<br>
weighting methods may be used. For example, the data block x(l,n) in segment l may be<br>
weighted with window function w(n), as shown in formula 1:<br><br>
The shape of the window function may be configured from the outside of the device<br>
provided in the present invention as required. The mainlobe width, sidelobe suppression<br>
capability interference detection and suppression performance of the window function need<br>
to be considered comprehensively when the window function is configured. A typical<br>
window function shape may be weighted with Blackman-Harris window function as shown<br>
in Figure 3, or any other window function with similar characteristics.<br>
The transform-domain processing sub-unit 212 processes the weighted data of the I/Q<br>
digital signal with a transform-domain operator, to obtain a detection result.<br>
For example, the weighted data of the I/Q digital signal may be processed with a DFT<br><br><br>
In the formulas, the DFT-domain coefficient X(l,k) may be obtained through a base-2<br>
complex Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operation and may be implemented through log2N<br>
iterations from a butterfly shape. The logical resource of the butterfly implementation may<br>
be reused excellently, thereby enabling high resource utilization ratio and implementation<br>
efficiency. Of course, the DFT coefficient X(l,k) may also be obtained through other<br>
operations, such as a base-4 complex FFT operation.<br>
The filtering sub-unit 213 is configured to perform smooth filtering on XM(1,K) , to<br>
obtain a stable signal detection result.<br>
During the smooth filtering, different α filters are used to filter in several stages, so as<br>
to attain the smoothing effect. For filtering of the interference detection result, using α<br>
filters is a typical and simple approach. Of course, the smoothing effect may also be<br>
obtained with other low-pass filters. The filtering relationship is shown in Formula 4:<br><br>
In Formula 4, the higher the α value is, the stabler the filtered signals will be, but the<br>
miss alarm time when the interference just appears and the false alarm time after the<br>
interference disappears will be longer due to detection delay. In addition, the higher the<br>
energy of interference is and the shorter the detection time is, the longer the false alarm time<br>
will be. Missed alarms for interference are different and the costs of different missed alarms<br>
are different. Usually, the cost of missed alarms for strong interference is much higher than<br>
the cost of false alarms. Thus, the effect of false alarms and the effect of missed alarms to<br>
the system need to be traded off when determining the α value. Typically, the α value<br>
may be 0.875.<br><br><br>
For intermittent interference pulses or other characteristic rapid-varying interference, to<br>
educe the effect of false alarms and missed alarms, a filter with a lower α value may also<br>
be incorporated to implement parallel filtering. In other words, the output from the filter<br>
with lower α value is used to preferably judge whether the interference is a strong<br>
interference. If α =0, it indicates the detection result of the last data block is directly used<br>
for judgment.<br>
After being processed by the above sub-units, the narrowband interference in different<br>
bandwidths at different energy levels may exhibit stable and detectable characteristics in<br>
DFT domain.<br>
The interference suppression unit 290 includes an interference filter function<br>
synthesizing sub-unit 206, a data segmenting sub-unit 201, a suppression transform-domain<br>
processing sub-unit 202, an interference suppression sub-unit 203, a transform-domain<br>
inverse processing sub-unit 204 and a data consolidation sub-unit 205.<br>
The interference filter function synthesizing sub-unit 206 synthesizes an interference<br>
suppression pulse function NSP(l,k) in real time on the basis of a unit noise pulse function<br>
  according to the information of the reference-corrupted DFT spectrum line and<br>
energy, as shown in Formula 5:<br><br>
In formula 5, is generally an equal-weight coefficient. As the quantity, energy and<br>
bandwidth of the interference vary, the position and magnitude of the DFT spectrum line of<br>
interference provided in the interference detection part vary accordingly; therefore, the<br>
interference suppression pulse function created in real time may match the energy and<br>
bandwidth of the narrowband interference adaptively.<br>
When the interference suppression pulse function is optimized to match the<br>
characteristics of the interference in the transform domain, the best interference suppression<br>
effect in the transform domain may be attained. At this point, the unit noise pulse function is<br>
chosen according to the characteristics of unit noise pulses. For example, smooth pulses<br>
with a certain width are used instead of steep-edge impulses or step pulses, as shown in<br>
Figure 4. The design of a smooth noise pulse function may further improve the interference<br>
suppression effect. Parameter information such as unit noise pulse function may be loaded at<br><br>
the interface and with a default common configuration. The parameter information may also<br>
be loaded at an optimized level according to the prior information of specific interference<br>
characteristics.<br>
The data segmenting sub-unit 201 segments the data of in-phase/quadrate (I/Q) digital<br>
signals sampled by the receiver, each segment of data including N sample points and then<br>
performs overlap-save on the segmented data of the digital signals.<br>
The overlap-save refers to that the adjacent data blocks overlap on each other to a certain<br>
degree when they are segmented. The data segmentation and the proportion of overlap-save<br>
depend on factors such as the transform-domain operation efficiency, the capacity of<br>
implementation devices and the filtering design. Usually, N is an integer power of 2, such as<br>
128, 256, 1024, or 2048, and the overlap percentage may be about 50%.<br>
Of course, in the present invention, not only overlap-save but also overlap-add may be<br>
used for the data segments, so as to further improve the filtering performance after the data<br>
segmentation.<br>
The suppression transform-domain processing sub-unit 202 processes the data of the<br>
digital signals from the data segmenting sub-unit 201 with a transform-domain operator, to<br>
obtain the transform-domain signals processed with the transform-domain operator. The<br>
suppression transform-domain processing sub-unit 202 may process the segmented digital<br>
signals in the same way as the detection transform-domain processing sub-unit 212 or in a<br>
different way from the detection transform-domain processing sub-unit 212. For example,<br>
Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) may be used.<br>
The interference suppression sub-unit 203 retrieves the transform-domain signals<br>
processed with the transform-domain operator from the suppression transform-domain<br>
processing sub-unit 202 and then performs "AND" operation on the interference suppression<br>
pulse function synthesized by the interference filter function synthesizing sub-unit 206 and<br>
the transform-domain signals processed with the transform-domain operator for interference<br>
suppression, as shown in Figure 6, to carry out interference suppression in the transform<br>
domain.<br><br>
The transform-domain inverse processing sub-unit 204 carries out a complex Inverse<br><br>
Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) on the I/Q data, as shown in Figure 7, to restore the<br>
time-domain signals.<br><br>
Here, the butterfly structure for the IDFT is similar to the butterfly structure for the DFT<br>
and may be obtained by sorting the data in reverse order and multiplying the sorted data by a<br>
constant 1/N on the basis of a base-2 complex FFT operation.<br>
The data consolidation sub-unit 205 carries out a processing corresponding to the<br>
overlap-save operation performed by the data segmenting sub-unit 201.<br>
The consolidated digital signals are used for baseband demodulation. Therefore, the<br>
effect of narrowband interference may be reduced greatly and the robustness of the<br>
communication system may be enhanced.<br>
Furthermore, in order to recognize interference and abstract the characteristics such as<br>
DFT spectrum line corrupted by the interference and the intensity and bandwidth of the<br>
interference in real time, the interference detection unit in the device for suppressing<br>
narrowband interference provided in the present invention may further include an<br>
interference recognizing and characteristic extracting sub-unit 214.<br>
The interference recognizing and characteristic extracting sub-unit 214 compares the<br>
filtered XM(l, k) with a threshold function XT(k), to recognize the DFT spectrum line<br>
corrupted by the interference and the bandwidth and intensity of the interference. Some<br>
parameters of the threshold function may be the relative threshold values of the background<br>
noise of the spectrum line without interference signals or may be configured directly.<br>
The spectrum line XM(l, k) exceeding the threshold function is processed, the position<br>
of the interference spectrum line and the energy of the corrupt interference spectrum line are<br>
measured in real time and reported to the CPU of the receiver.<br>
The present invention provides optional system enhancement functions to base station<br>
receivers. The present invention may be configured in two modes by parameter setting: 1)<br>
monitor mode: the real-time narrowband interference detection function is available, while<br>
the adaptive filtering is bypassed; 2) adaptive suppression mode: adaptive narrowband<br><br>
interference filtering is performed in real time and the interference detection result is<br>
reported.<br>
In such a case, the interference detection unit must be separated from the interference<br>
suppression unit, which will not be described in detail herein.<br>
The above device for suppressing narrowband interference may be integrated in a Field<br>
Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), high<br>
performance digital signal processor (DSP) or any other processing device.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for suppressing narrowband interference.<br>
The method obtains a result of interference detection according to sampled digital signals<br>
and then carries out interference suppression in the transform domain according to the result<br>
of interference detection. According to an embodiment as shown in Figure 5, the<br>
implementation procedure includes the following.<br>
In Block S301, the sampled digital signals are divided into several data segments.<br>
In Block S302, overlap-save or overlap-add is performed on adjacent data segments.<br>
In Block S303, the sampled digital signals are weighted. A window function or any other<br>
weighting method may be used in the weighting.<br>
In Block S304, the weighted digital signals are processed with a transform-domain<br>
operator and an interference detection result is obtained, including information of an<br>
interference-corrupted spectrum line and energy.<br>
In Block S305, a smooth filtering is performed on the interference detection result<br>
processed with the transform-domain operator, to obtain a stable interference detection<br>
result.<br>
In Block S306, the interference detection result is mapped into an interference<br>
suppression pulse function.<br>
In this process, the interference detection result may be synthesized into the interference<br>
suppression pulse function in real time on the basis of the unit noise pulse function for<br>
smoothing. Of course, the interference detection result may be mapped into the interference<br>
suppression pulse function on the basis of other similar pulse functions.<br>
As the quantity, energy and bandwidth of the narrowband interference vary, the position<br>
and magnitude of the DFT spectrum line of the interference provided in the interference<br><br>
detection part vary accordingly. The interference suppression pulse function synthesized in<br>
real time on the basis of the unit noise pulse may be matched with the energy and bandwidth<br>
of the narrowband interference adaptively.<br>
In Block S307, the interfered digital signals processed with the transform-domain<br>
operator are suppressed with the interference suppression pulse function.<br>
During this process, an "AND" operation may be performed on the interference<br>
suppression pulse function and the interfered digital signals processed with the<br>
transform-domain operator, to calculate and obtain the interference-suppressed digital<br>
signals. Of course, the present invention is not limited to the processing approach with the<br>
"AND" operation and other approaches may be taken as required.<br>
In Block S308, an inverse transformation operation in the transform domain is<br>
performed on the interference-suppressed digital signals, to obtain time-domain signals.<br>
In Block S309, data consolidation is performed on the time-domain signals to obtain a<br>
consolidated interference suppression result.<br>
In order to recognize the interference and abstract the characteristics such as the<br>
spectrum line corrupted by the interference and the intensity and bandwidth of the<br>
interference, in real time, in another embodiment of the method provided in the present<br>
invention, the method further includes an interference recognition and characteristic<br>
extraction procedure between S305 and S306. The procedure includes the following<br>
processes.<br>
In Process 1, the filtered interference detection result is compared with the threshold<br>
function; if the filtered interference detection result exceeds the spectrum line parameters of<br>
the threshold function, the position and energy characteristics of the interference detection<br>
result are measured;<br>
In Process 2, the characteristics are reported to the CPU of the receiver.<br>
The present invention supports two modes for implementation, that is, monitor mode, in<br>
which the real-time narrowband interference detection function is available, while the<br>
adaptive filtering is bypassed and adaptive suppression mode, in which adaptive<br>
narrowband interference filtering is performed in real time and the interference detection<br>
result is reported.<br>
In conclusion, it can be seen that by introducing the present invention into a receiver, the<br><br><br>
influence of narrowband interference to system performance may be reduced greatly by<br>
means of adaptive detection and interference suppression along with the advantage of a<br>
wideband spread spectrum system in view of narrowband signals and the communication<br>
system may work normally in an environment almost without narrowband interference. As a<br>
result, the robustness of the receiving system may be enhanced.<br>
Because the present invention is implemented in the digital part in front of the baseband<br>
demodulation, a base-2 FFT method may be used for the domain transformation operator<br>
DFT, so as to improve resource utilization efficiency.<br>
The present invention employs digital signal processing and may be integrated in an<br>
ASIC, FPGA, or DSP. The present invention may be implemented with low cost and may be<br>
widely used in spread spectrum communication systems (e.g., CDMA, WCDMA,<br>
TD-SCDMA) and other wideband communication systems.<br>
The present invention not only supports common default configuration for narrowband<br>
interference suppression, but also supports external loading of key parameters in the device.<br>
If the characteristics of specific narrowband interference are known, the parameters may be<br>
optimized and tuned with the prior knowledge as required and then configured into the<br>
device provided by the present invention by a programming interface of the device, so as to<br>
enhance the interference suppression capability.<br>

noted that the protect scope of the present invention is not limited to these preferred<br>
embodiments. Those skilled in the art may make modifications and variations in light of<br>
