BACKGROUND<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to flight vehicles where hypersonic drag is reduced by modifying the shock layer of the flight.<br>
DISCUSSION OF PRIOR ART<br>
Several active and passive techniques are used in order to modify the drag associated with a vehicle in flight. Examples of these techniques include the use of aerospike counter flowing jets, upstream energy additions, alteration of the flow field near the stagnation region etc. In the method wherein an aerospike is mounted at the nose [1] of the space plane, the bow shock is pushed away from the surface of the body. Another technique based on a similar concept involves the injection of gas from the stagnation point [2] to establish a fluid spike for drag reduction. Deposition of energy upstream of ' the stagnation point [3] changes the flow encountered by the vehicle to reduce drag. A marginal reduction in the drag force has been observed by techniques that utilize stepped afterbodies [4]. These techniques are employed with the objective of reducing wave drag. Enhancement in drag reduction during the use of aerospike by external burning has been observed [5]. This method alludes to the deposition of energy in the shock layer being a possible technique of wave drag reduction. The above methods do not reduce aerodynamic drag by controlled heat energy release in the shock layer of the body.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of this invention to develop a novel passive flow control technique for<br>
i ■I<br>
bodies in hypersonic flight wherein:<br>
 <br>
•	The shock layer around the bodies in flight at hypersonic Mach numbers is modified inflight, by controlling the amount of heat energy released into the shock layer of the body, consequently controlling the aerodynamic drag.<br>
•	The aerodynamic drag of the bodies in flight are controlled using non-intrusive passive devices that require no additional power.<br>
•	Suitable material coatings are developed for bodies in flight at hypersonic Mach numbers for controlled heat release into the shock layer during flight.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the proposed invention.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the variation of the aerodynamic drag with and without controlled energy<br>
addition in the shock layer.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention proposes a novel technique for flow control for bodies in hypersonic flight. By controlling the amount of heat energy released into the shock layer of the body, aerodynamic drag can be modified. One possible way for depositing energy is to induce the energy release reaction ahead of the vehicle within the shock layer. A passive technique is proposed for triggering energy release reactions in the shock layer ahead of the body using an appropriate energy release coating on the surface of the body of vehicle traveling at hypersonic Mach numbers. The energy release reactions are triggered at high enthalpy (3MJ/kg) conditions prevailing over the body that is in flight.<br>
The schematic diagram of the proposed invention is shown in figure 1. A non-intrusive special heat energy release coating (part no.3) is applied on the body (part 1) that is undertaking hypersonic flight. Once the appropriate temperature conditions are attained during flight controlled heat lenergy is released into the shock layer (part 2). Because of<br>
.r<br>
this energy addition the fluiii dynamics of the stagnating flow in fi^ont of the body is altered. Subsequent modifications in the shock layer hypersonic flow mechanics result in aerodynamic drag. The variation of the aerodynamic drag with and without controlled<br>
 <br>
energy addition in the shock layer is shown in Fig.2.The thickness of the layer, material of the layer, nature of coating on the body, static temperature and pressure of the flow at the altitude where aerodynamic drag reduction is required are some of the critical design parameters that govern the effectiveness of the present invention.<br>
A 60 degree apex angle blimt cone model, equipped with stagnation point heat transfer sensors for heat transfer rate measurement and accelerometer force balance for force measurement, is used for high enthalpy (3MJ/kg) testing in the wind tunnel. The outer surface of the blunt cone model is coated with the energy release coating. During the high enthalpy testing, the energy release coating evaporates and reacts with the dissociated gas in the shock layer. These reactions in turn deposit energy in the shock layer and reduce the strength of bow shock, ahead of the body. Because of the deposition of chemical energy in the shock layer, the bow shock gets pushed away from the body. Deposition of energy is recorded by the thermal sensor while reduction in wave drag is recorded by the accelerometer force balance.<br>
It is to be understood that this invention comprehensively covers all types of passive energy release coatings on the body during flight and any other associated or modified techniques/methods based on the current principle that is adopted in actual flight to reduce the aerodynamics drag at hypersonic Mach numbers.<br>
