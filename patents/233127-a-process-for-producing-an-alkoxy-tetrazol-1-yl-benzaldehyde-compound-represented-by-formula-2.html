				<td>The present invention relates to A process for producing an alkoxy-(tetrazol-l-yl)benzaldehyde compound represented by Formula (2).<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD <br>
The present invention relates to novel alkoxy-(tetrazol-l-yl)benzaldehyde compounds and processes for producing the same.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Use of alkoxy-(tetrazol-l-yl)benzaldehyde compounds as pharmaceutical intermediates has been reported. For example, 2-methoxy-5-(5-methyltetrazol-l-yl)benzaldehyde is known to be of use as an important intermediate for a pharmaceutical that mainly serves as an analgesic or an anti-inflammatory agent (EP 0829480A2). -Moreover, 2-methoxy-5-(5-trifluoromethyltetrazol-l-yl)benzaldehyde is known to be of use as an important intermediate for a pharmaceutical that mainly serves as an analgesic (WO 96/29326).<br>
Formylation reactions for aromatic compounds have been researched for a long period of time, and there are a variety of reported processes. Typical examples are (1) a process that uses dimethylformamide and phosphorus oxychloride (Org.   Synth.   Coll. Vol.   4, 1963, p. 539); (2) a process that uses dimethylformamide and trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (J.   Chem.   Soc.,  Chem. Commun.,   1990, p. 1571); (3) a process that uses hexamethylenetetramine and trifluoroacetic acid\(J. Org.   Chem., vol. 37, 1972, p. 3972); (4) a process that uses imidazole and trifluoroacetic anhydride (Tetrahedron,   vol. 36, 1980, p. 2505);<br>
(5)	a process that uses carbon monoxide, hydrochloric acid and aluminium (III) chloride (Org.   React.,   vol. 5, 1960, p. 290); and<br>
(6)	a process that uses zinc(II) cyanide, hydrochloric acid and aluminium (III) chloride (Chem.   Rev.,   vol. 63, 1963, p. 526).<br>
However, when 1-(alkoxyphenyl)-1H-tetrazole compounds are subjected to formylation reactions according to processes (1)<br>
to (4) above, the reactions hardly progress. Processes (5) and (6) may be hazardous when used for commercial production because in process (5) toxic carbon monoxide is used, and in process (6) hydrogen cyanide is generated in the reaction system.<br>
Therefore, formylation reactions for 1-(alkoxyphenyl)-1H-tetrazole compounds do not progress or are hazardous when prior-art processes are used. Prior-art processes are thus not industrially advantageous.<br>

In the process for producing an alkoxy-(tetrazol-1-yl)benzaldehyde compound of the present invention, the amount of hexamethylenetetramine is preferably 1.0 to 3.0 mol, and more preferably 1.2 to 2.0 mol, per mol of 1-(alkoxyphenyl)-1H-tetrazole compound of Formula (1) .<br>
Sulfonic acid solvents usable in the present invention are not limited insofar as water is not contained therein. Preferable sulfonic acid solvents are those that can dissolve 1-(alkoxyphenyl)-1H-tetrazole compounds of Formula (1). Specific examples are methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, pentafluoroethanesulfonic acid, etc. Such solvents may be used either singly as homosolvents or in suitable combinations as mixed solvents. Among such sulfonic acid solvents, particularly preferable is a mixed solvent in<br>
which methanesulfonic acid : trifluoromethanesulfonic acid = 1 : 0.6-1.5 (volume ratio). The amount of sulfonic acid solvent is preferably 1 to 15 ml, and more preferably 5 to 10 ml, per gram of 1-(alkoxyphenyl)-1H-tetrazole compound of Formula (1).<br>
The reaction of a 1-(alkoxyphenyl)-1H-tetrazole compound of Formula (1) with hexamethyienetetramine is carried out in a sulfonic acid solvent with heating. Excessively low reaction temperatures slow the reaction, and excessively high reaction temperatures result in the generation of large amounts of by-products. Therefore, the reaction temperature is preferably about 50 to about 150°C, and more preferably about 80 to about 100°C. The reaction time is about 1 to about 8 hours, and more preferably about 2 to about 5 hours.<br>
After reaction, the reaction system is cooled to room temperature, and then either water is introduced into the reaction system or the reaction solution is introduced into water for hydrolysis. The amount of water is preferably 1 to 15 ml, and more preferably 5 to 15 ml, per gram of 1-(alkoxyphenyl)-1H-tetrazole compound of Formula (1) . The temperature for hydrolysis is preferably about 0 to about 30°C, and more preferably about 0 to about 15°C. The hydrolysis time is preferably about 15 minutes to about 2 hours, and more preferably about 30 minutes to about 1 hour.<br>
Thereafter, extraction, separation, drying, solvent evaporation or like ordinary procedures are performed to obtain a crude product. Purification by crystallization, recrystallization, column chromatography, or the like can then be performed to obtain the alkoxy-(tetrazol-l-yl)benzaldehyde compound represented by Formula (2).<br>
In the present invention, examples of alkoxy-(tetrazol-l-yl)benzaldehyde compounds represented by Formula (2) include 4 -alkoxy-3-(tetrazol-l-yl)benzaldehyde compounds represented by Formula (4), 2-alkoxy-4-(tetrazol-l-yl)benzaldehyde compounds represented by Formula (6), 2-alkoxy-5-(tetrazol-1-yl)benzaldehyde compounds represented by Formula (8), etc. In<br>
alkoxy-(tetrazol-l-yl)benzaldehyde compounds represented by Formula (2), an aldehyde group is present preferably in an ortho or para position relative to A1.<br>
According to the present invention, alkoxy-(tetrazol-1-yl)benzaldehyde compounds can be safely and efficiently produced by formylating 1-(alkoxyphenyl)-1H-tetrazole compounds.<br>

After drying, filtration and solvent evaporation were performed, and the crude product thus obtained was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, ethyl acetate:n-hexane = 1:1), resulting in 0.61 g of 2-methoxy-5-(5-trifluoromethyltetrazol-1-yl)benzaldehyde as a white solid (yield: 27.4%).<br>

2-Methoxy-5-(5-trifluoromethyltetrazol-1-yl)benzaldehyde<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Fifteen grams of 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-5-trifluoromethyl-1H-tetrazole (61.4 mmol), 37.5 ml of methanesulfonic acid, 37.5 ml of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, and 17.22 g of hexamethylenetetramine (122.8 mmol) were introduced into a 300 ml flask, and heated to 100°C for reaction for 2 hours. After reaction, the reaction solution was cooled to room temperature, introduced into 75 ml of water cooled in an ice bath, and stirred at 5°C for 30 minutes. The reaction solution was then extracted with chloroform (150 ml x 2), and the organic phase thus obtained was washed with 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (150 ml x 1) and water (150 ml x 1), and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate for 1 hour. After drying, filtration and solvent evaporation were performed, and the crude product thus obtained was subjected to crystallization in 75 ml of isopropyl alcohol while cooling in an ice bath. After filtration and drying, 11.66 g of 2-methoxy-5-(5-trifluoromethyltetrazol-1-yl)benzaldehyde was obtained as a white<br>
