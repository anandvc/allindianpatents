THE PATENTS ACT 1970 [39 OF 1970]<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10, Rule 13]<br>
"METHOD FOR REGULATING AERATION DURING WASTE WATER BIOLOGICAL TREATMENT"<br>
SUEZ-LYONNAISE DES EAUX, a French company of 72 avenue de la Liberte, F-92753 Nanterre, Cedex, France<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
Process for the regulation of the aeration of a biological wastewater treatment plant<br>
The invention relates to a process  for the 5  regulation of the aeration of a biological wastewater treatment plant for the removal of carbon and nitrogen pollution.<br>
It is known that the purification of wastewater constitutes a major problem. Accordingly, the European<br>
10  Union   has   been   led   to   issue   a   directive<br>
(No. 91/271/EEC)  relating to the treatment of urban<br>
wastewater which determines the limits of discharges,<br>
into the natural environment, of untreated wastewater.<br>
Thus,  each treatment unit  is attributed a precise<br>
15 objective as regards the quality of the water treatment, it being possible for failure to achieve such an objective to give rise to penalties of a financial or even a penal nature.<br>
The  majority  of  urban  wastewater  treatment<br>
20 plants use the activated sludge process. An important phase of this process consists in the removal of the carbon and the nitrogen contained in the wastewater, by sequencing of the periods of aeration. It is indeed known that the main problem encountered in wastewater<br>
25 treatment plants is adapting the treatment to the variations in the rate of entry of the water to be purified and to its polluting load, so as to obtain a constant quality of purified water and the minimum regulatory quantity of polluting discharges into the<br>
30 natural environment. For this purpose, the removal of carbon and nitrogen requires a very strict and precise control of aeration given that this removal must correspond to two requirements. According to the first, a  sufficient  total duration of aeration  should be<br>
35  provided per day in order to carry out the oxidation of<br>
the  carbon  components  of  the  wastewater  and  the<br>
,     stabilization of the sludge; the second is linked more	directly to the daily distribution of the aeration<br>
phases in order to successfully carry out the removal<br><br><br><br>
- 2 -of the nitrogen. On the one hand, it is necessary to observe a sufficient period for maintaining under aerobic conditions for the sludge to perform the nitrification and, on the other hand, the 5 denitrification requires an appropriate effluent residence time under anoxic conditions. For this purpose, in the small-load activated sludge processes used in a single aeration basin, the removal of nitrogen compounds results from a strict control of the<br>
10  alternation of the aerated and nonaerated sequences.<br>
Any defect in the setting or the operation of the oxygen supply devices results in a malfunction of the wastewater purification stations, with repercussions on the quality of the effluent treated,<br>
15 the equilibrium of the purifying biomass and the characteristics of the sludge produced.<br>
A lack of adaptation of the aeration sequences therefore has effects in the short term on the quality of  the  water  obtained  which  may  then  contain<br>
20 nonoxidized nitrogen compounds if the periods of aeration are not sufficiently long, or nitrates if the periods of anoxia are too short. By contrast, when the periods of nonaeration are too long, the effluent to be treated encounters anaerobic conditions which must be<br>
25 absolutely avoided. Indeed, the phenomena of anaerobiosis in the treatment basin, linked to an under-oxygenation of certain zones, cause in the long term the appearance of filamentous bacteria and these microorganisms induce a modification of the structure<br>
30 of the floe and a reduction in its sedimentation ability, which of course has an unfavourable repercussion on the quality and the cost of the treatment. Another consequence of an insufficient cumulative duration of aeration relates to the quality<br>
35 of the sludge and, in particular, determines its stability.<br>
It can be understood why the regulation of aeration is one of the key points in such a water treatment process. Various methods of regulation have<br><br>
-' 3 -<br>
been used. Among these, the techniques below may be mentioned:<br>
1)	The most rustic technique in the field of the<br>
aeration of biological basins is  the timer which,<br>
5 depending on a program defined by the user, makes it possible to deliver oxygen at defined times of the day, without any correlation with the real need of the plant,<br>
2)	? a slightly improved technique is the decision for<br>
LO  aeration based on a high threshold and a low threshold<br>
of the oxidation-reduction potential (Redox potential) measured on the plant: the decision is taken on information at the time T, information which can be refuted a- few seconds later,<br>
15 3) a more rigorous technique has been developed by the present holder (FR-A-2,724, 646) . This method takes into account various Redox potentials, the derivative of the variation of this Redox potential and the history of the purification station, thus approaching the notion<br>
20  of an expert system,<br>
4)	other regulation logics are based on the measurement<br>
of the concentration of oxygen in the water to be<br>
purified; given that this notion does not really make<br>
sense, during the phases for nonaeration of the basins,<br>
25 the measurement of the oxygen concentration is then replaced with a timer which will assign a nonaeration time (period of anoxia) for example from 40 to 60 minutes, followed by a period during which the regulation  would  be  effectively  performed  on  the<br>
30 reference value for oxygen, with for example gradual stopping of the aeration turbines, one by one,<br>
5)	some attempts at regulation were made with respect<br>
to the measurement of the concentration of the<br>
ammoniacal and nitro compounds in the aeration basin,<br>
35 by characterizing the nitrification and denitrification efficiency and, subsequently, the oxygen requirements of the purification station.<br>
The use of the various prior art techniques mentioned above reveals numerous disadvantages which<br><br>
- 4 -demonstrate    their    limitations.    Among    these disadvantages,  the  following  may  be  mentioned  in particular:<br>
1)	automatic control by a timer obviously takes no<br>
5  account of the variations in polluting load imposed on<br>
the station by the irregular nature of the supply of water to be treated.<br>
2)	the method of Redox thresholds does not take into<br>
account the history of the purification station, such<br>
10 as temporary overloads, temporary breakdown of equipment, and the like.<br>
3)	the process according to FR-A-2,724,4 64 makes it<br>
possible to provide efficient depollution, on the<br>
carbon pollution, at the nitrification level and at the<br>
15 denitrification level. However, the objective of this method is to provide sufficient aeration which in fact always results in an excess supply of oxygen. However, this excess can be a drawback from an economic point of view. Furthermore, from the point of view of the water<br>
20 treatment, the aeration phase is affected because it starts in the presence of a relatively high content of oxygen, from 7 to 8 mg/1, which has to be removed before starting to use the oxygen of the nitrates. For the  same period of denitrification,  the  phase  for<br>
25 stopping the aeration will be correspondingly longer, and the effective treatment time is reduced over a day.<br>
4)	the use of the technique based on a simple<br>
measurement of the concentration of oxygen in the water<br>
to be purified does not make it possible to control the<br>
30 state of progress of the denitrification reactions which occur in the activated sludge basins since there is a need for a zero oxygen concentration to accomplish this phase. Furthermore, the oxygen concentrations necessary to bring about the nitrification can change<br>
35 in a range going from 3 to 7 mg/1, depending in particular on the state of oxidation of the sludge present in the biological reactor.<br>
5)	the technique based on the measurement of the<br>
concentration of the ammoniacal and the nitro compounds<br>
^<r-></r-><br>
- 5 -in the aeration basin can only be envisaged in large stations, given the high cost of the equipment. Moreover, this technique takes no account of the oxidation state of the sludge whereas a measurement of 5 the oxidation-reduction potential according to FR-A-2,724,646 makes it possible to evaluate the physiological state of the sludge.<br>
The disadvantages of the abovementioned prior art solutions therefore lead to a search for means<br>
10 which make it possible to optimize the various reactions in the aeration basins of the purification station, while controlling more judiciously the supply of oxygen to the latter. This constitutes the problem solved by the present invention.<br>
15	The. subject  of  the  present  invention  is<br>
therefore a process for regulating the aeration in a biological wastewater treatment plant using a carbon removal stage, a nitrification stage and a denitrification  stage,  characterized  in  that  it<br>
20  comprises the following stages:<br>
1)	continuously measuring the value of the oxidation-<br>
reduction potential of the treated medium, making it<br>
possible to activate or otherwise the aeration means;<br>
2)	during the aeration phases, measuring the oxygen<br>
25  concentration and exploiting its value, together with<br>
those of the oxidation-reduction potential in order to:<br>
maintain  the  aeration  if  the  oxygen<br>
concentration corresponds to a reference range;<br>
reduce   the   aeration   if   the   oxygen<br>
30	concentration is above the reference range, and<br>
increase  the  aeration  if  the  oxygen concentration is below the reference range, and<br>
3)	carrying out a self-adjustment of the reference<br>
values for oxygen by comparing, during the transition<br>
35 of the oxidation-reduction potential "partial nitrification/total nitrification", the real oxygen concentration with the reference range for the system and adjusting the reference value according to the real oxygen need of said system.<br>
-^&gt;<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
According to the present invention, when the<br>
Redox    transition    "partial    nitrification/total<br>
nitrification"  exists  in the. lower  region  of  the<br>
? reference range for the oxygen concentration, the value<br>
5  of this reference is reduced.<br>
According to the invention, when the value of<br>
the  Redox  transition  "partial  nitrification/total<br>
nitrification" is not reached for the reference value<br>
for the oxygen concentration, the latter is increased.<br>
10	It is evident why the process which is the<br>
subject of the present invention constitutes a combination of a process as defined in FR-A-2,724,646, comprising a monitoring of the derivative of the variation- of the oxidation-reduction potential, with a 15 monitoring of the "oxygen concentration" signal solely during the aeration phase. Schematically, the analysis of the oxidation-reduction potential values makes it possible to define the duration of the start and stop sequences for the plant and the analysis of the oxygen 20 concentration values makes it possible to control the power which has to be used during the aeration phases.<br>
According to the invention, there is added to this combination measurement of the Redox potential + measurement of the oxidation concentration as absolute 25 value [Q2] , the continuous comparison of said parameters which makes it possible to deduce and to confirm the coherence of the information gathered on the station. Thus, by virtue of the use of the process according to the invention, various information and 30 possibilities for crucial interventions relating to the state of the station are accessible such as, in particular:<br>
- the control of the reliability of the sensors for  the  Redox  potential  and  for  the  oxygen 35  concentration;<br>
the control of the reliability of the equipment or the identification of the pollution overloads;<br>
jfim^"^<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
-	the finer analysis of the biological state of the sludge,<br>
-	the possibility of readjusting the reference values for the oxygen concentration as a function of<br>
5  the performance of the sludge, and<br>
-	embarking on the denitrification phase with a<br>
relatively low content of residual oxygen and ensuring<br>
a rapid initiation of the denitrification phase.<br>
Other characteristics and advantages  of  the 10  invention will emerge from the description made below with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
-	Figure 1 is a diagram showing the various<br>
stages of the process of the invention as defined<br>
above,<br>
15	- Figure 2 is a diagram which makes it possible<br>
to understand the implementation of the process of the invention, and<br>
Figure  3  is  a  curve  illustrating  the variations of the oxygen concentration threshold as a<br>
20  function of time, measured on an industrial plant.<br>
Thus, as mentioned above, the various stages of the process of the invention, illustrated by the diagram in Figure 1, can be summarized in the following manner:<br>
25	First  of  all,  during  the  starting  phase,<br>
aeration is provided at the maximum capacity of the plant so as to provide a massive supply of oxygen: experience shows that this massive supply is useful for good implementation of the purification.<br>
30  Stage 1:<br>
Continuous measurement of  the value of the Redox potential (EH) for the treated medium which makes it possible to activate or otherwise the aeration means (aeration booster).<br>
35  Stage 2:<br>
Examination of this Redox potential: if the value of this potential is high, the nitrification and the removal of the carbon occur well; if the value of the Redox potential is low, this is due to insufficient<br><br><br>
- 8 -<br>
nitrification and removal of the carbon, which requires<br>
carrying out an examination of the oxygen component of<br>
the regulation.<br>
Stage 3:<br>
5	Carrying  out  measurement  of  the  oxygen<br>
concentration of the medium treated and examination of this concentration (see Figure 2) . The following cases may present themselves:<br>
a)	either the value of the oxygen concentration<br>
10  [02]  is situated in the region in Figure 2 called<br>
"Oxygen Reference Range": the aeration power should be maintained,<br>
b)	or the value of the oxygen concentration<br>
[02]  is -situated in the  region  designated by  the<br>
15 reference 2 in Figure 2 (that is to say below the reference value for [02] ) : the oxygenation power should be increased or, failing this, the aeration boosters should be kept operating at their maximum in order to provide the necessary quantity of oxygen,<br>
20	c) or the [02] value is situated in the region<br>
designated by the reference 3 in Figure 2 (that is to say above the reference range for [02]), the Redox potential may be insufficient but the reference value for oxygen is exceeded: the aeration is reduced, or<br>
25 failing that, the aeration boosters are kept operating at their minimum,<br>
d) or the [02] value is situated in the region designated by the reference 1 in Figure 2 (Redox potential  and oxygen concentration  too  low),  this<br>
30 situation may correspond to an overloading of the station (high respiration of the sludge) or to a breakdown in the equipment or the sensors: in this case, the invention allows for an alarm to be triggered, and<br>
35	e) or the [02] value is situated in the region<br>
designated by the reference 4 in Figure 2: the combination of a high content of oxygen with an average Redox potential may indicate a fault in the sensors or a poisoning of the biomass  (low respiration of the<br><br>
- 9 -sludge) : in this case, the invention also provides for an alarm to be triggered.<br>
Last stage:<br>
5	It was seen above that the invention allowed<br>
for an additional stage consisting in the self-adjustment of the reference values for the oxygen concentration.<br>
During  the  transition  of  the  oxidation-<br>
10 reduction potential from the "partial nitrification" region to the "total nitrification" region, the invention provides for a measurement of the oxygen concentration in the system to be carried out in order to modify the oxygen reference values, which makes it<br>
15 possible to reevaluate the real needs for oxygen which are necessary for the nitrification reactions to be carried out and for complete oxidation of the constituents of the sludge.<br>
If this Redox transition occurs in the regions<br>
20 1 or 2 (Figure 2) of the oxygen concentration values, the need for oxygen required by the biomass is low and, according to the invention, the oxidation reference value is reduced, which makes it possible to promote energy savings in relation to the aeration.<br>
25	Conversely,  when  the  value  of  the  Redox<br>
transition cannot be regularly reached under the proposed reference oxygen concentration conditions, there is a high need for oxygen and it is therefore necessary to increase the [02] reference value. This<br>
30 increase makes it possible to secure the process and to promote, in this case, reoxygenation of the sludge.<br>
In Figure 3 of the accompanying drawings, the variation in the oxygen concentration threshold as a function of time has been represented,  this figure<br>
35 making it possible to show how, by using the process of the invention, a self-adjustment of the [02] reference threshold values is obtained.<br>
This Figure 3 represents the variations in the oxygen thresholds over the duration of the study period<br><br>
- 10 -(essentially 1 year) . The points © termed real value represent the dissolved oxygen concentrations reached when the Redox potential indicated a passage from "partial nitrification" to "complete nitrification" in 5 "PHASE 3".- The continuous and more stable line represents the oxygen reference value defined by the control logic, on the basis of the real values. The variations are dampened here so as to limit the modifications  in reference values while making the<br>
10  process reliable.<br>
It is important to note the range of variation of this [02] reference value which reflects the large variation in the real needs of the biomass (making the populations younger and the like). In fact the curve in<br>
15 Figure 3 teaches that the biological system can function very well in total nitrification, with a dissolved oxygen content of the order of 2 to 3 mg/1 (case of "old" sludge) , whereas in some cases ("younger" sludge) , a content of 5 to 6 mg/ml is found<br>
20 to be insufficient to ensure total nitrification. The invention makes it possible to overcome this difficulty and it leads to self-adjustment of the operating conditions.<br>
In the table below, there have been indicated<br>
25  the comparative results obtained on three plants using respectively  a  process  for  biological  wastewater treatment  without  automatic  regulation  (A) ,  with automatic regulation of the Redox potential EH only (B) and with automatic regulation of the Redox potential EH<br>
30  and the oxygen concentration according to the invention<br>
(C).  This  table  clearly  shows  the  advantages,  in<br>
particular the economic   advantages, offered by the use<br>
of the process which is the subject of the present<br>
invention.<br><br><br>
- 12 -Among the advantages provided by the process which is the subject of the invention, the following may be mentioned in particular:<br>
-	modulation of the aeration power provided,<br>
5  which is necessary for carrying out the reactions for<br>
treating the carbon and nitrogen pollutants;<br>
-	possibility of verifying the coherence of the<br>
information received and of detecting the limiting<br>
events, which occur in the purification station, and<br>
10	- possibility, for example a finer expertise of<br>
the requirements of the sludge, of carrying out a self-adjustment of the actual reference values for regulating the system with a view to making it reliable.-<br>
15	It  remains  clearly  understood  that  the<br>
invention is not limited to the exemplary embodiments described and/or mentioned above but that it encompasses all the variants which may fall within the scope of the accompanying claims.<br>
