				<td>HYDRAULIC CHAIN TENSIONER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to tensioners used with chain drives in<br>
automotive timing and power transmission applications. In particular, the present<br>
invention is related to a hydraulic chain tensioner system.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
A tensioning device, such as a hydraulic tensioner, is used as a control device for a<br>
power transmission chain, or similar power transmission devices, as the chain travels<br>
between a plurality of sprockets. In this device, the chain transmits power from a driving<br>
shaft to a driven shaft, so that part of the chain is slack and part of the chain is tight.<br>
Generally, it is important to impart and maintain a certain degree of tension in the chain to<br>
prevent noise, slippage, or the unmeshing of teeth in the case of a toothed chain.<br>
Prevention of such slippage is particularly important in the case of a chain driven camshaft<br>
in an internal combustion engine because jumping of teeth will throw off the camshaft<br>
timing, possibly causing damage or rendering the engine inoperative.<br>
However, in the harsh environment of an internal combustion engine, various<br>
factors can cause fluctuations in the chain tension. For instance, wide variations in<br>
temperature and thermal expansion coefficients among the various parts of the engine can<br>
cause the chain tension to vary between excessively high or low levels. During prolonged<br>
use, wear to the components of the power transmission system can cause a decrease in<br>
chain tension. In addition, camshaft and crankshaft induced torsional vibrations cause<br>
considerable variations in chain tensions. Reverse rotation of an engine, occurring for<br>
example in stopping or in failed attempts at starting, can also cause fluctuations in chain<br>
tension. For these reasons, a mechanism is desired to remove excessive tensioning forces<br>
on the tight side of the chain and to ensure the necessary tension on the slack side of the<br>
chain.<br>
Hydraulic tensioners are a common method of maintaining proper chain<br>
tension. In general, these mechanisms employ a lever arm that pushes against the chain on<br>
the slack side of the power transmission system. This lever arm must push toward the<br>
chain, tightening the chain when the chain is slack, and must be very rigid when the chain<br>
tightens.<br>
To accomplish this result, a hydraulic tensioner typically comprises a rod or<br>
cylinder as a piston, which is biased in the direction of the chain by a tensioner spring. The<br>
piston is housed within a cylindrical housing, having an interior space which is open at the<br>
end facing the chain and closed at the other end. The interior space of the housing contains<br>
a pressure chamber in connection with a reservoir or exterior source of hydraulic fluid<br>
pressure. The pressure chamber is typically formed between the housing and the piston,<br>
and it expands or contracts when the piston moves within the housing.<br>
Typically, valves are employed to regulate the flow of fluid into and out of the<br>
pressure chamber. For instance, an inlet check valve typically includes a ball-check valve<br>
that opens to permit fluid flow in to the pressure chamber when the pressure inside the<br>
chamber has decreased as a result of outward movement of the piston. When the pressure<br>
in the pressure chamber is high, the inlet check valve closes, preventing fluid from exiting<br>
the pressure chamber. The closing of the inlet check valve prevents the piston chamber<br>
from contracting, which in turn prevents the piston from retracting, achieving a so-called<br>
"no-return" function.<br>
Many tensioners also employ a pressure relief mechanism that allows fluid to exit<br>
the pressure chamber when the pressure in the chamber is high, thus allowing the piston to<br>
retract in response to rapid increases in chain tension. In some tensioners, the pressure<br>
relief mechanism is a spring biased check valve. The check valve opens when the<br>
pressure exceeds a certain pressure point. Some tensioners may employ a valve which<br>
performs both the inlet check function as well as the pressure relief function.<br>
Other mechanisms employ a restricted path through which fluid may exit the fluid<br>
chamber, such that the volume of flow exiting the fluid chamber is minimal unless the<br>
pressure in the fluid chamber is great. For instance, a restricted path may be provided<br>
through the clearance between the piston and bore, through a vent tube in the protruding<br>
end of the piston, or through a vent member between the fluid chamber and the<br>
fluid reservoir.<br>
A hydraulic tensioner as used with a tensioner arm or shoe is shown in Simpson et<br>
al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,967,921, incorporated herein by reference. Hydraulic chain tensioners<br>
typically have a plunger slidably fitted into a chamber and biased outward by a spring to<br>
provide tension to the chain. A lever, arm or shoe is often used at the end of the plunger to<br>
assist in the tensioning of the chain. The hydraulic pressure from an external source, such<br>
as an oil pump or the like, flows into the chamber through passages formed in the housing.<br>
The plunger is moved outward against the arm by the combined efforts of the hydraulic<br>
pressure and the spring force.<br>
When the plunger tends to move in a reverse direction (inward) away from the<br>
chain, typically a check valve is provided to restrict the flow of fluid from the chamber. In<br>
such a fashion, the tensioner achieves a so-called no-return function, i.e., movements of<br>
the plunger are easy in one direction (outward) but difficult in the reverse direction.<br>
Blade and block tensioners have been used in the past to apply tension to chains.<br>
A block tensioner (1) as known in the prior art is shown in Fig. 1. The tensioner (1) has a<br>
piston (2) located within a housing (5). The springs (3) are located in a fluid chamber (4)<br>
within the piston (2).<br>
An example of a blade tensioner is shown in Fig. 2. The conventional blade<br>
tensioner (10) includes a blade shoe (11) made of resin having a curved chain sliding face<br>
and numerous blade springs (21) preferably made of metallic material. The blade springs<br>
(21) are arranged in layers on the opposite side of the blade shoe (11) from the chain<br>
sliding face, and provide spring force to the blade shoe (11). The ends of each spring-<br>
shaped blade spring (21) are inserted in the indented portions (14) and (15) which are<br>
formed in the distal portion (12) and proximal portion (13) of the blade shoe (11),<br>
respectively.<br>
A bracket (17) is provided for mounting the blade tensioner (10) in an engine.<br>
Holes (18) and (19) are formed in the bracket (17), and mounting bolts are inserted into<br>
these holes (18) and (19). A sliding face (16) contacts the distal portion of the blade shoe<br>
(11) and permits sliding. The slide face (16) is formed on the distal portion of the<br>
bracket (17). A pin (20) supports the proximal portion (13) of the blade shoe<br>
(11) so that it may move in either direction. The pin (20) is secured in the center<br>
of the bracket (17).<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5, 647, 811, shows a chain tensioner with an integrated<br>
tensioner and arm. The hydraulic tensioner in that patent is pressure fed.<br>
Due to space restrictions, functionality or numerous other reasons, common<br>
tensioners such as the block type tensioners (Figure 1) and blade type tensioners<br>
(Figure 2) discussed above cannot be used in some applications. Therefore,<br>
there is a need in the art for an improved tensioner which can overcome the<br>
prior art shortcomings.<br>
US 5 718 650 discloses a hydraulic tensioner having a porous vent formed of<br>
sintered powder metal adapted to permit air to readily escape from within the<br>
tensioner while inhibiting air ingestion during cycling and limiting oil leakage. The<br>
vent is located within an aperture of the plunger near the highest point of the<br>
tensioner or at the top of the spring within the interior space of the plunger.<br>
Alternatively, the air vent may be located at the oil supply inlet before the oil<br>
enters the tensioner's fluid chamber.<br>
DE4319229 describes an oil-operated tensioner for applying tension to a power-<br>
transmitting chain, in which a ball check valve 33, 63 is positioned above the oil<br>
chamber 16, 46, either in the tensioner housing 14, Figure 1, or in the plunger<br>
48, Figure 3. The ball of the check valve can oscillate when air is present in the<br>
oil chamber, since air is compressible. Oscillation of the ball, which occurs when<br>
the plunger oscillates during operation of the tensioner, allows the residual air to<br>
be discharged from the oil chamber. However, after the air is discharged,<br>
oscillation of the plunger is restrained by the incompressibility of the oil, and<br>
oscillation of the ball is restrained by the viscosity of the oil which then surrounds<br>
the ball. The valve seat of the check valve preferably opens upwardly.<br>
DE19500940 describes a tighter for claims, especially control a slide rail (10) is<br>
pressed against the chain. The cylinder housing (20) integrated with the slide rail<br>
contains a mechanical spring system and a piston-type compression member<br>
(24). The slide rail is swivel mounted in a swivel bearing (18). The cylinder<br>
housing has a cylinder chamber (32) containing a pressure oil pad as extra<br>
hydraulic spring system for the pressure member. A pipe (34) leading from the<br>
swivel bearing and opening into the cylinder chamber supplies oil to the pressure<br>
oil pad. The pressure oil pad has a spring-loaded excess pressure valve (36)<br>
comprising locking member and spring enclosed by a bushing (38).<br>
DE10007478 discloses a hydraulic clamping device. The device incorporates a<br>
relief valve mechanism (10) in flow connection with a high pressure oil chamber<br>
(8). The mechanism has a cup-shaped outlet element (11) with outlet (11A) to<br>
permit leakage of oil from the chamber. A relief valve (12) is integral with the<br>
outlet element and drains oil from the chamber, when the pressure rises above a<br>
set limit. The valve has a cup-shaped sleeve (16) moving in the outlet element, a<br>
sleeve spring (19) to press the sleeve towards the chamber, and an outlet (15) in<br>
a side wall of the outlet element. The outlet is normally closed by the valve, and<br>
is opened, when the sleeve is pressed against the spring force in a direction<br>
away from the chamber.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a hydraulic tensioner for applying tension to a<br>
chain, comprising:<br>
a) a piston assembly comprising:<br>
i) a piston with a hollow interior, and a piston bore surrounding the<br>
piston and confining a chamber therewith;<br>
ii) an inlet check valve for controlling entry of fluid into the chamber; and<br>
b) a non-return means coupled to the piston to allow extension of the piston<br>
characterized in that the inlet check valve is located such that when an end<br>
of the piston assembly is submerged in fluid, the inlet check valve is located<br>
below the fluid level and permits flow of the fluid into the chamber;<br>
the non-return means is arranged to allow retraction of the piston by no<br>
more than an included backlash amount;<br>
the piston assembly comprises an outlet check valve for preventing air entry<br>
when the piston extends and permitting controlled fluid outflow when the<br>
piston retracts, located at an opposite end of the piston assembly from the<br>
inlet check valve; and<br>
the tensioner acts as a self-priming pump whereby the piston motion allowed<br>
by the included backlash amount in combination with the inlet check valve<br>
and the outlet check valve, enables the tensioner to draw fluid into the<br>
chamber for filling the chamber without fluid being supplied from an external<br>
source under pressure.<br>
Advantageously the tensioner can tension a chain without any need for an<br>
external fluid pressure supply. An end of the piston assembly can be<br>
submerged in fluid. The inlet check valve, which controls entry of fluid into<br>
the piston, is preferably located below the fluid level. The invention<br>
correspondingly provides a method of applying tension to a chain comprising<br>

a) providing a tensioner comprising:<br>
i) a piston assembly comprising:<br>
A) a piston with a hollow interior and a piston bore<br>
surrounding the piston:<br>
B) an inlet check valve for controlling an entry of fluid into the<br>
piston, located such that when an end of the piston<br>
assembly is submerged in fluid, the inlet check valve<br>
permits fluid flow into the hollow interior; and<br>
ii) a non-return means coupled to the piston such that the piston is<br>
extendable<br>
characterized by<br>
the piston assembly comprising an outlet check valve for<br>
preventing air entry when the piston extends and permitting<br>
controlled fluid overflow when the piston retracts, located at an<br>
opposite end of the piston assembly from the inlet check valve;<br>
and the non-return means allowing retraction of the piston by<br>
no more than an included backlash amount.<br>
b) submerging an inlet end of the tensioner in a fluid supply such that an<br>
inlet check valve is under a level of the fluid supply;<br>
c) self-priming the tensioner, wherein the tensioner lifts the fluid supply into<br>
the tensioner due to piston motion within the included backlash amount and<br>
due to action of the inlet check valve and the outlet check valve, to fill an<br>
interior of the tensioner.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In some of the applications where the prior art tensioners of Fig. 1 and 2 could not<br>
be used, a tensioner arm incorporating a spring-loaded piston pushing against a stationary<br>
object would suffice. However, the limitation of a spring loaded piston is that the spring<br>
force to overcome peak chain loading and to maintain chain control causes excessive chain<br>
wear.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 3 through 5, a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention is shown. A power transmission device (30) comprises a chain (36) or belt (not<br>
shown) operating between two sprockets (39) and (40). A case (38) preferably encloses<br>
the device and also acts as an abutment (33) for a piston (31), which is preferably spring-<br>
loaded. The chain sliding face (37) of a tensioner arm (32) mounted on a pivot (35)<br>
presses against the chain (36) to maintain tension.<br>
The tensioner arm (32) has a first side (60) and a second side (61) spaced from the<br>
first side. A first end (62) is disposed between the first (60) and second (61) sides. A<br>
second end (63) is disposed between the first (60) and second (61) sides, and spaced from<br>
the first end (62). Preferably, the first (62) and second (63) ends join the first and second<br>
sides. The second side (61) provides the chain sliding face (37) which is in contact with<br>
the chain (36) to be tensioned. Preferably, the second side (61) is arcuately shaped to<br>
provide a suitable chain travel surface. Of course, it will be understood by one skilled in<br>
the art that the second side (61) can have any suitable shape as dictated by manufacturing<br>
and consumer preference concerns.<br>
The tensioner arm (32) may be made from any material that meets all<br>
structural, environmental, wear and durability criteria. Materials such as steel, aluminum<br>
and plastics are preferably used as well as composites such as glass filled nylon.<br>
The chain sliding face (37) of a tensioner arm (32) may be made from any durable<br>
wear resistant material. A synthetic material, such as nylon, which has high wearability<br>
and durability characteristics can be used. In particular, Nylon 6/6 is one commercially<br>
available material that may be used. Alternatively, the chain sliding face may be made of<br>
PEEK (polyetheretherketone), which also has high wearability and durability<br>
characteristics. One of ordinary skill in the art would be capable of selecting one of these<br>
or other numerous suitable materials.<br>
The hydraulic tensioner (41) includes the piston (31), which applies force to the<br>
tensioner arm (32). In a preferred embodiment, the tensioner (41) is combined and<br>
incorporated into the tensioner arm (32) for improved packaging. The tensioning device<br>
extends from the tensioner arm (32). The button, or bottom end of the piston (47) contacts<br>
a stationary abutment (33). This contact forces the arm (32) away from the abutment (33)<br>
and into the chain path, causing tension.<br>
A non-return mechanism coupled to the piston (31) ensures that the piston (31)<br>
extends but does not retract more than an included backlash (55) amount. Non-return<br>
mechanisms take up worn chain slack to prevent sprocket tooth jump of the chain. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the non-return mechanism is a ratcheting mechanism, but it will be<br>
understood by one skilled in the art that other non-return mechanisms are possible within<br>
the teachings of the invention, such as a cam, roller wedge or sprague mechanism, or rod-<br>
and-catch plate arrangement. The ratchet teeth (46) are located on the side of the piston<br>
(31), engaging ratchet teeth on a pawl (45) (see Fig. 4). A spring (44) is preferably located<br>
within the pawl (45) to maintain engagement of the pawl (45) to the ratchet teeth (46).<br>
The pawl (45) moves in and out along the axis of the spring (44). The pawl (45) motion is<br>
restricted to allow the piston (31) to extend but not retract except for the included backlash<br>
(55) amount. The pawl (45) prevents excessive chain motion due to peak chain loads or<br>
insufficient hydraulic pressure.<br>
Applying the above concept in an application using oil bath chain<br>
lubrication allows an end of the tensioning piston (31) to be submerged in the fluid bath.<br>
As shown in the figures, the fluid level (34) is above the extended portion of the piston<br>
(31).<br>
A fluid inlet passageway (54) feeding an inlet check valve (52) is located in the<br>
submerged end of the piston (31) (see Fig. 5). A seal (53) ensures that there is little or no<br>
leakage. An outlet flow control, shown as check valve (50) and an outlet passageway (56)<br>
is located in the insert (42) at the other end of the piston-insert chamber. The outlet flow<br>
control prevents air entry when the piston extends, and permits controlled fluid outflow<br>
when the piston retracts. As long as the inlet check valve (52) is submerged in fluid, the<br>
inlet check valve (52) could alternatively be located in the insert (42) and the outlet flow<br>
control (50) could alternatively be located in the piston (31). A seal (64) ensures that there<br>
is little or no leakage.<br>
The included backlash amount in the non-return mechanism, combined with the<br>
inlet check valve and outlet flow control in the piston, allows the tensioner to act as a self<br>
priming (purging) pump, without the need for an external fluid pressure supply. If the<br>
outlet passageway (56) is further restricted with an orifice (51) or tortuous path (58) or the<br>
like, the action of the hydraulic tensioner will be damped. In some applications, a tortuous<br>
path (58) alone can act as an outlet flow control.<br>
A retaining ring (43) is preferably located on a side of the insert (42) to contain the<br>
pawl (45) and a spring (44) when the piston (31) extends. The pawl (45) is preferably<br>
slidably connected to the tensioner arm and contained by the retaining ring (43). In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the pawl (45) is guided in a channel, which is preferably U-shaped.<br>
The pawl (45) slides up and down in the channel.<br>
In one example of the invention, shown in Figs. 6 and 7, the inlet check valve is an<br>
umbrella check valve (60). The umbrella check valve (60) includes a skirt (63), a stem<br>
(64), and a seat (65). In this example, the outlet flow control is preferably a pressure relief<br>
valve (61). The pressure relief valve (61) allows fluid to exit the piston (31) when the<br>
pressure in the piston (31) is high, thus allowing the piston to retract in response to rapid<br>
increases in chain tension. In another example, shown in Fig. 8, the inlet check<br>
valve and the outlet flow control are both ball check valves (66).<br>
Accordingly, it is to be understood that the embodiments of the invention herein<br>
described are merely illustrative of the application of the principles of the invention.<br>
Reference herein to details of the illustrated embodiments is not intended to limit the<br>
scope of the claims, which themselves recite those features regarded as essential to the<br>
invention.<br>

when an end of the piston assembly is<br>
submerged in fluid, the inlet check valve<br>
permits fluid flow into the hollow interior; and<br>
ii) a non-return means coupled to the piston (31) such that the<br>
piston (31) is extendable<br>
characterized by<br>
the piston assembly comprising an outlet check valve (50) for<br>
preventing air entry when the piston extends and permitting<br>
controlled fluid overflow when the piston retracts located at an<br>
opposite end of the piston assembly form the inlet check valve<br>
(52); and the non-return means allowing retraction of the<br>
piston (31) by no more than an included backlash amount;<br>
b) submerging an inlet end of the tensioner in a fluid supply such that the<br>
inlet check valve (52) is under a level of the fluid supply;<br>
c) self-priming the tensioner, wherein the tensioner lifts the fluid supply<br>
into the tensioner due to piston motion within the included backlash<br>
amount and due to action of the inlet check valve and the outlet check<br>
valve, to fill an interior of the tensioner.<br>
This invention relates to a hydraulic tensioner for applying tension to a chin<br>
without external fluid pressure supply. The hydraulic tensioner comprises a<br>
piston assembly comprising a piston (31) with a hollow interior and a piston bore<br>
(42) surrounding the piston (31). An end of the piston assembly is submerged in<br>
fluid. An inlet check valve (52), which control an entry of fluid into the piston<br>
(31), is located below the fluid level (34). An outlet check valve (50), located at<br>
an opposite end of the piston assembly from the inlet valve (52), controls an exit<br>
of fluid from the piston (31). A non-return mechanism (44-46) is coupled to the<br>
piston (3) such that the piston extends but does not retract more than an<br>
included backlash amount (55). Utilizing the motion allowed within this backlash<br>
amount (55), the tensioner acts as a self- priming pump.</td>
