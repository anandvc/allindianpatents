				<td>ELECTRICALLY CONTROLLABLE DEVICE HAVING VARIABLE OPTICAL<br>
PROPERTIES OR HOLOGRAPHIC, THERMOTROPIC OR SUSPENDED-PARTICLE<br>
SYSTEM<br>
The present invention relates to electrically controllable systems having<br>
variable optical properties and more specifically to systems of the glazing type in<br>
which it is possible to modify the light scattering under the effect of a suitable<br>
power supply, such as liquid-crystal systems and optical valves.<br>
Subsidiarily, the invention applies similarly to systems which exhibit<br>
significant light scattering, but only in a narrow range of viewing angles of<br>
incidence, such as holographic systems. It also applies to thermotropic systems<br>
and to suspended-particle systems or SPDs (suspended particle displays).<br>
Liquid-crystal systems use a functional film based on a medium made of<br>
one or more polymers, in which droplets of liquid crystals, especially nematic<br>
liquid crystals exhibiting positive dielectric anisotropy, are dispersed. The liquid<br>
crystals, when a voltage is applied to the film, orient along a preferred axis,<br>
allowing vision. With no voltage applied, when the crystals are not aligned, the<br>
film becomes scattering and prevents vision. Examples are described in the<br>
patents EP-88 126, EP-268 877, EP-238 164, EP-357 234, EP-409 442 and EP-964<br>
288. This type of film is generally placed between two substrates, for example<br>
between two sheets of polymer which are provided with electrodes, this<br>
structure then possibly being laminated between two glass plates to form<br>
glazing. This type of glazing is sold by Saint-Gobain Glass under the name<br>
PRIVA-UTE. In fact, it is possible to use any device using -so-called NCAP<br>
(Nematic Curvilinearly Aligned Phase) or PDLC (Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal)<br>
crystals.<br>
Systems based on optical valves generally use a functional film in the form<br>
of a matrix of a possibly crosslinked polymer, in which matrix are dispersed<br>
microdroplets containing particles capable of orienting in a preferred direction<br>
under the effect of an electric or magnetic field. Depending in particular on the<br>
potential applied and/or the nature and the concentration of orientable<br>
particles, the film may exhibit variable light transmission, generally associated<br>
with variable light scattering (when under voltage, the particles intercept very<br>
much less tight than when there is no voltage). An example of this is described in<br>
the patent WO 93/09460, with a film comprising a matrix of crosslinkable<br>
polyorganosiloxane and absorbent particles of the polyiodide type.<br>
Many applications have been envisioned for these types of system, for<br>
example for equipping internal partitions or constituting exterior glazing for<br>
buildings (especially in offices), or in means of locomotion on land (trains and<br>
cars), in the air (aircraft) or on the sea.<br>
As mentioned in the patent EP-823 653, a novel application consists in<br>
using them as a backprojection screen operating in transmission, in which the<br>
projector lies on one side of the screen and the viewer on the other. The<br>
possible uses are numerous: for equipping shop windows, for advertising panels,<br>
for display panels in raitway stations or airports, for example. The use of liquid-<br>
crystal systems makes projection possible without having to darken the room in<br>
which the projection takes place. However, with a standard system, the image<br>
contrast is not very good. This is the reason why the patent EP-823 653 proposes<br>
a solution for improving this contrast, which consists in juxtaposing, on the<br>
variable scattering system, a variable light transmission system of the<br>
electrochromic type. When the electrochromic system is under voltage, it<br>
darkens and gives the image projected onto the screen better contrast and, for<br>
the viewer, better visual comfort in a naturally or artificially lit environment; in<br>
particular, it makes it possible to absorb the stray light reflected in a diffuse<br>
manner off the screen coming from the illumination means placed on the side<br>
where the viewer is.<br>
This solution is attractive, since the optical properties of the screen<br>
obtained can be varied extremely. However, it also has drawbacks: manufacture<br>
of the screen, requiring the juxtaposition of two functional systems, is not very<br>
simple, the resulting screen itself may have to have a significant thickness, and<br>
it is necessary to install two systems for connections and power supply.<br>
The aim of the invention is therefore to improve the performance<br>
characteristics of a variable light scattering system like one of those described<br>
above, especially for the purpose of applying it as a projection screen, and to do<br>
so by means that are simple to manufacture, simple to implement and simple to<br>
maintain, and consequently less expensive.<br>
The subject of the invention is firstly an element having variable optical<br>
properties, comprising:<br>
(a) a system having electrically controlled variable light scattering, of<br>
the optical-valve or liquid-crystal system type, or a suspended-particle system or<br>
a system (a) which is not electrically controlled, such as a holographic or<br>
thermotropk system or one which is associated with<br>
(b) at least one absorbent element, absorbing at least in the visible<br>
range.<br>
Within the context of the invention, the term "absorbent element (b)" is<br>
understood to mean an element which permanently has the desired optical<br>
property in the visible, without the need for electrical or other control.<br>
It should be noted that it is also possible to include thermotropic systems<br>
among electrically controlled systems when they are associated with one or<br>
more heating elements (for example a conducting layer heating by the Joule<br>
effect), so as to make them switch at will, and not depending, in particular, on<br>
the environmental conditions to which they are exposed.<br>
The invention has therefore chosen to add a functionality to a standard<br>
system (a) or (a'), namely light absorption that can be chosen by design to the<br>
desired level, or to a higher level than it normally has, but without having<br>
recourse to a system requiring electrical control. In this way, manufacture of the<br>
assembly is simpler, by using absorbent elements that can be produced more<br>
quickly and more easily than electrochromic-type systems. Excellent results are<br>
obtained in terms of optical performance. Thus, for a given absorption A<br>
conferred by the absorbent element, in the case of an application of the device<br>
according to the invention to a backprojection screen operating in transmission,<br>
the reflection of the ambient light off the screen is reduced by a factor A2. Since<br>
the light coming from the projection light source is also attenuated by a factor<br>
A, the increase in contrast of the screen is A2/A, that is to say equal to A.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the system (a) is a liquid-<br>
crystal system as described above, comprising a film of liquid crystal droplets<br>
dispersed in a medium and contained by two protective sheets each provided<br>
with an electrode. These sheets may be chosen to be based on rigid, preferably<br>
essentially transparent substrates (glass or sufficiently thick polycarbonate (PC))<br>
or semirigid or flexible substrates (thin polymer, such as thin PC). The two<br>
sheets may be of different types (a glass substrate and a polymer substrate for<br>
example).<br>
In the preferred variant, the two protective sheets are based on a flexible<br>
polymer, especially transparent sheets of the PET (polyethylene terephthalate).<br>
The absorbent elements (b) may be chosen to be of different types. It is<br>
possible to use one or more of them, whether of the same type or of different<br>
types. They will therefore "add" light absorption to the system (a) or (a'), over<br>
its entire area or most of its area.<br>
The absorbent element may firstly consist of a rigid or semirigid substrate<br>
(glass or polymer) which is bulk-tinted by suitable dyes. It is preferred to chose<br>
glass substrates having a light transmission TL of 10 to 60% for a thickness of<br>
 around 1 to 8 mm, especially 1.5 to 6 mm. Most particularly, it is possible to use<br>
the range of glasses sold under the name PARSOL or VENUS by Saint-Gobain Glass<br>
or to choose glass compositions like those described in the patents... Generally,<br>
it is preferred that the glass or the plastic substrate have a color in transmission<br>
that is as neutral as possible, especially in the grays. In an application as a<br>
backprojection screen, it is these tones which denature the original colors of the<br>
projected images the least.<br>
The absorbent element may also consist of a bulk-tinted sheet of flexible<br>
polymer, especially a thermoplastic, that is to say the type of sheet used as<br>
insert sheet in laminated glazing. it may be made of polyvinylbutyral (PVB),<br>
polyurethane (PU) or ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA). These tinted sheets have, for<br>
example, a light transmission TL of 25 to 60%, especially 30 to 45%, for a<br>
thickness generally between 0.2 and 0.8 mm (generally in the region of<br>
0.38 mm). For the same reason as above, it will be preferred to choose a neutral<br>
color in transmission, for example in the grays. It is also possible to use a sheet<br>
based on a polymer having absorbent properties which will be calendered to a<br>
clear substrate, for example a clear glass.<br>
The absorbent element may also be in the form of a thin absorbent layer<br>
placed on one side of a rigid (glass or polymer) substrate or semirigid or flexible<br>
(polymer) substrate forming part of the assembly of the element having variable<br>
optical properties. The term "thin layer" is understood to mean a layer of<br>
interferential thickness (of less than 1 urn, especially between 1 and 100 nm or 2<br>
and 50 nm). It may also be a superposition of thin layers, at least one of which is<br>
absorbent in the visible. It may, for example, consist of layers based on nickel<br>
and/or iron and/or chromium oxide, that may be deposited by a thermal<br>
decomposition technique (pyrolysis in gas phase, in the form of powder or in<br>
liquid phase), by a vacuum technique (sputtering, especially sputtering enhanced<br>
by a magnetic field) or by sol-gel. When a sputtering process is used, the<br>
sputtering may be reactive in the presence of oxidizing elements of the O2 type,<br>
using metal targets or substoichiometric oxide targets, or it may be nonreactive<br>
using oxide targets. The absorbent layer may also be essentially metallic, for<br>
example based on one of the following metals: nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), Ni-Cr<br>
alloy, steel, Inconel alloy, Au or Au alloy, silver (Ag) or Ag alloy, or copper. It is<br>
therefore preferably deposited by nonreactive sputtering. It may also be based<br>
on one or more metal nitrides, of the TiN or ZrN type, which may be deposited<br>
by CVD or by reactive sputtering in the presence of nitriding elements using<br>
metal targets. The absorbent layer may also be based on an electrochromic<br>
material, such as optionally hydrated tungsten oxide, optionally hydrated nickel<br>
oxide and optionally hydrated iridium or tantalum oxide.<br>
If the system (a) is a liquid-crystal system, another type of absorbent<br>
element (b) consists in using a dye within the functional film. Most particularly,<br>
this may be one of the dichroic dyes that are dissolved within the liquid-crystal<br>
droplets and/or in the medium in which they are dispersed.<br>
These dichroic dyes are, for example, chosen from the family of<br>
diazoquinone derivatives or from that of anthraquinone derivatives. The<br>
percentage or weight of dye with respect to the liquid crystals, when this is<br>
dissolved therein, is preferably between 0.1 and 5%, especially between 0.5 and<br>
2%. in the variant in which the dye is in the medium, its percentage by weight<br>
with respect to the medium may be between 20 and 30% for example.<br>
If an electrically controllable system (a) is used, the absorbent element<br>
may be an electrically conducting absorbent layer forming part of one of the<br>
electrodes which supply the functional film with electricity. It may be a layer<br>
based on a conducting metal oxide (which can be deposited by pyrolysis or by<br>
sputtering, as in the case of the absorbent layer mentioned above). The oxide<br>
(or mixture of oxides) is preferably doped. The fact that it is absorbent comes,<br>
in a first variant, from the fact that it is in the reduced and/or oxygen-<br>
substoichiometric state (while still remaining an electrical conductor). For<br>
example, it may consist of indium oxide (doped with tin) and reduced, a tin<br>
oxide (for example doped with fluorine) and reduced, or a zinc oxide (for<br>
example doped with Al) and reduced. It may also consist of conducting oxides<br>
which are intrinsically absorbent, without being in the reduced state: this is the<br>
case with antimony-doped tin oxide which, at 30 nm, may have a light<br>
absorption A from 10 to about 62%, depending on the percentage of dopant (2.5<br>
to 10% of dopant).<br>
In a second variant, the fact that the conducting layer forming part of the<br>
electrode is absorbent steins from the combination of its chemical nature and<br>
the choice of its thickness. Thus, for a layer based on a doped metal oxide, the<br>
layer may become sufficiently absorbent for the invention if it is sufficiently<br>
thick. It is also possible to choose a layer based on a metal of the Ni, Cr or NiCr<br>
type, or on a metal nitride (TiN, ZrN, etc.), the thickness of which is suitably<br>
adjusted (for example, a TiN layer of about 25 nm which has a light absorption<br>
of about 50%).<br>
The absorbent element may also be a film based on a plastic, which is<br>
absorbent and can be calendered, for example, to a clear substrate, especially a<br>
clear glass.<br>
According to the invention, the element having optical properties,<br>
because of the presence of the one or more absorbent elements (b), sees its<br>
light absorption Al increase by at least 5% and/or sees its light reflection RL<br>
decrease by at (east 5%, especially at least 8%.<br>
The element having optical properties in its entirety has a light<br>
transmission TL of especially between 10 and 50%, preferably between 20 and<br>
40%: this TL range is suitable for obtaining the desired absorption effect while<br>
maintaining a sufficient level of light transmission, the latter point being most<br>
particularly important when the electrically controllable variable scattering<br>
system is in the on state, that is to say in the energized and transparent state.<br>
The preferred embodiment according to the invention consists of the<br>
element having variable optical properties which also includes:<br>
(c) at least one element antireflecting in the visible (called<br>
antireflection coating in the rest of the text).<br>
The antireflection element (c) may consist, according to a first variant, of<br>
an alternation of thin layers of interferential thickness having high and low<br>
refractive indices, in a (high-index layer/low-index layer),, sequence, where<br>
n £ 1. A high-index/low-index sequence, most particularly the first one starting<br>
from the substrate on which the antireflection coating lies, may be replaced<br>
with an intermediate-index layer of a material. Each "layer" may be a<br>
monolayer or a superposition of several layers having high or low indices<br>
respectively. The layers may be deposited by pyrolysis or by sputtering, like the<br>
absorbent layers mentioned previously.<br>
The low-index layers may be made of S102, AI203 or a mixture. The high-<br>
index layers may be made of SnO2, S13N4, Tio2, ND2O5, AIN, ZnO. The<br>
intermediate-layers may be a mixture of high-index and low-index oxides or<br>
SiON. Examples of suitable antireflection coatings are described in the patents<br>
EP-728 712, EP-911 302, WO 97/43224, WO 00/72053 and FR 99/14423. One<br>
example is that sold under the name VISION LITE by Saint-Gobain Glass. It may<br>
especially be a stack of the St3N4 or SnOz/SiOz/Si3N4 or Nb2Os/Sio2 type (it being<br>
possible for the SiO2 to include a little metal of the aluminum type or a little<br>
boron, especially if it is obtained by sputtering). According to one advantageous<br>
embodiment, the antireflection coating may include an absorbent layer, for<br>
example one made of a nitride of the TiN or ZrN type: there are thus two<br>
functions at the same time, with a single multilayer stack in which the layers are<br>
deposited one after another by the same deposition method, namely the anti-<br>
reflection effect and absorption.<br>
According to a second variant, the antireflection element is an<br>
antireflection film that can be applied by calendering it to the surface of a<br>
substrate of the glass or plastic type. For example, it may be a polyethylene<br>
terephthalate (PET) film provided with an antireflection coating or with a film of<br>
cellulose triacetate.<br>
In the two variants, the antireflection coating is effective when it is<br>
deposited on the external face of at least one of the "external" substrates of the<br>
element having variable optical properties (the term "external substrate" is<br>
understood to mean that one which delimits the element, one face of which is<br>
accessible and turned toward the outside). The addition of at least one<br>
antireflection element is very advantageous within the context of application to<br>
a backprojection screen for transmission. This is because it will reduce the light<br>
reflection, preferably of that external face of the element in its entirety which<br>
is intended to be turned toward the viewer. It will therefore make it possible to<br>
reduce the light reflection coming from the unwanted illumination on the<br>
viewer's side. This effect is also beneficial, but much less pronounced, if it is<br>
placed on that external face which will be on the projector's side.<br>
According to a third variant, the same type of antireflection effect is<br>
obtained by superficially modifying the external surface of at least one of these<br>
external substrates: this modification may consist of surface texturizing, or<br>
surface etching leaving calibrated excrescences, as described in patent<br>
FR 00/08842 filed on July 6, 2000: at increasing depth, there is (ess and less<br>
material and more and more air, thereby creating, on the surface of the<br>
material (especially glass), an intermediate-index layer between the material in<br>
question and the air, hence an antireflection effect.<br>
At first glance, it would seem to be surprising to combine, in one and the<br>
same element, an absorbent component absorbing in the visible (which will<br>
therefore help to lower the level of light transmission) and an antireflection<br>
component (which will on the contrary tend to increase the transmission in the<br>
visible to the detriment of reflection). In fact, the inventors have noticed that<br>
there is a synergy between these two components, which makes it possible to<br>
achieve excellent contrast levels when the overall element is used as a<br>
backprojection screen.<br>
The configuration of the "overall" element of the invention may vary<br>
greatly: it is possible to use a glazing structure in the narrow sense of the term,<br>
that is to say using at least one glass substrate. In particular, it may have one,<br>
two or three glass substrates. It is also possible to replace all or some of these<br>
glass substrates with other rigid substrates of the polycarbonate type.<br>
It is even possible to envision the case in which the element in its entirety<br>
does not contain any rigid substrates, and comprises for example only the<br>
functional film, of the liquid-crystal type, sandwiched between two sheets of<br>
flexible polymer which are provided with electrodes (of the doped SnO2/PET or<br>
ITO/PET type), without including, of course, the connection elements and the<br>
possible peripheral seals.<br>
A flexible screen is therefore obtained which can be wound up or<br>
tensioned by a frame or by other suitable tensioning means, as required, or it<br>
may be placed in the immediate vicinity of a conventional glazing assembly.<br>
It is possible to have laminated glazing structures, especially of the type:<br><d optional antireflection coating polymer sheet></d>
variable tight scattering system/thermoplastic polymer sheet(s)/glass 2/optional<br>
antireflection coating, or else;<br> - optional antireflection coating/glass 1 /thermoplastic polymer sheet(s)/<br>
variable light scattering system/thermoplastic polymer sheet(s)/glass<br>
2/thermoplastic polymer sheet(s)/glass 3/optional antireflection coating.<br>
A single-glass configuration may be of the following type:<br>
(3)- optional antireflection coating/glass 1 /thermoplastic polymer sheet(s)/<br>
variable light scattering system/optional protective polymer sheet (s).<br>
In these configurations, it is the glass 1 and/or glass 2 and/or glass 3<br>
which may be bulk-tinted and/or provided with an absorbent layer, or one of the<br>
thermoplastic polymer sheets may be bulk-tinted.<br>
As indicated above, a favorable configuration is one in which the glass<br>
closest to the viewer is this absorbent glass (absorbing by bulk coloration or by<br>
addition of a layer).<br>
A preferred variant of this configuration is one in which this absorbent<br>
glass is provided with an antireflection coating.<br>
The subject of the invention is the element in its entirety described above<br>
(which may include all the connections, power supplies, seals, peripheral frame<br>
which are known per se and suitable for this type of product), this element<br>
forming part of a backprojection screen operating in transmission.<br>
The invention will be described below in greater detail with the aid of the<br>
appended figures which show:<br>
figure 1: a laminated glazing assembly according to the invention placed on<br>
two glass substrates,<br>
figure 2: a laminated glazing assembly according to the invention based on<br>
three glass substrates.<br>
These figures are extremely diagrammatic and have not been drawn to<br>
scale in order to make them easier to examine.<br>
In all the examples that follow, the liquid-crystal system 1 has the<br>
following configuration: PET sheet/electrode/functional film/electrode/PET<br>
sheet, the combination being actually used in PRIVA-LITE glazing assemblies<br>
Saint-Gobain Glass.<br>
The functional film comprising the liquid emulsion based on nematic liquid<br>
crystals has a thickness of about 10 to 30 mm (preferably 20 to 25 micrometers).<br>
The PET sheets have a thickness of about 175 mm. The two electrodes consist of<br>
ITO (tin-doped indium oxide) having a resistivity of about 100 ohms per square.<br>
Given below are a few details about the liquid crystals and their medium<br>
that can be used. With regard to the liquid crystals, these may be of the NCAP<br>
type, especially those used in PRIVA-LITE glazing assemblies, or of the PDLC<br>
type, which were mentioned above. As a general rule, their birefringence is<br>
between 0.1 and 0.2; it can vary, especially according to the medium used,<br>
around 0.1 if the polymer of the medium is of the polyurethane (PU) type, and<br>
around 0.2 if it is of the polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) type.<br>
The medium is in fact preferably based on a polymer of the PU (latex)<br>
family and /or PVA family, the medium generally being prepared in aqueous<br>
phase with a polymer proportion of 15 to 50% by weight with respect to water.<br>
The elements active as regards light scattering are advantageously in the<br>
form of droplets having a mean diameter of between 0.5 and 3 mm, especially<br>
between 1 and 2.5 mm, these being dispersed in the medium. The droplet size<br>
depends on a number of parameters, including especially the emulsifiability of<br>
the active elements in the medium in question. Preferably, these droplets<br>
represent between 120 and 220% by weight, especially between 150 and 200% by<br>
weight, of the medium, excluding the generally aqueous solvent for said<br>
medium.<br>
It is particularly preferable to choose liquid crystals in the form of<br>
droplets having a diameter of about 2.5 mm when the medium is based on a<br>
polyurethane latex (birefringence of about 0.1) and with a diameter of about<br>
1 mm when the medium is instead based on polyvinyl alcohol (birefringence of<br>
about 0.2).<br>
The power uses voltages of between 0 and 110 V.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 - Comparative Example<br>
This is a laminated glazing assembly based on two glass substrates<br>
according to figure 1, having the configuration:<br>
Clear glass 3/EVA 4/predefined liquid-crystal system 1/EVA 5/<br>
clear glass 2,<br>
the clear glass substrates being made of standard silica-soda-lime glass sold by<br>
Saint-Gobain Glass under the name PLANILUX with a thickness of 2 mm. The EVA<br>
(ethylene-vinyl acetate) sheet has a thickness of 380 micrometers.<br>
The liquid-crystal system is laminated in a known manner by applying<br>
pressure and/or heating to around 100'C.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
This is a laminated glazing assembly of the same configuration as example<br>
1, but the clear glass 2 has been replaced with a bulk-colored glass sold under<br>
the name VENUS VG10 by Saint-Gobain Glass with a thickness of 2.1 mm. This<br>
VENUS glass has the following characteristics: TL between 25 and 30%; in the<br>
case of the glass used here, the TL is 26.6% (under illuminant D65) and it is gray in<br>
color.<br><br>
This glazing is illustrated by figure 1, with the liquid-crystal system 1, the<br>
bulk-tinted glass 2, the dear glass 3 and the two EVA sheets 4, 5. Depicted<br>
schematically is atso the projector for showing the most judicious way of placing<br>
the screen with respect to said projector (with the bulk-tinted glass on the<br>
opposite side to said projector).<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Example 3 has a three-glass configuration according to figure 2: compared<br>
with the configuration of figure 1, a clear glass 8 with a thickness of 4 mm,<br>
laminated to the glass 2 and provided on the external face with an antireflection<br>
coating 7, is added. This antireflection coating is composed of the following<br>
multilayer stack:<br>
Sn02/Si02/Nb205/Al:Si02.<br>
This coating is deposited in a known manner on the glass by<br>
magnetic-field-enhanced sputtering.<br>
Figure 2 thus illustrates another embodiment, in which the laminated<br>
glazing assembly has three glass substrates: added to the configuration according<br>
to figure 1, on the bulk-tinted glass 2 side, is a thermoplastic insert sheet 6<br>
made of polyurethane with a thickness of 0.76 mm, making it possible to<br>
laminate the third glass 8, which is a clear glass identical to the clear glass 3. If<br>
an antireflection coating 7 is used, it is therefore on the external face of this<br>
third glass 8 that it is placed.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Example 4 repeats the configuration of example 3, and adds a second<br>
antireflection coating 7 (cf. figure 2) on the external face of the clear glass 3.<br>
The coating T is identical to the coating 7 of example 3. In this example, the<br>
glass substrates 3 and 8 have a thickness of 4 mm.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 5 repeats the configuration of the two-glass example 2 according<br>
to figure 2, but substitutes the bulk-colored VENUS glass 2 with another bulk-<br>
tinted glass 2 having a thickness of 5 mm and sold by Saint-Gobain Glass under<br>
the name PARSOL GRIS. Its characteristics are: TL: 48.5%; color: gray.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Example 6 is a three-glass configuration according to figure 2, again using<br>
as glass 2 the tinted glass of example 5, and adding a 4 mm clear glass 8<br>
provided with an antireflection coating 7, as in example 3.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Example 7 repeats the configuration of example 6, and adds an<br>
antireflection coating 7 (identical to that of example 4) to the external face of<br>
the clear glass 3. In this example, the clear glass substrates 3 and 8 each have a<br>
thickness of 4 mm.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
This example is a laminated glazing assembly of the same configuration as<br>
in example 2, to which is added, by calendering to the external face of the<br>
tinted glass 2, an antireflection film 7 (plastic film) sold by Murei Danki under<br>
the reference "ReaLook 2201".<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
This example is a laminated glazing assembly of the same configuration as<br>
in example 5, to which is added, by calendering to the external face of the<br>
tinted glass 2, an antireflection film 7 identical to that used in example 8.<br>
Table 1 below summarizes, for these nine examples:<br>
- the type of glass and/or the number of antireflection coatings used;<br>
- their light transmission measured under the D65 illuminant in the off state,<br>
TL.off, that is to say with no voltage, and in the on state, TLon, that is to say when<br>
a maximum voltage of 110 V is applied to the functional film;<br>
- their light reflection measured under the D65 illuminant, on the tinted glass side<br>
(the viewer's side when referring to the figures), in the off state, Rl,off, and in<br>
the on state, Rl.,on.<br>
From these results, it may be seen that the use of a tinted glass instead of<br>
a dear glass makes it possible to lower the TL level both in the on state and in<br>
the off state very significantly (almost 50% in the case of the VENUS glass and<br>
more than 30% in the case of the PARSOL GRIS glass). At the same time, it allows<br>
the Rl in the on state and in the off state to be substantially lowered (by about 8<br>
to 10%, whether with the VENUS glass or with the PARSOL glass), which is<br>
spectacular. It is not obvious that the increase in light absorption provided by<br>
the bulk-tinted glass is accomplished both to the detriment of the light<br>
transmission and to the light reflection.<br>
The combined use of a tinted glass and an antireflection coating, the<br>
antireflection coating preferably being on the tinted glass, allows the level of Rl<br>
to be lowered even further, by about 4 to 6%, in order to reach truly very low<br>
values (of the order of 1 to 3%). Finally, the use of a second antireflection<br>
coating (on the clear glass) allows the level of RL of the glazing to be lowered<br>
even further.<br>
It should be noted that in the three-glass configuration, the position of the<br>
glass substrates 2 and 8 may be reversed, that is to say the bulk-colored glass<br>
may be placed as the external glass, the intermediate glass being the clear glass.<br>
Of course, it is better to have two-glass structures rather than three-glass<br>
structures, especially in terms of weight, size and cost. However, it is more<br>
common to deposit stacks of thin antireflection layers on a clear glass than on an<br>
absorbent glass, and it may therefore be simpler from an industrial standpoint to<br>
adopt the three-glass configuration.<br>
