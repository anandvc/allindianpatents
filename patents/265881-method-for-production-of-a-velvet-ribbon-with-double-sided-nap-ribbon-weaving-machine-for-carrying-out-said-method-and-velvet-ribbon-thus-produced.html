Method for production of a velvet ribbon with double-sided nap, ribbon weaving machine for carrying out said method and velvet ribbon thus produced<br>
Technical field<br>
The invention relates to a method for the production of a velvet ribbon with a double-sided nap, according to claim 1, a ribbon weaving machine for carrying out said method, according to claim 5, and a velvet ribbon thus produced, according to claims 14 and 15.<br>
Prior art<br>
It is known from CH 554 431 to produce velvet ribbons on a shuttleless ribbon weaving machine, two webs being produced which lie one above the other at a distance and are connected to one another by means of nap threads. The nap threads are severed at half the distance between the individual webs, and two velvet ribbons having a nap on the one side are obtained. The publication contains no indications as to the possibility of producing a double-sided velvet ribbon.<br>
Presentation of the invention<br>
The object of the invention is to specify a method for production of a double-sided velvet ribbon and a ribbon weaving machine for carrying out such a method and also to provide a double-sided velvet ribbon produced according to the method and on the ribbon weaving machine.<br>
The object is achieved, according to the invention, by means of:<br>
a)	a method for production of a velvet ribbon, as claimed in claim 1;<br>
b)	a ribbon weaving machine for carrying out said<br><br>
method, as claimed in claim 5; and<br>
c)   a velvet ribbon according to claims 14 and 15.<br>
Since  three webs  lying one above the  other  at  a distance from one another are woven and are connected to one another by means of nap threads, a middle web, which has nap threads on both sides and an upper and a lower web, in each case provided with a nap on one side only, are obtained. First, at a first cutting device, the nap threads are cut through between the middle web and a first web, and then, at a second cutting device, the nap threads are severed between the middle web and the  second web.  The middle web  then provides  the desired two-sided velvet ribbon, while the upper and the lower web are discharged as waste.<br>
Various methods are suitable for production; the method as claimed in claim 2 is particularly advantageous, in which the triple web is produced on a needle ribbon weaving machine. It is conceivable for the triple web to be further processed independently of the ribbon weaving machine; it is more advantageous, however, if, as claimed in claim 3, the cutting of the nap threads is carried out immediately after weaving on the ribbon weaving machine. It is basically possible to carry out the cutting of the nap threads by means of two cutting devices which are independent of one another and which are arranged in succession. It is more advantageous if, according to claim 4, the first and the second cutting device are arranged next to one another, the web, once cut, having to be returned from the first cutting device to the second cutting device. This makes it possible to have a simple and particularly short form of construction of the cutting device.<br>
The ribbon weaving machine for production of the ribbon has, according to claim 5, three weaving stations lying one above the other and at a distance from one another,<br><br>
each with a weft insertion member and a shedding device for opening three sheds and for laying nap threads connecting the weaving stations. The weaving stations are followed by a first cutting device for cutting the nap threads between the middle web and a first web and by a second cutting device for cutting the nap threads between the middle web and the second web.<br>
In order to make it possible to cut the nap threads exactly to a specific nap height, it is advantageous, according to claim 6, if guides for the web, which are adjustable in the level and/or in the distance from one another, are arranged in each case at the cutting devices.<br>
A ribbon weaving machine as claimed in claim 7 is particularly advantageous, the first and the second cutting device being arranged next to one another, and the first cutting device being assigned deflection means for returning the web to the second cutting device. This makes it possible, according to claim 8, to assign a common cutting member to both cutting devices- In this case, according to claim 9, the cutting member may be designed as a cutting knife driven back and forth. According to claim 10, a cutting member which is designed as a rotating cutting band is also possible. Expediently, according to claim 11, the cutting members are assigned a grinding device, as is known from CH 554 431.<br>
According to claim 12, the cutting devices are assigned in each case a discharge device for discharging the separated web which, as a rule, is removed as waste.<br>
Various ribbon weaving machines are suitable for carrying out the method, but, as claimed in claim 13, a needle ribbon weaving machine with three weft insertion needles arranged one above the other is particularly<br><br>
advantageous.<br>
The novel double-sided velvet ribbon produced as claimed in claim 14 or 15 makes it possible to have novel and improved applications•<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention are described in more detail below with reference to diagrammatic drawings in which:<br>
figure 1 shows a side view of a first ribbon weaving machine for producing a double-sided velvet ribbon;<br>
figure 2  shows a top view of a second ribbon weaving machine for producing a double-sided velvet ribbons-figure 3  shows the ribbon weaving machine of figure 2<br>
in the view III-III of figure 2; and<br>
figure 4  shows the ribbon weaving machine of figure 2<br>
in the view IV-IV of figure 2.<br>
Ways of implementing the invention<br>
Figure 1 shows a ribbon weaving machine 2, in which, between an upper guide plate 4 and a lower guide plate 6, a middle web 8, a lower web 10 and an upper web 12 are produced which are connected to one another by means of nap threads 14 running transversely with respect to the web plane. For this purpose, in a shedding device 16, the warp threads 18 are guided by means of heddles 2 0 such that three sheds 22, 24 and 2 6 are obtained, into which weft threads 28, 30 and 32 are. inserted in each case. The weft threads are expediently<br><br>
inserted by means of weft needles, not illustrated in any more detail, of a ribbon weaving machine, the weft needles being arranged one above the other according to the weft threads 28, 30 and 32 to be supplied and jointly taking effect simultaneously. The weft threads 28, 30 and 32 are beaten up by means of a reed 34 at the three weaving stations 31 lying one above the other. By the distance between the guide plates 4, 6 being varied by means of actuating devices 33, 35 indicated diagrammatically, the distance between the webs 8, 10 and 12 and consequently the height of the nap threads 14 can be adjusted.<br>
The weaving stations 31 are followed by a first cutting device 36 having a guide 38 and a cutting member 4 0 which severs the nap threads 14a between the middle web 8 and the upper web 12. The upper web 12 is discharged as waste by means of a discharge device 42 which has a needle roller 44. The first cutting device 36 is followed by a second lower cutting device 46 which likewise has a guide 48 and a cutting member 50. It severs the nap threads 14b between the middle web 8 and the lower web 10. The lower web 10 is . discharged as waste by means of a discharge device 52 which again has a needle roller 54. The remaining middle web 8 has a two-sided nap 56, 58 and is discharged via a discharge device 60. This, too, preferably has a needle roller 62 which is fitted with needles 64 for the reliable discharge of the velvet ribbon 8 produced.<br>
Figures 2 to 4 show a further ribbon weaving machine which, in principle, is constructed correspondingly to the first ribbon weaving machine of figure 1, and therefore identical parts are given the same reference symbols. In contrast to the ribbon weaving machine of figure 1, in the ribbon weaving machine of figures 2 to 4 the cutting devices 36a, 4 6a are not arranged independently of one another, but next to one another.<br><br>
and have a common cutting member 66 which is designed as a knife and is driven back and forth by means of a drive 68,<br>
The triple web 8, 10, 12, from the weaving station 31 is supplied, downstream of a first guide 70, to a first cutting device 36a which has two guide plates 72, 74. The lower guide plate 72 is fixed and the upper guide plate 7 4 is adjustable in its distance from the lower guide plate 72 by means of an actuating device 7 6 indicated. At the first cutting device 36a, the cut-off lower web 10 is discharged downward by means of a discharge device 42a and a corresponding needle roller 44a.<br>
The middle web 8, with the upper web 12 lying above it, is supplied, offset laterally, to a first deflecting roller 78 which is designed as a needle roller and which deflects it rearward and, further, is supplied, offset laterally, via a first fixed guide 80 to a second straightening guide 82, at which it is deflected until it is oriented parallel to the triple web 8, 10, 12, It is supplied via two further deflecting rollers 84, 86 to the second cutting device 46a, This has, in turn, a lower guide plate 88 and an upper guide plate 90 which are adjustable in height and/or in the distance between one another by means of actuating devices 92, 94 indicated. In particular, the lower guide plate 88 of the second cutting device 46a must be set with respect to the guide plates 72 of the first cutting device at a height such that the middle web 8 has the same nap height on both sides, since the same cutting member 66 is used for both cutting devices 36a, 46a, but the thickness of the webs including the nap height, is different. At the second cutting device 46a, the upper web 12 is separated from the middle web 8, The upper web 12, in turn, is removed as waste by- the discharge device 52a having the needle roller 54a. The<br><br>
middle web 8 is discharged as a double-sided velvet ribbon, with a nap 56, 58 on both sides, by means of a discharge device 60 which again contains a needle roller 62,<br>
In the present exemplary embodiment, the deflecting roller 78 of the deflection device and the needle roller 54a of the discharge device 52a are formed in one piece. The needle roller 44a of the discharge device 42a is likewise in one piece with the needle roller 62a of the discharge device 60a.<br>
The needle rollers illustrated may individually or all be replaced by other rollers having surfaces with a sufficiently good grip, such as, for example, those which have a roughened surface or are provided with a rubber clothing.<br>
The upper or lower webs which, as a rule, are discharged as waste may, if appropriate, also be used as one-sided velvet ribbons.<br><br>
