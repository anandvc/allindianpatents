RECORDING INK, INK CARTRIDGE, INK MEDIA SET, INK-JET<br>
RECORDING METHOD AND INK-JET RECORDING<br>
APPARATUS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a recording ink, an ink<br>
media set, an ink cartridge, an ink-jet recording method, an<br>
ink-jet recording apparatus and an ink recorded matter.<br>
Specifically, the present invention relates to an ink which is<br>
excellent in image quality to plain paper, in adaptability to<br>
high-speed printing, in storage stability and in ejection stability<br>
and is harmless to a maintenance device for an ink ejection<br>
device; an ink cartridge; and a recording method, a recording<br>
apparatus and an ink recorded matter which use the ink.<br>
Background Art<br>
Ink-jet printers have been rapidly becoming commonplace<br>
in recent years for the reasons that printing on plain paper is<br>
enabled, colorization can be facilitated, the ink-jet printers are<br>
compact and inexpensive, running costs are low, and so forth.<br>
The properties generally required for an ink-jet recording ink are<br>
exemplified by color tone, image density, bleeding, etc. for<br>
achieving high image quality; dissolution/dispersion stability,<br><br>
storage stability, ejection stability, etc. of a colorant in the ink for<br>
achieving reliability", water resistance, light resistance, etc. for<br>
securing storage stability of recorded images; and quick-drying<br>
properties of the ink for achieving a high-speed process.<br>
Accordingly, a variety of proposals have been put forward in<br>
attempts to satisfy these requirements.<br>
As for colorants of ink-jet recording inks, dye inks were<br>
mainly used at an early stage in view of their favorable<br>
color-developing ability, high reliability, etc.", in recent years,<br>
however, note has also been taken of ink compositions using<br>
pigments such as carbon black because recorded images can<br>
thereby have light resistance and water resistance.<br>
Also, for achievement of increase in printing quality and of<br>
high-speed printing, droplets of inks tend to be miniaturized<br>
these days, and thus the hole diameters of nozzles tend to be<br>
reduced as well.<br>
Therefore, it is rather difficult to secure ejection stability<br>
in printers in which pigments are used as colorants and the hole<br>
diameters of nozzles are reduced; and despite many attempts to<br>
balance ejection stability and other properties of inks, sufficient<br>
measures have not been taken, as things stand.<br>
Hitherto, for improvement in the reliability of printers,<br>
inks have been designed such that increase in viscosity can be<br>
restrained as much as possible. For instance, Patent Literature<br><br>
1 discloses that by not allowing the viscosity and particle<br>
diameter of an ink to increase more than ten-fold and more than<br>
three-fold respectively when the ink is twice as concentrated, the<br>
ink is not restrained by flocculation of pigment from spreading<br>
and thus it is possible to prevent pinholes from arising; however,<br>
it is difficult for this ink to form high-quality images on plain<br>
paper. Patent Literature 2 discloses an ink wherein after<br>
volatile components in the ink have evaporated, the remainder is<br>
a liquid, and the viscosity of the remainder is equal to or less<br>
than ten times the initial viscosity; however, although this ink is<br>
a dye ink and is therefore highly reliable, it is inferior in image<br>
quality on plain paper. Patent Literature 3 discloses an ink<br>
characterized by gelating or solidifying when left to stand at a<br>
temperature of 25°C and a relative humidity of 50% until it does<br>
not substantially change in weight, and becoming a liquid when<br>
left to stand for 24hr at a temperature of 30°C and a relative<br>
humidity of 50%; however, although this ink is a dye ink and is<br>
therefore highly reliable, it is inferior in drying property and<br>
image quality on plain paper. Patent Literature 4 discloses a<br>
method of securing ejection stability by means of an ink using a<br>
sugar alcohol such as maltitol or lactitol; however, the sugar<br>
alcohol instanced is a solid, and it is hardly possible for the sugar<br>
alcohol-based ink to secure ejection stability sufficiently. Patent<br>
Literature 5 discloses an ink wherein the rate of increase in<br><br>
viscosity (mPa.s/%) caused by evaporation of moisture of an ink is<br>
5.0 or less when, the amount of evaporation of moisture is 30wt%<br>
or less to the total weight of the ink, and the rate of increase in<br>
viscosity attains a value of greater than 50 when the amount of<br>
evaporation of moisture is between 30% by weight and 45% by<br>
weight, and wherein when the rate of increase in viscosity stands<br>
at a value of greater than 50, the average particle diameter of a<br>
colorant in the ink is equal to or less than five times the initial<br>
average particle diameter and is 0.8 µm or less. The ink of<br>
Patent Literature 5 has favorable drying properties and exhibits<br>
adaptability to high-speed printing and high printing quality on<br>
plain paper to be sure, but the ink dries so quickly as to be<br>
inferior in ejection stability, and further, causes troubles such as<br>
breakage of a maintenance device (a wiper cleaner, an ink<br>
sweeping portion, etc.) for an ink ejection device, which stems<br>
from adhesion of waste ink therein. As described above, in order<br>
to secure high-speed printing and high printing quality, it is<br>
necessary to use an ink having a high viscosity; however, it is<br>
difficult for the ink having a high viscosity to secure reliability<br>
and handle ability, as things stand.<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
The present invention is aimed at solving the problems in<br>
related art and achieving the following object. Specifically, an<br>
object of the present invention is to provide an ink which is<br>
excellent in image quality to plain paper, in adaptability to<br>
high-speed printing, in storage stability and in ejection stability<br>
and is harmless to a maintenance device for an ink ejection<br>
device; an ink cartridge; and a recording method, a recording<br>
apparatus and an ink recorded matter which use the ink.<br>
The ink of the present invention is characterized in that<br>
when 2.5g of the ink is weighed, placed in a glass Petri dish<br>
having a diameter of 33mm and stored for 24hr at a temperature<br>
of 50°C±0.5°C and a humidity of 12%±5%, the evaporation rate of<br>
a solvent with respect to the total weight of the ink is 50% by<br>
weight or more, and an ink residue has a viscosity of 20,000mPa.s<br>
or greater, and also characterized in that by storing the ink<br>
residue for 6hr at a temperature of 23°C±0.5°C and a high<br>
humidity of 95%±3% to allow it to absorb moisture, the amount of<br>
moisture contained in the ink residue becomes 30% by weight to<br>
40% by weight, in which case the ink residue has a viscosity of<br>
less than 500mPa.s. Thus, the ink is thickened by evaporation<br><br>
of the solvent that occurs before the ink comes into contact with<br>
paper after ejected from a nozzle and at the time when it comes<br>
into contact with the paper, thereby enabling high-quality images<br>
to be formed at high speed on plain paper as well. Also, since<br>
the amount of moisture contained in the ink residue that has<br>
absorbed moisture is 30% by weight to 40% by weight, in which<br>
case the ink residue has a viscosity of less than 500mPa.s, it is<br>
possible to achieve securement of ejection stability, and<br>
prevention of breakage of a maintenance device for an ink<br>
ejection device caused by adhesion of waste ink in the<br>
maintenance device, which are included in the object of the<br>
present invention, and thus long-term reliability can be secured.<br>
An ink used for obtaining an ink having the features of the<br>
present invention is mainly composed of a colorant, a wetting<br>
agent, a surfactant, a penetrant and a water-dispersible resin,<br>
and how these components are combined and the compounding<br>
ratios thereof are important. Further, addition of a particular<br>
pH adjuster as a pigment agglomeration preventing agent makes<br>
it possible to obtain a highly-reliable ink whereby higher-quality<br>
images can be produced.<br>
The following explains one example of a method for<br>
producing "an ink wherein the evaporation rate of a solvent of the<br>
ink with respect to the total weight of the ink is 50% by weight or<br>
more, and an ink residue has a viscosity of 20,000mPa.s or<br><br>
greater (a state in which, there is almost no fluidity), and wherein<br>
by leaving the ink residue to stand at high humidity to allow it to<br>
absorb moisture, the amount of moisture contained in the ink<br>
residue becomes 30% by weight to 40% by weight, in which case<br>
the ink residue has a viscosity of less than 500mPa.s" mentioned<br>
above. It is useful to prepare an appropriate amount of a<br>
wetting agent A (a polyhydric alcohol that has an equilibrium<br>
moisture content of 30% by weight or more at a temperature of<br>
23°C and a relative humidity of 80%) which has a very high<br>
boiling point and viscosity in comparison with water and an<br>
appropriate amount of a wetting agent B which has a somewhat<br>
high boiling point and viscosity, and to mix water with these<br>
wetting agents (it goes without saying that this method merely<br>
represents one example for facilitating understanding of the<br>
present invention and that the present invention is not limited<br>
thereto). Besides, use of a compound which is high in<br>
coordinating ability, hydrogen-bonding ability and equilibrium<br>
moisture content in the liquid phase is effective, and it is<br>
desirable to consider the amount of the colorant added, the<br>
affinity between the colorant and dispersion medium components,<br>
effects caused by the addition of the surfactant and the penetrant,<br>
and the like.<br>
Meanwhile, as to an ink wherein the evaporation rate of a<br>
solvent of the ink with respect to the total weight of the ink is<br><br>
50% by weight or more, and an ink residue has a viscosity of<br>
20,000mPas or greater (a state in which there is no fluidity), and<br>
wherein by leaving the ink residue to stand at high humidity to<br>
allow it to absorb moisture, the amount of moisture contained in<br>
the ink residue becomes 30% by weight to 40% by weight, in<br>
which case the ink residue has a viscosity of over 500mPas, the<br>
ink is inferior in ejection stability and may possibly cause, for<br>
example, breakage of a maintenance device for an ink ejection<br>
device, caused by adhesion of waste ink in the maintenance<br>
device.<br>
Furthermore, the ink of the present invention causes less<br>
beading (nonuniformity of density), has superior drying<br>
properties and makes it possible to form high-quality images<br>
suitable for printing image quality, when general-purpose<br>
printing paper (a recording medium with low ink-absorbing<br>
ability, including a support, and a coating layer applied onto at<br>
least one surface of the support, in which the amount of purified<br>
water transferred to the recording medium at a contact period of<br>
100ms measured by a dynamic scanning absorptometer is 2ml/m2<br>
to 35ml/m2 and the amount of purified water transferred to the<br>
recording medium at a contact period of 400ms measured by the<br>
dynamic scanning absorptometer is 3ml/m2 to 40ml/m2) is used.<br> An ink-jet recording ink including a colorant dispersible in<br>
water, a water-soluble organic solvent used as a wetting agent, a<br><br>
surfactant, a penetrant, a water-dispersible resin, and water,<br>

dish having a diameter of 33mm and stored for 24hr at a<br>

evaporation rate of a solvent in the ink is 50% by weight or more,<br>
and an ink residue has a viscosity of 20,000mPa.s or greater, and<br>
wherein by storing the ink residue for 6hr at a temperature of<br>
23°C±0.5°C and a high humidity of 95%±3% to allow it to absorb<br>
moisture, the amount of moisture contained in the ink residue<br>
becomes 30% by weight to 40% by weight, in which case the ink<br>
residue has a viscosity of less than 500mPa.s; where the<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The recording ink of the present invention includes water,<br>
a colorant, a water-soluble organic solvent (a wetting agent), a<br>
surfactant, a penetrant and a water-dispersible resin, and<br>
further includes other components in accordance with the<br>
necessity.<br>
— Water-soluble Organic Solvent (Wetting Agent) -<br>
The recording ink of the present invention includes at<br>
least one polyhydric alcohol that has an equilibrium moisture<br>
content of 30% by weight or more at a temperature of 23°C and a<br>
relative humidity of 80%. For instance, as described above, it is<br>
desirable for the recording ink to contain a wetting agent A which<br>
has a very high equilibrium moisture content and a very high<br>
boiling point (the wetting agent A has an equilibrium moisture<br>
content of 30% by weight or more at a temperature of 23°C and a<br>
relative humidity of 80% and has a boiling point of 250°C or<br>
higher, with the equilibrium moisture content preferably being<br>
40% by weight or more) and a wetting agent B which has a high<br>
equilibrium moisture content but has a relatively low boiling<br><br>
point (the wetting agent B has an equilibrium moisture content of<br>
30% by weight or more at a temperature of 23°C and a relative<br>
humidity of 80% and has a boiling point of 140°C to 250°C).<br>
Among polyhydric alcohols, examples of the wetting agent A that<br>
has a boiling point of over 250°C at normal pressure include<br>
1,2,3-butanetriol (bp: 175°C / 33hPa, 38% by weight),<br>
1,2,4-butanetriol (bp: 190°C to 191°C / 24hPa, 41% by weight),<br>
glycerin (bp: 290°C, 49% by weight), diglycerin (bp: 270°C / 20hPa,<br>
38% by weight), triethylene glycol (bp: 285°C, 39% by weight) and<br>
tetraethylene glycol (bp: 324°C to 330°C, 37% by weight); and<br>
examples of the wetting agent B that has a boiling point of 140°C<br>
to 250°C include diethylene glycol (bp: 245°C, 43% by weight) and<br>
1,3-butanediol (bp: 203°C to 204°C, 35% by weight). Each of<br>
these wetting agents A and B is a hygroscopic material which has<br>
an equilibrium moisture content of 30% by weight or more at a<br>
temperature of 23°C and a relative humidity of 80%, with the<br>
wetting agent B higher in evaporating ability than the wetting<br>
agent A. It is particularly desirable that the wetting agent A be<br>
glycerin and the wetting agent B be 1,3-butanediol. When a<br>
combination of the wetting agent A and the wetting agent B is<br>
used, the amount ratio B/A (mass ratio) between the wetting<br>
agent A and the wetting agent B cannot be unequivocally<br>
determined because it substantially depends upon the amount of<br>
an after-mentioned extra wetting agent C and the type and<br><br>
amount of other additives such, as a penetrant; however, the<br>
amount ratio B/A is preferably in the range of 10/90 to 90/10, for<br>
instance.<br>
The equilibrium moisture content in the present invention<br>
is calculated as follows: a saturated potassium chloride aqueous<br>
solution is used, the temperature and relative humidity in a<br>
desiccator are kept at 23°C±1°C and 80%±3% respectively, Petri<br>
dishes each containing 1g of a water-soluble organic solvent<br>
weighed are stored inside this desiccator, and the saturated<br>
moisture content is calculated.<br>
The saturated moisture content (%) is represented by the<br>
expression-<br>
(amount of moisture absorbed in organic solvent / amount<br>
of organic solvent + moisture absorbed in organic solvent)xl00.<br>
Use of the polyhydric alcohol(s) by 50% by weight or more<br>
to the total content of wetting agents is advantageous in securing<br>
ejection stability and preventing adhesion of waste ink in a<br>
maintenance device for an ink ejection device.<br>
For the recording ink of the present invention, besides the<br>
wetting agents A and B, an extra wetting agent C (typically, the<br>
extra wetting agent C has an equilibrium moisture content of less<br>
than 30% by weight at a temperature of 23°C and a relative<br>
humidity of 80%) may also be used instead of part of the wetting<br>
agents A and B or in addition to the wetting agents A and B in<br><br>
accordance with, the necessity. Examples of the wetting agent C<br>
include polyhydric alcohols, polyhydric alcohol alkyl ethers,<br>

dimethyl sulfoxide (bp: 139°C), sulfolane (bp: 285°C) and<br>

The above-mentioned other solid wetting agents are<br>
preferably sugars and the like. Examples of the sugars include<br>
monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides (including<br>
trisaccharides and tetrasaccharides) and polysaccharides.<br>
Specific examples thereof include glucose, mannose, fructose,<br><br>
ribose, xylose, arabinose, galactose, maltose, cellobiose, lactose,<br>
sucrose, trehalose and maltotriose. Here, the polysaccharides<br>
denotes sugars in a broad sense, including substances that are<br>
widespread in the nature, such as α-cyclodextrin and cellulose.<br>
Additionally, examples of derivatives of the sugars include<br>
reducing sugars of the sugars, exemplified by sugar alcohols<br>
(represented by the general formula HOCH2(CHOH)nCH2OH<br>
(where "n" denotes an integer of 2 to 5)); oxidation sugars of the<br>
sugars, exemplified by aldonic acid and uronic acid; amino acid;<br>
and thio acid. Among these, sugar alcohols are preferable, and<br>
specific examples thereof include maltitol and sorbitol.<br>
The mass ratio between a pigment and the wetting agents<br>
greatly affects the ejection stability of ink from a head, and<br>
further, affects prevention of adhesion of waste ink in the<br>
maintenance device for the ink ejection device. If the<br>
compounding amount of the wetting agents is small when there is<br>
a high pigment solid content, evaporation of moisture in the<br>
vicinity of an ink meniscus of a nozzle proceeds, thereby possibly<br>
leading to ejection failure. The amount of the wetting agents<br>
contained in the recording ink is preferably 20% by mass to 50%<br>
by mass, more preferably 20% by mass to 40% by mass. When<br>
the amount is less than 20% by mass, there is a decrease in<br>
ejection stability, and adhesion of waste ink in the maintenance<br>
device becomes serious. When it is more than 50% by mass, the<br><br>
recording ink becomes inferior in drying property on paper, and<br>
further, the quality of letters/characters on plain paper may<br>
lower.<br>
Also, in order to improve image quality on plain paper, a<br>
wetting agent C1 having a boiling point of less than 240°C and an<br>
equilibrium moisture content of less than 30% (the wetting agent<br>
Cl is any water-soluble organic solvent having an equilibrium<br>
moisture content of less than 30% by weight at a temperature of<br>
23°C and a relative humidity of 80% and having a boiling point of<br>
less than 240°C among the compounds from which the wetting<br>
agent C is selected) is preferably added to constitute an<br>
appropriate proportion as a wetting agent besides the polyhydric<br>
alcohol(s) having an equilibrium moisture content of 30% by<br>
weight or more. It is desirable that the amount of the<br>
water-soluble organic solvent used be less than 50% by weight to<br>
the total amount of wetting agents used, in view of securing<br>
ejection stability and preventing adhesion of waste ink in the<br>
maintenance device for the ink ejection device.<br>
— Colorant —<br>
For the colorant, a pigment is mainly used in view of<br>
weatherability; however, a dye may also be added at the same<br>
time for the purpose of adjusting color tone, provided that the<br>
addition of the dye does not degrade weatherability. Also, the<br>
pigment is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected<br><br>
in accordance with, the intended use. Examples of the pigment<br>
include pigments for black and pigments for color. Each of these<br>
may be used alone or in combination with two or more.<br>
Examples of inorganic pigments include titanium oxide,<br>
iron oxide, calcium carbonate, barium sulfate, aluminum<br>
hydroxide, barium yellow, cadmium red and chrome yellow and<br>
also include carbon blacks produced by known methods such, as<br>
contact method, furnace method and thermal method.<br>

as azo lakes, insoluble azo pigments, condensed azo pigments and<br>
chelate azo pigments), polycyclic pigments (such as<br>
phthalocyanine pigments, perylene pigments, perinone pigments,<br>

pigments, indigo pigments, thioindigo pigments, isoindolinone<br>
pigments and quinophthalone pigments), dye chelates (such as<br>
basic dye chelates and acid dye chelates), nitro pigments, nitroso<br>
pigments and aniline black. Among these pigments, particular<br>
preference is given to those which have great affinity with water.<br>
Among the above-mentioned pigments, specific examples of<br>
pigments for black that are ideally used include carbon blacks (C.<br>
I. Pigment Black 7) such as furnace black, lamp black, acetylene<br>
black and channel black; metals such as copper, iron (C. I.<br>
Pigment Black 11) and titanium oxide; and organic pigments such<br>
as aniline black (C. I. Pigment Black 1).<br><br>

embodiments.<br>
(1)	In a first embodiment, the colorant has at least one<br>
hydrophilic group on its surface and contains a pigment which<br>

(hereinafter the pigment is also referred to as "self-dispersible<br>
pigment").<br>

is a pigment dispersion containing a pigment, a pigment<br><br>
dispersant and a polymeric dispersion stabilizer, wherein the<br>

resin.<br>
  Structural Formula (II)<br>
In Structural Formula (II), R denotes an alkyl group, and<br>
the alkyl group preferably has 6 to 25 carbon atoms, more<br>
preferably 6 to 22 carbon atoms. "n" denotes a number of 30 to<br>
100.<br>
(3) In a third embodiment, the colorant includes a polymer<br>
emulsion which is a polymer fine particle containing a<br>
water-insoluble or water-sparingly-soluble coloring material (the<br>
polymer emulsion is a water-dispersed material of a polymer fine<br>
particle containing a coloring material).<br>
As to colors of the colorants, examples of the colorants for<br>
black include carbon blacks (C. I. Pigment Black 7) such as<br>
furnace black, lamp black, acetylene black and channel black;<br>
metals such as copper, iron (C. I. Pigment Black 11) and titanium<br>
oxide; and organic pigments such as aniline black (C. I. Pigment<br>
Black 1).<br><br>
Examples of the colorants for color include C. I. Pigment<br>
Yellow 1, 3, 12, 13, 14, 17, 24, 34, 35, 37, 42 (yellow iron oxide), 53,<br>
55, 74, 81, 83, 95, 97, 98, 100, 101, 104, 408, 109, 110, 117, 120,<br>
128, 138, 150, 151, 153 and 183; C. I. Pigment Orange 5, 13, 16,<br>
17, 36, 43 and 51; C. I. Pigment Red 1, 2, 3, 5, 17, 22, 23, 31, 38,<br>
48:2, 48:2 (Permanent Red 2B (Ca)), 48:3, 48:4, 49:1, 52:2, 53:1,<br>
57:l (Brilliant Carmine 6B), 60:1, 63:1, 63:2, 64:1, 81, 83, 88, 101<br>
(red ochre), 104, 105, 106, 108 (cadmium red), 112, 114, 122<br>
(quinacridone magenta), 123, 146, 149, 166, 168, 170, 172, 177,<br>
178, 179, 185, 190, 193, 209 and 219; C. I. Pigment Violet 1<br>
(rhodamine lake), 3, 5:1, 16, 19, 23 and 38; C. I. Pigment Blue 1, 2,<br>

18 and 36.<br>
The self-dispersible pigment in the first embodiment has<br>
its surface modified such that at least one hydrophilic group is<br>
bonded to the surface directly or via other atomic group. The<br>
surface of the pigment is modified, for example, by chemically<br>
bonding a particular functional group (a functional group such as<br>
sulfone group or carboxyl group) to the surface or subjecting the<br>
surface to wet oxidation with the use of at least either a<br>
hypohalous acid or a salt thereof. In particular, a form in which<br>
a carboxyl group is bonded to the surface of the pigment and the<br>
pigment is dispersed in water is favorable. Thus, since the<br><br>
surface of the pigment is modified such that a carboxyl group is<br>
bonded thereto, not only does dispersion stability improve, but<br>
also high printing quality can be obtained and the water<br>
resistance of a recording medium after printing improves further.<br>
Moreover, superior in redispersibility after dried, an ink<br>
containing the self-dispersible pigment in the first embodiment<br>
does not cause clogging even when there is a long hiatus in<br>
printing and an ink moisture content in the vicinity of an ink-jet<br>
head nozzle evaporates, and thus the ink easily enables favorable<br>
printing with a simple cleaning operation.<br>
The volume average particle diameter (D50) of the<br>
self-dispersible pigment in the ink is preferably 0.01µm to<br>
0.16µm.<br>
For instance, as self-dispersible carbon blacks, ones<br>
having ionic properties are favorable, with anionically charged<br>
ones and cationically charged ones being particularly suitable.<br>
Examples of anionic hydrophilic groups include -COOM,<br>
-SO3M, -PO3HM, -PO3M2, -SO2NH2 and -SO2NHCOR (M denotes<br>
a hydrogen atom, an alkali metal, ammonium or an organic<br>
ammonium. R denotes an alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon<br>
atoms, a phenyl group that may have a substituent, or a naphthyl<br>
group that may have a substituent). Among these, use of<br>
-COOM and -SO3M, each of which is bonded to the surface of a<br>
color pigment, is preferable.<br><br>
Examples of "M" in the hydrophilic groups include lithium,<br>
sodium and potassium as alkali metals. Examples of the organic<br>
ammonium include monomethylammonium, trimethylammonium,<br>
monoethylammonium, triethylammonium,<br>
monomethanolammonium and trimethanolammonium.<br>
Examples of methods for obtaining an anionically charged color<br>
pigment include a method of oxidizing a color pigment with<br>
sodium hypochlorite, a method utilizing sulfonation and a method<br>
of making the color pigment and diazonium salt react together, as<br>
methods of introducing —COONa onto the surface of the color<br>
pigment.<br>
Preferable examples of cationic hydrophilic groups include<br>
quaternary ammonium groups, more preferably the quaternary<br>
ammonium groups shown below. In the present invention, it is<br>
desirable that any one of these groups be bonded to a carbon<br>
black surface to constitute a coloring material.<br><br><br><br>
The method for producing a cationic self-dispersible<br>
carbon black to which any of the hydrophilic groups is bonded is<br>
not particularly limited and may be suitably selected in<br>
accordance with the intended use. Examples of methods of<br>
bonding the N-ethylpyridyl group represented by the following<br>
structural formula to a carbon black include a method of treating<br>
the carbon black with 3-amino-N"ethylpyridinium bromide.<br><br>
The hydrophilic groups may be bonded to the surface of the<br>
carbon black via other atomic groups. Examples of the other<br>
atomic groups include alkyl groups having 1 to 12 carbon atoms,<br><br>
phenyl groups that may have substituents, and naphthyl groups<br>
that may have substituents. Specific examples of the<br>
hydrophilic groups and the other atomic groups bonded to the<br>
surface of the carbon black include —C2H4COOM (M denotes an<br>
alkali metal or quaternary ammonium), — PhSO3M (Ph denotes a<br>
phenyl group. M denotes an alkali metal or quaternary<br>
ammonium) and —C5H10NH3+.<br>
In the second embodiment, the colorant is a pigment<br>
dispersion containing an inorganic pigment, an organic pigment,<br>
a pigment such as a complex pigment, a pigment dispersant and a<br>
polymeric dispersion stabilizer, wherein the polymeric dispersion<br>
stabilizer is at least one selected from an α-olefin-maleic<br>
anhydride copolymer represented by the following Structural<br>
Formula (II), a styrene-(meth)acrylic copolymer, a water-soluble<br>
polyurethane resin and a water-soluble polyester resin.<br>
  Structural Formula (II)<br>
In Structural Formula (II), R denotes an alkyl group, and<br>
the alkyl group preferably has 6 to 25 carbon atoms, more<br>
preferably 6 to 22 carbon atoms. "n" denotes a number of 30 to<br>
100.<br>
The polymeric dispersion stabilizer is a material which is<br>
effective in stabilizing the dispersed state of the pigment<br><br>
dispersion finely dispersed in water in a uniform manner by the<br>
pigment dispersant. The a-olefin-maleic anhydride copolymer<br>
represented by Structural Formula (II), the styrene-(meth)acrylic<br>
copolymer, the water-soluble polyurethane resin and the<br>
water-soluble polyester resin are solids at normal temperature<br>
and are hardly soluble in cold water. However, when dissolved<br>
in an alkaline solution or an alkaline aqueous solution having an<br>
alkalinity value that is equivalent to or greater than the acid<br>
value of the copolymers and the resins (preferably 1.0 to 1.5 times<br>
the acid value), the copolymers and the resins become effective as<br>
a polymeric dispersion stabilizer.<br>
The copolymers and the resins can be easily dissolved in<br>
the alkaline solution or the alkaline aqueous solution by heating<br>
and stirring. When the olefin chain of the a-olefin-maleic<br>
anhydride copolymer is long, it is relatively difficult for them to<br>
dissolve, and so there may be insoluble matter left; nevertheless,<br>
they can be made effective as a polymeric dispersion stabilizer by<br>
removing the insoluble matter with a certain filter or the like.<br>
Examples of the base in the alkaline solution or the<br>
alkaline aqueous solution include hydroxides of alkali metals,<br>
such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and lithium<br>
hydroxide; basic substances such as ammonia, triethylamine and<br>
morpholine; and alcohol amines such as triethanolamine,<br>
diethanolamine, N-methyldiethanolanaine,<br><br>
2-amino-2-ethyl-l,3-propanediol and. choline.<br>
For the α-olefin-maleic anhydride copolymer represented<br>
by Structural Formula (II), a suitably synthesized compound may<br>
be used, or a commercially available product may be used.<br>
Examples of the commercially available product include T-YP112,<br>
T-YP115, T-YP114 and T-YP116 (all of which are produced by<br>
Seiko PMC Corporation).<br>
For the styrene-(meth)acrylic copolymer, a suitably<br>
synthesized compound may be used, or a commercially available<br>
product may be used. Examples of the commercially available<br>
product include JC-05 (produced by Seiko PMC Corporation); and<br>
ARUFON UC-3900, ARUFON UC-3910 and ARUFON UC-3920<br>
(produced by Toagosei Co., Ltd.).<br>
For the water-soluble polyurethane resin, a suitably<br>
synthesized compound may be used, or a commercially available<br>
product may be used. Examples of the commercially available<br>
product include TAKELAC W-5025, TAKELAC W-6010 and<br>
TAKELAC W-5661 (produced by Mitsui Takeda Chemical Co.).<br>
For the water-soluble polyester resin, a suitably<br>
synthesized compound may be used, or a commercially available<br>
product may be used. Examples of the commercially available<br>
product include NICHIGO POLYESTER W-0030, NICHIGO<br>
POLYESTER W-0005S30WO and NICHIGO POLYESTER WR-961<br>
(produced by Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.); and<br><br>
PESRESIN A-210 and PESRESIN A-520 (produced by Takamatsu<br>
Oil &amp; Fat Co., Ltd.).<br>
The acid value of the polymeric dispersion stabilizer is<br>
preferably 40mgKOH/g to 400mgKOH/g, more preferably<br>
60mgKOH/g to 350mgKOH/g. When the acid value is less than<br>
40mgKOH/g, the dissolving ability of the alkaline solution may<br>
become poor. When it is greater than 400mgKOH/g, the<br>
viscosity of the pigments becomes high, and thus ejection of ink<br>
may easily be degraded or the dispersion stability of the pigment<br>
dispersant may easily decrease.<br>
The mass average molecular weight of the polymeric<br>
dispersion stabilizer is preferably 20,000 or less, more preferably<br>
5,000 to 20,000. When the mass average molecular weight is<br>
less than 5,000, the dispersion stability of the pigment dispersant<br>
may decrease. When it is greater than 20,000, the dissolving<br>
ability of the alkaline solution may become poor or there may be<br>
an increase in viscosity.<br>
The amount of the polymeric dispersion stabilizer<br>
contained is preferably 1 part by mass to 100 parts by mass (as<br>
the solid content equivalent), more preferably 5 parts by mass to<br>
50 parts by mass, in relation to 100 parts by mass of the pigments.<br>
When the amount is less than 1 part by mass, there may be no<br>
effect of dispersion stabilization. When it is greater than 100<br>
parts by mass, the ink viscosity increases, and thus the ability of<br><br>
the ink to eject from a nozzle may easily be degraded or there may<br>
be economic inferiority.<br><pigment dispersant><br>
In the" second embodiment, it is desirable that the colorant<br>
contain a pigment dispersant. For the pigment dispersant,<br>
either an anionic surfactant or a nonionic surfactant having an<br>
HLB value of 10 to 20 is suitable.<br>
Examples of the anionic surfactant include<br>
polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetates, alkylbenzene sulfonates<br>
(e.g. NH4, Na and Ca), alkyl diphenyl ether disulfonates (e.g. NH4,<br>
Na and Ca), dialkylsuccinate sodium sulfonates,<br>
naphthalenesulfonic acid formalin condensate sodium salts,<br>
polyoxyethylene polycyclic phenylether sulfate salts (e.g. NH4<br>
and Na), laurates, polyoxyethylene alkyl ether sulfate salts and<br>
oleates. Among these, dioctylsulfosuccinate sodium salts and<br>
polyoxyethylene styrenephenylether sulfonate NH4 salts are<br>
particularly preferable.<br>
Examples of the nonionic surfactant having an HLB value<br>
of 10 to 20 include polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyalkylene<br>
alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene polycyclic phenylethers, sorbitan<br>
fatty esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty esters,<br>
polyoxyethylene alkylphenyl ethers, polyoxyethylene<br>
alkylamines, polyoxyethylene alkylamides and acetylene glycol.<br>
Among these, polyoxyethylene lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene<br><br>
β-naphthyl ether, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate and<br>
polyoxyethylene styrenephenylether are particularly preferable.<br>
The amount of the pigment dispersant contained is<br>
preferably 1 part by mass to 100 parts by mass, more preferably<br>
10 parts by mass to 50 parts by mass, in relation to 100 parts by<br>
mass of the pigments. When the amount of the pigment<br>
dispersant contained is small, the pigments cannot be sufficiently<br>
micronized. When it is too large, excessive dispersant<br>
components not adsorbed onto the pigments have an adverse<br>
effect on ink properties, thereby leading to image bleeding and<br>
degradation of water resistance and friction resistance.<br>
The pigment dispersion finely dispersed in water in a<br>
uniform manner by the pigment dispersant can be produced as<br>
follows: the pigment dispersant is dissolved in an aqueous<br>
medium; subsequently, the pigments are added for sufficient<br>
wetness, then the pigment dispersion is stirred at high speed by a<br>
homogenizer and dispersed by a dispersing machine using a ball<br>
such as a bead mill or ball mill, a kneading and dispersing<br>
machine utilizing shearing force such as a roll mill, an ultrasonic<br>
dispersing machine, etc. It should be noted that after such a<br>
kneading and dispersing step, the pigment dispersion often<br>
includes coarse particles, which cause clogging of an ink-jet<br>
nozzle and a supply path. Therefore, it is necessary to remove<br>
particles which are 1µm or greater in diameter, using a filter or a<br><br>
centrifugal separator.<br>
The average particle diameter (D50) of the pigment<br>
dispersant in the ink is preferably 150nm or less, more preferably<br>
100nm or less. When the average particle diameter (D50) is<br>
greater than 150nm, there is a dramatic decrease in ejection<br>
stability, and thus nozzle clogging and deviation of ink ejection<br>
are liable to arise. When it is 100nm or less, ejection stability<br>
improves, and image color saturation improves as well.<br>
For the water-dispersible colorant of the third embodiment,<br>
use of a polymer emulsion in which polymer fine particles contain<br>
a pigment is favorable as well as use of any of the<br>
above-mentioned pigments. The polymer emulsion in which<br>
polymer fine particles contain a pigment means either a polymer<br>
emulsion in which a pigment is encapsulated in polymer fine<br>
particles or a polymer emulsion in which a pigment is adsorbed<br>
onto surfaces of polymer fine particles. In this case, it is not<br>
that all of the pigment needs to be encapsulated or adsorbed but<br>
that the pigment may be dispersed in the emulsion to such an<br>
extent that the effects of the present invention are not impaired.<br>
Examples of the polymer constituting the polymer emulsion (the<br>
polymer of the polymer fine particles) include vinyl polymers,<br>
polyester polymers and polyurethane polymers. Among these,<br>
particular preference is given to vinyl polymers and polyester<br>
polymers, or more specifically, the polymers disclosed in<br><br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) Nos. 2000-53897<br>
and 2001-139849.<br>
The amount of the colorant contained in the recording ink<br>
is preferably 2% by mass to 15% by mass, more preferably 3% by<br>
mass to 12% by mass, as a solid content. When the amount is<br>
less than 2% by mass, the color-developing ability of the ink and<br>
image density may decrease. When it is greater than 15% by<br>
mass, the ink thickens, and thus the ability of the ink to eject<br>
may degrade, which is unfavorable from an economical viewpoint<br>
as well.<br>
— Surfactant -<br>
For the surfactant, what is preferable is a surfactant<br>
which is low in surface tension and high in penetrability and<br>
leveling ability and does not impair dispersion stability<br>
regardless of the type of the colorant or the combination of the<br>
wetting agents. And for the surfactant, at least one selected<br>
from an anionic surfactant, a nonionic surfactant, a<br>
silicone-based surfactant and a fluorine-based surfactant is<br>
suitable. Among these, a silicone-based surfactant and a<br>
fluorine-based surfactant are particularly preferable.<br>
Each of these surfactants may be used alone or in<br>
combination with two or more.<br>
The fluorine-based surfactant is preferably a<br>
fluorine-substituted compound having 2 to 16 carbon atoms, more<br><br>
preferably a fluorine-substituted compound having 4 to 16 carbon<br>
atoms. When the fluorine-substituted compound has less than<br>
two carbon atoms, effects of the fluorine may not be obtained.<br>
When it has more than 16 carbon atoms, there may be problems<br>
with ink storage stability, etc.<br>
Examples of the fluorine-based surfactant include<br>
perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid compounds, perfluoroalkyl carboxylic<br>
compounds, perfluoroalkyl phosphoric acid ester compounds,<br>
perfluoroalkyl ethylene oxide adducts, and polyoxyalkylene ether<br>
polymer compounds having perfluoroalkylether groups in side<br>
chains. Among these, polyoxyalkylene ether polymer compounds<br>
having perfluoroalkylether groups in side chains are particularly<br>
preferable because they have low foaming properties.<br>
Fluorine-based surfactants represented by the following<br>

ether polymers having perfluoroalkylether groups in side chains,<br>
and salts of polyoxyalkylene ether polymers having<br>
perfluoroalkylether groups in side chains.<br>

surfactants include Li, Na, K, NH4) NH3CH2CH2OH,<br>

compounds may be used, or commercially available products may<br>
be used.<br>
Examples of the commercially available products include<br>

FT-400SW produced by Neos Company Limited, and POLYFOX<br>
PF-151N produced by OMNOVA Solutions Inc. are particularly<br>
preferable in that printing quality, particularly color-developing<br>
ability and uniform dying ability to paper, improves remarkably.<br>
Specific examples of the fluorine-based surfactant include<br>
compounds represented by the following structural formulae,<br>
(l) Anionic Fluorine-based Surfactant<br><br>

The silicone-based surfactant is not particularly limited<br>
and may be suitably selected in accordance with the intended use,<br>
with preference given to a compound which does not decompose<br>
even at high pH values. Examples thereof include<br>
side-chain-modified polydimethylsiloxane, both-end-modified<br>
polydimethylsiloxane, one-end-modified polydimethylsiloxane<br>
and side-chain-both-end-modified polydimethylsiloxane. Among<br>
these, polyether-modified silicone-based surfactants having<br>
polyoxyethylene groups or polyoxyethylenepolyoxypropylene<br>
groups as modifying groups are particularly preferable because<br>
they exhibit favorable properties as aqueous surfactants.<br>
For such surfactants, suitably synthesized compounds may<br>
be used, or commercially available products may be used.<br>
The commercially available products can be easily<br>
obtained from BYK-Chemie, Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd. and<br>
Dow Corning Toray Co., Ltd., for instance.<br>
The polyether-modified silicone-based surfactants are not<br><br>
particularly limited and may be suitably selected in accordance<br>
with, the intended use. Examples thereof include a compound<br>
represented by the following structural formula, that is prepared<br>
by introducing polyalkyleneoxide units into side chains of Si<br>
portions of a dimethylpolysiloxane.<br><br>
In the structural formula, "m", "n", "a" and "b" each denote<br>
an integer. R and R' each denote an alkyl group or an alkylene<br>
group.<br>
For the polyether-modified silicone-based surfactants,<br>
commercially available products can be used. Examples thereof<br>
include KF-618, KF-642 and KF-643 (all of which are produced by<br>
Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.).<br>
Examples of the anionic surfactant include<br>
polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetates, dodecylbenzene sulfonates,<br>
laurates, and salts of polyoxyethylene alkyl ether sulfates.<br>
Examples of the nonionic surfactant include polyoxyethylene<br>
alkyl ethers, polyoxypropylene polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers,<br>
polyoxyethylene alkyl esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty<br>
esters, polyoxyethylene alkylphenyl ethers, polyoxyethylene<br><br>
alkylamines and polyoxyethylene alkylamides.<br>
The amount of any of the surfactants contained in the<br>
recording ink is preferably 0.01% by mass to 3.0% by mass, more<br>
preferably 0.5% by mass to 2% by mass.<br>
When the amount is less than 0.01% by mass, the addition<br>
of the surfactant may be ineffective. When it is greater than<br>
3.0% by mass, the ink has more penetrability to a recording<br>
medium than necessary, and thus image density may decrease or<br>
ink strike-through may arise.<br>
— Penetrant —<br>
It is desirable for the recording ink of the present<br>
invention to contain as a penetrant at least a polyol compound<br>
having 8 to 11 carbon atoms, or a glycol ether compound. The<br>
penetrant is different from the wetting agents, and it is not that<br>
the penetrant has no wetting properties. However, having lower<br>
wetting properties than the wetting agents have, the penetrant<br>
can be referred to as a material having nonwetting properties.<br>
Here, the term "nonwetting properties" is defined as follows.<br>
The penetrant preferably has a solubility of 0.2% by mass to 5.0%<br>
by mass in water at 25°C. For the penetrant,<br>
2-ethyM,3-hexanediol (solubility- 4.2% at 25°C) and<br>
2,2,4-trimethyl-l,3-pentanediol (solubility: 2.0% at 25°C) are<br>
particularly suitable.<br>
Other polyol compounds suitable for the penetrant, as<br><br>
aliphatic diols, are exemplified by<br>
2-ethyl-2-methyl-l,3-propanediol, 3,3-dimethyl-l,2-butanediol,<br>
2,2-diethyl-l,3-propanediol, 2-methyl-2-propyl-l,3-propanediol,<br>
2,4-dimethyl-2,4-pentanediol, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-hexanediol and<br>
5-hexene-l,2-diol.<br>
As for other penetrants able to be additionally used, they<br>
are not particularly limited and may be suitably selected in<br>
accordance with the intended use as long as they dissolve in the<br>
ink and can be adjusted to have desired properties. Examples<br>
thereof include alkyl and allyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols, such<br>
as diethylene glycol monophenyl ether, ethylene glycol<br>
monophenyl ether, ethylene glycol mono allylether, diethylene<br>
glycol monobutyl ether, propylene glycol monobutyl ether and<br>
tetraethylene glycol chlorophenyl ether; and lower alcohols such<br>
as ethanol.<br>
The amount of the penetrant contained in the recording<br>
ink is preferably 0.1% by mass to 4.0% by mass. When the<br>
amount is less than 0.1% by mass, the ink does not have<br>
quick-drying properties and thus image bleeding may arise.<br>
When it is greater than 4.0% by mass, the dispersion stability of<br>
the colorant is impaired, and thus a nozzle becomes easily<br>
clogged; also, the ink has more penetrability to a recording<br>
medium than necessary, and thus image density may decrease or<br>
offset may arise.<br><br>
- Water-dispersible Resin -<br>
The water-dispersible resin is superior in film-forming<br>
property (image-forming property), has high water repellency,<br>
high water resistance and high weatherability and is useful for<br>
recording images with high water resistance and high density<br>
(high color-developing ability). Examples thereof include<br>
condensed synthetic resins, additional synthetic resins and<br>
natural polymer compounds.<br>
Examples of the condensed synthetic resins include<br>
polyester resins, polyurethane resins, polyepoxy resins,<br>
polyamide resins, polyether resins, poly(meth)acrylic resins,<br>
acrylic-silicone resins and fluorine resins. Examples of the<br>
additional synthetic resins include polyolefin resins, polystyrene<br>
resins, polyvinyl alcohol resins, polyvinyl ester resins,<br>
polyacrylic resins and unsaturated carboxylic resins. Examples<br>
of the natural polymer compounds include celluloses, rosins and<br>
natural rubbers.<br>
Among these, polyurethane resin fine particles,<br>
acrylic-silicone resin fine particles and fluorine resin fine<br>
particles are particularly preferable. Also, each of these<br>
water-dispersible resins can be used in combination with two or<br>
more without any problems.<br>
For the fluorine resins, fluorine resin fine particles having<br>
fluoroolefin units are suitable. Among these,<br><br>
fluorine-containing vinyl ether resin fine particles composed of<br>
fluoroolefin units and vinyl ether units are particularly<br>
preferable.<br>
The fluoroolefin units are not particularly limited and may<br>
be suitably selected in accordance with the intended use.<br>
Examples thereof include -CF2CF2-, -CF2CF(CF3)- and<br>
-CF2CFCl-.<br>
The vinyl ether units are not particularly limited and may<br>
be suitably selected in accordance with the intended use.<br>
Examples thereof include the compounds represented by the<br>
following structural formulae.<br><br><br>
For the fluorine-containing vinyl ether resin fine particles<br>
composed of fluoroolefin units and vinyl ether units, alternate<br>
copolymers are suitable in which the fluoroolefin units and the<br>
vinyl ether units are alternately copolymerized.<br>
For such fluorine resin fine particles, suitably synthesized<br><br>
compounds may be used, or commercially available products may<br>
be used. Examples of the commercially available products<br>
include FLUONATE FEM-500, FEM-600, DICGUARD F-52S, F-90,<br>
F-90M, F-90N and AQUAFURAN TE-5A produced by Dainippon<br>
Ink And Chemicals, Incorporated; and LUMIFLON FE4300,<br>
FE4500, FE4400, ASAHIGUARD AG-7105, AG-950, AG-7600,<br>
AG-7000 and AG-1100 produced by Asahi Glass Co., Ltd.<br>
The water-dispersible resin may be used as a homopolymer<br>
or may be subjected to copolymerization and used as a composite<br>
resin; and any one of a single-phase emulsion, a core-shell<br>
emulsion and a power feed emulsion can be used therefor.<br>
For the water-dispersible resin, what can be used is a resin<br>
in which the resin itself has a hydrophilic group and<br>
self-dispersibility, or a resin in which the resin itself does not<br>
have dispersibility, but a surfactant or a resin having a<br>
hydrophilic group gives dispersibility. Among such resins,<br>
ionomers of polyester resins and polyurethane resins, and<br>
emulsions of resin particles obtained by emulsion polymerization<br>
and suspension polymerization of unsaturated monomers are<br>
ideal. In the case of emulsion polymerization of an unsaturated<br>
monomer, since a resin emulsion is obtained by a reaction using<br>
water to which the unsaturated monomer, a polymerization<br>
initiator, a surfactant, a chain transfer agent, a chelator, a pH<br>
adjuster and the like have been added, it is easily possible to<br><br>
obtain a water-dispersible resin and change the resinous<br>
structure, and thus desired properties can be easily created.<br>
Examples of the unsaturated monomers include<br>
unsaturated carboxylic acids, monofunctional or multifunctional<br>
(meth)acrylic acid ester monomers, (meth)acrylic acid amide<br>
monomers, aromatic vinyl monomers, vinyl cyano compound<br>
monomers, vinyl monomers, allyl compound monomers, olefin<br>
monomers, diene monomers and oligomers having unsaturated<br>
carbon. Each of these may be used alone or in combination. It<br>
is possible to improve properties flexibly by combining these<br>
monomers together, and it is also possible to improve the<br>
characteristics of the resin by producing polymerization reaction<br>
or graft reaction with the use of an oligomer-type polymerization<br>
initiator.<br>

acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, itaconic acid, fumaric acid and<br>
maleic acid.<br>

acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile.<br>

sulfonic acid or salts thereof, allylamine, allyl chloride,<br>

Examples of the olefin monomers include ethylene and<br><br>
propylene.<br>

chloroprene.<br>
Examples of the oligomers having unsaturated carbon<br>
include styrene oligomers having methacryloyl groups,<br>
styrene-acrylonitrile oligomers having methacryloyl groups,<br>
methyl methacrylate oligomers having methacryloyl groups,<br>
dimethylsiloxane oligomers having methacryloyl groups and<br>
polyester oligomers having acryloyl groups.<br>
Since the water-dispersible resin has its molecular chains<br>
broken by dispersion destruction, hydrolysis or the like under<br>
strongly alkaline or acidic conditions, the pH thereof is<br>
preferably 4 to 12, more preferably 6 to 11 and even more<br>
preferably 7 to 9 especially in view of its miscibility with the<br>
water-dispersible colorant.<br>
The average particle diameter (D50) of the<br>
water-dispersible resin is related to the viscosity of dispersion<br>
solution. As to water-dispersible resins having the same<br>
composition, the smaller the average particle diameter is, the<br>
greater the viscosity is per the same solid content. In order to<br>
avoid excessively high ink viscosity when ink has been formed, it<br>
is desirable for the average particle diameter (D50) of the<br>
water-dispersible resin to be 50nm or greater. Also, when the<br>
water-dispersible resin has a particle diameter that reaches up to<br><br>
several tens of micrometers, particles become larger in size than<br>
a nozzle orifice of the ink-jet head, and thus the water-dispersible<br>
resin is impossible to use. When particles which are smaller in<br>
size than the nozzle orifice but still large in diameter are present<br>
in the ink, the ability of the ink to eject is degraded. Accordingly,<br>
in order to prevent the ink ejection ability from being impaired, it<br>
is desirable for the average particle diameter (D50) to be 200nm or<br>
less, more desirably 150nm or less.<br>
The water-dispersible resin has a function of fixing the<br>
water-dispersible colorant onto paper and preferably forms into a<br>
coating at normal temperature so as to enhance coloring material<br>
fixing properties. For that reason, the minimum film-forming<br>
temperature (MFT) of the water-dispersible resin is preferably<br>
30°C or lower. Also, when the water-dispersible resin has a<br>
glass transition temperature of-40°C or lower, the resin coating<br>
becomes highly viscous, and so printed matter becomes tacky;<br>
therefore, the water-dispersible resin preferably has a glass<br>
transition temperature of —30°C or higher.<br>
The amount of the water-dispersible resin contained in the<br>
recording ink is preferably 1% by mass to 15% by mass, more<br>
preferably 2% by mass to 7% by mass, as a solid content.<br>
Here, the amounts of the colorant, pigment in the colorant,<br>
and the water-dispersible resin contained in the ink as solid<br>
contents can be measured, for example, by separating only the<br><br>
colorant and the water-dispersible resin from the ink. When a<br>
pigment is used as the colorant, it is possible to measure the ratio<br>
between the colorant and the water-dispersible resin by<br>
evaluating the weight decrease rate according to<br>
thermogravimetric analysis. Also, when the molecular structure<br>
of the colorant is obvious, it is possible in the case of pigment and<br>
dye to determine the amount of the colorant as a solid content by<br>
means of NMR, and it is possible in the case of inorganic pigment,<br>
gold-containing organic pigment and gold-containing dye<br>
contained in heavy-metal atoms and molecular frameworks to<br>
determine the amount of the colorant as a solid content by means<br>
of fluorescent X-ray analysis.<br>
As to the ink of the present invention, the moisture<br>
content is normally 50% by weight or more, and the total amount<br>
of resin and pigment is normally 3% by weight or more. Thus,<br>
the evaporation rate of a solvent is normally 50% by weight to<br>
97% by weight.<br>

The recording ink of the present invention is produced by<br>
dispersing or dissolving in an aqueous medium a colorant, a<br><br>
water-soluble organic solvent (a wetting agent), a surfactant, a<br>
penetrant, a water-dispersible resin and water, with the addition<br>
of other components in accordance with the necessity, and<br>
stirring and mixing the ingredients if need be. The dispersion<br>
can be carried out, for example, by a sand mill, a homogenizer, a<br>
ball mill, a paint shaker, an ultrasonic dispersing machine, etc.,<br>
and the stirring and mixing can be carried out, for example, by an<br>
ordinary stirrer using stirring blades, a magnetic stirrer, a<br>
high-speed dispersing machine, etc.<br>
The properties of the recording ink of the present<br>
invention are not particularly limited and may be suitably<br>
selected in accordance with the intended use. For instance, it is<br>
desirable that the viscosity, surface tension and the like of the<br>
recording ink be in the following ranges.<br>
The viscosity of the recording ink at 25°C is preferably<br>
5mPas to 20mPa.s. By making the ink viscosity equal to or<br>
greater than 5mPa.s, it is possible to obtain the effects with<br>
which to increase printing density and the quality of<br>
letters/characters. By making it equal to or less than 20mPa.s,<br>
it is possible to secure ejection stability.<br>
Here, the viscosity can be measured at 25°C, using a<br>
viscometer (RL-500, manufactured by Toki Sangyo Co., Ltd.), for<br>
instance.<br>
The surface tension of the recording ink is preferably<br><br>
35mN/m or less, more preferably 32mN/m or less, at 25°C. When<br>
the surface tension is greater than 35mN/m, leveling of the ink on<br>
a recording medium hardly takes place, and thus it may take a<br>
longer time for the ink to dry.<br>
The coloring of the recording ink of the present invention<br>
is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected in<br>
accordance with the intended use. For instance, the recording<br>
ink is colored yellow, magenta, cyan or black. When recording is<br>
carried out using an ink set in which two or more of the colors are<br>
used together, it is possible to form a multicolor image, and when<br>
recording is carried out using an ink set in which all the colors<br>
are used together, it is possible to form a full-color image.<br>
The recording ink of the present invention can be suitably<br>
used for printers equipped with ink-jet heads of any type,<br>
including the piezo type in which ink droplets are ejected by<br>
deforming a diaphragm that forms a wall surface of an ink flow<br>
path, with the use of a piezoelectric element as a pressure<br>
generating unit that pressurizes ink in the ink flow path, and<br>
thusly changing the volume of the ink flow path (refer to JP-A No.<br>
02-51734); the thermal type in which bubbles are generated by<br>
heating ink in an ink flow path with the use of an exothermic<br>
resistive element (refer to JP-ANo. 61-59911); and the<br>
electrostatic type in which ink droplets are ejected by placing a<br>
diaphragm and an electrode, which form a wall surface of an ink<br><br>
flow path, to face each other, then deforming the diaphragm by<br>
electrostatic force generated between the diaphragm and the<br>
electrode, and thusly changing the volume of the ink flow path<br>
(refer to JP-A No. 06-71882).<br>
The recording ink of the present invention can be suitably<br>
used in a variety of fields such as ink-jet recording inks, fountain<br>
pens, ballpoint pens, markers and felt-tip pens, notably in<br>
image-forming apparatuses (printers, etc.) each employing an<br>
ink-jet recording method. For instance, the recording ink can be<br>
used in a printer which has a function of encouraging printing<br>
fixation by heating recording paper and the recording ink to a<br>
temperature of 50°C to 200°C during, before or after printing.<br>
The recording ink can be particularly suitably used in the ink<br>
media set, the ink cartridge, the ink-jet recording method, the<br>
ink-jet recording apparatus and the ink recorded matter of<br>
present invention described below.<br>
(Ink Media Set)<br>
The ink media set of the present invention is a<br>
combination of the recording ink of the present invention and a<br>
recording medium.<br><recording medium><br>
The recording medium is not particularly limited and may<br>
be suitably selected in accordance with the intended use.<br>
Suitable examples thereof include plain paper, gloss paper,<br><br>
special paper, cloth, films, OHP sheets and general-purpose<br>
printing paper.<br>
In order to obtain an exquisite ink recorded matter such as<br>
a printed image, what is used among these is a recording medium<br>
including a support, and a coating layer applied onto at least one<br>
surface of the support, in which the amount of purified water<br>
transferred to the recording medium at a contact period of 100ms<br>
measured by a dynamic scanning absorptometer is 2ml/m2 to<br>
35ml/m2 and the amount of purified water transferred to the<br>
recording medium at a contact period of 400ms measured by the<br>
dynamic scanning absorptometer is 3ml/m2 to 40ml/m2.<br>
The amount of purified water transferred to the recording<br>
medium at a contact period of 100ms measured by the dynamic<br>
scanning absorptometer is preferably 2ml/m2 to 5ml/m2 and the<br>
amount of purified water transferred to the recording medium at<br>
a contact period of 400ms measured by the dynamic scanning<br>
absorptometer is preferably 3ml/m2 to 10ml/m2.<br>
When the amount of the ink and purified water transferred<br>
at the contact period of 100ms is too small, beading<br>
(nonuniformity of density) may easily arise. When it is too large,<br>
the ink dot diameter after recording may become far smaller than<br>
desired.<br>
When the amount of the ink and purified water transferred<br>
at the contact period of 400ms is too small, sufficient drying<br><br>
properties cannot be obtained, and thus spur marks may easily<br>
appear. When it is too large, the glossiness of an image portion<br>
after dried may easily lower.<br>
Here, the dynamic scanning absorptometer (DSA, Japan<br>
TAPPI Journal, vol. 48, May 1994, pp. 88-92, Shigenori Kuga) is<br>
an apparatus which can precisely measure the amount of liquid<br>
absorbed in a very short period of time. The dynamic scanning<br>
absorptometer automatically conducts the measurement by a<br>
method in which the rate of liquid absorption is directly read on<br>
the basis of the transfer of a meniscus in a capillary, a sample is<br>
shaped like a disc, a liquid absorption head is spirally moved for<br>
scanning on the sample, the scanning rate is automatically<br>
changed in accordance with a preset pattern, and measurement is<br>
repeated according to the required number of points per sample.<br>
A head for supplying liquid to a paper sample is connected to the<br>
capillary via a Teflon (trademark) tube, and the position of the<br>
meniscus in the capillary is automatically read by an optical<br>
sensor. Specifically, the amount of purified water transferred<br>
was measured using a dynamic scanning absorptometer (K350<br>
series, Model D, manufactured by Kyowaseiko Corporation).<br>
The transfer amount at a contact period of 100ms and the<br>
transfer amount at a contact period of 400ms can be calculated by<br>
means of interpolation based upon the measurement values of the<br>
transfer amounts at contact periods close to the above-mentioned<br><br>
contact periods.<br>
- Support -<br>
The support is not particularly limited and may be<br>
suitably selected in accordance with the intended use.<br>
Examples thereof include paper made mainly from wood fiber,<br>
and sheet-like materials such as unwoven fabrics made mainly<br>
from wood fiber and synthetic fiber.<br>
The paper is not particularly limited and may be suitably<br>
selected from known materials in accordance with the intended<br>
use. For instance, wood pulp or recycled pulp is used therefor.<br>
Examples of the wood pulp include leaf bleached kraft pulp<br>
(LBKP), needle bleached kraft pulp (NBKP), NBSP, LBSP, GP and<br>
TMP.<br>
Examples of the raw material for the recycled pulp include<br>
articles shown in the "Used Paper Standard Quality Specification<br>
List" released by Paper Recycling Promotion Center, such as<br>
high-quality white paper, white paper with lines and marks,<br>
cream-colored paper, card, medium-quality white paper,<br>
low-quality white paper, simili paper, white-colored paper, Kent<br>
paper, white art paper, medium-quality colored paper, low-quality<br>
colored paper, newspaper and magazine. Specific examples<br>
thereof include used paperboards and used papers of the<br>
following papers: printer papers such as uncoated computer paper,<br>
thermosensitive paper and pressure-sensitive paper that are<br><br>
related to information; OA (office automation) related papers<br>
such as paper for PPC (plain paper copier); coated papers such as<br>
art paper, coated paper, finely coated paper and matte paper; and<br>
uncoated papers such as high-quality paper, high color quality<br>
paper, notebook, letter paper, packing paper, fancy paper,<br>
medium-quality paper, newspaper, woody paper, super wrapping<br>
paper, simili paper, pure white roll paper and milk carton. More<br>
specific examples thereof include chemical pulp paper and<br>
high-yield pulp-containing paper. Each of these may be used<br>
alone or in combination with two or more.<br>
The recycled pulp is generally produced by a combination<br>
of the following four steps.<br>
(1)	Defibration: used paper is treated with mechanical force<br>
and chemicals using a pulper and thusly fiberized, and printing<br>
ink is separated from the fiber.<br>
(2)	Dust removal: foreign matter (plastic, etc.) and dust<br>
contained in the used paper is removed by a screen, a cleaner or<br>
the like.<br>
(3)	Ink removal: the printing ink that has been separated from<br>
the fiber using a surfactant is removed from the system by a<br>
flotation method or washing method.<br>
(4)	Bleaching: the whiteness of the fiber is enhanced utilizing<br>
oxidation or reduction.<br>
When the recycled pulp is mixed with other pulp, it is<br><br>
desirable that the mixture ratio of the recycled pulp in the whole<br>
pulp be 40% or less so as to prevent curl after recording.<br>
For an internally added filler used in the support, a<br>
conventionally known pigment as a white pigment is used, for<br>
instance. Examples of the white pigment include white<br>
inorganic pigments such as light calcium carbonate, heavy<br>
calcium carbonate, kaolin, clay, talc, calcium sulfate, barium<br>
sulfate, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, zinc sulfide, zinc carbonate,<br>
satin white, aluminum silicate, diatomaceous earth, calcium<br>
silicate, magnesium silicate, synthetic silica, aluminum<br>
hydroxide, alumina, lithopone, zeolite, magnesium carbonate and<br>
magnesium hydroxide; and organic pigments such as<br>
styrene-based plastic pigments, acrylic plastic pigments,<br>
polyethylene, microcapsules, urea resins and melamine resins.<br>
Each of these may be used alone or in combination with two or<br>
more.<br>
Examples of an internally added sizing agent used in<br>
producing the support include neutral rosin sizing agents used in<br>
neutral papermaking, alkenyl succinic anhydrides (ASA), alkyl<br>
ketene dimers (AKD) and petroleum resin sizing agents. Among<br>
these, neutral rosin sizing agents and alkenyl succinic<br>
anhydrides are particularly suitable. Although any of the alkyl<br>
ketene dimers only needs to be added in small amounts due to its<br>
strong sizing effect, it may be unfavorable in terms of conveyance<br><br>
at the time of ink-jet recording because the friction coefficient of<br>
a recording paper (medium) surface decreases and the surface<br>
easily becomes slippery.<br>
The thickness of the support is not particularly limited<br>
and may be suitably selected in accordance with the intended use,<br>
with the range of 50µm to 300µm being preferable. The basis<br>
weight of the support is preferably 45g/m2 to 290g/m2.<br>
— Coating Layer —<br>
The coating layer includes a pigment and a binder, and<br>
further includes a surfactant and other components in accordance<br>
with the necessity.<br>
For the pigment, an inorganic pigment or a combination of<br>
an inorganic pigment and an organic pigment can be used.<br>
Examples of the inorganic pigment include kaolin, talc,<br>
heavy calcium carbonate, light calcium carbonate, calcium sulfite,<br>
amorphous silica, titanium white, magnesium carbonate,<br>
titanium dioxide, aluminum hydroxide, calcium hydroxide,<br>
magnesium hydroxide, zinc hydroxide and chlorites. Among<br>
these, kaolin is particularly preferable in that it is superior in<br>
gloss developing property and makes it possible to yield a texture<br>
which approximates that of paper for offset printing.<br>
Examples of the kaolin include delaminated kaolin,<br>
calcined kaolin, and engineered kaolin produced by surface<br>
modification or the like. In view of gloss developing property, it<br><br>
is desirable that 50% by mass or more of the whole kaolin be<br>
occupied by kaolin having a particle size distribution in which<br>
80% by mass or more of the particles are 2µm or less in diameter.<br>
The amount of the kaolin added is preferably 50 parts by<br>
mass or more in relation to 100 parts by mass of the binder.<br>
When the amount is less than 50 parts by mass, sufficient<br>
effectiveness may not be obtained with respect to glossiness.<br>
Although the maximum value of the amount is not particularly<br>
limited, it is desirable in terms of coating suitability that the<br>
amount be 90 parts by mass or less, in view of the kaolin's fluidity,<br>
especially thickening properties in the presence of high shearing<br>
force.<br>
Examples of the organic pigment include water-soluble<br>
dispersions containing styrene-acrylic copolymer particles,<br>
styrene-butadiene copolymer particles, polystyrene particles,<br>
polyethylene particles, etc. Each of these organic pigments may<br>
be used in combination with two or more.<br>
The amount of the organic pigment added is preferably 2<br>
parts by mass to 20 parts by mass in relation to 100 parts by mass<br>
of the whole pigment of the coating layer. The organic pigment<br>
is superior in gloss developing property and smaller in specific<br>
gravity than an inorganic pigment, thereby making it possible to<br>
obtain a coating layer which is bulky, highly glossy and excellent<br>
in surface coating property. When the amount is less than 2<br><br>
parts by mass, such effects cannot be obtained. When it is<br>
greater than 20 parts by mass, the fluidity of a coating solution<br>
degrades, which leads to decrease in coating operationality and<br>
which is economically unfavorable as well.<br>
Examples of the form of the organic pigment include dense<br>
type, hollow type and doughnut type. However, in light of a<br>
balance among the gloss developing property, the surface coating<br>
property, and the fluidity of the coating solution, it is desirable<br>
that the average particle diameter (D50) be 0.2µm to 3.0µm, and it<br>
is further desirable to employ a hollow type with a void ratio of<br>
40% or more.<br>
For the binder, an aqueous resin is preferably used.<br>
For the aqueous resin, at least either a water-soluble resin<br>
or a water-dispersible resin can be suitably used. The<br>
water-soluble resin is not particularly limited and may be<br>
suitably selected in accordance with the intended use.<br>
Examples thereof include polyvinyl alcohol and modified products<br>
of polyvinyl alcohol such as anion-modified polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
cation-modified polyvinyl alcohol and acetal-modified polyvinyl<br>
alcohol; polyurethane; polyvinylpyrrolidone and modified<br>
products of polyvinylpyrrolidone such as copolymers of<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone and vinyl acetate, copolymers of<br>
vinylpyrrolidone and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate,<br>
copolymers of quaternized vinylpyrrolidone and<br><br>
dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate and copolymers of<br>
vinylpyrrolidone and methacrylamide propyl trimethyl<br>
ammonium chloride; celluloses such, as carboxymethyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxyethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose; modified<br>
products of cellulose such as cationated hydroxyethyl cellulose;<br>
synthetic resins such as polyester, polyacrylic acid (ester),<br>
melamine resins, modified products thereof, and copolymers of<br>
polyester and polyurethane; and poly(meth)acrylic acid,<br>
poly(meth)acrylamide, oxidized starch, phosphoric acid-esterified<br>
starch, self-modifying starch, cationated starch, various types of<br>
modified starch, polyethylene oxide, sodium polyacrylate and<br>
sodium alginate. Each of these may be used alone or in<br>
combination with two or more.<br>
Among these, polyvinyl alcohol, cation-modified polyvinyl<br>
alcohol, acetal-modified polyvinyl alcohol, polyester,<br>
polyurethane, copolymers of polyester and polyurethane, and the<br>
like are particularly preferable in terms of ink absorption.<br>
The water-dispersible resin is not particularly limited and<br>
may he suitably selected in accordance with the intended use.<br>
Examples thereof include polyvinyl acetate, ethylene-vinyl<br>
acetate copolymers, polystyrene, styrene-(meth)acrylic acid ester<br>
copolymers, (meth)acrylic acid ester polymers, vinyl<br>
acetate-(meth) acrylic acid (ester) copolymers, styrene-butadiene<br>
copolymers, ethylene-propylene copolymers, polyvinyl ethers and<br><br>
silicone-acrylic copolymers. Also, the water-dispersible resin<br>
may contain a crosslinking agent such as methylolated melamine,<br>
methylolated urea, methylolated hydroxypropylene urea or<br>
isocyanate or may be a copolymer with self-crosslinking ability<br>
that includes N-methylolacrylamide or other unit. A plurality of<br>
these aqueous resins can be used at the same time.<br>
The amount of the aqueous resin added is preferably 2<br>
parts by mass to 100 parts by mass, more preferably 3 parts by<br>
mass to 50 parts by mass, in relation to 100 parts by mass of the<br>
pigment. The amount of the aqueous resin added is determined<br>
such that the liquid absorption properties of the recording<br>
medium are within a desired range.<br>
When a water-dispersible colorant is used as the colorant,<br>
a cationic organic compound is not necessarily required for the<br>
coating layer, and a cationic organic compound mixed into the<br>
coating layer is not particularly limited and may be suitably<br>
selected in accordance with the intended use. Examples of the<br>
cationic organic compound mixed into the coating layer include<br>
monomers, oligomers and polymers of primary to tertiary amines<br>
and quaternary ammonium salts, that form insoluble salts by<br>
reacting with functional groups such as sulfonic acid group,<br>
carboxyl group and amino group in direct dye or acid dye present<br>
in water-soluble ink. Among these, oligomers and polymers are<br>
preferable.<br><br>
Examples of the cationic organic compound include<br>
dimethylamine-epichlorhydrin polycondensates,<br>
dimethylamine-ammonia-epichlorhydrin condensates,<br>
poly(trimethylaminoethyl methacrylate - methylsulfate),<br>
diallylamine hydrochloride-acrylamide copolymers,<br>
poly(diallylamine hydrochloride-sulfur dioxide), polyallylamine<br>
hydrochloride, poly(allylamine hydrochloride-diallylamine<br>
hydrochloride), acrylamide-diallylamine copolymers,<br>
polyvinylamine copolymers, dicyandiamide,<br>
dicyandiamide-ammonium chloride-urea-formaldehyde<br>
condensates, polyalkylene polyamine-dicyandiamide ammonium<br>
salt condensates, dimethyldiallylammonium chloride,<br>
polydiallylmethylamine hydro chloride,<br>
poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride),<br>
poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride-sulfur dioxide),<br>
poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride-diallylamine<br>
hydrochloride derivatives),<br>
acrylamide-diallyldimethylammonium chloride copolymers,<br>
acrylate-acrylamide-diallylamine hydrochloride copolymers,<br>
polyethylenimine, ethylenimine derivatives such as acrylamine<br>
polymers, and modified products of polyethylenimine alkylene<br>
oxides. Each of these may he used alone or in combination with<br>
two or more.<br>
Among these, any one of low-molecular cationic organic<br><br>
compounds such as dimethylamine-epichlorhydrin<br>
polycondensates and polyallylamine hydrochloride and any one of<br>
relatively high-molecular cationic organic compounds such as<br>
poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) are preferably combined<br>
together. The combination makes it possible to increase image<br>
density more than in the case of independent use and further<br>
reduce feathering.<br>
The cation equivalent of the cationic organic compound<br>
measured in accordance with a colloid titration method (using<br>
potassium polyvinyl sulfate and toluidine blue) is preferably<br>
3meq/g to 8meq/g. When the cation equivalent is in this range, a<br>
favorable result can be obtained with respect to the range of the<br>
amount of the cationic organic compound dried and attached.<br>
Here, in the measurement of the cation equivalent in<br>
accordance with the colloid titration method, the cationic organic<br>
compound is diluted with distilled water such that the solid<br>
content stands at 0.1% by mass, and pH adjustment is not made.<br>
The amount of the cationic organic compound dried and<br>
attached is preferably 0.3g/m2 to 2.0g/m2. When the amount of<br>
the cationic organic compound dried and attached is less than<br>
0.3g/m2, such effects as sufficient increase in image density and<br>
reduction in feathering may not be obtained.<br>
The surfactant included in the coating layer in accordance<br>
with the necessity is not particularly limited and may be suitably<br><br><br>

The method for forming the coating layer is not<br>
particularly limited and may be suitably selected in accordance<br>
with the intended use. For instance, a method in which the<br>
support is impregnated or coated with a coating layer solution<br>
can be employed. The method of impregnating or coating the<br>
support with the coating layer solution is not particularly limited<br>
and may be suitably selected in accordance with the intended use.<br>
For instance, the impregnation or the coating can be carried out<br>
using a coating machine such as a conventional size press, gate<br>
roll size press, film transfer size press, blade coater, rod coater,<br>
air knife coater, curtain coater or the like. Also, in view of cost,<br><br>
the support may be impregnated or coated with the coating layer<br>
solution using a conventional size press, gate roll size press, film<br>
transfer size press, etc. installed in a papermaking machine and<br>
may be finished using an on-machine coater.<br>

further includes other members, etc. suitably selected in<br>
accordance with the necessity.<br>
The container is not particularly limited, and the shape,<br>
structure, size, material and the like thereof may be suitably<br>
selected in accordance with the intended use. Suitable examples<br>
thereof include a container having an ink bag or the like formed<br>
of an aluminum laminated film, resin film, etc.<br>
Next, the ink cartridge will be explained with reference to<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2. Here, FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram exemplarily<br>
showing the ink cartridge of the present invention, and FIG. 2 is<br>
a schematic diagram exemplarily showing a modified example of<br>
the ink cartridge in FIG. 1.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the recording ink of the present<br><br>
invention is supplied, from an ink inlet (242) into an ink bag (241),<br>
and the ink inlet (242) is closed by means of fusion bonding after<br>
air is discharged. When the ink cartridge is used, an ink<br>
ejection outlet (243) made of a rubber member is pricked with a<br>
needle of an ink-jet recording apparatus main body (101) later<br>
described with reference to FIG. 3, and the ink is thus supplied to<br>
the apparatus main body (101).<br>
The ink bag (241) is formed of an air-impermeable packing<br>
member such as an aluminum laminated film. As shown in FIG.<br>
2, this ink bag (241) is normally housed in a plastic cartridge case<br>
(244) and detachably mounted on a variety of ink-jet recording<br>
apparatuses.<br>
The ink cartridge (201) of the present invention houses the<br>
recording ink (ink set) of the present invention and can be<br>
detachably mounted on a variety of ink-jet recording apparatuses.<br>
It is particularly desirable that the ink cartridge (201) be<br>
detachably mounted on the after-mentioned ink-jet recording<br>
apparatus of the present invention.<br>
(Ink-jet Recording Method and Ink-jet Recording Apparatus)<br>
The ink-jet recording method of the present invention<br>
includes at least an ink jetting step, and further includes other<br>
steps suitably selected in accordance with the necessity, such as a<br>
stimulus generating step and a controlling step.<br>
The ink-jet recording apparatus of the present invention<br><br>
includes at least an ink jetting unit, and further includes other<br>
units suitably selected in accordance with the necessity, such as a<br>
stimulus generating unit and a controlling unit.<br>
The ink-jet recording method of the present invention can<br>
be suitably performed by the ink-jet recording apparatus of the<br>
present invention, and the ink jetting step can be suitably<br>
performed by the ink jetting unit. Also, the other steps can be<br>
suitably performed by the other units.<br>
- Ink Jetting Step and Ink Jetting Unit -<br>
The ink jetting step is a step of jetting the recording ink of<br>
the present invention so as to form an image on a recording<br>
medium, by applying a stimulus (energy) to the recording ink.<br>
The ink jetting unit is a unit configured to jet the<br>
recording ink of the present invention so as to form an image on a<br>
recording medium, by applying a stimulus (energy) to the<br>
recording ink. The ink jetting unit is not particularly limited,<br>
and examples thereof include nozzles for ejecting ink.<br>
In the present invention, at least part of a liquid chamber,<br>
a fluid resistance unit, a diaphragm and a nozzle member of the<br>
ink-jet head is preferably formed of a material containing at least<br>
either silicone or nickel.<br>
Also, the diameter of the ink-jet nozzle is preferably 30µm<br>
or less, more preferably 1µm. to 20µm.<br>
The stimulus (energy) can, for example, be generated by<br><br>
the stimulus generating unit, and the stimulus is not particularly<br>
limited and may be suitably selected in accordance with the<br>
intended use. Examples thereof include heat (temperature),<br>
pressure, vibration and light. Each of these may be used alone<br>
or in combination with two or more. Among these, heat and<br>
pressure are suitable.<br>
Examples of the stimulus generating unit include heaters,<br>
pressurizers, piezoelectric elements, vibration generators,<br>
ultrasonic oscillators and lights. Specific examples thereof<br>
include a piezoelectric actuator such as a piezoelectric element, a<br>
thermal actuator that uses a thermoelectric conversion element<br>
such as an exothermic resistive element and utilizes phase<br>
change caused by film boiling of a liquid, a shape-memory-alloy<br>
actuator that utilizes metal phase change caused by temperature<br>
change, and an electrostatic actuator that utilizes electrostatic<br>
force.<br>
The aspect of the jetting of the recording ink is not<br>
particularly limited and varies according to the type or the like of<br>
the stimulus. In the case where the stimulus is "heat", there is,<br>
for example, a method in which thermal energy corresponding to<br>
a recording signal is given to the recording ink in a recording<br>
head, using a thermal head or the like, bubbles are generated in<br>
the recording ink by the thermal energy, and the recording ink is<br>
ejected as droplets from nozzle holes of the recording head by the<br><br>
pressure of the bubbles. Meanwhile, in the case where the<br>
stimulus is "pressure", there is, for example, a method in which<br>
by applying voltage to a piezoelectric element bonded to a site<br>
called a pressure chamber that lies in an ink flow path in a<br>
recording head, the piezoelectric element bends, the volume of<br>
the pressure chamber decreases, and thus the recording ink is<br>
ejected as droplets from nozzle holes of the recording head.<br>
It is desirable that the recording ink droplets jetted be, for<br>
example, 3x10-15m3 to 40xl0-15m3 (3pL to 40pL) in size, 5m/s to<br>
20m/s in ejection velocity, 1kHz or greater in drive frequency and<br>
300dpi or greater in resolution.<br>
The controlling unit is not particularly limited and may be<br>
suitably selected in accordance with the intended use, as long as<br>
it can control operations of the aforementioned units. Examples<br>
thereof include apparatuses such as a sequencer and a computer.<br>
Here, one aspect of performing the ink-jet recording<br>
method of the present invention by a serial-type ink-jet recording<br>
apparatus is explained with reference to the drawings. The<br>
ink-jet recording apparatus in FIG. 3 includes an apparatus main<br>
body (101), a paper feed tray (102) for feeding paper into the<br>
apparatus main body (101), a paper discharge tray (103) for<br>
storing paper which has been fed into the apparatus main body<br>
(101) and on which images have been formed (recorded), and an<br>
ink cartridge loading section (104). An operation unit (105)<br><br>
composed of operation keys, a display and the like is placed on<br>
the upper surface of the ink cartridge loading section (104). The<br>
ink cartridge loading section (104) has a front cover (245) capable<br>
of opening and closing to attach and detach the ink cartridge<br>
(201).<br>
In the apparatus main body (101), as shown in FIGS. 4 and<br>
5, a carriage (133) is freely slidably held in the main scanning<br>
direction by a guide rod (246), which is a guide member laterally<br>
passed between left and right side plates (not depicted), and a<br>
stay (247); and the carriage (133) is moved for scanning in the<br>
arrow direction in FIG. 5 by a main scanning motor (not<br>
depicted).<br>
A recording head (134) composed of four ink-jet recording<br>
heads which eject recording ink droplets of yellow (Y), cyan (C),<br>
magenta (M) and black (Bk) is installed in the carriage (133) such<br>
that a plurality of ink ejection outlets are aligned in the direction<br>
intersecting the main scanning direction and that the ink droplet<br>
ejection direction faces downward.<br>
For each of the ink-jet recording heads composing the<br>
recording head (134), it is possible to use, for example, a head<br>
provided with any of the following actuators as a<br>
energy-generating unit for ejecting ink: a piezoelectric actuator<br>
such as a piezoelectric element, a thermal actuator that uses a<br>
thermoelectric conversion element such as an exothermic<br><br>
resistive element and utilizes phase change caused by film<br>
boiling of a liquid, a shape-memory-alloy actuator that utilizes<br>
metal phase change caused by temperature change, and an<br>
electrostatic actuator that utilizes electrostatic force.<br>
Also, the carriage (133) incorporates sub-tanks (135) of<br>
each color for supplying the inks of each color to the recording<br>
head (134). Each sub-tank (135) is supplied and replenished<br>
with the recording ink of the present invention from the ink<br>
cartridge (201) of the present invention loaded into the ink<br>
cartridge loading section (104), via a recording ink supply tube<br>
(not depicted).<br>
Meanwhile, as a paper feed unit for feeding sheets of paper<br>
(142) loaded on a paper loading section (pressure plate) (250) of<br>
the paper feed tray (102), there are provided a half-moon roller<br>
(paper feed roller 143) which feeds the sheets of paper (142) one<br>
by one from the paper loading section (250), and a separation pad<br>
(144) which faces the paper feed roller (143) and is formed of a<br>
material with a large friction coefficient. This separation pad<br>
(144) is biased toward the paper feed roller (143) side.<br>
As a conveyance unit for conveying the paper (142), which<br>
has been fed from this paper feed unit, under the recording head<br>
(134), there are provided a conveyance belt (l5l) for conveying<br>
the paper (142) by means of electrostatic adsorption; a counter<br>
roller (152) for conveying the paper (142), which is sent from the<br><br>
paper feed unit via a guide (145), such that the paper (142) is<br>
sandwiched between the counter roller (152) and the conveyance<br>
belt (151); a conveyance guide (153) for making the paper (142),<br>
which is sent upward in the substantially vertical direction,<br>
change its direction by approximately 90° and thusly correspond<br>
with the conveyance belt (151); and an end pressurizing roller<br>
(155) biased toward the conveyance belt (151) side by a pressing<br>
member (154). Also, there is provided a charging roller (156) as<br>
a charging unit for charging the surface of the conveyance belt<br>
(151).<br>
The conveyance belt (151) is an endless belt and is capable<br>
of moving in circles in the belt conveyance direction, passed<br>
between a conveyance roller (157) and a tension roller (158).<br>
The conveyance belt (151) has, for example, a surface layer<br>
serving as a paper adsorbing surface, that is formed of a resinous<br>
material such as an ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene copolymer<br>
(ETFE) having a thickness of approximately 40µm for which<br>
resistance control has not been conducted, and a back layer<br>
(intermediate resistance layer, ground layer) that is formed of the<br>
same material as this surface layer, for which resistance control<br>
has been conducted using carbon. On the back of the conveyance<br>
belt (151), a guide member (161) is placed correspondingly to a<br>
region where printing is carried out by the recording head (134).<br>
Additionally, as a paper discharge unit for discharging the paper<br><br>
(142) on which images or the like have been recorded by the<br>
recording head (134), there are provided a separation pawl (171)<br>
for separating the paper (142) from the conveyance belt (151), a<br>
paper discharge roller (172) and a paper discharge small roller<br>
(173), with the paper discharge tray (103) being placed below the<br>
paper discharge roller (172).<br>
A double-sided paper feed unit (181) is mounted on a rear<br>
surface portion of the apparatus main body (101) in a freely<br>
detachable manner. The double-sided paper feed unit (181)<br>
takes in the paper (142) returned by rotation of the conveyance<br>
belt (151) in the opposite direction and reverses it, then refeeds it<br>
between the counter roller (152) and the conveyance belt (151).<br>
Additionally, a manual paper feed unit (182) is provided on an<br>
upper surface of the double-sided paper feed unit (181).<br>
In this ink-jet recording apparatus, the sheets of paper<br>
(142) are fed one by one from the paper feed unit, and the paper<br>
(142) fed upward in the substantially vertical direction is guided<br>
by the guide (145) and conveyed between the conveyance belt<br>
(151) and the counter roller (152). Further, the conveyance<br>
direction of the paper (142) is changed by approximately 90°, as<br>
an end of the paper (142) is guided by the conveyance guide (153)<br>
and pressed onto the conveyance belt (151) by the end<br>
pressurizing roller (155).<br>
On this occasion, the conveyance belt (151) is charged by<br><br>
the charging roller (156), and the paper (142) is electrostatically<br>
adsorbed onto the conveyance belt (151) and thusly conveyed.<br>
Here, by driving the recording head (134) according to an image<br>
signal while moving the carriage (133), ink droplets are ejected<br>
onto the paper (142) having stopped so as to carry out recording<br>
for one line, and after the paper (142) is conveyed by a<br>
predetermined distance, recording for the next line is carried out.<br>
On receipt of a recording completion signal or such a signal as<br>
indicates that the rear end of the paper (142) has reached the<br>
recording region, recording operation is finished, and the paper<br>
(142) is discharged onto the paper discharge tray (103).<br>
Once the amount of recording ink remaining in the<br>
sub-tanks (135) has been detected as too small, a required<br>
amount of recording ink is supplied from the ink cartridge (201)<br>
into the sub-tanks (135).<br>
As to this ink-jet recording apparatus, when recording ink<br>
in the ink cartridge (201) of the present invention has been used<br>
up, it is possible to replace only the ink bag (241) inside the ink<br>
cartridge (201) by dismantling the housing of the ink cartridge<br>
(201). Also, even when the ink cartridge (201) is longitudinally<br>
placed and employs a front-loading structure, it is possible to<br>
supply recording ink stably. Therefore, even when the<br>
apparatus main body (101) is installed with little space over it,<br>
for example when the apparatus main body (101) is stored in a<br><br>
rack or when an object is placed over the apparatus main body<br>
(101), it is possible to replace the ink cartridge (201) with ease.<br>
Here, a structural example of a subsystem (91) including<br>
the maintenance device for the ejection device according to the<br>
present invention is explained with reference to FIGS. 6 to 8.<br>
FIG. 6 is a plan view for explaining main parts of the subsystem<br>
(91), FIG. 7 is a schematic structural diagram of the subsystem<br>
(91), and FIG. 8 is a diagram for explaining the right side of the<br>
subsystem (91) in FIG. 6.<br>
Two cap holders (112A) and (112B) serving as a cap holding<br>
mechanism, a wiper blade (93) serving as a wiping member<br>
including an elastic body as a cleaning unit, and a carriage lock<br>
(115) are held in a frame (maintenance device frame) (111) of this<br>
subsystem in such a manner as to be able to ascend and descend<br>
(move up and down). Additionally, an idle ejection receiver (94)<br>
is placed between the wiper blade (93) and the cap holder (112A),<br>
and a wiper cleaner (118) serving as a cleaner unit including a<br>
cleaner roller (96) that is a cleaning member for pressing the<br>
wiper blade (93) from outside the frame (111) toward a wiper<br>
cleaner (95), which is a cleaning member for the idle ejection<br>
receiver (94), is oscillatably held to clean the wiper blade (93).<br>
The cap holders (112A) and (112B) (referred to as "cap<br>
holder (112)" when no distinction is made between these) hold two<br>
caps (92a) and (92b) and two caps (92c) and (92d) respectively,<br><br>
with nozzle surfaces of two recording heads being capped with the<br>
caps (92a) and (92b), and nozzle surfaces of other two recording<br>
heads being capped with the caps (92c) and (92d).<br>
Here, a tubing pump (suction pump) (120) serving as a<br>
suction unit is connected to the cap (92a) held by the cap holder<br>
(112A) on the side closest to the printing region, via a flexible<br>
tube (119), whereas the tubing pump (120) is not connected to the<br>
other caps (92b), (92c) and (92d). Specifically, only the cap (92a)<br>
is designed as a cap for suction (restoration) and moisture<br>
retention (hereinafter simply referred to as "suction cap"),<br>
whereas the other caps (92b), (92c) and (92d) are designed simply<br>
as caps for moisture retention. Accordingly, when a restoration<br>
operation is carried out on a recording head, the recording head<br>
to be restored is selectively moved to a position where it can be<br>
capped with the suction cap (92a).<br>
A cam shaft (121) that is freely rotatably supported by the<br>
frame (111) is placed below these cap holders (112A) and (112B),<br>
and this cam shaft (121) is provided with cap cams (122A) and<br>
(122B) for respectively allowing the cap holders (112A) and<br>
(112B) to ascend and descend, a wiper cam (124) for allowing the<br>
wiper blade (93) to ascend and descend, a carriage lock cam (125)<br>
for allowing the carriage lock (115) to ascend and descend by<br>
means of a carriage lock arm (117), a roller (126) as a rotating<br>
body that is an idle ejection target member to which droplets idly<br><br>
ejected are applied inside the idle ejection receiver (94), and a<br>
cleaner cam (128) for allowing the wiper cleaner (118) to oscillate.<br>
Here, the cap (92) is made to ascend and descend by the<br>
cap cams (122A) and (122B). The wiper blade (93) is made to<br>
ascend and descend by the wiper cam (124). When the wiper<br>
blade (93) descends, the wiper cleaner (118) advances, and as the<br>
wiper blade (93) descends while sandwiched between the cleaner<br>
roller (96) of the wiper cleaner (118) and the wiper cleaner (95) of<br>
the idle ejection receiver (94), ink that is attached to the wiper<br>
blade (93) is swept into the idle ejection receiver (94).<br>
The carriage lock (115) is biased upward (in the lock<br>
direction) by a compression spring (not depicted), and made to<br>
ascend and descend by means of the carriage lock arm (117)<br>
driven by the carriage lock cam (125).<br>
As for rotation of a motor (131), in order to drive the<br>
tubing pump (120) and the cam shaft (121) rotationally, a motor<br>
gear (132) provided on a motor shaft (131a) engages with a pump<br>
gear (133) provided on a pump shaft (120a) of the tubing pump<br>
(120); an intermediate gear (248) that is integrally formed with<br>
this pump gear (133) engages with an intermediate gear (136)<br>
having a one-way clutch (137), via an intermediate gear (249);<br>
and an intermediate gear (138) that is coaxial with this<br>
intermediate gear (136) engages with a cam gear (140) fixed to<br>
the cam shaft (121), via an intermediate gear (139).<br><br>
Additionally, an intermediate shaft (141) that is a rotating shaft<br>
for the intermediate gear (138) and for the intermediate gear<br>
(136) having the clutch (137) is rotatably supported by the frame<br>
(111).<br>
The cam shaft (121) is provided with a home position<br>
sensor cam (142) for detecting home positions, a home position<br>
lever (not depicted) is operated by means of a home position<br>
sensor (not depicted) in the subsystem (91) when the cap (92)<br>
reaches the bottom, and thus the sensor is brought into an open<br>
state and detects the home position of the motor (131) (excluding<br>
the pump (120)). When the power is on, the sensor moves up and<br>
down (ascends and descends) regardless of the position of the cap<br>
(92) (the cap holder (112)), does not carry out position detection<br>
until it starts moving, and moves to the bottom by traveling a<br>
predetermined distance after having detected the home position<br>
of the cap (92) (in the midst of ascending). Thereafter, the<br>
carriage moves from side to side and then returns to a capping<br>
position after having carried out position detection, and the<br>
recording head (134) is subjected to capping.<br>
Next, an idle ejection receiving section will be explained<br>
with reference to FIGS. 9 and 10. Note that FIG. 9 is a front<br>
cross-sectional view for explaining an idle ejection receiving<br>
section, and FIG. 10 is a diagram for explaining a side of the idle<br>
ejection receiving section.<br><br>
An idle ejection receiving section (200) includes the idle<br>
ejection receiver (94); a roller (203), which is an idle ejection<br>
target member, positioned on the lower side of the idle ejection<br>
receiver (94) and provided on the cam shaft (121); sweeping<br>
members (204A) and (204B) constituting a sweeping mechanism<br>
(204) for gathering recording solution attached to the inner<br>
surface of the wiper cleaner (95); and a sweeping member (205)<br>
for sweeping off recording solution attached to the roller (203)<br>
that is a rotating body. A waste solution tank (206) including an<br>
absorber (207) is placed below the idle ejection receiver (94).<br>
Here, as to the sweeping mechanism (204) for gathering<br>
recording solution attached to the inner surface of the wiper<br>
cleaner (95) of the idle ejection receiver (94), the bottoms of the<br>
sweeping members (204A) and (204B) are oscillatably supported<br>
by a pair of support shafts (210) provided at the bottom of a<br>
holder (251), and the sweeping members (204A) and (204B) are<br>
joined together by a joining member (211) with some play allowed<br>
in each.<br>
A pair of pin members (212) and (212) that can be brought<br>
into contact with the sweeping members (204A) and (204B) by<br>
rotation of the roller (203) are provided on a side face of the roller<br>
(203), which serves as a rotating body and is an idle ejection<br>
target member, provided on the cam shaft (121).<br>
As to each of the sweeping members (204A) and (204B), an<br><br>
end portion (204a) thereof is inclined so as to correspond with the<br>
inclined surface of the wiper cleaner (95). Also, each of the<br>
sweeping members (204A) and (204B) is provided with a convex<br>
portion (204b), which is for reducing the contact area at the time<br>
of oscillation, on the side facing the inner wall surface of the idle<br>
ejection receiver (94).<br>
Due to this configuration, when the wiper blade (93) is<br>
cleaned, recording solution removed from the wiper blade (93) is<br>
attached to the wiper cleaner (95).<br>
Here, when the roller (203) is rotated in the direction of<br>
the arrow E in FIG. 10 by rotation of the cam shaft (121), the pin<br>
members (212) and (212) of the roller (203) come into contact with<br>
the sweeping members (204A) and (204B), and thus the sweeping<br>
members (204A) and (204B) move back and forth in the directions<br>
of the arrows F and G (between the positions indicated by solid<br>
lines and the positions indicated by broken lines) in FIG. 10.<br>
Due to this back-and-forth movement of the sweeping members<br>
(204A) and (204B), the recording solution attached to the wiper<br>
cleaner (95) is gathered (collected) in one or several places on the<br>
end portion (204a) of each of the sweeping members (204A) and<br>
(204B), then a mass of the recording solution enlarges, and the<br>
recording solution flows under its own weight along the inner<br>
wall surface of the idle ejection receiver (94) and falls into the<br>
waste solution tank (206) below.<br><br>
In other words, in the case where a wiper cleaning<br>
mechanism is employed in which recording solution attached to<br>
the wiper blade (93) is pressed against the wiper cleaner (95) and<br>
thusly removed, simply pressing and moving the wiper blade (93)<br>
results in the recording solution remaining on an end of the wiper<br>
cleaner (95). Especially when the viscosity of the recording<br>
solution used is high, the recording solution remains on an end<br>
portion of the wiper cleaner (95), thereby possibly making it<br>
impossible to remove the recording solution attached to the wiper<br>
blade (93) the next time cleaning is carried out.<br>
Accordingly, even in the case where a high-viscosity<br>
recording solution is used, since the volume of droplets of the<br>
recording solution with respect to the surface in contact with the<br>
wiper cleaner (95) can be increased by collecting (gathering) in<br>
one or several places the recording solution attached to the wiper<br>
cleaner (95), the droplets easily fall (flow) from the surface in<br>
contact with the wiper cleaner (95), which enables the wiper<br>
blade (93) to be subsequently cleaned in a purified state, and thus<br>
the ability to clean the wiper blade (93) improves.<br>
According to an experiment, it was confirmed that when<br>
the viscosity of a recording solution was 5mPas or greater at<br>
25°C, the recording solution was liable to remain on a cleaner end,<br>
and the ability to remove the recording solution from a blade<br>
decreased the next time cleaning was carried out. When the<br><br>
sweeping members (204A) and (204B) were provided in light of<br>
the foregoing, it was confirmed that the recording solution<br>
effectively flowed downward.<br>
Moreover, the structure of the sweeping mechanism (204)<br>
can be simplified because the sweeping members (204A) and<br>
(204B) are operated by rotation of the roller (203), which is an<br>
idle ejection target member, provided on the cam shaft (121).<br>
Also, since the idle ejection receiver (94) houses the roller<br>
(203), which is an idle ejection target member, rotated by the cam<br>
shaft (121), a mist of idly ejected droplets can be reduced in speed<br>
or attached to the roller (203) and thusly collected. This makes<br>
it possible to prevent the mist of the recording solution from<br>
dispersing.<br>
Since the sweeping member (205) configured to sweep off<br>
recording solution attached to the roller (203) is provided, the<br>
recording solution attached to the roller (203) is swept off by the<br>
sweeping member (205) and falls under its own weight into the<br>
waste solution tank (206) below. As just described, a member<br>
configured to sweep off recording solution attached to the roller<br>
(203) is placed under the roller (203) and over a waste solution<br>
receiver (waste solution tank); by doing so, it becomes possible to<br>
remove the recording solution attached to the roller and dispose<br>
of it as a waste solution by a simple structure and at a low cost.<br>

Next, the recording inks of Examples 1 to 11 and<br>
Comparative Examples 1 to 5 were evaluated in accordance with<br>
the following evaluation methods. The results are shown in<br>
Tables 4 and 5.<br><solid content of ink><br>
The total amount of pigment and resin (emulsion +<br>
water-soluble resin) contained in each recording ink was<br>
calculated.<br><measurement of ink viscosity><br>
The viscosity of each ink was measured at 25°C using a<br>
viscometer (RE-80L, produced by Toki Sangyo Co., Ltd.).<br><measurement of surface tension ink><br>
The surface tension of each ink was measured at 25°C<br>
using an automatic surface tensiometer (CBVP-Z, produced by<br>
Kyowa Interface Science Co., Ltd.).<br><fluidity of ink residue><br>
[Dry Ink Residue]<br>
In a glass Petri dish having a diameter of 33mm, 2.5g of<br><br>
each of the recording inks of Examples and Comparative<br>
Examples, measured using a precision electronic scale balance<br>
capable of measuring weight down to four places of decimals, was<br>
placed. Then it was stored for 24hr in an ETAC constant<br>
temperature bath (manufactured by Kusumoto Chemicals, Ltd.)<br>
having a temperature of 50°C±0.5°C and a humidity of 12%±5%.<br>
After the storage, the ink residue was weighed using a precision<br>
electronic scale balance before absorbing moisture, and the<br>
evaporation rate of a solvent was calculated by means of<br>
Equation 1. Subsequently, the viscosity of this ink residue was<br>
measured at 25°C using an RE-550L viscometer (manufactured by<br>
Toki Sangyo Co., Ltd.) cone rotor 3°xR14.<br>
As to the ink of the present invention, as described above,<br>
the moisture content is normally 50% by weight or more, and the<br>
total amount of resin and pigment is normally 3% by weight or<br>
more. Thus, the evaporation rate of a solvent is normally 50%<br>
by weight to 97% by weight.<br>
[Ink Residue after Moisture Absorption]<br>
Subsequently, an ink residue placed in a glass Petri dish<br>
having a diameter of 33mm, which had been produced similarly to<br>
the aforementioned ink residue, was stored for 6hr in an ESPEC<br>
constant temperature bath (produced by ESPEC CORP.) having a<br>
temperature of 23°C±0.5°C and a high humidity of 95%±3%.<br>
After the storage, the ink residue having absorbed moisture was<br><br>
weighed using a precision electronic scale balance, and the<br>
amount of moisture contained in the ink residue was calculated<br>
by means of Equation 2. Subsequently, the viscosity of this ink<br>
residue was measured at 25°C using an RE-550L viscometer<br>
(manufactured by Toki Sangyo Co., Ltd.) cone rotor 3°xR14.<br>
It goes without saying that when this ink residue has a low<br>
viscosity at 25°C, it has high fluidity and is therefore harmless to<br>
a maintenance device for an ink ejection device.<br>
Equation 1- evaporation rate of solvent (% by weight) = (1 -<br>
amount of ink residue / total weight of ink)x100<br>
where the solvent denotes water and water-soluble organic<br>
solvent in the ink.<br>
Equation 2: amount of moisture contained in ink residue<br>
(% by weight) = (amount of moisture absorbed / total amount of<br>
ink residue that has absorbed moisture)x100<br>
Equation 3: equilibrium moisture content (%) = (amount of<br>
moisture absorbed in organic solvent / amount of organic solvent<br>
+ moisture absorbed in organic solvent)x100<br>
The reason why the testing method of [Dry Ink Residue]<br>
and [Ink Residue after Moisture Absorption] was employed is as<br>
follows. The test of [Dry Ink Residue] makes it possible to judge<br>
ink drying property on plain paper: an ink in which a dry ink<br>
residue has a viscosity of 20,000mPa.s or greater as described in<br>
claim 1 is superior in drying property on plain paper, whereas an<br><br>
ink in which a dry ink residue has a viscosity of less than<br>
20,000mPa.s is inferior in drying property on plain paper.<br>
Meanwhile, the test of [Ink Residue after Moisture Absorption]<br>
makes it possible to judge ejection stability and waste ink<br>
adhesion in the maintenance device for the ink ejection device: an<br>
ink in which an ink residue has a viscosity of less than 500mPa.s<br>
after moisture absorption as described in claim 1 enables waste<br>
ink adhesion to be notably reduced in the maintenance device for<br>
the ink ejection device, whereas an ink in which an ink residue<br>
has a viscosity of greater than 500mPa.s after moisture<br>
absorption causes waste ink adhesion in many places in the<br>
maintenance device and thus breakage of the maintenance device.<br>
The present invention has been completed by employing the<br>
testing method of [Dry Ink Residue] and [Ink Residue after<br>
Moisture Absorption].<br>

The amount of purified water transferred was measured in<br>
the following manner, with respect to each of the recording<br>
papers (1) to (4). The results are shown in Table 6.<br><measurement of transfer amount purified water by dynamic></measurement>
Scanning Absorptometer&gt;<br>
The absorption curve of purified water was measured<br>
using a dynamic scanning absorptometer (Model: KS350D,<br>
manufactured by Kyowaseiko Corporation), with respect to each<br>
of the recording papers (1) to (4). The absorption curve was<br>
made as a straight line with a fixed inclination by plotting<br><br>
transfer amount (mL/m2) against the square root of contact<br>
period (ms), and the values of the transfer amount after two<br>
different predetermined periods of time were measured by means<br>
of interpolation.<br><br>
The recording inks of Examples 1 to 4 were used on the<br>
recording papers (1) to (4) respectively, and image quality<br>
evaluations were carried out in the following manner, using an<br>
ink-jet recording apparatus (IPSIO G7570, manufactured by<br>
Ricoh Company, Ltd.).<br>
(1)	Beading (Nonuniformity of density)<br>
The extent of nonuniformity of density at each solid edge<br>
portion obtained was evaluated by visual observation.<br>
Evaluations with ranks were carried out using a classification<br>
sample (rank- 1.0 (poor) to 5.0 (excellent)).<br>
(2)	Spur mark<br>
The extent of offset smear that spread from each red solid<br><br>
portion to each background portion obtained, which was caused<br>
by a spur, was evaluated by visual observation. Evaluations<br>
with ranks were carried out according to the following criteria.<br>
Rank 1- clearly visible<br>
Rank 2- barely visible<br>
Rank 3- none whatsoever<br>
(3) Glossiness<br>
The 60-degree glossiness of each cyan solid portion<br>
obtained was measured using a glossmeter (4501, manufactured<br>
by BYK-Gardner GmbH).<br><br>
[1] The glossiness of the recording paper (4) could not be<br>
measured because it did not dry.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a recording<br>
ink which makes it possible to obtain an image excellent in<br>
quality to plain paper, particularly in image density and image<br>
durability such as water resistance, light resistance, etc., which<br><br>
is superior in drying rate and adaptability to high-speea printing,<br>
which is excellent in storage stability and ejection stability and<br>
which is harmless to a maintenance device for an ink ejection<br>
device; and an ink cartridge, a recording method, a recording<br>
apparatus and an ink recorded matter which use the recording<br>
ink.<br>
The recording ink is excellent in ejection stability from a<br>
nozzle, makes it possible to form high-quality images and can be<br>
suitably used for an ink cartridge, an ink recorded matter, an<br>
ink-jet recording apparatus and an ink-jet recording method.<br>
Furthermore, the recording ink causes less beading<br>
(nonuniformity of density), has superior drying properties and<br>
makes it possible to form images of high quality such as printing<br>
image quality, when general-purpose printing paper (a recording<br>
medium with low ink-absorbing ability, including a support, and<br>
a coating layer applied onto at least one surface of the support, in<br>
which the amount of purified water transferred to the recording<br>
medium at a contact period of 100ms measured by a dynamic<br>
scanning absorptometer is 2ml/m2 to 35ml/m2 and the amount of<br>
purified water transferred to the recording medium at a contact<br>
period of 400ms measured by the dynamic scanning<br>
absorptometer is 3ml/m2 to 40ml/m2) is used.<br>
The ink-jet recording apparatus and the ink-jet recording<br>
method of the present invention can be applied to a variety of<br><br>
types of recording based upon ink-jet recording systems. For<br>
example, they can be particularly suitably applied to ink-jet<br>
recording printers, facsimile apparatuses, copiers,<br>
printer/fax/copier complex machines, and so forth.<br><br>
