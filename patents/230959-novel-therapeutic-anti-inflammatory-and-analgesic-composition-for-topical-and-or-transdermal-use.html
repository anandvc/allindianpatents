				<td>This present invention relates to a novel therapeutic anti-inflammatory and analgesic composition containing Nimesulide which is N-(4 nitro, 2 phenoxyphenyl methane sulphonamide) for topical use.<br>
Transdermal route for administration of anti-inflammatory agents offers various advantages over the oral route such as lower dosage, less toxicity/side effects, no G.I irritation, no dose dumping in the body and it is more site specific (Chien YW; Novel Drug Delivery System, Marcel Dekker, New York, 1982).<br>
For a drug to be absorbed transdermal^, it has to travel across different layers of skin before reaching the site of action. These skin layers differ widely in nature; some are predominantly hydrophilic whereas others are lipophilic (Montagna W. Parrakhal PF: The structure and Function of the skin, 3rd ed. Academic press, New York, 1974). Due to this, the drug is required to have absorption. Highly hydrophobic drugs like Nimesulide or highly or highly hydrophilic drugs are considered poor candidates for transdermal drug delivery. When applied to the skin, such drugs are either not absorbed or absorbed in very minute amounts, not suitable therapeutic use.<br>
The Literature and the market surveys show that at present, there exists no properly effective percutaneous formulations of Nimesulide.<br>
In the patent for Nimesulide drug molecule (US Patent No. 3,840,597) the use of Nimesulide as an anti-inflammatory agent in the dose range of 1 mg to 500 mg per kg body weight in the form of cream, gel, tapes and the like has been cited. According to our studies, it was observed that the drug either precipitated out in the conventional formulation or precipitated on application to human skin when applied as a conventional gel or cream in the above stated dosage and practically no percutaneous absorption occurred. An over-riding difficulty is the inherent insolubility of the Nimesulide in aqueous media and hence the provision of a dosage form which can contain Nimesulide in sufficiently high concentration to permit convenient use and yet meet the required criteria in terms of bioavailability e.g. enabling effective absorption from the skin.<br>
According to the present invention, it has been found that it is possible to solubilise and deliver a  highly  hydrophobic drug  like  Nimesulide  to  the  site  of action  through<br><br>
transdermal route. The present invention involves the process of incorporation of Nimesulide in a formulation which can be solubilize the drug and transport it through the skin barriers, in intact condition, to the site of action.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel therapeutic composition containing Nimesulide in combination with other compounds which alter the physico-chemical property of Nimesulide, thus making it possible for the said composition to be used for direct application on the skin for the treatment of inflammation through transdermal absorption, at dose levels much lower than the dose levels according to the known art.<br>

The therapeutic composition prepared according to the present invention is not a mere admixture but has properties different from the sum total of the properties of its ingredients.<br>
The dose levels of the novel anti-inflammatory and analgesic composition, according to the present invention, are comparatively much lower than the dose levels of the<br><br>
conventional Nimesulide formulation for equally effective results.<br>
The various forms of the therapeutic composition prepared according to the present invention were subjected to in-vitro drug release studies using modified USP dissolution apparatus attached with enhancer cell (Pharm Tech. Jan. 1995, 52-58). The dissolution media used was phosphate buffer pH 7.4. The results indicated that the cumulative drug release and permeation flux were proportional to the drug load.<br>
The said compositions were also subjected to standard pharmacological test methods to measure anti-inflammatory activity such as rat paw oedema and guinea pig erythema. These tests showed significant activity when compared to placebo.<br>
The said therapeutic compositions were also tested on sixty healthy human volunteers for irritation or other undue side effect. No incidence of irritation/side effects was reported.<br>
