				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The instant invention is concerned with fused aromatics having one or more<br>
acid functional groups, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof,<br>
which are useful as therapeutic compounds, particularly in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes<br>
\_ mellitus, and of conditions that are often associated with this disease, including obesity and<br>
lipid disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Diabetes is a disease derived from multiple causative factors and characterized by elevated levels of plasma glucose (hyperglycemia) in the fasting state or after administration of glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test. There are two generally recognized forms of diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), patients produce little or no insulin, the hormone which regulates glucose utilization. In type 2 diabetes, or noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), insulin is still produced in the body. Patients having type 2 diabetes often have hyperinsulinemia (elevated plasma insulin levels); however, these patients are insulin resistant, which means that they have a resistance to the effect of insulin in stimulating glucose and lipid metabolism in the main insulin-sensitive tissues, which are muscle, liver and adipose tissues. Patients who are insulin resistant but not diabetic compensate for the insulin resistance by secreting more insulin, so that serum glucose levels are not elevated enough to meet the criteria of Type 2 diabetes. In patients with Type 2 diabetes, even elevated plasma insulin levels are insufficient to overcome the pronoimced insulin resistance.<br>
Persistent or uncontrolled hyperglycemia that occurs with diabetes is associated with increased and premature morbidity and mortality. Often abnormal glucose homeostasis is associated both directly and indirectly with obesity, hypertension, and alterations of the lipid, lipoprotein and apohpoprotein metabolism, as well as other metabolic and hemodynamic disease. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have a significantly increased risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications, including atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Therefore, therapeutic control of glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, obesity, and hypertension are critically important in the clinical management and treatment of diabetes mellitus.<br><br>
Many patients who have insulin resistance or Type 2 diabetes often have everal symptoms that together are referred to as syndrome X, or the metabolic syndrome. A atient having this syndrome is characterized as having three or more symptoms selected rom the following group of five symptoms: (1) abdominal obesity; (2) hypertriglyceridemia; 3) low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL); (4) high blood pressure; and (5) levated fasting glucose, which may be in the range characteristic of Type 2 diabetes if the »atient is also diabetic. Each of these symptoms is defined in the recently released Third leport of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation md Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel HI, or ATP HI), slational Institutes of Health, 2001, NIH Publication No. 01-3670. Patients with metabolic ;yndrome, whether or not they have or develop overt diabetes mellitus, have an increased risk )f developing the macrovascular and microvascular complications that are listed above that 3ccur with type 2 diabetes, such as atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.<br>
Insulin resistance is.not primarily caused by a diminished number of insulin receptors but by a post-insulin receptor binding defect that is not yet completely understood. Ihis lack of responsiveness to insulin results in insufficient insulin-mediated activation of uptake, oxidation and storage of glucose in muscle and inadequate insulin-mediated repression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and of glucose production and secretion in the liver. There are several available treatments for type 2 diabetes, each of which has its own limitations and potential risks. Physical exercise and a reduction in dietary intake of calories often dramatically improve the diabetic condition and are the best first line treatment of type 2 diabetes. Compliance with this treatment is very poor because of well-entrenched sedentary lifestyles and excess food consumption. A widely used drug treatment involves the administration of a sulfonylurea (e.g. tolbutamide or glipizide) or a meglitinide (e.g. repaglinide or nateglinide), which are insulin secretagogues. These drugs increase the plasma level of insulin by stimulating the pancreatic p-cells to secrete more insulin. The insulin secretagogues, especially the sulfonylureas, must be administered carefully, as they may cause insulin secretion regardless of whether insulin is needed to reduce serum glucose, so that the patient may develop hypoglycemia.<br>
The biguanides are another class of drugs that are widely used to treat type 2 diabetes. The two best known biguanides, phenformin and metformin, cause some correction of hyperglycemia without risk of causing hypoglycemia. The biguanides can be used either with insulin or with an insulin secretagogue without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. However, phenformin and metformin can induce lactic acidosis and nausea/diarrhea.<br><br>
Metformin has a lower risk of side effects than phenformin and is widely prescribed for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.<br>
The glitazones (i.e. 5-ben2ylthiazolidine-2,4-diones) arc a newer class of compounds that can ameliorate hyperglycemia and other symptoms of type 2 diabetes. These agents substantially increase insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver and adipose tissue in several animal models of type 2 diabetes, resulting in partial or complete coirection of elevated plasma glucose levels without the occurrence of hypoglycemia. The glitazones that are currently marketed (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) are agonists of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) gamma subtype. PPAR-gamma agonism is generally believed to be responsible for the improved insulin sensititization that is observed with the glitazones. New PPAR agonists are being developed for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes and/or dyslipidemia. Many of the newer PPAR compounds are agonists of one or more of the PPAR alpha, gamma and delta subtypes. Compounds that are agonists of both the PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma subtypes (PPAR alpha/gamma dual agonists), such as muraglitazar and tesaglitazar, are promising because they reduce hyperglycemia and also improve lipid metabolism.<br>
The drug therapies described above often become less effective or ineffective over extended periods of time (years), hisulin is often administered after the other therapies have become ineffective.<br>
PPAR agonists, and particularly glitazones, have had shortcomings which have so far detracted from their attractiveness. Some of the compounds, especially troglitazone, have exhibited liver toxicity. Troglitazone was eventually withdrawn from the marketplace because of hepatotoxicity. Another weakness in the currently marketed PPAR agonists is that monotherapy for type 2 diabetes produces only modest efficacy. The current compounds also do not greatly improve lipid metabolism, and may actually have a negative effect on the lipid profile. These shortcomings have provided an incentive to develop better insulin sensitizers for Type 2 diabetes which ftmction via similar mechanism(s) of action.<br>
Recently, there have been reports of compounds that are PPAR gamma antagonists or partial agonists. WOOl/30343 describes a specific compound that is a PPAR partial agonist^antagonist that is useful for the treatment of obesity and Type 2 diabetes. WO02/08188, WO2004/020408, WO2004/020409, and WO2004/019869 disclose classes of PPAR agonists and partial agonists that are indole derivatives and that are usefiil in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, with reduced side effects relating to body and heart weight gain. Fused aromatics as described herein have not been disclosed as having anti-diabetic activity.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The class of compounds described herein is a new class of PPAR-gamma agonists and partial agonists. The compounds are potent ligands of the PPAR gamma nuclear receptor. The class of compounds includes many compounds that are PPAR7 partial agonists, but also may include PPAR7 full agonists and/or PPAR7 antagonists. Some compounds may also have PPARa activity in addition to PPAR7 activity. The compounds are useful in the treatment and control of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. The compounds are expected to be efficacious in the treatment of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in human and other mammalian patients, particularly in the treatment of hyperglycemia, and in the treatment of conditions associated with NIDDM, including hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceriden^ria, atherosclerosis, vascular restenosis, inflammatory conditions, and other PPAR mediated diseases, disorders and conditions.<br>
The compounds may also be useful in the treatment of one or more lipid disorders, including mixed or diabetic dyslipidemia, isolated hypercholesterolemia, which may be manifested by elevations in LDL-C and/or non-HDL-C, hyperapoBliproteinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, an increase in triglyceride-rich-lipoproteins, and low HDL cholesterol concentrations. They may also be useful in the treatment or amelioration of atherosclerosis, obesity, vascular restenosis, inflammatory conditions, psoriasis, polycystic ovary syndrome, and other PPAR mediated diseases, disorders and conditions.<br>

Administration and Dose Ranees<br>
Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a mammal, especially a human, with an effective dose of a compound of the present invention. For example, oral, rectal, topical, parenteral, ocular, pulmonary, nasal, and the like may be employed. Dosage forms include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules, creams, ointments, aerosols, and the like. Preferably compounds of Formula I are administered orally.<br>
The effective dosage of active ingredient employed may vary depending on the particular compound employed, the mode of administration, the condition being treated and the severity of the condition being treated. Such dosage may be ascertained readily by a person skilled in the art.<br>
When treating or controlling diabetes mellitus and/or hyperglycemia or   . hypertriglyceridemia or other diseases for which compounds of Formula I are indicated, generally satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds of the present invention are administered at a daily dosage of from about 0.01 milligram to about 100 milligrams per kilogram of animal body weight, preferably given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to six times a day, or in sustained release form. For most large mammals, including humans (e.g. a 70 kg adult), the total daily dosage is from about 0.1 milhgrams to about 1000 milligrams, is likely to be from about 0.5 milligrams to about 350 milligrams, and is often from about 1 milligram to about 50 milligrams. For a particularly potent compound, the dosage for an adult human may be as low as 0.1 mg. Examples of daily dosages for a 70 kg<br><br>
adult human are 0.1 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, 250 mg, 350 mg, and 500 mg per day. The daily dosage regimen may be adjusted within the above ranges or even outside of these ranges to provide the optimal therapeutic response.<br>
Oral administration will usually be carried out using tablets. Examples of doses in tablets which may be administered once a day or more than once a day (e.g. 2x, 3x, or (rarely) 4 or more times per day, are 0.1 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, 250 mg, 350 mg, and 500 mg. Other oral forms (e.g. capsules or suspensions) can also be administered in doses having similar sizes.<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions which comprise a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt as an active ingredient, as well as a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic bases or acids and organic bases or acids. A pharmaceutical composition may also comprise a prodrug, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, if a prodrug is administered.<br>
The compositions include compositions suitable for oral, rectal, topical, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), ocular (ophthalmic), pulmonary (nasal or buccal inhalation), or nasal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the conditions being treated and on the nature of the active ingredient. They may be conveniently presented in imit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well-known in the art of pharmacy. In general, compositions suitable for oral administration are preferred.<br>
In practical use, the compounds of Formula I can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral (including intravenous). In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as<br><br>
starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets, with the solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations.<br>
Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are employed. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0,1 percent of active compoimd. The percentage of active compound in these compositions may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 percent to about 60 percent pf the weight of the unit. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage will be obtained. The active compounds can also be administered intranasally as, for example, liquid drops or spray.<br>
The tablets, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, com starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as com starch, potato starch, alginic acid; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin. When a dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil.<br>
Various other materials may be present as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor.<br>
Compounds of formula I may also be administered parenterally. Solutions or suspensions of these active compoimds can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, hquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.<br>
The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable imder the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of<br><br>
microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g. glycerol, propylene glycol and iquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.<br>
[Combination Therapy<br>
Compounds of Formula I may be used in combination with other drugs that may also be useful in the treatment or amelioration of the diseases or conditions for which compounds of Formula I are useful. Such other drugs may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefor, contemporaneously or sequentially with a compound of Formula I.  When a compound of Formula I is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form containing such other drugs and the compound of Formula I is preferred. However, the combination therapy also includes therapies in which the compound of Formula I and one or more other drugs are administered on different overlapping schedules. It is also contemplated that when used in combination with one or more other active ingredients, the compound of the present invention and the other active ingredients may be used in lower doses than when each is used singly. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include those that contain one or more other active ingredients, in addition to a compound of Formula I.<br>

Agonism is determined by comparison of maximal transactivation activity with a full PPAR agonist, such as rosiglitazone. Generally, if the maximal stimulation of transactivation is less than 50% of the effect observed with a full agonist, then the compoimd is designated as a partial agonist. If the maximal stimulation of transactivation is greater than 50% of the effect observed with a full agonist, then the compound is designated as a full agonist. The compoimds of this invention generally have EC50 values in the range of InM to 3000 nM.<br>

The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to RT and then poured into a biphasic mixture containing IPAc (220 mL) and aq. K2CO3 (20.7 g in 117.3 g water) at RT with stirring. The organic layer was separated, washed with sat. NaHCOa (80 mL), and then water (80 mL). The isolated IPAc solution was subjected to a solvent switch to DMF (80 mL) in vacuo,<br>
A solution of 4-chlorophenol (12.2 g, 0.095 mol) in 36.6 mL of DMF was added at room temperature to the above solution (19.6 g of ester 2, 0.095 mol), followed by addition of triethylamine (17.3 mL, 0.124 mol) at 20-22 °C over 15 min. Solid DABCO (1.6 g, 14.2 nmiol) was added to the resulting solution in one portion. A temperature increase of --3 **C was observed. A water bath was used to maintain the reaction temperature. The reaction was stirred at 22-24 °C for 4-5 h while monitoring by LC imtil all of the 4-chlorophenol was consumed, resulting in a light slurry,   AcOH (2.72 mL, 47.5 mmol) and IPA (57.5 mL) were added to the light sl\my, followed by cold water (30 mL) to maintain the internal temperature at 20-25 **C. When the water was added, a clear solution first formed, and then a slurry of product formed. After stirring at RT for 0.5 h, additional water (86 mL) was added over 0.5 h. After the slurry was stirred at RT for 1-2 h, it was filtered. The filter cake was washed with mixed solvents (60 mL of IPA:H20 = 1:1).
