[0004]<br>
Recently, it has been strongly demanded that a luggage hanging hock is provided for hanging strap pcrtions of a bag, a snooping bag, or the like in an inner box equipped type of<br><br>
a two-wheeled motor vehicle as described in above-described<br>
patent document 1. [0005]<br>
However, in a case where a luggage hanging hook is provided in an inner box structure of the two-wheeled motor vehicle described in above-described patent document 1, and the luggage hanging hook is mounted in an upper portion of the containing recess, there is a possibility of this mounting portion to be exposed outside. Therefore, an improvement in appearance is desired. [0006]<br>
In addition, in the inner box structure of the two-wheeled motor vehicle described in above-described patent document 1, a sealing mechanism equips a sealing member such as a rubber packing around the containing recess.   Therefore, when a different member such as the luggage hanging hook is tried 10 be mounted so as to stride over the circumference of the containing recess,  one portion of the sealing member is interrupted by the luggage hanging hook, resulting in causing a portion where a rib of the lid cannot abut on the sealing member. This is also a problem to be addressed.<br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention has been made in view of the forgoing circumstances. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an inner box structure of a two-wheeled motor vehicle in which sealing performance of an inner box can be surely secured and appearance can be preferable even when a luggage hanging hook is mounted so as :o stride ever a circumference of a containing recess. means for Solving the Problems:<br><br>
[0008]<br>
To achieve the above-described object, the invention defined in Claim 1 is characterized by an inner box structure of a two-wheeled motor vehicle in which a containing recess is provided on the rear side of a legshield and an opening portion of the containing recess is openably covered with a lid. The inner box structure is also characterized by including a luggage hanging hook having a mounting portion, which is disposed inside the containing recess and which is covered over with the lid when the lid occludes the containing recess, and a hook portion, whish is provided so as to protrude out of the containing recess. Moreover, the inner box structure is characterized in that a first sealing ridge portion is provided in an upper position of the mounting portion of the luggage hanging hook and a second sealing ridge portion is provided around an inner circumference of the containing recess, and a space between the lid and the containing recess is sealed by causing the first and second sealing ridge portions to abut on a sealing member provided around an entire inner circumference of the lid.<br>
[0009]<br>
In addition to the configuration described in the invention defined in Claim 1, the invention defined in Claim 2 is characterized in that end portions of the first sealing ridge portion of the luggage hanging hook and corresponding end portions of the second sealing ridge portion of the containing recess continuing to the end portion of the first sealing ridge oortion are stacked with each other.<br>
[0010]<br>
In addition to the configuration described in the<br>
invention defined in Claim 1, "he invention cefinec in Claim<br><br>
3 is characterized in that connecting grooves with V-shaped cross sections are provided at end portions of the first sealing<br>
ridge portion of the luggage hanging hook and connecting portions with V-shaped cross sections,  fitting into the connecting grooves, are provided at end portions of the second sealing ridge portion of the containing recess,  and the connecting grooves and the corresponding connecting portions are stacked with each other. [Effects of the Invention] [0011]<br>
According to the inner box structure of the two-wheeled motor vehicle defined in Claim 1, a luggage hanging hook having a mounting portion, which is provided inside a containing recess and which is covered over with a lid when the lid occludes the containing recess, and a hook portion, which is provided so as to protrude out of the containing recess, is included. A first sealing ridge portion is provided in an upper position of the mounting portion of the luggage hanging hook and a second sealing ridge portion is provided around an inner circumference of the containing recess. A space between the lid and the containing recess is sealed by causing the first and second sealing ridge portions to abut on a sealing member provided around an entire inner circumference of the lid. Therefore, the mounting portion of the luggage hanging hook is covered over with the lid, and this prevents the mourning portion from being exposed outside and also prevents "he appearance of the circumference of the inner box from being danaged. Thus, the creferable appearance thereof can be obtained. In addition, since "he space between the lid and the containing recess can be surelv sealed, the sealing capability of the inner box car^<br><br>
be surely secured. [0012]<br>
According to the inner box structure of the two-wheeled motor vehicle defined in Claim 2, the end portions of the first sealing ridge portion of the luggage hanging hook and the corresponding end portions of the second sealing ridge portion of the containing recess continuing to the end portions of the first sealing ridge portion are stacked with each other. Therefore, it is possible to improve continuity of the stacked portions between the end portions of the first and second sealing ridge portions. This prevents the sealing capability in the stacked portion from being deteriorated, so that the preferable sealing capability can be obtained without applying adhesive or seal adhesive. [0013]<br>
According to the inner box structure of the two-wheeled motor vehicle defined in Claim 3, connecting grooves with V-shaped cross sections are provided at the end portions of the first sealing ridge portion of the luggage hanging hook and connecting portions with V-shaped cross sections, fitting into the connecting grooves, are provided at the end portions of the second sealing ridge portion of the containing recess. 3y causing the connecting grooves and the corresponding connecting portions to be stacked with each other, preferable adhesion can be secured in the stacked portions between the connecting grooves and the connecting portions 72a, so That the sealing capability of the inner box can be surely secured.<br>
i - ^ - - J<br>
In addition, the V-shapedconnecting grooves end thee<br>
corresponding V-shaped connecting portion arestacked with<br><br>
each other. Accordingly, even when a dimension error is caused by difference in die cutting directions at the time of forming the luggage hanging hook and the legshield, contact between the connecting grooves and the connecting portions can be preferable. Thereby, without improving dimension accuracy of the luggage hanging hook and the legshield, the preferable contact between the members can be obtained and manufacturing costs can be reduced.<br>

As shewn in FIG. 9, when the luggage hanging .heck 40 is housed  in   -he   recess  portion   22a   of   "he   ccn.eining   recess   42<br><br>
and is fixed with the bolt 39, the first sealing ridge portion 40e of the luggage hanging hook 40 and the second sealing ridge portion 67 formed on an inner circumference edge portion of the containing recess 42 are sequentially disposed. Thereby, a sealing ridge portion is formed, sequentially encircling the circumference of the containing recess 42. [0031]<br>
In addition, as shown in FIGS, 2 and 10, a recessed member 63 including a groove 61 opened to the containing recess 42 side is formed along a portion corresponding to the entire inner circumference of the lid 43 and the partition wall 45. A sealing member 64 such as a rubber packing is inserted and mounted in this groove 61. Then, the above-described first and second sealing ridge portions 40e and 67 and the sealing member 64 are pressure-contacted (abut on), and this contact seals between the lid 43 and the containing recess 42, hence preventing rainwater, dusts, or the like from intruding into the inside of the containing recess 42. [0032]<br>
The first and second sealing ridge portions 40e and 67 are formed with substantially V-shaped cross sections with tip ends thereof facing the sealing member 64, so that the tip ends -hereof are buried in the sealing member 64 when the lid 43 is<br>
ClC56u-<br>
r^  W  M  —' W  J<br>
In addition, in this embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 9 to 11,, the first and second sealing ridge portions 40e and 67 are overlapped in a way that the end portions 71 of zhe first sealing ricce ocriicn 40e and the corresponding end pcrticr.s T2 cf the seccr.c sealing ridge portion 67 continiuing this end portions<br><br>
71 are stacked with each other. [0034]<br>
In addition, in this embodiment, es shown in FIGS. 4 to 11, connecting grooves 71a with V-shaped cross sections are formed at the end portions 71 of the first sealing ridge portion 40e, and connecting portion 72a with V-shaped cross sections are formed at the end portions 72 of the second sealing ridge portion 67, fitting into the connecting grooves 71a. The connecting grooves 71a- and the corresponding connecting portions 72a are stacked with each other, and thereby, the first and second sealing ridge portions 40e and 67 are overlapped. [0035]<br>
Furthermore, in this embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 4, 5, 3, and 11, R faces 71b are formed at the end portions 71 of the first sealing ridge portion 40e. A tip end portion of a substantially V-shaped R face 71b faces toward the inside and a thickness thereof in the anteroposterior direction becomes thinner from the tip end portion thereof toward the outside. These R faces 71b cause contact portions between the first sealing ridge portion 40e and the second sealing ridge portion 75 to be smoothly curved so as to improve contact between the first and second projected rims 40e and 67 and the sealing member 54. It should be noted that, in stead of the R face 71b, the end portion 71 of the first sealing ridge portion 40e may be f crimed with a smooth inclined plane. [0C361<br>
As described above, according to "his embodimentt, the inner box structure of the two-wheeled ncrcr vehicle includes the luggage hanging hock 40 having the mourning.portion 4oB whichis provided inside the containing recess 42 and covered<br><br>
over with the lid 43 when the lid 43 occludes the containing recess 42; and the hook portion 40c, which is provided so as to protrude out of the containing recess 42.   In addition, the first sealing ridge portion 4 0e is provided in the upper position of the mounting portion 40b of the luggage hanging hook 40 and the second sealing ridge portion 67 is provided around the entire inner circumference of the containing recess 42. The first sealing ridge portion 40e and the second sealing ridge portion 67 are caused to abut on a sealing member 64 provided around an entire inner circumference of the lid 43A, and thereby, a space between the lid 43 and the containing recess 42 is sealed. Therefore, the mounting portion of the luggage hanging hook is covered over with the lid 43, and it prevents the mounting portion from being exposed outside and also prevents the appearance of the circumference of the inner box from being damaged.  Thus, the appearance thereof can be kept preferable. In addition, since the space between the lid and the containing recess can be surely sealed, the sealing capability of the inner box can be definitely secured. [0037]<br>
In addition, according to the inner box structure of the two wheeled motor vehicle of this embodiment, the mounting portion 40b of the luggage hanging hook 40 can be moved into the inside of the containing recess 42. Therefore, the luggage hanging hook 40 can be fixed together with "he legshield 22 on the vehicle body. "With this, the stay for fixing the legshield 22 can be also used for fixing the luggage hanging hook 40. Therefore, there is no need to add a reinforcir.r stay and a mourning belt fcr fixing the luggage hanging hook 40 , so that it is possible tc suppress increase ir.cost by increasing<br><br>
the numbers of parts and assembly processes. [0038]<br>
In addition, according to the inner box structure of the two-wheeled motor vehicle of this embodiment, the end portions 71 of the first sealing ridge portion 40e of the luggage hanging hook 40 and the corresponding end portions 72 of the second sealing ridge portion 67 of the containing recess 42 continuing to the end portions 71 of the first sealing ridge portion 40e, are stacked with each other. Therefore, it is possible to improve continuity of the stacked portions between the end portions 71 and 72 of the first and second sealing ridge portions 4 0e and 67 . This prevents the sealing capability in the stacked portion from being deteriorated, so that the preferable sealing capability can be obtained without applying adhesive or seal adhesive. [0039]<br>
In addition, according to the inner box structure of the two-wheeled motor vehicle of this embodiment, the connecting grooves 71a with the V-shaped cross sections are provided at the end portions 71 of the first sealing ridge portion 40e of the luggage hanging hook 40 and the connecting portions 72a with the Y-shaped cross sections, fitting into the connecting groove 72af are provided at the end portions n2 of the second sealing ridge portion 67 of the containing recess 42. By causing the connecting grooves 71a and the cor res per, ding connecting r-ortions72a to be stacked with each orher, preferable adhesion can be secured in the stacked portions of the connecting grooves "la and the connecting portions 72a, so "that" "he sealing. capability of "he inner box can be surely secured.<br><br>
In addition, according to the inner box structure of the two-wheeled motor vehicle of this embodiment, the V-shaped connecting grooves 71a and the corresponding V-shaped connecting portions 72a are stacked with each other. Accordingly, even when a dimension error is caused by difference in die cutting directions at the time of forming the luggage hanging hook 4 0 and the legshield 22, contact between the connecting grooves 71a and the connecting portions 72a can be preferable. Thereby, without improving dimension accuracy of the luggage hanging hook 40 and the legshield 22, the preferable contact between the members can be obtained and manufacturing costs can be reduced. [0041]<br>
In addition, according to the inner box structure of the two-wheeled motor vehicle of this embodiment, in the lid 43, the stepped face 50, in which the locking member 51 is mounted, is formed on the more inner side than the other surface. Thereby, the length of the locking member 51 can be shortened. At the same time capacity of the inner box can be enlarged by enlarging the depth of the inner box in the anteroposterior direction. [0042]<br>
In addition, according to the inner box structure of the nvc-wheeled motor vehicle of this embodiment, the latching portion 40d, which seizes the locking piece 51a of the locking r.eir3er 51 included in the lid 43, is provided to the luggage hanging hook 40. Therefore, there is no need to prepare parts for seizing the locking member 51, and the numbers of the parts<br><br><br>
for this latching hole becomes unneeded, so that the inner box<br>
structure can be simple.<br>
[0043]<br>
Furthermore, according to the inner box structure of the two-wheeled motor vehicle of this embodiment, in the center portion of the containing recess 4 2 in the legshield 22, the substantially U-shaped recessed portion 22a, the recessed groove 22b, which upper end is communicated with the recessed portion 22a and which lower end is communicated with the drain outlet 22c, and the substantially U-shaped partition wall 45 are provided. Therefore, even when intrusion of rainwater, dusts or the like is caused in the vicinity of the luggage hanging hook 40, the rainwater, the dusts or the like are gathered in the lower portion by the recessed portion 22a, the recessed groove 22b, and the partition wall 45, and discharged immediately from the drain outlet 22c. Therefore, the intrusion of rainwater, dusts, or the like into the containing recess 42 can be surely prevented.<br>
