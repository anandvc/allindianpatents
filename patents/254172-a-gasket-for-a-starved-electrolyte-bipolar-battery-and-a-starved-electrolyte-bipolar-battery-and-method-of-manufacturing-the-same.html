				<td>pressure relief valve is also introduced to prevent a too high<br>
pressure to build up inside the case. It is however rather<br>
expensive to manufacture a bipolar battery of this design and<br>
it is therefore, a need to construct a new bipolar battery<br>
having less number of components and using less complicated<br>
processing steps to manufacture a bipolar battery.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a gasket that<br>
will simplify the manufacturing process of a bipolar battery.<br>
This object is achieved by the features in the characterizing<br>
portion of claim 1.<br>
A further object is to provide a bipolar battery that is easy<br>
to manufacture.<br>
This object is achieved by the features in the characterizing<br>
portion of claim 13.<br>
Still a further object of the invention is to provide a method<br>
for manufacturing a bipolar battery, using the gasket that is<br>
simplified compared to prior art methods.<br>
This object is achieved by the features in the characterizing<br>
portion of claim 30.<br>
An advantage with the present invention is that more energy<br>
may be stored in the battery compared to prior art batteries,<br>
since the gasket acts a hydrophobic barrier, a pressure tight<br>
sealing and provides means to create a common gas space within<br>
the battery. This in turn makes it possible to more<br>
efficiently use the available space and larger electrodes may<br>
be used compared to prior art batteries.<br><br>
Another advantage is that the present invention provides<br>
additional cost and assembly benefits compared to prior art<br>
devices.<br>
Further objects and advantages of the present invention will<br>
be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following<br>
detailed description of the disclosed bipolar electr-ochemical<br>
battery and the biplate assembly.<br>

Detailed description of preferred embodiments<br>
The major benefits of the bipolar battery design are<br>
simplicity and low resistance losses. The parts count of the<br>
battery is relative low, consisting only of endplates and<br>
biplates, with appropriate assembly of electrodes, separators<br>
and electrolyte and sealing components. Batteries of a desired<br><br><br>
voltage are constructed by stacking the required number of<br>
biplates.. The electrical connections between the cells are<br>
made as the battery is stacked, since each biplate is<br>
electrically conductive and impervious to electrolyte.<br>
With the terminals at each end, the flow of current is<br>
perpendicular to the plate, which ensures uniform current and<br>
voltage distribution. Since the current path is very short the<br>
voltage drop is significantly reduced.<br>
Bipolar batteries will also have significantly reduced weight,<br>
volume and manufacturing costs due to elimination of<br>
components and the manufacturing approach. '<br>
The major problem with bipolar batteries is obtaining a<br>
reliable seal between cells within the bipolar battery.<br>
Different solutions to this problem have been disclosed in the<br>
published international patent applications WO 03/009413, WO<br>
03/026055 and WO 03/026042, and. in the non-published pending<br>
US applications 10/434157 and 10/434168, all assigned to the<br>
present applicant, and hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The seal on a cell is of extreme importance for all types of<br>
batteries, and bipolar batteries are no. exception. Individual<br>
cells contain the active materials (for NiMH batteries it is<br>
Nickel hydroxide positive and metal hydride hydrogen storrage<br>
alloy negative, respectively), separator and electrolyte. The<br>
electrolyte in the separator is required for ion transport<br>
between the electrodes and the separator provides insulation<br>
to the conduction of electronic current flow between the<br>
electrodes. The best designs, optimised for longevity, weight<br>
and volume, require recombination of gasses.<br>
Batteries always produce gasses as they are charged. The<br>
) gassing rate increases as the battery nears full charqe, and<br><br><br>
reaches maximum when fully charged. The gasses which are<br>
produced are primarily oxygen and hydrogen.<br>
For Nickel based bipolar batteries, such as NiMH and NiCd,<br>
oxygen will recombine relatively rapidly with available active<br>
material in the negative electrode. Batteries are normally<br>
designed so oxygen will be the first gas generated if the cell<br>
is overcharged. This requires two actions:<br>
1)	Overbuild the negative active material, generally by 30%,<br>
to ensure that the positive electrode, which will gas oxygen<br>
on charge, will be the first to gas.<br>
2)	In a starved electrolyte battery, provide for gas passage<br>
from the positive to the negative, where the oxygen will<br>
recombine. The gas passages are obtained by controlling the<br>
amount of electrolyte within the pores of the electrode and<br>
through the separator. All surfaces of the electrode must be<br>
covered by a thin layer of electrolyte for the transport of<br>
ions, but the layer must be thin enough to permit gas<br>
diffusion through the layer, and must allow gas passages<br>
throughout the active layers and the separator.<br>
The negative electrode would gas hydrogen if overcharged.<br>
Because gaseous Hydrogen does not recombine quickly, pr-essure -<br>
would build up within the cell. The oxygen recombination<br>
effectively discharges the negative at the same rate it is<br>
being charged, thus preventing overcharge of the negative.<br>
The surface area of the active material, combined with the<br>
uniform voltage distribution of the bipolar design, enhances<br>
rapid recombination.<br><br><br>
For clarity sake, a starved electrolyte battery is defined as<br>
is an essentially" moist but not wet construction, as opposed<br>
to flooded batteries like a typical lead acid car battery.<br>
The bipolar approach will ensure that the voltage drop across<br>
the active material will .be uniform in all areas, so that the<br>
entire electrode will come up to full charge at the same time.<br>
This will eliminate the major problem in conventional<br>
constructions, where parts of an electrode are overcharging<br>
and gassing while other (remote) areas of the electrode are<br>
not yet fully charged.<br>
The cells in regular batteries are sealed to contain the<br>
electrolyte both for proper performance of the cells, and to<br>
prevent electrolyte paths, i.e. continuous ionically<br>
conductive paths, between adjacent cells. The presence of<br>
electrolyte paths between cells will allow the electrolyte-<br>
connected cells to..discharge, at a rate that is determined by<br>
the resistance of the path (length of path and cross section<br>
of path) . The seals on bipolar batteries are more important<br>
because the electrolyte path is potentially much shorter. It<br>
should be noted that an important feature of this disclosure<br>
is the use of a gasket with an integrated electrolyte barrier<br>
to minimize, or eliminate the conductivity of any potential<br>
ionic conduction path. An additional concern is the amount of<br>
heat generated by operation of the cell. Depending on the<br>
magnitude of heat generated, the design must be able to reject<br>
the heat and maintain a safe operating temperature.<br>
If an electrolyte path is developed between cells, a small<br>
intercellular leakage can be overcome by the periodic, full .<br>
charging of the battery. The battery may be overcharged, by a<br>
set amount and at a low rate. The low rate would allow fully<br>
charged cells to recoinbins gasses without generating pressure<br><br><br>
and dissipate the heat from the recombination/overcharge.<br>
Cells that have small intercellular electrical leakage paths<br>
would become balanced.<br>
It is rarely necessary that a battery be fully charged to<br>
achieve its useful function. Batteries are routinely over<br>
specified and overbuilt. If an operation requires 50 AH<br>
(Ampere Hours), the requirement is usually specified at least<br>
10% higher. Since batteries lose capacity over their lifetime,<br>
the capacity of a new battery is increased by the expected<br>
loss, resulting in possibly a 70 AH requirement for a new<br>
battery in this example. The manufacturer will probably have a<br>
median design target of 75 AH to allow for variations in the<br>
manufacturing process. Much of this overbuild is to compensate<br>
for the life capacity degradation that is caused by the<br>
overcharging.<br>
An essential feature in the novel bipolar batteries are the<br>
creation of a common gas space within the battery. The means<br>
for creating a common gas space for all cells in a bipolar<br>
battery comprises a gasket having a predetermined shape. The<br>
gasket is arranged between adjacent biplates and/or a biplate<br>
and an end plate, as described below. The gasket is preferably<br>
made with a thermoplastic elastomer compound that forms a seal<br>
with the biplate under pressure. One or more gas channels are<br>
molded into the frame to ensure gas leakage path. When several<br>
gaskets are stacked upon each other, as described in<br>
connection with figure 7, a common gas space will be created<br>
which will eliminate the pressure difference between the cells<br>
in a bipolar battery.<br>
Figure 1 shows a first embodiment of a gasket 10 according to<br>
the invention. The gasket 10 is manufactured in a hydrophobic<br>
material having deformable properties, such as an elastomer or<br><br><br>
other material that create a continuous seal when deformed, to<br>
be able to function as a sealing. The gasket preferably has<br>
elastic properties, and a suitable material is a thermoplastic<br>
elastomer. Thermoplastic elastomers may be obtained from<br>
several manufacturers e.g. Engage® 8407 available from DuPont<br>
Dow Elastomers, DYNAFLEX® G2780-001 available from GLS Corp.<br>
or KRATON™ G-7705 available from Kraton™ Polymers. The gasket<br>
is preferably injection molded into the desired size and<br>
shape.<br>
The gasket 10 is provided with a rim 11 at the edge on the<br>
upper side and a corresponding indentation 12 on the reverse<br>
side. The rim 11 and the indentation 12 will provide alignment<br>
of the gaskets when they are stacked upon each other in an<br>
assembled battery, see figure 7. The rim further serves to<br>
al ign the biplate relative to the gasket. The gasket is<br>
further provided with a through-hole 13 and a groove 14 to<br>
connect the through-hole 13 to the space on the inside of the<br>
gasket 10 when a biplate is mounted to the gasket. The<br>
through-hole 13 and the groove 14 provide a gas channel<br>
between adjacent cells in the assembled battery, and the<br>
hydrophobic properties of the gasket prevent electrolyte from<br>
creating an ionically conductive path between acljacent cells.<br>
The gasket thus has four purposes when mounted:<br>
1)	prevent electrolyte from creating an ionically conductive<br>
path (leakage) between adjacent cells in a bipolar'battery,<br>
2)	provide a gas channel between adjacent cells to create a<br>
common gas space within a bipolar battery,<br>
3)	provide an outer pressure tight seal for the cells in a<br>
bipolar battery, and<br><br><br>
4. provide an electronically insulating support structure<br>
between biplates and between the biplates and the endplates.<br>
Figure 2a shows a cross-sectional view of the gasket in figure<br>
1 along A-A, and figure 2b sows a cross-sectional view of the<br>
gasket in figure 1 along B-B. The presence of a second gasket<br>
10' is indicated in the figures to further show how the rirn 11<br>
is intended to be received in the indentation when mounted in<br>
a battery.<br>
A biplate 15 is shown with a dashed line in figures 1, 2a and<br>
2b to indicate the position of a biplate 15 in an assembled<br>
bipolar battery. It should be noted that the biplate must not<br>
occlude the opening of the through-hole 13 to provide the<br>
common gas space, but a portion of the groove 14 must be<br>
covered by a biplate 15 to prevent electrolyte leakage between<br>
cells. A biplate with a hole aligned with the hole in the<br>
gasket may alternatively be employed to serve the purposes<br>
listed here.<br>
Figure 3 shows a partial view of a second embodiment of a<br>
gasket 2 0 according to the invention. The gasket 20 is<br>
provided with a rim 11 and a corresponding indentation 12 r as<br>
described above. The gasket is provided with two rather small<br>
through-holes 21, each having a groove 22 to connect the<br>
through-hole 21 to the space inside the gasket as previously<br>
described in connection with figure 1. A biplate 15 is also<br>
shown with a dashed line to indicate the position of a biolate<br>
15 in an assembled bipolar battery. To prevent the biplate to<br>
be misaligned during assembling of the battery, a guidance<br>
means 23, such as a boss, is provided on the gasket 20. It<br>
should be noted that it is advantageous that the boss is<br>
designed in such a way that a passageway may be established<br>
between the two through-holes beside the biplate of each cell.<br><br><br>
In this embodiment the boss does not stretch all the way from<br>
the biplate to the rim.<br>
Figure 4a is a cross-sectional view along A-A in figure 3, and<br>
figure 4b is a cross-sectional view along B-B in figure 3. The<br>
presence of a second gasket 20' is indicated in the figuxes to<br>
further show how the rim 11 is intended to be received in the<br>
indentation 12 when mounted in a battery.<br>
Figure 5 shows a partial view of a third embodiment of a<br>
gasket 3 0 according to the invention. The gasket 3 0 is<br>
provided with a rim 11 and a corresponding indentation 12, as<br>
described above. The gasket is provided with five rather small<br>
through-holes 31, each having a groove 32 to connect the<br>
through-hole 31 to the space inside the gasket as previously-<br>
described in connection with figure 1. A biplate 15 is also<br>
shown with a dashed line to indicate the position of a bdplate<br>
15 in an assembled bipolar battery. To prevent the biplate to<br>
be misaligned during assembling of the battery, several<br>
guidance means 33, such as bosses, are provided on the gasket<br>
30. It should be noted that it is advantageous that the bosses<br>
are designed in such a way that a passageway may be<br>
established between the five through-holes beside the biplate<br>
of each cell. In this embodiment the bosses are lower than the<br>
thickness of the biplate.<br>
Figure 6a is a cross-sectional view along A-A in figure 5, and<br>
figure 6b is a cross-sectional view along B-B in figure 5. The<br>
presence of a second gasket 30' is indicated in the figaxes to<br>
further show how the rim 11 is intended to be received in the<br>
indentation 12 when mounted in a battery.<br>
It may be advantageous, but necessarily required, to alter the<br>
design of the gasket in contact with the endplates to better<br><br><br>
nest and seal with the endplates. The endplates may have a<br>
different size than the biplates, so the gasket may need to<br>
conform to the different size.<br>
Figure 7 shows a bipolar battery 40 in cross section having<br>
five cells- The battery comprises a negative end plate 41 and<br>
a positive end plate 42, each having a negative electrode 43<br>
and a positive electrode 44, respectively. Four biplate<br>
assemblies, comprising a negative electrode 43 a biplate 15,<br>
and a positive electrode 44, are stacked on top of each other<br>
in a sandwich structure between the two end terminals. A<br>
separator 45 is arranged between each adjacent negative and.<br>
positive electrodes making up a cell, the separator 45<br>
contains an electrolyte and a predetermined percentage of gas<br>
passages, about 5 % is a typical value for gas passages in<br>
starved electrolyte batteries.<br>
A gasket 10, as described in connection with figure 1, is<br>
provided between adjacent biplates and/or a biplate and an end<br>
plate. As indicated in the figure by the arrow 46, gas may<br>
flow from one cell to another and thereby all cells share a.<br>
common gas space through the gas passages in the gasket. If an<br>
electrode in a cell starts to gas before the others, this<br>
pressure will be distributed through-out the whole common gas<br>
space. The gas will pass from a cell, through a groove 14 and<br>
via a through-hole 13 of a first gasket to a groove 14 of a.<br>
second gasket, and thereafter into a second cell.<br>
If the pressure within the common space exceeds a predeter-<br>
mined value, a pressure relief valve 4 7 will open to connect<br>
the common gas space with the ambient environment. The<br>
pressure relief valve 4 7 is arranged through one of the end<br>
plates, in this example the negative end plate 41 and<br>
comprises a feed-through 48. In an alternative embodiment, the<br><br><br>
feed-through 48 may be integrally formed onto the endplate 41.<br>
A preferred embodiment of a pressure relief valve and feed-<br>
through is described in connection with figures 14, 15a-b and<br>
16.<br>
Additionally, a pressure sensor (not shown) may also be<br>
mounted through one of the end plates to measure the actual<br>
pressure inside the battery cells. The case 49 is preferably<br>
made from an insulating material, but may naturally be made<br>
from a conductive material. Each frame is preferably made from<br>
an insulating material and is designed in such a way to ensure<br>
electrical insulation between each biplate 15 and a possibly<br>
conductive case. The gasket 10 is provided with a recess 50<br>
where the biplates and the positive end terminal 42 are" placed<br>
during manufacture and are maintained during operation by<br>
applying a pressure as indicated by the arrows 51. The recess<br>
50 is the space between two gaskets that will be established,<br>
when the indentation 12■and the rim 11 of the gasket are. in<br>
communication.<br>
The pressure is maintained by fixating a lid 52 to the case 49<br>
by some kind of fastening means 53, such as screws, and will<br>
ensure that each cell has a predetermined width, which is<br>
approximately equal to the compressed height of the gasket 10.<br>
Alternatively, the lid 52 may be fixed in position by any of<br>
several other standard means, including crimping, interference<br>
fits, epoxy, heat seal or solvent, depending of the battery<br>
case construction and battery application criteria.<br>
It should be noted that there may be a space between the<br>
outside of the gasket 10 and the inside surface of the case<br>
49, since the gasket itself provide the pressure ticrht seal<br>
3 for the battery. The case 49 with the lid 52 provide a<br><br>
15<br>
practical solution for creating the required pressure to<br>
establish the pressure tight seal between the gaskets and the<br>
biplates and the positive and negative endplates.<br>
Relief valves and pressure sensors axe readily available to a<br>
man skilled in the arts and are not described in more detail.<br>
Each end plate is provided with a terminal connection. The<br>
terminal connection comprises a terminal feed-through 54,-<br>
which preferably is secured to the case 49 by press-fitting.<br>
Each terminal feed-through 54 is attached to each endplate 41<br>
and 42, respectively, by soldering, gluing, welding etc. to<br>
establish a good electrical contact. The terminal feed-through<br>
is in this embodiment provided with internal threads. Screws<br>
55 may be used to attach any type of terminal connectors to<br>
the battery.<br>
It should be noted that although figure 7 shows a bipolar<br>
battery having a negative endplate 41 arranged in the lower<br>
portion of the battery, this feature is not essential for the<br>
construction of the battery. The negative and the positive<br>
terminal positions of the battery are interchangeable by<br>
trading the positions of all the negative and positive<br>
electrodes in the battery. The function of the battery will<br>
still be the same.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a perspective view of a battery 4 0 according to<br>
the invention provided with adjustable terminal connectors 60 .<br>
A terminal connector 60 is attached to each endplate of the<br>
battery via the terminal feed-through 54, using a screw 55.<br>
Each terminal connector may be directed either to the short<br>
side of the battery or the long side of the battery. The<br>
terminal connector marked with a "P" (positive terminal) is<br>
directed to the short side of the battery and the terminal<br><br><br>
connector is bent in such a way that the far end 61 of the<br>
terminal connector 60 may be inserted into a groove 62<br>
arranged in the case 49 of the battery when the terminal<br>
connector is secured to the terminal feed-through 54 by the<br>
screw 55. The terminal connector is thus secured to the case.<br>
The second terminal connector marked "N" (negative terminal)<br>
is in this figure directed toward the long side of the battery<br>
and likewise secured to the case 49. Each terminal "connector<br>
may be rotated to a different position, as indicated by the<br>
arrow 63.<br>
Furthermore, there is a possibility to embed the terminal<br>
connectors into the case by providing a depression in the<br>
case, as indicating by the dashed lines 64, to allow close<br>
stacking of batteries without the risk of shorting the<br>
terminal connectors. The terminal connectors could also be<br>
provided with some type of insulating material, e.g. red for<br>
the positive terminal connector and black for the negative<br>
terminal connector. The positions of the grooves 62 on each<br>
side of the case are preferably offset, to facilitate the. use<br>
of bus bar connections.<br>
Figures 9a to 9c show three different devices for vacuum<br>
filling a bipolar battery. Normally, a-NiMH-battery is filled<br>
during the assembling of the battery, and this may naturally<br>
also be performed with this type of battery, but it is<br>
possible to use vacuum filling techniques to introduce<br>
electrolyte into the finished battery.<br>
Figure 9a shows a first filling device 70, where a bipolar<br>
battery 40 is placed inside a vacuum chamber 71 together with<br>
a beaker 72 of electrolyte (e.g. 6M KOH). A tube 73,<br>
preferably flexible, is attached to the feed-through 4 8 of the<br><br><br>
pressure relief valve 47. A vacuum pipe 74 is connected to the<br>
vacuum chamber 71 and thereafter divided into two branches,<br>
where a first branch is provided with a first valve VI in<br>
series with a vacuum pump P, and the second branch is provided<br>
with a second valve V2.<br>
The procedure of vacuum filling a battery comprises the<br>
following steps:<br>
1)	Open valve VI and let the pump P evacuate the air inside<br>
the vacuum chamber 71. The air inside the battery 40 will also<br>
be evacuated through the tube 73, which can be seen as bubbles<br>
in the electrolyte.<br>
2)	Close valve VI when a desired vacuum pressure has been<br>
obtained inside the vacuum chamber 71.<br>
3)	Open valve V2 to increase the pressure inside the vacuum<br>
chamber 71 by letting ambient air flow into the chamber. The<br>
increased pressure inside the chamber will push electrolyte<br>
into the battery 40 and slowly fill the separators and voids<br>
inside the battery with electrolyte- The electrolyte is sucked<br>
into the battery using capillary force.<br>
Figure 9b shows a second filling device 80 where a bipolar<br>
battery 40 also is placed inside a vacuum chamber 71 together<br>
with a beaker 72 of electrolyte (e.g. 6M KOH) . A tube 73,<br>
preferably flexible, is attached to the feed-through 48 of the<br>
pressure relief valve 47. A second opening 81 into the common<br>
gas space is provided in the case of the battery. The opening<br>
could be used for arranging a pressure sensor after the<br>
electrolyte has been introduced into the battery. A vacuum<br>
pipe 74 is connected to the vacuum chamber 71 and a valve VI<br>
is provided in series with a vacuum pump P.<br><br><br>
Air will be evacuated from the battery 40 through the opening<br>
81 when the valve VI is open and the vacuum pump P is<br>
decreasing the pressure inside the vacuum chamber 71. When the<br>
air is evacuated from the battery, electrolyte will be<br>
introduced from the beaker 72, through the tube 73 and in<br>
through the feed-through 48 of the pressure relief valve 47.<br>
The valve VI is closed when enough electrolyte has been<br>
introduced into the battery. The vacuum chamber 71 is vented<br>
and the battery, now filled with electrolyte, can be removed.<br>
Figure 9c shows a third filling device 9 0 that does not<br>
contain a vacuum chamber. The feed-through 4 8 of the pressure<br>
release valve 47 of several batteries 40 may be connected to a<br>
common manifold 91. The manifold 91 is connected to a first<br>
valve VI, which is in series with a vacuum pump P. A tube 92<br>
(or pipe) is immersed in a container 93 filled with<br>
electrolyte. The tube 92 is connected to the manifold via a<br>
second valve V2. The device operates in the following way. The<br>
pump will evacuate the air inside all the batteries 40 when<br>
the valve VI is opened. The valve VI is closed when a<br>
sufficient low pressure has been obtained. The valve V2 is<br>
thereafter opened and electrolyte will be distributed to all<br>
batteries 40 through the manifold. The electrolyte is<br>
distributed inside each battery using capillary forces.<br>
The manufacturing process for making a bipolar battery is<br>
■described in connection with figures 10, 11, 12 and 13.<br>
The first flow chart shown in figure 10 describes the process<br>
of manufacturing a bipolar battery, as described in connection<br>
with figure 7, up to a battery without any electrolyte, i.e. a<br>
dry battery. The flow starts in step 101 and continues to ster&gt;<br>
102 and 103 in parallel. In step 102 a feed-through 48 for the<br>
pressure relief valve 47 is assembled to the first endplate<br><br><br>
41, and in step 103 a terminal feed-through 54 is assembled to<br>
the non-conducting case 49.<br>
The first endplate 41 assembled with the pressure relief valve<br>
feed-through 48 is mounted in the case 49 being provided with<br>
the terminal feed-through 54 in step 104. The terminal feed-<br>
through 54 is thereafter attached to the first endplate 41 in<br>
step 105, using any of the methods described above.<br>
The desired number of battery cells M is thereafter selected<br>
in step 106 and a counter is set to zero, k=0. In step 107,<br>
the counter is increased by 1, k=k+l and the flow continues to<br>
step 108, where cell number wk" is assembled, that is a gasket<br>
10; 20; 30, as previously described in connection to figures 1<br>
to 6, is mounted inside the case 49 around the edge of the end<br>
plate 41, a first electrode 43 is positioned within the gasket<br>
on top of the first endplate 41, one or more separators 45 are<br>
thereafter arranged on top of the first electrode 43 and a<br>
second electrode 44 is arranged on top of the separator (s)<br>
within the gasket. The gasket may alternatively be mounted<br>
after the electrodes and the separator (s) have been mounted<br>
inside the case 49.<br>
The flow continues to step 109, where a decision is made<br>
whether the selected number of cells M has been manufactured.<br>
If the answer is "No", the flow is fed back to point 111 via<br>
step 110 where a biplate is mounted on top of the gasket. The<br>
flow repeats step 108 and 109 until the selected number of<br>
cells has been made.<br>
When k=M, the flow continues to step 112 where the lid 52 of<br>
the case 49 is provided with a terminal feed-through 54 and a<br>
second endplate 42 is assembled to the lid 52. The terminal<br><br><br>
feed-through 54 is thereafter attached to the second endplate<br>
42 in step 113, using any of the methods described above.<br>
The lid 52 is mounted to the case 49 in step 114 a pressure is<br>
applied in step 115 to the lid 52 in a direction 51 previously<br>
described in connection with figure 7. A dry bipolar battery<br>
is thereby finished in step 116.<br>
The process of stacking battery components on top of each<br>
other to form the right number of battery cells may naturally<br>
be performed in a number of different ways. For instance,<br>
biplate assemblies may be provided, each comprising a first<br>
electrode attached to a first side of a biplate and a second<br>
electrode attached to a second side of the biplate, the first<br>
side being opposite to the second side, where the separator<br>
material is added in the fed back loop instead of the biplate<br>
as disclosed in figure 10. It is also possible that the<br>
material of each cell is pre-manufactured and each cell is<br>
stacked during the assembling process of the battery.<br>
Figure 11 is a flow chart describing the process of producing<br>
a functional battery from the dry battery obtained in step<br>
116, figure 10. The flow starts in step 116 and continues to<br>
step 117 where the battery is filled with electrolyte. The<br>
filling process is described in more detail in connection with<br>
figure 12.<br>
A formation procedure is thereafter performed in step 118 to<br>
initialize the battery to normal operation. This formation<br>
procedure is described in more detail in connection with<br>
figure 13.<br>
When the formation is completed, the lid 52 is fastened to the<br>
case 49 in step 119 and the pressure applied to the lid<br>
previously is released. It is of course possible to first<br><br><br>
release the pressure and thereafter recompress the lid to the<br>
case, fasten the lid 52 to the case 49 and thereafter release<br>
the pressure. Alternatively, fasten the lid between steps 115<br>
and 115 in the dry battery assembly procedure.<br>
The assembling of the pressure release valve is finalized in<br>
step 12 0, and the finished battery is optionally cycled in<br>
step 121 before the battery is ready for shipment, step 122.<br>
It should however be noted that it is possible to fill the<br>
battery with electrolyte during the assembling of each cell in<br>
step 108, but from a manufacturing point of view, the filling<br>
process as is disclosed in figure 12 is much more simple to<br>
implement.<br>
The process for filling of the battery in step 117, comprises<br>
attachment of an electrolyte reservoir 72; 93 to an inlet 48<br>
of a battery 40, e.g. the feed-through 4 8 of the pressure<br>
relief valve 47, see step 13 0.<br>
The air in the battery is thereafter evacuated from the<br>
battery in step 131, either directly or indirectly by placing<br>
the battery in a vacuum chamber 71 that is evacuated. A<br>
separate outlet' 81 for the air is possible, but the inlet 48<br>
for the electrolyte may be used as an air outlet during the<br>
evacuation procedure.<br>
Electrolyte is introduced into the battery 40 in step 132<br>
after the air has been evacuated .from the battery or during<br>
the evacuation dependent on the equipment configuration used,<br>
sees figures 9a to 9c. The electrolyte is distributed inside<br>
to the separators 45 inside the battery 40 using capillary<br>
forces.<br>
A battery filled with electrolyte is obtained in step 133.<br><br><br>
The formation process of the battery in step 118 comprises two<br>
stages, where the first stage is charging and discharging<br>
cycles of the battery under "wet" conditions. The wet<br>
condition is provided in step 140 with attachment of a liquid<br>
supply to the inlet 48 of the battery. The liquid could either<br>
be water or electrolyte.<br>
At least two charge/discharge cycles *n" are thereafter<br>
performed in step 141.<br>
Stage two is performed under more or less "dry" conditions by<br>
removing the liquid supply from the inlet 48 in step 142, and<br>
thereafter performing a predetermined number of<br>
charge/discharge cycles to dry out the battery 40 from excess<br>
electrolyte in step 143.<br>
A starved battery is thus produced.<br>
It is however possible to fasten the lid before filling the<br>
battery. The formation may occur with an optional second fill<br>
between formation cycles, and it is not necessary to<br>
continuously supply liquid to the battery during electrical<br>
cycling.<br>
When filling the battery with electrolyte, the electrolyte<br>
will transfer to the separator, the porous electrodes and to<br>
some extent into the surrounding volume out to the gasket,<br>
thus each battery cell is filled with electrolyte.<br>
Figure 14 shows a partial cross-sectional view of a bipolar<br>
battery 149 similar to the battery described in connection<br>
with figure 7. Parts of the battery assembly that are the same<br>
as parts described in connection with figure 7 have the same<br>
reference numerals. Only a part of the battery cell closest to<br>
the end plate 41 is shown and the end gasket 15 0 arranaed<br><br><br>
between the endplate 41 and the biplate 15 is designed in a<br>
similar way to the gaskets described earlier in the<br>
description with the exception that a flexible feed through<br>
151,	which is a part of the pressure relief valve 15S, is an<br>
integral part of the end gasket 150.<br>
The endplate 41 is provided with an opening 152 that<br>
preferably is smaller than the outer dimensions of the<br>
flexible feed through 151, thus providing a seal between the<br>
endplate 41 and the base of the flexible feed through 151 when<br>
the flexible feed through 151 is introduced into the opening<br>
152.	The case 49 is provided with an opening 153 that is<br>
larger than the outer dimensions of the flexible feed through<br>
151, which is required to preserve the appropriate function of<br>
the assembled pressure relief valve 156.<br>
A channel 154 that connects the common gas space within the<br>
bipolar battery to the ambient environment is present inside<br>
the flexible feed through and when a pin 155, having a cross-<br>
sectional dimension that is larger than the cross-sectional<br>
dimension of the channel 154, is introduced into the channel,<br>
the common gas space is sealed from the ambient environment. A<br>
retainer, such as a star washer 157, is preferably used to<br>
secure the pin 155 in the channel 154.<br>
The ratio between the cross-sectional dimensions of the pin<br>
155 and the channel 154 is selected to create a pressure<br>
relief valve that will open at a specific pressure. The<br>
pressure relief valve opens when the pressure within the<br>
common gas space is above a selected threshold by forcing the<br>
walls of the flexible feed through 151 to deflect into the<br>
available space between the flexible feed through and the<br>
opening 153 in the case 49. A gap is thus introduced between<br>
the inside of the channel 154 and the pin 155. It is possible<br><br><br>
to create a pressure relief valve that operates in a pressure<br>
range from less than 5 psi to more than 100 psi by selecting<br>
the appropriate dimensions of the channel and the pin to<br>
result the desired pressure at which the valve will open.<br>
Figures 15a and 15b show a partial cross-sectional view of a<br>
second embodiment of a pressure relief valve 160., where figure<br>
15a is an exploded view and figure 15b is an assembled view of<br>
the same pressure relief valve 160.<br>
An endplate 41 is provided with an opening, preferably<br>
circular, into which a flexible feed through 151, that may be<br>
an integral part of a gasket 167, is introduced. A sealing<br>
161, such as an 0-ring, is arranged around the' flexible feed<br>
through to provide an improved sealing between the case 49 and<br>
the endplate 41, and between the endplate 41 and the interior<br>
of the bipolar battery to prevent undesired electrolyte to<br>
creep into the region between the case and endplate in the<br>
even that the pressure relief valve opens. A recess 162 is<br>
provided in the case 49 around an opening 163 in the case 49<br>
to hold the sealing 161, and the opening 163 is larger than<br>
the outside of the flexible feed through 151 as described<br>
above. A pin 164, provided with at least two flexible<br>
extensions 165, is designed to-be introduced into the channel<br>
154 of the flexible feed through 151, and the flexible<br>
extensions 165 are designed to hold the pin 164 in place when<br>
mounted, as shown in figure 15b, against a retainer in the<br>
shape of a rim 166.<br>
Arrows 168 illustrates how the flexible feed through is<br>
deflected when the pressure within the bipolar battery is too<br>
high and the pressure relief valve 160 opens.<br><br><br>
Fig. 15 shows a third embodiment of an assembled pressure<br>
relief valve 170. The case 49 is provided with a similarly<br>
shaped opening as shown in figures 15a and 15b, with a sealing<br>
161 arranged in a recess 162. The endplate 41 is in this<br>
example provided with an opening with drawn edges- 171. The<br>
opening may be produced by first punching an opening through<br>
the endplate and thereafter drawing the edges to create the<br>
desired three-dimensional shape of the opening. The shape of<br>
the flexible feed through 172 is adapted to follow the shape<br>
of the drawn opening in the endplate 41 which will provide<br>
good sealing properties between the interior of the battery<br>
and the case 49. The channel 154 inside the flexible feed<br>
through 172 is adapted to hold the pin 164 and the extensions<br>
165 are adapted to hold the pin in place during operation<br>
against the rim 166.<br>
The pressure relief valve may be an integrated part of the end<br>
gasket provided within a bipolar battery, but it may also be<br>
implemented as a separate pressure relief valve in any type of<br>
battery.<br>
The type of material selected to be used to produce the<br>
flexible feed through of the pressure relief valve together<br>
with the ratio between the inner cross-sectional dimension of<br>
the channel and the cross-sectional dimension of the pin will<br>
affect the pressure threshold of the assembled pressure relief<br>
valve.<br>
Although the specification only discloses a NiMH bipolar<br>
battery, it should be noted that the same technology may be<br>
applied when producing any type of Nickel based bipolar<br>
battery, such as Nickel Cadmium (NiCd) bipolar batteries, or<br>
Nickel Zinc (NiZn) bipolar batteries.<br><br><br>
The gasket defined in the appended claims should not be<br>
limited to be used in NiMH bipolar batteries, but should<br>
include any type of bipolar battery having a starved<br>
electrolyte configuration.<br><br><br>

to be water and/or electrolyte.<br>
34.	The method as claimed in any of claims 30 to 33, wherein the<br>
step of filling of the separators with electrolyte comprises:<br>
attaching an electrolyte reservoir to the passage to the common<br>
gas space,<br>
evacuating air from the common gas space,<br>
filling electrolyte into the common gas space, and<br>
transferring electrolyte to each cell from the common gas space.<br>
35.	The method as claimed in claim 34, wherein the air is evacuated<br>
from the common gas space through the passage before the electrolyte is<br>
filled into the common gas space.<br>
36.	The method as claimed in claim 34, wherein the air in the<br>
common gas space is evacuated using an opening being separate from<br><br>
the passage, whereby the electrolyte is introduced into the common gas<br>
space during evacuation.<br>
37.	The battery as claimed in any of claims 13 to 29, wherein the<br>
battery is provided with a positive and negative terminal connector being<br>
in contact with the positive and negative endplates, respectively.<br>
38.	The battery as claimed in claim 37, wherein said terminal<br>
connectors being adjustably arranged to the case.<br>
39.	The battery as claimed in claim 38, wherein a first end of each<br>
terminal connector is arranged to be attached to each endplate, and a<br>
second end, distal from the first end, is arranged to be fasten to the case<br>
of the battery.<br>
40.	The battery as claimed in claim 39, wherein each terminal<br>
connector is attached to the respective endplate via a feed-through,<br>
which is secured in the case.<br>
41.	The battery as claimed in claim 39, wherein the second end of<br>
each terminal connector is bent, and is fastened to the case by inserting<br>
the bent portion into one out of one or more grooves arranged in the<br>
case.<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a use of gaskets 10; 20; 30; 150<br>
in a starved electrolyte bipolar battery 40; 149 having at least two<br>
electrochemical cells, a biplate 15 arranged between each cell, and the<br>
gaskets are arranged adjacent to the biplate. Each gasket is made from<br>
a hydrophobic material to prevent the creation of an electrolyte path<br>
between adjacent cells in the battery. Each gasket is frame shaped and<br>
designed to at least partially encompass each biplate 15 in the bipolar<br>
battery, and also provided with means 13, 14; 21, 22; 31, 32 to permit<br>
gas passage through each gasket. Said hydrophobic material has<br>
deformable properties to provide a sealing to each biplate 15, whereby<br>
an outer pressure tight seal of the battery is obtained. The present<br>
invention also relates to a starved electrolyte bipolar battery and a<br>
method for manufacturing a starved electrolyte bipolar battery.<br></td>
