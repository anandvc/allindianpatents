				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention pertains to a method of continuous manufacture of<br>
sponge iron and a ported rotary kiln therefor. The production of sponge iron is<br>
effected by removing oxygen from heated iron oxide by using non-coking coal as<br>
the reductant. The reduction is achieved in the solid state without resorting to<br>
melting of the iron oxide. The improvement particularly lies in the reduction of<br>
accretion and fouling of air pipelines and ports in a ported rotary kiln used for<br>
sponge iron manufacture and the improved kiln for carrying out the method.<br>
The prior art developments in the rotary ported kiln was directed at control<br>
of accretion in view of (a) progressive depletion of reductant carbon in the kiln,<br>
and (b) management of hot spots in the areas surrounding air admission points<br>
i.e. ports.<br>
While the problem management was optimised and hardware designed<br>
on the basis of a particular non-coking coal quality, the gradual deterioration in<br>
the available coal quality over the years has put the old hardware configuration<br>
out of date. The main factors which are now affecting the operation are low fixed<br>
carbon, higher volatile matter, higher ash content, and increase in the high<br>
boiling fraction of volatile matter, which are causing fouling of air pipelines by<br>
putting a coating of bitumen binded fines on the grids of ports. The volatile<br>
matters formed in the preheating zone passes into the air pipelines getting<br>
deposited inside the throats together with ore fines resulting in choking. This<br>
problem is mostly concentrated in the preheating zone of the kiln where<br>
maximum volatile matters including high boiling volatile matter, such as tar, are<br>
released from the non-coking coal in the temperature range 600°C-800°C,<br>
whereas the temperature at which reduction of iron takes place is in the range<br>
of 1000°C-1050°C.<br>
The choking of air pipelines and grids of the air ports result in supply of<br>
inadequate air into the kiln which slows down the rise of temperature, even<br>
resulting in inadequate reduction. It also upsets the distribution pattern of air<br>
over the length of the kiln. All these affect the plant capacity, product quality,<br>
control over accretion and campaign life.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to overcome the disadvantages of<br>
accretion and fouling of air pipelines and air ports as stated above.<br>
In order to prevent choking of air pipelines, according to the invention,<br>
axial air tubes have been provided to substitute air ports in the preheat zone of<br>
the kiln where release of volatile matters takes place under lower temperature<br>
conditions. One or more axial tubes are put in the first 1/3 rd. length of the<br>
kiln, depending on the capacity and size of the kiln.<br>
Besides high volatile coal, the modification, according to the present<br>
invention, will be able to handle higher percentage of fines in raw material from<br>
the feed end of the kiln.<br>
The impurities and ingredients of coal used in bringing about the<br>
reduction of iron ore or ore fines may vary widely, as shown below :<br>
FC .......... 35%-42%<br>
VM .......... 26%-36%<br>
Ash .......... 23%-28%<br>
Ash softening point - 1200°C - 1400°C (IDT )<br>
Reactivity 1.6-2.0<br>
The raw materials used as feedstock may have the following dimensions :<br>
Feed end iron ore 5.20 mm .......... 6 mm 
Discharge end iron ore<br>
(Upto 11% of total feed) 3.6 mm .......... 3 mm 
Feed end coal 3.25 mm .......... 3 mm 
.......... 5mm
Discharge end coal 3.6 mm .......... 3 mm 
(In two/three fractions) 6.15 mm<br>
15.25 mm<br>
The ultimate motto is the maintenance of uniform and adequate<br>
temperature environment in the reduction zone of the kiln. Since ports are<br>
replaced by axial air tubes only in the preheat zone it will not affect uniformity<br>
of temperature in the reduction, thus there is no adverse effect on reaction in<br>
the reduction zone.<br>
The requirement of slinger coal in the preheat zone is not necessary as<br>
the feed end coal provides fresh carbon requirement in this zone and, therefore,<br>
obstruction provided by axial air tubes in the reactor is for least consequence.<br>
The invention is discussed and described hereinbelow with reference to<br>
the accompanying drawings wherein :<br>
Figure-1 shows the partly sectional schematic view of the prior art ported<br>
rotary kiln ;<br>
Figure-2 shows a sectional sketch of prior art ported configuration indication<br>
zones of high volatile release in the preheat zones of the kiln ;<br>
Figure-3 shows in schematic view of the replacement of air ports in the preheat<br>
zones by axial air tubes according to the invention.<br>
Referring to Figure-1, where a ported rotary kiln of prior art is shown with<br>
a large number of ports 2 distributed over the length and periphery of the kiln<br>
covering most of its reactive length. Sized iron ore, fines and coal as reductant<br>
are fed into the kiln continuously from the the feed end. In the figure, 2 indicates<br>
the ports, 3 indicates after burner 4 indicates stack, 5 indicates the reactive<br>
zone of the kiln, 6 indicates preheating zone, 7 indicates feed end and 8 indicates<br>
the discharge end of the kiln.<br>
Referring Figure-2, and as shown in the Figure the reactor is divided into<br>
12 zones, namely Zone 1 to Zone 12 with Zone 1 starting from the discharge end<br>
and Zone 12 ending at the feed end. Ports 2 provide air to the radial air ports in<br>
each Zone from Zone 1 to Zone 10. Thus air supplied to the reactor provides<br>
necessary oxygen for combustion and generation of reducing gas. Release of<br>
volatile matters is maximum in the zones 8 and 9 while in the other it is less.<br>
The high boiling fraction of the volatile matters such as tar released in the<br>
temperature range of 600°C-800°C in the liquid state from the non-coking coal<br>
gets inside the air pipelines and ports and chokes them. The effect of choking<br>
results in supply of inadequate into the kiln which slows down the rise of<br>
temperature in the reduction zone and even results in inadequate reducing/<br>
operating temperature which is normally in the range of 1000°C-1050°C.<br>
Referring to and as shown in Figure-3, according to the invention, axial<br>
air tubes 13 substitute air ports in the preheat zone of the kiln where release of<br>
volatile matters take place under lower temperature condition. One or more<br>
axial tubes are put in the first 1/3 rd. length of the kiln depending on capacity<br>
and size of the kiln. Since ports are replaced by the axial air tubes only in the<br>
prheat zones, it will not affect in the uniformity of temperature in the reduction<br>
zones when maintenance of uniform temperature in the said zones is the ultimate<br>
motto of a ported rotary kiln.<br>
This modified kiln will reduce accretion and fouling of air pipelines and ports to<br>
a great extent.<br>
Besides high volatile coal, this modified fila is capable of handling higher<br>
percentage of ore fines in the raw material charge fed from the feed end.<br>
In this modified kiln the requirement of slinger coal in the preheat zones<br>
is not necessary as the feed end coal provides fresh carbon requirement in this<br>
area, therefore, obstruction provided by axial air tubes in the reactor is least<br>
consequence.<br>
