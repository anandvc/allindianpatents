				<td>TRACTOR BACKGROUND OF THE.   INVENTION 1.   Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a tractor comprising an operation panel and an instrument panel provided below a steering wheel. 2 ■   Description of the Related Art<br>
The tractor disclosed in, e.g., Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 2003-2239 (see paragraphs [0014], [0015], FIGS. 1 and 3) is a conventional example of the tractor described above. This tractor comprises a control handle (equivalent to a steering wheel), a first cover (equivalent to an operation panel), and an instrument part (equivalent to an instrument panel).<br>
With this type of tractor, sometimes the operation panel is removed and inspections and repairs are performed on the various apparatuses and devices located on the inside of the operation panel.  If 'the instrument panel is supported on the operation panel in this case, cords and cables are linked to the operation panel via the instrument panel, and troublesome labor is therefore required for removing the instrument panel from the operation panel or for disconnecting the cords and cables so that the operation panel can be removed.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a tractor in which the operation panel can be removed in a simple operation, and in which the structure can be achieved in a simple manner.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INThe tractor according to the present invention comprises a vehicle body frame, a support frame that is erected on the vehicle body frame and that supports a hood, a steering wheel, a steering column that is erected on the vehicle body frame and that supports the steering wheel, an instrument panel, an operation panel that is provided below the steering wheel and that has a display window at a<br><br>
position facing the instrment panel, and a connecting member connected at one end to the support frame and connected at the other end to the steering column; wherein the instrument panel is mounted on the connecting member.<br>
According to this configuration, the instrument panel can be supported on instrument panel support parts of the connecting member and can be left on the vehicle body, and the operation panel can be removed from the support frame independently of the instrument panel.<br>
The support frame and the steering column can be reinforced by the connection with the connecting member, and the connecting member can be used as support means to support the instrument panel so as to keep the instrument panel on the vehicle body.<br>
 Therefore, the operation panel- can be removed by a simple operation and inspections and repairs can be performed efficiently without the need for labor for separating the instrument panel and the operation panel, or labor for disconnecting cords or cables for the instrument panel. Moreover, it is possible to obtain at low cost a simple structure that uses a connecting meniber for reinforcing the support frame and the steering column as support means for supporting the instrument panel.<br>
In the configuration described above, it is preferable that the connecting member be provided with a panel support part for fastening and connecting the part of the operation panel in the vicinity of the display window.<br>
According to this configuration, the part of the operation panel in the vicinity of the display window can be pressed against the instrument panel to satisfactorily create a seal between the operation panel and the instrum.ent panel, by fastening the part of the operation panel in the vicinity of the display window to the panel support part.<br>
Therefore, the instrument panel is supported on the connecting member so as to allow the operation panel to be removed independently, and a seal can be satisfactorlly<br><br>
created between the operation panel and the instrument pane to prevent warer infiltration or the like.<br>
In the configuration described above, it is preferable that the display surface of the instrument panel have a curved surface in which the center in the vertical directic of the instrument panel is concaved inward as seen from the side of the vehicle body.<br>
According to this configuration, the orientation or other characteristics of reflected light can be adjusted by the curvature of the display surface so that the notations are not obscured by the reflected light.  Therefore, the display is easily visible, and the display can be observed accurately.<br>
The tractor according to the present invention comprises 'a hood capable of swinging up and down between a raised open position and a lowered closed position, hood support bodies, pivoting pins provided to either one  of the hood or the hood support bodies, pivoting-pin holes provide to the other one of the hood or the hood support bodies, , support pins provided to the hood support pin holes that are provided to the hood support bodies and that have openings for engaging and releasing the support pins, and openings that are formed in the pivoting-pin holes and that engage and release the pivoting pins; wherein the support pins are engaged with the support pin holes in the raised open position, thereby preventing the pivoting pins from detaching from the pivoting-pin holes, and the engagement between the support pins and the support pin holes is released in the lowered closed position, thereby allowing the pivoting pins to detach from the pivoting-pin holes.<br>
According to this configuration, if the hood is lowere below the raised open position, the support pins detach frc the support pin holes, the hood support means switch to the operstion-released state, and the pivoting pins are detache from the pivoting-pin holes, thereby releasing the pivot support provided to the hood by the pivoting pins and the<br><br>
pivoting-pin holes, and allowing the hood to be removed. When the hood is brought to the raised open position, the support pins fit into the support pin holes, the hood support means switch to the operating state, and the hood is supported in the raised open position.<br>
Therefore, while the hood is pivotably supported to freely swing vertically open and closed, and also while the open hood can be stably supported by the hood support means during inspections and repairs, the pivoting pins can be taken out of and removed from the pivoting-pin holes merely by lowering the hood below the raised open position in order to remove the hood, and the hood can be removed in an easily operable manner without the need for a special operation for releasing the pivot locking.<br>
In the configuration described above, it is preferable that the tractor comprise guides that are provided to be continuous with the openings of the support pin holes and that guide the engaging and disengaging of the support pins. (PAGE 7)<br>
According to this configuration, the support pins can be smoothly engaged with and disengaged from the support pin holes.<br>
In the configuration described above, it is preferable that urging members be provided for urging the hood to swing to the raised open position.<br>
A.ccording to this configuration, when the hood is being opened, the swingable urging of the urging members can be used to gently open the hood.<br>
"When urging means are used in a configuration comprising the openings provided to the pivoting-pin holes, the upward urging of the hood by the urging means causes wobbling to readily occur in the pivot support provided to the hood by the pivoting pins and the pivoting-pin holes. However, the hood, having been brought to the raised open position, is stably supported by the hood support means, which has switched to the operating state, and wobbling<br><br>
caused by the urging means does not readily occur.<br>
Therefore, while the hood can be removed in an easily operable manner merely by separating the pivoting pins and the pivoting-pin holes, and also while the swingable urging of the urging means can be used to gently open the hood, the open hood can be stably supported by the hood support means.<br>

The pivoting-pin holes 121 of the pair of left and right hood pivot mechanisms 120, 120 are provided with openings 125 that open towards the rear of the hood at the rear end of the hood in the longitudinal direction, as shown in FIGS. 9 and 13. The pair of left and right hood pivot mechanisms 120, 120 are provided with hood support means 130 having support pins 131 provided to the connecting parts 111a of the hood 111.<br>
In addition to the comprising the support pins 131, the hood support means 130 of the hood pivot mechanisms 120 are configured comprising support pin holes 132 provided to the hood support bodies 122, and openings 133 provided to the support pin holes 132 so as to open upward and to the rear in relation to the vehicle body.<br>
FIG. 11 shows a side view of the structure of the operating state of the hood support means 130. When the hood 111 goes into the upward raised position, the support pins 131 are accordingly inserted into the support pin holes 132 through the openings 133, and the hood support means 130 switch to the operating state.  The hood support means 130 thereupon operate while supported by the hood support bodies 122 on the connecting parts 1lls via the support pins 131,<br><br>
and the pivoting pins 123 are thereby positioned at the ends on the opposite sides of the positions of the openings 125 of the pivoting-pin holes 121, whereby the hood ill is supported in the raised open position and is unable to detach from the pivoting-pin holes 121 of the pivoting pins 123, and the hood 111 is supported in the raised open position.<br>
FIG. 9 shows a side view of the structure of the operation-released state of the hood support means 130. When the hood 111 is operated to lower from the raised open position, the support pins 131 accordingly come out of the openings 133 of the support pin holes 132, as shown in the drawing.  The hood support means 130 thereupon switch to the operation-released state, enabling the hood 111 to swing downward.<br>
In other words, the hood 111 is operated to swing upward around the opening and closing axial center ? in order to open the engine compartment, as shown in FIG- 11. At this time, a gentle raising operation can be performed by the upward urging of the hood 111 by the pair of left and right gas springs 112, 112. When the support pins 131 are inserted into the support pin holes 132 along with the raising of the hood 111, the hood 111 reaches the raised open position and the engine compartment opens farther upward and forward than the lateral side plates 110. At this time, the hood support means 130 are switched to the operating state by the insertion of the support pins 131 into rhe support pin holes 132, and the hood 111 is supported by the hood support means 130 so that wobbling does not occur as a result of the oblong shape of the pivoting-pin holes 121, regardless of the upward urging by the gas springs 112.<br>
The hood 111 is operated to swing downward around the opening and closing axial center P in order to close the engine compartment, as shown in FIG. 9.  The support pins 131 thereupon detach from the support pin holes 132, the hood<br><br>
support means 130 switch to the operation-released state, and the hood 111 lowers. When the rear end of the hood 111 lies along the lateral side plates 110, the hood 111 reaches the lowered closed position and the engine compartment is closed. (PAGE 12)<br>
FIG. 12 is a side view of the hood pivot mechanisms 120 in the process of removing the hood. FIG. 13 is a side view of the hood pivot mechanisms 120 in a state of the hood having been removed. When the hood 111 is operated to swing down from the raised open position, the support pins 131 detach from the support pin holes 132, the hood support means 130 switches to the operation-released state, and the hood 111 is then pulled toward the front of the vehicle body, as shown in the drawings. The connecting parts 111a of the hood 111 thereupon move toward the front of the vehicle body in relation to the hood support bodies 122, the pivoting pins 123 of the pair of left and right hood pivot m.echanisms 120, 120 detach from the pivoting-pin holes 121, and the hood 111 separates from the pair of left and right hood support bodies 122, 122.<br>
The pivoting-pin holes 121 of the pair of left and right hood pivot mechanisms 120, 120 are configured as bent oblong holes that are bent between lead-in parts 121a, which have the openings 125, and internal parts 121b, which are positioned on the opposite side from the openings 125.  The hood support bodies 122 of the pair of left and right hood pivot mechanisms 120, 120 are provided with mounting guides 140 disposed farther upward in relation -to the vehicle body than the support pin holes 132.<br>
FIGS. 14A, 14B, and 14C are side views showing the area where the hood 111 is mounted. When the support pins 131 are slid downward into lead-in side parts 140a of the mounting guides 140, the guiding action of the lead-in side parts 140a causes the pivoting pins 123 to enter the lead-in parts 121a of the pivoting-pin holes 121 through the openings 125,<br><br>
as shown in the drawings. When the support pins 131 reach intermediate parts 140b of the mounting guides 140, the hood 111 is swung slightly downward around the axial center of the support pins 131, the pivoting pins 123 are thereby moved to the entrance of the internal parts 121b of the pivoting-pin holes 121, and the support pins 131 thereupon slide downward into terminal lateral parts 140c of the mounting guides 140.  The guiding action  of  the terminal lateral parts 140c thereupon causes the pivoting pins 123 to enter all the way into the internal parts 121b of the pivoting-pin holes 121, and the hood 111 can be supported on the pair of left and right hood support bodies 122.<br>
Instead of the gas springs 112 of the embodiment described above, upward-urging mechanisms may also be used that have a configuration that uses bendable links connected to the hood 111, and winding springs for urging the bendable links to extend.  Therefore, the gas springs 112, the upward-urging mechanisms, and the like are collectively referred to as urging means 112.<br>
Instead of the embodiments described above, a configuration may be used and carried out in which support pins are provided to hood support bodies and support pin holes are provided to the hood.  The objects of the present invention can be achieved in this case as well.<br><br><br><br>
