FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to a method and system to automatically invoke functionality of an operating system during the encrypted transmission and encrypted storage of computer files and/or computer programs from one computing device to another computing device.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The secure transmission of computer files via communication means has increased in importance with the proliferation of the Internet for electronic distribution and electronic commerce. The fundamental shift from physical delivery of computer files and/or computer programs to digital based electronic transmission has commenced with the Internet emerging as a ubiquitous low cost network. As in previous technological advancements such as the transition from newspaper to radio and then to television, media companies of the time were forced to react to the emergence of these new mediums. However, unlike previous technological transitions, the Internet as a medium supports all of the functionality of the traditional print, radio and television industries while simultaneously supporting electronic commerce as well. Currently, many businesses utilize the Internet to sell or give away their computer files and/or computer programs via the Internet and in most cases, the computer<br><br>
-2-<br>
files are not encrypted for protection against piracy or illegal use. Additionally, the current approach relating to the secure transmission and storage of computer files fails to leverage encryption functionality of a computing device's operating system. The current approach calls for a computing device acting as a server (the "Serving Device") to communicate with another computing device acting as a client (the "Client Device") to transfer encrypted files for decryption at the application level (such as, but not limited to, Win32 Application) of the Client Device. The Client Device utilizes a computer program running at the application level for decryption, which is assigned a unique decryption "key." During the transmission process, the Serving Device encrypts the computer file for storage using the decryption "key" of the Client Device. The encrypted computer file is then transmitted via the Internet and saved into storage within, or connected to, the Client Device. After decryption of the computer file, the decrypting computer program transmits a decrypted signal to the operating system for display or, in the case of an audio file, playback through the sound card. The decrypted signal can be vulnerable when transmitted from the decrypting application to the operating system, and the signal can be intercepted, possibly resulting in the illegal duplication of the computer file.<br>
Addressing certain aspects of computer file and computer program encryption, the Microsoft Corporation published in 1998, a white paper titled "Microsoft Windows NT version 5.0, Public Key Infrastructure", incorporated by reference herein, (hereinafter the<br><br>
-3-<br>
"Windows 2000 PKI White Paper"), detailing encryption functionality of a comprehensive public key infrastructure (PKI) in the Windows 2000 family of operating systems (formerly referred to as Windows NT 5.0). The Windows 2 000 PKI White Paper stated on the cover page thereof, "Microsoft. Windows NT. version 5.0 introduces a comprehensive public key infrastructure (PKI) to the Windows, platform.  This utilizes and extends the Windows-based public key<br>
(PK) cryptographic services introduced over the past few years, providing an integrated set of services and administrative tools for creating, deploying, and managing PK-based applications. This allows application developers to take advantage of the shared-secret security mechanisms or PK-based security mechanism in Windows NT as appropriate. At the same time, enterprises gain the advantage of being able to manage the environment and applications based on consistent tools and policy mechanisms."<br>
Furthermore, and with special emphasis on the encryption functionality of the Public Key Infrastructure of the Windows 2000 family of operating systems, the Windows PKI White Paper stated, "The Web has rapidly become a key element in creating and deploying solutions for the effective exchange of information on a worldwide basis. In particular, growth in its use for business purposes has been dramatic. For many uses, security is a key consideration. Notably: Server authentication - To enable clients to verify the server they are communicating with. Client authentication - To allow servers to verify the client's identity and use this as a basis for access control decisions.  Confidentiality - Encryption<br><br>
-4-<br>
of data between clients and servers to prevent its exposure over public Internet links.<br>
The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and the emerging IETF standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols play an important role in addressing these needs. SSL and TLS are flexible security protocols that can be layered on top of other transport protocols. They rely on PK-based authentication technology and use PK-based key negotiation to generate a unique encryption key for each client and/or server session. They are most commonly associated with Web-based applications and the HTTP protocol (referred to as HTTPS).<br>
SSL and TLS are supported on the Windows platform by the secure channel (schannel) SSPI provider. Microsoft Internet Explorer and Internet Information Services both use schannel for this functionality. Because schannel is integrated with Microsoft's SSPI architecture, it is available for use with multiple protocols to support authenticated and/or encrypted communications.<br>
Taking full advantage of the SSL and TLS protocols requires both clients and servers to have identification certificates issued by mutually trusted CAs, allowing the parties to authenticate each other. In this mode, certificates are exchanged along with data that proves possession of the corresponding private key. Each side can then validate the certificate and verify possession of the private key using the certificate's public key. The identifying information included in<br><br>
-5-<br>
the certificate can then be used to make supplemental access control decisions. For example, the client can decide whether the server is someone it wishes to conduct business with and the server can decide what data the client will be allowed access.<br>
The Windows NT 5.0 PKI integrates support for the latter decisions as a standard feature of Windows NT Server. User certificates can be mapped on a one-to-one or many-to-one basis against security principals (User objects) in the Active Directory. Schannel can take advantage of this information to automatically synthesize a security token for the client such that the Windows NT ACL mechanisms are used to enforce access control to resources. This is advantageous for services in that they can utilize the identical access control mechanism independent of the client authentication mechanism used (PK or Kerberos).<br>
Once the client and server have authenticated each other, they can proceed to negotiate a session key and begin communicating securely. SSL and TLS are also often employed in a mode that doesn't require client authentication. Use of mutual authentication is recommended in the enterprise environment, however, because it allows you to make use of the Windows-based access control mechanisms. Also, the PKI significantly simplifies certificate enrollment and management, reducing the burden on the client."<br>
In another white paper published by the Microsoft Corporation in September 1998, titled "Windows NT Workstation 5.0<br><br>
-6-<br>
Key Benefits and Capabilities Whitepaper", incorporated by-reference herein, (the "Windows 2000 Workstation White Paper") Microsoft provides additional detail on encryption functionality of the Windows 2000 family of operating systems. The Windows 2000 Workstation White Paper stated on page 3 0 thereof, "Windows NT Workstation 5.0 provides support for Public Key security, an industry-standard authentication protocol used over public networks, such as the Internet. The most important use of Public Keys is for digital signatures, which assure authenticity of components, including that: E-mail came from the sender; E-mail cannot be viewed or edited by other users; Applications and drivers come from known sources; Software is protected from tampering after installation; The identity of a remote computer is guaranteed; Secure Internet communication is allowed; Strong encryption is allowed, such as that needed for secure transactions.<br>
While other platforms,  such as any Windows platform running Internet Explorer 4.0, support the use of Public Keys, Windows NT Workstation 5.0 goes further by providing a more robust infrastructure for creating certificates,  "trusts" with other systems, and secure storage for certificates."<br>
The Windows 2000 Workstation White Paper expands on secure virtual private network services, stating on page 31 thereof, "In addition to PPTP, today's most common method, Windows NT Workstation 5.0 supports several new, more secure methods of creating Virtual  Private Networks,  including:  L2TP  (Layer 2<br><br>
-7-<br>
Tunneling Protocol), a more secure version of PPTP, for tunneling, address assignment, and authentication; IPSEC (IP Security Protocol), a standard-based protocol that provides the highest levels of VPN security. With IPSEC, virtually everything above the networking layer can be encrypted. This provides end-to-end privacy, integrity, and authenticity over public networks. The IPSEC method is transparent to applications and protocols. Microsoft is working closely with vendors to support hardware acceleration for IPSEC through NDIS interfaces.<br>
Windows NT Workstation 5.0 also provides an enhanced Network Connections dialog that makes it easier for users to create VPNs (see the "Simplicity" section)."<br>
Additionally, Microsoft discusses storage encryption functionality within the Windows 2000 family of operating systems in the Windows 2000 PKI White Paper, describing an encrypting file system (EFS) which resides in the Windows 2000 kernel. Microsoft states in the Windows 2000 PKI White Paper on pages 21 and 22 thereof, "The Windows NT 5.0 Encrypting File System (EFS) supports transparent encryption and decryption of files stored on a disk in the Windows NT file system (NTFS). The user can designate individual files to encrypt, or folders whose contents are to be maintained in encrypted form. Applications have access to a user's encrypted files in the same manner as unencrypted files. However, they will be unable to decrypt any other user's encrypted files.<br><br>
-8-<br>
EFS makes extensive use of PK-based technology to provide mechanisms for encrypting files to multiple users and well as supporting file recovery. To do this, it utilizes the ability of PK to support bulk encryption without prior shared secrets. In operation, each EFS user generates a public key pair and obtains an EFS certificate. The certificate will be issued by an enterprise CA in the Windows NT 5.0 domain, although EFS will generate a self-signed certificate for stand-alone operation where data sharing is not an issue. In addition, Windows NT 5.0 supports an EFS recovery policy in which trusted recovery agents can be designated. These agents generate an EFS recovery public key pair and will be issued an EFS recovery certificate by the enterprise CA. The certificates of the EFS recovery agents are published to domain clients with the Group Policy Object.<br>
In operation, for each file to be encrypted EFS creates a random key that is used to encrypt the file. The user's EFS public key is then used to encrypt this secret key and associate it with the file. In addition, a copy of the secret key, encrypted with each recovery agent's EFS public key, is associated with the file. No plaintext copy of the secret key is stored in the system.<br>
When retrieving the file, EFS transparently unwraps the copy of the secret key encrypted with the user's public key using the user's private key. This is then used to decrypt the file in real time during file read and write operations. Similarly, a<br><br>
-9-<br>
recovery agent may decrypt the file by using the private key to access the secret key."<br>
Providing additional detail on the level of security of Microsoft's Encrypting File System, the Windows 2000 Workstation White Paper states on page 28 thereof, " An Encrypted File System (EFS) encrypts files on a hard disk. Each file is encrypted using a randomly generated key, which is independent of the users' public and/or private key pair. EFS resides in the Windows NT kernel and uses the non-paged pool to store file encryption keys, ensuring that they never reach the paging file. EFS is supported on a file or directory basis. Encryption and decryption is transparent to the user."<br>
The instability of computing functions (such as, but not limited to, functions resulting in computing system crashes) is generally regarded as greater at the application level than at the operating system level. The closer the computing functions are to the core of the operating system, the more stable they are generally. If an application level decryption program becomes damaged or corrupted and reinstallation of another decryption program is required, a new "decryption key" is generated and the previously encrypted computer files, being encrypted to the old "decryption key," can not be decrypted by the newly installed decryption program. Avoiding the encryption and/or decryption weaknesses inherent in application level programs, Microsoft has taken steps to protect lost "encryption and/or decryption keys" in<br><br>
-10-<br>
the Windows 2000 PKI. Microsoft stated in the Windows 2000 PKI White Paper on page 14 thereof, "Public key pairs and certificates tend to have high value. If they are lost due to system failure, their replacement may be time consuming and result in monetary loss. To address these issues, the Windows NT 5.0 PKI supports the ability to back up and restore both certificates and associated key pairs through the certificate-management administrative tools."<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention offers a new and improved method and system to automatically invoke certain functionality of a public key infrastructure and encrypting file system of operating systems to encrypt computer files or computer programs for electronic transmission between computing devices and encrypt those computer files or computer programs for subsequent storage, and restrict usage permissions and/or rights. The present invention instructs the operating systems of the computing devices to temporarily suspend user intervention until completion of the encrypted transmission and encrypted storage process to prevent unauthorized use of replication of the computer files or computer programs. The present invention instructs the public key infrastructure of a serving device to encrypt for transmission a computer file or computer program (and any accompanying permissions and/or rights established by the serving device) stored within, or connected to, the serving device then transmit said computer file or computer program to the client device.  Upon receipt by the<br><br>
-11-<br>
client device of said computer file or computer program (and any accompanying permissions and/or rights established by the serving device), the present invention automatically instructs the public key infrastructure of the client device to decrypt from transmission said computer file or computer program (and any accompanying permissions and/or rights established by the serving device) transmitted by the serving device. The present invention then instructs the encrypting file system of the client device to encrypt for storage, based on any permissions and/or rights as established by the serving device and which accompanied the computer file or computer program, and store the computer file or computer program. The present invention separates the storage encryption process from the transmission encryption process to enable encrypted transmission between computing devices running different operating systems, using industry standard communication protocols, then having the different operating systems execute their unique or proprietary storage encryption process. Furthermore, the most widely used operating systems support the encrypted transmission standards of the Internet, however, standards do not exist for operating system based encrypted storage. A unique benefit of the present invention is that it utilizes multiple encryption and/or decryption processes to provide an end-to-end solution for the encrypted transfer and storage of computer files and/or programs between computers running different operating systems. Instead of permanently encrypting a computer file and/or program for use on one specific decrypting device or computer, the present invention assigns permissions and/or rights<br><br>
-12-<br>
to the computer file and/or program then tasks the encryption functionality of operating system possessing the computer file and/or program to enforce the permissions and/or rights. In this way, flexible permissions and/or rights can be assigned to the computer file and/or program which follow it from computer to computer, from operating system to operating system, while being encrypted and decrypted, as necessary, along the way.<br>
The present invention also offers a new and improved method and system to activate certain functionality of a public key infrastructure and encrypting file system of the client device to execute any permissions and/or rights which accompanied a given computer file or computer program. Permissions and/or rights (such as but not limited to number of plays, print outs, views, uses, copies, moves, relocations, time duration of use, number of users, etc.) will then be enforced by the encrypting file system in conjunction with the present invention. As example, a computer file or computer program received by a client device could be accompanied with the permission or rights, as established by the serving device, allowing the user of the client device to move said computer file or computer program to another computing device (the "next client device"). In this example, the present invention would instruct the operating systems of the client device and the next client device to prevent user intervention until completion of the move. The present invention instructs the encrypting file system of the client device to decrypt said computer file or computer program.  Then the present invention instructs the public<br><br>
-13-key infrastructure of the client device to encrypt for transmission said computer file or computer program (and the permissions and/or rights established by the serving device), then transmit via communication means the computer file or computer program to the next client device. Upon receipt by the next client device of said computer file or computer program (and the permissions and/or rights established by the serving device) , the present invention automatically instructs the public key infrastructure of the next client device to decrypt from transmission said computer file or computer program (and the permissions and/or rights established by the serving device) transmitted by the client device. The present invention then instructs the encrypting file system of the next client device to encrypt for storage based on the permissions and/or rights established by the serving device which accompanied said computer file or computer program during transmission from the client device, and store said computer file or computer program.<br>
The present invention pertains to a system for manipulating a computer file and/or program. The system comprises a serving device having access to a computer file and/or program which is unencrypted and which can encrypt the unencrypted computer file and/or program to become an encrypted computer file and/or program and transfer it. The system comprises a connector connected to the serving device on which the encrypted computer file and/or program travels and to which the serving device transfers the encrypted computer file and/or program. The system comprises a client device which receives the encrypted computer<br><br>
-14-<br>
file and/or program and decrypts the encrypted computer file and/or program back to the unencrypted computer file and/or program. The client device does not allow intervention to the encrypted computer file and/or program during a time when the encrypted computer and/or file program is received. The serving device is separate, apart and distinct from the client device.<br>
The present invention pertains to a method for manipulating a computer file and/or program. The method comprises the steps of suspending intervention by a user at a client device of the client device. Then there is the step of encrypting an unencrypted computer file and/or program at the server device to form an encrypted computer file and/or program. Next there is the step of transferring the encrypted computer file and/or program to the client device along a connector connected to the client device and the server device.

Then the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 32 instructs the Operating System 62 to reestablish user intervention of the Next Client Device 12.<br>
The user of the Next Client Device 12 may, subject to the permissions and/or rights originally established and transmitted by the Serving Device 10 to the Client Device 11 and then to the Next<br><br>
-51-<br>
Client Device 12, use the Computer File and/or Program 110 as if the Computer File and/or Program 110 were not encrypted. Copies or moves of the Computer File and/or Program 110 which are not executed by the Encrypting File System 52 of the Next Client Device 12, in conjunction with the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 32 of the Next Client Device 12, will not be properly encrypted for use on a computing device other than the Next Client Device 12.<br>
As example, a user of the Serving Device 10 connects the Transceiver 70 of the Serving Device 10 to a Communication Means 120 with a subsequent communications connection to the Internet. The user of the Serving Device 10 saves an audio file (such as, but not limited to, in MP3 format), being a Computer Program and/or File 110, in Storage 100 and assign it a link (such as, but not limited to, a TCP and/or IP hyperlink) to a Serving Interface 20 (such as, but not limited to, a web page). The user of the Client Device 11 connects the Transceiver 71 of the Client Device 11 to a Communication Means 120 with a subsequent communications connection to the Internet. The user of the Client Device 11 is able to view a copy of the Serving Interface 20 within the Client Interface 21 on the video display of the Client Device 11. The user of the Client Device 11 selects the MP3 audio file for download to the Client Device 11 by using its computer mouse to double click on the hyperlink associated with the MP3 audio file which is displayed on the Client Interface 21 on the video display of the Client Device 11.  The double click action instructs the Client Interface 21 to<br><br>
-52-<br>
transmit an electronic request, via Communication Means 120, to download the MP3 audio file from the Serving Device 10 to the Client Device 11. Upon receipt of the transmission request, the Serving Interface signals the Controlling Serving Software and/or Firmware 30 to commence various automatic functions. The Controlling Serving Software and/or Firmware 30 firsts instructs (via Communication Means 120) the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 31 to instruct the Operating System 61 of the Client Device 11 to temporarily suspend user intervention. The Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 31 then instructs (via Communication Means 120) the Controlling Serving Software and/or Firmware 30 to transmit the MP3 audio file. The Controlling Serving Software and/or Firmware 3 0 instructs the Operating System 60 to recall the MP3 audio file, and its associated permissions and/or rights, from Storage 100 and place an electronic copy thereof in Random Access Memory 80. Then the Controlling Serving Software and/or Firmware 30 instructs the Public Key Infrastructure 40 to encrypt and transmit an electronic copy of the MP3 audio file, and its associated permissions and/or rights, to the Client Device 11 via the Communication Means 120. At this point, the Controlling Serving Software and/or Firmware 30 has concluded its portion of the transmission process and the program related to the Controlling Serving Software and/or Firmware 30 terminates. Upon receipt of the MP3 audio file, and its associated permissions and/or rights, by the Client Device 11, the Public Key Infrastructure 41 decrypts the MP3 audio file and its associated permissions  and/or  rights  from  transmission  and  stores  an<br><br>
-53-<br>
electronic copy thereof in Random Access Memory 81. Then the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 31 instructs the Encrypting File System 51 of the Client Device 11 to encrypt and save said electronic copy of the MP3 audio file from Random Access Memory 81 to Storage 101, using the associated permissions and/or rights transmitted by the Serving Device 10. Then the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 31 instructs and instructs the Encrypting File System 51 or the Operating System 61 to erase any electronic copies of the MP3 audio file from Random Access Memory 81. Then the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 31 of the Operating System 61 of the Client Device 11 instructs the Operating System 61 of the Client Device 11 to reestablish user intervention. At this point, the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 31 has concluded its portion of the transmission and encryption for storage process and the program related to the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 31 terminates. The user of the Client Device 11 is now able to play the MP3 audio file and the Encrypting File System 51, subject to the permissions and/or rights used by the Encrypting File System 51 to encrypt the MP3 audio file.<br>
Furthermore, the user of the Client Device 11 then decides to transfer the MP3 audio file to Next Client Device 12, and in this example, the user can do so based on the permissions and/or rights associated with the MP3 audio file. The user of the Client Device 11 connects the Transceiver 71 of the Client Device 11 to a Communication Means 120 with a subsequent communications connection to the Internet.  The user of the Next Client Device 12<br><br>
-54-<br>
connects the Transceiver 72 of the Next Client Device 12 to a Communication Means 120 with a subsequent communications connection to the Internet. The user of the Client Device 11 views the Client Interface 21 and a copy of the Next Client Interface 22 on the video display of the Client Device 11, which displays the relevant contents of Storage 101 and Storage 102, respectively. The user identifies the object (such as, but not limited to, icon) (hereinafter "icon") associated with the MP3 audio file to be moved from Storage 101 to Storage 102. The user of the Client Device 11 uses its computer mouse to move the icon (such as, but not limited to, a graphical user interface drag-n-drop move) associated with the MP3 audio file from the Client Interface 21 window to the Next Client Interface 22 window. The drag-n-drop of said icon associated with the MP3 audio file initiates a series of automated actions by the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 31 then by the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 32. First, the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 31 instructs the Operating System 61 of the Client Device 11 to temporarily suspend user intervention (such as, but not limited to, keyboard or mouse intervention, program or macro instructions, etc.) during execution of the transmission request. Then the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 31 instructs the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 32 to instruct the Operating System 62 of the Next Client Device 12 to temporarily suspend user intervention (such as, but not limited to, keyboard or mouse intervention, program or macro instructions, etc.) during execution of the transmission request. Then the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 32 instructs<br><br>
-55-<br>
the Operating System 62 of the Next Client Device 12 to temporarily suspend user intervention. Then the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 32 instructs the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 31 to transmit the MP3 audio file to the Next Client Device 12. Then the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 31 recalls the permissions and/or rights associated with the MP3 audio file and used by the Encrypting File System 51 and instructs the Encrypting File System 51 to recall and decrypt the MP3 audio file from Storage 101 and save an electronic copy thereof in Random Access Memory 81. Then the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 31 instructs the Public Key Infrastructure 41 of the Operating System 61 of the Client Device 11 to encrypt and transmit the electronic copy of the MP3 audio file from Random Access Memory 81, and its associated permissions and/or rights, to the Next Client Device 12 via Communication Means 120. Then the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 32 instructs the Public Key Infrastructure 42 of the Next Client Device 12 to receive and decrypt from transmission the MP3 audio file, and its associated permissions and/or rights, and place an electronic copy thereof in Random Access Memory 82. In the case of a move of the MP3 audio file from Storage 101 to Storage 102, upon receipt of the MP3 audio file into Random Access Memory 82 by the Next Client Device 12, the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 32 of the Next Client Device 12 automatically instructs the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 31 of the Client Device 11 to instruct the Operating System 61 and/or the Encrypting File System 51 of the Client Device 11 to delete all copies of the MP3 audio file in<br><br>
-56-<br>
Storage 101 or Random Access Memory 81. Then the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 31 instructs the Operating System 61 to reestablish user intervention of the Client Device 11. Then the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 32 automatically instructs the Encrypting File System 52 of the Operating System 62 of the Next Client Device 12 to encrypt and save to Storage 102 said electronic copy of the MP3 audio file from Random Access Memory 82, using the associated permissions and/or rights transmitted from the Client Device 11, and then erase all electronic copies of the MP3 audio file from Random Access Memory 82. Then the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 32 instructs the Operating System 62 to reestablish user intervention of the Next Client Device 12. At this point, the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 32 has concluded its portion of the transmission and encryption for storage process and the program related to the Controlling Client Software and/or Firmware 32 terminates. The user of the Next Client Device 12 is now able to play the MP3 audio file, however, in this example the user of the Client Device 11 is not able to play the MP3 audio file because the file was "moved" and during the "move" process, all copies of the MP3 audio file were erased from the Client Device 11 upon conclusion of the "move" process. Additionally, since the MP3 audio file has been encrypted by the Encrypting File System 51 for use on the Next Client Device 12, traditional moves or duplications of the MP3 audio file will not be authorized by the Encrypting File System 51 and only moves or duplications of the MP3 audio file<br><br>
