				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of aralkylated aromatic compound using heterogeneous catalyst, by catalytic alkylation of aromatic compound with aromatic alkylating agent using a solid catalyst. This invention particularly relates to the preparation of aralkylated aromatic compound by catalytic alkylation of aromatic compound with aromatic alkylating agent using a solid catalyst comprising of gallium.<br>
The process for this invention could be used for the preparation of alkylated aromatic compounds, which re fine chemicals and/or used in the preparation of fine chemicals.<br>
Aralkylated aromatic compounds are useful fine chemicals, these are also used as intermediates in a number of organic synthesis. Both the homogenous and heterogeneous catalyzed liquid phase processes for the preparation of aralkylated aromatic compounds are known in the prior art.<br>
Homogeneous Acid Catalyzed Processes<br>
According to a US patent US 3,678,122 [1972], diphenylmethane was prepared by treating a mixture of benzene and benzyl chloride with CuCl2. A US patent, US 3,679,760 [1972] disclosed the preparation of diaryl alkanes by refluxing benzyl chloride C6H4R1R2 (where R1= H and R2 = H, CH3 or OH) and CuCl2.<br>
A French patent, Fr. Demande 2,144,578 [1973], disclosed that substituted phenols p-RC6H4OH [where R=halogen or C1 to C4 alkyl] are benzylated by benzyl halides in the presence of ZnCl2. A USSR patent, USSR 394,353 [1973] disclosed preparation of 2,6 and 2,4 - (CH3O)2 C6H3CH2C6H5 by treating m-(CH3O)2 C6H4 with benzyl chloride in the presence of SnSO4 catalyst at 145 to 150 degree C, or SnCl2 catalyst at 165 to 170 degree C. A Japanese patent, Japan Kokai 7399,154 [1973], disclosed preparation of dibenzyl benzene<br><br>
derivatives by benzylation of benzene or substituted benzenes using Friedel-Crafts catalyst e.g., A1C13, FeCl3 and 98% H2S04. According to this patent, 200 g a-methyl benzyl chloride was added to a refluxing mixture of 500 g benzene and 5 g A1C13 and the whole mixture refluxed for 5h to give 120 g α-methyl bezylbenzene.<br>
According to a German patent, Ger. Offen 2,456,747 (1976), o-benzyltoluenes were prepared in -90% yields by the reaction of a o-chloromethyltoluene with a benzene derivative in &gt; 1:7 ratio in  the presence of H2SO4 and/or H3PO4   and  optionally 4-CH3C6H4S03H, ZnCl2, BF3) etc.. Thus 135 parts 85% H3P04, 270 parts 85% H2S04, 10 parts 4-CH3C6H4S03H, 70 parts 2CH3C6H4CH2C1 and 390 parts of C6H6 were heated at 75-80° C for 4h to give 89% 2-CH3C6H4CH2C6H5.<br>

A German patent, Ger.Offen DE 3,922,518 (1991), disclosed a process for the manufacture of a-methylbenzylphenol derivatives, which comprises the treatment of dwj-alkyl substituted phenols with styrene in the presence of phosphorus chloride catalyst. More recently, an European Patent, Eur.Pat.Appl.EP 538,704 (1993), disclosed a process for the preparation of p- substituted o-benzylphenols by treating phenols, p-RC6H4OH   (R   =  halo,   alkyl,   OH,   alkoxy,   alkylmercapto,   aryl,   aryloxy  or<br><br>
arylmercapto), with ArCH2X (Ar = corresponding aryl nucleus; X = halo, arylcarboxy, phenylsulfatoxy, hydroxy, alkoxy etc.) in a continuously functioning distillation apparatus in the presence of dissolved acid catalyst.<br>
The main disadvantages of the homogeneous acid catalyzed processes are as follows: 1)  The separation and recovery of the dissolved acid catalysts from the liquid reaction<br>
mixture is difficult.<br>
2)	The disposal of the used acid catalysts creates environmental pollution.<br>
3)	The homogeneous acid catalysts also pose several other problems such as high<br>
toxicity, corrosion, spent acid disposal and use of more than the stoichiometric<br>
amount.<br>
Heterogeneous acid catalyzed processes.<br>
A German patent, Ger.Offen 2,547,030(1977), disclosed the preparation of o-benzyltoluenes by the reaction of o-methylbenzyl halides with substituted benzenes in the presence of Al-silicate. The 2-CH3C6H4CH2Cl was stirred with toluene and Al-silicate (25%Al203) at 110°C to give 81% 2-methylbenzyltoluene. According to a Japanese patent, Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho JP 59,186,937 (1984), o-benzylphenol was prepared by the liquid phase reaction of benzyl alcohol with phenol in the presence of γ-Al2O3. For example 7.5 g γ-Al203 was added to a mixture of 32.5 g benzyl alcohol and 47 g phenol at 190°C under stirring to give a product containing 49.9% o-benzylphenol. A German Patent,   Ger.

A mixture of 0.5  mole 4-ClC6H4OH,  0.1   mole<br><br>
C6H5CH2OH and 0.6 g of Na-Y type zeolite was heated at 200°C for 3 hrs to give 25.4 % 2-benzyl-4-chlorophenol.  ,<br>
A German patent, Ger. Offen DE 3,836,780 (1990), disclosed the process for the preparation of benzylbenzenes from benzenes and benzyl alcohols in the presence of activated bleaching earth and a diluent at 90-140°C. According to Japanese patent, Jpn Kokai Tokkyo Koho JP 03,170,442  (1991), benzylbiphenyls are manufactured by benzylating biphenyl and diphenylmethane with &gt; 1 compound from benzyl halides, benzyl alcohol, benzyl ether in the presence of a zeolite or silica-alumina catalyst. An European patent, Eur.Pat. appl. EP 428,081 (1991), disclosed a process of benzylation of alkylbenzenes with benzyl chloride in the presence of H-Y or H-L zeolite catalyst.

Aralkylation of aromatic compounds by aralkylating agent involves electrophilic substitution of H from the aromatic nucleus. It is well known in the prior art that the electrophilic substitution is favoured by the presence of electron donating groups, such as OH, alkyl, alkoxy, phenoxy, amine, alkyl amine, SH etc., in the aromatic compound to be aralkylated. Whereas the electrophilic substitution is inhibited by the presence of electron withdrawing groups such as halo, nitro, cyano, carboxy, aldehyde, etc., in the aromatic compound to be aralkylated. [ref. G.A.Olah, in Friedel-Crafts and related reactions, Wiley-Interscience Publ., New york, 1963].<br>
Although some limitations of the homogeneous acid catalyzed processes are overcome by the prior art heterogeneous catalyzed processes described above, the aralkylating activity of the solid catalysts used in the prior art processes are low,<br><br>
particularly for aralkylating aromatic compounds containing    electron withdrawing groups. Hence there is a great practical need for finding more efficient solid catalyst for the aralkylating of aromatic compounds. There is also a need for finding highly efficient solid   catalyst also for the aralkylating of aromatic compounds containing electron withdrawing groups such as halo, nitro, cyano, carboxy, aldehyde, etc.. This invention is, therefore, made with the following objects so that most of the drawbacks or limitations of the prior art homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyzed processes for the preparation of aralkylated aromatic compounds could be overcome.<br>
1.        Accordingly, the main object of this invention is to provide a liquid phase process for the preparation of aralkylated aromatic compound by aralkylating aromatic compound with aralkylating agent, using a highly active solid catalyst comprising of gallium, which has high activity not only when the aromatic ring activating groups   (i.e. electron donating groups)   are present in the aromatic ring to be aralkylated but also when aromatic ring deactivating groups    (i.e.  electron withdrawing groups) are present in the aromatic ring to be aralkylated, so that the reaction temperature is low and/or time for completing the reaction is short. 2.        Another important object of this invention is to provide a liquid phase process for the preparation of aralkylated aromatic compound by aralkylating aromatic compound with aralkylating agent, using highly active solid catalyst comprising of gallium, which can be reused repeatedly for the catalytic reaction.<br><br>
This invention provides a process for the preparation of aralkylated aromatic compound, represented by a general chemical formula:<br>
R1R2R3R4QCnH2nC6H3R5R6, having structural formula (1) of the drawing accompanying the specification by the aralkylation of aromatic compound, represented by a general chemical formula: R1R2R3R4M, having structural formula (2) of the drawing accompanying the specification with aralkylating agent, represented by a general chemical formula : R5R6 C6H3H2nX , having structural formula (3) of the drawing accompanying the specification<br>
wherein Q is C6H1 or C10H3 orC14H5; M is C6H2 or C10H4 or C14H6; each of RI, R2) R3 and R4 groups is H or CnH2n-n or CpH2p-1or C6H5 or CnH2nC6H5 or OH or OCnH2n+1 or OC6H5 or halogen or CnH2n+1xYv or N02 or NH2 or    NHC,,H2n+1 or N(CnH2n+1)2 or NHCOCnH2n+1 or NHCOC6H5 or CN or CHO or COOH or COOCnH2n+1 or COCnH2n+1 or S03H or SO3CnH2n-n or SH or alkyl mercapto group or aryl mercapto group; each of R5 and R6 group is H or CH3 or C2H5 or OH or OCH3 or OC2H5 or N02 or halogen or NH2; X is halogen or OH or SO3H or COOH or OCnH2nC6H5 or OCnH2n+1 or aryl carboxy group or alkyl carboxy group , x is an integer between 1 and 2n+l and n &amp; p are integers greater than or equal to 1 and 2, respectively, and C,H,N,O and S are chemical elements, using a solid catalyst comprising gallium, which comprises:<br>
i) pretreating said solid catalyst at a temperature between about 100°C and about 800°C in a flow of moisture-free air or inert gas at a gas hourly space velocity in the range 1000-20000 cm3g-1'h-1'or under vacuum, for a period between about 0.1 hand about lOh.<br>
ii) contacting a liquid mixture of said aromatic compound and said aromatic aralkylating agent having a mole ratio of said aromatic compound   to the said<br><br>
aromatic aralkylating agent between about 0.5 and about 50, in the absence or presence of a suitable solvent selected from nitrobenzene, nitromethane and liquid paraffinic hydrocarbons, with a mole ratio of said solvent to said aralkylating agent between about 0 and about 50 with said pretreated solid catalyst at a weight ratio of solid catalyst to said aromatic aralkylating agent between about 0.02 and about 2.0 in a stirred batch reactor fitted with a reflux condenser, under vigorous stirring, while  bubbling continuously a moisture-free inert gas, such as helium, nitrogen or argon, through the said liquid reaction mixture containing the said catalyst at a flow rate above 0.1 cm3 of inert gas per cm3 of liquid reaction mixture per minute and allowing the reaction to occur at a temperature between about 25°C and about 300°C at a pressure between about 1 atm and about 10 atm for a reaction period between about 0.01 h and about 50 h, and iii)      cooling the reaction mixture to a temperature about 25°C, removing said catalyst from the reaction mixture by filtration and then separating the reaction products from the reaction mixture by the methods known in the prior art.<br>
The main finding of this invention is that, the said catalyst shows high activity in the aralkylation of aromatic compounds not only when the electron donating group, which is aromatic ring activating group, is present in the aromatic ring to be aralkylated but also when the electron withdrawing group, which is aromatic ring deactivating group, is present in the aromatic ring to be aralkylated, so that the reaction temperature is low and/or the time required for completing the reaction is short.<br><br>
Other important finding of this invention is that solid catalyst can be reused repeatedly in the aralkylation of said aromatic compounds. Yet another important finding of this invention is that the mechanism of the aralkylation of aromatic compounds over said solid catalyst is different from that of acid catalyzed Friedel-Crafts aralkylation reaction.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of aralkylated aromatic compound, represented by the formula R1R2R3R4QCnH2nC6H3R5R6, having structural formula (1) of the drawing accompanying the specification by the aralkylation of aromatic compound, represented by a the chemical formula R1R2R3R4M, having structural formula (2) of the drawing accompanying the specification with aralkylating agent, represented by a formula R5R6C6H3H2--nX, having structural formula (3) of the drawing accompanying the specification, wherein Q is C6H1 or C10H3 or C14H5; each of R1, R2, R3 and R4 groups is H or CnH2n+1 or CpH2p+1or C6Hs or CnH2n C6Hs or OH or PCnH2n+1 or OC6H5 or halogen or CnH2n+1-xYx or NO2 or NH2 or NHCnH2n+1or N(CnH2n+1)2 or NHCOCnH2n+1 or NHCOC6H5 or CN or CHO or COOH or COOCnH2n+1 or COCnH2n+1 or SO3H or SO3CnH2n+1or SH or alkyl mercapto group or aryl mercapto group; each of R5 and R6 group of H or CH3 or C2H5 or OH or OCH3 or OC2H5 or NO2 or halogen or NH2 ; X is halogen or OH or SO3H or COOH or OCnH2n+1 or aryl carboxy group or alkyl carboxy group, x is an integer between 1 and 2n+l and n &amp; p are integers greater than or equal to 1 and 2, respectively, and C, H, N, O and S are chemical elements, using a solid catalyst comprising gallium, which comprises:<br><br>
i) pretreating said solid catalyst at a temperature between 100°C and 800°C in a flow of moisture-free air or inert gas at a gas hourly space velocity in the range 1000 - 2000 cm3 g-1h-1 or under vacuum, for a period between about 0.1 h and about 10 h;<br>
ii) contacting a liquid mixture of said aromatic compound and said aromatic aralkylating agent having a mole ratio of said aromatic compound to the said aromatic aralkylating agent between 0.5 and 50, in the absence of presence of a suitable solvent selected from nitrobenzene, nitro methane and liquid paraffmic hydrocarbons, with a mole ratio of said solvent to said alkylating agent between about 0 and about 50 with said pretreated solid catalyst at a weight ratio of solid catalyst to said aromatic alkylating agent between 0.02 and 2.0 in a stirred batch reactor fitted with a reflux condenser, under vigorous stirring, while bubbling continuously a moisture-free inert gas, such as helium, nitrogen or argon, through the said liquid reaction mixture containing the said catalyst at a flow rate above 0.1 cm3 of inert gas per cm3 of liquid reaction mixture per minute and allowing the reaction to occur at a temperature between 20°C and 300°C at a pressure between 1 atm and 100 atm for a reaction period between 0.01 h and 50 h, and<br>
iii) cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature, removing said catalyst from the reaction mixture by filtration and then separating the reaction products from the reaction mixture by the methods known in the prior art.<br><br>
In the process of the present invention, the preferred reaction temperature is between about 50°C and about 200°C; the preferred reaction pressure is between about 1 atm and about 5 atm; the preferred reaction period is between about 0.05 h and about 20 h; the preferred mole ratio of said aromatic compound to said aralkylating agent is between about 1 and about 20; the preferred weight ratio of said catalyst to said aralkylating agent is between about 0.05 and about 0.5.<br>
In the process of the present invention, a preferred said catalyst is selected from micro or mesoporous gallosilicates and galloaluminosilicates, having structure similar to that of zeolites known in the prior art; Ga+3- exchanged micro and mesoporous zeolites and cationic clays; micro or mesoporous gallophosphatcs or galloaluminophosphates; Ga2O3 and /or Ga-halide impregnated or deposited on micro and mesoporous zeolites, crystalline micro and mesoporous alumino- and metallo- phosphates, cationic and anionic clays,  microporous  and  mesoporous  metal  oxides  or  mixed   metal  oxides     and macroporous catalyst supports; gallium oxide pillared clays; and gallium oxide.<br>
A more preferred said catalyst for the process of this invention is selected from H-gallo- and H-galloalumino-silicates of ZSM-5 and MCM-41 type zeolites; Ga2O3 or Ga2O3 deposited on H-ZSM-5 zeolite, MCM-41 zeolite macroporous catalyst supports comprising of silica, alumina, silicon carbide or ZrO2 and HID2 or their mixture; and GaCl3 impregnated on Montmorillonite K10 clay or high silica MCM-41.<br><br>
The process of this invention can be carried out in a stirred batch reactor, fitted with a reflux condenser and arrangement for bubbling inert gas through the reaction mixture, known in the prior art for carrying out liquid phase reactions.<br>
In the process of this invention, the main products formed are said aralkylated aromatic compound and a by-product HX, wherein H = hydrogen and X = halogen or OH or SO3H or COOH or OCnH2nC6H5 or OCnH2n+1 or arylcarboxy group or alkylcarboxy group, depending upon said aralkylating agent used.<br>
In the process of this invention, said aromatic compound and said aralkylating agent are reactants and are converted partially or completely to said products.<br>
In the process of this invention, the role of said solvent, if used, is to dissolve solid<br>
reactant or reactants, to dilute reactants and/or to facilitate the reaction between said aromatic<br>
compound and said aralkylating agent. However, solvent may not be used in the process of<br>
this invention when both the reactants are liquid at said reaction conditions. Normally, said<br>
solvent is not converted in the process of this invention.<br>
In the process of this invention, the role of inert gas bubbling continuously through the reaction mixture is to remove continuously said by-product from the reaction mixture so that the reverse reaction is avoided or minimised and the time required for completing the reaction is shortened.<br>
In the process of this invention, the role of the reflux condenser fitted with the reactor is to condense reactants and solvents and to return them back to the reaction mixture and allow the inert gas, which is continuously bubbling through the reaction mixture, along with said by-product to escape from the reaction mixture.<br>
In the process of this invention, the reaction pressure above atmospheric pressure may be used to allow the reaction to be carried out at temperature higher than the normal boiling point of the reactants and/or solvent, by increasing the boiling point of said reactants and/or solvent with increasing the reaction pressure.<br><br>
Said catalyst, used in the process of this invention, is heterogeneous with respect to the reaction mixture and can be removed from the reaction mixture simply by filtration and the removed catalyst, after washing with solvent or said liquid aromatic compound which is to be aralkylated, can be reused in the said process.<br>
Said pretreatment to said catalyst in step-i of the process of present invention is necessary for removing moisture adsorbed on the catalyst so that the catalyst shows its full efficiency for catalysing the reaction between said aromatic compound and said aralkylating agent.<br>
The role of gallium compound present in said catalyst is to activate both the reactants, said aromatic compound and said aralkylating agent. The R5R6C6H3CnH2n----X bond of said aralkylating agent is weakened by its interaction with said gallium compound, leading to the formation of a stable carbocation [R5R6C6H3CnH2nr (I) and X~ . In the presence of said carbocation (I), said aromatic compound is activated on gallium compound by weakening its bond between aromatic nucleus and H, leading to the formation of a penta-coordinated carbocation by the combination of said activated aromatic compound and said carbocation (I). The said penta-coordinated carbocation is then decomposed to said aralkylated aromatic compound, the main product of the reaction, and a proton, which combines with X~ to give HX, the by-product of the reaction.<br>
Said catalyst used in the process of invention can be prepared by various methods, such as hydrothermal synthesis, impregnation, coating, cation exchange, coprecipitation and pillaring of clays, all known in the prior art.<br><br>
Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates containing well defined channels or pores of uniform diameter. A large number of microporous zeolites, such as X, Y, mordenite, L, beta, ZSM-5, ZSM-8, ZSM-11, etc., and mesoporous zeolites, such as M41S type material, e.g. MCM-41, are known in the prior-art. [ ref. Breck in Zeolite Molecular Sieves,    Wiley-Interscience   Publ.,   New   York,    1974;    Beck   and   Co-workers. J.Am.Chem.Soc., vol.114, page 10834,year 1992; Nature (London) vol.359, page 710, year 1992].<br>
In general, micropores have diameter below 1 run; mesopores have diameter between about 1 nm and about 20 nm; and macropores have diameter above about 20 nm. Said catalyst containing only micropores may be used in the process of this invention when both the reactants have minimum molecular diameter or critical size less than 0.7 nm. Whereas said catalyst containing meso and/or macropores may be used in the process of this invention for both small and large molecular size reactants.<br>
By the process of this invention, benzene, nitrobenzene (which contains highly deactivating electron withdrawing group NCh) and anthracene can be benzylated with benzyl chloride to corresponding aralkylated aromatic compound with a benzyl chloride conversion of 95%, 95% and 95%,   respectively, at 1 atm pressure, temperature 80°C, 135°C and   130°C,  respectively and reaction period  0.16  h,  0.27 h  and  0.31   h, respectively, using Ga2O3 (10 wt %) supported on commercial low surface area (<lm2 macroporous silica-alumina catalyst carrier.></lm2>

The main advantages of the process of this invention over the prior art processes for the preparation of aralkylated aromatic compounds are as follows:<br>
1)      The process of this invention has a number of advantages over the earlier homogeneous catalysed processes for the preparation of aralkylated aromatic compounds, as follows: In the process of this invention i) the catalyst used is heterogeneous solid catalyst and hence it can be separated<br>
T<br>
from the reaction products simply by filtration ,<br>
ii) the separated catalysts can be reused in the process for a number of times, and iii) also the catalyst is non corrosive, therefore most of the serious problems associated with homogeneous catalyst used in the earlier homogeneous catalysed processes for the preparation of aralkylated aromatic compounds are overcome m the process of this invention. 2)        The process of this invention has also  number of advantages over the prior art<br>
processes based on the use of solid catalyst for the preparation of aralkylated<br>
aromatic compounds, as follows:<br>
i) The activity of the said catalyst used in the process of present invention is<br>
higher.<br>
ii) The process of the present invention can be used for aralkyating both small and<br>
large size aromatic compounds with both small and large size aralkylating agents<br>
to produce the corresponding aralkylated compounds.<br>
iii) In the process of this invention, since moisture-free inert gas is bubbled<br>
through the reaction mixture continuously, said by-product formed in the reaction<br>
is removed continuously and thereby the reverse aralkylation reaction is avoided or minimised, thus requiring shorter time for completing the reaction, iv) In the process of this invention, it is possible to carry out the aralkylation reaction at a temperature higher than the normal boiling point of either of the reactants and the solvent, and thereby the reaction period for completing the reaction is shortened and/or the inhibition of the reaction due to strong adsorption of the reactants, products or solvent on the catalyst is avoided or minimised, v) By the process of this invention, the aralkylation of said aromatic compound is possible at mild reaction conditions even though when the aromatic compound does not contain any aromatic nucleus activating group or electron donating group, for example when aromatic compound is benzene, or when said aromatic compound contains electron withdrawing group,   for example halide or nitro group, which has highly deactivating effect on the aromatic nucleus for the aralkylation reaction.<br><br><br>
