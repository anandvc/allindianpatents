Complete Specification<br>
A process for the manufacture of optically pure (R) or (S)-5-(2- aminopropvO-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide.<br><br><br>
CADILA HEALTHCARE LIMITED, Zydus Tower, Satellite Cross Road, Ahmedabad, 380 015, Gujarat India.<br>
The following specification describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of enantiomerically pure (R) or (S)-5-(2- aminopropyl)-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide by resolution of (R, S)-5-(2-aminopropyl)-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide with D-i.e. (2S, 3S) or L-i.e. (2R, 3R)-tartaric acid respectively. The optically pure (R)-(-)-5-(2-aminopropyI) -2-methoxybenzenesulfonaminde of formula I is a key intermediate for the preparation of Tamsulosin of formula II (EP-34432, US-4703063) useful in the treatment of patients with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
European Patent 257787 describes a method for the preparation of optically pure (R)-(-)-5-(2-aminopropyl)-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide based on the principle of diastereomeric separation. Thus 5-acetonyl-2-methoxybenzene- sulfonamide (III) as in scheme-1 is reacted with an optically active benzylic amine (IV) under reducing conditions to obtain a diastereomeric mixture (V) (RR: SR) in varying ratio depending upon the reducing agent employed. The material thus obtained is subjected to the following operations: (i) suspension in a solvent, (ii) heating for a specified time, (iii) cooling, (iv) filtration. This cycle of operations is repeated (at least four times) till an optical purity of9$.0 % of VI is achieved.<br>
Compound VI of 98% optical purity is again mixed with water &amp; another solvent such as acetone or acetonitrile. The mixture is heated to reflux, cooled &amp; filtered. The crystals obtained are subjected to repeated cycles of mixing with the solvent, rerluxing, cooling &amp; filtration (at least three times) until desired optical purity of &gt;99.5% is obtained for Compound VII (Scheme - 1).<br><br><br><br>
Optically pure diastereomer VII is debenzylated under acidic conditions to obtain R-(-)-5-(2-aminopropyl)-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide as hydrochloride salt (VIII), which is isolated and treated with a base to obtain desired compound I.<br>
US patent 4703063 relates to novel sulfamoyl-substituted phenethylamine derivatives and the acid addition salts thereof, and more particularly, to novel sulfamoyl-substituted phenethylamine derivatives and the acid addition salts thereof which exhibit a strong .alpha.-adrenergic blocking action and are useful as an antihypertensive agent and a treating agent for congestive heart failure.<br><br><br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION:<br>
It is evident from above that though prior art looks conceptually very good but practically, it is very cumbersome &amp; time consuming. One will have to carry out number of times repeated operations as well as analysis to obtain optically pure I. Therefore, the above mentioned process is not a suitable process to operate for large-scale production.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a plant friendly yet inexpensive process for the manufacture of R- (-)-5-(2-aminopropyl)-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide (I). This objective of the present invention can only be achieved, if one can invent a suitable diastereomeric salt of I whose differential solubility properties could be exploited in a suitable solvent system at an appropriate temperature range to obtain desired optically pure (R)-(-)-5-(2- aminopropyl)-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide (I) in the minimum possible operations.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the manufacture of optically pure (R) or (S)-5- (2- aminopropyl)-2-methoxybenzenesulfonarnide (I), which comprises resolving (R,S)-5-(2-aminopropyl)-2-methoxybenzene-sulfonamide with D- or L-tartaric acid to form a mixture of diastereomeric salts, separating the diastereomeric salts in two stage process in a mixture of solvent systems of the kind such as described at a specified temperature range and contacting the individual salts so separated with base of the kind such as herein described to certain pH range such as herein described to provide said (R)-(-)-5-(2-aminopropyl)-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide (I) in optically pure form (Scheme - 2).<br><br><br>
(R, S)-5-(2- aminopropyI)-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide can be prepared by any known procedure but is preferably prepared by a two step procedure (Scheme-2) starting from 5-acetonyl~2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide (III) converting its keto functional group into oxime (IX) &amp; reducing it with hydrogen under catalytic conditions to obtain the racemic amino compound (X).<br>
Optical purity of more than 99.5% is achieved through two stage procedure. In the first stage racemic 5-(2-aminopropyl)-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide (X) is reacted with D-tartaric acid to form the salt (XI) having a melting point between 189-195°C Salt obtained is cleaved with alkali and pH is adjusted between 9.5-10. Substantially resolved amine is obtained as a crystalline solid. This is again treated with D-tartaric acid followed by desalting to obtain optically pure R (-)-5-(2-aminopropyl)-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide (I).<br><br><br>
Preferably, the ratio of (R, S)-5-(2- aminopropyl)-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide to the D (-) tartaric acid is 1:1 to 1:1.1 mole. The diastereomeric salt formation as well as resolution is preferably carried out in the same solvent system, but these operations can also be performed in two different solvents.<br>
It has been observed that the resolution of 5-(2-aminopropyl)-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide tartarate is largely governed by the polarity of the solvent system used. The solvent system preferred is a combination of alcoholic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, propanol having 5-20% (v/v) of polar solvents such as amidic solvents e.g. dimethyl form amide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone; dimethylsulfoxide or water. Though water alone can also be used for salt formation and resolution at room temperature, however in order to obtain optimum yield and optical purity, it's used in combination with alcoholic solvents.<br>
Temperature plays a major role in obtaining the optically pure R- (-)-5-(2-aminopropyl)-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide. It has been observed that if the resolution is carried out at 50-70°C, the desired product is obtained in a higher optical purity. Temperature between 60-65°C provides the best results and is therefore preferable.<br>
The reaction time may vary between 4 to 26 hrs after the addition of the amine to the tartaric acid; however under optimal reaction conditions, reaction time of 6 to 8 hrs is preferred to obtain the optimum optical purity as well as yield.<br>
The separated solid salt (R amine: D acid) from the reaction mass is isolated by filtration. Optically purified diastereomeric salt is treated with a base preferably sodium hydroxide to bring pH 9.5 - 10 to obtain free R- (-)-5-(2-aminopropyl)-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide.<br>
From the mother liquor obtained from second stage filtration, 5-(2-aminopropyI)-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide is recovered in ~ 90% optical purity and is used in next cycle of resolution to enhance the productivity. It can also be resolved separately if so desired.<br>
The resolving agent D-tartaric acid can be recovered from the aqueous part by usual methods known in the literature and can be recycled for resolution.<br><br><br>
Besides D-tartaric acid, L-tartaric acid can also be used as a resolving agent. The resolution of (R, S)-5-(2-aminopropyl)-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide using L-tartaric acid is carried out in the same fashion. However in this case, (2S, 3S,S)- diastereomeric salt separates out from the reaction mixture which after desalting gives the S- (+)-5-(2-aminopropyl)-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide.<br>
The present invention is further described in greater detail as illustrated in non-limiting examples. It should be understood that variations &amp; modifications of the process are possible within the ambit of the invention broadly disclosed herein.<br>
