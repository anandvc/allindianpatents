COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10 and Rule 13]<br>
"PROCESS FOR PREPARING ADRENALINE OR AN ADDITION SALT OF<br>
ADRENALINE"<br>
BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM PHARMA GMBH &amp; CO. KG., a German company, of Binger Strasse 173, D-55216 Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing adrenaline or an addition salt of adrenaline.<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for preparing adrenaline, or an addition salt thereof, on an industrial scale, with asymmetric hydrogenation as a key step and a special sequence of successive steps, using [Rh(COD)Cl] 2 as catalyst and a chiral, bidentate phosphine ligand such as (2R, 4R)-4-dicyclohexylphosphmo)-2-(diphenylphosphino-meuiyl)-N-methyl-aminocarbonyl-pyrrolidine as the catalyst system.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
Adrenaline is a hormone and neurotransmitter which belongs to the catecholamines. In the human body it is formed from tyrosine when the latter is reacted via dihydroxyphenylalanine, dopamine and noradrenaline, finally producing adrenaline. Adrenaline, being a sympathetic agent, stimulates the adrenergic receptors of the sympathetic nervous system, increasing the pulse rate, cardiac output and systolic blood pressure, reducing intestinal peristalsis, relaxing the bronchial muscles and dilating the bronchi, dilating the pupils, increasing the basal metabolic rate by promoting O2 consumption, hyperglycaemia and glycosuria by mobilising the glycogen reserves in the liver and increasing lipolysis, inter alia, thereby increasing the free fatty acid in the blood. Because of its wide rtange of activities adrebaline is of<br>
considerable commercial interest in the treatment of anaphylactic shock, inter alia, or as an addition to local anaesthetics.<br>
Chemically, adrenaline is Ll-(3',4'Himydroxy-phenyl)-2-memylammoethan-l-ol with the following structure (formula I): Formula I:<br><br><br>
Industrially, adrenaline is usually manufactured by non-stereoselective hydrogenation of 3 ',4'-dmydroxy-2-N-methyl-amino-acetophenone or a derivative thereof with protected OH functions or amino function and subsequent racemate separation.<br>
Enantioselective methods of synthesis are also known. One of these is described, for example, in Tetrahedron Letters 5 (1979), 425 - 428. According to this, 3',4'-dihydroxy-2-N-methyl-amino-acetophenone is reacted to produce adrenaline by hydrogenation under a hydrogen pressure of about 50 x 105 Pa using a chiral hydroxyalkylferrocenylphosphine as catalyst. The amount of catalyst to substrate is about 1:100, based on the molar ratio. Under these conditions, R-l-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-methylamino-ethan-l-ol (adrenaline) is obtained in an enantiomeric excess over the S-enantiomer of 60 °A.eej&amp;fter about 2 to 4 days reaction. However, this process is unsuitable for producing adrenaline on an industrial scale for a number of reasons: in spite of the use of large amounts of catalyst in the asymmetric reaction step the product cannot be produced in sufficiently pure form for pharmaceutical purposes except by the use of expensive purification procedures, as this reaction produces adrenaline only as a mixture containing a relatively high proportion of the opposite enantiomer as a contaminant. The relatively long reaction time of the asymmetric hydrogenation step, i.e. 2 to 4 days, also constitutes a reaction step which is very equipment-intensive and expensive for industrial purposes, with not inconsiderable safety risks.<br>
Achiwa et al. writing in Tetrahedron Letters 30 (1989), 367 - 370 and Chem. Pharm. Bull. 43_ (5) (1995) 738- 747.describe an asymmetric rhodium catalyst which was used in the manufacture of L-phenylephrine. Using asymmetric hydrogenation, 3'-benzyloxy-2-(N-benzyl-N-methyl)-aminoacetophenone hydrochloride is reduced within 20 hours with hydrogen in the presence of [Rh(COD)Cl] 2 /(2R, 4R)-4-(dicyclohexylphosphino)-2-(diphenylphosphino-methyl)-N-methyl-aminopyrrolidine as catalyst. After filtration, concentration of the reaction mixture and cleaving of the benzyl nitrogen protecting group, phenylephrine is obtained as the product. In addition to the L-enantiomer, the D-enantiomer is also obtained in an amount of at least 7.5% as a contaminant (85% ee). The precise mechanism of rhodium-catalysed asymmetric hydrogenation is not known at present.<br>
The main disadvantage of this process is that the L-phenylephrine obtained cannot be purified ^ economically on an industrial scale to the level of purity essential for its use as a<br><br>
pharmaceutical. Moreover, the hydrogenation reaction is relatively long, taking more than 20 hours, which is associated with the disadvantages described above.<br>
It is not known to produce adrenaline by this method.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a new process for preparing adrenaline by asymmetric hydrogenation which overcomes the problems and drawbacks known from the prior art or described above.<br>
One of the essential objectives of the present invention is to develop a process by means of which adrenaline can be produced with high optical and chemical purity. Thus, for example, the risk of the unwanted enantiomer contaminating pharmaceutical preparations which contain adrenaline as active ingredient should be minimised.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to develop a process by means of which substantially enantiomerically pure adrenaline can be produced easily, i.e. without complicated purification procedures.<br>
A further aim of the invention is to produce adrenaline by means of a stereoselective process in order to avoid reaction steps in which chiral intermediate compounds or the chiral end product adrenaline is obtained as a racemate together with its opposite enantiomer in a similar amount.<br>
The process according to the invention also sets out to keep the hydrogenation times needed for adrenaline production as short as possible in order to reduce the costs and risks involved in using hydrogen under high pressure, inter alia.<br>
Another aim of the present invention is to provide the skilled person with a process for manufacturing adrenaline by which this substance, which is needed in large quantities, can be produced cheaply from readily available educts.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that adrenaline or the sulphate thereof can be obtained in exceptionally high optical purity from 3\4'-dihydroxy-2-N-benzyl-N-methyl-amino-<br><br>
acetophenone 1 using asymmetric hydrogenation with [Rh(COD)Cl] 2 /(2R, 4R)-4-dicyclohexylphosphino)-2-(dipheflylphosphino-methyl)-N-methyl-aminocarbonylpyrrolidine (MCCPM) as the catalyst system and a special sequence of subsequent steps. The abbreviation COD used in the general formula denotes cyclooctadiene.<br>
Specific description of the invention<br>
With a molar ratio of catalyst to substrate of about 1:1500 (see example), adrenaline sulphate 3 can be obtained by the process according to the invention, starting from benzyladrenalone (3',4'-dihydroxy-2-N-benzyl-N-methyl-amino-acetophenone) 1, with an optical purity of 98% ee or more (HPLC) (reaction diagram 1).<br>
Reaction diagram 1 :<br><br><br>
According to reaction diagram 1, first of all 3',4'-dihydroxy-2-N-benzyl-N-methyl-amino-acetophenone 1 is reacted by asymmetric hydrogenation, using [Rh(COD)Cl] 2 /(2R, 4R)-4-(dicyclohexylphosphino)-2-(diphenylphosphino-methyl)-N-methyl-aminopyrrolidmeas catalyst, to form the optically active benzyladrenaline base (R-l-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-N-benzyl-N-methyl-amino-ethan-1 2(reaction step 1) This is then precipitated in the <br>
basic range by the addition of ammonia (reaction step 2).   In a 3rd reaction step the benzyl protecting group is then eliminated by hydrogenation with hydrogen and palladium,<br><br>
preferably palladium on charcoal, in a sulphuric acid solution, so as to obtain the adrenaline sulphate 3.<br>
For easy production of almost optically pure adrenaline or its sulphate 3, another important step, in addition to asymmetric hydrogenation with the rhodium catalyst described above, is precipitation of the N-benzyladrenaline 2. By means of these two steps taken together, asymmetric hydrogenation plus precipitation of the benzyladrenaline in the basic range, an intermediate compound with high optical purity is readily obtained, from which adrenaline or the acid addition salts thereof can be obtained with high optical purity in another simple reaction step.<br>
The educt 1 may be, apart from 3',4'-dihydroxy-2-N-benzyl-N-methyl-amino-acetophenone , another derivative of 3',4'-dihydroxy-2-N-methyl-amino-acetophenone (adrenalone), in which the nitrogen function either has no further protection, is protected as a salt or is protected with a protecting group other than the ben2yl protecting group. Suitable protecting groups of this kind include, for example, tert-butylcarbonyl-, 9-fluorenylmethylcarbonyl- or another nitrogen protecting group known from the relevant prior art.   N-protected 1 -(3' ,4'-dihydroxy)-2- N-methyl-amino-acetophenone derivatives having a protecting group which is stable under the reaction conditions of the first reaction step (asymmetric hydrogenation) are preferred.    3',4'-dihydroxy-2-N-benzyl-N-methyl-amino-acetophenone 1 is particularly preferred as the educt. Educt 1 can be used as free base or salt, i.e. of an inorganic acid.<br>
^_ .	■ ■   ■<br>
The catalyst used according to the invention is [Rh(COD)Cl]2 and a chiral, bidentate phosphine ligand. Preferably, (2R, 4R)-4-(dicyclohexylphosphino)-2-(diphenylphosphino-methyl)-N-methyl-aminocarbonylpyrrolidine (RR-MCCPM) is used as catalyst.<br>
The preparation of this catalyst is known from the prior art [EP-A-0 251 164, EP-A-0 336 123].

The use of polymer-bound ligands of this kind does not necessarily rule out the use of non-polymer-bound ligands at the same time. Polymer-bound catalysts of this kind are particularly advantageous for easy purification of the product.<br><br>
The catalyst is used either as a pre-prepared, oxygen-free solution of [Rh(COD)Cl]2 and ligand or prepared in situ from [Rh(COD)Cl]2 and ligand in the presence of the 3\4'-dihydroxy-2-N-benzyl-N-methyI-amino-acetophenone 1 without oxygen, under a protective gas atmosphere or hydrogen atmosphere.<br>
The molar ratio of educt 1 to catalyst in the process according to the invention is between 500:1 and 10,000; 1, preferably between 500:1 and 3000:1 more preferably between 1000:1 and 2000:1 and most preferably about 1500:1.<br>
The reaction medium used for the first reaction step (asymmetric hydrogenation with the rhodium catalyst) is a protic solvent which is preferably degassed before use.

"15 to 25 x10s Pa.	<br>
This first reaction step is complete after 2 to 8 hours, preferably 4 to 6 hours.<br>
Then the solvent is evaporated down sharply by distillation, optionally diluted with water and active charcoal is added thereto. After the active charcoal has been filtered off again, the reaction mixture is diluted with water and preferably the same solvent that was used for the asymmetric hydrogenation, and a base is added in order to precipitate out the N-benzyladrenaline (L-l-(3',4'-dihydroxy-phenyl)-2-N-benzyl-N-methyl-amino-ethan-l-ol) 2 in high optical yields.<br>
Suitable bases are weak organic or inorganic bases. In both cases nitrogen bases are particularly preferred. Of the organic bases, nitrogen bases such as pyridine, piperidine, triethylamine, diethylamine, ethyl-isopropylamine, methylamine or derivatives thereof are particularly preferred, provided that they are soluble in the solvent. Ammonia is particularly preferred among the inorganic bases.<br><br>
Ammonia is particularly preferred.<br>
The substantially enantiomerically pure N-benzyladrenaline 2 obtained is hydrogenated with hydrogen in a third step. A palladium catalyst is preferably used, especially palladium on charcoal. This hydrogenation preferably takes place in the acid range. The pH of the solution is adjusted to 4 to 6, more preferably 5 to 6, by the addition of acid.<br>

Using the process according to the invention, adrenaline can be obtained by means of all three reaction steps in a total yield of 75% or more, with an optical purity of 98% ee or more and a chemical purity of 98% or more.<br>
The advantage of the process according to the invention is that the amount of catalyst can be significantly reduced in relation to comparable methods known from the prior art, or the reaction time of the asymmetric hydrogenation can be substantially reduced whilst at the same time achieving an increase in the optical yield.<br>
In addition, the process according to the invention makes it possible to cany out optical purification at the stage of the intermediate product, N-ben2yladrenaline 2, and thereby easily obtain adrenaline of high optical purity.<br><br>
