Field of the invention<br>
The   present   invention   relates  to   a   new   series   of   pyrazolopyridine derivatives, a process to prepare them, pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds and their application in medicine. Background of the invention<br>
Kinases are proteins involved in different cellular responses to external signals. In the Nineties, a new family of kinases called MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinases) was discovered. MAPK activate their substrates by phosphorylation in serine and threonine residues.<br>
MAPK are activated by other kinases in response to a wide range of signals including growth factors, pro-inflammatory cytokines, UV radiation, endotoxins and osmotic stress. Once they are activated, MAPK activate by phosphorylation other kinases or proteins, such as transcription factors, which, ultimately, induce an increase or a decrease in expression of a specific gene or group of genes.<br>
The MAPK family includes kinases such as p38, ERK (extracellular-regulated protein kinase) and JNK {C-Jun N-terminal kinase).<br>
Kinase p38 plays a crucial role in cellular response to stress and in the activation pathway in the synthesis of numerous cytokines, especially tumor necrosis factor (TNF-ct), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8).<br>
IL-1 and TNF-a are produced by macrophages and monocytes and are involved in the mediation of immunoregulation processes and other physiopathological conditions. For example, elevated levels of TNF-a are associated with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and with processes that trigger the degradation of connective and bone tissue such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease and sepsis.<br>
Thus, p38 kinase inhibitors could be useful to treat or prevent diseases mediated by cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-a, as mentioned previously.<br>
On the other hand, it has also been found that p38 inhibitors inhibit other pro-inflammatory proteins such as IL-6, IL-8, interteron-y and GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor). Moreover, in recent studies it has been found that p38 inhibitors not only block cytokine synthesis but also the<br><br>
cascade of signals that these induce, such as induction of the cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme (COX-2). Description of the invention<br>

The compounds of formula I and their salts differ in some physical properties but they are equivalent for the purposes of the present invention.<br>
Some of the compounds of the present invention can exist in solvated form, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol and the like are equivalent to the unsolvated form for the purposes of the invention.<br>
Some of the compounds of the present invention may exist as several diastereoisomers and/or several optical isomers.

Moreover, some compounds of the present invention may exhibit cis/trans isomers. The present invention includes each of the geometric isomers and its mixtures.<br>
The compounds of formula I can be obtained by following the processes described below. As it is obvious to one skilled in the art the exact method used to prepare a given compound can vary depending on its chemical structure. Moreover, in some of the processes described below it may be necessary or advisable to protect the reactive or labile groups by conventional protective groups. Both the nature of these protective groups and the procedures followed to introduce or remove these are well known and form part of the state of the art (see for example Greene T.W. and Wuts P.G.M, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", John Wiley &amp; Sons, 3rd edition, 1999). As an example, as protective<br><br>
groups of an amino function tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) or benzyl (Bn) can be used. The carboxyl groups can be protected for example in the form of C1-6alkyl esters or arylalkyl esters, such as benzyl, while the hydroxyl groups can be protected for example with tetrahydropyranyl (THP).
