METHOD   AND  APPARATUS   FOR   CLEANING   A   MOBILE<br>
IMMERSED   STRUCTURE<br>
This present invention relates to a process and a cleaning appliance tor a<br>
5      mobile immersed structure (or floating if appropriate).<br>
Seismic arrays or "streamers" are used in particular to explore underwater<br>
ground structures, in particular to look for the presence of oil or of gas in the<br>
sedimentary layers of the ocean floor<br>
Such a streamer generally includes a hollow tubular structure, along the length<br>
10 of which are provided hydrophones (sensors which are sensitive to underwater<br>
acoustic waves), as well as vanes ("or planes") which are used to adjust the depth of<br>
immersion of the section of streamer to which they are attached. The hydrophones are<br>
used to measure the propagation times of echoes of sound pulses which are returned<br>
by the sedlmentary layers.<br>
15                  Streamers can have a length of several kilometres or even tens of kilometres.<br>
They can remain immersed in the seawater for several consecutive months. They are<br>
generally immersed to a shallow depth (of a few metres), and towed along at low<br>
speed (not more than 5 knots), The tubular structure of the streamer is therefore<br>
subject to touling. Living organisms that develop on the outer surface of this structure<br>
20 can lead to the formation on the fatter of amalgams or incrustations which interfere with<br>
the measurements to be performed.<br>
ft is therefore necessary to clean the outer surface of the tubular structure of the<br>
streamer. This cleaning necessitates cessation of the measurements and "rewinding"<br>
of the streamer on board the ship that is towing it. This results in a considerable<br>
25     wastage of time.<br>
One objective of the invention is to offer a process and a cleaning appliance for<br>
such a structure, which provides at least a partial remedy for these drawbacks.<br>
According to  a first aspect, the invention consists of cleaning a seismic<br>
streamer while it is being towed by a ship, by means of a cleaning appliance consisting<br>
30      of a tool for cieaning the outer surface of the streamer, and a structure which creates a<br>
hydrodynamic drag by free displacement of the cleaning appliance along the length of<br>
the streamer.<br>
It is preferable that one should generate movement of the cleaning appliance<br>
along the length of the streamer at a speed of at least 0.5 metres per second, and in<br>
35      particular at a speed located witnin a ranjo of 1 to 2:5 m/s. To this end, the streamer is<br><br>
2<br>
towed at a higher speed in order that the cleaning appliance moves at an adequate<br>
speed in relation to the water. The ratio of the towing speed of the streamer to the<br>
sliding speed of the cleaning appliance along the lensth of the streamer is of the order<br>
of 1.5 m/s for example, with the speed of the cleaning appliance in relation to the water<br>
5      being of the order of 1m/s for example.<br>
According to another aspect, the invention proposes a cleaning appliance for<br>
the cleaning of a seismic streamer - or a similar rope-like immersed structure — which<br>
includes:<br>
a tool for cleaning the outer surface of the streamer,<br>
10                        the means of positioning and guidance, adapted to the shape of the<br>
streamer, in order to allow the cleaning appliance to remain attached to<br>
the streamer and to travel along the length of the latter, and<br>
      a drag structure to create hydrodynamic resistance during movement of<br>
the cleaning appliance along  the longitudinal axis oi the streamer<br>
15                              (and/or along the axis of the positioning and guidance devices), so as to<br>
give rise to a movement of the cleaning appliance along the streamer<br>
when the latter is moved (towed under the water) along its longitudinal<br>
axis.<br>
Because of the presence of the drag structure, it is possible to cause the<br>
20      cleaning appliance to slide along the length of the immersed streamer when it is towed,<br>
without requiring the provision of, or a reserve of, external drive energy. The cleaning<br>
appliance moves independently by sliding along the length of the tubular structure of<br>
            the  streamer   No  "umbilical" connecting  the appliance  to  the ship   is therefore<br>
necessary.<br>
25                  It is prefeorable that the resources for positioning and guidance of the appliance<br>
in relation to the streamer should include a pair - and preferably several pairs — of<br>
wheels, rollers, runners, or pulleys, to roll or slide at low friction, respectively on two<br>
approximately diametricalty-opposite portions of the outer surface of the tubular<br>
structure of the streamer.<br>
30                  it is preferable that the appliance should also include - and this fs yet another<br>
aspect of the invention - some buoyancy resources in order to allow the cleaning<br>
appliance to maintain an approximately constant tilt, and therefore an approximately<br>
constant orientation (to within plus or minus 5 or 10 degrees, for example) in relation to<br>
the longitudinal axis of the streamer, during its movement along the length of the towed<br>
35      streamer. This allows the appliance to be astride the vanes - "wings" or "planes" or<br><br>
3<br>
other protruding accessones - which are attached to the tubular structure of the<br>
streamer, during the movement of the cleaning appliance along the length of the<br>
streamer.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, a cleaning appliance for a seismic<br>
5      streamer according to the invention includes a mobile cleaning tool, in particular a<br>
rotary cleaning brush, as well as the drive resources to move the tool (in particular to<br>
cause the brush to rotate), under the effect of movement of the cleaning appliance in<br>
relation to the water which surrounds it and/or in relation to the streamer In this fatter<br>
case, these drive resources are preferably moved by friction on the outer surface of the<br>
10      rope-like (tubular) structure of the streamer,<br>
Implementation of the drag structure can take various forms. The different<br>
elements making up the appliance, which project in relation to the outer surface of the<br>
streamer, can in certain cases contribute to the creation of a structure presenting a<br>
level of drag which is sufficient, firstly, to oppose the mechanical friction forces due to<br>
15      the cleaning appliance sliding along the length of the streamer and, secondly, to<br>
provide it with an adequate speed of movement along the length of the latter. However,<br>
in order to limit tine size of the appliance and also the acoustic noise resulting from of<br>
the movement of the appliance, ft is preferably equipped with a specially-designed<br>
structure in order to increase the hydrodynamic drag of the cleaning appliance.<br>
20                  According to a preferred method of implementation, this structure includes a<br>
section of conduit which broadens out at the front and is open at its two ends. This<br>
  results in a structure in the form of a throat or funnel or water sock, through which the<br>
surrounding seawater-flows because of the movement of the appliance in relation to<br>
the latter.<br>
25                  When such a drag structure is used, the drag results from the high drag<br>
coefficient of a cone placed in the direction opposite to the flow.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, it is possible to equip the cleaning appliance with a<br>
ffap or pivoting deflector capable of extending approximately crosswise in relation to<br>
the direction of movement of the cleaning appliance, in order to give rise to a additional<br>
30      drag in an automatic manner.<br>
It is preferable to equip the cfeaning appliance with a drag structure consisting<br>
of two drag structure elements, which are approximately identical (or symmetrical) in<br>
shape and dimensions and positioned approximately diametrically opposite to each<br>
other on the axis of movement of the appliance along the streamer, that is in relation to<br>
35      the longitudinal axis of the streamer. This enables one to orientate a resultant of the<br><br>
4<br>
Iwo drags contributed respectively by each drag structure element, approximately<br>
parallel to the axis of movement of the cleaning appliance along the streamer This<br>
also allows the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cleaning appliance and on the<br>
streamer to be balanced. The result is a reduction in the mechanical stresses exerted<br>
5 by the cleaning appliance on the streamer as well as greater effectiveness of the<br>
system for "passive propulsion" of the appliance along the streamer.<br>
In order to adapt the cleaning appliance to various towing conditions of the<br>
streamer, and in particular in order to increase or reduce the speed of movement of the<br>
appliance along the streamer, the latter preferably includes the means to adjust the<br>
10 drag coefficient of the drag structure. To this end, part at least of the drag structure can<br>
be arranges to pivot or to move between a position of maximum drag and a position of<br>
minimum drag.<br>
In order to reduce the forces exerted on the streamer and to facilitate the<br>
clearance, by the cleaning appliance, of projections presented along the length of the<br>
15 tubular body of the streamer, the positioning and/or guidance devices of the appliance<br>
on the streamer are preferably depfoyable and/or retractable. To this end, the<br>
appliance is preferably equipped with the means to force the positioning and/or<br>
guidance devices to a position pressing onto the outer surface of the streamer, while<br>
also allowing the positioning and/or guidance devices to move away from the outer<br>
20     surface to a position where obstacles are cleared. According to a preferred method of<br>
implementation, the appliance includes a suspension arm supporting the positioning<br>
and/or guidance devices (such as wheels or rollers),as well as a spring for the retum<br>
of the suspension arm. to a position where-the positioning and/or guidance devices.are <br>
pressing onto the outer surface of the streamer.<br>
25                  Other advantages, and characteristics of the invention will be understood by<br>
reading the following description, which refers also to the appended drawings,<br>

In this present application, the terms "front" and "rear" are employed with<br>
15      reference to an imaginary observer located behind the ship, in particular behind the<br>
streamer, and observing the stem of the ship that is towing the streamer.<br>
With reference to figure 1, a streamer 1 is towed by a ship 2 to which it is<br>
attached by means of the drum 3 of a winch fitted to the ship. The streamer is designed<br>
to be used to analyse the structure of the sea bottom 4 by means of the resources (not<br>
20      shown) for processing the signals delivered by the sensors on the streamer. To this<br>
end, it includes a multiplicity of hydrophones 5 attached to a flexible tube 6, a front end<br>
7 of which is attached to the winch, and a rear end 8 which is free.  The streamer is<br>
towed in the direction of the arrow 9 at a speed of approximately 5 knots. The streamer<br>
also includes buoyancy devices 10. attached to the tube 6 in order to hold the streamer<br>
25      at a uniform depth (over its length) and/or constant depth (over time).<br>
As illustrated in particular in figures 2 to 5, the appendages 10 on the streamer<br>
can  include an  upper part  10a acting as a buoyancy device,  a  tower part  10b<br>
approximately diametrically opposite to the upper part 10a, and two lateral parts (vanes<br>
or planes) 10c and 10d extending from the lower part 10b.<br>
30                  On these figures, the streamer deaning device 11 is illustrated in a position in<br>
which it is astride the appendage 10 attached to the tubular body 6 of the streamer.<br>
The tubular body 6 extends along its longitudinal axis 12, the direction 9 of traction of<br>
the streamer being approximately parallel to axis 12. In the position where the cleaning<br>
appliance 11 is astride the streamer, the axis of symmetry 14 of the means for<br>
35      positioning  and  guidance of  the  appliance   is approximately coincident with  the<br><br>
6<br>
longitudinal axis 12 of the tubular part 6 of the streamer. As illustrated in particular in<br>
figures 3 and 7, the appliance 11 presents a general symmetry along a front-to-back<br>
plane 13 containing the axis of symmetry 14 of the positioning and guidance resources.<br>
With reference to figures 2 to 8. the cleaning appliance 11, forming a trolley<br>
5      running along the length of the streamer, includes ;<br>
a chassis 15 consisting of two transverse shackles 16 and 17<br>
connecting two rails 18 and 19 extending parallel to axis 14, as well as<br>
an upper middle structure 20 designed to facilitate the lifting of the<br>
appliance 11;<br>
10                             two hollow longitudinal elements 21 and 22 attached to the upper part of<br>
the chassis 15 by bolts 23 positioned on the outside of the shackles 16<br>
and 17 and used to provide the immersed cleaning appliance 11 with an<br>
apparent mass (or buoyancy potential) of approximately zero and an<br>
approximately constant till;<br>
15                             two bledes 24 positioned at the rear end of the appliance  11  and<br>
intended to cut or knock off large incrustations formed on the outer<br>
surface of the tubular structure 6 of the streamer;<br>
      a pair of front guidance rollers 25, in the form of a diabolo, the profile of<br>
which is complementary to the cylindrical surface 6 of the streamer, and<br>
20                           which are designed to rotate along two axes 27 parallel to the plane of<br>
symmetry  13  and   perpendicular to  axes  12  and  14,   on   arms  29<br>
designed to pivot on rails 18 and 19.;<br>
      two rear positioning and  guidance rollers 26, identical or similar to the<br>
front guidance rollers 25, which are designed to pivot along two axes 28<br>
25                           parallel to plane 13 and to axes 27, on arms which pivot on rafis 18 and<br>
19;<br>
     two intermediate rollers 30, also positioned on either side of plane 13<br>
and symmetrical in relation to the latter, which are held in contact with<br>
the structure 6 by arms fitted with the means of retraction, and attached<br>
30                           to rails 18 and 19. These Intermediate rollers 30 are employed to drive<br>
in rotation, by means of belts or transmission chains 31, two rotating<br>
brushes 32 also positioned symmetrically on either side of plane 13 and<br>
of the longitudinal axis 14 of the appliance ;<br><br>
 7<br>
two structures 33 used to increase the hydrodynamic resistance of the<br>
appliance, which are attached on either side of the latter, symmetrically<br>
in relation to plane 13 and to rsils 18 and 19, by fixing bolts 34.<br>
With reference to figure 9, the device for rotation of the rotating brushes 32<br>
5      along their axis of rotation 41  paraller to from-to-back plane 13 of the appliance,<br>
includes rollers 30 which are driven by friction against the outer surface of the tubular<br>
structure 6 of the streamer, in rotation along their axis 40 parallel to axis 41. The roller<br>
30 pivots on its axis in relation to a yoke 42 which slides along an axis 43 in relation to<br>
a shaft 44, which is fixes to one of rails 18 and 19 of the appliance by means of an<br>
10      attachment element 45 and by means of bolts 49. The yoke 42. acting as a bearing to<br>
the friction roller 30, is held against the outer surface of the streamer 6 by a helical<br>
return spring 46 on axis 43. The brush 32 rotates on its axis 41 between two blades 48<br>
linked by a spacer 47. The elements 47 and 48 used to support the brush 32. the<br>
friction roller 30 and the drive belt of the brush 32 from the roller 30, are designed to<br>
15      move in relation to one of the rails, and form a suspension arm for the roller 30 and the<br>
brush, allowing these elements 30 and 32 to be held against the outer surface of the<br>
streamer. The spring suspension can be enhanced by the addition of a damper 70<br>
connecting the yoke 42 to the element 45 on the chassis. The brush 32 is moved by<br>
the runner 30 by means of a belt (not shown), with a speed of rotation which is greater<br>
20      than that of the runner.<br>
With reference to figure 10, the structure (flared at the front) for the generation<br>
of drag 33 is essentially composed of a metal structure with two parallel blades 50. and<br>
51, which are linked by an incurving element 52, with elements 50 to 52 capable of<br>
being coated by the eurvalure of a metal plate. Each of the blades 50. and/51 is  drilled<br>
25 out with orifices 53 allowing the attachment by bolts 34 of the structure 33 to the one;of<br>
the rails 18 or 19 orf the appliance.<br>
The structure 33 also includes an approximately plane shutter 54 extending<br>
transvereally in relation to the blades 50 and 51 and fixed to the latter by a bolt 55. The<br>
orientation of the shutter 54 in relation to the structure 50 to 52 cart be modified by<br>
30 pivoting the shutter 54 in the direction of the arrow 56 along the axis 57 of the bolt 55.<br>
The structure 33 also includes an approximately conical part 58 forming an extension<br>
to parts 50 to 52, with the conical part 58 itself being extended, as illustrated in<br>
particular by figure 2, by a cylindrical part 59 which is open at its rear end 60.<br>
The transverse section for the passage of water at the front 61 of the cleaning<br>
35      appliance is significantly greater than the intermediate section in the middle part 62 of<br><br>
8<br>
the appliance 33, in particular because of the inclination at the shutter 54 in relation to<br>
axis 14 of the appliance. The section allowing the passage of water is reduced stilf<br>
further in the exit conduit 59 of the structure 33.<br>
Where appropriate, the shutter 54 can be designed to rotate freely on axis 57.<br>
5      its inclination being limited by a return spring (not shown), with the movements of the<br>
shutter possibly being damped with a damping device (not shown).<br>
In the mounted position of the structure 33 onto the appliance 11, the latter<br>
being farced through in the water m the direction of the arrow 9 (figs. 4 to 6) by the<br>
streamer at a speed which is less than that of the streamer because of its motion along<br>
10 the length of the latter, the water is taken in at the front section 61 of the structure 33,<br>
traverses the middle section 62, the conical portion 58 and the cylindrical rear<br>
portion 59, before escaping via the orifice 60. The force exerted by the water on the<br>
appliance 11 and on the structure 33 in particular, causes the cleaning appliance to<br>
move along the streamer, from its front (reference 7, figure 1) to its rear end (reference<br>
15 8, fig.1), where the cleaning appliance 11 can remain pressed against an end-stop<br>
Incorporated into the streamer until completion of a measurement run.<br>
In order to facilitate the placement of the appliance around the front end of the<br>
streamer, before cleaning the latter, the chassis 15 is divided into two parts (left and<br>
right) which  are assembled by the means of an attachment and locking device<br>
20 (reference 80. figure 5) atter engagement of the guidance wheels and the cleaning<br>
tools against the opposite surfaces of the tubular body 6 of the streamer.<br><br>

15      streamer (1,6). characterised in that it includes:<br>
          a tool (24, 32) for cleaning the seismic streamer,<br>
resources (25, 26) for positioning and guidance of the appliance along<br>
the length of the selsmic streamer,<br>
resistant resources (33) which, when the streamer is towed, create a<br>
20                              hydrodynamic drag that is sufficient to overcome the friction forces and<br>
allow the cleaning appliance to move along the length of the seismic<br>
streamer (1, 6).<br>
A.        A cleaning appliance according to clarm 3, which includes the drive<br>
25      resources to operate the clearning tool by movoment of the appliance along the seismic<br>
streamer.<br>
5.         A cleaning appliance according to claim (4) in which the cleaning tool<br>
includes at least 2 brushes, each brush being driven by a rotating roller (30) driven by<br>
30      friction against the seismic streamer (1,6).<br>
6.         A cleaning appliance according to any of claims 3 to 5, which includes a<br>
blade (24) tor removal of the incrustations attached to the seisimic streamer (1, 6),<br><br>
10<br>
7.         A cleaning appliance according to any of claims 3 to 6 in which the<br>
positioning guidance devices of the appliance in relation to the streamer consist of a<br>
pair — and preferably several pairs - of wheels, rollers, runners, or pulleys (25, 26), to<br>
roll or slide at low friction, respectively on two approximately diametrically opposite<br>
5      portions of the outer tubular surface of the seismic streamer.<br>
8.         A cleaning appliance according to any of claims 3 to 7 which also<br>
includes buoyancy resources (21, 22) in order to allow the cleaning appliance to<br>
maintain an approximately constant position during its passage along the length of the<br>
10 towed streamer, and therefore an approximately constant tilt in relation to the<br>
longitudinal axis (12) of the streamer, and to enable the cleaning eppliance to present<br>
an approximately zero buoyancy in order not to interfere with the balance of the<br>
streamer.<br>
15                  9.        A cleaning appliance according to any of claims 3 to 8 in which the<br>
resistant resources consist of two drag structures (33) in the form of a throat, funnel,<br>
deflector or water sock, of approximately identical shape and dimensions, positioned<br>
Symmetrically in relation to a central front-to-back plane (13) and/or in relation to the<br>
guidance axis (14).<br>
20<br>
10, A cleaning appliance according to any of claims 3 to 9 which includes a<br>
drag structure (33) and resources (54, 65) for adjustment of the drag coefficient of the<br>
structure (33).<br>
25                  11. A cleaning appliance according to any of claims 3 to 10, which includes<br>
the means (46, 48, 70) for suspension of resources (25, 26) in relation to the chassis<br>
(15) of the cleaning appliance.<br><br>
The invention concerns a cleaning process for an immersed and towed seismic<br>
streamer (1), characterised in that a cleaning appliance (11), including a tool for cleaning the<br>
seismic streamer, is engaged around the seismic streamer, together with a hydrodyrramic<br>
drag structure which results in the free movement of the cleaning appliance along the length<br>
of the sgismic streamer (1).<br></td>
