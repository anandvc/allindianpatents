POLYMERIZABLE COMPOSITION, RESIN USING SAME, OPTICAL COMPONENT AND<br>
LENS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a polymerizable composition, a resin obtained by polymerizing the polymerizable composition, and an optical component and a lens comprised of the resin.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Inorganic glass has excellent general properties, such as excellent transparency and small optical anisotropy, and thus is used in a wide range of fields as a transparent material.  However, inorganic glass has disadvantages such as that the glass is heavy and susceptible to breakage, and that the productivity is poor in the case of obtaining products by molding and processing the glass. Thus, as a material substituting the inorganic glass, transparent organic polymer materials (optical resins) are being used. Examples of optical components obtained from such optical resins include the lenses of spectacles for vision correction, plastic lenses such as the lenses of photographing equipments such as digital cameras, and the like, which are being put to practical use and gaining popularity.  Particularly, with regard to the use as the lenses of spectacles for vision correction, lenses made of<br>
optical resins are widely used by virtue of features such as that<br>
the resins are lightweight, hard to crack, capable of being dyed,<br>
thus making the lens products highly fashionable, and the like, as<br>
compared to the lenses made of inorganic glass.<br>
[0003]<br>
Conventionally, as the optical resin used in the lenses of spectacles, crosslinked type resins obtained by cast polymerizing diethylene glycol bisallyl carbonate under heating (typically referred to as DAC resins) have been practicalized, and due to the features such as good transparency and heat resistance, and low chromatic aberration, the crosslinked type resins have been most extensively used for the general applications as plastic lenses for spectacles for vision correction.  However, since the plastic lenses have low refractive index (nd = 1.50), their center thickness or the circumference thickness (edge thickness) is increased, thus causing problems such as inferior wear feeling and fashionableness.  Thus, there has been a demand for a resin for plastic lenses having a high refractive index, which can resolve these problems, and development of the resin has been achieved.<br>
[0004]<br>
In such trend, polythiourethane containing a sulfur atom, which is obtained by cast polymerizing a diisocyanate compound and a polythiol compound, has excellent transparency and impact resistance, and has a high refractive index (nd = 1.6 to 1.7), while also realizing very excellent features such as relatively low chromatic aberration.  Thus, polythiourethane has been used in the application of high quality plastic lenses for spectacles for<br>
 vision correction having small thicknesses and light weight.<br>
[0005]<br>
Meanwhile, in the trend pursuing for an optical resin having a higher refractive index, some resins such as a transparent resin obtained by polymerizing a compound having an episulfide group (Patent Document 1, Patent Document 2) or a compound having a thietane group (Patent Document 3), and a resin obtained by polymerizing a Se-containing compound (Patent Document 4) have been proposed.  However, further improvements are desired for the transparent resin obtained by polymerizing a compound having an episulfide group from the aspect of mechanical properties, for the compound having a thietane group from the aspect of polymerizability, and for the resin obtained by polymerizing a compound containing metal such as selenium (Se) from the aspect of further enhancing safety.  Recently, there has been a demand for an optical resin having a higher refractive index, which has the general properties required from plastic lenses (transparency, thermal properties, mechanical properties, and the like) and has a refractive index (nd) of, for example, greater than 1.7, and development of the resin is in progress.  Under such circumstances, a metal-containing thietane compound has been newly discovered, and thus a high refractive index optical resin having a refractive index (nd) of greater than 1.7 has been proposed (Patent Document 5) .<br>
[Patent Document 1] Japanese Patent Laid-open No.H9-110979 [Patent Document 2] Japanese Patent Laid-open No.Hll-322930 [Patent Document 3] Japanese Patent Laid-open No.2003-327583<br>
 [Patent Document 4] Japanese Patent Laid-open No.Hll-140046<br>
[Patent Document 5] WO 2005-095490<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]<br>
The present invention provides a polymerizable composition having the general properties required from optical components such as plastic lenses (transparency, thermal properties, mechanical properties and the like) and providing a very high refractive index (nd) of greater than 1.7, a resin obtained by polymerizing this composition, and optical components and lenses comprised of the resin.

known compound, and is produced according to, for example, the<br>
method described in Patent Document 3 (JP-A No. 2003-327583).<br>
[0081]<br>
The reaction between the halide of the metal atom M represented by the formula (2) and the hydroxyl compound or thiol compound having a thietane group, represented by the formula (3), may be performed without solvent, or may be performed in the presence of a solvent which is inert to the reaction. [0082]<br>
Such solvent is not particularly limited as long as it is a solvent inert to the reaction, and may be exemplified by a hydrocarbon-based solvent such as petroleum ether, hexane, benzene, toluene, xylene or mesitylene;<br>
an ether-based solvent such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or diethylene glycol dimethyl ether;<br>

[0083]<br>
 The temperature for the reaction of the compounds represented<br>
by the formulas (2) and (3) is not particularly limited, but is<br>
typically in the range of -78°C or higher and 200°C or lower, and<br>
preferably -78°C or higher and 100°C or lower.<br>
[0084]<br>
The reaction time is, although affected by the reaction temperature, typically from several minutes to 100 hours.<br>

In the reaction of the compounds represented by the formulas (2) and (3), the amounts of use of the compound represented by the formula (2) and the compound represented by the formula (3) are not particularly limited, but usually, the amount of use of the compound represented by the formula (3) is 0.01 moles or more and 100 moles or less, preferably 0.1 moles or more and 50 moles or less, and more preferably 0.5 moles or more and 20 moles or less, based on 1 mole of the halogen atom contained in the compound represented by the formula (2).<br>
[0086]<br>
Upon performing the reaction of the compounds represented by the formulas (2) and (3), it is preferable to use a basic compound as the scavenging agent for hydrogen halide being generated, in order to perform the reaction efficiently.<br>
Examples of such basic compound include inorganic bases such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, lithium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, lithium bicarbonate, magnesium hydroxide, and calcium hydroxide; and<br>
 organic bases such as pyridine, triethylamine,<br>

undecene.<br>
[0087]<br>
Next, sulfur (elemental sulfur), which is another constitutional requirement of the polymerizable composition according to the invention, will be described.<br>
The elemental sulfur used in the polymerizable composition according to the invention is inorganic sulfur, and the one used in the resin composition according to the invention or in a transparent resin using the resin composition, has a purity of preferably 98% or higher, more preferably 99% or higher, and even more preferably 99.5% or higher.  It may also be preferable to use a method of removing volatile components so as to increase the purity.<br>
[0088]<br>
The properties of the elemental sulfur have no problem if the elemental sulfur is in a form dissolvable in the compound represented by the formula (1) which is another constitutional requirement of the resin composition according to the invention. However, the sulfur is preferably in a powdered state, and more preferably in a finely powdered state.<br>
[0089]<br>
According to the invention, the compound represented by the formula (1) and the elemental sulfur are used in a mixed and dissolved state.  However, as for the amount of addition of the elemental sulfur in the composition, from the viewpoint of high<br>
 refractive index, when the sum of the compound represented by the<br>
formula (1) and the elemental sulfur is taken as 100 parts by<br>
weight, if the amount of addition of the elemental sulfur is too<br>
small, the effect of improving the refractive index may be small,<br>
and it may not be preferable.  Also, when the sum of the compound<br>
represented by the formula (1) and the elemental sulfur is taken<br>
as 100 parts by weight, if the amount of addition of the elemental<br>
sulfur is too large, it may not be preferable from the viewpoint<br>
of turbidity.<br>
[0090]<br>
Therefore, the amount of addition of the elemental sulfur is preferably 5 parts by weight or more and 50 parts by weight or less, when the sum of the compound represented by the formula (1) and the elemental sulfur is set to 100 parts by weight.  More preferably, the amount of addition of the elemental sulfur is 5 parts by weight or more and 25 parts by weight or less, when the sum of the compound represented by the formula (1) and the elemental sulfur is set to 100 parts by weight.<br>
[0091]<br>
According to the invention, as for the method of mixing the compound represented by the formula (1) and the elemental sulfur, for example, it would be favorable that the elemental sulfur is added to the compound represented by the formula (1), and then the mixture is dissolved by stirring; it is a preferable method to increase the temperature as necessary, at that time.  Furthermore, a resin modifying agent or a polymerization catalyst that will be described later, may also be added and dissolved.  All of the<br>
 components may be simultaneously mixed with stirring in the same<br>
vessel, or may be added stepwise and mixed, or some components may<br>
be mixed separately, and then re-mixed in the same vessel.<br>
[0092]<br>
The polymerizable composition of the invention contains the compound represented by the formula (1) and the elemental sulfur, and if necessary, may contain a polymerization catalyst.<br>
[0093]<br>
In this case, it is still acceptable that the plurality of compounds represented by the formula (1) are used in combination as the compound represented by the formula (1).<br>
[0094]<br>
The content of the compound represented by the formula (1) occupying in the total weight of the polymerizable compound included in the polymerizable composition of the invention, is not particularly limited, but is typically 10% by weight or more. Since components other than the compound represented by the formula (1) and the elemental sulfur, which are the constitutional requirements of the invention, often cause a decrease in the refractive index which is a desired effect of the invention, the content is preferably 30% by weight or more, more preferably 50% by weight or more, and even more preferably 70% by weight or more, from the viewpoint of obtaining a resin having a high refractive index.<br>
[0095]<br>
The polymerization catalyst used in the invention as necessary, usually can be cured using the method used in<br>
 polymerizing a known thietane group-containing compound.  The type<br>
or amount of the polymerization catalyst for obtaining a cured<br>
resin, or the type or proportion of the monomer cannot be defined<br>
generally because they vary depending on the structure of the<br>
compound constituting the polymerizable composition, but as for<br>

acids, quaternary ammonium salts, quaternary phosphonium salts,<br>

[0097]<br>
The polymerization catalyst may be used individually or as a mixture of two or more species, and when two or more species having different reactivities among these polymerization catalysts are used in combination, there are cases where the handlability of the monomer, the optical properties, color, transparency and optical inhomogeneity (striation) of the obtained resin are enhanced, thus it being preferable.<br>

The amount of addition of the polymerization catalyst of the polymerizable composition according to the invention is used in the range of 0.0001% by weight or more and 10% by weight or less based on the total weight of the polymerizable composition, and preferably in the range of 0.001% by weight or more and 10% by weight or less, more preferably 0.01% by weight or more and 5% by weight or less, and most preferably 0.01% by weight or more and 1% by weight or less.<br>
When the amount of addition of the polymerization catalyst is set to the above range, production of a better cured resin is possible, the pot life is more certainly maintained, and a resin having better transparency and optical properties may be obtained.<br>
[0100]<br>
The polymerization catalyst may be added directly to the compound described in the present specification, or may also be added after being dissolved or dispersed in another compound, but in some cases, adding the polymerization catalyst after dissolving or dispersing the catalyst in another compound may give preferable results.  Furthermore, in the case of adding the polymerization<br>
 catalyst, preferable results may be obtained if the addition is<br>
performed in a nitrogen atmosphere or in a dry gas atmosphere.  In<br>
order to further enhance the performance of the resulting resin,<br>
preferable results may be obtained if the amount of the unreacted<br>
functional groups remaining in the resin is set to 0.5% by weight<br>
or less, more preferably 0.4% by weight or less, based on the<br>
total weight of the resin.<br>
[0101]<br>

Additionally, in the case where other polymerizable compounds are included in the polymerizable composition of the invention, the lower limit of the<br>

limited.<br>
[0104]<br>
The essential constitutional requirement for the polymerizable composition according to the invention is the polymerizable composition containing the compound represented by the formula (1) and elemental sulfur.<br>
For the purpose of following improvement of the resin obtained by curing the polymerizable composition or following improvement of handlability thereof, it may be preferable to subject the polymerizable composition of the invention to means and operations that are generally used upon synthesizing organic compounds, such as purification or washing, thermal insulation, cold storage, filtration or depressurization treatment, or to add known compounds or the like as stabilizers or resin modifying agents.

[0106]<br>
The method of washing the polymerizable composition is a means used for ameliorating transparency or color of the resin obtained by curing. There may be mentioned a method of washing the polymerizable composition with a polar and/or a non-polar solvent at the time of synthesizing and taking out the polymerizable composition or after taking out the composition after the synthesis, to thereby removing or reducing any materials inhibiting transparency of the resin, for example, the inorganic salts, for example, ammonium salts, which are used or side-produced at the time of synthesizing the polymerizable composition.<br>
 The solvent used herein cannot be defined generally by the<br>
polarity of the polymerizable composition itself or the solution<br>
containing the polymerizable composition to be washed.  However,<br>
the solvent is preferably one capable of dissolving the component<br>
wished to be removed, and hardly compatible with the polymerizable<br>
composition itself or a solution containing the polymerizable<br>
composition to be washed, and the solvent may be used not only as<br>
a single type, but also as a mixture of two or more types.  Here,<br>
the components to be removed may vary depending on the purpose or<br>
the use, but it is preferable to reduce the components as much as<br>
possible, and when adjusted to usually 5000 ppm or less, and more<br>
preferably 1000 ppm or less, good results may be obtained.<br>
[0107]<br>
The method of thermally insulating, cold insulating or<br>
filtering the polymerizable composition is a means used in<br>
ameliorating transparency or color of the resin obtained by curing.<br>
It is general to carry out the method at the time of synthesizing<br>
and taking out the polymerizable composition or after taking out<br>
the composition after the synthesis.  As for the method of thermal<br>
insulation, for example, there may be mentioned a method of<br>
heating and dissolving within the scope of no  impairing the<br>
performance of the polymerizable composition and the resin<br>
obtained by curing the polymerizable composition, in the case<br>
where the polymerizable composition has undergone crystallization<br>
during storage and results in poor handlability.  The temperature<br>
range of heating or the method of heating and dissolving cannot be<br>
defined generally on the basis of the structure of the compound<br>
 constituting the polymerizable composition dealt with, but<br>
typically, the operation is carried out at a temperature of the<br>
freezing temperature+50°C, and preferably within 20°C, and there may be mentioned a method of dissolving while stirring mechanically with a stirring apparatus, or agitating the liquid by bubbling with a gas which is inert to the composition, or the like. As for cold storage, although it is usually performed for the purpose of increasing the storage stability of the polymerizable composition, for example, in the case where the melting point of the polymerizable composition is high, the storage temperature may be considered so as to improve the handlability after crystallization.  The temperature for cold storage cannot be generally defined only on the basis of the structure or storage stability of the compound constituting the polymerizable composition to be dealt with, but typically, it is necessary to carry out the storage at or below a temperature at which the stability of the polymerizable composition containing the compound represented by the formula (1) can be maintained.<br>
[0108]<br>
Furthermore, when the polymerizable composition according to the invention is a polymerizable composition used in optical applications, since the resin obtained from the composition is required to have very high transparency, it is usually preferable to filter the polymerizable composition through a filter having a small pore size.  The pore size of the filter used herein is typically 0.05 urn or greater and 10 urn or less, but upon considering operability or performance, the pore size is<br>
 preferably 0.05 µm or greater and 5 µm or less, and more<br>
preferably 0.1 µm or greater and 5 µm or less.  Good results may be often obtained if the polymerizable composition of the invention is filtered non-exceptionally.  For the temperature of filtering, more preferred results may be obtained if filtering is performed at a low temperature near the freezing point, but in the case where solidification is likely to proceed during filtering, the filtering may be performed at a temperature which does not impede the filtering operation.<br>
[0109]<br>
The depressurization treatment is a means performed generally to eliminate any solvent or dissolved gas which deteriorates the performance of the resin obtained by curing the polymerizable composition, or any foul odor.  Since the dissolved solvent may be generally cause to impair the refractive index or the heat resistance of obtained resin, it is preferable that the dissolved solvent is removed as possible.  The acceptable level of dissolved solvent cannot be generally defined only on the basis of the structure of the compound constituting the polymerizable composition to be dealt with, or the structure of the dissolved solvent, but it is usually preferable to set the level at 1% or lower, and more preferably 5000 ppm or lower.  It is preferable to remove the dissolved gas, from the viewpoint of suppressing the inhibition of polymerization and from the viewpoint of suppressing incorporation of gas bubbles in the resin obtained.  Particularly for the gas meaning moisture, such as steam, it is preferable to remove the gas particularly by bubbling with a dry gas or the like.<br>
 The dissolved amount can be set in accordance with the structure<br>
of the compound constituting the polymerizable composition, and<br>
the properties, structure and type of the dissolved gas.<br>
[0110]<br>
As a representative method for producing the polymerizable composition of the invention, there may be mentioned a method of using the compound represented by the formula (1) and elemental sulfur, and if necessary, the above-described various known polymerizable compounds in combination, further adding the polymerization catalyst as necessary, and then mixing and dissolving them, or the like. [0111]<br>
To performing molding by curing the polymerizable composition of the invention, various materials such as stabilizers, resin modifying agents, chain extending agents, crosslinking agents, photostabilizers as represented by HALS, ultraviolet absorbents as represented by benzotriazoles, antioxidants as represented by hindered phenols, coloration inhibitors, dyes or blueing agents as represented by anthraquinone-based disperse dyes, fillers, external releasing agents as represented by silicones, or internal releasing agents as represented by surfactants such as acidic phosphoric acid esters, quaternary ammonium salts or quaternary phosphonium salts, and adhesiveness improving agents, may be added according to the purpose, in the same manner as in the known molding methods.  Here, the internal releasing agents include those among the above-described various catalysts which exhibit a releasing effect.<br>
 [0112]<br>
The amounts of addition of the various additives that can be added cannot be generally defined since the amounts vary depending on the type, structure and effect of the respective additives, but typically, the additives are used in an amount in the range of 0.001% by weight or more and 10% by weight or less, and preferably in the range of 0.01% by weight or more and 5% by weight or less, based on the total weight of the polymerizable composition.  The dyes are not used in this range, but are preferably used in the range of 1 ppb or more and 100 ppm or less.  Within these ranges, production of cured resin can be achieved more favorably, and the resulting resin may have much better transparency and optical properties. [0113]<br>
Next, the resin according to the invention will be described.<br>
The resin according to the invention and the optical components comprised of the resin are products obtained by polymerizing the polymerizable composition.  As such method, various known methods that are used in the production of plastic lenses may be mentioned, but as a representative example, cast polymerization may be mentioned.<br>
That is, the polymerizable composition of the invention produced by the method described above is subjected to an degassing treatment under reduced pressure or filtration through a filter according to necessity, and then the polymerizable composition is injected into a forming mold, and heated as necessary to perform polymerization.  In this case, it is<br>
 preferable to polymerizing by slowly heating from a low<br>
temperature to a high temperature.<br>
[0114]<br>
The forming mold described above is composed of two casts having mirror surface polished through a gasket made of, for example, polyethylene, an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, polyvinyl chloride or the like interposed therebetween.  The molds consists typically of a combination of glass and glass, and in addition to that, casts of a combination of glass and a plastic sheet, a combination of glass and a metal sheet, or the like may be mentioned, without being limited to these.  The forming mold may also be two sheets of casts fixed by tape such as polyester adhesive tape.  If necessary, a known treatment method such as mold releasing treatment may also be performed on the cast.<br>
[0115]<br>
In the case of performing cast polymerization, the polymerization temperature is not limited since it is affected by the polymerization conditions such as the type of the polymerization initiator, but the temperature is typically -50°C or above and 200°C or below, preferably -20°C or above and 170°C or below, and more preferably 0°C or above and 150°C or below.<br>
[0116]<br>
The polymerization time is affected by the polymerization temperature, but is typically 0.01 hours or more and 200 hours or less, and preferably 0.05 hours or more and 100 hours or less. Furthermore, if necessary, it is also possible to perform polymerization by combining several temperatures such as a<br>
 constant temperature, an elevated temperature or a lowered<br>
temperature.<br>
[0117]<br>
The polymerizable composition of the invention can be polymerized by irradiating the composition with an active energy ray such as an electron beam, ultraviolet rays or visible rays. In this case, if necessary, a radical polymerization catalyst or a cation polymerization catalyst which initiates polymerization under the action of active energy rays is used.<br>
[0118]<br>
The resin thus obtained may be subjected to an annealing treatment after the curing, if necessary.  Furthermore, according to necessity, the resin may be subjected to various known physical or chemical treatments such as surface polishing, antistatic treatment, hard coating treatment, non-reflection coating treatment, dye treatment, photochromatic treatment (for example, lens photochromatization treatment or the like), for the purposes of preventing reflection, imparting high hardness, improving abrasion resistance, imparting anti-fog properties, or imparting stylishness.<br>
[0119]<br>
The obtained resin and the optical lenses formed of this resin may be used after providing coating layers on one surface or on both surfaces, as necessary.  As the coating layer, there may be mentioned a primer layer, a hard coat layer, an anti-reflection coating layer, an anti-fog coating layer, an antifouling layer, a water repellent layer and the like.  These coating layers may be<br>
 used individually alone, or may also be used in the form of<br>
multilayer of a plurality of coating layers.  In the case of<br>
providing coating layers on both surfaces, the same coating layer<br>
may be provided on the respective surfaces, or different coating<br>
layers may be provided.<br>
[0120]<br>
These coating layers may be used in combination of known additives in order to enhance the performance of the lens.  As for the additives, specifically, an ultraviolet absorbent for the purpose of protecting the lens or the eyes from ultraviolet rays;<br>
an infrared absorbent for the purpose of protecting the eyes from infrared rays;<br>
a photostabilizer or antioxidant for the purpose of improving the weather resistance of the lens;<br>
dyes or pigments for the purpose of enhancing stylishness of the lens, and the like may be used, and furthermore, photochromic dyes or photochromic pigments, antistatic agents, and other various additives may also be used.  Also, for the layer formed by coating through application, various leveling agents may be used for the purpose of improving the coatability.<br>
[0121]<br>
The primer layer is typically formed between a hard coat layer that will be described later and an optical lens.  The primer layer is a coating layer provided for the purpose of enhancing the adhesiveness between the hard coat layer formed thereon and the lens, and in some cases, the primer layer can also improve impact resistance.<br>
 [0122]<br>
For the primer layer, any material can be used as long as the material has high adhesiveness toward the optical lens thus obtained, but usually primer compositions containing urethane resins, epoxy resins, polyester resins, melanin resins or polyvinylacetal as the main ingredient are used.  The primer composition may be used with an appropriate solvent which does not exert influence on the lens, for the purpose of adjusting the viscosity of the composition.  Of course, the composition may be used in a solvent-free state.<br>
[0123]<br>
The primer composition can be formed according to any of coating methods and dry methods.  In the case of using a coating method, the composition is applied onto the lens by a known coating method such as spin coating or dip coating, and then solidified to form a primer layer.  In the case of performing a dry method, the primer layer is formed by a known dry method such as CVD or vacuum deposition.  Upon forming the primer layer, the surface of the lens may be subjected, if necessary, to a preliminary treatment such as alkali treatment, plasma treatment or ultraviolet treatment, for the purpose of enhancing the adhesiveness.<br>
[0124]<br>
The hard coat layer is a coating layer intended to impart functions such as crack resistance, abrasion resistance, moisture resistance, hot water resistance, heat resistance or weather resistance, on the lens surface.<br>
 [0125]<br>
For the hard coat layer, in general, a hard coat composition including an organosilicon compound having curability and oxide microparticles containing one element selected from the element group consisting of Si, Al, Sn, Sb, Ta, Ce, La, Fe, Zn, W, Zr, In and Ti, and/or microparticles composed of a complex oxide of two or more elements selected from the above element group.  The oxide microparticles and/or the microparticles composed of a complex oxide may be used individually or in combination of two or more species in the hard coat composition.  It is preferable that the hard coat composition include at least any of amines, amino acids, metal acetylacetonate complexes, organic acid metal salts, perchloric acids, salts of perchloric acids, acids, metal chlorides and polyfunctional epoxy compounds, in addition to the above-described components.  The hard coat composition may employ an appropriate solvent which does not exert influence on the lens. Of course, the composition may be used in a solvent-free state.<br>
[0126]<br>
The hard coat layer is usually formed by applying the hard coat composition by a known coating method such as spin coating or dip coating, and then curing the composition.  As the curing method, there may be mentioned methods such as thermal curing, or curing by irradiation of energy rays such as ultraviolet rays or visible rays.  In order to prevent generation of interference fringe, the refractive index of the hardcoat layer is preferably such that the difference between the refractive index of the hardcoat layer and the refractive index of the lens is in the<br>
 range of ± (plus or minus) 0.1.<br>
[0127]<br>
The anti-reflection layer is usually formed on the hard coat layer according to necessity.  The anti-reflection layer may be classified into inorganic systems and organic systems, and in the case of the inorganic systems, an inorganic oxide such as SiC&gt;2 or TiO2 is employed, and the layer is formed by a dry method such as vacuum deposition, sputtering, ion plating, ion beam assist or CVD. In the case of the organic systems, the layer is formed by a wet method using a composition including an organosilicon compound and silica-based microparticles having internal cavities.<br>
[0128]<br>
The anti-reflection layer may be of a single layer or of , multilayer, and in the case of using a single layer, it is preferable that the refractive index of the anti-reflection layer is lower by at least 0.1 or more, compared to the refractive index of the hard coat layer.  In order to generate the anti-reflection function further effectively, it is preferable to provide a multilayer anti-reflective layer, and in that case, a lower refractive index layer and a high refractive index layer are laminated alternately.  Also in this case, it is preferable that the difference in refractive indices of the low refractive index layer and the high refractive index layer is 0.1 or greater.  The high refractive index layer may be exemplified by layer of ZnO, Ti02, Ce02, Sb205, Sn02, Zr02, Ta205 and the like, while the low refractive index layer may be exemplified by a Si02 layer or the like.<br>
 [0129]<br>
Above the anti-reflection film layer, an anti-fog coating layer, an antifouling layer or a water repellent layer may be formed as necessary.  The method of forming an anti-fog coating layer, an antifouling layer or a water repellent layer is not particularly limited in terms of the treatment method or treated materials, as long as these factors do not bring adverse influence on the function of preventing reflection, and known anti-fog coating treatment method, antifouling treatment method, water repellent treatment method, and materials can be used.<br>
For example, as for the anti-fog coating and antifouling treatment methods, a method of covering the surface with surfactants, a method of forming a hydrophilic film onto the surface to change the surface to water-absorbable, a method of covering the surface with fine unevenness to increase water absorbability, a method of using a photocatalytic activity to change the surface water-absorbable, a method of ultra-water-repellent treatment to prevent attachment of water drops, and the like may be mentioned.<br>
Furthermore, as for the water repellent treatment method, a method of forming a water repellent treated layer by depositing or sputtering a fluorine-containing silane compound or the like, or a method of dissolving a fluorine-containing silane compound in a solvent and then coating the solution to form a water repellent treated layer, may be mentioned.<br>
[0130]<br>
The obtained resin and the optical lens formed of this resin<br>
 may be used after being dyed by using dyes that are appropriate<br>
for the purpose of imparting stylishness or photochromic<br>
properties.  Hereinafter, dyeing of optical lenses will be<br>
illustrated.<br>
[0131]<br>
Dyeing of optical lenses can be performed by known dyeing methods, but usually are performed by several methods that are described below.<br>
(a)	A method of immersing the lens in a dye solution,<br>
(b)	a method of coating the lens by using a coating agent containing a dye, or a method of providing a coating layer capable of being dyed, and dyeing the coating layer,<br>
(c)	a method of incorporating a material capable of being dyed, into a raw material monomer, and polymerizing the monomer, and<br>
(d)	a method of heating a sublimation dye, and allowing the dye to sublime.<br>
[0132]<br>
The method (a) is generally a method of immersing a lens material having a predetermined optical surface, in a dye solution having the dye in use dissolved or uniformly dispersed therein (dyeing process), and then heating the lens to fix the dye as necessary (post-dyeing annealing process).<br>
[0133]<br>
The dye used in the dyeing process is, for example, a known dye, and is not particularly limited, but usually an oil-soluble dye or a disperse dye is used.  The solvent used in the dyeing<br>
 process is not particularly limited if the dye used can be<br>
dissolved or uniformly dispersed therein.<br>
In this dyeing process, surfactants for dispersing the dye in the dye solution, or a carrier for promoting dye uptake may be added as necessary.<br>
[0134]<br>
In the dyeing process, a dye and a surfactant which is added as necessary are dispersed in water or a mixture of water and an organic solvent to prepare a dyeing bath, and an optical lens is immersed in this dyeing bath to perform dyeing at a predetermined temperature for a predetermined time.  The dyeing temperature and time may vary depending on the desired coloration density, but may<br>
be typically 120°C or lower, and from about several minutes to several ten hours.  The dye concentration in the dyeing bath is about 0.01 to 10% by weight.  If dyeing is difficult, the process may be carried out under pressure.  The post-dyeing annealing process which is carried out according to necessity, is a process for performing a heat treatment to the dyed lens material.  The heat treatment is performed such that the water remaining on the surface of the lens material which has been dyed in the dyeing process, is removed using a solvent, or the solvent is blow-dried, and then the lens material is retained in a furnace such as, for example, an infrared heating furnace in an open air atmosphere or a resistance heating furnace, for a predetermined time.  The post-dyeing annealing process prevents decoloration of the dyed lens material (decoloration preventive treatment), and also removes moisture that has penetrated inside the lens material during<br>
 dyeing.<br>
[0135]<br>
The method (b) is not a method of directly dyeing the plastic lens material, but a method of forming a dyed coating layer on the lens surface by applying an organic coating solution having a dye dispersed or dissolved therein, onto a plastic lens, and then subjecting the plastic lens to curing, or a method of forming a dyeable coating layer on the surface of a plastic lens, and then employing the method (a), that is, dyeing the plastic lens by immersing the plastic lens in a dye solution and heating.<br>
[0136]<br>
The method (c) is a method of dissolving a dye in advance in the raw material monomer of the plastic lens, and then performing polymerization. The dye used is not particularly limited as long as it can be uniformly dissolved or dispersed to an extent of not impairing the optical properties, in the raw material monomer.<br>
[0137] Examples of the method (d) include the following (dl) to (d3).<br>
(dl) A method of dyeing a plastic lens by subliming a solid sublimation dye,<br>
(d2) a method of facing a substrate formed by applying a solution containing a sublimation dye, to a plastic lens in a non-contact manner, and heating the substrate and the lens to achieve dyeing, and<br>
(d3) a method of transferring a transfer layer including a coloring layer containing a sublimation dye and an adhesive layer, onto a plastic lens, and then heating the plastic lens to achieve<br>
 dyeing.<br>
The resin of the invention and the optical lens formed of this resin may be dyed by any method.  The dye used is not particularly limited as long as it is a dye having sublimability. [0138]<br>
The resin cured products and optical components obtained by polymerizing the polymerizable composition of the invention have high transparency, good heat resistance and mechanical strength, while having high refractive indices (nd) exceeding 1.7. [0139]<br>
As the optical components according to the invention, there may be mentioned, for example, various plastic lenses such as lenses for spectacle for vision correction, lenses for photographing instruments, Fresnel lenses for liquid crystal projectors, lenticular lenses, and contact lenses;<br>
sealing materials for light emitting diodes (LED);<br>
waveguides;<br>
optical adhesives used in bonding optical lenses or waveguides;<br>
anti-reflection films used in optical lenses;<br>
transparent coating or transparent substrates used in the liquid crystal display apparatus members such as substrates, light guide plates, films and sheets; and the like.<br>
[0140]<br>
As such, the resin obtained by polymerizing the polymerizable compound of the invention has high transparency, good heat resistance and mechanical strength, while having a high refractive<br><br>
index (nd) exceeding 1.7, and thus is useful as a resin used in<br>
optical components such as,   for  example, plastic lenses.  The<br>
polymerizable composition of the invention is also useful, for<br>
example, as a raw material monomer composition for transparent<br>
resins having very high refractive indices.<br>
