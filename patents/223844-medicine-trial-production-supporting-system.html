				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a medicine prototype<br>
support system and method for supporting product<br>
information and ingredient transaction between a product<br>
manufacturer and an ingredient manufacturer, for example,<br>
a medicine prototype support system and method for<br>
supporting a transaction between a product manufacturer<br>
of a composition formed by one main active and other<br>
ingredients, such as health food, other food, cosmetics,<br>
etc. especially medicines and a manufacturer of an<br>
ingredient forming part of a composition.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Conventionally, a composition product manufacturer<br>
(hereinafter referred to as a product manufacturer, for<br>
example, a pharmaceutical company) is mainly engaged in<br>
manufacturing the main ingredient (for example, an efficacy<br>
ingredient) of the composition, and requests a composition<br>
ingredient manufacturer (hereinafter referred to as an<br>
ingredient manufacturer) to manufacture and provide other<br>
composition ingredients (for example, an excipient for<br>
forming a tablet appropriate for the efficacy ingredient)<br>
appropriate for the main ingredient.<br>
In this case, it is rare that a user is informed of<br>
the optimum composition ingredient for a predetermined<br>
efficacy ingredient from the beginning, and a product<br>
manufacturer selects the optimum composition ingredient<br>
based on the manufacture of a sample product and its<br>
evaluation from a combination of a plurality of composition<br>
ingredients regarded as candidates. However, it is<br>
necessary to accumulate the knowledge of various<br>
composition ingredients and a composition manufacturing<br>
method using them for the combination of the optimum main<br>
ingredient with other composition ingredients, and it is<br>
not always easy for a product manufacturer.<br>
For example, the contents of a process of exchanging<br>
information among a product manufacturer, an ingredient<br>
manufacturer, and a contract composition manufacturer<br>
(hereinafter referred to as a composition manufacturer)<br>
are practically explained below by referring to Figure 1.<br> When a product manufacturer manufactures a new<br>
medicine, the manufacturer asks the ingredient manufacturer<br>
about the information about the properties, etc. of the<br>
necessary composition ingredients a, b, c, ... for the<br>
manufacture.<br> The ingredient manufacturer checks the<br>
information about the asked composition ingredient, and<br>
presents (returns as an answer) the information to the<br>
product manufacturer.<br> The product manufacturer prepares a sample, and<br>
evaluates it. When a better evaluation cannot be obtained,<br>
the processes  to  are repeated.<br> The finally determined ingredient is indicated<br>
as a composition ingredient to be purchased to the ingredient<br>
manufacturer.<br> The ingredient manufacturer sells the indicated<br>
ingredient to the product manufacturer.<br> The product manufacturer delivers the purchased<br>
ingredient to the composition manufacturer, discloses the<br>
prescription, and commits production of the product.<br> The composition manufacturer performs contract<br>
manufacture.<br> A manufactured product is supplied to the product<br>
manufacturer.<br>
A product manufacturer has to repeatedly exchange<br>
information with an ingredient manufacturer and a<br>
composition manufacturer, and it has been the problem to<br>
be solved that a laborious job is to be performed in<br>
exchanging information for manufacture of a product.<br>
Especially, when a new medicine is developed, it has been<br>
difficult to request an external organization to develop<br>
it while maintaining the security of the main ingredient<br>
(important ingredient) of the medicine to be developed.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The embodiments of the present invention are described<br>
below in detail by referring to the attached drawings.<br>
Figure 2 shows the entire configuration of the medicine<br>
prototype support system applicable to the embodiment<br>
described later. In Figure 2, a computer system 100<br>
(hereinafter referred to simply as a system) used by a product<br>
manufacturer and has a communications server 101 and one<br>
or more clients 102 LAN-connected to the communications<br>
server 101. The communications server 101 transfers the<br>
information transmitted from the client 102 to the<br>
ingredient manufacturer system 200. The client 102 can<br>
use a personal computer, etc. , and is loaded with software<br>
for electronic mail and a browser for browsing a home page<br>
(an HTML document, etc.). The client 102 inputs the<br>
information to be transmitted to the client of another system<br>
described later, and displays the information received from<br>
another system.<br>
An ingredient manufacturer system 200 has a<br>
communications server 201 and a plurality of clients 202<br>
LAN-connected to the communications server 201. The<br>
functions of the communications server 201 and the clients<br>
202 can be considered to be the same as those of the<br>
above-mentioned communications server 101 and the client<br>
102. The communications server 201 stores in the internal<br>
storage device, for example, in the hard disk storage device<br>
the information (generally called property information)<br>
to be presented to the product manufacturer including<br>
properties, etc. depending on the type of a composition<br>
ingredient.<br>
Furthermore, the communications server 201 is loaded<br>
with an estimating program for calculation of a manufacture<br>
price and a manufacture condition according to the<br>
information about the type and amount, etc. of a composition<br>
ingredient. Furthermore, the communications server 201<br>
is loaded with a program for a read of the accumulated<br>
information accumulated in the communications server<br>
(described later) of a composition manufacturer.<br>
In an estimating program, a calculating expression for<br>
a manufacture cost using the quantity as a parameter is<br>
predetermined for each type of composition ingredient. By<br>
the calculating expression, a manufacture cost can be<br>
calculated in the program. Since a program for remotely<br>
reading accumulated information (what is called data of<br>
a database) is marketed, a commonly marketed program can<br>
be used.<br>
A composition manufacturer system 300 has a<br>
communications server 301 and a plurality of clients 302<br>
LAN-connected to the communications server 301. The<br>
functions of the communications server 301 and the clients<br>
302 can be considered to be similar to those of the<br>
communications server 101 and the client 102. However,<br>
the storage device of the composition manufacturer system<br>
300 is loaded with a well-known database management program<br>
for offering accumulated information at an inquiry of<br>
accumulated information, that is, a query (retrieval<br>
request) from the ingredient manufacturer system 200 . The<br>
accumulated information refers to the information relating<br>
to the properties of the composition (possibly including<br>
the entire product) obtained by combining a plurality of<br>
composition ingredients and the manufacture condition (the<br>
above two pieces of information can be generally called<br>
composition information).<br>
A communications network 400 is a communications<br>
network which can be connected to the systems 100 to 300.<br>
For example, any well-known communications network can be<br>
used regardless of a dedicated telephone line called the<br>
Internet, wireless, or cable.<br>
(First Embodiment)<br>
The procedure of the first embodiment is explained by<br>
referring to Figure 3.<br>
(process 1)<br>
The staff of product manufacture of a product<br>
manufacturer inputs a written request from the client 102,<br>
that is, a written request ( shown in Figure 3) for<br>
providing a product composition to attain the desired<br>
properties of the product X including a manufactured main<br>
ingredient X1 and a manufacturing method, and transmits<br>
it to the ingredient manufacturer system 200. A request<br>
item from the product manufacturer can be the designation<br>
of the main ingredient X1, a desired item and value of a<br>
product, and also product style, a desired product cost,<br>
the restrictions on the manufacture condition, the<br>
restrictions on a used ingredient, etc.<br>
When the main ingredient X1 is generally difficult to<br>
acquire, it is necessary for a product manufacturer to<br>
provide the main ingredient XI for an ingredient<br>
manufacturer. In some cases, a substance similar to the<br>
main ingredient X1 is provided,<br>
(process 2)<br>
A sales staff of an ingredient manufacturer receives<br>
a written request at the clients 202 through the<br>
communications server 201. The sales staff inputs uses<br>
the clients 202 and inputs a retrieval request about the<br>
composition ingredient relating to the main ingredient<br>
described in the written request ( shown in Figure 3)<br>
and acquires the information (composition information)<br>
about the main ingredient XI accumulated in the<br>
communications server 301 of the composition manufacturer<br>
system 300 or various product composition formed by the<br>
ingredient similar in properties to it, and the properties<br>
and the manufacture condition attained by them ( shown<br>
in Figure 3). Furthermore, the product composition<br>
containing the composition ingredient X2 manufactured by<br>
the ingredient manufacturer and the manufacture condition<br>
are obtained according to the accumulated information in<br>
the communications server 301. Additionally, the<br>
information about the properties, etc. of a product is<br>
obtained from the accumulated information in its own<br>
communications server 201 or the communications server 301<br>
of the composition manufacturer system 300 of the<br>
composition manufacturer. Thus, the properties of an<br>
estimated product are determined. Then, the sales staff<br>
inputs information (information about composition<br>
ingredient, quantity, etc. ) for estimation from the clients<br>
202 , uses an estimating program of the communications server<br>
201, and calculates the manufacture cost, and the product<br>
cost. When the product has legal restrictions on a<br>
substance available as a composition ingredient as<br>
medicines, the composition and the production cost should<br>
be determined within the range of the restrictions,<br>
(process 3)<br>
The information about the determined estimated product<br>
property and production cost is input from the clients 202,<br>
and transmitted to the client 102 of the staff of product<br>
manufacture of the product manufacturer through the<br>
communications servers 201 and 101 ( shown in Figure<br>
3).<br>
(process 4)<br>
The staff of product manufacture considers the<br>
transmitted estimated product property and sales cost to<br>
prepare a written request for prototype manufacture. A<br>
written request for prototype manufacture ( shown in<br>
Fig.3) is input from the client 102, and transmitted to<br>
the clients 202 of the sales staff of the ingredient<br>
manufacturer through the communications servers 101 and<br>
201. The sales staff transfers a written request for<br>
prototype manufacture to the clients 302 through the<br>
communications servers 201 and 301.<br>
At this time, the ingredient manufacturer discloses<br>
the product composition and the manufacture condition to<br>
the composition manufacturer. For example, the ingredient<br>
manufacturer provides the information about the main<br>
ingredient XI and another composition ingredient X2 for<br>
the composition manufacturer. Thus, when the ingredient<br>
manufacturer requests the composition manufacturer to<br>
manufacture a prototype, it is desired that a confidential<br>
contract is made between the ingredient manufacturer and<br>
the composition manufacturer on the product composition,<br>
the manufacture condition, etc. Furthermore, when an<br>
ingredient manufacturer can manufacture a prototype, the<br>
manufacture department, etc. belonging to the ingredient<br>
manufacturer has the function of the composition<br>
manufacturer in figure 3.<br>
(process 5)<br>
The composition manufacturer receives a request to<br>
manufacture a prototype, manufactures it, and delivers it<br>
to the ingredient manufacturer (refer to the dotted line<br>
shown in Figure 3).<br>
(process 6)<br>
The ingredient manufacturer measures the properties<br>
of the prototype. In some cases, the composition<br>
manufacturer measures the property values of the prototype,<br>
and can deliver the prototype including the information.<br>
The process 6 in this case is performed by the composition<br>
manufacturer.<br>
(process 7)<br>
The ingredient manufacturer provides a prototype for<br>
a product manufacturer (refer to the dotted line shown in<br>
Figure 3. ) . The information ( shown in Figure 3) about<br>
the (measured) properties of the prototype is transmitted<br>
from the clients 202 of the sales staff of the ingredient<br>
manufacturer to the client 102 of the product manufacturer.<br>
At this time, it is noticeable that the information about<br>
the composition and the manufacturing method are not<br>
disclosed. If a prototype is analyzed, and the composition<br>
and the manufacture condition are easily estimated, it is<br>
necessary to take action like a contract etc. not to analyze<br>
the product composition between the product manufacturer<br>
and the ingredient manufacturer,<br>
(process 8)<br>
The product manufacturer measures the properties of<br>
the provided prototype, and determines whether or not the<br>
disclosure of the information about the composition and<br>
manufacture condition of prototype is required (the<br>
disclosure of the information about the composition and<br>
the manufacture condition of a prototype is requested).<br>
Then, the result is transmitted to the clients 202 as a<br>
sales staff of the ingredient manufacturer (refer to <br>
shown in Figure 3).<br>
(process 9)<br>
When the ingredient manufacturer receives a<br>
notification from the manufacture staff of the product<br>
manufacturer that the information is to be disclosed, the<br>
sales staff discloses the information by transmitting the<br>
information about the product composition and the<br>
manufacture condition of a prototype from the clients 202<br>
to the client 102.<br>
When the product manufacturer manufactures a product,<br>
the order (manufacture request as indicated by  shown<br>
in Figure 3) of the composition ingredient X2 sold by the<br>
ingredient manufacturer is made from the client 102 of the<br>
manufacture staff to the clients 202 as the sales staff.<br>
The ingredient manufacturer receives the order, and<br>
manufactures the composition ingredient X2, or sells it<br>
when there is the ingredient in stock. When the product<br>
manufacturer does not manufacture the product, it can be<br>
committed on the composition manufacturer. The commission<br>
can be performed through an online operation.<br>
The prototype is provided and the payment and the<br>
reception of the price for the related information, etc.<br>
occur at any time depending on each style. For example,<br>
before starting the manufacture of a prototype, an estimated<br>
property value and a sales cost are presented to the product<br>
manufacturer, and the payment and reception of the price<br>
for the preparation of a prototype can occur. Furthermore,<br>
when the property information and manufacturing method<br>
information are to be purchased after presenting a prototype,<br>
the payment and reception of the price also occur.<br>
Additionally it is natural that the exchange of the price<br>
for the manufacture of a prototype occurs between the product<br>
manufacturer and the ingredient manufacturer.<br>
These prices can be processed online (that is,<br>
accounting process). Practically, the communications<br>
server 101 of the product manufacturer system performs the<br>
process of transferring the amount set in advance to the<br>
bank account of the ingredient manufacturer each time<br>
necessary information is received from the ingredient<br>
manufacturer system 200. The payment of a fund can be<br>
performed by a bank transfer or using electronic money,<br>
etc.<br>
The practical communications method according to the<br>
first embodiment is briefly explained below.<br>
Various communicating means such as electronic mail,<br>
file transfer (FTP), etc. can be used for the communications<br>
of the information among the staffs of the product<br>
manufacturer, the ingredient manufacturer, and the<br>
composition manufacturer.<br>
It is not necessary that the above-mentioned staffs<br>
are the same persons, but can be any appropriate persons<br>
in the sales, development, manufacture, and other<br>
departments as proxy agent.<br>
The information input means of the clients 102 and 202<br>
can be a keyboard, a floppy disk (registered trademark),<br>
other storage devices, communications devices for inputting<br>
information from other devices through communications, etc.<br>
The information output means of the clients 102 and<br>
202 can be a printer, a floppy disk (registered trademark) ,<br>
other storage devices, communications devices for<br>
outputting information through communications, etc.<br>
(Second Embodiment)<br>
The above-mentioned first embodiment has the novelty<br>
in an ingredient manufacturer obtaining the accumulated<br>
information about the system of the composition<br>
manufacturer, and providing the product manufacturer with<br>
the information desired by the product manufacturer. While<br>
the load of the product manufacturer is reduced, the<br>
information inputting operation of the ingredient<br>
manufacturer increases. Therefore, the manual operation<br>
of the ingredient manufacturer can be automated in the second<br>
embodiment as described below.<br>
In this embodiment, an HTML document for display of<br>
the screen for input on the product manufacturer side to<br>
the communications server 201 of the ingredient<br>
manufacturer and the screen (information output screen)<br>
for display of the information received from the ingredient<br>
manufacturer is stored. The client 102 on the product<br>
manufacturer side uses a browser and displays the HTML<br>
document (information input screen) on the display screen<br>
of the client 102. On the information input screen, the<br>
main ingredient and the ingredient information about other<br>
composition ingredients shown in Figure 3 (), the<br>
prototype manufacture request (), a request to disclose<br>
the prototype manufacture condition, etc. (), and a<br>
manufacture request () are input.<br>
The staff of the ingredient manufacturer uses the<br>
browser of the clients 202 and displays the input screen<br>
to confirm the input information on the product manufacturer<br>
side. Upon receipt of the main ingredient and the<br>
ingredient information about other composition ingredient,<br>
the communications server 201 automatically activates an<br>
estimating program, estimates a sales cost, and displays<br>
the result on the information output screen.<br>
The process of retrieving necessary information from<br>
the accumulated information of the composition manufacturer<br>
system 300 can also be automatically performed by a database<br>
retrieval program.<br>
The estimated product property can be generated by a<br>
dedicated program by combining the information obtained<br>
from the composition manufacturer system 300 with the<br>
accumulated information about the ingredient manufacturer<br>
system 200, processing the result, and displaying it on<br>
the information output screen.<br>
Furthermore, the accumulated information accumulated<br>
in the composition manufacturer system 300 and the<br>
information relating to the composition accumulated by the<br>
ingredient manufacturer can be accumulated in the<br>
accumulation means in the ingredient manufacturer system<br>
200 of the ingredient manufacturer, for example, in a hard<br>
disk so that the information relating to the composition<br>
can be retrieved from the accumulation means and used<br>
(corresponding to the invention according to claim 5).<br>
In the composition manufacturer system ingredient<br>
manufacturer system 200 in the embodiment above, the<br>
information about the properties of the composition<br>
ingredient is accumulated, but the main ingredient<br>
information or other composition ingredient information<br>
or both of them can be used as a query for retrieval of<br>
the accumulated information.<br>
The above-mentioned program can be easily prepared by<br>
those skilled in the art based on the explanation of the<br>
specifications.<br>
In the concepts of the product manufacturer, the<br>
ingredient manufacturer, the composition manufacturer, a<br>
proxy agent, for example, a trading company can be included.<br>
The third embodiment of the present invention is<br>
explained below by referring to the attached drawings.<br>
Figure 4 shows the entire configuration of the medicine<br>
(pharmaceutical) prototype support system applicable to<br>
the embodiment described later. In Figure 4, the computer<br>
system 100 used by a product manufacturer (hereinafter<br>
referred to simply as a product manufacturer system), and<br>
includes main ingredient information about medicines so<br>
that new medicines can be developed. Normally, the product<br>
composition contained in the medicines contains the<br>
important ingredient having efficacy (main ingredient) and<br>
composition ingredient having no efficacy but required in<br>
preparing and designing medicines. The product<br>
manufacturer system has a communications server 101 and<br>
one or more client 102 LAN-connected to the communications<br>
server 101. The communications server 101 transfers the<br>
information transmitted from the client 102 to the<br>
ingredient manufacturer system 200. The client 102 can<br>
use a personal computer, etc. , and is loaded with a browser<br>
for browsing electronic mail software, a home page (HTML<br>
document, etc.). The client 102 inputs information to be<br>
transmitted to the client of other systems described later,<br>
and displays the information received from other systems.<br>
The ingredient manufacturer system 200 is an ingredient<br>
manufacturer system used by an ingredient manufacturer,<br>
and comprises a communications server 201 and a plurality<br>
of clients 202 LANN-connected to the communications server<br>
201. The functions of the communications server 201 and<br>
the clients 202 are considered to be similar to those of<br>
the communications server 101 and the 102. In the<br>
communications server 201, the internal storage device such<br>
as a hard disk storage device stores the information<br>
(generally referred to as property information) to be<br>
provided for the product manufacturer such as the properties<br>
depending on the type of composition ingredient and the<br>
manufacturing method (product process information) of the<br>
composition manufacturer, the information relating to the<br>
incompatibility between the main ingredient and the<br>
composition ingredient, and the information about the<br>
optimum composition ingredient for the product process<br>
information as a database (composition ingredient<br>
determination means, information conversion means).<br>
The communications server 201 is loaded with an<br>
estimating program for calculation of the manufacture price<br>
and manufacture condition according to the information<br>
about the type and amount of composition ingredient, etc.<br>
An estimating program can be designed to calculate the<br>
manufacture cost by the calculation expression obtained<br>
by predetermining a calculation expression for the<br>
manufacture cost using the quantity as a parameter for each<br>
type of composition ingredient.<br>
Systems 310, 320, 330, . . . are used by a plurality of<br>
composition manufacturers, and comprise communications<br>
servers 311, 321, 331, . . . , and a plurality of clients 312 ,<br>
322, 332 LAN-connected to the communications servers 311,<br>
321, 331, .... The functions of the communications servers<br>
311, 321, and 331 and the clients 312, 322, and 332 are<br>
similar to those of the communications server 101 and the<br>
client 102.<br>
A communications network 400 capable of connecting the<br>
systems 100 to 330, and can use a well-known communications<br>
network for example, a dedicated telephone line called the<br>
Internet and regardless of wireless or cable.<br>
(Third Embodiment)<br>
The procedure according to the third embodiment is<br>
explained by referring to Figure 4.<br>
(process 1)<br>
The staff of product manufacture of a product<br>
manufacturer inputs a written request from the client 102,<br>
that is, a written request ( shown in Figure 4) for<br>
providing a product composition to attain the desired<br>
properties of the product X including a manufactured main<br>
ingredient XI and a manufacturing method, and transmits<br>
it to the ingredient manufacturer system 200 through the<br>
server 101. A request item from the product manufacturer<br>
can be the designation of the main ingredient X1, a desired<br>
Item and value of a product, and also product style, a desired<br>
product cost, the restrictions on the manufacture condition,<br>
the restrictions on a used ingredient, etc.<br>
When it is generally hard for an ingredient manufacturer<br>
to obtain the main ingredient XI, it is necessary for a<br>
product manufacturer to provide the main ingredient XI for<br>
an ingredient manufacturer. When it is impossible to<br>
externally offer an ingredient under a development stage,<br>
a substance similar in properties to the main ingredient<br>
XI is provided, or the property information necessary in<br>
designing medicines can be provided although designation<br>
of the main ingredient XI cannot be specified. Furthermore,<br>
a request for a style (placebo) in which preparation and<br>
design can be performed only using the composition<br>
ingredient excluding the main ingredient XI from the<br>
medicines X. They are different in request cost relating<br>
to the manufacture of a prototype because they are related<br>
to the disclosure of confidential information, difficulty<br>
in preparation and design, and the development speed,<br>
(process 2)<br>
A sales staff of an ingredient manufacturer receives<br>
a written request at the clients 202 through the<br>
communications server 201. The sales staff inputs uses<br>
the clients 202 and inputs a retrieval request about the<br>
composition ingredient relating to the medicine X described<br>
in the written request for the communications server 201<br>
( shown in Figure 4). The composition information<br>
database in the communications server 201 of the ingredient<br>
manufacturer system 200 stores the main ingredient XI and<br>
the main ingredient X11 similar to the main ingredient XI,<br>
various composition manufacture information including the<br>
composition ingredient X2 manufactured by the ingredient<br>
manufacturer, and information (composition information)<br>
relating to the preparing manufacture condition using the<br>
properties attained by them, the main ingredient XI and<br>
X11 ( shown in Figure 4) . Then, the optimum composition<br>
ingredient X2 related to the XI information can be detected.<br>
Thus, the properties of an estimated product are determined.<br>
Then, the sales staff inputs information (information about<br>
composition ingredient, quantity, etc. ) for estimation from<br>
the clients 202, uses an estimating program of the<br>
communications server 201, and calculates the prototype<br>
manufacture cost, and the product cost. To calculate the<br>
cost, a cost calculation database is prepared depending<br>
on the prototype development speed, the difficulty in<br>
pharmaceutical designing, and the security of the main<br>
ingredient. When the product has legal restrictions on<br>
a substance available as a composition ingredient as<br>
medicines, the composition and the production cost should<br>
be determined within the range of the restrictions.<br>
(process 3)<br>
The information about the determined estimated product<br>
properties, the prototype product cost, and the production<br>
cost is input from the clients 202, and transmitted to the<br>
client 102 of the staff of product manufacture of the product<br>
manufacturer through the communications servers 201 and<br>
101 ( shown in Figure 4).<br>
(process 4)<br>
The staff of product manufacture considers the<br>
transmitted estimated product property and sales cost to<br>
prepare a written request for prototype manufacture. A<br>
written request for prototype manufacture ( shown in<br>
Fig.4) is input from the client 102, and transmitted to<br>
the clients 202 of the sales staff of the ingredient<br>
manufacturer through the communications servers 101 and<br>
201.<br>
(process 5)<br>
The sales staff of the ingredient manufacturer<br>
appropriately divides the prototype manufacture process,<br>
and generates a written request for prototype manufacture<br>
for each of the divided processes, assigns the written<br>
request for prototype manufacture to a plurality of<br>
composition manufacturers, and transmits the written<br>
request for prototype manufactures to the clients 312 , 322,<br>
and 332 of the staffs of the composition manufacturers<br>
through the communications servers 201, 311, 321, and 331<br>
( shown in Figure 4).<br>
At this time, the ingredient manufacturer discloses<br>
a necessary product composition and its manufacture<br>
condition for each process. The important point is that<br>
the information about the main ingredient XI is not disclosed,<br>
but the main ingredient X'l is disclosed depending on the<br>
confidential rank and the main ingredient X"l obtained by<br>
information converting the main ingredient XI or the main<br>
ingredient X' 1 obtained by the information conversion means<br>
can be disclosed. The information conversion means is<br>
contained in the system of the ingredient manufacturer,<br>
and the main ingredient XI information cannot be estimated<br>
from the main ingredient XI information whose<br>
confidentiality to be maintained, or there is a database<br>
(information conversion database) for conversion into<br>
hardly estimated main ingredient X'l and main ingredient<br>
X" 1. An example of the conversion can be, in the preparation<br>
development using a verapamil hydrochloride (XI) which is<br>
a vasoconstrictor, dilazep hydrochloride (X'l) is selected.<br>
The dilazep hydrochloride as well as verapamil<br>
hydrochloride is a vasoconstrictor, and is selected because<br>
it indicates a similar solubility level "sparingly soluble" .<br>
From the similarity in solubility which is the main factor<br>
affecting the particle-generating process in the preparing<br>
process, the acetaminophen (X"l) which is an antifebrile<br>
is selected. It is impossible to estimate the development<br>
of the verapamil hydrochloride from the acetaminophen.<br>
For example, the ingredient manufacturer offers the<br>
information about other composition ingredients including<br>
the main ingredient X'l and composition ingredient X2 for<br>
the composition manufacturer including the communications<br>
server 311. The ingredient manufacturer discloses to the<br>
composition manufacturer having the communications server<br>
321 the properties (does not disclose the information about<br>
the main ingredient X'1) required in the manufacturing<br>
process of the process 2 prototype X requested by the<br>
composition manufacturer having the communications server<br>
321 relating to the process 1 prototype X prepared from<br>
other composition ingredients including the main ingredient<br>
X'l and the composition ingredient X2. Furthermore, the<br>
ingredient manufacturer discloses the information about<br>
the process 2 prototype X and requests the composition<br>
manufacturer having the 331 to manufacture a prototype X.<br>
The servers 311, 321, and 331 perform a monitoring operation<br>
not to make double requests to generate a prototype in the<br>
same process. For example, assume that a particle is<br>
generated using the main ingredient X'l and other<br>
composition ingredients containing the composition<br>
ingredient X2, and a process 1 prototype X is obtained.<br>
Using the process 1 prototype X, a tablet is generated as<br>
a process 2 prototype X. The coated tablet obtained by<br>
coating the process 2 prototype X is a process 3 prototype<br>
X.<br>
When the ingredient manufacturer requests the<br>
composition manufacturer to manufacture a prototype, it<br>
is desired that the ingredient manufacturer makes a security<br>
contract in advance relating to the product composition,<br>
manufacture condition, etc. with the composition<br>
manufacturer although it is guaranteed that the information<br>
related to the main ingredient XI can be protected against<br>
disclosure to the composition manufacturer. Furthermore,<br>
an ingredient manufacturer can also manufacture a prototype.<br>
In this case, the manufacturing department, etc. belonging<br>
to the ingredient manufacturer functions as a composition<br>
manufacturer as shown in Figure 4. Furthermore, the costs<br>
for generating a process 1 prototype X, a process 2 prototype<br>
X, and a process 3 prototype X are determined,<br>
(process 6)<br>
The composition manufacturer receives a request to<br>
manufacture a prototype, manufactures it, and delivers it<br>
to the ingredient manufacturer (refer to the dotted lines<br>
a, b, and c shown in Figure 4).<br>
(process 7)<br>
The ingredient manufacturer measures the properties<br>
of the prototypes (process 1 prototype X, process 2 prototype<br>
X, and process 3 prototype X). In some cases, the<br>
composition manufacturer measures the property values of<br>
the prototype, and can deliver the prototype including the<br>
information. The process 6 in this case is performed by<br>
the composition manufacturer,<br>
(process 8)<br>
The ingredient manufacturer provides a prototype for<br>
a product manufacturer (refer to the dotted line shown in<br>
Figure 4. ) . The information ( shown in Figure 4) about<br>
the (measured) properties of the prototype is transmitted<br>
from the clients 202 of the sales staff of the ingredient<br>
manufacturer to the client 102 of the product manufacturer.<br>
At this time, it is noticeable that the information about<br>
the composition and the manufacturing method are not<br>
disclosed. If a prototype is analyzed, and the composition<br>
and the manufacture condition are easily estimated, it is<br>
necessary to take action like a contract etc. not to analyze<br>
the product composition between the product manufacturer<br>
and the ingredient manufacturer,<br>
(process 9)<br>
The product manufacturer measures the properties of<br>
the provided prototype, and determines whether or not the<br>
disclosure of the information about the composition and<br>
manufacture condition of prototype is required (the<br>
disclosure of the information about the composition and<br>
the manufacture condition of a prototype is requested).<br>
Then, the result is transmitted to the clients 202 as a<br>
sales staff of the ingredient manufacturer (refer to <br>
shown in Figure 4).<br>
(process 10)<br>
When the ingredient manufacturer receives a<br>
notification from the manufacture staff of the product<br>
manufacturer that the information is to be disclosed, the<br>
sales staff discloses the information by transmitting the<br>
information about the product composition and the<br>
manufacture condition of a prototype from the clients 202<br>
to the client 102.<br>
When the product manufacturer manufactures a product,<br>
the order (manufacture request as indicated by  shown<br>
in Figure 4) of the composition ingredient X2 sold by the<br>
ingredient manufacturer is made from the client 102 of the<br>
manufacture staff to the clients 202 as the sales staff.<br>
The ingredient manufacturer receives the order, and<br>
manufactures the composition ingredient X2, or sells it<br>
when there is the ingredient in stock. When the product<br>
manufacturer does not manufacture the product, it can be<br>
committed on the composition manufacturer. The commission<br>
can be performed through an online operation.<br>
The prototype is provided and the payment and the<br>
reception of the price for the related information, etc.<br>
occur at any time depending on each style. For example,<br>
before starting the manufacture of a prototype, the<br>
estimated property value and a sales cost are presented<br>
to the product manufacturer, and the payment and reception<br>
of the price for the preparation of a prototype can occur.<br>
Furthermore, when the property information and<br>
manufacturing method information are to be purchased after<br>
presenting a prototype, the payment and reception of the<br>
price also occur. Additionally it is natural that the<br>
exchange of the price for the manufacture of a prototype<br>
occurs between the product manufacturer and the ingredient<br>
manufacturer.<br>
These prices can be processed online (that is,<br>
accounting process). Practically, the communications<br>
server 101 of the product manufacturer system performs the<br>
process of transferring the amount set in advance to the<br>
bank account of the ingredient manufacturer each time<br>
necessary information is received from the ingredient<br>
manufacturer system 200. The payment of a fund can be<br>
performed by a bank transfer or using electronic money,<br>
etc.<br>
