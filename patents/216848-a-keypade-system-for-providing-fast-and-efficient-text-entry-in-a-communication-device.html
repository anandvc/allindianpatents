METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PROVIDING A DISAMBIGUATED 	<br>
		Conventional alpha-numeric keypads (keypads) of subscriber devices include a plurality<br>
10	of keys, A majority of the keys include a number and three or four letters primed thereon. For<br>
	example, the number nine usually has "WXYZ" printed thereon. In many of these keypads a<br>
	user must first press a text menu key and subsequently press a specific key several times for<br>
	entering a text symbol. For example, a user must press the key with the number nine thereon<br>
	four times in order to enter the text symbol "Z". Such a process for entering texts symbols is<br>
15	time consuming and error prone. Furthermore, this process becomes even more time consuming<br>
	as well as cumbersorne and inefficient when a user is attempting to write a text message with a<br>
	multiplicity of alpha numeric key entries.<br>
		Therefore, what is needed is a method and device for providing fast and efficient text<br>
	entry.<br>

DETAILED DES CRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
		In overview, the present disclosure concerns user interfaces such as alpha-numeric<br>
	keypads (keypads) found, for example, on subscriber devices, such as cellular handsets,<br>
5	messaging devices, and most ordinary telephones. Note that subscriber device or unit may be<br>
	used interchangeably herein with wireless device, mobile station or unit and each of these terms<br>
	denotes a device ordinarily associated with a user and typically a wireless device that may be<br>
	used with a public network is accordance with a service agreement or within a private network.<br>
		As further discussed below, various inventive principles and combinations thereof are<br>
10	advantageously employed to provide a disambiguated keypad, thus providing a more fast and<br>
	efficient manner of text entry.<br>
		The instant disclosure is provided to further explain in an enabling fashion the best<br>
	modes of making and using a preferred embodiment in accordance with the present invention.<br>
	The disclosure is further offered to enhance an understanding and appreciation for the inventive<br>
15	principles and advantages thereof, rather than to limit in any manner the invention. The<br>
	invention is defined solely by the appended claims including any amendments made during the<br>
	pendency of this application and all equivalents of those claims as issued.<br>
		It is further understood that the use of relational terms, if any, such as first and second,<br>
	top and bottom, and the like are used solely to distinguish one from another unity or action<br>
20	without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order between such<br>
	entities or actions.<br>
		Much of the inventive functionality and many of the inventive principles are best<br>
	implemented with or in software programs or instructions and in integrated circuits (ICs). It is<br>
	expected that one of ordinary skill, notwithstanding possibly significant effort and many design<br>
25	choices motivated by, for example, available time, current technology, and economic<br>
	considerations, when guided by the concepts and principles disclosed herein will be readily<br>
	capable of generating such software instructions, programs and ICS with minimal<br>
	experimentation. Therefore, in the interest of brevity and minimization of any risk of obscuring<br>
	the principles and concepts according to the present invention, further discussion of such<br>
30	software or ICs, if any, will be limited to the essential with respect to the principles and<br>
	concepts used by the preferred embodiments.<br>
		Referring to FIGS. 1 - 2, the system for providing a disambiguated keypad may be<br>
	implemented in, for example, a subscriber device 1. Often, each key of the keypad may<br>
	represent a multiplicity of different characters. For example a number and one of three or more<br><br>
	WO 2004/061569							PCT/US2003/03791O<br>
3<br>
	alphabetic characters, such as "2 or a, b, or c" for the 2 key. The procedure and apparatus for<br>
	determining which one of these multiple alphanumeric characters a key activation or sequence<br>
	of activations is supposed to be may, for example, be referred to as resolving the particular key<br>
	or disambiguating the particular key.<br>
5		The subscriber device 1 includes several functional components shown as elements in<br>
	the block diagram of FIG. 2. The subscriber device 1, includes inter coupled as depicted, a<br>
	capacitive touchpad 1D, a driver device 12, a controller 14, and a mechanical keypad (or keypad<br>
	device) 16. These components will be discussed more fully below.<br>
		The capacitive touchpad (touchpad) 10 is adjacent and mechanically coupled to the<br>
10	mechanical keypad 16 and preferably disposed below the mechanical keypad 16. The touchpad<br>
	10 is for detecting movement of, for example, a user's finger, within a region defined by, for<br>
	example, the outer perimeter of a key 2 (see FIG. 5). The touchpad 10 is further for detecting a<br>
	direction of the movement within the region. The touchpad 10 is, preferably, composed of<br>
	horizontal wires (at least one) and vertical wires (at least one) disposed adjacent to the horizontal<br>
15	wires so that either, each of the vertical wires crosses over the horizontal wires or each of the<br>
	horizontal wires crosses over the vertical wires. The cross over between each of the horizontal<br>
	and vertical wires define a wire grid 22. Each of the horizontal and vertical wires is electrically<br>
	coupled to a signal output from the driver device 12. Electrical charges received from the driver<br>
	device 12, via the signal outputs, travel through the wire grid 22. The wire grid 22 in<br>
20	conjunction with the electrical charges defines a coordinate plane. As will be more fully<br>
	discussed below, the touchpad 10 outputs a resultant signal (shown as SNSP1 in FIG. 2) to the<br>
	driver device 12. This resultant signal is induced by interaction between movement of a user<br>
	finger on the wire grid 22 and one or more of the electrical charges in the wire grid 22. The<br>
	capacitive touchpad 10 may be a touchpad made by Cirque such as, for example, the Single-<br>
25	Chip Touchpad.<br>
		The driver device 12 is an integrated circuit electrically coupled to the touchpad 10 and<br>
	the controller 14. More specifically, the driver device 12 includes a plurality of signal outputs<br>
	(GND, Y0...Y5, X0...X7 depicted generally by 20) for driving a plurality of electrical charges<br>
	and sending these electrical charges to the capacitive touchpad 10 for mapping the capacitive<br>
30	touchpad 10 into a coordinate plane. This may be done by, for example, directing electrical<br>
	charges Y0 -- Y5 onto vertical wires of the wire grid 22 and electrical charges X0 - X7 onto<br>
	horizontal wires of the wire grid 22. The electrical charges are preferaibly sent sequentially so<br>
	that they may be distinguished from each other. However, the electrical charges may also be<br>
	sent at the same time but with different potential levels so that they may be distinguished from<br><br>
	WO 2004/061569							PCT/US2003/03791O<br>
4<br>
	each other. The driver device 20 receives the resultant signal SNSP1 from the touchpad 10 and<br>
	is able to match the resultant signal to a coordinate on the capacitive touchpad due to the<br>
	sequential nature in which the pulse signals are sent. The driver device 12 subsequently<br>
	generates a touchpad data signal corresponding to this resultant signal and sends it to the<br>
5	controller 14. The driver device 12 may be, for example, a known integrated circuit made by<br>
	Cirque.<br>
		The controller 14 is preferably a baseband processor. The controller 14 includes a<br>
	memory 24. a keyboard port 28 and a processor 30. As those skilled in the art should appreciate,<br>
	the processor 30 operates in a known manner to control operation of the controller 14 and thus<br>
10	the driver device 12 based upon software instructions (not shown) stored in the memory 24. The<br>
	keyboard port 28 is for providing electrical coupling between the key switches of the mechanical<br>
	keypad 16 and the controller 14. The memory 24 may be a combination of known RAM, ROM,<br>
	EEPROM or magnetic memory. The memory 24 includes a plurality of lookup tables (not<br>
	shown) stored therein. However, the lookup tables may alternatively be stored in an external<br>
15	memory. Each of the plurality of lookup tables, preferably corresponds to a specific key of the<br>
	mechanical keypad 16 and it comprised of a table of touchpad data signal values and<br>
	corresponding character values. The controller 14 is also electrically coupled to the driver 12<br>
	via, for example, a wired connection for receiving the touchpad data signal(s) generated by the<br>
	driver device 12. The controller 14 resolves the touchpad data signal(s) as one of a plurality of<br>
20	character values by, preferably, matching this touchpad data signal(s) to a touchpad data signal<br>
	in one of the lookup tables and finding its corresponding character value.<br>
		The mechanical keypad 16 may be a known physical keypad or virtual keypad. The<br>
	mechanical keypad 16 includes a phormality of keys (see FIG.1) and respective key switches (not<br>
	shown). The key switches are for detecting pressing of or pressure on (selection of) one of the<br>
25	plurality of keys, respectively and for outputting a selection indication signal corresponding to<br>
	one of the plurality of keys to the controller 14. The keys switches may also output the selection<br>
	indication signal having or demonstrating a corresponding time duration of the pressing. As<br>
	mentioned above, the mechanical keypad 16 may be electrically coupled to the controller 14 via<br>
	the keyboard port 28. The mechanical keypad 16 is preferably disposed above the capacitive<br>
30	touchpad 10 so that a user can easily make directional movements subsequent to pressing one of<br>
	the plurality of keys.<br>
		Referring to FIGS. 3 - 4, a method of operation of the disambiguated keypad of the<br>
	subscriber device I will now be discussed in view of the elements illustrated in FIGS. 1 - 2. At<br>
	310, a user presses one of the keys of the mechanical keypad 16. The pressed key represents a<br><br>
	WO 2004/061569							PCT/US2003/03791O<br>
5<br>
	plurality of characters, for example, text symbols and a number. The key switches of the<br>
	mechanical keypad 16 detect the actuation or the pressing of (or press me on) a key and generate<br>
	a key selection signal indicative of the pressed key. At 312, the mechanical keypad 16<br>
	communicates this key selection signal to the processor 30 via the keyboard part 28.<br>
5		At 314, the processor 30, preferably, selects one of a plurality of lookup tables stored in<br>
	the memory 24. Each of the plurality of lookup tables corresponds to one of the keys and<br>
	represent or corresponds to touch pad data. Accordingly, the processor 30 selects one of the<br>
	plurality of lookup tables based upon the key selection signal.<br>
		At 316, the processor 30, based on software instructions stored in the memory 24,<br>
10	commands the driver 12 to begin recording finger location data of the user and to send a data<br>
	stream to the processor 30. The driver 12 then sequentially sends the electrical charges to the<br>
	wire grid 22 of the capacitive touchpad 10 for defining the coordinate plane. As those skilled in<br>
	the art should appreciate when a user touches the capacitive touchpad 10 and thus a particular<br>
	wire intersection (between a horizontal and vertical wire) or vicinity thereof of the wire grid 22,<br>
15	the potential of the pulse signal in that particular wire intersection or vicinity will be changed or<br>
	distorted. This changed, or distorted potential signal, received by the driver device 12, will be<br>
	referred to as a resultant signal. The driver device 12 converts the resultant signal to a touchpad<br>
	data, signal and sends it to the processor 30. The driver device 12 is able to also record direction<br>
	of the pressing by recording the change in the, different pulse signals for each wire and<br>
20	continuing to send touchpad data signals to the processor 30 as part of the data stream.<br>
		At 318, the processor 30 determines if the key was released. Tins determination can be<br>
	done via the electrical coupling between the processor 30 and the mechanical keypad 16 at the<br>
	keyboard port 28. If the processor 30 determines that the key was not released, then at 321 the<br>
	processor 30 measures the time duration of the pressing or time lapsed while the key is pressed<br>
25	This is done, preferably, by utilizing an internal clock (not shown) in the controller 14.<br>
	Alternatively, the key switches of the mechanical keypad 16 could measure and report this time<br>
	duration. At 333, the processor determines if the time duration was greater than a predetermined<br>
	time period, A. This time duration may be user selectable and could be, for example, 1 - 3<br>
	seconds. If the processor 30 determines that the time duration is greater than the predetermined<br>
30	time period, then, at 325, the processor 30 uses the top-level character choice of the key pressed<br>
	and the method recycles to the beginning. For example, referring to the key 2 of FIG. 5, the top-<br>
	level character is the number two.<br>
		If, at 323, the processor 30 determines that the time duration is not greater than the<br>
	predetermined time period, A, Or, if, at 318, the processor 30 determines that the key was<br><br>
	WO 2004/061569							PCT/US2003/03791O<br>
6<br>
	released, then at 320 the processor 30 begins to monitor the input data stream of touchpad data<br>
	signals received from the driver device 12 as well as whether or not the finger is still on the<br>
	capacitive touchpad 10 (whether or not a resultant signal is present). The touchpad data signals<br>
	will be indicative of the current location of the finger on the wire grid 22.<br>
5	At 322, the processor 30 compares the touchpad data signals received from the driver in<br>
	the input data stream to touchpad data signals and associated character values in the lookup table<br>
	selected at 314, Upon finding a touchpad data signal in the lookup table that matches or<br>
	correlates or corresponds to the touchpad data signals received from the driver, the processor 30<br>
	may be able to resolve the touchpad data signals of the data stream to one of the character values<br>
10	associated with the found touchpad data signal thereby removing any ambiguity or<br>
	disambiguating the key pressed or activated. The manner by which the processor 30 matches<br>
	the touchpad data signals received from the driver to a touchpad data signal in the lookup table<br>
	can be done by conventional known database searching end matching techniques.<br>
		At 324, the processor 30 determines if the user has removed his/her finger from the<br>
15	capacitive touchpad 10. This may be accomplished by merely monitoring the touchpad data<br>
	signals from the driver 12.<br>
		If, at 324, the processor 30 determines that the user has removed his/her finger from the<br>
	capacitive touchpad 10, at 326 the processor 30 determines if the input data stream matched or<br>
	corresponded to at correlated with one of the character value entries in the lookup table. More<br>
20	specifically, the processor 30 determines if it was able to successfully resolve the data stream of<br>
	touchpad data signals to a character value of a plurality of character values at 326. If the<br>
	processor 50 determines that the input data stream matched one the character values at 326, then<br>
	at 330 the processor 30 uses this character value according to the application needs of the<br>
	subscriber device 1 and the process returns to the beginning.<br>
25	If, at 326, the processor 30 determines that the input data stream did not match any of the<br>
	character values at 322, then at 328 the processor 30 concludes that the user abandoned the last<br>
	input data stream and returns to 310 to start over.<br>
		If, at 324, the processor 30 determines that the user has not removed his/her finger from<br>
	the capacitive touchpad 10, then at 332 (FIG. 4) the processor 30 determines if a new<br>
30	mechanical key was pressed. If the processor 30 determines that a new mechanical key was<br>
	pressed, then at 334 the processor 30 concludes that the user abandoned the last input data<br>
	stream and uses the new mechanical key for starting over at 312.<br>
		If, at 332, the processor 30 determines that a new mechanical Key was not pressed, then<br>
	at 336 the processor 30 displays a plurality of characters that can be input or selected based upon<br><br>
	WO 2004/061569							PCT/US2003/03791O<br>
7<br>
	the key pressed at 310. These characters may be displayed by the display 4 of the subscriber<br>
	device I. At 338, the user chooses one of the characters from a menu, finger movement or a<br>
	combination of both.<br>
		Referring to FIG. 5, operation of the subscriber device 1 with the disambiguated keypad<br>
5	will be discussed. Initially, operation of the subscriber device 1 will be discussed for entering<br>
	the text symbol A. The user will initially press the key 2 with the number two thereon. The<br>
	mechanical keypad. 16 will consultantly generate a key selection signal corresponding to the<br>
	selection of this key 2. The processor 30 will receive this key selection signal via the keyboard<br>
	port 28 and will choose a lookup table stored in memory 24 that corresponds to this key 2. If the<br>
10	user subsequently releases the key 2 and slides the user's finger in the northwest direction as<br>
	shown in FIG. 5 (arrow pointing toward A), the user's finger will begin to interact with the<br>
	electrical charges in the wire grid 22 of the touchpad 10. More specifically, the user's finger<br>
	will induce a differential potential value on the region of the wire grid to the northwest of this<br>
	key 2. A signal corresponding to this differential potential value (resultant signal) will be output<br>
15	to the driver 12. The driver 12 will subsequently send a data stream of touchpad data signals to<br>
	the processor 30. The processor 30 will look in the selected look up table for matching the data<br>
	stream of touchpad data, signal to a character value, and will subsequently match this data stream<br>
	to the character A. The letter B or C could have been selected by the user sliding the user's<br>
	Finger in the north or northeast directions, respectively.<br>
20		Also, if the user initiated to enter the number two, the user would simply maintain<br>
	picture on the key 2 for a time duration that is longer than a predetermined time period (sec<br>
	323 of FIG. 3).<br>
		If the user would like to enter the text Z, the user will initially press the key 3 with the<br>
	number nine thereon. The processor 30 would operate in the above-described manner so. that the<br>
25	user could select the character Z by sliding the finger off the key and in the east direction. Note<br>
	much of the prefenced logic discussed herein may be changed without deviating from the spirit<br>
	without a finger slide, may result in selection of a numeric value whereas a relatively longer<br>
	activation including a finger slide in a particular direction may represent a particular alpha<br>
30	character. One of ordinary skill in view of the disclosure, principles and concepts discussed and<br>
	described herein will likely be prepared, to develop other logical approaches.<br>
		Therefore; the present invention advantageously provides a method and device for<br>
	disambiguating a plurality of keys for a mechanical keypad by permitting a user to select a<br><br>
	WO 2004/061569							PCT/US2003/03791O<br>
8<br>
	particular character by sliding the user's finger in a particular direction. As a result, a user will<br>
	be able to enter text in a more efficient manner.<br>
		While the above description is of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, it<br>
	should be appreciated that the invention may be modified, altered, or varied without deviating<br>
5	from the scope and fair meaning of the following claims. For example, the directions assigned<br>
	to a particular character shown in FIG. 5 could be changed. In addition, the mechanical keypad<br>
	could be replaced by merely using the capacitive touchpad to select a key. This can be done by<br>
	further utilization of the pulse signals in the wire grid. Finally, the lookup table may be<br>
	replaced by an alternative internally of externally stored data source of touchpad data signals<br>
10	and corresponding disambiguating character data.<br>
		The foregoing description is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the<br>
