2-ALKENYL-3-AMINOTHIOPHENE DERIVATIVE AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to 2-alkenyl-3-aminothiophene derivatives, which are useful as fungicide for agriculture and horticulture or intermediates thereof, and a process for producing the derivatives.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
In Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 1997-235282 (European Patent No. EP 0737682 Bl), there has been described a specific kind of 2-alkyl-3-aminothiophene derivatives which has strong control effect against various plant disease and a process for production thereof.  As one of processes for producing 2-alkyl-3-aminothiophene derivatives that are useful intermediates of the above compound, there has been known a process for producing it via 2-alkenyl-3-aminothiophene derivatives as intermediates by directly introducing alkyl groups into the 2-position of 3-aminothiophene derivatives.  For example, in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2000-327678, there has been disclosed a method for synthesizing 2-alkenyl-3-aminothiophene derivatives by reacting 3-aminothiophene derivatives with various<br>
ketones and synthesizing 2-alkyl-3-aminothiophene derivatives by the reduction.  However, according to the method as described in the document, to introduce alkenyl groups into the 3-aminothiophene derivatives, a formyl group, an acyl group or a carbamate group is needed as a protecting group of an amino group, and there are many rooms of improvement from the viewpoint of economical efficiency. [0003]<br>
As a method for introducing alkyl groups into 3-aminothiophene derivatives without using a protecting group, there has been described, in Tetrahedron Letters, 34, 5715-5718 (1993), Journal of Heterocyclic Chemistry, 33, 9-16 (1996) and Tetrahedron, 54, 9055-9066 (1998), that 2-alkyl-3-aminothiophene derivatives are obtained by reacting 3-aminothiophene with various aldehydes in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid and selenophenol.<br>
[0004]<br>
However, in the above documents, there has been no description of the reaction of 3-aminothiophene with a ketone.<br>
[0005]<br>
Furthermore, in Reference Example 1 of Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2000-327678, there has been described that when a ketone having reactivity inferior to that of aldehyde is used, 3-aminothiophene is preferentially decomposed due to its instability without progressing the reaction of the ketone with 3-aminothiophene under the conditions described therein, and desired 2-alkenyl-3-aminothiophene derivatives could not be obtained.<br>
