				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to Multifunction Peripheral Devices (MFP). Particularly the present invention relates to a plug-in application in an MFP having laser beam printers. Specifically the present invention relates to a method for sending a blank paper back to an input tray if a user presses a button for the cancellation of a print job. More particularly the present invention relates to a method for automatic paper roll back in MFP.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Wastage of paper in the printer side is an issue to be addressed in the present scenario, especially when the print command has been cancelled by the user after the paper from the input tray is taken for printing and no data is yet printed on the paper.<br>
US Patent titled "Printing apparatus with immediate interrupt", describes a method in which a control system for a laser printer, an AND gate is connected to a circuit system extending from a DC controller circuit to a driving circuit for a laser diode. A mask signal of "L" level is output from the port OPM of the DC controller circuit to the AND gate when a print stop key on an operation panel is switched on. Thereby, the print operation of a print mechanism is immediately stopped. This efficient method of interrupting printing prevents toner from being wasted on a printing error and  allows  immediate  interruption  when  a   printing  error is<br><br>
discovered.However, the patent publication does not mention the concept of calculating the length of paper entered into the print area and sending the blank paper back to the input tray.<br>
In another US patent titled," Printer", describes a method wherein a colour video printer can identify the length of a print sheet inserted therein for ejecting any print sheets other than a standard print sheet. The printer has a sheet feed sensor and another sensor disposed downstream of the sheet feed sensor with respect to the direction in which a print sheet is fed in the printer. After the leading end of an inserted print sheet is detected by the sheet feed sensor, the print sheet is fed until the leading end thereof is detected by the other downstream sensor. At this time, the length of the print sheet which is fed is equal to the distance, typically of 128 mm, between the sensors. The true length of the print sheet is calculated by adding, to 128 mm, the length of the print sheet which is further fed until the trailing end of the print sheet is detected by the sheet feed sensor. However, the patent publication does not mention about canceling a print job and sending the blank non-printed sheet back to the input tray.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention therefore aims to address the above problems/shortcomings. It relates to the method for sending a blank paper back to an input tray if a user presses a button for the cancellation of a print job.<br><br>
The invention relates to the field of embedded systems and particularly to Multifunctional Peripherals (MFPs). The invention describes a method for sending a blank paper back to an input tray if a user presses a button for the cancellation of a print job. According to the method, the length of a paper entered into the printing area is determined by keeping a track of the motor count value. The number of times the motor rotates to move the paper is directly proportional to the length of paper moved. In the event of cancellation of the print job, the motor count value is compared to a threshold value. If the motor count value is less than the threshold value, the motor rotation is stopped and the direction of rotation of the motor is reversed so as to send the paper back to the input tray.<br>
Accordingly the invention provides a method for automatic blank paper roll back in MFP on cancellation of a print job comprising the steps of:<br>
determining the motor count value which shows the number of times the<br>
motor rotates;<br>
determining the length of a paper entering into the printing area by<br>
monitoring the motor count value;<br>
fixing a threshold value for the occurrence of the roll back;<br>
comparing the motor count value to the threshold value in the event of<br>
cancellation of the print job; and<br>
stopping the motor rotation and reversing the direction of rotation of the<br>
motor if the motor count value is less than the threshold value for sending<br>
the paper back to the input tray.<br><br>
The number of times the motor rotates to move the paper is directly proportional to the length of paper moved.<br>
Accordingly the invention provides a system for automatic blank paper roll back in MFP on cancellation of a print job comprising:<br>
means for determining the motor count value which shows the number of<br>
times the motor rotates;<br>
means for determining the length of a paper entering into the printing area<br>
by monitoring the motor count value;<br>
means for fixing a threshold value for the occurrence of the roll back;<br>
means for comparing the motor count value to the threshold value in the<br>
event of cancellation of the print job; and<br>
a motor which stops rotation and reverse the direction of rotation if the<br>
motor count value is less than the threshold value for sending the paper<br>
back to the input tray.<br>
The  further  objects  of the  invention  will  be  apparent from  the  following descriptions.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Fig 1 is a flow Diagram describing the handling of Paper In case of Cancel Event.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The proposed invention relates to a method for keeping track of the motor count value i.e. the number of times the motor rotates to move the paper, and then control the paper incase of cancel event.<br>
Referring to Figure 1 the Printer will receive the data to be printed (1). Printer will fetch the paper from specified source (tray) (2). In case of a cancel event send to Mechanism controlling the paper movement (4). The Mechanism controlling the paper movement usually deploys a motor which will guide the paper to move forward. On receipt of cancel event the motor is stopped hence the paper movement is stopped. The count of motor rotation is directly proportional to the amount of paper that has been moved in some proportion. Hence a threshold value will suggest as whether the paper has moved inside the image forming mechanism or not. By comparing against the threshold value the current motor count value appropriate decision can be made (6). If the current motor count value is less than the threshold value then an event is send to paper control mechanism which will reverse the direction of movement of paper (7) On receipt of event, Paper control mechanism reverses the direction of paper movement which send the paper back to the Paper source and after which the Direction of motor is set to default forward motion (8, 9).<br>
In accordance with the current invention, by keeping track of the motor count value i.e., the number of times motor rotates to move the paper, and then control<br><br>
the paper incase of cancel event, and sends the paper back to input tray. For printing paper is taken from the input tray and is pushed (moved) forward in the guided paper path. The movement of paper is aided by the motor that will be in contact with the paper. By counting how many times the motor has rotated the length of paper that has been moved forward will be calculated. If cancel button is pressed then the motor value is checked whether its less than the threshold value (value when the paper has not entered the image forming area inside the printer) and if it is less than the threshold value then the motor rotation is stopped and the motor is reversed so it will send the paper back to the input tray.<br>
The invention can be further implemented for:<br>
1) Scan Input Tray, where in paper is taken for scanning. This has an advantage if user has initiated scanning with parameter say 300 dpi and cancels and then restart scanning with 600 dpi, here paper can be sent back to scan input tray as the document is not scanned yet.<br>
The invention adopts a method to reduce the wastage of paper and prevent the degradation of the quality of the paper when it is passed through the entire paper path due to temperature, stress and speed. It also involves a method to send back to the input tray instead of output tray thus reduces the manual intervention needed to find out blank paper in output tray and feeding it back in Input tray.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and<br><br>
apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br>
