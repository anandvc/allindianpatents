Specification<br>
Rotating Mechanism<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a rotating mechanism<br>
constituting a rotational body structure in an electrical<br>
generator, motor or the like andmore particularly to a rotating<br>
mechanism of the type which has a vertically extending rotary<br>
shaft.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
As one example of such a rotating mechanism, an<br>
electromagnetic rotating machine with a magnet rotor has been<br>
proposed (for example, see Patent Document 1).<br>
[0003]<br>
Here, such rotating mechanism has various bearings which<br>
journal the rotary shaft and the rotating mechanism<br>
performance depends on the level of rotation resistance.<br>
Hence, it is necessary to minimize the rotation resistance to<br>
improve the performance or efficiency as a rotating mechanism.<br>
For this purpose, provision of a mechanism which<br>
encourages or assists rotation is considered desirable.<br>
However, if rotation of the rotating mechanism is encouraged<br>
by supplying an electric current, etc. from outside, the input<br><br>
energy would increase, only to lower the efficiency of the rotating mechanism.<br>
In Patent Document 1 referred to above, the object is to obtain a DC motor or<br>
DC generator which does not use a commutator, a brush and a position sensor<br>
and causes no rib torque nor rib voltage but not to contribute to improvement<br>
in rotating mechanism efficiency.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Problem to be solved by the invention<br>
The present invention has been proposed in view of the above problem of the<br>
prior art and is intended to provide a rotating mechanism which has a very<br>
high rotation efficiency.<br>
Means for solving the problem.<br>
A rotating mechanism according to the present invention is characterized by<br>
comprising: a fixed member (1) having a bearing (16, 18); a rotary member (2)<br>
including a rotary shaft (21) journalled by the bearing and a disk member (22)<br>
provided on the rotary shaft; a plurality of coils (3) which are mounted on the<br>
fixed member (1) and arranged at regular intervals on a circle centered on the<br>
rotary shaft (21); and a first permanent magnet (4) mounted on the disk<br>
member (22), wherein<br><br>
first permanent magnets (4) are arranged at regular intervals<br>
on a circle centered on the rotary shaft (21) and arranged to<br>
face the coils (3) (Claim 1).<br>
[0007]<br>
Here, it is preferable that the coil (3) be penetrated<br>
by a core member of nonmagnetic material (for example,<br>
stainless steel) and a member of magnetic material (for example,<br>
iron disk or iron plate) be located on its end face away from<br>
its end face opposite to the first permanent magnet (4) (Claim<br>
2) .<br>
[0008]<br>
It is preferable that a plurality of arm members (24)<br>
be fitted to the disk member (22), a second permanent magnet<br>
(5) be held on the tip of the arm member (24) by a first magnet<br>
holding member (24h) , a third permanent magnet (6) be provided<br>
radially outside the arm member (24) in an area of the fixed<br>
member (1) , the third permanent magnet (6) be held by a second<br>
magnet holding member (11h) , and a repulsive force be generated<br>
when the second permanent magnet (5) moves in a direction of<br>
rotation (R)from a condition in which the second permanent<br>
magnet (5) is in the same circumferential position as the third<br>
permanent magnet (6) (condition in which the second permanent<br>
magnet 5 and the third permanent magnet 6 are on line 24Lc).<br>
Here, it is preferable that the number of such third<br>
permanent magnets (6) be larger than the number of such arm<br>
members (24).<br>
[0009]<br><br>
It is preferable that the first magnet holding member<br>
(24h) be made of nonmagnetic material (for example, aluminum<br>
or plastic) and surround the second permanent magnet (5) and<br>
form an open area (240h) which allows radiation of lines of<br>
magnetic force from the second permanent magnet (5), the second<br>
magnet holding member (11h) be made of magnetic material (for<br>
example, nickel chrome steel) and surround the third permanent<br>
magnet (6) and form an open area (110h) which allows radiation<br>
of lines of magnetic force from the third permanent magnet (6) ,<br>
and when the open area (240h) of the first magnet holding member<br>
(24h) and the open area (110h) of the second magnet holding<br>
member (11h) do not face each other, no magnetic interaction<br>
occur between the second permanent magnet (5) and the third<br>
permanent magnet (6) but when the open area (240h) and the open<br>
area (110h) face each other, magnetic repulsion occur between<br>
the second permanent magnet (5) and the third permanent magnet<br>
(6) (Claim 4).<br>
[0010]<br>
It is preferable that a fourth permanent magnet (8) be<br>
mounted on a lower surface of the disk member (22), a fifth<br>
permanent magnet (9) be provided on the fixed member (1) in<br>
an area below the fourth permanent magnet (8), and the fifth<br>
permanent magnet (9) be arranged to face the fourth permanent<br>
magnet (8) and to have the same polarity as the fourth permanent<br>
magnet (8) (Claim 5).<br>
Here, it is preferable that the fourth permanent magnet<br>
(8) be mounted on the lower surface of the disk member (22)<br><br>
by a stainless steel fitting (stay) and the fifth permanent<br>
magnet (9) be mounted on the fixed member(1) by a stainless<br>
steel fitting (stay) .<br>
[0011]<br>
It is preferable that the fixed member (1) be comprised<br>
of an upper frame (11) and a lower frame (13) which are regular<br>
polygonal annular or circular, and a connecting member (11b)<br>
which connects the upper frame (11) and the lower frame (13) .<br>
Effects of the Invention<br>
[0012]<br>
In the above rotating mechanism, since it includes plural<br>
coils (3) arranged at regular intervals on a circumference on<br>
the fixed member (1) and plural first permanent magnets (4)<br>
facing the coils (3) of the rotary member (2), when the<br>
rotational body (2) is first rotated by a given means to start<br>
rotation, an induced current is generated in the coil (3) in<br>
accordance with Fleming' s left hand rule. The induced current<br>
generated in the coil (3) works to rotate the first permanent<br>
magnet (4) in the same direction as when it was initially<br>
rotated.<br>
In other words, once the rotational body (2) has been<br>
rotated, for example, by a motor, then an induced current is<br>
generated in the coil (3) and on the principle of so-called<br>
"Aragon's disk," it works to encourage rotation of the<br>
rotational body, thereby assuring a very high rotation<br>
efficiency.<br><br>
[0013]<br>
If the coil (3) is penetrated by a core member of<br>
nonmagnetic material (for example, stainless steel) and a<br>
member of magnetic material (for example, iron disk or iron<br>
plate) is located on its end face away from its end face opposite<br>
to the first permanent magnet (4) (Claim 2), the member of<br>
magnetic material intensifies the magnetic field generated in<br>
the coil (3) and also if the core member is made of nonmagnetic<br>
material, stainless steel in particular, a magnetic field<br>
properly passes through the core member and thus a magnetic<br>
field is properly generated from the coil (3).<br>
In addition, since the core member is a nonmagnetic<br>
material, it is not attracted by the first permanent magnet<br>
(4), which prevents the rotational body from being braked.<br>
Here, since the member of magnetic material is away from the<br>
first permanent magnet (4) , it is less likely to be attracted<br>
by the first permanent magnet (4).<br>
[0014]<br>
In the present invention, if plural arm members (24) are<br>
provided, a second permanent magnet (5) is held on the tip of<br>
the arm member (24) by a first magnet holding member (24h),<br>
a third permanent magnet (6) is provided radially outside the<br>
arm member (24) in an area of the fixed member (1), and the<br>
third permanent magnet (6) is held by a second magnet holding<br>
member (11h) (Claim 3, Claim 4), magnetic repulsion between<br>
the second permanent magnet (5) and the third permanent magnet<br>
(6) rotates the arm member (24) and adds a torque to the disk<br><br>
member (22) . As a consequence, rotation is encouraged without<br>
supply of current from outside.<br>
In other words, if action made by the coil (3) and the<br>
first permanent magnet (4) is considered main action, the<br>
second permanent magnet (5) and the third permanent magnet (6)<br>
work to increase the action.<br>
[0015]<br>
If a fourth permanent magnet (8) on the rotary side and<br>
a fifth permanent magnet (9) are provided, the fifth permanent<br>
magnet (9) is located to face the fourth permanent magnet (8)<br>
and its face opposite to the fourth permanent magnet (8) has<br>
the same polarity as the fourth permanent magnet (8) so as for<br>
the fourth permanent magnet (8) on the rotary side and the fifth<br>
permanent magnet (9) on the fixed side to repel each other<br>
(Claim 5) , magnetic repulsion between the permanent magnets<br>
(8, 9) works so as the whole rotary member (2) to float from<br>
the fixed member (1).<br>
As a consequence, the thrust exerted on the fixed member<br>
(1) by the rotary member (2) can be reduced close to zero and<br>
friction caused by the thrust can be reduced close to zero.<br>
[0016]<br>
By combining all the above structures and their actions,<br>
friction in rotation of the rotary member (2) is reduced close<br>
to zero and a rotating mechanism with a very high rotation<br>
efficiency is obtained.<br>
[0017]<br>
Furthermore, in the present invention, plural coils are<br><br>
arranged like a ring between the fourth permanent magnet (8)<br>
and the fifth permanent magnet (9), ring arrays of coils are<br>
vertically spaced, the polarities of the vertically spaced<br>
arrays of coils are so determined as to generate a repulsive<br>
force, and plural air core coils with their open ends up and<br>
down are located between vertically spaced arrays of magnets<br>
in order to generate electric power.<br>
[0018]<br>
The electric power generated by the air core coils<br>
between the upper and lower arrays of magnets can drive, for<br>
example, a motor mounted on the top of the disk member (22) .<br>
Or the electric power generated by the air core coils can drive,<br>
for example, a motor provided to rotate the disk member (22)<br>
only.<br>
[0019]<br>
Here, the "motor provided to rotate the disk member (22)<br>
only" is connected to the disk member (22) through a gear or<br>
belt and thus it is possible for the disk member (22) to rotate<br>
even when the rotary shaft (21) is not connected to a driving<br>
source. When electric power is generated by rotating the<br>
arrays of coils arranged like rings together with the disk<br>
member (22) , it is also possible to rotate only the disk member<br>
(22) without rotating the rotary shaft (21).<br>
[0020]<br>
Here, if the disk member (22) is so structured as to be<br>
able to rotate relatively with respect to the rotary shaft (21) ,<br>
the disk member (22) can be rotated more effectively by fixing<br><br>
the rotary shaft (21) and letting a thrust bearing provided<br>
there bear the weight of the disk member (22).<br>
[0021]<br>
In addition, regarding the upper and lower ring arrays<br>
of magnets, by fixing the lower array of magnets and mounting<br>
the upper array of magnets on the disk member (22), the disk<br>
member (22) can be floated by repulsion between poles of the<br>
same polarity. Also, as described above, electric power can<br>
be generated in the air core coils by rotation of the disk member<br>
(22) .<br>
In this case, rotation of the disk member (22) enhances<br>
the effect achieved by a magnetic force.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
[0022]<br>
Next, embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
described referring to the accompanying drawings.<br>
First, a rotating mechanism 100 as a first embodiment<br>
(embodiment) will be described referring to Figs. 1 to 11.<br>
[0023]<br>
The rotating mechanism, the whole of which is represented<br>
by reference numeral 100 in Figs. 1 and 2, includes a fixed<br>
member 1, a rotary member 2, a plurality of coils 3 mounted<br>
on the fixed member 1, and a plurality of first permanent<br>
magnets 4 mounted on the rotary member 2.<br>
[0024]<br>
The fixed member 11 is a three-layered structure in which<br><br>
an upper frame 11, a middle frame 12 and a lower frame 13 are<br>
stacked through eight connecting members 11b with spaces in<br>
the vertical direction (see Fig. 2).<br>
Specifically, the upper frame 11 is formed as an<br>
equilateral-octagonal structure assembled by connecting ends<br>
of eight members 11a with the same cross-sectional profile<br>
(groove type cross section) through the connecting members 11b (see Fig. 1).<br>
[0025]<br>
Although not clearly shown in Fig. 1, the middle frame<br>
12 has the same contour as the upper frame 11 and, like the<br>
upper frame 11, is formed as an equilateral-octagonal<br>
structure assembled by connecting ends of eight members 12a<br>
with the same cross-sectional profile (groove type cross<br>
section) through the connecting members 11b (see Fig. 2) .<br>
[0026]<br>
Although not clearly shown, the lower frame 13 has the<br>
same contour as the upper frame 11 and is an<br>
equilateral-octagonal structure assembled with eight members<br>
13a with a groove type cross section which are larger than the<br>
upper frame 11 and the middle frame 12 (in terms of size in<br>
the vertical direction of Fig. 2) (see Fig. 2).<br>
[0027]<br>
In Fig. 1, in the upper frame 11, the members with a groove<br>
type cross section 11a, 11a on the left and right in the figure<br>
are connected and reinforced by two beams lie running parallel<br>
to each other horizontally in the figure. The two beams lie<br><br>
are vertically symmetrical with respect to the center point<br>
0 of the rotary member 2 (center of rotation, which is also<br>
the center point of the upper frame 11).<br>
[0028]<br>
In Fig. 1, in the upper frame 11, the upper member lla-1<br>
and the upper beam llc-1 are connected by two beams lid running<br>
parallel to each other vertically in Fig. 1 and the lower member<br>
lla-2 and the lower beam llc-2 are connected by two beams lid<br>
running parallel to each other vertically in the figure,<br>
thereby reinforcing the whole upper frame 11.<br>
[0029]<br>
Although not clearly shown, like the upper frame 11, in<br>
the middle frame 12, the members with a groove type cross<br>
section 12a, 12a on the left and right are connected and<br>
reinforced by two beams 12c (see Fig. 2) running parallel to<br>
each other horizontally in Fig. 1.<br>
The two beams 12c are symmetrical with respect to the<br>
center point 0 of the middle frame 12 vertically in Fig. 1.<br>
[0030]<br>
Furthermore, like the upper frame 11 described in<br>
reference to Fig. 1, in the middle frame 12, the upper member<br>
12a in Fig. 1 (which lies in the same position as the member<br>
lla-1 in Fig. 1) and the upper beam 12c (which lies in the same<br>
position as the beam llc-1 in Fig. 1) are connected by two beams<br>
12d (not shown) (which run parallel to each other vertically<br>
in Fig. 1) . And the lower member 12a (which lies in the same<br>
position as the member lla-2 in Fig. 1) and the lower beam 12c<br><br>
(which lies in the same position as the beam llc-2 in Fig. 1)<br>
are connected and reinforced by two beams 12d (not shown) (which<br>
run parallel to each other vertically in Fig. 1).<br>
[0031]<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, the lower frame 13 is mounted on<br>
the upper surface of a base member 14 in a way to lie over it<br>
and the outer rim of the base member 14 is smaller than the<br>
outer rim of the lower frame 13. A reinforcing member 14a is<br>
provided in the center of the base member 14.<br>
[0032]<br>
In Fig. 1, a bearing supporting plate 15 is supported<br>
by the two beams lie, lie in an area between the two beams lie,<br>
lie of the upper frame 11 which also corresponds to the center<br>
of the upper frame 11. A radial bearing 16 (upper bearing)<br>
is provided on the upper surface of the bearing supporting plate<br>
15. Here, the radial bearing 16 is located with its center<br>
axis perpendicular to the paper surface of Fig. 1.<br>
[0033]<br>
A bearing supporting plate 17 is located in the center<br>
of the reinforcing member 14a (provided in the center of the<br>
base member 14) and a lower bearing 18 is fitted in the center<br>
of the bearing supporting plate 17(upper surface in Fig. 2).<br>
Here, the lower bearing 18 has a structure which combines a<br>
radial bearing 18A and a thrust bearing 18B, and is so located<br>
that the center axis of the lower bearing 18 extends vertically<br>
in Fig. 2 (direction perpendicular to the paper surface of Fig.<br>
1) •<br><br>
[0034]<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 2, a radial bearing<br>
(middle bearing) 19 is fitted in the center of the middle frame<br>
12 as well.<br>
As apparent from Fig. 2, the center axis of the middle<br>
bearing 19 and the center axis of the upper bearing 16 overlap<br>
on an extension of the center axis of the lower bearing 18.<br>
[0035]<br>
The rotary shaft 21 is journalled by the upper bearing<br>
16, middle bearing 19 and lower bearing 18.<br>
In the rotary shaft 21, a disk member (for example, an<br>
aluminum disk) 22 is fixed to the rotary shaft 21 through a<br>
hub 20 in the area between the upper bearing 16 and the middle<br>
bearing 19.<br>
In other words, the rotary member 2 has a rotary shaft<br>
21 and a disk member 22 as major components.<br>
As will be described later, rotation of the aluminum (or<br>
plastic) disk 22 is assisted on the principle of "Aragon' s disk"<br>
on which electric power consumption meters are based.<br>
[0036]<br>
Here, the rotary shaft 21 is made of nonmagnetic material<br>
such as stainless steel in order to avoid the influence of a<br>
fourth and a fifth permanent magnet which will be stated later.<br>
The disk member 22 has a mass above a given level so as<br>
to exert an effect of holding a torque as a so-called flywheel<br>
(pulley).<br>
When aluminum or synthetic resin is used as the material<br><br>
for the disk member 22, it is more effective.<br>
[0037]<br>
Referring to Figs. 3 and 4, in the disk member 22, a<br>
plurality of brackets 23 for permanent magnets which have an<br>
L-shaped cross section are fitted at regular intervals all<br>
around the outer rim of the disk member 22. Here, in Figs.<br>
3 and 4, for simple illustration, only one bracket 23 is shown<br>
and the other brackets 23 are not shown.<br>
Although not shown, in Figs. 3 and 4, it is also possible<br>
to provide one annular member 23 in place of plural brackets<br>
23 so that the annular member 23 is mounted on the disk member<br>
22 by a fitting 23b.<br>
[0038]<br>
In Figs. 3 and 4, a first permanent magnet 4 is fitted<br>
to the radially inner surface (surface nearer to the rotary<br>
shaft 21) of a flange part 23a of each bracket 23. Here, first<br>
permanent magnets 4 neighboring along the circumferential<br>
direction are arranged in a way that the polarities of their<br>
radially inner surfaces alternate between the N pole and the<br>
S pole.<br>
[0039]<br>
The cross section of the bracket 23 shown in Fig. 4 is<br>
a cross section at a special point where an arm member 24 (which<br>
will be described later) is mounted on the upper surface of<br>
the disk member 22 (cross section indicated by Y in Fig. 1) .<br>
Although not shown, in an ordinary cross section without<br>
an arm member 24, the height of the flange part 23a of the<br><br>
bracket 23 and the position of the first permanent magnet 4<br>
are larger than the height of the flange part 23a and the<br>
position of the first permanent magnet 4 as shown in Fig. 4<br>
by the amount equivalent to the thickness of an arm member 24.<br>
[0040]<br>
Although not shown in Figs. 1 and 2, reference numeral<br>
lie in Fig. 4 represents a canopy which covers the upper portion<br>
of the rotating mechanism 100. The canopy lie covers all the<br>
areas except the members 11a, beams lie, beams lid of the upper<br>
frame 11 and the bearing supporting plate 15.<br>
[0041]<br>
In Fig. 4, an L-shaped bracket for a coil, llf, is<br>
provided at a distance of rl (radial distance) from the axial<br>
center 21c of the rotary shaft 21 with its top down in Fig.<br>
4 A plurality of coil brackets 11f are provided all around<br>
the disk member 22 at regular intervals.<br>
Here, the radial distance rl of the coil bracket 11f is<br>
shorter than the radial distance r2 of the bracket 23 (radial<br>
distance from the axial center 21c to the bracket 23).<br>
[0042]<br>
A coil 3 is fitted to the coil bracket 11f s side<br>
(radially outer side) opposite to the permanent magnet bracket<br>
23, by a means which will be described later. Here, the coil<br>
3 is a so-called electromagnetic coil which generates a<br>
magnetic field when energized. More specifically, the coil<br>
3 is so structured that when the coil 3 is energized, a magnetic<br>
field is generated in the coil 3 and the magnetic filed causes<br><br>
mutual inductance to occur between the coil 3 and the first<br>
permanent magnet 4.<br>
[0043]<br>
When the first permanent magnet 4 rotates together with<br>
the disk member 22 and crosses the magnetic field of the coil<br>
3, an induced current is generated in the coil 3. If the<br>
rotational body 2 is rotated by a given means, for example,<br>
in accordance with Faraday's law a small motor (not shown),<br>
an induced current is generated in the coil 3 when the first<br>
permanent magnet 4 passes (the magnetic field of) the coil 3.<br>
Due to the induced current generated in the coil 3, the<br>
first permanent magnet 4 and the disk member 22 are impelled<br>
to rotate in the same direction as they were initially rotated.<br>
As a consequence, once the rotary member 2 has been rotated<br>
by some means (for example, a motor), the induced current<br>
generated in the coil 3 impels the rotary member 2 to continue<br>
rotating.<br>
[0044]<br>
Although not clearly shown, the first embodiment is<br>
structured as a type in which the rotary member 2 rotates upon<br>
start of a small motor (for starting) and so structured that<br>
a clutch means is interposed between the rotary shaft and the<br>
starting motor and when the rotary member reaches a prescribed<br>
rotation speed, the clutch is turned off.<br>
[0045]<br>
Next, referring to Figs. 5 to 7, the detailed positional<br>
relation between the coil 3 and the first permanent magnet 4<br><br>
and the detailed structure of the coil will be described.<br>
In Figs. 5 to 7, the coil 3 includes a coil body 32, a<br>
plate member 33 provided on an end of the coil body 32, and<br>
a pressure plate 34 for pressing the plate member 33 in Fig.<br>
5. Here, the pressure plate 34 is made of nonmagnetic material<br>
for the reason which will be described later.<br>
[0046]<br>
The coil body 32, plate member 33 and pressure plate 34<br>
are penetrated by a stainless steel core member 35 which also<br>
serves as a through bolt.<br>
An external (male) thread 35t is formed on the stainless<br>
steel core member 35' s portion except its portion penetrating<br>
the coil body 32. A first nut Nl is screwed on the external<br>
thread 35t and by tightening the first nut Nl, the clearance<br>
between the plate member 33 and the pressure plate 34 is<br>
shortened.<br>
[0047]<br>
A nut N2 is screwed on the external thread 35t in a region<br>
where the stainless steel core member 35 penetrates the coil<br>
bracket llf. And the coil 3 is fitted to the coil bracket 11f by sandwiching the coil bracket 11f with the nut N2.<br>
Fig. 7 is a sectional view of the coil 3's center in the<br>
longitudinal direction (left/right direction in Figs. 5 and<br>
6) .<br>
[0048]<br>
In Figs. 5 and 6, reference numeral 36 represents a plate<br>
member (iron plate) of magnetic material (for example, iron)<br><br>
with a through hole for a bolt in its center.<br>
A conventional coil often uses an iron core in the coil<br>
center in order to increase the magnetic flux density. However,<br>
in the first embodiment illustrated, there is a problem that<br>
since the core member of the coil 3 moves in the immediate<br>
vicinity of the permanent magnet 4 (see Figs. 5 and 6) , if the<br>
core member of the coil 3 is an iron core, the core member of<br>
the coil 3 would be attracted to the permanent magnet 4 and<br>
the attractive force would brake the rotation of the disk member<br>
22.<br>
[0049]<br>
Here, if it is made of stainless steel, it is not be<br>
attracted to the permanent magnet but allows a magnetic field<br>
to pass through it.<br>
Therefore, the coil 3 used in the first embodiment<br>
employs a stainless steel core member 35 as the core member<br>
of the coil 3 to prevent the core member of the coil 3 from<br>
being attracted to the permanent magnet 4 . In addition, since<br>
a magnetic field passes through the stainless steel core member<br>
35, when the stainless steel core member 35 is inserted into<br>
the coil 3, the effect of the coil 3, namely the effect of<br>
encouraging rotation of the disk member 22 by the permanent<br>
magnet 4 as an electromagnet and self-inductance, is not<br>
hindered.<br>
[0050]<br>
In addition, in the first embodiment illustrated, the<br>
ironmember (iron plate) 36 is provided in the remotest position<br><br>
of the coil 3 from the permanent magnet 4 (right end in Figs.<br>
5 and 6) so that the magnetic field passing through the<br>
stainless steel core member 35 is intensified as it passes<br>
through the iron plate 36. In other words, the presence of<br>
the iron plate 36 ensures the effect of intensifying the<br>
magnetic field as in the case of an ordinary coil which has<br>
an iron core in it.<br>
Furthermore, since the iron plate 36 is located in the<br>
remotest position from the permanent magnet 4, the risk that<br>
the iron plate may be attracted by the magnetic field of the<br>
permanent magnet 4 and rotation of the disk member 22 may be<br>
braked is extremely low or negligible.<br>
[0051]<br>
In short, due to the use of the coil 3 as illustrated<br>
in Figs. 5 and 6, as the permanent magnet passes, a strong<br>
magnetic field generated in the coil 3 generates an electric<br>
current without causing braking of rotation of the disk member<br>
22.<br>
[0052]<br>
Although the iron plate 36 is provided on the radially<br>
inner side of the coil 3 to intensify the magnetic field<br>
generated in the coil 3 as shown in Figs. 5 and 6, another<br>
possible approach is that instead of providing an iron disk<br>
36 on each coil 3, an iron plate (not shown) is located on the<br>
coil bracket llf's radially inner side (side away from the<br>
permanent magnet) and the iron plate is a single continuous<br>
ring. This means that this single continuous annular disk<br><br>
exerts the effect of intensifying, on the radially inner sides<br>
of brackets 11f for individual coils 3, magnetic fields<br>
generated in the corresponding individual coils 3.<br>
[0053]<br>
In order to increase the rotation efficiency of the<br>
rotating mechanism 100, the first embodiment includes arm<br>
members 24 (see Fig. 1) in addition to the above structure.<br>
In Figs. 1 and 8, three arm members 24 (only one is shown<br>
in Fig. 8) extend radially outside on the upper surface of the<br>
disk member 22. As apparent from Fig. 1, the three arm members<br>
24 are mounted at regular intervals in the circumferential<br>
direction.<br>
[0054]<br>
An attachment 24a holding a second permanent magnet 5<br>
is fitted to the tip of the arm member 24.<br>
As will be described later, in the attachment 24a at the<br>
tip of the arm member 24, the second permanent magnet 5 is mostly<br>
covered by a holder 24h and the holder 24h is made of nickel<br>
chrome steel, a magnetic material.<br>
Since both the permanent magnet 5 and the permanent<br>
magnet 6 are surrounded by nickel chrome steel, magnetism is<br>
reduced.<br>
[0055]<br>
An attachment 11g holding the third permanent magnet 6<br>
is fitted to each of the eight connecting members 11b of the<br>
upper frame 11 of the fixed member 1; and the attachment 11g <br>
is oriented radially inward (toward the center of rotation 0<br><br>
in Fig. 8).<br>
Here, Fig. 8 shows that the arm member 24 rotates and<br>
the center of the second permanent magnet 5 comes on a virtual<br>
line (not shown in Fig. 8) connecting the third permanent magnet<br>
6 and the center of rotation 0. Arc Lr in Fig. 8 represents<br>
the trajectory of the radially outer end of the attachment 24a<br>
at the tip of the arm member 24.<br>
[0056]<br>
The number of arm members 24 or second permanent magnets<br>
5 (three in the embodiment shown here) and the number of third<br>
permanent magnets 6 (eight in the embodiment illustrated here)<br>
are determined from the viewpoint of prevention of "torque<br>
ripple" which would arise as the plural second permanent<br>
magnets 5 approach the fixed third permanent magnets 6<br>
simultaneously.<br>
[0057]<br>
Next, primarily referring to Figs. 9 and 10, the<br>
advantageous effect that the attachment 24a on the arm member<br>
24 (for the second permanent magnet 5) and the attachment 11g <br>
on the upper frame 11 (for the third permanent magnet 6) as<br>
shown in Fig. 8 encourage rotation of the disk member 22 (Fig.<br>
1) will be described.<br>
[0058]<br>
In Figs. 9 and 10, the attachment 24a on the arm member<br>
is comprised of a second permanent magnet 5, a holder 24h<br>
holding the second permanent magnet 5 in a way to cover most<br>
of it, and a fitting member 24b for fixing the attachment 24a<br><br>
to the tip of the arm member 24.<br>
The attachment 11g on the upper frame 11 (left in Figs.<br>
9 and 10) is comprised of a third permanent magnet 6, a holder<br>
11h holding the third permanent magnet 6 in a way to cover most<br>
of it, and a fitting member 11 j for fixing the attachment 24a<br>
to the connecting member 11b.<br>
[0059]<br>
In the embodiment illustrated, the holder 24h for holding<br>
the second permanent magnet 5 and the holder 11h for holding<br>
the third permanent magnet 6 are both made of nickel chrome<br>
steel, a magnetic material.<br>
The holder 24h and the holder 11h cover most of the second<br>
permanent magnet 5 or the third permanent magnet 6 to prevent<br>
magnetic field leakage. However, on their sides facing each<br>
other, namely on the holder 24h's radially outer side or side<br>
nearer to the connecting member 11b, and the holder 11h's<br>
radially inner side or side nearer to the arm 24, the permanent<br>
magnets are partially not covered by the nickel chrome steel.<br>
[0060]<br>
More specifically, the holder 24h for holding the second<br>
permanent magnet 5 takes the form of a cylinder with its bottom<br>
closed (see Fig. 10) and part of its periphery (radially outer<br>
part) is cut out along the center axis of the cylinder so as<br>
to expose the second permanent magnet 5 (forming an open area<br>
240h) . Although the center axis of the cylinder is not shown<br>
here, in Fig. 9 the center axis extends perpendicularly to the<br>
paper surface and in Fig. 10 it extends up/down or vertically.<br><br>
[0061]<br>
In Fig. 9, one end of the open area 240h (start point<br>
of the open area 240h) is in a position delayed by angle 51<br>
(15 degrees in the example shown here) from line 24Lc<br>
corresponding to the centerline of the arm member 24 (a position<br>
above the line in Fig. 9) in the direction of rotation of the<br>
arm member 24 (direction indicated by arrowed dotted line R) .<br>
In Fig. 9, one end of the open area 240h (start point of the<br>
open area 240h) is indicated by line 5S (line connecting the<br>
start point of the open area 240h and the center point of the<br>
permanent magnet 5).<br>
[0062]<br>
The opening angle of the open area 240h is 60 degrees<br>
in Fig. 9. In other words, the open area 240h lies from the<br>
above one end (start point of the open area 240h) to a point<br>
turned clockwise 60 degrees from it.<br>
Also, in the holder 24h, its periphery including the open<br>
area 240h is chipped off so as to form a portion C1 inclined<br>
upward to the right. The inclination angle of the inclined<br>
portion C1 is 28 degrees with respect to the vertical axis (not<br>
shown) in Fig. 9.<br>
[0063]<br>
As apparent from Figs. 9 and 10, the second permanent<br>
magnet 5 takes the form of a cylinder whose outside diameter<br>
is the same as the inside diameter of the holder 24h. Regarding<br>
the polarities of the second permanent magnet 5, assuming that<br>
it is vertically halved along the axial center of the cylinder,<br><br>
one half is the S pole (5S: left in Fig. 9) and the other half<br>
is the N pole (5N: right in Fig. 9).<br>
Here, the halving plane of the second permanent magnet<br>
5	is orthogonal to line 5S indicating the start point of the<br>
open area 240h and the "halving plane" is inclined 15 degrees<br>
with respect to the vertical axis (not shown).<br>
[0064]<br>
The holder 11h for holding the third permanent magnet<br>
6	takes the form of a cylinder with its bottom closed and part<br>
of the periphery of the cylinder is open (it has an open area<br>
110h in the periphery) .<br>
In Fig. 9, one end of the open area 110h (or start point<br>
of the open area 110h) is in a position advanced by angle 52<br>
(15 degrees in the example shown here) downward in Fig. 9 from<br>
an extension (which passes the center point of the third<br>
permanent magnet 6) of line 24Lc of the arm member 24, or turned<br>
clockwise by angle 52 from the extension of line 24Lc.<br>
[0065]<br>
In Fig. 9, one end of the open area 110h (or start point<br>
of the open area 110h) is expressed by line 6S (line connecting<br>
the start point of the open area 110h and the center point of<br>
the permanent magnet 6).<br>
The open area 110h lies from the above one end or line<br>
5S to a point turned clockwise by an opening angle from it.<br>
The opening angle is 60 degrees in the example in Fig. 9.<br>
The open area 110h is chipped off so as to form an inclined<br>
portion C2. The inclined portion C2 is inclined 28 degrees<br><br>
vertically in Fig. 9 in the example shown here.<br>
[0066]<br>
The third permanent magnet 6 takes the form of a cylinder<br>
whose outside diameter is the same as the inside diameter of<br>
the holder 11h. Regarding the polarities of the third<br>
permanent magnet 6, assuming that it is vertically halved along<br>
the axial center of the cylinder, one half is the S pole (6S:<br>
right in Fig. 9) and the other half is the N pole (6N: left<br>
in Fig. 9).<br>
The halving plane of the third permanent magnet 6 is<br>
orthogonal to the line 6S (line connecting the start point of<br>
the open area 110h and the center point of the permanent magnet<br>
6). In the example in Fig. 9, the halving plane of the third<br>
permanent magnet 6 is inclined 15 degrees with respect to the<br>
vertical axis (not shown).<br>
[0067]<br>
Although the second permanent magnet 5 and the third<br>
permanent magnet 6 are both cylindrical permanent magnets in<br>
the example in Fig. 9, they are not limited to cylindrical ones<br>
but may be bar-shaped magnets whose cross section is polygonal.<br>
[0068]<br>
In the condition shown in Fig. 9, the second permanent<br>
magnet 5 and the third permanent magnet 6 are so arranged that<br>
their S poles (5S, 6S) face each other.<br>
When the second permanent magnet 5 or arm member 24 moves<br>
across line 24Lc in Fig. 9 from an area above line 24Lc to an<br>
area below line 24Lc in Fig. 9, the open area 240h of the holder<br><br>
24h and the open area 110h of the holder 11h do not fully face<br>
each other (stand face to face) until the center of the second<br>
permanent magnet 5 reaches a prescribed point in the area below<br>
line 24Lc.<br>
[0069]<br>
Since the magnetic field of the second permanent magnet<br>
5 and the magnetic field of the third permanent magnet 6 are<br>
intercepted by the holder 24h and holder 11h, they do not<br>
interact with each other unless the open area 240h of the holder<br>
24h and the open area 110h of the holder 11h fully face each<br>
other (stand face to face).<br>
Therefore, until the open area 240h of the holder 24h<br>
and the open area 110h of the holder 11h fully face each other<br>
(stand face to face) , the second permanent magnet 5 and third<br>
permanent magnet 6 do not generate a repulsive force due to<br>
homopolarity (S poles).<br>
[0070]<br>
Fig. 11 shows a condition that the second permanent<br>
magnet 5 turns by a prescribed angle A in the area below line<br>
24Lc and the open area 240h of the holder 24h and the open area <br>
110h of the holder 11h fully face each other (stand face to<br>
face).<br>
In the condition shown in Fig. 11, since the S poles of<br>
the permanent magnets 5 and 6 fully face each other and the<br>
permanent magnets 5 and 6 repel each other, a repulsive force<br>
F1 is generated. A component force F2 is generated on the<br>
second permanent magnet 5 side and the component force F2 gives<br><br>
the arm member 24 a counterclockwise torque. Since the arm<br>
member 24 is fixed on the disk member 22, given a torque to<br>
the arm member 24, rotation of the disk member 22 is encouraged.<br>
[0071]<br>
As explained above, in the structure shown in Figs. 8<br>
to 11, since the permanent magnets 5 and 6 are covered by the<br>
holders 24h and 11h, until the open area 240h of the holder<br>
24h and the open area 110h of the holder 11h fully face each<br>
other (stand face to face) , a repulsive force is not generated<br>
between the permanent magnets 5 and 6 and thus no resistance<br>
occurs to the torque of the arm member 24 and rotation of the<br>
disk member 22.<br>
Then, when the open area 240h of the holder 24h and the<br>
open area 110h of the holder 11h fully face each other (stand<br>
face to face), a repulsive force is generated between the<br>
permanent magnets 5 and 6 but in this condition, the repulsive<br>
force works to encourage rotation of the arm member 24 or<br>
rotation of the disk member 22.<br>
[0072]<br>
Fig. 12 shows a variation of the structure illustrated<br>
in Figs. 8 to 11.<br>
The variation in Fig. 12 is different from the structure<br>
in Figs. 8 to 11 in terms of holder open areas and permanent<br>
magnet halving planes, resulting in a difference in the effect<br>
of encouraging rotation of the arm 24.<br>
[0073]<br>
In Fig. 12, when the center of the second permanent magnet<br><br>
5 is on line 24Lc, the open area 240k of the holder 24k for<br>
covering the second permanent magnet 5 and the open area 110k<br>
of the holder 11k for covering the third permanent magnet 6<br>
are both symmetrical with respect to line 24Lc in Fig. 12 as<br>
the axis of symmetry, vertically in Fig. 12.<br>
[0074]<br>
Also, the plane of dividing the second permanent magnet<br>
5 into S pole 5S and N pole 5N is inclined upward to the left<br>
in Fig. 12 and similarly the plane of dividing the third<br>
permanent magnet 6 into S pole 6S and N pole 6N is inclined<br>
upward to the left in Fig. 12.<br>
In the second permanent magnet 5, only the N pole 5N is<br>
exposed through the open area 240k. On the other hand, in the<br>
third permanent magnet 6, mainly the N pole 6N is exposed<br>
through the open area 110k but the S pole 6S is also partially<br>
exposed.<br>
[0075]<br>
In Fig. 12, as far as the second permanent magnet 5 is<br>
concerned, a repulsive force F3 against the N pole 6N of the<br>
third permanent magnet 6 (repulsive force between the magnetic<br>
poles 5N and 6N) and an attractive force F4 between the N pole<br>
5N of the second permanent magnet 5 and the S pole of the third<br>
permanent magnet 6 are generated simultaneously.<br>
The attractive force F4 has a component force F5 in the<br>
rotation direction R and such component force F5 works to rotate<br>
the second permanent magnet 5 toward arrow R. Consequently,<br>
generation of the component force F5 in the direction of arrow<br><br>
R in the attractive force F4 between the N pole 5N of the second<br>
permanent magnet 5 and the S pole of the third permanent magnet<br>
6 leads to encouragement of rotation of the second permanent<br>
magnet 5 in the direction of arrow R.<br>
[0076]<br>
In addition, when the second permanent magnet 5 moves<br>
downward from the position shown in Fig. 12 (toward arrow R:<br>
toward the rotation direction) , the repulsive force F3 between<br>
the N pole 5N of the second permanent magnet 5 and the N pole<br>
of the third permanent magnet 6 works so that an effect of<br>
encouraging rotation of the second permanent magnet 5 or arm<br>
24 in the direction of arrow R is achieved as in the structure<br>
shown in Figs. 9 to 11.<br>
[0077]<br>
Again in Fig. 2, a box type holding member 7 is mounted<br>
on the upper surface of the middle frame 12 and in the center<br>
area through which the rotary shaft 21 penetrates, and the<br>
bottom of the holding member 7 is open. The upper surface of<br>
the holding member 7 is a flat plane and is parallel to, and<br>
spaced a given distance from, the lower surface of the disk<br>
member 22.<br>
The upper surface of the holding member 7 has a through<br>
hole which allows the rotary shaft 21 to rotate freely.<br>
[0078]<br>
An annular fourth permanent magnet 8 is mounted on the<br>
back surface of the disk member 22 in a way to surround the<br>
rotary shaft 21. On the other hand, an annular fifth permanent<br><br>
magnet 9 almost similar in shape to the fourth permanent magnet<br>
8 is mounted on the upper surface of the holding member 7 in<br>
a way to surround the rotary shaft 21.<br>
Although not clearly shown, the fourth permanent magnet<br>
8	is fitted to the back (lower) surface of the disk member 22<br>
by a stainless steel stay (not shown) and the fifth permanent<br>
magnet 9 is also fitted to the fixed member 1 by a stainless<br>
steel stay (not shown).<br>
[0079]<br>
The fourth permanent magnet 8 and the fifth permanent<br>
magnet 9 are arranged so that their surfaces facing each other<br>
have the same polarity. However, the permanent magnets 8 and<br>
9	are spaced a given distance from each other in consideration<br>
of ease in attachment and detachment.<br>
[0080]<br>
Since the fourth permanent magnet 8 and the fifth<br>
permanent magnet 9 are provided and the fourth permanent magnet<br>
8 and the fifth permanent magnet 9 are arranged opposite to<br>
each other and their surfaces facing each other have the same<br>
polarity, the fourth permanent magnet 8 and the fifth permanent<br>
magnet 9 repel each other. Such a repulsive force works so<br>
as for the whole rotary member 2 to float from the fixed member<br>
1.<br>
As a consequence, friction caused by the thrust which<br>
the weight of the rotary member 2 exerts on the fixed member<br>
1 is reduced, which further decreases the loss in the rotating<br>
mechanism 100 and makes it a more efficient rotating mechanism.<br><br>
[0081]<br>
Furthermore, once the rotary member 2 has started<br>
rotating on the principle of Aragon's disk, an eddy current<br>
occurs in the fourth permanent magnet 8. This eddy current<br>
works to rotate the fourth permanent magnet 8, or the rotary<br>
member 2.<br>
In short, once the rotary member 2 has been rotated, a<br>
force which rotates the rotary member 2 further is exerted.<br>
Here, on the principle of Aragon' s disk, a similar effect<br>
is achieved even if the material of the rotary member 2 is<br>
changed from aluminum to synthetic resin.<br>
[0082]<br>
By moving the fifth permanent magnet 9 vertically in Fig.<br>
2 by a lifting means (not shown) , the relative distance between<br>
the fourth permanent magnet 8 and the fifth permanent magnet<br>
9 can be steplessly adjusted and thus the effect of the eddy<br>
current can be adjusted. The rotation speed of the rotary<br>
member 2 can also be controlled by providing a means for<br>
adjusting the force generated by the effect of the eddy current<br>
and providing another attracting means such as magnet on the<br>
rotary member 2.<br>
The lifting means for the fifth permanent magnet 9 and<br>
the attracting means may be activated by a hydraulic means.<br>
[0083]<br>
Next, a first variation of the embodiment illustrated<br>
in Figs. 1 to 11 will be described referring to Figs. 13 to<br>
16.<br><br>
Here, in Figs. 13 to 16, a whole rotating mechanism is<br>
represented by reference numeral 100B.<br>
[0084]<br>
The embodiment shown in Figs. 1 to 11 includes a plurality<br>
of first permanent magnets 4 mounted on the disk member 22 and<br>
arranged annularly and a plurality of coils 3 mounted on the<br>
fixed member 1 and arranged annularly on the radially inner<br>
side of the first permanent magnets.<br>
On the other hand, the first variation shown in Figs.<br>
13 to 16 (rotating mechanism 100B) includes a plurality of<br>
second coils 3B which are mounted on a circumference (on a<br>
circumference whose distance from the rotation center point<br>
0 is constant) at regular intervals on the radially outer side<br>
of the first permanent magnets 4B arranged annularly and<br>
mounted on the disk member 22, in addition to the embodiment<br>
in Figs. 1 to 11.<br>
[0085]<br>
Fig. 13 is a plan view of the first variation; Fig. 14<br>
is a sectional view taken along Y-Y in Fig. 13; Fig. 15 is an<br>
enlarged fragmentary view of what is shown in Fig. 13; and Fig.<br>
16 is an enlarged fragmentary view of what is shown in Fig.<br>
14.<br>
In Fig. 16, a coil bracket lllf is mounted on a canopy<br>
lie of the upper frame 11 on the radially outer side of a coil<br>
bracket 11f and a second coil 3B is fitted to the coil bracket<br>
lllf.<br>
[0086]<br><br>
In the first variation shown in Figs. 13 to 16, by<br>
doubling the number of coils, the magnetic repulsive force<br>
between the first permanent magnet and the coils 3, 3B is<br>
increased, thereby improving the torque of the disk member 22.<br>
[0087]<br>
Next, a second variation of the embodiment illustrated<br>
in Figs. 1 to 11 will be described referring to Fig. 17.<br>
Here, a whole rotating mechanism shown in Fig. 17<br>
according to the second variation is represented by reference<br>
numeral 101C.<br>

As compared with the embodiment shown in Figs. 1 to 11<br>
(Fig. 4 in particular) which has a combination of a coil 3 and<br>
a permanent magnet 4 in only one tier vertically (in Fig. 4),<br>
the second variation in Fig. 17 has a combination of a coil<br>
3	and a permanent magnet 4 vertically in two tiers in Fig. 17.<br>
[0089]<br>
In Fig. 17, the size of the coil mounting bracket 11f fixed on the upper frame 11 is large vertically in Fig. 17 and<br>
two coils 3 are fitted to the bracket 11f vertically in two<br>
tiers.<br>
On the other hand, a bracket 23 for permanent magnets<br>
4	is fixed on the upper surface of the disk member 22 or the<br>
second arm member 24C and the size of the bracket 23 is also<br>
large vertically and two permanent magnets 4, 4, or an upper<br>
and a lower one, are fitted to the bracket 23.<br>
[0090]<br><br>
The upper and lower coils 3, 3 on the coil mounting<br>
bracket 11f and the upper and lower permanent magnets 4, 4 on<br>
the permanent magnet bracket 23 are arranged so as to fully<br>
face each other and the magnetic field generated in the coils<br>
3,	3 and the magnetic field generated in the permanent magnets<br>
4,	4 repel each other and this magnetic repulsive force<br>
encourages rotation of the disk member 22.<br>
The rest of the structure is the same as in the embodiment<br>
shown in Figs. 1 to 11.<br>
[0091]<br>
Next, a third variation of the embodiment illustrated<br>
in Figs. 1 to 11 will be described referring to Fig. 18.<br>
In Fig. 18 which shows the third variation, a whole<br>
rotating mechanism is represented by reference numeral 100C.<br>

variation in Fig. 18 also has a combination of a coil 3 and<br>
a permanent magnet 4 vertically in two tiers, like the second<br>
variation in Fig. 17. However, while in Fig. 17, coils or<br>
permanent magnets are mounted on a single bracket vertically<br>
in two tiers, the rotating mechanism 100C in Fig. 18 has two<br>
disk members (represented by reference numerals 22, 22CinFig.<br>
18) .<br>
[0093]<br>
In Fig. 18, a horizontal member 11C is provided below<br>
the disk member 22 and the horizontal member 11C is provided<br>

frame 11. A hub 20 is fixed below the horizontal member 11C<br>
and the second disk member 22C is fitted to the hub 20.<br>
[0094]<br>
Coil mounting brackets 11f are fixed not only on the upper<br>
frame 11 but also to the back surface of the horizontal member<br>
11C and coils 3 are mounted on the brackets llf.<br>
Permanent magnet side brackets 23 are fixed not only on<br>
the disk member 22 but also the upper surface of the second<br>
disk member 22C and permanent magnets 4 are mounted on the<br>
brackets 23.<br>
The coil 3 located on the back surface of the horizontal<br>
member 11C and the permanent magnet 4 located on the upper<br>
surface of the second disk member 22C fully face each other<br>
as shown in Fig. 18 and a repulsive force between the magnetic<br>
fields generated by both impels rotation of the second disk<br>
member 22C.<br>
[0095]<br>
The fourth permanent magnet 8 to let the rotary member<br>
2 float is mounted on the back surface of the second disk member<br>
22C in a way to face the fifth permanent magnet 9 to reduce<br>
the thrust caused by the weight of the rotary member 2.<br>
The rest of the structure is the same as in the embodiment<br>
shown in Figs. 1 to 11.<br>
[0096]<br>
Next, a fourth variation of the embodiment illustrated<br>

Here, a whole rotating mechanism according to a second<br><br>
embodiment is represented by reference numeral 101D.<br>
[0097]<br>
As shown in Fig. 19, the rotating mechanism 101D<br>
according to the fourth variation or the second embodiment in<br>
Fig. 19 has a combination of a first permanent magnet 4B and<br>
two coils 3, 3B vertically in two tiers, while the first<br>
variation (rotating mechanism 100B) in Figs. 13 to 16 (see Fig.<br>
16 in particular) has a combination of a first permanent magnet<br>
4B and two coils 3, 3B vertically in only one tier.<br>
[0098]<br>
In Fig. 19, coil mounting brackets 11f and lllf are<br>
mounted on the upper fame (canopy lie) at different radial<br>
distances and coils 3, 3 are mounted on each of the brackets<br>
llf, lllf vertically in two tiers.<br>
In addition, a bracket 23 for permanent magnets 4 is fixed<br>
on the upper surface of the disk member 22 (the upper surface<br>
of the arm member 24 in the cross section shown in Fig. 19)<br>
and first permanent magnets 4B, 4B are located on the bracket<br>
23 vertically in two tiers.<br>
The rest of the structure in the second embodiment in<br>
Fig. 19 is the same as in the first variation.<br>
[0099]<br>
Next, a fifth variation of the embodiment illustrated<br>
in Figs. 1 to 11 will be described referring to Fig. 20.<br>
A whole rotating mechanism according to the third<br>
embodiment is represented by reference numeral 100D in Fig.<br>
20.<br><br>
[0100]<br>
As shown in Fig. 20, the rotating mechanism 100D<br>
according to the third embodiment has a combination of a first<br>
permanent magnet 4B and two coils 3, 3B vertically in two tiers,<br>
like the second embodiment shown in Fig. 19.<br>
[0101]<br>
In the third embodiment in Fig. 20, regarding a<br>
combination of a first permanent magnet 4B and two coils 3,<br>
3B, the upper combination is the same as shown in Fig. 16.<br>
In order to add a lower combination of a permanent magnet<br>

provided below the disk member 22 and the horizontal member<br>
11C is provided as a fixed member parallel to the disk member<br>
22 and the upper frame 11, like the third variation in Fig.<br>
18. A hub 20 is fixed below the horizontal member 11C and the<br>
second disk member 22C is mounted on the hub 20.<br>
[0102]<br>
The way the coils are mounted on the horizontal member<br>
11C and the way the permanent magnet is mounted on the second<br>
disk member 22C are the same as in the first variation shown<br>
in Fig. 16.<br>
The rest of the structure in the third embodiment in Fig.<br>
20 is the same as in the first variation in Fig. 16.<br>
[0103]<br>
Although not shown, in the rotating mechanism 100<br>
according to the first embodiment, the rotating mechanism 100B<br>
according to the first variation, the rotating mechanism 100C<br><br>
according to the third variation, the rotating mechanism 101D<br>
according to the second embodiment, and the rotating mechanism<br>
100D according to the third embodiment, the whole apparatus<br>
may be covered by concrete or a metal plate or a rigid plastic<br>
structure so that the air pressure inside the covered space<br>
is reduced to reduce the air resistance in rotation and thereby<br>
make it a rotating mechanism with a higher rotation efficiency.<br>
[0104]<br>
Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will<br>
be described referring to Figs. 21 and 22.<br>
A whole rotating mechanism according to the second<br>
embodiment is represented by reference numeral 100E in Figs.<br>
21 and 22.<br>
[0105]<br>
In Figs. 21 and 22, the rotating mechanism 100E is so<br>
structured that the coils 3 and first permanent magnets 4 in<br>
the rotating mechanism 100 in Figs. 1 to 11 are omitted and<br>
rotation of the rotary member 2 is maintained only by the<br>
magnetic repulsive force between second permanent magnets 5<br>
fitted to three arm members 24 of the rotary member 2 and two<br>
third permanent magnets 6 fitted to the fixed member 1.<br>
[0106]<br>
In the second embodiment in Figs. 21 and 22 as well, like<br>
the embodiment in Figs. 1 to 11, a second permanent magnet 5<br>
is fitted to an arm member 24 of the rotary member 2 by an<br>
attachment 24a and a third permanent magnet 6 is fitted to the<br>
fixed member 1 by an attachment llg.<br><br>
Although not clearly shown in Figs. 21 and 22, the second<br>
permanent magnet 5 and the third permanent magnet 6 are provided<br>
with a movable cover for adjusting the orientation or magnitude<br>
of the magnetic force, and the movable cover has the same<br>
structure as the holders 11h, 24h in Figs. 8 to 11 and works<br>
similarly.<br>
[0107]<br>
In Fig. 21, a fourth permanent magnet (one magnet to let<br>
the rotary member 2 float) 8 is fitted below the disk member<br>
22 on the rotary shaft 21 and a fifth permanent magnet (one<br>
magnet to let the rotary member 2 float) 9 is fitted below it.<br>
[0108]<br>
A first sprocket SI is fixed on the rotary shaft 21 below<br>
the fixed fifth permanent magnet 5 (one magnet to let the rotary<br>
member 2 float) 9.<br>
A small motor M for starting the rotary member 2 is<br>
mounted on the lower frame 13 of the fixed member 1. A second<br>
sprocket S2 is fitted to the tip of the output axis of the motor<br>
M.<br>
[0109]<br>
The first sprocket SI and the second sprocket S2 are<br>
engaged through a chain Cn.<br>
As the motor M is driven, rotational output of the motor<br>
M is transmitted through the second sprocket S2, chain Cn and<br>
first sprocket SI to the rotary shaft 21 to rotate the rotary<br>
shaft 21.<br>
[0110]<br><br>
The structure and advantageous effects of the second<br>
embodiment in Figs. 21 and 22 other than the abovementioned<br>
are the same as in the first embodiment in Figs. 1 to 11.<br>
[0111]<br>
Next, a third embodiment will be described referring to<br>
Figs. 23 and 24.<br>
A whole rotating mechanism according to the third<br>
embodiment is represented by reference numeral 100F in Figs.<br>
23 and 24.<br>
The rotating mechanism 100F according to the third<br>
embodiment in Figs. 23 and 24 is applied to electrical<br>
generators.<br>
[0112]<br>
In Fig. 23, the fixed member of the rotating mechanism<br>
100 includes: a cylindrical casing IF; a top cover lFt for<br>
covering the upper opening of the casing IF; a base 14F for<br>
covering the lower opening of the casing IF; and a partition<br>
15F located in the middle of the casing IF.<br>
[0113]<br>
A radial bearing 16 is provided in the center of the top<br>
cover lFt and a thrust bearing 18 is provided in the center<br>
of the partition 15F and the rotary shaft 21F is journalled<br>
by the radial bearing 16 and thrust bearing 18.<br>
A rotor (or disk member) 22F is fixed on an upper portion<br>
of the rotary shaft through a hub 20.<br>
[0114]<br>
An annular magnet mounting member 4B which is concentric<br><br>
with the rotary shaft 21 is provided on the radially outer rim<br>
of the back surface of the rotor 22F. A plurality of first<br>
permanent magnets 4F are fitted all around the inner periphery<br>
of the magnet mounting member 14B.<br>
A fourth permanent magnet 8 is located in a radially inner<br>
area (center area) of the back surface of the rotor 22F in a<br>
way to surround the rotary shaft 21F.<br>
[0115]<br>
A plurality of second permanent magnets 5F are fitted<br>
at regular intervals in a radially outer area of the upper<br>
surface of the rotor 22F on a circumference concentric with<br>
the rotary shaft 21 all around the circumference.<br>
A plurality of third permanent magnets 6F are fitted at<br>
regular intervals radially outside the second permanent<br>
magnets 5F all around the circumference.<br>
[0116]<br>
A coil supporting member 31F for supporting a disk coil<br>
3F for electricity generation is provided in an area between<br>
the rotor 22F and the partition 15F. The coil supporting<br>
member 31F is located at the upper end of a cylindrical part<br>
15Fc in the center of the partition 15F. The coil supporting<br>
member 31F is formed integrally with the partition 15F.<br>
[0117]<br>
A movable partition 91 is located in the area between<br>
the coil supporting member 31F and the partition 15F. This<br>
movable partition 91 is so structured as to slide on the inner<br>
wall surface of the cylindrical casing IF by a hydraulic means<br><br>
(not shown) while keeping a liquid-tight condition.<br>
In the center of the movable partition 91, an annular<br>
fifth permanent magnet 9 is fitted in a way to surround the<br>
rotary shaft 21F. Hence, as the movable partition 91 moves<br>
vertically in Fig. 23, the fifth permanent magnet 9 also moves<br>
up and down vertically in Fig. 23.<br>
[0118]<br>
The surfaces of the fourth permanent magnet 8 and fifth<br>
permanent magnet 9 which face each other are so structured as<br>
to have the same polarity and repel each other. Hence, as the<br>
fifth permanent magnet 9 is brought closer to the fourth<br>
permanent magnet 8, buoyancy is given to the rotary member and<br>
the buoyancy works to decrease the thrust exerted on the thrust<br>
bearing 18 and reduce the rotation resistance.<br>
In the electrical generator having the rotating<br>
mechanism 100E according to the second embodiment in Figs. 21<br>
and 22, the electrical generating efficiency can be improved<br>
by reducing the resistance which suppresses rotation.<br>
[0119]<br>
Next, a fourth embodiment will be described referring<br>
to Figs. 25 and 26.<br>
A whole rotating mechanism according to the fourth<br>
embodiment is represented by reference numeral 100G in Figs.<br>
25 and 26.<br>
The rotating mechanism 100G according to the fourth<br>
embodiment in Figs. 25 and 26 is applied to an electrical<br>
generator with a Darius windmill.<br><br>
[0120]<br>
In Fig. 25, the rotating mechanism 100G includes: a<br>
casing 1G; a rotary shaft 21G disposed in the center of the<br>
casing 1G; a fixed cylindrical coil 6G located in a way to<br>
surround the rotary shaft 21G; and a Darius windmill 300 which<br>
rotates together with the rotary shaft 21G.<br>
[0121]<br>
Fig. 26 is a sectional view taken along X-X in Fig. 25.<br>
Although not clearly shown, a spiral groove 5G is formed in<br>
the rotary shaft 21G and the groove 5G is coated with liquid<br>
magnet and sealed by a cover-like member (not shown).<br>
The upper end of the rotary shaft 21G is journalled by<br>
a bearing (radial bearing, not shown) provided on an upper<br>
member 11G of the casing and the lower end of the rotary shaft<br>
21G is journalled by a bearing (composite bearing as a<br>
combination of a radial bearing and a thrust bearing, not shown)<br>
provided on a lower member 13G of the casing.<br>
[0122]<br>
In the rotating mechanism 100G thus structured, when a<br>
force of wind rotates the windmill 300, the spiral groove 5G<br>
coated with liquid magnet, spirally disposed inside the<br>
cylindrical coil 6G, rotates as well and due to the relative<br>
rotary motion of the cylindrical coil 6G and magnet 5G, an<br>
induced current (electricity generating current) is generated.<br>
Since any ferrous metal that is attracted to the magnet is not<br>
used here, electricity can be generated easily.<br>
The generating current generated in the coil 6G is stored<br><br>
in a battery 400 located at the bottom of the casing 1G.<br>
Since the rotating mechanism 100G does not use any ferrous metal, if a weak<br>
wind rotates the rotary shaft, electricity can be generated.<br>
Also, by doubling the windmill shaft and journalling the outer shaft by a<br>
bearing and using the thrust for internal rotation, thrust bearing rotation<br>
resistance caused by the weight of the windmill 300 can be reduced and<br>
resistance in rotation of the windmill 300 can be substantially reduced. As a<br>
consequence, the efficiency as an electrical generator can be increased.<br>
It is added that the illustrated embodiments are for illustrative purposes only<br>
and the foregoing description is not intended to limit the technical scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
