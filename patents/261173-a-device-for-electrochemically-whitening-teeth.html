FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to electrochemically whitening teeth, and more particularly, to a method and device for electrochemically whitening teeth. The present invention is based on applying an oxidizing agent to teeth, combined with transmitting a saf., low level electrical current directly to the teeth, for a short period of time, for effecting the teeth whitening (via electrochemical activation and redox reactions). Implementation of the present invention provides excellent control of safely applying, delivering, or dispensing, of a teeth whitening oxidizing agent to teeth, and involves minimal exposure of non-tooth intra-oral cavity components, e.g., gum and tissue exterior surfaces, to the oxidizing agent. The present invention is simple and inexpensive to manufacture, and is simple, safe, and inexpensive, to implement either by a dental health provider alongside a subject to be treated in a denta) health office, or by a subject itself outside of a dental health office, and is commercially applicable.<br>
Whitenine teeth (teeth whitenins)<br>
In the context of the field and art of the present invention, 'whitening teeth' (or teeth whitening) generally refers to application of any number of chemical {e.g., oxidation, reduction) or/and physical (e.g., mechanical, thermal, irradiation, electrical) processes, procedures, techniques, or treatments, performed singly or in combination, which results in reluming, or/and providing, white color to teeth (i.e., to a single tooth, or to two or more teeth).<br>
There exists a plethora of prior art teachings of a wide variety of different chemical or/and physical processes, procedures, techniques, or treatments, performed singly or in combination, for whitening teeth, where each prior art teaching features different particular advantages and disadvantages.<br>
For example, PR 2 873 297 relates to a device for whitening teeth using electro-optical and chemical means, comprising an active product activated by light or by heat. HP 1 457 200 relates to a dental bleaching method employing a titanium oxide based agent together with a compound producing hydrogen peroxide, and irradiating them.<br>
Use of hydrogen peroxide, or/and other relatively strong oxidizing agents, at appropriate concentrations and conditions of oral application or treatment, for whitening teeth, are most<br><br>
commonly taught about and practiced. For example, EP 1 525 857 relates to a device for cleaning teeth which electrolylically generates oxidation species in situ. During such 'chemical oxidation' type teeth whitening techniques, teeth are exposed to the oxidizing agent(s), whereby the oxidizing agent(s) is/are reduced, and in turn, oxidize, and possibly also chemically degrade, various substances (mostly composed of organic matter) which discolor teeth. However, applications of such techniques for whitening teeth are typically accompanied by inadvertent or unpreventable, and undesirable, exposure of non-tooth intra-oral cavity components, e.g., gum and tissue exterior surfaces, to the oxidizing agent(s), or/and to the means used for applying, delivering, or dispensing, the oxidizing agent(s) to the teeth. Additionally, applications of such techniques for whitening teeth usually require implementation by a dental health provider alongside a subject to be treated in a denta! health office, and are usually not implementable by a subject itself outside of a dental health office.<br>
In spite of the vast amounts of prior art teachings of using oxidizing agents in techniques for whitening teeth, there remains an on-going need for improving existing techniques, and identifying new techniques, which improve control of applying, delivering, or dispensing, of teeth whitening oxidizing agents to teeth, and which involve minimal exposure of non-tooth intra-oral cavity components, e.g., gum and tissue exterior surfaces, to the oxidizing agents, as well as to the means used for applying, delivering, or dispensing, the oxidizing agents to the teeth.<br>
There is thus a widely recognized need for, and it would be highly advantageous to have, a method and device for electrochemical ly whitening teeth, which are devoid of the above stated, and of various other, limitations and disadvantages. There is also need for such an invention whose implementation provides excellent control of safely applying, delivering, or dispensing, of a teeth whitening oxidizing agent to teeth, and involves minimal exposure of non-tooth intra-oral cavity components, e.g., gum and tissue exterior surfaces, to the oxidizing agent. Moreover, there is need for such an invention which is simple and inexpensive to manufacture, which is simple, safe, and inexpensive, to implement either by a dental health provider alongside a subject to be treated in a dental health office, or by a subject itself outside of a dental health office, and which is commercially applicable.

The present invention relates to a method and device for electrochemically whitening teeth.<br>
Electrochemistn.' theory, principles, and practices thereof, and, related and associated applications and subjects thereof, are well known and taught about in the prior art. and currently practiced in a wide variety of numerous different fields and areas of technology. For the purpose of establishing the scope, meaning, and fietd(s) or area(s) of application, of the present invention, herein following are provided selected definitions and exemplary usages of terminology which are relevant to, and used for, disclosing the present invention. Electrochemistry - oxidation, reduction, and ionization, reactions<br>
The term 'electrochemistry' is generally defined as the science that deals with the use of electrical energy to bring about a chemical reaction or with the generation of electrical energy by means of chemical action. Moreover, if a chemical reaction is caused by an external voltage, or if a voltage is caused by a chemical reaction, then, the chemical reaction is an electrochemical reaction.<br>
In general, electrochemistrj' deals with oxidation, reduction, and ionization, types of chemical reactions. In general, an oxidation reaction is a chemical reaction which is based on the loss of an electron by a chemical species (atom, molecule, radical, or ion). In general, a reduction reaction is a chemical reaction which is based on the gain of an electron by a chemical species {atom, molecule, radical, or ion). A paired or complementary set of an oxidation reaction and a reduction reaction is commonly referred to as a 'redox' reaction. In general, ionization refers to the process of converting a chemical species (atom, molecule, radical) into an ion, and also refers to the state of a chemical species (atom, molecule, radical) being ionized, where an ion is an atom, a group of atoms, or a molecule, having a net (positive or negative) electrical charge. In general, an 'ionizable substance' refers to a substance which either is, or includes, a chemical species (atom, molecule, radical), that can be ionized, such that there is a change in the net electrical charge of the chemical species which is ionized.<br>
In general, an 'oxidizing agent', also known as an oxidizer or as an oxidant, refers to a chemical compound that readily gives up (atomic or/and molecular) oxygen. An oxidizing agent also refers to a substance that gains (receives) electrons in a redox chemical reaction, whereby the oxidizing agent becomes reduced.<br><br>
As previously slated hereinabove, in the context of the field and art of the present invention, 'whitening teeth' (or teeth whitening) generally refers to application of any number of chemical (e.g., oxidation, reduction) or/and physical (e.g., mechanical, thermal, irradiation, electrical) processes, procedures, techniques, or treatments, performed singly or in combination, which resuhs in returning, or/and providing, white color to teeth (i.e., to a single tooth, or to two or more teeth).<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 1, which is an isometric view of a device 41, herein, also referred to as electrochemical teeth whitening device 41, which is suitable for electrochemical redox reactions which take place during application of an oxidizing agent to teeth, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Device 41 includes a treatment tray is designed to hold an oxidizing agent, for example, either being, or including, a form of hydrogen peroxide, such as a solution form of hydrogen peroxide, for immersion of teeth therein. In a non-limiting manner, some additional examples of an oxidizing agent are seiected from the group consisting of a whitening solution, a whitening gel, a solution of or including carbamide peroxide, a gel of or including carbamide peroxide, a solution of or including sodium perborate, and a gel of or including sodium perborate.<br>
Device 41 is of a shape similar to typical dental trays, including a back curved wall 43 and a front curved wall 45 joined together at end sections 47. Space or well 55 is configured in between back curved wall 43 and front curved wall 45, and serves for holding or containing a substance, particularly, an oxidizing agent (such as hydrogen peroxide solution or gel, or similar type of oxidizing solution or gel) which is to be applied to the teeth. Back curved wall 43 includes an electrode 49 which is positively charged. Positively charged electrode 49 is comprised of a thin, flexible metal strip attached to an inner portion of back curved wall 43. In a preferred embodiment, positively charged electrode 49 is comprised of stainless steel. In alternative embodiments, electrode 49 is comprised of any inert, electricity conducting, material, such as, platinum, gold, or any other suitable electricity conducting metal, or metal platted with a metal plating. Spacers 51 are positioned along electrode 49, and are designed to preclude contact between electrode 49 and teeth positioned within device 41, while providing contact between the oxidizing agent, such as hydrogen peroxide solution, within device 41 and electrode 49. Spacers 51 are comprised of insulating materials, such as plastics.<br><br>
Front curved wall 45 includes contact electrodes 53, which are negatively charged electrodes, and are designed to be placed in direct contact with at least a part of the front of teeth within device 41. Negatively charged contact electrodes 53 are attached to front curved wall 45 by a spring-like mechanism, ensuring contact between contact electrodes 53 and at least part of the front of the teeth. Preferably, at least three contact electrodes 53 are used, each one designed to contact at least part of the front of a different tooth. The contact area between contact electrodes 53 and the teeth is minimized. In a preferred embodiment, device 41 fiirther includes a sealing lip 57.<br>
In alternative embodiments, device 41 is comprised of heatable plastics, which can be formed on the teeth and gums during placement. An adhesive or a repelling substance such as Vaseline^'^ may also be used to fiirther ensure sealing.<br>
