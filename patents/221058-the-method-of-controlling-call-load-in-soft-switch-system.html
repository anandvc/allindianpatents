A method of controlling call load in a soft switch system, characterized by comprising: receiving a congestion indication message in a basic calling module; deciding whether the system congestion indicated by the congestion indication message is in a type of burst or duration with the help of the basic calling module; and implementing control for starting call load by basic calling module according to the decision of the burst or duration type for the system congestion.<br>
Preferably, the step of deciding whether the system congestion indicated by the congestion indication message is in a type of burst or duration is implemented by using timer Tl and T2; the timer Tl is a shorter duration timer; the timer T2 is a longer duration timer.<br>
Preferably, the step of receiving a congestion indication message in a basic calling module further includes as follows: deciding whether or not it is first time for the basic calling module to receive a congestion indication message; if yes, setting a traffic load status as a lowest level of overload status, and initiating the timer Tl and T2.<br>
Preferably, the step of deciding whether the system congestion indicated by the congestion<br>
indication message is in a type of burst or duration, further includes: deciding whether the timer Tl<br>
and T2 is overtime or not; if the timer Tl is not overtime, implementing a normal call process in the<br>
basic calling module; if the timer Tl is overtime but the timer T2 is not overtime, which indicates that<br>
the system congestion indicated by the congestion indication message may be in a type of duration,<br>
reinitiating the timer Tl and T2; if the timer Tl is overtime but the timer T2 is not overtime, and the<br>
traffic load status is the highest level of overload status, sending a congestion alarm to an operation<br>
and maintenance system (OAM) from the basic calling module; if both the timer Tl and the timer T2<br>
are overtime, whicii indicates that the system congestion indicated by the congestion indication<br>
message is in a type of burst, reinitiating the timer T2; if both the timer Tl and the timer T2 are<br>
overtime and the traffic load status reaches normal status, implementing a normal call process in the<br>
basic calling module.<br>
Preferably, the step of implementing control for starting call load, further includes the<br><br>
steps as follows; refusing to accept non-emergency calls, when the system congestion<br>
indicated by congestion indication message is in a type of duration; and dropping the traffic<br>
load status down one level and decreasing a rate of refusing calls, when the system congestion<br>
indicated by congestion indication message is in a type of burst.<br>
Preferably, the step of refusing to accept non-emergency calls, further includes the steps<br>
as follows: moving the traffic load status up one level; counting a number of call requests<br>
received; working out a rate of refusing calls by using a traffic load controlling algorithm;<br>
refusing to accept non-emergency calls according to the rate of refusing calls.<br>
Preferable, the rate of refusing calls is in direct proportion to a number of calls that<br>
should be refused to accept except emergency calls; the rate of refusing calls is in inverse<br>
proportion to a number of calls that is counted subsequently after the current call requests is<br>
started to count; the number of calls that should be refused to accept except emergency calls is<br>
bigger than or equal to the number of calls that is counted subsequently after the current call<br>
request is started to count.<br>
Preferably, the traffic load control algorithm is calculated in accordance with a process<br>
load of the soft switch system in the IP network, and load of related data bearer network.<br>
Preferably, the process load of the soft switch system is obtained according to the<br>
following parameters: a rate of time occupied by CPU inside the soft switch system; traffic of<br>
communication for each software module inside the soft switch system; a average time delay<br>
for access of database inside the soft switch system; a memory capacity occupied by the call<br>
processing inside the soft switch system, and a percentage of free memory; and a process load<br>
percentage and message forwarding delay of communication process equipments inside the<br>
soft switch system.<br>
Preferably, the load of related data bearer network is obtained according to the following<br>
parameters: a traffic percentage of each date port, a communication delay in each router, a<br>
communication jitter in each router, a communication packet lost rate in each router, and<br>
»<br>
adjacent network traffic.<br>
•5"<br>
Preferably, the following conditions must be satisfied for controlling the traffic load by<br>
the traffic load control algorithm:<br>
emergency calls is ensured unblocked; calls from important users and priority users are<br>
ensured; calls from normal users are limited by a four level mode, in which call restraint rates<br>
are 50%, 75%, 87.5% and 100%; when traffic load is caused by a media stream, the soft<br>
switch system should shunt traffic of related date network, though soft switch itself is not<br>
overloaded; when traffic congestion is caused by a media stream, the coding mode of the<br>
media stream is controlled to reduce media traffic, for example, original G711 coding mode<br>
providing voice quality is changed into G732 or G729 mode adopting high compression rate.<br>
The active effect brought by the present invention is that the system has higher stability<br>
and reliability. Once traffic overload status occurs, connections with the maximum number of<br>
calls are ensured, and the system could be recovered to normal load status quickly. Normal<br>
call connections are not interrupted by soft modules, and connections for emergency calls for<br>
special services are not blocked by overloaded traffic. This method is suitable for wide.<br>
sk<br>
applications, and its traffic load control is smooth and effective with a adaptive overload<br>
control capability.<br>
Example embodiments will be described in details below with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings for further and comprehensive understanding for the object,<br>
characteristics and merits about the present invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
FIG l i s a flow chart depicting a basic calling module of a soft switch system in traffic<br>
overload status; and<br>
FIG 2 is a flow chart depicting a call process of a basic calling module.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
When the call traffic received by the soft switch system has exceeded the traffic load<br>
capability that the system can handle, a congestion indication message is sent to a basic<br>
calling module. No action is taken for all congestion indication messages received during<br>
timer Tl, and its purpose is to make ensure no quick drop for the system traffic and also be<br>
able to effectively identify whether the system is overloaded within duration of very short<br>
time.<br>
The present invention will be further described below with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
As shown as Fig.l, in step 101, it is checked whether or not the congestion indication<br>
message is received by the basic calling module for the first time. If yes, change the traffic<br>
load status of system and set it as the lowest level (step 102), and also set the two timers, Tl<br>
with a shorter duration and 12 with a longer duration (step 103).<br>
If no, it is checked whether the timer Tl is overtime and T2 is not overtime (step 104); if<br>
yes, the traffic load status of basic calling module is moved one level up (step 105), and then<br>
it is checked whether the traffic load added is beyond the maximum threshold or not (step<br>
106); If yes, the timers Tl and T2 is reinitiated (step 107); if no, which is explained that the<br>
system still has the congestion indication message although the traffic load status of the basic<br>
calling module has reached to the highest level, send the congestion indication message to<br>
OAM (step 108) ; then end the current service flow, and enter to a status of waiting message.<br>
If in step 104, the timer T2 is overtime, which is indicated that the congestion indication<br>
message has not been received during a duration of T2, the traffic load status is dropped one<br>
level down, and T2 is reinitiated; if at this time the T2 is overtime again, the traffic load status<br>
is dropped one level down again, until the traffic load status is recovered to a normal status; it<br>
is further checked whether neither the two timers Tl and T2 are overtime (step 109); if yes,<br>
enter directly to a waiting status; if no, the two timers Tl and T2 are reinitiated (step 110), and<br>
then enter to a waiting status.<br>
As shown as Fig.2, firstly it is checked whether the basic calling module has received a<br>
congestion indication message, namely whether currently the system has been in a status of<br>
traffic overload (step 201); if no, process calls normally (step 202); if yes, which is indicated<br>
that the system now has been in an overload status, set a current traffic load level (step 203),<br>
then set the corresponding algorithm according to the traffic load level (step 204) to work out<br>
the rate of refusing to accept non-emergency calls. The detail algorithm is as follows: starting<br>
from the current call, m calls should be refused to accept within subsequent n calls, (mS n), in<br>
which emergency calls should not be included in the m calls. Therefore, the rate of refusing<br>
to accept calls is:<br>
p = m/n<br>
The traffic load levels can be preset according to actual performance of the soft switch<br>
equipment. In general, p = 0, namely no calls need be refused. When the traffic load increases<br>
up to the status on which traffic load should be controlled, the value of p should be adjust to p<br>
&gt; 0. If at this time the traffic load still increases continuously, p should be increased<br>
continuously. When p = 1, it is indicated that all calls (except emergency calls) are restricted,<br>
in this way the system could always run in a preset safe range. Then run the step of refusing to<br>
accept non-emergency calls (step 205).<br>
Thus, the service flow is ended and the system enters into a status of waiting message.<br>
In the present invention, the algorithm for controlling traffic load is worked out<br>
according to the process load of the soft switch itself and the load of related data bearer<br>
network.<br>
The process load of the soft switch itself can be obtained according to the following<br>
parameters:<br>
a rate of time occupied by CPU inside the soft switch system;<br>
a traffic of communication for each software module inside the soft switch system;<br>
a average time delay for access of database inside the soft switch system;<br>
a memory capacity occupied by the call processing inside the soft switch system, and the<br>
percentage of free memory; and<br>
«<br>
a process load percentage and message forwarding delay of communication process<br>
-ftequipment<br>
inside the soft switch system.<br>
The load of related data bearer network can be obtained according to the following<br>
parameters:<br>
a traffic percentage of each date port;<br>
a communication delay in each router;<br>
a communication jitter in each router;<br>
a communication packet lost rate in each router; and<br>
adjacent network traffic.<br>
The following principles should be included for controlling traffic load by the traffic load<br>
control algorithm:<br>
emergency calls (such as 110,119, 112) should be ensured unblocked;<br>
calls from important users and priority users (such as government departments, armed<br>
forces, and polices) should be ensured; calls from normal users are limited by a four level mode,<br>
in which call restraint rates are 50%, 75%, 87.5% and 100%;<br>
when traffic load is caused by a media stream (in a soft switch system, the soft switch solely<br>
completes call process, while the media stream switch is completed by data network), the soft<br>
switch system should shunt traffic of related date network though soft switch itself is not<br>
overloaded; and<br>
when traffic congestion is caused by a media stream, the coding mode of the media stream<br>
is controlled to reduce media traffic, for example, original G.711 coding mode providing voice<br>
quality is changed into G.732 or G.729 mode adopting high compression rate.<br>
All above description is only preferable embodiments of the present invention, which<br>
should not be seen as a limitation for the invention, and the scope of the invention claimed for<br>
protection shall not limited to these description. According to the technologies disclosed by the<br>
invention, any equivalent modifications and variances made by a person skilled in the art should<br>
fall into the scope claimed by the invention.<br><br>
