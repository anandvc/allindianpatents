FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This  invention  relates  to oral  insulin  microcapsules  and  a<br>
process for the preparation thereof.<br>
This invention further relates to oral insulin microcapsules based on chitosan, alginate and liposome and a process for the preparation thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Diabetes mellitus is a serious disease characterised by the body's inability to produce or respond properly to insulin) a hormone used to convert blood glucose (blood sugar) into energy. The diminished rate of Insulin sec retion by the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans leads to an elevation of blood glucose (hyoerglycemi a) . Each yea.ri diabetes contributes to considerable deaths through its complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, and stroke. Diabetes is also a leading contributor of new cases of blindness and amputat ions and is considered a costly disease . Appro* imately 4L'i*/. of the 1.35 mi 11 ion peopl e diagnosed with diabetes worldwide are rece iv ing insulin as a component of their therapy. Despite its widespread use, conventional subcu¬taneous insulin injection is more—or—less painful and incon¬venient, with poor patient acceptability. Significant inter patient and intra patient variability in absorpt ion, saw-tooth like insulin availab i1i ty in serum that leads to alternative hyperglye emia and hyperinsulinemia, and the risks of blood-borne infect ion  assoc iated  with repeated inject ions are some  of  the<br><br>
drawbacks. Other clinically available insulin delivery devices presently usedi such as pen injectors or external insulin pumps are probably under utilised, as they are inconvenient. Several research groups are pursuing permanent solution by transplanta¬tion or regeneration of pancreatic islet cells. The findings may lead to a therapy that can regenerate the pancreas but it will not be available at large scale before a long time. Some ongoing developments of nove1 ways of delivering insulin are orali nasal, ophthalmic and rectal. All these developments are either in early-stage of development or at pre-clinical testing stages. In India, also number of people afflicted with diabetes is in an increasing trend. However , treatments are mastly by insulin injections. Traditional medicines in India show the use of several plant-derived materials to reduce diabetes. Some groups are investigating ayurvedic oral formulations. These are mainly targeted to the regeneration of pancreatic cells in type II diabetes.<br>
An alternate method of insulin delivery has been the focus of research for past few decades. Oral administration has always been desirable for a patient perspecti ve as witnessed by the frequent need to explain to patients the difference between insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents. Oral de1i very appears as a simple, comfortable and physiological way of administration. However, like dietary proteins, peptide and protein drugs get digested by the proteolytic enzymes in the gastrointestinal  <gi></gi><br>
tract inhibiting its absorption. It has been reported that oral bioavailabilities of most free peptide and protein drugs are less than 1'/.. Therefore, an insulin formulation that can escape the harsh env ironment of the stomach intact and can deliver insulin in the neutral env i, ran merit of the intestine or colon for optimum bioavailability should be developed and optimized making oral admin istrat ion feasible.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It  is  therefore  an abject of this invention  to  propose  oral<br>
insulin  microcapsules for an alternative treatment  of  diabetes<br>
