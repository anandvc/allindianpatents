				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Traditional fire-fighting methods for fighting fires in storage vessels containing flammable liquids may require the application of a plurality of fire-fighting agents issued from one or more discharging apparatuses. These methods include:<br>
a)	Long range fire-fighting methods including fixed, semi-portable or portable systems that discharge fire-fighting agents from a position located afar from the storage vessel. These include fixed monitors, semi-portable monitors, fixed cannons, vehicle mounted cannons, hand held nozzles, etc.<br>
b)	Fixed systems permanently installed on the storage vessel. These include fixed foam chambers mounted on the roof of the storage vessel, circumferential discharge system or seal area protection systems on floating roof tanks, sub-surface injection systems, etc.<br>
c)	Portable systems that are used for mounting discharging apparatuses on the storage vessel.<br>
Each of these traditional fire-fighting methods possess certain limitations that can include one or more of the following:<br>
their effectiveness in the application of the fire-fighting agent;<br>
the operating system requirements;<br>
the costs associated with the acquisition of the fire-fighting equipment and necessary peripheral equipment;<br>
the costs associated with the operation of the equipment, namely the volume of fire-fighting agent consumed;<br>
the time required to extinguish the fire and resume normal operations; and<br>
the associated damages related to property, plant, equipment and lost production.<br>
The limitations of long range fire-fighting methods discussed in a) above, include the following:<br><br>
a significantly higher minimum system pressure is required for the fire-fighting<br>
agent to reach the surface of the flammable liquid in the storage vessel;<br>
the costs are significantly higher in acquiring, maintaining and operating firefighting<br>
equipment operating at these higher pressures;<br>
the radial component in the stream velocity is allowed more time to develop,<br>
hence dispersing the fluid flow, thereby increasing the cross-sectional impact area of the<br>
fire-fighting agent, thus decreasing the concentration of the fire-fighting agent, and<br>
finally reducing the effectiveness of the fire-fighting agent in arresting the fire;<br>
the atmospheric winds surrounding the vessel and the convective gases arisir g<br>
from the fire also contribute significantly to the dispersion of the fire-fighting agent<br>
thereby reducing the effectiveness of the fire-fighting agent in arresting the fire; and<br>
- the longer trajectory of the stream of the fire-fighting agent from the discharge<br>
point to the target area increases the amount of air dragged into the stream of the firefighting<br>
agent and onto the surface of the flammable liquid thereby increasing the<br>
oxygenation of the fire.<br>
The Industry has generally sought to address the above performance limitations in arresting the<br>
fire by increasing the rate of application of fire-fighting agents from 3,OOOGPM to 5,OOOGFM to<br>
10,OOOGPM, using a "surround and drown" approach. This method significantly increases the<br>
amounts of fire-fighting agents consumed and thereby the costs associated with extinguishing the<br>
fire.<br>
The limitations of fixed systems that are permanently installed on storage vessels,<br>
discussed in b) above, include the following:<br>
the foam chambers permanently installed on the roof of storage vessels,<br>
traditionally the first line of defense in the event of a fire, are highly vulnerable and are<br>
frequently rendered entirely inoperable in the initial phase of the conflagration when<br>
violent explosions may occur, and<br>
the Sub-surface injection systems can be rendered inoperable due to the effects of<br>
an explosion and more often due to clogging of the system.<br>
The limitations of portable systems that are used for mounting discharging apparatuses on<br>
the storage vessel, discussed in c) above, can include one or more of the following:<br>
they operate only with pre-mixtures of foam concentrate and water;<br>
they do not include apparatus for mixing the fire-fighting agents with a convening<br>
media;<br>
they are designed to discharge only one type of fire-fighting agent, for example<br>
foam;<br>
the foam discharge device is not detachable from the installation apparatus and<br>
therefore the installation of each discharge device requires its own installation apparatus;<br>
and<br>
they do not include an apparatus for the transportation of the entire system<br>
In view of the limitations of the traditional fire-fighting methods discussed above, thi<br>
applicants have developed a portable system for extinguishing fires in storage vessels containing<br>
flammable liquids that seeks to complement the positive performance aspects of these methods<br>
while addressing many of their core performance limitations<br>
There is therefore a need in the art for low-cost fire-lighting equipment that can be used<br>
to extinguish tires on or within a flammable substance in storage vessel. There is also a need for<br>
a system that is not permanently installed on the storage vessel so that the fire-fighting<br>
equipment is not damaged or destroyed by the explosions or conflagrations often associated with<br>
the initial stage of a lire There is also a need for a portable fire-fighting apparatus that does not<br>
attempt to spray fire-fighting agents from a remote position In addition, there is a need for<br>
lire-fighting apparatus that does not utilize costly high-pressure equipment.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY<br>
This disclosure relates to the mounting or placement of one or more portable discharging<br>
apparatuses on the top perimeter of a storage vessel that contains a flammable substance. The<br>
portable discharging apparatus is adapted to issue a fire-fighting agent, at relatively low<br>
pressures, at the top of the burning storage vessel so as to extinguish a fire. The fire-fighljing<br>
agent may be applied to the surface of the burning liquid either indirectly, by issuing the firefighting<br>
agent against the inner walls of the storage vessel, or directly into the burning surface.<br>
The portable discharging apparatus may be installed on the storage vessel with a portable<br>
installation apparatus that can repeatedly install a plurality of portable discharging apparatuses<br>
on a burning storage vessel. The portable discharging apparatus is suitable for use with a wide<br>
variety of storage vessels including, without limitation, cylindrical storage tanks, spherical<br>
storage tanks, storage basins, railcars, tractor-trailers, ships, and barges. The portable<br>
discharging apparatus discharges fire-fighting agents, such as fire-fighting foams, onto the<br>
surface of a storage vessel. The portable discharging apparatus may also discharge the firsfighting<br>
agents directly onto a surface of the burning substance itself. The fire-fighting agint<br>
may comprise any number of well known fire-fighting mixtures, such as foam concentrates and<br>
water, foam concentrates and air, powders in a conveying media, chemical agents, colloid:;, gels<br>
or other agents. One or more different types of fire-fighting agents can be applied to a fin; either<br>
simultaneously, or one at a time.<br>
The disclosed system comprises one or more portable discharging apparatuses thai can be<br>
removably mounted on a flammable liquid storage vessel for discharging at least one firelighting<br>
agent. The system may further comprise one or more portable installation apparatuses<br>
for installing said one or more portable discharging apparatuses on said storage vessel. Tl<br>
system may further comprise one or more transportation apparatuses for carrying at least one<br>
portable fire-fighting apparatus and at least one portable installation apparatus. The system may<br>
further comprise one or more fire-fighting agent conditioning apparatuses for preparing tht<br>
formulated proportions of the fire-fighting agents and the conveying media.<br>
Only one portable installation apparatus is required to be transported to the fire sit£ to<br>
removably mount a plurality of portable discharging apparatuses onto a storage vessel wall The<br>
disclosed system further provides a method for extinguishing fires by removably attaching lone or<br>
more portable discharging apparatus to a storage vessel for discharging a fire-fighting agent;<br>
providing a mobile installation apparatus for removably attaching one or more said portable<br>
discharging apparatus on said storage vessel; and providing a transportation apparatus for<br>
carrying at least one portable discharging apparatus and one mobile installation apparatus.<br>
The portable discharging apparatus, the portable installation apparatus and other<br>
accessories for issuing fire-fighting agents may be readily transported to the site of a fire. The<br>
portable installation apparatus is deployed near the burning vessel and is used to place one or<br>
more of the portable discharging apparatuses on the top perimeter of a storage vessel wall after<br>
the conflagration has begun and the possible violent explosive phase has passed. Once the<br>
portable discharging apparatus is removably mounted or placed on the wall, the portable<br>
installation apparatus may be removed without hindering the continued operation of the portable<br>
discharging apparatus After this, the portable installation apparatus may be used to mount other<br>
portable discharging apparatuses to the vessel or other vessels. Only one source of pressurized<br>
fluid (i.e conveying media) need by used with multiple portable discharging apparatuses.<br>
A portable discharging apparatus can comprise a hollow circular tube, referred to as| a<br>
discharge duct A discharge attachment may be attached to the discharge duct to aim the flow of<br>
the lire-fighting agent in a specific direction The discharge attachment may be connected to the<br>
discharge duct at a mating junction to aim the flow of the fire-fighting agent in other directions.<br>
A flow aillimator is attached to the other end of the discharge duct and provides a supply pf<br>
lire-lighting agents to the discharge duct The flow collimator may also include a jet strearri<br>
enhancer plate, which increases the flow velocity of the lire-lighting agent, thereby enhancing<br>
the mixing of the tire-fighting agent with inflowing air to efficiently aerate the fire-fighting<br>
agent Specifically, in the embodiment of a foam concentrate mixed with water as the firelighting<br>
agent, the collision of the foam concentrate mixture with the in flowing air generates a<br>
higher quality of lire-lighting foam<br>
The portable installation apparatus can also comprise a plurality of extendible sections so<br>
that the length of the apparatus may be adjusted to correspond to the height of a particular<br>
storage vessel Specifically, by extending the length of the telescopic mast of the portable<br>
installation apparatus, the portable discharging apparatus (or apparatuses) may be mounted or<br>
placed on storage vessels of a variety of heights The portable installation apparatus may a|so<br>
have a foldable compact configuration so that it can be readily transported as a pre-assembled<br>
structure that may be quickly unfolded at the location of a fire for rapid deployment and<br>
operation. Another advantage of the disclosed system is its lower acquisition and operational<br>
costs<br>
These and other advantages of the system for extinguishing fires will become apparent to<br>
those of ordinary skill in the art from the following detailed description, which refers to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Two components of a fire-fighting system according to one aspect of the invention are<br>
depicted in FIGURE 1A: a portable discharging apparatus 100 and a portable installation<br>
apparatus 105. The portable discharging apparatus 100 may be removably coupled to the<br>
portable installation apparatus 105 so that one or more of the portable discharging apparatuses<br>
100 can be mounted or placed on the top of a storage vessel 110. After the portable discharging<br>
apparatus 100 is mounted or placed on a storage vessel 110, fire-fighting agents are introduced<br>
into one end of the portable discharging apparatus and issued at the discharge end to extinguish a<br>
lire in the storage vessel<br>
The portable discharging apparatus 100 is comprised of several components, some of<br>
which are depicted in FIGURE 1A The depicted components include a receptacle duct 1 5, a<br>
How collimator 120, a discharge duct 125, and an arc-shaped flow discharge attachment HO. A<br>
supply hose 135 is attached to the flow collimator 120 to provide a supply of fire-fighting agents<br>
to the portable discharging apparatus 100. Also depicted in FIGURE 1A is a mixing apparatus<br>
140, adapted to mix the fire-fighting agent concentrate with a supply of a conveying medic in the<br>
required proportions before it is fed into the supply hose 135. Accordingly, a conveyance media<br>
supply line 142, and a fire-fighting agent supply line 144, are connected to the mixing apparatus<br>
140<br>
The portable installation apparatus 105 is also comprised of several components, some of<br>
which are also depicted in FIGURE 1 A. These components include a telescopic mast 150L a base<br>
tube 165 and a pair of lateral support struts 170. The telescopic mast 150, the base tube 65 and<br>
the lateral support struts 170 are arranged in a generally triangular shape to provide a simple and<br>
stable support for erecting the portable installation apparatus 105. A support rod 155 witi a<br>
horizontal control rod 160 is affixed to the top of the telescopic mast 150. The support rod 155<br>
and the support rod receptacle 175 join the portable discharging apparatus 100 to the poriable<br>
installation apparatus 105 Specifically, the portable discharging apparatus 100 may be<br>
removably coupled to the portable installation apparatus by inserting the support rod 155 into the<br>
support rod receptacle 175, which is permanently affixed to the receptacle duct 115. While the<br>
disclosed embodiment depicts a support rod 155 and a support rod receptacle 175 as the means<br>
by which the portable discharging apparatus 100 is attached to the portable installation apparatus<br>
105, other suitable coupling devices will be apparent to one of ordinary skills, such as a hook and<br>
eye bolt connection, or other such means. Some of the other components of the portable<br>
installation apparatus 105 are stabilizing rods 180, which may be coupled to the telescopic mast<br>
150 to provide stability and control during the installation of the portable discharging apparatus<br>
100. Also depicted are tether lines 185, which are connected to the ends of the horizontal control<br>
rod 160 to provide further stability and control for orienting the portable discharging apparatus<br>
during the installation process.<br>
Another aspect of the portable fire-fighting apparatus depicted in FIGURE 1A is an<br>
installation control system 190 that controls the flow of hydraulic fluid to the portable<br>
installation apparatus 105. The installation control system 190 provides bi-directional hydriulic<br>
fluid flow through the hydraulic line 192 to the telescopic mast 150. As this hydraulic fluid is<br>
supplied, the telescopic mast 150 will be extended, thereby lifting the portable discharging<br>
apparatus 100 until it reaches the height of the storage vessel 110. Similarly, by removing<br>
hydraulic fluid from the telescopic mast 150, it can be retracted. According to one embodi nent<br>
of the invention, hydraulic fluid is injected into or released from the hollow cavity of the<br>
telescopic mast 150 to either expand or contract the telescopic mast 150. The hydraulic fluid<br>
flows into and out of the cylindrical cavity though the hydraulic line 192 with a quick disconnect<br>
coupler that functions as a check valve at an orifice at the base of telescopic mast 150. Th
check valve operation is deactivated whenever the hydraulic line 192 is inserted into the quick<br>
disconnect coupler and activated when the hydraulic line 192 is removed from the quick<br>
disconnect coupler. Yet another aspect of the portable fire-fighting apparatus depicted in<br>
is a spacer member 194 that may be placed between the base tube 165 of the portable inst<br>
apparatus 105 and a wall of the storage vessel 110. The spacer member 194 is used to maintain a<br>
10<br>
ard<br>
distance between the portable installation apparatus 105 and the wall of the storage vessel<br>
during the installation of a portable discharging apparatus 100, thereby increasing the foru<br>
stability of the portable installation apparatus 105 as it raises or lowers the portable discharging<br>
apparatus 100<br>
A fully extended portable installation apparatus 105 is depicted in FIGURE IB wherein<br>
the telescoping sections of the telescopic mast 150 are fully extended. As described above, the<br>
extension and retraction of the telescopic mast is controlled by the installation control system<br>
190. According to the disclosed embodiment, the telescopic mast 150 of the portable installation<br>
'ig. 1A<br>
llation<br>
apparatus 105 is comprised of a plurality of axially concentric sliding hollow cylinders. The<br>
inner hollow cylinders slide out of the top-end of the outer cylinder to extend the telescopic mast<br>
along the common axis to the length required to reach the upper perimeter rim of the storage<br>
vessel 110. Wide varieties of means are known in the art and are available to extend or contract<br>
the inner cylinders of the telescopic mast 150.<br>
After the portable discharging apparatus 100 is lifted over the edge of the storage vessel<br>
110 and any fixed obstacles such as perimeter rails or cat walks, the telescopic mast 150 is<br>
lowered so as to locate the portable discharging apparatus 100 on the edge of the storage Vessel<br>
110.<br>
After the portable discharging apparatus 100 is mounted or placed on the storage v<br>
110, the portable installation apparatus 105 may be disengaged from the portable discharging<br>
apparatus 100 thereby leaving the portable discharging apparatus 100 mounted on the storage<br>
vessel 110. After the portable installation apparatus 105 has been used to place a portable<br>
discharging apparatus 100 on the storage vessel 110, it may be moved to different locations to<br>
successively mount a plurality of portable discharging apparatuses 100.<br>
FIGURE 1C depicts the assembly of the portable installation apparatus 105 and tlje<br>
portable discharging apparatus 100 according to one aspect of the invention. The portable<br>
installation apparatus 105 is shown with the telescopic mast 150 elevated at the distal end and<br>
supported using the support pedestal 198 for the purpose of facilitating the assembly process.<br>
A portable discharging apparatus 100 that has been mounted or placed on a storage vessel<br>
110 is depicted in FIGURE ID. A supply hose 135 remains connected to the portable<br>
discharging apparatus 100 so that the fire-fighting agent can be applied continuously to th<br>
storage vessel 110. Thus, after the portable discharging apparatus 100 is mounted or placed on<br>
the top of the storage vessel 110, it can function independently to provide fire-fighting agents<br>
without the portable installation apparatus 105.<br>
More than one portable discharging apparatus 100 may be mounted or placed on <..></..>
storage vessel 1 10. This embodiment is depicted in FIGURE IE where three separate portable<br>
discharging apparatuses 100 are mounted or placed on the storage vessel 110. This embodiment<br>
may be suitable for large surface-area vessels or for large fires, which may require the<br>
application of larger amounts of fire-fighting agents.<br>

Various embodiments of the portable discharging apparatus are depicted in FIGURES<br>
2A through 2H. FIGURE 2A depicts a side view of a portable discharging apparatus 100 in<br>
further detail. As described previously, the portable discharging apparatus 100 may be<br>
comprised of a flow collimator 120, a receptacle duct 115, a discharge,duct 125 and a support<br>
rod receptacle 175. Also depicted in FIGURE 2A are a first rigid device 205 and a second rigid<br>
device 210. These rigid devices 205 and 210 work in unison to provide the required orientation<br>
for the portable discharging apparatus 100 and for maintaining the positional stability of the<br>
portable discharging apparatus 100 on the upper edge of the storage vessel 110 wall. The<br>
portable discharging apparatus 100 can be stabilized in this position using various other coupling<br>
mechanisms, such as spring loaded stabilizers, clamps, magnets and other means known in tlu<br>
art. This embodiment of the portable discharging apparatus 100 is suited for orienting the flow of<br>
the fire-fighting agent directly onto the surface of the burning liquid in the storage vessel I K<br>
The portable discharging apparatus 100 is also equipped with connection means, connecting<br>
bolts 215 in this embodiment, that allow the connection of alternate attachments to the port,<br>
discharging apparatus 100.<br>
ble<br>
Another component that may be used with the portable discharging apparatus 100 is<br>
ent<br>
arc-shaped flow discharge attachment 130, a representative embodiment of which is depicted in<br>
FIGURE 2B. The discharge attachment 130 is used, to direct the flow of the fire-fighting<br>
being discharged from the portable discharging apparatus 100 in a specific direction to<br>
extinguish a fire. The arc-shaped flow discharge attachment 130 of FIGURE 2B is designec to<br>
be connected to the end of the discharge duct 125 by joining the connecting bQlts 215 with the<br>
eye and bolt 220 of the arc-shaped flow discharge attachment 130. A wide variety of other<br>
means for attaching the arc-shaped flow discharge attachment 130 to the discharging duct 1(25<br>
are known in the art and may be suitable for use with this invention, such as spring loaded<br>
tensors, buckles or other means.<br>
A portable discharging apparatus 100 that includes an arc-shaped flow discharge<br>
attachment 130 is depicted in FIGURE 2C wherein the portable discharging apparatus 100 is<br>
mounted onto the upper edge of the wall of a storage vessel 110. As the portable discharging<br>
apparatus 100 is mounted or placed on the storage vessel 110, the first rigid device 205 maintains<br>
an<br>
a space between the portable discharging apparatus 100 and the wall of the storage vessel 110<br>
In addition, the second rigid device 210 secures the apparatus 100 onto the upper edge of the<br>
storage vessel wall 110. A supply hose 135 is connected to the flow collimator 120 to supply a<br>
mixture of fire-fighting agents to the receptacle duct 115. In FIGURE 2C, the embodiment of<br>
the portable discharging apparatus 100 with the arc-shaped flow discharge attachment 130<br>
suited for orienting the flow of the fire-fighting agent against the inside wall of the storage vessel<br>
110. Other embodiments, however, may be utilized to direct the fire-fighting agent in different<br>
directions. FIGURE 2D is a front view of the portable discharging apparatus 100 and an arcshaped<br>
flow discharge attachment 130.<br>
In FIGURE 2E, a side view of a portable discharging apparatus 100 is depicted. This<br>
embodiment incorporates a mounting loop 225 which is attached to the receptacle duct 115. This<br>
mounting loop 225 provides another means by which the portable discharging apparatus 10<br>
may be mounted or placed on a storage vessel 110. Specifically, the portable discharging<br>
apparatus 100 may be raised'or lowered by attaching the mounting loop 225 to a hook that<br>
connected to a crane or other such conveyances. FIGURE 2F depicts an alternative<br>
embodiment for the portable discharging apparatus 100 with an arc-shaped flow discharge<br>
attachment 130, and the mounting loop 225 mounted or placed on the upper edge of the will of a<br>
storage vessel 110.<br>
In FIGURE 2G, a side view of a particular embodiment of the portable discharging<br>
apparatus 100 is depicted wherein a passage duct 240 is externally attached to the receptacle duct<br>
115, passes into the discharge duct 125 and terminates concentrically at the output end of the<br>
discharge duct 125. The passage duct 240 is used to deliver an additional fire-fighting agen<br>
such as powders, colloids, gels, etc. within the discharge stream of the fire-fighting agent being<br>
delivered through the discharge duct 125. This embodiment permits the use of more than one<br>
fire-fighting agent simultaneously and orients the flow of the fire-fighting agents directly onto<br>
the surface of the burning liquid in the storage vessel 110.<br>
In FIGURE 2H, a side view of a particular embodiment of the portable discharging<br>
apparatus 100 and an arc-shaped flow discharge attachment 130 is depicted wherein the passage<br>
duct 240 extends concentrically through the interior of the arc-shaped flow discharge attachment<br>
130. This embodiment permits the use of more than one fire-fighting agent simultaneously and<br>
orients the flow of the fire-fighting agents directly onto the inner wall of the storage vessel 110.<br>
In other embodiments, the passage duct 240 may be attached externally on the portable<br>
discharging apparatus 100 and the arc-shaped flow discharge attachment 130. More than on<br>
additional passage duct 240 may be attached to the portable discharging apparatus 100 for<br>
conveying and issuing a plurality of fire-fighting agents.<br>
FIGURE 3A depicts a longitudinal cross-sectional view of an alternative embodiment of<br>
the portable discharging apparatus 100, illustrating the positioning of the flow collimator 120 to<br>
the receptacle duct 115, as well as the mixing operations provided by these elements. After jhe<br>
fire-fighting agents pass through the flow collimator 120, they are aerated and passed from ihe<br>
receptacle duct 115 to the discharge duct 125. A mixture of foam concentrate is provided ir to a<br>
first end 305 of the flow collimator 120 by a supply hose 135. The conveyance of the mixti.re<br>
through the flexible supply hose 135 imparts a high degree of turbulence or non-uniform ve ocity<br>
in the mixture flow, shown by arrows 310, arriving at the first end 305. A higher level of<br>
turbulence in the flow results in a greater pressure loss along the length of the supply hose 35.<br>
The flow collimator 120 is used to pre-condition the mixture flow to obtain a higher degree of<br>
uniformity in the flow velocity of the mixture flow, as depicted by arrows 315, prior to passing<br>
through the jet-stream enhancer plate 325 with an end result of a better, more efficient and cost<br>
effective foam generation process. The flow collimator 120 may be comprised of a cylindrical<br>
tube of sufficient length to collimate the mixture. Upon reaching a second end 320 of the flow<br>
collimator 120, the foam concentrate mixture passes through a jet-stream enhancer plate 315.<br>
The jet-stream enhancer plate 325 increases the velocity of the flow and directs the foam<br>
concentrate mixture against the interior surface of the receptacle duct 115 thereby increasing the<br>
impact force between the foam concentrate mixture and the air 330, thus improving the foaming<br>
process. Furthermore, the flow of the foam concentrate mixture from the flow-collimator 120<br>
into the receptacle duct 115 draws a supply of air 330 into the air input port 335, which is located<br>
at a first end of the receptacle duct 115. As the foaming agent is distributed throughout tl e<br>
interior of the receptacle duct 115, it is mixed with the air 330 that is drawn in from the ai  input<br>
port 335 so as to generate a foam 340 that will be directed towards a second end of the receptacle<br>
duct 115. The embodiment depicted in FIGURE 3A utilized a flow collimator 120 and a jet-<br>
20<br>
stream enhancer plate 325 to generate the foam 340, however, one of ordinary skill in the art will<br>
realize that other arrangements may be utilized to generate a foam.<br>
FIGURE 3B depicts an alternative embodiment of the invention wherein the jet-stream<br>
enhancer plate 325, together with the collimator tube 120, are positioned at such a height, so as<br>
to reduce the vertical column of foam between the jet-stream enhancer plate 325 and the top of<br>
the receptacle duct 115, thus allowing a lower system pressure to overcome the back pressure of<br>
the foam 340 and thus obtain a higher fire-fighting agent flow at a lower pressure.<br>
This alternative embodiment incorporates many of the same components as the<br>
embodiment depicted in FIGURE 3A. The embodiment depicted in FIGURE 3B, however<br>
incorporates certain differences. Specifically, a much longer portion of the flow collimator<br>
is placed within the receptacle duct 115. In addition, air vents 350 are incorporated into the<br>
sidewall of the receptacle duct 115 in order to facilitate the mixing of the fire-fighting agen<br>
with the air 330.<br>
A perspective view of an alternative embodiment of the connection between a flow<br>
collimator 120 and a receptacle duct 115 is depicted in FIGURE 4. The flow collimator 1<br>
attached to the receptacle duct 115 by a series of fins 400. The fins 400 secure the separat<br>
between the flow collimator 120 and the receptacle duct 115 resulting in an air input port 3<br>
the first end of the receptacle duct 115.<br>
Also depicted in FIGURE 4 is a support rod receptacle 175 that is attached to the<br>
of the receptacle duct 115. The support rod receptacle 175 is designed to receive a suppo<br>
155 that is attached to the telescopic mast 150 of the portable installation apparatus 105 (n<br>
shown) The portable installation apparatus 105 may be removably connected to the porta<br>
discharging apparatus 100 by inserting the support rod 155 into the support rod receptach<br>
The support rod receptacle 175 may also include a flared termination 410 that is designed<br>
guide the support rod 155 into the support rod receptacle 175 so that the portable dischar<br>
apparatus 100 may be readily coupled to and de-coupled from the portable installation ap]<br>
105 Further, the support rod receptacle 175 and the support rod 155 depicted in FIGUR<br>

The use of one embodiment of the portable discharging apparatus 100 is depicted ir<br>
FIGURES 5A-5C. In FIGURE 5A, a portable discharging apparatus 100 has been mounted or<br>
placed on the upper edge of the wall of a storage vessel 110. In the depicted embodiment, an<br>
arc-shaped flow discharge attachment 130 is attached to the discharging duct 125, so that the<br>
fire-fighting agent 500 is directed against the inside wall of the storage vessel 110. The firefighting<br>
agent flows down and in contact with the inside wall of the storage vessel 110 as a thick,<br>
continuous cascade, as depicted in FIGURE SB. As the fire-fighting agent 500 continues to be<br>
applied, it will spread uniformly over the surface 510 of the burning liquid contained in the<br>
storage vessel 110, as depicted in FIGURE 5C. Experience demonstrates that the disrupti<br>
effects of the fire on the fire-fighting agent layer, such as push back or disruption of the<br>
continuity of the fire-fighting agent layer is overcome by the back pressure that exists on the<br>
leading edge of the fire-fighting agent layer. This back pressure is generated from the location<br>
where the fire-fighting agent flows down the inside wall of the storage vessel 110 and comes in<br>
contact with the liquid contained in the storage vessel.<br>
Eventually, as the fire-fighting agent continues to be issued from the portable discharging<br>
apparatus 100, the entire surface 510 of the burning liquid contained in the storage vessel 110<br>
will be covered with the fire-fighting agent 500, thus cutting off the oxygen supply and<br>
extinguishing the fire.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, fire-fighting agents may be used also to extract<br>
heat from the burning liquid contained in the storage vessel 110. In this manner, the temperature<br>
of the burning liquid is lowered beneath the ignition point thus contributing to extinguishir g the<br>
fire.<br>
Another embodiment of the portable discharging apparatus 100 is depicted in FIGURES<br>
6A-6C. In FIGURE 6A, a portable discharging apparatus 100 is mounted or placed on lie<br>
upper edge of the wall of a storage vessel 110. In this embodiment, however, the arc-shaped<br>
flow discharge attachment 130 is not utilized. Accordingly, the fire-fighting agent 500 that is<br>
discharged from the discharge duct 125 is aimed directly onto the surface 510 of the burning<br>
liquid contained in the storage vessel 110. Eventually, as the fire-fighting agent continues to be<br>
issued from the portable discharging apparatus 100, the entire surface 510 of the burning liquid<br>
contained in the storage vessel 110 will be covered with the fire-fighting agent 500, thus cutting<br>
off the oxygen supply and extinguishing the fire (FIGURES 6B &amp; 6C). In this embodiment<br>
experience indicates that the disruptive effects of the fire may destroy the continuity of the ~irefighting<br>
agent layer thereby permitting the access of oxygen and delaying or preventing the<br>
extinction of the fire. In this embodiment it is recommended that several portable discharging<br>
apparatuses be mounted using only one portable installation apparatus 105 and used<br>
simultaneously to ensure the successful extinction of the fire.<br>
The two embodiments depicted in figures 5A-5C and 6A-6C, and other embodimen<br>
specified here, can be used simultaneously given the flexible nature of the portable discharging<br>
apparatus 100 and the range of geometries available for the flow discharge attachments.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, fire-fighting agents may be used also to ex<br>
heat from the burning liquid contained in the storage vessel 110. In this manner, the tempe<br>
of the burning liquid is lowered beneath the ignition point thus contributing to extinguishing<br>
fire.<br>
A representative embodiment of a mixing apparatus 140 is depicted in FIGURE 7.<br>
described earlier with reference to FIGURE 1 A, the mixing apparatus 140 mixes a conveyi<br>
media with a concentrated fire-fighting agent, such as a foaming mixture, and feeds this mi<br>
into a supply hose 135. In FIGURE 7, a conveyance media supply line 142 is provided to<br>
end 700 of the mixing apparatus 140. A pressure gauge 705 may be attached to the conve<br>
media supply line 142 to measure pressure. Within the mixing apparatus 140 is an inspirat<br>
720. The inspirator 720 draws a supply of fire-fighting agent concentrate through the firefighting<br>
agent concentrate inlet 730 that it is mixed with the conveying media. The inside<br>
diameter of the fire-fighting agent concentrate inlet 730 is selected a priori to provide the<br>
required proportions of fire-fighting agent concentrate and conveying media. A fire-fightir<br>
agent supply line 144 is attached to the fire-fighting agent concentrate inlet 730 to provide<br>
fighting agent concentrate to the mixing apparatus 140. Thus, at the second end 735 of th<br>

A representative embodiment of the portable installation apparatus 105 is depicted }<br>
FIGURES 8A-8C. A fully assembled portable installation apparatus 105 is depicted in<br>
FIGURE 8A. As previously described, the portable installation apparatus 105 may be<br>
comprised of a telescopic mast 150, a base tube 165, and a pair of lateral support struts 170<br>
Each of the lateral support struts 170 is attached to a respective end of the base tube 165 b<br>
couplers 900. The other ends of the lateral support struts 170 are coupled to a collar 905 that is<br>
attached to the telescopic mast 150. A support rod 155 and a horizontal control rod 160 rr<br>
attached to the distal end of the telescopic mast 150. As previously described, the support<br>
155 may be used for attaching the portable discharging apparatus 100 onto the distal end o<br>
telescopic mast 150. The horizontal control rod 160, when used with tether lines 185, pro<br>

According to another aspect of the invention, the portable installation apparatus 105 may<br>
be collapsed into a unit that may be readily folded and stored. This embodiment is depicted in<br>
FIGURES 8B &amp; 8C In FIGURE 8B, the base tube 165 and each of the lateral support struts<br>
170 further comprising pivotal joints 910, which allow the rigid members to be folded into a<br>
more compact arrangement. A fully collapsed and folded embodiment of the portable<br>
installation apparatus 105 is depicted in FIGURE 8C. Each of the flexible joints 910 has<br>
corresponding sliding cover 915 that is used to lock the joint 910 when the portable installation<br>
apparatus 105 is fully extended and deployed. For example, in FIGURE 8A, the sliding covers<br>
915 have been deployed over the flexible joints 910 to maintain the rigidity of the respective<br>
lateral support struts 170 and the rigidity of the base tube 165. Also depicted in FIGURE 8A are<br>
the base anchors 920, which are used to secure the base tube 165 to the ground or other surfaces<br>
as the portable discharging apparatus 100 is elevated and mounted or placed on the upper<br>
the wall of a storage vessel 110.<br>
In another embodiment of the inventions the base tube 165, the lateral support struts 170<br>
and the telescopic mast 150 are comprised of telescopic members that can readily be extended or<br>
:dge of<br>
contracted so that the portable installation apparatus 105 can be used with a wide variety of sizes<br>
of storage vessels. This concept is illustrated in FIGURES 9A-9E. In FIGURE 9A, an<br>
embodiment of the portable installation apparatus 105 is depicted in which the members of |he<br>
telescopic mast 150, base tube 165 and the lateral support struts 170 are in their respected<br>
contracted positions.<br>
In FIGURE 9B, the telescopic mast 150, the base tube 165, and the lateral support struts<br>
170 are partially extended to such a position that may allow the portable discharging apparatus<br>
100, attached to the support rod 155 at the distal end of the telescopic mast 150, to be moulted or<br>
placed on the upper edge of the wall of a storage vessel 110, having a relatively medium height.<br>
In FIGURE 9C, the telescopic mast 150, the base tube 165 and the lateral support struts PO are<br>
fully extended so that the portable discharging apparatus 100 attached to support rod 155 at the<br>
distal end of the telescopic mast 150 may be mounted or placed on the upper edge of the wall of<br>
a storage vessel 110, having a relatively higher height.<br>
In FIGURES 9D and 9E an embodiment of an arrangement of locks and keys are<br>
depicted to prevent the rotation the members of the telescopic mast 150 with respect to the base<br>
tube 165 and thus secure the transverse angular orientation of the portable discharging apparatus<br>
100, as it is mounted or placed on the upper edge of the wall of a storage vessel 110. In<br>
FIGURE 91), a longitudinal cross-section of an embodiment of the interior of the telescopic;<br>
mast 150 is depicted in which an arrangement of a key 960 is attached to the base of the<br>
telescopic mast 150. A U-shaped grove 965 is attached to the base support socket 970, which is<br>
attached to the base tube 165. The key 960 mates with the U-shaped grove 965 so as to prevent<br>
the rotation of the exterior member of the telescopic mast 150 about the longitudinal centerline<br>
of the telescopic mast 150 with respect to the longitudinal centerline of the base tube 165.<br>
In FIGURE 9E, a transverse cross-section view of one embodiment of the telescopic<br>
mast 150 illustrates an embodiment of inner locking devices, between adjacent telescopic<br>
sections, which prevent the rotation of the telescopic mast 150 with respect to the longitudinal<br>
center line of the base tube 165. Thus, the alignment of the base tube 165 with respect to the<br>
storage vessel 110 is maintained throughout the entire length of the portable installation<br>
apparatus 105. This specific embodiment uses an arrangement of a keyed collar 945 attached to<br>
the inner wall of a telescopic section and a grove 940 along the entire length of the outer wall of<br>
the next inner telescopic section, as showed in FIGURE 9D-9E. Other suitable arrangements of<br>
inner locks will be apparent to one of ordinary skill for the prevention of rotation between tpe<br>
telescopic sections, such as inverting the key and the grove arrangement or using rectangular<br>
telescopic sections or other such means.<br>
FIGURE 9D also depicts an embodiment of a bi-directional flow apparatus 930 for<br>
incoming or outgoing hydraulic flow in the hydraulic line 192 (not shown), and is adapted to<br>
prevent the loss of hydraulic pressure in the interior of the telescopic mast 150 when the<br>
hydraulic line 192 is removed either intentionally or accidentally. Also depicted in FIGURE 9D<br>
is an embodiment of a drain apparatus 935. One aspect of the drain apparatus 935 is the removal<br>
of the residual hydraulic fluids prior to the storage of the portable installation apparatus 10!&gt;.<br>
This prevents corrosion of the inner cavities of the telescopic mast 150 when not in operation<br>
The second aspect of the drain apparatus 935 is the relief of hydraulic pressure in the telescopic<br>
mast 150 for the purpose of preventing damage to the seals and compromising structural integrity<br>
of the telescopic members.<br>
FIGURES 10A-10C depict the key difference in the process of mounting the portable<br>
discharging apparatus 100 on storage vessels 110 of varying heights. The length of the spacer<br>
member 194 can be adjusted to preset lengths corresponding to different heights of the storage<br>
vessel 110 or flexibly adjusted on site in response to the actual environment and available space.<br>
The spacer bar 194 serves to fix the distance between the bottom of the wall of the storage vessel<br>
110 and the base tube 165 of the portable installation apparatus 105 and to achieve the correct<br>
degree of inclination of the portable installation apparatus 105, to ensure the directional st£<br>
of the apparatus as it is elevated to mount or remove the portable discharging apparatus ICO.<br>
FIGURES 11A-11E depict another aspect of the invention wherein a conveying<br>
embodiment for the purpose of transporting the fire-fighting apparatuses of the present inv<br>
is shown.<br>
In FIGURE 11A a transportation apparatus 1100 is shown, which is adapted to be either<br>
manually maneuvered or mechanically towed to the site of the burning storage vessel 110. The<br>
transportation apparatus 1100 is further adapted to carry the portable discharging apparatus 100,<br>
the portable installation apparatus 105 and accessories on board.<br>

In FIGURE 11B a skid 1105 is shown, which is a further embodiment of the present<br>
invention that is adapted for containing and transporting the fire-fighting apparatuses. The skid<br>
1105 is designed such that it can be transported in a variety of ways, including a trailer, a railcar,<br>
a truck, a boat, or a helicopter. In addition, the skid 1105 is designed such that it can be pulled or<br>
carried across a variety of surfaces so that all of the components of the present invention can be<br>
readily transported to the immediate vicinity of the fire.<br>
In FIGURE 11C the portable discharging apparatus 100 and the portable installation<br>
apparatus 105 are loaded in the skid 1105, wherein the entire fire-fighting apparatuses and<br>
accessories of the present invention may be readily transported and deployed at the locatior<br>
fire.<br>
In FIGURE 11D depicts the skid 1105 loaded with the portable discharging appan<br>
100, the portable installation apparatus 105 and accessories onboard the transportation apparatus<br>
1100.<br>
A perspective view of an alternative embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in<br>
the FIGURES 12A-12C, wherein the portable installation apparatus 105, and the portable<br>
discharging apparatus 100, are fully assembled on board the transportation apparatus 1100<br>
Specifically, the transportation apparatus 1100 is adapted to move the assembled portable<br>
installation apparatus 105 with the portable discharging apparatus 100 from a distant assembly<br>
point to the wall of the storage vessel 110. In this embodiment of the invention, the portable<br>
installation apparatus 105 is adapted with a second telescopic device 1210, wherein the second<br>
telescopic device 1210 is adapted to erect the portable installation apparatus 105 together with<br>
the portable discharging apparatus 100 to the full upright position using two mounting trunnions<br>
1205, that mate with each end of the base tube 165. The two mounting trunnions 1205 together<br>
with the ends of the base tube 165 provide for the erective rotation and locking of the portable<br>
installation apparatus in the full upright position. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize<br>
that other arrangements may be utilized in the assembly, transporting and erecting the portible<br>
installation apparatus<br>
