				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for detoxification of Jatropha seed oil.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Jatropha curcas, commonly known as wild castor, safed arand, ratanjyot or physic nut, belongs to the family euphorbiaceae. The seeds are rich in kernel percentage (60-68%) which yield 46-58% of oil (38 to 40% on seed weight basis). However, the seeds contain some poisonous compounds (curcin, curcasin, phorbol) on account of which the oil is toxic and purgative, rendering the oil unfit for human consumption. Hence, till now all over the world, the oil is used in soap making, cosmetic industry and for illumination purpose etc.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a novel process for detoxification of Jatropha seed oil.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a novel process for detoxification of Jatropha seed oil so that it may be used for edible purposes.<br>
Still  another object of this  invention  is to  propose  a novel  process for<br>
detoxification of Jatropha seed oil which when edibly consumed does not produce any toxic symptoms.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for the detoxification of Jatropha seed oil comprising neutralization of free fatty acids from the oil, mixing said neutralized oil with a polar solvent in the ratio of 10:0.8-1.2 in one flask, taking a non-polar solvent in another flask in the ratio of 5:1-1.5 of the oil, attaching said flasks to liquid-liquid extraction assembly and heating the flask containing non-polar solvent to a temperature of 60 to 80°C so as to dissolve the oil therein, removing the oil from the petroleum ether by distillation method and then bleaching said oil to get the detoxificated oil.<br>
In accordance with this invention the Jatropha seed oil is neutralized in a conventional manner. The neutralized oil is then subjected to the<br>
step of liquid-liquid extraction which is then subjected to  the step of bleaching to get the detoxificated  oil.<br>
The  step  of  liquid-liquid  extraction  comprises   in preparing a mix of neutralised  oil and polar solvent in<br>
the ratio of 10:.8-1.2 in a flask.  Heating  a non-polar<br>
solvent  in another  flask to a temperature of  60-8CPC. The non-polar solvent used is in the ratio of 5:1-1.5 of<br>
the oil.  By this process the toxic agent of the oil  is left in  the  aqueous  methanol  and  whole  of  the  oil i<br>
dissolved   in  petroleum  ether.   The  oil   is   then subsequently   removed  from  the  petroleum  ether   by<br>
distillation  method.  The oil so obtained is  subjected to the step of bleaching as mentioned herein above in  a<br>
conventional  manner to remove the coloring  agent  from the  oil and to get the detoxificated oil.<br>
A process for detoxification of  atropha seed oil  is herein described in detail with the help of  the<br>
example.<br>
The jatropha seed oil is first neutralized by<br>
removing  th«  fatty acids from the oil by  heating  and cooling  the  oil and then treating the same  with  0.1N<br>
sodium  hydroxide  solution.   The  aqueous  portion  is<br>
removed and the oil is washed to get the neutralized oil free  of  fatty acids.  This step of  neutralization  of oil   is as such known in the art and do not  constitute an inventive features of this invention.<br>
Specifically according to this invention  the<br>
neutralized oil is subjected to the step of liquid-liquid extraction by using polar and non-polar solvents.<br>
For this purpose the neutralized oil is mixed with a polar  solvent  like aqueous methanol in  the  ratio  of<br>
10:.8-1.2 respectively in a flask. The non-polar solvent like petroleum ether is heated in another  flask<br>
separately at a temperature of 60-80°C. The petroleum ether  used is in the ratio of 5:1-1.5 of the  oil.   By<br>
this process the toxic agents of the oil are left in the aqueous  methanol  and  the oil  is  dissolved   in  the<br>
petroleum ether. The petroleum ether is subsequently removed from the oil by distillation method.  The oil so<br>
obtained after distillation is subjected to the step of bleaching  to get the detoxificated oil.  The  bleaching<br>
is  done by using bleaching agent like activated  earth.<br>
For this purpose the oil is heated at 50-6CP C and for 20-40  minutes.   40 to 60 gms of bleaching  agent  like<br>
activated earth is added and then the contents are again heated  and  filtered  to get the oil.  The  process  is<br>
further illustrated in the following example:<br>
EXAMPLE :-<br>
1  litre of jatropha seed oil was  heated  at 50 °C    for  30  minutes under occasional  stirring.   The<br>
heated  oil was then cooled to the  ambient  temperature and  75ml of 0.1N sodium hydroxide solution  was  added.<br>
The  aqueous portion was removed and the oil was  washed with hot water to get the neutral oil.  The neutral  oil<br>
so  obtained was mixed with 8 ml aqueous methanol  in  a flask.  400 ml of petroleum ether was heated in  another flask at a temperature of 60-80 t for the  liquid-liquid<br>
extraction purposes.  By this process the toxic agent of the  oil were left in the aqueous methanol and  the  oil<br>
was  dissolved in petroleum ether which was  removed  by distillation  method.    The oil so obtained  was  again heated  at 55°C  for 30 minutes and 50 gms  of  activated<br>
earth was added to it and the contents were again heated for 30 minutes with activated earth and was filtered  to<br>
get the detoxificated oil.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM;<br>
1.	A process for detoxification of jatropha seed oil<br>
comprising neutralization  of fatty acids from the  oil,<br>
subjecting  the neutralized oil to the step  of  liquid-liquid extraction and then bleaching the same to get the detoxificated oil.<br>
2.	A process as claimed in claim 1,wherein the step<br>
of liquid-liquid extraction comprises mixing the neutral<br>
oil with a polar solvent in the ratio of 10:0.8-1.2 in one flask, heating a non-polar solvent at a  temperature<br>
of 60 to 80°C separately in another flask and then removing  the oil from the petroleum ether dissolved  in<br>
it.<br>
3.	A process as claimed in claim 2, wherein said<br>

4.	A process as claimed in claim 2, wherein the non-polar solvent is for example petroleum ether.<br>

purposes is in the ratio of 5:1-1.5 of the oil.<br>
6. A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the step of bleaching comprises heating the oil at. a temperature of  50-60 °C  and  adding activated  earth  into  it.  and<br>
heating  again  and  filtering  the  same  to  get   the detoxificated oil.<br>
