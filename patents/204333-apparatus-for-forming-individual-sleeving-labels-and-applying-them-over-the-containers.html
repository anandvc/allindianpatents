COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
SECTION 10<br><br>
TITLE<br><br>
AN APPARATUS FOR FORMING INDIVISUAI SLEEVING LABELS AND APPLYING THEM OVER THE CONTAINERS.<br><br><br><br>
APPLICANTS<br><br>
THE PAPER PRODUCTS LIMITED OF L.B.SHASTRI MARG. MAJIWADE. THANE 400 601, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA. AN INDIAN COMPANY.<br><br>
The following Specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which<br>
it is to be performed :-<br>
29-4-2004<br><br>
This invention relates to an apparatus for forming individual sleeving labels and applying them over the containers.<br>
Particularly, this invention relates in general to packaging machinery and more particularly to a method and machine for automatically taking a continuous hollow web of a thin plastic material, directing it through a cutter to slice the web transversely forming individual segments, and to move said segments over a container, such as a bottle, where the segment can subsequently be shrink-wrapped. There have been a wide number of techniques developed for performing operations, in the shrink-wrapping of sleeve labels for containers. These techniques have been employed to form, around a container, individual sleeve sleeves from a continuous roll of a flattened tubular web of thin flexible plastic. A suitable apparatus provides for opening the tube to slip it over the container and to provide means for cutting off an individual label for each container. The usual automatic arrangement includes a table top conveyor to provide the container either in a continuous motion or intermittent motion to a work station where the shrink wrap sleeve is placed over it. The conveyor then carries the sleeved container to another work station for performing the shrink operation itself. There are at least two critical characteristics that such a system must have. One is that it operate at relatively high speed so that the through-put of the operation is economical. A second is that it be relatively free of jams so that production does not get interrupted.<br>
Much of the development in the art has focused on the problem of how to open the tube or web for placement over the container and how to cut or slice the web transversely while still maintaining a<br><br>
driving force for the web after it has been segmented to carry it over the bottle. Generally, it has not proven feasible to cut the web in an open or partially open position. Thus much of the art has been directed towards the use of blowers, vacuum and the like to open the tubular web after it has been cut and also to a means for carrying the cut segment of the tubing in the open condition over the container, or other object being sleeved.<br>
One device which has been used frequently as one element in such a sleeving apparatus is referred to as a "floating mandrel" which provides for defining the tube in an open shape and to provide means for placing that open shape over the container. In one approach the web is cut at a point overlying the mandrel by a razor edge which circumscribes the web on the mandrel. Another approach has been to sever the web segment while it is in the bottle, either by using a perforated web and breaking it at the perforation line, or cutting the continuous web at a point just above the top of the bottle.<br>
It is therefore a primary object of the present invention to provide apparatus for forming from a continuous roll or web of flexible thin plastic tubing, individual sleeving labels and applying them over the containers to be sleeved.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a machine for feeding a continuous web of flattened flexible thin plastic tubing into a system which slightly opens the tubing, cuts the opened<br><br><br>
tubing, thereafter forms the tubing over a floating mandrel to the shape of the container, and, finally passes the properly shaped segment of tubing over the container itself.<br>
Broadly speaking, in the present invention a machine provides for a controlled intermittent flow of the tubular web or sleeve of thin plastic material from a storage reel, over a tensioning arm and guiding rollers onto a group of machine elements which first open the tube somewhat, stop the flow of material, slice the tube transversely, and pass the cut segment of web over a floating mandrel to form it into the shape of a container positioned below it, while continuing the flow of tubing from the reel down onto the same group of elements to form the next sleeve. The open segment of sleeve is now placed over the container automatically to complete the sleeving operation.<br>
It is a feature of this invention that the transverse cutting of the web is done with the web at least partially opened by a pair of reciprocating shear blades and that the system provides for continued passage of the now severed segment of the tubing over a floating mandrel to form the final open shape of the tube and place that open, shaped segment over the container.<br>
The container is normally one of a row of containers carried on a suitable conveyor, such as a tabletop conveyor, which brings the containers to be sleeved one at a time underneath the sleeving machine work station.<br><br><br>
The object of this invention therefore is to provide an improved apparatus for applying flexible plastic sleeves on a container and typically relates to packaging equipment that takes a continuous hollow web of thin plastic material, shears it transversely, forms it in the shape of containers that are to be sleeved and applies the sleeves on the container.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring to the drawings, the apparatus as a whole is generally indicated by the reference numeral 100 as can be particularly seen in Figure 1 of the drawings.<br>
Figure 1 is an overall perspective view of the sleeve application machine 100 of this invention. The machine draws the thin flexible plastic sleeve or web W in a flattened condition from storage roll SR. The storage roll SR is mounted on a post PO on the main frame FR of the machine 100 . The main frame FR is in the form of a cabinet which contains many of the control elements for the machine. A control panel P which controls the movement of the apparatus 100 is also attached to the main frame FR. The control panel P controls many of the control elements of the machine. The post PO continues to a base member MF on the floor. The purpose of the machine 100 is to place a flexible plastic sleeve over each of containers CO, travelling along the tabletop conveyor TC (or other<br><br>
suitable conveying means) as each container CO reaches a point underneath the sleeve applying station of the machine 100. The sleeves are placed over each of the containers CO, later to be shrunk in a process [not a part of this invention] in which the shrunk sleeves are used for tamper proof seals or body labels.<br>
The manner of storing the web on the reel and providing for it's tensioning and leading it to the tensioning device are typical of this invention. The storage roll SR is rotatably mounted on the frame post PO and the web W is drawn over a tensioning arm and thence down to first idler roller IR1, across to a second idler roller IR2, which is vertically aligned with the guiding elements in the machine. The tensioning roller TR is part of a dancer mechanism DM which includes tensioning arm TA fixed with respect to the frame member FR and having a spring SPR or a pneumatic cylinder fastened between it and the machine frame FR which also supports tensioning roller TR. In addition a brake arrangement (not shown) is included, as is usual with this general type of feed mechanism at the unwind station on the post PO within the storage roller SR. Thus when the web W is being drawn from the roll SR, the tensioning roller TR moves downward about a pivot point stretching the tensioning arm spring or pneumatic cylinder as the case may be, thereby de-creasing tension and allowing web W to be pulled downward.<br>
When the drive pulling down the web is stopped, the dancer mechanism DM rises by spring tension.<br><br><br>
The sleeve or web W may carry labelling information on it, or may be clear, but in any case should have registration marks R along one edge, to provide for control of the length of each sleeve as it is cut to be placed over the container CO. Alternatively this length determination could be made by employing a shaft encoder on any one of the shafts which rotate in conjunction with the travel of the web to provide an output signal.<br>
A sensor SEN is mounted on a bracket arm. This sensor SEN , which typically is a light beam photo sensor combination, provides an output signal as one of the registration marks R on the web W pass by it. This output signal is used to stop the web drive when a specific length of web has passed beyond the cutter plane and thereby controls the length of each segment that forms the sleeve placed on each container.<br>
An open, generally rectangular frame FR contains the mechanisms which provide the feed drive for the web W, open the web feed from its flattened condition, slice the web transversely to form the sleeves and push these sleeves vertically onto the containers CO. This frame is formed of an upper horizontal platform supported by two vertical side members and, with a second horizontal platform forming the bottom member of the frame as can be seen in Figure 1. The frame is bolted to side supports SS1and SS2 which are fastened to the base MF.<br><br><br>
Two pinch rollers PRl and PR2 are provided which are connected between the storage roll SR and the dancing mechanism DM. Either one of the pinch rollers PRl or PR2 are driven by an external motor and provides the driving element for this section of the apparatus. The roller which is driven is typically of metal and preferably of stainless steel while the other roller the idler is of rubber.<br>
There are four principal operating mechanisms contained within the frame FR. These are the web storage and unwind mechanism, consisting of the storage roll SR , the de-creasing mechanism DEM, the dancing mechanism DM, the pinch or pinch/pull rollers PRl and PR2 whose functions will be described later. The tensioning roller TR, the tensioning arm TA and the idler rollers IR1 and IR2. OF these the pinch roller PRl is a driven shaft connected to a motor drive[not shown]. In between the idler rollers IR1 and IR2 is the sensor SEN which senses the registration marks R on the web W and controls the movement of the unwind mechanism. A web sleeve feeding mechanism is provided further downstream consisting of two pinch rollers SFR1 And SFR2. Either of the two is driven with the help of an external motor. The two pinch rollers SFR1 and SFR2 have a positive drive between them, typically with the help of a gear drive [ not shown] to ensure downwards and opposite rotation and in the direction of the path of the web towards the container CO.<br>
Located just below the idler roller IR2 and the external idler roller<br><br><br>
58 is the web opener mechanism WO which opens the web W and displaces it to a transverse cutting mechanism comprised by the cutters C143] and C2[43], which includes reciprocating blades . This mechanism, in response to control signals, performs the function of shearing the slightly opened web as it passes down from the web opener WO, thereby producing several cut segments of the tubular web 10 to form the sleeves. This cutting mechanism is illustrated in detail later.<br>
Another mechanism is an element for receiving the severed sleeve, opening it fully transversely into the transverse shape of a container CO, then passing the shaped sleeve onto a container CO. This mechanism includes a floating mandrel FM, included within the tubular web, and belt drives for pushing the sleeve severed segment of the web. This mechanism also includes drives, which carry the severed web segment sleeve from the floating mandrel FM onto the container CO as generally illustrated in Figure 1. Details of this mechanism are illustrated later.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the principal mechanisms which are located in the rectangular frame FR.<br>
THE WEB-OPENER: {WO} as particularly seen in Figure 5A The web opener is formed of a smooth strong material. The web opener WO is defined by a head and a neck and resilient flaps extending from the neck, the long axis of the web opener being aligned with the longitudinal dimension of said web W. The web opener includes     rollers mounted within it on a rotational axis<br><br><br>
parallel to the face of the head of said web opener. The web opener has a thickness that is very small compared to the width. The external periphery of the web opener WO is slightly less or equal to the internal periphery of the web W. The head 47 of the web opener WO has one roller 56 mounted on it on both the flat sides on the plate 57. These rollers are in contact with external idler roller 58. The external idler roller 58 has a shoulder on it equivalent to the width of roller 56 to restrict the horizontal movement of the web opener WO. The flaps 51 hold the web open when it enters the thin edge of the floating mandrel FM. A spring-loaded pin 55 is inserted in the head of the web opener so that the web does not rub against the edges of the web opener to avoid friction between the web and the web opener as the friction causes the web to sever from the seams or tear the web. The idler roller 58 is mounted on the machine frame. The idler roller 58 and the web rollers 56 hold the web opener at one place.<br>
THE SLEEVE PUSHING MECHANISM Fig. 3 shows the sleeve pushing mechanism. A pneumatic cylinder or a cam or any other conventional method gives reciprocating motion to link (not shown in fig.). This link transmits the motion to the rear guide rod 15. The small levers 16 and 26 are oscillated. With a pair of links 31 the bell crank levers are also oscillated. A pair of shafts 19 connects pair or bell crank lever to a pair of straight levers 18. The pair of straight levers 18 is mounted on the shaft SH2.<br><br><br>
Both the shafts 13 and 2 have screw threads on them the front mounting plates 4 and 6, and rear mounting plates 12 and 14 also have internal threads, hence the assembly of the shafts and the mounting plates forms a screw and nut assembly. While changing the mandrel the shafts 13 and 2 are rotated either manually or automatically. The mandrel is supported with the lower most set of roller pulleys 25, 20, 22 and 30. When the shafts 2 and 13 are rotated by a set degree the mounting plates 4,6, and 12,14 move apart or come closer. Either the shaft SH3 or 9 is driven by means of external motor.<br>
There is a gear assembly with two intermittent gears (not shown) between the shafts SH3 and 9. This ensures a positive drive and opposite direction of rotation on both sides of the floating mandrel. A set of two shafts SH2 and SH1are placed one on top of another and on top of shafts 9 and SH3 on both sides of the mandrel(not shown). There are three roller pulleys; roller pulley 20 on shaft SH2, roller pulley 30 on shaft 9 and roller pulley 29 on shaft SHI are on one side of the mandrel and another set of three roller pulleys; roller 25 on shaft SH3, roller pulley 20 on shaft SH2 and roller pulley 17 on shaft SH1are placed on the other side of the mandrel, in the same vertical plane.<br>
The roller pulleys 22,30 and 29 has timing belt B over it, also roller pulleys 25, 20 and 17 have a timing belt B mounted on them, both the belts B are rotating as the shafts 21 and 9 are rotating. The pair of belts B collapses on the mandrel (not shown) due to the oscillating action of the pair of bell crank lever 11 on both the sides<br><br>
of the mandrel. Hence the belts B are in contact with the mandrel rollers only when there is a sleeve between them. As both the belts B are rotating in the downward direction, when they collapse On the mandrel which has a sleeve over it, due to the friction between the belt and the sleeve they push the sleeve down towards the container.<br>
The advantage of using a timing belt B is that due to the higher surface contact between the belt and the sleeve, sleeves of smaller and larger sizes (i.e. cap sleeves as well as body sleeves) can be transferred easily without slippage. Also by using the mechanism ensures positive drive on both sides of the mandrel. As there is a positive drive on both the sides when the sleeve is being pushed a larger force does not push it on one side compared to the other side.<br>
THE CUTTING MECHANISM<br>
The shearing mechanism is illustrated in fig. 4. The purpose of the shearing mechanism is to sever the web while it is in the slightly open position created by the effect of the web-opener and in a position just above the upper thin edge of the floating mandrel. Two side plates 37 and 45 are mounted on the main machine frame. The side plates 37 and 45 hold the cutting mechanism. There is an arm connected to a pneumatic cylinder or any other conventional mechanism (not shown) that is connected to the lever arm 32. The reciprocating motion of the mechanism oscillates the lever arm 32. One end of the arm 32 is connected to the cutter-mounting frame 40 by link LI. The other end of lever arm 32 is connected by a link L2 to another cutter mounting frame 41. The cutter-mounting blocks 40<br><br>
and 41 are mounted on guide rods 38 and 46. Cutting blade 42 and 43 are bolted on the cutter-mounting frame 40 and 41. With one oscillating motion of the arm 32 the mounting frames 41 and 40 approach each other performing a shearing action. With the reverse oscillation of the arm 32 the mounting frames 41 and 40 move away from each other. The complete cycle performs the shearing action by the reciprocal motion of the frames 40 and 41 transverse to the direction of flow of the web. When the pre-determined length of the sleeve has pulled, the sleeve is stopped and the cutting action takes place. After the sleeve is cut transverse to the direction of movement of the web it is pulled by the sleeve pushing mechanism explained earlier.<br>
THE FLOATING MANDREL ASSEMBLY The floating mandrel together with timing pulley or belt transport mechanism, provides for opening the web to the cross sectional shape of the container and moving the web down over an initial portion of the mandrel. After the web has been spliced at a vertical position between the bottom of the web opener and top the floating mandrel, the timing pulleys provide for further transport of the severed segment of the web or the sleeve. The detail of the floating mandrel is given in fig 6. As shown the lower portion of the mandrel is in the shape of the cross-section of the container. Freely rotating rollers are mounted in the recess provided on both the sides of the mandrel. The lower most two pairs of rollers are in contact with external rollers 30, 22, 20 and 25. These rollers 30, 22, 20 and 25 hold the mandrel assembly form outside the web. When the pulley is<br><br>
engaged to the top rollers of the mandrel they form a nip and pull the severed sleeve down towards the container.<br>
UNWIND UNIT<br>
The storage roll is mounted on this station. It has a shaft PO on which the storage roll SR is mounted. The unwind shaft/post PO is not a driven shaft. It has a mechanical braking system so that some force is required to pull the web. This mechanism is to avoid any freewheeling. For exact sleeve cutting and proper operation it is necessary that the web should be taut, also care has to be taken that it does not stretch the roll too much. The braking pressure is variable and can be controlled with the aid of a spring pressure. AS the cut-length or the sleeve is constant the rotation of the storage roll has to be proportional to the roll diameter. When the roll diameter is high i.e. the roll has just started unwinding, the rotation is less and should keeps on increasing as the roll diameter decreases. The rotation speed is highest when the roll diameter is minimum.<br>
An additional shaft can also be provided on the unwind station with a splicing system to reduce changeover time after the roll gets over.<br>
PINCH/PULL ROLLER<br>
Two pinch rollers PR1 and PR2 , generally one is made of rubber and the other of steel, press the web W. The pressure is applied using either spring load or pnuematic or cam. These rollers are rotated using a motor.  As both the rollers are in contact with each<br><br>
other they rotate in opposite direction. Out of the two rollers one is a driven roller and the other is an idler roller. The driven roller is made of steel and is fixed. The idler roller is made of rubber and can be moved. The idler roller and driven roller are pressed to each other in running condition. When a new web has to be loaded the idler roller is moved and the web is then placed between the two rollers. The idler roller is then pressed against the driven roller with the web in between.<br>
When the driven roller is rotated using the motor it pulls the web out from the unwind station. The pulling has to be controlled as per the requirement of the machine. The rate at which the roll is being pulled out is varied according to the roll diameter.<br>
DE-CREASING MANDREL<br>
De-Creasing Mandrel DEM is a special unit to remove the creases of the web, by changing the orientation of the web, to make the sleeve application easier. The mandrel has one top edge and one bottom edge; both the edges of the mandrel are normal to each other. From the sides the mandrel has a triangular shape. This typical shape helps in changing the orientation of the web. The mandrel is inserted in the web hence the surfaces and edges of the mandrel have to be smooth to avoid any friction between the mandrel surfaces and the web; also to avoid tearing of the web.<br>
After the web surface is oriented it is passed between two closely spaced idler roller which press the creases of the web.<br>
MOTOR SYNCHRONISATION The motors are not synchronised with respect to each other. The pull/pinch rollers PR1 and PR2 are continuously rotating until there is no sleeve to be fed, at that time the tensioning arm TA goes to the bottom most position and triggers a limit switch to shut the motor off. The motor is switched on as soon as the tensioning arm releases the switch by moving upwards. The sleeve feed rollers start driving as soon as a container CO is sensed. The colour mark sensor restricts the cut-length of the sleeve. The sleeve feeding rollers SFR1and SFR2 are driven, using a clutch brake system or a servomotor. The third motor that is the motor driving the shaft 9 is continuously driven.<br>
