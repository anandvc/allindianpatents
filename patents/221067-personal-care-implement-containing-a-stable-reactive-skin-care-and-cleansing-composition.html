COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
PERSONAL CARE IMPLEMENT CONTAINING A STABLE REACTIVE SKIN CARE AND CLEANSING COMPOSITION<br>
HINDUSTAN   LEVER   LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at  Hindustan  Lever  House,     165/166,   Backbay  Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 2005/063192<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013789<br><br>
-   1   -<br>
PERSONAL CARE IMPLEMENT CONTAINING A STABLE REACTIVE SKIN CARE AND CLEANSING COMPOSITION<br>
The present invention relates to a personal skin care and <br>
5  cleansing implement containing a stable reactive skin care and cleansing composition.<br>
Implements are frequently used to efficiently apply skin care and cleansing compositions and have included woven and<br>
10  non-woven wipes, polymeric mesh bags and sponges to name a few widely used forms of implements.  Consumers also desire to better visualize the effects of the cleansing and skin treatment.  Prior art implements provided a signal for the simple depletion of a colored active substance via a<br>
15  decrease in color intensity as the active substance<br>
concentration in the implement decreased, as a function of use.<br>
For example, U.S. Patent no. 4,987,632 entitled Wiping <br>
20  Article, issued to Rowe et al. on Jan. 29, 1991 discloses a substantially dry-to-the-touch wiping article which is suitable for use in cleaning soiled surfaces in the presence of water, and that has a water absorbent substrate impregnated with a detergent active compound and sandwiched <br>
25  by a moisture barrier.  The detergent active material or the moisture barrier can comprise a water-soluble dyestuff or colorant, the disappearance of which can signal exhaustion of the material.<br>
30  Reactive systems have also been utilized to measure the change in concentration in an active substance.  For example, U.S.<br><br>
WO 2005/063192<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013789<br><br>
- 2  -<br>
Patent No. 4,678,704 entitled Impregnated Substrate Incorporating 7An Indicator Dye issued to A. Fellows on July 1, 1987 discloses an impregnated fabric material that has been bonded to an active cationic impregnant, and an anionic <br>
5   indicator dye in combination with a further cationic component also applied to the fabric material, wherein the dye bonds to the second cationic component more readily than to the fabric. The second  cationic component competes with the impregnant for bonding to the dye.  In the case of a wiping cloth, the dye <br>
10  acts as an indicator, the disappearance of which indicates depletion of the active component with use.<br>
The use of a porous or netted bag or pouch to carry soap is known.  The prior art includes US 1,682,119 where a bag is<br>
15  provided with soap in a flake or fragment form.  Similarly US 2,607,940 discloses a mesh bag so that a soap can be easily inserted.  Similar arrangements are taught in e.g. US Patent No. 3,167,805, US Patent No. 4,190,550, US Patent No. 4,228,834, US Patent No. 4,48,0939, and US Patent No.<br>
20  5,46"2,378.<br>
US Patent No. 4,789,262 teaches a soap-holding cleaning pad. US Patent No. 5,839,842 discloses a cleansing system with a toilet bar and a sponge in a porous pouch.  US- Patent No. <br>
25	 6,042,288 teaches the use of a synthetic detergent bar and a pouf  for holding the bar.  JP Patent No. 10137152 also teaches a solid soap in an expansible net.<br>
However, the problem with prior art skin and hair care and <br>
30  cleansing implements is the lack of a system whereby a reaction between two components of the skin care and<br><br>
WO 2005/063192<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013789<br><br>
-   3   -<br>
cleansing composition contained or absorbed by the implement,<br>
or a reaction of one of it's components and water can take<br>
place to cause a noticeable change for the consumer, and that<br>
is optionally accompanied by one or more skin or hair<br>
â€”5	benefits.	<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that a skin care and cleansing implement can be made having a skin care or cleansing composition releasably associated with the implement, where <br>
10  the composition may either be coated onto or held within internal pores of the implement, held within a pouch associated with the implement capable of dispensing a desired amount, or where a portion of the pouch can dissolve or disintegrate and release the composition contained within it. <br>
15<br>
The inventive composition has one or more reactive components that react either with each other or with water when water is added.  This reaction may signify to the consumer that the skin care or cleansing composition releasably associated with <br>
20  the implement has been activated and is ready for further use.  The reaction can be signified via a change in color, production of a gas (e.g. effervescence), activation of a warming or a cooling effect on the skin, or another noticeable change in a physical property or appearance of the <br>
25  implement may occur.  The lessening of the intensity of the color, effervescence, warming or cooling, etc. will signify to the consumer the transfer of the active or cleansing components to the skin and hair, and  ultimately the depletion of the activity of the implement.<br>

ethersulfate), about 2-50 %; amphoteric surfactant (e.g. alkyl betaine or alkyl amphoacetate), about 3-20 % based on the total composition.<br>
10   The surfactant system may also optionally comprise a nonionic surfactant.<br>
The nonionic which may be used includes in particular the reaction products of compounds having a hydrophobic group <br>
15   and a reactive hydrogen atom, for example aliphatic<br>
alcohols, acids, amides or alkyl phenols with alkylene oxides, especially ethylene oxide either alone or with propylene oxide.<br>
20  Specific nonionic detergent compounds are alkyl (C6-C22)phenols-ethylene oxide condensates, the condensation<br>
products of aliphatic (C8-C18) primary or secondary linear<br>
or branched alcohols with ethylene oxide, and products made by condensation of ethylene oxide with the reaction products <br>
25   of propylene oxide and ethylenediamine.  Other so-called nonionic detergent compounds include long chain tertiary amine oxides, long chain tertiary phosphine oxides and dialkyl sulphoxides, and the like.<br><br>

and x is from 1.3 to about 10, preferably from 1.3 to about 2.7.  The glycosyl is preferably derived from glucose.<br>
To prepare these compounds, the alcohol or alkylpolyethoxy<br>
â€”5  alcohol is formed first and then reacted with glucose,â€”or a	<br>
source of glucose, to form the glucoside (attachment at the 1-position).  The additional glycosyl units can then be attached between their 1-position and the preceding glycosyl units 2-, 3-, 4- and/or 6-position, preferably predominantly <br>
10  the 2-position.<br>
The nonionic comprises about 0 to 40 % by wt. in each phase of the composition, preferably about 0 to 15 % by wt. 0 to 40 % in the continuous phase and 0 to 20 % in the discontinuous <br>
15  phase.<br>
One way of moisturizing is to reduce the rate of water loss from the stratum corneum (skin surface) by depositing an occlusive emollient on the skin surface which prevents water<br>
20  evaporation. Another technique is to add hygroscopic non-<br>
occlusive substances (humectants),' which will retain water to the stratum corneum, making water available to the skin surface thereby producing the desired cosmetic effect. Non-occlusive emollients also function by improving the lubricity<br>
25  of the skin.<br>
Both occlusive and non-occlusive emollients as well as mixtures thereof are operative in the present invention and may be present in either or both the continuous or <br>
30  discontinuous phases.  Examples of occlusive emollients include, lanolin and its derivatives, long chain esters,<br><br>

Other examples of occlusive emollients include mineral oil, petrolatum, silicone oil such as dimethyl polysiloxane, <br>
25   lauryl and myristyl lactate, fatty acid oils, triglycerides, and the like.<br>
The occlusive emollient is generally used in an amount from about 0 to 70 %, preferably about 5 to 40 % by wt. of the <br>
30   phase in which it is found in.  Generally, it should<br>
comprise no more than 70 % of such phase.  A portion of the<br><br>
WO 2005/063192<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013789<br><br>

soluble polyols, glycerin, propylene glycol, sorbitol, polyethylene glycol, ethoxylated/propoxylated ethers of methyl glucose (eg., methyl gluceth-20) and ethoxylated/propoxylated ethers of lanolin alcohol e.g., Solulan-75).  Some other <br>
10   preferred moisturizers are the non-occlusive liquid water<br>
soluble polyols and the essential amino acid compounds found naturally in the skin.  Other preferred non-occlusive moisturizers are compounds found to be naturally occurring in the stratum corneum of the skin, such as sodium pyrrolidone <br>
15   carboxylic acid, lactic acid, urea, L-proline, guanidine and pyrrolidone.<br>
Examples of other non-occlusive moisturizers include hexadecyl, myristyl, isodecyl isopropyl esters of adipic,<br>
20   lactic, oleic, stearic, isostearic, myristic or linoleic<br>
acids, as well as many of their corresponding alcohol esters (sodium isostearoyl-2 lactylate, sodium capryl lactylate), hydrolyzed protein and other collagen-derived proteins, aloe vera gel and acetamide MEA. Other examples of both types<br>
25   occlusive and non-occlusive emollients are disclosed in<br>
