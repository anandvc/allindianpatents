The present invention relates to thermoplastic molding compositon.<br>
The invention relates to flameproof polycarbonate compositions that contain polyalkyl (alkyl)acrylate and halogen-free oligophosphates but no polymers in whose structure butadiene, styrene and acrylonitrile are involved, as well as moulded articles obtainable from these compositions. The compositions according to the invention have a good property profile, especially as regards flow line strength and resistance to chemicals, but also as regards elongation at break, thermal stability and melt flowability.<br>
Halogen-free flameproof polycarbonate blends are known.<br>
US-A 5,204,394 describes for example polymer mixtures of polycarbonate, a styrene-containing copolymer and/or a styrene-containing graft polymer that have been rendered flameproof with oligomeric phosphoric acid esters. Examples of such polymer mixtures are PC/ABS blends and PC/HIPS blends.<br>
For some applications it is desirable to provide compositions with comparable or improved properties that do not contain polymer components in whose structure styrene, butadiene and/or acrylonitrile are involved as monomer components. Such polymers and therefore also the compositions containing these polymers always contain, due to their production, traces of residual monomers including styrene, butadiene and acrylonitrile, which are regarded as critical for the use of the products produced therefrom in some areas of application.<br>
In JP-A 08 259 791 and JP-A 07 316 409 compositions are described that contain, in addition to polycarbonate, also a methyl methacrylate (MMA)-grafted silicone/acrylate composite rubber, a monomeric or oligomeric phosphoric acid ester, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). These compositions are flameproof and have a high notched-bar impact strength. The flowability of such compositions is however as a rule insufficient, especially if in order to achieve a good resistance to<br><br>
chemicals a polycarbonate with a sufficiently high molecular weight is used, and to achieve a satisfactory thermal stability a sufficiently small phosphoric acid ester fraction is employed. Similar comments apply to the compositions that are described in US 6,423,766 Bl and US 6,369,141 Bl.<br>
EP-A 0 463 368 describes compositions of polycarbonate, PMMA, ABS and a monomeric phosphoric acid ester that are flameproof and are characterised by an improved flow line strength. These compositions do not however satisfy the aforementioned desire for materials that are free of styrene, butadiene and acrylonitrile.<br>
The object of the present invention was to provide flameproof polycarbonate compositions that do not contain any polymers built up from at least one monomer selected from the group consisting of butadiene, styrene and acrylonitrile and are thus free of butadiene, acrylonitrile and styrene residual monomers, and that are characterised by a good property combination of improved flow line strength, resistance to chemicals, elongation at break and thermal stability with, compared to equivalent PC+ABS compositions, an unchanged good processability in injection moulding processes, i.e. that are characterised by melt flowability and flame resistance.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that compositions of aromatic polycarbonate, graft polymers based on butadiene-free and styrene-free rubbers as graft base and a styrene-free and acrylonitrile-free graft sheath based on alkyl (alkyl)acrylates, halogen-free phosphorus compounds as flameproofmg agents and (co)polymers based on alkyl (alkyl)acrylates and fluorinated polyolefins that are preferably used as master batch with (co)polymers based on alkyl (alkyl)acrylates as matrix, have the desired property profile.<br>
The present invention accordingly provides compositions containing<br>

(alkyl)acrylates.<br>
The   compositions   may   furthermore   contain   conventional   polymer   additives (component F).<br>

particularly preferably 0.2 to 0.5 part by weight of anti-drip agents,<br>

wherein the compositions according to the invention are free from monomeric butadiene, acrylonitrile and styrene or butadiene, acrylonitrile and styrene bonded in polymeric constituents, and the sum total of the parts by weight of all above-listed and optionally further components is standardised to 100.<br>

Graft polymers with a core/shell structure are preferably used as graft polymers C. Suitable graft bases C.l are for example acrylate, polyurethane, silicone as well as silicone-acrylate composite rubbers.<br>
Acrylate rubbers, silicone rubbers and silicone-acrylate composite rubbers are preferred. Silicone-acrylate composite rubbers are particularly preferred.<br>
These graft bases generally have a mean particle size (dso value) of 0.05 to 5 um, preferably 0.1 to 2 um, in particular 0.1 to 1 um.<br>
The mean particle size d50 is the diameter above and below which in each case 50% of the particles lie, and may be determined by means of ultracentrifuge measurements (W. Scholtan, H. Lange, Kolloid, Z. and Z. Polymere 250 (1972), 782-1796).<br><br>
The gel content of these graft bases is at least 30 wt.%, preferably at least 40 wt.% (measured in toluene).<br>
The gel content is determined at 25°C in a suitable solvent (M, Hoffmann, H. Kromer, R. Kuhn, Polymeranalytik I and II, Georg Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart 1977).<br>
Particularly preferred as graft base C.l are those acrylate rubbers, silicone rubbers or silicone-acrylate composite rubbers suitable for the graft polymers with a core/shell structure C, containing 0 to 100 wt.%, preferably 1 to 99 wt.%, in particular 10 to 99 wt.% and particularly preferably 30 to 99 wt.% of polyorganosiloxane component and 100 to 0 wt.%, preferably 99 to 1 wt.%, in particular 90 to 1 wt.% and particularly preferably 70 to 1 wt.% of polyalkyl (meth)acrylate rubber component (the total amount of the respective rubber components totals 100 wt.%).<br>

The polyorganosiloxane component in the silicone-acrylate composite rubber may be produced by reacting an organosiloxane and a multifunctional crosslinking agent in an emulsion polymerisation process. It is also possible to incorporate graft-active sites into the rubber by adding suitable unsaturated organosiloxanes.<br>
The organosiloxane is generally cyclic, the ring structures preferably containing 3 to 6 Si atoms. There may for example be mentioned hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, dodecamethylcyclohexa-siloxane, trimethyltriphenylcyclotrisiloxane, tetramethyltetraphenylcyclotetrasiloxane and octaphenylcyclotetrasiloxane , which may be used individually or as a mixture of two or more compounds.

3- or 4-functional silane compounds are generally used as crosslinking agents. The following particularly preferred compounds may be mentioned by way of example: trimethoxymethylsilane, triethoxyphenylsilane, tetramethoxysilane, tetraethoxysilane, tetra-n-propoxysilane, tetrabutoxysilane and 4-flmctional branching agents, in particular tetraethoxysilane. The amount of branching agent is generally 0 to 30 wt.% (referred to the polyorganosiloxane component in the silicone-acrylate rubber).<br>
Compounds that form one of the following structures are preferably used to incorporate graft-active sites in the polyorganosiloxane component of the silicone-acrylate rubber:<br><br><br>
p	is a number from 1 to 6.<br>
(Meth)acryloyloxysilane is a preferred compound for the formation of the structure<br>
(GI-1).	Preferred     (meth)acryloyloxysilanes     include     for     example     P-<br>
methacryloyloxyethyl-dimethoxy-methylsilane, y-methacryloyl-oxy-propylmethoxy-<br>
dimethylsilane,	y-methacryloyloxypropyl-dimethoxy-methylsilane,	y-<br>
methacryloyloxypropyl-trimethoxy-silane, y-methacryloyloxy-propyl-ethoxy-diethyl-silane, y-methacryloyloxypropyl-diethoxy-methylsilane, y-methacryloyloxy-butyl-diethoxy-methylsilane.<br>
Vinylsiloxanes, in particular tetramethyl-tetravinyl-cyclotetrasiloxane, are capable of forming the structure GI-2.<br>
For example, p-vinylphenyl-dimethoxy-methylsilane can form the structure GI-3. y-mercaptopropyldimethoxy-methylsilane, y-mercaptopropylmethoxy-dimethyIsi lane, y-mercaptopropyldiethoxymethylsilane can form the structure GI-4.<br>
The amount of these compounds is 0 to 10 wt.%, preferably 0.5 to 5 wt% (referred to the polyorganosiloxane component).<br>
The acrylate component in the silicone-acrylate composite rubber may be produced from alkyl (meth)acrylates, crosslinking agents and graft-active monomer units.<br>
As alkyl (meth)acrylates the following may be mentioned by way of example and are preferred: alkyl acrylates such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, n-propyl acrylate, n-butyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate and alkyl methacrylates such as hexyl methacrylate, 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate and n-lauryl methacrylate; n-butyl acrylate is particularly preferred.<br>
Multifunctional compounds may be used as crosslirvking agents. The following may be mentioned here by way of example: ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, propylene glycol<br><br>
dimethacrylate, 1,3-butylene glycol dimethacrylate and 1,4-butylene glycol dimethacrylate.<br>
The following compounds may be used for example, individually or as a mixture, for the insertion of graft-active sites: allyl methacrylate, triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate and allyl methacrylate. Allyl methacrylate may also act as crosslinking agent. These compounds are used in amounts of 0.1 to 20 wt.% referred to the acrylate rubber component in the silicone-acrylate composite rubber.<br>
Methods for the production of the silicone-acrylate composite rubbers preferably used in the compositions according to the invention as well as their grafting with monomers are described for example in US-A 4 888 388, JP 08 259 791 A2, JP 07 316 409A and EP-A 0 315 035. As graft base C.l for the graft polymer C there may be used those silicone-acrylate composite rubbers whose silicone and acrylate components form a core/shell structure, as well as those that form a network in which the acrylate and silicone components completely interpenetrate one another (interpenetrating network).<br>
The graft polymerisation on the aforedescribed graft bases may be carried out in suspension, dispersion or emulsion. Continuous or batchwise emulsion polymerisation is preferred. This graft polymerisation is carried out using free-radical initiators (e.g. peroxides, azo compounds, hydroperoxides, persulfates, perphosphates) and optionally with the use of anionic emulsifiers, for example carboxonium salts, sulfonic acid salts or organic sulfates. In this way graft polymers are formed with high graft yields, i.e. a large proportion of the polymer of the graft monomers is chemically bonded to the rubber.<br>
The graft shell C.2 is formed from (meth)acrylic acid (C1-C6) alkyl esters, preferably methyl methacrylate, n-butyl acrylate and/or tert.-butyl acrylate.<br>
Particularly preferably the graft shell consists of one or a mixture of several pure (meth)acrylic acid (C1-C8) alkyl esters, in particular of pure methyl methacrylate.<br><br><br>
R', R5 R5 and R4' independently of one another in each case denote C1 to C8-alkyl, or C5 to C6-cycloalkyl, C6 to C20-aryl or C7 to C12-aralkyl in each case optionally substituted by alky], preferably C1 to C4-alkyl,<br>
n	independently of one another is 0 or 1<br>
q	is 0 to 30, and<br>
X	denotes a mononuclear or polynuclear aromatic radical with 6 to 30 C atoms, or<br>

Preferably R1 R5, R5 and R4 independently of one another denote C1 to C4-alkyl, phenyl, naphthyl or phenyl-C1-C4-alkyl. The aromatic groups R1, R5, R5 and R4 may in turn be substituted by alkyl groups, preferably C1 to C4-alkyl. Particularly preferred aryl radicals are cresyl, phenyl, xylenyl, propylphenyl or butylphenyl.<br>
X	in the formula (IV) preferably denotes a mononuclear or polynuclear aromatic<br>
radical with 6 to 30 C atoms. This is preferably derived from diphenols of the formula (1).<br><br>
n	in the formula (IV) may independently of one another be 0 or 1, and n is<br>
preferably equal to 1.<br>
q	denotes values from 0 to 30, preferably 0.5 to 15, particularly preferably 0.8 to<br>
10, especially 1 to 5, and most particularly preferably 1 to 2,<br><br><br>

The phosphorus compounds according to component D are known (see for example EP-A 0 363 608, EP-A 0 640 655) or can be produced in a similar manner by known methods (see for example UUmanns Enzyklopadie der Technischen Chemie, Vol. 18, p. 301 ff. 1979; Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Vol. 12/1, p. 43; Beilstein Vol. 6, p. 177).<br>
The mean q values may be found by determining the composition of the phosphate mixture (molecular weight distribution) by means of suitable methods (gas chromatography (GC), high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), gel permeation chromatography (GPC)) and calculating therefrom the mean values for q.<br><br>
Component E<br>
The flameproofing agents corresponding to component D are often used in combination with so-called anti-drip agents, which reduce the tendency of the material to form burning droplets in the event of fire. By way of example there may be mentioned here compounds from the classes of substances comprising fluorinated polyolefms, silicones as well as aramide fibres. These may also be employed in the compositions according to the invention. Fluorinated polyolefms are preferably used as anti-drip agents.<br>
Fluorinated polyolefins are known and are described for example in EP-A 0 640 655. They are marketed by DuPont, for example under the trade name Teflon® 30N.<br>
The fluorinated polyolefins may be used in the pure form. However, they are preferably used in the form of a master batch.<br>
As master batch there may be used for example coagulated mixtures of emulsions of the fluorinated polyolefins with emulsions of the graft polymers (component C) or with emulsions of an acrylate-based (co)polymer (component B), wherein the fluorinated polyolefin is mixed as an emulsion with an emulsion of the graft polymer or of the copolymer and is then coagulated.<br>
Furthermore, the master batches can be prepared by precompounding the fluorinated polyolefins with the graft polymer (component C) or (co)polymer (component B), preferably polymethyl methacrylate. The fluorinated polyolefms are mixed as powder with a powder or granular material of the graft polymer or copolymer and compounded in the melt in general at temperatures from 200° to 330°C in conventional equipment such as internal kneaders, extruders or double-shaft screw extruders.<br>
The master batches may furthermore be prepared by emulsion polymerisation of at least one alkyl (alkyl)acrylate monomer in the presence of an aqueous dispersion of the<br><br>
fluorinated polyolefin. After precipitation with acid and subsequent drying, the polymer is used as a flowable powder.<br>
The master batches usually have solids contents of fluorinated polyolefin of 5 to 95 wt.%, preferably 7 to 80 wt.%.<br>
The fluorinated polyolefins may preferably be used in concentrations of 0 to 2 parts by weight, preferably 0 to 1 part by weight, in particular 0.1 to 1 part by weight and most particularly preferably 0.2 to 0.5 part by weight, these quantitative figures referring to the pure fluorinated polyolefin in the case where a master batch is used.<br>
Component F (further additives)<br>
The compositions according to the invention may furthermore contain up to 20 parts by weight, preferably up to 10 parts by weight and in particular up to 5 parts by weight of at least one conventional polymer additive such as a lubricant or mould release agent, for example pentaerythritol tetrastearate, a nucleating agent, an antistatic, a stabiliser, a light-stability agent, a filler and reinforcing agent, a dye or pigment, as well as a further flameproofmg agent or a flameproofing synergist, for example an inorganic substance in nanoscale form and/or a silicate material such as talcum or wollastonite.<br>
Furthermore the compositions according to the invention may contain up to 20 parts by weight, preferably up to 10 parts by weight and in particular up to 5 parts by weight of fiirther polymer components such as polyphenylene oxides, polyesters, epoxy resins or novolak resins.<br>
All figures relating to parts by weight in this application are standardised so that the sum total of the parts by weight of all components in the composition is 100.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are produced by mixing the respective constituents in a known manner and meh-compounding and melt-extruding the<br><br>
compositions at temperatures of 200°C to 300°C in conventional equipment such as internal kneaders, extruders and double-shaft screw extruders.<br>
The mixing of the individual constituents may be carried out in a known manner successively as well as simultaneously, and more specifically at about 20°C (room temperature) as well as at higher temperatures.<br>
The compositions according to the invention may be used to produce all types of moulded parts. These may be produced for example by injection moulding, extrusion and blow moulding processes. A further form of processing is the production of moulded parts by thermoforming from previously fabricated sheets or films.<br>
The invention accordingly also provides a process for the production of the composition, its use for the production of moulded parts, as well as the moulded parts themselves.<br>
Examples of such moulded parts are sheets, profiled sections, all types of housing parts, e.g. for domestic appliances such as juice presses, coffee-making machines, mixers; for office equipment such as monitors, printers, copiers; also panels, tubing, electrical installation ducting, profiled sections for internal and external applications in the building and construction sector; parts for the electrical equipment sector such as switches and plugs, as well as internal and external vehicle parts.<br>
In particular the compositions according to the invention may be used for example to produce the following moulded parts:<br>
Internal structural parts for tracked vehicles, boats, aircraft, buses and automobiles, housings for electrical equipment containing small transformers, housings for equipment for information processing and transmission, housings and casings for medical purposes, massage equipment and housings therefor, children's toy vehicles, planar wall elements, housings for safety devices and equipment, bathroom fittings, cover gratings for ventilator openings and housings for gardening tools.<br><br>
