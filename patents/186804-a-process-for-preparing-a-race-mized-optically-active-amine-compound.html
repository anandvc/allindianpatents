				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparing a racemized optically active amine compound and more particularly to a process for<br>
racemizing optically active amines of the formula (1) below which comprises reacting said optically active amine with a complex of an alkali metal and a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. Background art<br>
Useful as optical resolution agents or asymmetric auxiliary agents, as ligands for metals in an asymmetric reaction, and as intermediates for pharmaceuticals are optically active amines of the following formula (1):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1 is an unsubstituted aryl group; an aryl group substituted with one to five substituents selected from the group consisting of C1-C4alkyl groups, C1-C4alkoxy groups and halogen atoms; or an<br>
unsubstituted  or substituted  heterocyclic  group;<br>
R2 is aC1-C8 alkyl group; a C1-C8alkyl group substituted with one to three aryl groups; a C1-C8alkoxy group; a Ci-Caalkoxy group substituted with one to three aryl groups; an unsubstituted aryloxy group; an aryloxy group substituted with one to five substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen atoms, C1-C4 alkyl groups,C1-C4alkoxy groups and methyl groups substituted with one to three halogen atoms; or an unsubstituted<br><br>
aryl group; an aryl group substituted with one to five substituents selected from the group consisting of C1-C4alkyl groups, C1-C4 alkoxy groups and halogen atoms; or an unsubstituted or substituted heterocyclic group; provided that these unsubstituted and substituted aryl and heterocyclic groups are not identical to Ri;<br>
R3 and R4, which may be identical or different, are chosen from hydrogen atoms, C1-C4alkyl groups, C1-C4alkyl groups substituted with one to three aryl groups, or C1-C4 alkyl-CO-groups;<br>
A is a C1-C10 alkylene group; and<br>
* indicates the position of the asymmetric carbon atom.<br>
In particular, the optically active amine of the formula (1) wherein R1is phenyl, R2 is isopropyl, R3 and R4 are both hydrogen atoms, and A is methylene, i.e., optically active 3-methyl-2-phenylbutylamine (PBA) is a useful compound as an optical resolution agent.   The compound is used as an optical resolution agent for obtaining only one optically active isomer from racemic Ibuprofen   [2-(4-isobutylphenyl)-propionic  acid],   Ketoprofen   [2-(3-benzoylphenyl)-propionic acid] or the like, the isomer being useful as a resolution-analgesic, antipyretic or antirheumatic agent [Japanese Patent Publication (Kokai) Nos. 229986/1993 and 151344/1996].<br>
At present, optically active PBA can be obtained by resolving racemic PBA using an optically active acid such as mandelic acid [Japanese Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 172853/1986] or by selectively hydrolyzing an amide of PBA with an enzyme [Japanese Patent Application No. 215722/1995].   A method utilizing a reaction in which a nitrile is optically and<br><br>
selectively hydrated by an enzyme has also been developed [Japanese Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 303496/1995].<br>
If an optically active compound having either one of the steric configurations is desired and if one intends to obtain the optically active compound by optical resolution of its racemic body, in general, the desired optically active compound is obtained only in 50% yield even at maximum, and 50% of undesired optically active compound remains.   Accordingly, if one intends to obtain an optically active compound by an optical resolution process, it is important to develop a process for racemization and/or inversion of the steric configuration of the undesired optically active compound so as to increase the yield of the desired optically active compound.<br>
A number of processes for racemizing an amine compound in which the carbon atom at the a-position of the amino group is an asymmetric carbon atom have been developed, including, amongst others, a process of heating the amine compound under a hydrogen pressure with a catalyst for catalytic reduction such as Raney nickel, Raney cobalt or the like [Japanese Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 185943/1988], a process utilizing an imine formed by a reaction of the amine compound with a carbonyl compound [Japanese Patent Publication (Kokai) Nos. 23824/1988 and 188120/1995], a process utilizing sodium hydride or sodium amide [DE-OS 2,348,801], and a process uttltzing sodium activated by a polycyciic aromatic compound or a carrier such as alumina [Japanese Patent Publication (Kokai) Nos. 50328/1975, 50344/1975 and 49235/1975].<br>
However, up to now, no process has been known for effectively racemizing an amine compound in which a carbon atom<br><br>
at the p-position of the amino group or positions distal therefrom is an asymmetric carbon atom (for example PBA).<br>
In view of these facts, the present inventors intended to develop an industrially applicable process for effectively racemizing an amine compound in which a carbon atom at the p-position of the amino group or positions distal therefrom is an asymmetric carbon atom (for example PBA).<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Now, it was found that surprisingly an amine compound, in which a carbon atom at the p-position of the amino group or positions distal therefrom is an asymmetric carbon atom, can be effectively racemized by reacting the amine compound with a complex of an alkali metal and a poly cyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a process for preparing a racemized optically active amine compound which comprises racemizing an optically active amine of the formula (1) :<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1 is an unsubstituted aryl group; an aryl group substituted with one to five substituents selected from the group consisting of C1-C4 alkyl groups, C1-C4alkoxy groups and halogen atoms; or an unsubstituted or substituted heterocyclic group;<br>
* indicates the position of the asymmetric carbon atom.<br>
R2 is a C1-C8 alkyl group; a C1-C8 alkyl group substituted with one to three aryl groups; a C1-C8alkoxy group; a Ci-Csalkoxy group substituted with one to three aryl groups; an unsubstituted aryloxy group; an aryloxy group substituted with one to five substituents<br><br>
selected from the group consisting of halogen atoms, Ci-C4alkyl groups, C1-C4alkoxy groups and methyl groups substituted with one to three halogen atoms; or an unsubstituted aryl group; an aryl group substituted with one to five substituents selected from the group consisting of C1-C4alkyl groups, C1-C4 alkoxy groups and halogen atoms; or an unsubstituted or substituted heterocyclic group; provided that these unsubstituted and substituted aryl and heterocyclic groups are not identical to R1;<br>
R3 and R4, which may be identical or different, are chosen, from hydrogen atoms, C1-C4alkyl groups, C1-C4alkyl groups substituted with one to three aryl groups, or C1-C4alkyl-CO- groups; and<br>
A is a C1-C10 alkylene group;<br>
by reacting said amine with a complex of an alkali metal as herein described and a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon as herein described.<br>
If racemization of an optically acitve compound is carried out using a base, an abstraction reaction of the hydrogen atom on the asymmetric carbon atom is essential. Accordingly, racemization at the position of an asymmetric carbon atom occurs easily, as the hydrogen atom bound to the asymmetric carbon atom is relatively acidic. The acidity of an hydrogen atom which binds to a carbon atom at the P-position of the amino group or positions distal therefrom becomes lower than that of the hydrogen atom which binds to the carbon atom at the a-position of the amino group on account of a reduction in the inductive effect. Accordingly, it could not be predicted that a process which can effectively racemize an amine compound having an asymmetric carbon atom at the a-position of the amino group would be applicable to an amine<br><br>
compound having an asymmetric carbon atom at the ß-position of the amino group or positions distal therefrom as well.<br>
As stated above, several processes for racemizing an amine compound having an asymmetric carbon atom at the α-position of the amino group are known.   These processes include a process utilizing a complex of an alkali metal (sodium) and a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (naphthalene or anthracene) [Japanese Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 49235/1975].   However, there is no case in which the process is applied to an amine compound having an asymmetric carbon atom at theß-position of<br>
the amino group or positions distal therefrom, and it was predicted that, if the process was applied to such an amine compound, the effectiveness of the process would be reduced in a similar manner as is the case when using other processes utilizing sodium hydride or sodium amide.<br>
Under such circumstances, the present inventors found that the process utilizing a complex of an alkali metal and a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon is superior to the other processes and can effectively racemize an amine compound having an asymmetric carbon atom at the p-position of the amino group or<br>
positions distal therefrom, and thus the present invention was accomplished.<br>

There are, among the amine compounds of the above formula (1), favorable groups for applying the present process.<br>
Thus, the present process is preferably used for racemizing optically active amines of the formula (1) wherein R1 is an unsubstituted phenyl or naphthyl group; a phenyl or naphthyl group substituted with one to five substituents selected from the group consisting of C1-C4alkyl groups, C1-C4alkoxy groups and halogen atoms; or an unsubstituted heterocyclic group; R2 is aC1-C4 alkyl group; a Ci-C4alkyl group substituted with one to three phenyl groups; a Ci-C4alkoxy group; a C1-C4alkoxy group substituted with one to three phenyl groups; an unsubstituted phenyloxy or naphthyloxy group; a phenyloxy or naphthyloxy group substituted with a substituent selected from the group consisting of halogen atoms, C1-C4alkyl groups, C1-C4alkoxy groups and methyl groups substituted with one to three halogen atoms; or an unsubstituted heterocyclic group; R3 and R4, which may be identical or different,<br><br>

Furthermore, the present process is preferably used for racemizing optically active amines of the following formula (2):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R5 is a hydrogen atom, a C1-C4alkyl group, a C1-C4 alkoxy group or a halogen atom, R6 is a C1-C4alkyl group or aC1-C4 alkoxy group, R7 is a hydrogen atom or a C1-C4alkyl group, B is a methylene or ethylene group, and * indicates the position of the asymmetric carbon atom.<br>
More preferably, the present process is used for<br><br>
racemizing optically active amines of the above formula (2) wherein R6 is isopropyl group and B is methylene group.<br>
Also, the present process is preferably used for racemizing optically active amines of the above formula (2) wherein R6 is methyl group or methoxy group and B is ethylene group.<br>
Most preferably, the present process is used for racemizing optically active amines of the above formula (2) wherein R5 is hydrogen atom, R6 is isopropyl group, R7 is hydrogen atom, and B is methylene group (PBA).<br>
Racemic amine compounds of the above formula (1) or (2) can be obtained by known organic syntheses or are commercially available.    Optically active amine compounds for racemizing according to the present process are frequently the residue obtained after optically resolving such racemic compounds and separating either one of the desired optically active isomers.   Accordingly, the optical purity of the optically active amine compounds used in the present process may be about 100%e.e. (enantiomer excess) or may be lower than this value and about 20 to 99%e.e.<br>
Also, in the present process, racemization of optically active amines means that amines having a relatively high optical purity are converted into amines having a relatively low optical purity.   Thus, according to the present process, optical purity of the optically active amines as described above is reduced to 50% or below, preferably 20% or below, more preferably 10% or below, and most preferably 5% or below, relative to the optical purity of the starting amines.<br>
The complex of an alkali metal and a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon used in the present process is a complex prepared from<br><br>
an alkali metal such as lithium, sodium or potassium and a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon such as naphthalene, alkylated naphthalene, anthracene, biphenyl, alkylated biphenyl or phenanthrene.   Preferred complexes are those prepared from sodium and naphthalene, sodium and anthracene, or sodium and biphenyl.<br>
The molar ratio of alkali metal to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon used is 50-0.5:1, preferably 20-0.7:1, and more preferably 10-0.9:1.<br>
This type of complex is commercially available [for example, sodium-naphthalene complex (molar ratio of sodium to naphthalene is 1:1) from Kawaken Fine Chemical (Kabushiki Kaisha)], or can be easily prepared by mixing an alkali metal and a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon in an aprotic solvent such as toluene or THF. Also, it is advantageous to prepare the complex used in the present process such as sodium-naphthalene or sodium-anthracene complex using the amine compound to be racemized as the solvent. Furthermore, complex formation can be accelerated by sonicating a mixture consisting of an alkali metal, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and solvent, or by heating the mixture.<br>
The present inventors found that an alkali metal-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon complex can be prepared by using the amine compound to be racemized as the solvent, and sonicating a mixture of the amine compound with the alkali metal and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, or heating the mixture.   By doing so, the need to use a solvent such as THF when preparing the complex is omitted. In addition, they found that there is no need to use the alkali metal and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon in equimolar amounts but that the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon can be used in considerably<br><br>
small amounts per alkali metal (molar ratio of alkali metal to poiycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon is in the range from 20:1 to 2:1). Thus, it is possible to reduce the amount of added poiycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, which must be removed after reaction.<br>
The amount of complex used per unit of the amine compound to be racemized may be a catalytic amount and the molar ratio of the amine compound to complex is in the range from 1:1 to 200:1, preferably from 2:1 to 100:1, and more preferably from 3:1 to 20:1.    To shorten the reaction time, a relatively large amount of the complex may be used.   Also, the complex may all be added at the beginning of the reaction, or it may be added in portions according to progress of the reaction.<br>
The present racemizing reaction can be carried out without a solvent or in an aprotic solvent (toluene, THF, etc.). Racemization may be carried out by previously preparing a complex of an alkali metal and a poiycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon either with or without a solvent and then adding the amine compound to the complex, or by simultaneously mixing the alkali metal, poiycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and amine compound either with or without a solvent.<br>
Also, the present racemizing reaction is preferably carried out under an inert gas (nitrogen, argon, etc.) atmosphere.<br>
Moreover, the present racemizing reaction is desirably carried out under anhydrous conditions.    However, if an amine compound to be racemized contains an amount of moisture, for example, the racemization can be accomplished using the complex in an excess amount depending on the equivalent amount of the complex quenched by the moisture.<br><br>
It was found that the racemization can be accelerated by using an alkali metal halide (for example, KCI, Kl or LiCI) as an additive.   Such an additive is added to the reaction system so that a molar ratio of the amine compound to additive is in the range from 1:1 to 200:1, preferably from 2:1 to 100:1, and more preferably from 4:1 to 20:1.<br>
The reaction temperature is normally in the range from -20 to 100°C, preferably from 0 to 70°C, and more preferably from 10 to 40°C.   The reaction time is normally in the range from 1 to 100 hours and more conventionally from 3 to 30 hours, although it can vary according to the reaction conditions such as the amount of complex added and the reaction temperature.<br>
After the reaction, the reaction mixture is extracted using an organic solvent under acidic conditions to transfer the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon into an organic layer and the amine into an aqueous layer.   The organic solvent is not limited to a particular one but may be a solvent immiscible with water such as toluene, hexane, ethers and esters.   Then, the aqueous layer is alkalified with a base such as sodium hydroxide and extracted with an organic solvent as described above to obtain the desired amine. Although an amine having sufficiently high purity is obtained by the procedure, an amine having much higher purity may be obtained by carrying out distillation or the like, if necessary.<br><br>
Examples<br>
The present invention is illustrated more particularly based on the following examples, but it is not limited thereto.<br>
In the examples, the optical purity of PBA is indicated by enantiomer excess (%e.e.), and determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis under the following conditions:<br>
Column:      CROWNPAK CR (+) [Daicel] 0.4 x 15cm;<br>
Eluate:       0.1N HCI04 aqueous solution/methanol = 85/15;<br>
Flow rate:	0.8  ml/min.;<br>
Temperature:       40°C;<br>
Detection:	UV 210nm.<br>
The titration yield of PBA is determined by titrating a solution of 500mg of the post-reaction mixture in 30ml of methanol, using 0.1N hydrochloric acid, and using phenolphthalein as the indicator.<br>
Example 1:   Racemization of (S)-PBA with a sodium-naphthalene complex<br>
(S)-PBA having an optical purity of about 100% (10.64g) and sodium-naphthalene (molar ratio of sodium/naphthalene = 1/1) (0.95g, 9.6mol%) were mixed in a reaction vessel at room temperature (about 23 to 28°C) under nitrogen atmosphere.   After about 5 minutes, the mixture became a brown solution.   The mixture was then stirred for 6 hours at room temperature.    After using methanol to terminate the reaction, hexane (30ml), cone, hydrochloric acid (20ml) and water (20ml) were added to the mixture and extraction was carried out.   The hexane layer was separated and the aqueous layer was alkalified by adding sodium<br><br>
