				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is related to a process for the production of/calcium carbonate via precipitation from solubilized calcium ions and carbonate ions, and to the products of the process, and to paper products produced using the products of the process.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The manufacture and supply of high quality calcium carbonate for paper filler and for paper coatings is now widely practiced around the world. Relatively recently, particularly as alkaline papermaking has become popular, the on-site manufacture of precipitated calcium carbonate ("PCC") from aqueous solutions in atmospheric tanks has also been developed and implemented at a variety of locations. These on-site plants have developed because transportation costs of either a dry powder or of a liquid slurry of calcium carbonate was generally prohibitive. However, the variability of product.<br>
quality from the heretofore-employed on-site PCC plants has been problematic at times. Such problems are especially acute in those locales where relatively impure sources of carbon dioxide have been employed, such as from boilers burning a variety of solid or liquid waste fuels. Also, the particle size distribution of the PCC obtained from various prior art processes has been less than optimum, and consequently, it would be advantageous to provide a process in which the particle size distribution could be more effectively controlled.<br>
In processes employed for the manufacture of precipitated calcium carbonate, several fundamental chemical reaction steps are normally employed, which steps can be generally summarized as follows:<br>
(1)	Calcination - heating limestone (calcium carbonate) and driving the<br>
carbon dioxide out, resulting in the formation of lime (calcium oxide).<br>
(2)	Slaking - reacting lime with water to form a lime slurry (calcium<br>
hydroxide; Ca(OH)2); this reaction is accompanied by the evolution of heat.<br>
(3)	Carbonation - reacting the lime slurry with carbon dioxide so that the<br>
solubilized calcium from the calcium hyroxide is reacted with the carbonate produced<br>
by bubbling the carbon dioxide in water, to form the desired calcium carbonate; this<br>
reaction is also exothermic.<br>
Various prior art techniques disclose methods of preparing different PCC crystal morphologies, shapes, sizes, and size distribution of for the precipitated calcium carbonate. Although the prior art known to me teaches the use of process variables such as carbon dioxide concentration, calcium hydroxide concentration, temperature, and the use of chemical additives, none of such prior art processes known to me utilizes the step<br>
of carbonation under pressure, either alone or in combination with other heretofore utilized variables, as a technique for increasing the reaction rate, carbonation efficiency, or for making finer PCC particles. The prior art has also not employed pressurization of the carbonation reaction as a method for increasing the rate of formation of carbonate and calcium ions, the formation of which (and especially the latter) are the primary limitation in increasing the rate of carbonation reaction.<br>
Moreover, the various prior art methods utilized for production of precipitated calcium carbonate in papermaking operations can be characterized in that the carbonation reaction has been carried out in an atmospheric pressure vented or open vessel. This means that the partial pressure of carbon dioxide available in the carbonation reactor has been limited based on the concentration of carbon dioxide available in an incoming gas stream.<br>
It is in the carbonation reaction that the soluble calcium from the calcium hydroxide is converted to calcium carbonate. Then, more sombilization of the calcium ion takes place as the calcium hydroxide (lime slurry) is dissolved, and this proceeds until all of the available calcium hydroxide is converted into calcium carbonate. In this reaction, the reaction rate of calcium ions combining with carbonate ions is almost instantaneous. Consequently, the slow kinetic step which controls the overall reaction rate is believed to be the rate of dissolution of calcium hydroxide in the lime slurry, so that calcium ions are available for reaction. In conventional industrial processes for the manufacture of calcium carbonate, a slurry of approximately 200 gm/L of calcium hydroxide placed in an atmospheric reactor, and a gas containing from about 15% to about 20% by volume of carbon dioxide is bubbled through the slurry. In general, suchprior art processes have a reaction rate such that calcium carbonate is formed at the rate of from about 0.5 grams per liter of slurry per minute to about 1.5 grams per liter of slurry per minute. Thus, for a batch charge of 200 grams per liter of calcium hydroxide, about 200 minutes is required to complete the reaction, per liter of slurry.<br>
In general, the currently utilized manufacturing processes are slow, with low carbonation efficiencies. Thus, manufacturing plants utilizing such prior art processes require large equipment, resulting in high capital costs per unit of calcium carbonate production.<br>
Relatively recently, approximately eighty percent (80%) of the world paper production has been converted to an alkaline papermaking process. In that process, precipitated calcium carbonate ("PCC") is employed as the primary filler. An average papermill may require from about 20,000 to about 100,000 tons per year of PCC.  To meet such demands, the production of PCC has shifted from off-site to on-site.   One important advantage of on-site PCC production has been the saving of transportation costs. Also, a primary raw material for PCC production, namely carbon dioxide, is available free at many mills, as a waste product from lime kiln flue gas. Such gas normally contains from about twelve percent to about twenty five percent (12%-25%) of carbon dioxide. However, one limitation encountered was that variability and fluctuation in the carbon dioxide concentration in the flue gas produced variability in the resulting PCC. Moreover, some mills do not have lime kilns, and free on-site sources of carbon dioxide are limited to flue gas from gas fired boilers, which only have seven to ten percent (7-10%) carbon dioxide concentration. In such situations, it has not heretofore been economical to place an "on-site" PCC plant at the mill location.Thus, in order to manufacture large quantities calcium carbonate as required in papermaking operations, it has heretofore been necessary to provide very large reactors (for example, reactors in the 18,000 gallons to 20,000 gallons range are common). Thus it is evident that it would be desirable to provide a process in which the overall production rate of calcium carbonate is increased, thereby reducing the reactor size for a desired PCC production rate. It would also be advantageous to develop a process which (a) can utilize low CO2 containing gas, and (b) in which the effects of fluctuation in CO2 concentration on particle size distribution of PCC can be minimized.<br>
Several prior art processes are known which superficially resemble portions of my process to some limited extent. In U.S. Patent No. 3,304,154 issued on February 14, 1967 to Dimitrios Kiouzes-Pezas for a Process for Producing Spheroidal Alkaline Earth Metal Carbonates, carbon dioxide gas is bubbled through a cylindrical autoclave reactor having a calcium hydroxide suspension therein. Pressure in the reactor was accumulated until a pressure from about 4 to 6 atmospheres gauge, and preferably about 5 atmospheres gage, was built up.   Then, the reactor was rotated, while keeping the temperature between 60° to 90° Centigrade. However, that process has some practical limitations and thus is not well suited to the on-site production of PCC. First, it is difficult to produce the needed quantities (up to 100,000 tons per year) from such reactors, and starting at the low calcium hydroxide concentrations taught therein. Second, the process only produces spheroidal crystal structures. Finally, the rotation of the reactor presents various practical mechanical problems, and would result in undesirable cost and expense.In U.S. Patent No. 5,164,006 issued on November 17,1992 to Vasant Chapnerkar et al, for a Method for Preparing Acid Resistant Calcium Carbonate Pigments, gaseous carbon dioxide is added to a slurry of calcium hydroxide under atmospheric conditions. This conventional prior art process has a calculated reaction rate of approximately 1.0 grams per liter of slurry per minute, to produce a PCC product having a sclenohedral crystal habit with a surface area of 27,000 cm2/gram (Blaine method). However, pressure carbonation was not utilized in that prior art process.<br>
In U.S. Patent No. 5,215,734 issued on June 1,1993 to Charles Kunesh et al, for Rhombohedral Calcium Carbonate and Accelerated Heat-Aging Process for the Production Thereof, a method of hydro-thermal post treatment of PCC is described. In that process, PCC produced under conventional process conditions is "heat aged" in a hydrothermal bomb at temperatures of up to 300°C for from 1 to about 24 hours, to cause the crystal structure to change to a rhombohedral PCC having a surface area of from about 3 to about 15 m2/gram. So, this prior art technique uses conventional atmospheric PCC production, at relatively low reaction rates, before pressurization is utilized.<br>
In summary, there continues to be a need for a high efficiency, simple method of production of PCC that is capable of efficiently producing large quantities of<br>
precipitated calcium carbonate. And, it would be advantageous to be able to employ such a process for on-site production of PCC at locations where only relatively dilute gas streams containing low percentages of carbon dioxide are available.  Finally, it would be advantageous to employ such a process with flexible manufacturing capability, so that desired crystal shapes and sizes can be produced when and whererequired to meet the manufacturing requirements of a paper mill. Importantly, it would be desirable that PCC produced from a new method of on-site production of PCC would improve the properties of paper produced when utilizing the product from such a novel PCC manufacturing process.<br>
OBJECTS, ADVANTAGES, AND NOVEL FEATURES<br>
My novel manufacturing process for producing precipitated calcium carbonate can be advantageously applied to a variety of paper mill or manufacturing plant locations.   This is because my process can advantageously employ low concentrations of carbon dioxide in reaction gas, such as may be found in stack gas_from package<br>

SUMMARY<br>
I have now invented, and disclose herein, a novel process for the manufacture of precipitated calcium carbonate ("PCC").   This manufacturing process does not have the above-discussed drawbacks common to heretofore-employed on-site PCC production methods of which I am aware.  The process increases the carbon dioxide utilization efficiency, and thus overcomes the heretofore-encountered shortcomings with respect to utilization of gas streams containing low concentrations of carbon dioxide. Also, it enables effective process control, providing a method for creating relatively uniform particle sizes, and thus reliably controlling crystal quality. And, because the PCC production rate and the lime slaking rate can be effectively matched, the equipment employed in the process achieves a high utilization rate, thus decreasing capital costs on an installed cost per unit of production capacity basis.<br>
My method for the production of precipitated calcium carbonate involves providing lime, either as calcium oxide or calcium hydroxide, and mixing the calcium oxide or calcium hydroxide with a solvent until a calcium hydroxide slurry is formed, with the slurry containing an undissolved solute comprising a calcium containing molecule, preferably calcium hydroxide, and a solution comprising calcium ions. Preferably, the solvent is water, and an aqueous slurry is provided by slaking the lime. Also, lime slurry can be manufactured in batches that are sized to match a desired charge volume for a carbonation reactor, or more preferably, the lime slurry can be continuously manufactured. In this way, a sequential or semi-continuous operation can be provided wherein lime slaking is matched to utilization of a slurry in a carbonation reaction batch. The lime slurry is charged to the carbonation reactor, which reactor is maintained at a pressure above the prevailing atmospheric pressure at the plant locale, while passing a gas stream containing carbon dioxide through the reactor.   Carbonate ions are produced from dissociation or dissolution of the carbon dioxide in aqueous slurry, which carbonate ions react with calcium ions available from the solution carrying the lime slurry, to form a calcium carbonate precipitate. In a preferred embodiment, the lime slurry is fed to the carbonation reactor at a pH of 12 or more, and the carbonation reaction is carried out until substantially all available calcium is reacted, as indicated by reduction in pH to a pre-selected endpoint, which occurs when no further hydroxide ions become available via solvating of calcium hydroxide.   When the desired endpoint pH is reached, which endpoint is normally at least as low as 8.5, the precipitated calcium carbonate is discharged from the carbonation reactor, and thereafter, another lime slurry charge is fed to the reactor, and the carbonation reactionis resumed. For commonly encountered temperatures and pressures, such as normal temperature and pressure (25°C and atmospheric pressure) the lime slurry (at about 200 grams per liter) comprising calcium ions contains about 1.6 grams per liter of soluble calcium hydroxide, as ion. Preferably, the carbonation reaction is carried out in a continuous stirred tank reactor with a high shear mechanical mixer, in order to increase the reaction rate.<br>
In my novel process, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide available for the carbonation reaction is increased by way of pressurization of the incoming gas stream to the carbonation reactor. This can normally be conveniently accomplished by quenching (cooling) and scrubbing an available stack gas, and then compressing the cleaned and cooled incoming gas in a gas compressor, before sending the compressed gas to the carbonation reactor.<br>

A novel process for producing precipitated calcium carbonate is provided which enables the efficient use of "free" carbon dioxide found in flue gas, and more particularly, from flue gas containing relatively low concentrations of carbon dioxide. This process is capable of providing a variety of PCC morphologies, and the use of such PCC produced by this process has some unique properties for use as a filler in papermaking operations. This in turn results in some unusual and beneficial paper properties for the superior paper products made with the PCC provided according to the inventive process disclosed herein. Importantly, the precipitated carbonates that can be manufactured by this process include distinct crystal morphologies including calcite scalenohedral, calcite rhombohedral of various aspect ratios, and aragonite.<br>
The basic chemistry for producing precipitated calcium carbonates is well known, and the basic steps of calcination, slaking, and carbonation, were noted above. The following chemical reactions describe such basic steps:<br>
CaCO3      ▲H→  CaO + C02↑	(1)<br>
CaO+H2O      - &gt;      Ca(OH)2 + AH	(2)         ~pH 12.4<br>
Ca(OH)2 + CO2— &gt;   CaCO3 + H2O + AH	(3)         - pH 9.4<br>
The final carbonation reaction is an equilibrium reaction. Therefore, as the soluble calcium ion is converted to calcium carbonate precipitate, more dissolution of the calcium hydroxide takes place from the lime slurry to increase the concentration of the calcium ion up to the solvent solubility limits (inverse temperature dependentphenomenon), until all of the available calcium hydroxide is dissolved, and all available calcium ions have been converted into calcium carbonate.<br>
The carbonation reaction is accompanied by the evolution of heat (i.e, it is an exothermic reaction). The pH of the lime slurry decreases during the course of the reaction of a batch of lime with carbon dioxide, and such pH changes from approximately 12.4 to the equilibrium pH of 8, plus or minus about 1 pH unit. However in my process the endpoint of the carbonation reaction is indicated when the pH reaches 7, +/- 0.5 pH units. The reaction rate of the carbonation step is effected by (a) the concentration of soluble calcium ion, which is controlled by the rate of dissolution of calcium hydroxide, and (b) rate of carbon dioxide dissolution or mass transfer into water to form an available carbonate ion.<br>
It is important to note, for purposes of my invention, that the rate of dissolution of Ca(OH)2 is a function of the temperature and of the pressure at which the dissolution takes place.  This is important since the controlling reaction in the overall calcium carbonate production process is the dissolution of the available calcium hydroxide, which is only sparingly soluble in aqueous solution, and which is inversely dependent upon temperature in aqueous solution.<br>
The conventional industrial process for production of precipitated calcium carbonate is performed by providing a slurry of approximately 200g/L of calcium hydroxide in an atmospheric reactor, and bubbling a gas stream containing carbon dioxide at about 15-20% by volume into the reactor. In commercially employed PCC production processes, reaction rates in the range of from about 0.5 grams per liter of slurry per minute to about 1.5 grams per liter of slurry per minute are commonly seen.Thus, in prior art PCC production processes, the time required to complete the reaction in the carbonation reactor is approximately 200minutes. That relatively slow overall reaction rate results in a requirement for large carbonation reactors (reactors in the 18,000 to 20,000 gallon range are common), with the associated high capital costs.<br>
The following ionic reactions describe the overall PCC production process:<br>
Ca(OH)2 slurry   →       Ca(OH)2 (aq)	(4)	(SLOW)<br>
Ca(OH)2(aq)        →.   Ca~ + 20H(aq)	(5)         (FAST)<br>
Ca(OH)2 slurry     →Ca++2OH'	(6)         (SLOW)	Keq = 6.46x lO"4<br>
C02(g) + H20    →    H2C03	(7)         (FAST)	Keq 0.035<br>
H2CO3 (aq) + OH' →H2O + HCO3 (aq)	(8)         (SLOW)	Keq = 4.5 x 10'7<br>
HCO3(aq) + OH-→-H2O + CO3 (aq)	(9)         (SLOW)	1eq = 4.7x10"<br>
CO2(g) + H2O    →   2HT + CO3"	(10)       (FAST)<br>
Calcium carbonate is produced by the combination of equations (6) and (10):<br>
Ca~(aq) + CO3-(iiq)       →     CaCO3 (s)	(11)       (FAST)	keq = 2.2x10"<br>
The reactions described by equations (4), (6), (8), and (9) are slow reactions.<br>
Thus the rate controlling reactions could be considered to be reactions (4) and (9).  On<br>
the other hand, the reactions described by the equations (7) and (10) are instantaneous.<br>
In any event, the overall reaction for formation of PCC, based on raw materials supplied<br>
to the process, is as follows:<br>
Ca(OH)2 + CO2     →	CaCO3 + H2O     (12)<br>
Also, the calcium carbonate formed by equations (11 or 12) is also partially<br>
soluble in the presence of weak carbonic acid as follows: CaCO3 + C02 + H20        →   Ca(HCO3)2,         (13)For purposes of my invention, it is important to understand that the equilibrium of the overall reaction (12) is controlled by the following primary process variables:<br>
1)	Reaction Temperature<br>
2)	Concentration of carbon dioxide<br>
3)	Partial pressure of carbon dioxide<br>
4)	Rate of flow of carbon dioxide<br>
5)	Concentration of Ca(OH)2<br>
6)	Solubility of Ca(OH)2<br>
7)	Rate of agitation<br>
8)	Crystalline habit of the calcium carbonate (calcite vs. aragonite)<br>
9)	Chemical additives<br>
Importantly, carrying out the carbonation reaction at a pressure greater than atmospheric increases the solubility of carbon dioxide in aqueous solution, which thus provides a higher concentration of carbonate ions in solution, for reaction with available calcium ions. Also, the elevated pressure is believed to increase the Ca^ formation. Consequently, an overall increase in the rate of the carbonation reaction is experienced, thus leading to an increase in carbonation efficiency, as well as in the production of finer PCC particles.<br>
Turning now to FIGS. 36,37, and 38, process flow schemes for my novel PCC production process are illustrated. Calcium oxide (lime) 54 is normally delivered from a rail car (not shown) via hopper or conveyor or other transport device such as pneumatic tube powered by blower to an incoming lime storage silo 56. A feeder sends stored lime via conveyor to a slaker tank 62 which is stirred by high sheer mixing agitator 64. Slaking water is added to slaker tank 62 via line 66 from mill water storage tank 68. Storage tank 68 can be fed with water and steam to provide a desired water temperature hi storage tank 68. Slaked lime is pumped via pump 69 to screen 70 toremove oversize materials. Grit 72 is captured and sent via screw conveyor 74 to grit bin 75.<br>
The stirred slaked lime slurry is dropped into a mixer 80 stirred surge tank 84 and then pumped 86 via heat exchanger 88 to a storage tank 90 which is stirred by agitator 92. Preferably, the volume of slurry stored in storage tank 90 matches the charge required by carbonation reactor 100 (see FIG. 38), so that once a batch of slurry is sent from tank 90 to carbonation reactor 100, the storage tank 90 can be refilled with another batch of slurry. By matching the size (in terms of throughput) of the slaker 62 to the size (in terms of thruput) of the carbonation reactor 100, equipment can be optimized, and both the slaker 62 and the carbonation reactor 100 can be almost continuously utilized.  When desired to produce the proper crystal habit product, the lime slurry discharged from tank 90 via pump 101 can be cooled via chiller 102, or other convenient heat exchange apparatus or process in order to increase the solubility of calcium in aqueous liquid in the carbonation reactor 100.Any convenient source of carbon dioxide can be utilized in my novel process, ranging from fresh carbon dioxide provided from storage tanks 103, or more commonly, flue gas 104 which is sent to quencher 106 for cooling by a cooling water stream 108. The quenched gases flow via line 110 to compressor 112 which increases the pressure of the gas stream, thus increasing the partial pressure of carbon dioxide supplied to the carbonation reactor 100. The compressed gas stream 114 is sent to a heat exchanger 116 for cooling of the gas stream via water stream 118 which is returned to sewer 120. Alternately, carbon dioxide from tank 103 is heated via steam supply 122 to heat exchanger 124. The conditioned carbon dioxide stream, i.e., at a pre-selected temperature and pressure suitable to assist in producing the desired crystal habit PCC product, is sent via line 130 to the reactor 100. The cooled, compressed gas stream 130 containing carbon dioxide under pressure is sent to the carbonation reactor 100.<br>
The lime slurry at a preselected temperature is sent from storage tank 90 to carbonation reactor 100 via line 132. During the reaction of a batch of slurry in reactor 100, the pH of the liquid in the carbonation reactor 100 is measured by pH probe 134 or by other suitable method or means, until the pH falls and ultimately reaches a desired endpoint that indicates that available calcium has been consumed. During reaction, agitator 136 maintains high shear agitation in reactor 100. Agitator 136 therefore has a high tip speed, ranging from about 260 feet per minute up to about 780 feet per minute, depending upon the design configuration.<br>
The present invention involves carrying out the carbonation reaction between CO2 and Ca(OH)2 under pressure in a carbonation reactor 100 which is a pressure ' vessel. This novel process involves bubbling CO2 into the Ca(OH)2 slurry in reactor 100 where the pressure can range from above atmospheric pressure to as much as about 100 psig. Preferably, the pressure in the reactor 100 is maintained at up to about 30 psig, and more preferably, the pressure in the reactor is maintained in the range from about 15 psig to about 30 psig. Inert gas and any residual carbon dioxide not utilized (such loss is kept to an absolute minimum) in reactor 100 is routed via vent line 138 to the atmosphere.<br>
By carrying out the carbonation reaction under pressure according to this invention, the reaction rate can be increased from the rate of about 1.0 grams of calcium hydroxide per liter of slurry per minute to up to 10 grams of calcium hydroxide per literof slurry per minute. Thus, a production rate increase of as much as 10 fold can be achieved by utilizing my novel process. This dramatic increase in reaction rate, even when employed at moderate pressures or with lower concentrations of carbon dioxide, results in a decrease in carbonation time from the prior art range of 180 to 200 minutes per batch (when conducted at atmospheric pressure conditions) to as low as 30 to 40 minutes per batch (when conducted under pressurized conditions in carbonation reactor 100). Importantly, the carbonation reactor can be sized less than 200 gallons capacity per ton per day of PCC output, and more preferably, less than 100 gallons capacity per ton per day, and most preferably, less than 50 gallons per ton per day of PCC output.<br>
Importantly, in my novel process, key process parameters, such as reaction temperature, carbon dioxide partial pressure, flow rate of carbon dioxide, lime slurry concentration in the carbonation reactor, agitator speed in the carbonation reactor, can be more effectively employed, in order to (a) increase the rate of carbonation reaction, (b) increase the carbonation efficiency, i.e., carbon dioxide utilization, and (c) to produce CaCO3 particles of different morphology, shape, size, and size distribution.<br>
In any event, the precipitated calcium carbonate produced in carbonation reactor 100 is discharged, preferably a PCC batch tank 182 which is stirred by agitator 184. Each PCC batch is then discharged via pump 186 to final screens 188, where any remaining oversize material is removed and sent via chute 190 to conveyor 72 and ultimately to grit bin 74. The produced PCC is received in tank 200. Optionally, line 154 supplies additional selected chemicals from tank 202 to via metering pump 203 to tank 200, to minimize any pH rise and associated loss of product, as well as to provide further product quality attributes as may be desired in a particular on-site situation.<br><br>
Tank 200 is preferably, but need not be, atmospheric.  Finally, the product PCC is stored in tank 202, and mixed with agitator 204, before being sent via pump 206 to the papermill.<br>
The pressure carbonation drives the overall reaction, by improving the CO2 mass transfer (CO3" formation). The higher reaction pressure evidently also increases the solubilization of Ca(OH)2 slurry into calcium ions (Ca++). This results in a higher reaction rate, due to increased calcium ion availability, which in turn reduces the reaction time of calcium carbonate formation.<br>
Since much higher reaction rates are achievable, for the same production rate, my novel PCC manufacturing can be carried out using much smaller equipment and building size than is the case with prior art atmospheric PCC production equipment. Overall, even considering the additional equipment required in my process, such as the gas compressor, an overall lower capital and operating cost is achievable.<br>
Another distinct advantage of this "Pressure Carbonation" invention is that it increases the efficiency of CO2 utilization. Moreover, of industrial significance is the ability to use carbon dioxide in concentrations as low as 5 percent by volume. Because the incoming gas stream is pressurized, and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is increased in the aqueous solution, the pressurized carbonation reaction provides higher concentrations of CO3= ions, since the dissolution of CO2 is proportional to the partial pressure of CO2. Importantly, low grade carbon dioxide containing gases (including those in the 10.0% carbon dioxide by volume range) such as are available from gas fired boilers, can be advantageously employed in on-site PCC production plants.Even when utilizing low concentrations of CO2, utilization of the same may exceed 90%, and more preferably, exceed 95%,and most preferably, exceed 99%.<br>
My novel pressure carbonation process for the production of PCC can also produce a wide variety of crystal habits, including like calcite, rhombohedral, and aragonite in different sizes, shapes, and aspect ratios.<br>
Finally, and most importantly, the PCC provided by the instant invention produces crystals which improve key paper properties, including porosity, density, brightness, and opacity.<br>
My novel process has been thoroughly investigated in experimental laboratory apparatus, in three main steps:<br>
(I)      Slaking<br>
Market quality lime in a quantity from about 50 to about 300 grams (90% CaO), size at Vi" rotary pebble type lime, was added slowly to approximately 1.2 liters of water, under constant stirring. The time taken for slaking was approximately 30 minutes. Due to the exothermic nature of the reaction, the final temperature is elevated over starting conditions. The actual final temperature rise is dependent on the initial water temperature and on the "reactivity" of the lime. In general, the initial temperature of water provided in the process is in the range of 80°F to about 100 °F. The final temperature, after slaking, is normally in the range from about 150°F to about 160°F. In any event, the resulting calcium hydroxide slurry is screened, preferably through a 140 mesh screen.2)       Pressure Carbonation - Lab Reactor Design<br>
Experimentally, the screened Ca(OH)2 slurry is then transferred into a reaction vessel of 1.6L total capacity. The reactor is capable of being heating with outside jacketed heaters. The system can be sealed and operated at super atmospheric pressures (i.e. at pressures greater than atmosphere). The reactor is also fitted with a cooling coil to maintain isothermal temperature, when desired necessary. In the experimental vessel, the agitator impeller used is a Rustin 200. The agitator / impeller is connected to a magnetic, variable speed, drive. The particular vessel is also fitted with a dip or a sample tube. The primary purpose of the dip tube is to obtain samples of Ca(OH)2 / CaCO3 slurry periodically and to follow the conversion of calcium hydroxide to calcium carbonate by measuring pH and /or by titration.   The experimental reactor is also connected to a temperature controller via a transducer<br>
(3)      Pressure Carbonation - Process and Process Variables<br>
Experimentally, the slaked lime slurry was placed in a reactor capable of withstanding pressures greater than 1 atmosphere. The carbon dioxide was supplied from pressure cylinders with a pressure in the range of 0 to about 180 psig. In order to simulate flue gas from lime kilns, the primary source of CO2 containing gasses for commercial onsite PCC plants, nitrogen (N2) from pressure cylinders was also supplied along with the CO2. Each of the gases are passed through a separate mass flow meter. The flow of gases was further verified by a CO2 / water displacement process and /or by actually weighing the mass of CO2 lost from the CO2 cylinder. The reaction conditions were varied to meet the specific requirement of reaction rate, particle size, shape and morphologies. The Ca(OH)2 concentration used ranged from SOgrams per liter of slurry(90% CaO) to a high of about SOOgrams per liter of slurry. The preferred concentration was about 250grams of calcium hydroxide per liter of slurry. Experimentally, the carbonation temperature was varied from 60 °F to 130 °F. In generally, the selected temperature was chosen based on the need to obtain a desired crystal morphology and particle size. For example, sclenohedral PCC was manufactured in the range of 90 °F to 106°F carbonation temperature. The preferred carbonation temperature for rhombohedral PCC was 30 °F to 50 °F.   Finally, the threshold carbonation temperature for an aragonite structure was approximately 120°F.<br>
The carbon dioxide concentration was also varied from a low of 5.0% CO2 / 95% N2 by volume to a high of 100% CO2 / 0% N2 by volume. The preferred CO2 concentration fraction was 20% CO2&gt; with the remainder 80% N2, by volume.<br>
Another important variable is the flow rate of the carbon dioxide through the carbonation reactor. Experimentally, the flow of carbon dioxide was varied from a conventional flow rate of 0.5 L / min to 4.0 L / min. The preferred flow rate was 1.5 liters per minute for the above noted size reactor.<br>
The rate of agitation of the impeller speed is important, in order to maintain high rates of mass transfer of CO2 (gas) into dissolved CO2 (aqueous), i.e, the rate of carbonic acid formation. Experimentally, the agitator speed was varied from 500 rpm to 1500 rpm. The preferred rpm was 1470.<br>
Importantly, operating the carbonation reaction under isothermal conditions resulted in unique PCC products.Experimentally, since the carbonation reaction is an exothermic reaction, the progress of the reaction was accompanied by an observed increase in temperature. The reaction kinetics were determined using temperature to indicate the endpoint of the carbonation reaction. As the conversion of Ca(OH)2 into CaCO3 was completed, the temperature reached a maximum, and then dropped. A temperature probe controller connected to the reaction vessel was used to follow the rise and fall of the reaction temperature. The temperature profile was used to indicate the reaction end point. The chemical analysis of the final product, and pH, confirmed the finding of the carbonation reaction end point. If the pH drifts higher, then the carbon dioxide can be applied sequentially until stable pH is achieved.<br>
Experimentally, the calcium carbonate formed under the novel pressure carbonation technique was filtered through a Whatman #212 filter paper using a vacuum pump, and was washed to remove impurities. One portion of the sample was dried, and the other portion was reslurried for end use in performance testing via preparation of paper handsheets.<br>
Specific examples which set forth novel process parameters, or products, include the following examples:<br>
Example 1 - The Effect of Pressure in a Pressure Carbonation System on Reaction Rate. Carbonation Efficiency, and Surface Area<br>
In a series of experiments, the carbonation reaction pressure was raised from 0 psig (as done with a conventional open tank PCC system) to 70 psig. The reaction temperature was kept constant at 100°F and the % CO2 was kept constant at 20% CO2 / 80% N2 by volume. The resulting experimental data is given in Table IB. Theresulting reaction rate at 0 psig was 4.6 grams per liter of slurry per minute. In the pressure carbpnation system operating at 70 psig, it was 6.1 grams per liter per minute. The increase in reaction rate was approximately 33%. The carbonation efficiency, i.e., carbon dioxide utilization, increased from 76% to 100%. The surface area (Blaine) of the PCC produced by the process increased from 31,400 cnWgram at 0 psig, to a maximum of 40,200 cm2/g at 50 psig, and then decreased slightly to 35,500 cm2/g at 70 psig. See Figures 1,2, and 3.<br>
Table 1A:      Effect of Pressure on Reaction Rate, Carbonation Efficiency, and Surface Area<br><br>
(Table Removed)Effect of Carbonation Reaction Temperature on Kev Paper Properties<br>
The PCC batches prepared in Example 1 were then used to prepare paper handsheets. Some of the key paper properties, including sheet density, sheet porosity, sheet brightness, and sheet opacity, were then measured in each of the handsheets which were formed. The data from tests on handsheets is provided in Table IB below. A graphical representation of the data is also provided in Figures 4 through 9 below. It is important to note some of the key characteristics of paper made from PCC under different carbonation pressures. The sheet density of paper handsheets containing PCCproduced under increasing pressure is shown in Figure 4. The sheet porosity of paper handsheets containing PCC produced under increasing pressure is shown in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 6, the sheet brightness of paper handsheets containing PCC produced under pressure decreased as pressures increased up to about 30 psig. Thereafter, the sheet brightness increases as the reaction pressure was increased from 30 psig to 70 psig. As shown in Figure 7, the sheet opacity of paper handsheets increased as the pressure of the carbonation reaction producing the PCC increased. Also, as indicated in Figure 8, the scattering coefficient of handsheets produced using PCC manufactured underpressure carbonation proved higher than the scattering coefficient of PCC produced at 0 psig as in a conventional, open system.<br>
Table IB: Effect of Carbonation Reaction Pressure on Key Paper Properties<br><br>
(Table Removed)Example 2 - The Effect of Temperature in a "Pressure Carbonation" System As in example 1, the slaked lime was placed into a reactor at a slurry concentration of 250 grams of calcium hydroxide grams per liter. The starting carbonation temperature was varied from 65°F to 125°F. A first set of reactions was carried out under conventional atmospheric pressure or open PCC type system conditions at 0 psig. The next set of reactions was carried out under a pressure of 30 psig. A gas mixture of 20% carbon dioxide and 80% nitrogen by volume was bubbled<br>
through the reactor. The flow of carbon dioxide was at the rate of 1.5 liters per minute. The reaction rate was calculated by titrating Ca(OH)2 at the beginning and end of the reaction. As the reaction proceeded, the reaction temperature increased, with the temperature starting at 38 °C and ending at 73 °C. The end of the reaction was indicated when the temperature reached a maximum and then declined. The point of inflection in the temperature curve was taken as the completion point of the carbonation reaction.<br>
The carbonation reaction conditions and the experimental data resulting is shown in Table 2A and in Table 2B. The reaction rates at varying temperature, for a prior art atmospheric system (0 psig) are shown in Figure 9. The corresponding reaction rates for my "pressurized carbonation" system operating at 30 psig are also shown in Figure 9. The graphs indicate that in the pressurized carbonation process, the reaction rates steadily increased as a function of temperature.  On the other hand, the data indicated that the reaction rate as a function of temperature in an open system (at Opsig) gradually as temperature was raised, from approximately 4.4 grams per liter per minute to 5.0 grams per liter per minute until the temperature reached about 100°F. However, Figure 9 shows that as the temperature was increased beyond 100°F, the rate of reaction decreased to 4.4 grams per liter per minute.<br>
As indicated in Figure 10, similar results were observed with respect to carbon dioxide utilization efficiency. The carbon dioxide utilization efficiency in my pressurized system increased significantly as the temperature was increased from about 60°F to about 120°F.   As can be seen in Figure 10, with carbonation occurring at 30 psig, the carbon dioxide utilization efficiencies were in the range from slightly above80% to about 100%.   In an atmospheric system (operating at 0 psig) the carbonation efficiency was lower, ranging from about 74% to about 84%.<br>
Overall, a pressurized carbonation system provided a higher reaction rate throughout the whole range of operating temperature. The surface areas of the produced PCC, as measured by Elaine for both the pressurized and non-pressurized systems at different temperatures, is provided in Figure 11. In both the pressurized system and in the atmospheric system cases, the surface area of the product decreased as the reaction temperature was increased. The surface area of calcium carbonate decreased from approximately 44,000 cmVg to a coarse PCC of 22,000 cm2/g.   Importantly, the controllability of surface area via temperature was more linear under pressurized carbonation conditions, at least at the 30 psig condition which was tested.<br>

Carbonation Efficiency, and Surface Area<br>
In this series of experiments, the concentration of CO2 was varied from 5.0% COC / 95% N2 to 100% COj / 0% N^, by volume. Other reaction conditions were kept constant at the following levels:<br>
Flow of CO2:	1.5 liters per minute<br>
Carbonation Reaction Temp.:	100 °F<br>
Ca(OH)2 Concentration:	-260 grams per liter<br>
The results of the measurements of the reaction rate, carbonation efficiency, and PCC surface area are given in Table 3A and 3B. The results are also graphed in Figures 17, 18, and 19.<br>
It is evident from Figure 17 that when the entering gas stream contains only 5.0% CO2, the reaction rate is almost doubled by using my "pressure carbonation" PCC production process with pressure carbonation at 30 psig.  As indicated in Figure 19, the surface area comparison between batch #140 and batch #149 also indicates the formation of a finer PCC particle size using the "pressure carbonation" technique.Also, as the concentration of carbon dioxide increased, the reaction rates increased.  Similarly, the carbonation efficiency increased with increasing CO2 concentration. The particle surface area also increased with CO2 concentration indicating formation of finer PCC particles (42,OOOcmVg). The reaction rate under the pressurized system was much higher than with the reaction carried out at atmospheric pressure. See Figures 17,18, and 19.<br>

(Table Removed)Effect of % C(h on Kev Paper Properties<br>
The PCC produced under pressure carbonation conditions at different carbon dioxide concentrations was used to make paper handsheets. The quality data of key paper properties is set forth in Tables 3C, for handsheets made with PCC manufactured under pressure carbonation conditions, and in Table 3D, for handsheets made with PCC manufactured under atmospheric conditions. The graphical representations of the data are shown in Figures 20 through 24. The key characteristics of the paper handsheets as a function of carbon dioxide concentration are given below. In Figure 20, in paper produced using PCC manufactured under pressure carbonation conditions, the sheet density is shown to increase with increasing carbon dioxide concentration. In Figure 21, in paper produced using PCC manufactured under pressure carbonation conditions, the Gurley sheet porosity increased over paper produced using PCC manufactured under atmospheric conditions. In other words, the higher Gurley sheet porosity seen in handsheets made from PCC manufactured under pressure carbonation conditions means that tighter sheets were made possible by utilizing PCC manufactured under pressure.<br>
Turning now to Figure 22, it is important to note that the sheet brightness of handsheets produced from PCC made under pressure was higher than the brightness of handsheets made from PCC produced under atmospheric systems. However, in both cases, an increase the % CO 2 up to about 60% or more resulted in lower sheet brightness.<br>
In Figure 23, it is also seen that except at low carbon dioxide concentrations, where the sheet opacity was comparable, the sheet opacity of handsheets produced fromPCC made under pressure was higher than the opacity of handsheets up through about 60% pressure carbonation.<br>
With respect to scattering coefficient, as seen in Figure 24, handsheets produced with PCC manufactured under pressure carbonation conditions had higher values for the scattering of light.<br>

Carbonation Efficiency .and Surface Area of PCC<br>
In this example, the concentration of calcium hydroxide was varied from a low of 35 grams per liter to a high of 308 grams per liter, measured as calcium carbonate (24 grams per liter of calcium hydroxide to about 228 grams per liter calcium hydroxide, as ion).The constant reaction conditions were as follows:<br>
CO2 Flow:	1.5 liters per minute<br>
CO2 Concentration:     20%<br>
Carbonation Temp.:    100°F<br>
Reaction Pressure:      30 psig<br>
The experimental data for variation of calcium hydroxide slurry concentration in a pressure carbonation reactor is shown in Table 4. The reaction rate response, as calcium hydroxide concentration is varied, is given in Figure 25.<br>
The carbonation efficiency and surface area of the PCC are given in Figures 26 and 27, respectively. As shown in Figure 25, the reaction rate response was curvilinear, an inverse parabola. The carbonation efficiency followed a similar trend.  However, as the calcium hydroxide concentration increased, the particle surface area of the PCC manufactured underpressure carbonation conditions decreased steadily from about 55,000 cm2/g to about 30,000 cm2/g, as the calcium hydroxide concentrations increased from about 25 to about 308 grams per liter of lime slurry, expressed as calcium carbonate.   Figures 25 and 26 indicate that the initial reaction rates and carbon dioxide efficiency, respectively, were higher at lower calcium hydroxide concentrations. The reaction rate and the carbon dioxide utilization efficiency decreased as the concentration of Ca(OH)2 increased to about 125 grams per liter of calcium hydroxide. However, beyond 150 grams per liter, the reaction rate and the carbon dioxide utilization efficiency increased, reaching a.maximum at, or slightly less than, about -300 grams per liter of Ca(OH)2.<br>

Carbonation Temperature:      100°F<br>
Ca(OH)2 Concentration:         -250 gpl<br>

The reaction rate was measured by titration of the lime slurry at regular intervals. The experimental data is given in Table 5. As indicated in Figure 28, with increased agitation, the reaction rate of carbonation increased three fold from about 2.0 grams per liter per minute of calcium hydroxide consumption to about 6.0 grams per liter per minute of calcium hydroxide consumption.

The pressure in the reaction vessel during pressure carbonation was maintained at 30 psig. The PCC manufactured under such pressurized carbonation conditions had the following characteristics:<br>
Particle Surface Area =        21,500 cmVgram (Elaine method)<br>

Generally, it should also be noted that the pressure carbonation for production of PCC process as described herein can be used with any convenient source of carbon dioxide, since the pressurization of the reactor advantageously increases the partial pressure of carbon dioxide to an extent that it can be economically exploited. It is to be appreciated that my process for the production of precipitated calcium carbonate is an appreciable improvement in the state of the art for on-site production of calciumcarbonate. My novel process treats the manufacture of calcium carbonate in a manufacturing environment from a new perspective, to provide significantly improved production rates.<br>
In my improved manufacturing process, control of the pH, temperature, and time of reaction is determined by the nature of the progress of the reaction in a particular batch.   Importantly, the process is readily automated and can be put into an automated process control environment. Although only a few exemplary embodiments of this invention have been described in detail, it will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that my pressurized production process for manufacture of calcium carbonate, and the apparatus for implementing the process, may be modified from those embodiments provided herein, without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages provided.<br>
