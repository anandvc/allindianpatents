COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	The field of the invention<br>
The present invention generally relates to a spark plug and more specifically, the invention relates to a modification and improvement of electrodes of an existing nickel alloy spark plug.<br>
2.	The Relevant Technology<br>
A spark plug is used in internal combustion engines to generate a spark at sequential intervals. The sparks ignite an air-fuel mixture within a cylinder of an engine to create a contained explosion. A high voltage is applied to a center electrode of the spark plug. When the voltage jumps across a narrow gap between the center electrode and a ground electrode a spark is created.<br>
Spark plugs are generally designed with a central electrode, an insulator and a ground electrode. Typically, the central electrode is a solid cylindrical pin that extends axially through the spark plug from one end to the other. The insulator surrounds the central electrode to insulate it from the ground electrode. One end of the spark plug includes an exposed portion of the central electrode to allow a wire carrying a current to be attached to the spark plug. The other end also includes an exposed portion of the central electrode and usually an L-shaped attachment attached to the ground electrode. The L-shaped attachment is positioned so that it is directed towards the central electrode. A gap must exist between the L-shaped attachment and the central electrode so as to create a spark when current flows from the central electrode to the ground electrode. The gap must be adjusted accurately to provide the required spark to efficiently ignite the air-fuel mixture within the cylinder.<br>
A portion of the spark plug is threaded for attaching it to an engine head directly above a cylinder. The threaded portion provides a tight fit between the engine head and the spark plug. When the spark plug is inserted into the engine head, a portion of the spark plug designed to create a spark is projected into the cylinder. The other end of the spark plug is electrically connected to a power source.<br>
When in operation, an electrical charge is applied to the central electrode, which travels through the central electrode to the opposite end. The electrical charge must be sufficiently large to 'jump' between the gap of the central and ground electrodes and create a spark at the precise moment. A piston moves in cycles within the cylinder. When the piston is in its latter portion of a compression cycle, the spark is created to ignite the pressurized air-fuel, which in turn repels the piston to produce mechanical energy.<br><br>
In the existing spark plug the spark ignite the air-fuel mixture in split form and hence the mixture couldn't burn completely/evenly and the hardness of the central and ground electrodes couldn't produce the electron property to create rich spark at low voltage and also the pickup of the vehicle will loss while driving in the top gear and then when we are driving in the top gear at slow speed the vehicle will jerk to and fro, and the emission of CO, HC, NOx are not completely minimize to the best level in four stroke petrol engine and mostly in two stroke petrol engine and improper scavenging occur in two stroke engine makes power loss.<br>
The main drawbacks is the method of firing, strength of sparking, scavenging of burned gases, igniting of air-fuel mixture and burning property reduce the exact output power of the engine.<br>
In the view of the above and other related drawbacks in the existing spark plug design, there is a need for a spark plug design that has a high efficiency and maintenance free, such that we have invented two designs of spark plug models one is for two stroke petrol engine another one is for four stroke petrol engine. In two stroke model plug we have introduced two ground electrodes and in four stroke model plug we have introduced one ground electrode in the both model we have made some modification in the ground electrode design and technically improved the characteristic of the centre and ground electrode.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
To further clarify the above and other advantages and features of the present invention, a more particular description of the invention will be rendered by reference to specific embodiments thereof which are illustrated in the appended drawings, it is appreciated that these drawings depict only typical embodiments of the invention and are therefore not be considered limiting of its scope. The invention will be described and explained with additional specify and detail through the use of the accompanying drawing in which:<br>
FIG. 1 is a front view of an embodiment of a spark plug for two stroke petrol engine<br>
in accordance with the present invention;<br>
FIG. 1- (a) is an enlarged front view of firing end of an embodiment of a spark plug<br>

•DETAILED DISCRIPTION OF THE PREFERED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the gap between the center and ground electrode are pre-set, i.e., formed to have a particular gap width.<br>
In typical spark plug, the ground electrode is L-shaped. This L-shaped ground electrode must be measured and adjusted to provide a proper gap width. This gap width is difficult to adjust within a tight tolerance. Also, if the L-shaped ground electrode is slightly bumped, such as when installing or setting the spark plug down, the gap can be compromised.<br>
The present embodiment of the invention provides a gap that is not easily compromised. Also, our design will provide a direct path for the flow of the fuel to reach the area where the spark occurs. In the L-shaped ground, however, the structure shields a portion of the spark from the fuel. The direct path improves fuel usage and emissions because it allows the air-fuel mixture to have a more complete burn. The air-fuel mixture is not blocked from any structure in the electrode to initiate combustion.<br>
In addition, the present embodiment of the invention provides a ground electrode with multiple firing points (only two firing point) for two stroke engine for better combustion because in the existing engine design air-fuel mixture is directly mixed with the lubricant oil hence the spark heat is not sufficient to get the proper combustion, the multiple firing point create mega limit of the spark heat in two stroke engine and provides a ground electrode with single firing points (only one firing point) for four stroke engine.<br>
In conventional L-shaped electrode designs, the spark is emitted from the centre electrode to the bent portion of the L-shaped electrode, which is a small surface area. When the ground electrode becomes worn or fouled, for example, by oil deposits, ash deposits, or glazing, the surface area for emitting a spark becomes drastically reduced. The surface area of the electrodes that are excessively worn or fouled can prevent or weaken a spark being emitted.<br>
In the present invention, the spark is emitted from the centre electrode to the ground electrode is tangential form(arc of contact method), there by providing strong spark beam and resulting in a more reliable and longer lasting spark plug, (According to the liquid drop model of Neil's bhor concept).<br>
The specific dimension of the plug gap (between H and N nodes) depends on the application in which the spark plug is used. The spark occurs when the voltage jumps or arcs from the centre electrode to the outer electrode when the outer electrode is provided as a ground electrode.<br><br>
If the voltage flow is reversed, the spark would occur when the voltage jumps or arcs from the outer electrode to the center electrode. The dimension of the plug gap affects the electrical energy potential that exists across the plug gap results in a less powerful spark. If the gap is not sized properly, optimum combustion can not be achieved and localized build-up of heat may occur that accelerates erosion of the firing tip. When the gap is too large for a given engine requirement, the voltage required to cause the spark to arc across the gap becomes impractical. (Note; as a rule of thumb, the more spark gap is exposed to the air/fuel mixture, the easier to initiate combustion. Better combustion equates to more horsepower, improved throttle response and higher fuel economy).<br>
In the existing spark plug the spark ignite the air-fuel mixture in split form and hence the mixture couldn't burn completely and the hardness of the central and ground electrodes couldn't produce the electron property to create rich spark at low voltage and also the pickup of the vehicle will loss while driving in the top gear and then when we are driving in the top gear at slow speed the vehicle will jerk to and fro, and the emission of CO, HC, NOx are not completely minimize to the best level mostly in two stroke petrol engine and improper scavenging occur in two stroke engine makes power loss.<br>
The main drawbacks involved in the conventional speak plug is the method of ignition, weak strength of spark flame, time taken to exhaust the burnt gases will be more, and uneven burning property would be reduced the output power of the engine performance.<br>
In the view of the above and other related drawbacks in the existing spark plug design, there is a necessity for a new spark plug design that has to a give high efficiency and maintenance free and perform better pollution control, such that we have invented two designs of spark plug models according to the strokes of the engine, one is for two stroke petrol engine and another one is for four stroke petrol engine. For two stroke engine we have introduced two ground electrodes which were arranged circumferentially opposite to each other and for four stroke engine we have introduced one ground electrode with modified shape.<br>
In the both stoke of engine, our designed spark plug ground electrodes having some modification in their shape and metallurgically improved characteristics were applied for the both centre and ground electrodes. Our invention has to rectify all the above drawbacks and give more output power and also protect the environment from pollution in miracle manner.<br>
•    Conventional plug firing method;<br>
The method of firing the air- fuel mixture inside the combustion chamber is in split form (flame will be splitter) due to this the air- fuel mixture couldn't burnt completely/evenly and also not occupy all molecules, this leads to power loss and environment pollution.<br><br>
Present invention of our plug firing method(swirl technology);<br>
The method of firing the air- fuel mixture inside the combustion chamber is in swirl form. Because the flame coming out from the central electrode is like swirl this is been performed by our metallurgical treatment of both central and ground electrodes. In central electrode we have changed the micro structure of electrode material only the portion which projected out from the nose of ceramic end. Such that when the electron coming out from the central electrode is like swirl form. Reason for changing the microstructure is to change the path of electron into swirl instead of straight flow.<br>
In our invention the spark nucleus never splitter hence the spark nucleus ignite and impacts the air- fuel mixture in swirl movement.<br>
By our invention method of firing will burn the air- fuel mixture completely as well as evenly. So we can get more output power and prevent the environment from pollution by getting proper combustion.<br>
•	Conventional plug sparking strength;<br>
The main drawbacks are;<br>
1.	The high quenching (the contact area between the electrode and the flame<br>
nucleus is more)<br>
2.	The ground electrode blocks a portion of the air-fuel mixture from exposure<br>
to the spark,<br>
From the above reason the sparking property will weak<br>
•	Present invention of our plug sparking strength;<br>
1.	The contact area between the electrode and the fame nucleus is minimized by our special modification of ground electrode design (arc of contact i.e. tangential method) this will reduce the quenching.<br>
2.	The ground electrode did not block the air-fuel mixture from exposure to the spark. (Not shadowing)<br>
From the above reason our invention increases the sparking strength of the spark plug.<br>
•	Conventional plug scavenging property;<br>
1.	The split method of firing reduce the proper combustion therefore the density of burned gases is uneven (velocity of the entire burned gases particle are not same at the time of exhaust) and it takes more time to exhaust completely from the combustion chamber itself.<br>
2.	Especially in two stroke petrol engine due to the improper scavenging some times the intake of air-fuel mixture will escape along with the exhaust smoke this will reduce the efficiency of the engine and affect the environment.<br>
•	Present invention ofo ur plug scavenging property;<br>
1. The cyclone method (swirl) of firing make the proper combustion therefore the density of burned gases is even (velocity of the entire burned gases particle are same at the time of exhaust) and it takes less time to exhaust completely from the combustion chamber itself.<br><br>
'2.' Especially in two stroke petrol engine our invention make proper and quick scavenging, so that the intake of air-fuel mixture will not escape along with the exhaust smoke this will increase the efficiency of the engine and protect the environment from pollution and in four stroke petrol engine our invention make best scavenging and control the pollution at the best level.<br>
•	Conventional plug igniting property;<br>
The igniting property is not good because the sparking strength is not enough to ignite the air-fuel mixture at high engine speed level( i.e.) the required voltage to create at the spark gap is more than the available voltage.<br>
•	Present invention of our plug igniting property;<br>
The igniting property of our invention plug is better than that of the conventional model plug. The sparking strength is more enough to ignite the air-fuel mixture at maximum engine speed level (i.e.) the required voltage to create at the spark gap is less than the available voltage.<br>
•	Conventional plug burning property;<br>
The firing method, igniting and sparking property are not satisfied to getting better burning property, it will cause improper combustion.<br>
•	Present invention of our plug burning property;<br>
The firing method, igniting and sparking property are satisfy to getting better burning property, it will cause proper combustion<br>
•	Conventional plug electrodes property;<br>
In which the crystalline nature of the material structure is not having the property of growth of electron and there is chance for stress developing while welding the ground electrode and drawing of electrode materials.<br>
•	Present invention of our plug electrodes property;<br>
By using quench tempering process the central electrode tip and ground electrodes are heat treated this is done for restructuring the crystalline nature of the electrode material and to relieve the stress, so that the growth of the electron in the electrode material is increased at the time of spark event. (Sparking, generation, growth and firing properties are increased in the electrodes by quench tempering)<br>
Advantages for our present invention are;<br>
1.	Better idling property<br>
2.	Better acceleration property<br>
3.	Having good wearing property<br>
4.	Good heat dissipating property It creates cyclone (whirl method) method of firing inside the combustion chamber<br>
5.	Its having good burning property<br>
6.	Its having good igniting property<br>
7.	Its help for proper scavenging<br>
8.	Its having better sparking property<br>
9.	By getting all the above properties we can save the fuel energy and utilize it to get 10 to 20% more efficiency.<br><br>
TESTING RESULTS:<br>
1.	IDLING PROPERTY;<br>
Test results by a 2 and 4 -cycle (two wheeler) single cylinder engine.<br>
After warming the engine the fluctuations in engine revolution were measured. Firstly a nickel alloy (existing spark plug) spark plug was installed and the average revolution set at 650 r/min. Fluctuation were observed during a 40 second interval, next our modified and improved of existing spark plug was installed and the engine checked again, merely by replacing the spark plug we were able to achieve an increase in average revolution of 10 to 20% r/min.<br>
2.	IMPROVED FUEL EFFICIENCY;<br>
In the above idling test, an increase in the number of revolution was seen when our designed spark plug was used.<br>
Therefore, we tested the fuel consumption in 2 stroke and 4 stroke two wheeler vehicle by how much kilometer can we obtained while we were using llittre of petrol under 130 kg load at the speed range of 40 to 45 kmph.(tested on the highways road). We get 10 to 20% more mileage<br>
3.	STARTING IN COLD TEMPERATURE;<br>
Tested at -23 degree Celsius, in the test the kicker was kicked down and rest and the number of times this was done until the engine started was counted.<br>
As opposed to the engine in which the existing Nickel alloy spark plug was used, this took three cycles to start up, the engine in which our invention spark plug was used started immediately with only one try. Thus we found that our invention of modified spark plug was effective even under cold start-up conditions.<br>
4.	ACCELERATION;<br>
We tested the distance covered by a two stroke and four stroke motorcycles under full acceleration after 30 seconds is 783 meter and the time taken to reach lOOkm/h under full acceleration is 10.9seconds. Thus the modified and improved invention of our spark plug was better sparking with less hesitation. This meant improvement in smooth revolution and an increase in speed over a short time and an increase in the distance covered.<br><br>
