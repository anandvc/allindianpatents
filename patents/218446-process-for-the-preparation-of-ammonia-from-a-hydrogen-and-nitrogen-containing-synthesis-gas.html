				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to certain improvements in the preparation of ammonia from a hydrogen and nitrogen containing ammonia synthesis gas.<br>
More particular, this invention concerns synthesis of ammonia at high production capacity in at least two ammonia synthesis reactors arranged in parallel synthesis loops with one combined compression step of synthesis recycle gas <br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Synthesis of ammonia is conventionally performed by passing a process stream of synthesis gas containing nitrogen and hydrogen in essentially stoichiometric amounts to the formation of ammonia through a catalyst arranged in one or more beds in a reactor.<br>
Thermodynamically, the reaction of hydrogen and nitrogen to ammonia requires the reaction to be performed at elevated temperature and pressure, usually above 10 0 atm and at temperatures between 3 00°C and 600°C. At the above process conditions, the equilibrium concentration of ammonia in a stoichiometric synthesis gas composition is below 20% by volume in the synthesis gas stream from the reactor and the stream has to be recycled to the reactor together with fresh synthesis gas in order to provide reasonably product yield of ammonia. Prior to recycling, the stream is cooled to separate ammonia from unreacted hydrogen, nitrogen and inert diluents present in the synthesis gas and a fraction of the recycle gas is purged to vent inerts. The stripped gas is then passed to a compression stage by which it is recycled to the reaction.<br>
Expenses for compressing and recycling synthesis gas are an important factor in the economy of ammonia<br><br>
production in general and in particular when production capacity of existing ammonia synthesis loops have to be increased.<br>
It is, therefore, the general object of this invention to provide improvements in the  by utilizing one combined compression step   the recirculation of synthesis gas from at least two ammonia loops.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
This invention is a process for the preparation of ammonia from a hydrogen and nitrogen-containing synthesis gas comprising steps of<br>
(a)	admixing to the synthesis gas recycle gas from an ammonia separation step (f) and (g);<br>
(b)	pressurizing the admixed gas from step (a);<br>
(c)	dividing the gas from step (b) into a first make up gas stream and a second make up gas stream;<br>
(d)	introducing the first make up gas stream into a first ammonia reactor and withdrawing a first process stream being rich in ammonia;<br><br>
(e)	introducing the second ammonia make up gas stream into a second ammonia reactor and withdrawing a second process stream being rich in ammonia;<br>
(f)	separating ammonia from the first process stream and recycling the remainder of the process stream to step<br>
(a) ;<br><br>
(g) separating ammonia from the second process stream and recycling the remainder of the process stream to step (a) ;<br>
"   (h)    combining separated ammonia from step (f) and step (g) and withdrawing an ammonia product stream.<br>
The above process may comprise one or more of the further steps of<br>
prior to step (a) pressurizing the ammonia synthesis gas;<br>
purifying the pressurized ammonia synthesis gas by removing water and carbon dioxide; and<br>
further pressurizing the purified ammonia synthesis gas.<br>
As mentioned hereinbefore, the invention is particularly useful when increased production capacity of an existing ammonia loop is required. When revamping the existing loop an additional ammonia synthesis loop, is connected in parallel to the existing loop. As an advantage of the invention the existing synthesis gas recirculation compressor, optionally after modification, recycles both recycle synthesis gas flows from the existing loop and the connected additional loop. Thereby, only two tie-ins will be required in the synthesis loop, upstream and downstream the recirculation compressor.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Reference is made to the drawings, in which the sole Figure represents a simplified flow scheme of the inventive process. Ammonia synthesis gas 2 is compressed in a first stage of synthesis gas compression 4 to 940 psig.<br><br>
The compressed gas is passed a molecular sieve unit 6 for<br>
removal of HjO and CO2. Dried and purified synthesis gas 8<br>
is then passed to a second stage of synthesis gas compres<br>
sion 10 where it is compressed first to 1967 psig, and then<br>
mixed with recycle gas 2 0 provided by combining recycle gas<br>
22 from a second separator 32 and recycle gas 24 from a<br>
first separator 26. Recycle gas 22 and 24 are heated in one<br>
or more heat exchangers (not shown) before their combina<br>
talon. The mixture of synthesis gas and combined recycle gas<br>
is further compressed to 2122 psig in a third compression  .<br>
stage ll.r88.1%)of the synthesis gas 12 leaving synthesis<br>
gas compression stage 11 is passed in stream 14 to a hot<br>
gas heat exchanger (not shown) and to a first ammonia syn<br>
thesis reactor 16 being indirect cooled and adapted to<br>
radial gas flow as described in US Patent No. 4,181,701.<br>
Effluent gas 18 from reactor 16 is cooled in a conventional<br>
heat exchanger train (not shown), and 1591 STPD of liquid<br>
ammonia is separated in separator 26 from the gas, before<br>
separated unconverted gas 24 is mixed with unconverted gas<br>
in stream 22 .	<br>
The remaining(11.9%jof the synthesis gas leaving synthesis gas compressiorT"stage 11 is passed in stream 3 0 to a second indirect cooled radial flow ammonia synthesis reactor 28. Effluent gas 29 from reactor 28 is cooled in a series of heat exchangers (not shown) and 218 STPD of liquid ammonia is separated in separator 32 from the gas. Unconverted gas leaving separator 32 is separated into a small purge gas stream 34 and the remaining unconverted gas stream 22. Gas stream 22 is mixed with unconverted synthesis gas from separator 26 and passed on to the recycle part of synthesis gas compression 11, as described above. Alternatively, purge gas stream 34 may be taken from stream 24 as shown by the dotted line in the Figure.<br><br>
A part of hydrogen contained in purge gas stream 34 is recovered in a conventional hydrogen recovery unit 3 6 and recycled in stream 3 8 to synthesis gas stream 8. Liquid ammonia product 39 from separator 26 is combined with liquid ammonia product 40 from separator 32 and withdrawn in product stream 42. Recycle stream 38 from hydrogen recovery unit 3 6 alternatively may be recycled to stream 2, or alternatively (in the case of a two stage recovery unit), it may be recycled to stream 8 and stream 2 as shown by the dotted line in the Figure.<br>
Composition of the streams described above is summarized in the Table below.<br><br><br><br><br>
