Polymerization of olefins<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the copolymerization of ethylene or propylene with one another or with other olefinically unsaturated compounds.<br>
The present invention further provides a process of this type which is carried out at from 20 to 300°C and pressures of from 5 to 4 000 bar, provides for the use of a complex of a transition metal with one or two substituted or unsubstituted 1,3,5-triazacyclohexane ligands or corresponding ligands in which one or more ring nitrogens are replaced by phosphorus or arsenic atoms in the copolymerization of ethylene or propylene with one another or with other olefinically unsaturated compounds and also provides transition metal complexes with specifically substituted triazacyclohexane ligands.<br>
Single site catalysts are gaining increasing importance in the polymerization of olefins. These catalyst systems lead to polymers having narrow molecular weight distributions, which results in particularly favorable mechanical properties. Among these single site catalysts, metallocene catalysts have achieved particular industrial importance. However, many metallocene catalysts can be obtained only by means of multistage syntheses and therefore represent a significant cost factor in olefin polymerization.<br>
Triazacyclohexane and its derivatives, which differ in having different substitution patterns, have been known for a long time and are used in a variety of ways in industry since they can be prepared in a simple and inexpensive manner from simple starting materials. Thus, for example, triazacyclohexane derivatives are used in the desulfurization of kerosene. However, the use of triazacyclohexane and its derivatives as ligands in the preparation of organometallic complexes is not widespread. Only isolated reports of complexes with these ligands have appeared in the organometallic literature, for example in N.L. Armanasco, M.V. Baker, M.R. North, B.W. Skelton, A.H. White, J.Chem. Soc., Dalton Trans. (1997), 1363-1368; H. Schumann, Z. Naturforsch., part B50 (1995), 1038-1043; R.D. Kohn, et al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 33 (1994), 1877-1878; J. Organomet. Chem. 501 (1995), 303-307; Chem. Ber. 129 (1996), 25-27; J. Organomet. Chem 520 (1996), 121-129; Inorg. Chem. 36 (1997), 6064-6069; Chem. Ber. 129 (1996), 1327-1333. Triazacyclohexane complexes in the<br><br><br>
At the [lacuna] in Dallas, Texas, one of the inventors of the present parent application reported the first experiments on the polymerization of ethylene using an N,N,N-trioctyltriazacyclo-hexane-chromium complex and methylaluminoxane as activator. However, nothing was said about the suitability of the catalyst system for copolymerization; it was merely remarked that contact of the catalyst system with 1-hexene leads selectively to trimerization. [sic]<br>
At the 213th ACS National Meeting, April 13 - April 17, 1997 in San Francisco and the 215th ACS National Meeting, March 29 -April 2, 1998 in Dallas, Texas, one of the inventors of the present patent application reported the first experiments on the polymerization of ethylene using an N,N,N-trioctyltriazacyclo-hexane-chromium complex and methylaluminoxane as activator. However, nothing was said about the suitability of the catalyst system for copolymerization; it was merely remarked that contact of the catalyst system with 1-hexene leads selectively to trimerization.<br>
In JP-A-10 231317, symmetrically substituted triazacyclohexane-chromium complexes, inter alia, are used together with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane and aluminum alkyl for preparing polymers and oligomers in solution or suspension. The polymers obtained often contain relatively large amounts of low molecular weight products and therefore have a broad molecular weight distribution. Nothing was said about the suitability of the catalyst system for copolymerization.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to find a process for the polymerization of olefins, in particular of ethylene or propylene with one another or with other olefinically unsaturated compounds, which is based on a catalyst system which has good polymerization activity and can be prepared in a simple and inexpensive manner from simple starting materials.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by a process for the copolymerization of ethylene or propylene with one another or with other olefinically unsaturated compounds, wherein the polymerization is carried out in the presence of a catalyst system comprising the following components: i<br><br>
A)	a complex of a transition metal with one or two substituted or unsubstituted 1,3,5-triazacyclohexane ligands or corresponding ligands in which one or more of the ring nitrogens are replaced by phosphorus or arsenic atoms, and<br>
B)	if desired, one or more activator compounds.<br>
We have also found the use of such a complex of a transition metal (A) in the copolymerization of ethylene or propylene with one another or with other olefinically unsaturated compounds.<br>
The invention also provides a process for the copolymerization of ethylene or propylene with one another or with other olefinically unsaturated compounds at from 2 0 to 300°C and pressures of from 5 to 4 000 bar, which comprises the following process steps:<br>
a)	bringing a complex of a transition metal with one or two substituted or unsubstituted 1,3,5-triazacyclohexane ligands (A) into contact with at least one activator compound (B)<br>
b)	bringing the reaction product from step (a) into contact with the olefinically unsaturated compounds under polymerization conditions.<br>
5tep b) can be carried out after step a), but also simultaneously vith a).<br>
En one embodiment of the process of the present invention, the :omponent (A) used is a compound of the formula I<br><br>
/here the variables have the following meanings:<br>
1     is a transition metal of groups 4 to 12 of the Periodic Table,<br>
^-R9  are hydrogen or organosilicon or organic substituents having from 1 to 30 carbon atoms, where two geminal or vicinal radicals R1 to R9 may also be joined to form a 5-or 6-membered ring and, when m is 2, a radical R1-R9 of in each case one triazacyclohexane ring together with one of<br><br>
the substituents from the other triazacyclohexane ring may also form a bridge between the two rings,<br>
X      is fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, hydrogen,<br>
Ci-Cio-alkyl, Cg-Cis-aryl or alkylaryl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl part and from 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the aryl part, trifluoroacetate, BF4", PFg- or a bulky noncoordinating anion,<br>
m     is 1 or 2,<br>
n      is a number from 1 to 4 corresponding to the oxidation state of the transition metal M.<br>
Suitable transition metals M are, in particular, the elements of groups 4 to 8 of the Periodic Table and especially the elements of group 6 of the Periodic Table. Particularly useful central atoms in the transition metal complexes used according to the present invention are the elements titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, manganese, iron, rhodium and nickel. Particular preference is given to using transition metal complexes of chromium.<br>
Variation of the substituents on the triazacyclohexane ring system allows various properties of the catalyst system to be influenced. Thus, the catalyst activity can generally be increased by the introduction of substituents, in particular on the nitrogen atoms of the ring system. Furthermore, the ability of the polyolefins to be polymerized to gain access to the central atom can be influenced by means of the number and type of the substituents. This also allows the activity of the catalyst, the selectivity in respect of various monomers, in particular bulky monomers, and the molecular weight of the resulting polymers to be influenced. The chemical structure of the substituents R1 to R9 can therefore be varied within a wide range in order to achieve the desired results and to obtain a tailored catalyst system. Possible organic substituents are, for example, Ci-Cie-alkyI, 5- to 7-membered cycloalkyl which may in turn bear a Ci-Cio-aryl group as substituent, Cg-Cis-aryl or arylalkyl, where, if desired, two geminal or vicinal radicals R1 to R9 may also be joined to form a 5- or 6-membered ring. Possible organosilicon substituents are, in particular, trialkylsilyl groups having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical, in particular trimethylsilyl groups. If the transition metal complex contains only one triazacyclohexane ligand, i.e. m = 1, one of the substituents R1 to R9 can also bear a donor group which is connected via a bridge to the ring system and occupies a<br><br>
coordination position around the metal atom. Possible donor groups of this type are, in particular, nitrogen-containing functions such as dialkylamino groups. If the transition metal complex bears two triazacyclohexane ligands, i.e. m is 2, a radical R: to R9 together with one of the substituents from the other triazacyclohexane ring may also form a bridge between the two rings. Possible bridges are all bridges which are known to a person skilled in the art, for example from similar metallocene complexes, i.e. especially silyl- or carbon-containing bridges. As in the case of the metallocene complexes, bridged complexes having various symmetries (e.g. Cs, C2V) have the advantage that they are suitable for preparing syndiotactic or isotactic polypropylene.<br>
However, triazacyclohexane ligands having simple substitution patterns can also be used advantageously, particularly for preparing polyethylene or for preparing copolymers of ethylene with higher a-olefins. Thus, for example, very good polymerization results can be achieved using transition metal complexes which have only one triazacyclohexane ring which is substituted by simple Ci-C 12-alkyl radicals on the nitrogen atom. Possible alkyl substituents are, in particular, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, hexyl and octyl radicals. In an advantageous embodiment of the process of the present invention, R1, R2 and R3 are therefore Ci-Ci2-alkyl or Ce-Ci5-aryl or arylalkyl. In a further advantageous embodiment of the process, the substituents R4, R5, R6, R7, R8 and R9 are hydrogen or Ci-C4-alkyl. Hydrogen or methyl groups are particularly useful as R4, R5, R6, R7, R8 and R9, since such derivatives can be prepared particularly simply as condensation product of formaldehyde or acetaldehyde with appropriate amines.<br>
Possible substituents X are, in particular, halogens, especially chlorine. Simple alkyl radicals such as methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl are also advantageous ligands X. Further ligands X which may be mentioned purely by way of example and do not constitute an exhaustive listing are trifluoroacetate, BF4-, PFe" and noncoordinating anions such as B(CeF5)4-. The number of ligands X depends on the oxidation state of the transition metal M. The number n can thus not be defined generally, but can assume different values for each particular transition metal. These values, i.e. the oxidation states of the individual transition ■netals in catalytically active complexes, are known to those skilled in the art. Thus, the appropriate complexes of titanium, zirconium and hafnium have, in particular, the oxidation state f4, chromium, molybdenum and tungsten are preferably present in<br><br>
-he oxidation state +3, while iron and nickel are preferably used in the oxidation state +2.<br>
\ particularly large number of variation opportunities for Dreparing tailored catalyst systems are conceivable when the substitution pattern of the complexing ligands is unsymmetrical. ^reference is therefore also given to transition metal complexes )f the formula I in which at least one of the radicals R1, R2 or I3 is different from the other two of these radicals. Such msymmetrically substituted triazocyclohexane complexes or the -igands on which these complexes are based can, for example, be &gt;repared by the following methods:<br>
.)  By reaction of a mixture of two primary amines (R2NH2 and R2NH2) with formaldehyde (aqueous solution or paraformaldehyde), which leads to a mixture of various products which can be separated as follows:<br>
a)	Distillation of the product when R1 and R2 are sufficiently small.<br>
b)	Carrying out the reaction using a large excess of the amine R}NH2, when the symmetrical reaction product can be distilled off- The unsymmetrical product then remains after distillation.<br>
c)	Selective crystallization of one product.<br>
d)	Complexing of the mixture by means of CrCl3 and separation of the complexes by column chromatography.<br>
)  By reaction of an amine RaNH2 with an excess of formaldehyde to give a mixture of symmetrically substituted product and the corresponding l-oxa-3,5-diazacyclohexane. In a second step, the l-oxa-3,5-diazacyclohexane can be reacted under normal conditions with another amine R2NH2 (possibly in the presence of an acid catalyst) so as to replace the oxygen by R2N. The separation of the product mixture can be carried out as under 1):<br><br><br>
3)	By reaction of a symmetrical triazacyclohexane having a small<br>
radical R1 (Me or Et) with another amine R2NH2 at about 130°C.<br>
At this temperature, R1NH2 is given off and a mixture of the<br>
conceivable unsymmetrical triazacyclohexanes is formed. The<br>
separation is carried out as under 1):<br><br>
4)	By reaction of two different symmetrical triazacyclohexanes<br>
with one another. Exchange of substituents can occur in a<br>
slow reaction. The products can be separated as under 1).<br>
Bridged triazacyclohexanes can also be obtained by these methods.<br>
A bridge between two triazacyclohexane ligands makes it possible to obtain chiral complexes which can be used advantageously for the preparation of tactic polypropylene. In addition, the bridge also sets an opening angle on the active center of the catalyst complex by means of which further polymerization properties can be adjusted. Particular preference is therefore also given to transition metal complexes of the formula I in which m is 2 and a radical R1 to R5 of in each case one triazacyclohexane ring together with one of the substituents from the other triazacyclohexane ring forms a bridge between the two rings.<br>
The process of the present invention for the polymerization of olefins can be combined with all industrially known polymerization processes. The advantageous pressure and temperature ranges for carrying out the process therefore depend strongly on the polymerization method. The catalyst systems used<br><br>
.ccordmg to tne present invention can inus De empioyea in an ;nown polymerization processes, i.e., for example, in ligh-pressure polymerization processes, in tube reactors or LUtoclaves, in suspension polymerization processes, in solution &gt;olymerization processes or in gas-phase polymerization. In the :ase of high-pressure polymerization processes, which are usually :arried out at pressures in the range from 1 000 to 4 000 bar, in articular from 2 000 to 3 500 bar, high polymerization temperatures are also set as a rule. Advantageous temperature ranges for these high-pressure polymerization processes are from iOO to 380°C, in particular from 220 to 270°C. In the case of .ow-pressure polymerization processes, the temperature set is generally at least a few degrees below the softening temperature )f the polymer. In particular, temperatures in the range from 50 :o 180°C, preferably from 70 to 120°C, are set in these polymerization processes. The pressures here are usually in the range from 1 to 40 bar, preferably from 5 to 40 bar. Among the abovementioned polymerization processes, gas-phase polymerization, in particular in gas-phase fluidized-bed reactors, and suspension polymerization, in particular in loop reactors, are particularly preferred according to the present invention.<br>
Various olefinically unsaturated compounds can be polymerized by the process of the present invention. In contrast to some known iron and cobalt complexes, the transition metal complexes used according to the present invention display good polymerization activity even in the case of higher a-olefins and polar comonomers, so their suitability for copolymerization is worthy of particular mention. Possible olefins are particularly ethylene and a-olefins having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms, but also dienes such as butadiene and polar monomers such as acrylic esters and vinyl acetate. Vinylaromatic compounds such as styrene can also be polymerized by the process of the present invention.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process of the present invention, monomers used are mixtures of ethylene with C3-C8-a-olefins such as propene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene or 1-octene.<br>
Some of the metal complexes designated as component (A) are themselves not polymerization-active and then have to be brought into contact with an activator, viz. component (B), in order to be able to display polymerization activity. Possible activator compounds are, for example, those of the aluminoxane type, in particular methylaluminoxane. Aluminoxanes are prepared, for example, by controlled addition of water to alkylaluminum<br><br>
compounds, in particular trimethylaluminum. Aluminoxane preparations suitable as cocatalyst are also commercially available. It is assumed that these are mixtures of cyclic and linear compounds. The cyclic aluminoxanes can be represented by the formula (R10AlO)k and the linear aluminoxanes by the formula R102Al(R10AlO)kR10, where k can be from 1 to 50. R10 is preferably a Ci-C6~alkyl, e.g. methyl, ethyl, butyl or isobutyl, particularly preferably methyl. It is also possible for various radicals R10 to be present in an aluminoxane. Advantageous aluminoxanes comprise essentially aluminoxane oligomers having a degree of oligomerization of from about 5 to 30.<br>
As well as aluminoxanes, it is also possible to use activator<br>
components as are employed in the cationic activation of<br>
metallocene complexes. Such activator components are known from,<br>
for example, EP-B1-0468537 and EP-B1-0427697. In particular,<br>
boranes or borates can be used as such activator compounds (B).<br>
Particular preference is given to using boranes or borates which<br>
bear at least two substituted aryl radicals. A particularly<br>
useful borate is dimethylanilinium<br>
tetrakispentafluorophenylborate, and a particularly preferred<br>
borane is trispentafluorophenylborane.<br>
Further activator components which can be used are compounds such as aluminum aIkyIs, in particular trimethylaluminum, aluminum trifluoride or perchlorates. The aluminum alkyls can at the same time be used for reacting with and thus removing water or other 'impurities.<br>
It is sometimes desirable to use a combination of various activators. This is known, for example, in the case of metallocenes where boranes and borates are often used in combination with an aluminum alkyl. A combination of various activator components with the transition metal complex used according to the present invention is generally also possible.<br>
The amount of activator compounds to be used depends on the type of activator. In general, the molar ratio of transition metal complex (A) to activator compound (B) can be from 1:0.1 to 1:10 000, preferably from 1:1 to 1:1 000. The molar ratio of transition metal complex (A) to dimethylanilinium tetrakispentafluorophenylborate is preferably in the range from 1:1 to 1:20 and particularly preferably from 1:1 to 1:15, while that to methylaluminoxane is preferably in the range from 1:1 to 1:3 000, and particularly preferably from 1:10 to 1:500. The amount of activator compound can be used to control not only the activity of the catalyst but also polymer properties such as the<br><br>
\olecular weight. The optimum amount accordingly varies as a Junction of the desired activity/polymer properties and depending &gt;n the respective transition metal complex and can be determined :&gt;y simple experimentation -<br>
The transition metal complex can be brought into contact with the activator compound or compounds either before or after it is Drought into contact with the olefins to be polymerized. Preactivation using one or more activator compounds prior to nixing with the olefin and further addition of the same or different activator compounds after this mixture has been brought into contact with the olefin is also possible. Preactivation is generally carried out at 10-100°C, preferably 20-80°C.<br>
It is also possible for more than one of the transition metal complexes used according to the present invention to be simultaneously brought into contact with the olefin to be polymerized. This has the advantage that a further range of polymers can be produced in this way. For example, bimodal products can be prepared in this manner.<br>
A likewise broad product spectrum can be achieved by use of the complexes employed according to the present invention in the presence of a catalyst customary for the polymerization of olefins. Catalysts which can be used here are, in particular, classical Ziegler-Natta catalysts based on titanium, classical Phillips catalysts based on chromium oxides, metallocenes (cf., for example, Coville et al. , J. Orgmet. Chem. 479 (1994) 1-29), constrained geometry complexes (cf., for example, EP-A-416815 or EP-A-420436), nickel- and palladium-bisimine systems (for the preparation of these, see WO-A-98/03559), iron- and cobalt-pyridinebisimine compounds (for the preparation of these, see WO-A-98/27124) or titanium- and zirconium-Schiff base complexes (cf., for example, EP-A-874 005). Thus, for example, bimodal products can also be prepared or comonomers can be generated in situ by means of such combinations.<br>
The transition metal complexes (A) used according to the present invention can also optionally be immobilized on an organic or inorganic support and be used in supported form in the polymerization. In this way, catalysts for the polymerization of olefins which comprise at least one transition metal complex (A) and, if desired, one or more activator compounds (B) and a support material are obtained. This is a customary method of avoiding deposits in the reactor and of controlling the polymer morphology. Support materials used are preferably silica gel, magnesium chloride, aluminum oxide, mesoporous materials,<br><br>
iluminosilicates and organic polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene or polystyrene, in particular silica gel or nagnesium chloride. The support material can also be dried or :alcined prior to being brought into contact with the transition netal complex or the activator compound.<br>
The activator compound(s) (B) and one or more transition metal complexes (A) can be brought into contact with the support material in various orders or simultaneously. This is generally carried out in an inert solvent which is separated off by filtration or evaporated after the immobilization. It is also possible to use the supported catalysts while still moist. Thus, the mixture of the support material can firstly be brought into contact with the activator compound or compounds (B) or the support material can firstly be brought into contact with the transition metal complex (A). It is also possible for the transition metal complex (A) to be precontacted with one or more activator compounds (B) prior to mixing with the support. The preferred procedure is for a mixture of the transition metal complex (A) with one or more activator compounds (B) to be mixed with the support material and subsequently dried. The amount of metal complex (A) (in mmol) per gram of support material can vary greatly, e.g. between 0.001 to 1 mmol/g. The preferred amount of metal complex (A) per gram of support material is in the range from 0.001 to 0.5 mmol/g, particularly preferably from 0.005 to 0.1 mmol/g. In a possible embodiment, the metal complex (A) can also be prepared in the presence of the support material. A further method of immobilization is prepolymerization of the catalyst system with or without prior application to a support.<br>
These supported catalyst systems are particularly useful in processes for the polymerization or copolymerization of olefins. Possible olefins include not only ethylene and a-olefins having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms but also internal olefins and nonconjugated and conjugated dienes such as butadiene, 1,5-hexadiene or 1,6-heptadiene, cyclic olefins such as cyclohexene, cyclopentene or norbornene, polar monomers such as acrylic esters, acrolein, acrylonitrile, vinyl alcohol and vinyl acetate or vinylaromatic compounds such as styrene. Preference is given to polymerizing at least one olefin selected from the group consisting of ethene, propene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-octene and 1-decene. In a preferred embodiment of the process of the invention, the monomers used are mixtures of ethylene or propylene with one another or with C4-Ci2-cc-olef ins .<br><br>
The process of the present invention makes it possible to prepare polymers and copolymers of olefins over a broad molecular weight range.<br>
The preparation of various triazacyclohexane ligands has been known for a long time. The simplest route is the condensation reaction of aldehydes such as formaldehyde with appropriately substituted amines, in particular alkylamines.

Procedure for the polymerization experiments<br>
The polymerization experiments were carried out under argon using in each case between 5 to 20 [xmol of the complexes (see Table 2) in 250 ml of absolute toluene at 40°C.<br>
In the activation experiments using MAO, in each case the amount of 1.6 molar MAO in toluene indicated in Table 2 was added. When activation was carried out using borate, the appropriate amount of DMAB (dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate) was added, the mixture was heated to 70°C and subsequently admixed with Tibal (triisobutylaluminum) as indicated in Table 2. The solution was cooled again to 40°C. About 20-40 1/h of ethylene were then passed through the solution for one hour (at atmospheric pressure). In the copolymerization experiments, 5 ml of hexene were initially introduced before the ethylene was passed through the solution, after which ethylene was passed through and the remaining amount of hexene was added via a dropping funnel over a period of 15 minutes. When butene was used, about 10-20 1/h of butene were passed through the solution together with the ethylene.<br>
The reaction was stopped by addition of a mixture of 15 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 50 ml of methanol and the mixture was stirred for another 15 minutes. After addition of 250 ml of methanol, the solid was filtered off, washed with methanol and dried at 70°C. Polymerization and product data are summarized in Table 2.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Examples 39 to 45<br>
The polymerizations were carried out in a 1 1 four-necked flask provided with contact thermometer, stirrer with Teflon blade, heating mantle and gas inlet tube. Under argon, from 10 to 20 \xm of (Do3TAC)CrCl3 in 250 ml of absolute toluene were in each case placed in the flask at 4 0°C. The amount of dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate indicated in Table 3 was then added, the mixture was heated to 70°C and subsequently admixed with Tibal (triisobutylaluminum) in a Cr:Al ratio of 1:50. The solution was cooled again to 40°C and about 20-40 1/h of ethylene were subsequently passed through it for from 20 to 60 minutes.<br>
The reaction was stopped by addition of a mixture of 15 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 50 ml of methanol and the mixture was stirred for another 15 minutes. 250 ml of methanol were then added, the mixture was stirred for another 15 minutes, the solid was filtered off, washed with methanol and dried at 1 70°C. The polymerization and product data are summarized in Table 3.<br><br><br><br>
Example 4 6<br>
Application to a polystyrene support<br>
Polystyrene (102 g) was suspended in 700 ml of toluene and stirred at room temperature for 5 hours. The polystyrene was then filtered off and stirred with 800 ml of diethyl ether for 1 day. The polystyrene was filtered off again and subsequently suspended in 800 ml of methanol. After the mixture had been filtered again, the solid was once again suspended in 800 ml of methanol and filtered again. The resulting polystyrene was dried under reduced pressure. In this way, purified polystyrene could generally be obtained in a yield of about 90% by weight.<br>
11.5 g of polystyrene support material were added to a mixture of 863 mg of (D03TAC)CrCl3, 50.1 ml of methylaluminoxane (30% by weight in toluene) (Al:Cr = 200:1) and 5 ml of toluene and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. Drying under reduced pressure gave 27.4 g of supported catalyst having a loading of 100 ^imol/g of support.<br>
Examples 4 7 to 51<br>
The polymerizations were carried out in a 10 1 stirring autoclave. Under nitrogen, 100 mg of Tibal (triisobutylaluminum) were placed in the autoclave at room temperature, and 4 1 of isobutane were then metered in. For copolymerization of butene, 400 ml of butene were additionally condensed into the autoclave. The mixture was then heated to 70°C while stirring and the amount of supported catalyst indicated in Table 4 was subsequently injected by means of ethylene pressure. The reactor pressure was then increased to a final pressure of 4 0 bar by means of ethylene and the polymerization was continued for one hour.<br>
The reaction was stopped by venting the reactor and the products were discharged. Table 4 summarizes the polymerization and product data.<br><br><br><br>
