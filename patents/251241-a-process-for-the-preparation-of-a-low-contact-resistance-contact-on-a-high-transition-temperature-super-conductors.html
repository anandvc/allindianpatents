				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF LOW CONTACT RESISTANCE CONTACT ON A HIGH TRANSITION TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTORS.<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the development of low contact resistance joints on the solid bodies of HTSC (High Temperature Superconducting compound) of BiPbSrCaCuO for the transport of high currents below T0 (critical temperature). The tube/rod conductors of HTSC Bi(2223 ) (BiPbSrCaCuO) are capable of carrying very high currents at 77K and due to their low thermal conductivity they produce very low thermal load on system. Moreover if the contact resistance between HTSC and the current lead is low these tube/rod conductors become ideal high current transport leads for any system like cryogen free superconducting magnets/ superconducting magnet generators etc. Background Art<br>
Parameters in high current transmission in conventional conductors like Cu, Al, etc. are mostly due to the resistance of the conductors, which produces a significant amount of energy loss. Loss-less transport of current has been the main point of attraction in superconductors from the very beginning. The low T0 conventional superconducting materials have been used in making high field magnets (~20 tesla), which are now readily available. The operative temperature, i.e. 4.2K (requiring a constant flow of liquid of helium) has hampered the growth of high current carrying leads and cables. The advancements in this field of high transport current are restricted up to prototype level only. The advent of high T0 superconducting compounds (HTSC) has raised the hopes for high transport current leads as the operating temperature is raised to 77K. However, poor ductility and low critical field had put restrictions on immediate applications, However the development of HTSC multifilamentary cables of Bi(2223) having J0 ~ 105A/cm2 at 77K in a field 0.6T showed a good promise but again they are not a very conventional answer. In comparison, the tube conductors of high T0 superconductors have shown good potential. HTS current-leads based on BSCCO tubes and rods are the first applications of ceramic superconductors in electrical power engineering where they offer a major advantage over both, the conventional superconductors as well as the traditional all-metal leads of good conductors such as Cu and Al. Conventional low T0 superconductors embedded hi copper were considered a better option over all-metal leads because of their zero resistance and their capacity to transport high currents defined by their critical current density Jc (~105 Amps/cm2), but because of the restrictions of operation at 4.2K these materials could not always replace Cu or Al.<br>
In addition to the higher operational temperature of 77K, the HTSC materials have then-low thermal-conductivity, which reduces the heat-losses by more than a typical factor of 10. This reduces the heat load on the cryogenic system and results in a significant reduction in refrigeration cost and allows for new innovative cooling concepts. Their other applications are in the field of magnetic shielding and current-limiters.<br>
All above utilization of HTSC tube conductors for high current application (Ic&gt;1000A) become ineffective and lossy if the contact resistance of the joints of the normal conductors (Cu, Al) feeding high currents to HTSC tube conductors are of the orders of 10"4 -10"3 fl. The requirement to utilize the tube conductors to their optimum, the contact resistance of the nonnal conductors joining to HTSC tube conductors should be at least of the order of 10"<br>

Reference may be made to disclosure by K H Sandhage et al. in Journal of Materials Vol 43, pp21 (1991) wherein it is taught that among the HTSC family the Y-based superconductors suffer from many crystallographic limitations to synthesize tube and rod conductors and only thin film applications are commercialized. In yet another disclosure by E H Hellstorm in Materila Research Bulletin Vol XVII ,pp 45 ,(1992) it has been taught that Tl based superconductors due to health hazards are not being used for bulk applications. Only Bi-based superconductors (Bi2-xPbjtSr2Ca2Cu3Ox) d Bi(2212) are commercially economical and suitable answers as reported by S X Dou and H K Liu in Supercond. Science and Technol Vol 6,pp297,(1993).<br>
The contact resistance problem for high current electrical connection can only be solved using silver as normal conductors feeding the high current to Bi-based tube conductors. The major problem is to connect the silver feeder to Bi(2223) ceramic surface.<br>
The problem has been tackled in parts in several ways:<br>
US Pat # 5,149,686 and a US Pat (publication No 20030132023) disclose sputtering the non-superconducting metal (Ag, Au) on small bar shaped HTSC of urn order for making the electrical contact.<br>
Plasma spray technique of Ag/Au film on HTSC of pm order has been disclosed by Y Yamada in Bismuth Based High Temperature Superconductors Ed by H Maeda and T Togano pp 277 (1996).<br>
Then the high current feeders have been soldered on HTSC surface and a contact resistance of the order of 10"6 Q has been achieved at 77K.<br>
For small samples the sputtering technique has been successful but plasma deposition is used specially for bismuth based large samples like tube/rod conductors.<br>
US patent # 5,506,199 and K K Michishita et al in Bismuth Based High Temperature Superconductors Ed by H Maeda and T Togano pp 253 (1996) disclose   a process by partially encasing Ag tube, sheet or wire hi large samples of Bi 2212 melt. Objects of the invention<br>

Another object of the invention is to provide three layer process for the preparation of low contact resistance joint on high transition temperature superconductors.<br>

The present invention describes a three layer process for making contact points to a high transition temperature superconductor (HTSC) particularly to (Bi,Pb)z Sra Caa CusOio+x with and without silver hi the superconductor. The contact structure is a three layer configuration with a perforated silver foil sandwiched between two metal spray gun deposited silver layers and subsequent heat treatment in air. The contact has been made on tubes and rods. The silver contacts made have the characteristics of low resistance of 10"6 짙1.. Further, the contacts are capable of carrying a continuous current of 200 Amps without adding any substantial heat load to the cryogen used to cool the HTSC. Brief description of the accompanying drawings<br>
In the drawings accompanying this specification Fig 1. shows the structure of the contact on the HTSC tube or rod. (1) is a HTSC tube or rod with grooves at the ends, (2) is the first deposited silver layer (3) is the silver foil, (4) are the perforations hi the silver foil, (5) is the second deposited silver layer, and (6) are the contacts for braded leads. Detailed description of the invention<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a low contact resistance contact on high transition temperature superconductors which comprises making a groove at the end of the superconductor, depositing a first silver layer by metal spray gun at a temperature 120째C , heating the said deposited silver layer at a temperature<br>
in a range of 200-250째C for a time period in the range of 2-5 hrs , wrapping a perforated silver foil on the said heat treated first silver layer, depositing a second silver layer by metal spray gun at a temperature of 120째C, heating the said combination of first silver layer, wrapped perforated silver foil and second silver layer at a temperature in a range of 830-850째C in air for a time period hi the range of 100-150 hrs resulting hi a joint with a contact resistance in the range of 10"7 to 10"6 Cl,<br>
In  an  embodiment' of the  present invention the  high  transition  temperature superconductor may be a hollow cylindrical tube of length in a range of 200-300mms<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention transition temperature superconductor may be a solid rod of length 150 mms,<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the wall thickness of the tube may be hi a range of 2-3 mms.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the outer diameter of the tube may be hi a range of 12-30 mms.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the high transition temperature superconductor may be pure (Bi,Pb)2 Sr2 Caz CuaOio+x.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention the high transition temperature superconductor may be (Bi,Pb)j Srj Caj CuaOio+x with 10wt.% silver.<br>
For making low contact resistance joints to the high transition temperature superconductors (HTSC), two types of samples, were taken namely tubular and/or rod HTSC. Fig 1 shows the HTSC sample (1). The dimensions of the tube ranged between 200 and 300 mms with an outer diameter hi the range of 12-3 Omm and wall thickness hi the range of 2-3mms. The ends of the tubes were machined to get a groove (2) of length of typically 20mms. It is on these grooves that the contacts were made. Rod samples were of the dimensions of length of 150mm and diameter hi the range of 3-5mm. HTSC samples used were (Bi,Pb)2 Sr2 Ca2 CusOio+x pure and with addition of 10 wt% silver.<br>
The process of making the contacts is described hereunder.<br>
The structure of the contact is shown hi Fig 1. First a layer of silver (3) metal was deposited on the groove (2) with the help of a metal spray gun with the temperature of the tube rising to about 120 째 C. This silver layer was heated to a temperature hi the range of 250-300째 C for a time hi the range of 2-5 hours hi ah". Next a silver foil (4) was taken and one surface was knurled and wrapped around the first spray deposited silver layer. The knurled surface was kept touching the first layer. The foil was perforated with equally spaced holes of diameter hi the range of 1-1.5 mm and a maximum of 18 holes were used with three columns of holes. The<br>
strip was of width 2 cm with a length in the range, of 4-6 cms. After the foil was wrapped completely leaving a small unwrapped portion (6) for making external contacts, a third layer (5) of silver was deposited with the help of metal spray gun with the HTSC sample temperature ,maintained at 120 째 C. The final contact system was heated in air for a time in the range of 100-150hrs at atemperature in the range of 830-850째C. The HTSC sample was then allowed to cool. External connections to all these samples were made to the silver metal ring by braded copper wires.<br>
The resistivity of the contacts made by the procedure described above were measured by a four-probe method and are summarized in Table 1.<br>
For four-probe method, the voltage taps were soldered directly to the superconductor close to the current contact. Two wires were attached to the current contact, one to carry current, and the other to detect voltage at the surface of the contact. The other voltage tap was soldered directly to the superconductor close to the current contact. Accuracy of the measurements was about 짹 10%. The measurements were taken both with and without magnetic field and at sample temperature of m77K and 4.2K.<br>
Optionally a two layer structure was also prepared which essentially consisted of first layer deposited by metal spray gun and the perforated silver foil. The final assembly being heated inn air for a temperature in the range of 830-850째C for a time hi the range of 100-1 SOhrs. However, the contact resistance was observed torn be in the range of 10"5 짙1<br>
The low specific resistance materials and HTSC cables can be used to energize superconducting magnets and other non-superconducting devices requiring high current transport as at 77K. Specific resistance of Cu is of the order of 10"9fl-m. The specialty of the tube conductors is due to zero loss and very low thermal conductivity of material.<br>
Especially devices which require very low power loss or low thermal load in current transport, tube conductors with low contact resistance are essential; like cryogen free magnetic systems where a close cycle system produces 10K temperature, any thermal load more than 1W becomes hazardous, only tube conductors are used.<br>
The importance of low contact resistance joint is vital hi these devices. Moreover low thermal conductivity is 1710th that of Cu makes it the first choice to avoid cryogen losses hi conventional uses of high transport current.<br>
Novelty of the invention lies hi the low contact resistance of 10"7 to 10"6 fi, and current carrying capacity of 200Amps continuously for at least 2hours. without adding any heat load to the cryogen.<br>
The said novelty has been achieved due to the non obvious inventive steps of taking a three layer fabrication process and using a perforated silver foil sandwiched between the metal spray gun deposited silver layers.<br>

The resistivity of the contacts made by the procedures described in the aforementioned examples were measured by a four-probe method and are summarized in Table 1.<br>
For four-probe method, the voltage taps were soldered directly to the superconductor close to the current contact. Two wires were attached to the current contact, one to carry<br>
current, and the other to detect voltage at the surface of the contact. The other voltage tap was soldered directly to the superconductor close to the current contact. Accuracy of the measurements was about + 10%.<br>
External connections to all these samples were made to the silver metal ring by braded copper wires. Table-1<br>
