The present invention relates to a process for the production of a dye-fixing agent and a process for producing colour fast dyed and printed textile material. The dye-fixing agents are for improving the fastness properties of dyeings and prints  a process for the production thereof, and the use thereof.<br>
Dyeings and prints often have unsatisfactory wet fastness, especially washing and water fastness. This is found with dyeings carried out using direct dyesiuffs, acid dyestuffs and to a lesser extent reactive dyestuffs. Substantive dyestuffs are those which have an affinity with the fibre to which they are applied.   All direct dyestuffs are regarded as being substantive to cellulosic materials in nature, whereas the reactive dyes are considered substantive as well as reactive. In the case of all reactive dyestuffs, part of the dyestuff will react chemically with a hydroxyl group on the cellulosic fibre and part of the dyestuff will not react with the fibre, but generally will be in a hydrolysed form.   The part of the dyestuff which has not chemically reacted with the fibre may be removed by repeated washing.   Acid dyes have a direct affinity towards protein fibres and are the main type of dyestuff used in wool dyeing.  Direct dyestuffs are however the first choice for dyeing cellulosic materials, having a strong affinity for them.   It is undesirable that dyestuffs exhibit a lack of wet-fasiness since the thus removed dyestuff may be absorbed by undid textile material being washed in the same washing operation and in addition the dyed substrate does not retain its original dyed colour.  It is known to treat the textile after dyeing with a dye-fixing agent in order to improve the wet-fastness of the dye.<br>
EP 0 250 365 (US 4822374), discloses a dye-fixing process which particularly improves the wet fastness of cellulosic dyeings produced with substantive dyestuffs, whereby the fibre material is treated with a polyquatemary ammonium compound of a N-alkyl-dialkylamino polymerisate.<br><br>
In DE 3938918 there are described, inter alias, textile dye-fixing agents in the form of mixtures of copolymers of various allylamines with a condensate of epichlorohydrin and a polyalkylene polyamine and with a reaction product of ammonia or amine and an epichlorohydrin, whereby the individual components are not reacted together, but exist as a synei;gistic mixture.<br>
Japanese Koki No. 6-108382 discloses a process for improving the wet fastness of dyed cellulosic fibre materials using a polymer which is obtained by the reaction of diallylamine with epihalohydrin, with subsequent polymerizations of the reaction products. The disadvantage of this reaction product is that, during the reaction of diallylamine with epihalohydrin, a considerable part of diallylamine dimers bridged by 2-hydroxy-l,3-propylene may be produced, especially as a result in particular of the relatively high temperatures (20 to 60Â°C) and the long reaction time (10 hours in example 1).  This leads to a high degree of crosslinking when these compounds are polymerised.   Such crosslinking has the effect that, during production or in storage, the aqueous end product becomes very viscous or even solid, and must therefore be precipitated in order to produce a storage-stable commercial product which is in powder form. A further disadvantage of the process described in Kokai No. 6-108382 is that there is a poor yield (82%-88%) of diallylamine polymer, or in other words, a relatively high monomer content. This is particularity undesirable, since diallylamine monomers are toxic.<br>
It is the aim of the present invention to provide polymeric, crosslinkable, but water-soluble dye-fixing agents, which lead to improved fastness of dyeings, in particular cellulosic dyeings, said dye-fixing agents not having a significant proportion of diallylamine monomers.<br>
This problem is solved by the dye-fixing agents according to the invention, which fix dyeings, in particular cellulosic dyeings on the fibre material particularity well, owing to the high reactivity with the textile fibres and the crosslinking to the fibre during application, and therefore produce especially good fastness of the dyeings.  Furthermore high yields of the dye fixing-agents are obtained as a result of the production process of<br><br>
the invention, with the result that the fixing agents have a small proportion of dialkylamino monomers. Thus as hereinafter described, the dye-fixing agents of the present invention impart excellent wet-fastness to the dyeings to which they are applied and (urthermore the dye fixing-agents are storage stable and do not have a significant proportion of dialiylamine monomers.<br>
In this case, high yields lie between 95% and 100% or even between 98% and 100%. By a small proportion of dialiylamine monomers is meant suitably less than about 5% by weight and preferably less than about 1.0% and more preferably less than Or/o by weight.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a dye-fixing agent by reacting in a first reaction step, either a homopolymer of dialiylamine or N-methyl-diallylamine or a copolymer of dialiylamine and N-methyl-dialiylamine, with an epihalohydrin, the reaction optionally taking place in the presence of an aliphatic amine or polyamine, or reacting the homopolymer or copolymer with a product obtainable by a reaction of epihalohyrin with an aliphatic amine or polyamine, at a temperature of-ISâC to 40Â°C in an alkaline pH range or at a temperature of 40Â°C to 90Â°C in a neutral to strongly acidic pH range, optionally followed by partial quatemisation of the reaction product of the first reaction step, wherein the end product possesses at least 10 mol% of tertiary amino groups of the following formula (I), based on the total number of amino groups<br>
âN-CHâCHCHâX	(I)<br>
OH<br>
wherein X = halogen, with the provisos that when the homopolymer is an N-methyl-diailylamine, the presence of an aliphatic amine or a polyamine is obligatory in the reaction with the epihalohydrin and when the homopolymer is a homopolymer of dialiylamine, partial quatemisation of the reaction product of the first reaction step is obligatory.<br>
The dialiylamine polymerisate should preferably not have any significant 2-hydroxy-1,3-propylene/diallyiamine bridging, so that the dye-fixing agent according to the invention is<br><br>
water-soluble and at room temperature is stable in storage.<br>
Such a dye-fixing agent has the advantage that, during application, the groups of formula (I) may crosslink on the fibres through a reaction of the 2-hydroxy-3-halopropyl radicals with polymeric, non-customary amino groups, and there is thus improved fixation on the<br>
fibres.<br>
Preferred compounds are characterised in that the end product additionally possesses at least 10 mol%, preferably at least 20%, of tertiary amino groups of formula (II)<br>
âN-CH3	(II)<br>

A preferred alkali is soda ash. A more preferred alkali is caustic soda.  If required, fixing is carried out in the presence of an electrolyte, e.g. sodium chloride, in a quantity of 5-20 g/1.<br>
Application of the dye-fixing agent to the substrate to be finished, may take place either, after the dyed substrate has been removed from the dye bath and has been rinsed, or after the dyed and rinsed substrate has undergone an intermediate dying step. The substrate to which a dye-fixing agent of the present invention has been applied (hereinafter referred to as the "fixed substrate" ) is rinsed, neutralized and dried in the usual manner.<br>
The nature of the dyestuff used for dyeing, is not critical. The dye-fixing agents of the present invention are suitable for fixing anionic dyestuffs in the form of reactive, direct or acid dyestuffs.  The dyestuff may be of a type listed in the Colour Index as CI. Reactive<br><br>

For mixed fabrics, dyes for other fibres may also be used. For example, for mixed fabrics of polyester and cellulose, apart from the above-mentioned reactive, acid or direct dyes, disperse dyes may also be employed.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a process for producing colour fast dyed and printed substrates such as leather and textile fibres containing hydroxy, amino or thiole groups, comprising the step of dyeing the substrate in a known manner and fixing the dye thereon by treatment with a dye-fixing agent by a process according to the invention.
