COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(Section 1 0;   Rule 13)<br>
(1)	"A PROCESS OF PREPARATION AND 'SMWTIIEBIS OF AN IRON SPECIFIC RESIN".<br>
(2)	The Directors of M/s, ION EXCHANGE INDIA LTD., (An Indian Joint Stock Company Registered under the companies Act, 1956), having office at Tiecicon House, DR. E, Moses Road, Mahalaxmi, Mumbai-400 011.<br>
The following specification describes the nature of this invention &amp; the manner in which it is performed;<br><br>
12-8-2004<br><br>
GRANTED<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a process of preparation and synthesis of an Iron Specific Resin for removal of dissolved iron from ground water.<br>
Conventionally, other catalytic media are produced for the removal of dissolved iron from ground water.<br>
These conventional catalytic media, however, have many disadvantages, some of which are mentioned below.<br>
The conventional catalytic media gets consumed to some extent during iron removal;<br>
hence life of media is not very long.<br>
Due to the above reason, conventional media are not very economical.<br>
The true density of conventional media is more (1.5 g/cc), due to which it cannot be easily backwashed.<br>
Moreover, the contact time required for the catalytic reaction is more.<br>
The labour and the operational cost required are considerable.<br>
Conventional catalytic media are available in the form of dark grey granules or pallets, because of which they can get compact within the bed.<br>
Further, minimum bed depth required is more (i.e.0.7 m).<br><br><br>
The present invention a process of preparation and synthesis of an Iron Specific Resin is designed with an objective to overcome all the disadvantages of the conventional catalytic media and to provide a better alternative.<br>
The first objective of the present invention is to produce an economical Iron Specific Resin which should also have a long life.<br>
The second objective is to produce a media which is less dense, so that it can be easily back washed.<br>
The contact time required by the resin for catalytic reaction should be less.<br>
Further, the shape of the resin should be such that it should not get compact within the bed.<br>
Minimum bed depth required should be less compared to the conventional media.<br>
The temperature range within which the media can work should be wide.<br>
The present invention "Iron Specific Resin" will now be explained in detail in the paragraphs that follow.<br><br><br>
Tfon is a common metallic element which naturally dissolves in water percolating through soil and rocks, thus entering ground water supplies. In deep wells and springs,<br>
where both the oxygen content and the pH tend to be low, water containing dissolved iron appears colourless. When this water is exposed to air, the dissolved iron reacts with the atmospheric oxygen and is converted to yellow coloured suspended particles and finally forms a reddish brown residue. High concentration of iron causes reddish brown stains in laundry, household utensils and fixtures. Sometimes, it may clog water distribution pipes. High level of iron can impart metallic taste to drinking water. The drinking water standard for iron is 0.3 ppm as per U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).<br>
The present invention is now explained in detail.<br>
Iron Specific Resin is an anion exchange resin coated with manganese dioxide, which effectively removes dissolved iron from ground water. It can be used by gravity for POU (Point Of Use) as well as pressured pumps in domestic unit - POE (Point Of Entry). It is an insoluble catalyst which enhances the oxidation of dissolved iron and converts the soluble iron (Fe++) into insoluble ferric (Fe+++) which produces ferric hydroxide and can be filtered through resin. The media can be easily cleaned by backwashing the unit to remove the precipitated iron particles.<br>
The following types of iron are commonly found dissolved:<br>
Ferrous Iron, which is clear when drawn, forms reddish / brown precipitate.<br><br><br>
Ferric Iron, which is coloured, forms reddish /brown precipitate.  olloidal iron which is a soluble organic iron, yellow /brown in colour, does not form a precipitate and is difficult to filter.<br>
Bacterial iron which forms an iridescent sheen on top of water and jelly-like sludge in the plumbing system.<br>
Now the present invention has been processed using strong base anion exchange resin. The resin is taken in hydroxyl form and converted into Mn02or Mn203 form using potassium permanganate solution. The following reaction takes place:-<br><br>
Manganese dioxide stays on resin and equivalent potassium hydroxide comes into water. The reaction enhances with 1% hydrogen peroxide solution which gives stable manganese dioxide which is effective for iron removal.<br>
The synthesis of iron removal media using strong base anion exchange resin is explained beiow:-<br>
The chemicals required are potassium permanganate and hydrogen peroxide.<br><br><br>
Charge the necessary batch volume of Indion anion exchange resin in a well stirred    glass lined / stainless steel vessel.<br>
Prepare 3 to 5% (w/v) solution of caustic 80 - 120 g/lit and pass the caustic within two hours. Rinse the caustic with DM water to remove excess alkali.<br>
Prepare 3 - 5% (w/v) solution of potassium permanganate, and pass it within five hours from top to bottom. Adjust the rpm of stirrer so that the resin should remain in suspension form. Simultaneously remove potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution at the same rate as that of potassium permanganate.<br>
Maintain the temperature in the range 45 -65° C while passing the KMn04,<br>
After the complete addition of potassium permanganate solution, wash the resin with DM water till pH of effluent water is 7.0 to 7.5. Pass 5% (w/v) sodium chloride 2 bed volume through resin, within two hours. Wash the resin with DM to remove excess chloride.<br>
Soak the resin in 0.2 to 1.0 % hydrogen peroxide for 6 -10 hours.<br>
Rinse the resin with DM water to remove excess hydrogen peroxide.<br>
Now the resin is ready as De-ferrous media.<br><br><br>
The present invention "Iron Specific Resin" has many advantages over conventional  atalytic media, some of which are mentioned below.<br>
The size of the present media ranges form 0.3 to 1.2 mm; hence it is the best filter media.<br>
Further, this present media does not get consumed in iron removal. As a result, the life of media is very long.<br>
The present media gives a superior performance compared to conventional catalytic media by providing iron free (less than 0.3ppm) water.<br>
The present media proves to be more economical than the conventional media.<br>
Since the present media is less dense (True density = 1.23 g/ee), it can be backwashed easily. Hence, cleaning is very simple.<br>
The contact time required for catalytic reaction of the present media is comparatively<br>
less.<br>
The labour required and the operational cost for the present media is negligible.<br>
Due to its circular bead form, the present media does not get compact within the bed.<br><br><br>
Minimum bed depth required by present media is less compared to the conventional media.<br>
Further, under standard conditions, no chemicals are required to regenerate the unit. The present media can work with a wide range of temperature he, 25 - 45°C. The osmotic and mechanical strength of the present media is also very good.<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:-<br>
