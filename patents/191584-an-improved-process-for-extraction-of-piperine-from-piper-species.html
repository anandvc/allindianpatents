				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for extraction of piperine from piper species such as Piper nigrum, Piper retrofractum, Piper longum, Piper schmiditii. This method is particularly related to the extraction of piperine using aqueous hydrotrope solutions for the first time.<br>
Piperine (C17H1903N) is the major constituent of black pepper (Piper nigrum) and is used extensively as a spice, condiment, insecticide and for medicinal purposes. It has shown potent chemoprotective effect against procarcinogens (Reen and Rashmet, J. Ethnopharmacol., 1997, 58(3), 165-173). The extracts of Piper nigrum are found to have a hypercoagulative effect in vitro; they lessen the clotting time by accelerating the thrombin activation and lowering the heparin level in the clotting systems. (Hasselstorm et.al., Food Res., 1954 19, 373). They are valued for their rubefacient properties and hence used as local application for sore throat, piles and some skin diseases (Wealth of India, Raw Materials, Vol.Ill, pg.110).<br>
The concentration of piperine is about 6% to 9% in Piper nigrum, 4.0% in Piper logum fruits and 4.5% in Piper retrofractum. Prior art for separation of Piperine<br>
H. Staudinger and H. Schneider [Ber; 56, 699(1923)] described a process for the extraction of piperine from Piper nigrum fruits, wherein the alkaloid was extracted using ethanol and the extract was treated with aqueous sodium hydroxide to remove all the resinous matter. Other solvents used for extraction are petroleum ether and dichloromethane. The extraction of piperine into thee organic solvents is not selective as other compounds like gums, polysaccharides and resins are extracted reducing the purity of piperine. The post extraction processing to purify piperine is cumbersome and uneconomical. A liquid pepper compositin containing pepper in a concentrated form has been prepared by extracting the pepper fruits with acetone and subsequent treatment with anhydrous lactic acid (Wealth of India, Raw Materials, Vol.lll, pg.lll).<br>
Vidal, J.P. and Richard, H., (Scientific Aliments 1987, 7(3), 481-98) outlines a procedure<br>
for the production of black pepper oleoresins by dense carbon dioxide extraction or carbon<br>
dioxide   +   ethanol	extraction.	The	extract        contains    16.7%      essential<br>
oils and 42.2% piperine which was very close to that obtained by dichloromethane is solvent,<br>
Hans j (3,706594 German. Offen. DE 28/02/1987, Bevffet) described a proeas wherein gaseous carbon dioxide under supercritical conditions is passed downward through a packed bed of pulverised pepper and the loaded solvent is then expanded in I downstream separator for release of the extracted material. However, this process using supercritical fluid extraction is not economical and still a further solvent extraction step|is essential for obtaining pure piperine.<br>
Most of these prior art processes relate to the extraction of Piper nigrum oleoresin<br>
containing piperine and other volatile oils, Piperine containing oleojresin is then solvent<br>
extracted and recrystallised to obtain pure piperine. These conventional processes are<br>
carried out using a number of steps which often present difficult operating conditions and<br>
 result in a high cost of production.	-	<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a cost effective process for<br>
the extraction of piperine from Piper species in a substantially pure form using the<br>
phenomena of hydrotropy The approach was to find a suitable hydrotrope for selecttve<br>
extraction of piperine from Piper species followed by dilution of the extract phase to<br>
precipitate piperine in pure form.<br>
In this process of invention the selective extraction of phytochemicals like<br>
piperine is conducted in a simple two - step process which successfully exploits the<br>
ability of hydrotropes to dissolve the otherwise water insoluble organic compounds in<br>
aqueous solution.<br>
The first step involves the selective extraction of piperine from Piper species and<br>
its soiubilisatioa in the aqueous hydrotrope solution. The second step involves the<br>
recovery of piperine by simple dilution with water as most of the piperine precipitates<br>
out.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the extracted piperine is rfcovered from<br>
aqueous hydrotrope solution by extraction with organic solvents fWlowed by de soi-ntisation.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the extraction of piperine from Piper nigrum in the first step without using an organic solvent or excessive temperature to retain the purity of piperine.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides An improved process for extraction of piperine of formula 1 from piper species<br>
Formula 1 <br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
.     contacting the piper species with an aqueous hydrotrope solution at temperature from 0- 100Â°C and separating the solution obtained from the solid residue known methods, ii.   Recovering the piperine from the solution obtained at the end of step (I) by solvent extraction with organic solvent after dilution with water or without dilution and then desolventising to recover piperine in pure form or so as to bring the concentration of hydrotrope sufficiently low to precipitate piperine from the solution in solid form and separating the precipitated piperine from the solution obtained, followed by washing with water. In an embodiment of the invention the piperine is recovered from the aqueous solution of hydrotrope obtained in step (I), after dilution with water so as to bring the concentration of hydrotrope sufficiently low to precipitate piperine from the solution in solid form and separating the precipitated piperine from the solution obtained, followed by washing with water or without dilution, by extraction with organic solvent selected from a group of aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, ethers, esters, ketones, amides, alcohols or a mixture thereof.<br>
In general the process of the invention is described as follows :<br>
The dried fruits of piper species such as piper nigrum, Piper longum, Piper retrofractum, Piper<br>
schmididtii in pulverized form, preferably in the mesh size of 5 to 300 are brought in intimate contact<br>
with an aqueous solution of hydrotrope in the form of a slurry in a stirred vessel or in a column in<br>
which       the	coarse	Piper	species        powder       is     packed   and the solution<br>
passes over it. In the process of invention when the contacting is done in the stirred vessed the Piper species powder is added to the aqueous hydrotrope solution. After the aforementioned components are brought together in the mixture usually in the form of slurry the mixture is agitated for a period sufficient for the extraction of pipeline to take place. A typical mixing time is in the range of 15 minutes to 24.00 hours depending upon the concentration of hydrotrope and the speed of agitation. The mixing is conducted at a selected temperature from 0Â°C -100Â°C preferably at room tempefature of 30Â°C. and atmospheric pressure.<br>
The Piper species for the extraction of pipeline is selected from the grou$i consisting of Piper nigrum, Piper longiim, Piper retrofractum, Piper schmidtii<br>
The term "hydrotrope" indicates short alkyl chain water soluble amphiphillic compounds. The hydrotrope is selected from the group consisting offsodium, potassium calcium, ammonium, magnesium salts of alkyl benzene sulfonates, such as benzane . sulfonate, toluene sulfonate, xylene sulfonate, ethyl benzene sulfonate; styrene sulfonate| pseudocumene sulfonate, mesitylene sulfonate, propyl benzene sulfonate and butyl benzene sulfonate; alkyl polyglycol sulfates and phosphates such as methyl cellosolve sulfate, ethyl cellosolve sulfate, propyl cellosolve sulfate, butyl cellosolve sulfate, pentyt cellosolve sulfate, hexyl cellosolve sulfate and the corresponding phosphates with sodium, potassium, and calcium counterions; methyl diglycol sulfates, ethyl diglycol sulfates, propyl diglycol sulfates, butyl diglycol sulfates, pentyl diglycol sulfates, hexyl diglycol sulfates and phosphates     salts with of sodium,  potassium,  calcium and) ammonium counterions; substituted aromatic   carboxylates such as hydroxybenzotaes, toluates, chiorobenzoates, nitrobenzoates,  alkyl  benzene carboxylates with  sodium, potassium,   calcium   and   ammonium   counterions;   substituted   phenates,   such   as hydroxyphenates, chlorophenates, alkyl phenates, naphthols; naphthalene carboxylates and substituted naphthalene carboxylates such as hydroxy naphthalene carboxylates<br>
After the mixing the solid residue is separated from the solution by decantation or filtration or by centrifugation. The separated residue is washed with water and the washing is combined with filtrate or the filtrate is used as such for the recovery of pipeline.<br>
The fiitrste is diluted with water to bring the concentration of hydrotrope to low enough to precipitate pipeline from the solution. The dilution is done at a temperature at a range 00-800C preferably in the range 20Â°-30Â°C. The precipitated pipeline is separata! from the solution by decantation or filtration or centrifugation. The pipertne is washad with water and dried. The hydrotrope solution recovered during this step is concentrates and recycled.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention the filtrate obtained! after the step (1)is subjected to extraction with an organic solvent for recovery of piperite torn the aqueous solution of hydrotrope after dilution of the hydrotrope solution wifi 'water or withaut dilution. The organic solvent selected for the extraction should beimmiscible with water and is selected from a group consisting of aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatii, hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, ethers, esters, alcohols, amides and a mixture thereof.<br><br>
