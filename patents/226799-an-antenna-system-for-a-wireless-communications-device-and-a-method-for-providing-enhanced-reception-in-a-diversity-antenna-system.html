				<td>AN ANTENNA SYSTEM FOR A WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS<br>
DEVICE AND A METHOD FOR PROVIDING ENHANCED<br>
RECEPTION IN A DIVERSITY ANTENNA SYSTEM<br>
Field Of The Invention<br>
The present invention generally relates to an antenna system for a wireless communications<br>
device and a method for providing enhanced reception in a diversity antenna system and to a<br>
system and a method for providing auxiliary reception and, more specifically, to a system and<br>
a method for providing auxiliary reception in a wireless communications system.<br>
Background Of The Invention<br>
A signal received or transmitted by a wireless communications device in a wireless<br>
communications network is affected by many factors. For example, the distance from the<br>
wireless communications device to the nearest base station in the wireless communications<br>
network has a direct bearing on the strength of the received signal. In addition, environmental<br>
parameters tend to influence the quality of the received signal. Thus, for example, constructive<br>
and destructive interference due to multipath considerations can become accentuated in urban<br>
settings.<br>
Conventional wireless communications devices have a single antenna for receiving and<br>
transmitting communications signals. If the conventional wireless communications device is<br>
receiving poor communications signals as a result of multipath signals in a particular<br>
environment, the user may be forced to move around in a random fashion in an attempt to find a<br>
location with improved reception. With that purpose in mind, the user may also be<br>
simultaneously orienting the wireless communications device and its single antenna in a myriad<br>
of directions. However, even such undesirable remedies may be unavailable under certain<br>
conditions such as, for example, when the user is unable to move freely or to perform<br>
burdensome tasks such as orienting the wireless communications device.<br>
Conventional communications devices can also employ the antenna in a mobile assisted<br>
hand off (MAHO). As the wireless communications device moves between cells in wireless<br>
communications network, the received signal from the current cell may become weak. To assist<br>
in determining when to perform a hand off, the wireless communications device may monitor<br>
signals, such as the pilot signal, from other cell base stations. When the wireless<br>
communications device identifies another cell having a more desirable signal quality, then the<br>
wireless communications device may request that the network be transferred to the more<br><br>
desirable cell. Thus, for example, the conventional communications device may switch from a<br>
frequency fi in, for example, the personal communications services (PCS) band of the first cell to<br>
another frequency f2 that is in the PCS band of the second cell. Such hand offs from one<br>
frequency in one cell to another frequency in another cell within the same communications band<br>
provide very limited options toward the goal of optimizing communications signals and are only<br>
provided in the area between cells. For example, a conventional wireless device operating in the<br>
PCS band may assist in performing hand offs between PCS base stations. However, if the current<br>
PCS signal fades and a stronger PCS pilot is not found, then a call may be dropped.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
The present invention alleviates to a great extent the disadvantages of conventional<br>
apparatus and methods for wireless communications.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the present invention provides a system and a method for<br>
providing auxiliary reception in a wireless communications device. The wireless<br>
communications device includes two antennas. In such an arrangement, one antenna maybe used<br>
to establish two-way communications with a wireless communications network, while the other<br>
antenna performs auxiliary functions. The auxiliary functions may include, for example,<br>
enabling mobile assisted hand off (MAHO) between communications bands and modes,<br>
implementing a diversity antenna system or providing a GPS signal to a global positioning<br>
system (GPS) system.<br>
The present invention has an advantage in that he wireless communications device may be<br>
enabled to scan and to evaluate other channels, bands or modes of wireless communications in<br>
determining whether a MAHO should be initiated. Thus, for example, the main antenna system<br>
of the wireless communications device may be enabled :o hand off or to switch to another<br>
channel, band or mode of wireless communications.<br>
The present invention also has an advantage in that the wireless communications devise<br>
may be enabled to improve the signal quality received by the wireless communications device by<br>
receiving the signal via the auxiliary antenna instead of or in combination with the signal<br>
received via the main antenna.<br>
The present invention further has an advantage in that the auxiliary antenna may be<br>
constructed to also provide location information by receiving GPS signals. The location<br>
information determined from the GPS signals can be, for example, displayed or transmitted via<br>
the wireless communications device.<br><br>
These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be appreciated from<br>
review of the following detailed description of the present invention, along with the<br>
accompanying figures in which like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout.<br>

Detailed Description Of The Invention<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a wireless communications system<br>
according to the present invention. The wireless communications system includes a wireless<br>
communications device 100. The wireless communications device 100 may include, for<br>
example, a handheld wireless communications device, a mobile phone, a car phone, a cellular or<br>
a personal communications services (PCS) phone, a cordles;s phone, a laptop computer or other<br>
computing device with a wireless modem, a pager or a personal digital assistant (PDA). The<br>
wireless device 100 may be digital or analog or some combination thereof. Indeed, the wireless<br>
communications device 100 may be any type of wireless communications device or combinations<br>
thereof known to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The wireless communications device 100 may include two antennas, such as a main<br>
antenna 110 and an auxiliary antenna 120. As illustrated in FIG. 1, the main antenna 110 is in<br>
two-way communications with a first base station 130. The first base station 130 may be, for<br>
example, one of a plurality of base stations in a wireless communications network. The auxiliary<br>
antenna 120 is in at least one-way communications with the first base station 130, a second base<br>
station 140 or a satellite 150. The second base station 140 may be, for example, another base<br>
station of the plurality of base stations in the wireless communications network. The satellite 150<br><br>
may be, for example, one of a plurality of satellites such as in, for example, a constellation of<br>
global positioning system (GPS) satellites and their ground stations.<br>
In operation, the wireless communications device 100 can establish two-way<br>
communications with the wireless communications network via, for example, the main antenna<br>
110 being in wireless communications with the first base station 130. The wireless<br>
communications device 100 may then use the auxiliary antenna 120, for example, to assist in<br>
providing an enhanced mobile assisted hand off (MAHO), a diversity antenna system, or a GPS<br>
system. ]t will be appreciated that the wireless communications device 100 may distribute<br>
functionality between the antennas in an intelligent nanner. For example, the wireless<br>
communications device 100 may determine that network communications would be better<br>
established on the auxiliary antenna 120. Subsequently, ths wireless communications device 100<br>
may use the auxiliary antenna 120 to provide the main functions and the main antenna 110 to<br>
provide the auxiliary functions.<br>
In enabling an enhanced MAHO functionality, the v/ireless communications device 100<br>
receives signals from at least one base station (e.g., the first base station 130 or the second base<br>
station 140) within range of the wireless communications device 100. The received signals can<br>
be from a plurality of bands or a plurality of channels within the bands. For example, the<br>
received signals can be from channels of the cellular band (i.e., a band at approximately SOO<br>
MHz), the PCS band (i.e., a band at approximately 1900 MHz) or other bands known to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art. Via the auxiliary antenna 120, the wireless communications device 100<br>
can monitor, for example, the clarity, strength or other characteristics of other channels or bands<br>
in deciding whether to switch the channels or the bands through which information is received or<br>
transmitted by the main antenna 110.<br>
In addition, not only can the wireless communications device 100 monitor other channels<br>
or bands, but the wireless communications device 100 may also monitor different modes. Thus,<br>
for example, the wireless communications device 100 may be monitoring signals transmitted<br>
according to code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA),<br>
advanced mobile phone service (AMPS) or any other modes known ::o one of ordinaiy skill in the<br>
art. Accordingly, the wireless communications device 100 can perform a MAHO across modes,<br>
for example, from CDMA to TDMA. Thus, the wireless communications device 100 can switch,<br>
for example, from receiving or transmitting CDMA signals to receiving or transmitting TDMA<br>
signals via the main antenna 110.<br>
The wireless communications device 100 may also employ the auxiliary antenna 120 as a<br><br>
diversity antenna. The auxiliary antenna 120 may or may not be oriented in the same direction as<br>
the main antenna 110. For example, in a preferred orientation, the auxiliary antenna 120 may be<br>
approximately orthogonal to the main antenna 110. Furthermore, the auxiliary antenna 120 may<br>
or may not extend outside the housing of the wireless communications device 100. If the<br>
wireless communications device 100 determines that the reception of the signal from the first<br>
base station 130 (i.e., the base station that is in two-way communications with the wireless<br>
communications device 100 via the main antenna 110) would be improved if received by the<br>
auxiliary antenna 110, then the wireless communications device 100 can adapt by receiving the<br>
signal through the auxiliary antenna 120 instead of the main antenna 110. Alternatively, the<br>
wireless communications device 100 can adapt by appropriately combining the signal received<br>
via the auxiliary antenna 120 and the signal received via the main antenna 110. In this maimer it<br>
is feasible to sum the desired signals coherently while at the same time suppressing to some<br>
extent unwanted interference.<br>
In addition, the wireless communications device 100 may be configured to receive<br>
location information from a GPS system via the auxiliary mtenna 120. It will be appreciated that<br>
the auxiliary antenna function may be implemented using one or more auxiliary antennas. The<br>
wireless communications device 100 may also access the GPS system periodically, apenodically,<br>
automatically, semi-automatically or manually. Thus, for example, the wireless communications<br>
device 100 can receive GPS data via the auxiliary antenna 120 when a user dials 911 (or some<br>
other emergency string of digits), and subsequently transmit location information via, for<br>
example, the main antenna 110 or the auxiliary antenna 120 to a desired destination via the<br>
wireless communications network. In another example, a base station (e.g., the first base station<br>
130) can request location information from the wireless communications device 100. Upon<br>
receipt of such a request, the wireless communications device 100 can then receive GPS<br>
information via the auxiliary antenna 120 before processing the information and, subsequently,<br>
transmitting location information to the wireless communications network via, for example, the<br>
main antenna 110 or the auxiliary antenna 120. In yet another example, a user of the wireless<br>
communications device 100 can actuate, for example, a special GPS function key on the keypad<br>
of the wireless communications device 100 that results in the wireless communications device<br>
100 receiving and processing GPS data via the auxiliary antenna 120 before, for example,<br>
displaying the location information on a display screen of the wireless communications device<br>
100.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a schematic representation of an exemplary embodiment of an auxiliary<br><br>
reception system 160 according to the present invention. The auxiliary reception system 160 may-<br>
be part of the wireless communications device 100 and may include two auxiliary antennas 120a-<br>
b. For example, the first auxiliary antenna 120a may be a dual band antenna for receiving<br>
cellular or PCS signals and the second auxiliary antenna 120b may be a GPS antenna.<br>
Alternatively, a single auxiliary antenna 120 can be used instead of the two auxiliary antennas<br>
120a-b. The auxiliary reception system 160 also may include a duplexer 170, signal processing<br>
modules 180a-c, a selector module 190, an auxiliary controller 200 or a main controller 210.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 2, a first auxiliary antenna 120a is coupled to the duplexer 170. The<br>
duplexer 170 is coupled to a first signal processing module 180a and to a second signal<br>
processing module 180b. The first signal processing module 180a and the second signal<br>
processing module 180b are each coupled to the selector module 190 and the auxiliary controller<br>
200. A second auxiliary antenna 120b is coupled to a third signal processing module 180c. The<br>
third signal processing module 180c is coupled to the selector module 190 and the auxiliary<br>
controller 200. The selector module 190 is coupled to the auxiliary controller 200 and to the<br>
main controller 210. The auxiliary controller 200 is coupled to the main controller 200.<br>
Other exemplary embodiments may include various levels of integration not illustrated in<br>
FIG. 2. For example, the first auxiliary antenna 120a and the second auxiliary antenna ].20b can<br>
be integrated into a single auxiliary antenna 120. In such an example, a triplexer 175 may be<br>
employed instead of the duplexer 170 as indicated in FIG. 3. In another example, the duplf-xer<br>
170 can split the received communications signal into, for example, cellular band signals and<br>
GPS/PCS band signals as shown in FIG. 4. The latter example may optionally include, for<br>
example, a switching module 185 or additional circuitry in the signal processing module 180c<br>
that tunes the received signal to the GPS band. In such an example, the high pass filter of the<br>
diplexer 165 may be adapted (e.g., lowering the cutoff frequency of the high pass filter) to not<br>
only pass the PCS band, but also the GPS band, with an acceptable level of attenuation.<br>
Alternatively, an adapted duplexer may be used instead of the diplexer 165. Other levels of<br>
integration may be achieved especially such as by combining parts of the signal processing<br>
modules 180b-c such as, for example, circuitry for PCS/GPS mixing or CDMA/GPS IF filtering.<br>
In addition, components illustrated in FIG. 2 can also be used by the circuitry related to the main<br>
antenna 120. For example, the main controller 210 or the selector module 190 may be employed<br>
to cany out conventional functions in receiving or transmitting wireless communications signals<br>
in, for example, the cellular band or the PCS band. Some of these exemplary embodiments will<br>
be further described below.<br><br>
In operation, as illustrated in FIG. 2, the first auxiliary antenna 120a receives cellular or<br>
PCS communications signals. The second auxiliary anteinna 120b receives GPS signals. 'The<br>
duplexer 170 splits the received cellular/PCS signals and filters the signals into cellular band<br>
signals and PCS band signals. The cellular band signals are directed to the first signal processing<br>
module 180a; the PCS band signals are directed to the second signal processing module 180b;<br>
and the GPS signals are directed to the third signal processing module 180c. The first signal<br>
processing module 180a, the second signal processing module 180b and the third signal<br>
processing module 180c amplify and further filter the signals in the cellular band, the PCS band<br>
and the GPS band, respectively. In addition, the first signal processing module 180a, the second<br>
signal processing module 1 SOb and the third signal processing module 180c mix and filter to the<br>
intermediate frequency (IF) band according to selection signals generated by the selector module<br>
190 as controlled by the main controller 210. Subsequently, the first signal processing module<br>
180a, the second signal processing module 180b and the third signal processing module 180c<br>
direct the IF band filtered signals to the auxiliary controller 200.<br>
The auxiliary controller 200 receives low level signals from the signal processing<br>
modules 180a-c and then amplifies the low level signal by an amount set by the auxiliary<br>
automatic gain control (AGC) loop 220 which is controlled by the main controller 210. The<br>
amount set by the auxiliary AGC loop 220 amplifies the low level signals to at least a level such<br>
that, for example, an in-phase and quadrator (IQ) demodulator of the auxiliary controller 200 can<br>
function and such that, for example, the amplified signal falls within the dynamic range of an<br>
analog-to-digital converter (ADC) of the auxiliary controller 200. The digitized information<br>
(e.g., amplitude or phase of time variant signals) is then directed, via data line or bus 230 to the<br>
main controller 210 where the digitized information is further processed.<br>
Accordingly, the wireless communications device 100 may be in two-way<br>
communications with a wireless communications network via the main antenna 100 while<br>
monitoring other channels, bands or modes. For example, in monitoring other channels within<br>
the band being used by the main antenna 100, the main controller 210 may control the selector<br>
module 190 such that the signal processing modules 180a-c selectively filter different channels in<br>
the band. The auxiliary controller 200 via, for example, the auxiliary AGC and the IQ<br>
demodulator, ascertains information (e.g., amplitude or phase parameters) about the signals in the<br>
channels of the band. This ascertained information is then digitized and sent to the main<br>
controller 210. Information about each channel in the band can then be evaluated or compared by<br>
the main controller 210 with, for example, the channel in the band being used by the main<br><br>
antenna 110 in determining whether the main controller 2'.. 0 should, for example, switch the main<br>
antenna 110 to the most effective channel. In another embodiment, the auxiliary reception<br>
system 160 can monitor signals received from other channels in other bands, or signals received<br>
from other modes of wireless communications. Thus, for example, the main controller 210 may<br>
determine that signals from the cellular band are more effective than signals from the PCS band;<br>
or, for example, that signals in CDMA mode are more effective than signals in TDMA mode or<br>
AMPS mode.<br>
Furthermore, the GPS data signal received by the auxiliary controller 200 via the second<br>
auxiliary antenna 120b can be forwarded to the main controller 210. The main controller 210 can<br>
then process the GPS data signal and extract the desired location information. The location<br>
information can be displayed by the main controller 210 on, for example, a display screen of the<br>
wireless communications device 100. The main controller 210 can also transmit the location<br>
information via the main antenna 110 or the auxiliary antenna 120 to a desired destination via, for<br>
example, the wireless communications network. Thus, for example, if an emergency string of<br>
digits such as, for example, 911, is entered on the keypad, the main controller 210 can<br>
automatically transmit location information on the main antenna 110 or the auxiliary antenna 120<br>
to, for example, the other party (e.g., nearest police station) connected as a result of dialing 911.<br>
In another example, the main controller 210 may receive, via the main antenna 110, an inquiry as<br>
to the location of the wireless communications device 100. In response, the main controller 110<br>
may reply by transmitting the location information on the main antenna 110 or the auxiliary<br>
antenna 120 to the inquirer.<br>
In addition, the first auxiliary antenna 120a may provide diversity reception. For<br>
example, the main controller 210 may receive signals from the main antenna 110 in a particular<br>
channel, band or mode. The main controller 210 may determine that the particular channel, band<br>
or mode is more effectively received from the first auxiliary antenna 120a. Accordingly, the<br>
main controller 210 can then switch to receiving the particular channel, band or mode from the<br>
first auxiliary antenna 120a instead of the main antenna 110. Alternatively, the main controller<br>
210 may determine that the particular channel, band or mode is more effectively received by<br>
appropriately combining the signal from the first auxiliary antenna 120a and the signal from :he<br>
main antenna 110.<br>
Just as the first auxiliary antenna 120a may provide auxiliary reception, a third auxiliary<br>
antenna 120c may provide auxiliary transmission. Although not shown in detail in FIG. 2, the<br>
third auxiliary antenna 120c maybe disposed at an angle with respect to the main antenna 110.<br><br>
Accordingly, the transmission characteristics of the third auxiliary antenna 120c may be<br>
advantageous such that main controller 210 routes main transmission through the third auxiliary<br>
antenna 120c instead of the or in combination with the main antenna 110. In addition, the.fhird<br>
auxiliary antenna 120c may be integrated with the first auxiliary antenna 120a.<br>
FIG. 5 shows an exemplary embodiment of the auxiliary reception system 160 and some<br>
components of an exemplary embodiment of a main antenna system 240 according to the present<br>
invention. Only some of the components of the main antenna system 240 are shown since many<br>
of the components of the main antenna system 240 are known to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the main antenna system 240 may include, for example, the<br>
main antenna 110, a cellular/PCS diplexer 250, a PCS duplexer 260, a cellular duplexer 270, a<br>
PCS low noise amplifier (LNA) 280, a cellular LNA 290, a PCS band filter 300, a cellular band<br>
filter 310, a PCS mixer 320, a CDMA mixer 330, an FM mixer 340, a frequency divider 350, a<br>
CDMA IF filter 360, an FM IF filter 370, a main IF' demodulator 380, the main controller 210,<br>
the selector module 190, a first oscillator 390 or a second oscillator 400.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the main antenna system 240 is designed to receive and<br>
transmit communications signals in, for example, at least two bands. Thus, for example, the<br>
main antenna 110 may be a dual band antenna tuned to receive and to transmit cellular or PCS<br>
band communications signals. In addition, FIG. 5 illustrates that some components used in both<br>
the auxiliary reception system 160 and the main antenna system 240 may be combined.<br>
Accordingly, the main controller 210 which may include, for example, a mobile station modem<br>
(MSM), may be used by both the auxiliary reception system 160 and the main antenna system<br>
240. In another example, the selector module 190 may include a combination of, for example, a<br>
single phase locked loop integrated circuit (PLL 1C) 410 fcr the auxiliary reception system 160<br>
and a dual PLL 1C 420 for the main antenna system 240.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 5, the main antenna 110 is coupled to the cellular/PCS diplexer 250.<br>
The cellular/PCS diplexer 250 is coupled to the PCS duplexer 260. The PCS duplexer 260 is<br>
coupled to the PCS LNA 280 via a reception port of the PCS duplexer 260 and to a PCS<br>
transmission chain of components (not shown) on a transmission port of the PCS duplexer 260.<br>
The PCS LNA 2S0 is coupled to the PCS filter 300 which, in turn, is coupled to the PCS mixer<br>
320. The PCS mixer 320 is coupled to the first oscillator 290 which, in trun, is coupled to the<br>
selector module 190 and, in an exemplary embodiment, the first oscillator 390 is coupled to the<br>
dual PLL IC 420 of the selector module 190. The PCS mixer 320 is also coupled to the CDMA<br>
IF filter 360 which, in turn, is coupled to the main IF demodulator 3S0. The main IF demodulator<br><br>
380 is coupled to the selector module 190 via the second oscillator 400 and, in an exemplary<br>
embodiment, the main EF demodulator 380 is coupled to the dual PLL IC 420 via the second<br>
oscillator 400. The main IF demodulator 380 is also coupled to the main controller 210.<br>
Although the wireless communications device may operate in accordance with a<br>
heterodyne system (e.g., superheterodyne receiver system), the wireless communications device<br>
may also or alternatively operate in accordance with other systems such as, for example, a direct<br>
down conversion system.<br>
The cellular/PCS diplexer 250 is also coupled to the cellular duplexer 270. The cellular<br>
duplexer 270 is coupled to the cellular LNA 290 via a reception port of the cellular duplexer 270<br>
and to a cellular transmission chain of components (not shown) via a transmission port of the<br>
cellular duplexer 270. The cellular LNA 290 is coupled to the cellular filter 310 which, in turn, is<br>
coupled to the CMDA mixer 330. The CDMA mixer 330 is coupled to the CDMA IF filter 360<br>
which, in turn, is coupled to the main IF demodulator 380. The CDMA mixer 330 is also<br>
coupled to the first oscillator 390 via the frequency divider 350. The cellular filter 310 is also<br>
coupled to the FM mixer 340. The FM mixer 340 is coupled to the FM IF filter 370 which, in<br>
rum, is coupled to the main IF demodulator 380. The FM mixer 340 is also coupled to the first<br>
oscillator 390 via the frequency divider 350.<br>
In operation, the main antenna 110 may be used to receive and to transmit, for example,<br>
cellular/PCS band signals. Thus, for example, PCS band signals can be received via the main<br>
antenna 110. The cellular/PCS diplexer 250 passes, via an internal high pass filter, the PCS band<br>
signals through the PCS duplexer 260. Via the reception port of the PCS duplexer 260, the signal<br>
is amplified by the PCS LNA 280 before being filtered by the PCS band filter 300 (e.g., an<br>
approximately 1960 MHz band filter). In the PCS mixer 220, the filtered signal is subsequently<br>
mixed with a signal (e.g., single band VCO approximately 2.15 GHz) generated by the first<br>
oscillator 390 as dictated by the selector module 190 and, in an exemplary embodiment, the dual<br>
PLL IC 420. The selector module 190 is controlled by programming stored or executed in the<br>
main controller 210. The CDMA BF filter 360 (e.g., a CDMA approximately 183.6 MHz) then<br>
passes the IF frequencies. The IF' signals received by the main IF demodulator can then be<br>
amplified according to a main receiver AGC loop 430. The main IF demodulator 380 then<br>
demodulates the IF signals using a signal generated by the second oscillator 400 as dictated by<br>
the selector module 190 and digitizes the information which is sent to the main controller 210 via<br>
a line or a bus 440. The information is then further processed by the main controller 210.<br>
A similar path is followed in the cellular branch of the main antenna system 240. Thus,<br><br>
for example, cellular band signals can also be received via the main antenna 110. The<br>
cellular/PCS diplexer 250 passes, via an internal low pass filter, the cellular band signals through<br>
the cellular duplexer 270. Via the reception port of the cellular duplexer 270, the signal is<br>
amplified by the cellular LNA 290 before being filtered by the cellular band filter 310 (e.g., an<br>
approximately 880 MHz band filter).<br>
In the CDMA mixer 330 or the FM mixer 340, the filtered signal is subsequently mixed<br>
with a signal generated by the first oscillator 390 and transformed by the frequency divider 350.<br>
For example, the frequency divider 350 can receive the signal generated by the first oscillator 390<br>
and reduce the frequency of the signal in half before forwarding the transformed signal to the<br>
CMDA mixer 330 and the FM mixer 330. The CDMA mixed signal is then coupled to the<br>
CDMA IF filter 360 before proceeding as described above. In another path, the FM mixed signal<br>
is then filtered by the FM IF filter 370 (e.g., an FM approximately 183.6 MHz filter) before being<br>
coupled to the main IF demodulator 380 before proceeding as described above.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the auxiliary reception system 160 may include, for<br>
example, the first auxiliary antenna 120a, the second auxiliary antenna 120b, the duplexer 170<br>
(e.g., a cellular/PCS duplexer), a cellular LNA 450, a PCS LNA 460, a GPS LNA 470, a cellular<br>
band filter 480, a PCS band filter 490, a GPS band filter 500. a switching module 510, a cellular<br>
CDMA/FM mixer 520, a PCS/GPS mixer 530, a frequency divider 540, a third oscillator 550, an<br>
FM IF filter 560, a CDMA/GPS IF filter 570, the auxiliary controller 200, the second oscillator<br>
400, the selector module 190 or the main controller 210.<br>
In operation, the first auxiliary antenna 120a may be used to receive, for example,<br>
cellular/PCS band signals. Thus, for example, cellular band signals can be received via the first<br>
auxiliary antenna 120a. The cellular/PCS duplexer 170 filters the received signal, band passing<br>
the cellular band signals to the cellular LNA 450 (e.g., an approximately 800 MHz LNA), where<br>
they are amplified. The amplified signal is then filtered by the cellular band filter 480 (e.g., an<br>
approximately 800 MHz band filter). Subsequently, in the cellular CDMA/FM mixer 520, the<br>
filtered signal is mixed with a signal which is generated by the third oscillator 550 and<br>
transformed by the frequency divider 540. The frequency divider 540 may, for example, reduce<br>
by half the frequency of the signal generated by the third oscillator 540. The signal generated by<br>
the third oscillator 550 is dictated by the selector module 190 and, in an exemplary embodiment,<br>
the single PLL IC 420 for auxiliary reception. The selector module 190 is controlled by<br>
programming stored or executed in the main controller 210. The mixed signal is then sent to FM<br>
IF filter 560 and the CDMA/GPS IF filter 570. The FM Dr filter 560 filters out the FM signals<br><br>
and passes them to the auxiliary controller 200. The CDMA/GPS IF filter 570 passes only<br>
CDMA or GPS signals of interest to the auxiliary controller 200. The auxiliary controller 200<br>
may include, for example, an auxiliary diversity/watch IF demodulator. The auxiliary controller<br>
200 amplifies the filtered signal to a level as set by the auxiliary AGC loop 220. The amplified<br>
signal then can be, for example, demodulated with a signal generated by the second oscillator 400<br>
which, itself, is controlled by the selector module 190 and, in an exemplary embodiment, is<br>
controlled by the dual PLL IC 420 The amplified signal is then digitized by, for example, an<br>
ADC in the auxiliary controller 200. The digitized signal can then be sent to the main controller<br>
210 for further processing.<br>
PCS band signals can also be received via the first auxiliary antenna 120a. The<br>
cellular/PCS duplexer 170 filters the received signal, banc, passing the PCS band signals to the<br>
PCS LNA 460 (e.g., an approximately 1960 MHz LNA), where they are amplified. The<br>
amplified signal is then filtered by the PCS band filter 480 (e.g., an approximately 800 MHz band<br>
filter). In an exemplary embodiment, the filtered signal passes through the switching module<br>
510. The switching module 510 connects either the PCS band signals or the GPS band signals to<br>
the PCS/GPS mixer 530. The switching module 510 can be controlled, for example, by the main<br>
controller 210. Subsequently, in the PCS/GPS mixer 530, the filtered signal is mixed with a<br>
signal which is generated by the third oscillator 550. The mixed signal is then sent to FM IF<br>
filter 560 and the CDMA/GPS IF filter 570. The signal is then further processed as described<br>
above.<br>
GPS signals may be received, for example, in the second antenna 120b or via a single<br>
antenna 120. As illustrated in FIG. 5, GPS signals are received by the second antenna 120b and<br>
amplified by the GPS LNA 470, before being filtered by the GPS band filter 500. The filtered<br>
signal passes through the switching module 510 to the PCS/GPS mixer 530. The PCS/GPS<br>
mixer 530 mixes the filtered signal with a signal generated by the third oscillator 550. before<br>
being filtered by the CDMA/GPS IF filter 570. The GPS signal is then amplified and processed<br>
in the auxiliary controller 200 before being further processed in the main controller 210.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the main antenna system 240 gives priority to two-way<br>
communications with a wireless communications network. However, while the wireless<br>
communications device 100 is in two-way communications, the wireless communications device<br>
100 can assign a lower priority to scanning other channels, bands or modes via the first auxiliary<br>
antenna 120a. A scanning order for channels, bands or modes is determined by the main<br>
controller 210 via, for example, a list stored in a memory of the main controller 210. The<br><br>
scanning is achieved, for example, by the selector module 190 as controlled by the main<br>
controller 210. Decisions as to which channels, bands or modes to scan can also be determined<br>
in light of information received via the line or bus 230. If the main controller 210 determines that<br>
there is a much better channel, band or mode available, the main controller 210 can switch the<br>
main antenna system 240 to the better channel, band or mode. Such scanning can occur, for<br>
example, at periodic intervals or as a function of a triggering condition such as, for example,<br>
reaching a threshold signal strength.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment, the main controller 210 may monitor the particular<br>
channel, band or mode that is in use by the main antenna 1'.. 0 and have the first auxiliary antenna<br>
120a receive the same signal at the same particular channel, band or mode as the main antenna<br>
110. The auxiliary antenna 120a, which may be in a different orientation than the main antenna<br>
110, may be more effective at receiving the signal for the particular channel, band or mode than<br>
the main antenna 110. As a result, the main controller 210 may switch the reception tasks from<br>
the main antenna 110 to the auxiliary antenna 120a Alternatively, the main controller 210 may<br>
use the signals received from both the first auxiliary antenna 120a and the main antenna 110 in<br>
creating a composite signal that may be, for example, of greater strength or clarity.<br>
Furthermore, the main controller 210 can receive GPS signals via the second auxiliary<br>
antenna 120b or the auxiliary antenna 120, if there is only one auxiliary antenna. The GPS<br>
signals can be processed and the location information can be displayed or transmitted via, for<br>
example, the main antenna 110 or the auxiliary antenna 120 as has been described above.<br>
Thus, it is seen that systems and methods for providing auxiliary reception in wireless<br>
communications systems are provided. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the present<br>
invention can be practiced by other than the preferred embodiments which are presented in this<br>
description for purposes of illustration and not of limitation, and the present invention is limited<br>
