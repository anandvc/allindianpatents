HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
WO 2005/095572	PCT/EP2005/001172<br>
SOLID LAUNDRY DETERGENTS<br>
WITH POLYANIONIC AMMONIUM SURFACTANT<br>
5<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to solid laundry detergent <br>
10  	 compositions comprising a polyanionic ammonium surfactant.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
15<br>
Despite numerous laundry detergent products on the market, a<br>
continuous consumer need exists for improved performance,<br>
especially if such can be achieved at a lower cost.<br>
20  	Specifically, consumers look for improved soil removal and improved whiteness and brightness, without having to pay a premium for such benefits.  Polyamines, such as tetraethylene pentamine ("TEPA"), are known in petroleum production and refining operations as corrosion inhibitors,<br>
25  demulsifiers, neutralizers, and functional additives. Laundry applications use modified polyamines.  See for instance, WO 00/63334, EP 137 615, US Patent 5,669,984, US Patent 4,664,848, WO 99/49009, US Patent 6,121,226, US Patent 4,622,378, and US Patent 4,597,898.  Some of these<br>
30  documents describe detergent compositions which also<br>
incorporate anionic surfactants or fatty acids, or anionic surfactant precursors, in the presence also of strong caustic agents which are added to produce anionic surfactants from anionic surfactant acid precursors or fatty<br>
35  acid salts from fatty acids.  The present invention is based<br><br>
WO 2005/095572	PCT/EP2005/001172<br>
-   2   -<br>
at least in part on the discovery that polyanionic ammonium surfactants (PAAS) employed in the present invention exhibit different characteristics and perform substantially better at soil removal than physical mixtures of anionic <br>
5  surfactants/fatty acids and polyamines.  The present<br>
invention is also based at least in part on the discovery that polyanionic ammonium surfactants may be formulated into granules with improved properties, including solubility. The present invention is further based at least in part on <br>
10 the discovery that PAAS may be incorporated into a powder detergent composition containing high level of an alkaline ingredient with pKa greater than or equal to 10.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
15<br>
The present invention includes a solid laundry detergent composition comprising granules, the granules comprising:<br>
20<br>
25<br>
(a)	from about 0.1% to about 80%, by weight of the composition, of a polyanionic ammonium surfactant;<br>
(b)	from about 0.2% to about 40%, by weight of the composition, of a solid acid;<br>
(c)	from about 1% to about 85%, by weight of the composition, of an ingredient selected from the group consisting of bicarbonate, carbonate, per carbonate and mixtures thereof.<br>
The PAAS granules may be used as an adjunct or as a whole formulated powder detergent. 30<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Except in the operating and comparative examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this <br>
5		description indicating amounts of material or conditions of 	reaction, physical properties of materials and/or use are to 	be understood as modified by the word "about." All amounts 	are by weight of the liquid detergent composition, unless 	otherwise specified. <br>
10<br>
It should be noted that in specifying any range of concentration, any particular upper concentration can be associated with any particular lower concentration.<br>
15  	For the avoidance of doubt the word "comprising" is intended to mean "including" but not necessarily "consisting of" or "composed of."  In other words, the listed steps or options need not be exhaustive.<br>
20  	POLYANIONIC AMMONIUM SURFACTANT ("PAAS")<br>
The polyanionic ammonium surfactants suitable for use herein contain units having the structure formula:<br>
25<br><br>

Where  R is   selected from hydrogen,   linear  or branched C1-C4 alkyl,   C7-C12 Alkylaryl,   C2-C12  alkylene,   C3-C12<br>
hydroxyalkylene,   C4-C12  dihydroxyalkylene,   C8-C12 Dialkylarylene,   and<br><br><br>
where m and v are in the range of 0 to 4 and the sum of u and v are between 1 and 4.  Ri is selected from hydrogen,<br>

Alkylene, C3-C12 hydroxyalkylene, C4-C12 dihydroxyalkylene<br>
and C8-C12 Dialkylarylene;<br>
R2 is selected from Rl and amine oxide;<br>
15<br>
R' is a linking connecting the nitrogen atoms of the backbone.  R' units are selected from C2-C12 alkylene, C4-C12<br>
alkenylene, C3-C12 hydroxyalkylene wherein the hydroxyl<br>
moiety may take any position on the R' unit chain except the 20  carbon atoms directly connected to the polyamine backbone<br>

moieties may occupy any two of the carbon atoms of the R' unit chain except those carbon atoms directly connected to<br>
the backbone nitrogen.  The values of a, p, and y are between<br>
25  0 to 10 and the sum of a  and Î² is greater than or equal to<br><br>

1. The total number of amine groups for the present invention is between 2 to 10.<br>
S-	is a conjugated base of anionic surfactant acid (S- âH+ ) <br>
5  	with a HLB number in the range of 2 to 45. S- may be expressed as<br>
R3-L-<br>
10  Where R3 is selected from straight or branched C6-C22 alkyl, C6-C22 Alkylene, C6-C22 polyoxyalkylenealkyl, C6-C22 polyoxyalkylenatacyl, C6-C22 alkylaryl, Rosin derivatives, C6-C22 N-acylalkyl; C6-C22 a-sulfonatedtalkyl, C6-C22<br>

Where L- is selected from COO- , SO3- , OSO3- r   phosphoric acid, phosphorous acid, amino acids, aromatic carboxylic acid, sugar base acids derived from oxidation of monosaccharides and polysaccharides.<br>
20<br>
The preferred PAAS in the inventive compositions is selected from polyanionic ammonium alkyl benzene sulfonate, polyanionic ammonium alkyl sulfate, polyanionic ammonium fatty acid salt, polyanionic ammonium alkyl polyalkoxy<br>
25  sulfate and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
WO 2005/095572<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/001172<br><br>
-   6   -<br>
The amount of PAAS employed in the inventive compositions is in the range of from 0.1% to 80%, preferably from 1% to 40%, most preferably from 5% to 20%.<br>
5  PAAS can be prepared by reacting a polyamine with the conjugate acid of an anionic surfactant, e.g. LAS acid, fatty acid, LES acid and others.<br>
PAAS has a limited solubility in water, so PAAS granules<br>
 10  would have a limited solubility in a washing machine.  The present 	inventors discovered that PAAS can be co-formulated with a solid 	acid and a carbonate-type base, so that when the granule comes into 	contact with water in the washing machine, a reaction between the 	acid and the carbonate<br>
15  	produces CO2, which facilitates the break-down of the<br>
granules, which in turn promotes the dispersion and/or dissolution of the inventive granules.<br>
	It was previously believed that a polyanionic ammonium <br>
20	surfactant (PAAS) cannot co-exist with a strong base (other than 	polyamine bases) because the ion-pair nature of PAAS would be broken 	and replaced by a strong base. Since carbonate is a strong base, it 	is surprising that a granule containing PAAS and carbonate can be 	manufactured. <br>
25<br>
SOLID ACID<br>
	Suitable solid acids include but are not limited to citric acid, 	tartaric acid, aspartic acid, itaconic acid, D(+)-30  Malic acid, 2-	oxoglutaric acid, dimethylmalonic acid,<br><br>
WO 2005/095572<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/001172<br><br>
-  7   -<br>
aconitic acid,  succinic acid, maleic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid.<br>
The preferred solid acids are selected from the group <br>
5  consisting of citric acid and aspartic acid due to their 	non-irritancy.<br>
The most preferred solid acid is citric acid due to its low cost, availability and additional function as a builder.<br>
10<br>
The solid acid is included in the inventive compositions in an amount of from 0.2% to 40%, preferably from 1% to 20%, most preferably from 2% to 10%.  This amount does not include any bound water.<br>
15<br>
CARBONATE/BICARBONATE/PERCARBONATE<br>
	An ingredient selected from the group consisting of 	carbonate, bicarbonate, percarbonate, and mixtures thereof 20  	is included in the present compositions to obtain<br>
	effervescence, when carbonate/bicarbonate/percarbonate 	reacts with the solid acid, in an aqueous environment of the 	washing machine.<br>
25  	Suitable ingredients include but are not limited to the lithium, sodium and potassium salts of carbonate/bicarbonate/percarbonate. The most preferred ingredients are sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate due to their low cost and availability.<br><br>
WO 2005/095572<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/001172<br><br>
-   8   -<br>
The carbonate/bicarbonate/percarbonate is included in the inventive compositions in an amount of from 1 to 85%, preferably from 5 to 40%, most preferably from 10 to 25%.<br>
5  The amount of carbonate/bicarbonate/percarbonate referred to herein does not include bound water.<br>
PROCESS OF MAKING<br>
10  The inventive process includes contacting a polyamine and a conjugate acid of an anionic surfactant, preferably in the absence or in substantial absence of free water.  The resulting PAAS may be purified, for further use in the inventive compositions.  The PAAS is granulated with the<br>
15  solid acid and the carbonate/bicarbonate/percarbonate, in the substantial absence of water.<br>
	In the preferred process, the reaction product containing 	PAAS 	is used as is (without isolating the PAAS) in a 	further<br>
20	step of making the granule.  The absence or substantial 	absence of water ensures that when the reaction product, 	containing PAAS surfactant, is contacted with the 	carbonate/bicarbonate/percarbonate, the ion-pair nature of 	PAAS would not be broken and replaced by carbonate, <br>
25  resulting in destruction of PAAS.  Furthermore, the<br>
	substantial absence of water ensures that the reaction 	between the solid acid and the carbonate/bicarbonate/ 	percarbonate does not take place, prior to the use in 	the washing machine.  In the most preferred process, a non-<br>
30  	aqueous binder (most preferably the one that also acts as<br><br>
WO 2005/095572<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/001172<br><br>
-   9   -<br>
PAAS solubiliser) and/or a solubilizer for PAAS, is included in the reaction mixture used for making the PAAS.<br>
	"Substantially non-aqueous" as used herein means at most <br>
5  	10%, preferably less than 5%, more preferably less than 1%, 	and optimally less than 0.5% of water.  The amount of water 	referred to herein includes bound water.<br>
	Typically, 100% of a conjugate acid of an anionic surfactant 10  	is employed. The polyamine is employed in the amount of from 	about 10% to about 50%, preferably from 15% to 45%, most 	preferably from 20% to 40%, of the molar equivalent of the 	amount of the conjugate acid of a polyamine during the 	formation of PASS.  Additional polyamine or other nitrogen 15  	based bases may be added after the formation of PAAS.<br>
A preferred process includes first preparing a main mix by mixing propylene glycol, nonionic surfactants and anionic surfactant acids, including fatty acid. A polyamine, e.g.<br>
20  	TEPA (tetraethylenepentamine) is then added to the main mix. Mixing is continued until both acids are fully dispersed and consumed.  Nonionic surfactant may be added before, during or after the addition of anionic surfactant acids. Optionally, other surfactant/ solubiliser, e.g. alkyl ether<br>
25  	sulfate salt, is then added to the main mix and the mixing is continued so as to form a homogeneous solution, which contains the PAAS and which serves as a binder.<br>
Any known granulation process may be used for preparing PAAS 30  	granules. One of the preferred routes is to charge<br>
	carbonate/bicarbonate/percarbonate, a solid acid and other<br><br>
WO 2005/095572<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/00H72<br><br>
-   10   -<br>
optional solid ingredients to a high shear mixer, followed by PAAS-containing binder.  The ingredients are granulated at a high shear until the desired particle size is obtained. In general it takes about 0.5 to 5 minutes depending on the<br>
 5  	shear and the liquid binder to solid ratio.  A layering<br>
agent, e.g. zeolite, may be added to enhance the flow ability and reduce the tendency of caking.<br>
The other preferred route is to first charge <br>
10  	carbonate/bicarbonate/percarbonate, a solid acid, and<br>
optional solid ingredients to a low to medium shear mixer,<br>
such as a rolling drum granulator, a fluidized bed<br>
granulator, or a pan granulator, A layering agent, e.g.<br>
zeolite, may be added to enhance the flow ability and reduce 15  	the tendency of caking.  PAAS-containing binder is then<br>
sprayed-on or dripped onto the powder while the drum or pan<br>
is rotating or the bed is fluidized.<br>
OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS<br>
20<br>
The inventive compositions may include non-neutralized polyamine and alkyl benzene sulfonate salts and/or alkyl sulfate salts and/or fatty acid salts, in addition to the PAAS surfactant of the present invention.<br>
25<br>
NON-AQUEOUS OR SUBSTANTIALLY FREE OF WATER BINDER<br>
	A non-aqueous or substantially free of water binder is a 	water-dissolvable/water dispersible liquid or a liquifiable 30  	ingredient, and is generally selected from surfactants,<br>
	solvents, and polymers.  A liquid surfactant such as non-<br><br>
WO 2005/095572<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/001172<br><br>
-   11   -<br>
ionic surfactant is preferred.  Other surfactants, such as anionic surfactants and cationic surfactants, which are solid at room temperature, may be used in conjunction with a liquid surfactant or a solvent to form a binder.  A solvent, <br>
5  	such as propylene glycol, glycerol, and low molecular weight fatty alcohol and polyethylene glycol (PEG) can be used to modify the binder rheology for the ease of granulation.  A polymer, such as high molecular weight PEG, may be incorporated in a molten form or pre-dissolved in a solvent <br>
10  and used as a binder during the granulation.<br>
The manufacture of PAAS or other anionic surfactants may be used as forming of a binder in-situ via a single stage or two-stage process.  For the single stage in-situ process, a<br>
15  	conjugate acid of selected anionic surfactant, used as a binder and a reactant, is added or preferably sprayed onto the solid ingredients, which includes at least one alkaline ingredient, during the granulation.  The resultant anionic surfactant serves as a binder.  The two-stage in-situ<br>
20  	forming anionic surfactant is suitable for forming PAAS. For the two-stage method, a conjugate acid of selected anionic surfactant is either co-added or premixed in-situ with a selected base, e.g., TEPA, prior to the addition to a granulator.  The freshly formed anionic surfactant is at<br>
25  	high temperature and is mobile, thus can be easily dispersed and serves as a binder.<br>
SOLUBILIZER<br>
30  	The inventive compositions preferably include an additional solubilizer for PAAS.  The solubilizer is selected from the<br><br>
WO 2005/095572<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/001172<br><br>
-   12   -<br>
group consisting of liquid surfactants, solvents (such as propylene glycol, glycerin, and ethanol), and the mixture of them, and is preferably selected from nonionic surfactants (such as C8-C18 Alkane with 5-15 EO groups) and/or alkyl <br>
5  	polyethoxy sulfate, due to their ability to help in the formation of the mixed micelles while having great solubilizing ability.  In general, these solubilizers may be also be used as a binder.<br>
10  	The preferred ratio of solubilizer to PAAS is 1:10,<br>
generally in the range of from 1:10 to 10:1, by weight percentage; preferably in the range of from 1:5 to 5:1, and most preferably from 1:2 to 2:1.  However, PAAS can also be dispersed or dispensed in a liquid detergent medium,<br>
15   therefore no additional solubilizer in addition to the<br>
surfactants used in the composition is needed to obtain the cleaning performance.<br>
ADDITIONAL SURFACTANT <br>
20<br>
The compositions of the invention may, but do not have to<br>
contain additional surface active agents selected from the<br>
group consisting of anionic, nonionic, cationic, ampholytic<br>
and zwitterionic surfactants or mixtures thereof.  The<br>
25  preferred surfactant detergents for use in the present<br>
invention are mixtures of anionic and nonionic surfactants although it is to be understood that any surfactant may be used alone or in combination with any other surfactant or surfactants.<br>

Anionic surface active agents which may be used in the present invention are those surface active compounds which contain a long chain hydrocarbon hydrophobic group in their molecular structure and a hydrophilic group, i.e. water<br>
5  	solubilizing group such as carboxylate, sulfonate or sulfate group or their corresponding acid form.  The anionic surface active agents include the alkali metal (e.g. sodium and potassium) and nitrogen based bases (e.g. mono-amines and polyamines) salts of water soluble higher alkyl aryl<br>
10  	sulfonates, alkyl sulfonates, alkyl sulfates and the alkyl poly ether sulfates.  They may also include fatty acid or fatty acid soaps.  One of the preferred groups of mono-anionic surface active agents are the alkali metal, ammonium or alkanolamine salts of higher alkyl aryl sulfonates and<br>
15  		alkali metal, ammonium or alkanolamine salts of higher alkyl sulfates or the mono-anionic polyamine salts.  Preferred higher alkyl sulfates are those in which the alkyl groups contain 8 to 26 carbon atoms, preferably 12 to 22 carbon atoms and more preferably 14 to 18 carbon atoms.  The alkyl<br>
20 	group in the alkyl aryl sulfonate preferably contains 8 to 16 carbon atoms and more preferably 10 to 15 carbon atoms. A particularly preferred alkyl aryl sulfonate is the sodium,<br>
potassium or ethanolamine C10 to C16  benzene sulfonate, e.g.<br>
sodium linear dodecyl benzene sulfonate.  The primary and <br>
25	secondary alkyl sulfates can be made by reacting long chain olefins with sulfites or bisulfites, e.g. sodium bisulfite. The alkyl sulfonates can also be made by reacting long chain normal paraffin hydrocarbons with sulfur dioxide and oxygen as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,503,280, 2,507,088, <br>
30  	3,372,188 and 3,260,741 to obtain normal or secondary higher alkyl sulfates suitable for use as surfactant detergents.<br><br>

-   14   -<br>
The alkyl substituent is preferably linear, i.e. normal alkyl, however, branched chain alkyl sulfonates can be employed, although they are not as good with respect to biodegradability.  The alkane, i.e. alkyl, substituent may <br>
5		be terminally sulfonated or may be joined, for example, to the 	2-carbon atom of the chain, i.e. may be a secondary sulfonate.  	It is understood in the art that the substituent may be joined 	to any carbon on the alkyl chain.  The higher alkyl sulfonates 	can be used as the alkali metal salts, such <br>
10  	as sodium and potassium.  The preferred salts are the sodium<br>
salts.  The preferred alkyl sulfonates are the Cio to Ci8<br>
primary normal alkyl sodium and potassium sulfonates, with<br>
the Cio to C15 primary normal alkyl sulfonate salt being more<br>
preferred.<br>
15<br>
Mixtures of higher alkyl benzene sulfonates and higher alkyl sulfates can be used as well as mixtures of higher alkyl benzene sulfonates and higher alkyl polyether sulfates.<br>
20  The alkali metal or ethanolamine sulfate can be used in<br>
admixture with the alkyl benzene sulfonate in an amount of 0 to 70%, preferably 5 to 50% by weight.<br>

15  	Nonionic Surfactant<br>
Nonionic surfactants which can be used with the invention, alone or in combination with other surfactants are described below.<br>
20<br>
As is well known, the nonionic surfactants are characterized by the presence of a hydrophobic group and an organic hydrophilic group and are typically produced by the condensation of an organic aliphatic or alkyl aromatic<br>
25  	hydrophobic compound with ethylene oxide (hydrophilic in nature).  Typical suitable nonionic surfactants are those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,316,812 and 3,630,929. Usually, the nonionic surfactants are polyalkoxylated lipophiles wherein the desired hydrophile-lipophile balance<br>
30  	is obtained from addition of a hydrophilic poly-alkoxy group to a lipophilic moiety.  A preferred class of nonionic<br><br>

5  EXAMPLE 1 AND COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1A<br>
This example demonstrates one of the differences in one of the physical properties (water solubility) between PAAS surfactant employed in the present invention and TEPA and <br>
10  Na-LAS mixtures in the prior art.<br>
In Example 1, when LAS acid was  neutralized with a polyamine (i.e., TEPA), it formed PAAS.  As PAAS began forming, the solution became hazy.  Upon further addition of the LAS <br>
15  	acid, the hazy solution became a dispersion.  Upon standing for hours, the dispersion formed a layer of sediment at the bottom of the beaker.  Even a very diluted formulation (such as below 0.1%) was hazy.<br>
20  	TEPA has multiple nitrogen sites.  Without wishing to be limited by this theory, it is believed that upon continued addition of LAS acid, the PAAS formed different compounds and gave different assemblies.  At the beginning of addition of LAS acid, only single nitrogen atom was protonated,<br>
25  	forming a micellar solution, which is a clear solution..<br>
Upon the addition of more LAS acid, multiple nitrogen atoms were protonated.  PAAS eventually precipitated from the solution because of the lack of ionization of the PAAS due to the strong ion-bond formation between LAS and TEPA and<br>

In Example 1A the behaviour was completely different: Na-LAS solution with added TEPA gave a clear solution throughout the titration of LAS acid and remained clear upon addition of TEPA.<br>

The solution was clear at the all time over the entire pH range, leading to the conclusion that Na-LAS was fully ionized or disassociated.  The clarity of solution did not change upon the addition of TEPA for the pH from 2.5 to <br>
10  	10.0.  It indicates that the addition of TEPA does not convert Na-LAS to PAAS.<br>
This means that PAAS formed much stronger assemblies than Na-LAS and TEPA. physical mixture.  PAAS could not be <br>

Example 2 demonstrates that PAAS surfactant is a strongly <br>

Other salts.  Sodium xylenesulfonate was added to an aqueous PAAS dispersion to attempt to solubilize PAAS by ion-exchange and/or hydrotrope mechanism.  The results that were obtained are summarized in Table 2. <br>

The PAAS granules were prepared by charging sodium bicarbonate, citric acid and the half of the amount of zeolite into a granulator, Black and Decker Model SC400 2-<br>
20  speed super chopper.  This was followed by the addition of<br>
LAS acid and TEPA mixture, which was at the initial stage of the reaction and still maintained its mobility. Right after the addition of LAS acid and TEPA, the granulator was run at high speed for 90 seconds to form granules.  Neodol 25-7 was<br><br>

The resulting granules were tested for disintegratability and dissolution by adding 0.5g of granules to 1-liter cold<br>
10  water (170C).  The granules first sunk to the bottom and<br>
then effervesced and floated to the top.  In less than 90 seconds the granules were fully disintegrated and dissolved, even without agitation.<br>
15  COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 5<br><br>
20<br><br>
This example demonstrates that the inventive granule must contain all three ingredients: the PAAS, the acid, and the base.  If the ingredients reside in separate granules, PAAS solubility is not improved.<br><br>

LAS acid and TEPA were mixed in-situ and forced through a nozzle to form PAAS granules with size about 1500 microns. All the rest ingredients were charged to a granulator and mixed at the high speed for 45 seconds.  The resulting <br>
5  	separate granules then blended with the PAAS granules using a V-shape blender.  After 10 minutes, the PAAS granules still not fully dissolved via the test method described in Example 4.  It is believed that although there was still<br>
effervescence, the generation of CO2 did not break-up PAAS<br>
10  	granules, thus the dissolution rate was very low.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
The PAAS granules of Example 6 were prepared by charging 90%<br>
15  of zeolite and TEPA into a granulator and mixed for 10<br>
seconds at high speed.  This was followed by charging LAS acid and mixed for 25 seconds to promote the formation of PAAS at the surface of zeolite particles, without forming granules.  Sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and citric <br>
20  acid were then added and mixed for 60 seconds to form<br>
granules.  Finally, the rest of the zeolite was added and mixed at low speed for 10 seconds as a layering agent.  The granules were passed through 1.5 mm screen.<br><br>
