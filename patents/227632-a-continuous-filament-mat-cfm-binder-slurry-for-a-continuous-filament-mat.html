				<td>CONTINUOUS FILAMENT MAT BINDER SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD AND INDUSTRIAL<br>
APPLICABILITY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to continuous filament mats and more<br>
specifically to a binder system for a continuous filament mat.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Continuous filament mats are widely known and are used as one component in<br>
fiber reinforced composite parts.<br>
To make a fiber reinforced phenolic resin part having a continuous filament mat,<br>
the continuous filament mat must first be produced. Traditionally, the continuous fiber<br>
mat is produced by first introducing a sizing to the continuous glass fiber by known<br>
methods. A polyester binder system is then introduced to the sized fiber using a curtain<br>
coater or some similar technique to flood the glass fiber. The flooded sized fiber is then<br>
dried in an oven to form the continuous filament mat. The mat and a glass roving(s) are<br>
then subsequently wetted with a phenolic resin, typically by running the mat and roving<br>
through a phenolic resin bath. The wetted mat and glass roving are then introduced into a<br>
heated pultrusion die. The die shapes the mat and glass roving into a resin/glass composite<br>
that is then cured to form a pultruded part..<br>
One problem with known methods is that the polyester binder materials used to<br>
form the continuous filament mats are not fully compatible with the phenolic resins that<br>
form the resin matrix. This affects the performance of the composite part.<br>
It is thus highly desirable to make a binder system that is fully compatible with the<br>
phenolic resin bath, thereby forming fiber reinforced phenolic resin composite parts having<br>
potentially superior performance characteristics.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One object of the invention is to make a binder system that is fully compatible with<br>
the phenolic resin bath, thereby forming fiber reinforced phenolic resin composite part<br>
having potentially superior performance characteristics.<br>
The present invention uses a powdered bisphenol epoxy with a thermally active<br>
crosslinking agent (dicyandiamide) dispersed into a flooding liquid preferably having a<br>
non-ionic surfactant, a silane, a defoaming agent, and water. An organic acid is also added<br>
for pH control. The powder binder and flooding liquid act as a system to bind the<br>
multiplicity of glass fibers into a mat. As the powdered bisphenol epoxy and thermally<br>
active crosslinking agent are compatible with the phenolic resin, as compared with<br>
traditional unsaturated polyester binder systems which are not compatible, pultruded parts<br>
having improved performance characteristics are realized.<br>
In addition, the continuous filament mat formed in the above process could also be<br>
used in an epoxy application using a prepreg type process to form a laminate material that<br>
could be subsequently press molded to form a composite laminate part.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon<br>
considering the following detailed description and appended claims, and upon reference to<br>
the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of a process for making a continuous filament mat<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram for making a pultruded composite part from the<br>
continuous filament mat of Fig. 1 according to a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention; and<br>
Fig. 3 is a schematic diagram for making an epoxy prepreg tape from the<br>
continuous filament mat of Fig. 1 according to another preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring now to Fig. 1, a preferred assembly process for forming a continuous<br>
filament mat 50 is generally shown as 10. One or more strands of a continuous filament<br>
fiber 12 are formed in a furnace 14 by melting a quantity of glass or other reinforcing<br>
material, typically in the form of marbles, in a manner that is well known in the art. A<br>
sizing composition 18 is introduced to the one or more strands of fiber 12. The sizing<br>
composition 18 preferably contains a phenolic compatible silane and a lubricant that is<br>
introduced to the fiber 12 by roll application, dipping, flooding or by any other method that<br>
is known in the art. A preferred composition of the sizing composition 18 is listed below<br>
in Table 1.<br>
The sized fibers 12 are then formed together into one continuous strand 13 by a<br>
pair of pulleys 14A and 14B. The continuous strand 13 may also be split into a multiple<br>
number of bundles or splits (n=2-30), and is hereinafter referred to as continuous strand 13<br>
for ease of description. The continuous strand 13 is placed onto a moving belt 16. The<br>
continuous strand 13 is then moved along the moving belt 16 and flooded with continuous<br>
filament mat ("CFM") binder slurry 24. The CFM binder slurry 24 comprises a powdered<br>
polymer binder material with a thermally active cross-linking agent dispersed in water<br>
with a small percentage of phenolic compatible silane. An antifoaming agent and<br>
dispersant are also typically added to the slurry. A preferred composition of the slurry is<br>
listed below in Table 2.<br>
The CFM binder slurry 24 that is formed is then delivered from a sump tank 26 to a<br>
curtain coater 28 wherein the mixture floods the continuous strand 13. The excess liquid is<br>
removed from the strand 13 by suction. The strands 13 are then transferred to an oven 15<br>
for moisture removal and curing and then pressed in a plurality of presses 16 to form a<br>
binded filament mat 50. Preferably, the oven 15 is set between approximately 450-520<br>
degrees Fahrenheit. Upon exiting, the binded filament mats 50 are then slit by a slitter 30,<br>
cut to a preferred size by a cutter 32, and rolled onto a cardboard tube 34. The binded<br>
filament mats 50 rolled onto the cardboard tube 34 are loaded with the CFM binder in a<br>
range of 4-8% of the dry total weight of the binder and matting.<br>
The binded mats 50 that are formed above are then available to be combined with a<br>
plurality of glass rovings 52 to form a composite phenolic pultruded part 60. This is<br>
depicted in Fig. 2. First, the mats 50 and a plurality of glass rovings 52 are dipped through<br>
a phenolic bath 54. The phenolic bath 54 that is used is well known in the art and is<br>
compatible with the mats 50 having the CFM binder. For example, one preferred phenolic<br>
pultrusion resin for use in the phenolic pultrusion bath 30 is Georgia Pacific's 289D17<br>
phenolic resin.<br>
The mats 50 and rovings 52 are then introduced into a heated pultrusion die 56.<br>
The heated pultrusion die 56 cures the resin/glass composite into composite part 60. The<br>
time and temperature within the heated pultrusion die 56 are to ensure that the composite<br>
part 60 formed is fully cured. Preferably, the temperature within the heated pultrusion die<br>
56 is between approximately 375 and 450 degrees Fahrenheit and the time is sufficient to<br>
ensure a fully cured part.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the phenolic bath 54 may be replaced with a<br>
urethane bath. The urethane resin composition, like the phenolic resin composition, is<br>
compatible with the CFM binder contained within the mat 50. A known urethane system<br>
useful in pulrrusion includes the Dow Fulcrum technology<br>
http://www.dow.com/fulcrum/lit.htm, available from Dow Chemical of Midland, MI. The<br>
curing temperature for the urethane composite part formed within the heated pulrrusion die<br>
56 is typically lower than that of the phenolic composite part 56, with preferred<br>
temperatures between approximately 250 and 350 degrees Fahrenheit.<br>
In an alternative preferred embodiment, as shown in Fig. 3, an epoxy type prepreg<br>
70 may be produced from the mats 50 formed above. In this process, the fibers 12 are run<br>
through the sizing composition 18 and the CFM slurry bath 24 to form the binded mat 50<br>
as described above in Fig. 1. The mats 50 are then dipped in an epoxy bath 62 and<br>
prestaged in an oven 64 to form the epoxy prepreg 70. Preferably, the oven 64 is set for<br>
between 300 and 400 degrees Fahrenheit and the line speed is set sufficient to cure the<br>
epoxy prepreg, typically around 5-10 minutes. The layers of the epoxy prepreg 70 are then<br>
pressed together in a press 66 to form a composite part 72. This composite part 72 may be<br>
used in a wide variety of applications such as electrical laminates that are well known in<br>
the art.<br>
One preferred example of an epoxy bath 62 that may be used in the present<br>
invention is discussed in Tables 1 and 2 of G.A. Hunter's 1988 Article "Pultrudihg Epoxy<br>
Resin", presented at the 43rd Annual Conference sponsored by The Society of Plastics<br>
Industry, Inc., which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Mat and Roving Material<br>
The mat 50 material is preferably a continuous filament glass fiber material. This<br>
may include s-type glass fibers or e-type glass fibers, and other commercially available<br>
glass fibers that are well known in the art. In the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, e-type glass is used.<br>
The roving 52 material is also preferably a continuous filament glass fiber material.<br>
This may include s-type glass fibers or e-type glass fibers, and other commercially<br>
available glass fibers that are well known in the art. In the preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, e-type glass is used. In addition, the method for making the glass roving<br>
material may include any method that is well known in the art.<br>
Sizing composition<br>
The sizing composition 18 is made by mixing a phenolic compatible silane in<br>
water. The pH of the resultant mixture is then adjusted to between 4 and 6 by adding an<br>
acid such as acetic acid. One preferred silane that may be used is a gamma-aminopropyl<br>
trimethoxy silane such as Witco-OSI's A-l 100. At least one lubricant is added to the<br>
resultant mixture and the pH is once again adjusted to between 4 and 6 using acetic acid.<br>
Two preferred lubricants are Cirrosol 185AE and 185AN, each manufactured by ICI<br>
America. Cirrosol 185AE is a octanoic (caprylic) acid-tetraethylene pentamine condensate<br>
solubulized with acetic acid, while 185AN is a nonanoic (pe/argonic) acid-tetraethylene<br>
pentamine condensate solubulized with acetic acid. A preferred sizing composition 18 is<br>
shown below in Table 1:<br>
TABLE 1: SIZING COMPOSITION 18<br>
CFM Binder Slurry<br>
Current binder materials use unsaturated polyester binders that have shown<br>
unacceptable performance in phenolic pultrusion systems. It is believed that the polyester<br>
binders do not provide a compatible interface with the phenolic binder resins. The CFM<br>
binder system of the present invention solves this problem by providing a compatible<br>
interface.<br>
The CFM binder slurry 24 is prepared by dispersing a powdered polymer resin<br>
having a thermally active cross-linking agent in water. One preferred powdered polymer<br>
resin having a thermally active cross-linking agent is a bisphenol type epoxy resin with a<br>
thermally active dicyandiamide cross-linking agent such as Pretex 110, manufactured by<br>
Reichold. One or more non-ionic surfactants are typically added as a dispersant and as a<br>
defoamer. Also, a phenolic compatible silane is added to the resultant mixture. Preferably,<br>
this silane is Witco-OSI's A-1100 silane. Finally, the pH is adjusted to between 4 and 6<br>
using acetic acid. A preferred composition of the CFM binder slurry is shown below in<br>
Table 2:<br>
TABLE 2: CFM BINDER SLURRY 24<br>
While the invention has been described in terms of preferred embodiments, it will<br>
be understood, of course, that the invention is not limited thereto since modifications may<br>
be made by those skilled in the art, particularly in light of the foregoing teachings.<br>
