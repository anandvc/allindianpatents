				<td>DECLARATION<br>
I, Koichi Hirota, a staff member of HIROTA, NAGARE &amp;<br>
ASSOCIATES, 4th Floor, Shinjuku TR Bldg., 2-2-13, Yoyogi, Shibuya-ku,<br>
Tokyo 151-0053 Japan, do solemnly and sincerely declare:<br>
1.	That I am well acquainted with both the English and Japanese<br>
languages, and<br>
2.	That the attached document is a true and correct translation of<br>
the specification accompanying the application for patent made<br>
in International Application No. PCT/JP2006/321912 as filed on<br>
1st November 2006.<br>
AND I make this declaration conscientiously believing the statement<br>
contained herein to be true in every particular.<br><br><br>
areas. As such, toners and/or image forming apparatuses have been<br>
demanded that can output stably high quality images under a wide variety of<br>
operating conditions meanwhile being substantially non-problematic under<br>
usual operating conditions.<br>
A binder containing a charge controller or a charge control agent is<br>
proposed in order to improve charging ability or charge stability and to<br>
prevent background smear (Patent Literature 3). However, the charge<br>
controller typically exhibits a low temperature fixability inferior to that of<br>
polyester resins, thus is likely to deteriorate the low temperature fixability of<br>
polyester resins. It is therefore necessary for the toner to improve the low<br>
temperature fixability still more that the charge controller should disperse<br>
uniformly into the toner and represent a sufficient charging property in less<br>
amount.<br>
Developers are typically used in electrophotographic, electrostatic<br>
recording or electrostatic printing processes in a way that a developer firstly<br>
attaches to a photoconductor on which an electrostatic image is formed in a<br>
developing step, then the developer is transferred from the photoconductor to<br>
a recording medium such as paper in a transfer step and fixed on the<br>
recording medium in a transfer step. The developers for developing<br>
electrostatic images on the surfaces with latent images are usually<br>
two-component developers containing a carrier and a toner or one-component<br>
developers containing a magnetic or non-magnetic toner and no carrier. In<br><br>
the processes as regards the two-component developers, the toner particles<br>
tend to attach the carrier surface to degrade the developer, and onesided<br>
consumption of toners decreases the toner concentration in the developers,<br>
which requires to maintain a certain ratio between toner and carrier by<br>
means of large-size developing devices. On the other hand, the apparatuses<br>
or devices have been downsized by virtue of advanced function of developing<br>
rollers as regards the one-component developers.<br>
In recent years, automation and coloring have been popularized still<br>
further in offices, such that various graphs by means of personal computers,<br>
images taken with digital cameras, or pictorial drafts read by scanners are<br>
printed and copied on a number of papers for personal presentation, for<br>
example. Images to be output by printers typically contain a complicated<br>
configuration including solid images, line images and halftone images even<br>
in one draft, thus are demanded in various manners along with high<br>
reliability.<br>
Conventional electrophotographic processes on the basis of<br>
one-component developers are classified into magnetic one-component<br>
developing processes by use of magnetic toners and non-magnetic<br>
one-component developing processes by use of non-magnetic toners. In the<br>
magnetic one-component developing processes, which have been recently in<br>
practical use for numerous small-size printers etc., a magnetic toner that<br>
contains a magnetic material such as magnetites is supported by a developer<br><br>
bearing member with a magnetic field" generating unit therein, and the toner<br>
is thin-layered by means of a layer thickness-control member and developed<br>
subsequently. However, most of the magnetic materials are of colored or<br>
black, which affording a deficiency that the coloring is difficult.<br>
On the other hand, in the non-magnetic one-component developing<br>
processes, a toner supply roller etc. is urged to contact with a developer<br>
bearing member thereby to supply a toner on the developer bearing member<br>
that electrostatically supports the toner, which is then thin-layered by means<br>
of a layer thickness-control member and developed, by virtue of the<br>
non-magnetic property of toners. The processes may advantageously be<br>
compliant to colorizing due to the absence of color magnetic materials, and<br>
the apparatuses may be small-sized still more and of low cost due to the<br>
absence of magnets in developer bearing members, thus have been recently<br>
in practical use for small-size full-color printers etc.<br>
The two-component developing systems may maintain stably the<br>
charging ability and the transportability even under prolonged usage and be<br>
easily compliant with high-speed developing devices, since a carrier is<br>
employed as a means for charging and transporting, the toner and the<br>
carrier is sufficiently stirred inside a developing unit and then transported to<br>
a developer bearing member before the developing.<br>
In contrast, there remain currently many problems to be solved in<br>
the one-component developing processes. That is, problems in charging or<br><br>
transporting tend to occur under prolonged usage or high speed in the<br>
one-component developing processes due to the absence of the charging and<br>
transporting means such as carriers. Specifically, when the toner is<br>
transported on the developer bearing member followed by thin-layering the<br>
toner by means of the layer thickness-control member before the developing<br>
in the one-component developing processes, toners of low or inverse charging<br>
tend to generate in a rate more than that of the two-component developing<br>
processes since the contacting or the frictional charging period is significantly<br>
shorter between the toner and the developer bearing member, the layer<br>
thickness-control member or the frictional electrification.<br>
In non-magnetic one-component developing processes, toners or<br>
developers are transported typically by at least one toner transporting<br>
member and electrostatic latent images on the latent image are developed by<br>
use of the transported toner. In the processes, the layer thickness of the<br>
toner should be as thin as possible on the surface of the toner transporting<br>
member. This is applicable to two-component developers with carriers<br>
having a very small diameter. When one-component developers and toners<br>
with a high electric resistance are employed together with, the layer<br>
thickness of the toner should also be as thin as possible in particular, since<br>
the toners are to be charged by developing units. In cases where the toner<br>
layer is thick, the toner layer is likely to be charged at only around its surface<br>
and far from uniformly charging over the entire toner layer. Therefore,<br><br>
toners are required to exhibit a rapid charging velocity and an appropriate<br>
charging amount.<br>
As such, charge control agents and additives are conventionally<br>
added to toners in order to stabilize the charging ability. The charge control<br>
agent controls and maintains the fractional charge amount of toners. The<br>
charge control agents of negative electricity are exemplified by mono azo<br>
dyes; metal salts of salicylic acid, naphthoic acid and dicarboxylic acids;<br>
metal complex salts of dicarboxylic acids; diazo compounds; and boron<br>
complex compounds. The charge control agents of positive electricity are<br>
exemplified by quaternary ammonium salts, imidazole compounds,<br>
nigrosines and azine dyes.<br>
However, some of these charge control agents are of chromatic color<br>
and inadequate for color toners. In addition, some of these charge control<br>
agents have a poor compatibility with binder resins and those on toner<br>
surface, which mostly contributing to the charging, tend to separate from the<br>
surface and fluctuate the charging ability of toners, or may<br>
disadvantageously smear developing sleeves or cause filming on<br>
photoconductors.<br>
Therefore, there conventionally arises a troublesome phenomenon<br>
that initial appropriate images degrade gradually to cause background<br>
smear or unclearness. In cases of continuous color copy along with<br>
supplying toners in particular, long term usage cannot be achieved since the<br><br>
charge amount of toners decreases and the initial tone of images significantly<br>
alters, such that no more than several thousand sheets of copy bring about<br>
premature exchange of process cartridges of an imaging unit, which leading<br>
to a large environmental load and bothersome processing of users.<br>
Moreover, heavy metals in almost all process cartridges are causing a social<br>
safety issue in recent years.<br>
In order to solve the problems described above, resin charge-control<br>
agents are proposed that improve the compatibility with binder resins,<br>
clarity of fixed toner images and environmental safety. The resin<br>
charge-control agents may afford stable charging ability/clarity due to<br>
appropriate compatibility with binder resins. However, the charge control<br>
agents are inferior in the charge amount/charging rate compared to toners<br>
containing mono azo dyes, metal salts or metal complex salts of salicylic acid,<br>
naphthoic acid or dicarboxylic acids. When the added amount of the resin<br>
charge-control agent increases, the charging ability may be improved but the<br>
toner fixability such as low temperature fixability or offset resistance is likely<br>
to degrade. Moreover, these compounds tend to exhibit excessively large<br>
environmental stability or moisture resistance with respect to their charge<br>
amount, which possibly resulting in background smear or fog (Patent<br>
Literatures 4 to 7).<br>
As such, copolymers are proposed that are proposed from monomers<br>
having an organic acid salt such as a sulfonic acid salt group and aromatic<br><br>
monomers having an electron attracting group. However, these copolymers<br>
represent an insufficient dispersion into the binder resins, and the effects on<br>
suppressing the fluctuation of toner charge amount or preventing the filming<br>
on developing sleeves or photoconductors are insufficient as regarding a<br>
prolonged period, although the charge amounts are sufficient by virtue of the<br>
moisture absorbability and tackiness derived possibly from monomers<br>
containing the organic acid salt such as the sulfonic acid salt group (Patent<br>
Literatures 8 to 11).<br>
In addition, such copolymers are proposed, formed of monomers<br>
containing an organic acid salt like a sulfonic acid salt group, aromatic<br>
monomers containing an electron-attracting group, and styrene or polyester<br>
monomers, in order to enhance the compatibility with binder resins such as<br>
styrene resins and polyester resins, however, providing insufficient effects on<br>
maintaining the charge amount or preventing the filming on developing<br>
sleeves or photoconductors. In particular, the charge control agents are<br>
typically unsatisfactory in combination with polyester or polyol resins as<br>
used for a color toner binder resin that are usually desirable in terms of<br>
coloring property and intensity.<br>
There have been such a technical trend that the apparatuses are<br>
small-sized, high-speed, and cost-lowered along with the printer market<br>
expanding; and currently, the apparatuses are demanded for higher<br>
reliability and longer life, toners are required to maintain their properties for<br><br>
a long period; however, the resin charge-control agents are less likely to<br>
maintain their charge control effect thus to blur or foul the developing<br>
sleeves or layer thickness-control members such as blades and rollers,<br>
consequently decreasing charging ability of toners and causing filming on<br>
photoconductors.<br>
The small-sized, high-speed apparatuses necessarily lead to<br>
developing processes with lower amounts of developers and shorter periods,<br>
which requiring developers having an excellent initial charging property. A<br>
variety of developing systems have been proposed for both of one-component<br>
developers and two-component developers; non-magnetic one-component<br>
development is desirable for printers by virtue of small-sizing or<br>
weight-saving ability and absence of carriers. In the developing systems,<br>
the toner amount on developing rollers is adjusted by way of forcibly<br>
frictioning and attaching toners on developing rollers or by means of blades<br>
since such properties are poor as toner supplying ability onto the developing<br>
rollers and toner-sustaining ability on the developing rollers. As a result,<br>
there arise such problems as filming tendency of toners onto the developing<br>
rollers, shorter lifetime of the developing rollers and unstable charge amount<br>
of toners, and these problems possibly disturb adequate development.<br>
Accordingly, color toners for the non-magnetic one-component development<br>
are often unsatisfactory in thermal resistance of toner binder resins in<br>
addition to usually necessary properties for conventional color toners, thus<br><br>
are likely to cause toner filming on the developing rollers.<br>
Furthermore, Patent literatures 1 to 4 describes Examples that<br>
show poor charge amount and charging velocity. When the added amount of<br>
resin charge-control agents for the countermeasure is increased, the charging<br>
ability may be improved but the toner fixability such as low temperature<br>
fixability or offset resistance is likely to be deteriorated. Moreover, these<br>
compounds tend to exhibit excessively large environmental stability or<br>
moisture resistance in their charge amount, which possibly resulting in<br>
background smear or fog.<br>
Furthermore, the proposals in Patent Literatures 8 to 11 may assure<br>
a sufficient charge amount due to moisture absorbability or adhesive<br>
property, however, there remain such problems as insufficient dispersion into<br>
toner binders, unsatisfactory suppression of charge fluctuation and<br>
insufficient effect on preventing filming onto sleeves and photoconductors.<br>
In forming images by electrophotographic processes, a latent image<br>
is electrostatically formed on an image bearing member of photoconductive<br>
materials etc., then charged toner particles are attached to the electrostatic<br>
latent image to form a visible image, followed by transferring the toner<br>
image onto a recording medium like papers and fixing thereof to produce an<br>
output image. In recent years, electrophotographic copiers and printers are<br>
changing rapidly from monochrome to full-color systems, and the full-color<br>
market has been expanding.<br><br>
In forming color images by full-color electrophotographic processes,<br>
typically, color toners of three elementary colors of yellow, magenta and cyan<br>
or four colors adding black thereto are duplicated to reproduce every color.<br>
In order to produce clear full-color images with excellent color reproducibility,<br>
therefore, the surface of fixed toner images should be somewhat smoothed to<br>
decrease optical diffraction, and it is also important that pigments are<br>
uniformly dispersed into toners and the dispersed pigments maintain the<br>
finely dispersed condition without re-coagulating.<br>
In order to reproduce the color of human skin in particular, it is<br>
required that the color is expressed by a subtractive mixing process through<br>
overlapping a yellow toner and a magenta toner, thus an optimum<br>
combination from yellow pigments, magenta pigments and resins for<br>
dispersion matrix has been investigated as a subject matter.<br>
Patent Literature 12, for example, discloses a magenta toner for<br>
developing electrostatic images, in which the toner is prepared by way of<br>
dissolving a toner composition, containing a polyester resin modified to form<br>
a urea bond, into an organic solvent to form a solution, which then undergoes<br>
a polyaddition reaction, then the dispersion liquid is removed for the solvent<br>
and rinsed, and the toner contains at least a colorant of a specific compound.<br>
In addition, Patent Literature 13 discloses a magenta toner for<br>
electrophotography containing at least a binder resin and a colorant, in<br>
which the toner contains a naphthol pigment having a certain structure as<br><br>
the colorant, and the tone has a shape factor SF1 of 110 to 140 and a volume<br>
average particle diameter of 2 to 9 μm.<br>
However, these proposals may be far from recovering by themselves<br>
the poor color reproducibility due to pigment re-agglomeration in toners, and<br>
thus the color reproducibility of images is currently far from accurate<br>
reproduction as for human shin color in particular.<br>

mono-alkanolamine of 2 to 12 carbon atoms or a polyalkanolamine thereof<br>
from which a hydrogen atom of one hydroxyl group is removed," other<br>
hydroxyl group(s) and still other hydroxyl group(s), within the<br>
polyalkanolamine that directly bonds to a Ti atom, may polycondense to form<br>
a ring structure)" other hydroxyl group(s) and still other hydroxyl group(s)<br>

temperatures.<br>
The temperature TE can be determined by way of measuring the<br>
complex viscosity coefficient η* while changing the resin temperature using a<br>
commercially available measurement device for dynamic viscoelasticity after<br>
melting-kneading a resin block at 130°C, 70 rpm for 30 minutes using a<br>

storage modulus while changing the resin temperature using a commercially<br>
available measurement device for dynamic viscoelasticity after<br>
melting-kneading a resin block at 130°C, 70 rpm for 30 minutes using a<br>
laboblast mill.<br>
In cases of polyester resins for monochrome, the temperature at<br>

130°C.<br>
The polyester resin for monochrome preferably contains 2 to 70% by<br><br>

Mp of no less than 1000 may lead to appropriate high temperature storage<br>
stability and proper powder flowability, and no higher than 30000 thereof<br>
may enhance milling ability of toners and thus bring about proper<br>
productivity.<br>

resin of polyester resins that the content of ingredients having a molecular<br>
mass of no more than 1500 is 1.8% by mass or less, more preferably 1.3% by<br>
mass or less, and still more preferably 1.1% by mass or less. The content of<br>
ingredients, having a molecular mass of no more than 1500, of 1.8% by mass<br>
or less may lead to more proper storage stability.<br>
The peak top molecular mass Mp, the number average molecular<br>

measured in accordance with DSC method defined in ASTM D 3418-82 using<br>
DSC20 SCC/580 by Seiko Instruments Inc., for example.<br>

exemplified by heating a diol (g), a dicarboxylic acid (i) and a trivalent or<br>
more polyol (h) to 180°C to 260°C to undergo dehydration and condensation<br>
under normal or reduced pressure in the presence of a titanium-containing<br>
catalyst (a) of 0.0001 to 0.8% by mass based on the mass of the resulting<br>
polymer and other optional catalysts thereby to prepare (AX2). The (j) may<br>
be reacted with the (g), (i) and (h) at the same time.<br>
The process for producing the modified polyester resin (AYl) is<br>
exemplified by adding a polyepoxide (c) to the polyester resin (AX2) and<br>
allowing a molecule-extending reaction of the polyester at 180°C to 260°C<br>
thereby to prepare the (AYl).<br>
The acid value of (AX2) to react with (c) is preferably 1 to 60<br>
mgKOH/g, more preferably 5 to 50 mgKOH/g. The acid value of no less<br>
than 1 mgKOH/g may eliminate the possibility of (c) not to react and thus to<br>
degrade the resin properties, and the acid value of no more than 60<br>
mgKOH/g may bring about proper thermal stability of the resin.<br>
The amount of (c) to prepare (AXl) is preferably 0.01 to 10% by mass<br>
based on (AX2), more preferably 0.05 to 5% by mass in view of low<br>
temperature fixability and hot offset resistance.<br>
The polycondensation polyester resin is preferable in the present<br>
invention for the binder resin of full-color toners in view of coloring<br>
properties and image intensity. Color images typically result in thicker<br>
toner layers due to multiple overlapping of toner layers, which leading to<br><br>
cracks or defects on images due to insufficient strength and/or diminishing<br>
appropriate gloss. As such, the polyester resin is employed for maintaining<br>
appropriate gloss and excellent strength.<br>
It is preferred for the polyester resin in the binder resin in particular<br>
that there exists substantially no THF-insoluble matter, the content of the<br>
ingredients having a molecular mass of 500 is no more than 4% by mass in<br>
the molecular mass distribution of gel permeation chromatography, and one<br>
peak exists within a molecular-mass range of 3000 to 9000. The THF<br>
insoluble matter tends to decrease the glossiness and transparency, thus<br>
high quality images are difficult in OHP sheets. It is preferable for the<br>
inventive toner to prevent filmings on blades or sleeves such that the content<br>
of the ingredients having a molecular mass of 500 is no more than 4% by<br>
mass in the molecular mass distribution of the binder resin, and the ratio of<br>
mass average molecular mass (Mw) to number average molecular mass (Mn)<br>
is 2 
having a molecular mass of 500 tends to bring about smearing the blades or<br>
sleeves under prolonged usage and to induce filming.<br>
The molecular mass of the binder resin in the inventive toner may be<br>
measured based on gel permeation chromatography by way of conditioning a<br>
column within a heat chamber at 40°C, flowing THF into the column at<br>
1mL/min at the temperature as the solvent, and injecting a THF sample<br>
solution, prepared from a toner at a sample concentration of 0.05 to 0.6% by<br><br>
mass, in an amount of 200 μL. The THF insoluble matter in the THF<br>
sample solution is removed by a 0.45 μm filter for liquid chromatography<br>
before injection thereof.<br>
The molecular mass distribution of samples is calculated from a<br>
relation between logarithmic values of a calibration curve formed from a<br>
number of monodispersion polystyrene standards and a counted number.<br>
The polystyrene standards for the calibration curve are those having a<br>
molecular mass of 6xlO2, 2.1x103, 4x103, 1.75x104, 5.1x104, 1.1x105, 3.9x105,<br>
8.6X105, 2x106, 4.48X106 by Pressure Chemical Co. or Tosoh Co., or the like,<br>
preferably at least about 10 polystyrene standards are utilized. The<br>
detector is a refractive index (RI) detector. The existence of THF insoluble<br>
matters in the binder resin may be judged at preparing the THF sample<br>
solution for measuring the molecular mass distribution. That is, it is judged<br>
that substantially no THF insoluble matters exist as long as the filter being<br>
not clogged when a filter unit of 0.45 μm is attached to a syringe and a liquid<br>
is extruded from the syringe.<br>
It is preferred in the present invention that the binder resin<br>
represents an endothermic peak at 60°C to 70°C under the measurement<br>
using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The endothermic peak of<br>
below 60°C may affect the toner storage ability and cause problems such as<br>
toner solidification within cartridges or hoppers. On the other hand, the<br>
endothermic peak of below 60°C may affect the toner productivity and cause<br><br>
problems such as low feeding ability at milling processes. The endothermic<br>
peak in the differential scanning calorimeter may be read as a main<br>
maximum peak in the endothermic curve using, for example, Rigaku<br>
THRMOFLEX TG8110 (by Rigaku Co.) under a temperature-rising rate of<br>
10°C/min.<br>
It is preferable as described above that the ratio of mass average<br>
molecular mass (Mw) to number average molecular mass (Mn) is 2 

images with less gloss of the fixed toner and far from high quality images.<br>
On the other hand, ratio Mw/Mn of below 2 may bring about low productivity<br>
in milling processes of toner production and smearing of blades or sleeves<br>
under prolonged usage, and thus inducing the filming.<br>
It is preferred in the polyester resin that the acid value is no more<br>
than 10 mgKOH/g when a resin charge-control agent described later is<br>
employed. It is known that the charging ability and the acid value<br>
represent a proportional relation in the polyester resin, and that the higher<br>
acid value leads to larger negative-charging ability of the resin and also<br>
affects the environmental properties at charging. That is, when the acid<br>
value is higher, the charge amount is larger under low temperature and low<br>
humidity conditions, and the charge amount is lower under high<br>
temperature and high humidity conditions. The change of the charge<br>
amount due to the environmental conditions may enlarge the changes of<br><br>
background smear, image concentration and color reproducibility, thus<br>
making difficult to maintain high quality images. In general, the acid value<br>
of above 20 mgKOH/g may possibly increase the charge amount and<br>
deteriorate the environmental fluctuation.<br>
When the polyester resin is employed in the inventive toner, the<br>
resistance of the toner particles may be controlled by the resin charge-control<br>
agent, hydrophobic silica, hydrophobic titanium oxide etc. Therefore, the<br>
charge control effect of the resin charge-control agent, hydrophobic silica, or<br>
hydrophobic titanium oxide may be disturbed when the acid value of the<br>
polyester resin is above 10 mgKOH/g. The acid value of the polyester resin<br>
employed in the present invention is preferably no more than 10 mgKOH/g,<br>
more preferably no more than 5 mgKOH/g.<br>
It is preferred that the polyester resin represents a temperature<br>
within 95°C to 120°C at which the apparent viscosity comes to 103 Pas<br>
measured by a flow tester. When the temperature is below 95°C, the hot<br>
offset tends to occur at fixing processes, and the temperature of above 120°C<br>
may result in insufficient gloss. The temperature, at which the apparent<br>
viscosity comes to 103 Pa-s, may be measured using a flow tester CFT-500 (by<br>
Shimadzu Co.) under conditions of load 10 kg/cm2, orifice size 1 mm by<br>
length 1 mm, and temperature-rising rate 5°C/min, and reading the<br>
temperature corresponding to the apparent viscosity of 103 Pa-s.<br>
Resin Charge-Control Agent<br><br>
When a monomer containing a sulfonic acid salt group is added as a<br>
monomer of the resin charge-control agent, the resin charge-control agent<br>
may improve the negative-charging effect. On the other hand, the<br>
environmental stability or temperature/humidity stability of the toner tends<br>
to degrade due to the moisture-absorbing property, thus it is popular in the<br>
art that an aromatic monomer with an electron-attracting group is utilized<br>
for a copolymer. However, when the toner is used for a long term over<br>
several ten thousands of sheets, smears or photoconductor filmings appear<br>
on the developing sleeves or layer thickness-control members such as blades<br>
and rollers, the charge stability of toners or high quality images cannot be<br>
maintained sufficiently, and the productivity decreases, even though several<br>
thousands of sheets cause substantially no problem.<br>
In order to address these deficiencies, the inventive toner employs a<br>
copolymer that is formed from (1) a monomer containing a sulfonic acid salt<br>
group, (2) an aromatic monomer containing an electron attracting group, and<br>
(3) a monomer of a (meth)acrylic acid ester, or a copolymer formed from (1) to<br>
(3) and also (4) an aromatic vinyl monomer, as the resin charge-control agent,<br>
for the purpose of a binder resin for full-color toner in addition to polyester<br>
resins that are favorable in terms of coloring properties and image intensity,<br>
thereby, an electrostatic image developing toner is provided that may exhibit<br>
excellent charging stability and environmental stability, that are far from<br>
smearing the developing sleeves or layer thickness-control members such as<br><br>
blades and rollers, that may appropriately form thin films, that may free<br>
from photoconductor filmings, and that may maintain high image quality<br>
and high productivity.<br>
The resin charge control agent is defined in terms of molecular mass<br>
distribution as for the content of molecular mass of no more than lxlO3.<br>
The ingredients having a molecular mass of no more than lxlO3 are lower<br>
molecular mass compounds, copolymers, ionomers, residual monomers etc;<br>
these ingredients possibly inhibit to generate charging and fluctuate the<br>
charging under the influence of temperatures and humidities. These<br>
ingredients also affect its safety such as skin stimulation and fish poison.<br>
The ingredients having a molecular mass of no more than lxlO3 in a content<br>
of 10% by mass or more may make the charging property unstable under the<br>
significant influence of temperatures and humidities.<br>
These inventive effects are estimated due to the following reasons<br>
the combination of the monomer containing a sulfonic acid salt group and the<br>
aromatic monomer containing an electron attracting group may enhance the<br>
negative-charge effect. The monomer of a (meth)acrylic acid ester and also<br>
the aromatic vinyl monomer may still enhance the environmental charge<br>
stability and increase the resin hardness, which leading to desirable milling<br>
property and effectively preventing the photoconductor filmings without<br>
smearing the developing sleeves or layer thickness-control members such as<br>
blades and rollers.<br><br>
In addition, the low molecular mass ingredients as well as the<br>
combination of monomers in the resin charge control agent may bring about<br>
an electrostatic image developing toner having an adequate dispersing<br>
ability and a sharp distribution of charge amount desirable for long term<br>
charge stability and high image quality, in the combination with a polyester<br>
resin that is favorable in terms of coloring properties and image intensity as<br>
a binder resin for full-color toners.<br>
The monomer containing a sulfonic acid salt group in the resin<br>
charge-control agent is exemplified by aliphatic monomers containing a<br>
sulfonic acid salt group and aromatic monomers containing a sulfonic acid<br>
salt group. Examples of the aliphatic monomers containing a sulfonic acid<br>
salt group include alkaline metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts, amine<br>
salts, and quaternary ammonium salts of vinylsulfonic acids,<br>
allylvinylsulfonic acids, 2-acrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid,<br>
methacryloyloxyethylsulfonic acid, or perfluorooctanesulfonic acid.<br>
Examples of the aromatic monomers containing a sulfonic acid salt group<br>
include alkaline metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts, amine salts, and<br>
quaternary ammonium salts of styrenesulfonic acid, sulfophenyl acrylamide,<br>
or sulfophenyl itaconic imide. The metal salts of heavy metals like nickel,<br>
copper, zinc, mercury and chromium are undesirable in terms of safety.<br>
Examples of the aromatic monomers containing an electron<br>
attracting group in the resin charge control agent include substituted<br><br>
styrenes such as chlorostyrene, dichlorostyrene, bromostyrene, fluorostyrene,<br>
nitrostyrene and cyanstyrene; substituted phenyl(meth)acrylates such as<br>
chlorophenyl(meth)acrylate, bromophenyl(meth)acrylate,<br>
nitrophenyl(meth)acrylate and chlorophenyloxyethyl(meth)acrylate;<br>
substituted phenyl(meth)acrylamides such as chlorophenyl(meth)acrylamide,<br>
bromophenyl(meth)acrylamide and nitrophenyl(meth)acrylamide;<br>
substituted phenyhnaleimides such as chlorophenylmaleimide,<br>
dichlorophenylmaleimide, nitrophenyhnaleimide and<br>
nitrochlorophenylmaleimide, substituted phenylitaconimides such as<br>
chlorophenylitaconimide, dichlorophenyhtaconimide, nitrophenylitaconimide<br>
and nitrochlorophenyhtaconimide, and substituted phenylvinyl ethers such<br>
as chlorophenylvinyl ether and nitrophenylvinyl ether. Among these,<br>
phenylmaleimide and phenylitaconimide substituted by a chloride or nitro<br>
group are particularly preferable in view of charging ability and filming<br>
resistance.<br>
Examples of the (meth)acrylic acid ester monomer in the resin<br>
charge control agent include methyl(meth)acrylate, ethyl(meth)acrylate,<br>
propyl(meth)acrylate, n-butyl(meth)acrylate, isobutyl(meth)acrylate,<br>
stearyl(meth)acrylate, dodecyl(meth)acrylate and<br>
2-ethylhexyl(meth)acrylate.<br>
Examples pf the aromatic vinyl monomer in the resin charge-control<br>
agent include styrene, vinyltoluene, and alpha-methylstyrene.<br><br>
It is preferred in the resin charge-control agent that the amount of<br>
the monomer containing a sulfonic acid salt group is 1 to 30% by mass based<br>
on the entire mass of the resin charge-control agent, more preferably 2 to<br>
20% by mass. In cases where the amount of the monomer containing a<br>
sulfonic acid salt group is less than 1% by mass, the initial charging property<br>
and/or the saturated charge amount is insufficient, possibly influencing<br>
images. In cases where the amount is above 30% by mass, the<br>
environmental stability degrades at the charging step, the charge amount is<br>
lower at high temperature and high humidity conditions, the charge amount<br>
is higher at low temperature and low humidity conditions, thus the charge<br>
stability of toners or high quality images cannot be maintained sufficiently.<br>
Moreover, smears or photoconductor film ings tend to appear on the<br>
developing sleeves or layer thickness-control members such as blades and<br>
rollers, and the productivity in kneading-milling steps of toner production<br>
tends to decrease.<br>
The amount of the aromatic monomer containing an electron<br>
attracting group is preferably 1 to 80% by mass based on the entire mass of<br>
the resin charge control agent, more preferably 20 to 70% by mass. When<br>
the amount of the aromatic monomer containing an electron attracting group<br>
is less than 1% by mass, the charge amount is insufficient, and background<br>
smear or toner scattering is likely to occur ; and when the amount is above<br>
80% by mass, the monomer exhibits poor dispersibility into toners to widen<br><br>
the charging distribution of toners, which leading to background smear, toner<br>
scattering and insufficient high quality images.<br>
The amount of the acrylic ester monomer and/or methacrylic ester<br>
monomer is preferably 10 to 80% by mass based on the resin charge control<br>
agent, more preferably 20 to 70% by mass. When the amount of the acrylic<br>
ester monomer and/or methacrylic ester monomer is below 10% by mass, the<br>
environmental stability is insufficient in the charging step, the milling ability<br>
is insufficient at kneading-milling steps in the toner production, smears on<br>
the developing sleeves or layer thickness-control members such as blades<br>
and rollers or photoconductor filmings cannot be sufficiently prevented; when<br>
the amount is above 80% by mass, the initial charging property and/or the<br>
charge amount is insufficient, possibly influencing images.<br>
The amount of the aromatic vinyl monomer is preferably 0 to 30% by<br>
mass based on the entire mass of the resin charge control agent, more<br>
preferably 3 to 20% by mass. When the amount of the aromatic vinyl<br>
monomer is above 30% by mass, the resin charge control agent comes to hard,<br>
which leading to a wide charging distribution, background smear, toner<br>
scattering in the processes, and also inferior toner fixability in particular<br>
poor coloring property at mixing color toners.<br>
The aromatic monomer in the resin charge control agent may be<br>
phenylmaleimide or phenylitaconimide substituted by chloride or a nitro<br>
group as described above. The resin charge control agent may fluctuate its<br><br>
volume resistivity possibly due to residual matters of catalysts,<br>
polymerization inhibitors, or solvents at the monomer production processes,<br>
which sometimes adversely influences on the intended toner charging<br>
amount. Therefore, there may cause problems in initial charging ability or<br>
charging to a saturated level with respect to toners that contain a resin<br>
negative-charge control agent.<br>
As such, it is preferred in the present invention that the volume<br>
resistivity of the resin charge control agent is 9.5 to 11.5 Log ohm cm, more<br>
preferably 10.0 to 11.0 Log ohnrcm. In cases where the volume resistivity of<br>
the resin charge control agent is below 9.5 Log ohm-cm, toners on developing<br>
rollers may initially take an insufficient charge amount, which possibly<br>
causing background smear or toner scattering. In cases where the volume<br>
resistivity of the resin charge control agent is above 11.5 Log ohnrcm, toners<br>
on developing rollers may initially take a sufficient charge amount, however,<br>
charge up tends to appear with time, which possibly leading to nonuniform<br>
toner thin layers on developing rollers under one-component developing<br>
systems to generate color streaks or irregularities on images. In cases of<br>
two-component developing systems, the image density often decreases, and<br>
background smear or toner scattering is likely to occur.<br>
The volume resistivity of the resin charge control agent may be<br>
measured in accordance with JIS K6911. Specifically, the resin charge<br>
control agent is size-controlled with a mesh and conditioned at 23°C and 50%<br><br>
RH. The sample of 3 g is molded at pressure 500 kg/cm2 using an automatic<br>
pressure molding machine to prepare a disc-like test piece of 2 mm thick by 4<br>
cm diameter. The test piece is placed on a dielectric loss tester (TR10C, by<br>
Ando Electric Co.) after measuring precisely the thickness with a micrometer,<br>
and the volume resistivity is measured with applying an alternative voltage<br>
of frequency 1 kHz.<br>
It is preferred in the resin charge control agent that the temperature<br>
corresponding to the apparent viscosity of 104 Pa's by a flow tester is 85°C to<br>
110°C. In cases where the temperature is below 85°C, the dispersibility of<br>
the resin charge control agent is inappropriate in toners, which possibly<br>
decreasing the charge amount and also leading to inferior storage stability<br>
and agglomeration or solidification; moreover, fixation tends to occur in<br>
kneading, milling, or classifying production steps, which deteriorating the<br>
productivity. On the other hand, in cases where the temperature is above<br>
110°C, the monomer exhibits poor dispersibility into toners to widen the<br>
charging distribution of toners, which leading to background smear or toner<br>
scattering in the systems. Moreover, toner fixability, in particular the<br>
coloring property, degrades at overlapping color toners. The temperature, at<br>
which the apparent viscosity comes to 104 Pas, may be measured by using a<br>
flow tester CFT-500 (by Shimadzu Co.) under conditions of load 10 kg/cm2,<br>
orifice of diameter 1 mm by length 1 mm and temperature-rising rate<br>
5°C/min, and reading the temperature corresponding to the apparent<br><br>
viscosity of 104 Pa-s.<br>
The mass average molecular mass of the resin charge control agent<br>
is preferably 5x103 to 1x105. In cases where the mass average molecular<br>
mass is below 5x103, the dispersibility of the resin charge control agent is<br>
inappropriate in toners, which possibly decreasing the charge amount and<br>
also leading fixation in milling steps during production processes including<br>
kneading, milling, or classifying steps, which further deteriorating the<br>
productivity. On the other hand, in cases where the mass average<br>
molecular mass is above 1x105, the monomer exhibits poor dispersibility into<br>
toners to widen the charging distribution of toners, which leading to<br>
background smear or toner scattering in the systems, or inferior toner<br>
fixability of coloring properties.<br>
It is also preferred in the resin charge control agent that the mass<br>
amount of ingredients having a molecular mass of no more than lxlO3 is no<br>
more than 10% by mass, more preferably no more than 6% by mass. The<br>
ingredients having a molecular mass of no more than 1x103 are lower<br>
molecular mass compounds, copolymers, ionomers, residual monomers etc.;<br>
these ingredients possibly inhibit to generate charging and fluctuate the<br>
charging under the influence of temperatures and humidities; moreover,<br>
these ingredients also affect its safety such as skin stimulation and fish<br>
poison.<br>
It is also preferred that the following relation is satisfied: 0.9 
 <br>
resin has an apparent viscosity of 103 Pa-s measured by a flow tester, and T2<br>
represents the temperature at which the resin charge control agent has an<br>
apparent viscosity of 104 Pas measured by the flow tester.<br>
The dispersibility of the charge control agent into the binder resin is<br>
an important factor to decide the charging ability of toners. In accordance<br>
with the present invention, a combination of a specific binder resin and a<br>
specific resin charge control agent may lead to a toner with an appropriate<br>
charging ability and an excellent initial charging property. On the other<br>
hand, it is apparent as described above that the dispersibility or<br>
compatibility between the binder resin and the resin charge control agent<br>
affects the charging ability. The present inventors have found the optimum<br>
range in terms of the apparent viscosity measured by a flow tester and the<br>
dispersibility of binder resins and resin charge control agents. In cases<br>
where T1/T2 is below 0.9, the apparent viscosities of the binder resin and the<br>
resin charge control agent are similar, which leading to a dissolved condition<br>
between the binder resin and the resin charge control agent, resulting in an<br>
insufficient saturated charge amount and inferior initial charging property.<br>
In cases where T1/T2 is above 1.4, the apparent viscosities of the binder resin<br>
and the resin charge control agent are excessively different, which leading to<br>
inferior dispersibility of the resin charge control agent, resulting in initial<br>
background smear and decrease of the charge amount with time. In<br><br>
addition, proper charging ability may be attained and filmings are unlikely<br>
to generate by way of defining the constitutional monomers, apparent<br>
viscosity thereof, and viscosity ratio of apparent viscosities of dispersed<br>
binder resins.<br>
The amount of the resin charge control agent is preferably 0.1 to 20%<br>
by mass based on the toner particles, more preferably 0.5 to 10% by mass.<br>
In cases where the amount is below 0.1% by mass, the initial charging and<br>
the charge amount are insufficient, which possibly influencing images like<br>
background smear and dusts. On the other hand, in cases where the<br>
amount is above 20% by mass, the poor dispersibility widens the charging<br>
distribution, which possibly leading to background smear or toner scattering<br>
in the systems.<br>
The additives utilized in the inventive toner are exemplified by<br>
hydrophobic-treated silica having a primary particle diameter of 0.01 to 0.03<br>
μm and hydrophobic-treated specific titanium oxide having a primary<br>
particle diameter of 0.01 to 0.03 μm and a specific surface area of 60 to 140<br>
m2/g, in cases a resin charge control agent is utilized. When these additives<br>
are employed along with the polyester resin and the resin charge control<br>
agent, the toner may be obtained with a stable charging ability.<br>
When the hydrophobic-treated silica having a primary particle<br>
diameter of 0.01 to 0.03 μm is attached to the surface of the base toner, the<br>
toner may take the necessary flowabihty and charging ability, resulting in<br><br>
appropriate developing ability on developing rollers and therefrom to<br>
photoconductors. The amount of the silica is preferably no less than 2.1<br>
parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the base toner. Consequently,<br>
the toner may be made into uniform thin layers on developing rollers,<br>
irregularity may be significantly improved for the thin layers, and also white<br>
streaks due to toner fusion onto developer coating blades may be prevented<br>
due to stirring by developing rollers for a long period. In cases where the<br>
silica amount is less than the range, the toner flowability may be insufficient<br>
for supplying a necessary amount of toner to developing rollers, or the charge<br>
amount of the toner may be less than the necessary level. Moreover, the<br>
toner may be made into nonuniform thin layers on developing rollers, which<br>
possibly inhibiting uniform developments and images or generating white<br>
streaks due to toner fusion onto developer coating blades.<br>
In addition, by virtue of attaching a hydrophobictreated titanium<br>
oxide having a primary particle diameter of 0.01 to 0.03 μm and a specific<br>
surface area of 60 to 140 m2/g onto the surface of the base toner, the charging<br>
ability of the toner may be stabilized, in particular the initial charging<br>
property is improved and the charge up is prevented. The amount of the<br>
titanium oxide is preferably 0.4 to 1.0 part by mass based on 100 parts by<br>
mass of the base toner. When the amount is less than 0.4 part by mass, the<br>
development of the toner may be insufficient due to excessively high charging<br>
ability of the toner, and when the amount is above 1.0 part by mass, the<br><br>
toner may scatter from developing rollers or cause background smear due to<br>
excessively low charging ability of the toner.<br>
The term "base toner" means the particles on the way of production<br>
that contain at least a binder resin, colorant, and resin charge control other<br>
than additives.<br>
The inventive toner binder resin (A) may contain optional other<br>
resins in addition to the polycondensation polyester resins described above.<br>
Examples of the other resins include styrene resins such as<br>
copolymers of styrene and alkyl(meth)acrylate and copolymers of styrene and<br>
diene monomers; epoxy resins such as ring-opening polymers of bisphenol A<br>
diglycidyl; and urethane resins such as polyadducts of diols and/or trivalent<br>
or more polyols and diisocyanates.<br>
Preferably, the mass average molecular mass of the other resins is<br>
1000 to 2,000,000. The amount of the other resins is preferably 0 to 40% by<br>
mass in the toner binder resin (A), more preferably 0 to 30% by mass, still<br>
more preferably 0 to 20% by mass.<br>
In cases where two or more species of polyester resins are used in<br>
combination, or at least one species of polyester resin and at least one species<br>
of other resin are combined, these may be powder-mixed or melted-mixed, or<br>
may be mixed in toner production processes.<br>
The temperature for melting and mixing is preferably 80°C to 180°C,<br>
more preferably 100°C to 170°C, still more preferably 120°C to 160°C.<br><br>
Lower mixing temperatures below the range may result in insufficient<br>
mixing and nonuniform mixture. When two or more species of polyester<br>
resins are mixed, excessively high mixing temperatures may deteriorate<br>
resin properties necessary for toner binder because of averaging through an<br>
ester exchange reaction.<br>
The mixing period in the melting and mixing step is preferably 10<br>
seconds to 30 minutes, more preferably 20 seconds to 10 minutes, still more<br>
preferably 30 seconds to 5 minutes. When two or more species of polyester<br>
resins are mixed, excessively long mixing periods may deteriorate resin<br>
properties necessary for toner binder because of averaging through an ester<br>
exchange reaction.<br>
The mixing device at the melting and mixing step may be batch<br>
mixing devices such as reaction vessels and continuous mixing devices.<br>
Continuous mixing devices are suited for uniformly mixing at an appropriate<br>
temperature for shorter periods. The continuous mixing devices are<br>
exemplified by extruders, continuous kneaders, three rollers, etc. Among<br>
these, extruders and continuous kneaders are preferable.	In cases of<br>
powder mixing, conventional mixing conditions and devices are available.<br>
As for the mixing conditions of powder mixing, the mixing<br>
temperature is preferably 0°C to 80°C, more preferably 10°C to 60°C; the<br>
mixing period is preferably no shorter than 3 minutes, more preferably 5 to<br>
60 minutes. Examples of the mixing device include Henschel mixers,<br><br>
Nautor mixers, banbury mixers, etc. Among these, Henschel mixers are<br>
preferable in particular.<br>

Release Agent<br>
A wax having a low melting point of 50°C to 120°C may be used for<br>
the release agent (C); the wax effectively works on between fixing rollers and<br>
toner surfaces as a release agent, which effects hot offset resistance even<br>
without coating a release agent such as lubricants onto the fixing rollers.<br><br>

550P and Biscol 660P (by Sanyo Chemical Industries Ltd.).<br>
Among these waxes, carnauba waxes and Fischer-Tropsch waxes are<br>
preferable, carnauba waxes and petroleum Fischer-Tropsch waxes are more<br>
preferable.<br>
These waxes may act as a release agent and provide excellent low<br>
temperature fixability with toners.<br>
The amount of the release agent (C) is preferably 0 to 15% by mass<br>
based on the toner, more preferably 1 to 10% by mass.<br>

complex (by Japan Carlit Co., Ltd.), copper phtalocyamine, perylene,<br>
quinacridone, azo pigment, and other high-molecular weight compounds<br>
having a functional group, such as sulfonic acid group, carboxyl group, and<br>
quaternary ammonium salt. Among the charge control agents, those<br>
capable of controlling toners to a negative polarity are preferable.<br>
The amount of the charge control agent depends on the type of<br>
binder resins, optional additives, and methods for manufacturing; preferably,<br>
the amount is 0.1 to 10 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of binder<br>
resin, more preferably 0.2 to 5 part by mass. When the amount is more<br>
than 10 parts by weight, toner-charge properties are excessive, which lessens<br>
the effect of the charge control agent, increases in electrostatic attraction<br>
force with developing rollers, and degrades developer fluidity and image<br>
density.<br>
Examples of the charge control agents preferable for the present<br><br>
invention are the resin charge control agents described above,<br>
bis[1-(5-chloro-2-hydroxyphenylazo)-2-naphtolat]chromic (III) acid, nigrosine,<br>
perfluoroalkyltrimethylammonium iodine, polyhydroalkanoate and those<br>

mass based on the toner, more preferably 0.1 to 15% by mass.<br>

Among these, preferable are metal oxides, metal nitrides and metal carbides,<br>
in particular those external additives having a number average particle<br>
diameter of 8 to 80 nm or 120 to 300 nm. Among the inorganic fine particles<br>
described above, preferable are silica, alumina, titanium oxide, in particular<br>
silica and titanium oxide. It is preferred for the charging ability and<br><br>
flowability of toners that the external additive comprises titanium oxide<br>
having a number average particle diameter of 5 to 40 run in terms of the<br>
primary particles.<br>
The amount of the inorganic fine particles as the external additive is<br>
preferably 0.01 to 5% by mass based on the base toner.<br>
In order to control precisely the flowability of toners, not only control<br>
of production conditions to produce the additives but also crushing or milling<br>
and screening of the resulting products are important. It is also important<br>
how to attach the additives to toner surface and the attaching conditions.<br>
The external additives may be used in combination with inorganic<br>
fine particles or hydrophobic-treated inorganic fine particles. Preferably,<br>
there exist two species of fine particles on the toner surface, such that one is<br>
low diameter inorganic fine particles having an average particle diameter of<br>
hydrophobictreated primary particles of 1 to 20 nm, more preferably 6 to 15<br>
nm (BET surface area: 100 to 400 m2/g), and another is high diameter<br>
inorganic fine particles having an average particle diameter of<br>
hydrophobic-treated primary particles of 30 to 150 nm, more preferably 90 to<br>
130 nm (BET surface area: 20 to 100 m2/g). Preferably, the low diameter<br>
inorganic fine particles are of silica or titanium oxide, more preferably the<br>
both; preferably, the large diameter inorganic fine particles are of silica;<br>
preferably, the silica is of wet processes such as sol-gel processes; more<br>
preferably, medium diameter inorganic fine particles, preferably of silica, also<br><br>
exist on the toner surface, of which the average particle diameter being 20 to<br>
50 nm (BET surface area: 40 to 100 m2/g).<br>
The inorganic fine particles may be selected from conventional ones<br>
including silica fine particles, hydrophobic silica; fatty acid metal salts such<br>
as zinc stearate and aluminum stearate; metal oxides such as titania,<br>
alumina, tin oxide and antimony oxide; and fluoropolymers.<br>
Particularly preferable additive is hydrophobkrtreated silica, titania,<br>
titanium oxide and alumina fine particles. Examples of the silica fine<br>
particles include HDKH2000, HDKH2000/4, HDKH2050EP, HVK21,<br>
HDKH1303 (by Hochst Co.), R972, R974, RX200, RY200, R202, R805 and<br>
R812 (by Nippon Aerosil Co.). Examples of the titania fine particles include<br>
P-25 (by Nippon Aerosil Co.), STT-30, STT-65C-S (by Titanium Industries<br>
Ltd.), TAF-140 (by Fuji Titanium Industry, Co.), MT-150W, MT-500B,<br>
MT-600B and MT150A (by Tayca Co.). Examples of the<br>
hydrophobic-treated titanium oxide fine particles include P-805 (by Nippon<br>
Aerosil Co.), STT-30A, STT-65SS (by Titanium Industries Ltd.), TAF-500T,<br>
TAF-1500T (by Fuji Titanium Industry, Co.), MT-100S, MT-100T (by Tayca<br>
Co.), and ITS (by Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha Ltd.)<br>
The hydrophobic-treated oxide fine particles of silica, titania or<br>
alumina may be produced by treating the hydrophilic fine particle with<br>
silane coupling agents such as methyltriethoxysilane and<br>
octyltriethoxysilane. In addition, silicone oil-treated oxide fine particles or<br><br>
inorganic fine particles are available, which are treated with a silicone oil<br>
with heating as required.<br>
Examples of the silicone oil include dimethyl silicone oil,<br>

oil, alkyl-modified silicone oil, fluorine-modified silicone oil,<br>

silicone oil, acrylic or methacrylic-modified silicone oils, and<br>
alpha-methylstyrenemodified silicone oils.<br>
The inorganic fine particles are exemplified by silica, alumina,<br>
titanium oxide, barium titanate, magnesium titanate, calcium titanate,<br>
strontium titanate, iron oxide, copper oxide, zinc oxide, tin oxide, silica sand,<br>
clay, mica, wollastonite, diatomaceous earth, chromium oxide, cerium oxide,<br>
iron oxide red, antimony trioxide, magnesium oxide, zirconium oxide, barium<br>
sulfate, barium carbonate, calcium carbonate, silicon carbide and silicon<br>
nitride. Among these, silica and titanium dioxide are preferable in<br>
particular. The added amount is preferably 0.1 to 5% by mass based on the<br>
toner, more preferably 0.3 to 3% by mass.<br>
The average particle diameter of primary particles of the inorganic<br>
fine particles is preferably no larger than 100 nm, more preferably 3 to 70 nm.<br>
In cases where the diameter is less than the range, the inorganic fine<br><br>
particles tend to be embedded into toners to hide the effective performance;<br>
and when the diameter is larger than the range, the photoconductor surface<br>
is likely to be damaged nonuniformly.<br>
The other external additives or fluidizers are exemplified by polymer<br>
fine particles of polystyrenes, methacrylate copolymers or acrylate<br>
copolymers produced through soap-free emulsion, suspension or dispersion<br>
polymerization; polycondensation products such as silicones,<br>
benzoguanamine and nylon; and polymer particles of thermosetting resins.<br>
These fluidizers may be possibly surface-treated to enhance the<br>
hydrophobicity thereby to maintain the flowability and/or charging property<br>
even under high humidity conditions; examples of the treating agents are<br>
silane coupling agents, silylation agents, silanecoupling agents having alkyl<br>
fluorides, organo-titanium coupling agents, aluminum coupling agents,<br>
silicone oil, and modified silicone oil<br>
The toner may also contain a cleaning aid to assist the cleaning of<br>
developers remaining on photoconductors or primary transferred bodies,"<br>
examples of the cleaning aid include fatty acid metal salts such as zinc<br>
stearate, stearic acid calcium and stearic acid; and polymer fine particles<br>
produced through soap-free-emulsion polymerization such as<br>
polymethylmethacrylate fine particles and polystyrene fine particles. Those<br>
polymer fine particles preferably have a narrower particle diameter<br>
distribution and a volume average particle diameter of 0.01 μm to 1 μm.<br><br>
In addition, the toner may further contain, as the other additives,<br>
fluoropolymers, polyolefins of low molecular mass; metal oxides such as<br>
aluminum oxide, tin oxide and antimony oxide; conductivity enhancer such<br>
as carbon black and tin oxide; and surface-treated products thereof. These<br>
additives may be used alone or in combination; the amount is preferably 0.1<br>
to 10 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the toner.<br>
The charge control agent and the release agent may be melted and<br>
kneaded with a master batch and/ or binder resin or may be dissolved into an<br>
organic solvent and dispersed.<br>
The charge control agent and the release agent may be added<br>
externally to the toner by wet processes using solvents or water and optional<br>
active agents besides dry processes using Henschel mixers or Q mixers.<br>
In the mixing process of the external additives, a dry mixing may be<br>
carried out while dispersing and coating the external additive onto toner<br>
surface by way of stirring a mixture of a toner material and the additive<br>
using mixers. In such a process, it is important that the additive of<br>
inorganic or resin fine particles is attached uniformly and firmly onto the<br>
toner material in view of higher durability. For the purpose, such conditions<br>
are typically important, as blade shape of mixers, rotation frequency, mixing<br>
period, mixing times, external additive amount, toner material amount,<br>
surface properties of toner material like irregularity, hardness and<br>
viscoelasticity.<br><br>
The wet processes may apply inorganic file particles on toners in<br>
liquid media. This process may be carried out after toner particles are<br>
produced in water and the used surfactants are washed away. Excessive<br>
surfactants are removed through solid-liquid separating processes, then the<br>
resulting cake or slurry is dispersed again into aqueous media. The<br>
inorganic fine particles are added and dispersed into the slurry; alternatively,<br>
the fine particles may be dispersed previously into the aqueous water.<br>
When a reverse-polarity surfactant is added into the aqueous media, the<br>
inorganic fine particles may attach the surface of toner particles more<br>
efficiently. In cases where the inorganic fine particles are<br>
hydrophobictreated and hardly dispersible into aqueous media, an<br>
additional small amount of alcohols may decrease the surface tension thus<br>
make the inorganic fine particles more wettable and dispersible. The<br>
reverse-polarity surfactant is then added gradually into the aqueous media<br>
with stirring. The amount of the reverse polarity surfactant is preferably<br>
0.01 to 1% by mass based on the solid content of toner particles. The<br>
addition of the reverse-polarity surfactant may neutralize the charge of the<br>
inorganic fine particle dispersion in the aqueous media, which allowing the<br>
inorganic fine particles to coagulate and attach onto the toner surface. The<br>
amount of the inorganic fine particles is preferably 0.01 to 5% by mass base<br>
on the solid content of toner particles.<br>
The inorganic fine particles, attaching to the toner surface, may be<br><br>
then fixed on the toner surface through heating the slurry thereby be<br>
prevented from the separation. Preferably, the heating of the slurry is<br>
carried out at higher than Tg of the resin in the toner, and/or after drying<br>
while preventing agglomeration thereof.<br>
The inventive toner may be incorporated a metal stearate as a<br>
lubricant in order to reduce friction coefficient of photoconductor surface and<br>
to improve cleaning ability. Preferably, the metal stearate is zinc stearate.<br>
Toner Production Process<br>
The inventive toner for developing electrostatic images may be<br>
produced through conventional milling and polymerizing processes,<br>
specifically, air-flow milling, mechanical milling, emulsion-agglomeration,<br>
and suspension-polymerization processes; substantially any processes may<br>
derive the inventive effects.<br>
In conventional kneading-milling processes to produce toners, the<br>
constitutional ingredients of toners are dry-mixed, and melted-kneaded, then<br>
finely milled by use of jet mills etc., followed by air-classifying, thereby toners<br>
may be produced with a volume average particle diameter of 2 to 10 μm.<br>
The volume average particle diameter may be determined by Coulter<br>
counter (article name: Multitizer III, by Beckman Coulter, Inc.).<br>
The processes for producing the inventive toner may be by<br>
conventional ones; specifically, the inventive toner may be produced by a<br>
process that comprises a step of mechanically mixing toner ingredients such<br><br>
as a binder resin, a charge control agent and colorant, a step of melting and<br>
kneading the mixture, a step of milling, and a step of classifying. The<br>
powders other than those adapted to milling or classifying steps may be<br>
recycled to the step of mechanically mixing or melting-kneading.<br>
The powders (by-product) other than those adapted to milling or<br>
classifying steps mean fine or coarse particles that are out of desirable<br>
particle diameters after milling steps followed by a melting-kneading step or<br>
out of desirable particle diameters after the following classifying steps. The<br>
amount of the byproduct is preferably 1 to 20 parts by mass based on 100<br>
parts by mass of the essential ingredients in the melting-kneading step.<br>
The mixing step to mechanically mix the toner ingredients such as<br>
binder resins, colorants, resin charge control agents, and other charge control<br>
agents or the mixing step to mechanically mix the toner ingredients such as<br>
binder resins, colorants and resin charge control agents with by-products<br>
may be carried out under usual conditions using conventional mixers with<br>
rotatable blades.<br>
After the mixing step, the mixture is put into a melting kneader to<br>
melt and knead. The melting kneader may be mono-axis or two-axis<br>
continuous kneaders or batch kneaders with roll mills; preferable examples<br>
thereof include KTK type two-axis extruder (by Kobe Steel, Ltd.), TEM type<br>
two-axis extruder (by Toshiba Machine Co.), two-axis extruder (by KCK Co.),<br>
PCM type two-axis extruder (by Ikegai Ltd.), and Co-kneader (by Buss Co.).<br><br>
It is important that the melting-kneading step is carried out under<br>
appropriate conditions far from cutoff of molecular chains in binder resins.<br>
Specifically, the melting-kneading temperature is adjusted referring to the<br>
softening point of the binder resin,' when the temperature is excessively<br>
lower than the softening point, the cutoff will be significant, and excessively<br>
high temperature results in poor dispersion.<br>
The kneaded product is milled after the step of melting-kneading.<br>
Preferably, the material is roughly milled then finely milled in the milling<br>
step. Preferable milling processes are exemplified by making the materials<br>
collide with a plate by means of jet air, making particles collide each other by<br>
means of jet air, or pulverizing by use of a narrow gap between mechanically<br>
rotating rotors and stators. After the milling step, the milled product is<br>
classified in an air flow by use of centrifugal force, thereby to produce a<br>
developer having a predetermined particle diameter of 5 to 20 μm for<br>
example.	In order to improve the flowability, storage stability,<br>
developing property, and transferring property of toner, inorganic fine<br>
particles such as hydrophobic silica fine particles may be further added and<br>
mixed to the resulting toner base particles. The external additives may be<br>
mixed using conventional powder mixers, preferably, the mixers are<br>
equipped with a jacket etc. to adjust the inside temperature. The load<br>
history on the additives may be changed by intermediate or gradual<br>
additions of external additives, or rotation number, rolling rate, rolling time,<br><br>
temperature, etc., or a high load is firstly applied and then a weak load is<br>
applied, or vice versa. Examples of the mixing equipments include Vtype<br>
mixers, rocking mixers, Loedige mixers, Nauta mixers, and Henschel mixers.<br>
The inventive toner with the inventive toner binder resin may be<br>
employed as a two-component developer for electrostatic latent images by<br>
way of mixing with carrier particles of ferrites etc. optionally coated with<br>
magnetic powders such as of iron, nickel, ferrite and magnetite; glass beads<br>
and/or resins such as acrylic resins and silicone resins. The inventive toner<br>
may form electrostatic latent images by fractioning with charging blades or<br>
other members in place of carrier particles.<br>
Then the latent images are fixed by conventional heat roll-fixing<br>
processes on supports such as paper and polyester films.<br>
In recent years, the particle diameter of toners has been reduced still<br>
more to form highly precise images. One way to reduce the diameter may<br>
be on the basis of conventional mixing, melting and milling processes,<br>
however, these processes lead to considerably expensive cost from the<br>
viewpoint of energy and yield and also may be limited to reduce the diameter<br>
still further in view of a minimum limit attainable by milling processes.<br>
For the countermeasure, toner production processes have been<br>
proposed on the basis of suspension polymerization, emulsion polymerization,<br>
dispersion polymerization processes, etc.<br>
The toner for inventive image forming apparatuses is produced by<br><br>
dispersing a polyester prepolymer with a nitrogen-containing functional<br>
group, a polyester resin, a colorant, and a release agent into an organic<br>
solvent to prepare a toner material liquid, then which is subjected to<br>
crosslinking or extending reaction in an aqueous solvent. The polyester<br>
resin is an inventive polycondensation polyester resin. The constitutive<br>
materials and production process of these toners will be explained in the<br>
following.<br>
Modified Polyester<br>
The toner of the present invention comprises a modified polyester (i)<br>
as a binder resin. A modified polyester indicates a polyester in which a<br>
combined group other than ester bond may reside in a polyester resin, and<br>
different resin components are combined into a polyester resin through a<br>
covalent bond, ionic bond or the like. Specifically, a modified polyester is<br>
one where a functional group such as an isocyanate group or the like, which<br>
reacts with a carboxylic acid group and a hydrogen group, is introduced to a<br>
polyester end and further reacted to an active hydrogen-containing<br>
compound to modify the polyester end.<br>
Examples of the modified polyester (i) include a urea modified<br>
polyester which is obtained by a reaction between a polyester prepolymer (A)<br>
having an isocyanate group and amines (B). Examples of the polyester<br>
prepolymer (A) having an isocyanate group include a polyester prepolymer,<br>
which is a polycondensation polyester of a polyvalent alcohol (PO) and a<br><br>
polyvalent carboxylic acid (PC) and having an active hydrogen group, is<br>
further reacted with a polyvalent isocyanate compound (PIC). Examples of<br>
the active hydrogen group involved into the above-noted polyester include a<br>
hydroxyl group (an alcoholic hydroxyl group and a phenolic hydroxyl group),<br>
an amino group, a carboxyl group, and a mercapto group. Among these<br>
groups, an alcoholic hydroxyl group is preferable.<br>
The urea-modified polyester may be formed in the following manner.<br>
Examples of the polyvalent alcohol compound (PO) include divalent alcohols<br>
(DIO), and trivalent or more polyvalent alcohols (TO), and any of a divalent<br>
alcohol (DIO) alone and a mixture of a divalent alcohol (DIO) with a small<br>
amount of a polyvalent alcohol (TO) are preferable. Examples of the<br>
divalent alcohol (DIO) include alkylene glycols such as ethylene glycol,<br>
1,2-propylene glycol, 1,3-propylene glycol, 1,4-bytandiol, and 1,6'hexanediol;<br>

alicyclic diols such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, and butylene oxide;<br>
and alkylene oxide adducts of the above-noted bisphenols such as ethylene<br>
oxide, propylene oxide, and butylene oxide. Among the above mentioned, an<br>
alkylene glycol having carbon number of 2 to 12 and an alkylene oxide<br><br>
adduct of bisphenols are preferable, and an alkylene oxide adduct of<br>
bisphenols and a combination of the adduct with an alkylene glycol having a<br>
carbon number of 2 to 12 are particularly preferable. Examples of the<br>
trivalent or more polyvalent alcohol (TO) include a polyaliphatic alcohol of<br>
trivalent to octavalent or more such as glycerine, trimethylol ethane,<br>
trimethylol propane, pentaerythritol, and sorbitol; and trivalent or more<br>
phenols such as trisphenol PA, phenol novolac, and cresol novolac; and<br>
alkylene oxide adduct of the trivalent or more polyphenols.<br>
Examples of the polyvalent carboxylic acid (PC) include a divalent<br>
carboxylic acid (DIC) and a trivalent or more polyvalent carboxylic acid (TC),<br>
and any of a divalent carboxylic acid (DIC) alone and a mixture of a divalent<br>
carboxylic acid (DIC) with a small amount of a polyvalent carboxylic acid<br>
(TC) are preferable. Examples of the divalent carboxylic acid (DIC) include<br>
alkylene dicarboxylic acids such as succinic acid, adipic acid, and sebacic<br>
acid; alkenylen dicarboxylic acids such as maleic acid and fumaric acid;<br>
aromatic dicarboxylic acids such as phthalic acid, isophthalic acid,<br>
terephthalic acid, and naphthalene dicarboxylic acid. Among these divalent<br>
carboxylic acids, an alkenylen dicarboxylic acid having a carbon number of 4<br>
to 20 and an aromatic dicarboxylic acid having a carbon number of 8 to 20<br>
are preferable. Examples of the trivalent or more polyvalent carboxylic acid<br>
(TC) include an aromatic polyvalent carboxylic acid having a carbon number<br>
of 9 to 20 such as trimellitic acid, and pyromellitic acid. A polyvalent<br><br>
carboxylic acid (PC), an acid anhydride from among the polyvalent carboxylic<br>
acids or a lower alkyl ester such as methyl ester, ethyl ester, and isopropyl<br>
ester may be reacted with a polyvalent alcohol (PO).<br>
The ratio of a polyvalent alcohol (PO) to a polyvalent carboxylic acid<br>
(PC), defined as an equivalent ratio [OH]/[COOH] of a hydroxyl group [OH]<br>
to a carboxyl group [COOH], is typically 2/1 to 1/1, preferably 1.5/1 to 1/1,<br>
and more preferably 1.3/1 to 1.02/1.<br>
Examples of the polyvalent isocyanate compound (PIC) include<br>
aliphatic polyvalent isocyanates such as tetramethylen diisocyanate,<br>
hexamethylen diisocyanate, and 2,6'diisocyanate methyl caproate; alicyclic<br>

the above noted polyisocyanate is blocked with a phenol derivative, an oxime,<br>
caprolactam, and the like; and a combination of two or more elements<br>
thereof.<br>
The ratio of a polyvalent isocyanate compound (PIC), defined as an<br>
equivalent ratio [NCO]/[OH] of an isocyanate group [NCO] to a hydroxyl<br>
group [OH] of a polyester having a hydroxyl group, is typically 5/1 to 1/1,<br>
preferably 4/1 to 1.2/1, and more preferably 2.5/1 to 1.5/1. When<br>
[NCO]/[OH] is more than 5, low-temperature image fixability is often poor.<br><br>
When a urea modified polyester is used in the molar ratio of [NCO] is less<br>
than 1, the urea content of ester becomes lower, which making hot-offset<br>
resistance insufficient.<br>
The component content of polyvalent isocyanate compound (PIC) of a<br>
polyester prepolymer having an isocyanate group (A) is typically 0.5 to 40%<br>
by mass, preferably 1 to 30% by mass, and more preferably 2 to 20% by mass.<br>
When less than 0.5% by mass, hot-offset resistance is insufficient and there<br>
appear a disadvantage in the compatibility between hot storage resistance<br>
and low-temperature image fixability. On the other hand, when it is more<br>
than 40wt%, low-temperature image fixability tends to be poor.<br>
The number of isocyanate groups contained per one molecular of<br>
polyester prepolymer having isocyanate group (A) is typically 1 or more,<br>
preferably 1.5 to 3 in average, and more preferably 1.8 to 2.5 in average.<br>
When the number of isocyanate groups is less than 1 per one molecular of<br>
polyester prepolymer, the molecular weight of the urea modified polyester<br>
becomes lower, which making hot-offset resistance poor.<br>
Examples of amines (B) to be reacted with the polyester prepolymer<br>
(A) include a divalent amine compound (Bl), a trivalent or more polyvalent<br>
amine compound (B2), an aminoalcohol (B3), an amino mercaptan (B4), an<br>
amino acid (B5), and a compound in which the amino group of Bl to B5 is<br>
blocked (B6).<br>
Examples of the divalent amine compound (Bl) include aromatic<br><br>
diamines such as phenylene diamine, diethyl toluene diamine, 4,4'-diamino<br>
diphenyl methane; alicychc diamines such as 4,4'-diamincr3,3'-dimethyl<br>
dicyclohexyl methane, diamine cyclohexane, and isophorone diamine; and<br>
aliphatic diamines such as ethylene diamine, tetramethylene diamine, and<br>
hexamethylene diamine. Examples of the trivalent or more polyvalent<br>
amine compound (B2) include diethylene triamine and triethylene tetramine.<br>
Examples of the aminoalcohol (B3) include ethanol amine, and<br>
hydroxyethylaniline. Examples of the amino mercaptan (B4) include<br>
aminoethyl mercaptan and aminopropyl mercaptan. Examples of the<br>
amino acid (B5) include aminopropionic acid, aminocaproic acid, and the like.<br>
Examples of the compound, in which the amino group of B1 to B5 is blocked<br>
(B6), include a ketimine compound obtained from the above-noted amines of<br>
Bl to B5 and ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, and methyl<br>
isobuthyl ketone and oxazolidine compound, and the like. Among these<br>
amines (B), a divalent amine compound Bl and a mixture of Bl with a small<br>
amount of a trivalent or more polyvalent amine compound (B2) are<br>
preferable.<br>
The ratio of amines (B), defined as an equivalent ratio [NCO]/[NHx]<br>
of isocyanate group [NCO] in a polyester prepolymer having isocyanate<br>
group (A) to amine group [NHx] in amines (B), is typically 1/2 to 2/1,<br>
preferably 1.5/1 to 1/1.5, and more preferably 1.2/1 to 1/1.2. When<br>
[NCO]/[NHx] is more than 2 or less than 1/2, the molecular weight of urea<br><br>
modified polyester becomes lower, which making hot-offset resistance<br>
degrade.<br>
In addition, the urea modified polyester may include a urethane<br>
bond as well as a urea bond. A molar ratio of the urea bond content to the<br>
urethane bond content is typically 100/0 to 10/90, preferably 80/20 to 20/80,<br>
and more preferably 60/40 to 30/70. When a molar ratio of the urea bond is<br>
less than 10%, hot-offset resistance may degrade.<br>
The modified polyester (i) used in the present invention is<br>
manufactured by one-shot methods or prepolymer methods. The weight<br>
average molecular weight of the modified polyester (i) is typically 10000 or<br>
more, preferably 20000 to 10,000,000, and more preferably 30000 to<br>
1,000,000. The molecular weight peak is preferably 1000 to 10000, and<br>
when less than 1000, it is hard to undergo an elongation reaction and the<br>
toner elasticity is low, which making hot-offset resistance poor. When the<br>
molecular weight peak is more than 10000, it may cause degradation of<br>
fixability and may bring hard challenges in manufacturing in yielding toner<br>
fine particles and in toner grinding. The number average molecular weight<br>
of the modified polyester (i) when used together with an unmodified polyester<br>
(ii), which will be hereafter described, may be a number average molecular<br>
weight which is easily obtained to be used with the above-noted weight<br>
average molecular weight. When a modified polyester (i) is used alone, the<br>
number average molecular weight is typically 20000 or less, preferably 1000<br><br>
to 10000, and more preferably 2000 to 8000. When the number average<br>
molecular weight is more than 20000, low-temperature image fixability and<br>
glossiness when used in a full-color device become poor.<br>
In cross-linking and/or elongation reactions of a polyester prepolymer<br>
(A) and amines (B) in order to obtain a modified polyester (i), a reaction<br>
stopper may be used as required to control the molecular weight of a urea<br>
modified polyester to be obtained. Examples of the reaction stopper include<br>
a monoamine such as diethyl amine, dibutyl amine, buthyl amine, and lauryl<br>
amine, and a compound in which the above-noted elements are blocked.<br>
The molecular weight of the resulting polymer can be measured by<br>
means of gel permeation chromatography (GPC), using a tetrahydrofuran<br>
(THF) solvent.<br>
Unmodified Polyester<br>
In the present invention, not only the modified polyesters but also<br>
unmodified polyesters (ii) may be included together with the modified<br>
polyester (i) as binder resin components. The unmodified polyester (ii) in<br>
combination with a modified polyester (i) is preferred to the modified<br>
polyester (i) alone, because low-temperature image fixability and glossiness<br>
may be improved when in a full-color device. Examples of the unmodified<br>
polyester (ii) include a polycondensation polyester of a polyvalent alcohol<br>
(PO) and a polyvalent carboxylic acid (PC), and the like, same as in the<br>
modified polyester (i) components. Preferable compounds thereof are also<br><br>
the same as in the modified polyester (i). As for the unmodified polyester<br>
(ii), in addition to an unmodified polyester, it may be a polymer which is<br>
modified by a chemical bond other than urea bonds, for example, it may be<br>
modified by a urethane bond. It is preferable that at least a part of modified<br>
polyester (i) is compatible with part of an unmodified polyester (ii), from the<br>
aspect of low-temperature image fixability and hot-offset resistance. Thus,<br>
it is preferable that the composition of the modified polyester (i) is similar to<br>
that of the unmodified polyester (ii). A weight ratio of a modified polyester<br>
(i) to an unmodified polyester (ii) when an unmodified polyester (ii) being<br>
included, is typically 5/95 to 80/20, preferably 5/95 to 30/70, more preferably<br>
5/95 to 25/75, and still more preferably 7/93 to 20/80. When the weight ratio<br>
of a modified polyester (i) is less than 5%, it makes hot-offset resistance<br>
degraded and brings about disadvantages in compatibility between heat<br>
resistant storage properties and low-temperature image fixability.<br>
The molecular weight peak of the unmodified polyester (ii) is<br>
typically 1000 to 10000, preferably 2000 to 8000, and more preferably 2000 to<br>
5000. When the molecular weigh peak of the unmodified polyester (ii) is<br>
less than 1000, hot storage stability may degrade, and when more than<br>
10000, low-temperature image fixability may degrade. The hydroxyl value<br>
of the unmodified polyester (ii) is preferably 5 mgKOH/g or more, more<br>
preferably 10 to 120 mgKOH/g, and still more preferably 20 to 80 mgKOH/g.<br>
When the value is less than 5 mgKOH/g, it brings about disadvantages in the<br><br>
compatibility between hot storage stability and low-temperature fixability.<br>
The acid number of the unmodified polyester (ii) is preferably 1 to 5<br>
mgKOH/g, and more preferably 2 to 4 mgKOH/g. Since a wax with a high<br>
acid value is used, as for the binder, the binder is easily matched with the<br>
toner used in a two-component developer, because such a binder leads to<br>
charging and a high volume resistivity. The glass transition temperature<br>
(Tg) of the binder resin is typically 35°C to 70°C, and preferably 55°C to 65°C.<br>
When less than 35°C, the hot storage stability degrades, and when more<br>
than 70°C, low temperature fixability becomes insufficient. The toner of the<br>
present invention shows a proper hot storage stability even with a low glass<br>
transition temperature, compared to a toner made from conventional<br>
polyesters, because a urea modified polyester easily exists on the surface of<br>
particles of the toner base to be obtained. The glass transition temperature<br>
(Tg) can be measured using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC).<br>
The toner may be properly selected in terms of the shape, size, etc.<br>
depending on the application; preferably, the toner has the flowing volume<br>
average particle diameter, ratio of volume average particle diameter to<br>
number average particle diameter (volume average particle<br>
diameter/number average particle diameter), average circularity, shape<br>
factors SF-1 and SF-2, glass transition temperature, agglomeration degree,<br>
volume resistivity and apparent density.<br>
Preferably, the inventive toner has a volume average particle<br><br>
diameter of 2.0 to 10.0 μm, preferably 3.0 to 7.0 μm, more preferably 3.0 to<br>
5.0 μm. The ratio of (Dv/Dn) is 1.00 to 1.40, preferably 1.00 to 1.30, more<br>
preferably 1.00 to 1.20, wherein Dv means a volume average particle<br>
diameter and Dn means a number average particle diameter.<br>
In general, toners of smaller particle diameters may deposit precisely<br>
over electrostatic images. However, volume average diameters smaller than<br>
the range in cases of two-component developers may lead to toner fusion on<br>
the surface of magnetic carriers under prolonged stirring in developing<br>
apparatuses and poor charging ability of the magnetic carriers. On the<br>
other hand, the toner having a volume average particle diameter over the<br>
inventive range may make difficult to take high-resolution and high quality<br>
images, and also the particle diameter of toner often fluctuates along with<br>
inflow and outflow of toners.<br>
Further, narrower particle diameter distribution of toners may lead<br>
to uniform charge distribution, high quality images with less background fog,<br>
and higher transfer rate. However, Dv/Dn above 1.40 undesirably tends to<br>
broaden the charge distribution to decrease the resolution.<br>
Preferably, the content of fine particles of no larger than 4 μm is 0 to<br>
20% by number, and the content of coarse particles of no larger than 12.7 μm<br>
is 0 to 3% by number.<br>
The average particle diameter and the particle diameter distribution<br>
of toners can be measured using Coulter Counter TA-II, and Coulter<br><br>
Multisizer II (by Beckman Coulter, Inc.). In the present invention, Coulter<br>
Counter TA-II model was used with connecting an interface (by The Institute<br>
JUSE) and a personal computer (PC9801, by NEC Co.) which outputs<br>
number distributions and volume distributions.<br>
Preferably, the inventive toner has a shape factor SF-1 of 100 to 180,<br>
more preferably 100 to 150. The shape factor SF-2 is preferably 100 to 180,<br>
more preferably 100 to 160.<br>
FIGs. 2A and 2B and FIGs. 3A to 3C are schematic views of a toner<br>
particle to explain shape factors SF-1 and SF-2. The shape factor SF-1<br>
represents a circular level of toner shape, which is calculated from Equation<br>
(1), in which the maximum length MXLNG (see FIG. 2A) of the toner image<br>
projected on two-dimensional plane is squared, then divided by the area<br>
value of AEEA and multiplied by 100n/4.<br>
SF-1=[(MXLNG)2/AREA]x(l00n/4) Equation (l)<br>
The SF-1 value of 100 corresponds to exact sphere, the larger is the<br>
SF-1 the shape is more different from exact sphere.<br>
The shape factor SF-2 represents an irregularity of toner shape,<br>
which is calculated from Equation (2), in which the peripheral length PERI of<br>
the toner image projected on two-dimensional plane is squared, then divided<br>
by the area value of AREA and multiplied by 100/4n.<br>
SF-2= [(RERI)VAREA]x(100/4n) Equation (2)<br>
The SF-2 value of 100 corresponds to non-irregular shape of toner<br><br>
surface, the larger is the SF-2 the more irregular is the surface shape.<br>
When the toner shape comes to sphere, the contact area between<br>
toner particles or between toner particles and photoconductors comes to<br>
narrow like a spot contact; consequently, the adsorptivity comes to lower<br>
between toner particles, the flowability comes to higher, the adsorptivity<br>
comes to lower between toner particles and photoconductors, and the<br>
transfer rate comes to higher. On the other hand, SF-1 and SF-2 preferably<br>
have a somewhat higher value from the viewpoint that spherical toner<br>
particles easily enter into a space between cleaning blades and<br>
photoconductors. In addition, excessively large values with respect to SF-1<br>
and SF-2 tend to bring about lower image quality due to higher toner<br>
scattering on images, thus SF-1 and SF-2 are preferred to be no more than<br>
180.<br>
Specifically, SF-1 and SF-2 were determined by way of taking<br>
pictures using a scanning electron microscope S-800 (by Hitachi, Ltd.) and<br>
analyzing the pictures using an image analyzer Luzex AP (by Nireco Co.).<br>
It is preferred for stable color reproducibility in the present invention<br>
that the toner is of spindle shape, and the spindle shape may be defined by a<br>
long axis rl, a short axis r2, and a thickness r3 (r1 ≥ r2 ≥ r3), the ratio r2/r1<br>
is 0.5 to 1.0, and r3/r2 is 0.7 to 1.0.<br>
FIGs. 3A to 3C schematically show the toner shape. When a toner<br>
having an approximately spherical shape, as shown in FIG. 3, is defined by a<br><br>
long axis r1, a short axis r2, and a thickness r3 (r1 ≥ r2≥ r3), it is preferred in<br>
the present invention that the ratio of short axis to long axis (r2/rl) is 0.5 to<br>
1.0 (see FIG. 3B), and the ratio of thickness to short axis (r3/r2) is 0.7 to 1.0<br>
(see FIG. 30. The ratio r2/rl of below 0.5 may result in poor dot<br>
reproducibility and low transfer efficiency and be far from high quality<br>
images due to departing from spherical shape. The ratio r3/r2 of below 0.7<br>
may be far from higher transfer efficiencies like those of spherical toners due<br>
to almost flat shape. When the ratio r3/r2 is 1.0, the toner flowability may<br>
be enhanced in particular by virtue of the rotatable shape with a long axis as<br>
the rotating axis.<br>
The rl, r2 and r3 were determined from observation of photographs<br>
with various view angles using a scanning electron microscope (SEM).<br>
It is preferred that the toner has an average circularity of 0.94 or<br>
more and below 1.00, more preferably 0.96 to 0.99. The average circularity<br>
of 0.94 or more may favorably lead to excellent dot reproducibility and less<br>
fluctuation of color reproducibility at narrow line images in particular.<br>
Moreover, the proper transfer ability may advantageously bring about high<br>
quality images; the higher average circularity may bring about uniform<br>
development, transfer and distribution with less adhesion of toner<br>
agglomerates at half tone or solid portions. Consequently, uniform<br>
intermediate colors may be reproduced with less color polarization after<br>
superimposing toners as color overlapping. It is difficult to take high<br><br>
quality images with sufficient transfer ability and without scattering from<br>
the toner far from spherical shape with an average circularity of less than<br>
0.94. These irregular particles may provide many contacting points with<br>
smooth surface such as of photoconductors, and concentrate charges at<br>
projecting tips, thus exhibit higher adhesive force than relatively spherical<br>
particles due to van der Waals force or mirror image force. Therefore,<br>
spherical particles among irregular particles and spherical particles within<br>
toners are selectively transferred in the electrostatic transfer steps, resulting<br>
in voids at letter or line images. In addition, residual toners should be<br>
removed for the subsequent developing steps, which resulting in such<br>
problems that cleaning devices are necessary or toner yield (the rate of toners<br>
for image formation) is lower.<br>
It is preferred that the rate of toner particles having an average<br>
circularity of below 0.93 is no more than 30%. Toners with the rate of above<br>
30%, i.e. higher fluctuation of circularity, are undesirable since the charging<br>
velocity or level comes to broad and the distribution of charge amount is<br>
broad.<br>
The average circularity of the toner is a value obtained by optically<br>
detecting toner particles, and the circumferential length of a circle that has<br>
an area equivalent to the projection area of the toner is divided by a<br>
circumferential length of an actual toner particle; specifically, the average<br>
circularity of the toner is measured using a flow particle image analyzer<br><br>
(FPIA-2000, by Sysmex Corp.). Pure water of 100 to 150 mL is poured into<br>
a vessel, to which 0.1 mL to 0.5 mL of a surfactant and 0.1 to 9.5 g of a<br>
sample are added. The suspension with the sample is dispersed for about 1<br>
to 3 minutes using an ultrasonic device to adjust the concentration into 3000<br>
to 10000 /μL then to measure the shape and the distribution of the toner<br>
sample.<br>
The agglomeration degree of toners is preferably 1% to 25%, more<br>
preferably 3% to 15%. The measurement of the agglomeration degree is<br>
carried out as follows using a powder tester (by Hosokawa Micron Co.) as the<br>
measuring device, the attachment parts are set on a vibrating table<br>
according to the following procedures.<br>
(i) vibro-shoot<br>
(ii) packing<br>
(iii) space ring<br>
(iv) screens (three types) upper &gt; middle &gt; lower<br>
(v) pressing bar<br>
The screens are fixed by knob nuts, the vibrating table is operated<br>
with the conditions below:<br>
screen opening (upper): 75μm<br>
screen opening (middle): 45 μm<br>
screen opening (lower) : 22 μm<br>
vibration amplitude :1 mm<br><br>
sample mass : 2 g<br>
vibrating period: 15 seconds<br>
The agglomeration degree is calculated as follows after the operation,<br>
mass of powder on the upper screen x 1: (a)<br>
mass of powder on the middle screen x 0.6 : (b)<br>
mass of powder on the lower screen x 0.2 : (c)<br>
The total of these three values is defined as the agglomeration degree<br>
(%); i.e. agglomeration degree (%) = (a) + (b) + (c).<br>
It is preferred that the toner has a loose apparent density of 0.2 to<br>
0.7 g/mL. The loose apparent density may be measured by a powder tester<br>
PT-S (by Hosokawa Micron Co.).<br>
It is preferred that the toner has a volume resistivity of 8 to 15 Log<br>
ohnvcm, more preferably 9 to 13 Log ohnvcm.<br>
The volume resistivity is measured by way of pressing a toner into a<br>
pellet, the pellet is placed between parallel electrodes with a gap of 2 mm,<br>
then DC 1000 volts is applied between the electrodes, the resistivity is<br>
measured after 30 seconds by a high resist meter (e.g., TR8601, by Advantest<br>
Co.), then the volume resistivity is calculated as a logarithmic value from the<br>
measured resistivity and the pellet thickness.<br>
It is preferred that the toner has a softening point of 80°C to 180°C,<br>
more preferably 90°C to 130°C. The softening temperature of the toner is<br>
defined as the temperature at which the flow amount comes to the half under<br><br>
the conditions below in a constant temperature-raising rate.<br>
device : flow tester CTF-500D (by Shimadzu Co.)<br>
load: 20 kfg/cm2<br>
die : 1 mm Φ to 1 mm<br>
temperature-rising rate :6°C/min<br>
sample mass : 1.0 g<br>
It is preferred that the toner has a glass transition temperature Tg of<br>
35°C to 90°C, more preferably 45°C to 70°C. The glass transition<br>
temperature Tg of the toner may be measured under the following<br>
conditions.<br>
differential scanning calorimeter : Seiko 1D SC100, Seiko 1SSC5040<br>
(disc station)<br>
measuring conditions: temperature range of 25°C to 150°C,<br>
temperature-rising rate of 10°C/min, sampling period of 0.5 second, sampling<br>
amount: 10 mg<br>
Toner Kit<br>
The inventive toner kit comprises the inventive toners of at least a<br>
yellow toner, a magenta toner and a cyan toner. The magenta toner<br>
contains an organic pigment expressed by the following Structural Formula<br>
(1); the yellow toner contains an organic pigment having two units per<br>
molecule each expressed by Structural Skeleton (A) and no halogen atom.<br><br><br>
in the Structural Formula (l) and Structural Skeleton (A),<br>
=C=N-NH— encompasses =CH—N=N—.<br>
The inventive toner kit, which contains a polyester resin synthesized<br>
in the presence of a novel titanium-containing catalyst and specific yellow<br>
and magenta pigments, may effectively represent color reproducibility of<br>
images, in particular color reproducibility of intermediate red.<br>
The mechanism to improve the color reproducibility is not<br>
necessarily clear, but it is believed that the effective catalytic activity of the<br>
novel titanium-containing catalyst may achieve a condition of molecular<br>
chain and/or molecular mass distribution adequate for pigment dispersion.<br>
As a result, the energy for the pigment dispersed into the resin on toner<br>
production to re-agglomerate again will be reduced, which makes possible to<br>
maintain the dispersed condition and improves the color reproducibility at<br>
forming images.<br><br>
Organic pigments represented by Structural Formula (l) as the<br>
magenta toner are azo lake pigments. The pigments for the magenta toner<br>
have been azo pigments such as azo lake pigments and insoluble azo<br>
pigments; and organic pigments such as quinacridone polycyclic pigments.<br>
Azo pigments include naphthol pigments and oxynaphthoe acid pigments,<br>
and naphthol pigments such as C.I. PR49, C.I. PR68, and C.I. PR 184 have<br>
been used so far among them. The quinacridone pigments have been C.I.<br>
PR122, C.I. PR209, and C.I. PR206. The magenta toner used for the toner<br>
is an oxynaphthoe acid pigment of C.I. PR269 represented by Structural<br>
Formula (l). This pigment reproduces brilliant magenta colors due to the<br>
narrow absorption band at the wavelength of 500 nm to 600 nm.<br>
Specifically, when the ID (image density: -Log reflectivity) is set to<br>
1.00 measured by XRITE938 densitometer after fixing an image to recording<br>
media such as transfer sheets and film sheets using an observing light D50<br>
(JISZ-8720 (1983)) at a view angle of 2°, "a*" is 55 to 75 and "b*" is -8 to 0 in<br>
the color specification system of L*a*b* (CIE1976). These values are<br>
obtained through the use of uniform measurements in which color density is<br>
measured through a complementary color filter to keep the color density<br>
given to humans at a constant state. When "a*" is less than 55 or "b*" is<br>
less than 0, the color reproducibility degrades at intermediate colors when<br>
mixed with toners with other colors; and when "a*" is more than 75 or "b*" is<br>
more than -8, the amount of the pigment should be increased, which leading<br><br>
to higher opacifying power and similarly lower color reproducibility at<br>
intermediate colors when mixed with toners with other colors.<br>
The amount of the magenta toner of the organic pigment expressed<br>
by Structural Formula (l) is preferably 2 to 15% by mass, more preferably 3<br>
to 10% by mass.<br>
The yellow toner contains an organic pigment that contains an<br>
organic pigment having two units per molecule each expressed by Structural<br>
Skeleton (A) and no halogen atom. The organic pigment, having two units<br>
per molecule each expressed by Structural Skeleton (A) and no halogen atom,<br>
is preferably one expressed by Structural Formula (2) or (3) below.<br><br>
The yellow toner contains an organic pigment expressed by<br>
Structural Formula (2) and/or (3), the both are insoluble azo pigments. The<br>
yellow toner has been polycyclic organic pigments including acetoacetic acid<br><br>
allylid dis-azo pigments, acetoacetic acid imidazolon pigments, quinacridone<br>
pigments and threne pigments. Specifically, acetoacetic acid allylid dis-azo<br>
pigments of C.I. PY13 and C.I. PY17 have been widely used. The yellow<br>
toners employ the organic pigments expressed by Structural Formula (2), i.e.<br>
C.I. pigment yellow 180 disazo organic pigment and/or those by Structural<br>
Formula (3), i.e. C.I. pigment yellow 155 dis-azo organic. These pigments<br>
contain no halogen and reproduce brilliant yellow colors due to a narrow<br>
absorption band at wavelength of 400 to 500 nm.<br>
Specifically, when the ID is set to 1.00 measured by X-RITE938<br>
densitometer after fixing an image to recording media such as transfer<br>
sheets and film sheets using an observing light D50 (JISZ-8720 (1983)) at a<br>
view angle of 2°, "a*" is -2 to -22 and "b*" is 67 to 90 in the color<br>
specification system of L*a*b* (CIE1976). These values are obtained<br>
through the use of uniform measurements in which color density is<br>
measured through a complementary color filter to keep the color density<br>
given to humans at a constant state. When "a*" is less than -12 or "b*" is<br>
less than 67, the color reproducibility degrades at intermediate colors when<br>
mixed with toners with other colors; and when "a*" is more than -2 or "b*" is<br>
more than 90, the amount of the pigment should be increased, which leading<br>
to higher opacifying power and similarly lower color reproducibility at<br>
intermediate colors when mixed with toners with other colors.<br>
The mixture of the magenta toner and the yellow toner allows to<br><br>
reproduce red (R) colors. When the ID is 1.00 measured by X-RITE938<br>
densitometer after fixing an image using an observing light D50 (JISZ8720<br>
(1983)) at a view angle of 2°, "a*" is set to be 60 to 68 and "b*" is set to be 45<br>
to 55 in the color specification system of L*a*b*. The respective ranges of<br>
color reproducibility in the L*a*b* color specification system may be adjusted<br>
by the contents of the magenta toner and the yellow toner, the amount of<br>
adhered toner, and the color reproduction range of red colors may be widened<br>
from skin color to vermillion by virtue of the range. When "a*" is less than<br>
60 or "b*" is less than 45, the color reproducible range is narrow and various<br>
intermediate reds cannot be reproduced, and when "a*" is more than 68 or<br>
"b*" is more than 55, the amount of the pigment should be increased, which<br>
leading to higher opacifying power and similarly lower color reproducibility<br>
at intermediate colors.<br>
Reproduction of red colors is important when expressing humans<br>
and other things; however, the red color reproducibility has been poor<br>
compared to photographic papers or sublimation photographs particularly in<br>
cases of higher opacifying power since the reproducible range is narrow and<br>
organic pigments reduce the transparency. As such, the inventive image<br>
forming apparatus may broadly attain red color reproducibility by defining<br>
the color reproducible ranges with respect to organic pigments of both of<br>
magenta toner and yellow toner.<br>
The amount of the organic pigment, having two units per molecule<br><br>
each expressed by Structural Skeleton (A) and no halogen atom, is preferably<br>
3 to 20% by mass in the yellow toner, more preferably 5 to 15% by mass.<br>
It is preferred that the cyan toner contains a copper phthalocyanine<br>
pigment.<br>
It is preferred in the present invention that the layer of the magenta<br>
toner is formed under that of the yellow toner. The yellow pigment<br>
expressed by Structural Formula (2) or (3) in the inventive toner typically<br>
exhibits lower opacifying power thus is far from opacifying the underlying<br>
organic pigment. The organic pigments expressed by Structural Formula<br>
(2) or (3) described above have a narrower optical absorption range thus are<br>
far from disturbing the red color reproduction by the underlying magenta<br>
toner. Moreover, the magenta toner, containing the magenta pigment<br>
expressed by Structural Formula (l), under the yellow toner may provide red<br>
color reproducibility in a wide range.<br>
When a wax is incorporated into the toner of the inventive toner kit,<br>
the image surface tends to appear an orange surface, as a result, the rate of<br>
diffuse reflection increases such that the spectral reflectance at wavelength<br>
of 500 to 700 nm is increased in yellow toners, the spectral reflectance at<br>
wavelength of 400 to 500 nm is increased in magenta toners, and the spectral<br>
reflectance at wavelength of 400 to 600 nm is increased in yellow toners. As<br>
such, when reproducing colors by a sub tractive color mixing, increase of<br>
reflectance at wavelengths other than to be absorbed may improve the color<br><br>
reproducibility.<br>
The inventive toner kit may be favorably applied to image forming<br>
apparatuses that utilize yellow, cyan and magenta toners, and also black<br>
toners.<br>
Developer<br>
When the inventive toner is applied to two-component developers,<br>
the toner is mixed with a magnetic carrier. The amount of the toner is 1 to<br>
10 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of carriers.<br>
The magnetic carrier may be conventional ones such as iron powder,<br>
ferrite powder, magnetite powder, resin-coated magnetic carrier and glass<br>
beads having a particle diameter of 20 to 200 μm.<br>
Examples of the coating materials of the resin-coated magnetic<br>
carrier include phenol resins, amino resins, urea-formaldehyde resins,<br>
melamine resins, benzoguanamine resins, urea resins, polyamide resins,<br>

resins, polyvinyl alcohol resins, polyvinyl acetal resins, polyvinyl butyral<br>
resins, polystyrene resins, styrene-acrylic copolymer resins, halogenated<br>
olefin resins such as polyvinyl chloride resins and polyvinylidene chloride;<br>
polyester resins such as polyethylene terephthalate resins and polybuthylene<br>
terephthalate resins; polycarbonate resins, polyethylene resins,<br>
polyfluorocarbon, polyfluorovinylidene resins, polytrifluoroethylene resins,<br><br>

monomers, copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and vinyl fluoride, fluoro<br>
terpolymers such as those of tetrafluoroethylene, and vinylidene fluoride and<br>
other non-fluoride monomers, and silicone resins.<br>
Among these, silicone resin-coated carriers are excellent in view of<br>
carrier lifetime. Electrically conductive powers may be included into the<br>
coating resins as required. Examples of the electrically conductive powers<br>
include metal powders, carbon black, titanium oxide, tin oxide and zinc oxide.<br>
Preferably, these electrically conductive powers have an average particle<br>
diameter of no more than 1 μm since the diameter above 1 μm makes<br>
difficult to adjust the resistivity.<br>
In the two-component developers, the amount of the toner is<br>
preferably 0.5 to 20.0 parts by mass based on 100 parts of carriers.<br>
The inventive toner may be employed as a magnetic toner in<br>
one-component developers without carrier or as non-magnetic toners.<br>
Magnetic Material<br>
The inventive toner may be employed as a magnetic toner with a<br>
magnetic material. The magnetic toner may be prepared by incorporating<br>
magnetic fine particles into the toner particles. The magnetic materials are<br>
exemplified by ferromagnetic metals like iron, nickel and cobalt, alloys and<br>
compounds thereof such as iron oxide including ferrites, magnetites and<br>
hematites," alloys, which contain no ferromagnetic element but exhibit<br><br>
ferromagnetism through a appropriate heat treatment, such as Huesler<br>
alloys containing manganese and copper like MnCuAl and MnCu-Sn; and<br>
chromium dioxide etc.<br>
It is preferred that the magnetic material has an average particle<br>
diameter of 0.1 to 2 μm, more preferably 0.1 to 1 μm, and is uniformly<br>
dispersed as fine particles. The amount of the magnetic material is<br>
preferably 5 to 150 parts by mass based on 100 parts of toner, more<br>
preferably 10 to 70 parts by mass, still more preferably 20 to 50 parts by<br>
mass.<br>

a developing unit, a transferring unit, and a fixing unit and may further<br>
comprise other units suitably selected in accordance with the necessity such<br>
as a charge elimination unit, a cleaning unit, a recycling unit and a<br>
controlling unit.<br>
In the latent electrostatic image forming step, a latent electrostatic<br><br>
image is formed on a photoconductor.<br>
The latent electrostatic image bearing member (sometimes referred<br>
to as "electrophotographic photoconductor" or "photoconductor") may be<br>
properly selected in terms of material, shape, structure, size or the like, and<br>
may be suitably selected from conventional ones; the shape of the<br>
photoconductor is preferably drum-like; preferable examples of the material<br>
include amorphous silicon and selenium for inorganic photoconductors and<br>
polysilane and phthalopolymethine for organic photoconductors. Among<br>
these, amorphous silicon is preferable in view of longer operating life.<br>
The latent electrostatic images may be formed, for example, by<br>
charging the surface of the photoconductor uniformly and then exposing the<br>
surface thereof imagewisely by means of the latent electrostatic image<br>
forming unit. The latent electrostatic image forming unit is provided with,<br>
for example, at least a charger configured to uniformly charge the surface of<br>
the photoconductor, and an exposer configured to expose the surface of the<br>
photoconductor imagewisely.<br>
The surface of the photoconductor may be charged by applying a<br>
voltage to the surface of the photoconductor through the use of, for example,<br>
the charger.<br>
The charger may be properly selected depending on the application;<br>
examples thereof include conventional contact chargers which are equipped<br>
with a conductive or semi-conductive roller, a brush, a film, a rubber blade or<br><br>
the like, and non-contact chargers utilizing corona discharge such as<br>

optical systems, rod lens array systems, laser optical systems, and liquid<br>
crystal shutter optical systems.<br>
In the present invention, the back light method may be employed in<br>
which exposing is performed imagewisely from the back side of the<br>
photoconductor.<br>
Developing Step and Developing Unit<br>
The developing step is one in which the latent electrostatic image is<br>
developed using the developer of the present invention to form a visible<br>
image.<br>

electrostatic image using, for example, the developer in the developing unit.<br>
The developing unit may be properly selected from conventional ones<br>
in the art; preferable examples thereof include those having at least an<br>
image developing apparatus which houses the developer of the present<br>
invention therein and enables supplying the developer to the latent<br>
electrostatic image in a contact or a non-contact state; preferable example is<br><br>

The image developing unit may be of a dry developing process or a<br>
wet-developing process. It may be a monochrome developing unit or a<br>
multi-color developing unit. Preferred examples thereof include one having<br>

magnet roller.<br>
In the image developing apparatus, for example, a toner and the<br>
carrier are mixed and stirred, the toner is charged by frictional force at that<br>
time to be held in a state where the toner is standing on the surface of the<br>
rotating magnet roller to thereby form a magnetic brush. Since the magnet<br>
roller is located near the photoconductor, a part of the toner constituting the<br>
magnetic brush formed on the surface of the magnet roller moves to the<br>
surface of the photoconductor by electric attraction force. As the result, the<br>
latent electrostatic image is developed using the toner to form a visible toner<br>
image on the photoconductor surface.<br>
The developer in the developing unit is one that contains the<br>
inventive toner. The developer may be of one-component developer or<br>
two-component developer.<br>

In the transferring step, the visible image is transferred onto a<br>
recording medium, preferably, an intermediate transfer member is used, the<br>
visible image is primarily transferred to the intermediate transfer member<br><br>
and then the visible image is secondarily transferred onto the recording<br>

is still more preferably in which a full-color toner is used, and the<br>
embodiment includes a primary transferring in which the visible image is<br>
transferred to an intermediate transfer member to form a composite transfer<br>

The transferring may be performed, for example, by charging a<br>
visible image formed on the surface of the photoconductor using a<br>
transfer-charger to transfer the visible image, and this is enabled by means<br>
of the transferring unit. For the transferring unit, it is preferably an<br>
embodiment which includes a primary transferring unit configured to<br>
transfer the visible image to an intermediate transfer member to form a<br>
composite transfer image, and a secondary transferring unit configured to<br>
transfer the composite transfer image onto a recording medium.<br>
The intermediate transfer member may be properly selected from<br>
conventional ones; preferable examples thereof include transferring belts.<br>
The transferring unit (i.e. primary transferring unit and the<br>
secondary transferring unit) preferably includes at least an image-transferer<br>
configured to exfoliate and charge the visible image formed on the<br>
photoconductor to transfer the visible image onto the recording medium.<br><br>
The transferring unit may be of one part or two or more parts.<br>
Examples of the image transferer include corona transferers,<br>
transferring belts, transfer rollers, pressure transfer rollers, and adhesion<br>
transfer units. The recording medium may be properly selected from<br>

to 200°C.<br>
In the present invention, for example, an optical fixing apparatus<br>
known in the art may be used in the fixing step and the fixing unit or instead<br>
of the fixing unit.<br>
In the charge elimination step, the charge is eliminated by applying<br>
a charge-eliminating bias to the photoconductor, and it can be suitably<br>
performed by means of a charge -eliminating unit. The charge-eliminating<br><br>
unit may be properly selected from among conventional ones. For example,<br>
charge-eliminating lamps are preferable.<br>
In the cleaning step, a residual electrographic toner remaining on the<br>
photoconductor is removed, and the cleaning can be preferably performed<br>
using a cleaning unit. The cleaning unit may be properly selected from<br>
conventional ones; examples thereof include magnetic brush cleaners,<br>
electrostatic brush cleaners, magnetic roller cleaners, blade cleaners, brush<br>
cleaners, and web cleaners.<br>
In the recycling step, a step eliminated in the cleaning is recycled to<br>
the developing step, and the recycling can be suitably performed by means of<br>
a recycling unit. The recycling unit may be properly selected; examples<br>
thereof include conventional conveying or transporting units.<br>

recording media from a paper-feeding tray, and a fixing device configured to<br>
fix toners onto recording media after separating recording media, on which<br>
toner images being transferred, from the photoconductor. In the image<br>
forming apparatus of this configuration, the surface of the rotating<br><br>
photoconductor is uniformly charged by the charging unit then irradiated<br>
laser beams from an exposing unit based on image information to form a<br>
latent image on the photoconductor, to which then toners are deposited to<br>
form images.<br>
On the other hand, the recording media is conveyed from the paper<br>
feeding unit, and transported at a transfer site where the photoconductor<br>
and the transfer unit face each other. The transfer unit applies the charge<br>
of reverse polarity with toner images on the photoconductor, thereby the<br>
toner images on the photoconductor are transferred onto the recording media.<br>
Then the recording media is separated from the photoconductor and<br>
conveyed to a fixing device, where the toners are fixed on the recording<br>
media to form images.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic constitutional view of developing device 1 of<br>
this embodiment. The developing device 1 employed in the inventive image<br>
forming apparatus will be explained more specifically with reference to FIG.<br>
1. The developing device 1, which being disposed at a side of<br>
photoconductor 8, comprises a non-magnetic developing sleeve 7 that support<br>
a two-component developer (hereinafter, sometimes referred to as<br>
"developer") containing a toner and a magnetic carrier. The developing<br>
sleeve 7 is attached such that a portion thereof is exposed from an opening at<br>
a developing casing in the side of photoconductor 1, and is rotated to arrow<br>
"b" direction by a driving device (not shown). The material of the developing<br><br>
sleeve may be one used for conventional devices! examples thereof are<br>
stainless steel, aluminum, non-magnetic materials like ceramics, and coated<br>
materials thereof. The shape of the developing sleeves may also be properly<br>
selected. A magnet roller (not shown) of a magnetic-field generating unit is<br>
disposed inside the developing sleep. The developing unit 1 is equipped<br>
with a rigid doctor 9 as a developer-control member that controls the amount<br>
of the developer supported on the developing sleeve 7.<br>
In addition to the doctor 9, a developer container 4 is disposed at<br>
upstream of the rotating direction of the developing sleeve 7, the first and the<br>
second stirring screws 5, 6 are provide for mechanically stirring the<br>
developer in the developer container 4. Furthermore, a toner supply inlet<br>
23 disposed above the developer container 4, a toner hopper 2 for supplying<br>
toners to developer container 4, and a toner conveying 3 between the toner<br>
supply inlet 23 are provided.<br>
In the developing device 1, the developer in the container 4 is stirred,<br>
and the toner and the magnetic carrier are reversely friction-charged by<br>
rotating the first and the second stirring screws 5, 6. The developer is<br>
supplied to the circumferential surface of the developing sleeve 7 that is<br>
rotating toward arrow "b" direction, the developer is supported on the<br>
circumferential surface of the developing sleeve 7, and conveyed toward the<br>
rotating direction "b". The conveyed developer is then controlled for the<br>
amount by the doctor 9, then the controlled developer is conveyed to the<br><br>
developing site where the photoconductor 8 and the developing sleeve 7 face<br>
each other. The toner at the site is electrostatically transferred onto<br>
electrostatic latent images on the surface of the photoconductor, thereby the<br>
electrostatic images are visualized as toner images.<br>
The space of developing gap Gp between the photoconductor 8 and<br>
the developing sleeve 7 is preferably 0.01 to 0.7 mm. In cases where the<br>
space is less than 0.01 mm, it is possibly difficult to convey toners, decreasing<br>
uniformity of solid images, and in cases where the space is above 0.7 mm, the<br>
initial charging property and stability of developers are unfavorably<br>
deteriorated.<br>
Intermediate Transfer Body<br>
An embodiment of the intermediate transfer body will be explained<br>
with reference to FIG. 4. A charging roller 20, an exposing device 30, a<br>
cleaning device 60 with a cleaning blade, a charge eliminating device 70, a<br>
developing device 40 and an intermediate transfer body 50 are disposed<br>
around a photoconductor 10. The intermediate transfer body 50 is<br>
suspended by plural suspension rollers 51, and moves toward the arrow<br>
direction by driving means such as a motor (not shown) in a manner of an<br>
endless belt. One or more of the suspension rollers 51 has an additional role<br>
as a transfer bias roller, which supplies a transfer bias to the intermediate<br>
transfer body, and a power supply (not shown) applies a desired transfer bias<br>
voltage thereto. Additionally, a cleaning device 90 having a cleaning blade<br><br>
for the intermediate transfer body 50 is also arranged. Further, a transfer<br>
roller 80 is positioned feeing the intermediate transfer body 50 as transfer<br>
means to transfer a developed image to a sheet of support paper 100, which<br>
is the final support material. A power supply (not shown) applies a transfer<br>
bias voltage to the transfer roller 80. Moreover, corona charger 52 as a<br>
charging device is located by the intermediate transfer body 50.<br>
The image developer 40 comprises developing belt 41 as a developing<br>
agent support, a black (hereinafter Bk) developing unit 45K, yellow<br>
(hereinafter Y) developing unit 45Y, magenta (hereinafter M) developing unit<br>
45M, and cyan (hereinafter C) developing unit 45C, the developing units<br>
positioned around the developing belt 41. In addition, the developing belt<br>
41 is configured so that it is suspended by a plurality of belt rollers, and by<br>
driving means such as a motor or the like (not shown), is advanced to the<br>
direction of the arrow in a manner of an endless belt. The developing belt<br>
41 moves at substantially the same speed as the photoconductor 10 at the<br>
section where the two contact each other.<br>
Since the configurations of the developing units are common, only<br>
the Bk developing unit 45K will be described, and for other developing units<br>
45Y, 45M, and 45C, components that correspond to those in the Bk<br>
developing unit 45K are shown in the figure with the same reference<br>
numbers followed by a letter Y, M, and C, respectively, and their descriptions<br>
are omitted. The developing unit 45K comprises a developing tank 42K<br><br>
that contains a solution of developing agent of high viscosity and high<br>
density including toner particles and a carrier liquid component, a scooping<br>
roller 43K that is positioned so that its lower portion is dipped in the liquid<br>
developing agent within the developing tank 42K, and a applying roller 44K<br>
that receives the developing agent scooped by the scooping roller 43K makes<br>
a thin layer of the developing agent, and applies the developing agent to the<br>
developing belt 41. The applying roller 44K is electrically conductive, and a<br>
power supply (not shown) applies a desired bias thereto.<br>
With regards to the device configuration of the copier of this<br>
embodiment, a device configuration different from one shown in FIG. 4 may<br>
be employed in which a developing unit of each color is located around a<br>
photoconductor 10, as shown in FIG. 5.<br>
Next, the operation of the copier of embodiment will be described.<br>
In FIG. 1, the photoconductor 10 is rotationally driven in the direction of the<br>
arrow and is uniformly charged by the charging roller 20. Then, the<br>
exposing device 30 uses reflected light from the original document passing<br>
through an optical system (not shown) and forms an electrostatic latent<br>
image on the photoconductor 10. The electrostatic latent image is then<br>
developed by the image developer 40, and a toner image as a visualized<br>
(developed) image is formed. A thin layer of developing agent on the<br>
developing belt 41 is released from the belt 41 in a form of a thin layer by a<br>
contact with the photoconductor in a developing region, and is moved to the<br><br>
portion where the latent image is formed on the photoconductor 10. The<br>
toner image developed by the image developer 40 is transferred to the<br>
surface of the intermediate transfer body 50 at a portion of contact (primary<br>
transfer region) of the photoconductor 10 and the intermediate transfer body<br>
50 that is moving at the same speed (primary transfer). In a case when<br>
three colors or four colors are transferred and overlaid, the process is<br>
repeated for each color to form a color image on the intermediate transfer<br>
body 50.<br>
The corona charger 52 is placed in order to charge the overlaid toner<br>
image on the intermediate transfer body at a position that is downstream of<br>
the contact section of the photoconductor 10 and the intermediate transfer<br>
body 50, and that is upstream of the contact section of the intermediate<br>
transfer body 50 and the sheet of support paper 100 with regards to the<br>
direction of the rotation of the intermediate transfer body 50. Then, the<br>
corona charger 52 provides a charge to the toner image the polarity of which<br>
is the same as that of the toner particles that form the toner image, and gives<br>
a sufficient charge for a good transfer to the sheet of support paper 100.<br>
After being charged by the corona charger 52, the toner image is transferred<br>
at once to the sheet of support paper 100 that is carried in the direction of the<br>
arrow from a sheet feeder (not shown) by a transfer bias of the transfer roller<br>
80 (secondary transfer). Thereafter, the sheet of support paper 100 to which<br>
the toner image is transferred is detached from the photoconductor 10 by a<br><br>
detaching device (not shown), and fusing is conducted thereto by a fusing<br>
device (not shown). After that, the sheet 100 is ejected from the device. On<br>
the other hand, after the transfer, the cleaning device 60 removes and<br>
retrieves toner particles that are not transferred from the photoconductor 10,<br>
and the charge removing lamp 70 removes remaining charge from the<br>
photoconductor 10 to prepare for the next charging.<br>
The static friction coefficient of the intermediate transfer body is<br>
preferably 0.1 to 0.6, more preferably 0.3 to 0.5. The volume resistance of<br>
the intermediate transfer body is preferably several Ω-cm or more and 103<br>
Ω-cm or less. By controlling the volume resistance from several Ω-cm to 103<br>
Ω-cm, charging of the intermediate transfer body itself is prevented. It also<br>
prevents uneven transfer at secondary transfer because the charge provided<br>
by charging means does not remain as much. In addition, it is easier to<br>
apply transfer bias for the secondary transfer.<br>
The materials for the intermediate transfer body may be properly<br>
selected depending on the application; examples are as follows-<br>
(1) Materials with high Young's moduli (tension elasticity) used as a<br>
single layer belt, which includes polycarbonates (PC), polyvinylidene fluoride<br>
(PVDF), polyalkylene terephthalate (PAT), blend materials of PC/PAT,<br>
ethylene tetrafluoroethylene copolymer (ETFE)/PC, and ETFE/PAT,<br>
thermosetting polyimides of carbon black dispersion, and the like. These<br>
single layer belts having high Young's moduli are small in their deformation<br><br>
against stress during image formation and are particularly advantageous in<br>
that mis-registration is not easily formed when forming a color image.<br>
(2)	A double or triple layer belt using the above described belt having<br>
high Young's modulus as a base layer, added with a surface layer and an<br>
optional intermediate layer around the peripheral side of the base layer.<br>
The double or triple layer belt has a capability to prevent print defect of<br>
unclear center portion in a line image that is caused by the hardness of the<br>
single layer belt.<br>
(3)	A belt with a relatively low Young's modulus that incorporates a<br>
rubber or an elastomer. This belt has an advantage that there is almost no<br>
print defect of unclear center portion in a line image due to its softness.<br>
Additionally, by making the width of the belt wider than driving and tension<br>
rollers and thereby using the elasticity of the edge portions that extend over<br>
the rollers, it can prevent snaky move of the belt. Therefore, it can reduce<br>
cost without the need for ribs and a device to prevent the snaky move.<br>
Conventionally, intermediate transfer belts have been adopting<br>
fluorine resins, polycarbonates, polyimides, and the like, but in the recent<br>
years, elastic belts in which elastic members are used in all layers or a part<br>
thereof. There are issues on transfer of color images using a resin belt.<br>
Color images are typically formed by four colors toners. In one color<br>
image, toner layers of layer 1 to layer 4 are formed. Toner layers are<br>
pressurized as they pass the primary transfer in which the layers are<br><br>
transferred from the photoconductor to the intermediate transfer belt and<br>
the secondary transfer in which the toner is transferred from the<br>
intermediate transfer belt to the sheet, which increases the cohesive force<br>
among toner particles. As the cohesive force increases, phenomena such as<br>
drop outs of letters and dropouts of edges of solid images are likely to occur.<br>
Since resin belts are too hard to be deformed by the toner layers, they tend to<br>
compress the toner layers and therefore drop out phenomena of letters are<br>
likely to occur.<br>
Recently, the demand for printing full color images on various types<br>
of paper such as Japanese paper and paper having a rough surface is<br>
increasing. However, sheets of paper having low smoothness tend to form<br>
gaps between the toner and the sheet at transfer and thus leading to<br>
miss-transfers. When the transfer pressure of secondary transfer section is<br>
raised in order to increase contact, the cohesive force of the toner layers will<br>
be higher, which will result in drop out of letters as described above.<br>
Elastic belts are used for the following aim. Elastic belts deform<br>
according to the toner layers and the roughness of the sheet having low<br>
smoothness at the transfer section. In other words, since the elastic belts<br>
deform to comply with local bumps and holes, a good contact is achieved<br>
without increasing the transfer pressure against the toner layers excessively<br>
so that it is possible to obtain transferred images having excellent uniformity<br>
without any drop out of letters even on sheets of paper of low flatness.<br><br>
For the resin of the elastic belts, one or more can be selected from the<br>
group including polycarbonates, fluorine resins (ETFE, PVDF), styrene<br>
resins (homopolymers and copolymers including styrene or substituted<br>
styrene) such as polystyrene, chloropolystyrene, poly-a-methylstyrene,<br>
styrene-butadiene copolymer, styrene-vinyl chloride copolymer, styrene-vinyl<br>
acetate copolymer, styrene-maleic acid copolymer, styrene-acrylate<br>
copolymers (styrene-methyl acrylate copolymer, styrene-ethyl acrylate<br>
copolymer, styrenebutyl acrylate copolymer, styrene-octyl acrylate copolymer,<br>
and styrene-phenyl acrylate copolymer), styrene-methacrylate copolymers<br>
(styrene-methyl methacrylate copolymer, styrene ethyl methacrylate<br>
copolymer, styrene-phenyl methacrylate copolymer, and the like),<br>
styrene-a-chloromethyl acrylate copolymer, styrene-acrylonitrile acrylate<br>
copolymer, and the like, methyl methacrylate resin, butyl methacrylate resin,<br>
ethyl acrylate resin, butyl acrylate resin, modified acrylic resins<br>
(silicone-modified acrylic resin, vinyl chloride resin-modified acrylic resin,<br>
acrylic urethane resin, and the like), vinyl chloride resin, styrene-vinyl<br>
acetate copolymer, vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer, rosin-modified<br>
maleic acid resin, phenol resin, epoxy resin, polyester resin, polyester<br>
polyurethane resin, polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutadiene,<br>
polyvinylidene chloride, ionomer resin, polyurethane resin, silicone resin,<br>
ketone resin, ethylene-ethylacrylate copolymer, xylene resin and<br>
polyvinylbutylal resin, polyamide resin, modified polyphenylene oxide resin,<br><br>
and the like.<br>
For the rubber and elastomer of the elastic materials, one or more<br>
can be selected from the group consisting of butyl rubber, fluorine rubber,<br>
acrylic rubber, ethylene propylene rubber (EPDM), acrylonitrilebutadiene<br>
rubber (NBR), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene natural rubber, isoprene<br>
rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber, butadiene rubber, ethylene-propylene<br>
rubber, ethylene-propylene terpolymer, chloroprene rubber, chlorosufonated<br>
polyethylene, chlorinated polyethylene, urethane rubber, syndiotactic<br>
1,2-polybutadiene, epichlorohydrin rubber, silicone rubber, fluorine rubber,<br>
polysulfurized rubber, polynorbornen rubber, hydrogenated nitrile rubber,<br>
thermoplastic elastomers such as polystyrene elastomers, polyolefin<br>
elastomers, polyvinyl chloride elastomers, polyurethane elastomers,<br>
polyamide elastomers, polyurea elastomers, polyester elastomers and<br>
fluorine resin elastomers.<br>
The electric conductive agent may be properly selected depending on<br>
the application; examples thereof include carbon black, graphite, metal<br>
powders such as aluminum, nickel, and the like,' and electric conductive<br>
metal oxides such as tin oxide, titanium oxide, antimony oxide, indium oxide,<br>
potassium titanate, antimony tin oxide (ATO), indium tin oxide (ITO), and<br>
the like. The metal oxides may be coated on non-conducting particulates<br>
such as barium sulfate, magnesium silicate, calcium carbonate, and the like.<br>
Materials of the surface layer are required to prevent contamination<br><br>
of the photoconductor by the elastic material and to reduce the surface<br>
friction of the transfer belt so that toner adhesion is lessened and the<br>
cleanability and secondary transfer property are increased. For example,<br>
one or more of polyurethane, polyester, epoxy resin, and the like is used, and<br>
powders or particles of a material that reduces surface energy and enhances<br>
lubrication such as fluorine resin, fluorine compound, carbon fluoride,<br>
titanium dioxide, silicon carbide, or the like can be dispersed and used. One<br>
or more lubricant materials may be used, alternatively, powders or particles<br>
of different sizes may be employed. In addition, it is possible to use a<br>
material such as fluorine rubber that is treated with heat so that a<br>
fluorine-rich layer is formed on the surface and the surface energy is reduced.<br>
Charging Unit<br>
FIG. 6 is a schematic diagram showing an example of the<br>
image-forming apparatus that equips a contact charger of charging unit.<br>
The photoconductor 140 to be charged as a latent electrostatic<br>
photoconductor is rotated at a predetermined speed of process speed in the<br>
direction shown with the arrow in the figure. The charging roller 160,<br>
which is brought into contact with the photoconductor, contains a core rod<br>
and a conductive rubber layer formed on the core rod in a shape of a<br>
concentric circle. The both terminals of the core rod are supported with<br>
bearings (not shown) so that the charging roller enables to rotate freely, and<br>
the charging roller is pressed to the photoconductor at a predetermined<br><br>
pressure by a pressure member (not shown). The charging roller 160 in this<br>
figure therefore rotates along with the rotation of the photoconductor. The<br>
charging roller 160 is generally formed with a diameter of 16 mm in which a<br>
core rod having a diameter of 9 mm is coated with a rubber layer having a<br>
moderate resistance of approximately 100,000 Ω-cm.<br>
The power supply (not shown) is electrically connected with the core<br>
rod of the charging roller 160, and a predetermined bias is applied to the<br>
charging roller by the power supply, thereby, the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 140 is uniformly charged at a predetermined polarity and<br>
potential.<br>
The charging device in the present invention may be a<br>
non-contacting unit rather than the contacting unit described above;<br>
preferably, the contact charger is preferable since the generation of ozone is<br>
relatively little.<br>
An alternative electric field is applied to the charging device of the<br>
image forming apparatuses of the present invention. Direct electric field<br>
typically generates a great number of O3~ and NO3, since the photoconductor<br>
is charged as one polarity. The ozone and nitrogen oxide tend to attach to<br>
the photoconductor and degrade the surface of the photoconductor,"<br>
consequently, the surface of the photoconductor is hardened, the abrasion<br>
wear comes to larger, the external additive tends to deposit due to lowered<br>
friction coefficients, resulting in frequent occurrences of filming. On the<br><br>
contrary, alternative electric field duplicated with AC may reduce the<br>
generation of ozone etc. and the photoconductor may be charged uniformly.<br>
In particular, the alternative electric field may suppress the ozone-derived<br>
degradation of photoconductor due to the generation of H3O+ having a<br>
reverse polarity.<br>
The configuration of the charging device may be properly selected<br>
depending on specifications of the image forming apparatus; for example, the<br>
configuration may be magnetic brush, fur brush etc. in addition to roller.<br>
The magnetic brush is typically constructed from a charging material of<br>
ferrite particles such as Zn-Cu ferrite, a non-magnetic conductive sleeve for<br>
the support, or a magnetic roll encased therein. The fur blush is formed of a<br>
fur to which such a conductive material is applied as carbon, copper sulfide,<br>
metals, or metal oxides," the fur is wounded or adhered to the other metals or<br>
conductive materials to form a charging device.<br>
Tandem Color Image Forming Apparatus<br>
FIG. 7 is a schematic view that exemplarily shows a color-image<br>
forming apparatus of a tandem system. In the direct transfer system as<br>
shown in FIG. 7, a transfer device 2, serving as a transfer, transfers images<br>
on individual photoconductors 1 sequentially to a sheet "s", serving as a<br>
recording medium, transported by a sheet conveyer belt 3. In the indirect<br>
transfer system as shown in FIG. 8, a primary transfer device 2 sequentially<br>
transfers images on individual photoconductors 1 to an intermediate transfer<br><br>
4, and a secondary transfer device 5 transfers the resulting images on the<br>
intermediate transfer 4 to the sheet "s" at once. The transfer device 5,<br>
serving as the transfer, may be a transfer conveyer belt or a roller.<br>
The direct transfer system must comprise a sheet feeder 6 upstream<br>
to the sequentially arrayed photoconductors 1 of the tandem image forming<br>
apparatus T and an image-fixing device 7 downstream thereof. The system<br>
inevitably increases in its size in a sheet conveying direction. In contrast, in<br>
the indirect transfer system, the secondary transfer mechanism can be<br>
relatively freely arranged, and the sheet feeder 6 and the image-fixing device<br>
7 can be arranged above and/or below the tandem image forming apparatus<br>
T. The apparatus of the indirect transfer system can therefore be<br>
downsized.<br>
In the direct transfer system, the image-fixing device 7 should be<br>
arranged in the vicinity of the tandem image forming apparatus T to prevent<br>
upsizing of the apparatus in a sheet conveying direction. The sheet "s"<br>
cannot sufficiently bend in such a small space between the image-fixing<br>
device 7 and the tandem image forming apparatus T. Accordingly, image<br>
formation upstream to the image-fixing device 7 is affected by an impact,<br>
specifically in a thick sheet, formed when the tip of the sheet "s" enters the<br>
image-fixing device 7 and by the difference between the conveying speed of<br>
the sheet when it passes through the image-fixing device 7 and the conveying<br>
speed of the sheet by the transfer conveyor belt.<br><br>
In contrast, in the indirect transfer system, the sheet "s" can<br>
sufficiently bend in a space between the image-fixing device 7 and the<br>
tandem image forming apparatus T. Thus, the image-fixing device 7 does<br>
not significantly affect the image formation.<br>
In the color electrophotographic apparatus of the tandem type as<br>
shown in FIG. 8, a photoconductor cleaning device 8 removes a residual toner<br>
on the photoconductor 1 after transferring and cleans the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 1 for another image forming process. In addition, an<br>
intermediate transfer cleaning device 9 removes residual toners on the<br>
intermediate transfer 4 after the secondary transferring step to thereby clean<br>
the surface of the intermediate transfer 4 for another image-forming process.<br>
The inventive embodiment will be explained with reference to FIG. 9.<br>
FIG. 9 is a schematic view showing an example of an<br>
electrophotographic apparatus of the tandem indirect image transfer system<br>
as an embodiment using the toner and the developer of the present invention.<br>
The apparatus includes a copying machine main body 100, a feeder table 200<br>
on which the copying machine main body 100 is placed, a scanner 300<br>
arranged on the copying machine main body 100, and an automatic<br>
document feeder (ADF) 400 arranged on the scanner 300. The copier main<br>
body 100 includes an endless-belt intermediate transfer 10.<br>
The intermediate transfer member 10 shown in FIG. 9 is spanned<br>
around three support rollers 14, 15 and 16 and is capable of rotating and<br><br>
moving in a clockwise direction in the figure.<br>
This apparatus includes an intermediate transfer cleaning device 17<br>
on the left side of the second support roller 15. The intermediate transfer<br>
cleaning device 17 is capable of removing a residual toner on the<br>
 intermediate transfer 10 after image -transfer.<br>
Above the intermediate transfer 10 spanned between the first and<br>
second support rollers 14 and 15, yellow, cyan, magenta, and black<br>
image-forming device 18 are arrayed in parallel in a moving direction of the<br>
intermediate transfer 10 to thereby constitute a tandem image forming unit<br>
 20.<br>
The apparatus further includes an exposing device 21 serving as an<br>
image-developer, above the tandem image forming unit 20 and a secondary<br>
transfer 22 below the intermediate transfer 10 as shown in FIG. 9. The<br>
secondary transfer 22, shown in FIG. 9 comprises an endless belt serving as<br>
a secondary transfer belt 24 spanned around two rollers 23. The secondary<br>
transfer belt 24 is pressed on the third support roller 16 with the<br>
interposition of the intermediate transfer 10 and is capable of transferring an<br>
image on the intermediate transfer 10 to a sheet.<br>
An image-fixing device 25 is arranged on the side of the secondary<br>
transfer 22 and is capable of fixing a transferred image on the sheet. The<br>
image-fixing device 25 comprises an endless image-fixing belt 26 and a<br>
pressure roller 27 pressed on the image-fixing belt 26.<br><br>
The secondary transfer 22 is also capable of transporting a sheet<br>
after image transfer to the image-fixing device 25. Naturally, a transfer<br>
roller or a non-contact charger can be used as the secondary transfer 22. In<br>
this case, the secondary transfer 22 may not have the capability of<br>
transporting the sheet.<br>
The apparatus also includes a sheet reverser 28 below the secondary<br>
transfer 22 and the image-fixing device 25 in parallel with the tandem image<br>
forming unit 20. The sheet reverser 28 is capable of reversing the sheet so<br>
as to form images on both sides of the sheet.<br>
A copy is made using the color electrophotographic apparatus in the<br>
following manner. Initially, a document is placed on a document platen 30<br>
of the automatic document feeder 400. Alternatively, the automatic<br>
document feeder 400 is opened, the document is placed on a contact glass 32<br>
of the scanner 300, and the automatic document feeder 400 is closed to press<br>
the document.<br>
At the push of a start switch (not shown), the document, if any,<br>
placed on the automatic document feeder 400 is transported onto the contact<br>
glass 32. When the document is initially placed on the contact glass 32, the<br>
scanner 300 is immediately driven to operate a first carriage 33 and a second<br>
carriage 34. light is applied from a light source to the document, and<br>
reflected Light from the document is further reflected toward the second<br>
carriage 34 at the first carriage 33. The reflected Light is further reflected<br><br>
by a mirror of the second carriage 34 and passes through an image-forming<br>
lens 35 into a read sensor 36 to thereby read the document.<br>
At the push of the start switch (not shown), a drive motor (not<br>
shown) rotates and drives one of the support rollers 14, 15 and 16 to thereby<br>
allow the residual two support rollers to rotate following the rotation of the<br>
one support roller to thereby rotatably convey the intermediate transfer 10.<br>
Simultaneously, the individual image forming device 18 rotates their<br>
photoconductors 40 to thereby form black, yellow, magenta, and cyan<br>
monochrome images on the photoconductors 40, respectively. With the<br>
conveying intermediate transfer 10, the monochrome images are sequentially<br>
transferred to form a composite color image on the intermediate transfer 10.<br>
Separately at the push of the start switch (not shown), one of feeder<br>
rollers 42 of the feeder table 200 is selectively rotated, sheets are ejected from<br>
one of multiple feeder cassettes 44 in a paper bank 43 and are separated in a<br>
separation roller 45 one by one into a feeder path 46, are transported by a<br>
transport roller 47 into a feeder path 48 in the copying machine main body<br>
100 and are bumped against a resist roller 49.<br>
Alternatively, the push of the start switch rotates a feeder roller 50 to<br>
eject sheets on a manual bypass tray 51, the sheets are separated one by one<br>
on a separation roller 52 into a manual bypass feeder path 53 and are<br>
bumped against the resist roller 49.<br>
The resist roller 49 is rotated synchronously with the movement of<br><br>
the composite color image on the intermediate transfer 10 to transport the<br>
sheet into between the intermediate transfer 10 and the secondary transfer<br>
22, and the composite color image is transferred onto the sheet by action of<br>
the secondary transfer 22 to thereby record a color image.<br>
The sheet bearing the transferred image is transported by the<br>
secondary transfer 22 into the image-fixing device 25, is applied with heat<br>
and pressure in the image-fixing device 25 to fix the transferred image,<br>
changes its direction by action of a switch blade 55, is ejected by an ejecting<br>
roller 56 and is stacked on an output tray 57. Alternatively, the sheet<br>
changes its direction by action of the switch blade 55 into the sheet reverser<br>
28, turns therein, is transported again to the transfer position, followed by<br>
image formation on the back surface of the sheet. The sheet bearing images<br>
on both sides thereof is ejected through the ejecting roller 56 onto the output<br>
tray 57.<br>
Separately, the intermediate transfer cleaning device 17 removes a<br>
residual toner on the intermediate transfer 10 after image transfer for<br>
another image forming procedure by the tandem image forming unit 20.<br>
The resist roller 49 is generally grounded, but it is also acceptable to<br>
apply a bias thereto for the removal of paper dust of the sheet.<br>
In the tandem image forming apparatus 20, each of the image<br>
forming units 18 comprises drum photoconductor 40, and around the<br>
photoconductor 40 are equipped with charge charger 60, developer 61, first<br><br>
transfer unit 62, cleaner 63, charge eliminator 64. Further, developing<br>
agent 65, stirring puddle 68, partition plate 69, toner-concentration sensor 71,<br>
developing sleeve 72, doctor 73, cleaning blade 75, cleaning brush 76,<br>
cleaning roller 77, cleaning blade 78, toner-discharge auger 79, and driving<br>
unit 80 are equipped as shown in FIG. 9.<br>
Process Cartridge<br>
The process cartridge applied from the present invention includes at<br>
least a latent electrostatic image bearing member to carry electrostatic<br>
images, and developing unit for developing by use of the developer to form<br>
visible images, and other optional units. The developing unit contains at<br>
least a developer container that contains the inventive toner or the developer<br>
and a developer carrier that carries and transports the toner or the developer<br>
in the developer container, and also a layer-thickness control member to<br>
control the layer thickness of the carrying toner.<br>
FIG. 10 is a schematic view of an image forming apparatus of<br>
tandem indirect transfer system that comprises the process cartridge.<br>
The process cartridge contains integrally at least the photoconductor<br>
302 and the developing unit 304 among the photoconductor 302, charging<br>
unit 303, developing unit 304, and cleaning unit 305 etc., and preferably, the<br>
process cartridge is detachably attached to main bodied of image forming<br>
apparatuses such as copiers and printers.<br>
The inventive electrostatic image developing toner, containing the<br><br>
inventive binder resin of the polycondensation polyester resin, may exhibit<br>
excellent blocking resistance and low temperature fixability, provide high<br>
quality images stably with time under such conditions as high temperature<br>
and high humidity, low temperature and low humidity, or outputting larger<br>
area images without such problems as decreasing charging capacity due to<br>
firm adhesion of toners onto carriers or developing sleeves, and also<br>
represent appropriate storage stability, melting-flowability and charging<br>
property. Moreover, the resin properties are adequate even though the<br>
catalyst is other than tin compounds that are environmentally harmful.<br>
In addition, the inventive toner, in particular the toner combined<br>
with the specific charge control agent may be far from background smear<br>
under high temperature and high humidity conditions, exhibit proper<br>
charging ability, less environmental fluctuation and excellent low<br>
temperature fixability, and achieve less environmental load by virtue of the<br>
toner binder prepared from catalyst others than tin catalysts that biologically<br>
toxic and environmentally harmful.<br>
Moreover, the inventive electrostatic image developing toner, which<br>
containing the polyester resin prepared under a specific titanium-containing<br>
catalyst and the resin charge control agent in a specific ratio, may exhibit a<br>
high charge amount and a sharp charge distribution, excellent initial<br>
charging property and excellent background smear, and be hardly affected by<br>
temperature/humidity change, be free from smears and fikaings for long<br><br>
usage such as several ten thousand sheets on developing supports like<br>
developing rollers or sleeves and layer-thickness control members like blades<br>
or rollers, and provide efficient productivity due to proper milling ability, and<br>
far from environmental problems, as such be appropriate for full-color<br>
allocation.<br>
The present invention provide also a one-component developer and<br>
two-component developer that contain the toner, and an image forming<br>
method and an image forming apparatus that utilize the toner.<br>
The present invention will be explained with reference to Examples,<br>
to which the present invention will be limited in no way. In the descriptions<br>
of Examples below, all parts means "parts by mass" and all percentages<br>
means "% by mass".<br>
In the Examples and Comparative Examples, toner properties were<br>
measured in accordance with the following processes.<br>
Measurement of Softening Temperature of Toner<br>
The temperature of a sample material is raised at a constant rate<br>
using a flow tester under the conditions below, the temperature at which half<br>
of the sample material having been flown out is defined as the softening<br>
temperature.<br>
device : flow tester CTF-500D (by Shimadzu Co.)<br>
load: 20 kgf/cm2<br>
die : 1 mmΦ - 1mm<br><br>
temperature-rising rate ' 6°C/min<br>
sample mass : 1.0 g<br>
Measurement of Particle Diameter of Toner<br>
The particle diameter distribution of toner particles was measured<br>
using Coulter counter TA-II (by Beckman Coulter, Inc.) as follows-<br>
Initially, 0.1 to 5 mL of a surfactant of alkylbenzene sulfonate is<br>
added as a dispersant into 100 to 150 mL of an aqueous electrolyte solution.<br>
The aqueous electrolyte solution is an about 0.1% NaCl aqueous solution,<br>
which is prepared from ISOTONII (by Beckman Coulter, Inc.). A sample of<br>
2 to 20 mg was added to the electrolyte solution, which was then<br>
ultrasonically dispersed for 1 to 3 minutes using a ultrasonic dispersing<br>
device, thereafter volume and number of the toner particles are measured by<br>
the Coulter counter TA-II using an aperture of 100 μm to calculate the<br>
volume distribution and the number distribution, from which the volume<br>
average particle diameter and the number average particle diameter are<br>
determined.<br>
In order to measure particles having a particle diameter (Pd) of no<br>
less than 2.00 μm to less than 40.30 μm, thirteen channels are used such as<br>
2.00 μm ≤ Pd 
4.00 μrn ≤ Pd 
8.00 μm ≤ Pd 
μm, 16.00 μm ≤ Pd 
 <br>
32.00μm and 32.00 μm ≤Pd 
Measurement of Average Circularity of Toner<br>
The average circularity is measured using a flow-type particle image<br>
analyzer FPIA-2100 (by Sysmex Co.). Specifically, 0.3 mL of a surfactant of<br>
alkylbenzene sulfonate is added as a dispersant into 120 mL of pure water, to<br>
which about 0.2 g of a sample is added. The dispersion containing the<br>
sample is ultrasonically dispersed for about 2 minutes using a ultrasonic<br>
dispersing device, the dispersion concentration is adjusted to 5000/μL then<br>
the shape and the distribution of the toner are measured.<br>
Measurement of Shape Factors SF-1 and SF-2 of Toner<br>
SEM images taken using FE-SEM (S-4800, by Hitachi, Ltd.) are<br>
randomly sampled by 300 views, which are inputted into Image Analyzer<br>
LUSEX3 (by Nireco Co.) through an interface and analyzed.<br>
Measurement of Agglomeration Degree of Toner<br>
The agglomeration degree is measured using a powder tester (by<br>
Hosokawa Micron Co.) as the measuring device; attachment parts are set on<br>
a vibrating table according to the following procedures.<br>
(i) vibro-shoot<br>
(ii) packing<br>
(iii) space ring<br>
(iv) screens (three types) upper &gt; middle &gt; lower<br>
(v) pressing bar<br><br>
The screens are fixed by knob nuts, the vibrating table is operated<br>
with the conditions below:<br>
screen opening (upper): 75 μm<br>
screen opening (middle): 45 μm<br>
screen opening (lower) : 22 μm<br>
vibration amplitude :1 mm<br>
sample mass • 2 g<br>
vibrating period : 15 seconds<br>
The agglomeration degree is calculated as follows after the operation,<br>
mass of powder on the upper screen x 1'. (a)<br>
mass of powder on the middle screen x 0.6 (b)<br>
mass of powder on the lower screen x 0.2 : (c)<br>
The total of these three values is defined as the agglomeration degree<br>
(%); i.e. agglomeration degree (%) = (a) + (b) + (c).<br>
Measurement of Glass Transition Temperature Tg<br>
The glass transition temperature Tg of toner is measured under the<br>
following conditions.<br>
differential scanning calorimeter : Seiko 1D SC100, Seiko 1SSC5040<br>
(disc station)<br>
measuring conditions: temperature range of 25°C to 90°C,<br>
temperature-rising rate of 10°C/min, sampling period of 0.5 second, and<br>
sampling amount of 10 mg<br><br>
Measurement of Volume Resistivity<br>
The volume resistivity is measured by way of pressing a toner into a<br>
pellet, the pellet is placed between parallel electrodes with a gap of 2 mm,<br>
then DC 1000 volts is applied between the electrodes, the resistivity after 30<br>
seconds is measured by a high resist meter (TR8601, by Advantest Co.), then<br>
the volume resistivity is calculated as a logarithmic value from the measured<br>
resistivity and the pellet thickness.<br>
Measurement of Loose Apparent Density<br>
The loose apparent density is measured by a powder tester PT-S (by<br>
Hosokawa Micron Co.).<br>

(l) Low Temperature Fixability (Peeling Property with Tape)<br>
A developer was prepared by mixing for 5 minutes 4 parts by mass of<br>
a toner and 96 parts by mass of a siliconexoated ferrite carrier (average<br>
particle diameter 100 μm, by Kanto Denka Kogyo Co.) using a turbuler mixer.<br>
The developer was input into a copier (Imagio 105, by Ricoh Co.) that had<br>
been modified so as to fix at outside the apparatus, and unfixed images of 2<br>
cm by 12 cm were formed in a toner amount of 0.5 mg/cm2. Then the<br>
unfixed images were fixed at a linear velocity of 1500 mm/sec while raising<br>
the temperature of the fixing roll from 100°C to 250°C stepwise with an<br>
increment of 5°C per step. The fixing paper was RICOPY PPC paper Type<br>
6000 (by Ricoh Co.).<br>
A scotch tape (by Sumitomo 3M Ltd.) was glued on images formed at<br>
respective fixing temperatures and allowed to stand for 3 hours, then the<br>
tape was peeled away and disposed on a white paper. The density of<br>
unfixed images on the tape was measured by X-Rite 938 (by X-Rite Co.),' the<br>
difference of the density from that of blank being no less than 0.150 was<br>
evaluated as "unfixed", the temperature at which the difference firstly came<br>
to less than 0.150 was defined as the lowest fixing temperature. The low<br>
temperature fixability was evaluated based on the lowest fixing temperature<br>
in accordance the following criteria.<br><br>

difference of the density from that of blank being no less than 0.150 was<br>
evaluated as "unfixed", the temperature at which the difference firstly came<br>
to less than 0.150 was defined as the lowest fixing temperature. The low<br>
temperature fixability was evaluated based on the lowest fixing temperature<br>
in accordance the following criteria.<br>
Evaluation Criteria<br>
A: lowest fixing temperature 
B: 140°C ≤ lowest fixing temperature 
 <br>
C: 150°C ≤ lowest fixing temperature<br>
(2) Evaluation of Background Smear<br>
Using the toners of Examples and Comparative Examples similarly<br>
as above (1), a solid image was developed on 10000 sheets of paper under<br>
high temperature and high humidity condition by use of a copier. Then a<br>
scotch tape (by Sumitomo 3M Ltd.) was glued on the background portion of<br>
the photoconductor, followed by being peeled away and disposed on a white<br>
paper. The density of background smear on the tape was measured by<br>
X-Rite 938 (by X-Rite Co.); the difference of the density from that of blank<br>
being no less than 0.050 was evaluated as occurrence of background smear,<br>
the difference of less than 0.010 and no less than 0.005 was evaluated as<br>
appropriate resistance for background smear, and the difference of less than<br>
0.005 was evaluated as very appropriate resistance for background smear.<br>
Evaluation Criteria<br>
A: very appropriate resistance for background smear<br>
B: appropriate resistance for background smear<br>
C: occurrence of background smear<br><br><br>
The results described above demonstrate that the inventive toners<br>
may exhibit appropriate low temperature fixability and be far from<br>
background smear of toners even under high temperature and high humidity<br>
conditions.<br>

synthesis example 1, except that the polycondensation catalyst was changed<br>
into titanium tetraisopropoxide. There arose such a problem that the<br>
reaction was stopped on the way due to catalysis deactivation and the<br>

Synthesis of Titanium-Containing Catalyst<br>
A mixture of 1700 parts of titanium diisopropoxy<br>
bis(triethanolaluminate) and 130 parts of deionized water was poured into a<br>
reactor vessel equipped with a condenser, a stirrer and a nitrogen gas inlet<br>
capable of bubbling a liquid therein, the mixture was heated gradually to<br>
90°C and allowed to react at 90°C for 4 hours (hydrolysis) while bubbling the<br>
liquid with nitrogen gas thereby to prepare titanium dihydroxy<br>
bis(triethanolaluminate).<br>
Other titanium-containing catalysts in Examples below, available for<br>
the present invention, may be prepared in similar synthetic processes.<br>
Synthesis 1 of Linear Polyester Resin<br>
Forty hundred and thirty parts of an adduct of bisphenol A with 2<br>
moles of PO, 300 parts of an adduct of bisphenol A with 3 moles of PO, 257<br>
parts of terephthalic acid, 65 parts of isophthalic acid, 10 parts of maleic<br><br>
anhydride and 2 parts of titanium dihydroxy bis(triethanolaluminate) as a<br>
condensation catalyst were poured into a reactor vessel equipped with a<br>
condenser, a stirrer and a nitrogen gas inlet, and the mixture was allowed to<br>
react at 220°C for 10 hours under nitrogen gas flow while distilling away the<br>
water generated in the reaction. Then the reactant was allowed to react<br>
under a reduced pressure of 5 to 20 mmHg and taken out when the acid<br>
value came to 5 mgKOH/g. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction<br>
product was milled, consequently, a linear polyester resin AX1-1 was<br>
obtained.<br>
The resulting AX1-1 contained no THFinsoluble matter, and had an<br>
acid value of 7 mgKOH/g, a hydroxyl value of 12 mgKOH/g, a glass transition<br>
temperature Tg of 60°C, a number average molecular mass Mn of 6940, and<br>
a peak top molecular mass Mp of 19100. The rate of the molecular mass of<br>
no more than 1500 was 1.2%.<br>
Synthesis 1 of non-Linear Polyester Resin<br>
Three hundred and fifty parts of an adduct of bisphenol A with 2<br>
moles of EO, 326 parts of an adduct of bisphenol A with 3 moles of PO, 278<br>
parts of terephthalic acid, 40 parts of phthalic anhydride and 2 parts of<br>
titanium dihydroxy bis(triethanolaluminate) as a condensation catalyst were<br>
poured into a reactor vessel equipped with a condenser, a stirrer and a<br>
nitrogen gas inlet, and the mixture was allowed to react at 230°C for 10<br>
hours under nitrogen gas flow while distilling away the water generated in<br><br>
the reaction. Then the reactant was allowed to react under a reduced<br>
pressure of 5 to 20 mmHg, cooled to 180°C when the acid value came to 2<br>
mgKOH/g or less, 62 parts of trimellitic anhydride was added, then the<br>
mixture was allowed to react under normal pressure of sealed atmosphere<br>
for 2 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction product was<br>
milled, consequently, a non-linear polyester resin AX2-1 was obtained.<br>
The resulting AX2-1 contained no THF-insoluble matter, and had an<br>
acid value of 35 mgKOH/g, a hydroxyl value of 17 mgKOH/g, a glass<br>

Synthesis 1 of Toner Binder<br>
Four hundred parts of the AX1-1 and 600 parts of the AX2-1 were<br>
melted-kneaded using a continuous kneader at a jacket temperature of<br>
150°C and a residence time of 3 minutes. The melted resin was cooled to<br>
30°C over 4 minutes using a steel-belt cooler, then milled to prepare an<br>
inventive toner binder (resin A).<br>
Synthesis 2 of Comparative Linear Polyester Resin<br>
The reaction was carried out in the same manner as that of AX1-1 of<br>
synthesis example 1, except that the polycondensation catalyst was changed<br>
into titanium tetraisopropoxide. There arose such a problem that the<br>
reaction was stopped on the way due to catalysis deactivation and the<br><br>
distillation of generated water was also stopped, thus 2 parts of titanium<br>
tetraisopropoxide was added four times during the reaction thereby to obtain<br>
a comparative linear polyester resin CAX1-1.<br>
The resulting CAX1-1 contained no THF-insoluble matter, and had<br>
an acid value of 7 mgKOH/g, a hydroxyl value of 12 mgKOH/g, a glass<br>
transition temperature Tg of 58°C, a number average molecular mass Mn of<br>
6220 and a peak top molecular mass Mp of 18900. The rate of the<br>

synthesis example 1, except that the polycondensation catalyst was changed<br>
into titanium tetraisopropoxide. The reaction was carried out under normal<br>
pressure for 16 hours and under a reduced pressure for 8 hours. The<br>
reaction velocity was slow, thus 2 parts of titanium tetraisopropoxide was<br>
added three times during the reaction thereby to obtain a comparative<br>
non-linear polyester resin CAX2-1.<br>
The resulting CAX2-1 contained no THF-insoluble matter, and had<br>
an acid value of 34 mgKOH/g, a hydroxyl value of 16 mgKOH/g, a glass<br>
transition temperature Tg of 68°C, a number average molecular mass Mn of<br>
3420 and a peak top molecular mass Mp of 12100. The rate of the<br>
molecular mass of no more than 1500 was 2.1%.<br>
Synthesis 2 of Comparative Toner Binder<br><br>
Four hundred parts of the CAX1-1 and 600 parts of the CAX2-1 were<br>
melted-kneaded using a continuous kneader at a jacket temperature of<br>
150°C and a residence time of 3 minutes. The melted resin was cooled to<br>
30°C over 4 minutes using a steel-belt cooler, then milled to prepare a<br>
comparative toner binder (resin B). The resin B was of intense purplish<br>
brown.<br>
Synthesis 3 of Linear Polyester Resin<br>
A linear polyester resin AX1-2 was prepared by a similar reaction as<br>
that of AX1-1 of the synthesis example 1, followed by cooling to room<br>
temperature and milling except that the polycondensation catalyst was<br>
changed into titanyl bis(triethanolaluminate).<br>
The resulting AX1-2 contained no THF-insoluble matter, and had an<br>
acid value of 8 mgKOH/g, a hydroxyl value of 10 mgKOH/g, a glass transition<br>
temperature Tg of 60°C, a number average molecular mass Mn of 6820 and a<br>
peak top molecular mass Mp of 20180. The rate of the molecular mass of no<br>
more than 1500 was 1.1%.<br>
Synthesis 3 of non-Linear Polyester Resin<br>
A linear polyester resin AX2-2 was prepared by a similar reaction as<br>
that of AX2-1 of the synthesis example 1, followed by cooling to room<br>
temperature and milling except that the polycondensation catalyst was<br>
changed into titanyl bis(triethanolaluminate).<br>
The resulting AX2-2 contained no THF-insoluble matter, and had an<br><br>
acid value of 33 mgKOH/g, a hydroxyl value of 14 mgKOH/g, a glass<br>
transition temperature Tg of 70°C, a number average molecular mass Mn of<br>
4200 and a peak top molecular mass Mp of 11800. The rate of the molecular<br>
mass of no more than 1500 was 0.8%.<br>
Synthesis 3 of Toner Binder<br>

Evaluation Process<br>
(1) Color Difference in L*a*b* Color Specification System<br>
Using an image forming apparatus, respective image densities at a<br>
100% image-area ratio in monochrome mode of yellow (Y), magenta (M) and<br>
cyan (C) were measured, and intermediate colors of blue (B), green (G) and<br><br>
red (R) were measured by color-mixing 50% of yellow (Y), magenta (M) or<br>
cyan (C). The respective image densities were measured using X-Rite 938<br>
(by X-Rite Inc.) in a condition of observable eyespot 2° at observing light D50<br>
(JIS Z-8720 (1983)), then a* and b* where the image density ID (-Log<br>
Reflectivity) being "1.0" was measured. The results are shown in FIGs. 11<br>
to 15. FIG. 13 is a partially enlarged view of FIG. 12, and FIG. 15 is a<br>
partially enlarged view of FIG. 14.<br>
When toners are overlapped for two or more colors, images are<br>
formed firstly by magenta, followed by cyan, and followed by yellow.<br>
Examples 75 to 78 and Comparative Examples 26 to 29<br>
The toner kits to evaluate toners of Examples 75 to 78 and<br>
Comparative Examples 26 to 29 are shown in Table 4.<br>
Table4<br><br>
The evaluation results are shown in Tables 5, 6 and FIGs. 11 to 15.<br>
In the figure where a*b* is plotted in L*a*b* color specification system, the<br>
wider area enclosed by six colors of Y/R/M/B/C/G indicates that color<br>
reproducibility is more excellent.<br><br>
FIGs. 12 and 13 demonstrate that Examples 75 and 78 definitely<br>
represent wider color reproducible area in terms of R and M compared to<br>
Comparative Example 26 and 27, in particular the color reproducible area is<br>
excellently wide for R.<br>
On the contrary, Comparative Example 26 represents a wider color<br>
reproducible area in terms of G/C, however, narrow in terms of R/M.<br>
Comparative Example 27 represents a wide area in terms of M, however,<br>
remarkably narrow in terms of G/Y/R.<br>
As such, it is clear that Example 75 and 78 represent color<br>
reproducibility over entire regions, in particular wide in R.<br>
It is also clear from FIGs. 14 and 15 that Example 76 represents a<br>
wide area particularly in R without sacrificing the other regions, and<br>
Example 77 is not as wide as Example 76 in terms of R but wide in terms of<br>
M/B.<br>
Image Evaluation<br>
The toners described above and Cu-Zn ferrite carrier (coated with a<br>
silicone resin, average particle diameter- 40 μm) were blended by 5% and<br>
95% as content to prepare two-component developers, which were used to<br>
develop a draft photograph containing flesh color. The development was<br>
carried out on 1000 sheets with full-color mode of 400 dpi using a modified<br>
copier (Imagio Neo C385, by Ricoh Co.), and the developed images were<br>
evaluated visually by 50 persons and ranked in accordance with the<br><br>
following criteria. The results are shown in Table 5.<br>
Sensitive Evaluation for Flesh Color Photography<br>
The evaluation results were ranked under the following five steps<br>
with respect to superiority for flesh color on the basis of human visual<br>
inspection.<br>
The evaluation was such as full marks being 100 points, and the<br>
lowest being 0 point, then the points by 50 persons being averaged.<br>
A: very good, 80 points or higher<br>
B: good, 60 to 79 points<br>
C: ordinary, 40 to 59 points<br>
D: bad, 20 to 39 points<br>
E: very bad, 19 points or lower<br>
Table 5<br><br><br><br><br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The inventive toner may exhibit excellent blocking resistance and<br>
low temperature fixability, provide high quality images stably with time<br>
under such conditions as high temperature and high humidity, low<br>
temperature and low humidity, or outputting larger area images, without<br>
such problems as decreasing charging capacity due to firm adhesion of toners<br>
onto carriers or developing sleeves, therefore, is available as an electrostatic<br>
image developing toner.<br>
The inventive toner kit may represent wide reproducible regions in<br>
terms of yellow and magenta colors, in particular of intermediate flesh and<br>
red colors, and may also decrease scattering of magenta and yellow toners in<br>
particular, therefore, is available as a kit for developing electrostatic latent<br>
