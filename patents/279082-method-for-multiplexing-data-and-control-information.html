[Invention Title]<br>
METHOD FOR MULTIPLEXING DATA AND CONTROL INFORMATION<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a method for multiplexing data and control<br>
sequences and mapping the multiplexed sequences to a physical channel in a wireless<br>
mobile communication system.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
Data and control sequences transmitted from a media access control (MAC)<br>
layer to a physical layer are encoded and then provide transport and control services<br>
through a radio transmission link. A channel coding scheme is comprised of a<br>
combination of processes of error detection, error correction, rate matching, interleaving,<br>
and mapping of transport channel information or control information to the physical<br>
channel. Data transmitted from the MAC layer includes systematic bits and non-<br>
systematic bits according to the channel coding scheme. The non-systematic bits may<br>
be parity bits.<br>
In the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP), an uplink shared channel<br>
(UL-SCH) and a random access channel (RACH) of an uplink transport channel may be<br>
 <br>
mapped to a physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) and a packet random access<br>
channel (PRACH) of a physical channel, respectively. Uplink control information<br>
(UCI), which is one of an uplink control channel information, may be mapped to a<br>
physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) and/or a PUSCH. A downlink shared<br>
channel (DL-SCH), a broadcast channel (BCH), a paging channel (PCH), and a<br>
multicast channel (MCH) of a downlink transport channel are respectively mapped to a<br>
physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH), a physical broadcast channel (PBCH), a<br>
physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH), and a physical multicast channel<br>
(PMCH) of a physical channel. A control format indicator (CF1), a hybrid automatic<br>
repeat request (HARQ) indicator (HI), and downlink channel information (DCI) of<br>
downlink control channel information are mapped to a physical control format indicator<br>
channel (PCFICH), a physical HARQ indicator channel (PHICH), and a physical<br>
downlink control channel (PDCCH) of a physical channel, respectively. The above<br>
transport channels are mapped to the respective physical channels through multiple<br>
processes. Especially, in a channel such as a UL-SCH, processing for cyclic<br>
redundancy check (CRC), code block segmentation, channel coding, rate matching, and<br>
code block concatenation is performed with respect to at least one transport channel or<br>
control information.<br>
 <br>
A process for processing a transport channel and/or control information is<br>
illustrated in FIG. 1. Data in the form of a transport block is input every transmission<br>
time interval (TTI). The transport block is processed as follows. A CRC attachment<br>
block attaches a CRC to the data in the form of a transport block. A code block<br>
segmentation block segments the CRC-attached data into one or more code blocks. A<br>
channel coding block performs channel coding for a code block data stream of each of<br>
the segmented code blocks. A rate matching block performs rate matching for the<br>
channel coded data stream. A code block concatenation block concatenates one or<br>
more rate-matched data streams to form a sequence of encoded data bits. Meanwhile,<br>
a separate channel coding block performs channel coding for control information to<br>
form a sequence of encoded control bits. A data/control multiplexing block<br>
multiplexes the sequence of encoded data bits and the sequence of encoded control bits,<br>
thereby generating a sequence of multiplexed bits.<br>
One symbol may be comprised of at least one bit according to a modulation<br>
order (Qm). For example, for BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM, and 64QAM, one bit, two bits,<br>
four bits, and six bits corresponding respectively thereto constitute one symbol. In a<br>
system using single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA), one symbol<br>
is mapped to one resource element (RE), and therefore, a description can be given in<br>
 <br>
units of symbols. Accordingly, the terms 'coded data bit', 'coded control bit', and<br>
'multiplexed bit' may be replaced with the terms 'coded data symbol', 'coded control<br>
symbol', and 'multiplexed symbol', respectively, in consideration of the modulation<br>
order, for convenience of description. The terms 'coded data bit', 'coded data symbol',<br>
'coded data symbol', 'coded control bit', and 'coded control symbol' may be<br>
abbreviated to 'data bit' 'data symbol', 'control bit' and 'control symbol', respectively,<br>
for convenience of description.<br>
The control information may be classified into one or more types according to<br>
properties thereof and various multiplexing schemes may be considered according to the<br>
number of types.<br>
If only one type of control information is present, when data information and<br>
control information are multiplexed, the control information may or may not overwrite<br>
the data information.<br>
If two types of control information are present, the control information is<br>
divided into a first type of control information and a second type of control information.<br>
If the second type of control information is more important than the first type of control<br>
information, data information and control information may be multiplexed in a manner<br>
that the first type of control information overwrites or does not overwrite data<br>
 <br>
information. Next, the second type of control information may or may not overwrite<br>
the multiplexed data information and/or the first type of control information.<br>
A process of processing a transport channel for a UL-SCH of the 3GPP is<br>
illustrated in FIG 2. FIG 2 illustrates a matrix structure of 'R' rows by 'C' columns<br>
(R*C) (for example, C=14). Hereinafter, such a structure may be referred to as 'a set<br>
of resource elements'. C successive symbols are arranged in a time area in a<br>
horizontal direction and R virtual subcarriers are arranged in a frequency area in a<br>
vertical direction. In a set of resource elements, virtual subcarriers are arranged<br>
adjacent to each other but subcarriers on respective physical channels corresponding to<br>
the virtual subcarriers may be discontinuous in the frequency area. Hereinafter, the<br>
term 'virtual subcarrier' related to a set of resource elements will be referred to as<br>
'subcarrier' for brevity. In a normal cyclic prefix structure ('normal CP structure'), 14<br>
(C=14) symbols constitute one sub-frame. In an extended CP structure, 12 (C=12)<br>
symbols may constitute one sub-frame. That is, FIG 2 is based on the normal CP<br>
structure. If the 'extended CP structure' is used, FIG 2 may have a matrix structure in<br>
which C is 12. Referring to FIG. 2, M symbols (= the number of symbols per sub-<br>
frame x the number of subcarriers = CxR) may be mapped. Namely, M symbols may<br>
be mapped to M resource elements per one sub-frame. In addition to symbols<br>
 <br>
generated by multiplexing data symbols and control symbols, reference signal (RS)<br>
symbols and/or sounding RS (SRS) symbols may be mapped to the M resource<br>
elements. Therefore, if K RS symbols and/or SRS symbols are mapped, (M-K)<br>
multiplexed symbols may be mapped.<br>
FIG 2 shows an example of mapping two types of control information, that is,<br>
control information 1 and control information 2 to a set of resource elements.<br>
Referring to FIG 2, a sequence of multiplexed symbols is mapped by a time-first<br>
mapping method. That is, the sequence of multiplexed symbols is sequentially<br>
mapped from the first symbol position of the first subcarrier to the right. If mapping<br>
ends within one subcarrier, mapping is sequentially performed from the first symbol<br>
position of the next subcarrier to the right. Hereinbelow, a symbol may refer to an SC-<br>
FDMA symbol. The control information 1 and data information are mapped by a time-<br>
first mapping method in order of control information 1 → data information. The<br>
control information 2 is mapped only to symbols located at both sides of RS symbols in<br>
order of last subcarrier → first subcarrier. The last subcarrier refers to a subcarrier<br>
located at the bottom of a set of resource elements of FIG 2 and the first subcarrier<br>
refers to a subcarrier located at the top of the set of resource elements. The control<br>
information 1 rate-matches with data information and is mapped. The control<br>
 <br>
information 2 punctures the data information and/or the mapped control information 1<br>
and is mapped. The data information may be formed by sequentially concatenating<br>
multiple code blocks segmented from one transport block.<br>
When multiplexing data information and control information, the following<br>
should be considered.<br>
First, a multiplexing rule should not be changed by the amount and type of<br>
control information or presence/absence of control information. Second, when control<br>
information is multiplexed with data by rate matching or control information punctures<br>
data and/or other types of control information, the control information should not affect<br>
transmission of other data of a cyclic buffer. Third, a starting point of a cyclic buffer<br>
for a next redundancy version should not be influenced by presence/absence of control<br>
information. Fourth, in a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) transmission<br>
scheme, HARQ buffer corruption should be able to be avoided. In a method for<br>
mapping multiplexed information to a data channel, a specific type of control<br>
information should be mapped to resource elements adjacent to an RS which can show<br>
good capability.<br>
In the method of FIG 2, since two types of control information are mapped to a<br>
virtual physical channel together with data information, a new rule is demanded to map<br>
 <br>
another type of control information. In the method of FIG 2, when the control<br>
information 2 punctures the data information and/or the control information I,<br>
puncturing is performed from the last code block. However, if probability of<br>
generating an error in the last code block by transmission environments and a code rate<br>
is high, an error may occur only in the last code block. In that case, the error is<br>
detected after all code blocks are decoded, determination of a transmission error is<br>
delayed and power consumed to decode the code blocks is increased.<br>
[Disclosure!<br>
[Technical Problem]<br>

providing a method for mapping control information by a prescribed rule considering<br>
presence/absence and type of the control information to improve the capability of a<br>

[Mode for Invention]<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the exemplary embodiments of the<br>
present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings. The detailed<br>
description, which will be given below with reference to the accompanying drawings, is<br>
intended to explain exemplary embodiments of the present invention, rather than to<br>
show the only embodiments that can be implemented according to the invention. The<br>
following detailed description includes specific details in order to provide a thorough<br>
understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in<br>
the art that the present invention may be practiced without such specific details. For<br>
example, the following description will be given centering on specific terms, but the<br>
present invention is not limited thereto and any other terms may be used to represent the<br>
same meanings. The same reference numbers will be used throughout this<br>
specification to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
In actual implementation, each element in a block diagram may be divided<br>
into two hardware chips, or two or more elements may be integrated into one hardware<br>
chip.<br>
 <br>
Exemplary embodiments described hereinbelow may be used for processing<br>
of a transport channel, especially a UL-SCH, of the 3GPP.<br>
Control information may be classified into various types according to an<br>
arbitrary method or 'importance' thereof. Here, 'importance' may be determined by<br>
evaluating a degree of influence on the capability of a wireless mobile communication<br>
system when any type of control information fails in transmission. When multiple<br>
types of control information are present, a new multiplexing scheme is required to<br>
improve the capability of a wireless mobile communication system. For example,<br>
control information of a more important type may be multiplexed s as not to be<br>
overwritten by control information of a less important type.<br>
In the present invention, control information 1 may be channel quality<br>
information (CQI)/precoding matrix index (PMI) which is a combination of CQI<br>
indicating channel quality and of a PMI indicating index information of a codebook<br>
used for pre-coding. The control information 1 may rate-match with data information<br>
for multiplexing. Control information 2 may be acknowledgement/negative<br>
acknowledgement (ACK/NACK) which is a HARQ response. The control information<br>
2 may puncture the data information or the control information 1 for multiplexing.<br>
Control information 3 may be a rank indication or rank information (RI) indicating the<br>
 <br>
number of transport streams. The control information 3 may puncture the data<br>
information or the control information 1 or may rate-match with the data information<br>
and/or the control information 1, for multiplexing.<br>
Structures of exemplary embodiments proposed by the present invention may<br>
be modified and applied to a structure of up-down or right-left symmetry with respect to<br>
a frequency axis and a time axis in a set of resource elements comprised of resource<br>
elements. In the exemplary embodiments of the present invention, a symbol may be<br>
an SC-FDMA symbol.<br>
The term 'puncturing' refers to eliminating a specific bit (or symbol) from a<br>
sequence comprised of multiple bits (or symbols) and inserting a new bit (or symbol)<br>
into the sequence. That is, puncturing serves to replace a part of information with<br>
other information, and when data information or control information is multiplexed, a<br>
bit (or symbol) of punctured information is replaced with puncturing information.<br>
When a puncturing scheme is used, the length of whole bits (or symbols) is maintained<br>
even after new information is inserted. A code rate of punctured information is<br>
influenced by puncturing.<br>
The term 'rate matching' refers to adjusting a code rate of data information.<br>
When data information or control information is multiplexed, the location of each<br>
 <br>
information may be changed but contents of information are not influenced. 'Rate<br>
matching' of control information 1 and data information represents that the amount of<br>
adding rate-matched control information and rate-matched data information has a<br>
prescribed size. Therefore, if the amount of control information 1 to be transmitted is<br>
increased, the amount of data information rate-matching with the control information 1<br>
is decreased by that much.<br>
If a transport block is segmented into multiple code blocks for transmission, a<br>
receiving side can sequentially decode the code blocks from a code block No.O. At<br>
this time, if the code blocks are punctured using control information from the last code<br>
block of data information, an error may occur only in the last code block due to<br>
transmission environments and a code rate. Then error detection is delayed and<br>
considerable power is consumed in decoding the code blocks. If control information<br>
which punctures data is present, since puncturing is performed beginning from the front<br>
code block, an early stop is possible in a decoding process.<br>
Multiple code blocks generated from the code block segmentation block of<br>
FIG 1 may have different sizes. In this case, the front code block may have a smaller<br>
size than a rear code block. In this case, the respective code blocks may rate-match in<br>
the rate matching block of FIG. 1 so that the code blocks of different sizes have the<br>
 <br>
same size. Then the front code block having a relatively short length has a lower code<br>
rate than the rear code block having a long length. Therefore, when code blocks are<br>
punctured by control information, the front code block is less influenced by the rear<br>
code block.<br>
In the exemplary embodiments of FIG 7 to FIG. 12, when data information is<br>
punctured by control information, for example, control information 2, the data<br>
information is punctured beginning from the first code block. Then a probability of<br>
generating an error at the first code block is relatively increased. If an error is<br>
generated at the first code block, since it is possible to early determine whether a<br>
transmission error occurs, power consumed for decoding of code blocks can be<br>
decreased. Compared with a conventional method, the influence of puncturing on data<br>
information is relatively reduced.<br>
FIG 3a to FIG 6 are views for defining terms commonly used in this<br>
application to describe the exemplary embodiments of FIG 7 to FIG 13.<br>
A set of resource elements shown in FIG 3a to FIG 13 is based on a<br>
configuration of a normal CP and it is assumed that M (=RxC) resource elements are<br>
constructed. Here, 'C denotes the number of 'symbol periods' arranged in a time<br>
direction, and 'R' denotes the number of subcarriers arranged in a virtual frequency<br>
 <br>
direction. The symbol period refers to a time period at which one symbol exits.<br>
Accordingly, the length of one symbol period is identical to the length of one symbol.<br>
For the following description, a subcarrier located in the first row from the top<br>
in the whole area of a set of resource elements is defined as 'subcarrier 0' and a<br>
subcarrier located in the last row is defined as 'subcarrier R-1'. That is, the first<br>
subcarrier in a transmission band is defined as 'subcarrier 0', and the next subcarriers<br>
are sequentially defined as 'subcarrier 1', 'subcarrier 2', and the like. The last<br>
subcarrier is defined as 'subcarrier R-l'.<br>
FIGs. 3a, 3b, 4a, and 4b illustrate the concept for describing the exemplary<br>
embodiments of the present invention. In the following description, the terms 'first<br>
subcarrier' and 'last subcarrier' may be used in relation to a specific time-frequency<br>
area ('area A'). The area A may be a part of a set of resource elements or the entire set<br>
of resource elements. The area A indicates any area in a set of resource elements and<br>
respective resource elements in the area A may be separated from each other in time or<br>
frequency as illustrated in FIG. 4b. The 'first subcarrier' of the area A denotes a<br>
subcarrier of a row at the top of the area A and the last subcarrier of the area A denotes a<br>
subcarrier of a row at the bottom of the area A. A 'first resource element' ('F') and a<br>
'last resource element' ('L') are used in conjunction with the area A. Namely, the 'first<br>
 <br>
resource element' of the area A denotes a resource element located most ahead in time<br>
in the first subcarrier of the area A, that is, a resource element in the leftmost column.<br>
The 'last resource element' denotes a resource element located latest in time in the last<br>
subcarrier of the area A, that is, a resource element in the rightmost column. The first<br>
resource element within one subcarrier refers to a resource element which is most ahead<br>
in time within the subcarrier. The last resource element refers to a resource element<br>
which is the latest in time within that subcarrier.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5a, an RS is mapped to an 'RS symbol period' comprised of<br>
'RS symbol period(O)' and 'RS symbol period(l)'. The RS symbol period(O) and the<br>
RS symbol period(l) may not be adjacent to each other.<br>
An 'RS symbol period area' defined in the 'RS symbol period' will now be<br>
described. The RS symbol period area includes (2×R) resource elements located in the<br>
RS symbol period. The 'RS symbol period area' is divided into 'RS symbol period<br>
area(O)' and 'RS symbol period area(l)'. Each of the RS symbol period area(0) and<br>
the RS symbol period area(l) has R resource elements in a frequency direction.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5b, a 'first symbol period' is defined as 4 symbol periods<br>
separated from the RS symbol period by a zero symbol period. A 'first symbol period<br>
area' includes (4×R) resource elements located in the first symbol period. Therefore,<br>
 <br>
in FIGS. 3a to 6b, the 'first symbol period' is further divided into 'first symbol period<br>
area(0)', 'first symbol period area(l)', 'first symbol period area(2)', and 'first symbol<br>
period area(3)'.<br>
Referring to FIG 5c, a 'second symbol period' is defined as 4 symbol periods<br>
separated from the RS symbol period by one symbol period. A 'second symbol period<br>
area' includes (4*R) resource elements located in the second symbol period.<br>
Therefore, in FIGS. 3a to 6b, the 'second symbol period area' is further divided into<br>
'second symbol period area(0)', 'second symbol period area(l)\ 'second symbol period<br>
area(2)', and 'second symbol period area(3)'.<br>
RS symbol periods shown in FIGS. 3a to 13 are not always located in the<br>
fourth and eleventh symbol periods.<br>
The RS symbol period area, the first symbol period area, and the second symbol<br>
period area may be regarded as the area A.<br>
The term 'forward mapping order' is used in relation to the area A. Being<br>
mapped in the forward mapping order from a specific resource element in the area A<br>
refers to a 2-dimensional mapping method in which, within the area A, mapping is<br>
performed from a subcarrier to which a specific resource element belongs in a<br>
downward direction, and, within each subcarrier, mapping is performed according to<br>
 <br>
time flow, that is, from a left column to a right column. For example, mapping in the<br>
forward mapping order from the first resource element of the whole area depicted in<br>
FIG.3a means that mapping is performed in order of from subcarrier 0 to subcarrier N-l<br>
along arrows (dotted lines) (refer to FIG. 6a). A backward mapping order indicates a<br>
method of the reverse order to the forward mapping order. Being mapped in the<br>
backward mapping order from a specific resource element in the area A refers to a 2-<br>
dimensional mapping method in which, within the area A, mapping is performed from a<br>
subcarrier to which a specific resource element belongs in an upward direction, and,<br>
within each subcarrier, mapping is performed in reverse order of time flow, that is, from<br>
a right column to a left column. For example, if mapping is performed in the<br>
backward mapping order from the last resource element of the whole area depicted in<br>
FIG.3a, mapping is performed in order of from subcarrier N-l to subcarrier 0 along<br>
arrows (dotted lines) (refer to FIG. 6b).<br>
Although a set of resource elements shown in FIGS. 3a to 13 is based on the<br>
configuration of a normal CP, the same principle may be applied to the configuration of<br>
an extended CP comprised of 12 symbols.<br>
<embodiment><br>
 <br>
FIG 7 illustrates a method for multiplexing and mapping data information and<br>
control information to a set of resource elements according to an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG 7, control information 1 is mapped in a time axis (symbol<br>
axis) direction and control information 2 is mapped to resource elements corresponding<br>
to symbols next to symbols to which an RS is mapped. That is, the control<br>
information 2 is mapped to the above-described first symbol period area.<br>
The control information 1 is mapped to one or more successive resource<br>
elements including the last resource element except for resource elements allocated for<br>
RS mapping within the whole area shown in FIG. 7. The control information 1 may be<br>
mapped in order of (1)→(2). Namely, the control information 1 may be mapped in a<br>
forward mapping order from the first resource element of an area to which the control<br>
information 1 is mapped. Alternatively, the control information 1 may be mapped in<br>
order of (2)→(1). That is, the control information 1 may be mapped in a backward<br>
mapping order from the last resource element of the area to which the control<br>
information 1 is mapped.<br>
The control information 2 is mapped to resource elements located just before<br>
or just after resource elements to which the RS is mapped. For example, if the RS is<br>
 <br>
mapped to a j-th resource element, the control information 2 may be mapped to a (j-1)-<br>
th resource element and a (j+l)-th resource element. The control information 2 is<br>
mapped in a forward, backward, or specific mapping order in the first symbol period<br>
area.<br>
The above method may be modified to up-down or right-left symmetry in a<br>
set of resource elements of FIG 7. Namely, the control information 1 may be mapped<br>
to one or more successive resource elements including the first resource element, except<br>
for the resource elements allocated for RS mapping in the whole area shown in FIG 7.<br>
In this case, the control information 1 may be mapped in a forward or backward<br>
mapping order. The control information 2 is mapped to the first symbol period area<br>
and may be mapped in a forward, backward, or specific mapping order in the first<br>
symbol period area.<br>
In FIG. 7, the control information 1 does not puncture data information. In<br>
other words, the control information 1 rate-matches with the data information. The<br>
control information 1 may be constructed in such a form that control information having<br>
different properties is concatenated. The control information 2 may puncture the data<br>
information and/or the control information 1 in the first symbol period area. If the<br>
number of symbols of the control information 2 is greater than the number of resource<br>
 <br>
elements of the first symbol period area, the control information 2 may puncture the<br>
control information 1 mapped outside the first symbol period area.<br>
<embodiment><br>
FIG 8 illustrates a method for multiplexing and mapping data information and<br>
control information to a set of resource elements according to another exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In FIG. 8, control information 1 is mapped by the same method as the method<br>
used in FIG 7. Control information 2 and control information 3 are mapped to a first<br>
symbol period area. The control information 2 is mapped in a forward, backward, or<br>
specific mapping order in the first symbol period area. The control information 3 is<br>
mapped in a forward, backward, or specific mapping order in an area except for an area<br>
to which the control information 2 is mapped in the first symbol period area. If the<br>
control information 3 does not exist, the method of FIG 8 is the same as the method of<br>
FIG. 7.<br>
In FIG. 8, the control information 1 does not puncture data information.<br>
Namely, the control information 1 rate-matches with the data information. The control<br>
information 1 may be constructed in such a form that control information having<br>
 <br>
different properties is concatenated. The control information 2 and/or the control<br>
information 3 may puncture the data information and/or the control information 1 in the<br>
first symbol period area. If the sum of the number of symbols of the control<br>
information 2 and the number of symbols of the control information 3 is greater than the<br>
number of resource elements of the first symbol period area, the control information 2<br>
and/or the control information 3 may puncture the control information 1 outside the first<br>
symbol period area. Alternatively, the control information 2 and/or the control<br>
information 3 may be transmitted through resource elements ensured by rate matching<br>
for the data information.<br>
If the sum of the number of symbols of the control information 2 and the<br>
number of symbols of the control information 3 is greater than die number of resource<br>
elements of the first symbol period area, control information having a higher priority of<br>
the control information 2 and control information 3 may replace control information<br>
having a lower priority for mapping. In other words, all the control information of a<br>
high priority is first mapped to the first symbol period area and N information out of the<br>
control information of a low priority is mapped to the first symbol period area. Here,<br>
N is a value obtained by subtracting the number of resource elements to which the<br>
control information of a higher priority is mapped from the number of resource<br>
 <br>
elements of the first symbol period area. For example, if a priority of the control<br>
information 2 is higher than a priority of the control information 3, all the control<br>
information 2 is first mapped to the first symbol period area and the control information<br>
3 is mapped to the remaining resource elements in the first symbol period area.<br>
Therefore, a part of the control information 3 may not be mapped to the first symbol<br>
period area.<br>
The method of FIG 8 may be modified to up-down or right-left symmetry in<br>
the set of resource elements of FIG. 8 as illustrated in FIG. 7. Namely, the control<br>
information 1 may be mapped to one or more successive resource elements including<br>
the first resource element, except for resource elements to which an RS is mapped in a<br>
set of resource elements. In this case, the control information 1 may be mapped in a<br>
forward or backward mapping order. The control information 2 may be mapped in a<br>
forward, backward, or specific mapping order in the first symbol period area. The<br>
control information 3 may be mapped in a forward, backward, or specific mapping<br>
order from a next resource element of the last resource element to which the control<br>
information 2 is mapped.<br>
<embodiment><br>
 <br>
FIG 9 illustrates a method for multiplexing and mapping data information and<br>
control information to a set of resource elements according to a further exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In FIG 9, control information 1 is mapped by the same method as the method<br>
used in FIG 7. Control information 2 and control information 3 are mapped to<br>
resource elements of the first symbol period area. The control information 2 is<br>
mapped in a forward, backward, or specific mapping order in the first symbol period<br>
area. The control information 3 may be mapped in a forward, backward, or specific<br>
mapping order to the first symbol period area, except for an area to which the control<br>
information 1 is mapped within the first symbol period area. If the control information<br>
2 does not exist, the control information 1 and the control information 3 are mapped<br>
with dropping the control information 2 in FIG 9, and if the control information 3 does<br>
not exist, the control information 1 and the control information 2 may be mapped with<br>
dropping the control information 3 in FIG 9.<br>
In FIG. 9, the control information 1 does not puncture data information. That<br>
is, the control information 1 rate-matches with the data information. The control<br>
information 1 may be constructed in such a form that control information having<br>
different properties is concatenated. The control information 2 and/or the control<br>
 <br>
information 3 may puncture the data information and/or the control information 1 in the<br>
first symbol period area. If the sum of the number of symbols of the control<br>
information 2 and the number of symbols of the control information 3 is greater than the<br>
number of resource elements of the first symbol period area, the control information 2<br>
and/or the control information 3 may puncture the control information 1 outside the first<br>
symbol period area. Alternatively, the control information 2 and/or the control<br>
information 3 may be transmitted through resource elements ensured by rate matching<br>
for the data information.<br>
If the sum of the number of symbols of the control information 2 and the<br>
number of symbols of the control information 3 is greater than the number of resource<br>
elements of the first symbol period area, control information of a higher priority of the<br>
control information 2 and the control information 3 may replace control information of<br>
a lower priority for mapping. This is the same as described in FIG 8.<br>
The method of FIG. 9 may be modified to up-down or right-left symmetry in<br>
the set of resource elements of FIG. 9 as described in FIG. 7. Namely, the control<br>
information 1 may be mapped to one or more successive resource elements including<br>
the first resource element, except for resource elements allocated for RS mapping in a<br>
set of resource elements. In this case, the control information 1 may be mapped in a<br>
 <br>
forward or backward mapping order. The control information 2 is mapped in a<br>
forward, backward, or specific mapping order in the first symbol period area. The<br>
control information 3 may be mapped in a forward, backward, or specific mapping<br>
order to the first symbol period area, except for an area to which the control information<br>
1 is mapped within the first symbol period area.<br>
<embodiment><br>
FIGS. 10 and 11 illustrate a method for multiplexing and mapping data<br>
information and control information to a set of resource elements according to another<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In FIG 10, control information 1 is mapped by the same method as the<br>
method used in FIG 7. Control information 2 and control information 3 are mapped to<br>
a first symbol period area. The control information 2 and control information 3 may<br>
alternate with each other for mapping in the first symbol period area in units of<br>
subcarriers. Namely, 4 symbols of the control information 2 are mapped to resource<br>
elements of the first subcarrier of a whole area shown in FIG 10, and 4 symbols of the<br>
control information 3 are mapped to resource elements of the second subcarrier. This<br>
process is repeated in units of subcarriers. Assuming that the number of symbols of<br>
 <br>
the control information 2 is less than the number of symbols of the control information<br>
3, all the symbols of the control information 2 are mapped and thereafter the symbols of<br>
the control information 3 may be mapped to the remaining subcarriers in the first<br>
symbol period area. If the number of the symbols of the control information 3 is less<br>
than the number of the symbols of the control information 2, the same mapping<br>
principle may be applied.<br>
Alternatively, the control information 2 may first be mapped to the first, third,<br>
and fifth subcarriers of the whole area shown in FIG 10, and next the control<br>
information 3 may be mapped to resource elements to which the control information 2<br>
is not mapped in the first symbol period area.<br>
In FIG. 10, the control information 1 does not puncture data information.<br>
Namely, the control information 1 rate-matches with the data information. The control<br>
information 1 may be constructed in such a form that control information having<br>
different properties is concatenated. The control information 2 and/or the control<br>
information 3 may puncture the data information and/or the control information 1 in the<br>
first symbol period area. If the sum of the number of symbols of the control<br>
information 2 and the number of symbols of the control information 3 is greater than the<br>
number of resource elements of the first symbol period area, the control information 2<br>
 <br>
and/or the control information 3 may puncture the control information 1 outside the first<br>
symbol period area. Alternatively, the control information 2 and/or the control<br>
information 3 may be transmitted through resource elements ensured by rate matching<br>
for the data information.<br>
If the sum of the number of the symbols of the control information 2 and the<br>
number of the symbols of the control information 3 is greater than the number of<br>
resource elements belonging to the first symbol period area, control information having<br>
a higher priority of the control information 2 and the control information 3 may replace<br>
control information having a lower priority. This is the same as described in FIG. 8.<br>
The method of FIG. 10 may be modified to up-down or right-left symmetry in<br>
a set of resource elements, as described in FIG 7. That is, the control information I<br>
may be mapped to one or more successive resource elements including the first resource<br>
element, except for resource elements allocated for RS mapping in a set of resource<br>
elements. The control information 2 may be mapped in a backward mapping order<br>
from the last resource element of the last subcarrier in the first symbol period area.<br>
The control information 2 and the control information 3 may alternate with each other in<br>
the first symbol period area in units of subcarriers. Namely, 4 symbols of the control<br>
information 2 are mapped to the last subcarrier of the whole area shown in FIG 10, and<br>
 <br>
4 symbols of the control information 3 are mapped to the second to the last subcarrier.<br>
This process may be repeated in units of subcarriers.<br>
FIG 11 is the same as FIG 10 except that the locations of the control<br>
information 2 and the control information 3 are interchanged.<br>
<embodiment><br>
FIG 12 illustrates a method for multiplexing and mapping data information<br>
and control information to a set of resource elements according to another exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In FIG. 12, control information 1 is mapped by the same method as the<br>
method used in FIG 7. Control information 2 is mapped to the first symbol period<br>
area, and control information 3 is mapped to resource elements of a symbol period<br>
separated from the RS symbol period by one symbol period. Namely, the control<br>
information 3 is mapped to the above-described second symbol period area. The<br>
control information 2 is mapped in a forward, backward, or specific mapping order in<br>
the first symbol period area. The control information 3 is mapped in a forward,<br>
backward, or specific mapping order in the second symbol period area. If the control<br>
information 3 does not exist, the method of FIG. 12 is the same as the method of FIG. 7.<br>
 <br>
If the control information 2 does not exist, the control information 1 and the control<br>
information 3 are mapped with dropping the control information 2 in FIG. 12, and if the<br>
control information 3 does not exist, the control information 1 and the control<br>
information 2 may be mapped with dropping the control information 3 in FIG 12.<br>
If the control information 3 is multiplexed by a puncturing scheme,<br>
puncturing of the control information 1 can be reduced by mapping the control<br>
information 3 to the second symbol period area, that is, to resource elements next to<br>
resource elements to which the control information 2 is mapped.<br>
In FIG 12, the control information 1 does not puncture data information.<br>
Namely, the control information 1 rate-matches with the data information. The control<br>
information 1 may be constructed in such a form that control information having<br>
different properties is concatenated. The control information 2 may puncture the data<br>
information and/or the control information 1 in the first symbol period area. The<br>
control information 3 may puncture the data information and/or the control information<br>
1 in the second symbol period area. Alternatively, the control information 2 and/or the<br>
control information 3 may be transmitted through resource elements ensured by rate<br>
matching for the data information. For example, the control information 2 may<br>
puncture the data information and the control information 1, and control information 3<br>
 <br>
may rate-match with the data information and/or the control information 1 so that the<br>
control information 3 are inserted between the data information and/or control<br>
information 1.<br>
If the number of symbols of the control information 2 is greater than the<br>
number of resource elements of the first symbol period area, the control information 2<br>
may puncture the control information 1 outside the first symbol period area. If the<br>
number of symbols of the control information 3 is greater than the number of resource<br>
elements of the second symbol period area, the control information 3 may puncture the<br>
control information 1 outside the second symbol period area.<br>
The method of FIG 12 may be modified to up-down or right-left symmetry in<br>
a set of resource elements. Such a configuration will now be described in conjunction<br>
with FIG 13.<br>
<embodiment><br>
FIG 13 illustrates a method for multiplexing and mapping data information<br>
and control information to a set of resource elements according to another exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In FIG 13, control information 1 may be mapped to one or more successive<br>
 <br>
resource elements including the first resource element, except for resource elements<br>
allocated for RS mapping in a whole area shown in FIG. 13. Control information 2 is<br>
mapped to the above-described first symbol period area and control information 3 is<br>
mapped to the above-described second symbol period area. Namely, the control<br>
information 2 is mapped to a symbol period before and after a symbol period to which<br>
the RS is mapped, and the control information 3 is mapped to a symbol period separated<br>
by one symbol period from the symbol period to which the RS is mapped. The control<br>
information 2 may be mapped in a forward, backward, or specific mapping order in the<br>
first symbol period area. The control information 3 may be mapped in a forward,<br>
backward, or specific mapping order in the second symbol period area. If the control<br>
information 2 does not exist, the control information 1 and the control information 3<br>
may be mapped with dropping the control information 2 in FIG 13, and if the control<br>
information 3 does not exist, the control information 1 and the control information 2<br>
may be mapped with dropping the control information 3 in FIG. 13.<br>
If the control information 3 is multiplexed in a manner of puncturing other<br>
information, puncturing of the control information 1 can be reduced by mapping the<br>
control information 3 to the second symbol period area, that is, to resource elements<br>
next to resource elements to which the control information 2 is mapped.<br>
 <br>
In FIG. 13, the control information 1 does not puncture data information.<br>
Namely, the control information 1 rate-matches with the data information. The control<br>
information 1 may be constructed in such a form that control information having<br>
different properties is concatenated. The control information 2 may puncture the data<br>
information and/or the control information 1 mapped to the first symbol period area.<br>
The control information 3 may puncture the data information and/or the control<br>
information 1 mapped to the second symbol period area.<br>
Alternatively, the control information 2 and/or the control information 3 may<br>
be transmitted through resource elements ensured through rate matching for the data<br>
information. For example, the control information 2 may puncture the data<br>
information and the control information 1, and the control information 3 may rate-match<br>
with the data information and/or the control information 1 so that the control<br>
information 3 are inserted between the data information and/or the control information 1.<br>
If the number of symbols of the control information 2 is greater than the<br>
number of resource elements of the first symbol period area, the control information 2<br>
may puncture the control information 1 outside the first symbol period area. If the<br>
number of symbols of the control information 3 is greater than the number of resource<br>
elements of the second symbol period area, the control information 3 may puncture the<br>
 <br>
control information 1 outside the second symbol period area.<br>
In the embodiment of FIG 13, the control information 1 may be multiplexed<br>
with the data information before being mapped to a set of resource elements. That is,<br>
the control information 1 and the data information are multiplexed to generate a<br>
multiplexed stream so that the data information is arranged after the control information<br>
1. Next, the multiplexed stream is mapped in a forward mapping order from the first<br>
resource element of a whole area shown in FIG 13, or in a backward mapping order<br>
from the last resource element of the whole area shown in FIG 10. By such a method,<br>
the control information 1 can be mapped to one or more successive resource elements<br>
including the first or last resource element, except for resource element allocated for RS<br>
mapping in the whole area shown in FIG 10. It will be appreciated that even if the<br>
control information 1 does not exist, the above-described embodiments may be used.<br>
If the control information 2 does not exist, the control information 1 and the control<br>
information 3 are mapped with dropping the control information 2 in FIG. 13, and if the<br>
control information 3 does not exist, the control information 1 and the control<br>
information 2 may be mapped with dropping the control information 3 in FIG. 13.<br>
Since the structure of FIG. 13 is symmetrical to the structure of FIG 12, the<br>
method in FIG 13 shares characteristics described in FIG 12. Hereinafter, in the<br>
 <br>
method of FIG 12 or FIG. 13, the location of the control information 3 will be described<br>
in detail with reference to Table 1 to Table 9.<br>
Before a description of Table 1 to Table 9 is given, the above-described<br>
embodiments of FIGS. 7 to 13 will be described in more detail. The control<br>
information 1 may be multiplexed with the data information before being mapped to a<br>
set of resource elements. Namely, the control information 1 and the data information<br>
are multiplexed to generate a multiplexed stream so that the data information is<br>
arranged after the control information 1. Next, the multiplexed stream is mapped in a<br>
forward mapping order from the first resource element of the whole area shown in each<br>
drawing, or in a backward mapping order from the last resource element of the whole<br>
area shown in each drawing. By such a method, the control information 1 can be<br>
mapped to one or more successive resource elements including the first or last resource<br>
element, except for resource elements allocated for RS mapping within the whole area<br>
of a set of resource elements. Even though the control information 1 does not exist, it<br>
will be appreciated that the above-described embodiments may be used.<br>
In the embodiments of FIGS. 8 to 13, if the control information 2 does not<br>
exist, the control information 1 and the control information 3 are mapped without the<br>
control information 2 in each drawing, and if the control information 3 does not exist,<br>
 <br>
the control information 1 and the control information 2 may be mapped without the<br>
control information 3 in each drawing.<br>
In the method of FIG 12 or FIG 13, the location of the control information 3,<br>
that is, the second symbol period may be defined as in any one of the following Table 1<br>
to Table 9. Table 1 to Table 9 indicate a symbol period to which the control<br>
information 3 can be mapped according to a configuration of a cyclic prefix (CP) and a<br>
configuration of a sounding reference signal (SRS). Although in FIG 12 or FIG. 13 a<br>
normal CP is used as a CP, an extended CP may be applied by the same method.<br>
FIG 14a illustrates a configuration of an exemplary embodiment in which a<br>
normal CP is used, and FIG 14b illustrates a configuration in which an extended CP is<br>
used.<br>
A symbol period to which data information and control information are<br>
mapped may be changed by the configuration of a CP or the configuration of an SRS.<br>
When a normal CP is used, one subframe is comprised of 14 symbol periods as shown<br>
in FIG 14a. It is assumed in Table 1 to Table 9 that an RS is located in the fourth<br>
('4') and eleventh ('11') symbol periods among the 14 symbol periods. When an<br>
extended CP is used, one subframe is comprised of 12 symbol periods as shown in FIG.<br>
14b. It is assumed in Table 1 to Table 7 that the RS is located in the fourth ('4) and<br>
 <br>
tenth ('10') symbol periods. Meanwhile, symbol periods in which the RS is located<br>
may be changed unlike Table 1 to Table 9, and in this case symbol periods to which the<br>
data information and the control information are mapped may be changed unlike Table 1<br>
to Table 9.<br>
In Table 1 to Table 9, numbers within '{ }' of 'Column Set' indicate symbol<br>
periods to which the control information 3 can be mapped. These numbers are<br>
allocated except for symbol periods allocated for RS mapping in FIGS. 14a and 14b.<br>
In more detail, numbers in '{ }' denote symbol periods corresponding to numbers<br>
arranged in the bottom of FIG. 14a and/or FIG. 14 b. Numbers in ' { }' may be 0 to 11<br>
in the normal CP and may be 0 to 9 in the extended CP.<br>
Table 1 to Table 9 include configurations in which an SRS is mapped to the<br>
first symbol period and to the last symbol period. In Table 1 to Table 9, 'First SC-<br>
FDMA symbol' means that the SRS is mapped to the first symbol period, 'Last SC-<br>
FDMA symbol' means that the SRS is mapped to the last symbol period, and 'No SRS'<br>
means that no SRS is mapped.<br>
[Table 1]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
In Table 1, in the last SC-FDMA symbol of the extended CP, one of multiple<br>
column sets may be used.<br>
[Table 2]<br>
 <br>
In the extended CP, an SRS may not be permitted to be mapped to the last<br>
symbol period, or even if the SRS is permitted, the SRS may be dropped. Then as<br>
illustrated in Table 2, the 'Last SC-FDMA symbol' may have the same column set as the<br>
'No SRS'.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The 'Last SC-FDMA symbol' of the extended CP of Table 3 represents that<br>
the location of symbol periods to which the control information 3 is mapped may<br>
be modified due to the SRS.<br>
 <br>
In the extended CP, the SRS may not be permitted to be mapped to the last<br>
symbol period, or even if the SRS is permitted, the SRS may be dropped. The<br>
extended CP of Table 4 can be used when the 'Last SC-FDMA symbol' SRS is not<br>
 <br>
permitted, or the 'Last SC-FDMA symbol' SRS can be dropped even though the 'Last<br>
SC-FDMA symbol' SRS is is permitted. If the first SC-FDMA symbol SRS is not used,<br>
the extended CP of Table 4 may be constructed without the first SC-FDMA symbol part<br>
(including 'Column set' thereof)-<br>
 <br>
Referring to FIGS. 14a and 14b, it can be understood that the configuration of<br>
'Column Set' of Table 5 corresponds to the second symbol period area. That is, the<br>
control information 3 is mapped to a symbol period separated from a symbol period<br>
allocated for RS mapping by one symbol period. Although number '9' in 'Last SC-<br>
FDMA symbol' of the extended CP indicates the location of the SRS, such a<br>
configuration may be used when the SRS is not permitted to be mapped to the last<br>
symbol period, or when the SRS is dropped even though the SRS is permitted. Further,<br>
since the location of the 'Column Set' in each CP configuration is the same, Table 5 may<br>
be indicated by a configuration without the SRS.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Referring to FIGS. 14a and 14b, it can be understood that each configuration<br>
of Table 6 except for 'Last SC-FDMA symbol' in the extended CP corresponds to the<br>
second symbol period area. Moreover, it can be understood that the control<br>
information 3 is not mapped to resource elements of the first symbol period. 'Last SC-<br>
FDMA symbol' of the extended CP of Table 6 is not mapped to a symbol period '9'<br>
because an SRS is mapped to the location of the symbol period '9'. Comparing Table<br>
6 with Table 5, the configurations of 'Last SC-FDMA symbol' in the extended CP are<br>
different. Namely, the control symbol 3 located in the symbol period '9' in Table 5 is<br>
mapped to a symbol period '5' which is not adjacent to a symbol period allocated for RS<br>
mapping in Table 6. In the extended CP of Table 6, 'Column set' {1, 4, 6, 5} of 'Last<br>
SC-FDMA symbol' means that a symbol period '6' may have a higher priority for<br>
mapping than a symbol period '5' because the symbol period '6' is nearer to the symbol<br>
 <br>
period allocated for RS mapping are mapped than the symbol period '5'. In more<br>
detail, in a process of uniformly filling the control information to each symbol period<br>
symbol, the symbol period '6' has priority over the symbol period '5' if the control<br>
information should be filled in only one of the symbols periods '5' and '6'. However,<br>
even though the column set is indicated by {1, 4, 6, 5}, priority may be allocated in<br>
order of {1, 4, 5, 6}. The location of the symbol period to which the control<br>
information 3 is mapped is important.<br>
 <br>
Referring to FIGS. 14a and 14b, it can be appreciated that the configuration of<br>
the extended CP of Table 7 corresponds to the second symbol period area. It can also<br>
be appreciated in Table 7 that the control information 3 is not mapped to resource<br>
elements of the first symbol period. Unlike Table 5 and Table 6, Table 7 has the same<br>
'Column Set' in the extended CP irrespective of an SRS configuration. In the extended<br>
CP of Table 7, 'Column set' {1, 4, 6, 5} of 'Last SC-FDMA symbol' means that a<br>
 <br>
symbol period '6' may have a higher priority for mapping than a symbol period '5'<br>
because the symbol period '6' is nearer to the symbol period allocated for RS mapping<br>
than the symbol period '5'. In more detail, in a process of uniformly filling the control<br>
information to each symbol period symbol, the symbol period '6' has priority over the<br>
symbol period '5' if the control information should be filled in only one of the symbol<br>
periods '5' and '6'. However, even though the column set is indicated by {1, 4, 6, 5},<br>
priority may be allocated in order of {1,4, 5,6}. The location of the symbol period to<br>
which the control information 3 is mapped is important. Since Table 7 has the same<br>
'Column Set' in each CP irrespective of the SRS configuration, Table 7 may be<br>
indicated without the SRS configuration.<br>
FIGS. 15a and 15b illustrate exemplary structures of an extended CP to<br>
explain configurations of the following Table 8 and Table 9.<br>
 <br>
Table 8 illustrates a configuration when a symbol period allocated for RS<br>
 <br>
mapping in an extended CP is changed. Especially, it is assumed in Table 8 that the<br>
RS is located in the third ('(3)') and the ninth ('9') symbol periods (refer to FIG 15a).<br>
In the extended CP of Table 8, the control information 3 is mapped to a symbol period<br>
separated from the symbol period allocated for RS mapping by one symbol period.<br>
That is, the control information 3 is mapped to the second symbol period. Referring to<br>
Table 8, it can be appreciated that the location of the symbol period to which the control<br>
information 3 is mapped may be changed according to locations of an RS and an SRS.<br>
 <br>
Table 9 illustrates a configuration when a symbol period allocated for RS<br>
mapping in the extended CP is changed. Especially, it is assumed in Table 9 that the<br>
RS is located in the fourth ('4') and the ninth ('9') symbol periods (refer to FIG. 15b).<br>
FIGS. 16 and 17 illustrate an example of locations to which an SRS and an<br>
RS are allocated within one subframe in case of a normal CP and an extended CP,<br>
respectively.<br>
 <br>
FIG 16 and FIG 17 correspond to FIGS. 14a and FIG 14b, respectively, and<br>
illustrate cases where an SRS is not mapped and an SRS is mapped to the last symbol.<br>
The control information 3 is mapped to a symbol period separated by one symbol length<br>
from a symbol period allocated for RS mapping in consideration of a modulation order.<br>
Therefore, in FIG. 16, the control information 3 is mapped to symbol periods having<br>
indexes of 1, 4, 7, and 10. In FIG 17, the control information 3 is mapped to symbol<br>
periods having indexes of 1,4, 6, and 9.<br>
<embodiment><br>
FIGS. 18a to 18f illustrate a mapping order of control information 2 and/or<br>
control information 3 in a time direction within one subcarrier according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
Each of the control information 2 and the control information 3 can be<br>
mapped to a maximum of 4 resource elements per subcarrier. FIGS. 18a to 18f<br>
illustrate a mapping order of symbols for 4 resource elements within one subcarrier.<br>
Although a symbol number to which each control information is mapped may be<br>
changed according to a CP configuration, an relative indexing order may be determined<br>
as illustrated in FIGS. 18a to 18f. FIGS. 18a to 18f show examples of mapping 10<br>
 <br>
symbols generated after encoding in a normal CP configuration without an SRS.<br>
Hereinafter, FIGS. 18a to 18f will be described based on the control<br>
information 2.<br>
In FIGS. 18a to 18f, only the first symbol period area is shown. In FIG 18a,<br>
the control information 2 is mapped in an upward direction from the last subcarrier of<br>
the first symbol period area and is mapped according to time flow within each subcarrier.<br>
In this case, control information 2 is mapped to all 4 available resource elements within<br>
the last subcarrier of the first symbol period area.<br>
In FIG. 18b, the control information 2 is mapped in a downward direction<br>
from a specific subcarrier of the first symbol period area in consideration of the number<br>
of symbols of the control information 2 and is mapped according to time flow within<br>
each subcarrier. In this case, control information 2 is mapped to all 4 available<br>
resource elements within the specific subcarrier and is mapped also to resource elements<br>
within the last subcarrier of the first symbol period area.<br>
In FIG. 18c, the control information 2 is mapped in a downward direction<br>
from a specific subcarrier of the first symbol period area in consideration of the number<br>
of symbols of the control information 2 and is mapped according to time flow within<br>
each subcarrier. In this case, the control information 2 is mapped to all 4 available<br>
 <br>
resource elements within the last subcarrier of the first symbol period area.<br>
In FIG. 18d, the control information 2 is mapped in an upward direction from<br>
the last subcarrier of the first symbol period area and is mapped in reverse order of time<br>
flow within each subcarrier. In this case, the control information 2 is mapped to all 4<br>
available resource elements within the last subcarrier of the first symbol period area.<br>
In this manner, when four or more of the control information 2 are mapped, it is<br>
guaranteed that all of the four available resource elements within the last subcarrier of<br>
the first symbol period area are used for mapping.<br>
In FIG. 18e, the control information 2 is mapped in an upward direction from<br>
the last subcarrier of the first symbol period area in consideration of the number of<br>
symbols of the control information 2 and is mapped in reverse order of time flow within<br>
each subcarrier. In this case, the control information 2 is mapped to all 4 available<br>
resource elements within the top subcarrier.<br>
FIG. 18f, which is a modification of the method of FIG 18d, modifies a<br>
mapping order of 4 resource elements within each subcarrier. In more detail, the<br>
control information 2 is cyclically shifted by one to the right in the method in which<br>
mapping is performed in a reverse order of time flow within each subcarrier. The<br>
control information 2 may be cyclically shifted by two or three.<br>
 <br>
While FIGS. 18a to 18f illustrate a mapping order of the control information 2,<br>
the same method may be applied to the control information 3.<br>
FIGS. 19a to 21b are views explaining in detail the methods of FIGS. 18a to<br>
18f, and illustrate examples of applying the methods of FIGS. 18a to 18f to a set of<br>
resource elements having a matrix structure of RxC. FIGS. 19a and 19b correspond to<br>
FIGS. 18a and 18b, FIGS. 20a and 20b correspond to FIGS. 18c and 18d, and FIGS.<br>
21a and 21b correspond to FIGS. 18e and 18f.<br>
In FIGS. 2 to 21b, a relative relationship of a location to which the data<br>
information and the control information are mapped and a location to which an RS is<br>
mapped has been described using a set of physical resource elements including resource<br>
elements allocated for RS mapping. It will be understood that the above-described<br>
embodiments may be described using a structure of a time-frequency matrix excluding<br>
the resource elements allocated for RS mapping from the set of physical resource<br>
elements.<br>
The data information and control information mapped to the set of physical<br>
resource elements in FIGS. 2 to 21b may be scrambled and modulation-mapped, and<br>
then may be input to a resource element mapper through a transform precoder as in a<br>
processing method of a PUSCH in 3GPP TS 36.211. Abbreviations used herein refer<br>
 <br>
to abbreviations disclosed in 3GPP TS 36.212.<br>
In the method of FIG. 13 according to the present invention, a method for<br>
applying an example of multiplexing CQI/PMI and RI, which are control information,<br>
with data information, to 3GPP TS 36.212 V8.2.0 will be described.<br>
Hereinafter,  denotes input data,  denotes<br>
input rank information (RI), and denotes a multiplexed output. Here,<br>
 <br>
Multiplexing can be performed through the following steps.<br>
1.	Determine the number of symbols per subframe using the following<br>
equation:<br>
 <br>
Here, denotes the number of SC-FDMA symbols which transmit a<br>
PUSCH in one subframe, denotes the number of symbols within one uplink slot,<br>
NSRS denotes the number of symbols used to transmit an SRS within one subframe.<br>
2.	Determine the number G' of modulation symbols of data information using<br>
the following equation:<br>
G' = G/Qml (where Qml is a modulation order of data)<br>
3.	Determine the number Q' of modulation symbols of rank information using<br>
 <br>
the following equation:<br>
Q' = Q / Qm2 (where Qm2 is a modulation order of rank information)<br>
4.	Determine the number K of subcarriers occupied by modulation symbols of<br>
rank information using the following equation:<br>
K = ceil (Q'/maximum number of resources for rank information)<br>
5.	Determine the number of modulation symbols of rank information per<br>
symbol.<br>
The number of modulation symbols of rank information per symbol is<br>
determined by a combination of 'floor' and 'ceil' in a symbol position occupied by each<br>
rank information based on Q' or by a method determined according to a remainder<br>
obtained by dividing the number of modulation symbols of rank information by the<br>
number of symbols. In this case, the modulation symbols may be equally divided to a<br>
maximum of two slots, and may be allocated from a front slot to a back slot or vice<br>
versa.<br>
6.	Multiplex the modulation symbols of the data information and the rank<br>
information.<br>
Since the rank information should have a form stacked from the bottom of a<br>
subcarrier, the data information should be mapped by a time-priority scheme and the<br>
 <br>
rank information should be mapped in a corresponding symbol. At this time, since the<br>
data information is mapped from the top subcarrier, the location of a subcarrier in which<br>
rank information can be located is determined by subtracting a result of the above step 2<br>
from the entire number of subcarriers. Then the rank information is mapped in<br>
consideration of the number of symbols determined in the above step 3. This can be<br>
represented as a pseudo code as follows.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
A detailed method for locating rank information between data due to rate<br>
matching rather than puncturing may be modified entirely or partially.<br>
Hereinafter, in the method of FIG 13 according to the present invention,<br>
another method of applying an example of multiplexing CQI/PMI and RI, which are<br>
control information, with data information to 3GPP TS 36.212 V8.2.0 will be described.<br>
 <br>
It is assumed that the amount of RI does not intrude upon resources occupied<br>
by CQI/PMI (the number of subcarriers including symbols occupied by RI and the<br>
number of subcarriers occupied by CQI/PMI do not exceed the entire number of<br>
subcarriers per subframe for PUSCH transmission). Therefore, each of the RI,<br>
CQI/PMI, and data information should be considered to have a size which does not<br>
intrude upon each other. If the RI, CQI/PMI, and data information intrude upon one<br>
another, the RI may use a modified form of the following method by puncturing the<br>
CQI/PMI.<br>
Here,  denotes a CQI/PMI input, <br>
denotes a data information input,   (a coded bit) or<br>
  (vector sequence, a symbol form considering a<br>
modulation order) denotes an RI input, and  denotes an output. If<br>
the RI is a coded bit, then and and H'=H/Qm. If the RI is a vector<br>
sequence, then <br>
  denotes the number of symbols per subframe<br>
for PUSCH transmission, and  denotes the number of subcarriers<br>
carrying a PUSCH within one subframe.<br>
The number of subcarriers used for rank information within one subcarrier<br>
 <br>
can be expressed by two equations. Namely, if the RI is a coded bit, then<br>
  Here, 4 is the maximum number of resources for the RI. A<br>
symbol such as ceil or floor need not be used when a result of division has no remainder.<br>
If the RI is a vector sequence, then  Here, 4 is the maximum number<br>
of resources for the RI. A symbol such as ceil or floor need not be used when a result<br>
of division has no remainder.<br>
The number of rank information encoded as a bit/vector sequence within the<br>
i-th symbol carrying a PUSCH within one subframe is expressed by ni.<br>
The number of bit/vector sequences for the RI mapped to respective symbols<br>
carrying a PUSCH with respect to a subframe having a normal CP may refer to Table 10<br>
to Table 12. Table 10 shows an ni value in a subframe having a normal CP. Table 11<br>
shows an ni value in a subframe having an extended CP without an SRS. Table 12<br>
shows an ni value in a subframe having an extended CP with an SRS in the last symbol.<br>
 <br>
Table 10 serves to evenly use symbols in which two slots and RI are located<br>
using ceil/floor down/modulo or a position priority of symbols in which the RI is<br>
 <br>
located. That is, the number of sequences may be different by about 1 by various<br>
combinations of i of 1&gt;4&gt;7&gt;10, 1&gt;7&gt;4&gt;10, or 4&gt;7&gt;1&gt;10 and Table 10 may be changed<br>
accordingly. Although two cases of QRANK and Q'RANK have been described, an<br>
equation using QRANK may be used if the Ri is a coded bit and an equation using Q'RANK<br>
may be used if the Ri is a vector sequence.<br>
 <br>
Table 11 serves to evenly use symbols in which two slots and RI are located<br>
using ceil/floor/modulo or a position priority of symbols in which the RI is located.<br>
That is, the number of sequences may be different by about 1 by various combinations<br>
of i of 1&gt;4&gt;6&gt;9, 1&gt;6&gt;4&gt;9, or 4&gt;6&gt;1&gt;9 and Table 11 may be changed accordingly.<br>
Although two cases of QRANK and Q'RANK have been described, an equation using<br>
QRANK may be used if the Ri is a coded bit and an equation using Q'RANK may be used if<br>
the Ri is a vector sequence.<br>
[Table 12]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Table 12 serves to use symbols in which two slots and RI are located using<br>
ceil/floor/modulo or a position priority of symbols in which the RI is located. That is,<br>
the number of sequences may be different by about 1 by various combinations of i of<br>
1&gt;4&gt;6&gt;5,1&gt;6&gt;5&gt;4, or 4&gt;6&gt;1&gt;5 and Table 12 may be changed accordingly. Although<br>
two cases of QRANK and Q'RANK have been described, an equation using QRANK may be<br>
used if the Ri is a coded bit and an equation using Q'RANK may be used if the Ri is a<br>
vector sequence.<br>
Control information, rank information, and data information may be<br>
multiplexed as follows.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>

 <br>
FIG 22 illustrates a processing structure for a UL-SCH transport channel<br>
according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Data is input to a<br>
coding unit with a maximum of one transport block every TTI. Referring to FIG 22,<br>
processes for attaching CRC to the transport block, segmenting a code block and<br>
attaching CRC to the segmented code block, channel-coding data information and<br>
control information, performing rate matching, concatenating the code block,<br>
multiplexing the data information and control information, and performing channel<br>
interleaving are carried out.<br>
Hereinafter, the process for attaching CRC to a transport block is described.<br>
Error detection is provided on UL-SCH transport blocks through a Cyclic Redundancy<br>
Check (CRC).<br>
The entire transport block is used to calculate the CRC parity bits. Denote<br>
the bits in a transport block delivered to layer 1 and the parity bits<br>

 <br>
The process for segmenting a code block and attaching CRC to the segmented<br>
code block will now be described. The bits input to the code block segmentation are<br>
denoted by where B is the number of bits in the transport block<br>
(including CRC).<br>
Code block segmentation and code block CRC attachment are performed<br>
according to subclause 5.1.2.<br>
The bits after code block segmentation are denoted by <br>
where r is the code block number and Kr is the number of bits for code block number r.<br>
Channel coding for a UL-SCH will now be described. Code blocks are<br>
delivered to the channel coding block. The bits in a code block are denoted by<br>
  , where r is the code block number, and Kr is the number of bits<br>
in code block number r. The total number of code blocks is denoted by C and each<br>
code block is individually turbo encoded according to subclause 5.1.3.2.<br>

with i = 0,1, and 2 and where D, is the number of bits on the z'-th coded stream for code<br>
block number <br>

arrives at the coding unit in the form of channel quality information (CQI and/or PMI),<br>
HARQ-ACK and rank indication. Different coding rates for the control information<br>
 <br>
are achieved by allocating different number of coded symbols for its transmission.<br>
When control data are transmitted in the PUSCH, the channel coding for HARQ-ACK,<br>
rank indication and channel quality information   is done independently.<br>
-	If HARQ-ACK consists of 1 -bit of information, it is first<br>
encoded according to Table 5.2.2-1.<br>
-	If HARQ-ACK consists of 2-bits of information, <br>
first encoded according to Table 5.2.2-2.<br>
 <br>
[Note from the editor: the 'x' above is a placeholder for 211 to treat bits with<br>
this value differently when performing scrambling of coded bits. This will enable<br>
limiting the constellation size used for ACK transmission in PUSCH to QPSK.]<br>
The bit sequence  is obtained by concatenation of<br>
multiple encoded HARQ-ACK blocks where QACK is the total number of coded bit for<br>
 <br>
all the encoded HARQ-ACK blocks. The vector sequence output of the channel<br>
coding for HARQ-ACK information is denoted by where<br>

the RI bits in a way that maximizes the Euclidean distance of the modulation symbols<br>
carrying rank information.<br>
The bit sequence is obtained by concatenation of<br>
multiple encoded RI blocks where QRJ is the total number of coded bit for all the<br>
encoded RI blocks. The last concatenation of the encoded RI block may be partial so<br>

channel coding for rank information is denoted by  , where<br>
 <br>

control information denoted by and the coded bits of the UL-SCH<br>
 <br>
denoted by  The output of the data and control multiplexing<br>
operation is denoted by where H=(G+Q) and and<br>

resource element mapping for PUSCH in 3GPP TS 36.211 implements a time-first<br>
mapping of modulation symbols onto the transmit waveform while ensuring that the<br>

 <br>
sequence  is written onto the columns indicated by Table 18,<br>
and by sets of Qm rows starting from the last row and moving upwards. Note that this<br>
operation overwrites some of the channel interleaver entries obtained in step (4).<br>
