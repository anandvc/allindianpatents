				<td>Description<br>
Diesel-electric drive system<br>
The invention relates tc a diesel-electric drive system as<br>
claimed in the precharacterizing clause of claim 1.<br>
A drive system of this generic type is disclosed in the<br>
publication entitled "Energy Efficient Drive System for a<br>
Diesel Electric Shunting Locomotive", by Olaf Koerner, Jens<br>
Brand and Karsten Rechenberg, printed in the "EPE'2005"<br>
Conference Proceedings, of the: EPE Conference at Dresden<br>
between September 11 and 14 2005. This publication compares two<br>
diesel-electric drive systems having a permanent-magnet<br>
synchronous generator with one another. These two drive systems<br>
differ only in that the generator-side converter of the voltage<br>
intermediate-circuit converter is a diode rectifier on the one<br>
hand and a self-commutated pulse-controlled converter on the<br>
other. The self-commutated pulse-controlled converter is<br>
referred to in this publication as an IGBT rectifier. In both<br>
drive systems, a braking resistor can be connected to the<br>
intermediate circuit of the voltage intermediate-circuit<br>
converter. A thyristor which can be turned off is provided for<br>
this purpose, and is also referred to as a gate turn-off<br>
thyristor (GTO thyristor). By means of this pulse impedance the<br>
DC voltage in the intermediate circuit of the voltage<br>
intermediate-circuit converter, supplies energy to the<br>
intermediate circuit in the; braking mode, that is to say the<br>
load, in particular a roating-field machine, thus ensuring<br>
that the maximum permissiole intermediate-circuit voltage is<br>
not exceeded. A portion of this braking power can also be used<br>
to compensate for the drag torque of the idling diesel engine.<br>
This has the disadvantage that a further converter bridge arm<br>
must be used for the braning controller, and the additional<br>
rail system for this brakirg controller must be provided<br>
with the intermediate-circuit rail system. Depending on the<br>
braking power, it is possible that further converter bridge<br>
arms must be used for the braking controller.<br>
In addition, a control apparatus is required for the braking<br>
controller.<br>
DE 102 10 164 Al disclose.; an apparatus for multiple rectifier<br>
feeding of a permanent-magnet synchronous motor in a power<br>
station. This permanent-magnet synchronous generator has two<br>
polyphase stator winding systems with different numbers of<br>
turns. One winding system is connected to a controlled<br>
rectifier, for example an IGBT rectifier. The purpose of this<br>
controlled rectifier is to regulate the power output and thus<br>
the rotation speed of the permanent-magnet synchronous<br>
generator. For this purpose, in the range of low rotation<br>
speeds, current flows ard the electrical power thus flows<br>
exclusively via this winding system and thus via the controlled<br>
rectifier, which is connected to a DC voltage intermediate<br>
circuit. The second wilding system is connected to an<br>
uncontrolled rectifier, fc r example a multipulse diode bridge,<br>
which is likewise connected to the same DC voltage intermediate<br>
circuit as the controllec rectifier. If the phase-to-phase<br>
rotation voltage (also referred to as the rotor voltage) is<br>
greater than the intermediate-circuit voltage of the DC voltage<br>
intermediate circuit, a current can flow in the second winding<br>
system and is rectified via the uncontrolled rectifier in the<br>
DC voltage intermediate c.rcuit. In this case, because of the<br>
magnetic coupling betweer the first and the second winding<br>
system, the amplitude anc phase angle of the current in the<br>
second winding system can oe influenced by the current in the<br>
first winding system, vhich is regulated by the active<br>
rectifier (controlled reci.:.fier) . This means that the current<br>
in the winding system of the uncontrolled rectifier can also be<br>
regulated to a certain extent with the aid of the controlled<br>
rectifier. The majority o: the real power transmitted by this<br>
apparatus is carried by the uncontrolled rectifier, thus<br>
allowing the controlled rectifier to be designed for a low<br>
power, and thus to be cost-effective. With the aid of this<br>
controlled rectifier, which is in general also referred to as a<br>
self-commutated pulse-conrolled converter, heavily over-<br>
excited operation of the permanent-magnet synchronous generator<br>
is avoided. Furthermore, this compensates for harmonics in the<br>
generator torque, which are caused by the uncontrolled<br>
rectifier.<br>
In the case of diesel-electric traction drives, for example<br>
diesel locomotives or mining trucks, the generator which is<br>
fitted to this engine is ased to supply energy for the drive.<br>
The electrical voltage of :he generator is kept at a constant<br>
intermediate-circuit voltage by rr.eans of the diode rectifier or<br>
the IGBT rectifier, from wnich intermediate-circuit voltage the<br>
load-side self-commutated pulse-controlled converter of the<br>
drive motors is supplied. During electrical braking, the power<br>
flowing in the voltage intermediate-circuit converter is<br>
precisely reversed. The energy :.s supplied through the load-<br>
side self-commutated pulse-controlled converter to the voltage<br>
intermediate circuit of the voltage intermediate-circuit<br>
converter. Since the diese . engine cannot absorb braking power,<br>
the braking energy must be; converted to heat by means of a<br>
braking resistor. A voltage which is pulse-width-modulated by a<br>
brake controller is passed to a braking resistor for continuous<br>
power control.<br>
This procedure has the disadvantage that, in the braking mode,<br>
the rectifier (diode or IGBT rectifier) remains unused, while<br>
the braking controller ca mot be used in the traction mode.<br>
More power semiconductors than are necessary are therefore<br>
installed in the converter.<br>
The problem is now to find a solution and a circuit in which<br>
the power semiconductors can be used both in the traction mode<br>
and in the braking mode without having to reconfigure the<br>
topology by means of circuit breakers in this case.<br>
The invention is based or the discovery that, particularly at<br>
high power levels, the inportant factor is not the number of<br>
power<br>
semiconductors but their installed power or chip area.<br>
Particularly at high power levels, the power semiconductors are<br>
connected in parallel.<br>
The invention is now based on the object of improving the<br>
diesel-electric drive system of this generic type such that<br>
there is no need for an accitional braking controller.<br>
According to the inventiDn, this object is achieved by the<br>
characterizing features of claim 1 in conjunction with the<br>
features of its precharacterizing clause.<br>
Since a second generator-3ide self-commutated pulse-controlled<br>
converter is provided, the power of the generator-side self-<br>
commutated pulse-controlled converter of a diesel-electric<br>
drive system of the type in question is split between these two<br>
generator-side self-commutated pulse-controlled converters.<br>
This assumes that the generator now has two polyphase winding<br>
systems in the stator, jnstead of one winding system. This<br>
results in a further degrse of freedom, which can be used for<br>
connection of the braking resistors. According to the<br>
invention, a braking resistor connects at least one input phase<br>
of one generator-side self-commutated pulse-controlled<br>
converter to a corresponding input phase of the second<br>
generator-side self-commu;ated pulse-controlled converter of<br>
the voltage intermediate-circuit converter.<br>
This further treatment according to the invention of the<br>
diesel-electric drive system of this generic type makes it<br>
possible to completely dispense with a braking controller in<br>
the intermediate circuit of the voltage intermediate-circuit<br>
converter. This means that the installed power or the chip area<br>
of the voltage intermediat e-circuit converter according to the<br>
invention has been reduced in comparison to the generic<br>
intermediate-circuit converter, with the power output remaining<br>
unchanged.<br>
In a further embodiment of the; diesel-electric drive system<br>
according to the invention, the star points, which are passed<br>
out, of the two polyphase winding systems of the generator are<br>
electrically conductively connected to one another by means of<br>
a braking resistor. This further embodiment has the same<br>
advantages over the first embodiment.<br>
If the aim is to achieve a greater braking effect, then each<br>
input phase of the first generator-side self-commutated pulse-<br>
controlled converter is electrically conductively connected by<br>
means of a braking resistcr to a corresponding input phase of<br>
the second generator-side self-commutated pulse-controlled<br>
converter.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments of the diesel-electric drive<br>
system according to the invention can be found in dependent<br>
claims 3 to 6.<br>
In the traction mode, the two generator-side self-commutated<br>
pulse-controlled converters of the diesel-electric drive system<br>
according to the inversion are clocked in phase. In<br>
consequence, the differBace voltages across the braking<br>
resistors are zero, as a result of which no power can be<br>
converted in the braking resistors. The circuit therefore acts<br>
like a conventional generator system with one winding and one<br>
three-phase pulse-controlled converter.<br>
In the braking mode, the two generator-side self-commutated<br>
pulse-controlled converters of the diesel-electric drive system<br>
according to the inventio 1 are controlled such that a voltage<br>
zero phase-sequence systen is produced. A voltage zero phase-<br>
sequence system such as this is produced by shifting either the<br>
phase of a clock signal, or a duty ratio. This results in a<br>
time shift in the potential of one input phase of one<br>
generator-side self-commutated pulse-controlled converter with<br>
respect to a corresponding input phase of the other generator-<br>
side self-commutated pulse-controlled converter in the<br>
converter for the diesel-electric drive system according<br>
to the invention. A voltage is therefore dropped across the<br>
corresponding braking res.stor. The power which is converted in<br>
the braking resistors is governed by the time value of the<br>
shift. This means that the phase shift or the shift in the duty<br>
ratio must assume a predetermined value for a predetermined<br>
braking power.<br>
As a result of the phase shift of the clock signals or as a<br>
result of the shift in the duty ratio, the mean value of<br>
voltage remains the same ever one pulse period in corresponding<br>
input voltages of the two generator-side self-commutated pulse-<br>
controlled converters for the converter for the diesel-electric<br>
drive system. The generator current and its torque can<br>
therefore still be regulated independently, but at the same<br>
time excess energy (brakirg energy) can be converted to heat by<br>
means of the braking resistors, oy means of the phase shift or<br>
the shift in the duty ratio.<br>
In order to explain the invention further, reference is made to<br>
the drawing, which schematically illustrates one embodiment of<br>
a diesel-electric drive system according to the invention, and<br>

drive system of ziiis generic type;<br>

diesel-electric icive system;<br>

embodiment of a first embodiment of a voltage<br>
intermediate-circuit converter for a diesel-electric<br>
drive system according to the invention;<br>
Figure 4 shows clock signals and input phase voltages of two<br>
corresponding phases of the two generator-side self-<br>
commutated pulse..controlled converters for the<br>
converter shown i.n Figure 3, in the form of a diagram<br>
plotted against time;<br>
Figure 5 shows an equivalent circuit of a simplified version<br>
of the first embodiment of the diesel-electric drive<br>
system accordinc to the invention; and<br>
Figure 6 shows an equivalent circuit of a second embodiment of<br>
the diesel-electric drive system according to the<br>
invention.<br>
In Figure 1, which illustrates an equivalent circuit of a<br>
diesel-electric drive syst em of this generic type, 2 denotes a<br>
diesel engine, 4 a genera :or, in particular a permanent-magnet<br>
synchronous generator, a voltage intermediate-circuit<br>
converter, 8 a plurality of rotating-field machines, in<br>
particular three-phase asynchronous motors, and 10 denotes a<br>
braking chopper. The voltage intermediate-circuit converter has<br>
a generator-side and a load-side self-commutated pulse-<br>
controlled converter, 12 and 14, respectively, which are<br>
electrically conductively connected to one another on the DC<br>
voltage side by means of an intermediate circuit 18 which has<br>
an intermediate-circuit capacitor bank 16. The braking chopper<br>
10 is connected electrically in parallel with this intermediate<br>
circuit 18 and has a leaking resistor 20 and a braking<br>
controller 22, for example a thyristor which can be turned off,<br>
which are electrically connected in series. In addition, the<br>
illustration shows an auxiliary operation inverter 28.<br>
Auxiliary drives are connected to the AC voltage-side<br>
connections of the auxiliary operation inverter 28, although<br>
these are not illustrated explicitly here. The diesel engine 2<br>
and the permanent-magne t synchronous generator 4 are<br>
mechanically coupled to one another on the rotor side, with the<br>
stator side of this permc r.ent-magnet synchronous generator 4<br>
being linked to AC voltage..side connections of the generator-<br>
side self-commutated pulse--<br>
controlled converter 12 of the; voltage intermediate-circuit<br>
converter 6.<br>
Since this equivalent circuit is an equivalent circuit of a<br>
diesel-electric locomotive, 30 denotes a traction<br>
container which accommodates the converter electronics. The<br>
braking resistor and the diesel-driven permanent-magnet<br>
synchronous generator 4 are arranged outside this traction<br>
container 30. The four tiree-phase asynchronous motors 8 are<br>
motors for the two bogeys cf a diesel-electric locomotive.<br>
The braking resistor 20 which, in this equivalent circuit, is<br>
in the form of one res: stor, may also be in the form of<br>
resistors connected in series or parallel. The thyristor 22<br>
which can be turned off is a converter bridge arm module in<br>
this embodiment, in which only the associated freewheeling<br>
diode is used instead of a second thyristor which can be turned<br>
off.<br>
Figure 2 likewise shows an equivalent circuit of a diesel-<br>
electric drive system a;&gt; known from the initially cited<br>
publication "EPE'2005", Dresden". This equivalent circuit<br>
differs from the equivalent circuit shown in Figure 1 in that a<br>
diode rectifier 32 is provided instead of a generator-side<br>
self-commutated pulse-cont trolled converter 12 which, in this<br>
publication, is also referred to as an IGBT rectifier. This<br>
circuit of a diesel-electr..c drive system is less complex than<br>
the diesel-electric drive system shown in Figure 1 since only<br>
diodes are required for the generator-side converter. These do<br>
not require any drive device in the same way as the power<br>
semiconductor switches which can be turned off, in particular<br>
insulated gate bipolar iransistors (IGBT), of the IGBT<br>
rectifier in Figure 1. In the equivalent circuit in Figures 1<br>
and 2, an externally excited synchronous generator or else an<br>
asynchronous generator can likewise be used instead of the<br>
permanent-magnet synchronous generator 4. In the case of the<br>
externally excited synchronous generator, a circuit arrangement<br>
for field excitation is additionally required. In addition,<br>
when using an asynchronous generator, an additional circuit<br>
arrangement is required, by neans of which a field can be built<br>
up in the asynchronous generator.<br>
Irrespective of these different embodiments of the diesel-<br>
electric generator, the voltage intermediate-circuit converter<br>
6 remains the same. This means that a braking chopper 10 is<br>
always required in order to allow the rotating-field machines 8<br>
to be electrically braked. The bridge arm of the braking<br>
chopper 10, one implemeitation of the illustrated braking<br>
controller 22, is therefore required only when the diesel-<br>
electric drive system is in the braking mode. This braking<br>
controller is not used in the traction mode.<br>
Figure 3 schematically illustrates an equivalent circuit of one<br>
advantageous embodiment of a first embodiment of a voltage<br>
intermediate-circuit converter 34 for a diesel-electric drive<br>
system according to the invention. This equivalent circuit<br>
likewise illustrates a generator 36 for the diesel-electric<br>
drive system, as an equivalent circuit. This voltage<br>
intermediate-circuit comerter 34 differs from the known<br>
voltage intermediate-circiit converter 6 as shown in Figures 1<br>
and 2 in that two self-commutated pulse-controlled converters<br>
38 and 40 are provided oi the generator side and, on the DC<br>
voltage side, are connect 3d electrically in parallel with the<br>
intermediate-circuit capacitor bank 16 of the DC voltage<br>
intermediate circuit 18. In power terms, these two self-<br>
commutated pulse-controlled converters 38 and 40 correspond to<br>
the power of the self-comnutated pulse-controlled converter 12<br>
for the voltage intermedj.ate-circuit converter 6 shown in<br>
Figure 1. This means that the installed power and therefore the<br>
chip area used for the ower semiconductor switches of the<br>
generator-side converters is unchanged.<br>
On the input side, the generator-side self-commutated pulse-<br>
controlled converters 38 and 40, respectively, are electrically<br>
conductively connected to a three-phase winding system 42 and<br>
44, respectively, in the generator 36. In the equivalent<br>
circuit, a respective voltage source 4 6 and 48 and respective<br>
inductance 50 and 52 are iLLustrated for each phase of this<br>
generator 36, with two three-phase winding systems 42 and 44.<br>
Output phases R1, S1, T1 of the first three-phase winding<br>
system 42 of the generator 36<br>
are electrically conductively connected to corresponding output<br>
phases R2, S2, T2 of the second three-phase winding system 44<br>
of the generator 36 by ireans of a respective resistor 54, in<br>
particular a braking resi.itor 54 .<br>
This circuit of the volt age intermediate-circuit converter 34<br>
now allows various operat..ng modes:<br>
a) Traction mode:<br>
Since the two three-phase winding systems 42 and 44 of the<br>
generator 36 produce the same voltage Ui, U2, the generator-<br>
side self-commutated puls2-controlled converters 38 and 40 can<br>
be clocked in phase. "hese generator-side self-commutated<br>
pulse-controlled converters 38 and 40 have a pulse-width<br>
modulator, which is not illustrated explicitly in this figure,<br>
for continuous control o.: the power. A pulse-width modulator<br>
such as this is used to carry out sine-delta modulation, super<br>
sine modulation or space-vector modulation. In the case of<br>
sine-delta modulation, a set voltage U*, also referred to as a<br>
reference sine voltage, is compared with a high-frequency<br>
triangular waveform voltage UD. Three pulse-width-modulated<br>
phase voltages Ur,s,t/ by way of example, are produced at the<br>
output of a modulator such as this. If the two generator-side<br>
self-commutated pulse-cortrolled converters 38 and 40 are<br>
clocked in phase in the tiaction mode, then this corresponds to<br>
the two triangular waveform voltages UDi and UD2 being<br>
coincident. With the volteges Uri,Si,ti and Ur2,s2,t2, which are the<br>
same at all times, at tie inputs of the two generator-side<br>
self-commutated pulse-cortrolled converters 38 and 40, a<br>
difference voltage UBr in each case remains across a braking<br>
resistor 54, equal to zerc. Mo power is therefore lost in these<br>
braking resistors 54. The full power produced by the diesel-<br>
electric generator 36 i*. fed without any losses into the<br>
intermediate-circuit capacitor bank 16 of the DC voltage<br>
intermediate circuit 18 of the voltage intermediate-circuit<br>
converter 34 according to the invention.<br>
b) Braking mode I:<br>
When the intention is to consume power from the intermediate-<br>
circuit capacitor bank 16 of the DC voltage intermediate<br>
circuit 18 of the voltace intermediate-circuit converter 34,<br>
torque can be built up by means of the generator-side self-<br>
commutated pulse-control. _ed converters 38 and 40 in the<br>
generator with two three-phase winding systems 42 and 44. The<br>
generator 36 is therefore accelerated. This power can be passed<br>
on since the diesel engine can absorb it in the drag mode. This<br>
braking mode I is therefore characterized in that energy which<br>
is fed back into the inlermediate-circuit capacitor bank 16<br>
from the load-side self-commutated pulse-controlled converter<br>
14 is temporarily stored, and is dissipated by diesel-engine<br>
braking.<br>
c) Braking mode II:<br>
If no further consumption in the diesel engine is possible when<br>
the braking power becomes greater, the existing braking<br>
resistors 54 are used to destroy the energy. In order to allow<br>
energy to be converted tc heat in each of the resistors 54 a<br>
corresponding difference voltage UBr must be dropped across<br>
each braking resistor 54. In order to allow such a difference<br>
voltage UBr to be produced, the two generator-side self-<br>
commutated pulse-controlled converters 38 and 40 are controlled<br>
such that a voltage zero phase-sequence system is created.<br>
Since the voltages URi, US1. UT1, Ur2, US2 and UT2 at the inputs of<br>
the two generator-side self-commutated pulse-controlled<br>
converters 38 and 40 can oe set anywhere between zero and a<br>
maximum intermediate-circi it voltage UZw, a difference voltage<br>
UBr can also be built upon each case between an input of the<br>
generator-side self-communicated pulse-controlled converter 38<br>
and a corresponding input of the generator-side self-commutated<br>
pulse-controlled converter 40. The difference voltage UBr<br>
produced in this way results in a current flowing through each<br>
of the braking resistors 55.<br>
There are various methods for continuous control of the powers<br>
converted in the braking resistors 54.<br>
If it is assumed that eact of the phases R1, S1, T1, R2, S2 and<br>
T2 is driven by means of pulse-width modulation, in particular<br>
sine-delta modulation, then this results in a particularly<br>
simple embodiment for producing a voltage zero phase-sequence<br>
system. Shifting a triang iLar waveform voltage UD1 or UD2 of the<br>
respective generator-sice self-commutated pulse-controlled<br>
converter 38 or 40 with respect to the respective triangular<br>
waveform voltage UD2 01 UD1 of the generator-side self-<br>
commutated pulse-controlled converter 40 or 38 results in the<br>
phase voltages UR1 and UR1 , US1 and Us2, as well as UT1 and UT2<br>
being shifted with respec : to one another, thus resulting in a<br>
difference voltage UBr across the respective braking resistor<br>
54.<br>
In a diagram plotted against time t, Figure 4 in each case<br>
shows a phase voltage UR1 and UR2, a triangular waveform voltage<br>
Ud1 and UD2 respectively, and a set voltage U*. As can be seen<br>
from this diagram, the triangular waveform voltage UD2 is<br>
electrically phase-shifted through 180° with respect to the<br>
triangular waveform voltage UD1. The braking power can be<br>
adjusted continuously by continuous phase shifting between 0°<br>
and 180° electrical or one cf these triangular waveform<br>
voltages UD1 and UD2 wite respect to the other triangular<br>
waveform voltage UD2 and UD .<br>
As can also be seen from the diagram in Figure 4, the mean<br>
values of the phase voltaqes UR1 and UR2 over one pulse period<br>
are the same at any time. This means that the fundamental of<br>
the pulse-width-modulated phase voltages Ur1 and UR2 still<br>
follows the set voltage U. The generator current and its<br>
torque can therefore still be regulated, in which case excess<br>
energy can be converted to heat by means of the braking<br>
resistors 54 at the same time, by means of the generation of a<br>
voltage zero phase-sequence system.<br>
In addition to the phase shifting of a triangular waveform<br>
voltage UD1 or UD2 with respect to the other respective<br>
triangular waveform voltage UD2 or UD1, a voltage zero phase-<br>
sequence system can also be produced by shifting the duty ratio<br>
of the pulse-width-modulated phase voltages Uri, US1 and UT1 of<br>
the generator-side self-commutated pulse-<br>
controlled converter 38 with respect to the pulse-width-<br>
modulated input voltages UR2, US2 and UT2 of the generator-side<br>
self-commutated pulse-cortrolled converter 40. For this<br>
purpose, a DC voltage AU which is proportional to the braking<br>
power is added to the set voltage U* in one subsystem, while<br>
this DC voltage AU is subtracted for the other subsystem. A<br>
common feature in all cases is that a voltage zero phase-<br>
sequence system is generated which, because of the balance<br>
conditions of the free s :.ar point of the generator, does not<br>
excite any current therein in this case.<br>
Figure 5 shows an equiva]ent circuit of one simple embodiment<br>
of the first version of the diesel-electric drive system<br>
according to the inventior . This simple embodiment differs from<br>
the advantageous embodiment: shown in Figure 3 in that only two<br>
braking resistors 54 or just one braking resistor 54 are or is<br>
used instead of three braking resistors 54. It is irrelevant<br>
which input phase Rl, SI or Tl of the first generator-side<br>
self-commutated pulse-controlled converter 38 is electrically<br>
conductively connected to a corresponding input phase R2, S2 or<br>
T2 of the second generator-side self-commutated pulse-<br>
controlled converter 40. In the equivalent circuit in this<br>
Figure 5, the input phase Tl is electrically conductively<br>
connected to the corresponding :input phase T2, and the input<br>
phase S1 is electricalLy conductively connected to the<br>
corresponding input phase S2, in each case by means of a<br>
braking resistor 54. Since only two braking resistors 54 are<br>
used in this simple embodiment of the first version of the<br>
diesel-electric drive system, only 2/3 of the braking power<br>
available in the embodiment in Figure 3 can be converted to<br>
heat as well. If only one braking resistor 54 is used, then<br>
only 1/3 of the available braking power can be converted to<br>
heat, in comparison to the embodiment shown in Figure 3.<br>
If the two polyphase winding systems 42 and 44 of the generator<br>
36 each have a passed-out star point 54 and 56 (Figure 6),<br>
then,<br>
instead, one braking resistor 54 can be connected to one input<br>
phase Rl, SI or Tl, and a<br>
corresponding input phase R2, 32 or T2 can be connected to<br>
these two star points 54 and 56. This does not change the<br>
method of operation of the diesel-electric drive system<br>
according to the invention as shown in the embodiment in<br>
Figure 5.<br>
One major feature of the diesel-electric drive system according<br>
to the invention is the connection between two three-phase<br>
voltage systems by means of braking resistors 54 . In comparison<br>
to the diesel-electric drive system of this generic type shown<br>
in Figure 1, in the case of ths diesel-electric drive system<br>
according to the invention, the IGBT rectifier and the braking<br>
controller are functional_y combined. Where one of the two was<br>
in each case unused until now in the traction mode and braking<br>
mode, in the case of the clz.esel-electric drive system according<br>
to the invention, both converters can be used at the same time<br>
in the traction mode and braking mode. The functional<br>
integration of both converters in two generator-side self-<br>
commutated pulse-controlled converters 38 and 40 therefore not<br>
only halves the number of power semiconductors used, but<br>
likewise halves the costs.<br>
