	This invention relates to the lipase catalysed esterification of marine oils.<br>
	It is well known in the art to refine oil products of various kinds, including marine oils,<br>
	with the aid of lipase catalysts whose specificity under the refining conditions employed<br>
	enhances the recovery of a desired product.<br>
10<br>
	Extensive research has been carried out in order to develop lipase-catalysed processes<br>
	for isolating such commercially important PUFAs as. EPA. (eicosapentaenoic acid,<br>
	C20:5) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, C22:6) from compositions such as fish oils<br>
	containing them in relatively low concentrations.<br>
15<br>
	For example, in PCT/NO95/00050 (WO 95/24459) we disclosed a process for treating<br>
	an oil composition containing saturated and unsaturaed fatty acids in the form of<br>
	triglycerides to transesterification reaction conditions with a C1-6 alcohol such as eihanol<br>
	under substantially anhydrous conditions in the presence of a lipase active to<br>
20	preferentially catalyse the transesterification of the saturated and monounsaturated fatty<br>
	acids. With the preferred lipases, Pseudomonas sp. Lipase (PSL) and Pseudomanas<br>
	fluorescens lipase (PFL) it was possible to prepare from marine oil sources concentrates<br>
	containing more than 70% by weight of the commercially and therapeutically important<br>
	omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids EPA and DHA in the form of glycerides.<br>
25<br>
	A number of lipase-catalysed refining processes have utilised glycerol.<br>
	By way of example, jP 62-91188 (1987); WO91/16W; Int. J. Food Sci. Technol.<br>
	(1992), 27,73-76, Lie and Molin; Myrnes et al in JAOCS, Vol. 72.. No. 11 (1995),<br>
30	1339-1344; Moore et al in JAOCS, Vol. 73, No. 11 (1996), 1409-1414; McNeil: et al in<br>
	JAOCS, Vol. 73, No. 11 (1996), 1403-1407; WO96/3758 and WO96/37587 can be<br>
	mentiond.<br><br>
WO 2004/043894								PCT/NO2003/000364<br>
2<br>
	In PCT/NO00/00056 (WO 00/49117) we provided a process for esterifying a marine oil<br>
	composition containing EPA and OHA as free fatty acids to form a free fatty acid<br>
	fraction enriched in at least one of these fatty acids as compared to the starting<br>
	composition, comprising the step of reacting said marine oil composition with glycerol<br>
5	in the presence of a lipase catalyst, Rhizomucor miehei lipase (MML), under reduced<br>
	pressure and essentially organic solvent-free conditions, and recovering a free fatty acid<br>
	fraction enriched in at least one of EPA and DHA. Preferably short-path distillation was<br>
	used to separate the residual free fatty acids from the glyceride mixture.<br>
10	However, it has now become evident that mis strategy based on short-path distillation to<br>
	separate the residual free fatty acids from the glyceride mixture is not very feasible.<br>
	This is a result of too high volatility of the shorter chain monoglycerides, which<br>
	contaminate the distillate to a large extent.<br>
15	We have now discovered that lipase-catalysed processes for preparing concentrates of<br>
	EPA and DHA by the direct esterification of free fatty acids with methanol or ethanol,<br>
	or transesterification of Cn &amp; alkyl esters from fish oil (n= 2 - 18) with Cm alcohol<br>
	(alcoholysis) (m= 1-12; n&gt;m), and subsequent short-path distillation provide high<br>
	DHA concentrates. These processes are fast and simple reactions offering excellent<br>
20	separation between. EPA and DHA without generating unfavourable monoglycerides in<br>
	the distillate. The essential features of the processes are defined in the attached patent<br>
	claims.<br>
	In a preferred embodiment of the invention the C1-C12 alcohol is ethanol (ethanolysis).<br>
25	Among the C1-C12 alkyl esters, hexyl ester is preferred.<br>
	The molar ratio of methanol or ethanol to free fatty acids in the starting material in the<br>
	direct esterification is from 0.5 to 10.0, the preferred ratio is from 0.5 to 3.0, and the<br>
	most preferred ratio is from 1.0 to 2.0 or even from 1.0 to .1.5.<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2004/043894								PCT/NO003/000364<br>
3<br>
	The molar ralio of Cm alcohols to Cn alkyl esters in the transesterificatiton is from 0.5 to<br>
	10.0. the preferred ratio is from 0.5 to 3.0, and the most preferred ratio is from 2.0 to<br>
	3.0.<br>
5	The esterifications are conducted at a tempratature of 0°C to 700C, and preferably at a<br>
	temperature of 20°C to 40°C.<br>
	The lipase catalysts used in the present invention are immobilized on a carrier.<br>
10	Some Lipases used during the alcohalyses do have the properties that they catalyse the<br>
	alcoholysis of DHA at a much slower speed than the corresponding alcoholysis of BPA.<br>
	A preferred lipase having such properties is Rhizomucor mieliei (MML). Other lipases<br>
	have the property that they catalyse the alcoholysis of both EPA and DHA al a much<br>
	Slower speed than the corresponding alcoholysis of shorter chain and more saturated<br>
15	fatty acids. Lipases having such properties are Pseudomonas sp. lipase (PSL) and<br>
	Psedomonas fluorescens lipase (PFL),<br>
	Direct esterification of fish oil free fatty acids with ethanol by MML is already known<br>
	from G. G. Haraldsson and B. Kristinsson, j. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 75: 1551-1556(1998).<br>
20<br><br>
	Scheme 1. Direct esterification of fish oil free fatty acids with ethanul by MML.<br>
25	However, it was not believed that a satisfactory separation of the DHA residual free<br>
	fatty acids and ethyl esters was possible, by short-path distillation technique. Now we<br>
	have surprisingly found that Short -path distillation technique can be used highly<br>
	successfully. This is evident from the results shown in the examples below.<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2004/043894								PCT/NO2003/000364<br>
4<br>
	The present invention furthermore discloses ethanolysis of fish oil hexyl esters by a<br>
	lipase, and subsequent molecular distillation to separate residual hexyl esters and more<br>
	volatile ethyl esters.<br>
5<br><br>
	Scheme 2. Ethanolysis of fish oil hexyl esters by lipase (MML).<br>
10	To furtherimprove the recoveries of DHA and the concentration in the product an<br>
	ethanolysis reaction as described in PCT/NO95/00050 (WO 9524459) can be used as a<br>
	pre-step before the direct escerification.<br><br>
15<br>
	Scheme 3. Ethanoiysis of fish oil by lipase (MML).<br>
	Prior to the direct esterification the glyceride mixture needs to be hydrolysed. In order<br>
	to reduce the bulk of the starting material by half before hydrolysis the ethanolysis<br>
20	reaction of PCT/NO95/00050 (WO 95/24459) is found to be useful. The present<br>
	invention therefore also discloses, as an alternative process, a two-enzymatic-step<br>
	reaction starting with an ethanolysis and a subsequent direct esterification, each step<br>
	followed by concentration by molecular distillation. This two-step reaction is also<br>
	suitable for oils highly enriched with long-chain monunsaturates, such as Herring oil.<br>
25<br>
	The two-step reaction is also applicable and advantageous when fish oil hexyl esters are<br>
	the starting material.<br>
	The invention is illustrated by the Examples which follow.<br><br>
WO 2004/043894								PCT/NO2003/000364<br>

	Starting materials like Sardine oil (SO), Anchovy oil (AO), Herring oil (HO). Cod liver<br>
	oil (CLO), Tuna oil (TO) and Blue whiting oil (BWO) have been tested.<br>
5	Experimental procedures<br>
	Ths bacterial Lipases from Pseudomanas sp. (PSL; Lipase AK) and Pseudomonas<br>
	fluorescens (PFL; Lipsse PS) were purchased from Amano Bnzyrne inc, The<br>
	immobolized Rhizomucor miehei (MML; Lypozyme RM IM), Tharmomyces lamiginosa<br>
	(TLL; Lipozyme TM IM) and Candida antarctica (CAL; Novozym 435) lipases where<br>
10	provided by Novozyme in Denmark. The Sardine oil (14% EPA and 15% DHA),<br>
	Anchovy oil (18% EPA and 12% DHA), Herring oil (6% EPA and 8% DHA), Tuna oil<br>
	(6% EPA and 23% DHA), Cod liver oil (9% EPA and 5% t)HA) and Bine whiting oil<br>
	(11 % EPA and 7% DHA) were all provided by Pronova Biocare.<br>
	Fatty acid analysis was performed employing a Perkin-elmer 8140 Gas Chromatograph<br>
15	(GC) equipped with a flame ionisation detector (FID). Capillary column was 30 meter<br>
	DB-225 30N, 0.25 m capillary column from j &amp;W Scientific. The short-path<br>
	distillation was carried out in a Leyboid KDL 4 still Nuclear magnetic resonance<br>
	(NMR) spactra were recorded on a Broker AC 250 NMR spectrometer in deuteraied<br>
	chloroform as solvent Preparative thin-layer chmrnatogcaphy (PLC) was conducted on<br>
20	silica gel plates from Merck (Art 5721). Elution was performed with 80:20:1 mixture of<br>
	petroleum ether, dieethyl ether: acetic acid- Rhodamin G (Merck) was used to visualise<br>
	the bands which subsequently were scraped off and methylated. Methyl ester of C19:0<br>
	(Sigma) were added to the samples as internal standerds before injection to GC.<br>
25	Hydrolysis of fish oil<br>
	Fish oil (500 g, 0.55 mol) was added to a solution of sodium hydroxide (190 g, 4.75<br>
	mol), water (500 ml) and 96% ethanol (1.7 L). The resulting mixture was allowed to<br>
	reflux for 30 minutes (until clear coloured Liquid is observed) and then cooled to room<br>
	temperature, stirring constantly. To neutralise the solution, 6.0 Hhydrochloric acid<br>
30	(870 ml, 10% excess) was carefully added and the resulting mixture transferred to a<br>
	separatory funnel. The See fatty acids were extracted twice with a 1:1 mixture of<br>
	petroleum ether and diethyl ether (1.5 L). The organic layer was then washed three<br><br>
WO 2004/043894								PCT/NO2003/000364<br>
6<br>
	times with water(1.5 L) and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate. The drying<br>
	agent was filtered off and the solvents removed by evaporation, finishing with high<br>
	vacuum vaporisation for 2 hours at 50°C. Analysis on analytical TLC, a single spot<br>
	indicated pure free fatty acids. The colour of the product varied from a yellowish So dark<br>
5	burgundy colour, depending on the fish oil.<br>
	Direct esterification of fish oil free fatty acids with ethanol<br>
	Immobilized MML(15 g) was added to a solution of fish oil free fatty acids (300 g,<br>
	approx. 1.03 mol) and absolute ethanol (143 g, 3.10 mol). The resulting enzyme<br>
10	suspension was gently stirred under nitrogen at 400C until desired conversion was<br>
	reached. Samples were taken during the reaction and residual amount of free fatty acids<br>
	detected by titration with 0,02M NaOH in order to monitor the progress of the reaction.<br>
	Fractionation on was performed by preparative TLC and each lipid fraction was<br>
	subsequently quantified and analysed. on fatty acid profile by GC. After reaching<br>
15	desired conversion the enzyme was removed by filtration and the excess ethanoi<br>
	evaporated in vacua. The high DHA concentrate was obtained as residue after short-<br>
	path distilation of the resulting mixture.<br>
	Ethanolysis of fish oil by lipase<br>
20	Immobilized MML (20 g) was added to a solution of fish oil (400 g, 0.44 mol) and<br>
	absolute ethanol (61 g, 1.32 mol). The resulting enzyme suspension was gently stirred<br>
	under nitrogen at room temperature until desired conversion was reached. Then the<br>
	enzyme was removed by filtration and the excess ethanol evaporated in vacuo prior to<br>
	short-path distillation. The progress of the reaction was monitoned by analytical TLC<br>
25	and 1H-NMR. Fractionation was performed by preparative TLC and each lipid fraction<br>
	was subsequently quantified and analysed on fatty acid profile by GC.<br>
	Hxanolysis of fish oil by lipase<br>
	Immobilized CAL (25 g) was added to a solution of fish oil (500 g, 0.55 mol) and i-<br>
30	hexanol (338 g, 3.31 mol). The resulting enzyme suspension was gently stirred under<br>
	nitrogen 650C until the triacylglycerols had been completely converted to hexyl<br><br>
WO 2004/043894								PCT/NO2003/000364<br>
7<br>
	esters, according to analytical TLC and/or 1H-NMR. The enzyme was removed by<br>
	filtration and the excess hexanol evaporated in vacua.<br>
	Ethanoysis of fish oil hexyl esters by lipase<br>
5	Immobilized MML (15 g) was added to a solution of fish oil hexyl esters (300 g, 0.80<br>
	mol) and absolute ethanol (111 g,2.41 mol). The resulting enzyme suspension was<br>
	gently stirred under nitrogen at( 40°C until desired conversion was obtained, according<br>
	to 1H-NMEL The enzyme was removed by filtration and the excess ethanol evaporated<br>
	in vacua. The high DHA concentrate was obtained as residue after short-path distillation<br>
10	of the resulting mixture. The fatty acid composition of each ester group was determined<br>
	by single run on GC.<br>
	Example 1.<br>
15	Direct Esterification. of Fish Oil Free Fatty Asids with Ethanol <br>
	Sardine oil(SO) <br>
	The progress of direct esterification reaction of SO free fatty acids, containing 14%<br>
	EPA and 15% DHA (14/15), with 3 equivalents of ethanol in the presence of MML (5%<br>
20	as based on the weight of free fatty acids) at 400C is displayed in Table 1. Under these<br>
	conditions the lipase displayed extremely high activity toward the SO free fatty acids.<br>
	over70% conversion(% efthyl esters) was reached after only 2 hours. After 4 hour<br>
	reaction the residual free fatty acids contained 49% DHA and 6% EPA in 73% and 10%<br>
	recoveries, respectivly. In terms of DHA concentration and recoveries the optimal<br>
25	conversion appears to be around 75% conversion. In Table 1 the weight percentage of<br>
	ethyl esters produced during the progress of the reaction was used directly as a measure<br>
	of the extent of conversion.<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2004/043894								PCT/NO2003/000364<br>
8<br><br>
	Excellent results were obtained for direct esterification of SO free fatty acids after<br>
5	separation by short-path distillation. SO free fatty acids were reacted with ethanol in the<br>
	presence of MML for 4 hours at 40°C to reach 78% conversion. The free fatty acids of<br>
	ihe reaction mixture comprised 49% DHA and 6% EPA with 75% DHA recoveries.<br>
	After distillation at 115°C the residue comprised 69% DHA and 9% EPA in 65% and<br>
	10% recoveries, respectively (Table 2). The recoveries of DHA were improved by<br>
10	slightly reducing the distillation temperature (see Table 3). We were notable to separate<br>
	all the ethyl esters from the residual free fatty acids by the distillation. Despite that, we<br>
	managed to obtain high DHA concentrate of approximately 90% free fatty acids and<br>
	10% ethyl esters after short-path distillation at 115°C. The ethyl esters obtained in the<br>
	residue are highly enriched with DHA like the free fatty acids. Furthermore, the more<br>
15	saturated and shorter-chain free fatty acids are distilled resulting in higher DHA<br>
	concentration of the residue than for the free fatty acid fraction after the reaction.<br><br>
20<br><br>
WO2004/043894								PCT/NO2003/000364<br>
9<br>
	The results for SO were improved by lowering the conversion and the distillation<br>
	temperature as displayed in Table 3. After 4 hour reaction 75% conversion was<br>
	obtained. After distillation at 111°C the residue contained 66% DHA in 88% recoveries<br>
	with DHA/EPA ratio of 4.7. At slightly higher distillation temperature the residue<br>
5	comprised 74% DHA in 75% recovery with a DHA/EPA ratio nearly seven. It should be<br>
	notified that the DHA recovery after the distillations is based on percent weight of DHA<br><br>
	The ethanol content can be reduced to I equivalent resulting in increased reaction time<br>
	(Table 4), Less lipaae tari also be introduced resulting in cosisiderably lower reaction<br>
	rate.<br>

	Ancholvy Oil(AO)<br>
	The progress of the direct esterification reaction of AO &amp; free fatty acids comprising 18%<br>
	EPA and ) 12% DHA (18/12) under identical conditions to the SO is displayed in Table<br>
	5. As can be noticed a DHA/EPA ratio of approximately 6:1 was obtained at 82%<br>
5	conversion after 24 hours with EPA comprising 8% and DHA 50%. The DHA recovery<br>
	was just below 80%. Also after 11 hours, at 79% conversion a DHA/EPA ratio of 5:1<br>
	wilh DHA recoveries as high as 84%. Therefore, AO and SO are both highly potential<br>
	starting materials for making concentrates high in DHA and also, to make concentrates .<br>
	high in EPA from the ethyl ester fraction if that is of interest.<br>
10<br><br>
	The results for AO are good in terms of DHA concentration and DHA/EPA ratios as<br>
15	displayed in Table 6. Free fatty acids of AO (19/12) were reacted as before to reach<br>
	76% conversion in 11 hours. After distillation at 12l°C the residua comprised 61%<br>
	DHA in only 64% recovery with the DHA/EPA ratio being 5.5. The distillate may<br>
	possibly be used to make high EPA concentrates by a repeated distillation at lower<br>
	temperature. As an example a concentrate of 45% EPA and 10% DHA is considered to<br>
20	be a desirable composition for a potential commercial product.<br>

	Herrings Oil(HO)<br>
5	Free fatty acids from herring oil comprising 6% EPA and 8% DHA (6/8) were similarly<br>
	treated under the direct esterification conditions as described above. The progress of the<br>
	reaction is displayed in Table 7. The residual free fatty acids after 12 hour reaction<br>
	contained 37% DHA and 6% EPA with 90% and 13% recoveries, respectively.<br><br>
	Free fatty acids from different HO comprising 9% BPA and 9% DHA (9/9) were reacted<br>
	for 12 hours, to reach 84% conversion, in same way as before, The free fatty acids of<br>
15	the reaction mixture comprised 39% DHA and 8% EPA with 76% DHA recovery. After<br>
	distillation at 110°C the residue contained 40% DHA and 7% EPA in 68% DHA<br>
	recovery with a DRA/EPA ratio of almost 6:1 (Table 8). Low DHA concentration<br>
	results from high contents of long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids of 20% (4%)and<br>
	22:1 (37%). This high content of long-chain monounsaturates in HO and Capelin oil<br>
20	renders them less feasible starting material for the process described. A simple urea<br>
	inclusion of the residual oil may be used to remove most of these monounsaturated fatty<br>
	acids resulting in a valuable concentrate of DHA. It should be added that HO with its<br>
	low EPA content is more suitable for obtaining high DHA/EPA natios than SO and AO.<br><br>

5	The progress of the direct esterification reaction of TO free fatty acids comprising 6%<br>
	EPA and 23% DHA (6/23) under conditions identical to SO described above is<br>
	displayed in Table 9 below. After 8 hour reaction conversion of 68% was obtained with<br>
	the residual free fatty acids comprising 74% DHA and 3% EPA with 83% DHA<br>
	recovery and a DHA/EPA ratio of 25:1 (Table 9). Clearly, this type of initial EPA/DHA<br>
10	composition of the starting oil is ideal for concentrating DHA.<br><br>
15	Cod Liver Oil (CLO)<br>
	The progress of the direct esterification reaction of CLO free fatty acids comprising 9%<br>
	EPA and 9% DHA (9/9) under similar conditions as described above is displayed in<br>
	Table 10. Around 79% conversion a DHA/EPA ratio of 5:1 was obtained for the<br>
	residual free fatty acids with 50% DHA concentration and over 80% recovery. These<br>
20	results are even better than those for SO and AO considering potential DHA recoveries.<br>
	But in terms of cost, SO and AO are favoured over CLO. It may be of interest to<br><br>
WO 2004/043894								PCT/NO2003/000364<br>
13<br>
	compare the results of CLO (9/9) to those of HO (9/9) in light of the feet that CLQ<br>
	contains far less long-chain monounsaturates (20:1 and 22:1).<br><br>
	BlueWhiting Oil(BWO)<br>
	The progress of the direct esterification reaction of BWO free fatty acids comprising<br>
	11% EPA and 7% DHA (11/7) under the conditions described above is displayed in<br>
10	Table 11. Around 73% conversion the residual free fatty acids comprised 24% DHA. in<br>
	95% recoveries. EPA was not transferred to ethyl esters as rapidly as expected.<br>
	Interestingly, and unlike HO, the long-chain monounsaturated free fatty acids were to a<br>
	much higher extent convetted to ethyl ester. Higher conversion is needed to obtain<br>
	better separation of BPA and DHA, The reason for the low conversion for BWO is<br>
15	unclear, but several attempts have not resulted in a higher conversion.<br><br>

	Example 2<br>
	Combined Ethanolysis and Direct Esterificafion of Fish Oil<br>
	A two-step reaction, starting with an ethanolysis ami a subsequent direct esterification,<br>
5	each step followed by molecular distillation, could be used to improve the recoveries of<br>
	DHA and the concentration. in the product. Prior to the direct esterifcation the glyceride<br>
	mixture obtained from the ethanolysis needs to be hydrolysed. Therefore, the<br>
	ethanolysis reaction can be used as a pre-step, reducing the bulk of the starting material<br>
	by half before hydrolysis. Notice the high recoveries obtained in the ethanolysis at 40°C<br>
10	after separation by distillation (Table 12). Better results were obtained at room<br>
	temperature as discussed, above and displayed in Tables 13 and 14. The residue from 	the<br>
	room temperature reaction comprised 23% DHA and 25% EPA in 97% and 65%<br>
	recoveries, respectively (Table 13). These results indicate that the DHA recoveries can<br>
	be improved significantly by the two-step process. Also, there is a dramatic reduction in<br>
15	bulkiness for the hydrolysis reaction, finally, this approach may be suitable for oils<br>
	highly enriched wife long-chain monounsaturates, such as HO.<br><br><br>

	Example 3<br>
5	Ethanolysis of Fish Oil Hexyl Esters<br>
	Ethanolysis of hexyl esters (HE) from fish oil is an alternative to the previously<br>
	discribed ethanolysis of fish oil trigtyceridss {Scheme 2). The results indicate that<br>
	various pases including the Rhizamucor miehei lipase (MML) and the Pseudomonas<br>
10	lipases (PCL and PH.) can be used as well as the recently commercialised Thermomyces<br>
	latuginosa lipase (TLL) from. Novozyme. Also, it has bsen coonfirmed that molecular<br>
	distilation is quite suitable to separate residual hexyl ester and the more volatile ethyl<br>
	ester<br>
15	Candida antarctica lipase (CAL) was used to convert A.O triglycerides into the<br>
	corresponding hexyl esters in a treatment with hexanol. Treatment of the resulting hexyl<br>
	ester with ethanol and PSL folloed by molecular distilation of the reaction mixture<br>
	may afford residual hexyl ester -with approximately 80% of EPA and DHA in a single<br>
	or in two enzymatic steps. By cocentreting DHA in the hexyl ester not only can we<br>
20	separate the ethyl estets from the hexyl esters but also distil off the more saturated hexyl<br>
	esters as well.It may be possible lo convert the hexyl esters into ethyl esters either<br>
	chemically or enzymatically using CAL, Alternatively, it is possible to treat the<br>
	anchovy oil hexyl esters in ethanolysis using MML that may afford 70% DHA in a<br>
	single enzymatic step as hexyl esters. They may be further concentrated by an additional<br>
35	MML treatment. From the bulk of the ethyl esters containing most of the EPA it may be<br>
	possible to purify EPA up to the 95% levels.<br>
	An alternative two-step approach is based on the ethanolysis of sardine oil to produce a<br>
	canceotrate of 50% EPA + DHA (30/20) as a glyceride mixture after molecular<br>
30	distillation Treatment of the residual glycerides with hexanol and CAL affords hexyl<br>
	esters of identical composition. They may either be treated with ethanol and PSL to<br>
	afford hexyl esters with approximately 80% of EPA and DHA, or ethanol and MML to<br>
	separate DHA from EPA, followed by further concentration of both EPA and DHA.<br><br>
WO2004/043894							PCT/NO2003/0003640 <br>
16<br>
	This process may have advantage in that the bulk of fish oil is being treated with<br>
	ethanol instead of hexanol, which is both easier, less bulky and more feasible from<br>
	industrial point of view. It must also be frome in mind that very high to excellent<br>
	recovery of both EPA. and DHA can be expected by that method.<br>
5<br>
	Anchovy Oil(AO)<br>
	Like for the ethanolysis of fish oil triglycerides the fatty acid selectivity and activity of<br>
	MML can be greatly affected by temperature. Thus, MML can be used to concentrate<br>
	both EPA and DHA at or below 200C, but at 400C EPA is separated from DHA<br>
10	resulting in high DHA concentrates. Anchovy oil hexyl esters comprising 18% EPA and<br>
	12% DHA were reacted with 2 equivalents of ethanol in the presence of MML (10%<br>
	weight of the hexyl esters) for 24 hows at 400C to reach 59% conversion. After removal<br>
	of the lipase excess ethanol was evaporated and the ethyl ester/hexyl ester (EE/HE)<br>
	mixture distilled at 135°C at 3 *10-3 mbar. The residue (26% weight) comprised 43%<br>
15	DHA in only 65% recovery. The DHA/EPA ratio-was only 2.2(Table 15).<br><br>
	aIn Tables 15 and 16 the conversion of the lipase catalysed reactions is based on mol<br>
20	percentage, whereas the distillation results are based on weight.<br>
	Interesting results were obtained when the reaction temperature was lowered to 20°C in<br>
	a similar reaction of Anchovy oil hexyl esters (18/13). After distillation at 1150C tee<br>
	residue comprised 45% DHA and 30% EPA with 85% and 55% recoveries, respectively<br>
25	(Table 16).<br>

WO 2004/043894								PCT/NO2003/000364<br>
17<br><br>
	The Pseudomonas lipases were Tested on a small scale with good results, giving high<br>
5	EPA recovery but considerably lower DHA recovery, especially if the reaction<br>
	exceeded 50% conversion, The results of the ethanolysis reaction of AO (18/12) with 2<br>
	equivalents of ethanol in the presence of PSL and PFL at room temperature is displayed<br>
	in Table 16. For PFL, after only 44% conversion of sardine oil hexyl esters in 24 hours,<br>
	the content of 28% EPA and 21% DHA was obtained while 57% conversion for PSL in<br>
10	24 hours yielded in 33% EPA. and 17% DHA<br><br>
15	 Tbe new Novozyme lipase (TLL), immobilized on granular silica gel, was compared to<br>
	MML. The new lipase was found to be sensitive to ethanol and the activity decreased<br>
	rapidly with increased temperature, At 20°C both lipases were active and in 24 hours<br>
	54% conversion was obtained for MML but only 43% for TLL. The residual hexyl<br>
	esters of TO, comprising 6% EPA and 28% DHA (6/28), from the TLL reaction<br>
30	contained 8% EPA and 45% DHA. The MML reaction resulted in residual hexyl esters<br>
	containing 7% EPA and 54% DHA (Table 18). These lipases are obviously similar in<br>
	fatty acid selectivity but TLL is more sensitive toward ethanol concentration, which<br>
	makes it inferior to MML.<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2004/043894								PCT/NO2003/000364<br>
18<br><br>
5	The results from the ethanolysis of TO hexyl esters (6/28) and ethanol al 40°C are<br>
	displayed in Table 19, Interestingly, at 400Conly 15% conversion was obtained for<br>
	TLL and 47% conversion for MML. It is believed that at higher temperature the lipase<br>
	becomes more sensitive for the polar ethanol and its detrimental effects. For MML, after<br>
	47% conversion in 24 hours, the hexyl esters comprised 9% EPA and 49% DHA while<br>
10	only 15% conversion for TLL in 24 hours yielded 33% EPA and 17% DHA.<br><br>
15	By the present inventon separation of EPA. and DHA. by solvent free direct<br>
	esterification of fish oil free fatty acids or fish oil hexyl esters and ethanol in the<br>
	presence of a lipase is successfully obtained. The problems with monoglycerides in the<br>
	distillate are avoided by the processes according to die present invention.<br><br>
