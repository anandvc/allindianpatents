"VEHICLE WHEEL SPEED SENSOR PROTECTION STRUCTURE"<br><br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan<br><br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
The   present   invention   relates   to   vehicle   wheel   speed   sensor   protection structure.<br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention] [0001] [Technical Field to which Invention Belongs]<br>
The present invention relates to a vehicle speed sensor protection structure for protecting a vehicle wheel speed sensor for detecting the vehicle speed. [0002] [Description of the Related Art]<br>
As an apparatus for detecting the wheel speed of motorcycles, "WHEEL SPEED DETECTING APPARATUS FOR MOTORCYCLES" disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 8-133154 is known. This technology provides a vehicle wheel speed sensor on the swing arm for supporting the rear wheel<br>
via a supporting- stay and-a-sensor_ ring- integrally_with the	<br>
rear wheel for detecting the rotational speed of the sensor ring by counting the number of teeth of the sensor ring by a<br>
2<br><br>
wheel speed sensor while the motorcycle is traveling.<br>
The speed of the motorcycles may be detected by detecting the rotational speed of the sensor ring.<br>
[0003] [Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
The wheel speed sensor is constructed to be mounted to the swing arm via a supporting stay, and the wheel speed sensor is exposed to the outside. Therefore, considering the mounting position of the wheel speed sensor, it is mounted to the portion that does not get soiled easily from mud, dust, and the like. Consequently, the wheel speed sensor may be protected from mud, dust, and the like.<br>
[0004]<br>
As described above, the wheel speed sensor may be protected from mud or dust just by taking the mounting position of the wheel speed sensor into account. However, it is more preferable for the wheel speed sensor to enhance the protection from mud or dust.<br>
In addition, it is preferable to do with a member of simple structure as means for protecting the wheel speed sensor from mud or dust.<br>
[0005]<br>
Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide a vehicle wheel speed sensor protection structure that can protect the wheel speed sensor from mud or dust in a simple<br><br><br>
structure.<br>
[0006]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order " to achieve the object described above, the invention is characterized in that, in a vehicle having a structure for measuring the number of revolution of the driving wheel by mounting the driving wheel on the drive shaft extending from generally cylindrical gear case and sensing the movement of the gear integrated in the gear case with the wheel speed sensor mounted through the cylindrical portion of the gear case, wherein the portion of the wheel speed sensor projecting from the gear case is protected by a protector plate comprising a protector body for covering the side surface of the wheel speed sensor on the side of the driving wheel and a bent portion formed by bending the protector body for covering the projected end surface of the wheel speed sensor.<br>
[0007]<br>
The construction is such that the protector body of the protector plate covers the side surface of the wheel speed sensor on the side of the driving wheel and the bent portion formed by bending the protector body covers the projecting end surface of the wheel speed sensor.<br>
Therefore, the plate-shaped protector plate can protect the projected end surface of the wheel speed sensor from mud<br><br><br>
or dust.<br>
[0008]<br>
The invention is characterized in that the protector body being a laterally elongated shape along the direction of rotation of the driving wheel comprises a leg portion at the distal end thereof, and is mounted in such a manner that the leg portion abuts against the gear case to prevent deformation or deflection of the protector body.<br>
[0009]<br>
The protector body is provided with a leg portion at the distal end thereof, and is mounted in such a manner that the leg portion abuts against the gear case. Therefore, the distal end of the protector body may be reinforced by the leg portion. Therefore, deformation or deflection of the protector body may be prevented by a simple structure obtained simply by providing a leg portion, and concurrently, the displacement of the protector plate may be prevented as well.<br>
[0010] The  invention  is  characterized  in  that  a  harness connected to the wheel  speed  sensor  is  laid  along  the laterally elongated shape of the protector body.<br>
The portion of the harness in the vicinity of the connecting portion may be covered by the protector body by laying the harness connected to the wheel speed sensor along the laterally elongated shape of the protector body.<br><br><br>
[0011] The invention is characterized in that a breather hose extending from the air cleaner is disposed on side of the  projecting  end  surface  of  the  wheel  speed  sensor opposite from the protector plate, and the breather hose is laid along the wheel speed sensor. [0012] The  breather  hose  is  laid  along  the  side  of  the projecting end surface of the wheel speed sensor opposite from  the  protector  plate.  Therefore,  the  opposite  side surface of the projecting end surface can be covered by the breather hose. [0013]<br>
[Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>

Fig. 4 is a cross sectional view taken along the line 4-4 of Fig. 3. [Fig. 5]<br>
Fig. 5 is a perspective view of the vehicle wheel speed sensor  protection  structure  according  to  the  present invention. [Fig. 6]<br>
Fig. 6 is an explanatory drawing of the operation of the vehicle wheel speed sensor protection structure according to the present invention.<br><br><br>
11, a front wheel 13 mounted to the front fork 12, a handle 14 connected to the front fork 12, a power unit 15 mounted to the rear portion of the vehicle body frame 11 so as to be capable of swinging vertically, a rear wheel {driving wheel) 16 mounted to the power unit 15, a rear cushion unit 17 suspending the rear end portion of the power unit 15, an air cleaner 18 mounted to the power unit 15, a storing box 19a mounted on the upper portion of the rear portion of the vehicle body frame 11, a seat 19b disposed on the storing box 19a and mounted so as to be capable of being opened and closed.<br>
[0015]<br>
The power unit 15 comprises a water-cooled engine 21 in the front and a power transmitting mechanism 22 in the rear. The engine 21 is disposed generally horizontally with the cylinder head faced toward the front.<br>
[0016]<br>
In addition, the motorcycle 10 is constructed by covering the vehicle body frame 11 with a body cover 30. The body cover 30 comprises a front cover 31 for covering the front portion of the head pipe 11a, a leg shield 32 for covering forwardly of the legs of the driver, a step floor (low-floor foot deck) 33 for placing the legs of the driver, floor side covers 34 provided on the left and the right of the step floor 33 extending downward from the outer edge, an undercover 35 covering between the lower edges of the floor side covers 34, a front under-seat<br><br><br>
cover 36 for covering around the front half portion of the storing box 19a, a rear under-seat cover 37 for covering around the rear half portion of the storing box 19a and the rear portion of the vehicle body, and left and right side covers 38 extending downward from the front and rear under-seat covers 36, 37.<br>
[0017]<br>
Such motorcycle 10 comprises a wtieel speed sensor 40 and a wheel speed sensor protection structure (hereinafter referred to simply as "sensor protection structure" ) 50 mounted at a rear end 24a of a case (gear case) 23 of the power transmitting mechanism 22.<br>
The wheel speed sensor 40 and the sensor protection structure 50 will be described in detail referring to the next drawing.<br>
[0018]<br>
In the figure, the reference numeral and sign 39a denotes a hand grip, 39b denotes a head lamp, 39c denotes a front fender, 39d denotes a fuel tank, 39e denotes a fuel pomp, 39f denotes a radiator for cooling engine, 39g denotes a exhaust muffler, 3 9h denotes a buttery, and He denotes a helmet.<br>
[0019]<br>
Fig. 2 is a partially enlarged view of the portion 2 in Fig. 1, showing a state in which a belt 25, a pulley 26, a drum brake 27 and a gear 28 (only one gear is shown in the figure) are integrated in the gear case 23 of the power transmitting<br><br><br>
mechanism 22, and the wheel speed sensor 40 is mounted to the rear end 24a of the gear case 23 from the outside, and the wheel speed sensor 40 is covered by the sensor protection structure 50.<br>
[0020]<br>
Consequently, the belt 25 driven by the engine 21 (shown in Fig. 1) rotates a pulley 26, then rotation of the pulley 26 is transmitted via the power transmitting system (not shown) to the gear 28 and rotates a rear axle 29 mounted coaxially with the gear 28, thereby the rear wheel 16 in driven.<br>
[0021]<br>
The wheel speed sensor 40 is mounted to the rear end 24a of the gear case 23 with a first bolt 45a (only one bolt is shown in the figure) in a state in which a projecting portion<br>
41	is projected from the gear case 23, and a detecting section<br>
42	is inserted into and passed through the gear case 23 so that a tip 42a of the detecting section 42 faces toward a teeth 28a, . . . of the gear 28 ( ... means that there are more than one of those) .<br>
Accordingly, the vehicle speed of the motorcycle 10 can be detected by sensing the number of teeth of the gear 28 at the detecting section 42.<br>
[0022]<br>
The sensor protection structure 50 comprises a protector plate 51 provided in the clearance between the wheel speed sensor 40 and the rear wheel 16, and a breather hose 60 on the<br><br><br>
opposite side from the rear wheel 16 (left side of the wheel speed sensor 40).<br>
A left side surface 44 of the projecting portion 41 of the wheel speed sensor 40 (that is, the side surface 44 opposite from the rear wheel 16) may be protected by the breather hose 60 by connecting a proximal end 60a thereof to the lower portion of the rear end 18a of the air cleaner 18, and fastening the portion in the vicinity of a distal end 60b to the rear end 24a of the gear case 23 via the clamp 61 with a bolt 62.<br>
[0023]<br>
The breather hose 60 is constructed in such a manner that oil discharged from the air cleaner 18 may be trapped in the breather hole 60 by inserting a plug 63 at the distal end 60b and fastening the inserted plug 63 with a clip 64.<br>
Oil may be removed from the breather hose 60 by releasing fastening of the clip 64 and removing the plug 63 from the distal end 60b of the breather hose 60.<br>
[0024]<br>
As is described thus far, utilizing the breather hose 60 originally for trapping oil as a sensor protection structure 50 simultaneously helps to simplify the sensor protection structure 50.<br>
[0025]<br>
Oil described above is oil component contained in a blow-by gas flown from the cylinder of the engine 21 into a<br><br><br>
crankcase shown in Fig. 1, which is flown to the lower portion in the air cleaner 18, then passed through the lower portion 18a of the rear end of the air cleaner 18, and then trapped in the breather hose 60.<br>
[0026]<br>
Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the vehicle wheel speed sensor protection structure according to the present invention, in a state in which a part of the breather hose 60 is shown by a phantom line.<br>
According to the sensor protection structure 50, a side surface 43 of the projecting portion 41 of the wheel speed sensor 40 on the side of the rear wheel 16 {shown in Fig. 5) may be protected by the protector plate 51, and the side surface 44 thereof on the opposite side from the rear wheel 16 may be protected by the breather hose 60.<br>
[0027]<br>
The protector plate 51 of the sensor protection structure 50 comprises a protector body 52 for covering the side surface 43 of the wheel speed sensor 40 on the side of the rear wheel 16 by being provided in the clearance 4 8 between the wheel speed sensor 4 0 and the rear wheel 16, and a bent portion 53 formed by bending the protector body 52 for covering a part of a upper side (projecting end surface) 41a of the projecting portion 41 of the wheel speed sensor 40.<br>
Therefore, the projecting end surface 41a of the wheel<br><br><br>
speed sensor 4 0 may be protected from mud or dust by the protector plate 51, or a simple structure obtained by simply bending the plate member.<br>
[0028]<br>
In this case, the portion of a harness 46 in the vicinity of a connecting portion 46a may be protected by the protector body 52 by laying the harness 46 for the sensor connected to the wheel speed sensor 40 along the protector body 52.<br>
Therefore, the portion of the harness 46 in the vicinity of the connecting portion 46a may be protected from mud or dust by a simple structure.<br>
The reference numeral 67 denotes a break lever, 68 denotes a brake cable.<br>
[0029]<br>
Fig. 4 is a cross sectional view taken along the line 4-4 in Fig. 3, showing a state in which the detecting section 42 of the wheel speed sensor 40 is inserted into and passed through the cylindrical portion 24 of the gear case 23 and faced toward the teeth 28a. . . of the gear 28, and the portion of the harness 46 in the vicinity of the connecting portion 46a is placed along a distal end (upper end) 52a of the protector body 52.<br>
[0030]<br>
The protector body 52 being a member formed into laterally elongated shape is provided with a leg portion 54<br><br><br>
at the distal end (upper end) 52a thereof, and mounted in such a manner that the leg portion 54 abuts against a surface 23a of the gear case 23. Therefore, deformation or deflection of the upper end 52a (or the overhanging portion) of the protector body 52 may be prevented by the leg portion 54.<br>
[0031]<br>
As is described thus far, since deformation and deflection of the protector body 52 (specifically upper end 52a) is prevented by making the leg portion 54 abut against the gear case 23, it is not necessary to fix the leg portion 54 to the gear case 23 with a bolt, thereby simplifying the construction of the protector plate 51.<br>
Mounting the protector body 52 with the leg portion 54 being abutted against the surface 23a of the gear case 23 may prevent the protector plate 51 from being displaced. Therefore, the projecting end surface of the wheel speed sensor can be protected from mud or dust in a simpler structure.<br>
[0032]<br>
Fig. 5 is a perspective view of the vehicle wheel speed sensor protection structure according to the present invention.<br>
The protector plate 51 is formed by placing it the wheel speed sensor 40 with a lower end 52b of the protector body 52 projected from a lower end 40a of the wheel speed detector 40, providing a lower bent portion 55 bent toward the vehicle speed<br><br><br>
sensor 40 at the lower portion of the lower end 52b, forming a bolt hole 55a on the lower bent portion 55 , providing a central bent portion 56 bent toward the side opposite from the wheel speed sensor 40 generally at a central lower portion 52c of the protector body 52, forming a bolt hole 56a at the central bent portion 56, providing a bent portion 53 bent toward the vehicle speed sensor 40 generally at a central upper portion 52d of the protector body 52, bending the upper end 52a of the protector body 52 toward the wheel speed sensor 4 0 into generally angular C-shape, providing the leg portion 54 at the lower portion of the upper end 52a extending toward the gear case 23, and providing a bent strip 54a at the distal end 42a of the leg portion 54.<br>
[0033]<br>
The protector plate 51 is mounted by placing the wheel speed sensor 40 on the gear case 23, placing the protector plate 51 at the position shown by a phantom line, inserting the first bolt 45a into the bolt hole 55a and into the mounting hole (not shown) of the wheel speed sensor 40, and inserting a second bolt 45b into the bolt hole 56a.<br>
[0034]<br>
Then, the first and the second bolts 45a, 45b are screwed into the screw hole (not shown) of the gear case 23. The wheel speed sensor 40 can be secured on the gear case 23 by tightening the first bolt 45a.<br><br><br>
Therefore, the wheel speed sensor 40 and the protector plate 51 are fastened simultaneously by the first bolt 45a, the step of fastening the wheel speed sensor 40 with a bolt may be eliminated.<br>
[0035]<br>
As is described thus far, the bent strip 54a of the leg portion 54 may be abutted against the gear case 23 by mounting the protector plate 51 onto the gear case 23 with the first and the second bolts 62.<br>
In addition, the side surface 43 of the wheel speed sensor 40 on the side of the rear wheel 16 and the portion of the harness 46 in the vicinity of the connecting portion 46a may be covered by the protector body 52, and the a part of the upper side 41a of the projecting portion 41 of the wheel speed sensor 40 may be covered by the bent portion 53.<br>
[0036]<br>
The reason why only a part of the upper side 41a of the projecting portion 41 is covered by the bent portion 53 will now be described. Originally, when considering the protection of the wheel speed sensor 40, it is preferable to cover the upper side of the projecting portion 41 entirely with the bent portion 53.<br>
However, assuming that the upper side of the projecting portion 41 is covered entirely, if mud or dust were to enter into the clearance between the bent portion 53 and the<br><br><br>
projecting portion 41, it is difficult to remove entered mud or dust. Therefore, only the important portion of the projecting portion 41 (that is, a portion of the upper side 41a) is covered by the bent portion 53 to facilitate removal of entered mud or dust.<br>
[0037]<br>
An example of the operation of the sensor protection structure will now be described.<br>
Figs. 6 (a) and (b) are explanatory drawings showing the operation of the vehicle wheel speed sensor protection structure according to the present invention.<br>
In Fig. 6(a), a U-shaped antitheft lock 75 is mounted through a hole 71 formed on a fork 7 0 of the rear wheel 16. Consequently, the rotation of the rear wheel 16 is prevented, and thus the motorcycle is protected against theft.<br>
Assuming that the third person tried to move the motorcycle 10 forward with the antitheft lock 75 mounted, the rear wheel 16 rotates as shown by the arrow and the antitheft lock 75 rises with the fork 70.<br>
[0038]<br>
In Fig. 6(b), since the lower end 52b of the protector body 52 of the sensor protection structure 50 is projecting downward from the lower end 40a of the wheel speed sensor 40 by the projecting amount L, the antitheft lock 75 abuts against the lower end 52b of the protector body 52 or the bent portion<br><br><br>
53. Therefore, the antitheft lock 75 is prevented from hitting the wheel speed sensor 40, and thus the wheel speed sensor 40 can be protected.<br>
Since the lower end 52b of the protector body 52 is secured to the gear case 23 with the first bolt 45a, the protector plate 51 is prevented form being displaced even when the antitheft lock 75 hits the lower end 52b.<br>
[0039]<br>
The configuration of the protector plate 51 may be varied as needed according to the configuration of the projecting portion 41 of the wheel speed sensor 40.<br>
Though an example of covering a part of the upper side<br>
41a of the projecting portion 41 of the wheel speed sensor 40<br>
with the bent portion 53  of the protector plate  51  was<br>
described above,  it is also possible to enlarge the bent<br>
portion 53 to cover the upper side of the projecting portion<br>
41 entirely.<br>
[0040] [Advantages]<br>
The construction of the present invention described above brings out the following effects.<br>
The construction is such that the protector body of the protector plate covers the side surface of the wheel speed sensor on the side of the driving wheel, and the bent portion formed by bending the protector body covers the projecting end surface of the wheel speed sensor.<br><br><br>
Therefore, the protector plate of simple structure formed simply by bending the plate member can protect the projecting end surface of the wheel speed sensor from mud or dust.<br>
[0041]<br>
In the construction, the protector body is formed into laterally elongated shape and is provided with the leg portion at the distal end thereof, and mounted in such a manner that the leg portion abuts against the gear case. Therefore, the leg portion can reinforce the distal end of the protector body. Accordingly, deformation or deflection of the protector body may be prevented by a simple construction obtained simply by providing the leg portion, and concurrently, displacement of the protector plate is prevented.<br>
Therefore, the projecting end surface of the wheel speed sensor is protected from mud or dust by the simpler structure.<br>
[0042]<br>
In the construction, the portion of the harness in the vicinity of the connecting portion can be covered by the protector body by placing the harness connected to the wheel speed sensor along the laterally elongated shape of the protector body. Therefore, the portion of the harness in the vicinity of the connecting portion can be protected from mud or dust in a simple construction. [0043]<br>
3<br><br>
In the construction according to Claim 4 , a breather hose is placed along the side surface of projecting end surface of the wheel speed sensor opposite from the protector plate. Therefore, the opposite side surface of the projecting end surface can be covered by the breather hose. Consequently, the opposite side surface of the projecting end surface can be protected from mud or dust.<br>
As is described thus far, the wheel speed sensor<br>
protection structure may be simplified by utilizing the<br>
breather hose originally for trapping oil as a wheel speed<br>
sensor protection structure. [Reference Numerals]<br>
