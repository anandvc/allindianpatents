				<td>The present invention relates to a Railway Collision Avoidance System in a railway network.<br>
The system uses a paired digital transponder (i.e. transmitter/receiver) operating in the radio band (i.e. 915-925 MHz) for interrogation and reply between trains in a railway network and producing alarms against any impending head-on or end-on collision between the trains. The system provides a safety measure for preventing collisions between trains arising from human/instrumental errors in the Route Relay Interlocking (RRI) of the existing traffic control system in the railway networks.<br>
In the Indian railway networks collision occurring between trains is still a very serious matter with over thirteen thousand trains moving in the networks everyday. There is room for adopting an improved system for preventing collision between trains caused by human/instrumental errors in the operation of the existing Route Relay Interlocking (RRI) arrangements.<br>
The commonly used Anti-collision RADARS or Anti-Collision device (ACD) can perform track mapping only for a limited distance upto 300-500 metre or so in a congested track circuit with overhead tractions and other structures. But the braking action activated at speeds in excess of 150 Km/hr with all the bulk and momentum of a moving train at distances of the RADAR visfon range is quite inadequate.<br>
The PLCC communication ACD and other copper techniques based on protocols tike the SCADA etc. can make bi-directional transfer of data and control signals for track management but these involve complicated switching circuits for operation in a closed system, which may not be compatible to any of the modern information networks for data transport and control. Moreover the provision of such systems is slow requiring a nigh grade of maintenance for the cable, track and traction.<br>
US 5,620, 155 discloses a railway train signalling system for remotely operating warning devices, at crossings and for receiving warning device operational information, comprising a transmitter and a receiver located in each train, and at each crossing of rail track and road operating in association with a global satellite positioning system or link; and a receiver in each motor vehicle crossing the rail track to receive the warning of an oncoming train.<br>
US 5,890, 682 discloses a railway crossing collision avoidance system for alerting a road vehicle approaching a railroad crossing, of an oncoming rail vehicle, comprising a tracking apparatus, a transmitter, responsive to the tracking apparatus, for transmitting tracking data over a satellite communications link and a satellite communications receiver in each train; and one each of processor, tracking apparatus, I.e. global positioning system receiver, and at least one sensor located at each rail-road crossing.<br>
/2/<br><br>
The systems disclosed in both US 5, 620, 155 and US 5, 890, 682 are meant for providing warning signals to road vehicles and for checking the operating status of signalling devices located at the crossings, operating in association with global satellite communications links. The drawbacks of these prior art systems are that (a) these are not capable of avoiding collision between trains running on the same track by automatically applying braking action on the movement of the trains to avoid collision thereof, (b) these being dependent on global satellite. Communications link for their operation, cannot function when the said link is not available.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a railway collision avoidance system (RACAS) in a train, which is of relatively simple design, compact construction and capable of establishing a quasi-packet connectivity lasting for 2-3 min or so with every train lying within its radio range, which may be 3000 metre or more in an ideal condition of the track and 1500-3000 metre under not so ideal condition of the track, for ascertaining and averting impending collisions between the trains running on a common track, by operating the braking action, on the movement of the trains automatically.<br>
The design of RACVAS is novel and relatively simple. Each train is provided with a pair of transponders (transmitter/receivers) located one each at the front and rear ends thereof. The microcontroller based transponders are paired to operate in full duplex mode and are allotted a unique identity, which corresponds to the name of the train and track on which the train is running. Each track is allotted an identity with a motion vector (Up/Down or STATIC).<br>
The transponder in each train beacons radio interrogation/identification packets of digital signals every 5/15/30 Sec or so as the train moves up or down of a track in a railway network. A master Control Unit (MCU) in the transponder compares the track identification and motion data in the received signal with the identification and motion data of the track on which the train itself is running and generates alarms against any possible head-on and end-on collision with the train from which the received signal is transmitted. The transponders used are based on the micro controllers and transceivers manufacturers by Texas Instrumwents (TT) operating on radio band (i.e.915-925 MHz), Such devices are found to be compact in size and reliable in performance.<br>
/2a/<br><br>
The various Analogue and Digital Integrated Circuits (ICs) used in each pair of transponders installed in each train are listed in Tabte I.<br>
In the invented system 250 such transponder pairs can be accommodated in a railway network, each provided with a unique Asset Tag Identity (ATI) but this number can be easily increased as required.<br>
The other sub-units used in the invented system are Static Beacons (SB) and Station Packet Terminals (5PT) which are basically of same configuration with some differences containing a reduced number ICs. The SPTs store data in the PC Hard Disc and hence the Train Data Recorder Memory (32+32 KB) is not required to be used. The SBs are provided with Train Data Recorder Memory (32+32 KB).<br>

Anti-Collision Controller (ACC) is used only in the transponder-Pairs located in Hie trains but: not In the transponders used in Static Beacons (SB) or Station Packet Terminals (SPT).<br>
The SBs are installed at intervals along a trade and at strategic locations. The SPTs inter act with the trains passing a static and log the relevant dais, time of passing and other Information which are ultimately transported to a Network Control Facility (NCF) through a long haul data transport backbone- SBs are used also for Issuing advanced warning to the trains in a circuit In cases of &amp;ack disruption, emergencies etc. SBs can also serve as repeaters in the case of curved tracks to extend the radio range for alerting trains running up and down such curved tracks. SBs can effectively protect the railway level crossings by providing advanced warning to the trains approaching the crossings regarding the traffic congestions there.<br>
The invented system can be extended Into the 3G type Railway Network Management System, which is capable of supporting train email transfers through BBS/TCP/IP connectivity, VOIP etc.<br>

Referring to Fig. 1, the anti-coliision control (ACC) (54A) desk (I) comprises a track animation and radio signal display unit (18), a battery status Indicator (2), a module power Indicator (3), a route relay interlocking (RRI) track data indicator (4), a status data indicator (5), a data transmission /reception (TXfRX) Indicator (6), a motion vector set (7), a system reset (8), an activation key/switch (9), a control bypass/standby set (10), a mode control (11), an audio alarm (12), an input data port (13), an output data port (14), with a pin jack (15) for connecting equipment marked (15A to 15 D and 34), a manual alert button (16), a danger alert (17), a master control unit (MCU) diagnostic (18), an alarm /alert set (19), a packet engine (PE) diagnostic (20), a RF CPU/ train data recorder (TDR) diagnostic (21) and an antenna (RX) (22).<br>
The input at the input data port (13) comprises a 2 byte composite data containing the train identity/asset tag data of S bit (1st byte data) stored In the anti-collision controller / master control unit (ACC/MCU EPROM), track identity data of 4 bit (2nd byte data / lower half, RRI uploaded); and status/motion vector data of 4 bit (2nd byte data /upper half, selected/enabled).<br>
The features of the output: data are also setout in Table XXL<br>
Referring to Bgs 2(A), 2 (B) and 2 (Q, a transponder (23) is located one each at the tail end (24) and head end (25) of a train (26) travelling on track (tl) (27).<br>
A signal postttiavtng signal (29), and a static beacon post (30) with static beacon (SB) (31) are also provided on the track (27). A station (32) having a station packet terminal (SPT) (33) is shown on the tack (27).<br>
6<br><br>
The transponder (23) is an UHF full duplex, frequency shift keying (FSK) transmitter/receiver. The two transponders, one located at the tail end and the other located at the head end of a train are operable in a master/slave mode. Each train in a railway network is allotted an unique Asset Tag Identity (ATT) of a Byte Word programmed in the Master Control Unit (MCU) (34) which is also a logically anti collision controller(ACQ.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, tracks (tl) (27) in a railway network are each allotted a unique identity code such as Tracks tl,t2,t3,t4,t5,t6,....tlO.<br>
The motion vector or motion status of a train moving up /down a track Is as shown below:<br><br>
The motion vector or motion status of a train is an input function set by the driver of the train in the control desk shown in Fig 1.<br>
The existing route relay interlocking device (RRI) (35) is provided with means, such as magnetic or optical or any other typer to upload a 4 bit track data to the Master Control Unit (MCU) (34) as the train moves over a track. When the train moves up^ the track,  the track data is transmitted at a frequency fi MHZ (e-g. 915 MHz) and is received at a frequency f2 MHz (eg.925 MHz). When the train moves down| the track, the track data is transmitted at a frequency f2 MHZ (e.g. 925 MHZ) and is received at a frequency fi MHZ (e.g. 915 MHZ).<br>
Static beacon SB(3i) and station packet terminal (SPT) (33) each are also provided with transponders (23) which are similar to the transponders used In the train with some changes for uploading and downloading of data from the trains passing over the track and the station and for issuing advanced warning In case of any track disruption or emergency situation occurring In the railway network.<br>
Referring to fig.4, when two trains approach each other in a head-on or end-on direction the radio signals transmitted from the transponder of each train are intercepted by each train as soon as the two trains are in the radio range of at least 1000-1500 metre. The Master Control Unit (MCU) (34) of foe transponder in each train decodes the intercepted signal data and compares the decoded data with the track data contained therein. If it is found that the two trains are on<br>
7<br><br>
the same track, the MCU switches to Its ALERT MODE and transmits continuously the Beacon Alert Signals and thereby both the trains are brought to a halt to avoid a collision thereof.<br>
Referring to Rg. 5, static beacons (SB) (31) are provided at the bends of a curved track (27), to act as repeaters for increasing the range of tf" radio signals transmitted from the tamsponders in the train moving on the same track (27).<br>
Referring to Figs. 5 ,6 and 7 the invented system is operated with link-layer protocol named as the Quase-Connectivity Format developed for modification of the known 'OCnT. Recommendation X.25 Frame Format provided with a Start Rag and a Stop Rag, by employing Bit stuffing in the flag sequence to make the packet frame less bulky. The particulars of the quasl-connectivlty format are presented in Table IV.<br>
The Quar.i-Connectivity Format (35A) uses an unnumbered information frame (U.I.) (36) having an additional 1ms training (learning) sequence 05) (37) consisting of 26.04 us pulses before every start flag, making thereby a deviation from full connectivity format of the said C&amp;TT, Recommendation X.25 protocol which demands ttte use of numbered frames with return acknowledgement before transmission of the next frame to maintain the connectivity and data integrity in coherence. The full connectivity protocol requires a fairly steady channel of tolerable bit error rate (BER).<br>
The quasi-connectMty protocol according to the present invention provides a mode of synchronous transfer of data from one point to another without requiring the acknowledgement (ACK) signal of receipt of good packets before transmission of the next frame, and without rejecting bad packets, and Is capable of carrying out date Justification and verification liberally after receipt of every frame. The quasi-connectivity protocol defines a digital transmission which starts with a training (learning) sequence (TS) (37) of 1 ms consisting of 26.04 us pulses followed by a Start flag (TF) (38) and ending with a Stop Rag (SB (39) in one single frame (36), which contains also a 2 byte address (40) consisting of 8 bit train data (ID) (41), 4 bit track data (42) and 4 bit status (43). 1 Byte information (44) consisting of 4 bit track identity (TI) (46), 4 bit Status(47) and 2 byte frame check sequence (FCS) (45).<br>
Referring to Figs. 8A and 8B the flow chart shown is used to exchange packet frame (UI) (36 of fig.7) containing track data (ID) (42) and status data (43) between two trains approaching each other, so that the two trains can read and compare each others data and take stock of the situation on the track. When the two trains are within the radio range (1500-3000 metre) of each other, the packet of digital frames transmitted from one train transponder (23) (Rg.2) is intercepted by the transponder in the other train generating a data interrupt in the packet engine (PE) (15A) (Rg.l) of the interceptor train in synchronism with the 1 ms training (learning) sequence (T5) (37) (Rg.7) and the start flag (SF) (38) (Rg.7). The data stream is read by the packet engine (PE) (15A of Rg.l.) of the interceptor train and the S byte of the data excluding the flags (Rg. 7) is stored in the memory((32 KB RX Static Random Access Memory (SRAMJfto perform the steps of the operation shown in Rg. 8B as stated below.<br>
(a) It registers the 2 byte long frame check sequence (FCS) (45) (Rg.7), calculates the FCS derived from the received chain of l's and 0's and compares the same with its own FCS (45) . If both are same (And Logic) then the data is accepted for logging and further comparison. This is a Cycle Redundancy Check (CRQ performed on every received frame.<br>
8<br><br>
(b)	If the received FCS does not laity, then it compares the data at the address field (2nd<br>
byte) with that of the information ftdd (1 byte) . It is to be noted that the track data (42)<br>
and the status data (43) which are inserted in the address field is again repeated in the<br>
information field   (44) (Rg.7) to provide forward error correction (FEQ with 50% vital<br>
data redundancy. If the two fields i.e. address (40) and information (44) match (Rg.7)<br>
and are the same (AND logic) , then the data is accepted for logging and further<br>
comparison.<br>
(c)	If, on the otherhand, the two fields i.e. address (40) and information (44) (Rg,7) do not<br>
match i.e. are not the same, then, the packet Engine (PE) (15A) (Hgs.l) rejects the frame<br>
and does not log it. A further branch of processing is then done at the master control unit<br>
(MCU)   (34) (Rg.4) by registering the address (40) and information (44) field date as<br>
different sets of data in the presence of receive signal strength Indicator (RSSI) (48) Alert<br>
which is monitored for 60 to 90 sec without any different identification packet received<br>
within the time period, and comparing the same with its own track data before deciding<br>
on a Braking Action. This fuzzy reasoning in particular has been provided to ensure safety<br>
from all logical angles. The fuzzy logic based on RSSI (48) Alert is also helpful for<br>
detecting collisions over much longer distances, although at times such logic may be<br>
embarrassing.<br>
(d)	The received/intercepted track and status data is compared with the train's resident track<br>
and status data stored in the TX memory (32KB, RX SRAM). If the two are same, then Braking Action follows along with frantic Beacon Alerts on the channel.<br>
The quasi -connectivity protocol (table IV) is a logical compromise between full connectivity and no connectivity (Proto and Unproto modes). In the Interests of safety, data fields can not be rejected as long as they are not verified. And finally if the same cannot be decided digitally, then fuzzy logic based on RSSI levels and signal direction can supplement a final evasive action.<br>
The paired digital transponders used in the invented system and shown in Rg.8A and 9 are each a dual transponder, identical In all aspects, but configured in a master/slave fashion. Only one of the two transponders in a pair carries out the braking action. Referring to Fig., 8A and 9, each transponder of a pair comprises (a) RF Part (49), (b) Packet Part (15B) and (c) Anti-Collision Control (ACC) (34A).<br>

The radb signal display {RSD) (57) displays the logic output from the RF CPU (56) which is a 4 bit data which Is decoded again on a 4 to 16 line decoder (58) in the RSI panel and is displayed by an array of LEDyPanet lamps (59) as shown in Rg.10. During boot up and during system failure the RSD Panel (57) is used by the RF CPU (56) as a diagnostics display to communicate to the user the type of failure that has occurred In the RF Part.<br>
The Packet or the Packet engine (ISA) (Figs. 1,8A,9) is based on PMS 430E112, which is the High Level Date link Layer controller (HDLQ that encodes and decodes, end compares Hie packettsed data as per the RACAS protocol (Table W) and stores valid data in the Train Data Recorder (TDR) (60) (Rg.9) which is interfaced to the pocket engine (PE) (ISA) (Fig.9) through one of its communication serial ports, the (TOR) 60).<br>
For sending identification beacons every 5/15/3Q sec. or so, an Interval Hmer Program is run either in the MCU (34) or in the PE (iSA) to generate a timed interrupt to run the Beacon subroutine programmed in the PE (ISA).<br>
Other than the programming mode, there are two other modes, namefy Safe Mode and Blind<br>
Mode. Safe Mode Is the normal mode when track and status data uploading faculty fe available<br>
