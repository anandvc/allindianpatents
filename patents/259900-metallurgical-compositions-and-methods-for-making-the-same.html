POWDER METALLURGICAL COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR MAKING THE SAME<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION	<br>
[0001] This invention relates to metal-based, metallurgical powder compositions, and more particularly, to powder compositions that include a master alloy powder for enhancing the mechanical properties of compacted parts.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION <br>
[0002] Iron-based particles have long been used as a base material in the manufacture of structural components by powder metallurgical methods. The iron-based particles are first molded in a die under high pressures to produce a desired shape. After the molding step, the compacted or "green" component usually undergoes a sintering step to impart the necessary strength to the component.<br>
[0003] The mechanical properties of compacted and sintered components can be greatly increased by the addition of certain metallurgical additives, such as for example, alloying elements. Alloy steels, for example, are traditionally prepared by mechanically mixing powder alloy additions in elemental form or as oxides. Although convenient due to its simplicity, a disadvantage of this technique is that the resulting alloyed compositions have a heterogeneous structure determined by the thermodynamic and diffusion characteristics of each elemental component. In addition, there have traditionally been problems in preparing homogeneous admixtures where particles of alloying materials are uniformly distributed and would not segregate during transport and handling. [0004] The cost associated with utilizing commonly used metallurgical additives is<br>
another disadvantage because it can unfortunately add up to a significant portion of the<br>
overall cost of the powder composition. Accordingly, it has always been of interest in<br>
the powder metallurgical industry to try to develop less costly metallurgical additives to reduce and/or replace entirely the commonly used alloying elements, such as for example copper or nickel.<br>
[0005] Another disadvantage of using, metallurgical alloying additives is that they may<br>
also impart undesircd properties to metallurgical composition. For example,<br>
manufacturers of powder metallurgy parts generally desire to limit the amount of copper and/or nickel used in compacted metallurgical parts due to the environmental and/or recycling regulations that control the use or disposal of those parts. Moreover,<br>
addition of nickel based metallurgical additives commonly results in the undesirable<br>
- 1 -<br><br>
WO 2005/099937	PCT/US2005/010514<br>
shrinkage of compacted parts when sintered at high temperatures. The powder metallurgical industry seeks to minimize shrinkage to ensure the dimensions of sintered parts are as close as possible to the dimensions of the compaction die. [0006J Accordingly, there exists a current and long felt need in the powder metallurgical industry to develop alternatives to the use of, or decrease the amount of, various common metallurgical additives in metallurgical powder compositions.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <br>
[0007] Metallurgical powder compositions of the present invention include an iron based powder and a master alloy powder composed of a plurality of alloying elements. Use of master alloy powders in place of elemental additive powders provides a compacted part with a more homogeneous structure. Therefore, addition of the master alloy powder has been found to enhance the mechanical properties of compacted parts made from metallurgical powder compositions.<br>
[0008] In one embodiment, metallurgical powder compositions include at least about 80 weight percent of an iron-based metallurgical powder and from about 0.10 to about 20 weight percent of a master alloy powder. The master alloy powder includes iron, from about 0.10 to about 40 weight percent chromium, and from about 0.10 to about 30 weight percent silicon.<br>
[0009] The present invention also provides methods for preparing metallurgical powder compositions and also methods for forming compacted and sintered metal parts from such compositions, along with the products formed by such methods. Methods of making sintered parts include compacting the metallurgical powders described above, and sintering the compacted composition. The properties of the final compacted component have been found to be obtainable at low sintering temperatures, for example below 2300° Fahrenheit. However, the properties of the final compacted component have been found to be significantly improved if the "green" compacted part is sintered at temperatures above about 2000° Fahrenheit.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0010] The present invention relates to metallurgical powder compositions composed of<br>
an iron-based powder and a master alloy powder composed of a plurality of alloying<br>
elements, methods for the preparation'of those compositions, and methods for using<br>
those compositions to make compacted parts. The present invention also relates to the<br>
compacted parts prepared by the methods described below. Use of master alloy<br>
powders in place of elemental additive powders provides a compacted part with a more<br>
 homogeneous structure. Therefore, addition of the master alloy powder has been<br>
-3-<br><br>
WO 2005/099937	PCT/US2005/010514<br>
found to enhance the mechanical properties of compacted parts made from<br>
metallurgical powder compositions. <br>
[0011] Metallurgical powder compositions include an iron-based powder, as the major component, and a master alloy powder composed of a plurality of alloying elements, as<br>
an alloying powder for enhancing mechanical properties. As used herein "master alloy<br>
powder" refers to a prealloyed powder bf high concentration of alloying materials, that<br>
will be combined with an iron-based powder to increase the alloy content of the iron-base powder and produce a metallurgical powder composition having the desired overall alloy content. The metallurgical powder compositions of the present invention<br>
also optionally include other known additives, such as for example binding agents and<br>
lubricants.<br>
[0012] Iron based powders, as that term is used herein, are powders of substantially pure<br><br>
iron, powders of iron pre-alloyed with other elements (for example, steel-producing<br>
elements) that enhance the strength, hardenability, electromagnetic properties, or other<br>
desirable properties of the final product, and powders of iron to which such other<br>
elements have been diffusion bonded. <br>
[0013] Substantially pure iron powders that are used in the invention are powders of iron containing not more than about 1.0% by weight, preferably no more than about 0.5%<br>
by weight, of normal impurities. Examples of such highly compressible,<br>
metallurgical-grade iron powders are the. ANCORSTEEL1000 series of pure iron<br>
powders, e.g. 1000,1000B, and 1000C, available from Hoeganaes Corporation,<br>
Riverton, New Jersey. For example, ANCORSTEEL 1000 iron powder, has a typical<br>
screen profile of about 22% by weight of the particles below a No. 325 sieve (U.S.<br>
series) and about 10% by weight of the particles larger than a No. 100 sieve with the<br>
remainder between these two sizes (trace amounts larger than No. 60 sieve). The<br>
ANCORSTEEL 1000 powder has an apparent density of from about 2.85-3.00 g/cm3, typically 2.94 g/cm3. Other iron powders that are used in the invention are typical sponge iron powders, such as Hoeganaes' ANCOR MH-100 powder. [0014] The iron-based powder can optionally incorporate one or more alloying elements<br>
that enhance the mechanical or other properties of the final metal part. Such iron-<br>
based powders are powders of iron, preferably substantially pure iron, that have been<br>
pre-alloyed with one or more such elements. The pre-alloyed powders are prepared by<br>
making a melt of iron and the desired alloying elements, and then atomizing the melt,<br>
whereby the atomized droplets form the powder upon solidification. Iron based<br>
-4-<br><br>
WO 2005/099937	PCT/US2005/010514<br>
powders are atomized by conventional water atomization or gas atomization techniques commonly known to those skilled in the art.<br>
[0015] Examples of alloying elements that are admixed or pie-alloyed with the iron<br>
powder include, but are not limited to, molybdenum, manganese, magnesium,<br>
chromium, silicon, copper, nickel, vanadium, columbium (niobium), carbon,<br>
phosphorus, aluminum, and combinations thereof. The amount of the alloying element<br>
or elements incorporated depends upon the properties desired in the final composition.<br>
Pre-alloyed iron-based powders that incorporate such alloying elements are available<br>
from Hoeganaes Corp. as part of its ANCORSTEEL line of powders.<br>
[0016] Iron based powders include less than 20 weight percent of an alloying element.<br>
Preferably, iron based powders include less than 15 weight percent, and more<br>
preferably include less than 10 weight percent of an alloying element, based on the<br>
weight of the iron based powder.	<br>
[0017] Other iron-based powders that are useful in the practice of the invention are<br>
ferromagnetic powders. For example, ferromagnetic powders include powders of iron pre-alloyed with small amounts of phosphorus.<br>
[0018] A further example of iron-based powders are diffusion-bonded iron-based powders which are particles of substantially pure iron that have a layer or coating of one or<br>
more other metals, such as steel-producing elements, diffused into their outer surfaces.<br>
Such commercially available powders include DISTALOY 4600A diffusion bonded<br>
powder from Hoeganaes Corporation, which contains about 1.8% nickel, about 0.55% molybdenum, and about 1.6% copper, and DISTALOY 4800A diffusion bonded powder from Hoeganaes Corporation, which contains about 4.05% nickel, about 0.55% molybdenum, and about 1.6% copper.<br>
[0019] The panicles of iron have a weight average particle size as small as one micron or below, or up to about 850-1,000 microns as determined by laser light scattering techniques, but generally the particles will have a weight average particle size in the<br>
range of about 10-500 microns. Preferred particle sizes are iron or pre-alloyed iron<br>
particles having a maximum weight average particle size up to about 350 microns; mote preferably the particles will have a weight average particle size in the range of about 25-150 microns, and most preferably 80-150 microns. [0020] Iron based powders constitute a major'portion of the metallurgical powder<br>
composition, and generally constitute at least about SO weight percent, preferably at least about S5 weight percent, and more preferably at least about 90 weight percent.<br>
- 5-<br><br>
WO 2005/099937	PCT/US2005/010514<br>
Master alloy powders constitute a minor portion of the metallurgical powder composition, and generally constitute no more than 20 weight percent of the metallurgical powder composition. Preferably, master alloy powders are present in .metallurgical compositions from about 0.5 to about 10 weight percent.<br>
[0021] Master alloy powders are prealloyed powders that include iron and a plurality of alloying elements. Examples of alloying elements that are included in master alloy powders include, but are not limited to, molybdenum, manganese, chromium, silicon, copper, nickel, vanadium, columbiurn (niobium), carbon, phosphorus, and<br>
combinations thereof. The amount of the alloying element or elements incorporated<br>
depends upon the properties desired in the final composition. Preferably, master alloy<br>
powders are composed of iron, silicon, chromium, and manganese. More preferred<br>
master alloy powders are composed of iron, silicon, and chromium.<br>
[0022] Master alloy powders are prepared by melt blending iron-based powders and a plurality of alloying elements using conventional techniques. The melt blend is then atomized, crushed, or ground using conventional techniques to obtain master alloy powder particles. Preferred particle sized powders are then segregated using conventional separation techniques. <br>
[0023] Addition of master alloy powders to iron based powders overcomes disadvantages associated with incorporating individual elemental alloying powders, such as for<br>
example, forming concentrations of alloying elements in "islands." The concentration of a given alloying material in the master alloy powder is lower than the concentration<br>
in elemental alloying powders. As a result, the number of master alloy powder<br>
particles required to obtain a specific content of an alloying element is higher<br>
compared with addition of an elemental alloying additive. Using more alloying<br>
additive, i.e., master alloy powder, distributes the alloying element throughout a<br>
compact better than addition of elemental alloying additives, even before sintering,<br>
thereby distributing the alloying elements more uniformly in the compacted part. The<br>
result of using master alloyed powders is a more homogeneous structure upon sintering<br>
compared to individual elemental alloying powders.<br>
[0024] Processes concerning alloying additives containing iron and a transition metal, e.g.,<br>
chromium, manganese, vanadium, or columbium, are disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,217,683, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Processes concerning silicon carbide alloying additives are disclosed in U.S. Patent Mo.<br>
6,364,927, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>

[0025] Although chromium, manganese, and silicon are efficient in strengthening<br>
components manufactured using powder metallurgy techniques, elemental powders of these materials have a high affinity for oxygen and readily oxidize during processing. For example, chromium oxide, manganese oxide, and silicon oxide can form during atomization with water, unless atomization conditions are rigorously controlled. Powder compositions composed of an iron-base powder and a master alloy powder exhibit lower oxygen content compared with fully prealloyed powders composed of the same alloying materials. Without being limited by theory, it is believed that master alloy powders form a thin, silicon rich oxide barrier on the surface of each powder particle that prevents further oxidation during atomization and subsequent processing. In one embodiment, the master alloy powder includes a plurality of alloying elements that have been melt blended with a low oxygen content iron-based powder to reduce the oxygen content of the master alloy powder. Low oxygen content iron-based powders include those iron based powders known to those skilled in the art.<br>
[0026] Master alloy powders advantageouslv have a melting point lower than the individual melting point of each alloying element comprising the master alloy. Without being limited by theory, it is believed that the low melting point of the master alloy compared to elemental and binary alloying systems enables the alloying elements to be distributed, e.g., diffused, more efficiently and more effectively through the compacted part upon heating. As a result, even when sintered at lower temperatures for shorter times, metallurgical powder compositions incorporating master alloy powders achieve similar mechanical properties as metallurgical powder compositions composed of individual elemental alloyirig additives. During sintering, master alloy powders can be a solid, liquid, or a mixture of liquid and solid.<br>
[0027] FIG. 1 is a ternary phase diagram for iron-chromium-silicon master alloy powders at 2050° Fahrenheit. FIG. 2 is a ternary phase diagram for iron-chromium-silicon master alloy powders at 2147° Fahrenheit. Referring to FIGs 1 &amp; 2, the hatched region of the iron-chromium-silicon ternary diagrams represent preferred compositions of master alloy powders. As shown in FIGs &amp; 2, the liquid phase field increases in size as temperature is increased thereby providing a broader liquid sintering temperature range.<br>
[0028] In comparison, the three possible binary systems, i.e., Fe-Cr, Fe-Si, and SiCr, exhibit substantially higher melting points (1200°C, 1513°C, and 1335°C respectively). When compared to these binary systems, iron-chromium-silicon master<br><br>

alloy powders diffuse more quickly through the porosity of a compacted part without the need for costly high temperature sintering furnaces. [0029] Master alloy powders generally include from about 0.10 to about 35 weight<br>
percent, and more typically, from about 1.0 to about 35 weight percent silicon based on the total weight of the metallurgical powder compositions. Preferably, master alloy powders include from about 10 to about 35 weight percent silicon. Even more preferably, master alloy powders include from about 15 to about 25 weight percent silicon. Still more preferably, master alloy powders include from about 15 to about 22 weight percent silicon.<br>
[0030] Master alloy powders generally also include from about 0.10 to about 40 weight percent, and more typically from about 1.0 to about 40 weight percent chromium based on the total weight of the metallurgical powder compositions. Preferably, master alloy powders include from about 10 to about 35 weight percent chromium. Even more preferably, master alloy powders include from about 15 to about 35 weight percent chromium.<br>
[0031] In one embodiment, the master alloy:powder includes iron, about 18 weight percent silicon, and about 29 weight percent chromium. In another embodiment, the master alloy powder includes iron, about 20 weight percent silicon, about 24 weight percent chromium.<br>
[0032] In still another embodiment, master alloy powders include up to 35 weight percent manganese. Preferable, master alloy powders includes from about 1.0 to about 35 weight percent manganese. More preferably, master alloy powders includes from<br>
about 10 to about 30 weight percent manganese. Still more preferably, master alloy<br>
powders includes from about 15 to about 25 weight percent manganese.<br>
[0033] In one embodiment, the master alloy powder includes iron and from about 1.0 to about 35 weight percent silicon, from about 1.0 to about 40 weight percent chromium, and from about 1.0 to about 35 weight percent manganese, based on the total weight of the metallurgical powder composition. Preferably, the master alloy powder includes iron and about 14 weight percent silicon, about 20 weight percent chromium, and about 20 weight percent manganese.<br>
[0034] In yet another embodiment, master alloy powders include up to 5 weight percent carbon. Preferable, master alloy powdeis includes from about 0.10 to about 5 weight percent carbon. More preferably, master alloy powders includes from about 0.1 to<br>
about 1.0 weight percent carbon.<br>

WO 2005/099937	PCT/US2005/010514<br>
[0035] In another embodiment, master alloy powders include up to 25 weight percent<br>
nickel. Preferably, master alloy powders include from about 1.0 to about 20 weight<br>
percent nickel. More preferably, master alloy powders includes from about 5 to about<br>
15 weight percent nickel.	<br>
[0036] Master alloy powders are in the formtof particles that are generally of finer size<br>
than the particles of iron-based powder with which they are admixed. Master alloy<br>
powder generally have a weight average particle size below about 100 microns,<br>
preferably below about 75 microns, more preferably below about 33 microns, and most<br>
preferably below about 11 microns. <br>
[0037] The metallurgical powder compositions can also contain a lubricant powder to reduce the ejection forces when the compacted part is removed from a compaction die cavity. Examples of such lubricants include stearate compounds, such as lithium, zinc, manganese, and calcium stearates, waxes such as ethylene bis-stearamides,<br>
polyethylene wax, and polyolefins, and mixtures of these types of lubricants. Other<br>
lubricants include those containing a poly ether compound such as. is described in U.S.<br><br>
Patent 5,498,276 to Luk, and those useful at higher compaction temperatures described<br>
 in U.S. Patent No. 5,368,630 to Luk, in addition to those disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,330,792 to Johnson et al., all of which are incorporated herein in their entireties by<br>
reference. Lubricants are added to metallurgical powder compositions using<br>
techniques known to those skilled in the art.<br>
[0038] The lubricant is generally added in an amount of up to about 2.0 weight percent, preferably'from about 0.1 to about 1.5 weight percent, more preferably from about 0.1<br>
to about 1.0 weight percent, and most preferably from about 0.2 to about 0.75 weight<br>
percent, of the metallurgical powder composition.<br>
[0039] The metallurgical powder composition may also contain one or more binding<br>
agents, particularly where two or more alloying powders are used, to bond the different components present in the metallurgical powder composition so as to inhibit<br>
segregation and to reduce dusting. By "bond" as used herein, it is meant any physical<br>
or chemical method that facilitates adhesion of the components of the metallurgical<br>
powder composition. Binding agents are added to metallurgical powder compositions<br>
using techniques known to those skilled in the art. [0040] In a preferred embodiment, bonding is' carried out through the use of at least one<br>
binding agent. Binding agents that can be used in the present invention are those<br>
commonly employed in the powder metallurgical arts. For example, such binding<br>

[0041] Such binding agents include, for example, polyglycols such as polyethylene glycol or polypropylene glycol; glycerine; polyvinyl alcohol; homopolymers or copolymers of vinyl acetate; cellulosic ester or ether resins; methacrylate polymers or copolymers; alkyd resins; polyurethane resins; polyester resins; or combinations thereof. Other<br>
examples of binding agents that are useful are the relatively high molecular weight<br><br>
polyalkylene oxide-based compositions described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,298,055 to Semel et al. Useful binding agents also include the dibasic organic acid, such as azelaic acid, and one or more polar components such as polyethers (liquid or solid) and acrylic resins as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,336 to Luk, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The binding agents in the '336 Patent to Luk can also act advantageously as a combination of binder and lubricant. Additional useful binding agents include the cellulose ester resins, hydroxy alkylcellulose resins, and thermoplastic phenolic resins described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,368,630 to Luk. [0042] The binding agent can further be low melting, solid polymers or waxes, e.g., a<br>
polymer or wax having a softening temperature of below 200°C (390°F), such as<br>
polyesters, polyethylenes, epoxies, urethanes, paraffins, ethylene bisstearamides, and<br>
cotton seed waxes, and also polyolefins with weight average molecular weights below<br>
3,000, and hydrogenated vegetable oils that are C14-24 alkyl moiety triglycerides and derivatives thereof, including hydrogenatei derivatives, e.g. cottonseed oil, soybean oil, jojoba oil, and blends thereof, as described in WO 99/20689, published April 29, , 1999, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. These binding agents can be applied by the dry bonding techniques discussed in that application and in the general amounts set forth abovefor binding agents. Further binding agents that<br>
can be used in the present invention are polyvinyl pyrrolidone as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,069,714, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference, or tall oil<br>
esters.<br>
[0043] The amount of binding agent present in the metallurgical powder composition<br>
depends on such factors as the density, particle size distribution and amounts of the<br>
iron based powder and master alloy powder in the metallurgical powder composition.<br>
Generally, the binding agent will be added in an amount of at least about 0.005 weight<br>
- 10 -<br><br>
WO 2005/099937	PCT/US2005/010514<br>
percent, more preferably from about 0.005 weight percent to about 2 weight percent, and most preferably from about 0.05|weight percent to about 1 weight percent, based on the total weight of the metallurgical powder composition.<br>
[0044] The components of the metallurgical powder compositions of the invention can be prepared following conventional powder metallurgy techniques. Generally, the iron<br>
based powder, master alloy powder, and optionally the solid lubricant and/or binder<br>
(along with any other additive, such as an alloying additive) are admixed together<br>
using conventional powder metallurgy techniques, such as the use of a double cone<br>
blender. The blended powder composition is then ready for use.<br>
[0045] The metallurgical powder compositions are formed into compacted parts using conventional techniques. The compacting may be carried out at temperatures ranging from room temperature to about 375°C. In any compaction technique, a lubricant, usually in an amount up to about 1 percent by weight, can be mixed into the powder composition or applied directly on the die or mold wall. Use of the lubricant reduces stripping and sliding pressures associated with extracting a compacted component from a die cavity. Typically, the metallurgical powder composition is poured into a die cavity and compacted under pressure, such as between about 5 and about 200 tons per square inch (tsi), more commonly between about 10 and 100 tsi. Preferably the metallurgical powder composition is compacted at a pressure from about 30 to about 80 tsi, and more preferably from about 40 to about 80 tsi. The compacted part is then ejected from the die cavity.<br>
[0046] Compacted ("green") parts may be sintered to enhance mechanical properties, for example strength. Green parts are sintered at conventional sintering temperatures known to those skilled in the art. Sintering techniques are described in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,969,276, which isiherein incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
[0047] Preferably, green parts are sintered at a temperature of no less than about 2000°F, however, typically compacted parts are sintered at a temperature of no less than about 2050°F. For example, green compacts are sintered at a temperature of from about 2000 °F to about 2150 °F. The mechanical properties of green parts have been found to improve if sintered at temperatures greater than about 2150° F, preferably above about 2200° F, more preferably above about 2250° F, and even more preferably above about 2300° F. For example, green compacts are sintered at a temperature of from about 2000 °F to about 2400 °F.<br>
- 11-<br><br>
WO 2005/099937	PCT/US2005/010514<br>
[0048] The compacted component is maintained at the sintering temperature for a time<br>
sufficient to achieve metallurgical bonding and alloying. Generally, heating is<br>
required for about 0.5 hours to about 3 hours, more preferably from about 0.5 hours to<br>
about 1 hour, depending on the size and initial temperature of the compacted<br>
component. The sintering is preferably conducted in an inert atmosphere such as<br>
nitrogen, hydrogen, or a noble gas such as argon. Also, the sintering is preferably performed after the compacted component has been removed from the die.<br>
[0049] It is preferred, as shown in the following examples, to sinter the metallurgical<br>
powder composition at a temperature that will cause alloying elements containedin the<br>
master alloy powder to diffuse into the iron matrix of the iron-based powder such that<br>
it alloys with the iron. Additional processes such as forging or other appropriate<br>
manufacturing technique or secondary operation may be used to produce the finished<br>
part. For example compacted parts can be optionally heat treated. Heat treatments to<br>
further improve mechanical properties include those known to those skilled in the art,<br>
such as for example tempering. [0050] Some embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail in the<br>
following Examples. Metallurgical powder compositions were prepared and formed<br>
into compacted components in accordance with the methods of the present invention.<br>
Also, other iron powders were prepared and formed into core components for<br>
. comparative purposes. The core components formed were evaluated for mechanical<br>
properties. EXAMPLES [0051] The following examples, which are not intended to be limiting, present certain<br>
embodiments and advantages of the present invention. Unless otherwise indicated, any<br>
percentages are on a weight basis. [0052] Physical properties of powder mixtures and of the green and sintered compacts<br>
were determined generally in accordance with the following test methods of the<br>

Example 1	<br>
[0053] Metallurgical powder compositions containing master alloy powders were<br>
evaluated and compared to a reference powder without addition of an alloying powder<br>
and a reference powder composed of a chromium containing powder additive and a<br>
separate silicon containing powder additive. Reference Powder I included an iron<br>
based powder admixed with 0.75 weight percent of an ethylene bis-stearamide wax<br>
lubricant (commercially available as Acrawax, from Glycol Chemical Co.) and 0.6<br>
weight percent carbon (commercially available as 3203 graphite, from Asbury<br>
Graphite Mills). The iron based powder was an iron powder prealloyed with 0.85<br>
weight percent molybdenum (commercially available as Ancorsteel 85 HP, from<br>
Hoeganaes Corp.).	<br>
[0054] Reference Powder II was prepared by admixing Reference Powder I with an iron-chromium-carbon alloying additive powder having a weight average particle size of<br>
9.3 microns, (commercially available as High Carbon Ferrochrome powder, from F.W.<br>
Winter Co.) and a conventional silicon containing additive powder having a weight average particle size of 7.6 microns. Once admixed with both additive powders, Reference Composition II included 0.4 weight percent chromium, 0.35 weight percent silicon.<br>
[0055] Test Compositions I was prepared by admixing Reference Powder I with a master alloy powder. The master alloy powder included 24.0 weight percent chromium, 20.0 weight percent silicon, and 56 weight percent iron, based on the weight of the master alloy, and had a weight average particle size of 11 microns. With addition of the<br>
master alloy powder, Test Composition I included 0.4 weight percent chromium and<br>
0.35 weight percent silicon.	<br>
[0056] Each powder composition was pressed at 45 tons per square inch. Bars measuring<br>
0.25 inches high, 0.5 inches wide, and 1.25 inches long were prepared for Transverse<br>
Rupture Strength testing. Additional samples were prepared for tensile strength testing. The compacts were then sintered in a 90% nitrogen and 10% hydrogen atmosphere at two different commercial sintering temperatures, i.e., 2050 degrees Fahrenheit and 2300 degrees Fahrenheit respectively.<br>

[0058] FIG. 3 is a bar graph of transverse rupture strength properties of metallurgical<br>
powder compositions and reference compositions after sintering at 2050 and 2300<br>
degrees Fahrenheit. FIG. 4 is a bar graph of ultimate tensile strength properties of<br>
metallurgical powder compositions and reference compositions after sintering at 2050 '<br>
and 2300 degrees Fahrenheit. Referring to FIGs. 3 &amp; 4, after sintering at 2050 and<br>
2300 degrees Fahrenheit, Test Composition I exhibited higher transverse rupture<br>
strength and higher ultimate tensile strength compared to Reference Powders I and 13. After sintering at 2300 degrees Fahrenheit, Test Composition I exhibited higher transverse rupture strength and higher ultimate tensile strength compared to Test Composition I sintered at 2050 degrees Fahrenheit.<br>
[0059] Without being limited by theory, it is believed that strength of metallurgical powder compositions composed of the master alloy powder increase in strength as sintering temperature and time are increased. Higher sintering temperature<br>
temperatures and longer sintering times provide improved diffusion of master alloy<br>
powders, which improves the strength of sintered compacts.<br><br>

[0060] Metallurgical powder compositions, Test Compositions I-V, were prepared with<br>
master alloy powders having different weight average particle sizes. Each of Test<br>

master alloy powder, each test composition included 0.4 weight percent chromium and<br>
0.35 weight percent silicon.	<br>
[0061] The master alloy powder of Test Composition I, as described in Example I, had a weight average particle size of 11 µm The master alloy powder of Test Composition<br>

Composition III had a weight average particle size of 18 µm. The master alloy powder<br>
of Test Composition IV had a weight average particle size of 26 µm. The master alloy powder of Test Composition V had a weight average particle size of 45µm. [0062] Each Test Composition was pressed into bars as described in Example I and sintered at 2050 and 2300 degrees Fahrenheit in an atmosphere composed of 90% nitrogen and 10 % hydrogen.

after sintering at 2050 degrees Fahrenheit. Referring to FIG. 5 and Tables 1, 3a, and 3b, after sintering at 2050 °F, Test Compositions I - IV, (i.e., those composed of master alloy powder with particle sized less than or equal to 26 microns), exhibited a higher transverse rupture strength compared to Reference Powders I &amp; II. Statistical analysis of the best fit line though the data points indicates that master alloy powders having a particle size less than 37 microns have better mechanical properties compared to the Reference Powders and Test Composition V. Without being limited by theory, it is believed that master alloy powders Having smaller particle sizes yield a better distribution of the alloying elements in the sintered compact thereby improving the<br>
mechanical properties of the sintered part.<br>

[0068] FIG. 7 is a magnified view of, Test Composition V, a sintered metallurgical powder composition prepared with 45µm master alloy powder comprising iron, 24%<br>
chromium, and 20% silicon. Referring to Figure 7, metallographic analysis shows that<br>
addition of large particle size master alloy powder yielded large pores caused by<br>
melting and diffusion by capillary motion.<br>
[0069] FIG. 8 is a magnified view of, Test Composition I, a sintered metallurgical powder composition prepared with 11µm master alloy powder comprising iron, 24% chromium, and 20% silicon. Referringjto Figure 8, metallographic .analysis shows that<br>
addition of small particle size master alloy powders resulted in porosity similar to the<br>
surrounding porosity of the sintered body. Without being limited by theory it is<br>
believed that large particle size master alloy powders provides for higher porosity in<br>
the final sintered component compared to lower particle size master alloy powders.<br>

Thus, metallurgical powder compositions composed of small particle size master alloy<br>
powders increased fracture toughness and fatigue life of sintered components<br>
compared to large particle size master alloy powders.<br>
