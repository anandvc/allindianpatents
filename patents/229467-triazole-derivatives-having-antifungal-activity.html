				<td>TRIAZOLE DERIVATIVES HAVING ANTIFUNGAL ACTIVITY<br>
The present invention relates to triazole derivatives having excellent activity<br>
against a wide range of fungi, to certain of said derivatives in crystalline form, to a<br>
pharmaceutical composition containing said derivatives, to the use of said derivatives<br>
in treating and preventing fungal infections and to an intermediate useful in the<br>
preparation of said derivatives.<br>
Antifungal triazole derivatives having the following general formula are<br>
disclosed in Japanese Patent Application (Kokai) Hei 8-333350 and EP-A-0841327:<br><br>
wherein Ra represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group, Rb represents an alkyl<br>
group. Ar1 and Ar2 can each represent an optionally substituted phenyl group, q and r<br>
can each represent 1, and each of Rc, Rd, Rc and Rf can represent a hydrogen atom.<br>
Similar compounds, in which the sulfur atom is replaced by a methylene group are<br>
disclosed in Japanese Patent Application (Kokai) Hei 11-80135 and WO-A-99/02524.<br>
These prior art compounds show good antifungal activity. There is, however,<br>
a need for further compounds having improved antifungal activity, stability,<br>
pharmacokinetics and safety.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a series of new<br>
compounds having antifungal activity.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent as<br>
the description proceeds.'<br><br><br>
The compounds of the present invention are compounds of the following<br>
formula (I), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and ester derivatives thereof:<br><br>
wherein Ar is a phenyl group which may optionally be substituted by from 1 to 3<br>
substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen atoms and trifluoromethy]<br>
groups.<br>
The present invention also provides the compound (2R.3R)-3-[[trans-2-<br>
((lE.3E)-4-(4-cyano-2-nuorophenyl)-1.3-butadien-l-yl]-1.3-dioxan-5-y)]thio]-2-(2.4-<br>

pharmaccutically acceptable diluent or carrier therefor, wherein said<br>
pharmacologically active compound is a compound of formula (I) or a<br>
pharmaceuticaHy acceptable salt or ester derivative thereof.<br>
The present invention also provides a compound of formula (I) or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester derivative thereof for use as a medicament<br><br><br>
and the use of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or<br>
ester derivative thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for the prophylaxis or<br>

(2R.3R)-3-[[trans-2-[(lE.3E)-4-(4-cyano-2-fluorophenyl)-1.3-butadien-l-yl]-1.3-<br>
dioxan-5-yl]thio]-2-(2.4-difluorophenyl)-1 -(1H-1.2.4-triazol-1 -yl)-2-butanol. by me<br>
powder method using the copper Kα-ray. X = 1.54 A. The vertical axis of the powder<br>
X-ray diffraction pattern indicates diffraction intensity in units of counts/second (cps).<br>
while the horizontal axis indicates the diffraction angle as the value 20.<br>
Figure 2 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of a second crystalline form of<br>
(2R,3R)-3-[[trans-2-[(lE.3E)-4-(4-cyano-2-fluorophenyl)-1.3-butadien-l-yl]-1.3-<br>
dioxan-5-yl]thio]-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-1 -(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1 -yl)-2-butanol. by the<br>
powder method using the copper Kα-ray, X = 1.54 A. The vertical axis of the powder<br>
X-ray diffraction pattern indicates diffraction intensity in units of counts/second (cps),<br>
while the horizontal axis indicates the diffraction angle as the value 29.<br>
Examples of the halogen atoms which are optional substituents on the group<br>
Ar include fluorine, chlorine and bromine atoms. Fluorine and chlorine atoms are<br>
preferred, and fluorine atoms are most preferred.<br>
Examples of the substituent Ar include phenyl, dichlorophenyl.<br>
difluorophenyl, dibromophenyl, chlorophenyl, fluorophenyl, bromophenyl.<br>
trifluorophenyl, trichlorophenyl, tribromophenyl, (trifluoromethyl)phenyl,<br>
bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl, tris(trifluoromethyl)phenyl, fluoro(trifluoromethyl)phenyl<br>
and chloro(trifluoromethyl)phenyl groups. Preferably, the group Ar is a phenyl<br>
group which is substituted by 1 or 2 substituents selected from fluorine atoms,<br>
chlorine atoms and trifluoromethyl groups. More preferably, the substituent Ar is a<br>
phenyl group which is substituted with 1 or 2 fluorine atom(s). Still more preferably,<br>
the substituent Ar is a 2-fluorophenyl, 4-fluorophenyl, 2,3-difluorophenyl, 2,4-<br>
difluorophenyl or 2,5-difluorophenyl group, particularly a 2-fluorophenyl or 2,4-<br>
difluorophenyl group. Most preferably, the substituent Ar is a 2,4-difluorophenyl<br>
group.<br><br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) of the present invention can exist in the form of<br>
stereoisomers and geometrical isomers. There are two asymmetric carbon atoms in<br>
the compounds of formula (I) and each of said carbon atoms can therefore take the R<br>
or S configuration. Preferably both of them are R configuration. These optical<br>
isomers can be isolated by a conventional optical resolution method. Each of the four<br>
possible optical isomers for any given compound of formula (I) can be prepared by<br>
asymmetric synthesis. These optical isomers can also be isolated by conventional<br>
techniques such as fractional crystallization and chromatography.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) have a 2.5-disubstituted-1.3-dioxane ring.<br>
Consequently, they can exist as cis or trans isomers with regard to the 2- and 5-<br>
positions. The trans isomers are preferred. These cis and trans isomers can be<br>
isolated by conventional techniques such as fractional crystallization and<br>
chromatography.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) have two double bonds. Consequently, they<br>
exist as geometrical isomers in which each double bond has either the E or Z<br>
configuration. The preferred geometrical isomers are those in which both of the<br>
double bonds are E configuration. These geometrical isomers can be isolated by<br>
conventional techniques such as fractional crystallization and chromatography.<br>
The present invention includes each of the individual isomers described above<br>
and mixtures of two or more thereof in any proportion, including racemic mixtures.<br>
Of the possible isomers of the compounds of formula (I), the following isomer<br>
of formula (la) is most preferred:<br><br><br>
The present invention encompasses pharmaceutically acceptable ester<br>
derivatives of the compounds of formula (I). These pharmaceutically acceptable ester<br>
derivatives are so-called pro-drugs, in which a functional group (the hydroxy group)<br>
in the compound of formula (I) is protected by a group which is capable of being<br>
cleaved by a chemical or biological process (e.g. by hydrolysis) on administration of<br>
the derivative to the body of a live animal to give the parent compound of formula (I)<br>
or a salt thereof. Whether a derivative of a compound of formula (I) is<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable can be easily determined. The ester derivative under<br>
investigation is administered orally or intravenously to a test animal such as a mouse<br>
or a rat and the body fluids of the test animal are thereafter studied. If the parent<br>
compound of formula (I) or a salt thereof is detected in the body fluids of the test<br>
animal, the ester derivative under investigation is judged to be a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable ester derivative of the compound of formula (I).<br>
The group in the compounds of formula (I) which can be modified to give a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable ester derivative thereof is the hydroxyl group. Thus, the<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable ester derivatives of the compounds of formula (I) are<br>
those in which the hydroxyl group is protected to give an ester derivative which is<br>
capable of being cleaved in the body of a live animal to give the parent compound of<br>
formula (I) or a salt thereof.<br>
Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable ester derivatives of the compounds<br>
of formula (I) are those in which the hydroxy group is protected by an acyl group.<br>

process for preparing the compounds of formula (V) described in Japanese Patent<br>
Application (Kokai) Hei 8-333350. Salts of the compounds of formula (V) can be<br>
obtained by the removal of the acetal protecting group from the compounds of<br>
formula (Va) using an acid.<br>
In method A, an acetal derivative of the compound of formula (II) can be used<br>
as an alternative starting material to the compound of formula (II). The compound of<br>
formula (II) can be prepared by Method B described below, while the acetal<br>

mixture or the residue of the reaction mixture obtained by evaporation of the solvent<br>
from the reaction mixture is partitioned between an organic solvent and water,<br>
washing the organic layer with water and then distilling off the solvent to give the<br>

A modified version of the procedure described in Japanese Journal of Medical<br>
Mycology, 36, 62 (1995) was used, MICs being determined by the broth<br>
microdilution method. Each test compound was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide<br>
(DMSO). Serial two-fold dilutions of each compound were prepared with DMSO and<br>
then final dilutions were prepared with RPMI1640 medium (product of Dainippon<br>
Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) which was buffered to pH 7.0 with 0.165 M 3-<br>
(morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS). The final concentration of DMSO did<br>
not exceed 1%. Colonies of the test fungi were suspended in physiological saline<br>
followed by adjustment to 5.0 x 102 to 2.5 x 103 cells/ml with RPMI1640 medium<br>
which was buffered to pH 7.0 with 0.165 M MOPS. 100 uJ of the fungal suspension<br>
were added to each of the wells of microtitre plates and then 100 ul of each diluted<br>
test compound were added to one of said wells and mixed with the fungal suspension<br><br>
therein, before incubating at 35°C for 24-72 hours. When obvious growth was<br>
observed in the compound-free control wells, the MICs were determined for each test<br>
compound. The MICs were defined as the lowest compound concentrations causing<br>
at least 80% growth inhibition when compared with the control.<br>
l(ii) Measurement method for Cnptococcus neoformans<br>
A modified version of the Broth Dilution Antifungal Susceptibility Testing of<br>
Yeast; Approved Standard M27-A (Vol. 17, No. 9. June 1997. NCCLS) was used.<br>
MICs being determined by the broth microdilution method. Each test compound was<br>
dissolved in DMSO. Serial two-fold dilutions of each compound were prepared with<br>
DMSO and final dilutions were prepared with yeast nitrogen base medium (product of<br>
Difco Laboratories) buffered to pH 7.0 with 0.165 M MOPS. The final concentration<br>
of DMSO did not exceed 1%. Colonies of the test fungi were suspended in<br>
physiological saline followed by adjustment to 5.0 x 103 to 2.5 x 104 cells/ml with<br>
yeast nitrogen base medium buffered to pH 7.0 with 0.165 M MOPS. 100 ul of the<br>
fungal suspension were added to each of the wells of microtitre plates and then 100 ul<br>
of each diluted test compound were added to one of said wells and mixed with the<br>
fungal suspension therein, before incubating at 35°C for 48-72 hours. When obvious<br>
growth was observed in the compound-free control wells, the MICs were determined<br>
for each test compound. The MICs were defined as the lowest compound<br>
concentrations causing at least 50% growth inhibition when compared with the<br>
control as measured by light absorbance at 485 nm.<br>
l(iii-) Measurement method for Aspergillus species<br>
A modified version of the protocol in Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 39, 314<br>
(1995) was used, MICs being determined by the broth microdilution method. Test<br>
compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Serial two-fold dilutions<br>
of each compound were prepared with DMSO and then final dilutions were prepared<br>
with RPMI1640 medium (product of Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) buffered to<br>
pH 7.0 with 0.165 M MOPS. The final concentration of DMSO did not exceed 1%.<br>
Colonies of the test fungi were suspended in physiological saline followed by<br>
adjustment to about 1.0 x 104 cells/ml with RPMI1640 medium buffered to pH 7.0<br><br>
with 0.165 M MOPS. 100 µl of the fungal suspension were added to each of the wel<br>
of microtitre plates and then 100 ul of each diluted test compound were added to or<br>
of the wells and mixed with the fungal suspension therein, before incubating at 30°<br>
for 24-72 hours. When obvious growth was observed in the compound-free contn<br>
wells, the MICs were determined for each test compound. The MICs were defined *<br>
the lowest compound concentrations causing at least 80% growth inhibition whe<br>
compared with the control.<br>
