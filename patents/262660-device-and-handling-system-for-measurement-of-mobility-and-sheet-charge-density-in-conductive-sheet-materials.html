RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application<br>
No. 60/659,847, filed March 9, 2005, and is a continuation-in-part of co-pending U.S.<br>
Patent Application Serial No. 10/915,877, filed August 11, 2004, both of which are<br>
hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[002] The invention relates to nondestructive measurement and mapping of<br>
materials, particularly using microwaves in the measurement of sheet charge density, and<br>
mobility and sheet resistance in semiconductor wafers and flat panel displays.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[003] Existing instruments that employ microwaves in the measurement of sheet<br>
resistance in GaAs wafers employ an X-band waveguide configuration with a<br>
characteristic impedance of 300 ohms which does not permit accurate measurement of<br>
wafers with thin cap layers. Such instruments are discussed in U.S. Patent No. 4,605,893,<br>
to Norman Braslau. One disadvantage of these instruments is an inability to separately<br>
measure the properties of multiple conducting layers in wafers that contain such layers,<br>
e.g. a high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) wafer, which contains a two-dimensional<br>
(2D) channel layer and a cap layer. Therefore, one must measure the sheet resistance and<br>
mobility at temperatures lower than 300 degrees Kelvin, such as at 77 degrees Kelvin, in<br>
such existing systems in order to increase the channel-layer mobility relative to the<br>
conductance of the cap layer. These instruments also require involved calibration<br>
procedures.<br>
[004] Destructive techniques for measurement of sheet resistance and mobility<br>
are also known. However, such techniques necessarily damage the wafers or other<br>
material being measured.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[005] A device for nondestructive measurement of mobility and sheet charge<br>
density in sheet materials includes a microwave source, a circular waveguide configured<br><br>
to transmit microwaves received from the microwave source to a conductive sheet<br>
material, such as a semiconductor wafer or flat panel display, a first detector for receiving<br>
the forward microwave power, a second detector for detecting the microwave power<br>
reflected from the material, and a third detector for detecting the Hall effect power. A<br>
circular waveguide, carrying only the TE11 mode, is terminated by the wafer behind<br>
which, at a distance of Â¼ wavelength, a short is located. Perpendicular to the plane of the<br>
wafer (and along the axis of the waveguide), a variable magnetic field is applied. In this<br>
configuration, a given incident TEn wave will cause two reflected waves. One is the<br>
ordinary reflected wave in the same polarization as the incident one. This is used to<br>
measure sheet resistance. The other reflected wave is caused by the Hall effect. Its<br>
polarization is perpendicular to the former wave and this can be separately detected with a<br>
properly configured probe.<br>
[006] A device for measurement of mobility and sheet charge density in<br>
conductive sheet materials includes a microwave source; a circular waveguide positioned<br>
to receive microwave power from the microwave source; a mount adapted to position a<br>
sheet material item at a measurement location to receive microwave power transmitted<br>
from the circular waveguide; a magnet positioned to induce a magnetic field at the<br>
measurement location; a first detector positioned to detect the power of the microwave<br>
power source; a second detector positioned to detect the power of the microwave power<br>
reflected from a sheet material item in the measurement location; and a third detector<br>
positioned to detect a Hall effect microwave power. A fourth detector may be provided to<br>
detect magnetic field strength at the measurement location. The mount may have a<br>
surface and a disc positioned in the mount, said disc having a planar surface recessed<br>
from said mount surface, said disc being rotatable about an axis substantially<br>
perpendicular to the plane of said disc planar surface, and said disc having a bore therein,<br>
said bore not being coaxial with said axis of rotation.<br>
[007] A method for measurement of mobility and sheet charge density in<br>
conductive sheet materials includes generating microwave power; transmitting only the<br>
TEn mode of the generated microwave power successively to a sheet material sample;<br>
during the step of transmission, applying a magnetic field of selected intensities; detecting<br>
microwave field strength at a forward position; detecting microwave field strength<br>
reflected from each of a conductive short and a sample; detecting Hall effect microwave<br><br>
field strength; and, based on the detected microwave field strengths, calculating values for<br>
mobility and sheet charge density.<br>
[008] An automatic handling system is disclosed for measurement of mobility<br>
and sheet charge density in conductive sheet materials. The system can comprise a<br>
microwave source, a waveguide positioned to receive microwave power from said<br>
microwave source, and an an end effector adapted to position a sheet material item at a<br>
measurement location to receive microwave power transmitted from said circular<br>
waveguide. The end effector can be movable between an adjustment position and a test<br>
position, wherein the adjustment position is a position at which the rotational position of<br>
the sheet material item is selectably adjustable, and the test position is the position at<br>
which at least one test can be performed on the sheet material item using the waveguide.<br>
The system can further comprise a magnet positioned to induce a magnetic field at the<br>
test location, a first detector to detect the power of the microwave power source, a second<br>
detector to detect the power of the microwave power reflected from a sheet material item<br>
in the measurement location, and a third detector to detect a Hall effect microwave power.<br>
[009] The automatic handling system may further comprising a second end-<br>
effector configured to engage the sheet material item, and a sheet resistance unit having<br>
first and second oppositely disposed coils for measuring the sheet resistance of the sheet<br>
material item, wherein the second end-effector is movably adjustable with respect to the<br>
sheet resistance unit to enable the unit to take a plurality of measurements on the sheet<br>
material item.<br>
[0010] A mount for sheet material is disclosed, comprising an end effector for<br>
engaging an item of sheet material and moving it along a first axis, the end effector<br>
further configured to be rotated about the first axis using a first servo motor. A rotator-<br>
lifter is also included for engaging the item of sheet material and moving it along a<br>
second axis substantially perpendicular to said first axis, the rotator-lifter further<br>
configured to rotate about the second axis using a second servo motor, wherein the end<br>
effector and the rotator-lifter each comprises at least one vacuum element for engaging an<br>
item of sheet material. The mount can further comprise an adjustable base being movable<br>
using a third servo motor, the end effector being mounted on the adjustable base for<br>
movement with respect to the rotator-lifter.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0031] The present invention includes an apparatus and method for measurement<br>
of sheet resistance and sheet charge density in semiconductive materials. The device<br>
includes a microwave source, that has an output coupled to a waveguide configuration in<br>
which a small amount of the incident wave is diverted, and the greater portion of the<br>
incident wave is transmitted along a main branch. The main branch is coupled to a<br>
circular waveguide. The circular waveguide transmits only the TEn(transverse electric 1,<br>
1) mode of the microwave power. The circular waveguide receives power at an interface,<br>
and outputs power to a test region having a mount for supporting either a conductive test<br>
item, such as a short, or a wafer or other conductive sheet item to be tested. A magnet is<br>
provided to apply a magnetic field at the test region. At least four values are detected in<br>
the calculation of sheet resistance and sheet charge density in a method and apparatus of<br>
the invention. A detector is provided to detect the total microwave power output. A<br>
second detector is provided to detect the strength of a conventional reflected wave in the<br>
same polarization as the incident wave. A third detector is provided to detect a second<br>
reflected wave having a polarization opposite to that of the incident wave. There is<br>
preferably provided a Hall effect probe to detect this rotated reflected wave, which probe<br><br>
is electrically coupled to a directional coupler. The diverted portion of the incident wave,<br>
after passing through a variable attenuator and variable phase shifter, is also coupled to<br>
this Hall directional coupler, in order to eliminate by destructive interferences any<br>
spurious incident signal at said detector. The Hall directional coupler is then coupled to a<br>
detector. A fourth detector detects the magnetic field strength.<br>
[0032] Figures 1 and 2 depict schematically the components of an apparatus 10 in<br>
accordance with the invention. Apparatus 10 includes microwave source module 15<br>
which may provide microwaves having a frequency of about 10 GHz, although other<br>
frequencies may be employed. For example, higher frequencies may be employed to<br>
enable a smaller measurement area on the wafer or other item being tested. Source<br>
module 15 may include a Gunn diode, for example, and other sources may be employed.<br>
Source module 15 includes the microwave source 16, such as a Gunn diode, which is<br>
coupled to means for diverting a small portion of the forward power to a side branch, or<br>
attenuation and phase branch. The means for diverting a small portion of the forward<br>
power to a side branch may be coupler 21. Coupler 21 may be, for example, a cross<br>
guide coupler, and may be more specifically by way of example a 20dB cross guide<br>
coupler or a directional coupler. Directional coupler 21 is coupled to side branch 22,<br>
discussed below. The majority of the power output by source 16 is coupled through<br>
coupler 21 to a second directional coupler 210. Second directional coupler 210 provides<br>
a portion of the power to forward power detector 18. Second directional coupler 210 may<br>
be a lOdB coupler. Second directional coupler 210 outputs the majority of the power<br>
through a waveguide to isolator 17. Isolator 17 may be of conventional or other suitable<br>
design to prevent power from elsewhere in apparatus 10 from entering source 15. A<br>
second isolator may be used in series with isolator 17.<br>
[0033] The diversion of a portion of the forward power to side branch 22 is used<br>
in properly balancing the Hall effect probe to zero in the absence of an applied magnetic<br>
field. The side branch 22 has a single computer controlled variable attenuator 35 and<br>
computer controlled variable phase shifter 40 in order to produce a very small signal of<br>
the proper phase that can be used to make an ultra-fine correlation in zeroing the Hall<br>
effect probe in the absence of a magnetic field. As the variable attenuator 35 and variable<br>
phase shifter 40 are preferably-computer controlled, adjustments are facilitated. It will be<br><br>
understood that, in principle, the variable attenuator and phase shifter could be manually<br>
adjustable.<br>
[0034] The main output of coupler 21 will be referred to as main branch 24. Main<br>
branch 24 preferably has a waveguide for transmission of microwave power to transition<br>
25. Main branch 24 may include conventional rectangular waveguide 20. As shown in<br>
Fig. 2, reflected power detector 23 is shown in main branch 24. Reflected power detector<br>
23 detects microwave power being transmitted from transition 25 toward source 15.<br>
Reflected power detector 23 detects power reflected from test items back into main<br>
branch 24. Directional coupler 220, in main branch 24 and coupled to source 15 and<br>
transition 25, directs reflected power from main branch 24 to reflected power detector 23.<br>
[0035] As noted above, a circular waveguide is provided positioned to receive<br>
microwave power from source 15. Specifically, circular waveguide 50 is coupled through<br>
coupler 21 and main branch 24 to source 15. Conventional rectangular waveguide 20 is<br>
coupled via a matched transition 25 into circular waveguide 50. Circular waveguide 50 is<br>
a cylindrical waveguide with a circular cross-section. Circular waveguide 50 transmits<br>
only the TE11 mode of the power. Circular waveguide interface 25 is coupled to circular<br>
waveguide 50, shown, for example, in Figure 2. The coupling of the circular waveguide<br>
50 to conventional waveguide 20 must be calibrated carefully to minimize reflection and<br>
loss of signal strength. The calibration procedure is set forth below. Circular waveguide<br>
50 is mounted on interface 25 perpendicular to the long axis of conventional waveguide<br>
20. The calibration may be effected by adjustment of the position of circular waveguide<br>
25 along its long axis relative to interface 25. In one embodiment, circular waveguide 50<br>
is mounted on the interface 25. A circular waveguide adjustment 55 is provided in the<br>
form of a handle that rotates circular waveguide 50, so that the rotational position of<br>
circular waveguide 50 may be adjusted.<br>
[0036] A mount 60 is provided to hold a sample of sheet material at a<br>
measurement location where microwave power transmitted from the circular waveguide<br>
50 is received. The sample may be a wafer or other semiconductive test material 59. A<br>
moving short 65 is provided on the opposite side of the wafer or other material from the<br>
opening of circular waveguide 50. The moving short 65 will be placed Â¼ wavelength<br>
from the wafer or other material. Moving short 65 may be in the form of a polished metal<br><br>
plug. Moving short 65 is mounted in mount 60, which may be in the form of a vacuum<br>
chuck.. Mount 60 is adapted to hold a wafer or other material in sheet form at an end of<br>
circular waveguide 50 opposite to interface 25. Moving short 65 is provided inside of<br>
mount 60 and is capable of being positioned precisely. Mount 60 can move relative to<br>
circular waveguide 50 in order to adjust the gap between waveguide 50 and moving short<br>
65.<br>
[0037] A detector, forward power detector 18, is positioned in source module 15<br>
to detect the forward power. As noted above, a directional coupler 220 is positioned in<br>
main branch 24 so as to direct reflected microwave power to detector 23. The reflected<br>
power detected by detector 23 has the same polarization as the forward microwave power.<br>
Hall probe 70 is inserted in circular waveguide 50 positioned to detect Hall effect<br>
microwave power reflected from material positioned in the vacuum chuck. Hall probe 70<br>
may be located at a variety of positions within circular waveguide 50. The Hall effect<br>
power has polarization perpendicular to the polarization of the incident wave. As<br>
discussed below, the calibration and tuning process provides that only the Hall effect<br>
power is detected by Hall detector 95.<br>
[0038] Hall probe 70 is coupled through coaxial line 75 to an input of directional<br>
coupler 80. Directional coupler 80 may be a 20 dB directional coupler. The output of<br>
branch 22, after passing through the attenuator module and variable phase shifter, is<br>
connected to an input of directional coupler 80. The output of directional coupler 80 is<br>
coupled to Hall detector 95. The calibration process, as described below, provides that<br>
the Hall detector 95 detects only power having a polarization perpendicular to that of the<br>
forward power. This power detected by Hall detector 95 is thus Hall effect power<br>
reflected from a sample.<br>
[0039] Details of an exemplary embodiment of the transition, circular waveguide,<br>
and mount will now be described. Figure 3 is an isometric view, with partial cutaway, of<br>
interface 25. Figure 4 is a sectional view along line 4-4 of Fig. 3. Interface 25 has a<br>
primary rectangular chamber 100 coupled at one end thereof to conventional waveguide<br>
20. On an upper side of rectangular chamber 100 an aperture is provided to which<br>
circular waveguide 50 is attached. Interior to interface 25, opposite to conventional<br>
waveguide 20, there is provided a beam stop 115 completely filling an opening, and<br><br>
having a tapered face, preferably at an angle of 30 degrees to vertical, at 120. It will be<br>
appreciated that interface 25 may be modified by those of skill in the art by alternative<br>
designs to minimize reflection and loss at the interface between circular waveguide 50<br>
and conventional waveguide 20. In Figs. 3-4, it may be seen that circular waveguide 50<br>
includes a probe flange 107 at an upper end thereof which has therein an opening for a<br>
probe at 110. A Hall probe may be inserted at 110.<br>
[0040] Figure 5 is a side view depicting an exemplary arrangement including<br>
circular waveguide 50, holder or mount 60, and related exemplary hardware. Holder or<br>
mount 60 serves to position a sheet material item to receive microwave power from<br>
circular waveguide 50. Conventional waveguide 20 is shown coupled to interface 25.<br>
Interface 25 is shown coupled to circular waveguide 50. Probe flange 107, located at an<br>
end of circular waveguide 50 opposite the coupling to interface 25, is opposite holder 60,<br>
in the form of a vacuum chuck. Vacuum chuck 60 is supported by an arm, which is<br>
chuck holder 62. Chuck holder 62 is supported by adjustable screws 121, 122, thereby<br>
permitting adjustment of the position of vacuum chuck 60 in two axes. Screws 121, 122<br>
are supported on bridge 124, which is itself adjustably mounted as shown at 125, 126.<br>
Spring 123 may be provided on screw 122 to reduce the transfer of any vibrations in<br>
bridge 124. It will be understood that other configurations may be employed for the<br>
positioning of holder 60 relative to circular waveguide 50.<br>
[0041] Referring to Fig. 5A, an example of a holder is shown. In this example, a<br>
positioning fixture 500 is rotatably mounted on a base 502. Fixture 500 has therein a<br>
rotatable disc 504 with a cylindrical through bore positioned off center. Disc 504 can be<br>
described as an eccentric slug in fixture 500. More particularly, fixture 500 has a surface<br>
501, which is generally planar, and disc 504 has a surface 505, which may be planar and<br>
raised from mount surface 501. Mount surface 501 and disc surface 505 may be parallel.<br>
Disc 504 is rotatable about an axis substantially perpendicular to the plane of mount<br>
surface 501. Bore 506, which may define a right circular cylinder, is not coaxial with the<br>
axis of rotation of disc 504. Rotation of disc 504 adjusts the position of the bore 506<br>
relative to base 502, effectively permitting adjustment of bore 506 in the vertical<br>
direction. Bore 506 defines the portion of a wafer or other material fixed on fixture 500<br>
exposed to the output of circular waveguide 50. Rotation of disc 504 permits vertical<br>
adjustment, which combined with horizontal adjustment using screw 520 as described<br><br>
below, provides for alignment with waveguide 50. Fixture 500 may be a vacuum fixture<br>
or vacuum chuck, having an interior chamber at low pressure and small bores therein to<br>
fix material on the fixture. Connections can be made to a pump through a port at 507.<br>
Handle 510 may be employed to move fixture 500 in and out of position.<br>
[0042] Fixture 500 is rotatably mounted on base 502 by a set screw 520 which<br>
presses on a shaft extends through bores in raised mounts 522, 524, which are rigidly<br>
fixed to base 502. A thrust bearing and a compression spring at mount 524 hold fixture<br>
500 in place. Screw 520 engages a threaded bore in mount 522, so that rotation of screw<br>
520 moves the shaft, thereby permitting fine adjustment of the position of the positioning<br>
fixture in a horizontal axis. In operation, the position of the fixture is adjusted by<br>
adjustment of both screw 520 and turning disc 504 until the fixture is properly positioned.<br>
The fixture 500 may then be locked in place. Arm 530, also rigidly fixed to base 502,<br>
prevents rotation of fixture 500 beyond a predefined point. An approximately semi-<br>
cylindrical concave surface defined on finger 532 of arm 530 receives a cylindrical knob<br>
507 on an edge of fixture 500. Referring to Fig. 5B, fixture 500 is shown in a closed or<br>
operational position from the opposite side.<br>
[0043] Referring to Fig. 5C, base 502 is divided into stationary portion 540 and<br>
movable portion 542, on which fixture 500 is mounted. Movable portion 542 is movable<br>
relative to stationary portion 540 perpendicular to the axis of screw 520, thereby<br>
permitting adjustment of the position of fixture 500 so as to adjust the gap between<br>
fixture 500 (and hence any sample mounted thereon) and the opening of circular<br>
waveguide 50. In this embodiment, mating grooves 543 and rails 544, and mating pins<br>
548 and bores 549, permit adjustment of movable portion 542 in only one direction. A<br>
threaded pin 550 has a head 551 which engages a surface of movable portion 542; body<br>
552 of pin 550 traverses a smooth bore 554 in movable portion 542 and engages a<br>
threaded bore 556 in stationary portion 540. A constant separation is further maintained<br>
by providing a device to urge movable portion 542 to the maximum separation permitted<br>
by the position of pin 550. An example is shown as coil spring 558, which engages<br>
surfaces of movable portion 542 and stationary portion 540. Any suitable substitute for<br>
coil spring 558 may be employed.<br><br>
[0044] Referring again to Fig. 5, Figure 5 also shows generally the position of<br>
magnet 130 which provides the necessary magnetic field. The magnetic field is applied<br>
perpendicular to the plane of the wafer or other sample and along the long axis of circular<br>
waveguide 50. The design of one or more suitable magnets to provide the desired<br>
magnetic field strength is within the level of ordinary skill in the art. As noted below, in<br>
one example, the magnetic field strength at the wafer or other item positioned in the<br>
holder is desirably up to 10kG or higher, if necessary.<br>
[0045] The calibration and operation of the apparatus will now be discussed. This<br>
entire process may be carried out at room temperature. Room temperature is understood<br>
to include a range of temperatures at which humans may comfortably work. Room .<br>
temperature excludes low temperatures, such as the boiling temperature of liquid nitrogen<br>
at atmospheric pressure. Power meters are preferably connected to the Hall detector cable,<br>
an input or forward power location, and a reflected power location. A gauss meter is<br>
provided to measure the intensity of the magnetic field. Commercial meters with RS232<br>
or IEEE 488 bus communications are preferably used. A short 58, such as a gold plated<br>
copper coated PC board, is placed on the vacuum chuck and positioned. The computer<br>
controlled attenuation adjustment 35 is increased to a maximum. The position of the<br>
circular waveguide 50 is adjusted to obtain minimum power at Hall detector 95. While<br>
monitoring the Hall detector power meter, the computer controlled attenuation adjustment<br>
35 is then adjusted, preferably automatically using the computer software, to bring<br>
detected power to a minimum. The computer controlled phase adjustment 40 is then<br>
adjusted, preferably automatically using the computer software, to obtain a minimum on<br>
the Hall detected power. The attenuation adjustment and phase adjustment are<br>
automatically adjusted using the computer software, to obtain a minimum here. The Hall<br>
detector power, forward detector power, and reflected detector power are recorded. The<br>
short is removed and replaced with the sample to be checked. The short tuning<br>
adjustment 65 of the vacuum chuck position is adjusted to obtain a minimum reflected<br>
power. The circular waveguide adjustment 55, attenuation adjustment 35 and phase<br>
adjustment 40 are all adjusted for a minimum on the Hall detector. The three powers are<br>
then recorded for 0 magnetic field, and then at successive incrementally greater magnetic<br>
field strengths. The field strength ranges from 0-9 kG as a minimum. Preferably, the<br>
magnetic field is automatically varied using computer software that controls the magnet<br>
power supply to obtain the desired magnetic field. In principle, with further<br><br>
developments, significantly lower magnetic field strengths could be used in accordance<br>
with the method. The number of magnetic field values and the spacing between magnetic<br>
field values can be optimized to maximize analysis accuracy.<br>
[0046] The data are then interpreted to obtain mobility, sheet charge density and<br>
sheet resistance readings. Referring to Figure 6, an overview of the software is provided.<br>
The software may be written for a personal computer using an Intel Pentium or<br>
compatible chip as a processor, and the DOS or Windows operating systems. The<br>
hardware system described above is indicated generally by block 600. The first module,<br>
605, is a signal acquisition and control module. This module receives signals from the<br>
detectors in the apparatus described above and controls the variable phase shifter and<br>
attenuator module as well as the magnet. The received signals are: Hall Power detection;<br>
Forward Power detection of Cu Short and Wafer; Reflected Power detection of Cu Short<br>
and Wafer; and Magnetic Field Strength detection. Those signals are passed through<br>
power amplifiers and/or superhet receivers to analog to digital converters and module 605<br>
obtains values from the digital output. Once these signals are acquired the corresponding<br>
voltage input values are passed on to the Signal Correlation Module 610 for further<br>
processing.<br>
[0047] Signal correlation module 610 receives inputs from the signal acquisition<br>
module 605 as raw input voltages. These voltages are input into algorithms to obtain<br>
values in correct engineering units. This step is a straightforward correlation.<br>
[0048] The output of the signal correlation module 610 is received by the<br>
transformation module 615. The transformation module converts the output to Sigma<br>
Output file structure 625 which is then read by the Mobility Spectral Analysis Module<br>
630. The Sigma Output file is composed of 14 lines of general test information, typically<br>
including the sample name, date, and similar information, followed by a line containing<br>
the sample thickness, followed by a line for each magnetic field at which Hall data was<br>
collected. Each of these data lines contain tab-separated entries for the magnetic field,<br>
Sigma_XX, SD_XX, Sigma_XY, and SD_XY, where SD_XX and SD_XY are the<br>
standard deviations for the Sigma_XX and Sigma_XY values, respectively. All entries<br>
are in MKSA units, i.e. thickness in meters, magnetic field in Tesla, and conductivities in<br>
Siemens/meter. This file is used as input for the Mobility Spectral Analysis Module in<br><br>
order to obtain the final mobility values and sheet charge densities. This module is<br>
composed of two separate program dynamic link libraries, which perform a variety of<br>
mathematical calculations in order to analyze magnetic field-dependent Hall data. These<br>
modules read input data from the Sigma Output file and generate a mobility spectrum<br>
output file 635 which includes a mobility spectrum whose peaks indicate the presence of<br>
discrete carrier types and a Multi-Carrier-Fit file 640 which includes the most likely<br>
mobility and sheet charge density values for those carrier types.<br>
[0049] The only way to find solutions that are more precise or quantitative than<br>
the mobility spectrum peaks is to restrict the range of possible solutions by making<br>
assumptions about the carriers in the specimen. For example, the Multi-Carrier fitting<br>
technique makes the explicit assumption that there are a fixed number of carriers - each<br>
with a discrete mobility.<br>
[0050] The calculations carried out by the software involve the following<br>
principles. When the microwave short at the back of the cavity behind the wafer is<br>
adjusted to the proper distance, the relationship between an amplitude reflection<br>
coefficient T, the sheet resistance of the wafer R, and the impedance Z of the circular<br>
waveguide for the TE11 mode is:<br>
[0051] r.= (R-Z)/(R + Z)<br>
[0052] For a circular waveguide of radius 1.045 cm, the impedance has been<br>
found to be 697.5 Ohm/square, which enables accurate measurement of a thin cap.<br>
[0053] The microwave electric field at the wafer must be determined. The<br>
electric field amplitude in various axes, Ex, for example, are represented as Ex - (l + T)<br>
(Pinddent/A)1/2, and Ey = (PHVA)1/2. In the x direction, the amplitude is the sum of the<br>
incident and reflected wave amplitudes or the amplitude of the transmitted (standing)<br>
wave. For the y direction,, the only propagating microwave signal is the Hall wave, which<br>
is generated at the wafer and detected in the reflected direction. The value A is a<br>
constant, which may be determined by integration across the circular cross section of the<br>
waveguide mode. The conductivity, ffn , or a^, depending on the axis, can be<br>
represented, using these values, as a^ = (1/Z) (1 - T1 - F2)/((l +T)2 + F2), and as axy = (F/<br>
(2Z(1 + f)) ((1 + T) (3 - T) - F2)/((l + T )2 + F2), where F = E"yi/E+Xi. There is also a<br><br>
constant coefficient used to multiply the theoretical values of F since the currents that are<br>
locally perpendicular to the excited TE11 mode do not couple exactly to the orthogonal TE11 mode. The constant can be obtained by integration and has a value between 0 and 1.<br>
The previous analysis assumes that additional modes that are generated near the wafer are<br>
negligible. In some cases that is not valid. For those cases, a multi-mode analysis has<br>
been developed and can be used to determine Sigma_XX and Sigma_XY from the<br>
reflected microwave powers.<br>
[0054] In order to obtain the mobility, the results of the calculations above are<br>
employed together with the detected magnetic field intensity B. For one carrier species in<br>
a single conductive layer, the carrier mobility is given by p. = (oVByCxx.<br>
[0055] The multi-carrier fitting procedure works as follows: First, the program<br>
determines the best fit for a single carrier using the Simplex method to minimize the<br>
least-squares deviation between the fitted and measured Hall data (Ci* and a^). The<br>
uncertainty in each of the measured data is used to weight the terms in the least-squares<br>
sum and thereby obtain the most-likely solution. The uncertainties in the derived mobility<br>
and carrier density are estimated from the components of the Hessian matrix at the<br>
minimum (at the solution).<br>
[0056] Next, the program determines the best fit using two carriers. The starting<br>
values for the Simplex procedure are obtained by displacing the previously-determined<br>
single carrier to slightly higher and lower mobilities. The Simplex procedure is identical<br>
to the procedure for a single carrier, except that there are now two mobilities to vary. The<br>
uncertainties in the derived parameters are again determined as in the description for a<br>
single carrier. The program also uses the statistical F-test to estimate the significance of<br>
the second carrier, i.e., it estimates whether addition of the second carrier improved the fit<br>
by enough to conclude that a second carrier probably exists. This is a very useful feature<br>
since it permits the user to estimate the number of statistically significant carriers that are<br>
present in the sample. The procedure continues, adding one carrier at a time and<br>
estimating the significance of the added carriers, until the number of carriers exceeds half<br>
the number of magnetic fields, at which point the procedure is terminated.<br><br>
[0057] A summary of test results comparing the foregoing techniques to known<br>
destructive techniques, namely the contacted single magnetic field DC Hall technique, are<br>
set forth below:<br><br><br><br>
[0058] Analysis software may be provided for use in non destructive, noncontact<br>
measurements of full semiconductor wafers or flat panel display materials for use by<br>
operators with minimal training. Experienced researchers are provided with the capability<br>
to perform in depth studies by varying readily accessible test parameters. Such test<br>
parameters include the magnet field strength, and attenuation of the microwave signal<br>
along the branch. The software also may provide graphic display including plots of the<br>
mobility spectra with conductivity and concentration as a function of mobility.<br>
[0059] Plots of sheet charge density and mobility as a function of magnetic field<br>
may be displayed using a single carrier solution to the data of each field. The single<br>
carrier solution is used as a general check of the analysis; a sample with a single carrier<br>
should exhibit the same sheet charge density and mobility irrespective of the magnetic<br>
field. Conversely, a sample with more than one detectable carrier should exhibit<br>
variations as a function of the magnetic field.<br>
[0060] All results may be displayed as sheet concentration numbers in the text<br>
window of the software. A calculation of the volumetric concentration of electrical<br>
carriers could be launched by checking the window of the result-screen of the software. If<br>
this operation is selected, the one-carrier solution is extracted by the multi-carrier<br>
technique and displayed in a separate window together with the entry fields for layer<br>
thickness and carrier type. This information is then used to calculate the depletion widths<br>
from the top surface and epi-substrate interfaces, so that the true thickness of the<br>
conductive layer can be obtained. Alternatively, the user could enter a thickness and have<br><br>
the program present the volumetric results for the one- or many-carrier fit based on the<br>
entered thickness.<br>
[0061] It should be noted that single field analysis techniques may be used as an<br>
alternative to multi-carrier analysis described above.<br>
[0062] It will be appreciated that variations in mobility and sheet charge density<br>
across a layer may be obtained by conducting a test on a sample, then moving the sample<br>
in the mount in the plane perpendicular to the central axis of circular waveguide 50, and<br>
then repeating the test. This process may be repeated in order to obtain a map of mobility<br>
and sheet charge density.<br>
Automatic Mapping Subsystem<br>
[0063] Fig. 7 illustrates a subsystem for use with the apparatus described in<br>
relation to Figs. 1-5C, and which can be used to automate the wafer or flat panel mobility<br>
mapping process. This automatic mobility mapping subsystem (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"the automapper") 700, can be mounted inside and/or on top of a system cabinet 702.<br>
Fig. 8 shows the automapper cabinet 702 positioned and attached to the mobility mapping<br>
system of Figs. 1-5C. As will be appreciated, the automapper 700 can be provided as an<br>
upgrade to current mobility mapping systems, or as an integrated option for new units to<br>
be built.<br>
[0064] Fig. 9 shows the main components of the automapper 700, including a<br>
rotator/lifter 704, an end effector 706, a servo motor 708 for rotating the end-effector<br>
about its longitudinal axis, an x-axis table 710, and a servo motor 712 for adjusting the x-<br>
axis table. Not shown are the servo motors that will operate the rotator/lifter 704. The<br>
rotator/lifter 704 will lift and rotate the wafer 59 to be tested. The end effector 706 will<br>
hold the wafer 59 under test, and the servo motor 708 associated with the end effector 706<br>
will rotate the end effector (and wafer) to the desired vertical orientation so that the wafer<br>
can be inserted into the test area.<br>
[0065] Fig. 10 is a detail view of the wafer 59 mounted on the end effector 706<br>
using a pair of alignment pins 714. An operator would load a wafer 59 to be tested onto<br>
the end effector 706 using the alignment pins 714 positioned to receive the particular size<br>
wafer to be tested. A plurality of different pin locations corresponding to different wafer<br><br>
sizes would be provided to allow the user to easily establish the wafer on the end effector<br>
at the proper position for testing. Once the wafer 59 is positioned on the end effector 706,<br>
the operator will initiate a computer-controlled automated testing program, which will<br>
automatically turn on vacuum elements 707 (Fig. 18)) located on the end effector 706 to<br>
hold the wafer 56 in place during testing.<br>
[0066] Fig. 11 shows how the servo motor 708 is used to rotate the end effector<br>
706 and the wafer 59 90-degrees to assume a desired vertical position for testing. Once<br>
this vertical position is achieved, the servo motor 712 associated with the x-table 710 will<br>
operate to move the end effector 706 and wafer 59 along the x-axis into a test position<br>
(Fig. 12), between the poles of the magnet 713 of the mobility mapping system of Figs.<br>
1-5C. This is the test position. The computerized testing program will control<br>
performance of the desired mobility testing and the collection of data points needed to<br>
complete the mobility map, in the manner previously described in relation to Figs. 1-6.<br>
[0067] After the series of data points is collected, the wafer is withdrawn from the<br>
magnet 130 and is rotated back to its horizontal position, using the servo motor 708<br>
associated with the end effector 706, as shown in Fig. 13. At this point, the rotator/lifter<br>
704 assembly will raise up to engage the wafer 59. The rotator/lifter will engage the<br>
wafer using one or more vacuum elements (not shown) and will rotate the wafer to<br>
change the wafer's theta angle (the angle at which a particular set of data scans will<br>
occur), preparing the wafer for collection of another series of test data points in the<br>
manner already described. Thus, once the appropriate theta angle has been achieved, the<br>
rotator/lifter 704 will lower the wafer back down onto the end effector 708, the vacuum<br>
elements of the end effector will be actuated, and the end effector and wafer will again be<br>
rotated 90-degrees. The end effector and wafer will again be moved between the poles of<br>
the magnet 130 and the desired series of data points collected for the new theta angle<br>
position. This test process of will be repeated until the desired number of data points are<br>
collected for the wafer under test. In one embodiment, a complete mobility map of the<br>
wafer will be obtained using this technique.<br>
[0068] As previously noted, all of the above steps can be automated and<br>
controlled using an appropriate computer program.<br><br>
Sheet Resistance Subsystem<br>
[0069] Fig. 14 shows the automapper subsystem of Figs. 7-13, attached to the<br>
mobility measuring system of Figs. 1-5C, in combination with an additional subsystem<br>
feature for automatically measuring the sheet resistance of a wafer. Fig. 15 illustrates the<br>
main components of the combined automapper and sheet resistance module subsystems,<br>
including a pair of end effectors 706, 716, a servo motor 708 for controlling rotation of<br>
both end effectors about their longitudinal axis, and a sheet resistance module 718. A<br>
sliding table 710 is provided for moving the end effectors along an x-axis plane in<br>
relation to the mobility measuring system and the sheet resistance module 718. The end<br>
effectors 706, 716 and servo motor 708 will be mounted on the sliding table 710, and the<br>
sheet resistance module 718 will remain stationary. Not shown is the servo motor that<br>
will operate the Rotator/Lifter 704.<br>
[0070] The sheet resistance module 718 can have a pair of opposing coils 720,<br>
722 (Fig. 16) used to measure the resistance of the wafer 59 or other appropriate sheet<br>
material (e.g. flat panel) placed therebetween. The principles of operation of the sheet<br>
resistance module 718, as well as details of the design, are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
6,711,948 B2, issued 3/30/2004, and 6,443,002 B2, issued 9/3/2002, assigned to<br>
Lehighton Electronics, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
[0071] The automapper of this embodiment will be configured and will operate in<br>
the same manner as described above in relation to Figs. 7-13.<br>
[0072] Fig. 16 shows the sheet resistance module 718 in greater detail, illustrating<br>
the position of the upper and lower measurement coils 720, 722, between which a wafer<br>
or sheet 59 will be inserted for testing using the end effector 716 and associated<br>
components.<br>
[0073] Fig. 17 shows an exemplary wafer 59 positioned on the end effector 716<br>
associated with the sheet resistance module 718 prior to being inserted into the module<br>
for testing. Fig. 18 shows the wafer 59 positioned within the sheet resistance module<br>
718 for testing. To achieve this positioning, the system operator will position the wafer<br>
59 on the end effector 716 using positioning pins (not shown) similar to those used for<br>
end effector 708. The operator will then initiate a computer program configured to<br><br>
control movement of the end effector 716 along the x-direction with respect to the sheet<br>
resistance module 718. The program will automatically turn on the vacuum elements 724<br>
(Fig. 15) of the end effector 716 to hold the wafer 59 in place. The program will then<br>
cause the end effector 716 to slide along the x-axis (by operation of servo motor 712) to<br>
place the wafer within the sheet resistance module 718. Thus, the wafer will be moved<br>
between the coils 720, 722 to a plurality of testing locations along the x-axis to take the<br>
desired series of sheet resistance measurements.<br>
[0074] Fig. 19 shows the wafer 59 withdrawn from the sheet resistance module<br>
718 after taking a first series of test measurements. The rotator/lifter 704 is positioned to<br>
engage the wafer, to raise it up off the end effector and to rotate it to change the theta<br>
angle. Once the desired new theta angle is achieved, the rotator/lifter 704 sets the wafer<br>
back down onto the end effector 716, the vacuum elements 724 will be reactivated to lock<br>
the wafer to the end effector, and the x-table servo motor 712 will be used to re-insert the<br>
wafer 59 into the sheet resistance module 718 in the manner previously described to<br>
collect another series of data points associated with the new theta angle. This process will<br>
be re-performed until the sheet resistance mapping is complete. It will be appreciated that<br>
all of these steps can be automated and controlled using an appropriate computer<br>
program.<br>
[0075] While the invention has been described above with respect to particular<br>
embodiments, modifications and substitutions within the spirit and scope of the invention<br>
will be apparent to those of skill in the art.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
Device And Handling System For Measurement Of Mobility<br>
And Sheet Charge Density In Conductive Sheet Materials <br>
An apparatus (10) for contactless measurement of sheet charge density and mobility<br>
comprises a microwave source (16), a circular waveguide (50), a first detector (18) for<br>
detecting the forward microwave power, a second detector (23) for detecting the microwave<br>
