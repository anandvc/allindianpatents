				<td>METHOD FOR PROMOTING HAIR, NAIL, AND SKIN<br>
KERATINIZATION<br>
The present method relates to the field of dermatology and more<br>
specifically relates to a method for promoting the kerainization of hair,<br>
nails, and skin of an animal or human.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
For centuries, humans have been preoccupied with the length,<br>
thickness, color, and quantity of hair. Hair thinning, receding hairlines,,<br>
and hair loss can detrimentally affect appearance and self-image and can ,<br>
even result in significant emotional consequences.<br>
Hair is a cylinder of keratinized cells protruding from a hair follicle<br>
that anchors the hair in the skin. All hair follicles in mammals have the same<br>
basic structure. Hair follicles in an adult human are generally arranged in<br>
groups of three. No new follicles are created or destroyed after birth,<br>
however, the type of hair produced by a given follicle can change. Most of<br>
the hairs on the scalp are terminal hairs, which are the coarse, pigmented,<br>
long hairs in which the bulb of the hair follicle is seated deep in the dermis.<br>
The short, fine hairs found on the scalp and elsewhere on the body are<br>
vellus hairs. Vellus hairs are non-pigmented and unmedullated, having the<br>
hair bulb located superficially in the dermis.<br>
In humans, each hair follicle goes through repeated cyclical periods<br>
of growth including an active growth stage (anagen), which can persist for<br>
approximately 2 to 6 years; a transition phase (catagen), which lasts for only<br>
a week or two; and a resting period (telogen), which lasts 3 to 4 months.<br>
The hair is shed at the end of the telogen phase, and a new hair is grown as<br>
the cycle repeats. In the human scalp, which contains approximately<br>
100,000 hair follicles, normally about 86% are in anagen, 1% are in catagen<br>
and 13% are in telogen. Therefore, in a normal human adult, approximately<br>
100 hairs are shed from the scalp per day.<br>
Excessive hair loss, or alopecia, may be classified as being one of<br>
two types, non-scarring alopecia and scarring alopecia, and can be caused<br>
by a wide variety of factors. For example, non-scarring alopecia has. been<br>
attributed to genetics and advanced age; administration of drugs such as<br>
anti-cancer chemotherapeutic, drugs and contraceptives; topical use of<br>
chemical treatments, such as hair dyes, permanent wave solutions, and<br>
straighteners; diseases, such as leprosy or syphilis; illness; allergy; and hair<br>
follicle infection. Scarring alopecia may be a consequence of burns<br>
(accidental or post surgical from cryosurgery or laser surgery) or trauma,<br>
which often causes follicle destruction. Therefore, humans and other<br>
animals exhibiting scarring alopecia may lack hair follicles in the region<br>
devoid of hair, whereas those with non-scarring alopecia possess hair<br>
follicles with short, fine, translucent hairs.<br>
The most common type of human hair loss is androgenic alopecia<br>
(also known as androgenetic alopecia), which is a non-scarring hair loss of<br>
telogen hairs caused by an excessive androgen effect in genetically<br>
susceptible men and women. Androgens trigger the miniaturization or<br>
atrophy of terminal follicles that normally produce thick scalp hair and<br>
transforms them into vellus-like follicles, eventually yielding fine, downy<br>
hair that is barely perceptible. Androgenic alopecia is expressed in males as<br>
baldness of the vertex of the scalp and is commonly referred to as male<br>
pattern baldness. In females, androgenic alopecia appears as diffuse hair<br>
loss or thinning of the frontoparietal areas. As alopecia progresses with<br>
age, hairs in these predisposed areas miniaturize and appear to change from<br>
terminal hairs to resemble vellus hairs. In addition, as androgenic alopecia<br>
continues, the number of hairs in the active growth anagen phase decreases<br>
while there is an increase the number of hairs in the telogen phase.<br>
Telogen effluvium is a type of non-scarring alopecia in which the<br>
anagen hairs prematurely move into the telogen phase. One most easily<br>
recognizable cause of telogen effluvium is the postpartum state in humans<br>
and other mammals. In the postpartum period, an increased number of<br>
hairs go into telogen due to the physical stress or hormonal changes<br>
associated with delivery., Three to four months later, there is considerable,<br>
but usually temporary hairloss. The hair usually returns to its normal state<br>
in six to twelve months. Other causes of telogen effluvium in humans and<br>
other mammals include physical stress and systemic illness, psychological<br>
stress caused by major life events such as a family death or divorce, medical<br>
nutritional deficiencies (kwashiorkor), or absolute calorie deprivation<br>
(marasmus, crash diets), vitamin and trace element deficiencies (zinc,<br>
biotin, essential fatty acids, and iron), and endocrine abnormalities<br>
(hypothyroidism, hyperadrenalcorticalism, hyperprolactinemia and<br>
adrenogenital syndrome).<br>
Numerous remedies for hair loss have been attempted ranging from<br>
wigs, toupees, and other hairpieces to the oral or topical administration of<br>
hair growth solutions. No known cure has been discovered, even though<br>
many attempts have been made. Hair transplantation is one method of<br>
treatment that has shown some success. Single hairs or plugs of thick,<br>
growing hair are transplanted from one region of the scalp to the site of hair<br>
loss. This method is very expensive, time consuming and painful. Other<br>
hair growth stimulation methods, including ultra-violet radiation, scalp<br>
massage, revascularization surgery and acupuncture, have been tried with<br>
minimal or a total lack of success. The pharmaceutical drug minoxidil (2%,<br>
known commercially as Rogaine®, Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, MI),<br>
originally discovered as a vasodilator for the treatment of severe<br>
hypertension, has been found to be somewhat useful as a hair growth<br>
stimulant in humans with androgenic alopecia. However, the drug has<br>
exhibited adverse effects. When taken orally, minoxidil has serious<br>
cardiovascular side effects such as fluid retention, tachycardia, and<br>
increased frequency of angina or new onset of angina, especially in persons<br>
with poor coronary circulation. Fluid retention can lead to weight gain,<br>
edema, heart failure and pleural or pericardial effusion. Although topical<br>
administration of minoxidil has fewer side effects, at least four months of<br>
continuous topical applications twice daily are required before partial<br>
reversal of follicular miniaturization may be observed, resulting in larger,<br>
more pigmented hairs and less hair shedding, giving the appearance of hair<br>
growth.<br>
Hair or fur loss is also prevalent in wild and domesticated animals,<br>
especially mammals. Although animals are not psychologically impacted by<br>
their loss of fur or coat, their owners often are. In addition, fur loss in<br>
animals whose fur is sheared or otherwise used commercially may cause fur<br>
producers to suffer economically. Animal fur or hair loss has been<br>
attributed to many factors including disease, diet, metabolic disorders,<br>
insect bites, follicle infection, allergies, and hot spots or other hair or fur<br>
erosions caused by excessive biting, chewing and scratching. Currently,<br>
the only way to combat hair loss in animals is to attempt to remove the<br>
underlying disorder or restrain the animal to prevent access to the hair loss<br>
site. Oftentimes the disorder is successfully treated, but the fur is not<br>
completely restored.<br>
Fingernails and toenails in humans and primates and their<br>
corresponding claws, hooves, horns and antlers in animals are composed of<br>
differently keratinizing cells. Human nails have lost most of their functional<br>
significance but remain important for cosmetic reasons. Animals use their<br>
claws, hooves, horns and antlers as weapons, tools and outward signs of<br>
dominance. Nail disorders range from premature breakage or roughness of<br>
the portion of the nail extending from the tip of the digit to total loss or<br>
destruction of the nail plate. For example, nail breakage caused by the<br>
splitting and resultant flaking of nails into layers horizontal to the<br>
longitudinal nail plate surface, referred to as onychoschizia, is caused by<br>
abnormal keratinization.<br>
Nail disorders can also be caused by advanced age; infection from<br>
bacteria, fungi, yeast or mites (scabies); trauma; congenital or hereditary<br>
defects; hyperplasias such as warts, lesions, cysts and tumors; constant<br>
wetting of the hand or foot; psoriasis; disease states such as Darier"s<br>
disease, Lichen planus, Alopecia areata, and twenty-nail dystrophy; contact<br>
irritation or allergy to chemicals such as those contained in nail polish,<br>
hardeners or adhesives; metabolic disorders, such as thyroid dysfunction;<br>
circulatory disorders; arthritis; Periungual telangiectasia, commonly<br>
observed in dermatomyositis patients and lupus erythematosus patients; and<br>
pharmaceutical or illicit drug use.<br>
Skin is the ultimate barrier against infection. Patients suffering from<br>
burns or other trauma to the skin are at extreme risk for disease caused by<br>
microorganisms. Skin grafting procedures have been used in some<br>
circumstances, however, limited success has been achieved due to graft<br>
rejection or insufficient skin growth to cover the injured area. A method for<br>
promoting in vitro autologous, epidermal cell propagation or enhancing in<br>
vivo skin growth or wound healing would be extremely useful for replacing<br>
the skin barrier prior to the onset of life-threatening infection.<br>
The disadvantages of the hair loss, nail claw, hoof, horn and antler<br>
disorders, and skin replacement treatments currently available are that they<br>
can be expensive, may cause adverse side-effects, and are not always<br>
effective forall patienls. Therefore, there is an on-going need for<br>
development of new methods for treating hair or fur loss, nail,claw, hoof,<br>
horn or antler disorders, and skin replacement or wound healing in humans<br>
and ammals.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A method for promoting keratinization on the body of an animal or<br>
human is described. In accordance with the method, a therapeutic amount<br>
of a benzimidazole composition sufficient to cause keratinization of the hair,<br>
nails or skin is administered. Administration may be either systemically or<br>
directly to the site on the body at which keratinization is desired.<br>
The method is useful for the treatment of a wide variety of hair or<br>
fur loss disorders in humans and animals caused by a wide variety of<br>
diseases and disorders, particularly androgenic alopecia and telogen<br>
effluvium. In addition, the method is useful for normalizing keratinization<br>
in humans and animals with abnormal keratinization processes that manifest<br>
themselves visibly as fingernails, toenails, claws or hooves that are soft,<br>
easily bent and broken, frayed, split, or deformed in shape. The method is<br>
also useful for enhancing the strength and length of normal nails, for<br>
enhancing wound healing or skin grafting by promoting the propagation of<br>
epidermal cells, and to combat cutaneous fungal infections, particularly<br>
fungal infections of the nails and skin.<br>
A benzimidazole is a compound containing a bicyclic ring structure<br>
in which benzene is fused to the 4- and 5- positions pf an imidazole and<br>
includes benzimidazoles, benzimidazole carbamates and benzimidazole<br>
prodrugs. Benzimidazole prodrugs include phenylguanidines such as, but<br>
not limited to, fenbantel, netobimin and thiophanate. Preferred<br>
benzimidazole carbamates for use in the present method include, but are not<br>
limited to, thiabendazole, albendazole, flubendazole, mebendazole,<br>
ciclobendazole, parbendazole, oxibendazole, fenbendazole, and metabolites,<br>
such as fenbendazole sulfone, and derivatives thereof. The most preferred<br>
benzimidazoles are fenbendazole, fenbendazole prodrugs, and the sulfoxide<br>
metabolites of fenbendazole, such as oxfendazole (fenbendazole sulfoxide).<br>
The benzimidazole compound is combined with an appropriate<br>
carrier or solvent to provide a benzimidazole composition. A preferred<br>
carrier is a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A most preferred carrier is a<br>
hair or nail cleansing, treatment, or cosmetic product such as shampoo or<br>
nail polish remover. The benzimidazole compound is prepared in granular,<br>
crystalline, powder, or amorphous form. The amorphous, stabilized<br>
benzimidazoles and their metabolites and derivatives are especially preferred<br>
because they are more highly soluble, bioavailable, and efficacious than<br>
crystalline benzimidazole. The benzimidazole composition is given <br>
systemically, preferably by oral administration, or is given locally by<br>
injection or topical application for parenteral absorption. The preferred <br>
method of administration is topical.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a safe,<br>
inexpensive, and painless method for the treatment of hair loss,<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method for<br>
the prevention or minimization of hair loss.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method for<br>
strengthening fingernails and toenails.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method for<br>
strengthening animal claws, horns, hooves and antlers, especially the<br>
hooves of horses, particularly race horses.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method for<br>
promoting normal hair and nail growth.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method for<br>
promoting skin growth and wound healing.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method for<br>
treating fungal infections of the skin and nails.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a topical<br>
scalp treatment composition to minimize hair loss and a topical nail treatment<br>
composition to promote nail integrity.<br>
These and other objects of the present invention will become<br>
apparent after reading the following detailed description of the disclosed<br>
embodiments and the appended claims.<br>

Detailed Description of the Disclosed Embodiments<br>
A method for promoting keratinization on the body of an animal or<br>
human, particularly hair, nail, or skin keratinization, is provided. In<br>
accordance with the method, a therapeutic amount of a benzimidazole <br>
composition sufficient to cause keratinization is administered either <br>
systemically or directly to the site on the body at which keratinization is<br>
desired.<br>
Keratin is a scleroprotein or albuminoid found predominantly in<br>
epidermis cuticular structures such as hair, nails, and horns. The term<br>
"keratinization" as used herein is defined as keratin formation or growth of<br>
all keratinizing structures and includes, but is not limited to, skin re-<br>
epithelialization, especially after first or second degree burns of the skin on<br>
the body of humans and animals, hair growth and regrowth from existing<br>
hair follicles, both in length and thickness, and the cornification or growth,<br>
both longitudinally and in thickness, of fingernails, toenails, claws, horns,<br>
hooves, and antlers. Keratinization, or the promotion of keratinization,<br>
results in the production of thicker, stronger and longer keratin structures.<br>
The method does not cause the production of new hair follicles, but causes<br>
the growth of preexisting follicles wherein wherein miniaturized hairs become longer<br>
The term "hair growth" as defined herein includes the promotion and<br>
maintenance of normal active (anagen) hair growth following disruption of<br>
the hair growth cycle in any stage such as occurs when various<br>
chemotherapeutic drugs are administered or caused by telogen effluvium,<br>
conversion of hairs from vellus hairs to terminal hairs, an increase in hair<br>
shaft length, an increase in hair shaft diameter, an increase in hair shaft<br>
medullation, an increase in hair pigmentation, an increase in hair follicle<br>
length. The term "hair growth" further includes improved hair growth,<br>
enhanced hair growth, and restoration to normal hair growth.<br>
The term "animal" as used herein refers to both human, and non-<br>
human species, particularly mammals, and includes, but is not limited to,<br>
domestic, productive, and breeding animals such as dogs, cats, cattle and<br>
other ruminants, horses, sheep, goats, pigs, camels, alpacas, llamas, water<br>
buffalo, donkeys, rabbits, fallow deer, reindeer and similar mammals; pelt<br>
animals such as mink, foxes, chinchilla and raccoons; avian species or<br>
poultry such as chickens, geese, turkeys, pigeons, ducks, and ostriches;<br>
and animals such as reptiles and amphibians.<br>
The terms "keratinization composition" and "keratinization<br>
promoting composition" as used herein include human and veterinary<br>
pharmaceutical, treatment, cleansing, and cosmetic compositions for<br>
administration to humans or animals.<br>
Although not wishing to be bound by the following, a proposed<br>
mechanism of action of benzimidazoles to promote keratinization involves a<br>
blockage or interference with the effects of androgens, such as testosterone<br>
and its metabolites, on the epidermal cells of the outer root sheath of hair<br>
follicles, possibly by interactions such as inhibition of cytochrome P-450<br>
isozymes such as P-450IA1 in human keratinizing structures, and P-<br>
450IA1, P-450IIA1, and P-450IIB1 in rat keratinizing structures. It is<br>
believed that the benzimidazole effectively opposes a genetic predisposition<br>
for premature miniaturization of hair follicles occurring during alopecia,<br>
particularly androgenic alopecia. Therefore, the method described herein<br>
includes the administration of compounds having the functional<br>
characteristics of benzimidazoles, namely cytochrome P-450 isozymes<br>
inhibitors, to inhibit the adverse effects of androgens on hair growth, such<br>
as alopecia, particularly androgenic alopecia.<br>
The method is useful for the treatment of a wide variety of hair loss<br>
disorders in animals such as alopecia, including human androgenic alopecia<br>
of females and male pattern baldness; hair loss due to telogen effluvium,<br>
hair loss due to anti-cancer chemotherapy, oral or subcutaneous<br>
contraceptives and other drugs; hair loss due to topical chemical treatment,<br>
such as hair dyes, permanent wave solutions, and straighteners; and hair<br>
loss due to disease, such as leprosy or syphilis; illness; allergy; and hair<br>
follicle infection. The method is used either prior to anticipated hair loss,<br>
such as before or during the administration of anti-cancer chemotherapeutic<br>
drugs or after an observation or diagnosis of hair loss has been established.<br>
In addition, the method directly promotes faster, early onset of hair<br>
regrowth in humans or other mammals suffering from disorders such as<br>
telogen effluvium.<br>
The method is also useful for hair or fur loss disorders in animals<br>
caused by disease, diet, metabolic disorders, insect bites, infection of<br>
follicles, allergies, and hot spots or other hair or fur erosions caused by<br>
excessive biting, chewing and scratching. In addition, the method is useful<br>
for improving or enhancing the growth or thickness of normal hair or fur.<br>
Furthermore, the method is useful for enhancing, improving or<br>
restoring the normal strength, thickness, and length of normal, abnormal, or<br>
diseased nails, including fingernails and toenails in humans, and claws,<br>
horns, hooves and antlers in animals. Nails, defined herein to include<br>
fingernails, toenails, claws, horns, hooves and antlers, treated in<br>
accordance with the present method are less susceptible to bending,<br>
cracking, peeling and breaking. Therefore, the method is useful for the<br>
treatment of onychoschizia, also known as lamellar dystrophy, which is the<br>
horizontal separation of the corneocytes on the nail. The method is<br>
particularly useful for treating the hooves of horses, especially race horses,<br>
to enhance the strength and thickness of the hoof to prevent or inhibit<br>
cracking, breakage, and fissuring, and in addition to prevent pain and<br>
infection.<br>
Nails treated in accordance with the present method are also less<br>
likely to show pitting of their surfaces after treatment. Therefore, the<br>
method is useful for the treatment of psoriasis of the nail bed, which causes<br>
nail pitting and deformation. The administration of a benzimidazole for the<br>
treatment of psoriasis of the nail bed may be in combination with other<br>
psoriasis treatments, such as the administration of methotrexate. In cases of<br>
severe psoriatic onychodystrophy, the remaining keratinous matter is first<br>
removed, such as by applying 20% urea in a hydrolytic base. After the nail<br>
bed is cleared, corticosteroids may be administered in combination with the<br>
benzimidazole.<br>
By promoting normal to increased keratinization, the method<br>
described herein will allow a more economical product on of keratin<br>
products such as wool, hides, pelts and horns.<br>
The method is also useful to improve or enhance the rate or extent of<br>
wound healing by promoting the propagation of epidermal cells either in<br>
vivo or in vitro for subsequent transfer, or skin graft, to a patient suffering<br>
from a disorder such as trauma, burns, especially accident-induced burns,<br>
abraded skin, ulcers, congenital malformations, or surgery, in which large<br>
areas of skin must be generated. In addition, the method is useful for<br>
treating incised skin present from surgical procedures including incision by<br>
scalpel blades; vaporization of skin by various types of laser emitted energy,<br>
such as caused by laser surgery; necrotic skin secondary to cryosurgical<br>
procedures or ionizing radiation induced burns caused by an external beam<br>
such as cobalt radiation; or skin necrosis due implant radiation caused by<br>
cesium pellet implants.<br>
Techniques have been developed for skin replacement in which<br>
autologous epidermal cells are propagated in vitro and applied to the skin of<br>
the patient from whom the cells were harvested. Such techniques are<br>
known to those skilled in the art. For example, epidermal cells can be<br>
impregnated in a matrix, such as a collagen matrix, to produce skin of a<br>
predetermined size or shape to be used for skin grafting.<br>
The method described herein is additionally useful to combat<br>
cutaneous fungal infections, particularly fungal infections of the nails and<br>
skin such as dermatophytes and candidiasis by topical application of the<br>
benzimidazole composition to the nail or skin surface. Fungal infections,<br>
including fungal infections of the nails, are particularly prevalent in patients<br>
suffering from AIDS. The method demonstrates antifungal effects not only<br>
because benzimidazole compounds possess chemical fungicidal properties,<br>
but also because benzimidazoles promote keratinization, which allows<br>
outgrowth of the infected keratinized structure away from the body, thereby<br>
preventing or decreasing contact of the fungal elements with the newly<br>
developing keratinized structures on which the fungus depends for survival.<br>
Therefore, the promotion of keratinization contributes greatly to the<br>
fungistatic effect.<br>
Benzimidazole Compounds<br>
The term "benzimidazole" as used herein is a chemical compound<br>
containing a bicyclic ring structure in which benzene is fused to the 4- and<br>
5- positions of an imidazole and includes benzimidazoles, benzimidazole<br>
carbamates, benzimidazole prodrugs, benzimidazole derivatives, and<br>
benzimidazole metabolites. Phenylguanidines are specifically included as<br>
suitable benzimidazole prodrugs. Amorphous, crystalline and granular<br>
benzimidazole compositions are included in the present definition of the<br>
term "benzimidazole". Benzimidazoles having minimal toxic side effects are<br>
preferred. Carbamates and, in particular, benzimidazole carbamates are<br>
used and can be used in large dosages because they have exhibited a low <br>
incidence of side effects.<br>
The preferred benzimidazole compounds are benzimidazole <br>
anthelmintics. Anthelmintics are compounds useful for treating <br>
helminthiasis in humans and animals. The term "benzimidazole <br>
anthelmintic" is defined herein as any benzimidazole-containing agent<br>
known to act as a broad spectrum anthelmintic against endoparasites or<br>
nematodes such as ascarids, hookworms, whipworms, roundworms and<br>
kidneyworms. An analysis of the structure-activity relationships of<br>
numerous benzimidazole compounds is provided in the scientific article of<br>
Loewe and Urbanietz, Fenbendazole. I. Structure-Activity Relationships,<br>
Pestic. Sci. 8:544-549 (1977), which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The anthelmintic mechanism of action of benzimidazoles compounds<br>
appears to involve inhibition of the polymerization of tubulin into<br>
microtubules within various helminth species. It is understood that one<br>
skilled in the art would be able to screen benzimidazoles for anthelmintic<br>
activity, and thereby screen for keratinization promoting activity, using<br>
standard assays and techniques.<br>
The preferred benzimidazole compound for use in the present<br>
method includes, but is not limited, to, albendazple (SmithKline Beecham<br>
Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, PA), cambendazole (Merck/Univet,<br>
Rahway, NJ), ciclobendazole (Janssen/Cilag, Titusville, NJ), fenbendazole<br>
(Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet, Sommerville, NJ), flubendazole (Janssen,<br>
Titusville, NJ), luxabendazole (Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet, Sommerville,<br>
NJ), mebendazole (Janssen, Titusville, NJ), oxfendazole (Coopers/Syntex,<br>
Palo Alto, CA), triclabendazole (Ciba-Geigy, Summit, NJ), oxibendazole<br>
(SmithKline Beecham/Univet, Philadelphia, PA), parbendazole (SmithKline<br>
Beecham/Ciba-Geigy, Philadelphia, PA/Summit, NJ), ricobendazole<br>
(Robert Young &amp; Co., Wethersfield, CT), thiabendazole (Merck, Rahway,<br>
NJ), and metabolites, derivatives, and prodrugs thereof, including the<br>
prodrugs febantel (Coopers/Bayer, Shawnee Mission, KS), netobimin<br>
(Schering Corporation, Kenilworth, NJ), and thiophanate (Micro-<br>
Biologicals/RMB Animal Health). These benzimidazoles are or have been<br>
commercially available from the companies listed above in parentheses. The<br>
most preferred benzimidazoles are fenbendazole and prodrugs thereof; the<br>
sulfoxide metabolites of fenbendazole, such as oxfendazole; and the (4"<br>
hydroxyphenyl) thio metabolites of fenbendazole.<br>
Fenbendazole has been described in European Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 090,368 to Ganley et al. for administration to animals to<br>
treat helminthiasis. Ganley et al. state that fenbendazole is non-teratogenic<br>
and non-carcinogenic and therefore safely used in animals at any stage of<br>
pregnancy. In addition, Ganley et al. claim that the drug has no adverse<br>
effect on fertility, and can be used at the time of conception in the female<br>
and the breeding male mammal and has no toxic or teratogenic effects on<br>
embryos or developing fetuses. Ganley et al. further describe fenbendazole<br>
as having a very high safety margin and is non-toxic to the humans who are<br>
administering the drug to animals. According to Ganley et al, oxfendazole<br>
and albendazole have substantially the same spectrum of activity as<br>
fenbendazole, but a lower therapeutic index. In addition, in avian species,<br>
fenbendazole fails to depress egg production or hatchability indices.<br>

Benzimidazoles to be used in the present method for promoting<br>
keratinization may be obtained commercially or synthesized by conventional<br>
methods known in the art, such as by methods set forth in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
3,928,375 and 3,954,791, which are incorporated by reference herein and<br>
in the article by Townsend and Wise entitled "The Synthesis and Chemistry<br>
of Certain Anthelmintic Benzimidazoles", Parasitology Today 6:107-112<br>
(1990), which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Methods of Administration and Formulations<br>
The benzimidazole compound, in granular, crystalline, powder, or<br>
amorphous form, is provided in combination with a suitable solvent or<br>
carrier as a benzimidazole composition for administration to a human or<br>
animal. The benzimidazole composition is given systemically by oral<br>
administration or is given locally by injection or topical application for<br>
parenteral absorption. Topical application includes transdermal or<br>
percutaneous delivery such as by application of a percutaneous occlusive<br>
patch. The preferred method of administration is topical.<br>
Topical administration should be directed to the site where<br>
keratinization is most likely to occur. The site of keratinization in the skin is<br>
the epidermis. The site of keratinization in hair or fur is the follicle.<br>
Therefore, for topical treatment of alopecia, the benzimidazole composition<br>
should be applied to the bald regions of the scalp or skin. Topical treatment<br>
of nail disorders should be applied at the cuticle base of the nail to maximize<br>
drug concentration in the vicinity of the keratogenous zone, which lies<br>
beneath the lunula, or "white moon" shape at the base of the nail. The<br>
locations of these portions of the nail are well known to those skilled in the<br>
art and are described in dermatology texts such as on pages 557-559 of the<br>
dermatology text HANDBOOK OF NON-INVASIVE METHODS AND THE<br>
SKIN, J. Serup and G.B.E. Jemac, eds., CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL,<br>
1995.<br>
For topical administration, the benzimidazole, benzimidazole<br>
prodrug, benzimidazole metabolite or benzimidazole derivative is dissolved,<br>
suspended or mixed as a paste, cream or gel in an appropriate solvent,<br>
homogenate, or carrier, such as a pharmaceutically acceptable or<br>
cosmetically acceptable carrier, to form a benzimidazole composition. It is<br>
known by those skilled in the art that conventional benzimidazole<br>
preparations are rarely soluble in many pharmaceutically acceptable carriers<br>
and are nearly insoluble in aqueous solutions. Therefore, the formulation<br>
may be prepared in an oil or oil-in-water emulsion. Suitable oils include,<br>
but are not limited to, arachis oil, peanut oil, olive oil, sesame oil, castor oil,<br>
corn oil; synthetic triglycerides; and soluble polymers. The carrier or<br>
diluent may also include a delayed release material, such as glyceryl<br>
monostearate or glyceryl disterearate alone or in combination with a wax.<br>
The composition may additionally contain conventional agents such as<br>
preservatives (including antioxidizing agents such as tocopherol),<br>
thickening agents, wetting and dispersing agents, buffers, humectants, such<br>
as lactic acid and glycolic acid copolymers, emulsifying agents, fillers,<br>
emollients and surface active agents (such as sorbitane fatty acid esters).<br>
Alternatively, the benzimidazole of a topical formulation is dissolved<br>
or suspended in an aqueous suspension containing benzyl alcohol,<br>
polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono-oleate, ethoxylated sorbitane fatty acid<br>
esters, aprotic polar solvents, and, optionally, thickeners such as propylene<br>
glycol, polyethylene glycol, monohydric alcohol, n-methyl pyrrolidone,<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose, such as Methocel® A-15 Premium Carboxymethyl<br>
Cellulose (Dow Chemical Co., Midland, MI) or other appropriate polymers.<br>
In addition, solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), DMSO glycol,<br>
decylmethylsulfoxide (decyl-MSO), dimethylacetamide (DMA),<br>
dimethylformamide (DMF), saturated fatty acids such as lauric acid and<br>
alcohols, and weak surfactants containing a moderately sized polar group<br>
such as l-dodecyl-azacyclohepten-2-one (Azone®, E.L. Nelson), alcohols<br>
and ketones, particularly acetone, are useful for dissolving or partially<br>
dissolving the compound to enhance skin penetration of the benzimidazole.<br>
The penetration enhancement of benzimidazoles by saturated fatty acids may<br>
be maximized when propylene glycol is used as the vehicle.<br>
An additional topical benzimidazole formulation for enhanced skin<br>
penetration employs the combined administration of cyclodextrins, such as<br>
carboxymethylethyl-b-cyclodextrin and a lipophilic penetration enhancer<br>
such as HPE-101 (l-[2-decylthio)-ethyl]aza-cyclopentane-2-one) or 1-<br>
dodecyl-azacyclohepten-2-one (Azone®) in a topical vehicle.<br>
For simplicity and ease of use for topical administration to the body,<br>
the benzimidazole composition contains the benzimidazole compound in<br>
combination with a cosmetic, treatment, or cleansing hair or nail preparation<br>
such as a hair shampoo, hair rinse, hair conditioner, hair spray, hair<br>
mousse, hair gel, nail lotion, nail ointment, nail paste, nail polish or nail<br>
polish remover.<br>
Concentrated preparations containing a benzimidazole in a<br>
concentration of 0.5 to 90 percent by weight, preferably 5 to 50 percent by<br>
weight, may be prepared and diluted before administration. The preferred<br>
concentration to be administered topically is preferably from 5 to 50 mg<br>
benzimidazole per kilogram body weight. Particularly preferred<br>
concentration employed are from 10 to 30 mg benzimidazole per kilogram<br>
body weight. A most preferred administration concentration is 25 mg<br>
benzimidazole per kilogram body weight.<br>
Poorly water-soluble drugs such as benzimidazoles exhibit increased<br>
bioavailability when dispersed in a non-aqueous mixture of a surfactant and<br>
a co-solvent in the presence of heat as described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,169,846 to Michael J. Crooks, which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Formulations produced by the method of Crooks are described as being<br>
free-flowing and completely miscible with water and may be well suited to<br>
topical administration.<br>
Amorphous benzimidazoles are preferred over crystalline or granular<br>
forms, particularly for topical administration, due to their enhanced<br>
solubility in a variety of solvents. In addition, the amorphous<br>
benzimidazoles have a higher bioavailability and efficacy than crystalline<br>
benzimidazoles. Amorphous benzimidazole derivatives are prepared as<br>
described in European Patent Application Publication No. 224,249 to<br>
Richard Allen Runkel, which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Basically, the amorphous compounds are produced by precipitating a<br>
benzimidazole derivative from an acidic or basic solution by rapidly adding<br>
an amount of base or acid sufficient to adjust the solution to the pH of<br>
lowest benzimidazole solubility or by rapidly precipitating a benzimidazole<br>
derivative from an acid or basic solution by adding a basic or acid solution<br>
containing a stabilizing amount of a stabilizer polymer. Stable amorphous<br>
compositions contain an amorphous benzimidazole compound in<br>
combination with a stabilizing amount of a stabilizing polymer such as<br>
cellulose derivatives, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and derivatives, xanthan gums,<br>
pectins, alginates, tragacanth and derivatives, gum arabic and derivatives,<br>
carrageenans, agar and derivatives, polysaccharides from microbial sources,<br>
arabinogalactans, galactomannans, and dextrans. The most preferred<br>
stabilizing polymer is a cellulose derivative such as methylcellulose,<br>
Methocel® A-15, Methocel® A4C, or carboxymethylcellulose. The<br>
stabilized amorphous benzimidazole compositions are appropriate for<br>
administration topically or by parenteral injection In addition, the stabilized<br>
amorphous benzimidazole is useful in oral formulations such as<br>
suspensions, tablets, or top dressing crumbles specifically for mixing into<br>
animal feed or water as described in more detail below.<br>
For oral administration, the benzimidazole compound may be<br>
combined with an orally ingestible carrier formed into tablets, capsules,<br>
powders, granules, pastes, homogenates, solutions, suspensions,<br>
emulsions, boli, medicated feed or added to drinking water. For delivery to<br>
animals, the benzimidazole composition is more easily administered when<br>
combined with feed or drinking water.<br>
Oral solutions are prepared by dissolving, suspending or<br>
homogenizing the benzimidazole, benzimidazole prodrug, benzimidazole<br>
r<br>
metabolite or benzimidazole derivative in a suitable solvent and, if<br>
appropriate, adding additives such as solubilizers, bases, buffer salts,<br>
antioxidants and preservatives. The solutions may be filtered and packed<br>
under sterile conditions. Solvents that promote dissolution of the active<br>
compound in the main solvent or substances that prevent precipitation of the<br>
benzimidazole may be used as solubilizers. Examples of such solubilizers<br>
include polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyoxyethylated castor oil,and<br>
polyoxyethyethylated ester. When the benzimidazole is provided in an<br>
amorphous (non-crystalline) form, the preferred stabilizer is a stabilizer<br>
polymer as described in European Patent Application Publication No.<br>
224,249 to Runkel. Exemplary preservatives include benzyl alcohol,<br>
trichlorobutanol, parahydroxybenzoic acid esters and n-butanol.<br>
The benzimidazole may additionally be combined with conventional<br>
excipients and adjuvants such as starch, cellulose, talc, magnesium stearate,<br>
sugar, gelatin, calcium carbonate, silicic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose and<br>
the like. The compound may also be encapsulated within microparticles or<br>
incorporated into a monolithic matrix, for subsequent or sustained release.<br>
Microparticles may be made using synthetic polymers, natural polymers,<br>
proteins and polysaccharides, including phase separation, solvent<br>
evaporation, emulsification, and spray drying. Generally polymers form<br>
the supporting structure of these microspheres, and the compound is<br>
incorporated into the polymer structure. Exemplary polymers used for the<br>
formation of microspheres include homopolymers and copolymers of lactic<br>
acid and glycolic acid (PLGA). It will be understood by those skilled in the<br>
art that microparticles, depending on their composition and size, may be<br>
administered orally, by injection, or topically.<br>
An oral formulation is typically prepared by adding the additives to<br>
water and stirring until dissolved, then adding the benzimidazole and<br>
stirring until the mixture is homogenous. The mixture is passed through a<br>
homogenizer, if necessary, to obtain relatively uniform particle size<br>
distribution of approximately one micron. Homogenization is achieved by<br>
means known to those skilled in the art, such as with a rotor stator or high<br>
pressure homogenizer. When using a single head high pressure<br>
homogenizer, the mixture is passed through until the pressure can be<br>
maintained within the range of approximately 9,000 to 15,000 psig,<br>
preferably in a range of from about 12,000 to about 14,000 psig, most<br>
preferably within a range of about 13,000 psig. When using a triple head<br>
high pressure homogenizer, the mixture is passed through at a pressure of<br>
from about 2,000 to about 10,000 psig, preferably from about 4,000 to<br>
8,000 psig.<br>
The concentration of benzimidazole for oral administration is<br>
preferably between 0.5 and 50 mg per kilogram of body weight for a<br>
prolonged period of time. Generally, the compound is administered initially<br>
at a high concentration and the patient is then placed on a maintenance<br>
dosage indefinitely. An alternative preferred concentration for oral<br>
administration is between approximately 2 and 20 percent by weight for use<br>
on animals and between approximately 20 and 80 percent by weight for<br>
humans.<br>
In avian species, such as chickens, pigeons, ducks and geese a 1%<br>
to 10% benzimidazole suspension in drinking water may be given for a<br>
seven day period of time every two to three weeks. A concentrated (about<br>
10% to about 30%) benzimidazole formulation may be diluted with water to<br>
yield a benzimidazole concentration from approximately 4,000 ppm to<br>
10,000 ppm, preferably from about 6,000 ppm to 10,000 ppm, most<br>
preferably about 8,000 ppm. This diluted formulation may be used as a<br>
stock solution that is further diluted, for example, one ounce of the stock<br>
formulation is diluted in approximately a 1:128 ratio to obtain medicated<br>
drinking water having a benzimidazole concentration of from about 45 to 80<br>
ppm, preferably 65 ppm. Alternatively, the concentrated benzimidazole<br>
formulation is diluted directly to a concentration of from approximately 45<br>
to approximately 80 ppm, preferably approximately 65 ppm and used for<br>
avian drinking water directly. The concentration of benzimidazole is<br>
calculated to provide the targeted amount of benzimidazole per body weight<br>
of the avian or poultry being treated, preferably in the range of<br>
approximately 1 mg to 5 mg of benzimidazole per kilogram of body weight<br>
per day in the volume of drinking water normally consumed by the animal<br>
being treated in a 6 to 12 hour treatment period, preferably an 8 hour<br>
treatment period.<br>
It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the particular<br>
dose or formulation for either topical or oral administration will be<br>
determined in part by consideration of the animal or human undergoing<br>
treatment, the particular biological effects manifested by the benzimidazole<br>
and other components utilized in the formulation, and the extended period of<br>
time over which the effective treatment is desired.<br>
The compositions and methods described above will be further<br>
understood with reference to the following non-limiting examples.<br>
Example 1: Oral and Topical Administration of Fenbendazole<br>
to Hairless Rats to Promote Hair and Claw Growth<br>
An experiment was performed to compare the effects of oral and<br>
topical administration of fenbendazole to hairless rats on hair and claw<br>
growth.<br>
Experimental Procedure:<br>
Circular dorsal skin biopsies (4 mm) were taken from adult CD®<br>
Albino Hairless rats (CR1:CD® (SD)-hrBR, Charles River Laboratories,<br>
Wilmington, MA) with a skin punch prior to either oral or topical<br>
administration of fenbendazole and at 7 day intervals thereafter for 35 days.<br>
Dorsal skin biopsies samples were also removed from a negative control rat<br>
who had received no fenbendazole either orally or topically. The biopsies<br>
were taken after administration of isoflurane anesthesia and analyzed<br>
microscopically by a dermatologic pathologist.<br>
Topical Administration<br>
Finely ground fenbendazole powder (22%, Hoechst-Roussel Agri-<br>
Vet, Sommerville, NJ) was suspended to make a supersaturated solution in<br>
100% acetone. The dorsal body of an adult hairless rat was treated topically<br>
by applying the fenbendazole suspension with a cotton swab each day for<br>
30 days. The head and tail were not treated. The rat was not bathed, but<br>
was gently wiped with a damp cloth prior to each subsequent treatment to<br>
rid the test surface of granular debris.<br>
Oral Administration<br>
The fenbendazole powder was diluted (one teaspoonful in 30 ml<br>
water) to provide an 18 mg/ml aqueous solution and was placed in a water<br>
bottle. The rat consumed the entire contents of the water bottle in a 24 hour<br>
period, at which time a 30 ml aliquot of the fenbendazole solution was<br>
resupplied for a 30 day dosing period.<br>
Results<br>
The rat receiving fenbendazole orally exhibited hair growth on the<br>
face, lateral thorax and lateral abdomen by day 7. Hair growth on the face<br>
of this rat was patchy, straight and white. Hair growth on the lateral thorax<br>
and lateral abdomen of this rat was white, fine and crimped. The hair<br>
growth on the lateral auxiliary area was straight and white.<br>
White hair was definitely visible on the rats treated orally and<br>
topically on the facial, ventral neck, foreleg circumferentially, hind leg<br>
circumferentially, tail region and paws by day 30 of treatment. The dorsum<br>
(where the skin biopsies were taken) exhibited only a small amount of hair<br>
growth. The muzzles of the treated rats contained long, crimped vibrissae.<br>
In addition, the claws on the treated animals showed a significant increase in<br>
length. Some hair growth was observed on the control rat in the same<br>
general areas as observed in the treated rats. However, the hair growth on<br>
the control rat was minimal and significantly less than that observed on the<br>
treated rats.<br>
Upon microscopic examination, no measurable differences were<br>
observed between treated and control animal dorsal skin biopsy samples<br>
except for follicle length. A graph of follicle length in the treated and<br>
untreated animals over the thirty day treatment period is set forth in Figure<br>
1. Follicle length as measured microscopically is the longest distance from<br>
the granular layer of the epidermis to the base of the deepest follicle,<br>
measured vertically in millimeters. As shown in Figure 1, both oral and<br>
topical fenbendazole administration resulted in an increase in follicle length<br>
that peaked at day 14, subsided and then increased gradually again from day<br>
35 onwards. Follicle length of the biopsy removed from the rat who had<br>
received fenbendazole orally was higher than the control for all samples<br>
except the 28 day sample, which was the same for both the oral treatment<br>
and untreated rat. The follicle length of the biopsy taken from the rat who<br>
had received fenbendazole topically was always less than that of the orally<br>
treated rat, but was higher than the control on day 14 and days 42-63.<br>
Example 2: Oral Administration of Fenbendazole to Hairless<br>
Rats to Promote Hair and Claw Growth<br>
An experiment was performed to determined the effects on hair<br>
growth of an oral fenbendazole suspension administered to hairless rats.<br>
Experimental Procedure:<br>
Cylindrical dorsal skin punch biopsy specimens (4 mm diameter)<br>
were taken from the dorsal facial area and the right lateral thigh area of adult<br>
CD® Albino Hairless rats (CR1:CD® (SD)-hrBR, Charles River<br>
Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) at day 0 (prior to oral fenbendazole<br>
suspension administration), day 17 and day 29 (after oral fenbendazole<br>
suspension or control suspension administration). The skin punch biopsies<br>
were taken as described above in Example 1.<br>
Thirty milliliters of a fenbendazole solution was prepared by mixing<br>
1 teaspoonful of fenbendazole powder (22%, Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet,<br>
Sommerville, NJ) in 30 ml of water to give a final concentration of 18<br>
mg/ml. The fenbendazole solution was placed in separate water bottles for<br>
each of two rats receiving treatment. The rats consumed the entire contents<br>
of the water bottles in a 24 hour period, at which time a 30 ml aliquot of the<br>
fenbendazole solution was resupplied for a 30 day dosing period. A<br>
negative control rat received an equivalent quantity of water.<br>
Results<br>
The rats receiving fenbendazole orally daily for 30 days exhibited<br>
hair growth on the face, lateral thorax, lateral abdomen, and lateral thighs by<br>
day 7. The hair growth appeared white, patchy and straight on all areas<br>
listed. The muzzles exhibited long crimped to curling vibrissae by day 17.<br>
The claws on all four paws of the rats receiving fenbendazole showed<br>
significant growth in length, along with increased periungual fold<br>
keratinization around each claw.<br>
Hair growth and claw length and attendant keratinization was<br>
minimal to absent on the negative control rat.<br>
Upon microscopic examination, no meaningful differences were<br>
observed between treated and control animal dorsal skin biopsy samples or<br>
follicle length. However, measurable differences were observed between<br>
treated and control animal facial biopsy samples for the number of vellus<br>
hair shafts. A graph showing the number of vellus hair shafts from samples<br>
taken from the facial areas in the treated and untreated animals over the 30<br>
day treatment period is set forth in Figure 2.<br>
Example 3: Topical Administration of Fenbendazole to<br>
Fingernails to Increase Nail Plate Thickness and Length<br>
An experiment was performed to determined the effects of topical<br>
fenbendazole administration on fingernail plate thickness and length.<br>
Experimental Procedure:<br>
Three teaspoonsful of finely ground fenbendazole powder (22%,<br>
Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet, Sommerville, NJ) was combined with 15 ml of<br>
90% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and mixed well. The solution was applied<br>
topically with a dropper and massaged gently into the uncut cuticular and<br>
proximal nail fold surfaces of dry, clean, fingernails of each finger of two<br>
human adult females.<br>
Prior to treatment, the fingernails of the subjects exhibited a slow<br>
growth rate and short length, primarily due to chronic breakage horizontally<br>
at the quick or distal portion of the nail. Nail breakage was associated with<br>
soft, easily bent nails or horizontal splitting or flaking as the nails grew<br>
away from the nail bed. All nails were cut back to the nail bed to allow for<br>
confluent nail growth and equality of growth among fingernails during the<br>
course of treatment. The first measurement was taken on day 0. The<br>
fenbendazole solution was applied from day 1 to day 14. Subsequent<br>
measurements were taken on days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35.<br>
All fingernails demonstrated relief from onychoschizia during and<br>
after treatment. Nail thickness was maintained and progressively increased<br>
during the 35 trial period. All nails failed to show signs of fragility, such as<br>
bending when digital pressure was applied to the fingernail, and failed to<br>
exhibit pitting, nail layer separation, or horizontal flaking as the nails grew<br>
longitudinally away from the nail bed edge.<br>
Nail plate thickness of all 10 fingernails was measured at 7 day<br>
intervals with a stainless steel caliper at the central aspect of the free edge of<br>
the nail plate as the nail plate emerged over the nail bed. The caliper was<br>
positioned to grip the free edge of the fingernail using standardized<br>
pressure. Measurements were made in fractions of a millimeter. At the time<br>
of measurement, all nails were clean and dry without the presence of other<br>
nail treatment, polish, or cleanser. The caliper was positioned so that<br>
artifacts could not be produced by angling the caliper.<br>
Longitudinal growth of each nail plate was measured with a straight<br>
ruler in sub-millimeter increments, viewed by use of a magnifying loupe of<br>
10X magnification.<br>
The results for each fingernail of each experimental subject, human<br>
female 1 and human female 2, are shown in Tables 1-4 below and presented<br>
in graphical form in Figures 3-10. All measurements are in millimeters.<br>
The results for each subject are separated by a slash mark in the tables with<br>
Female 1 to the left of the slash mark.<br>
