				<td>PROCESSES FOR PREPARING A SUBSTITUTED GAMMA-AMINO ACID<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] Pregabalin, a compound of Formula I, is the international commonly accepted<br>
name for (S)-(+)-3-aminomethyl-5-methyl-l-hexanoic acid and has an empirical formula of<br>
C8H17NO2. Pregabalin is also known as (S)-(+)-3-(2-methylpropyl)-4-aminobutanoic acid or<br>
(<s pregabalin is a commercially marketed pharmaceutically active></s>
substance known to be useful as therapeutic agent for treatment of pain, convulsions, general<br>
anxiety related disorders and epilectic seizures.<br>
<br>
[0002] Pregabalin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts are described in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,197,819 ("the '819 patent"), along with two different synthetic processes for their<br>
preparation. However, these routes involve expensive and/or difficult to handle substances<br>
such as (4R,5S)-4-methyl-5-phenyl-2-oxazolidinone, n-butyllithium, and "azide"<br>
intermediates. The '819 patent is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0003] Several patents and published patent applications (e.g, U.S. Patent No. 5,616,793<br>
("the '793 patent") and International Publication Nos. WO 2006/122258 ("the '258<br>
publication"), WO 2006/122255 ("the '255 publication"), and WO 2006/121557 ("the 557<br>
publication")) disclose a more convenient preparation of pregabalin by means of a Hofmann<br>
rearrangement of (R)-(-)-3-(carbamoylmethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid, a compound of<br>
Formula II, in the presence of bromine and an alkali hydroxide as depicted in Scheme 1.<br>
[0004] The '793 patent and the '258, '255, and '557 publications are incorporated herein<br>
by reference.<br>
<br>
[0005] However, this synthetic method is not desirable for industrial implementation,<br>
since it requires the use of bromine, which is very toxic and corrosive. Moreover, this<br>
process involves the formation of undesired by-products. In this regard, it is well-known that<br>
the presence of impurities may adversely affect the safety and shelf life of pharmaceutical<br>
formulations.<br>
[0006] Regarding the synthetic process described in Scheme 1 (i.e., the preparation of<br>
pregabalin via a Hofmann rearrangement reaction of a compound of Formula II), Hoekstra et<br>
al. in Organic Process Research &amp; Development 1997, 1, 26-38, report that the use of sodium<br>
hypochlorite as an alternative to bromine gives poor conversions.<br>
[0007] In view of the foregoing, there is a need to provide improved processes for<br>
preparing pregabalin which are suitable for industrial implementation, which avoid the use of<br>
bromine and which produce pregabalin substantially free of impurities.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008] The present invention provides processes for preparing a compound of Formula I<br>
(i.e., pregabalin), which have industrial applicability. For example, processes of the present<br>
invention avoid the use of bromine and produce pregabalin in high yield and with a low<br>
content of undesired by-products. In some embodiments, the present invention provides a<br>
process for preparing pregabablin of Formula I by reacting (R)-(-)-3-(carbamoylmethyl)-5-<br>
methylhexanoic acid of Formula II with sodium hypochlorite. In other embodiments, the<br>
present invention also provides pregabalin substantially free of impurities and pharmaceutical<br>
formulations comprising pregabalin.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] In some embodiments, the present invention provides processes for preparing<br>
pregabalin of Formula I: <br>
said processes comprising reacting (R)-(-)-3-(carbamoylmethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid of<br>
Formula II: <br>
with sodium hypochlorite.<br>
[0010] Sodium hypochlorite is used in processes of the present invention to convert<br>
(R)-(-)-3-(carbamoylmethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid of Formula II to pregabalin of Formula I.<br>
Applicants have surprisingly discovered that, in contrast to the teachings of Hoekstra et al. in<br>
Organic Process Research &amp; Development 1997,1,26-38, the Hofmann rearrangement of a<br>
compound of Formula II results in high yields of pregabalin when using sodium hypochlorite<br>
instead of bromine. Since sodium hypochlorite is cheaper and easier to handle than bromine,<br>
processes of the present invention are suitable for industrial scale.<br>
[0011] Processes of the present invention are conducted in a suitable solvent, including<br>
mixtures of solvents. Typically, solvents in accordance with the invention comprise water.<br>
In some embodiments, the present invention provides processes for preparing pregabalin of<br>
Formula I from (R)-(-)-3-(carbamoylmemyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid of Formula II using<br>
sodium hypochlorite wherein the solvent comprises water.<br>
[0012] In other embodiments, the present invention provides processes for preparing<br>
pregabalin from a compound of Formula II using sodium hypochlorite wherein the reaction is<br>
carried out in the presence of an alkaline hydroxide. In preferred embodiments, the alkaline<br>
hydroxide is sodium hydroxide.<br>
[0013] In preferred embodiments, the reaction of (R)-(-)-3-(carbamoylmethyl)-5-<br>
methylhexanoic acid of Formula II with sodium hypochlorite to form pregabalin is carried<br>
out in a mixture of water and sodium hydroxide.<br>
[0014] Applicants have surprisingly discovered that both (i) using a definite number of<br>
molar equivalents of sodium hypochlorite (e.g, less than about 1.3 molar equivalents), and (ii)<br>
carrying out the reaction at a temperature of about 50 °C to about 70 °C, have an independent<br>
and complementary effect in the improvement of the Hofmann rearrangement reaction of the<br>
compound of Formula II to afford pregabalin of Formula I efficiently and with a low content<br>
of impurities, especially impurities having a HPLC relative retention time of 1.3. Therefore,<br>
the process described above is suitable for industrial implementation, since the process avoids<br>
the use of bromine, and provides pregabalin in good yields and with a low content of<br>
undesired by-products.<br>
[0015] Applicants have discovered that regulating the temperature of the reaction in<br>
which a compound of Formula II is converted to a compound of Formula I using sodium<br>
hypochlorite provides unexpected benefits. For example, when a compound of Formula II is<br>
subjected to Hofmann rearrangement conditions using sodium hypochlorite at a temperature<br>
of about 40 °C to about 50 °C, a significant amount of an undesired impurity is formed<br>
having a HPLC relative retention time of 1.3 when using the HPLC conditions described<br>
herein. This impurity remains even after multiple recrystallizations and is present in<br>
unacceptable concentrations for pharmaceutical applications.<br>
[0016] In contrast, when a compound of Formula II is subjected to Hofmann<br>
rearrangement conditions using sodium hypochlorite at a temperature of about 50 °C to about<br>
70 °C, the amount of impurities having a HPLC relative retention time of 1.3 using the HPLC<br>
conditions described herein is decreased to almost undetectable levels, and in some cases, the<br>
impurities are decreased to undetectable levels.<br>
[0017] Thus, in keeping with the invention, the reaction temperature and reaction<br>
conditions are selected to achieve low or even undetectable levels of impurities with a<br>
relative retention time of 1.3.<br>
[0018] In an embodiment, the present invention provides a process for preparing<br>
pregabalin of Formula I, said process comprising reacting (R)-(-)-3-(carbamoylmethyl)-5-<br>
methylhexanoic acid of Formula II with sodium hypochlorite at a temperature of from about<br>
50 °C to about 70 °C.<br>
[0019] Typically, the temperature at which processes of the invention are conducted<br>
range from about 50 °C to about 70 °C. In preferred embodiments, processes of the present<br>
invention are conducted at a temperature of about 60 °C.<br>
[0020] In some embodiments, processes of the present invention comprise the step of<br>
contacting a compound of Formula II with sodium hypochlorite at a temperature of about<br>
5 °C to about 10 °C prior to the reaction at a temperature of from about 50 °C to about 70 °C,<br>
preferably to about 60 °C. The reaction of sodium hypochlorite with a compound of Formula<br>
II is exothermic. Thus, in keeping with the invention, when sodium hypochlorite is added to<br>
a compound of Formula II at a temperature of about 5 °C to about 10 °C, the sodium<br>
hypochlorite is added over a period of time such that the reaction mixture is maintained at a<br>
temperature of about 5 °C to about 10 °C.<br>
[0021] Applicants have surprisingly discovered that regulating the amount of sodium<br>
hypochlorite used in the conversion of a compound of Formula II to a compound of Formula<br>
(I) in accordance with the present invention has unexpected benefits. For example, when a<br>
compound of Formula II undergoes a Hofmann rearrangement in the presence of less than<br>
about 1.3 molar equivalents of sodium hypochlorite, the yield of pregabalin from the reaction<br>
unexpectedly increases from about 60% to about 70%.<br>
[0022] In an embodiment, the present invention provides a process for preparing<br>
pregabalin of Formula I, said process comprising reacting (R)-(-)-3-(carbamoylmethyl)-5-<br>
methylhexanoic acid of Formula II with less than about 1.3 molar equivalents of sodium<br>
hypochlorite.<br>
[0023] Typically, processes of the invention use less than about 1.3 molar equivalents of<br>
sodium hypochlorite. In preferred embodiments, the amount of sodium hypochlorite used is<br>
from about 0.90 molar equivalents to about 1.1 molar equivalents, most preferably the<br>
amount of sodium hypochlorite used is about 0.95 molar equivalents.<br>
[0024] In other preferred embodiments, the present invention provides a process for<br>
preparing pregabalin of Formula I, said process comprising reacting (R)-(-)-3-<br>
(carbamoylmethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid of Formula II (i) with less than about 1.3 molar<br>
equivalents of sodium hypochlorite, and (ii) at a temperature of from about 50 °C to about<br>
70 °C. Accordingly, in these embodiments, the amount of sodium hypochlorite and the<br>
temperature can be varied as described above. For example, the reaction is preferably<br>
conducted at 60 °C and the amount of sodium hypochlorite is preferably from about 0.90<br>
molar equivalents to about 1.1 molar equivalents, most preferably the amount of sodium<br>
hypochlorite used is about 0.95 molar equivalents.<br>
[0025] In some embodiments, processes of the present invention comprise the step of<br>
isolating pregabalin by treating the reaction mixture while at a temperature of about 30 °C to<br>
about 35 °C with a mineral acid to achieve a pH of about 5.0 to about 5.5.<br>
[0026] In some embodiments, processes of the present invention comprise the step of<br>
crystallizing the pregabalin from a mixture of isopropanol and water.<br>
[0027] In some embodiments, the present invention provides pregabalin of Formula I<br>
prepared according to processes of the invention. For example, in some embodiments the<br>
present invention provides pregabalin of Formula I which is prepared by reacting (R)-(-)-3-<br>
(carbamoylmethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid of Formula II with sodium hypochlorite at a<br>
temperature of from about 50 °C to about 70 °C, preferably about 60 °C.<br>
[0028] In other embodiments, the present invention provides pregabalin of Formula I<br>
which is prepared by reacting (R)-(-)-3-(carbamoylmethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid of<br>
Formula II with less than about 1.3 molar equivalents of sodium hypochlorite, preferably<br>
from about 0.90 molar equivalents to about 1.1 molar equivalents of sodium hypochlorite,<br>
and most preferably about 0.95 molar equivalents of sodium hypochlorite.<br>
[0029] In other embodiments, the present invention provides pregabalin of Formula I<br>
which is prepared by reacting (R)-(-)-3-(carbamoylmethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid of<br>
Formula II with sodium hypochlorite wherein both the reaction temperature and amount of<br>
sodium hypochlorite is regulated as described herein.<br>
[0030] Typically, pregabalin in accordance with the present invention is substantially free<br>
of impurities having an HPLC relative retention time of 1.3.<br>
[0031] The HPLC conditions described herein in the Examples are illustrative of one<br>
method for determining impurities resulting from the process of the invention. Thus, in<br>
keeping with aspects of the present invention, HPLC is used to ascertain the purity of<br>
pregabalin, including analyzing pregabalin produced using processes of the invention for the<br>
presence of impurities which have a HPLC relative retention time of 1.3. In a particularly<br>
preferred embodiment, the following HPLC conditions are used to analyze pregabalin. A<br>
two-component mobile phase (A:B) is prepared by mixing (approximately) 76 volumes of<br>
mobile phase A and 24 volumes of mobile phase B. Component A is prepared by dissolving<br>
0.58 g of monobasic ammonium phosphate and 1.83 g of sodium perchlorate in 1000 g of<br>
water and adjusting the pH to 1.8 with perchloric acid. Component B is acetonitrile.<br>
Samples of pregabalin are prepared in mobile phase A and chromatographed using a reverse-<br>
phase column equipped with UV detection monitoring at 215 nm.<br>
[0032] Typically, pregabalin in accordance with the present invention comprises less than<br>
about 0.5% of an impurity having an HPLC relative retention time of 1.3 using the HPLC<br>
conditions described herein. In some embodiments, pregabalin of the present invention<br>
comprises less than about 0.25% of said impurities. In particularly preferred embodiments,<br>
pregabalin of the present invention has less than 0.1% of said impurities, most preferably no<br>
impurities having a HPLC relative retention time of 1.3 are detected using the HPLC<br>
conditions described herein.<br>
[0033] In other embodiments, the present invention provides pharmaceutical formulations<br>
comprising pregabalin prepared according to processes of the invention, alone or in<br>
combination with other suitable ingredients (e.g., excipients or other active ingredients).<br>
[0034] The following examples further illustrate the invention but, of course, should not<br>
be construed as in any way limiting its scope.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0035] The following HPLC method was used to determine the presence of impurities. A<br>
two-component mobile phase (A:B) was prepared by mixing 76 volumes of mobile phase A<br>
and 24 volumes of mobile phase B, wherein component A was prepared by dissolving 0.58 g<br>
of monobasic ammonium phosphate and 1.83 g of sodium perchlorate in 1000 g of water,<br>
adjusting the pH to 1.8 with perchloric acid, filtering and degassing; component B was<br>
acetonitrile. Samples of pregabalin (30 uL, 20 mg/mL) were prepared using mobile phase A<br>
and chromatographed at ambient temperature using a Symmetry C18 column (5 µm; 250 x<br>
4.6 mm) equipped with UV detection monitoring at 215 nm at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min.<br>
The chromatogram was run for at least 40 min in isocratic mode.<br>
[0036] Approximate HPLC retention times and relative retention times of pregabalin and<br>
an impurity are depicted in the table below.<br>
<br>
comparative EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0037] This example illustrates a process for preparing (S)-(+)-3-aminomethyl-5-methyl-<br>
1-hexanoic acid (i.e., pregabalin of Formula I).<br>
[0038] In a 1 L, four-neck, round-bottom reaction vessel, purged with nitrogen and<br>
equipped with a reflux condenser, 500 mL pressure-equalized addition funnel, thermometer<br>
and blade impeller, were added in sequence 47.38 g (0.253 mol) of compound of Formula II<br>
and 56.85 g of water.<br>
[0039] The mixture was stirred to give a thick suspension and cooled to 5-10 °C.<br>
[0040] 24.07 g (0.301 mol, 1.2 molar eq.) of 50% w/w sodium hydroxide solution were<br>
added dropwise onto the stirred suspension over a period of about 25 min, maintaining the<br>
temperature at 5-10 oC. Once addition was complete, the mixture was stirred for an<br>
additional 20 minutes.<br>
[0041] In a separate 500 mL, three neck, round-bottom reaction vessel, purged with<br>
nitrogen and equipped with a blade impeller, were added in sequence 274.23 g (0.329 mol,<br>
1.3 molar eq.) of 8.93% w/w aqueous sodium hypochlorite solution, 22.74 g of water and<br>
34.12 g of 50% w/w aqueous sodium hydroxide.<br>
[0042] The basic hypochlorite solution thus prepared was added dropwise from an<br>
addition funnel to the aqueous solution of compound of Formula II while maintaining the<br>
temperature at 5-10 oC.<br>
[0043] Once addition was complete, cooling was removed and the reaction was allowed<br>
to warm up while stirring. A spontaneous exothermic reaction initiated at around 25 oC,<br>
raising the reaction temperature to 40-50 °C. Once the exothermicity subsided, the reaction<br>
mixture was heated to a temperature of 40-50 °C for 1 h, applying heat as necessary to<br>
maintain the temperature.<br>
[0044] After this period of heating, the reaction mixture was cooled to 30-35 °C.<br>
[0045] While maintaining the temperature at 30-35 °C, about 82 g of 35% w/w aqueous<br>
hydrochloric acid were added until a pH of 5.0-5.5 was achieved. A peach-coloured<br>
suspension was observed to form during the addition.<br>
[0046] The suspension was then cooled to 5-10 °C and stirred at this temperature for 1 h.<br>
[0047] The suspension was filtered and the collected solid was washed with 23.69 g of<br>
cold 5% w/w aqueous sodium chloride solution followed by 23.69 g of cold water to yield<br>
27.93 g of wet, pale orange, crude pregabalin (LOD: 14.95%, estimated dry mass: 23.75 g,<br>
yield: 58.9%).<br>
[0048] In a 1 L, four-neck, round-bottom reaction vessel, purged with nitrogen and<br>
equipped with a reflux condenser, 500 mL pressure-equalized addition funnel, thermometer<br>
and blade impeller, were added in sequence 24.44 g of the wet crude pregabalin obtained in<br>
the previous step (estimated dry mass: 20.79 g), 81.60 g of isopropanol and 62.37 g of water. ¦<br>
[0049] The suspension was heated to reflux until complete dissolution occurred. A<br>
yellow solution was thus obtained. The solution was cooled to 5-10 °C and then stirred at this<br>
temperature for 1 h.<br>
[0050] The suspension was filtered and the collected solid was washed with 16.32 g of<br>
isopropanol to yield 18.53 g of wet, white pregabalin (LOD: 4.35%, estimated dry mass:<br>
17.72 g, yield: 85.2%).<br>
[0051] Chromatographic purity (HPLC): pregabalin: 99.03%, impurity RRT 1.3: 0.22%.<br>
[0052] In a 1 L, four neck, round-bottom reaction vessel, purged with nitrogen and<br>
equipped with a reflux condenser, 500 mL pressure-equalized addition funnel, thermometer<br>
and blade impeller, were added in sequence 15.46 g of wet pregabalin from the previous step<br>
(estimated dry mass: 14.79 g), 58.01 g of isopropanol and 51.73 g of water.<br>
[0053] The suspension was heated to reflux until complete dissolution occurred. A<br>
yellow solution was thus obtained. The solution was cooled to 75-80 °C and filtered to<br>
remove insoluble particles. The solution was cooled further to 5-10 °C and then stirred at this<br>
temperature for 1 h.<br>
[0054] The suspension was filtered and the collected solid was washed with 11.61 g of<br>
isopropanol to yield 13.36 g of wet, white pregabalin.<br>
[0055] The wet solid was dried at 60 °C under vacuum for 4 h to give 13.11 g of dry,<br>
white pregabalin (LOD: 0.08%, yield: 88.6%).<br>
[0056] Chromatographic purity (HPLC): pregabalin: 99.37%, impurity RRT 1.3: 0.19%.<br>
[0057]<br>
<br>
[0058] This example illustrates a process for preparing (S)-(+)-3-aminomethyl-5-methyl-<br>
1-hexanoic acid (i.e., pregabalin of Formula I).<br>
[0059] In a 1 L, four neck, round-bottom reaction vessel, purged with nitrogen and<br>
equipped with a reflux condenser, 500 mL pressure-equalized addition funnel, thermometer<br>
and blade impeller, were added in sequence 29.08 g (0.155 mol) of compound of Formula II<br>
and 34.90 g of water. The mixture was stirred to give a thick suspension and cooled to<br>
5-10 °C.<br>
[0060] 14.91 g (0.186 mol, 1.2 molar eq.) of 50% w/w sodium hydroxide solution were<br>
added dropwise onto the stirred suspension over a period of about 25 min, maintaining the<br>
temperature at 5-10 °C. Once addition was complete, the mixture was stirred for an<br>
additional 20 min.<br>
[0061] In a separate 500 mL, three neck, round-bottom reaction vessel, purged with<br>
nitrogen and equipped with a blade impeller, were added in sequence 144.02 g (0.171 mol,<br>
1.1 molar eq.) of 8.83% w/w aqueous sodium hypochlorite solution, 13.95 g of water and<br>
20.94 g of 50% w/w aqueous sodium hydroxide.<br>
[0062] The basic hypochlorite solution thus prepared was added dropwise from an<br>
addition funnel to the aqueous solution of compound of Formula II while maintaining the<br>
temperature at 5-10 °C.<br>
[0063] Once addition was complete, cooling was removed and the reaction was allowed<br>
to warm up while stirring. A spontaneous exothermic reaction initiated at around 25 °C,<br>
raising the reaction temperature to 49 °C. Once the exothermicity subsided, the reaction<br>
mixture was heated to a temperature of 45-50 °C for 1 h, applying heat as necessary to<br>
maintain the temperature.<br>
[0064] After this period of heating, the reaction mixture was cooled to 30-35 °C.<br>
[0065] While maintaining the temperature at 30-35 °C, about 50 g of 35% w/w aqueous<br>
hydrochloric acid were added until a pH of 5.0-5.5 was achieved. A peach-coloured<br>
suspension was observed to form during the addition.<br>
[0066] The suspension was then cooled to 5-10 °C and stirred at this temperature for 1 h.<br>
[0067] The suspension was filtered and the collected solid was washed with 14.54 g of<br>
cold 5% w/w aqueous sodium chloride solution followed by 14.54 g of cold water to yield<br>
20.19 g of wet, pale orange, crude pregabalin (LOD: 14.51%, estimated dry mass: 17.26 g,<br>
yield: 69.8%).<br>
[0068] In a 1 L, four neck, round-bottom reaction vessel, purged with nitrogen and<br>
equipped with a reflux condenser, 500 mL pressure-equalized addition funnel, thermometer<br>
and blade impeller, were added in sequence 18.09 g of wet pregabalin from the previous step<br>
(estimated dry mass: 15.47 g), 60.72 g of isopropanol and 54.15 g of water.<br>
[0069] The suspension was heated to reflux until complete dissolution occurred. A<br>
yellow solution was thus obtained. The solution was cooled further to 5-10 °C and then<br>
stirred at this temperature for 1 h.<br>
[0070] The suspension was filtered and the collected solid was washed with 5.5 g of<br>
water and 5.6 g of isopropanol to yield 14.49 g of wet, white pregabalin (LOD: 9.57%,<br>
estimated dry mass: 13.10 g, yield: 84.7%).<br>

[0072] In a 1 L, four-neck, round-bottom reaction vessel, purged with nitrogen and<br>
equipped with a reflux condenser, 500 mL pressure-equalized addition funnel, thermometer<br>
and blade impeller, were added in sequence 12.47 g of wet crude pregabalin from the<br>
previous stage (estimated dry mass: 11.28 g), 44.27 g of isopropanol and 56.39 g of water.<br>
[0073] The suspension was heated to reflux until complete dissolution occurred. A<br>
yellow solution was thus obtained. The solution was cooled to 5-10 °C and then stirred at this<br>
temperature for 1 h.<br>
[0074] The suspension was filtered and the collected solid was washed with 4.7 g of<br>
water 4.8 g of isopropanol to yield 10.66 g of wet, white pregabalin.<br>
[0075] The wet solid was dried at 60 °C under vacuum for 4 h to give 9.48 g of dry, white<br>
pregabalin (LOD: 11.07%, yield: 84.0%).<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
(0078] This example illustrates a process for preparing (S)-(+)-3-aminomethyl-5-methyl-<br>
1-hexanoic acid (i.e., pregabalin of Formula I) in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
invention.<br>
[0079] In a 1 L, four-neck, round-bottom reaction vessel, purged with nitrogen and<br>
equipped with a reflux condenser, 500 mL pressure-equalized addition funnel, thermometer<br>
and blade impeller, were added in sequence 12.00 g (0.064 mol) of compound of Formula II<br>
and 14.4 g of water.<br>
[0080] The mixture was stirred to give a thick suspension and cooled to 5-10 °C.<br>
[0081] 6.15 g (0.077 mol, 1.2 molar eq.) of 50% w/w sodium hydroxide solution were<br>
added dropwise onto the stirred suspension over a period of about 20 nun, maintaining the<br>
temperature at 5-10 °C. Once addition was complete, the mixture was stirred for an<br>
additional 20 min.<br>
[0082] In a separate 500 mL, three-neck, round-bottom reaction vessel, purged with<br>
nitrogen and equipped with a blade impeller, were added in sequence 70.24 g (0.083 mol, 1.3<br>
molar eq.) of 8.83% w/w aqueous sodium hypochlorite solution, 5.76 g of water and 8.64 g of<br>
50% w/w aqueous sodium hydroxide.<br>
[0083] The basic hypochlorite solution thus prepared was added dropwise from an<br>
addition funnel to the aqueous solution of compound of Formula II while maintaining the<br>
temperature at 5-10 °C.<br>
[0084J Once addition was complete, cooling was removed and the reaction was allowed<br>
to warm up while stirring. A spontaneous exothermic reaction initiated at around 25 °C,<br>
raising the reaction temperature to about 40 °C. Once the exothermicity subsided, the<br>
reaction mixture was heated to a temperature of 70±2 °C for 1 h, applying heat as necessary<br>
to maintain the temperature.<br>
[0085] After this period of heating, the reaction mixture was cooled to 30-35 °C.<br>
[0086] While maintaining the temperature at 30-35 °C, about 21 g of 35% w/w aqueous<br>
hydrochloric acid were added until a pH of 5.0-5.5 was achieved. A peach-coloured<br>
suspension was observed to form during the addition.<br>
[0087] The suspension was then cooled to 5-10 °C and stirred at this temperature for 1 h.<br>
[0088] The suspension was filtered and the collected solid was washed with 6.00 g of<br>
cold 5% w/w aqueous sodium chloride solution followed by 6.00 g of cold water to yield 6.94<br>
g of wet, pale orange, crude pregabalin (LOD: 14.44%, estimated dry mass: 5.94 g, yield:<br>
58.2%).<br>
[0089] In a 1 L, four-neck, round-bottom reaction vessel, purged with nitrogen and<br>
equipped with a reflux condenser, 500 mL pressure-equalized addition funnel, thermometer<br>
and blade impeller, were added in sequence 5.84 g of wet crude pregabalin from the previous<br>
stage (estimated dry mass: 4.99 g), 19.59 g of isopropanol and 17.47 g of water.<br>
[0090] The suspension was heated to reflux until complete dissolution occurred. A<br>
yellow solution was thus obtained. The solution was cooled to 5-10 °C and then stirred at this<br>
temperature for 1 h.<br>
[0091] The suspension was filtered and the collected solid was washed with 1.77 g of<br>
water and 1.80 g of isopropanol to yield 4.27 g of wet, white pregabalin.<br>
[0092] The wet solid was dried at 60 °C under vacuum to give 4.18 g of dry, white<br>
pregabalin (LOD: 2.00%, yield: 83.9%).<br>
[0093] Chromatographic purity (HPLC): pregabalin: 99.26%, impurity RRT 1.3: 0.01 %.<br>
[0094] These results demonstrate that a process in accordance with the invention can<br>
produce pregabalin of Formula I in high yield substantially free of impurities having a HPLC<br>
relative retention time of 1.3, wherein said impurities are present in 0.01 % after only a single<br>
crystallization from a mixture of isopropanol and water.<br>

and 67.66 g of water. The mixture was stirred to give a thick suspension and cooled to<br>
5-10 °C.<br>
[0097] 28.92 g (0.362 mol, 1.2 molar eq.) of 50% w/w sodium hydroxide solution were<br>

maintaining the temperature at 30-35 °C, about 92 g of 35% w/w aqueous hydrochloric acid<br>
were added until a pH of 5.0-5.5 was achieved. A peach-coloured suspension was observed<br>
to form during the addition.<br>
[0102] The suspension was then cooled to 5-10 °C and stirred at this temperature for 1 h.<br>
[0103] The suspension was filtered and the collected solid was washed with 28.19 g of<br>
cold 5% w/w aqueous sodium chloride solution followed by 28.19 g of cold water to yield<br>

step (estimated dry mass: 35.93 g), 141.03 g of isopropanol and 125.76 g of water.<br>
[0105] The suspension was heated to reflux until complete dissolution occurred. A<br>
yellow solution was thus obtained. The solution was cooled to 75-80 °C and filtered to<br>
remove insoluble particles. The solution was cooled further to 5-10 °C and then stirred at this<br>
temperature for 1 h.<br>
[0106] The suspension was filtered and the collected solid was washed with 28.21 g of<br>
isopropanol to yield 32.35 g of wet, white pregabalin.<br>
