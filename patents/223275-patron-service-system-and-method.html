CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/412.863, entitled IntelliChase® Personal Ordering System, filed on September 23, 2002, which is incorporated herein in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to systems and methods for providing services to patrons at resorts, stadiums, arenas, and other venues.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The world's leading luxury and upscale hotels, resorts, cruise lines, vacation destinations, and other public venues often differentiate themselves in a competitive market by promising and attempting to deliver exceptional service and convenience to their patrons, such as guests, customers, spectators, visitors, clientele, and other clients (hereinafter referred to collectively as "patrons"). Successfully delivering on the promise of outstanding service not only attracts repeat business, but can also generate greater revenue and increased profitability. At the same time, patrons that these properties attract have elevated expectations of service, including increased levels of attention, convenience, speed and control. The service delivery challenge for the resort is to attend quickly to patrons when the reqaire service, to fulfill patrons' requests in a timely and efficient manner, and finally to locate a patron for delivery of their order.<br><br>
Despite their high expectations, patrons at luxury and upscale resorts currently face several inconveniences in ordering food, beverages, and other amenities and services while on the beach, at the pool and in other areas of the property. In many instances when patrons desire to place an order they cannot find a staff member such as a server, a runner, a waiter, a waitress, beach attendant, recreational staff, an employee and other personnel (hereinafter referred to collectively as a "staff member") of an establishment in the vicinity. Often the patron is unable to attract the attention of the staff member, or the staff member may be busy attending to another patron. Additional problems arise once the order is taken, as the staff member may proceed to take additional orders before submitting initial patron's orders for fulfillment. The result is a delay in entering the initial orders to the resort's computer system (assuming there is a basic computer system) and thus delaying preparation of the order as well.<br>
If a patron becomes tired of waiting for a staff member to take the order,<br>
. the alternative is to walk, sometimes for great distances, to place an order for<br>
food, beverages, or services.   Not only are patrons inconvenienced, but they<br>
also face the risks  inherent in  leaving  children or personal  belongings<br>
unsupervised and unprotected on the beach, pool deck, or other resort location.<br>
Once the order is prepared and ready for delivery to the patron, it can be a challenge for the staff member to remember where the patron is located or to find where the patron has relocated. Oftentimes the person who took the order is often not the same person who delivers the order, or the patron has moved and is not seated where the original order was taken. The result is that patrons experience further delay in having their orders delivered.<br>
Once a the item (such as a towel, beverage, food) has been delivered to the patron, and the staff member departs, any problem with the order (i.e., missing utensils or condiments, erroneous or ill-prepared items, etc.) requires<br><br>
the patron to chase after the staff member, walk to a service area, or wait for the staff member to return.<br>
Additionally, since a staff member has no way to know if a patron is interested in ordering food or beverages, staff members may periodically "check-in with the patron as they circulate on the beach, pool, or other locations, which sometimes results in annoying disturbances for the patron, if the patron has no interest in placing an order.<br>
Furthermore, most resorts do not offer patrons the ability to purchase sundry items, reserve a tee time, tennis court, jet ski, or spa related appointments while seated at the beach oi pool.<br>
In an attempt to address some of the aforementioned problems, a hmited number of hotels are deploying centrally-located kiosks. Unfortunately, these systems require patrons to leave their seals and walk some distance to place an order at a kiosk location. Again, not only are the patrons inconvenienced, but they also face the risks inherent in leaving children or personal belongings unsuper\'ised and unprotected on the beach, pool deck, or other resort locadon when having to order from the kiosk location.<br>
Additionally, kiosks do not enable the staff member to locate the patron for delivery of the order, thus requiring additional effort and further inconvenience to the patron if the patron must retrieve the order himself. Furthermore, in many instances there may be a line of patrons waiting to use a particular kiosk creating a further inconvenient experience for patrons when they attempt to place an order for themselves.<br>
Some manufactures have introduced POS (point-of-sale) systems for use by staff at restaurants, which may include wireless handheld terminals, as an extension of the POS systems. These handheld terminals enable staff to input and manage patron orders at a distance. Unfortunately, these devices typically only allow the staff member, to take and transmit the order on behalf of the patron.   The patron must still wait for a staff member to arrive so that the<br><br>
patron may initiate an order. Additionally, these systems do not lend themselves in many areas of a resort. For example, there remains the problem of locating the patron in a pool or beach environment after the order is taken. This problem is further exacerbated when the staff member who look the order is not the same person who delivers the order. Thus, centrally-located kiosks for patron use and handheld POS devices for a staff member's use, both are of limited effectiveness and, thus do not fully address the problems of both the patron and the resort.<br>
The impact on the resort caused by these service failures is significant, and includes decreased patron satisfaction, higher costs through service inefficiencies, and missed opportunities to increase property revenues per patron, decreased repeat patron business, and decreased reputation/rating, etc.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
A patron service system and method is described herein with reference to several exemplary implementations.<br>
For example, in one described implementation, portable patron units are provided to patrons for use in a resort or other establishmenl. The portable patron units are mobile wireless devices that include interactive display screens. The portable patron units enable patrons to interact, order items, request services, browse information associated with the resort and/or other information, wirelessly. Portable staff units are provided to staff members for use in the resort or other establishment. The portable staff units are also mobile wireless devices that include interactive display screens. The portable staff units, enable staff members to view information about orders and/or requests entered by patrons made by the patrons wirelessly. The portable staff units can also display locations of the portable patron units to enable staff members to locate portable patron units when delivering items, servicing requests, etc.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Patron Service System<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary patron service system 100 suitable for use in a resort 101. As used herein a "resort," refers to hospitality venues, such as, but not limited to, hotels, motels, lodging centers, cruise ships, tennis resorts, camps, sld resorts, relaxation centers, inns, time-share communities, retirement communities, and any constituent parts of a particular resort, such as, but not limited to, restaurants, bars, pools, tennis courts, entertainment centers, ski slopes, beaches, spas, boating facilities, gift shops, retail locations, and so forth.<br>
Although patron service system 100 is described herein primarily in the context of being used in a resort, it should also be noted that patron service system 100 may be used in various other venues including, but not limited to, stadiums, arenas, retail locations, zoos, transportation centers, health care settings, convalescence centers, convention centers, country clubs, museums, gambling venues, sporting events, as well as any other entertainment, retail, and recreational environments.<br>
In one implementation, patron service system 100 is configured to service one or more patrons and staff members of resort 101.   Patron service<br><br>
system 100 may include one or more portable patron unit 102(1), ..., 102(N), one or more portable staff units 104(1), ..., 104(N), a central unit 106, and one or more fulfillment center computers 108(1), . . ., 108(N). Patron service system 100 may form at least a portion of a network 110.<br>
Portable patron unit, referred to generally as reference number 102, is provided to a patron to use at resort 101 while at a pool, beach, spa, deck, lounge, or any other areas associated with resort 101. Portable patron unit 102 is a rugged mobile computer device with an interactive display device 114. Portable patron unit 102 uses wireless technology to transmit and receive information from other devices associated with resort 101. Accordingly, from the comfort of the beach, a pool lounge chair, or other various locations, a patron may view extensive menus of items, services, information, etc. that may be ordered from a user interface displayed on display device 114 of portable patron unit 102. A patron may order food, beverages, services, and so forth, by entering information into their respective portable patron unit 102.<br>
In one implementation, portable patron unit 102 may be attached with a secure locking mechanism (not shown) to a patron's lounge chair, table, and so forth by a staff member of the resort. Alternatively, portable patron unit 102 may be carried by the patron or may be affixed to their person such as to a belt or wristband.<br>
Display device 114 typically displays a user interface (to be described in more detail), which is easy to use, yet allows a great degree of choice and flexibility in accessing information. The user interface is designed to require minimal training for the patron to begin using the system. The user interface may display extensive menus of items, services, information, etc. that can be ordered or accessed and may include descriptions, pricing information, or other details. Informtion, such as property announcements and promotions, weather conditions, activity updates, etc., may also be displayed to the patron at the discretion of resort 101.<br><br>
The user interface may enable patrons to rapidly order standard menu items, while also allowing for extensive order customization. The user interface may also display items that the patron had previously ordered during the day or vacation period, making it easy to replicate previous orders (e.g., order "another round"). Daily specials, cross-sell, up-sell and other recommendations based on the patron's choices and any other sales and convenience features may be included in the user interface. The portable patron unit 102 may also display information relating to the stams of any open order, open tab, etc. including the real-time status of any order and estimated time to that order's delivery.<br>
A patron may also use portable patron unit 102 to page a staff member, to receive personal attention from the staff member, request immediate delivery of a bill, etc. Portable patron units may also receive an electronic bill, permitting patrons lo enter credit card information, or other payment information without the need for a staff member to physically deliver the bill. Bills may also be generated automatically without the need for a bill request, depending on the system. Portable patron unit 102 may offer a patron the ability to play games, access the Internet, receive and send e-mail, conduct two-way conversations, watch videos, watch movies, listen to music, among other features. The ability to conduct two-way conversations may assist in allowing the patron or a staff member to better communicate with each other in the event there is a question about an order, such as with a custom meal order.<br>
A portable staff unit, referred to generally  reference number 104, is a durable mobile computer device with an interactive display device 116 that uses wireless technology to transmit and receive information from other devices associated with resort 101, such as central unit 106. Portable staff unit 104 is provided to a staff member (such as a server, a runner, a waiter, a waitress, beach attendant, recreational staff, an employee and other personnel associated with an establishment (hereinafter "staff member")) of resort 101<br><br>
enabling the staff member to service patrons. Portable staff. unit 104 may display information on patrons, including order status, which then can be used to service the patrons effectively and efficiently. For instance, portable staff unit 104 is configured to receive notification of open orders made by a patron including details of one or more pending orders. The portable patron unit 104 is designed to be mobile and carried with the staff member, such as with a serving uay, on a wristband, or affixed to a belt, etc.<br>
Portable staff unit 104 is capable of displaying information for the purpose of assisting the staff member to better service the patron. For instance, portable staff unit 104 may display a location of a particular portable patron unit 102. This feature may be useful in locating a patron that has placed an order or requested a service, so that a staff member can deliver the patron's order or service the request directly to the patron in an efficient and prompt manner. The portable staff unit 104 may also display information about the particular patron such as the patron's name, room number, previous orders, specific items ordered, billing status, preferences, special needs, and so forth. Such information may by useful to the staff member so they may address the patron by name and understand or anticipate the patron's needs, even without personally contacting the patron.<br>
Portable staff units 104 may also assist a staff member by displaying real-time information or actions perfoi-med by patrons on their portable patron units 102 as they are being performed, such as displaying the number of patrons browsing on their portable patron unit 102, displaying particular activities performed by a particular patron, etc. Such real-time information may prepare a staff member for future orders not yet received and give the staff member a head start on an order even though the patron may not have completed and submitted the order.<br>
Portable staff unit 104 may also receive page messages from a patron, indicating the name and location of a patron who requires immediate service or<br><br>
personal attention. Portable staff unit 104 may also be configured to perform all functions that a portable patron unit 102 can perform, such as placing an order, which allows a staff member to instantly transmit an order taken verbally if a patron prefers not to enter the order directly on the portable patron unit 102 or if a patron does not currently have a portable patron unit 102. A staff member can also "take over" an order from portable patron unit 102, and edit and transmit the order if a patron is having difficulty with the system.<br>
In terms of billing status, portable staff unit 104 can display open tabs, and when a patron has requested delivery of their bill, which can eliminate one of the more frustrating waiting periods in a patron's experience. In addition, a staff member can use portable staff unit 104 to. perform administrative and patron and service functions, such as transferring a patron to another portable patron unit 102 if, for example, the patron wishes to relocate from the beach to the pool and the portable patron unit is locked to a piece of furniture (assuming the patron does not simply carry the portable patron unit with them).<br>
Central unit 106 is typically a server side computer, which controls wireless communication among portable patron units 102 and portable staff unit 104, and distributes content to portable patron units 102 and portable staff units 104. Central unit 106 also may serve as a gateway to other resort systems such as Point-of-Sale management software running on central unit 106 or other computers.<br>
Central unit 106 typically receives and authenticates orders made by portable patron units 102 and then routes the orders to an appropriate fulfillment center computer 108(1), ..., 108(N) associated with a fulfillment center 109, such as a kitchen, bar, spa, gift shop, etc. Once the order is prepared, a staff member from the particular fulfillment center 109 alerts central«nit 106, typically via a fulfillment center computer 108, which in turn alerts one or more portable staff units 104 that the order is ready for pickup and deUvery to a patron.   Central unit 106 also may transmit other information to<br><br>
the portable patron units 102 such as advertisements, messages, resort information, Internet access, and other information that may be transmitted in response to a patron's request or without a specific patron's request. Central unit 106 also may maintain a database 112 including data associated with a history of transaction data, patron preferences, patron profiles, and various other information.<br>
One or more programmable software applications 130 may execute on central unit 106 (i.e., one or more servers) when handling and servicing requests from client devices, such as portable patron unit 102 and portable staff unit 104. Programmable software applications 130 may also reside on one or more client devices (such as portable patron unit 102, portable staff unit 104 and/or fulfillment center computer computers 108). As shall be described in further detail, components of programmable software applications 130 may be configured to perform any one of a variety of different services associated with patron service system 100. Examples of services include: login verification for patrons using portable patron units 102; notification to portable staff units 104 that an item ordered by a patron is ready for delivery from a fulfillment center 109 to a patfon; maintaining one or more databases 112 associated with patron service system 100; routing orders to appropriate fulfillment centers; providing food and drink menus to particular portable patron units 102; enabling patrons to order different items; and so on. The services can be combined with each other and with other applications to build intelligent interactive experiences on both the portable patron units 102 and portable staff units 104.<br>
Although only one central unit 106 is shown in the exemplary illustration, more than one central unit 106 may be deployed in patron service system 100. Additionally, some or all the functionality performed-by central unit 106, may be performed in a distributed fashion by one or more portable patron units 102, one or more portable staff units 104, and/or one or more fulfillment center computers 108.<br><br>
In one implementation, network 110 includes one or more Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity) hubs 111(1), 111(2), ..., lll(N) that are IEEE 802.11 standard protocol compatible, such as standard versions 802.Ub. S02.11g, etc. Accordingly, portable patron units 102, portable staff units 104, central computer 106, and fulfillment center computers 108 may communicate with network 110 wirelessly. Accordingly, portable patron units 102 and portable staff units 104 are configured to communicate with other devices wirelessly, allowing them to move freely in designated areas of an resort 101, such as the beach, pool, lounge, etc. Typically, these designated areas are located within a reception range of approximately 400 feet in any direction of the one or more wireless hubs (such as hubs 111(1), 111(2), ..., ni(N), which are referred to as "hot spots."<br>
Network 110 may also use one or more other types of wireless networks, such as Bluetooth compatible networks, or future technologies. Network 110 may also include a combination of wireless-based and wired/optical based communication links. For instance, portable patron units 102 and portable staff units 104 may use wireless hnks to receive and transmit data, whereas fulfillment center computers 108 may use wired or optical links to access and transmit data. Additionally, it may also be possible for various devices to communicate directly with other devices without using network 110 as a communication link. For example, it may be possible for portable patron unit 102(1) to communicate durectly with portable staff unit 104(1) via a wireless Unk 132. Network 110 may also include access to other networks, such as the Internet.<br>
Accordingly, portable patron units 102, portable staff units 104, central unit 106, and fulfillment center computers 108 are designed to either run or interface with one or more programmable software applications 130 that are<br><br>
programmable application components, that are reusable, and that interact pro grammatically over network 110 or through other communication links, typically dirough standard Web protocols, such as extensible raarkup language (XML), hypertext transport protocol (HTTP), and simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP). However, other means of interacting widi over network 110 may be used, such as simple object access protocol (SOAP), remote procedure call (RFC) or object broker type technology.<br>
Thus, patron service system 100 offers a comprehensive and integrated solution to meet the needs of both the patron and a resort. Patrons benefit from faster senice, greater control over their service, increased convenience, and improved personalized attention. Resort 101 benefits from flie ability to enhance the patron's experience and increase patron satisfaction, the opportunity to generate higher incremental revenues, and the savings from faster and more efficient operations.<br>
Exemplary patron service system 100 is only one example of a computing system and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of the system. Neither should patron service system 100 be inteipreted as having any dependency or requirement relating to any one or combination of components illustrated in the exemplary computing environment shown in Fig. 1.<br>
Having introduced exemplary patron service system 100 and its environments, it is now possible to describe patron service system 100 in more detail.<br><br>
Exemplary Portable Patron Unit<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates an exemplary portable patron unit 102. Portable patron unit 102 is typically a handheld device that may be carried by a patron, attached lo a pati-on's lounge chair, table, other furniture, or attached directly to the patron, such as the patron's belt or a wristband.<br>
An outer protective casing, referred to as packaging 202, is designed to be highly rugged, provide protection from the sun, saltwater, chlorine, sand, suntan lotion, spilled food, and/or drink. Such casiing provides protection for any or all components of portable patron unit 102. Packaging 202 may be made of any number of materials including, but not limited to, plastic, metal, and/or wood. For example, in one implementation, packaging 202 is constructed of injection-molded high-impact polycarbonate designed to meet the lEC 529 IP 54 standards for water and dust/sand protection and may be configured into various shapes and sizes.<br>
Portable patron unit 102 includes a display device 114, which in one exemplary implementation is a touch-screen display device, which enables a patron to select or enter information by shnply touching the screen. To provide excellent visibility to a patron, information is typically displayed large enough on display device 114 to enable a person suffering from mild myopia to view content on display device 114 without the aid of corrective lenses. For example, in one implementation display device 114 is a five-inch grayscale QVGA transflective, backlit touch-screen LCD (hquid crystal display) and font sizes are displayed big enough to readily view them on display device 114. Additionally, magnifying materials (not. shown) may be used in conjunction with display device 114 to enlarge content displayed therein. Various other types of display screens, sizes, and shapes may be chosen to implement display device 114. Additionally, display device 114 can be implemented without the<br><br>
benefit of touch-screen technology and rely on other types of input devices such as a keyboard, buttons, input pads, etc., to enter information into the portable patron unit 102.<br>
Portable patron unit 102 also may include audio generators (such as one or more speakers not shown) for dissemination of audio content. The audio content may be in various forms and may be in conjunction witii visual content.<br>
Other elements such as lights, LEDs, batteries, power supplies, charging connections, microphones, vibrating devices, antennae and so forth are also not shown in Fig. 2, but may be a part of the exemplary portable patron unit 102.<br>
Typically, portable patron unit 102 contains a control unit 201, which controls the operation of portable patron unit 102.   Control unit 201 includes<br>
one or more processors 206 (e.g., any of microprocessors, controllers, and the<br>

Such examples include a hard disk drive (not shown) for reading from and writing to a non-removable, nonvolatile magnetic media (not shown), a magnetic disk drive for reading from and writing to a removable, non-volatile magnetic disk (e.g., a "floppy disk"), or an optical disk drive for reading from and/or writing to a removable, nonvolatile optical disk (not shown) such as a CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, or other optical media.<br>
Memory. 406 and its associated computer-readable media provide nonvolatile storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, and other data for central unit 106. Other types of computer readable media which can store data that is accessible by a central unit 106 can also be<br><br>
utilized to implement memory 406, examples of such include flash memory cards, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, random access memories (RAM), read only memories (ROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and the like,.<br>
Any number of program modules can be stored m memory 406, including by way of example, an operating system 426, one or more application programs 130, other program modules 430, and program data 432. Each of such operating system 426, one or more application programs 130, other program modules 430, and program data 432 (or some combination thereof) may include an embodiment of application programs 130. Memory 406 may also include one or more databases 112 containing data and information enabling functionality associated with application programs 130. In one implementation, operating system 426 includes the Windows® XP operating system from Microsoft® Corporation. Other operating systems may be resident in memory 406 such as UNIX and/or Linux.<br>
A user can enter commands and information into central unit 106 via input devices such as a keyboard 434 and a pointing device 436 (e.g., a "mouse"). Other input devices 438 (not shown specifically) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, serial port, scanner, and/or the like. These and other input devices are connected to processor 404 via interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port, or a universal serial bus (USB). Staff members of a resort can enter programmable information into central unit 106 such as when updating and configuring menus, managing fdod and beverage menus, listing daily specials, defining serving zones of staff members, managing staff member assignments and deployment of portable staff units among staff members of resort 101, and<br><br>
other information to be displayed on eitlier portable patron units 102 or portable staff units 104.<br>
A monitor 442 or other type of display device can also be connected to (he central unit 106 via an interface, such as a video adapter 444. In addition to the monitor 442, other output peripheral devices can include components such as speakers i not shown) and a printer 446 which can be connected to central unit 106 via input/output interfaces (not shown).<br>
Central unit 106 can operate in a networked environment, or point-to-point environment, using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as ponable patron units 102, portable staff unit 104, fulfillment center computers 108, network 110, hubs 111, and so forth. A network interface or adapter 454 may provide access" to network 110, such as when network llQ is implemented as a LAN (local area network) or WAN (wide area network).<br>
In a networked environment, such as that illustrated in Fig. 4, program modules and progi'am applications 130 depicted relative to central unit 106, or portions thereof, may be stored in a remote memory storage device. By way of example, application programs 130 may reside on a memory device in portable patron unit 102, portable staff unit 104, etc. For purposes of illustration, application programs and other executable program components, such as the operating system, are illustrated herein as discrete blocks, although it is recognized that such programs and components reside at various times in different storage components remote or locate, and are executed by processor(s) of central unit 106 or remote devices.<br>
As mentioned above, memory 406 includes application programs 130 as well one or more databases 112. Application programs 130 that utilized by both portable patron units 102 and portable staff units 104 (such as appHcalion programs 224, 226, 227, 229, 326, 327, 329, and 331) are generally managed<br><br>
and controlled by central unit 106. Database 112 generally includes data and informaiion necessary to support application programs 130. For example, advertisement application 229 facilitates displaying promotional messages and/or advertisements on display device 114, Central unit 106 supplies the promotional messages and/or advertisements (the content) tc portable patron units 102 in conjunction with advertisement application 229.<br>
Accordingly, central unit 106 acts as a server to client devices such portable patron units 102 and portable staff units 104. In a server role, central unit 106 supplies content to portable patron units 102 and portable staff units 104. The content is stored in memory 406 in the form of data that may be maintained in one or more databases 112. In one implementation database 112 is maintained by a Microsoft's SQL server 2000, although other database management systems may be used, such as IBM's DB2 database software, or off-the-shelf database management systems from other companies such as Sybase, Informix, and so forth.<br>
Memory 406 includes several appUcation programs 130 particularly suited for central unit 106, and is used to potentially service other application programs or for providing management capability for central unit 106. For example memory 406 includes: a routing application 480, database application 482, a location apphcation 484, a staff-input application 486, and POS interface 488.<br>
Routing application 480 generally facilities receiving orders and/or requests from portable patron units 102 and routing them to a fulfillment center computer 108 responsible for handling the order and/or request.<br>
Database application 482 generally facilitates storing and maintaining data in one or more databases 112. For instance, database application 482 may maintain menu items including descriptions of the items, prices, photos, etc. in<br><br>
dalabase{s) 112. Database application 482 may also maintain a history of transaction data, patron preferences, etc. which can all be used for patron profile maintenance. Database application 482 may also maintain data associated with staff performance, such as the number of orders completed, time used to fulfill orders, etc. Typically, information maintained in one or more databases 112 may be accessed by various other program applications 130 when requested.<br>
Location application 484 facilitates locating portable patron devices 102 based on signals emitted by its control unit 201. Location application 484 may use 802.11 location finding technology to determine locations of portable patron devices 102 and relay their positions to portable staff units 104. In one implementation, location application 484 uses positioning technology developed by Ekahau, Inc. of Helsinki, Finland, such as Ekahau Positioning Engine' (EPE), which is a Java-based positioning program that provides location coordinates of portable devices such as portable patron units 102 and portable staff units 104. Utilizing EPE's engine would enable central unit 106 to determine the location of portable patron unit 102 accurate to within three and half feet of the unit's actual location both indoors and outdoors. Accordingly, once a portable patron unit 102 is logged onto the system 100 and emits a -wireless signal to hubs 111, central unit 106 would then be able to track the location of the portable patron unit 102 in real-time. This information can then be relayed to one or more portable staff units 104, which display the patron unit's location on a map associated with any area or zone being served by the portable staff units 104. Alternatively, global positioning technology could aho be used to track the location of portable patron units 102.<br>
Staff-input application 486 enables staff members of resort 101 to enter information into central unit 106, such as daUy specials, updates to menus,<br><br>
price changes, messages to staff members or patrons, security information, and so forth iliat is then stored in memory 406 (such as database 112) and may be utilized by applications 130.<br>
POS interface application 4SS facilitates integrating POS and hotel management systems with central unit 106. For instance, in one implementation POS interface application 488 includes Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that may serve as an interface layer between POS interface application 488and other POS and hotel management systems. Alternatively, direct interfaces may be used in the event API technology is not available with POS and hotel management systems.<br>
Thus, application programs 130 (i.e., 224, 226, 227, 229, 326, 327, 329, 331, 480, 482, 484, 486, 488) may execute on processor(s) 404 and can be stored as computer-executable instructions in memory 406 accessible by central unit 106. Although application programs 130 are illustrated and described as single applications or module(s), each can be implemented as one or more combined component applications, and can be fully or partially received from other devices.<br>
For purposes of illustration, programs and other executable program components such as the operating system are illustrated herein as discrete blocks, although it is recognized that such programs and components reside at various times in different storage components of central unit 106, or other components of patron service system 100, and may be executed by one or more processors that are not necessarily part of central unit 106.<br>
It should be noted that-central unit 106 may include other capabilities such as the ability to serve games, serve music, and/or videos to portable patron units 102.  Central unit 106 may also act as an IP router switch enabhng VoIP<br><br>
or Voice Over WiFi-capability between portable patron units 102 and other devices connected to network 110.<br>

Also depicted in display screen 600 is an advertisement 608. Advertisements are generally generated by a mode of operation associated with advertisement application 229. The advertisement generation correlates (i.e. is appurtenant) to the item viewed or ordered by the patron, which in this example relates to buying three frozen margaritas for the price of two. The advertisement could also correlate to a service requested. Another advertisement 610 may be displayed in conjunction with advertisement 608 (although it may be displayed separately). In this example, advertisement 610 is a promotion message detailing a happy hour special. Although not shown in this example, the advertisement could also be displayed on display screen 600 or other screens to cross-sell and/or up sell recommendations based on an item ordered and/or service requested by a patron. For instance, a cross-sell recommendation may include providing an alternative or competing brand of margarita mix or an alternative type of alcohol. An up sell recommendation may include offering a more expensive, promotional, or better quahty alcohol as an alternative to what the patron may have selected.<br>
Order another round icon 612 allows a patron to automatically order another round of drinks or other items previously ordered by selecting icon<br><br>
612. Selecting icon 613 may display items that the patron previously ordered during the day, making it easy to view previous order and order one or more items ba:ed on the logged history.<br>
Although not shown, display screen 600 may also include selection items enabling a patron to customize orders, select condiments, select preparation methods, select side dishes, etc. For instance, display screen 6O0 may display a flavor associated with a drink, the opdon to order the drink with or without salt, the option to order the drink with or without ice, and so forth. Each of the options presented typically relate to the item selected by the patron and can be tailored by a resort through the use of patron service system 100.<br>
