				<td>This invention relates to a snubberless inverter.<br>
An inverter is used for conversion of direct current (dc) supply to alternating current (ac) supply. The inverter normally uses self-turn-off devices, such as, gate-turn-off thyristors, insulated-gate-bipolar-transistors (IGBTs) etc. Presently, the IGBT has become the most common used device.<br>
An inverter commonly uses snubber circuit devices (consisting of resistors, capacitors and diodes) for protection of IGBTs during turn-on and turn-off. There are disadvantages associated with the use of snubber circuit device in an inverter.<br>
One of the main disadvantages is that the snubber circuit device occupy substantial space resulting in bulkier inverter.<br>
Another disadvantage of the present invention is that the snubber circuit consumes power and decrease the efficiency of inverter.<br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention is to provide a simple and effective device to protect the inverter during turn on and turn off of the inverter and replace the snubber circuit device.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a device for the IGBT-based inverter which would result in a compact inverter.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a device for the IGBT-based inverter where the heat generated by the IGBTs is effectively dissipated to keep the temperature rise of IGBTs with in permissible limits.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a device for the IGBT-based inverter where the discharge resistors for d.c. link capacitors are so assembled so as to result in a compact inverter assembly.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a snubberless inverter characterized in that a plurality of IGBTs mounted on a heat sink, the ac terminals of the IGBTs being connected to busbars projecting on wards through slots in a fibre-glass sheet, the positive terminals of the IGBTs being connected to positive busbar, the negative terminals of the IGBTs being connected to negative busbar, a plurality of capacitors being fixed to the fibre-glass sheet, their positive terminals being connected to the positive busbar, their negative terminals being connected to the negative busbar, a discharge resistance is connected between busbars to effectively discharge the capacitors when the input dc supply to the inventer is disconnected.<br>
The nature of  the  invention,   its objective and further  residing   in  the  same will  be apparent   from  the ensuing  description made with  reference to non-limiting exemplary  embodiments of the  invention  represented   in  the accompanying drawing  as given below:<br>

busbars;<br>

Fig.   4	Complete assembly of  the  IGBT-based  inverter.<br>
Fig.  1   depicts the part-assembly,   showing  the  fixing (on  the heat  sink)   of  IGBTs,   blower,   and  outgoing  ac busbars. First/   a proper heat  sink  (1)   is  selected  for  the assembly of  inverter.  The  specification  of  heat  sink   (1)   and blower (2)   are  selected  such  that  the heat   sink  can  dissipate  the heat  generated by the  IGBTs  during   full-load operation.The length  of       heat   sink  is decided so  that  it   can  also accommodate  the  total number  of  IGBTs   (3)   required  to  obtair the  inverter  configuration.     For example/   the assembly<br>
taken   for  explaining  the present   invention   is  for the case of a  three-phase bridge  inverter using  three number of   IGBT modules,   each  having   two  IGBTs with   two     built-in freewheeling  diodes in   it.  Each  IGBT   is  suitably   fixed on  the heat   sink/  with  adequate spacing   inbetween  any  two IGBTs.  The blower  is  fixed atone end  of  the heat   sink/ such  that   its  exhaust  just  fits over the  complete   face of  the heat   sink.  When  the  supply  is  given  to  the blower/ it   throws  air over the heat  sink fins   from the blower-end to  the other  end,  A  copper busbar   (4)   connected  to  the ac terminal  of  each   IGBT     is  taken out   though  a  slot  provided in  the  fibre  - glass sheet   (5)   fixed  at one  side of  the heat sink and  forms one ac terminal  of  the  IGBT  inverter.<br>
Fig.  2   shows the part-assembly,   explaining mainly  the fixing  arrangement  of the  capacitors  and  connections between the positive  terminals of  the  IGBTs and  the positive  terminals of  the dc  link  capacitors.  The  capacitors  (6)   are  first assembled   (   by means of  suitably clamps  and  fixing   screws) on  the  fibre-glass sheet    (5).     The  fibre -glass     sheet   (5)   is fixed  on  one   face of  the heat   sink   (1)   in  such  a way     that the negative  terminals of  the  capacitors   (6)   are  just  above the negative  terminals  of  the  IGBTs   (3).     The voltage and current   ratings of the  capacitors and  the number of  capacitors are selected  to  suit     the  voltage and  current   ratings of  the IGBT   inverter.   The assembly   in  Fig.   2   shows only   three<br>
capacitors  in  parallel.  But,   in  case there   is  a  requirement of  two  capacitors  in  series,   then one more  row  can  be  fixed<br>
on   the  fibre-glass   (5)   taken  of an   increased height   above the  first  row,   and  the positive terminals of the  first  row capacitors are  connected by  copper links  to  the negative terminals    of  the  second  row  capacitors  to give  series connection.  A  broad  copper busbar is  taken  and  bent  at   right angle.  One horizontal   face   (7a)   of  this  copper busbar  is made to  connect  all  the negative terminals of  the  IGBTs/ while the  other vertical   face   (7b)   of  the  copper busbar connects all  the negative  terminals  of  the  capacitors.     Thus/ one    single  copper busbar piece connects all the negative terminals of  the  IGBTs  and   capacitors.<br>
Fig.  3   is  the part-assembly,   explaining mainly  the inter-connections  of  the positive terminals of  IGBTs  and capacitors.  A  copper busbar  (8a)   interconnects all  the positive terminals of  IGBTs  (3). Another  copper busbar   (8a)<br>
interconnects  all  the    positive    terminals     of     capacitors<br>
(6).  A  third busbar  (8c)   connects the positive busbar(8b)of<br>
capacitors    with  the positive busbar (8a)of  IGBTs  <br>
Fig.  4  shows the  complete assembly  of  all  the  components of   IGBT- based  inverter.   Item   9   is a  discharge resistor/ connected between  the positive busbar   (8b)   and  negative busbars     (7b)   of  capacitors  (6)   for     discharging  the capacitors when  the  input   dc  supply  to  the  inverter  is disconnected.    The discharge  resist or  is designed   for  dissi-<br>
pating the maximum capacitor voltage in a short  period but the resistance should be high enough so that the continuous power loss in the discharge resistor ia kept as small as possible.<br>
From the  above mentioned description of Figures 1 to 4/ the assembly of capacitors and the busbar connections of capacitors to the positive and negative terminals of IGBTs in the present invention is so made that the loop inductance between the capacitors and the IGBTs is made negligibly small . This has made it possible to operate the IGBT- based inverter assembled as per the present invention without the use of snubber components resulting in a compact  and highly efficient inverter.<br>
The invention described hereinabove is in relation to a non-limiting embodiment and as defined by the accompanying claims.<br><br><br><br><br>
