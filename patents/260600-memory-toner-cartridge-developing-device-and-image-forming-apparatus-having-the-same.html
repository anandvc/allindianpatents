2. APPLICANT:<br>
Name: Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.<br>
Nationality: Republic of Korea<br>
Address: 416, Maetan-dong, Yeongtong-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea.<br><br>
3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION:<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001]     This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง 119 from Korean Patent Application  No.   10-2008-0016472,   filed  on  February  22,  2008,  in  the  Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] Aspects of the present invention relate to an image forming apparatus, and more particularly, to a replaceable toner cartridge having a memory, a developing cartridge, a developing device, and an image forming apparatus having the same.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
[0003]     General image forming apparatuses such as, e.g., printers, copy machines,<br>
fax machines, or multifunctional peripherals print images on printing media using a<br>
quantity of toner.<br>
[0004]     The more pages are printed, the more toner is consumed, and thus the toner<br>
needs to be periodically replenished. The toner may be accommodated in a developing<br>
cartridge removably installed in the body of the image forming apparatus, together with<br>
other components, e.g., a developing roller and/or a supply roller.<br>
[0005]     To replenishing toner, when the entire developing cartridge is replaced, not<br>
only the toner, but also other components, such as, e.g., the developing roller and/or<br>
supply roller are also replaced, causing the cost of operational and/or maintenance cost<br>
2<br><br>
of the image forming apparatus to increase.<br>
[0006]     The developing cartridge may include a memory such as, e.g.. a customer<br>
replaceable unit monitor (CRUM), that stores information that can be used to determine,<br>
for example, whether the developing cartridge is mounted, the amount of toner<br>
remaining, and/or other printing related information.<br>
[0007]     As various internal components and the driving mechanism to drive these<br>
internal  components are also disposed in  or about the developing cartridge,  the<br>
placement of the memory device, e.g., a CRUM, at a location that does not contribute<br>
greatly to the overall size of the developing cartridge and/or the image forming<br>
apparatus, and that also allows the memory device to transmit and/or receive signals to<br>
and/or from the image forming apparatus, is desirable.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0008]     Aspects of the present invention will be more apparent from the descriptions of embodiments herein with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: [0009]     FIG. 1 is a perspective illustrating the mounting of a developing device an image forming apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention; [0010]     FIG. 2 is a sectional view illustrating the developing device of FIG. 1; [0011]     FIGS. 3A and 3B are perspective views illustrating the mounting of a toner cartridge in a developing cartridge according to an embodiment of the present invention; and<br>
[0012]     FIG. 4 is a sectional view showing the relevant internal features of a toner cartridge mounted in a developing cartridge according to an embodiment of the present<br>
3<br><br>
invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SEVERAL EMBODIMENTS [0013] Certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. [0014] In the following description, the same drawing reference numerals are used for the same elements even in different drawings. While the foregoing embodiments are described with detailed construction and elements to assist in a comprehensive understanding of the embodiments, it should be apparent however that the embodiments can be carried out without those specifically detailed particulars. Also, well-known functions or constructions will not be described in detail so as to avoid obscuring the description with unnecessary detail.<br>
[0015] FIG. 1 is a perspective view showing a developing device being mounted in an image forming apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 1, an image forming apparatus 1 may include a body 10 and a developing device 100.<br>
[0016] The body 10 (only an outline of which is shown) may includes parts to performing operations to print an image on a printing medium transferred along a printing path including, for example, a feeding unit, fusing unit, and/or transferring unit, or the like. Functions of these parts housed in the body 10 for printing an image are well known to those skilled in the art, so a detailed description is omitted here for the sake of brevity.<br>
4<br><br>
[0017] FIG. 2 is a sectional view illustrating the developing device 100 shown FIG. 1. The developing device 100 may include a developing cartridge 110 and a toner cartridge 120.<br>
[0018] The developing cartridge 110 may be detachably supported in the body 10 of the image forming apparatus 1. More specifically, the inside of the body 10 may be accessed by opening a cover 11 as shown in FIG. 1, allowing the developing cartridge<br>
110	to enter the body 10 in the direction indicated by arrow Al, and to be mounted<br>
within a casing 12 of the body 10.<br>
[0019] A handle 112 to be grasped by a user may be formed on the developing cartridge 110 so as to make the extraction of the developing cartridge 110 easier. The handle 112 may be folded toward the developing cartridge 110 when the developing cartridge 110 is mounted in the body 10, and may be unfolded from the developing cartridge 110 when the developing cartridge 110 is to be detached from the body 10, so the user can conveniently grasp the handle 112. As shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B, according to an embodiment, one end of the handle 112 may be pivotally fixed to the developing cartridge 110, so the opposite end of the handle 112 may rotate. [0020] The developing cartridge 110 may include a developing cartridge body 111 having the external appearance shown in FIGS. 2 and 3. The developing cartridge body<br>
111	may support therein a photo conductive medium 20, a developing roller 113 and a<br>
supply roller 114. The developing roller 113 develops a latent image of the<br>
photoconductive medium 20 using toner, and the supply roller 114 supplies the toner to<br>
the developing roller 113.<br>
5<br><br>
[0021]     In this embodiment, the photoconductive medium 20 is housed in the<br>
developing cartridge 110, but this is merely an example.   As it should be apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art. the photoconductive medium 20 may alternatively be provided<br>
separately on the image forming apparatus body 10 rather than in the developing<br>
cartridge body 111.<br>
[0022]     The developing cartridge 110 according to an embodiment may be inserted<br>
into the casing 12 in the direction indicated by the arrow Al (see FIG. 1), which may be<br>
substantially perpendicular to the rotating shafts 113a and 114a of the developing roller<br>
113 and the supply roller 114, and may be mounted in the casing 12. Accordingly, both<br>
side edges of the developing cartridge 110 may be supported in place between the<br>
casing 12 and the image forming apparatus body 10.<br>
[0023]     According to an embodiment, the developing cartridge body 111 may itself<br>
accommodate a quantity of toner, so as to allow a number of pages to be printed even<br>
without a supply of toner from the toner cartridge 120.<br>
[0024]     The toner cartridge 120 may be detachably supported in the developing<br>
cartridge 110. To this end, a recess 117 to house the toner cartridge 120 may be formed<br>
in the developing cartridge body 111.<br>
[0025]     The  recess   117   is   formed   in  the  developing  cartridge   110  with  a<br>
predetermined depth so that the toner cartridge 120 may be inserted in the direction<br>
indicated by arrow Bl (see FIG. 3 A), which may be substantially parallel to shafts 113a<br>
and 114a of the developing roller 113 and the supply roller 114.<br>
6<br><br>
[0026] The direction indicated by the arrow A!, in which the developing cartridge 110 is mounted in the body 10 of the image forming apparatus 1. may be referred to hereinafter as the first direction, and the direction indicated by the arrow Bl. in which the toner cartridge 120 is mounted in the developing cartridge 110, may be referred to as the second direction.<br>
[0027] Guide grooves 117a and 117b may be formed in the recess 117 in order to guide the toner cartridge 120 to be mounted as shown in FIG. 3A. Mounting guides 124 and 125 corresponding to the guide grooves 117a and 117b may be formed on the toner cartridge 120 as shown in FIG. 2. In this embodiment, two guide grooves 117a and 117b are formed on both surfaces of the recess 117. and two mounting guides 124 and 125 corresponding to two guide grooves 117a and 117b are formed in the toner cartridge 120, but the number of guide grooves and mounting guides is not so limited, and only one of each or more than two of each may alternatively be provided. [0028] A blocking member (not shown) corresponding to the recess 117 may be mounted in the recess 117 in order to prevent the toner accommodated in the developing cartridge body 111 from leaking out when the toner cartridge 120 is not housed in the developing cartridge 110.<br>
[0029] A toner transferring member 122 may be rotatably mounted within the toner housing 121 containing the toner as shown in FIG. 4, and may supply the toner to the developing cartridge body 111. The toner transferring member 122 transfers the toner toward a toner supply opening 123 (referring to FIG. 2) formed on the bottom surface of the toner cartridge 120.<br>
7<br><br>
[0030] The toner contained in the toner housing 121 of the toner cartridge 120 is transferred to the toner supply opening 123 by the toner transferring member 122, then to the developing cartridge body 111 through the toner supply opening 123. and in tum sequentially to the supply roller 114, and to the developing roller 113, which uses the toner to develop a latent image formed on the photoconductive medium 20. According to an embodiment, first and second agitating members 115 and 116 may be rotatably mounted in the developing cartridge body 111 in order to agitate the toner prior to supplying the toner to the supply roller 114. While two agitating members are shown and described, the number of the agitating member(s) is not so limited, and any number of agitating members may alternatively be provided.<br>
[0031] The developing roller 113, the supply roller 114, and the first and second agitating members 115 and 116 are provided in the developing cartridge 110 to sequentially transfer the toner in the developing cartridge 110.<br>
[0032] When the toner cartridge 120 is mounted in the developing cartridge body 111, the transferring member 122 may be driven by a driving mechanism provided in the developing cartridge 110. The driving force may be transferred to the toner transferring member 122 at the leading end 120a, which is inserted first into the recess 117 based on the direction Bl, in which the toner cartridge 120 is inserted into the recess 117.<br>
[0033] A driven shaft 122a of the toner transferring member 122 protrudes from the front end 120a of the toner cartridge 120 as shown in FIG. 4. The driven shaft 122a is coupled to a driving shaft 110a of the developing cartridge body lll(e.g., through<br>
8<br><br>
engagement of one or more gears), thereby the toner transferring member 122 thereby receives the driving force.<br>
[0034] According to an embodiment, the toner transferring member 122 may receive the driving force, e.g., from the developing roller 113 and/or the supply roller 114 formed in the developing cartridge body 111 through a gear train (not shown). [0035] A memory 130 is mounted in the toner cartridge 120 for use in determining the condition of the toner cartridge 120. The memory 130 is capable of transmitting and/or receiving signals to and/or from the image forming apparatus 1 to allow the determination of, e.g., whether the toner cartridge 120 is mounted in the developing cartridge 110, the toner consumption, printing related information, or the like. [0036] The memory 130 may be disposed at such location to be accessible from a surface of the toner cartridge 120 that is exposed externally from the developing cartridge body 111 when the toner cartridge 120 is mounted in the recess 117, so that a signal communication may be established between the memory 130 and the image forming apparatus 1.<br>
[0037] For example, according to an embodiment, the memory 130 (or the access terminals thereof) may be disposed on the surface of the trailing end 120b of the toner cartridge 120 that trails the leading end 120a during mounting with respect to the direction indicated by the arrow Bl, the trailing end 120b being exposed to the exterior of the developing cartridge body 111 when the toner cartridge 120 is properly mounted in the recess 117.<br>
9<br><br>
[0038] The memory 130 may include a plurality of terminals 131. 132. 133 and 134, which may be arranged, each with a predetermined length along the direction parallel to the direction of the arrow Al, and may make contact with contact 13 (e.g., a number of contacts each corresponding to one of the terminals 131, 132, 133, 134 - for brevity sake collectively referred to as the contact 13) formed in the body 10 of the image forming apparatus 1. The contact 13 may be formed along a direction parallel to the direction in which the developing cartridge 110 is mounted, and may be, e.g., a plate spring of a predetermined length that protrudes into the casing 12. [0039]     According to an embodiment, at least one of the plurality of terminals 131,<br>
132,	133 and 134 may be made to be longer than the others. The longest terminal may<br>
be, e.g., a ground terminal.<br>
[0040] The plurality of terminals 131,132, 133 and 134 in FIGS. 3A and 3B are referred to below as first to fourth terminals. The first terminal 131 may be used as a common collector voltage (Vcc) terminal to supply power, the second terminal 132 may be used as a data and/or control transmission terminal, the third terminal 133 may be used as a clock terminal to receive clock signals, and the fourth terminal 134 may be used as a ground terminal. The fourth terminal 134 may be longer than the other terminals 131, 132 and 133, and may be placed below the other terminals 131, 132 and<br>
133.	The fourth terminal 134 extends further than the other terminals 131, 132 and 133<br>
in the direction indicated by arrow A1, so as to first contact the contact 13 attached to<br>
the body 10 of the image forming apparatus 1 when the developing cartridge 110 is<br>
mounted.<br>
10<br><br>
[0041] According to an embodiment, an oblique surface 135 may be provided as being sloped in the direction indicated by the arrow A1 to absorb the impact between the memory 130 and the contact 13 when the developing cartridge 110 is mounted in the body 10 of the image forming apparatus 1 as shown in FIG. 3B. The oblique surface 135 may act to reduce the impact between the terminals 131, 132. 133, 134 and the contact 13 when the developing cartridge 110 is mounted.<br>
[0042] When the developing cartridge 110 is mounted in the body 10 in the direction indicated by the arrow Al, the oblique surface 135 presses the contact 13, which may be, e.g., a plate spring protruding towards the casing 12, so that the contact 13 gradually retracts due to the slope of the oblique surface 135 before contacting the terminals 131, 132, 133 and 134.<br>
[0043] That is, the oblique surface 135 may be used to gradually press in the contact 13 as the developing cartridge 110 is being mounted in the body 10 of the image forming apparatus 1. To that end, the oblique surface 135 may be disposed at the upstream of the memory 130 with respect to the direction of the arrow Al, so that the oblique surface 135 may press the contact 13 prior to the terminals 131, 132, 133 and 134 coming into contact with the contact 13.<br>
[0044] When the developing cartridge 110 housing the toner cartridge 120 is inserted in the body 10, with the above described arrangements, the memory 130 disposed on the toner cartridge 120 makes an electrical connection with the contact 13, and is able to transmit signals to and/or receive signals from the image forming apparatus 1.<br>
11<br><br>
[0045]     The process of replacing the developing device of the  image  forming<br>
apparatus 1 according to .an embodiment of the present invention will be explained with<br>
reference to FIGS. 1 to 4.<br>
[0046]     When the toner cartridge 120 needs to be replaced, e.g., when the toner is<br>
exhausted, the user detaches the developing cartridge 110 from the casing 12 in the<br>
direction indicated by the arrow A2 as shown in FIG. 1.<br>
[0047]     The user then detaches the empty toner cartridge 120 in the direction<br>
indicated by the arrow B2 as shown in FIG. 3 A, and inserts a new toner cartridge 120<br>
filled with a supply of toner into the developing cartridge body 111 along the recess 117<br>
in the direction indicated by the arrow Bl.<br>
[0048]     When the toner cartridge 120 is completely mounted in the recess 117, the<br>
memory 130 disposed on a trailing end 120b of the toner cartridge 120 is exposed to the<br>
exterior of the toner cartridge body 111 through the recess 117 as shown in FIG. 3B.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the driven shaft 122a is engaged with the driving shaft 110a,<br>
thereby driving the toner transferring member 122.<br>
[0049]     The developing cartridge 110 with the new toner cartridge 120 mounted<br>
enters the body 10 in the direction indicated by the arrow Al in FIG. 1, and is mounted<br>
in the casing 12 of the body 10. The plurality of terminals 131, 132, 133 and 134 are<br>
parallel to the arrow Al, and are formed having a predetermined length, so the memory<br>
130 establishes a contact with the body 10.<br>
[0050]     The plurality of terminals 131, 132, 133 and 134 contact the contact 13, so<br>
the information regarding, e.g., whether the toner cartridge 120 is mounted, the amount<br>
12<br><br>
of remaining toner, or printing information may be transferred to the body 10 of the<br>
image forming apparatus 1.<br>
[0051]     According to an embodiment of the present invention, a replaceable toner<br>
cartridge that can be detachably installed in the developing cartridge, the replaceable<br>
toner cartridge including a memory, which is accessible through terminal or terminals<br>
disposed on the surface of the exposed end of the toner cartridge that remains exposed<br>
when the toner cartridge is installed in the developing cartridge.<br>
[0052]     According to an embodiment, the developing cartridge may be detachably<br>
mounted in an image forming apparatus. When the developing cartridge is mounted in<br>
place in the image forming apparatus, the terminal or terminals for accessing the<br>
memory come(s) in contact with contact terminal provided in the image forming<br>
apparatus so as to establish signal communication between the memory and the image<br>
forming apparatus.<br>
[0053]     Furthermore, the toner cartridge may house therein a toner transfer member<br>
that is driven from the opposite end to the exposed end.<br>
[0054]     The   foregoing   exemplary   embodiments   and   advantages   are   merely<br>
exemplary and are not to be construed as limiting the present invention.   The present<br>
teaching can be readily applied to other types of apparatuses.  Also, the description of<br>
the exemplary embodiments of the present invention is intended to be illustrative, and<br>
not to limit the scope of the claims, and many alternatives, modifications, and variations<br>
will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
