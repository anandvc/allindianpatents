DESCRIPTION<br>
TEMPERATURE CONTROL UNIT FOR<br>
ELECTROPHOTOGRAPHIC PHOTOCONDUCTOR SUBSTRATE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a temperature control<br>
unit for a substrate of an electrophotographic photoconductor.<br>
Background Art<br>
In recent years, an organic photoconductor (OPC) has<br>
replaced an inorganic photoconductor, and has been commonly<br>
used for a copying machine, a facsimile, a laser printer, or a<br>
complex machine combining thereof in view of its excellent<br>
performances and various advantages. The main reasons<br>
therefore are, for example, (a) optical characteristics thereof such<br>
as a wide wavelength region and large quantity of light<br>
absorption, (b) electrical characteristics thereof such as high<br>
sensitivity and stable charging ability, (c) a wide range of<br>
selections for a material to be used, (d) easy production, (e) low<br>
cost, (f) no hazards, and the like.<br>
In addition to the above, the diameter of the<br>
photoconductor has been more and more downsized along with<br>
the downsizing of the image forming devices, and highly resistant<br>
photoconductor has been strongly desired in view of high-speeded<br><br>
6<br>
operation and maintenance-free for the device. From, this point<br>
of view, the organic photoconductor has disadvantages such that<br>
it is generally soft as the main components of the surface layer<br>
thereof are a low molecular charge transport material and an<br>
inactive polymer, the abrasions are prone to occur due to the<br>
physical loads from the developing system or cleaning system at<br>
the time of repeated use in the process of the electrophotography.<br>
In addition, the increase in the hardness of the rubber of the<br>
cleaning blade and the increased contact pressure are necessary<br>
as the diameters of the toner particles are more and more<br>
downsized for the purpose of achieving the high image quality.<br>
These are other factors to accelerate the wearing of the<br>
photoconductor. Such the wearing of the photoconductor leads<br>
the deterioration of the sensitivity, deterioration of the electric<br>
characteristics such as lowing of the chargability, lowing of the<br>
image density, and the generation of defective images such as<br>
background depositions. Moreover, the scratches from the<br>
partially caused wearing lead images of lined depositions due to<br>
the cleaning failure. Under the current circumstances, the<br>
life-long of the photoconductor is limited as a result of this<br>
wearing or scratches, and the replacement thereof becomes<br>
necessary.<br>
Accordingly, it is necessary to reduce the amount of the<br>
aforementioned wearing in view of the achievement of the highly<br><br><br><br><br>
durable organic photoconductor, and this is an urgent problem to<br>
be solved in this field.<br>
As the technique which improves the abrasion resistance<br>
of the photoconductive layer, (1) the technique which uses a<br>
curable binder resin in the surface layer (for example, refer to<br>
Patent Literature 1), (2) the technique which uses a<br>
macromolecular charge transporting material (for example, refer<br>
to Patent Literature 2), and (3) the technique in which inorganic<br>
fillers are dispersed in the surface layer (for example, refer to<br>
Patent Literature 3) are proposed. Among these techniques, the<br>
technique (1) using the curable binder resin tends to increase the<br>
residual potential and thus lowers the image density due to the<br>
impurities such as unreacted residual groups, as the<br>
compatibility of the charge transporting material and the<br>
polymerization initiator is poor. Moreover, the technique (2)<br>
using the macromolecular charge transporting material and the<br>
technique (3) dispersing the inorganic fillers are capable of<br>
improving the abrasion resistance at a certain degree, but such<br>
abrasion resistance is not sufficient enough to achieve the degree<br>
required for the organic photoconductor. Furthermore, the<br>
technique (3) dispersing the inorganic fillers increases the<br>
residual potential due to the trap present on the surfaces of the<br>
inorganic fillers, and thus the image density is prone to be<br>
lowered. The techniques (1), (2) and (3) have not sufficiently<br><br><br><br>
achieved the total resistance including the electrical resistance<br>
and physical resistance required for the organic photoconductor.<br>
As an alternative technique for improving the abrasion<br>
resistance of the photoconductor to the above, it has been known<br>
the technique such that a charge transporting layer is formed by<br>
using a coating liquid containing a monomer having a OC double<br>
bond, a charge transporting material having a OC double bond,<br>
and a binder resin (for example, refer to Patent Literature 4).<br>
The abrasion resistance and the electric characteristics are<br>
significantly improved especially by disposing, as a surface layer,<br>
a crosslinked resin layer which is formed by curing at least a tri-<br>
or more functional radical polymerizable monomer having no<br>
charge transporting structure and a radical polymerizable<br>
compound having a charge transporting structure by UV<br>
radiation (for example, refer to Patent Literatures 5, 6, and 7).<br>
In the crosslinked resin layer, three-dimensional crosslinkages<br>
are formed as a result that the coated layer of the tri- or more<br>
functional radical polymerizable monomer having no charge<br>
transporting structure and the radical polymerizable compound<br>
are irradiated with a UV light. However, if a cylindrical<br>
substrate is exposed with the UV light, the cylindrical substrate<br>
will have an extremely high temperature due to such the light<br>
energy and heat of the reaction at the time of crosslinking.<br>
Although the appropriate increase of the temperature smoothly<br><br><br><br>
proceed with the crosslinking reaction, the extreme increase of<br>
the temperature may lead the deterioration of the electric<br>
characteristics, and thus the temperature of the cylindrical<br>
substrate needs to be controlled.<br>
It has been known the technical concept of the broad sense,<br>
such that a substrate for a photoconductor is cooled at the time of<br>
producing an electrophotographic photoconductor by coating<br>
various coating liquids, drying the coated films, and then curing<br>
the films. For example, Patent Literature 8 discloses that the<br>
substrate of hollow tube is cooled by externally blowing a cooled<br>
air at the time of dip-coating and drying the substrate of the<br>
photoconductor in the manufacturing process of the<br>
electrophotographic photoconductor. Patent Literature 9<br>
discloses that the substrate drum is cooled by introducing a gas<br>
or liquid for cooling into the chuck which fix, support and moves<br>
the substrate drum while griping. Patent Literature 10<br>
discloses that the cylindrical substrate is cooled by inserting the<br>
small cylindrical tube having the cooling water supplying tube<br>
and the cooling water releasing tube into the hollow space of the<br>
cylindrical substrate. In these conventional techniques, the<br>
problems such as the depositions from the ultra fine suspended<br>
substances generated in a cooling medium as a result of the direct<br>
contact of the cooling medium with the surface of the substrate<br>
material, time-loss caused by blast drying the wet cooling<br><br><br>
medium, the stains on the inner wall of the cylindrical tube as the<br>
marks of fine droplets, depositions of the dirt contained in the<br>
blast, and the like are not taken into consideration. Although it<br>
is presumed to achieve the good heat transfer efficiency as a<br>
result of the direct contact and the uniform cooling, however,<br>
those techniques still remains the aforementioned problems to be<br>
solved. Therefore, it has been desired to solve various problems<br>
due to the direct contact of the cooling medium, as well as<br>
achieving the uniform cooling and high efficiency of the cooling.<br>
For example, if the substrate is placed in the resting state, it may<br>
not cause an extreme defect such as a drip of the liquid, but<br>
uneven drying or curing of the coated film, or partially uneven<br>
cooling may be occur.<br>
Patent Literature 11 discloses that the cooling device is<br>
formed from an elastic material such as a rubber, whose shape is<br>
enlarged and expanded once it is inserted inside a cylindrical<br>
substrate, and the cooling device is inserted in the cylindrical<br>
substrate, and the liquid is poured into the cooling device to<br>
thereby cool the cylindrical substrate. However, the cylindrical<br>
substrate cannot be cooled while being rotated in accordance with<br>
this method. Moreover, the elastic body is not used simply to<br>
introduce a refrigerant, but to press using a pressure control<br>
valve. The chucking part thereof is not connected with the<br>
elastic body, the temperature thereof cannot be controlled if the<br><br><br>
UV light is irradiated thereto, and the temperature of the<br>
chucking part becomes high. Moreover, Patent Literature 10<br>
does not disclose any special consideration for the even cooling<br>
and the improvement of the cooling efficiency by uniformly<br>
contacting the elastic material to the inner wall of the cylindrical<br>
substrate in accordance with a simple method.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be precisely<br>
described with reference to the drawings.<br>
The temperature control unit of the present invention<br>
contains a membrane member which is fixed on, or detachably<br>
attached to an entire inner wall of a cylindrical substrate that<br>
has a coated layer and is exposed to energy externally applied<br>
from a heating element, wherein a refrigerant is introduced into<br><br><br>
a inner part of the membrane member and is configured to control<br>
a surface temperature of the cylindrical substrate via the<br>
membrane member, while self-rotating the cylindrical substrate.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the surface<br>
temperature of the cylindrical photoconductive substrate is<br>
controlled and maintained at 150oC or lower, preferably 130oC or<br>
lower. The surface temperature of the substrate can be easily<br>
determined, for example, by measuring the surface temperature<br>
at the opposite position to the irradiating position of the heating<br>
element (e.g. an irradiation lamp) (a position where is 180<br>
degrees apart from the irradiated position on the cylinder which<br>
is rotated at the rotation frequency of 25 rpm).<br>
The membrane member is easily inserted into a hollow<br>
space of the cylindrical substrate, is elongation-expandable at a<br>
pressure of 500 hPa/cm2 to 10,000 hPa/cm2 or by the weight of<br>
the liquid refrigerant, e.g. water, to be introduced therein, and is<br>
highly stretchable so as to closely contact with the inner wall of<br>
the cylindrical substrate. The membrane member is preferably<br>
elongated in two axial directions, and stretches till reaching the<br>
deepest part of the cylindrical substrate in the longer direction<br>
thereof. The aforementioned degree of the pressure is<br>
sufficiently attained by water pressure of an urban water supply<br>
system. Moreover, the membrane member has enough thermal<br>
conductivity to cool the cylindrical substrate promptly.<br><br><br>
The material for the membrane member is preferably the<br>
one having a high stretchability, such as natural rubber,<br>
synthetic rubber, or the like. In addition, other rubber<br>
materials, which excel in water resistance, abrasion resistance,<br>
light fastness, heat resistance, and the like, may be formulated in<br>
the aforementioned material. The forming method of the<br>
membrane member is selected from the conventional forming<br>
methods known in the art. Specific examples thereof include a<br>
sheet forming method, extrusion molding method, and the like.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, in the case where the heating element<br>
2 such as a UV lamp or the like is disposed nearby the cylindrical<br>
substrate 1 which is rotated by means of a rotation system (which<br>
is not illustrated), the heat generated on the cylindrical substrate<br>
1 by the heating element 2 is removed by introducing the<br>
refrigerant 8 into the inner part of the membrane member 3<br>
which is closely contacted with the inner part of the cylindrical<br>
substrate 1, and the temperature of the cylindrical substrate 1 is<br>
controlled via the membrane member 3 in this manner. The<br>
membrane member 3 is sequentially expanded and elongated as<br>
the refrigerant 8 is introduced therein, and sequentially closely<br>
contacts with the entire inner wall of the cylindrical substrate 1.<br>
In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the air in the hollow space of<br>
the cylindrical substrate 1 is removed by means of an air release<br>
valve 9 which is one example of the assisting means for the close<br><br><br>
contact of the membrane member 3 so as to assist the membrane<br>
member to sufficiently closely contact with the cylindrical<br>
substrate 1 at the time when the refrigerant 8 is introduced. In<br>
this manner, any insufficient contacts are completely removed.<br>
As has mentioned above, it can be understood from the<br>
aforementioned example of the vacuumed contact that the<br>
membrane member 3 is elongated-expandable at the pressure of<br>
500 hPa/cm2 to 10,000 hPa/cm2, and is highly stretchable so as to<br>
closely contact with the inner wall of the cylindrical substrate 1.<br>
In FIG. 1, the references 3e and 3f respectively denote top and<br>
bottom pressing tools (lid members).<br>
Since the liquid used as the refrigerant and the cylindrical<br>
substrate do not have any contact to each other, the liquid will<br>
not be scattered on a photoconductive layer even in the case<br>
where the photoconductive layer is disposed on the surface of the<br>
cylindrical substrate, and thus any defects on the coated layer<br>
due to the deposition of the liquid can be prevented, and thus<br>
uniform cooling can be easily and accurately achieved.<br>
FIG. 2 shows another embodiment of the temperature<br>
control unit of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 2, in the<br>
present invention, the membrane member 3 is closely contacted<br>
with the inner wall of the cylindrical substrate 1 which is rotated<br>
while receiving thermal energy from the heating element 2, and<br>
the refrigerant 8 is introduced into the membrane member 3 from<br><br><br>
one direction (shown with the arrow directing the down side in<br>
FIG. 2) and is released to another direction (shown with the<br>
arrow directing the up side in FIG. 2). In this manner, the<br>
interchange of heat is efficiently performed. In this embodiment,<br>
the membrane member 3 is an elastic body in the shape of the<br>
cylinder (referred as a cylindrical elastic body, hereinafter) which<br>
contacts with the entire inner wall of the cylindrical substrate 1.<br>
Moreover, the air release valve as the assisting means for the<br>
close contact of the membrane member is not used in the unit of<br>
this embodiment. The flows occurred by the<br>
introduction-release of the refrigerant support the close contact<br>
of the membrane member 3. In addition, the flow direction of<br>
the refrigerant can be reversely changed.<br>
Other embodiments of the heat control unit of the present<br>
invention are shown in FIGs. 3 and 4. In these embodiments,<br>
the refrigerant 8 is introduced into the hollow part through a<br>
double pipe comprised of an outer pipe 9a having a relatively<br>
large diameter and inner pipe 9b having a relatively small<br>
diameter and inserted from one end (the bottom end in the<br>
drawings) of the rotated cylindrical elastic body comprised of the<br>
membrane member 3 into the inner part. The refrigerant 8 is<br>
then released from the hollow part, while transferring the heat<br>
via the cylindrical elastic body of the membrane member 3 which<br>
contacts with the entire inner wall of the cylindrical substrate 1.<br><br><br>
The double pipe is disposed on the same axis to the rotation axis<br>
of the rotated cylindrical substrate 1. The outer pipe 9a of the<br>
double pipe is connected in a manner such that an opening<br>
thereof becomes an entrance part (the bottom part in the<br>
drawings) of the hollow part of the cylindrical substrate 1, and<br>
the inner pipe 9b of the double pipe is disposed in a manner such<br>
that an opening thereof is positioned at the deepest part of the<br>
hollow space of the cylindrical substrate 1. The refrigerant 8 is<br>
introduced in an annular channel 5 which is a space made<br>
between the outer pipe 9a and the inner pipe 9b. After entering<br>
into the annular channel 5, the refrigerant 8 moves forward until<br>
it reaches the deepest part, while sequentially pressing the<br>
membrane member 3 of the cylindrical elastic body functioned as<br>
the outer pipe 9a towards the inner wall of the substrate 1 so as<br>
to make the membrane member 3 closely contact with the inner<br>
wall of the substrate 1. Thereafter, the refrigerant 8 is flown<br>
into the inner pipe 9b, and then released therefrom (FIG. 3). In<br>
the case where the refrigerant 8 is introduced from the inner pipe<br>
9b as shown in FIG. 4, the refrigerant 8 is flown into the outer<br>
pipe 9a after reaching the deepest end of the inner pipe 9b, and is<br>
then released from the terminal part (the bottom part in FIG. 4)<br>
of the annular channel 5. Note that, the annular channel 5<br>
defines a space in between the outer surface of the inner pipe 9b<br>
and the inner surface of the outer pipe 9a.<br><br><br>
The width of the annular channel 5 is preferably 2 mm or<br>
more as shown in FIG. 5. Specifically, the annular channel 5 is a<br>
space in between the outer surface of the inner pipe 9b and the<br>
inner surface of the outer pipe 9a within the double pipe, the<br>
double pipe is disposed inside the membrane member 3 of the<br>
cylindrical elastic body so as to be parallel to the rotation axis<br>
direction of the cylindrical substrate 1 and to have the same axis<br>
as the centric axis of the cylindrical substrate, and the membrane<br>
member 3 of the cylindrical elastic body is disposed so as to<br>
contact with the entire inner surface of the cylindrical substrate<br>
1 of the heat control unit.<br>
By adjusting the width (space) of the annular channel 5<br>
between the outer surface of the inner pipe 9b and the inner<br>
surface of the outer pipe 9a, any loss of the pressure is reduced<br>
and the appropriate circulated flow rate of the refrigerant is<br>
maintained. In the case where the space (5) is smaller than 2<br>
mm, the loss of the pressure is increased, the circulated flow rate<br>
of the refrigerant is reduced, and thus the variations in the<br>
temperature of the cylindrical substrate 1 become significant.<br>
In the temperature control unit of the present invention,<br>
the membrane member is at least an outer face of a bag structure<br>
3a, the outer face of the bag structure 3a is elastic and stretched<br>
as the refrigerant is introduced inside the bag structure 3a, and<br>
the elastic outer face of the bag structure 3a enables to be held<br><br><br>
from the inner surface of the cylindrical substrate 1. Moreover,<br>
the bag structure is shrunk to the original shape once the<br>
introduction of the refrigerant is terminated and the refrigerant<br>
is released therefrom.<br>
Namely, the elastic bag structure 3a does not contact with<br>
the cylindrical substrate 1, when no refrigerant is introduced, as<br>
shown in FIG. 6. In this state, the cylindrical substrate 1 is<br>
detachable from the heat control unit.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, the elastic outer face of the elastic bag<br>
structure 3a presses onto the inner surface of the cylindrical<br>
substrate 1 as a result of the introduction of the refrigerant, and<br>
then the cylindrical substrate 1 is held with the elastic bag<br>
structure 3a. Once the introduction of the refrigerant 8 is<br>
terminated, the elastic bag structure 3a is shrunk to the original<br>
shape, and then the cylindrical substrate 1 is removed from the<br>
temperature control unit.<br>
As shown in FIGs. 8A and 8B, it is preferably that the bag<br>
structure 3a is a cylindrical bag structure having a circular<br>
through-hole 8b in its center, the cylindrical bag structure is<br>
disposed on the rigid structure 6 so that the inner circumference<br>
of the inner surface of the membrane member 3 contacts with the<br>
outer circumference of the surface of the rigid tube structure 6,<br>
and the refrigerant 8 is introduced in the unfixed part 6a (the<br>
space in between the outer circumference of the surface of the<br><br><br>
rigid tube 6 and the inner circumference of the inner surface of<br>
the membrane member 3). By fixing the membrane member<br>
around the rigid tube structure 6, the holding ability of the<br>
cylindrical substrate 1 is improved. In addition, the accuracy in<br>
the positioning is increased as the rigid tube structure 6 is<br>
disposed as a central axis. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 8,<br>
the double pipe of inner and outer pipes 9a, 9b is disposed in the<br>
circular through-hole 8b, and it is preferable that the pipe for the<br>
refrigerant (in the drawing, it is the outer pipe 9a, but the inner<br>
pipe 9b may be also set as the pipe for the refrigerant) is disposed<br>
and the refrigerant is introduced into and released from the pipe<br>
for the refrigerant.<br>
The positioning of the location where the cylindrical<br>
substrate 1 is held with the cylindrical elastic body 6 is<br>
performed by using metal or resin disk pressing tools 3e, 3f.<br>
Note that, the top pressing tool 3e is comprised of a flange 3g and<br>
an inner cap 3h.<br>
A thickness of the membrane member 3 of the cylindrical<br>
elastic body which contacts with the entire inner surface of the<br>
cylindrical substrate 1 is preferably 1.0 to 2.0 times of the<br>
thickness of the top and bottom parts of the membrane member 3<br>
of the cylindrical elastic body at where the cylindrical substrate 1<br>
is contacted. It is also preferable that the cross-section of the<br>
thickness changing part 3b of the membrane member 3 of the<br><br><br>
cylindrical elastic body is shaped in taper or curve.<br>
Moreover, the bag structure 3a is, though it is not<br>
illustrated in the drawing, is a chuck which holds the cylindrical<br>
substrate 1 from the hollow space, and rotates so as to rotate the<br>
cylindrical substrate 1 while holding the same from the hollow<br>
space thereof.<br>
Furthermore, the temperature control unit of the present<br>
invention includes the embodiment such that the refrigerant is<br>
circulated via a constant temperature water bath which controls<br>
the temperature, and then is re-introduced into the temperature<br>
control unit.<br>
The device shown in FIG. 9 illustrates one example of such<br>
the embodiment. Two cooling tubes 9c, 9d, are respectively<br>
extended from the double pipe 9a, 9b, and are connected to the<br>
constant-temperature water bath 7. As a result of that the<br>
refrigerant 8 returning from the temperature control unit is<br>
passed through the constant temperature water bath 7 and is<br>
re-introducing into the temperature control unit, the refrigerant<br>
having the controlled temperature can be circulated within the<br>
temperature control unit, the abrasion resistance and stable<br>
electric characteristics are attained. Among two cooling tube 9c,<br>
9d, one of them is used as an outward path for introducing the<br>
refrigerant 8, and the other is used as a return path for releasing<br>
the refrigerant from the temperature control unit.<br><br><br>
The temperature control unit of the present invention<br>
contains another embodiment such that the temperature control<br>
unit contains a pressure detector which monitors the pressure of<br>
the refrigerant 8, and a flow rate control unit wherein the liquid<br>
circulated inside of the membrane member 3 of the cylindrical<br>
elastic body as the refrigerant 8 is supplied from the refrigerant<br>
storage tank by means of a pump via a refrigerant supply pipe,<br>
and the refrigerant 8 is released into the refrigerant storage tank<br>
after circulating inside of the membrane member 3 of the<br>
cylindrical elastic body.<br>
[Embodiment of temperature control unit]<br>
Hereinafter, one embodiment of the present invention is<br>
explained with reference to the drawings. FIG. 10 is a<br>
cross-sectional plane view showing an example of a schematic<br>
structure of a temperature control unit for an<br>
electrophotographic photoconductor substrate in accordance with<br>
the present invention.<br>
The embodiment of the temperature control unit for a part<br>
of the device such as the electrophotographic photoconductor is<br>
roughly classified into a device support 20, a rotation system 21<br>
rotationally disposed in the centric area of the device support 20,<br>
a holding system 22 connected with the edge of the rotation<br>
system 21, a UV radiation system 23 disposed at the perimeter of<br>
the device support 20, and a refrigerant storage tank 24<br><br><br>
connected with the holding system 22 by a pipe arrangement.<br>
The rotation system 21 contains a flange 25, a bearing 26,<br>
a pulley 27 fitted with a bearing case which stores the bearing 26,<br>
a rotation axis 28, and a belt 29 suspended by the pulley 27. The<br>
flange 25 has an opening 25a, and the rotation axis 28 is disposed<br>
and rotationally supported in the opening 25a via the bearing 26.<br>
The pulley 27 is fixed to the rotation axis 28, the pulley 27 is<br>
connected with a driving means (which is not illustrated in the<br>
drawing) via the belt 29, and the driving force of the driving<br>
means is transmitted to the rotation axis 28.<br>
The structure of the holding system 22 is roughly<br>
classified into the rotation axis 28, a refrigerant supplying pipe<br>
30 and a refrigerant releasing pipe 31, a cylindrical elastic body<br>
32, a cylindrical frame 33, and a cylindrical pressing tool 34. In<br>
the centric part of the rotation axis 28, the refrigerant releasing<br>
pipe 31 is passed through, and the end edge of the refrigerant<br>
releasing pipe 31 is connected with a rotational joint 35. The<br>
rotational joint 35 is configured to connect with two systems of<br>
the refrigerant, and the first system is used for supplying, and<br>
the second system is used for releasing. The end edge of the<br>
refrigerant releasing pipe 31 is connected with the second system<br>
for releasing. The refrigerant supplying pipe 30 connected with<br>
the first system for supplying is connected with the bottom<br>
circumferential side of the cylindrical frame 33. The cylindrical<br><br><br>
frame 33 has a hole 36 to which the refrigerant supplying pipe 30<br>
is connected at the bottom circumferential side thereof, so that<br>
the refrigerant is supplied to the surface of the cylindrical frame<br>
33. The cylindrical frame 33 has a hole 37 from which the<br>
refrigerant is recycled to the refrigerant releasing pipe 31 at the<br>
upper circumferential side thereof. The hole 37 and the<br>
refrigerant releasing pipe 31 are connected with a pipe 38.<br>
The cylindrical elastic body 32 is disposed on the surface of<br>
the cylindrical frame 33. At the upper and bottom parts of the<br>
cylindrical frame 33, recesses 39 are formed so as to fix the<br>
cylindrical elastic body 32 thereto. In order to fix the edges 40<br>
of the cylindrical elastic body 32 to the recesses 39, the upper<br>
part and bottom part of the cylindrical elastic body is configured<br>
to have a thickness of 1.0 to 2.0 times thicker than the thickness<br>
of the cylindrical elastic body 32 which is attached to the center<br>
part of the cylindrical frame 33. Therefore, the cylindrical<br>
elastic body 32 is easily located to the cylindrical frame 33 at the<br>
time of replacing the cylindrical elastic body 32. In addition, the<br>
cylindrical elastic body 32 is prevented from dislocation caused<br>
by the repeated use by replacing the cylindrical substrate 41<br>
which is a work-piece.<br>
FIG. 11A shows the state where the cylindrical elastic body<br>
32 is attached to the surface of the cylindrical frame 33. FIG.<br>
11B shows the state where the cylindrical elastic body 32 holds<br><br><br>
the cylindrical substrate 41 which is a work-piece. The<br>
cylindrical substrate 41 is configured to be held by the<br>
swollenness of the cylindrical elastic body 32.<br>
FIG. 12 shows a structural view in which the area around<br>
the edge 40 of the cylindrical elastic body 32 is enlarged. As<br>
shown in FIG. 12, a tilt 42 is formed between the recess 39 and<br>
the surface of the cylindrical frame 33. The thickness of the<br>
edge of the cylindrical elastic body 32 is formed with the gradient<br>
in the shape of taper or curve, along with the tilt 42. As a result<br>
of that the edge of the cylindrical elastic body 32 is shaped in the<br>
taper or curve, the edge 40 which changes its thickness is<br>
prevented from receiving the excessive stress at the time when<br>
the cylindrical elastic body 32 is stretched. Moreover, the<br>
surface of the tilt 42 is preferably mirror finished so as not to<br>
damage the cylindrical elastic body 32.<br>
The cylindrical elastic body 32 is fixed at the upper and<br>
bottom parts thereof with stainless steel bands 43 for the purpose<br>
of easy replacement. A rubber ring 44 of self-bubble sponge is<br>
placed in between the surface of the cylindrical frame 33 and the<br>
cylindrical elastic body 32. As a result of the rubber ring 44, the<br>
refrigerant 45 filled in the cylindrical elastic body 32 and the<br>
cylindrical frame 33 is prevented from leaking. In the case<br>
where the cylindrical elastic body 32 is fasten by the stainless<br>
steel bands 43, a seamless rubber ring 46 is placed in between the<br><br><br>
stainless steel band 43 and the cylindrical elastic body 32 so as to<br>
protect the surface of the cylindrical elastic body 32.<br>
The cylindrical elastic body 32 is stretched by the pressure<br>
of the refrigerant at the time when the refrigerant 45 is supplied<br>
from the refrigerant supplying pipe 30, so that the stretched<br>
cylindrical elastic body 32 is closely attached to the inner surface<br>
of the cylindrical substrate 41 and holds the cylindrical substrate<br>
41. In this manner, the surface of the cylindrical substrate 41 is<br>
uniformly cooled.<br>
The cylindrical substrate 41 is equipped with cylindrical<br>
pressing tools 34 formed of a metal or resin at the top and bottom<br>
parts thereof, so that the cylindrical substrate 41 is easily located<br>
in the up and down directions. Moreover, the cylindrical elastic<br>
body 32 is prevented from being exposed with the UV light during<br>
the heating process of the cylindrical substrate 41 by means of<br>
the UV radiation unit 23. Therefore, the cylindrical elastic body<br>
32 is prevented from the deterioration due to the UV light. The<br>
cylindrical pressing tools 34 are movable up and down, and<br>
enables to cool the cylindrical substrates 41 having different<br>
sizes in the longitudinal direction.<br>
After the termination of the heating of the cylindrical<br>
substrate 41, the supply of the refrigerant 45 from the refrigerant<br>
supplying pipe 30 to the space between the cylindrical elastic<br>
body 32 and the elastic frame 33 is terminated. When the supply<br><br><br>
of the refrigerant 45 is terminated, the pressure of the<br>
refrigerant 45 is reduced so that the cylindrical elastic body 32 is<br>
shrunk and closely attached to the surface of the cylindrical<br>
frame 33. At this time, the inner diameter of the cylindrical<br>
elastic body 32 is smaller than the outer diameter of the<br>
cylindrical frame 33 so that the refrigerant 45 is recycled into the<br>
cylindrical frame 33.<br>
Moreover, the air release valve 48 is disposed at the top<br>
part of the refrigerant releasing pipe 31 so as to prevent the<br>
generation of bubbles in the refrigerant 45 at the time when the<br>
refrigerant 45 is supplied into the space between the cylindrical<br>
elastic body 32 and the cylindrical frame 33. The air release<br>
valve 48 is opened for a certain period at the time of supplying<br>
the refrigerant 45.<br>
In the refrigerant storage tank 24 connected to the holding<br>
system 22 via the pipe arrangement, the refrigerant 45 is stored,<br>
and is passed to the rotational joint 35 disposed at the bottom<br>
part of the holding system 22 via a pipe 50 by means of a pump 49.<br>
The refrigerant 45 released from the rotational joint 35 of the<br>
holding system 22 is returned to the refrigerant storage tank 24<br>
via a pipe 51. The pipe 51 is equipped with a pressure censer 52<br>
which monitors the pressure of the refrigerant 45, and a valve 53<br>
which controls the flow rate of the refrigerant 45. In the heating<br>
process of the cylindrical substrate 41 by means of the UV<br><br><br>
radiation system 23, once the sensor 52 recognizes the drop in the<br>
pressure, the pressure error signal is transmitted to a control<br>
device which is not illustrated in the drawing, and then the<br>
device is stopped. This is because that the drop in the pressure<br>
of the refrigerant 45 released from the holding system 22 is<br>
considered to be an occurrence of a leak of the refrigerant 45 due<br>
to a breakage of the cylindrical elastic body 32. In this manner,<br>
the pressure state of the refrigerant 45 released from the holding<br>
system 22 can be used for a monitoring of the device. Moreover,<br>
the internal pressure in the space between the cylindrical elastic<br>
body 32 and the cylindrical frame 33 is controlled by operating<br>
the valve 53 which controls the flow rate of the refrigerant 45,<br>
and the holding force of the cylindrical substrate 41 is arbitrarily<br>
adjusted.<br>
As a modified embodiment, the pipe 50 is equipped with a<br>
flow meter 54a and the pipe 51 is equipped with a flow meter 54b<br>
as shown in FIG. 13, the leak of the refrigerant 45 due to the<br>
breakage of the cylindrical elastic body 32 can be detected by<br>
detecting the difference in the flow rates of the pipe 50 and the<br>
pipe 51.<br>
Moreover, the refrigerant storage tank 24 is equipped with<br>
a thermometer 55a, the pipe 51 is equipped with a thermometer<br>
55b, and then the cooling efficiency of the cylindrical substrate 41<br>
by means of the cylindrical elastic body 32 can be detected by<br><br><br>
detecting a difference in the temperature of the refrigerant in the<br>
refrigerant storage tank 24 and the temperature of the<br>
refrigerant in the pipe 51. In addition, the detected value of the<br>
temperature deference is continuously recorded in the control<br>
device which is not illustrated in the drawing, and the variation<br>
of the temperature with time can be detected from the beginning<br>
of the production. This variation of the temperature with time<br>
is corresponded to the variation of the light quantity of the UV<br>
lamp or the like used for the UV radiation system 23, the timing<br>
for replacing the UV lamp or the like can be detected as when the<br>
variation of the temperature with time is exceeded at a certain<br>
threshold.<br>
The material used for the cylindrical elastic body 32 is<br>
preferably selected from the material having excellent water<br>
resistance, and abrasion resistance. Specific examples thereof<br>
include ethylene-propylene-diene rubber, and the like.<br>
[Layer structure of an electrophotographic photoconductor]<br>
The electrophotographic photoconductor for use with the<br>
present invention will be described with reference to the<br>

electrophotographic photoconductor, and said photoconductor has<br>
a single-layered structure wherein, on a conductive substrate 11,<br>
a photoconductive layer 12 having the both charge generating<br><br><br>
function and charge transporting function is disposed. FIG. 14A<br>
shows the case where the crosslinked surface layer 13 constitutes<br>
the entire photoconductive layer 12. FIG. 14B shown the case<br>

electrophotographic photoconductor, and said photoconductor has<br>
a laminate-layered structure wherein, on a conductive substrate<br>
11, a charge generating layer 12a having the charge generating<br>
function and a charge transporting layer 12b having the charge<br>
transporting function are disposed. FIG. 15A shows the case<br>
where the crosslinked surface layer 13 constitutes the entire<br>
charge transporting layer 12b. FIG. 15B shown the case where<br>
the crosslinked surface layer 13 constitutes a surface portion of<br>
the charge transporting layer 12b.<br>
[Conductive substrate]<br>
The conductive substrate is suitably selected depending on<br>
the intended purpose without any restrictions, provided that it<br>
has a conductivity and volume resistance of 1010 Qcm or less.<br>
Examples thereof include a film of or cylindrical plastic or paper<br>
to which metal oxide, e.g. aluminum, nickel, chrome, nichrome,<br>
cupper, gold, silver, platinum, etc., is deposited by sputtering, a<br>
tube which is prepared by extruding a plate of aluminum,<br>
aluminum alloy, nickel, stainless steel, or the like, shaping into a<br><br><br>
tube in accordance with a method such as a drawing or the like,<br>
and subjected to a surface treatment such as cutting, super<br>
finishing, polishing or the like. Moreover, the nickel endless<br>
belt and stainless steel endless belt disclosed in JP-A No.<br>
52-36016 are also used as the conductive substrate.<br>
Furthermore, those prepared by dispersing conductive<br>
powder in a binder resin and coating the same on the substrate<br>
can be also used as the conductive substrate.<br>
Examples of the conductive powder include carbon black,<br>
acetylene black, metal powder of aluminum, nickel, iron,<br>
nichrome, copper, zinc, silver or the like, and metal oxide powder<br>
of conductive tin oxide, ITO, or the like. Examples of the binder<br>
resin used at the same time include thermoplastic resins,<br>
thermoset resins, or photocuring resins, such as polystyrene,<br>
styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer, styrene-butadiene copolymer,<br>
styrenemaleic anhydride copolymer, polyester, polyvinyl chloride,<br>
vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer, polyvinyl acetate,<br>
polyvinylidene chloride, polyarylate resin, phenoxy resin,<br>
polycarbonate, cellulose acetate resin, ethyl cellulose resin,<br>
polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl formal, polyvinyl toluene,<br>
poly-N-vinyl carbazole, acrylic resin, silicone resin, epoxy resin,<br>

dispersing the aforementioned conductive powder and binder<br><br><br>
resin in a suitably selected solvent, e.g. tetrahydrofuran,<br>
dichloromethane, methylethylketone, toluene, or the like, and<br>
coating the solution.<br>
Moreover, the one in which a conductive layer formed from<br>
a thermal contraction tube is disposed on an appropriate<br>
cylindrical substrate can also be suitably used as the conductive<br>
substrate. Here, the thermal contraction tube is formed of a<br>
material, such as polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, polyester,<br>
polystyrene, polyvinylidene chloride, polyethylene, chloride<br>
rubber, Teflon (registered trade mark), or the like, containing the<br>
conductive powder therein.<br>
[Photoconductive layer]<br>
The photoconductive layer will be explained next. The<br>
photoconductive layer may have a single-layered structure or<br>
laminate-layered structure.<br>
In the case where the photoconductive layer has a<br>
laminate-layered structure, the photoconductive layer is<br>
comprised of a charge generating layer having a charge<br>
generating function, and a charge transporting layer having a<br>
charge transporting function. In the case where the<br>
photoconductive layer has a single-layered structure, the<br>
photoconductive layer is a layer which has the charge generating<br>
function and the charge transporting function at the same time.<br>
Hereinafter, the laminate-layered photoconductive layer<br><br><br>
and single-layered photoconductive layer will be explained.<br>
[Laminate-layered photoconductive layer]<br>
(Charge generating layer)<br>
The charge generating layer contains a charge generating<br>
compound having a charge generating function, as a main<br>
component, and optionally contains a binder resin in combination,<br>
if necessary. As the charge generating compound, an inorganic<br>
material and an organic material are used.<br>
Examples of the inorganic material include crystalline<br>
selenium, amorphous selenium, selenium-tellurium,<br>

amorphous selenium is the one in which a dangling-bond is<br>
terminated with a hydrogen atom and/or a halogen atom, or the<br>
one doped with a boron atom, a phosphorous atom, or the like.<br>
As the organic material, the known materials in the art<br>
can be used. Examples thereof include phthalocyanine pigments<br>
such as metal phthalocyanine and metal-free phthalocyanine,<br>

silicone resin, acrylic resin, polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl formal,<br>
polyvinyl ketone, polystyrene, poly-N-vinylcarbazole,<br>

binder resins may be used singly or in combination with two or<br>
more. Other than the aforementioned binder resins as the<br>
binder resin of the charge generating layer, a macromolecular<br>
charge transporting compound having a charge generating<br>
function can be used. Examples of such the macromolecular<br>
charge transporting compound include- polycarbonate, polyester,<br>
polyurethane, polyether, polysiloxane, acrylic resin, each of<br>
which has an aryl amine, benzidine, hydrazone, carbazole,<br>
stilbene, or pyrazoline structure therein; and polymeric material<br>
having a polysilane structure.<br>
The specific examples of the aforementioned former<br>
example are charger transporting polymeric materials disclosed<br><br><br>
in JP-A Nos. 01-001728, 01009964, 01-013061, 01-019049,<br>

latter example are polysilylene polymers disclosed in JP-A Nos.<br>
63-285552, 05-19497, 05-70595, 1073944, and the like.<br>
Furthermore, the charge generating layer may further<br>
contain a low molecular charge transporting compound.<br>
The low molecular charge transporting compound which<br>
can be used in the charge generating layer is classified into a hole<br>
transporting material and an electron transporting material.<br>
Examples of the electron transporting material include<br>
electron receiving compounds such as chrolanil, bromanil,<br>
tetracyanoethylene, tetracyanoquinodimethane,<br>
2,4,7-trinitro-9-fluorenone, 2,4,5,7-tetranitro-9-fluorenone,<br>
2,4,5,7-tetranitroxanthone, 2,4,8-trinitrothioxanthone,<br>
2,6,8-trinitro-4H-indeno[l,2-b]thiophen-4-one,<br><br><br>
l,3,7'trinitrobenzothiophene-5,5-dioxide, diphenoquinone<br>
derivative, and the like. These are used singly or in combination<br>
of two or more, as the electron transporting material.<br>
As the hole transporting material, the electron donating<br>
compounds listed below can be suitably used. Specifically,<br>
examples of the hole transporting material include oxazole<br>
derivatives, oxadiazole derivatives, imidazole derivatives,<br>
monoaryl amine derivatives, diaryl amine derivatives, triaryl<br>
amine derivatives, stilbene derivatives, α-phenyl stilbene<br>
derivatives, benzidine derivatives, diaryl methane derivatives,<br>
triaryl methane derivatives, 9-styrylanthracene derivatives,<br>
pyrazoline derivatives, divinyl benzene derivatives, hydrazone<br>
derivatives, indene derivatives, butadiene derivatives, pyrene<br>
derivatives, bisstilbene derivatives, enamine derivatives, other<br>
materials known in the art, and the like. These are used singly<br>
or in combination of two or more, as the hole transporting<br>
material.<br>
The forming method of the charge generating layer is<br>
roughly classified into a vacuum thin film forming method, and a<br>
casting method using dispersion solution.<br>
Specific examples of the vacuum thin film forming method<br>
include a vapor deposition method, a glow discharge<br>
decomposition method, an ion-plating method, a sputtering<br>
method, a reactive sputtering method, CVD method, and the like.<br><br><br>
In the aforementioned methods, the layer of the aforementioned<br>
inorganic or organic material can be suitably formed.<br>
In the case where the charge generating layer is formed in<br>
accordance with the aforementioned casting method, the<br>
aforementioned inorganic or organic charge generating compound<br>
is dispersed, if necessary together with a binder resin, in a<br>
solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dioxolane, toluene,<br>
dichloromethane, monochlorobenzene, dichloroethane,<br>
cyclohexane, cyclopentanone, anisole, xylene, methylethylketone,<br>
acetone, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, or the like, by means of a<br>
ball mill, attritor, sand mill, bead mill, or the like, and then the<br>
dispersion is appropriately diluted and coated to thereby form the<br>
electron generating layer. If necessary, a leveling agent, e.g.<br>
dimethyl silicone oil, methylphenyl silicone oil, etc., can be added<br>
thereto. The coating is carried out in accordance with a dip<br>
coating method, spray coating method, bead coating method, ring<br>
coating method, or the like.<br>
The charge generating layer prepared in the manner<br>
mentioned above has a thickness of 0.01 µm to 5 µm, preferably<br>
0.05 µm to 2 µm.<br>
[Charge transporting layer]<br>
The charge transporting layer is a layer having a charge<br>
transporting function, and a crosslinked surface layer having a<br>
charge transporting structure is effectively used as the charge<br><br><br>
transporting layer. In the case where the crosslinked surface<br>
layer is the entire charge transporting layer, the crosslinked<br>
surface layer is formed by coating, on the charge generating layer,<br>
a coating solution containing a radical polymerization compound<br>
(a radical polymerizable monomer having no charge transporting<br>
structure and a radical polymerizable monomer having a charge<br>
transporting structure; hereinafter, the radical polymerization<br>
compound denotes the same definition) and filler, optionally<br>
drying the coated layer, and externally imparting an energy so as<br>
to initiate a curing reaction. A thickness of the crosslinked<br>
surface layer has a thickness of 10 µm to 30 µm, preferably 10 µm.<br>
to 25 µm. When the thickness thereof is thinner than 10 µm, a<br>
sufficient charging potential cannot be maintained. When the<br>
thickness thereof is thicker than 30 µm, the crosslinked surface<br>
layer tends to be separated from an under layer due to a volume<br>
contraction at the time of curing.<br>
In the case where the crosslinked surface layer is formed<br>
at a surface portion of the charge transporting layer and the<br>
charge transporting layer is of laminate-layered structure, the<br>
bottom part of the charge transporting layer is formed by coating,<br>
on the charge generating layer, a solution in which a charge<br>
transporting compound having a charge transporting function<br>
and a binder resin are dissolved and/or dispersed in an<br>
appropriate solvent, and drying the coated solution, and then a<br><br><br>
top part of the charge transporting layer is formed by coating, on<br>
the thus formed bottom layer, a coating solution containing a<br>
radical polymerizable compound and filler, and crosslinking and<br>
curing he coated layer by the application of external energy.<br>
As the charge transporting compound, the electron<br>
transporting materials, hole transporting materials, and<br>
macromolecular charge transporting materials listed in the<br>
descriptions of the aforementioned charge generating layer can<br>
be used. The use of the macromolecular charge transporting<br>
material is effective as the solubility of the bottom layer is<br>
suppressed at the time of coating the surface layer.<br>
Examples of the binder resin include thermoplastic or<br>
thermoset resins such as polystyrene, styrene-acrylonitril<br>
copolymer, styrene-butadiene copolymer, styrene-maleic<br>
anhydride copolymer, polyester, polyvinyl chloride, vinyl<br>
chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer, polyvinyl acetate,<br>
polyvinylidene chloride, polyacrylate resin, phenoxy resin,<br>
polycarbonate, cellulose acetate resin, ethyl cellulose resin,<br>
polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl formal, polyvinyl toluene,<br>
poly-N-vinyl carbazole, acrylic resin, silicone resin, epoxy resin,<br>
melamine resin, urethane resin, phenol resin, alkyd resin, and<br>
the like.<br>
The amount of the charge transporting compound is 20<br>
parts by mass to 300 parts by mass, and preferably 40 parts by<br><br><br>
mass to 150 parts by mass, with respect to 100 parts by mass of<br>
the binder resin. Note that, in case where the macromolecular<br>
charge transporting material is used, it can be used alone, or in<br>
combination with the binder resin.<br>
As the solvent used for coating of the bottom part of the<br>
charge transporting layer, the one similar to the solvent used for<br>
the charge generating layer can be used, but suitable examples<br>
thereof are the ones dissolves the charge transporting compound<br>
and the binder resin well. Here, a single solvent or mixed<br>
solvent of two or more is used. Moreover, the bottom part of the<br>
charge transporting layer is formed in accordance with a coating<br>
method similar to the coating method of the charge generating<br>
layer.<br>
The bottom part of the charge transporting layer may<br>
optionally contain a plasticizer and a leveling agent.<br>
As the plasticizer used in the bottom part of the charge<br>
transporting layer, the conventional plasticizers for resin such as<br>
dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, and the like can be used.<br>
The usage amount thereof is appropriately 0 to 30 parts by mass<br>
with respect to 100 parts by mass of the binder resin.<br>
As the leveling agent used in the bottom part of the charge<br>
transporting layer, silicone oil such as dimethyl silicone oil,<br>
methylphenyl silicone oil and the like, and polymer or oligomer<br>
having a perfluoroalkyl group at a side chain thereof can be used.<br><br><br>
The usage amount thereof is appropriately 0 to 1 part by mass<br>
with respect to 100 parts by mass of the binder resin.<br>
A thickness of the bottom part of the charge transporting<br>
layer is appropriately 5 µm to 40 µm, and preferably 10 µm to 30<br>
µm.<br>
In the case where the crosslinked surface layer is the<br>
entire charge transporting layer, as mentioned in the forming<br>
method of the crosslinked surface layer, the crosslinked surface<br>
layer is formed by coating a coating, on the bottom part of the<br>
charge transporting layer, a coating solution containing a radical<br>
polymerizable compound, optionally drying the coated layer, and<br>
externally imparting an energy such as heat or light so as to<br>
initiate a curing reaction. A thickness of the crosslinked surface<br>
layer is 1 µm to 20 µm, and preferably 2 µm to 10 µm. When the<br>
thickness thereof is thinner than 1 µm, the durability is varied<br>
due to the uneven film thickness. When the thickness thereof is<br>
thicker than 20 µm, the reproducibility is declined due to the<br>
diffusion of the charge as the film thickness of the entire charge<br>
transporting layer becomes large.<br>
[Single-layered photoconductive layer]<br>
The photoconductive layer of a single-layered structure is<br>
a layer having both the charge generating function and charge<br>
transporting function at the same time. The crosslinked surface<br>
layer having the charge transporting structure is effectively used<br><br><br>
as a single-layered photoconductive layer by adding therein a<br>
charge generating compound having a charge generating function.<br>
As mentioned in the casting method for forming the charge<br>
generating layer, the crosslinked surface layer is formed by<br>
dispersing the charge generating compound in the coating<br>
solution containing the radical polymerizable compound, coating<br>
the coating solution on the substrate, optionally drying the<br>
coated layer, and externally imparting energy so as to initiate a<br>
curing reaction. Note that, a dispersion solution in which the<br>
charge generating compound is dispersed in a solvent can be<br>
added to the coating solution of the crosslinked surface layer. A<br>
thickness of the crosslinked surface layer is 10 pm to 30 pm, and<br>
preferably 10 pm to 25 pm. When the thickness thereof is<br>
thinner than 10 pm, the sufficient charging potential cannot be<br>
maintained. When the thickness thereof is thicker than 30 µm,<br>
the crosslinked surface layer tends to be separated from an under<br>
layer due to a volume contraction at the time of curing.<br>
In the case where the crosslinked surface layer is a top<br>
part of the single-layered photoconductive layer, the bottom part<br>
of the single-layered photoconductive layer is formed by<br>
dissolving and/or dispersing the charge generating compound<br>
having a charge generating function, the charge transporting<br>
compound having a charge transporting function and the binder<br>
resin in an appropriate solvent, coating the thus prepared<br><br><br>
solution, and drying the coated layer. If necessary, additives<br>
such as a plasticizer, a leveling agent, or the like can be added<br>
thereto. The dispersing method, the charge generating<br>
compound, the charge transporting compound, the plasticizer,<br>
and the leveling agent are the same as those described in the<br>
descriptions of the charge generating layer and the charge<br>
transporting layer. As the binder resin, the binder resin listed<br>
in the descriptions of the charge generating layer can be mixed<br>
for use other than the binder resin listed in the descriptions of<br>
the charge transporting layer. Moreover, the aforementioned<br>
macromolecular charge transporting compound can be also used,<br>
and the use thereof is effective as the components of the lower<br>
photoconductive layer in the crosslinked surface layer can be<br>
suppressed. A thickness of the bottom part of the<br>
photoconductive layer is appropriately 5 µm to 30 µm, and<br>
preferably 10 µm to 25 µm.<br>
In the case where the crosslinked surface layer is a top<br>
part of the single-layered photoconductive layer, the crosslinked<br>
surface layer is formed by coating, on the aforementioned bottom<br>
part of the photoconductive layer, a coating solution containing<br>
the radical polymerizable compound and the charge generating<br>
compound, optionally drying the coated layer, and curing the<br>
coated layer by externally imparting energy such as heat or light.<br>
The thickness of the crosslinked surface layer is 1 µm to 20 µm,<br><br><br>
and preferably 2 µm to 10 µm. When the thickness thereof is<br>
thinner than 1 µm, the durability is varied due to the uneven film<br>
thickness.<br>
The amount of the charge generating compound contained<br>
in the single-layered photoconductive layer is preferably 1% by<br>
mass to 30% by mass with respect to the total mass of the<br>
photoconductive layer. The preferable amounts of the binder<br>
resin and the charge transporting compound contained in the<br>
bottom part of the photoconductive layer are respectively 20% by<br>
mass to 80% by mass and 10% by mass to 70% by mass with<br>
respect to the total amount of the bottom part of the<br>
photoconductive layer.<br>
[Intermediate layer]<br>
In the case where the crosslinked surface layer is a top<br>
part of the photoconductive layer, an intermediate layer can be<br>
disposed in the photoconductor for use in the present invention<br>
for the purpose of preventing the contamination of the<br>
components of the bottom layer in the crosslinked surface layer<br>
and improving the adherence between the crisslinked surface<br>
layer and the layer below. The intermediate layer prevents any<br>
inhibition of the curing reaction and formation of uneven surface<br>
of the crosslinked surface layer, which are cased by the<br>
contamination of the components of the bottom part of the<br>
photoconductive layer in the outermost surface layer containing<br><br><br>
the radical polymerizable compound. Moreover, the<br>
intermediate layer also improves the adherence between the<br>
bottom part of the photoconductive layer and the crosslinked<br>
surface layer.<br>
The intermediate layer generally contains a binder resin<br>
as a main component. Examples of the binder resin include<br>
polyamide, alcohol-soluble nylon, water-soluble polyvinyl butyral,<br>
polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl alcohol, and the like. A formation<br>
method of the intermediate layer is selected from the<br>
aforementioned conventional coating method. A thickness of the<br>
intermediate layer is appropriately 0.05 µm to 2 µm.<br>
[Undercoat layer]<br>
In the photoconductor for use in the present invention, an<br>
undercoat layer may be formed in between the conductive<br>
substrate and the photosensitive layer.<br>
The undercoat layer generally contains a resin as the main<br>
component, however, in consideration that the undercoat layer is<br>
coated with the photosensitive layer using a solvent, it is<br>
preferable to use a resin having high resistance to typically used<br>
organic solvents.<br>
Examples of such resin include- water-soluble resins such<br>
as polyvinyl alcohol, casein and sodium polyacrylateJ alcohol<br>
soluble resins such as nylon copolymer and methoxymethylated<br>
nylon; and curable resins capable of forming a three-dimensional<br><br><br>
network structure such as polyurethane, melamine resin, phenol<br>
resin, alkyl-melamine resin and epoxy resin. Moreover, to the<br>
undercoat layer, a fine powder pigment of metal oxide can be<br>
added to prevent occurrence of moire and reduce the residual<br>
potential, etc. Examples of the metal oxide include titanium<br>
oxide, silica, alumina, zirconium oxide, tin oxide, indium oxide,<br>
and the like.<br>
The undercoat layer can be formed by using an appropriate<br>
solvent and the coating method as described in the photosensitive<br>
layer. Moreover, a silane coupling agent, a titanium coupling<br>
agent, a chrome coupling agent, or the like can be added to the<br>
undercoat layer. Besides the above, for the undercoat layer used<br>
in the present invention, it is preferable to use a layer formed by<br>
anodically-oxidizing Al2O3 or a layer formed using an organic<br>
material such as polyparaxylylene (parylene) and an inorganic<br>
material such as SiO2, SnO2, TiO2, ITO and CeO2 by vacuum<br>
thin-layer forming method. Besides the material described<br>
above, conventional undercoat layers can be used. The<br>
thickness of the undercoat layer is appropriately 0 µm to 5 µm.<br>
[Addition of antioxidant in each layer]<br>
The antioxidant may be added in each layer such as the<br>
crosslinked surface layer, charge generating layer, charge<br>
transporting layer, undercoat layer, intermediate layer and the<br>
like, for the purpose of improving whether resistance, especially<br><br><br>
for preventing decline of the sensitivity and increase of the<br>
residual potential.<br>

These compounds are known as a antioxidant for rubber,<br>
plastic, oil, or the like, and can be obtained as a commercial<br>
product.<br>
The addition amount of the antioxidant is 0.01% by mass<br>
to 10% by mass with respect to the total amount of the layer to be<br>
added.<br>
[Crosslinked surface layer]<br>
The aforementioned radical polymerizable monomer<br><br><br>
having no charge transporting structure is a tri- or more<br>
functional radical polymerizable monomer having no charge<br>
transporting structure. The tri or more functional radical<br>
polymerizable monomer denotes a monomer which has no charge<br>
transporting structure such as a hole transporting structure (e.g.<br>
triaryl amine, hydrazone, pyrrazoline and/or carbazol) and an<br>
electron transporting structure (e.g. condensated polycyclic<br>
quinone, diphenoquinone, and an electron attractive aromatic<br>
ring having a cyano group and/or a nitro group), but has three or<br>
more functional radical polymerizable groups. The radical<br>
polymerizable functional group is suitably selected without any<br>
restrictions, provided that it has a C_C double bond, and is<br>
radically polymerizable. Examples of the radical polymerizable<br>
functional group include (1) 1-substitued ethylene functional<br>
group, (2) 1,1-substituted ethylene functional group, and the like.<br>
Examples of (1) 1-substituted ethylene functional group<br>
include the functional group represented by the following<br>
formula-<br>
CH2=CH-X2-	Formula (I)<br>
In the above formula, X2 denotes an arylene group (e.g.,<br>
phenylene and naphthylene) which may have a substituent;<br>
alkenylene group which may have a substituent; —CO— group; -<br>
COO- group; -CON(R36)- group (wherein R36 represents a<br>
hydrogen atom; alkyl group (e.g., methyl and ethyl); aralkyl<br><br><br>
group (e.g., benzyl, naphthylmethyl and phenethyl); aryl group<br>
(e.g., phenyl and naphthyl)); or -S— group.<br>
Examples of the substituent include a vinyl group, styryl<br>
group, 2-methyl-l,3-butadienyl group, vinylcarbonyl group,<br>

In the above formula, Y4 denotes an alkyl group which may<br>
have a substituent; aralkyl group which may have a substituent;<br>
aryl group (e.g., phenyl and naphthyl) which may have a<br>
substituent; halogen atom; cyano group; nitro group; alkoxy<br>
group (e.g. methoxy and ethoxy); and -COOR37 group ((wherein<br>
R37 represents a hydrogen atom; alkyl group (e.g., methyl and<br>
ethyl) which may have a substituent; aralkyl group (e.g., benzyl<br>
and phenethyl) which may have a substituent; aryl group (e.g.,<br>
phenyl and naphthyl) which may have a substituent; or<br>

and ethyl); alkoxy group (e.g., methoxy and ethoxy); aryloxy<br>
group (e.g., phenoxy); aryl group (phenyl and naphthyl); and<br>
aralkyl group (e.g., benzyl and phenethyl).<br>
Among these radical-polymerizable functional groups, an<br>
acryloyloxy group and a methacryloyloxy group are particularly<br>
preferred. A compound having three or more acryloyloxy groups<br>
can be produced, for example, by esterifying or transesterifying a<br>
compound having three or more hydroxyl groups in the molecule<br>
with an acrylic acid (salt), an acrylic halide or an acrylate. A<br>
compound having three or more methacryloyloxy groups can be<br>
produced in the similar manner. Notably, in the three or more<br>
radical-polymerizable functional groups-containing monomer,<br>

different.<br>
The tri- or more functional radical-polymerizable monomer<br><br><br>
having no charge transportable structure is appropriately<br>
selected depending on the intended purpose without any<br>
restrictions. Examples thereof include trimethylolpropane<br>
triacrylate (TMPTA), trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate,<br>
HPA-modified trimethylolpropane triacrylate, EO-modified<br>
trimethylolpropane triacrylate, PO-modified trimethylolpropane<br>
triacrylate, caprolactone-modified trimethylolpropane triacrylate,<br>
HPA-modified trimethylolpropane triacrylate, pentaerythritol<br>
triacrylate, pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (PETTA), glycerol<br>
triacrylate, ECH-modified glycerol triacrylate, EO-modified<br>
glycerol triacrylate, PO-modified glycerol triacrylate,<br>
tris(acryloxyethyl) isocyanulate, dipentaerythritol hexaacrylate<br>
(DPHA), caprolactone-modified dipentaerythritol hexaacrylate,<br>
dipentaerythritol	hydroxypentaacrylate,	alkyl-modified<br>
dipentaerythritol pentaacrylate, alkyl-modified dipentaerythritol<br>
tetraacrylate, alkyl-modified dipentaerythritol triacrylate,<br>
dimethylol propanetetraacrylate (DTMPTA), pentaerythritol<br>
ethoxyteteraacrylate, EO-modified phosphoric acid triacrylate<br>
and 2,2,5,5-tetrahydroxymethylcyclopentanone tetraacrylate.<br>
These monomers may be used alone or in combination.<br>
The formulated ratio of the tri- or more functional radical<br>
polymerizable monomer having no charge transporting structure<br>
is 20% by mass to 80% by mass, and preferably 30% by mass to<br>
70% by mass with respect to the total amount of the crosslinked<br><br><br>
surface layer. In the case where the ratio thereof is less than<br>
20% by mass, the concentration of the three dimentional<br>
crosslikage becomes low in the crosslinked surface layer, and the<br>
significant improvement of abrasion resistance cannot be<br>
attained compared with the case using the conventional<br>
thermoplastic binder resin. In the case where the ratio thereof<br>
is more than 80% by mass, the content of the charge transporting<br>
compound is decreased, and thus the electric characteristics are<br>
degraded. Although it is uneasy to state as the required<br>
abrasion resistance and electric characteristics tend to change<br>
depending on the process to be used, the formulated ratio thereof<br>
is particularly preferably in the range of 30% by mass to 70% by<br>
mass in view of the balance between the abrasion resistance and<br>
electric characteristics.<br>
The aforementioned radical polymerizable compound<br>
having a charge transporting structure denotes a compound<br>
which has a charge transporting structure such as a hole<br>
transporting structure (e.g. triaryl amine, hydrazone, pyrrazoline<br>
and/or carbazol) and an electron transporting structure (e.g.<br>
condensated poly cyclic quinone, diphenoquinone, and an electron<br>
attractive aromatic ring having a cyano group and/or a nitro<br>
group), and also has a radical polymerizable functional group.<br>
Examples of the radical polymerizable functional group are those<br>
listed in the descriptions of the radical polymerizable monomer.<br><br><br>
Among them, an acryloyloxy group and a methacryloyloxy group<br>
are particularly preferred.<br>
The radical polymerizable compound having a charge<br>
transporting structure may have two or more functional groups,<br>
but preferably has one functional group in view of the film quality<br>
and electrostatic characteristics. When two or more functional<br>
radical polymerizable compound having a charge transporting<br>
structure is used, the charge transporting structure is fixed in<br>
the crosslinked structure via a plurality of bonds. However, as<br>
the charge transporting structure is extremely bulky, distortion<br>
may caused in the cured resin and the internal stress of the<br>
crosslinked surface layer becomes high. Therefore, cracks or<br>
scratches tend to be formed due to the deposition of carrier, or the<br>
like. These problems may not occur when the thickness of the<br>
crosslinked surface layer is 5 µm or less. In the case where the<br>
thickness is more than 5 µm, the internal stress of the<br>
crosslinked surface layer becomes extremely high and cracks tend<br>
to be caused just after the formation of crosslinkages.<br>
From the view point of the electrostatic characteristics, in<br>
case where the two or more functional charge transporting<br>
compound is used, an intermediate structure (cation radical) at<br>
the time of the charge transportation cannot be stably<br>
maintained as the charge transporting structure is fixed in the<br>
crosslinked structure via a plurality of bonds. The decline of the<br><br><br>
sensitivity and increase of residual potential tend to occur due to<br>
the trapped electric charge. These degradation of the electric<br>
characteristics appears in an image as the lowered image density<br>
or thinned printed characters. Therefore, the radical<br>
polymerizable compound having a mono-functional charge<br>
transporting structure is used as the radical polymerizable<br>
compound having a charge transporting structure, and the charge<br>
transporting structure is fixed in between the crosslinked<br>
structure in the fashion of pendant. Therefore, the formation of<br>
cracks or scratches is suppressed and the electrostatic<br>
characteristics are stabilized.<br>
A triarylamine structure is effective as the charge<br>
transporting structure. The number of the functional group<br>
thereof is preferably one. Specifically, the compound having the<br>
structure represented by the following general formula (1) or (2)<br>
is preferably since the electric characteristics such as sensitivity,<br>
residual potential and the like are suitably maintained.<br><br><br>

The mono-functional radical polymerizable compound<br>
having the charge transporting structures represented by the<br>
general formulae (1), (2), or especially (3) for use in the present<br>
invention is polymerized by releasing the OC double bond in the<br>
both sides, therefore the charge transporting structure is<br>
incorporated into a polymer chain, not located at the terminals of<br>
the resultant polymer. Specifically, the charge transporting<br>
structure is incorporated in a main chain of the crosslinked<br>
polymer chain which is formed by the aforementioned<br>
mono-functional radical polymerizable compound and the tri- or<br>
more functional radical polymerizable monomer. Moreover, the<br>
charge transporting structure is incorporated in a crosslinking<br>
chain present between two main polymer chains, and such the<br>
crosslinking chain is classified into intermolecular a crosslinking<br>
chain which is present between one polymer molecular and<br>
another polymer molecular, and an intramolecular crosslinking<br>
chain which crosslinks between a segment of a main chain folded<br>
within one polymer molecular and another monomer-derived<br>
segment polymerized at a part of the main chain where is distant<br>
from the aforementioned segment. In any of these cases, a<br>
tricrylamine group which is a pendant of the main chain has at<br>
least three aryl groups spirally positioned from a nitrogen atom,<br>
and is bulky. However, it is connected with the main chain via a<br><br><br>
carbonyl group, without directly connecting to the main chain,<br>
and therefore is fixed while being fairly free in a<br>
three-dimensional space. Therefore, these triaryl amine<br>
structures are appropriately adjacent to each other in the space<br>
within the polymer, and thus the crosslinked polymer has little<br>
physical strain. In addition, in the case where the crosslinked<br>
surface layer is formed as an outermost layer, an occurrence of a<br>
problem in that the charge transporting passage is disconnected<br>
can be prevented.<br>
The radical polymerizable compound having a charge<br>
transporting structure for use in the present invention plays an<br>
important roll as it imparts the charge transporting function in<br>
the crosslinked surface layer. The amount thereof is 20% by<br>
mass to 80% by mass, and preferably 30% by mass to 70% by mass<br>
with respect to the total amount of the crosslinked surface layer.<br>
In the case where the amount thereof is less than 20% by mass,<br>
the charge transporting function of the crosslinked surface layer<br>
cannot be sufficiently maintained. In the case where the<br>
amount thereof is more than 80% by mass, the content of the tri-<br>
or more functional monomer having no charge transporting<br>
structure is decreased, and thus high abrasion resistance cannot<br>
be achieved due to the decreased density of the crosslink bond.<br>
Although it cannot be stated as the required electric<br>
characteristics and abrasion resistance are changed depending on<br><br><br>
the process for use, it is preferably in the range of 30% by mass to<br>
70% by mass in view of the balance between the both<br>
characteristics.<br>
The crosslinked surface layer is formed by curing the<br>
mixture containing at least the tri- or more functional radical<br>
polymerizable monomer having no charge transporting structure<br>
and the radical polymerizable compound having a charge<br>
transporting structure. In order to control the viscosity at the<br>
time of coating, to reduce the stress in the crosslinked surface<br>
layer, to reduce the surface energy or friction coefficient, a mono-<br>
or bi- functional radical polymerizable monomer, and/or an<br>
oligomer can be added thereto. As the aforementioned radical<br>
polymerizable monomer and/or oligomer, those known in the art<br>
can be used.<br>
Examples of monofunctional radical polymerizable<br>
monomer include 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate,<br>
2-hydroxypropyl acrylate, tetrahydrofurfuryl acrylate,<br>
2-ethylhexylcarbitol acrylate, 3-methoxybutyl acrylate, benzyl<br>
acrylate, cyclohexyl acrylate, isoamyl acrylate, isobutyl acrylate,<br>

acrylate, cetylacrylate, isostearyl acrylate, stearyl acrylate,<br>
styrene monomer, and the like.<br>
Examples of bifunctional radical polymerizable monomer<br>
include 1,3-butandiol diacrylate, l,4,butandiol diacrylate,<br><br><br>

methacrylate, and 2-perfluoroisonylethyl acrylate, in which<br>
fluorine atoms are substituted; and vinyl monomers, acrylates<br>
and monoacrylates each having a polysiloxane group such as<br>
siloxane units having a repeating number of 20 to 70, disclosed in<br>
Japanese Patent Application Publication (JP-B) Nos. 0560503<br>
and 0645770, e.g. acryloyl polydimethylsiloxianethyl,<br>
methacryloyl polydimethylsiloxane ethyl, acryloyl<br>
polydimethylsiloxane propyl, acryloyl polydimethylsiloxane butyl,<br>
diacryloyl polydimethylsiloxane diethyl and the like.<br>
Examples of the radical polymerizable oligomer include<br>
oligomers of epoxy acrylate, urethane acrylate, polyester acrylate,<br>
and the like. Note that, the large content of the mono- or bi-<br>
functional radical polymerizable monomer and/or the radical<br>
polymerizable oligomer may practically reduce the density of<br>
three-dimensional crosslinks in the crosslinked surface layer, and<br>
this may cause the declined abrasion resistance thereof.<br>
Therefore, the amount of these monomer and oligomer is 50 parts<br><br><br>
by mass or less, and preferably 30 parts by mass or less, with<br>
respect to 100 parts by mass of the tri- or more functional radical<br>
polymerizable monomer.<br>
Moreover, the crosslinked surface layer is a layer formed<br>
by applying an optical energy, and curing the mixture containing<br>
at least the tri- or more functional radical polymerizable<br>
monomer having no charge transporting structure and the radical<br>
polymerizable compound having a charge transporting structure.<br>
However, a polymerization initiator may be optionally contained<br>
in the crosslinked surface layer in order to efficiently proceed<br>
with the crosslink reaction.<br>

initiators such as benzophenone, 4-hydroxybenzophenone,<br><br><br>
o-benzoylbenzoic acid methyl ether, 2-benzoyl naphthalene,<br>
4-benzoyl bisphenyl, 4-benzoyl phenyl ether, acrylated<br>
benzophenone, and 1,4-benzyl benzene; thioxanthone<br>

photopolymerization initoators such as ethylanthraquinone,<br>

compounds, triazine compounds, imidazole compounds, and the<br>
like. In addition, photopolymerization accelerator can be used<br>
alone or in combination with the aforementioned<br>
photopolymerization initiator. Specific examples thereof include<br>
triethanol amine, methyldiethanol amine, ethyl<br>
4-dimethylaminobenzoate, isoamyl 4-dimethylaminobenzoate,<br>
2-dimethylaminoethylbenzoate,<br>
4,4'-dimethylaminobenzophenone, and the like.<br>
The aforementioned polymerization initiator can be used<br>
singly, or in combination of two or more. The amount of the<br>
polymerization initiator is 0.5 parts by mass to 40 parts by mass,<br>
and preferably 1 part by mass to 20 parts by mass, with respect to<br><br><br>
100 parts by mass of the total of the radical polymerizable<br>
contents.<br>
Furthermore, a coating solution of the crosslinked surface<br>
layer optionally contains additives such as various plasticizers<br>
(for reducing the stress and improving the adherence), leveling<br>
agent, low molecular charge transporting material having no<br>
radical polymerizability, and the like. Specific examples of the<br>
plasticizer include known plasticizers for use in general resins,<br>
such as dibutyl phthalate, and dioctyl phthalate. The added<br>
amount of the plasticizer is 20% by mass or less, and preferably<br>
10% by mass with respect to the total solid contents of the coating<br>
solution of the crosslinked surface layer. Specific examples of<br>
the leveling agent include- silicone oil such as dimethyl silicone<br>
oil, methylphenyl silicone oil, and the like; polymers and<br>
oligomers having a perfluoroalkyl group in side chains thereof.<br>
The added amount of the leveling agent is appropriately 3% by<br>
mass or less with respect to the total solids content of the coating<br>
solution of the crosslinked surface layer.<br>
The crosslinked surface layer is formed by coating the<br>
coating solution containing at least the tri- or more functional<br>
radical polymerizable monomer having no charge transporting<br>
structure and the radical polymerizable compound having a<br>
charge transporting structure, and curing the coated layer. In<br>
the case where the radical polymerizable monomer is a liquid,<br><br><br>
other components can be dissolved therein to form the coating<br>
solution of the crosslinked surface layer, but it may be further<br>
diluted with a solvent, if necessary. Specific examples of the<br>
solvent include: alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol,<br>
butanol, and the like; ketones such as acetone,<br>
methylethylketone, methylisobutylketone, cyclohexanone, and<br>

acetate, and the like. These solvents can be used singly or in<br>
combination of two or more. The dilution ratio by the solvent is<br>
arbitrary adjusted depending on the solubility of the components,<br>
coating method, intended film thickness, and the like. The<br>
coating can be performed by a dip coating method, spray coating<br>
method, bead coating method, ring coating method, or the like.<br>
After coating the aforementioned coating solution of the<br>
crosslinked surface layer, a light energy is externally applied to<br>
the coated layer so as to cure the layer. Examples of the light<br>
energy include: ultraviolet light sources, such as a high-pressure<br>
mercury lamp and metal halide lamp, each having an emission<br>
wavelength in the ultraviolet region; and visible light sources<br><br><br>
which emit the light of a wavelength region covering the<br>
absorption wavelengths of the aforementioned radical<br>
polyerizable contents and photopolymerization initiator. The<br>
light intensity of the radiation is preferably in the range of from<br>
300 mW/cm2 to 1,000 mW/cm2. When the light intensity is less<br>
than 300 mW/cm2, the curing reaction requires a long period of<br>
time to complete. When the light intensity is more than 1,000<br>
mW/cm2, the progress of the reaction becomes uneven within the<br>
layer, and thus the texture of the crosslinked surface layer<br>
becomes significantly rough.<br>
In the case where the curing is performed by the light<br>
energy, it is preferably that the oxygen density is reduced so as to<br>
prevent obstruction of crosslink by oxygen.<br>
As the composition for the coating solution of the<br>
crosslinked surface layer, the binder resin can be contained<br>
therein, provided that it does not adversely affect the smoothness,<br>
electric characteristics, or resistance of the surface of the<br>
photoconductor. However, polymer materials such as the binder<br>
resin does not have a good compatibility with polymer generated<br>
as a result of the curing reaction of the radical polymerizable<br>
composition (radical polymerizable monomer and radical<br>
polymerizable compound having a charge transporting structure),<br>
and then a phase separation may occur in the coating solution of<br>
the crosslinked surface layer. As a result, the resulted layer has<br><br><br>
a significantly irregular surface. Therefore, it is preferable that<br>
the binder resin is not contained in the coating solution of the<br>
crosslinked surface layer.<br>
In order to maintain the electric characteristics thereof,<br>
the crosslinked surface layer contains bulky- charge transporting<br>
structures therein, and it is necessary to increase the density of<br>
crosslinks so as to increase the physical strength. If the curing<br>
reaction of such the crosslinked surface layer is rapidly<br>
progressed, after being coated, by externally applying extremely<br>
high energy, the curing is proceeded unevenly and thus the<br>
resulted layer ends up having an irregular surface. Therefore, it<br>
is preferably to use an external light energy which is capable of<br>
controlling the reaction speed depending on the light intensity<br>
and the usage amount of the polymerization initiator.<br>
The coating method of the crosslinked surface layer is<br>
explained as follow. In the case where an acrylate monomer<br>
having three acryloyloxy groups and a tryarylamine compound<br>
having one acryloyloxy group are used for the coating solution,<br>
the usage ratio thereof is 7/3 to 3/7. The polymerization<br>
initiator is added thereto at 3% by mass to 20% by mass with<br>
respect to the total amount of the acrylate compound, and a<br>
solvent is added thereto so as to prepare the coating solution. In<br>
the case where tryarylamine donor is used as the charge<br>
transporting material and polycarbonate is used as the binder<br><br><br>
resin in the charge transporting layer which is the underlying<br>
layer of the crosslinked surface layer, and the crsslinked surface<br>
layer is formed by spray coating, the aforementioned solvent of<br>
the coating solution is preferably tetrahydrofuran, 2-butanone,<br>
ethyl acetate, or the like, and the usage ratio of such the solvent<br>
is preferably 3 times to 10 times of the total amount of the<br>
acrylate compound.<br>
Sequentially, the coating solution prepared in the manner<br>
mentioned above is coating by spraying on, for example, a<br>
photoconductor wherein an undercoat layer, a charge generating<br>
layer, and the aforementioned charge transporting layer are<br>
laminated on a substrate, e.g. an aluminum cylinder, in this order.<br>
Thereafter, it is dried at a relatively low temperature for a short<br>
period (25°C to 80°C, 1 minute to 10 minutes), and then is cured<br>
by heating or UV irradiation.<br>
A metal halide lamp or the like is used for the UV<br>
irradiation, and the illuminance (365 nm) thereof is preferably in<br>
the range of 300 mW/cm2 to 1,000 mW/cm2. In the case where<br>
the UV light is irradiated at 600 mW/cm2, the entire surface of<br>
the coated layer is uniformly exposed to the UV light for 45 to 360<br>
seconds while rotating the drum of the photoconductor. At this<br>
time, the temperature of the drum is adjusted so as not to exceed<br>
100°C.<br>
After the completion of the curing, it is heated at 100°C to<br><br><br>
150°C for 10 minutes to 30 minutes so as to reduce the residual<br>
solvent, to thereby yield the photoconductor.<br>
