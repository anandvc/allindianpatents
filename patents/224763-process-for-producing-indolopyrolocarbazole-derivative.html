				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING INDOLOPYRROLOCARBAZOLE DERIVATIVE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention is useful ir. the field of medicine.<br>
More specifically, the present invention relates to a process<br>
for industrially advantageously producing a compound which is<br>
useful in the filed of medicine.<br>
Background Art<br>
An indolopyrrolocarbazole derivative produced by the<br>
process of the present invention, which is represented by the<br>
formula (I):<br>
has an anticancer effect, and the compound has now been<br>
clinically tested (Mitsuru Ohkubo et al., Bioorganic &amp;<br>
Medicinal Chemistry Letters, vol. 9, pages 3307-3312, 1999).<br>
Production processes of the compound of the present<br>
invention have been disclosed in WO95/30682 and WO01/62769.<br>
Also, a production process of an indolopyrrolocarbazole<br>
(wherein R1 represents a hydroxy-protecting group) is disclosed<br>
in Organic Synthesis Collective Volumes, vol. 7. page 34.<br>
In addition, a hydrogenation reaction using a rhodium<br>
compound, wherein a large amount of iron powders is used as a<br>
catalyst for the reduction of the nitro group of a nitrobenzene<br>
derivative in an acid solvent such as acetic acid has been known<br>
(US-A-5.105,012).<br>
Furthermore, a production process of a bis-indole<br>
compound represented by the formula (VIII):<br>
(wherein R represents a hydrogen atom, a C1-C7 alkyl group, a<br>
phenyl group, a benzyloxymethyl group or an aralkyl group) is<br>
disclosed in WO95-30682.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to eliminate the<br>
undesirable aspects in conventional processes for producing an<br>
indolopyrrolocarbazole derivative represented by the formula<br>
(I) which is useful as a medicine. In other words, an object<br>
of the present invention is to provide a production process in<br>
which a reagent having high risks in production operations and<br>
imposing a heavy environmental burden is not used and a<br>
low-yield step is not included.<br>
In a known process for producing an indole compound<br>
(Organic synthesis Collective volumes, vol. 7. page 34), a<br>
reduction step is conducted using hydrazine in the presence of<br>
a Raney nickel catalyst. This process, however, is not<br>
desirable for the industrial production, since hydrazine<br>
involves a high risk of explosion. Furthermore, since the<br>
necessary amount of a Raney nickel catalyst is large, the<br>
environmental burden due to post-production waste liquid<br>
treatment is heavy, which indicates that this production<br>
process is not desirable in the case of industrial mass<br>
production.<br>
In addition, the yield is low in known processes for<br>
producing a bis-indole compound, and therefore those processes<br>
are economically inefficient.<br>
On the other hand, a hydrogenation reaction using a<br>
rhodium compound, wherein a large amount of iron powder is used<br>
as a catalyst for the reduction of the nitxo group of a<br>
nitrobenzene derivative in an acidic medium such as acetic acid<br>
has been known (US-A-5,105,012). In this case, since<br>
hydrogenation reaction is conducted under acidic conditions,<br>
this method is not applicable for those materials which are not<br>
stable under acidic conditions.<br>
The present inventors had carried out intensive studies<br>
on a process for producing an indolopyrrolocarbazole derivative<br>
of the formula (I), and found the following (i) to (v).<br>
(i) a novel process for producing an<br>
indolopyrrolocarbazole derivative of the formula (I), which has<br>
a low environmental burden in terms of waste liquid treatment<br>
after production, which is economically excellent, and whose<br>
production operation can be carried out safely and with good<br>
reproducibility as an industrial production process.<br>
(ii) a safe and novel process for producing an indole<br>
derivative of the formula (XII),<br>
(iii) a novel and economically improved process for<br>
producing a bis-indole derivative of the formula (VIII),<br>
(iv) a novel hydrogenation catalyst which is safe, has<br>
a low environmental burden caused by waste liquid treatment,<br>
and can be used not only under an acid condition but also under<br>
other conditions, and<br>
(v) a process for producing the compound (VII), in which<br>
step control is easy and generation of hydrogen cyanide as a<br>
byproduct in the ring-closure reaction using<br>
l,2-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-l,4-benzoquinone can be prevented.<br>
The present inventors conducted further investigations,<br>
and finally completed the present invention.<br>
Namely, the present invention relates to a novel process<br>
for producing an indolopyrrolocarbazole derivative of the<br>
formula (I), a novel process for producing an indole derivative,<br>

compound and metal compound. Additional presence of an amine<br>
in the reaction can improve the reaction rate and the yield.<br>
The reaction rate can be dramatically improved with use of an<br>
amine. The amine includes a primary amine, a secondary amine<br>
or a tertiary amine, and more specifically includes an amine<br>
such as pyrrolidine, piperidine, dimethylamine, diethylamine,<br>
dlisopropylamine, dibutylamine, trimethylamine,<br>
triethylamine and tributylamine, preferably a secondary amine<br>
or a tertiary amine, and more preferably pyrrolidine.<br>
The amine is usually used in an amount of about 0.01 to<br>
10 eguivalents,<br>
relative to the material to be hydrogenated (for example,<br>
compound (XIII)). Moreover, not by supplementary adding an<br>
amine to the reaction solution, but by appropriately selecting<br>
a reactant to generate the amine in the reaction solution with<br>
the progress of hydrogenation according to the reaction of the<br>
present invention, further addition of an amine is not<br>
necessary.<br>
Aqueous ammonia and brine are added to the reaction<br>
solution (suspension) obtained in this step, preferably a<br>
suspension thereof, and the mixture is stirred for about one<br>
hour and filtered to separate a solid, and then the residue was<br>
washed with a solvent such as benzene, toluene or xylene. The<br>
filtrate and the washing are combined and then washed<br>
successively with aqueous citric acid, 5% aqueous sodium<br>
bicarbonate and brine, and then concentrated in vacuo to dryness .<br>
After dissolving the resulting compound of the formula (XII)<br>
or a salt thereof in a solvent such as benzene, toluene, xylene<br>
and the like, the solution is placed into a column filled with<br>
silica gel of the same weight of the compound (XII) or a filter<br>
whose surface is covered with the said silica gel, and by<br>
applying pressure with an inert gas such as nitrogen. The<br>
present inventors found that impurities generated in the<br>
reaction step such as colored substances can be effectively<br>
removed with the above silica gel purification. The purity of<br>
the compound (XII) is improved by the present purification<br>
method, and reactions and purification of the products in<br>
subsequent steps can be therefore operated in industrially<br>
advantageous manners without a special method.<br>

The present invention also relates to a hydrogenation<br>
catalyst comprising the aforementioned rhodium compound and the<br>
aforementioned metal compound.<br>
This catalyst is used for the reduction of compounds and<br>
contains the aforementioned rhodium compound and metal compound.<br>
According to the present invention, coexisting state cr mixed<br>
state of the rhodium compound and the metal compound is the<br>
claimed invention. Therefore, in the catalyst of the present<br>
invention, for example, a solvent may be contained or exist in<br>
addition to a rhodium compound and a metal compound. The<br>
reduction reaction in which the catalyst of the present<br>
invention is utilized should not be limited to the reduction<br>
reaction in the above (1). while reduction of nitro groups to<br>
amino groups, and reduction of alkenyl groups or alkynyl groups<br>
to the corresponding alkyl groups are preferable. The catalyst<br>
of the present invention has specific actions when it is used<br>
in the reduction of nitro groups to amino groups, and reduction<br>
of alkenyl groups or alkynyl groups to the corresponding alkyl<br>
groups, and it is very useful for industrial purposes. As an<br>
example of the said specific actions, a remarkable point is that,<br>
in the reduction of nitro groups to amino groups and in the<br>
reduction of alkenyl groups or alkynyl groups to the<br>
corresponding alkyl groups, even if the material to be reduced<br>
has groups other than nitro, alkenyl or alkynyl, such as<br>
benzyloxy, carbonyl, e.g. aldehyde or ketone, or halogen in<br>
addition to nitro, alkenyl or alkynyl, the reduction of the<br>
groups other than nitro. alkenyl or alkynyl is substantially<br>
stopped or suppressed, or the reduction of nitro groups to amino<br>
groups and the reduction of alkenyl groups or alkynyl groups<br>
to the corresponding alkyl groups are predominant over the<br>
reduction of the groups other than nitro, alkenyl or alkynyl.<br>
Furthermore, the catalyst of the invention also showed that an<br>
action of accelerating the reduction of nitro groups to amino<br>
groups and the reduction of alkenyl groups or alkynyl groups<br>
to the corresponding alkyl groups. When, in particular,<br>
catalytic reduction is conducted using a supported rhodium<br>
catalyst and a catalyst comprising iron salt, nickel salt or<br>
cobalt salt as a metal compound, the reduction of functional<br>
groups such as benzyl ether, aryl halides, aldehydes or ketones<br>
is substantially stopped or suppressed, and thus the selective<br>
reduction of nitro groups to amino groups and the selective<br>
reduction of alkenyl groups or alkynyl groups to the<br>
corresponding alkyl groups become possible. Consequently, by<br>
using the catalyst of the present invention in a reduction<br>
reaction, complicated steps taken in conventional reduction<br>
reactions involving protection with protecting groups,<br>
subsequent reduction procedure and deprotection are not<br>
required.<br>
In the present invention, it is preferable that the<br>
aforementioned catalyst further contains the aforementioned<br>
amine in addition to a rhodium compound and a metal compound,<br>
as mentioned above. When the catalyst containing an amine<br>
according to the present invention is used, the reaction rate<br>
is dramatically accerelated, the reduction rate of functional<br>
groups which are easily reduced such as benzyl ether is<br>
decreased, and more specific reduction of nitro, alkenyl or<br>
alkynyl can be achieved and thus the yield of the reduced product<br>
is improved, as compared to the case where the aforementioned<br>
catalyst not containing an amine is used.<br>

c]carbazole-5,7(6H) -dione (21-) in tetrahydrofuran (175 g/L,<br>
6.4 L, 1.12 kg), isopropanol (7.9 L) and 3N HC1 (224 mL) were<br>
added thereto. The mixture was hydrogenated while vigorous<br>
stirring at 40°C under a hydrogen pressure of 40 psi for 4 to<br>
14 hours until absorbance of hydrogen becomes to be<br>
theoretically 110 %. The reaction solution was cooled to 25°C<br>
and filtered with Solka Floe (Registered Trade Mark) to collect<br>
solids such as catalyst. Such solid was washed with<br>
isopropanol/tetrahydrofuran (3:2) (3L x 1) . The filtrate and<br>
the washing were combined, and the solution was adjusted to pH<br>
2.5 with 1M triethylamine/isopropanol (about 600 mL). After<br>
addition of water (4.0 L), the solution was concentrated to a<br>
volume of 7.5 L in atmospheric pressure, further concentrated<br>
while adding isopropanol/water (4:1) (6.5 L), and finally<br>
concentrated to a water content of 20 % (w/v) while further<br>
supplying isopropanol (about 9 L) and maintaining the volume<br>
at about 7.5 L. The concentrate was kept at 70°C, and a<br>
suspension of seed crystals (5 g) in isopropanol (50 mL) was<br>
added thereto. The mixture was kept at 70°C for one hour, and<br>
isopropanol (5.0 L) was added over a period of 1.5 hours. The<br>
resultant solution was kept at 70°C for 9 to 24 hours to<br>
precipitate crystals. The resultant suspension was<br>
concentrated in atmospheric pressure while supplying<br>
isopropanol (17 L) until water content in the concentrate<br>
becomes to be 3 w/v %. The suspension was kept at 70°C for 3<br>
to 6 hours, cooling to 22°C and kept at the same temperature<br>
for one hour. The suspension was filtered to give a cake, which<br>
was washed successively with isopropanol (2.5 L) and methanol<br>
(1.5 L) . The cake was dried in vacuo at 38°C for 6 hours to<br>
give orange crystals in 80 % or higher yield (content: 99 % or<br>
higher). Since mass spectrum, NMR spectrum and IR spectrum of<br>
the above orange crystals agreed to those of the compound of<br>
Example 6 described in WO 95/30682, the objective compound (13)<br>
of this Example was identified as 12,13-dihydro-2,10-<br>
