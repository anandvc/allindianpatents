1.        Title:   A process for the preparation of (Z)-(6R, 7R)-3-(aeetoxymethyl)-7-[2-(2-amino-l,3-thiazol-4-yI)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-8-oxo-5-thia-l-azabicyclo [4,2,0]oct-2-en-2-carboxylic acid (Cefotaxime acid).<br>
Applicant:      Claris Lifesciences Limited,<br>
Claris Corporate Headquarters, Nr.Parimal Crossing, Ellisbridge, Ahmedabad - 380 006, Gujarat, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in<br>
which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
Field of Invention :<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the production of (Z)-(6R, 7R)-3-(acetoxmethyl)-7-[2-(2-amino-l,3-thiazol-4-yl)-2-rnethoxyiminoacetamido]-S-oxo-5-thia -l-azabicyclo[4,2,0]oct-2-en-2-carboxylic acid (Cefotaxime acid). The synthesis of Cefotaxime acid comprises the condensation of S-(2-benzothiazoyl)-2-(2-arnino-thaiazol-4-yl)-2-rnethoxyimino thioacetate with 7-amino-3-acetoxyrnethyl-3-cephem-4-carbcoxylic acid in presence of aqueous organic solvent and organic base. Cefotaxime acid is subsequently isolated by organic acid.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cephalosporin: Any of a group of broad-spectrum derived from species of fungi of the genus Cephalosporium and is related to the penicillins in both structure and mode of action but relatively penicillinase-resistant antibiotics. These antibiotics have low toxicity for the host, considering their broad antibacterial spectrum. They have the active nucleus of beta-lactam ring, which results in a variety of antibacterial and pharmacological characteristics when modified mainly by substitution at 3 and 7 positions. Their antibacterial activities result from the inhibition of mucopeptide synthesis in the cell wall. They are widely used to treat gonorrhea, meningitis, pneumococcal, staphylococcal and streptococcal infections. The cephalosporin class of antibiotics is usually divided into generations by their antimicrobial properties. Three generations of cephalosporins are recognised and the fourth has been grouped. Each newer generation of cephalosporins has broader range of activity against Gram-negative organisms but a narrower range of activity against Gram-positive organisms than the<br>
2<br><br>
preceding generation. The newer agents have much longer half-lives resulting in the decrease of dosing frequency. Accordingly, the third-generation cephalosporins can penetrate into tissues well and thus antibiotic levels are good in various body fluids.<br>
Cefotaxime is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotics, it has broad-spectrum activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism. The bactericidal activity of Cefotaxime works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. Cefotaxime shows high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) in the cell wall including PBP lb and PBP III. A positive feature of Cefotaxime is that it displays a resistance to penicillinases and is useful to treat infections that are resistant to penicillin derivatives. Cefotaxime has in vitro activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Cefotaxime should be administered by both Intravenous as well as Intramuscular route.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Cephalosporin antibiotics inhibit bacteria by interfering with the synthesis of essential structural components of the bacterial cell wall. They are considered as highly effective antibiotics with low toxicity and are used for treating a wide variety of bacterial infections. A number of cephalosporin derivatives have been discovered with increased potency and improved stability. Ochiai et al. (U.S. Patent No. USG409SSSS) described cephem compounds and processes for their preparation. Heyrnes et al. (U.S. Patent No.4,152,432) described 3- aeetoxymethyl-7-(iminoacetamido) cephalosporonic acid derivatives, in particular Cefotaxime, and process for preparing the derivatives.<br>
The "third-generation cephalosporins" generally consist of 3-methyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid derivatives substituted in the 7p-position by an a-<br>
3<br><br>
(2-aminothia3zol-4-yl)-α-hyclroxyimirnoacetamido group, in which the hydroxy group is free or substituted with an alliyl group, optionally substituted by a carboxy group, and substituted on the methyl group in the 3-position with the residue of a nucleophilic compound.<br>
The above mentioned third-generation cephalosporins have been described for the first time in the published German application DE2556736 (corresponding to U.S. Pat. No. US055S3216) and, principally are compounds encompassed by the general formula A<br>
Formula A<br><br>
wherein R4 is the residue of a nucleophilic compound and R3 is a hydroxy group which may be protected, including their pharrnaceutically acceptable esters, the respective salts and the relative solvates. Among these third-generation cephalosporins, the 7(β.-[α-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-a-hydroxyimino]acetamido-3-methyl-3-cephem-4-carbo.xylic acid derivatives of formula A, in which Rs is methoxy and R4 is a 2-furoylthio group (Ceftiofur), an acetoxy group (Cefotaxime) or a l,2,5,6-tetrahydro-2-methyl-5,6-dio::o-l,2,4-triazin-3-ylthio group (Ceftriaxone) are particularly interesting compounds.<br>
The 7β-[a-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-α-hydroxyiminojacetamido-3-methyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid derivatives in which the 3-rnethyl group is substituted with the residue of a nucleophilic compound are prepared<br>
4<br><br>
according to the general method, described in DE2556736 and U.S. Pat. No US05583216, which comprises introducing the α-(2-aminothiaizol-4-yl)-a-hydroxyiminoacetyl radical, wherein the hydroxy and amino groups are suitably protected, onto the amino group of a 7β -amino-3-methylcephem-4-carboxylic acid in which the methyl group is substituted with the residue of a nucleophilic compound.<br>
Finally, T. Aoki et al. (Tetrahedron 1983, 34/15, 2515-2556 in particular pages 2520-2525) disclose the synthesis of diphenylrnethyl 7β -(2-thienylaceta.rnino)-3-( 1 -methyl- lH-tetrazol-5-yl) thiomethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylate, which involves the preparation of diphenylrnethyl 7β -(2-thienylacetamino)-3-(l-methyl-lH-tetrazol-5-yl)-3-methylthiocephem- 4-carboxylate via the corresponding 3-methylthio-3-chloromethylcephern analog and the reaction of said diphenylrnethyl 7p-(2-thienylacetarnino)-3-(1 -methyl-1 H-tetrasol-5-yl)-3-rnethylthiocephem-4-carboxylate with m-chloroperbensoic acid in order to remove methylmercaptan and form a 3-(l-methyl-lH-tetrazol-5-yl)-3-cephem structure via the corresponding 1-oxide. However, the method described by Aoki et al. is not transposable to the preparation of third-generation cephalosporins because the reactants employed affect the amino group, which is present on the thiazole ring and is sensitive thereto.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. US04767S52 (1988) discloses a process for the preparation of known 2-oxyiminoacelamido-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid derivatives, including Cefotaxime and Ceftriaxone, by acylating 7-amino-3-cephem-4-earboxylic acid derivatives already substituted at the 3- position with 2-mercaptobenzothiazolyl-(Z)-2-(2-aminothi:a2;ol-4-yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetate, the latter being often referred to as MAEM. As the first step in the process disclosed in that patent, 7-amino-cephalosporanic acid (7-ACA) already suitably substituted at the 3-position is acylated at the 7-position using MAEM as the acylating agent. Thus MAEM has become the standard<br>
5<br><br>
acylating agent for the preparation of cephalosporins having an oximino group and a 2-aminothiazolyl group in the 7-acylamiclo-side chain.<br>
US Patent No. US05317099 describes a process for the synthesis of p-lactam derivatives such as Cefotaxime and Ceftriaxone in which silylated 7-ACA is acylated with acyloxyphosphonium chloride derivative of 2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-syn-methoxyimino acetic acid, which in turn is prepared from triphenylphosphine (TPP), hexachloroe thane or carbon tetrachloride and 2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-syn-methoxyimino acetic acid. Since, TPP is used as reactant and hence the overall cost becomes high.<br>
US Patent No. US050379SS describes a process for the production of cephalosporins, in particular Cefotaxime and Ceftriaxone, in which an activated form of an organic acid, i.e., 2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-oxyiminoacetyl sulfitedialkylfonniminium halide hyclrohalide is coupled with a 7-arniriocephalosporanic acid derivative. The compound of 2-(2-aminothiasol-4-yl)-2-oxyiminoacetyl sulfitedialkylfomimirnium halide hyclrohalide was prepared by reacting 2-(2-aminothiacol-4-yl)-2-oximino acetic acid with dimethylformiminium chloride chlorosulfite which in turn was prepared by reacting approximately equimolar quantities of thionyl chloride and dimethylformamicle at room temperature in specific solvents only like benzene or toluene and hence suffers from a limitation.<br>
Object of the present invention is to over come the above said problem and provide a simple, very mild reaction condition, shorter time, and cost-effective method for preparation of Cefotaxime acid in pure form.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a simple, efficient and commercially feasible method for the production of a Cefotaxime acid.  The process of the<br>

The embodiment provides the production of Cefotaxime acid. The process comprises the reaction of S- (2-benzothiazolyl-2-(2- aminothia3ol-4-yl)-2-methoxyimino thioacetate with 7-Amino-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid in aqueous tetra hydro furan and organic base triethylamine.
