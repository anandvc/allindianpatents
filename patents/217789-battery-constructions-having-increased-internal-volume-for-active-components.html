				<td>BATTERY CONSTRUCTIONS HAVING INCREASED INTERNAL VOLUME<br>
FOR ACTIVE COMPONENTS<br>
The present invention generally relates to an electrochemical cell construction More particularly, the present invention relates to the containers and collector assemblies used for an electrochemical cell, such as an alkaline cell<br>
Figure 1 shows the construction of a conventional C sized alkaline cell 10. As shown, cell 10 includes a cyhndncally shaped can 12 having an open end and a closed end   Can 12 is preferably formed of an electrically conductive matenal, such that an outer cover 11 welded to a bottom surface 14 at the closed end of can 12 serves as an electrical contact terminal for the cell<br>
Cell 10 further typically includes a first electrode matenal 15, which may serve as the positive electrode (also known as a cathode)  The first electrode matenal 15 may be preformed and inserted into can 12, or may be moulded m place so as to contact the inner surfaces of the can 12  For an alkaline cell, first electrode matenal 15 will typically include Mn02- After the first electrode 15 has been provided in can 12, a separator 17 is inserted into the space defined by first electrode 15. Separator 17 is preferably a non-woven fabnc. Separator 17 is provided to maintain a physical separation of the first electrode matenal 15 and a mixture of electrolyte and a second electrode matenal 20 while allowing the transport of ions between the electrode matenals<br>
Once separator 17 is m place within the cavity defined by first electrode 15, an electrolyte is dispensed into the space defined by separator 17, along with the mixture 20 of electrolyte and a second electrode matenal, which may be the negatne electrode (also known as the anode)  The electrolyte/second electrode mixture 20 preferably includes a gelling agent   For a typical alkaline cell, mixture 20 is formed of a mixture of an aqueous KOH electrolyte and zinc, which serves as the second electrode matenal Water and additional additives may also be included in mixture 20<br>
Once the liist electrode 15, separator 17, the clectrolyic and mixture 20 have been formed inside can 12, a preassembled collector assembly 25 is inserted into the open end of can 12   Can 12 is typically slightly tapered at its open end   This taper serves to support the collector assembly in a descired onentation prior to securing it in place   After collector assembly 25 has been inserted, an outer cover 45 is placed over collector assembly 25   Collector assembly 25 is secured in place by radially squeezing the can against collector assembly 25   The end edge 13 of can 12 is crimped over the peripheral lip of collector assembly 25, thereby securing outer cover 45 and collector assembly 25 within the end of can 12   As described further below, one function served by collector assembly 25 is to provide for a second external electrical contact for the electrochemical cell   Additionally, collector assembly 25 must seal the open end of can 12 to prevent the electrochemical materials therein from leaking from this cell Additionally, collectoi assembly 25 must exhibit sufficient strength to withstand the physical abuse to which batteries are typically exposed   Also because electrochemical cells may produce hydrogen gas. collectoi assembly 25 may allow internally generated hydrogen gas to permeate therethrough to escape to the exterior of the electrochemical cell   Further, collector assembly 25 should include some form of pressure relief mechanism to relieve piessure produced internally within the cell should this pressure become excessive   Such conditions may occur when the electrochemical cell internally generates hydrogen gas at a rate that exceeds that at which the internally generated hydrogen gas can permeate through the collector assembly to the exterior of the cell<br>
The collector assembly 25 shown in Figure 1 includes a seal 30. a collector nail 40, an inner cover 44, a washei 50, and a plurality of spurs 52   Seal 30 is shown as including a central hub 32 having a hole through which collector nail 40 is inserted Seal 30 further includes a V-shaped portion 34 that may contact an upper surtace 16 of first electrode 15<br>
Seal 30 also includes a peripheral upstanding wall ^6 that extends upward along the periphery of seal 30 in an annular fashion   Peripheral upstanding wall 3b not onlv series as a seal between the interface ot collectoi assembly 25 and can 12 but also<br>
seivcs as an electrical insulator for preventing an electrical short (torn occuriing between the positive can and negative contact tciminal of the cell<br>
Inner covci 44, which is formed of a rigid metal, is provided to increase the rigidity and support the radial compression of collector assembly 25 thereby improving the sealing effectiveness   As shown in Figure I, inner cover 44 is configured to contact central hub portion 32 and peripheral upstanding wall 36   By configuring collector assembly 25 in this fashion, inner cover 44 serves to enable compression of central hub portion 32 by collector nail 40 while also supporting compression of peripheral upstanding wall 36 by the inner surface of can 12.<br>
Outer co\er 45 is typically made of a nickel-plated steel and is configured to extend from a region defined by the annular penpheral upstanding wall 36 of seal 30 and to be in electrical contact with a head portion 42 of collector nan 40   Outer covci 45 may be welded to head portion 42 of collector nail 40 to prevent any loss of contact. As shown in Figure 1, when collector assembly 25 is inserted into the open end of can 12, collector nail 40 penetrates deeply within the electrolyte/second electrode mixture 20 to establish sufficient electrical contact therewith. In the example shown in Figure 1, outer cover 45 includes a penpheral lip 47 that extends upwardly along the circumference of outer cover 45   By forming penpheral upstanding wall 36 of seal 30 of a length greater than that of penpheral lip 47, a portion of penpheral upstanding wall 36 may be folded over penpheral lip 47 dunng the cnmping process so as to prevent any portion of the upper edge 13 of can 12 from coming into contact with outer cover 45<br>
Seal 30 is preferably formed of nylon   In the configuration shown in Figure 1, a pressure relief mechanism is provided for enabling the relief of internal pressure when such pressure becomes excessive   Furthei, inner cover 44 and outer cover 45 are tvpically proMded with apertures 43 that allow hydrogen gas to escape to the extenor of cell 10   The mechanism shown includes an annular metal washer 50 and a plurality of spurs 52 that are provided between seal 30 and inner cover 44   Each spur 52 includes a pointed end 51 that is pressed against a thin intermediate portion 38 of seal 30   Spurs 52 are biased against the lower inner surface of inner covci such that when the internal<br>
pressuree of cell 10 incicases and seal 30 consequent!} becomes deformed by pressing upward toward inner cover 44, the pointed ends S3 of spurs 52 penetrate through the thin intermediate portion 38 ol seal M) thereby luptunng seal 30 and allouing the escape of the internally-geneiated gas through apertures 43.<br>
Although the above-described collector assembly 25 performs all the above-noted desirable functions satisfactorily, as apparent from its cross-sectional profile this particular collector assembly occupoes a sinificant amount of space within the intenor of the cell 10. It should be noted that the construction shown in Figure 1 is but one example of a cell construction. Other collector assemblies exist that may have lower profiles and hence occupy less space within the cell. However, such collector assemblies typically achieve this reduction in occupied volume at the expense of the sealing charactcnstics of the collector assembly or the perfonnance and reliability of the pressure rehef mechanism<br>
The measured external and internal volumes for several batteries that were commercially available at the priority date of this application are listed in the tables shown in Figures 2A and 2B   The tables list the volumes (cc) for D, C, AA, and AAA sized batteries. The collector assembly volume and the percentage of the total cell volume that constitutes the collector assembly volume is provided in Figure 2B for those commercially available batteries listed in Figure 2A. Also provided in Figure 2A is a percentage of the total cell volume that constitutes the internal volume that is available for containing the electrochemically active materials<br>
The "total cell volume" includes all ol the volume, including any internal void spaces, of the battery. For the battery shown in Figure 1, the total volume ideally includes all of the crss-hatched area as shown in Figure 3A. The "internal soiume" oi the battery is represented by the cross-hatched area shown in Figure 3B   The internal volume", as used herein, is that volume inside the cell or battery that contains the electrochemically active materials as well as am voids and chemically men materials (other than ihe collector nail) that are confined .vuhin the sealed volume ot the cell Such chemically inert materials mas include separalois, conductors, and aiis men<br>
additives in the electrodes. As described herein, the term "electiochemic.tllv active matenals" includes the positive and negative electrodes and the electiolyte   The "collector assembly volume" includes the collector nail, seal, innci cover, washer, spurs and any void volume between the bottom surface of the negative cover and the seal (indicated by the cross-hatched area in Figure 3C). The "container volume" includes the volume of the can, label, negative cover (outer cover 45), void volume between the label and negative covei. positive cover, and void volume between the positive cover and can (shown by the cross-hatched area in Figure 3D). If the label extends onto and into contact with the negative cover, the void volume present between the label and negative cover is included in the container volume, and therefore is also considered as part of the total volume. Otherwise, that void volume is not included in either of the container volume or the total volume.<br>
It should be appreciated that the sum total of the "internal volume", "collector assembly volume", and "container volume" is equal to the "total volume" Accordingly, the internal volume available for electrochemically active matenals can be confirmed by measuring the collector assembly volume and container volume and subtracting the collector assembly volume and the container volume from the measured total volume of the battery.<br>
Because the exterior dimensions of the electrochemical cell are generally fixed by the Amencan National Standards Institute (ANSI) or other standards organisations, the greater the space occupied by the collector assembly, the less space that mere is available within the cell for the electrocheinical matenals   Consequcnth. a reduction in the amount of electrochemical matenals that may be provided within the cell results in a shorter service life for the cell. It is therefore desirable to maximise the inienoi volume within an electrochemical cell that is available foi the electrochemically ac"ive components<br>
We have now found that this may be achieved by constnu ting an electrochemical cell where the space occupied by the collector assembly and The- spacer<br>
occupied by the container volume arc minimised while still maintaining adequate sealing charactenstics and allowing a reliable pressure relict mechanism<br>
Accordingly, it is an aspect of the present invention to solve the above problems by either eliminating the collector assembly from the cell while retaining its functions, or by providing a collector assembly having a significantly lower profile and thereby occupying significantly less space within an electrochemical cell   Another aspect of the present invention is to provide cell constructions exhibiting lower water loss over time than pnor assemblies, thereby increasing the cell"s shelf life   An additional aspect of the invention is to provide a battery having a reliable pressure relief mechanism that does not occupy a significant percentage of the available cell volume. Still yet another aspect of the present invention is to provide cell constructions that are simpler to manufacture and that require less materials, thereby possibly having lower manufacturing costs Another aspect of the invention is to provide cell constructions that require less radial compressive force to be applied by the can to adequately seal the cell, thereby allowing for the use of a can having thinner side walls, and thus resulting in greater internal cell volume<br>
To achieve the above aspects and advantages, a battery of the present invention comprises a can having an open end and a closed end, and a cover positioned across the open end of the can. the cover and can defining an internal volume within the can in which electrochemically active materials including at least positive and negative electrodes and an electrolyte are contained, charactensed in that the internal volume is at least 88 4 percent of the total volume ol the battery"<br>
These and other features, advantages, and objects of the present invention will be further understood and appreciated by those skilled in the art by reference to the following specification, claims, and appended drawings<br>

As described above, a primary objective of the present invention is to increase the internal volume available in a battery for containing the electrochemically active materials to volumes previously not obtained. To achieve this objective without detrimentally decreasing the reliability of the pressure relief mechanism provided in the<br>
battery and without increasing the likelihood that the battery would otherwise leak, various novel modifications are suggested below to the construction of batteries of various sizes. The modifications described below may be implemented separately or in combination in a battery to improve its volume efficiency.<br>
As described in further detail below, the various modifications of the present invention that achieve greater internal volume for containing the electrochemically active materials, include a low profile seal (Figure 4), an ultra low profile seal (Figure 5), a positive outer cover protrusion formed directly in the closed end of the can used in combination with the ultra low profile seal (Figure 6) or the low profile sea), a can vent formed in the closed end of the battery can (Figures 7-9) including an L-shaped and J-shaped annular seal (Figures 8A-8C), a beverage can-type construction used in combination with a can vent (Figure 11). and a beverage can-type construction with a collector feed through (Figures 15-17).<br>
Additionally, through the use of the constructions noted above, the battery can may be made with thinner walls, on the order of 0.10-0.20 mm (4-8 mils), since the construction techniques outlined below do not require the thicker walls that are required in conventional batteries to ensure a sufficient crimp and seal. Further, in accordance with the present invention, a label may be lithographed directly onto the exterior surface of the battery can. By making the can walls thinner and lithographing the label directly onto the exterior of the can, the internal volume of the cell may be further increased since one does not have to account for the thickness of the label substrate to construct a cell that meets the ANSI exterior size standards.<br>
The total battery volume, collector assembly volume, and internal volume "available for electrochemically active material for each battery are determined by viewing a Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawing, a photograph, or an actual cross section of the batter)/ which has been encased in epoxy and longitudinally cross-sectioned. The use of a CAD drawing, photograph, or actual longitudinal cross section to view and measure battery dimensions allows tor inclusion of all void volumes that might be present in the battery   To measure the total battery volume, the cross-sectional<br>
view of the battery taken through its central longitudinal axis ol symmetr\ is viewed and the entue volume is measuied by gcomcinc computation   To measuie the internal volume available lor electiochemically active inatenals, the cross-sectional uew ol the battel y taken through its central longitudinal axis of symmetry is viewed and the components making up the internal volume, which includes the electrochemically active matenals, void volumes and chemically inert matenals (other than the collector nail) that are confined within the sealed volume of the cell, are measured by geometric computation   Likewise, to determine volume of the collector assembly, the cross-sectional view of the battery taken through its central longitudinal axis of symmetry thereof is viewed, and the components making up the collector assembly volume, which include the collector nail, seal, inner cover, and any void volume defined between the bottom surface of the negative cover and the seal, are measured by geometric computation   The container volume may likewise be measured by viewing the central longitudinal cross section of the battery and computing the volume consumed by the can, label, negative cover. void volume between the label and negative cover, positive cover, and void volume between the positive cover and the can<br>
The volume measurements are made by viewing a cross section of the battery taken through its longitudinal axis of symmetry   This provides for an accurate volume measurement, since the battery and its components are usually axial symmetnc   To obtain a geometric view of the cross section of a battery, the battery was first potted in epoxy and, after the epoxy solidified, the potted battery and its components were ground down to the central cross section through the axis of symmetry   More particularly, the battery was first potted in epoxy and then ground short of the central cross section Next, all internal components such as the anode, cathode, and separator paper were removed in order to better enable measurement of the finished cross section   The potted battery was then cleaned of any remaining debris, was air dried, and the remaining \ oid volumes were filled with epoxy to gi\e the battery some integrity before completing the grinding and polishing to its centre   The battery was again ground and polished until finished to its central cross section, was thereafter traced into a drawing and the volumes measured therefrom<br>
Pnor to potting the battery in epoxy, battery measurements were taken with callipeis to measure the overall height, the crimp height, and the outside diameterat the top, bottom, and centre of the battery   In addition, an identical battery was disassembled and the components thereof were measured. These measurements of components of the disassembled battery include the diameter of the current collector nail, the length of the current collector nail, the length of the current collector nail to the negative cover, and the outside diameter of the top, bottom, and centre of the battery without the label present.<br>
Once the battery was completely potted in epoxy and ground to centre through the longitudinal axis of symmetry, the cross-sectional view of the battery was used to make a drawing. A Mitutoyo optical comparator with QC-4000 software was used to trace the contour of the battery and its individual components to generate a drawing of the central cross section of the battery. In doing so, the battery was securely fixed in place and the contour of the battery parts were saved in a format that could later be used in solid modeling software to calculate the battery volumes of interest. However, before any volume measurements were taken, the drawing may be adjusted to compensate for any battery components that are not aligned exactly through the centre of the battery. This may be accomplished by using the measurements that were taken from the battery before cross sectioning the battery and those measurements taken from the disassembled identical battery. For example, the diameter and length of the current collector nail, and overall outside diameter of the battery can be modified to profile the drawing more accurately by adjusting the drawing to include the corresponding known cross-sectional dimensions to make the drawing more accurate for volume measurements. The detail ot the seal, cover, and crimp areas were used as they were drawn on the optical comparator.<br>
To calculate the volume measurements, the drawing was imported into solid modeling softwaie   A solid three-dimensional volume representation was generated by rotating the contour of the cross section on both the left and right sides by one-hundred-eighty degrees (180°) about the longitudinal axis of symmetiy   Accordingly, the volume of each region of interest is calculated by the software and b\ rotating the left and right<br>
sides by onc-hundred-eighty degiees (180°) and summing the left and right volumes together an average volume value is determined, which may be advantageous m those situations where the battery has non-symmetneal features. The volumes which include any non-symmetneal features can be adjusted as necessary to obtain more accurate volume measurements.<br>
Low Profile Seal<br>
Figure 4 shows a battery constructed using a low profile seal in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. Similar to the battery shown in Figure 1, battery 100 includes an electrically conductive can 112 having a closed end 114 and an open end in which a collector assembly 125 and negative cover 145 are secured in place. Also, battery 100 includes a positive electrode 115 in contact with the interior walls of can 112 and in contact with a separator layer 117 that lies between positive electrode •115 and a negative electrode 120. Further, battery 100 includes a positive outer cover 111 attached to a bottom surface of the closed end of can 112.<br>
The difference between batteries 10 and 100 lies in the construction of collector assembly 125 and cover 145. While seal 130 is similar to seal 30 in that it includes an upstanding wall 136 and a central hub 132, which has an aperture formed therein for receiving the head portion 142 of a collector nail 140, seal 130 differs from seal 30 in that the V portion 34 of sea! 30 is inverted to extend upward toward inner cover 144, as indicated by reference numeral 134. By inverting this V portion, collector assembly 125 may rest more squarely upon an upper surface 116 of positive electrode 115. Further, the volume occupied by the V portion 34 of battery 10 may then be used for the electrochemically active materials.<br>
To also reduce the internal volume occupied by collector assembly 125. inner cover 144 is constructed to more closely conform to the inner surface of outer cover 145 so as to eliminate the void space between outer cover 45 and inner cover 44 in battery 10   Additionally, by resting collector assembly 125 firmly on top surface 116 of positive electrode 115, the peripheral edge 147 of outer cover 145 may be flat rather<br>
than extend upward, as in the case for battery 10   By laying peripheral edge 147 flat, collector assembl) 125 may be positioned even closer to the end of battery 100<br>
Collector assembly 125 of battery 100 further differs from collector assembly 25 of battery 10 in that spurs 52 and washer 50 are eliminated. Collector assembly 125, nevertheless, has a idiable pressure relief mechanism by the provision of a thinned-out section 138 formed in seal 130 immediately adjacent hub 132   A thickened nng portion 139 of seal 130 is provided adjacent thinned-out portion 138 such that thmned-out portion 138 lies between thickened ring portion 139 and the relatively thick hub 132. Thus, when the internal pressure of cell 100 becomes excessive, seal 130 nps open in the location of thmned-out portion 138. As with the construction shown for battery 10, the internally-generated gas then escapes through apertures 143 formed in inner cover 144 and outer cover 145.<br>
The internal volume available for containing electrochemically active materials in a D sized battery having the conventional construction shown in Figure 1, is 44.16 cc, which is 87.7 percent of the total volume of 50.38 cc. (See the corresponding entry in the table of Figure 2A ) If the same cell were constructed using the low profile seal construction shown in Figure 4, the internal cell volume may be increased to 44 67 cc, which represents 89.2 percent of the total volume, which is 50.07 cc   The internal and external volumes for the cell constructed with the low profile seal of the present invention are for a cell having a 10 mil can thickness. Further, by decreasing the can wall thickness, even greater internal cell volumes may be achieved<br>
The low profile seal described above is disclosed in commonly-assigned U.S. Patent Application No. 08/882,572 entitled "A V-SHAPED GASKET FOR GALVANIC CELLS," filed on June 27, 1997, by Gary R Tucholski, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein<br>
Figure 5 shows a modified adaptation of the low profile seal as used in an AA sized battery 100" in comparison with a commercial adaptation of the constnu tion shov.n in Figure 1 as used tor an AA sized batten" 10"   Like the collector assembly of<br>
battery 100 (Figure 4), the collector assembly o( battery 100" includes a seal 130 having an invcrted-V portion 134, a hub portion 132, and a thinned-out portion 138 provided between hub 132 and a thickened portion 139.<br>
The primary difference between the collector assemblies of batteries 100 and 100" is the elimination of inner cover 144 of battery 100  To ensure sufficient radial compressive force against upstanding leg 136 of seal 130, battery 100" uses a rollback cover 145" in place of the flanged cover 145 used in battery 100 and also utilises a retainer 150. As will be apparent from a comparison of Figures 4 and 5, a rollback cover differs from a flanged cover in that the peripheral edge 147 of a flanged cover 145 is flat whereas the peripheral edge 147" of a rollback cover 145" extends axially downward and is folded to also extend axially upward. Rollback cover 145" provides a sufficient spring force in the radial direction to maintain compression of upstanding leg 136 of seal 130 against the inner wall of can 112 during normal use<br>
Retainer 150 is provided over and around the upper portion of hub 132 of sea! 130 to compress hub 132 against collector nail 140. Also, by configuring retainer 150 to have a J- or L-shaped cross section, the lower radial extension of retainer 150 can ensure that seal 130 will rupture in the vicinity of thinned-out portion 138 when the internal pressure reaches an excessive level<br>
Ultra Low Profile Seal<br>
Figure 6 shows a battery constructed in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention, which utilises an ultra low profile seal   Like the comentional cell 10 shown in Figure 1, cell 200 also includes a cylindrical can 212 made of an electrically conductive material. Also, a first electrode 215 is formed against the inner walls of can 212 preferably by moulding   A separator 217 is likewise inserted within the cavity defined by first electrode material 215, and a mixture 220 of a second electrode and electrolyte are provided within a cavity defined by the separator 217<br>
As shown in Figure 6, collector assembly 225 includes an integral seal/inner cover assembly 228 and a collector 240 that passes through a central hole 236 provided in the integral seal/inner cover assembly 228   Collector 240 is preferably a brass nail including a head 242 and a retainer flange 241 that is provided Jo cooperate with a speed nut 250 to secure collector nail 240 within central hole 236 of integrated seal/inner cover assembly 228.<br>
Integrated seal/inner cover assembly 228 includes a rigid inner cover 210 and a seal 230 that is formed directly on rigid inner cover 210 by moulding or lamination. Seal 230 is preferably made of neoprene, butyl, or ethylene propylene rubber, and rigid inner cover 210 is preferably formed of low-carbon steel 1008 or 1010   Because rubber is more compressible than the nylon or polypropylene matenals often used in such collector assemblies, the radial compressive strength of the rigid inner cover 210 need not be as great  Thus, the inner cover could be made of thinner and/or softer metals. Further, matenals other than metal may be used   Also, seal 230 may be formed of other matenals provided such matenals are chemically inert, water impervious, compressible, and exhibit the ability to bond to the matenal used-to form ngid inner cover 210<br>
Additionally, by decreasing the radial force required to compress the penpheral upstanding wall of the seal, the thickness of the can walls may be decreased from 0.25 mm (0 010 inch) to approximately 0.15 mm (0.006 inch) or possibly even 0 10 mm (0.004 inch)<br>
By providing a structure that enables rubber matenals such as neoprene and butyl rubber to be used as the seal matenal, the water permeability of the collector assembly is significantly reduced. By reducing the water permeability of the cell, the service maintenance of the battery should be increased<br>
Rigid inner cover 210 is generally disk shaped and has a central aperture 21S formed at its centre as well as a plurality of additional apertures 217   Central aperture 218 and additional apertures 217 extend through ngid inner cover 210 trom its uppei surface to its bottom surface   If formed of metal, ngid inner cover 210 is preferabh<br>
produced by stamping it from a sheet of metal   Inner cover 210 may, however, be formed using other known manufacturing techniques   Subsequently, rigid inner cover 210 may be subjected to a surtace roughening process, such as sandblasting or chemical etching, to enhance the strength of the bond that is subsequently formed between rigid inner cover 210 and seal 230   For a C sized cell, rigid inner cover 210 is preferably 0 38 to 0 76 mm (0 015 to 0 030 inch) thick<br>
After rigid inner cover 210 has been stamped and surface treated, it is preferably inserted into a transfer mould press into which the rubber that forms seal 230 is subsequently supplied  The transfer mould is preferably formed to allow the supplied rubber to form a layer 232 across the bottom surface of rigid inner cover 210  The thickness of layer 232 is between 0 25 and 0 50 mm (0 010 and 0 020 inch) thick, and is pieferably about 0 46 mm (0 016 inch) thick   The rubber also flows into apertures 217 to form plugs 238   Also, the rubber flows within central aperture 218 so as to line the surfaces of central aperture 218 but without completely filling the aperture so as to provide a central hole 236 into which collector nail 240 may subsequently be inserted The diameter of central hole 236 is preferably sufficiently smaller than the diameter of collector nail 240 such that the rubber lining in central aperture 218 is significantly compressed within aperture 218 when collector nail 240 is driven in place through central hole 236   By providing a retainer 241 on collector 240 that is pressed against bottom layer 232 of seal 230, when collector nail 240 has been dnven in place, its speed nut 250 and retainer 241 cooperate to also vertically compress the portion of rubber layer 232 lying therebetween   By compressing the rubber seal in the vicinity of collectoi nail 240 in this manner, the possibility of a leak occurring in the interface between the collector nail 240 and mtegiated seal/inner cover assembly 228 is significantly reduced<br>
By filling apertures 217 with rubber seal plugs 238 in the manner shown, a pressure relief mechanism is provided that not only works reliably, but which mav effectively reseal after internal pressure has been released   When the internal pressure reaches levels considered to be excessive, the excessive pressure ruptures at least one of plugs 238 to allow the expedited release of internally generated gasses   1 he piessure at which such rupturing occurs is controllable based upon the materials selected for the<br>
seal, the thickness of the seal material, and the diameter of apertures 217   Further, because of the elasticity of the rubber seal material, the rubber plug 238 substantially assumes its original slate once the pressure has been released   Thus, unlike other venting mechanisms used in conventional collector assemblies, the pressure relief mechanism of the present invention does not create a permanent hole within the collector assembly through which electrochemical materials may subsequently leak. Also, such resealing minimises deterioration of the cell"s internal components, thereby possibly extending the useful cell life.<br>
Although only one aperture 217 in plug 238 need be provided to serve as a pressure relief mechanism, added reliability is obtained by providing a plurality of such plugged apertures. Unlike prior art relief mechanism structures, the present invention allows for a plurality of independently operable pressure relief mechanisms. Even the pressure relief mechanism illustrated in Figure 1, which includes a plurality of spurs, relies upon the inversion of washer 50 for any one of the spurs to penetrate the seal. Each of the plugged apertures provided in the collector assembly of the present invention, however, is not dependent upon one another, and therefore provide for a more reliable pressure relief mechanism as a whole.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, seal 230 has an upstanding wall 235 formed directly on a peripheral edge of rigid inner cover 210. By providing this upstanding wall 235, a sufficient seal may be created when collector assembly 225 is inserted into can 212. This seal is further enhanced by forming the outer diameter of seal 230 to be greater than the inside diameter of can 212 so that inner cover 210 compresses upstanding wall 235 against the inner surface of can 212.<br>
Seal 230 may additionally be formed to include an extended portion 237 of upstanding wall 235 that extends vertically upward past the upper surface of inner cover 210. By providing extension 237, seal 230 may be used as an electrical insulator between the crimped end 224 of can 212 and a peripheral edge of outer cover 245.<br>
Although sea! 230 is shown as including a continuous layer 232 across the entire bottom surface of inner cover 210, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that seal 230 need not be formed over the entire bottom surface of inner cover 210, particularly if inner cover 210 is formed of an inert plastic material   Depending upon the characteristics of the matenals used to form seal 230 and inner cover 210, a bonding agent may be applied to the surfaces of inner cover 210 that will come into contact and be bonded to seal material 230.<br>
Once seal 230 has been moulded to inner cover 210 and collector nail 240 is inserted through central hole 236 of integrated seal/inner cover assembly 228 and through retainer 240, outer cover 245 is placed on the upper surface of collector assembly 225 and is preferably welded to head 242 of collector nail 240. Subsequently, the collector assembly 225 with the outer cover 245 attached thereto is inserted into the open end of cell can 212. To hold collector assembly 225 in place pnor to cnmpmg, the bottom surface of collector assembly 225 is rested upon an uppei surface 216 of first electrode 2I"5. Thus, collector assembly 225 may be inserted with some degree of force to ensure that the bottom layer 232 of seal 230 rests evenly within the cell can opening on upper surface 216 of electrode 215<br>
If fust electrode 215 is formed by moulding it in place within can 212, first electrode 215 is preferably constructed in the manner disclosed in commonly-assigned U.S Patent Application No. 09/036,115 entitled "ELECTROCHEMICAL CELL STRUCTURE EMPLOYING ELECTRODE SUPPORT FOR THE SEAL," filed on March 6, 1998, by Gary R. Tucholski et al to prevent any flashing resulting from the moulding of first electrode 215 from interfenng with the proper alignment and seal provided by the collector assembly. The disclosure of U S Patent Application No. 09/036,115 is incorporated by reference herein<br>
By resting collector assembly 225 on electrode 215, can 212 could be cnmped at its open end so as to provide a downward force that is countered by electrode 215 Thus, the higher profile cnmp used in the conventional cell construction shown in<br>
Figuie 1 may be replaced with a lower prohle crimp, thereby creating about 1 52 mm (0 060 inch) more space inside the cell<br>
A collector assembly 225 havmg the constiuction shown in Figure 6 has a much lower profile than the conventional collector assembly as illustrated in Figure 1   Thus, a cell 200 utilizing collector assembly 225 may include greatei amounts of electrochemical materials 215 and 220, and the service life of the cell is increased accordingly. Despite its lower profile, collectoi assembly 225 nevertheless exhibits sufficient sealing and electrical insulation   Additionally, the collector assembly of the present invention provides a pressure relief mechanism that is not only reliable, but which provides the advantages of multiple independently-operable pressure relief mechanisms and partial reseahng after venting to prevent the subsequent leakage of electrochemical materials from the cell   Further, the collector assembly of the piesent invention offers improved water permeability characteristics, thereby increasing the service maintenance of the battery.<br>
The calculated total volumes (cc) and internal volumes (cc) available for containing electrochemically active materials for batteries of various sizes conducted using the ulna low profile seal shown in Figuie 6, are provided in the table shown in Figure 14A. As apparent from the table in Figure 14A, the internal cell volumes for such cells are generally greater than any of the prior commercially available cells   For example, a D sized battery employmg the ultra low profile seal has an internal volume available for containing electrochemically active materials of 45 53 cc, which is 90 9 peicent of the total volume of 50.07 cc   This is greater than the internal volume measured on any of the conventional cells listed in Figure 2A   Further, for cells having a can thickness of 0.20 mm (8 mils) or 0 15 mm (6 mils), the internal cell volume may be fuithei significantly incieased   The calculated total volumes (cc) are further shown in the table piescnted in Figuie I4B, in companson with the collector assembly volumes loi batteries ol various sizes constiuctcd using the ultia low profile seal shown in Figuie 6   The collector assembly volume as defined herein includes the collectoi nail, seal inner cover, and any void volume between the bottom suifaec of the negative &gt;.o\ei and the seal    The contaner volume as defined herein includes the volume used bv the can.<br>
label, negative cover, void volume between the label and the negative cover, positive cover, and the void volume between the positive cover and can   It should be appreciated that the total volume ot the battery is equal to the summation ol the internal volume available for elcctrochemically active materials, the collector assembly volume, and the contamei volume   The total volume oi the battery, collectoi assembly volume and container volume are determined by viewing a CAD drawing of the cential longitudinal cioss-sectional view of the battery   As is apparent from the table in Figure 14B, the collector assembly volume is generally less than any of the prior commercially available cells   It should be appreciated that the collector assembly volume is decreased by using the ultra low profile seal construction   For example, the collector assembly volume consumed in the ultra low profile seal is 1 89 cc, which is 3.8 percent of the total volume of 50.07 cc as shown in Figure 14B   In contrast, this is less than any of the collector assembly volumes measured from the conventional batteries as listed in Figuie 2B   Thecontainei volume may also be decreased   Similarly, for cells having a reduced can thickness ol 0 20 mm (8 mils) or 0 15 mm (6 mils), the internal cell volume may be further significantly increased, while the containei volume is decreased<br>
The ultra low profile seal described above, and several alternative embodiments of the ultra low profile seal, are disclosed in commonly-assigned U.S Patent Application No 09/036,208 entitled "COLLECTOR ASSEMBLY FOR AN ELECTROCFfEMICAL CELL INCLUDING AN INTEGRAL SEAL/INNER COVER," filed on March 6, 1998, by Gary R. Tucholski, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein<br>
Low Profile Seal and Ultra Low Profile Seal With Formed Positive Protrusion<br>
As shown in Figure 7, the second embodiment shown in Figure 6 may be modified to have the protrusion 270 for the positive battery terminal toimed dnectly in the closed end 214" of can 212   In this manner, the void space existing between the closed end 214 of can 212 and positive outer cover 211 (Figuie 6) may be used to contain elcctrochemically active matenals or otherwise provide space toi the collection of gasses  which otherwise must be provided within the cell    ll will lunher be<br>
appieuatcd by those skilled in the art that the tirst embodiment shown in Figure 4 may similaifv be modified, such that the positive outer cover protrusion is formed directly in the bottom of can 112   Although the inueasc in cell volume obtained bv. foiming the protiusion directly in the bottom of the can is not provided in the table in Figure 14A it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the internal volume is typically one percent greater than the volumes listed foi the ultia low profile seal or low profile seal listed in the table, which aic formed with a separate cover<br>
Pressure Relief Mechanism Formed in Can Bottom with L-Shaped Seal<br>
An electrochemical battery 300 constructed in accordance with a fourth embodiment of the present invention is shown in Figures 8A through 8C   Battery 300 diffeis from the prior battery constructions in that a pressure relief mechanism 370 is formed in the closed end 314 of can 312   As a iesult, complex col lector/seal assemblies may be replaced with collector assemblies that consume less volume and have fewer parts   Thus, a significant improvement in internal cell volume efficiency ma\ be obtained   As shown in Figures 8A, 8B 9 and 10 the pressure relief mechanism 370 is formed by providing a groo\e 372 m the bottom surface of can 312   This groove may be formed by coining a bottom surface of can 312, cutting a groove in the bottom suiface, or moulding the groove in the bottom surface of the can at the time the positive electrode is moulded   For an AA sized battery, the thickness of the metal at the bottom of the coined groove is approximately 0 05 mm (2 mils)   For a D sized battery, the thickness of the metal at the bottom of the coined groove is approximately 0 076 mm (3 mils)   The groove may be formed us an arc of approximately 300 degrees   By keeping the shape formed by the groove slightly open, the pressure relief mechanism will have an effective hinge<br>
The size of the area ciicumscnbed bv the gioove 372 is preferablv selected such that upon rupture due to excessive internal pressuic the area within the groove 372 mav pivot at the hinge within the positive protiusion of outer cover 311 without interference tiom outer cover 311 In general the size of the area defined by the gioove 372 as well is the selected depth of the gioove depends upon the diamete of the can and "he<br>
pressuie at which the pressure relief mechanism is to rupture and allow internally generated gasses to escape<br>
Unlike pressure relief mechanisms thai have been desenbed in the pnoi ait as being formed in the side or end of the can the pressure felief mechanism 370 ol the present invention is positioned beneath outci cover 311 so as to prevent the electrochemical materials from dangciously spraying directly outward from the battery upon rupture   Also, if the battel y were used in series with another battery such that the end of the positive terminal of the battery is pressed against the negative terminal of another battery, the provision of outer cover 311 over pressure relief mechanism 370 allows mechanism 370 to bow outwardly under the positive protrusion and ultimately rupture   If outer cover 311 was not present in such circumstances the contact between the two batteries may otherwise pievent the pressure relief mechanism horn luptuting Further if outer cover 311 were not provided over pressure rehet mechanism 370 the pressure relief mechanism at the positive end o! (he battel) would be more susceptible to damage   Outer covei 311 also shields piessuie lehef mechanism 370 trom the corrosive effects of the ambient envnonment and theiefore reduces the possibility of premature venting and/or leaking   1 hus, b\ forming the pressure relief mechanism under the outer cover, the present invention overcomes the problems associated with the prior art constructions, and thus represents a commercially feasible pressuie rehef mechanism for a battery<br>
Because the formation of a pressure relief mechanism in the bottom surface of a battery can eliminates the need for a complex collector/seal assembly, the open end of the battery can may be sealed using construction techniques that were not previously feasible due to the need to allow gasses to escape through the pressure relief mechanism to the exterior of the battery   For example as shown in Figures 8 A and SB the open end of can 312 may be sealed by placing uthei a nylon seal ^30 having a J shaped cioss section or a nylon seal 330" having an L shaped cross section in the open end ol can 3 1 2, inserting a negative outer covei 345 having a rolled back penph -ral edge 347 within nylon seal 330 or 330 , and subsequenth crimping the outer edge 31 3 o, can 312 to hold seal 330 oi 330  and cover 343 m place    1 o help hold seal 330 CM 3 M)   mphci<br>
A head 316 may be formed around the circumference of the open end of can 312   Nylon seal 330 or 330" may be coated with asphalt to protect it from the electrochemically active matcnals and to provide a better seal<br>
Refcinng particularly to Figures 8A and 8C, the annular nylon seal 330 is shown configured with a J-shaped cross section which includes an extended vertical wall 332 at the outermost perimeter thereof, a shorter vertical wall 336 at the radially inward side of the seal and has a horizontal base member 334 formed between the vertical walls 332 and 336 With the presence of the short vertical section 336, the annular seal is referred to herein as having cither a J-shaped or L-shaped cross section. It should be appreciated that the J-shaped nylon seal 330 could also be configured absent the short vertical section 336 to form a plain L-shaped cross section as shown in Figure 8B<br>
With particular reference to Figure 8C, the assembly of the electrochemical cell shown in Figure SA is illustrated therein. The cylindrical can 312 is formed with side walls defining the open end and bead 316 for receiving internally disposed battery materials prior to closure ot the can   Disposed within can 312 are the active electrochemical cell materials including the positive and negative electrodes and the electrolyte, as well as the separator, and any additives. Together, the outer cover 345, with the collector nail 340 welded or otherwise fastened to the bottom surface of cover 345, and annular nylon seal 330 are assembled and inserted into the open end of can 312 to seal and close can 312. The collector nail 340 is preferably welded via spot weld 342 to the bottom side of outer cover 345. Together, collector nail 340 and cover 345 are engaged with seal 330 to form the collector assembly, and the collector assembly is inserted in can 312 such that the rolled back peripheral edge 347 of outer cover 345 is disposed against the inside wall of annular seal 330 above bead 316 which supports seal 330   The collector assembly is forcibly disposed within the open end of i_an 312 to snuggly engage and close the can opening   Thereafter, the outer edge 31 3 ol can 12 is crimped inwaid to axially torce and hold seal 330 and outer covei 345 in place<br>
Refemng back to Figuie 8B, the inside surface of outer cover 34^ and at least a top portion of collector nail 340 arc furthei shown coated with an anti-conosion coating<br>
344   Anti-corrosion coaling  344 includes materials that arc elcctrochcmically compatible with the anode   Examples of such elcctrochcmically compatible matenals include cpoxy, Teflon, polyolcfms, nylon, elastomenc matenals, or any other inert materials, cither alone 01 in combination with other matenals. Coating 344 may be sprayed or .painted on and preferably covers that portion of the inside surface of outer cover 345 and collector nail 340 which is exposed to the active matenals in the void region above the positive and negative electrodes of the cell. It should also be appreciated that the inside surface of cover 345 could be plated with tin, copper, or other similarly electrochemically compatible matenals. By providing the anti-corrosion coating 344, any corrosion of the outer cover 345 and collector nail 340 is reduced and/or prevented, which advantageously reduces the amount of gassing which may otherwise occur within the electrochemical cell. Reduction in gassing within the cell results in reduced internal pressure buildup<br>
As shown in Figure 14A in the rows referenced "Pressure Relief in Can Bottom" and "Pressure Relief in Can Bottom With Thin Walls," a D sized battery constructed using the construction shown in Figure 8A, has an internal volume that is 93 5  volume percent when the can walls are 0.25 mm (10 mils) thick, and an internal volume that is 94.9 volume percent when the can walls are 0.20 mm (8 mils) thick. As show n in Figure 14B, a D sized battery constructed using the construction shown in Figure 8A, has a collector assembly volume that is 2 percent of the total volume when the can walls are 0.25 mm (10 mils) thick and 0.20 mm (8 mils) thick. The C, AA, and AAA sized battenes having similar construction also exhibited significant improvements in internal volume efficiency, as is apparent from the table in Figures 14A.<br>
Beverage Can-Type Construction<br>
The use of the pressure relief mechanism illustrated in Figures 8A-10. luither allows the use ot the beverage can-type construction shown in Figuie 11    flic beverage can-type construction shown differs from otheri forms of battery seal constructions in that it does not require any form ol nylon seal to be inserted into the open end ol can 412   Instead, negative outei cover 445 is seemed to the open end of can 412 UMIM: a<br>
scaling technique commonly used to seal the top ol a food or beverage can to the cylindrical portion of the can   Such sealing constructions had not previously been considered foi use in sealing batteries because they would not readily allow for the negative outer cover to be electrically insulated from the can<br>
The method of making a battery having the construction shown in Figure 11 is described below with reference to Figures 12A 12D   Prior to attaching negative outer cover 445 to the open end of can 412, a collector nail 440 is welded to the inner surface of cover 445   Next, as shown in Figure I2A, the inner surface of cover 445, as well as the peripheral portion of the upper surface of cover 445, is coated with a layer 475 of electrical insulation matenal, such as an epoxy, nylon, Teflon®, or vinyl   The portion of collector nail 440 that extends within the void area between the bottom of cover 445 and the top surface of the negative electiode/electiolyte mixture 120 is also coated with the electrical insulation   Additionally, the inner and outer surfaces ot can 412 are also coated in the region of the open end of can 412   Such coatings 475 may be applied directlv, to the can and cover by spiaying, dipping, or electrostatic deposition   By providing such a coating, negative outer cover 445 may, be electrically insulated from can 412<br>
By applying the insulation coating to the areas of the can, cover, and collector -nail within the battery that are proximate the void area within the battery"s internal volume, those areas may be protected from corrosion   While a coating consisting of a single layer of the epoxy, nylon, Teflon®, or vinyl materials noted above will function to prevent such corrosion, it is conceivable that the coating may be applied using layers of two different materials or made of single layers of different materials applied to different regions of the components   For example, the peripheral region of the cover ma\ be coated with a single layer ot matenal that functions both as an electrical insulator and an anti-corrosion layer while the central portion on the inner suitace of the cover may be coated with a single layer of a matenal that tunctions as an anti corrosion layei but does not also function as an electncal insulator   Such matenals may include for example asphalt or polyamidc   Alternatively either one of the can or cover may be coated with a matenal that functions as both in electrical insulator and inti corrosion<br>
layer, while the other of these two components may be coated with a material that lunctions only as an anti-conosion laycr    in this manner. the electncal insulation would be provided wheie needed (e e , between the covei/can interlace), while the surfaces partially defining the void area in the internal volume of the cell will still be protected from the corrosive effects of the electrochemical matenals within the cell   Further, by, utilizing different materials, matenals may be selected that ate lower in cost or exhibit optimal characteristics for the intended function<br>
To assist in the scaling of outer cover 445 to can 412, a conventional sealant 473 may be applied to the bottom surface of penpheial edge 470 of cover 445   Once the sealing procedure is complete, sealant 473 migrates to the positions shown in Figure 12D<br>
Once collector nail 440 has been attached to outer cover 445 and the electncal insulation coating has been applied, outei covei 445 is placed ovei the open end ot can 412 as shown in Figure 12B   Pieferably, can 412 has an outwaid extending flange 4^0 formed at its open end   Further, outei covei 445 pieferably has a slighth cuived penpheral edge 470 that conforms to the shape of flange 450   Once outei covere 445 has been placed over the open end ot can 412. a seaming chuck 500 is placed on outer covet 445. such that an annular downward extending portion 502 of seaming chuck 500 is received by an annular recess 472 formed in outei cover 445   Next, a first seaming roll 510 is moved in a radial direction toward the penpheral edge 470 of outer cover 445 As first seaming roll 510 is moved toward penpheral edge 470 and flange 450. its curved surface causes penpheral edge 470 to be folded around flange 450   Also, as first seaming roll 510 moves radially inward, seaming chuck 500, can 412, and outer cover 445 are rotated about a central axis, such that penpheral edge 470 is folded aiound flange 450 about the entire circumference of can 412   Further, as first seaming toll 510 continues to move radially inwaid, flange 450 and penpheral edge 470 ate folded downward to the position shown in Figuie 1 2C<br>
After peripheral edge 470 and flange 4s0 have been folded into the position shown in Figuie 12C, first seamin» roll 510 is moved away from can 412  and i second<br>
seaming roll 520 is then moved radially inward toward flange 450 and pripheral edge 470   Second seaming roll 520 has a different profile than first seaming roll 510 Second seaming roll 520 applies sufficient lorce against flange 450 and pcnpheral edge 470 to press and flatten the folded flange and peripheral edge against the extenor surface of can 412, which is supported by seaming chuck 500   As a result of this process, the penpheral edge 470 of can 412 is folded around and under flange 450 and is crimped between flange 450 and the extenor surface of the walls of can 412, as shown in Figures 11 and 12D. A hermetic seal is thus formed by this process<br>
To illustrate the hermetic nature of this type of seal, a D sized can constructed in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention was filled with water as was a D sized can constructed with a conventional seal, such as that illustrated in Figure 1. The two cans were maintained at 71°C and weighed over time to determine the amount of water lost from the cans. The conventional construction lost 270 mg per week, and the construction in accordance with the present invention did not lose any weight over the same time penod   These results were confirmed using KOH electrolyte, with the conventional construction losing 50 mg per week and the inventive construction again not losing any weight<br>
As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the beverage can-type construction utilises minimal space in the battery intenor, reduces the number of process steps required to manufacture a battery, and significantly reduces the cost of matenals and the cost of the manufactunng process. Further, the thickness of the can walls may be significantly reduced to 0.15 mm (6 mils) or less   As a result, the internal volume available for containing the electrochemically active matenals may be increased   For example, for a D sized battery, the percentage of the total battery volume that may be used to contain the electrochemically active matenals may be as high as 97 volume percent, while collector assembly volume may be as low as 1 6 volume percent    The volumes of battenes of other sizes are included in the table shown in Figures 14A and 14B<br>
By utilizing the inventive sealing constructions, not only can the can wall thickness be decreased, but also the number of possible materials used to form the can may be increased due lo the lessened strength lequirements that must be exhibited by the can   For example, the inventive constructions noted above may enable aluminum or plastics to be used for the can rather than the nickel-plated steel currently used<br>
A variation of the beverage can construction is shown in Figure 13   In the illustrated embodiment, the battery can is first formed as a tube with two open ends The tube may be extruded, seam welded, soldered, cemented, etc , using conventional techniques  The tube may be formed of steel, aluminum, or plastic   As shown in Figure 13, the tube defines the side walls 614 of can 612   A first open end of the tube is then sealed by securing an inner cover 616 thereto using the beverage can sealing technique outlined above, with the exception that no electrical insulation is required between mnet cover 616 and side walls 614   A positive outei cover 618 may be welded or otherwise secured to the outer surface of inner cover 616    The battery may then be filled and a negative outer cover 645 may be secured to the second open end of can 612 in the same manner as described above<br>
Pnnted Label on Can<br>
As noted above, the inventive battel y constructions may be used in combination with a pnnted label, rather than the label substrates currently used   Current label substrates have thicknesses on the order of 0 076 mm (3 mils)   Because such label substrates overlap to form a seam running along the length of the battery, these conventional labels effectively add about 0 25 mm (10 mils) to the diameter and 0 33 mm (13 mils) to the cnmp height of the battery   As a result, the battery can must have a diameter that is selected to accommodate the thickness of the label seam in oidei to meet the ANSI size standards   However, by printing a lithographed label dnectly on the exterior suilace ot the can in accordance with the piescnt invention, the diameter ot the can may be correspondrnglv increased approximately 0 25 mm (10 mils)   Such an increase in the diameter of the can significantly increases the internal volume ot the batterv   All of the battencs listed in the tables of 1 igures 14A and 14R  with the<br>
exception of the beverage can constructions, include substrate labels   The internal volume of the batteries with substrate labels can be further increased 2 percent (1 02 cc) for a D sized battery. 2 6 percent (0 65 cc) foi a C sued battery, 3 9 percent (0 202 cc) for an AA sued cell, and 5 5 percent (0 195 cc) for an AAA sized battery, if the labels were pnnted directly on the exterior of the can   Labels may also be pnnted on the can using transfer pnnting techniques in which the label image is first pnnted on a transfer medium and then transfened directly onto the can extenor   Distorted lithography may also be used whereby intentionally distorted graphics are pnnted on flat matenal so as to account for subsequent stress distortions of the flat matenal as it is shaped into the tube or cylinder of the cell can.<br>
Pnor to pnnting the lithographed label, the extenor surface of the can is preferably cleaned   To enhance adherence of the pnnt to the can, a base coat of primer may be applied to the extenor surface of the can   The pnnted label is then applied directly on top of the base coat on the can by known lithography pnnting techniques   A varnish overcoat is preferably applied over the pnnted label to cover and piotect the pnnted label, and also to serve as an electneal insulating layer. The pnnted label may be cured with the use of high temperature heating or ultraviolet radiation techniques<br>
With the use of the pnnted label, the thickness of a conventional label substrate is significantly reduced to a maximum thickness of approximately 0 5 mil   In particuiai, the base coat layer has a thickness in the range of about 0.1 to 0 2 mil, the pnnt layer has a thickness of approximately 0 1 mil, and the varnish overcoat layer has a thickness in the range of about 0.1 to 0 2 mil   By reducing the label thickness, the can can be-mcreased in diameter, thereby offenng an increase in available volume for active cell matenals while maintaining a predetermined outside diameter of the battery<br>
