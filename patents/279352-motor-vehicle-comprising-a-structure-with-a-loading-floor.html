Motor vehicle comprising a structure with a load floor.<br>
	The invention relates to a motor vehicle comprising a<br>
5	structure with a load floor.<br>
	The structure of motor vehicles, or bodywork, comprises<br>
	a floor in the lower portion. In the rear portion, this<br>
	floor is designed to be a load area, and it is ,<br>
10	preferably given a flat shape to facilitate the loading<br>
	and the storage of objects.<br>
	For a vehicle for passenger automobile use, the load<br>
	area is adjacent to an area for passengers fitted with<br>
15	one or more rows of seats. Usually, this area for<br>
	passengers has a complex geometry to incorporate the<br>
	seats in the best way and offer as much space as<br>
	possible to the passengers. In particular, an area is<br>
	designed to rest the feet of the passengers, and this<br>
20	area is as low as possible, below the level of the load<br>
	area.<br>
	The structure of the vehicle is made by the assembling<br>
	of metal sheets formed by pressing and assembled<br>
25	together by welding. The floor usually comprises<br>
	structural elements such as longitudinal members and<br>
	crossmembers which support a metal sheet forming the<br>
	upper surface of the floor. The sealing between the<br>
	metal sheets is provided by sealant where required.<br>
30	After the assembling and the sealing, the structure<br>
	passes along a surface treatment line to protect it<br>
	against corrosion and to coat it with paint.<br>
	In the case of a vehicle called a light truck, designed<br>
35	to transport merchandise, the area for passengers is<br>
	reduced to a single row of seats and the load area<br>
	occupies the greater part of the floor surface.<br>
 <br>
- 2 -<br>
	However, the structures of vehicles for passenger<br>
	automobile use are not suitable for light truck use and<br>
	vice-versa. The structures of vehicles must therefore<br>
	be designed specifically according to these uses, which<br>
5	results in additional design and tooling costs.<br>
	An objective of the invention is therefore to provide a<br>
	motor vehicle of which the structure may easily be<br>
	adapted for passenger automobile use or light truck<br>
10	use.<br>
	With this objective in view, the subject of the<br>
	invention is a motor vehicle comprising a structure<br>
	with a first floor, the first floor having a first<br>
15	generally flat raised area and a low area adjacent to<br>
	the first area. The low area comprises a raising frame,<br>
	a second floor being mechanically fastened to the frame<br>
	in a plane aligned with that of the first area.<br>
20	Thus, the same structure designed for a vehicle for<br>
	passenger automobile use can easily be converted for a<br>
	vehicle for light truck use by adding the raising frame<br>
	and the second floor. The tooling does not need to be<br>
	specific to each of the vehicle types. Also, the<br>
25	structure for light truck use is reinforced, which is<br>
	particularly advantageous for transporting heavy loads.<br>
	Moreover, the action of fastening the second floor<br>
	mechanically makes it possible to treat the space under<br>
30	 the second floor on the surface treatment line to<br>
	obtain good protection of this space against corrosion.<br>
	Preferably, the first floor comprises in the low area<br>
	at least one hole for draining the water and channels<br>
35	for channeling the water toward the hole. Since the<br>
	second floor is fastened mechanically and since sealing<br>
	of it is not guaranteed, the draining of the water<br>
	which would enter between the two floors is provided by<br>
	the channels and the hole. The load area and the second<br>
 <br>
- 3 -<br>
	floor can thus be hosed without any risk of water<br>
	stagnation in a portion of the vehicle and without any-<br>
	associated risk of corrosion.<br>
5	Specifically, the hole is provided with a valve. Thus a<br>
	return of splashes into the space under the second<br>
	floor is avoided and the penetration of outside noises<br>
	is limited, without preventing the outflow of the water<br>
	via the hole.<br>
10<br>
	According to a particular embodiment, the second floor<br>
	comprises two panels, the frame comprising a central<br>
	longitudinal member, the panels being fastened to the<br>
	longitudinal member along their junction. The<br>
15	introduction of the second floor inside the structure<br>
	is thus facilitated compared with a one-piece floor,<br>
	each panel being less bulky and less heavy.<br>
	For the draining of the water, the longitudinal member<br>
20	comprises for example a longitudinal member gutter<br>
	underlying the junction between the panels. The water <br>
	which would infiltrate at the junction between the<br>
	panels is collected in the gutter and channeled.<br>
25	Moreover, the frame comprises at least one opening so<br>
	that a channel extends on either side of the frame. The<br>
	water which would flow beyond the boundaries of the<br>
	second floor to the outside of the frame is collected<br>
	in the channel and transferred through the opening<br>
30	toward the drainage hole.<br>
	Specifically, the first floor comprises a gutter which<br>
	is parallel with the junction with the second floor and<br>
	underlying the second floor. The water which would<br>
35	infiltrate into the junction between the first and the<br>
	second floor is collected in the gutter and toward the<br>
	drainage hole.<br>
 <br>
- 4 -<br>
	The invention will be better understood and other<br>
	special features and advantages will emerge from the<br>
	reading of the description which follows, the<br>
	description making reference to the attached drawings<br>
5	in which:<br>
	- Figure 1 is a perspective view of a structural<br>
	element of the vehicle according to the invention;<br>
10	- Figure 2 is a view of the vehicle in Figure 1 before<br>
	fitting of the second floor;<br>
	- Figure 3 is a view similar to Figure 2 with the<br>
	second floor fitted;<br>
15<br>
	- Figure 4 is a perspective view from a different angle<br>
	of the structure in Figure 3;<br>
	- Figure 5 is a longitudinal section view of a portion<br>
20	 of the structure in the preceding figures; and<br>
	- Figure 6 is a of the detail VI in Figure 5.<br>
	The structure of a motor vehicle according to the<br>
25	invention is shown in Figures 1 to 6.<br>
	The structure comprises a first floor 10 in the lower<br>
	portion, shown in Figure 1. In the rear portion, the<br>
	first floor 10 comprises a first load area 11 having a<br>
30	flat shape. The first load area 11 is adjacent to a low<br>
	area 12 for passengers, designed to be fitted with one<br>
	or more rows of seats, which are not illustrated. The<br>
	low area 12 is designed to rest the feet of passengers,<br>
	and is below the level of the first area. The low area<br>
35	comprises an intermediate area 13 adjacent to the first<br>
	area 11. When this vehicle is configured for passenger<br>
	automobile use, the intermediate area 13 receives the<br>
	row of seats.<br>
 <br>
- 5 -<br>
	The structure of the vehicle is conventionally built by<br>
	the assembling of metal sheets formed by pressing and<br>
	assembled together by welding. The floor usually<br>
	comprises structural elements such as longitudinal<br>
5	 members and crossmembers, not illustrated, which<br>
	support a metal sheet forming the upper surface of the<br>
	floor.<br>
	To make a vehicle for light truck use, the low area 12<br>
10	comprises a raising frame 14 which surrounds it, as can<br>
	be seen in Figure 2. The frame 14 comprises two side<br>
	partitions 140, near door openings, and a front<br>
	partition 141 extending vertically and transversely to<br>
	connect the ends of the side partitions 140. The frame<br>
15	14 also comprises a bracket 142 fastened to the<br>
	intermediate area 13 near the first area 11. The frame<br>
	also comprises a central longitudinal member 143<br>
	extending longitudinally generally in the middle of the<br>
	frame 14 between the front partition 141 and the<br>
20	bracket 142.<br>
	A second floor 15 is mechanically fastened to the frame<br>
	14 in a plane aligned with that of the first area 11,<br>
	as can be seen in Figure 3. Thus a wide load surface is<br>
25	available which extends over the first area 11 and over<br>
	the second floor 15. The second floor 15 is formed by<br>
	two panels 150, 151 of which the junction extends above<br>
	the central longitudinal member 143.<br>
30	To make a vehicle according to the invention, the<br>
	assembling of the structure incorporating the first<br>
	floor area 11, the low area 12 and the raising frame<br>
	14, but not the second floor 15, is carried out. The<br>
	structure undergoes the conventional surface treatment,<br>
35	including sealing, cataphoresis and painting. The<br>
	panels 150, 151 of the second floor 15 undergo the same<br>
	surface treatment separately. Next, the structure<br>
	passes along an assembly line, along which the panels<br>
 <br>
- 6 -<br>
	150, 151 of the second floor 15 are mechanically<br>
	fastened to the structure, for example by screwing.<br>
	Because of this assembly method, the sealing between<br>
5	the second floor and the structure is not guaranteed.<br>
	That is why provision is made to catch and drain the<br>
	water which could infiltrate into the space located<br>
	under the second floor.<br>
10	Provision is made in particular so that the first floor<br>
	10 comprises in the low area 12 at least one hole 120<br>
	for draining the water and channels for channeling the<br>
	water toward the hole 120, as illustrated in Figure 5.<br>
	The hole 120 is located at a point as low as possible.<br>
15	Several holes can possibly be provided, according to<br>
	the geometry of the low area 12.<br>
	To avoid or limit the ingress of splashes or feedback<br>
	of noises from the outside, the hole 120 is provided<br>
20	with a valve 16 made of an elastic material, which can<br>
	be seen in Figures 5 and 6. The valve 16 comprises a<br>
	cylindrical body 160 which rests on the edge of the<br>
	hole 120 and a cover disc 161 extending radially in<br>
	relation to the cylindrical body 160. A partial slit<br>
25	162 separates the cover disc 161 from the cylindrical<br>
	body 160, in such a way that the cover disc 161 is<br>
	attached to the cylindrical body 160 and can move away<br>
	from it elastically, widening the slit 162 to allow<br>
	water to pass.<br>
30<br>
	To channel the water toward the hole 120, the central<br>
	longitudinal member 143 comprises a longitudinal member<br>
	gutter 144 underlying the junction between the panels.<br>
	The gutter 144 is pierced near the front partition 141<br>
35	to allow the water inside the frame to run toward the<br>
	hole 120. Moreover, the first floor 10 comprises a<br>
	gutter 110 which is parallel with the junction with the<br>
	second floor 15 and underlying the second floor 15. The<br>
	water thus collected flows via the ends of the gutter<br>
 <br>
- 7 -<br>
	110 then along the side partitions 140 through the<br>
	intermediate area 13 and finally through the low area<br>
	12 toward the hole 120.<br>
5	To collect the water which would run from the second<br>
	floor 15 along the side partitions 140 of the frame 14,<br>
	a channel 145 extends outside the frame 14 to an<br>
	opening 146 in the side partition 140 and is extended<br>
	inside the frame 14 toward the hole 120.<br>
