METHOD FOR REMOTE MAINTENANCE OF REPEATER AND APPARATUS<br>
THEREOF<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for remote maintenance of communication devices and an apparatus thereof in mobile communication systems, particularly to a method for maintenance of repeater and an apparatus thereof in mobile communication systems.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Repeaters are common frequency amplifying devices. They are radio transmitting devices designed to amplify signals during radio transmission process and are mainly used to cover blind areas and suburb areas in the systems. Repeaters are widely employed in conventional mobile communication systems to solve covering problem. In downlink direction, the signals are picked up from existing coverage area by the donating antenna; and out-of-band signals are filtered off from the signals via a band pass filter; then the filtered signals are amplified via a power amplifier and then retransmitted to the area to be covered; in uplink direction, signals from mobile stations in the coverage area are processed similarly and then retransmitted to corresponding base station; so that signal transmission between base station and mobile stations is implemented. Since the performance of repeaters has direct influence on effective signal coverage of the entire base station, to ensure normal operation of the network, it is urgent task for the network to carry out remote operation and<br><br>
2<br>
maintenance for repeaters and process failure alarm messages<br>
from repeaters in time and adjust working parameters of repeaters as required. Since the conventional repeaters don't support remote maintenance, on-site maintenance is required, which will inevitably result in increased maintenance costs and low efficiency.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

uplink RF signals generated from which into the repeater via<br>
the uplink thereof , then transmitting said signals to the base<br>
station;<br>
(2)	Detecting downlink RF signals from the base station,<br>

bi-directional radio communication link between the repeater<br><br>
3<br>
control entity and the repeater;<br>
(5) The network transmitting operation and maintenance messages controlling the repeater to the repeater via the downlink communication link; when receiving said messages, the repeater performing corresponding maintenance operations and reporting the result to the network via the uplink communication link.<br>
The method also comprises:<br>
The network allocating an identification number to the communication module embedded in the repeater connected with the network; said identification number being used to identify said repeater and establish the communication link between the network and the communication module embedded in the repeater, in order to implement remote maintenance of the repeater.<br>
After accomplishing maintenance and control of the repeater, the network releases said bi-directional radio communication link between the network and the repeater.<br>
An apparatus for remote maintenance of repeaters according to the present invention comprises: a downlink receiving channel module, a uplink transmitting channel module, and a RLC (Radio Link Control) and radio resource management module, wherein:<br>
The downlink receiving channel module is designed to receive RF signals from the base station via the downlink of the base station, accomplish the processing for downlink signal receiving on the physical layer, and obtain downloaded messages on the control channel and the traffic channel which carries maintenance messages from the network;<br><br>
-4<br>
The uplink transmitting channel module is designed to carry<br>
out transmission processing for uploaded messages on the control channel and traffic channel {carrying maintenance feedback messages of the repeater) on the physical layer, generate uplink RF signals, and feed the signals to the repeater via the uplink thereof, then transmit the signals to the base station;<br>
The RLC and radio resource management module is designed to implement MAC (Media Access Control) , RLC, radio resource management, and provide an interface to operation and maintenance module of the repeater; wherein, MAC implements mapping of logic channel and transmission channel, multiplexing and de-multiplexing, and transmission format selection according to the traffic volume; RLC implements data segmentation and reassembly, in-sequence delivery, error correction, duplicate detection, and flow control; radio resource management module implements radio link establishment and release, radio bearer establishment and release, radio resource allocation/reallocation/release; the interface to operation and maintenance module of the repeater implements remote maintenance data transmission of the network to the operation and maintenance module and receiving of operation and maintenance response data from the repeater.<br>
Said downlink receiving channel module comprises down-conversion and A/D (Analog to Digital) conversion unit and base-band receiving and processing unit; wherein:<br>
The down-conversion and A/D conversion unit is designed to receive RF signals from the repeater via the downlink and carry out down conversion and A/D conversion for the signals<br><br>
5<br>
to form digital base-band signals;<br>
The base-band receiving and processing unit is designed to carry out matched filtering, demodulation, and channel decoding for digital base-band signals to obtain downloaded control channel and traffic channel messages, and transmit the data to the RLC and radio resource management module.<br>

Compared with common<br><br>
6<br>
mobile stations, said communication module is much simpler<br>
in implementation. Since said radio communication module transceives radio signals via up and down channels of the repeater, RF power amplifier and RF filter can be omitted, thus the costs are reduced; since the RF signals between the repeater and the base station are transmitted through directional radio transmission or optical fiber transmission, which has good signal propagation conditions, signal receiving can be simplified and implementing complexity can be reduced; since said radio communication module only keeps communication linkage to a fixed cell of the base station in one communication process,  sophisticated operations  (e.g.,  soft handover, handover-related measurement) can be omitted; since the link is only used to transmit data messages, higher-level service processing functions (e.g., voice processing) are unnecessary. As a result, cost-efficient and reliable remote maintenance of repeaters can be implemented.<br>
