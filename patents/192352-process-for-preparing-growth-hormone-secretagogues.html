				<td>PROCESS FOR PREPARING GROWTH HORMONE SECRETAGOGUES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an improved process for preparing compounds of Formula II comprising coupling a compound of Formula IV with a compound of Formula V. This invention also relates to an improved process for preparing compounds of Formula III by coupling a compound of Formula IV with a compound of Formula V and subsequent deprotection of the resulting Prt-protected compound of Formula II.<br>
Commonly assigned International Patent Application Publication No. W097/24369, hereinafter referred to as the '369 application, which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses certain growth hormone secretagogue compounds of Formula I,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein the definitions of the variables are disclosed therein. Said compounds are disclosed in the '369 application to have utility in treating, inter alia, osteoporosis. Compounds of Formula II,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
are disclosed in the '369 application as intermediates in a process to prepare the compounds of Formula III,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
which are within the scope of the disclosure of said international application.<br>
The process disclosed in the '369 application requires coupling a compound of Formula IV with a compound of Formula V. The first step in the coupling reaction is the reaction of a compound of Formula IV below with an organic amine to form the free base of the compound of Formula IV and the organic amine salt of tartaric acid. The next step in the disclosed process is a filtration step to remove the organic amine salt of tartaric acid. This was thought to be necessary to eliminate the possibility of reaction of tartaric acid with the compound of Formula IV under the coupling conditions. Due to the racemization of the 3a position of the pyrazolo[4,3-c]pyridine which occurs at room temperature, this filtration had to be performed cryogenically, i.e., at reduced temperatures. When operating the coupling reaction on a bulk scale, cryogenic filtration presents technical problems, e.g., entrainment, slow filtration, a need to use additional equipment and extra handling. This results in reduced yields of product. In the process of this invention, the cryogenic filtration is avoided, resulting in a more streamlined process and an improved chemical and optical yield.<br>

(Scheme Removed)<br>
Compounds of Formula IV wherein Alk is methyl or ethyl, R1, R2 and Prt are as defined above, e.g., the compounds of formula 1e, are prepared as set forth in Scheme 1 or 1 a. According to Scheme 1, step a, a compound of formula 1 a is mixed with a reaction inert polar aprotic solvent such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, DMF (dimethylformamide) or preferably tetrahydrofuran at about 0°C to room temperature, preferably room temperature. To the solution is added R2-X, wherein X is a leaving group such as halo or an alkyl- or aryl-sulfonate; a base such as potassium t-butoxide or a carbonate such as Li2CO3, CS2CO3 or preferably potassium carbonate; and optionally a phase transfer reagent such as potassium iodide or tetrabutylammonium iodide. In the case where postassium carbonate is used as base, it is preferred that a phase transfer reagent is not used. It is preferred that, where R2 is benzyl, R2-X is benzyl bromide and that where R2 is 2-pyridy I methyl, R2-X is picolyl chloride hydrochloride. After stirring at about -20°C to about 70°C for about 2 to 16 hours, preferably at 60°C to about 65°C for about 12 hours, the product is isolated from the reaction mixture according to techniques well known to those skilled in the art. This step is preferably carried out as set forth in Preparation Five, Step D, below.<br>

Addition of triethylamine (28.9 kg, 1.3 eq.) resulted in a thick white emulsion. Slow addition of di-tert-butyldicarbonate (52.6 Kg, 50 L, 1.1 eq.) to the reaction mixture, followed by an IPE rinse, resulted in a clear biphasic solution. The mixture was agitated at 15°C to 25°C for about 12 hours. After reaction completion, the aqueous layer was separated off and extracted with IPE (20 L). The organic extracts were combined and washed sequentially with 1N HCI (110 L), water (90 L), and saturated sodium chloride solution (103 L). The washed organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The mixture was filtered to remove insolubles. The filtrate was concentrated using vacuum distillation to give the oil 4-oxo-1,3-piperidinedicarboxylic acid 1 -(1,1 -dimethylethyl) 3-methyl ester. About 49 L (53 kg) of product oil (assumed 95% yield) was collected. The oil was held in the reactor for immediate use in the next step.<br>
Step D: 4-Oxo-3-(phenvlmethvl)-1.3-piperidinedicarboxylic acid 1 -(1,1 -dimethvlethvl) 3-methyl ester. The nitrogen purged vessel containing about 4-oxo-1,3-piperidinedicarboxylic acid 1-(1,1-dimethylethyl) 3-methyl ester (prepared according to Preparation Five, Step C, 53 kg, 49 L, 1.0 eq.) was charged with tetrahydrofuran (THF, 536 L) and potassium carbonate (72 kg, 2.5 eq.). The slurry was treated with benzyl bromide (36.0 kg, 1.01 eq.) over 10 to 15 minutes. The reaction mixture was heated at reflux temperature until reaction was complete (generally between 12 and 18 hours). The mixture was cooled to between 20°C and 25°C, filtered to remove the salts, and the filter cake washed with THF (134 L). The THF was removed from the mixture by partial vacuum distillation and replaced with heptanes (402 L). The resulting slurry was cooled to between -5°C and 5°C and stirred for about one hour. The solids were collected by filtration, washed with heptanes (57 L) cooled between 0°C to10°C, and dried under vacuum between 45°C to 55°C to give 50.1 kg of 4-oxo-3-(phenylmethyl)-1,3-piperidinedicarboxylic acid 1-(1,1-dimethylethyl) 3-methyl ester (69.2% yield). HPLC assay showed a product peak of 99.2% at about 12 minutes. HPLC conditions: Intersil C-8 column, 4.6x150 mm; mobile phase: 50%acetonitrile/water; aqueous phase: 1 L water, 3 mL triethylamine and 1 mL H3PO4 at pH 6.5; flow rate 1.0 mUmin.; detected by UV at 210 nm.

Methylhydrazine is highly toxic, is a cancer suspect agent, is flammable and is potentially explosive. It should be handled with extreme care. Have spill kits, drying agents, liqua paks and fire extinguishers on hand during handling. Ensure air hoses are long enough to escape any accident scene. Since methylhydrazine can react with metal oxides, the reaction vessel was inspected to ensure that no metal surfaces were exposed prior to initiating the reaction. In a clean, glass-lined, nitrogen purged vessel, 4-oxo-3-(phenylmethyl)-1,3-piperidinedicarboxylic acid 1-(1,1-dimethylethyl) 3-methyl ester (prepared according to Preparation Five, Step D, 50.1 kg, 1.0 eq.) was dissolved in methyl-t-butyl ether (MTBE, 208 L) at 15°C to 20°C to form a solution. The reaction solution was charged with methylhydrazine (7.6 kg, 1.15 eq.). After stirring for about 30 minutes, acetic acid (13.0 kg, 1.5 eq.) was added. The reaction mixture was slowly heated to reflux temperature (53°C to 57°C) and held at reflux for 15 to 20 hours. The reaction was cooled to between 20°C and 25°C. The reaction mixture was<br>
cooled to between 5°C and 10°C and slowly charged with 10% sodium bicarbonate solution in water (175 L). The biphasic mixture was separated and the organic layer was washed sequentially with water (175 L) and saturated sodium chloride solution (175 L). The aqueous wash layers should be combined and treated with bleach solution to destroy any residual methylhydrazine prior to disposal. The organic solution was concentrated to a volume between 130 and 170 L under partial vacuum. Addition of heptanes (174 L) to the mixture precipitated the product. The slurry was stirred for 2 hours at a temperature between 5°C and 10°C. The solids were isolated by filtration, washed with cold MTBE (34 L), and dried under vacuum at a temperature between 35°C and 45°C for 24 hours to give 47.1 kg of 2,3,3a,4,6,7-hexahydro-2-methyl-3-oxo-3a-(phenylmethyl)-5H-pyrazolo[4,3-c]pyridine-5-carboxylic acid 1,1-dimethylethyl ester (95.1% yield).

It has been observed that the intermediate free amine epimerizes in solution and as an isolated solid. Therefore, the dynamic resolution step was completed immediately following the deprotection step. A clean, nitrogen purged reactor was charged with methylene chloride (471 L) and 2,3,3a,4,6,7-hexahydro-2-methyl-3-oxo-3a-(phenylmethyi)-5H-pyrazolo[4,3-c]pyridine-5-carboxylic acid 1,1-dimethylethyl ester (prepared according to Preparation Five, Step E, 47.0 kg, 1.0 eq.). The mixture was agitated and cooled to between -5°C and 5°C. The reaction mixture was slowly charged with triflouroacetic acid (117 kg, 7.5 eq.). The reaction mixture was warmed to a temperature between 20°C and 30°C and stirred for 12 to 15 hours. The reaction mixture was quenched by slow addition of an aqueous solution of 10% sodium carbonate (486 L, 0.5 eq.) at a temperature between 5°C and 15°C. The organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer extracted with methylene chloride (19 L).<br>
A mixture of acetone (456 L), water (56.4 L), and L-tartaric acid (22.6 kg, 1.1 eq.) was prepared in a second reactor. The tartaric acid mixture was combined with the organic layers at a temperature between 20°C and 25°C. The resulting slurry was<br>
heated to a temperature between 35°C and 45°C and stirred for 8 to 18 hours (overnight). When the reaction was judged to be complete, the slurry was cooled and granulated at a temperature between 0°C and 10°C for three to four hours and filtered. The product cake was washed with a mixture of acetone (40 L) and water (4.5 L). The product was dried under vacuum using only mild heat (applied if evaporation of acetone results in cooling).
