				<td>The invention relates to a burner having a<br>
combustion-air feed duct.<br>
Section 3.4 of the book "Berechnung der<br>
Schallausbreitung in durchstromten Kanalen von<br>
Turbomaschinen unter besonderer Beriicksichtingung der<br>
Auslegung von Drehtonschaltern" ["Calculation of the<br>
sound propagation in flow ducts of turbomachines,<br>
taking particular account of the design of rotational<br>
sound switches"] by Christian Faber, Verlag Shaker,<br>
Aachen 1993 illustrates how discontinuities in flow<br>
ducts influence the propagation of sound in a fluid<br>
flowing in these flow ducts. Scatter, reflection and<br>
transmission factors are derived, by means of which it<br>
is possible to calculate which part of incident sound<br>
energy passes the discontinuity and which part is<br>
reflected.<br>
DE 44 30 697 C1 shows an incoming-air sound absorber.<br>
The incoming-air sound absorber comprises a flow line<br>
which is surrounded by an impervious wall and through<br>
which a gaseous medium flows at subsonic speed. A<br>
device for suppressing airborne sound emissions is<br>
arranged in the flow line. As seen in the direction of<br>
flow of the medium, this device is arranged upstream of<br>
a sound-emitting noise source and is used to suppress<br>
the emissions of airborne sound in the opposite<br>
direction to the direction of flow. The device has a<br>
constriction, which is similar to a laval nozzle, in<br>
the flow line. This constriction, in the form of a<br>
laval nozzle, accelerates the velocity of the gaseous<br>
medium to the speed of sound. This builds up a<br>
reflection barrier to the airborne sound.<br>
Combustion oscillations may occur in combustion<br>
systems. Combustion oscillations of this type are<br>
described in the article "Combustion-Driven-<br>
Oscillations in Industry" by Abbott A. Putnam, American<br>
Elsevier,<br>
New York 1971. In accordance with the Rayleigh<br>
criterion, a combustion oscillation is built up when<br>
heat is periodically supplied to a quantity of air in a<br>
combustion chamber if this supply of heat takes place<br>
as a periodic combustion output release in phase with a<br>
characteristic oscillation of the air in the combustion<br>
chamber. Accordingly, the combustion oscillation can be<br>
suppressed by a release of power of the opposite phase.<br>
Combustion oscillations of this type may lead to<br>
considerable noise pollution and even to mechanical<br>
damage to components of the combustion device. It is<br>
stated in the above article, on page 4 under the<br>
paragraph "Pulsations in supply rate" that the<br>
combustion oscillation may be coupled to an air or fuel<br>
supply. To avoid the propagation of pulsations in the<br>
supply systems, it has been proposed to bring about a<br>
considerable pressure loss in the supply systems, in<br>
order in this way to construct a reflection barrier.<br>
However, it has already been pointed out that a<br>
pressure loss of this type is generally unacceptable.<br>
The article "Ma√ünahmen zur Vermeidung von Verbrennungs-<br>
schwingungen-Kennzahl zur stromungsakustischen<br>
Entkopplung am Brenner" [Measures aimed at avoiding<br>
combustion oscillations - characteristic variable for<br>
flow-acoustic decoupling at the burner"] by D. Schroder,<br>
Gaswarme International, Vol. 41, section 1, January 1992<br>
has developed a flow-acoustic limit value criterion for<br>
decoupling a combustion chamber from a coupled system<br>
of pipes. The decoupling is effected by a reflection<br>
area, which is produced in particular at the burner by<br>
means of a narrowing of the cross section of a feed<br>
pipe and, if appropriate, in addition by a perforated<br>
plate arranged at this cross-sectional narrowing.<br>
However, these measures have the drawback of a<br>
considerable pressure loss for the medium which is fed<br>
to the burner.<br>
US-A 4,483,138 shows a burner with a combustion air<br>
duct in which a swirl-blade ring, which is formed from<br>
a number of swirl blades, is arranged, the passage<br>
cross-sectional area between two swirl blades<br>
narrowing, followed by an abrupt increase in the<br>
passage cross-sectional area. A reduction in the flow<br>
velocity is not desired.<br>
US-A 5,451,160 shows a burner having a combustion air<br>
duct in which a number of swirl-generator elements are<br>
arranged. The swirl-generator elements are only<br>
diagrammatically illustrated, and consequently a<br>
profile of the passage cross section between two<br>
swirl-generator elements is not known.<br>
US-A 5,5 558,515 shows a burner having a combustion air<br>
duct in which swirl-generator elements are arranged,<br>
the passage cross-sectional area narrowing between two<br>
swirl-generator element, followed downstream by an<br>
abrupt increase in the passage cross-sectional area.<br>
The swirl-generator elements have a separation edge in<br>
the downstream direction. Following the swirl-generator<br>
element there is a venturi element which accelerates<br>
the flow again.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a burner in<br>
which a combustion zone into which the burner opens out<br>
is decoupled from a feed line for combustion air for<br>
the burner<br>
in terms of flow acoustics, this decoupling at most<br>
resulting in an acceptable additional pressure loss in<br>
the combustion air.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by<br>
a burner having a combustion air duct, in which a swirl<br>
generator, which is formed from a number of<br>
swirl-generator elements, is arranged in such a way<br>
that the swirl generator increases the mean velocity at<br>
which the combustion air passes through the swirl<br>
generator to a Mach number of at least 0.4, in<br>
particular at least 0.6. The swirl-blade ring has first<br>
and second blades, which alternate with one another in<br>
the circumferential direction of the swirl-blade ring,<br>
the second blades being offset with respect to the<br>
first blades in the opposite direction to a direction<br>
of flow of the combustion air.<br>
According to the invention, this object is also<br>
achieved by a burner having a combustion air duct in<br>
which a swirl generator, which is formed from a number<br>
of swirl generator elements, is arranged in such a way<br>
that the swirl generator increases the mean velocity of<br>
combustion air flowing through the swirl generator to a<br>
Mach number of at least 0.4, in particular at least<br>
0.6.<br>
At the same time, the profile of the additional swirl<br>
blades is designed in such a way that pressure is<br>
recovered in the combustion air. This is achieved by<br>
means of a passage cross section which widens<br>
gradually. This gradual widening is to be designed in<br>
such a way that there is no flow separation along the<br>
swirl blades.<br>
The mean velocity of flow in this context is the mean<br>
formed for the velocity over a cross section of the<br>
combustion air duct.<br>
Swirl generators are often used in a burner to impart a<br>
swirl, which stabilizes the combustion flame, to the<br>
combustion air entering the combustion chamber. A<br>
reflection barrier for sound waves is built up using<br>
the swirl generators by means of simultaneous<br>
acceleration of the combustion air by means of the<br>
swirl generators to a Mach number of at least 0.4. This<br>
weakens or even suppresses the propagation of<br>
combustion oscillations into the feed line system for<br>
combustion air. By building up the reflection barrier<br>
by means of the swirl generator, a pressure loss in the<br>
combustion air can be kept at a low level. Therefore,<br>
the acoustic decoupling has at most a slight negative<br>
effect on the efficiency of a combustion device in<br>
which the burner is integrated.<br>
It is preferable for a swirl-blade ring comprising<br>
swirl blades for imparting a swirl to the combustion<br>
air to be arranged in the combustion air duct. It is<br>
also preferable for the swirl generator to be formed by<br>
the swirl-blade ring. Therefore, instead of providing<br>
additional swirl generators for acoustic decoupling,<br>
a swirl-blade ring which is present in any case is<br>
designed as an acoustically decoupling swirl generator.<br>
Designing the swirl-generating elements as swirl blades<br>
results in a measure which is easy to implement in<br>
order to keep the pressure loss in the combustion air<br>
at a low level. This is because acceleration of the<br>
combustion air when it enters the swirl-blade ring as a<br>
result of an effective narrowing of the cross section<br>
is followed again by a widening, by means of which<br>
pressure is recovered in the combustion air, on account<br>
of the blade profiles which narrow in the direction of<br>
flow. Therefore, designing the flow generator as a<br>
swirl-blade ring has the advantage both that a means<br>
which is already present is provided for generating a<br>
combustion-stabilizing swirl, and that pressure<br>
recovery, which has a favorable effect on efficiency,<br>
becomes possible in the combustion air.<br>
The swirl-blade ring preferably has first and second<br>
blades which alternate with one another over the<br>
circumferential direction of the swirl-blade ring, the<br>
second blades being offset with respect to the first<br>
blades in the opposite direction to a direction of flow<br>
of the combustion air. The first blades preferably have<br>
a first maximum profile thickness and the second blades<br>
preferably have a second maximum profile thickness, the<br>
first maximum profile thickness being greater than the<br>
second maximum profile thickness. The first blades have<br>
a first chord length and the second blades have a<br>
second chord length. In this context, the first chord<br>
length is preferably shorter than the second chord<br>
length. The swirl generator is therefore formed to a<br>
certain extent from two partial blade rings which<br>
engage in one another in an offset manner in the<br>
direction of flow. The blades of one of the partial<br>
rings are preferably longer and thinner than the blades<br>
of the other partial ring, and specifically it is<br>
preferable for the blades of that partial ring which is<br>
arranged in front of the other partial ring, as seen in<br>
the direction of flow, to be longer and thinner. This<br>
design enables the two methods of operation<br>
of the swirl-blade ring to be optimized, i.e. both the<br>
function of swirl generation and the function of<br>
acoustic decoupling can be fulfilled to a sufficient<br>
extent by suitable dimensioning and matching of the<br>
partial rings to one another. Moreover, this structure<br>
results in a simple way of retrofitting a swirl-blade<br>
ring in a burner in such a way that it subsequently<br>
allows the desired acoustic decoupling. For this<br>
purpose, it is simply necessary for a further<br>
swirl-blade ring to be inserted into the existing<br>
swirl-blade ring. This is achieved by arranging an<br>
additional swirl blade between in each case two<br>
existing swirl blades. Suitable dimensioning of the<br>
additional swirl blades results in the desired<br>
acceleration of the combustion air to a Mach number of<br>
over 0.4, preferably over 0.6, more preferably over<br>
0.8. At the same time, the profile of the additional<br>
swirl blades is designed in such a way that a recovery<br>
of pressure is achieved in the combustion air. This is<br>
preferably achieved by means of a gradually widening<br>
passage cross section. In particular, this gradual<br>
widening is to be designed in such a way that there is<br>
no flow separation along the swirl blades.<br>
The combustion air duct is preferably of annular<br>
design.<br>
Preferably, fuel can be admitted to the combustion air<br>
duct, and in the process this fuel is intensively mixed<br>
with the combustion air prior to combustion.<br>
Furthermore, it is preferable for it to be possible for<br>
the fuel to be admitted from at least some of the<br>
swirl-generating elements. The intensive mixing of the<br>
fuel with the combustion air prior to combustion<br>
(premix burner) leads to a reduction in the emissions<br>
of nitrogen oxides. This is achieved by making the<br>
flame temperature more uniform on account of intimate<br>
mixing, since the emissions of nitrogen oxides rises<br>
exponentially with the flame temperature. A further<br>
advantage of the acoustic decoupling<br>
by means of the swirl generator is additional mixing of<br>
fuel and combustion air, since, on account of the<br>
pronounced acceleration of the combustion air and of<br>
the adjoining zone of pressure recovery, additional<br>
turbulence in the combustion air leads to a further<br>
improvement in the mixing of combustion air and fuel.<br>
If appropriate, the swirl generator may also be<br>
dimensioned in such a way that some of the pressure<br>
recovery is dispensed with in favor of mixing which is<br>
improved by increased turbulence.<br>
The burner preferably has an additional pilot burner,<br>
which is used to stabilize combustion of the<br>
fuel/combustion air mixture emerging from. the<br>
combustion air duct. If the pilot burner operates as a<br>
diffusion burner, i.e. fuel and combustion air in the<br>
pilot burner are only mixed at the location of<br>
combustion, the burner is also known as a hybrid<br>
burner, in which both premix combustion and diffusion<br>
combustion takes place.<br>
The burner is preferably designed as a gas turbine<br>
burner. Particularly in the case of a high power<br>
conversion of a gas turbine, combustion oscillations<br>
with very high amplitudes and possibly considerable<br>
damaging effects may occur. The flow-acoustic<br>
decoupling from the combustion-air supply system is of<br>
particular importance in this context. This applies in<br>
particular to stationary gas turbines.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail by way of<br>
example with reference to the accompanying drawing,in which, in<br>
some cases diagrammatically and not to scale:<br>
FIG. 1 shows a gas turbine,<br>
FIG. 2 shows a burner, and<br>
FIG. 3 shows swirl blades of a swirl-blade ring.<br>
Identical reference symbols have the same meaning<br>
throughout the various figures.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a longitudinal section through a gas<br>
turbine 301. A compressor 303, a combustion chamber 305<br>
and a turbine part 307 are arranged one behind the<br>
other along a turbine axis 302. The combustion chamber<br>
305 opens out into the burner 100, which comprises an<br>
annular combustion air duct 104 and a central pilot<br>
burner 106, which is surrounded by the combustion air<br>
duct 104. The pilot burner 106 is designed as a<br>
diffusion burner, in which fuel 114 and combustion air<br>
112 are mixed and burnt in a combustion zone 311. Fuel<br>
114 is admixed with the combustion air 112 from the<br>
compressor 303 in the combustion air duct 104, upstream<br>
of the combustion zone 311. Therefore, the combustion<br>
air 112 is initially intimately mixed with the fuel<br>
114, before likewise being burnt in the combustion zone<br>
311 within the combustion chamber 305. This process,<br>
which is known as premix combustion, is stabilized by<br>
the diffusion combustion of the pilot burner 106.<br>
During the combustion in the combustion chamber 305,<br>
hot exhaust gas 315 is generated and is fed to the<br>
turbine part 307. The energy of the hot exhaust gases<br>
315 is converted into rotational energy of a turbine<br>
shaft (not illustrated in more detail) by an<br>
arrangement of blades and vanes in the turbine part<br>
307, which are not shown in more detail.<br>
Fluctuations in the combustion flame 313 result in<br>
propagation of sound waves within the combustion<br>
chamber 305, these sound waves being reflected by the<br>
combustion-chamber walls and in turn causing<br>
fluctuations in the flame 313 at the location of<br>
combustion 311. At certain frequencies of the<br>
fluctuations, this interaction makes it possible to<br>
build up a stable combustion-chamber oscillation in the<br>
combustion chamber 305, which may lead to considerable<br>
noise being produced or even to damage to components of<br>
the gas turbine 301. These combustion oscillations also<br>
propagate through the combustion air duct 104.<br>
Therefore,<br>
an additional volume, which can additionally promote<br>
the formation of combustion-chamber oscillations, is<br>
coupled to the combustion chamber 305 through the<br>
combustion air duct 104. Moreover, under certain<br>
circumstances components upstream of the combustion<br>
chamber 305 are also exposed to damaging vibrations.<br>
Therefore, it is desirable for the combustion air duct<br>
104 to be decoupled from the combustion chamber 305 in<br>
terms of flow acoustics. For this purpose, it is<br>
necessary to build up a reflection barrier for the<br>
sound waves from the combustion chamber 305. However, a<br>
simple narrowing of the cross section or the use of a<br>
perforated plate or the like would impair the<br>
efficiency of the gas turbine 301 to such an extent<br>
that economic operation would no longer be possible.<br>
One possible way of acoustically decoupling combustion<br>
chamber 305 and combustion air duct 104 by means of a<br>
burner 100 which is simple and acceptable in terms of<br>
the pressure loss is shown in FIG. 2.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a partially sectional, perspective view of<br>
a burner 100 which is directed along a combustion axis<br>
98. An annular combustion air duct 104 is formed by an<br>
inner wall 101 and an outer wall 102. This duct<br>
surrounds a centrally arranged pilot burner 106, which<br>
is not shown in detail. A swirl generator 109, which is<br>
designed as a swirl-blade ring, is arranged in the<br>
combustion-air duct 104. This swirl generator is formed<br>
from swirl-generator elements 108 which are designed as<br>
swirl blades. The position of the swirl blades 108 can<br>
be adjusted by means of adjustment bolts 110 in the<br>
outer wall 102. The swirl-blade ring 109 is formed from<br>
different swirl blades 108 which alternate with one<br>
another along its circumferential direction U. A first<br>
swirl blade 108B is in each case followed by a second<br>
swirl blade 108A. The first swirl blades 108B are<br>
offset with respect to the second swirl blades 108a,<br>
and are designed to be both shorter and thicker. This<br>
is explained in more detail below with reference to<br>
FIG. 3.<br>
Fuel 114 is admitted to the combustion air duct 104,<br>
via openings, in particular around the blade-inlet<br>
edge, from some, preferably all of the swirl blades<br>
108, by means of a fuel duct, which runs inside the<br>
swirl blade 108 and cannot be seen in this figure.<br>
Combustion air 112 flows through the combustion air<br>
duct 104. This air is mixed intensively with the fuel<br>
114. The dimensioning of the swirl blades 108<br>
accelerates the combustion air 112 to a Mach number of<br>
over 0.4. As a result, a reflection barrier for sound<br>
waves is built up. This leads to acoustic decoupling of<br>
the combustion chamber 305, into which the burner 100<br>
opens, and that part of the combustion air duct 104<br>
which lies upstream of the swirl generator 109. The<br>
combustion air 112 is accelerated by a narrowing in the<br>
passage cross section for the combustion air 112. On<br>
account of the design of the profile of the swirl blade<br>
108, this narrowing is adjoined by a widening of this<br>
passage cross section, in such a way that as far as<br>
possible there is no flow separation for the combustion<br>
air 112. This ensures a high recovery of pressure in<br>
the combustion air 112, so that there are at most<br>
slight losses in efficiency.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a cross section through three of the swirl<br>
blades 108, specifically second swirl blades 108A and<br>
an intervening first swirl blade 108B. The first swirl<br>
blade 108B has a blade front-edge point 200B, a blade<br>
rear-edge point 202B, a skeleton line 204B, a maximum<br>
profile thickness 206B and an adjustment engagement<br>
feature 208B. In a corresponding way, every second<br>
swirl blade 108A has in each case a blade front-edge<br>
point 208A, a blade rear-edge point 202A, a skeleton<br>
line 204A, a maximum profile thickness 206A and an<br>
adjustment engagement means 208A. Combustion air 112<br>
flows in the direction of flow 210 between the first<br>
swirl blade 108B and one of the second swirl blades<br>
108A. Along this direction of flow 210, the first swirl<br>
blade 108B is set back with respect to the second swirl<br>
blades 108A, so that a distance L1 results between the<br>
tangents on the respective blade front-edge points<br>
200B,<br>
200A. A passage cross section Fl for the combustion air<br>
112 flowing between the swirl blades 108 is reduced to<br>
a maximum constriction, which is characterized by a<br>
minimum distance L4 between the first swirl blade 108B<br>
and the second swirl blade 108A. After this maximum<br>
constriction, the passage cross section F2 increases<br>
again, specifically in such a moderate way that there<br>
is no flow separation and therefore no pressure losses<br>
on account of the formation of turbulence. This ensures<br>
a high recovery of pressure in the combustion air 112.<br>
Between the blade rear-edge points 202B, 202A, the<br>
combustion air 112 emerges again between the two blades<br>
108. The blade rear-edge points 202B, 202A are<br>
separated from one another by the distance L3. The<br>
first swirl blades 108B have both a greater maximum<br>
profile thickness 206B and a shorter profile chord 204B<br>
compared to the maximum profile thicknesses 206A and<br>
the profile chords 204A of the second swirl blades<br>
108A. This alternating design of the blades in the<br>
swirl-blade ring 109 makes it possible both to set a<br>
sufficiently high swirl to stabilize combustion and<br>
also the desired acoustic decoupling effect by<br>
acceleration of the combustion air 112 and subsequent<br>
pressure recovery.<br>
In their front region, i.e. along the skeleton line<br>
204A from the blade front-edge point 200A, the second<br>
swirl blades 108A have, in the first quarter, feed<br>
passages 212, through which fuel 114 which is guided in<br>
the interior of the swirl blades 108A can be released<br>
into the combustion air 112. This leads to particularly<br>
intimate mixing of combustion air 112 and fuel 114 even<br>
in the region of the swirl generator 109. Moreover, the<br>
location of combustion is separated from the location<br>
where the mixture is formed, since the decoupling<br>
constriction lies downstream of the fuel supply. As a<br>
result, the fuel supply, which in general can often be<br>
regarded as the cause of fluctuations, is acoustically<br>
decoupled from the combustion. This acoustic decoupling<br>
of the<br>
cause of combustion oscillations leads to combustion<br>
oscillations being suppressed particularly effectively.<br>
The following values are preferably set for the<br>
dimensions of the swirl blades 108 and the distances<br>
between them:<br>
L1 = distance between the tangents on the blade<br>
front-edge points 200B, 200A = 1 to 5 cm,<br>
L2 = distance between the blade front-edge points 200B,<br>
200A = 2 to 8 cm,<br>
L3 = distance between the blade rear-edge points 202B,<br>
202A = 1 to 5 cm,<br>
L4 = minimum distance between the first swirl blades<br>
108B and the second swirl blades 108A = 0.3 to 3 cm,<br>
maximum profile thickness 206B of the first swirl<br>
blades 108B = 2 to 6 cm,<br>
length of the skeleton line 204B of the first swirl<br>
blade 108B = 5 to 17 cm,<br>
maximum profile thickness 206A of the second swirl<br>
blade 108A = 0.5 to 4 cm,<br>
skeleton line length of the profile chord 204A of the<br>
second swirl blade 208A = 8 to 20 cm.<br>

combustion air duct (104), in which a swirl generator (109), which is<br>
formed from a number of swirl generator elements (108), is arranged<br>
in such a way that the swirl generator (109) can increase the mean<br>
velocity at which combustion air (112) flows through the swirl<br>
generator (109) to a Mach number of at least 0.4. This results in<br>
flow-acoustic decoupling of the combustion area from the<br>
combustion-air feed area. This leads to effective suppression of the<br>
combustion oscillations. The invention is widely used in the<br>
industries such as: industry for making glass and steel products.</td>
