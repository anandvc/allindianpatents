				<td>(CYCLOALKYL)METHYL SILANES AS EXTERNAL DONORS FOR <br>
 POLYOLEFIN CATALYSTS <br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention generally relates to olefin polymerization catalyst<br>
systems. In particular, the present invention relates to catalyst systems for<br>
making olefin polymers and copolymers and methods of making the catalyst<br>
systems and alpha-olefin polymers and copolymers.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Polyolefins are a class of polymers derived from simple olefins and<br>
include polypropylene and polybutene. Known methods of making poiyolefins<br>
involve the use of Ziegter-Natta polymerization catalysts. These catalysts<br>
polymerize vinyl monomers using a transition metal halide to provide a<br>
stereoregulated polymer.<br>
Numerous Ziegler-Natta polymerization catalysts exist. The catalysts<br>
have different characteristics and/or lead to the production of poiyolefins<br>
having diverse properties. For example, certain catalysts have high activity<br>
while other catalysts have low activity, and similarly certain catalysts have a<br>
long life while other catalysts have a short life. Moreover, poiyolefins made<br>
with the use of Ziegler-Natta polymerization catalysts vary in stereoregularity,<br>
molecular weight distribution, impact strength, melt-flowability, rigidity, heat<br>
sealability, isotacticity, and the like.<br>
In the polymerization of alpha-olefins having 3 or more carbon atoms in<br>
particular, an electron donor is incorporated into the Ziegler-Natta<br>
polymerization catalyst to promote increased stereospecificity. However,<br>
using an electron donor to promote increased stereospecificity of poly-alpha-<br>
olefins in a Ziegler-Natta polymerization scheme tends to cause large losses<br>
in catalyst activity. While lower levels of many characteristics associated with<br>
Ziegler-Natta polymerization catalysts can be tolerated, it is difficult to<br>
accommodate compromises in catalyst activity. As a result, there is an unmet<br>
need for Ziegler-Natta polymerization catalysts (and methods associated<br>
therewith) that possess high catalyst activity in addition to other desirable<br>
features.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,784,983 and U.S.Patent 4,861,847 relate to a catalyst<br>
system for use in olefinic polymerization and copolymerization is comprised of<br>
the following components: (A) a solid product consisting essentially of<br>
titanium, magnesium, halogen, polycarboxylic acid esters and organic<br>
phosphorus compounds, (B) an organic aluminum compound, and (C) an<br>
organic silicon compound.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,829,038 relates to an olefin polymerization catalyst<br>
system comprising a solid, hydrocarbon-insoluble, magnesium-containing,<br>
titanium-containing, electron donor-containing component; an alkyl aluminum<br>
compound; and organosilane compound selected from the group consisting<br>
of diisobutyldimethoxysilane, diisopropyldimethoxysilane, t-<br>
butyltrimethoxysilane and di-t-butyldimethoxysilane, and mixtures thereof.<br>

organoaluminum compound, and (C) an organosilicon compound containing<br>
a cyclopentyl group, a cyclopentenyl group, a cyclopentadienyl group or a<br>
derivative derived from any of these groups.<br>

stereospecific polyolefin in the presence of a catalyst comprising a transition<br>
metal compound and an organometailic compound, wherein a catalyst system<br>
is used which comprises: (A) a solid catalyst component prepared by reacting<br>
(i) a homogeneous solution prepared by reacting (i-1) magnesium and a<br>
hydroxylated organic compound, (i-2) an oxygen-containing organic<br>
compound of titanium and/or (i-3) an oxygen-containing organic compound of<br>
silicon, with an oxygen-containing organic compound of aluminum and/or a<br>

selected from the group consisting of organometallic compounds of Groups<br>

compound.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,773,537 relates to catalyst systems of the Ziegler-Natta<br>
type containing, as active components a) a titanium-containing solid<br>
component in whose preparation a titanium compound, a compound of<br>

Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides alpha-olefin polymerization catalyst<br>
systems, methods of making the alpha-olefin polymerization catalyst systems,<br>
and methods of polymerizing (and copolymerizing) alpha-olefins involving the<br>
use of (cycloalkyl)methyl moiety containing external electron donors. The<br>
(cycloalkyl)methyl moiety containing external electron donors of the alpha-<br>
olefin polymerization catalyst systems contribute to the production of high<br>
xylene soluble poly-alpha-olefins while simultaneously maintaining high<br>
catalytic efficiency of the catalysts. The use of (cycloalkyl)methyl moiety<br>
containing external electron donors permits the tolerance of a large margin of<br>
error in the amount of external electron donor employed without effecting the<br>
properties of the catalyst system or resulting polymer.<br>
One aspect of the invention relates to a catalyst system for use in<br>
olefinic polymerization, containing a solid titanium catalyst component; an<br>

an organoaluminum compound having at least one aluminum-carbon bond,<br>
wherein the catalyst system has a mole ratio of aluminum to titanium from<br>
about 5 to about 1,000; and an organosilicon compound comprising a<br>
(cycloalkyl)methyl group, wherein the catalyst system has a mole ratio of the<br>
organoaluminum compound to the organosilicon compound from about 2 to<br>
about 90.<br>
Yet another aspect of the invention relates to a method of making a<br>
catalyst for use in olefmic polymerization, involving the steps of reacting a<br>
Grignard reagent having a (cycloalkyl)methyl group with an orthosilicate to<br>
provide an organosilicon compound having a (cycloalkyl)methyl moiety; and<br>
combining the organosilicon compound with an organoaluminum compound<br>
having at feast one aluminum-carbon bond and a solid titanium catalyst<br>
component to form the catalyst.<br>

process, involving polymerizing or copolymerizing an alpha-olefin in the<br>
presence of a catalyst system containing a solid titanium catalyst component;<br>
an organoaluminum compound having at least one aluminum-carbon bond;<br>
and an organosilicon compound comprising a (cycloalkyl)methyl group.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to catalyst systems and methods of<br>
making poly-alpha-oiefins, such as polypropylene, using catalyst systems<br>
containing an organosilicon compound containing a (cydoalkyl)methyl group,<br>
and in particular, an organosilicon compound containing a (cycloheptyl)methyl<br>
group, a (cyclohexyl)methyl group, a (cyclopentyl)methyl<br>
group(cyclobutyl)methyl group and/or a (cyclopropyl)methyl group. The<br>

(cycloalkyl)methyl) or unsubstituted. Lower alkyl groups have about 4<br>
carbons or less. Poly-alpha-olefins include homopolymers and copolymers<br>
made from alpha-olefins.<br>
Generally speaking, the present invention relates to an olefin<br>
polymerization catalyst system formed from (A) a solid titanium catalyst<br>
component containing magnesium, titanium, halogen, and optionally an<br>
organic phosphorus compound and/or a polycarboxylic acid ester; (B) an<br>

The magnesium compound having no reducibiiity may be a compound<br>
derived from the magnesium compound having reducibiiity separately or at<br>
the time of preparing the catalyst component. This is effected, for example,<br>
by contacting the magnesium compound having reducibiiity with such a<br>
compound as a polysiloxane compound, a halogen-containing silane<br>

Another group of internal electron donors that can be included in the<br>
titanium catalyst component are monocarboxylic acid esters represented by<br>
RCOOR1 where R and R" are hydrocarboyl groups that may have a<br>
substituent, and at least one of them is a branched (including alicyclic) or ring-<br>

Carbonic acid esters may also be used as the internal electron dznor<br>
Specific examples are diethyl carbonate, ethylene carbonate, diisopropyl<br>
carbonate, phenylethyl carbonate and diphenyl carbonate.<br>
The optional internal electron donors may be used individually or in<br>
combination In employing the internal electron donor, they do not have to be<br>
used directly as starling materials, but compounds convertible 1o the electron<br>
donors in the course of preparing the titanum catalyst components may also<br>
be used as the starting materials.<br>
In the present invent/on, the solid trtamum catalyst component (A) may<br>
be produced by contacting the magnesium compound (or metallic<br>
magnesium) and the titanium compound and optionally, the internal electron<br>
donor by known methods used to prepare a highly active titanium catalyst<br>
component from a magnesium compound, a titanium compound and<br>
optionally an electron donor. The above compounds may be contacted in the<br>
presence of another reaction agent such as silicon, phosphorus or aluminum.<br>
Several examples of the method of producing the solid titanium<br>
catalyst component (A) are briefly described below<br>
(1) The magnesium compound or the complex of the magnesium<br>
compound optionally with the internal electron donor is reacted with the<br>
titanium compound in the liquid phase. This reaction may be earned out in<br>
the presence of a pulverizing agent. Compounds which are solid may be<br>
pulverized before the reaction."<br>
(2) The magnesium compound having no reducibility and the titanium<br>
compounds, both in liquid form, are reacted in the presence of the optional<br>
internal electron donor to precipitate a solid titanium complex.<br>
(3) The reaction product obtained in (2) is further reacted with the<br>
titanium compound.<br>
(4) The reaction product obtained in (1) or (2) is further reacted with<br>
the internal electron donor and the titanium compound<br>
(5) The magnesium compound or a complex of the magnesium<br>
compound and the optional internal electron donor is pulverized in the<br>
presence of the titanium compound, and the resulting solid product is treated<br>
with a halogen, a halogen compound or an aromatic hydrocarbon. In this<br>
method, the magnesium compound or the complex of it with the electron<br>
donor may be pulverized in the presence of a pulverizing agent, etc.<br>
Alternatively, the magnesium compound or the complex of the magnesium<br>
compound and the optional internal electron donor is pulverized in the<br>
presence of the titanium compound, preliminarily treated with a reaction aid<br>
and thereafter, treated with halogen, etc. The reaction aid may be an<br>
organoaluminum compound or a halogen-containing silicon compound.<br>
(6) The product obtained in (1) to (4) is treated with a halogen, a<br>
halogen compound or an aromatic hydrocarbon.<br>
(7) A product obtained by contacting a metal oxide, dihydrocarbyl<br>
magnesium and a halogen-contajning alcohol is contacted with the optional<br>
internal electron donor and the titanium compound.<br>
(8) A magnesium compound such as a magnesium salt of an organic<br>
acid, an alkoxy magnesium or an aryloxy magnesium is reacted with the<br>
optional internal electron donor, the titanium compound and/or a halogen-<br>
containing hydrocarbon.<br>
In embodiments of making the catalyst component (A) according to<br>
examples (2), (3), (4) and (6), the magnesium halide solution is mixed with<br>
liquid titanium tetrahalide to form a solid precipitate in the presence of an<br>
auxiliary precipitant. A polycarboxylic acid ester may be added before, during<br>
or after the precipitation of the solids and loaded on the solid.<br>
The process of solids precipitation can be carried out by one of two<br>
methods. One method involves mixing liquid titanium tetrahalide with<br>
magnesium halide at a temperature in the range of about -40°C to about 00C,<br>
and precipitating the solids while the temperature is raised slowly to a range<br>
of about 30°C to about 120°C, preferably about 60°C to about 100°C. The<br>
other method involves adding liquid titanium tetrahalide dropwise into the<br>
homogeneous magnesium halide solution at room temperature to precipitate<br>
out solids immediately In both methods, an internal electron donor is<br>
desirably present in the reaction system. The optional internal electron donor<br>
can be added either after the magnesium halide solution is obtained or<br>
together with magnesium halide in step 1. Alternatively, two or more auxiliary<br>
precipitants can be added simultaneously.<br>
The solids are treated by adding a polycarboxylic acid ester into the<br>
system after the precipitation process. Alternatively, a polycarboxylic acid<br>
ester can be added during the precipitation process. A mixture of two or more<br>
polycarboxylic acid esters can be used.<br>
In order to obtain uniform solid particles, the process of precipitation<br>
can be carried out slowly. When the second method of adding titanium halide<br>
dropwise at room temperature is applied, the process preferably takes place<br>
over a period from about 1 hour to about 6 hours. When the first method of<br>
raising the temperature in a slow manner is applied, the rate of temperature<br>
increase preferably ranges from about 4°C to about 1000C per hour.<br>
The solid precipitate is first separated from the mixture. In the solid<br>
precipitate thus obtained may be entrained a variety of complexes and<br>
impurities, so that further treatment may in some instances be necessary.<br>
The solid precipitate is washed with an inert diluent and then treated<br>
with titanium tetrahalide or a mixture of titanium tetrahalide and an inert<br>
diluent. The titanium tetrahalide used in this step is identical to or different<br>
with the titanium tetrahalide used in step 2, with titanium tetrachloride being<br>
most preferred. The amount of titanium tetrahalide used is from about 1 to<br>
about 20 moles, preferably from about 2 to about 15 moles, per mole of<br>
magnesium halide. The treatment temperature ranges from 50°C to about<br>
15000, preferably from about 60°C to about 100°C. If a mixture of titanium<br>
tetrahalide and inert diluent is used to treat the solid precipitate, the volume %<br>
of titanium tetrahalide in the treating solution is from about 10% to about<br>
100%, the rest being an inert diluent.<br>
The treated solids are further washed with an inert diluent to remove<br>
ineffective titanium compounds and other impurities. The inert diluent herein<br>
used can be hexane, heptane, octane, 1,2-dichloroethane, benzene, toluene<br>
and other hydrocarbons. 1,2-dichloroethane is one of the preferred diluents in<br>
the final washing step.<br>
In one embodiment, particularly embodiments following example (2)<br>
described above, the solid catalyst component (A) has the following chemical<br>
composition: titanium, from about 1.5 to about 6.0 wt %; magnesium, from<br>
about 10 to about 20 wt %; halogen, from about 40 to about 70 wt %;<br>
polycarboxylic acid ester, from about 5 to about 25 wt %; optionally organic<br>
phosphorus compounds, from about 0.1 to about 2.5 wt %; and optionally<br>
inert diluent from about 0 to about 15 wt %.<br>
The amounts of the ingredients used in preparing the solid titanium<br>
catalyst component (A) may vary depending upon the method of preparation.<br>
In one embodiment, from about 0.01 to about 5 moles of the internal electron<br>
donor and from about 0.01 to about 500 moles of the titanium compound are<br>
used per mole of the magnesium compound. In another embodiment, from<br>
about 0.05 to about 2 moles of the internal electron donor and from about<br>
0.05 to about 300 moles of the titanium compound are used per mole of the<br>
magnesium compound.<br>
In one embodiment, in the solid titanium catalyst component (A), the<br>
atomic ratio of halogentitanium is from about 4 to about 200; the internal<br>
electron donor/titanium mole ratio is from about 0.01 to about 10; and the<br>
magnesium/titanium atomic ratio is from about 1 to about 100. In another<br>
embodiment, in the solid titanium catalyst component (A), the atomic ratio of<br>
halogen/titanium is from about 5 to about 100; the internal electron<br>
donor/titanium mole ratio is from about 0.2 to about 6, and the<br>
magnesium/titanium atomic ratio is from about 2 to about 50.<br>
The resulting solid titanium catalyst component (A) generally contains<br>
a magnesium halide of a smaller crystal size than commercial magnesium<br>
halides and usually has a specific surface area of at least about 50 m2/g,<br>
preferably from about 60 to 1,000 m2 /g, more preferably from about 100 to<br>
800 m2 /g Since, the above ingredients are unified to form an integral<br>
structure of the solid titanium catalyst component (A), the composition of the<br>
solid titanium catalyst component (A) does not substantially change by<br>
washing with hexane.<br>
The solid titanium catalyst component (A) may be used alone. If<br>
desired, it can be used after being diluted with an inorganic or organic<br>
compound such as a silicon compound, an aluminum compound or a<br>
polyolefin. In some instances when such a diluent is used, the catalyst<br>
component (A) may show high catalytic activity even when it has a lower<br>
specific surface than that described above.<br>

The organosiiicon compounds of the present invention can be<br>
prepared by various methods. In one method, one or two equivalents of a<br>
cyclopropyl/cyclobutyl Gringnard reagent (i.e., a Grignard reagent having a<br>
(cyclopropyl)methyl or (cyclobutyl)methyl group, respectively) is reacted with<br>
an orthosilicate, such as tetramethylorthosilicate or tetraethylorthosilicate.<br>
The reactant is then purified by vacuum distillation, if appropriate.<br>
Tetramethylorthosiiicate and tetraethylorthosilicate are made by reacting<br>
silicon tetrachloride with either four equivalents of methanol or ethanol.<br>
Examples of Grignard reagents having a (cycloalkyl)methyl group<br>
include those represented by Formula (XXIII)<br>
MgXR13 (XXIII)<br>
wherein X is a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, and R13 is an<br>
organic group containing a (cycloalkyl)methyl group. Examples of organic<br>
groups include a substituted or unsubstituted (cyclopropyl)methyl group, a<br>
substituted or unsubstituted (cyclobutyl)methyl group a substituted or<br>
unsubstituted (cyclopentyl)methyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted<br>
(cyclohexyl)methyl group, and a substituted or unsubstituted<br>
(cycloheptyl)methyl group.<br>
In another method, the organosiiicon compound catalyst system<br>
component (C) is obtained by the reaction of a monocycloalkyltrialkoxysilane<br>
(i.e., mono(cyc!opropyl)methyl-, mono(cyclobutyl)methyl-,<br>
mono(cyelopentyl)methyl-, mono(cyciohexyl)methyl-,<br>
mono(cycloheptyl)methyl-trialkoxysilane) with a (cycloalkyl)methyl Grignard<br>
reagent. For example, (cyclopropyl)chloromethane is first reacted with<br>
magnesium in the presence of a solvent, e.g., an ether such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, or di-n-butyl ether, to yield a<br>
(cyclopropyl)methyl Grignard reagent ((cyclopropyl)methyl magnesium<br>
chloride). This reaction may be carried out at a temperature from about room<br>
temperature to about 60°C. The (cyclopropyl)methyl Grignard reagent is then<br>
reacted with (cyclopropyl)methyl trimethoxysilane to obtain<br>
bis{(cyclopropyl)methyl} dimethoxysilane; this reaction may be conducted in<br>
the presence of an ether such as tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, or di-n-butyl<br>
ether, or in the presence of an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent such as hexane<br>
or heptane or an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene, benzene, or<br>
xylene. This reaction may be carried out at a temperature from about 50°C to<br>
about 200°C, preferably at a temperature from about 100°C to about 200°C<br>
or at a temperature from about 100°C to about 200°C under boiling or<br>
refluxing of the solvent.<br>
Although the mono(cycloalky!)methy!trialkoxysilane for use in the<br>
above reaction may be a commercial product, it may be prepared by various<br>
known methods. In one method, the desired compound is prepared by<br>
reacting (cycloalkyl)methyltrichlorosilane with methanol to alkoxylate the<br>
silane compound with the evolution of hydrogen chloride. Although the<br>
(cycloalkyl)methyltrichlorosilane for use in this reaction may be a commercial<br>
product, it may be prepared by the hydrosilylation reaction of<br>
(cycloalkyl)methane with trichlorosilane (HSiCI3).<br>
The (cycloalkyl)methyl organosilicon compounds thus produced can be<br>
identified by one or more of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-<br>
NMR, 13C-NMR), infrared absorption spectrometry, gas chromatography-mass<br>
spectrometry, etc.<br>
The organosiiicon compound of the present invention, when used as<br>
an electron donor serving as one component of a Ziegler-Natta catalyst<br>
system for olefin polymerization, makes it possible to obtain a polymer (at<br>
least a portion of which is polyolefin) having a broad molecular weight<br>
distribution and controllable crystallinity while retaining high performance with<br>
respect to catalytic activity and the yield of highly stereoregular polymer.<br>
The organosilicon compound (C) is used in the catalyst system of the<br>
present invention in an amount that the mole ratio of the organoaluminum<br>
compound (B) to the (cycloalkyl)methy! organosilicon compound is from about<br>
2 to about 90. In another embodiment, the mole ratio of the organoaluminum<br>
compound to the (cycloalkyl)methyl organosilicon compound is from about 5<br>
to about 70. In yet another embodiment, the mole ratio of the<br>
organoaluminum compound to the (cycloalkyl)methyl organosilicon compound<br>
is from about 7 to about 35.<br>

Polymerization of olefins in accordance with the present invention is<br>
carried out in the presence of the catalyst system described above In one<br>
embodiment, preliminary polymerization described below is carried out before<br>
the main polymerization. In another embodiment, polymerization is carried<br>
out without preliminary polymerization.<br>
In preliminary polymerization, the solid titanium catalyst component (A)<br>
is usually employed in combination with at least a portion of the<br>
organoaluminum compound (B). This may be carried out in the presence of<br>
part or the whole of the organosilicon compound (C) (and optionally a<br>
supplementary organosilicon compound). The concentration of the catalyst<br>
system used in the preliminary porymerization may be much higher than that<br>
in the reaction system of the main polymerization.<br>
In preliminary polymerization, the concentration of the solid titanium<br>
catalyst component (A) in the preliminary polymerization is usually from about<br>
0.01 to about 200 millimoles, preferably from about 0.05 to about 100<br>
millimoles, calculated as titanium atoms per liter of an inert hydrocarbon<br>
medium described below. Preferably, the preliminary polymerization is<br>
carried out by adding an olefin and the above catalyst system ingredients to<br>
an inert hydrocarbon medium and reacting the olefin under mild conditions.<br>
Specific examples of the inert hydrocarbon medium include aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as propane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane,<br>
decane, dodecane and kerosene; alicyclic hydrocarbons such as<br>
cyclopentane, cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane; aromatic hydrocarbons<br>
such as benzene, toluene and xylene; halogenated hydrocarbons such as<br>
ethylene chloride and chlorobenzene; and mixtures thereof. In the present<br>
invention, a liquid olefin may be used in place of part or the whole of the inert<br>
hydrocarbon medium.<br>
The olefin used in the preliminary polymerization may be the same as,<br>
or different from, an olefin to be used in the main polymerization.<br>
The reaction temperature for the preliminary polymerization is sufficient<br>
for the resulting preliminary polymer to not substantially dissolve in the ine<t></t>
hydrocarbon medium. In one embodiment, the temperature is from about -<br>
20°C to about 100°C. In another embodiment, the temperature is from about<br>
-10°C to about 80°C. In yet another embodiment, the temperature is from<br>
about 0°C to about 40°C.<br>
Optionally, a molecular-weight controlling agent, such as hydrogen,<br>
may be used in the preliminary polymerization. The molecular weight<br>
controlling agent is used in such an amount that the polymer obtained by the<br>
preliminary polymerization has an intrinsic viscosity, measured in decalin at<br>
135°C, of at least about 0.2 dl/g, and preferably from about 0.5 to 10 dl/g.<br>
In one embodiment, the preliminary polymerization is desirably carried<br>
out so that from about 0.1 g to about 1,000 g of a polymer forms per gram of<br>
the titanium catalyst component (A) of the catalyst system. In another<br>
embodiment, the preliminary polymerization is desirably carried out so that<br>
from about 0.3 g to about 500 g of a polymer forms per gram of the titanium<br>
catalyst component (A). If the amount of the polymer formed by the<br>
preliminary polymerization is too large, the efficiency of producing the olefin<br>
polymer in the main polymerization may sometimes decrease, and when the<br>
resulting olefin polymer is molded into a film or another article, fish eyes tend<br>
to occur in the molded article. The preliminary polymerization may be carried<br>
out batchwise or continuously.<br>
After the preliminary polymerization conducted as above, or without<br>
performing any preliminary polymerization, the main polymerization of an<br>
olefin is carried out in the presence of the above-described olefin<br>
polymerization catalyst system formed from the solid titanium catalyst<br>
component (A), the organoaluminum compound (B) and the organosilicon<br>
compound (C).<br>
Examples of olefins that can be used in the main polymerization are<br>
alpha-olefins having 2 to 20 carbon atoms such as ethylene, propylene, 1-<br>
butene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-pentene, t-octene, 1-hexene, 3-methyl-1-<br>
pentene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 1-decene, 1-tetradecene, 1-eicosene, and<br>
vinylcyclohexane. In the process of the present invention, these alpha-olefins<br>
may be used individually or in any combination.<br>
In one embodiment, propylene or 1-butene is homopolymerized, or a<br>
mixed olefin containing propylene or 1-butene as a main component is<br>
copolymerized. When the mixed olefin is used, the proportion of propylene or<br>
1-butene as the main component is usually at least about 50 mole %,<br>
preferably at least about 70 mole %.<br>
By performing the preliminary polymerization, the catalyst system in<br>
the main polymerization can be adjusted in the degree of activity. This<br>
adjustment tends to result in a powdery polymer having a high bulk density.<br>
Furthermore, when the preliminary polymerization is carried out, the particle<br>
shape of the resulting polymer becomes spherical, and in the case of slurry<br>
polymerization, the slurry attains excellent characteristics. Furthermore, in<br>
this embodiment, a polymer having a high stereoregularity index can be<br>
produced with a high catalytic efficiency by polymerizing an alpha-olefin<br>
having at least about 3 carbon atoms.<br>
In the homopolymerization or copolymerization of these olefins, a<br>
polyunsaturated compound such as a conjugated diene or a non-conjugated<br>
diene may be used as a comonomer. Examples of comonomers include<br>
styrene, butadiene, acrylonitrile, acrylamide, alpha-methyl styrene,<br>
chlorostyrene, vinyl toluene, divinyl benzene, diallylphthalate, alkyl<br>
methacrylates and alkyl acrylates. In one embodiment, the comonomers<br>
include thermoplastic and elastomeric monomers.<br>
In the process of the present invention, the main polymerization of an<br>
olefin is carried out usually in the gaseous or liquid phase.<br>
)n one embodiment, when the main polymerization is carried out in a<br>
slurry reaction mode, the aforesaid inert hydrocarbon may be used as a<br>
reaction solvent. In another embodiment, an olefin which is liquid at the<br>
reaction temperature may alternatively be used as the reaction solvent. In yet<br>
another embodiment, an inert hydrocarbon and an olefin which is fiquid at the<br>
reaction temperature may be employed as the reaction solvent.<br>
In one embodiment, polymerization (main polymerization) of the<br>
present invention employs a catalyst system containing the titanium catalyst<br>
component (A) in an amount from about 0.001 to about 0.75 millimole<br>
calculated as Ti atom per liter of the volume of the polymerization zone, the<br>
organoaluminum compound (B) in an amount from about 1 to about 2,000<br>
moles per mole of titanium atoms in the titanium catalyst component (A), and<br>
the organosiiicon compound (C) in an amount from about 0.001 to about 10<br>
moles calculated as Si atoms in the organosiiicon compound (C) per mol of<br>
the metal atoms in the organoaluminum compound (B). In another<br>
embodiment, polymerization employs a catalyst system containing the<br>
titanium catalyst component (A) in an amount from about 0.005 to about 0.5<br>
millimole calculated as Ti atom per liter of the volume of the polymerization<br>
zone, the organoaluminum compound (B) in an amount from about 5 to about<br>
500 moles per mole of titanium atoms in the titanium catalyst component (A),<br>
and the organosiiicon compound (C) in an amount from about 0.01 to about 2<br>
moles calculated as Si atoms in the organosiiicon compound (C) per mol of<br>
the metal atoms in the organoaluminum compound (B). In yet another<br>
embodiment, polymerization employs a catalyst system containing the<br>
organosilicon compound (C) in an amount from about 0.05 to about 1 mole<br>
calculated as Si atoms in the organosilicon compound (C) per mol of the<br>
metal atoms in the organoaluminum compound (B).<br>
The catalyst components (A), (B) and (C) may be contacted at the time<br>
of the main polymerization or during the preliminary polymerization before the<br>
main polymerization. In this contacting before the main polymerization, any<br>
desired two components may be selected and contacted with each other,<br>
followed by the third component. Alternatively, only portions of two or three<br>
components may be contacted with each other. The catalyst system<br>
ingredients may be contacted before polymerization in an inert gas<br>
atmosphere, or in an oiefin atmosphere.<br>
When the organoaluminum compound (B) and the organosilicon<br>
compound (C) are used partially in the preliminary polymerization, the catalyst<br>
system subjected to the preliminary polymerization is used together with the<br>
remainder of the catalyst system components. The catalyst system subjected<br>
to the preliminary polymerization may contain the preliminary polymerization<br>
product.<br>
The use of hydrogen at the time of polymerization promotes and<br>
contributes to control of the molecular weight of the resulting polymer, and the<br>
polymer obtained may have a high melt flow rate. In this case, the<br>
stereoregularity index of the resulting polymer and the activity of the catalyst<br>
system are not decreased according to the methods of the present invention.<br>
In one embodiment, the polymerization temperature of the present<br>
invention is from about 20°C to about 200°C. In another embodiment, the<br>
polymerization temperature of the present invention is from about 50°C to<br>
about 180°C. In one embodiment, the polymerization pressure is typically<br>
from about atmospheric pressure to about 100 kg/cm2. In another<br>
embodiment, the polymerization pressure is typically from about 2 kg/cm2 to<br>
about 50 kg/cm2. The main polymerization may be carried out batchwise,<br>
semi-continuously or continuously. The polymerization may also be carried<br>
out in two or more stages under different reaction conditions.<br>
The olefin polymer so obtained may be a homopolymer, a random<br>
copoiymer or a block copolymer.<br>
Since the yield of the stereoregular polymer obtained per unit amount<br>
of the solid titanium catalyst component in the present invention is high, the<br>
amount of the catalyst residue in the polymer, particularly its halogen content<br>
can be relatively decreased. Accordingly, an operation of removing the<br>
catalyst from the resulting polymer can be omitted, and corrosion of a mold<br>
can be effectively prevented in molding the olefin polymer into articles.<br>
Furthermore, the olefin polymer obtained by using the catalyst system<br>
of the present invention has. a very small amount of an amorphous polymer<br>
component and therefore a small amount of a hydrocarbon-soluble<br>
component. Accordingly, a film molded from this resultant polymer has low<br>
surface tackiness.<br>
The polyolefin obtained by the process of the present invention is<br>
excellent in particle size distribution, particle diameter and bulk density, and<br>
the copolyolefin obtained has a narrow composition distribution.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, propylene<br>
and an alpha-olefin having 2 or from about 4 to about 20 carbon atoms are<br>
copolymerized in the presence of the catalyst system described above. The<br>
catalyst system may be one subjected to the preliminary polymerization<br>
described above.<br>
By performing the preliminary polymerization, the catalyst system in<br>
the main polymerization can be adjusted in the degree of activity This<br>
adjustment tends to result in a powdery polymer having a high bulk density.<br>
Furthermore, when the preliminary polymerization is carried out, the particle<br>
shape of the resulting polymer becomes spherical, and in the case of slurry<br>
polymerization, the slurry attains excellent characteristics- Accordingly,<br>
according to this embodiment of producing the propylene copoiymer, the<br>
resulting copolymer powder or the copolymer slurry becomes easy to handle<br>
The alpha-olefin having 2 carbon atoms is ethylene. and examples of<br>
the alpha-olefins having about 4 to about 20 carbon atoms are 1-butene, 1-<br>
pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-octene, 1-hexene, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 3-<br>
methyl-1-butene, 1-decene, vinylcyclohexane, 1-tetradecene, and the like.<br>
In the main polymerization. propylene may be copolymerized with two<br>
or more such alpha-olefins. For example, it is possible to copolymerize<br>
propylene with ethylene and 1-butene. In one embodiment, propylene is<br>
copolymerized with ethylene, 1-butene. or ethylene and 1-butene<br>
Block copolymerization of propylene and another alpha-olefin may be<br>
carried out in two stages. The polymerization in a first stage may be the<br>
homopolymenzation of propylene or the copolymenzation of propylene with<br>
the other alpha-olefin. Preferably, it is the copolymerization of propylene and<br>
ethylene, or propylene. ethylene and 1-butene. In one embodiment, the<br>
amount of the monomers polymenzed in the first stage is from about 50 to<br>
about 95% by weight. In another embodiment, the amount of the monomers<br>
polymerized in the first stage is from about 60 to about 90% by weight. In the<br>
present invention, this first stage polymerization may, as required be carried<br>
out in two or more stages under the same or different polymerization<br>
conditions.<br>
In one embodiment, the polymerization in a second stage is desirably<br>
carried out such that the mole ratio of propylene to the other alpha-olefim(s) is<br>
from about 10/90 to about 90/10. In another embodiment, the polymerization<br>
in a second stage is desirably carried out such that the mole ratio of<br>
propykene to the other alpha-olefin(s) is from about 20/80 to about 80/20 In<br>
yet another embodiment, the polymerization in a second stage is desirably<br>
carried out such that the mole ratio of propylene to the other alpha-olefin(s) is<br>
from about 30/70 to about 70/30. The step of producing a crystalline polymer<br>
or copolymer of another alpha-olefin may be provided in the second<br>
polymerization stage<br>
The propylene copolymer so obtained may be a random copolymer or<br>
the above-described block copolymer. This propylene copolymer typically<br>
contains from about 7 to about 50 mole % of units derived from the alpha-<br>
olefin having 2 or from about 4 to about 20 carbon atoms. In one<br>
embodiment, a propylene random copolymer contains from about 7 to about<br>
20 mole % of units derived from the alpha-olefin having 2 or from about 4 to<br>
about 20 carbon atoms. In another embodiment, a propylene random<br>
copoiymer contains from about 8 to about 18 mole % of units derived from the<br>
alpha-olefin having 2 or from about 4 to about 20 carbon atoms. In one<br>
embodiment, the propylene block copolymer contains from about 10 to about<br>
50 mole % of units derived from the alpha-olefin having 2 or 4-20 carbon<br>
atoms. In another embodiment, the propylene block copolymer contains from<br>
about 20 to about 40 mole % of units derived from the alpha-olefin having 2<br>
or 4-20 carbon atoms.<br>
In another one embodiment, copolymers made with the catalyst<br>
system of the present invention contain from about 50% to about 99% by<br>
weight poly-alpha-olefins and from about 1 % to about 50% by weight<br>
comonomers (such as thermoplastic or elastomeric monomers). In another<br>
embodiment, copolymers made with the catalyst system of the present<br>
invention contain from about 75% to about 98% by weight poly-alpha-olefins<br>
and from about 2% to about 25% by weight comonomers.<br>
It should be understood that where there is no reference to the<br>
polyunsaturated compound that can be used, the method of polymerization,<br>
the amount of the catalyst system and the polymerization conditions, the<br>
same description as the above embodiments are applicable.<br>
The catalysts/methods of the present invention lead to the production<br>
of poly-alpha-olefins having xylene solubles (XS) from about 2% to about<br>
10%, depending upon the specific (cycloalkyl)methyl organosilicon compound<br>
employed. In another embodiment, poly-alpha-olefins having xylene solubles<br>
(XS) from about 3% to about 6%, depending upon the specific<br>
(cycloalkyl)methyl organosilicon compound employed, are produced in<br>
accordance with the present invention. XS refers to the percent of solid<br>
polymer that dissolves into xylene. A low XS% value generally corresponds<br>
to a highly isotactic polymer (i.e., higher crystallinity), whereas a high XS%<br>
value generally corresponds to a low isotactic polymer.<br>
For example, in one embodiment, when employing<br>
bis{(cyclobutyl)methyl} dimethoxysilane as the (cycloalkyl)methyl<br>
organosilicon compound in the catalyst system, a polypropylene polymer<br>
made therewith has an XS from about 2% to about 4%. In another<br>
embodiment, when employing bis{(cyclopropyl)methyl} dimethoxysilane as<br>
the (cycloalkyl)methyl organosilicon compound in the catalyst system, a<br>
polypropylene polymer made therewith has an XS from about 4% to about<br>
6%.<br>
in one embodiment, the catalyst efficiency (measured as kilogram of<br>
polymer produced per gram of catalyst) of the catalyst system of the present<br>
invention is at least about 25. In another embodiment, the catalyst efficiency<br>
of the catalyst system of the present invention is at least about 30. In yet<br>
another embodiment, the catalyst efficiency of the catalyst system of the<br>
present invention is at least about 32.<br>
The catalysts/methods of the present invention lead to the production<br>
of poly-alpha-olefins having melt flow indexes (MFI) from about 5 to about 9,<br>
depending upon the specific (cycloalkyl)methyl organosilicon compound<br>
employed. For example, in one embodiment, when employing<br>
bis{(cyclobutyl)methyl} dimethoxysilane as the (cycloalkyl)methyl<br>
organosilicon compound in the catalyst system, a polypropylene polymer<br>
made therewith has an MFI from about 7 to about 8. In another embodiment,<br>
when employing bis{(cyclopropyl)methyl} dimethoxysilane as the<br>
(cycloalkyl)methyl organosilicon compound in the catalyst, a polypropylene<br>
polymer made therewith has an MFI from about 6 to about 7. In some<br>
instances a relatively high MFI indicates that a relatively high catalyst<br>
efficiency is obtainable. The MFI (flow rate) is measured according to ASTM<br>
standard D 1238.<br>
The catalysts/methods of the present invention lead to the production<br>
of poly-alpha-olefins having a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution.<br>
In one embodiment, the Mw/Mn of a polypropylene polymer made with a<br>
catalyst system containing the (cycloalkyl)methyl organosilicon compound is<br>
from about 3 to about 5.5. In another embodiment, the Mw/Mn of a<br>
polypropylene polymer made with a catalyst system containing the<br>
(cycloalkyl)methyl organosilicon compound is from about 3.5 to about 5.<br>
According to his invention, a polypropylene copolymer such as a<br>
polypropylene random copolymer having a low melting point can be obtained<br>
in a large amount and a high yield. In addition, the amount of the by-product<br>
hydrocarbon-soluble copolymer can be reduced. The polymerization can be<br>
carried out without any trouble even in suspension. Since the amount of the<br>
copolymer yielded per unit amount of titanium is large, an operation of<br>
removing the catalyst after the polymerization can be omitted.<br>
The propylene random copolymer obtained by the present invention<br>
has excellent heat sealability, heat seal imparting property, transparency and<br>
antiblocking property and contains a small amount of a portion soluble in a<br>
hydrocarbon.<br>
The present invention can produce a propylene block copolymer<br>
having one or more of excellent melt-flowability, moldability, rigidity, impact<br>
strength and impact strength with a high catalytic efficiency and good<br>
operability. Moreover, by selecting one of the (cycloalkyl)methyl organosilicon<br>
compounds, the isotactic index of the resulting poly-alpha-olefin can be set at<br>
a desirable level. Employing the (cycloalkyl)methyl organosilicon compounds<br>
of the present invention yields catalysts simultaneously having high catalytic<br>
efficiency and one or more of excellent melt-flowability, moldability, rigidity,<br>
impact strength and impact strength.<br>
Another benefit attributable to the present invention is that a relatively<br>
large margin of error in the amount of organosilicon compound addition (to<br>
the catalyst system) can be tolerated with minimal changes in isotacticity and<br>
catalytic activity. In many instances, when using organosilicon compounds<br>
that do not contain a (cycloalkyl)methyl moiety, changes in the amount of<br>
organosilicon compound addition to a polyolefin catalyst noticeably effect<br>
changes in either or both catalytic activity and isotacticity of the result<br>
polymer.<br>
The following examples illustrate the present invention. Unless<br>
otherwise indicated in the following examples and elsewhere in the<br>
specification and claims, all parts and percentages are by weight, all<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
1. Preparation of a solid titanium catalyst component (A):<br>
Anhydrous magnesium chloride (0.05 mol), toluene (75 ml), epoxy<br>
chloropropane (0.1 mol) and tributyl phosphate (0.03 moi) are introduced into<br>
a reactor which has thoroughly been purged with highly purified nitrogen. The<br>
temperature is raised to 50°C with stirring, and the mixture is then maintained<br>
at this temperature for 2 hours, while the solids dissolve completely. Phthalic<br>
anhydride (0.008 mol) is added to the solution, and then the solution is<br>
maintained for an additional 1 hour at 50°C. The solution is cooled to -25°C.<br>
Titanium tetrachloride (55 ml) is added dropwise over the course of 1 hour.<br>
The solution is heated to 80°C over the course of 3 hours, while a solid<br>
product precipitates. Diisobutyl Phthalate (0.0125 mol) is added and the<br>
mixture is maintained at the temperature of 80°C for 1 hour.<br>
The solid portion is collected by filtration and washed with toluene (2 x<br>
100 ml). A brown-yellow solid precipitate is obtained. The solid is then<br>
treated with a mixture of toluene (60 ml) and titanium tetrachloride (40 ml) for<br>
2 hours at 90°C: After the filtrate is removed, the treatment step as repeated.<br>
The solid is washed with dichloroethane (100 ml), and then with hexane (4 x<br>
100 ml).<br>
The solid catalyst component (A) obtained by the above procedure<br>
contains 1.92% by weight of titanium, 17.5% by weight of magnesium, 56.5%<br>
by weight of chlorine, 13.2% by weight of diisobutyl phthalate, 0.32% by<br>
weight of tributyl phosphate. The specific surface area of it is about 290 m2/g.<br>
