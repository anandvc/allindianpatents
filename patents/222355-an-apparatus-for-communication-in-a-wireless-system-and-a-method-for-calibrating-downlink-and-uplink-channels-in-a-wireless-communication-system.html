CHANNEL CALIBRATION FOR A TIME DIVISION DUPLEXED<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. §119<br>
[0001]	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No.<br>
60/421,462, entitled, "Channel Calibration for a Time Division Duplexed Communication System," and U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/421,309, entitled, "MMO WLAN System," both of which are filed on October 25, 2002, assigned to the assignee of the present application, and incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND Field<br>
[0002]	The present invention relates generally to communication, and more specifically<br>
to techniques for calibrating downlink and uplink channel responses in a time division duplexed (TDD) communication system.<br>
Background<br>
[0003]	In a wireless communication system, data transmission between an access point<br>
and a user terminal occurs over a wireless channel. Depending on the system design, the same or different frequency bands may be used for the downlink and uplink. The downlink (or forward link) refers to transmission from the access point to the user terminal, and the uplink (or reverse link) refers to transmission from the user terminal to the access point. If two frequency bands are available, then the downlink and uplink may be transmitted on separate frequency bands using frequency division duplexing (FDD). If only one frequency band is available, then the downlink and uplink may share the same frequency band using time division duplexing (TDD).<br>
[0004]	To achieve high performance, it is often necessary to know the frequency<br>
response of the wireless channel. For example, the response of die downlink channel may be needed by the access point to perform spatial processing (described below) for downlink data transmission to the user terminal. The downlink channel response may be estimatedby the user terminal based on a pilot transmitted by the access point. The user terminal may then send the channel estimate back to the access point for its use. For this channel estimation scheme, a pilot needs to be transmitted on the downlink and<br><br>
additional delays and resources are incurred to send the channel estimate back to the<br>
access point.<br>
[0005]	For a TDD system with a shared frequency band, the downlink and uplink<br>
channel responses may be assumed to be reciprocal of one another. That is, if H represents a channel response matrix from antenna array A to antenna array B, then a reciprocal channel implies that the coupling from array B to array A is given by Hr,<br>
where M denotes the transpose of matrix M. Thus, for a TDD system, the channel response for one link may be estimated based on a pilot sent on the other link. For example, the uplink channel response may be estimated based on an uplink pilot, and the transpose of the uplink channel response estimate may be used as an estimate of the downlink channel response.<br>
[0006]	However, the frequency responses of the transmit and receive chains at the<br>
access point are typically different from the frequency responses of the transmit and receive chains at the user terminal. In particular, the frequency responses of the transmit/receive chains used for uplink transmission may be different from the frequency responses of the transmit/receive chains used for downlink transmission. The "effective" downlink channel response (i.e., including the transmit/receive chains) would then be different from the reciprocal of the effective uplink channel response due to differences in the transmit/receive chains (i.e., the effective channel responses are not reciprocal). If the reciprocal of the channel response estimate obtained for one link is used for spatial processing on the other link, then any difference in the frequency responses of the transmit/receive chains would represent error that, if not determined and accounted for, may degrade performance.<br>
[0007]	There is, therefore, a need in the art for techniques to calibrate the downlink and<br>
uplink channels in a TDD communication system.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0008]	Techniques are provided herein to calibrate the downlink and uplink channels to<br>
account for differences in the frequency responses of the transmit and receive chains at the access point and user terminal. After calibration, an estimate of the channel response obtained for one link may be used to obtain an estimate of the channel<br><br>
response for the other link. This can then simplify the channel estimation and spatial processing.<br>
[0009]	In one embodiment, a method is provided for calibrating the downlink and<br>
uplink channels in a wireless TDD multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system. In accordance with the method, a pilot is transmitted on the uplink channel and used to derive an estimate of the uplink channel response. A pilot is also transmitted on the downlink channel and used to derive an estimate of the downlink channel response. Two sets of correction factors are then determined based on the estimates of the downlink and uplink channel responses. A calibrated downlink channel is formed by using a first set of correction factors for the downlink channel, and a calibrated uplink channel is formed by using a second set of correction factors for the uplink channel. The appropriate correction factors will be used at the respective transmitter for the downlink and uplink channels. The responses of the calibrated downlink and uplink channels are approximately reciprocal due to the two sets of correction factors. The first and second sets of correction factors may be determined using a matrix-ratio computation or a minimum mean square error (MMSE) computation, as described below.<br>
[0010]	The   calibration   may   be   performed   in   real-time   based  on   over-the-air<br>
transmission. Each user terminal in the system may derive the second set of correction factors for its own use. The first set of correction factors for the access point may be derived by multiple user terminals. For an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, the calibration may be performed for a first set of subbands to obtain two sets of correction factors for each subband in the set. Correction factors for other ' "uncalibrated" subbands may be interpolated based on the correction factors obtained for the "calibrated" subbands.<br>
[0011]	Various aspects and embodiments of the invention are described in further detail<br>
below.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0019]	The calibration techniques described herein may be used for various wireless<br>
communication systems. Moreover, these techniques may be used for single-input single-output (SISO) systems, multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems, single-input multiple-output (S1MO) systems, and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.<br>
[0020]	A MIMO system employs multiple (JVr) transmit antennas and multiple (NR)<br>
receive antennas for data transmission. A MIMO channel formed by the NT transmit and NR receive antennas may be decomposed into Ns independent channels, with Ns 
subchannel or an eigenmode of the MIMO channel and conresponds to a dimension. The MIMO system can provide improved performance (e.g., increased transmission capacity) if the additional dimensionalities created by the multiple transmit and receive antennas are utilized. This typically requires an accurate estimate of the channel response between the transmitter and receiver.<br>
[0021]	FIG. 1 shows a block diagram of the transmit and receive chains at an access<br>
point 102 and a user terminal 104 in a MIMO system. For this system, the downlink and uplink share the same frequency band in a time division duplexed manner.<br>
[0022]	For the downlink, at access point 102, symbols (denoted by a "transmit" vector<br>
* x^) are processed by a transmit chain (TMTR) 114 and transmitted from Nap antennas<br>
116 over a wireless channel. At user terminal 104, the downlink signals are received by<br><br><br><br>
6<br>
where xup is the transmit vector for the symbols transmitted from the Nup antennas at<br>
the user terminal; rup is the receive vector for the symbols received on the Nap antennas at the<br>
access point; Tul     is an  NutxNM  diagonal matrix with entries for the complex gains<br>
associated with the transmit chain for the  Nut  antennas at the user<br>
terminal; Rap  is an   NapxNap  diagonal matrix with entries for the complex gains<br>
associated with the receive chain for the Nap antennas at the access point;<br>
and<br>
H  is an Nap x Nut channel response matrix for the uplink.<br>
[0026]	For a TDD system, since the downlink and uplink share the same frequency<br>
band, a high degree of correlation normally exists between the downlink and uplink channel responses.  Thus, the downlink and uplink channel response matrices may be<br>
assumed to be reciprocal (i.e., transposes) of each other and denoted H and H ,<br>
respectively, as shown in equations (1) and (2). However, the responses of the transmit/receive chains at the access point are typically not equal to the responses of the transmit/receive chains at the user terminal. The differences then result in the following<br>
inequality RapHr!ut * (R^HT^)7".<br>
[0027]	From equations (1) and (2), the "effective" downlink and uplink channel<br>
responses, H^ and Hup, which include the responses of the applicable transmit and<br>
receive chains, may be expressed as:<br>
5* = RaHTap	and      Hup = RapH7 Tm  .	Eq (3)<br>
Combining the two equations in equation set (3), the following relationship may be obtained:<br>
Ei&amp;x=(S;;HUPI-;)T=T;;HIPROP .	Eq (4)<br>
Rearranging equation (4), the following is obtained: IT7"  _ nr   R^TT   T'1 R    — IC^W   K<br>
i* up       -i-jt ±±u[ lidn JUp i^ap       *iut Sdn ±^ap<br>
or<br><br>
HDp=(K;i,Hd„Kap)r1	Eq(5)<br>
where Ka = T^' Rm and Kap = T;pRap. Equation (5) may also be expressed as:<br>
HupKut=(HdnKap)r .	Eq(6)<br>
[0028]	The left-hand side of equation (6) represents the calibrated channel response on<br>
the uplink, and the right-hand side represents the transpose of the calibrated channel<br>
response on the downlink. The application of the diagonal matrices, Km and Kap, to<br>
the effective downlink and uplink channel responses, as shown in equation (6), allows the calibrated channel responses for the downlink and uplink to be expressed as<br>
transposes of each other. The (NapxNap) diagonal matrix Kop for the access point is<br>
the ratio of the receive chain response Rap to the transmit chain response Tgp (i.e.,<br>
R<br>
KaP =■=*£-), where the ratio is taken element-by-element.   Similarly, the (Nttt *Nut)<br>
iap<br>
ut<br>
diagonal matrix Kul for the user terminal is the ratio of the receive chain response R<br>
to the transmit chain response Tut.<br>
[0029]	The matrices Kap and Kut include values that can account for differences in the<br>
transmit/receive chains at the access point and user terminal. This would then allow the channel response for one link to be expressed by the channel response for the other link, as shown in equation (6).<br>
[0030]	Calibration may be performed to determine the matrices   K,p   and   Kw.<br>
Typically, the true channel response H and the transmit/receive chain responses are not known nor can they be exactly or easily ascertained. Instead, the effective downlink and uplink channel responses, Hdn and Hup, may be estimated based on pilots sent on<br>
the downlink and uplink, respectively, as described below.  Estimates of the matrices<br>
Kap m&amp; Ku[, which are referred to as correction matrices Kap and Kut, may then be<br>
derived based on the downlink and uplink channel response estimates, Hdn and Hup, as<br>
described below. The matrices KM and K„, include correction factors that can account for differences in the transmit/receive chains at the access point and user terminal.<br><br>
[0031]	FIG. 2 illustrates the application of the correction matrices Kap and Kut to<br>
account for differences in the transmit/receive chains at the access point and user terminal. On the downlink, the transmit vector x^ is first multiplied with the matrix<br>
Kap by a unit 112. The subsequent processing by transmit chain 114 and receive chain<br>
154 for the downlink is the same as shown in FIG. 1.   Similarly, on the uplink, the<br>
transmit vector Xup is first multiplied with the matrix Knl by a unit 162.  Again, the<br>
subsequent processing by transmit chain 164 and receive chain 124 for the uplink is the<br>
same as shown in FIG. 1.<br>
[0032]	The "calibrated" downlink and uplink channel responses observed by the user<br>
terminal and access point, respectively, may then be expressed as:<br>
lo^HjLp	and        HMp=HupKm  ,	Eq(7)<br>
where H^ and H^ are estimates of the "true" calibrated channel response expressions in equation (6). Combining the two equations in equation set (7) using the expression in equation (6), it can be shown that Hcup » Hcdn.   The accuracy of the<br>
relationship Hcup » H^ is dependent on the accuracy of the matrices K^ and Km,<br>
which in turn is typically dependent on the quality of the downlink and uplink channel<br>
response estimates, H^ and Hup.<br>
[0033]	As shown above, calibration may be performed in a TDD system to determine<br>
the differences in the responses of the transmit/receive chains at the access point and user terminal, and to account for the differences. Once the transmit/receive chains have<br>
been calibrated, a calibrated channel response estimate obtained for one link (e.g., Hcdn)<br>
may be used to determine an estimate of the calibrated channel response for the other<br>
link (e.g., g^).<br>
[0034]	The calibration* techniques described herein may also be used for wireless<br>
communication systems that employ OFDM. OFDM effectively partitions the overall system bandwidth into a number of (NF) orthogonal subbands, which are also referred to as frequency bins or subchannels. With OFDM, each subband is associated with a respective subcarrier upon which data may be modulated.   For a MIMO system that<br><br>
utilizes OFDM (i.e., a MMO-OFDM system), each subband of each eigenmode may be viewed as an independent transmission channel.<br>
[0035]	The calibration may be performed in various manners.  For clarity, a specific<br>
calibration scheme is described below for a TDD MIMO-OFDM system. For this system, each subband of the wireless link may be assumed to be reciprocal.<br>
[0036]	FIG- 3 is a flow diagram of an embodiment of a process 300 for calibrating the<br>
downlink and uplink channel responses in the TDD MMO-OFDM system. Initially, the user terminal acquires the timing and frequency of the access point using acquisition procedures defined for the system (step 310). The user terminal may then send a message to initiate calibration with the access point, or the calibration may be initiated by the access point. The calibration may be performed in parallel with registration/authentication of the user terminal by the access point (e.g., during call setup) and may also be performed whenever warranted.<br>
[0037]	The calibration may be performed for all subbands that may be used for data<br>
transmission (which are referred to as the "data" subbands). Subbands not used for data transmission (e.g., guard subbands) typically do not need to be calibrated. However, since the frequency responses of the transmit/receive chains at the access point and user terminal are typically flat over most of the band of interest, and since adjacent subbands are likely to be correlated, the calibration may be performed for only a subset of the data subbands. If fewer than all data subbands are calibrated, then the subbands to be calibrated (which are referred to as the "designated" subbands) may be signaled to the access point (e.g., in the message sent to initiate the calibration).<br>
[0038]	For the calibration, the user terminal transmits a MIMO pilot on the designated<br>
subbands to the access point (step 312). The generation of the MEMO pilot is described in detail below. The duration of the uplink MIMO pilot transmission may be dependent on the number of designated subbands. For example, 8 OFDM symbols may be sufficient if calibration is performed for four subbands, and more (e.g., 20) OFDM symbols may be needed for more subbands. The total transmit power is typically fixed, so if the MIMO pilot is transmitted on a small number of subbands, then higher amounts of transmit power may be used for each of these subbands and the SKR for each subband is high. Conversely, if the MIMO pilot is transmitted on a large number of subbands then smaller amounts of transmit power may be used for each subband and the SNR for each subband is worse.   If the SNR of each subband is not sufficiently high,<br><br>
then more OFDM symbols may be sent for the MIMO pilot and integrated at the<br>
receiver to obtain a higher overall SNR for the subband.<br>
[0039]	The access point receives the uplink MIMO pilot and derives an estimate of the<br>
A<br>
uplink channel response, Hup(fc), for each of the designated subbands, where  k<br>
represents the subband index.    Channel estimation based on the MIMO pilot is<br>
described below. The uplink channel response estimates are quantized and sent to the<br>
		A<br>
user terminal (step 314). The entries in each matrix Hup(£) are complex channel gains<br>
between the N^ transmit and Nap receive antennas for the uplink for the £-th subband.<br>
The channel gains for all matrices may be scaled by a particular scaling factor, which is common across all designated subbands, to obtain the desired dynamic range.   For<br>
A<br>
example, the channel gains in each matrix Hup(fc) may be inversely scaled by the<br>
A<br>
largest channel gain for all matrices Hup(fc) for the designated subbands so that the<br>
largest channel gain is one in magnitude. Since the goal of the calibration is to normalize the gain/phase difference between the downlink and uplink, the absolute channel gains are not important. If 12-bit complex values (i.e., with 12-bit inphase (I) and 12-bit quadrature (Q) components) are used for the channel gains, then the downlink channel response estimates may be sent to the user terminal in 3-N^ -Nap *Nsb bytes, where "3" is for the 24 total bits used to represent the I and Q<br>
components and Nsb is the number of designated subbands.<br>
[0040]	The user terminal also receives a downlink MIMO pilot transmitted by the<br>
access point (step 316) and derives an estimate of the downlink channel response,<br>
A<br>
Sdn W, for each of the designated subbands based on the received pilot (step 318). The<br>
A	A<br>
user terminal then determines correction factors, Kap(£) and Kut(fc), for each of the designated subbands based on the uplink and downlink channel response estimates, H„(t) and BU.W (step 320).<br>
[0041]	For the derivation of the correction factors, the downlink and uplink channel<br>
responses for each subband are assumed to be reciprocal, with gain/phase corrections to account for the differences in the transmit/receive chains at the access point and user terminal, as follows:<br><br>
Hup(fc)Kul(i) = (Hdn(i)Kap(fc))r  ,for k€ K ,	Eq(8)<br>
where K represents a set with all data subbands. Since only estimates of the effectiv downlink and uplink channel responses are available for the designated subbands durinj calibration, equation (8) may be rewritten as:<br><br>
where K' represents a set with all designated subbands.   A correction vector kut(fc) may be defined to include only the Nut diagonal elements of Kut(fc).   Similarly, i correction vector kap(fc) may be defined to include only the Nap diagonal elements ol Kap(fe). [0042]      *   -The correction factors Kap(fc) and Km(fc) may be derived from the channel<br>
estimates  Hdn(&amp;)   and  Htip(&amp;)   in various manners, including by a matrix-ratio<br>
computation and a minimum mean square error (MMSE) computation. Both of these computation methods are described in further detail below. Other computation methods may also be used, and this is within the scope of the invention.<br><br>
(step 412), as follows:<br><br><br><br>
[0045]	In an embodiment, the correction vector for the access point, kap(A:), is defined<br>
to be equal to the mean of the normalized rows of C(k) and is derived by.the_steps.in	<br>
block 420. Each row of C(k) is first normalized by scaling each of the Nap elements in<br>
the    row    with    the    first    element   in    the    row    (step    422).        Thus,    if £/(&amp;) = [cu(k) ... ciSg (&amp;)] is the f-th row of C(k), then the normalized row £,(£) may<br><br>
The mean of the normalized rows is then determined as the sum of the _VW normalized<br>
rows divided by Nul (step 424). The correction vector kap(£) is set equal to this mean (step 426), which may be expressed as:<br><br>
Because of the normalization, the first element of kap (k) is unity.<br>
[0046]	In an embodiment, the correction vector for the user terminal, ka (k), is defined<br>
to be equal to the mean of the inverses of the normalized columns of C(£) and is derived by the steps in block 430.   The j-th column of C(k) is first normalized by<br>
scaling each element in the column with they-th element of the vector k^(k), which is<br>
denoted as KipJJ(k)    (step 432).   Thus, if c;(Jfc)*[qf/(*) ... c^Jk)? is the ;'-th<br>
column of C(k), then the normalized column cy(Jfc) may be expressed as:<br>
The mean of the inverses of the normalized columns is then determined as the sum of the inverses of the N    normalized columns divided by Nap (step 434). The correction<br>
vector kut (k) is set equal to this mean (step 436), which may be expressed as:<br><br><br>
where the inversion of the normalized columns, cy(fe), is performed element-wise.<br>
B. MMSE Computation<br>
[0047]	For the MMSE computation, the correction factors Kap(k) and .Km(k) are<br>
derived from the downlink and uplink channel response estimates H dn (k) and H  (k)   *<br>
such that the mean square error (MSE) between the calibrated downlink channel response and the calibrated uplink channel response is minimized. This condition may be expressed as:<br><br>
[0048]	Equation (16) is subject to the constraint that the lead element of Kap(fc) is set<br>
equal to unity (i.e., Kap00 (it) = 1). Without this constraint, the trivial solution would be obtained with all elements of the matrices Kap(k) and Kut(k) set equal to zero.  In<br>
equation (16), a matrix Y(k) is first obtained as Y(k:) = Kap(k)Hd0(k:)-Hlip(k)Ka(k).<br>
The square of the absolute value is next obtained for each of the Nap • Na entries of the<br>
matrix Y(k). The mean square error (or the square error, since a divide by Nap • N is<br>
omitted) is then equal to the sum of all Nap • Ntt squared values.<br>
[0049]	The MMSE computation is performed for each designated subband to obtain the<br>
correction factors Kap(k) and Kut(k) for that subband. The MMSE computation for<br>
one subband is described below. For simplicity, the subband index, k, is omitted in the following description.    Also for * simplicity, the elements of the downlink channel<br>
response estimate Hdn are denoted as {a{j}, the elements of the uplink channel response estimate Hup are denoted as {bH}, the diagonal elements of the matrix Kap are denoted<br><br><br><br><br>
[0052]	The matrix   A   includes  (Nap + Nltt-1)   rows, with the first Nap-1  rows<br>
corresponding to the Nap-l equations from equation set (18a) and the last N^ rows corresponding to the Nut equations from equation set (18b). In particular, the first row of the matrix A is generated from equation set (18a) with i = 2, the second row is generated with i = 3, and so on. The NQf&gt;~th row of the matrix A is generated from equation set (18b) with j = 1, and so on, and the last row is generated with j = N^. As shown above, the entries of the matrix A and the entries of the vector z may be<br>
obtained based on the entries in the matrices Hdn and Hup.<br>
[0053]	The correction factors are included in the vector y, which may be obtained as:<br>
y = A"'z .	Eq(20)<br><br>
[0054]	The results of the MMSE computation are correction matrices Kap and Kut that<br>
minimize the mean square error in the calibrated downlink and uplink channel responses, as shown in equation (16).   Since the matrices Kap and jfeut are obtained<br>
based on the downlink and uplink channel response estimates, H^ and Hup, the quality<br>
of the correction matrices Kap and Kut are thus dependent on the quality of the channel<br>
A	A	__<br>
estimates Hdn and Hup.  The MEMO pilot may be averaged at the receiver to obtain<br>
A	A<br>
more accurate estimates for H^ and Hup.<br>
A	A<br>
[0055]	The  correction matrices,   Kap   and   Kut, obtained based on  the MMSE<br>
computation are generally better than the correction matrices obtained based on the matrix-ratio computation, especially when some of the channel gains are small and measurement noise can greatly degrade the channel gains.<br>
C. Post Computation<br>
[0056]	Regardless  of the particular computation method selected for use,  after<br>
completion of tfie computation of the correction matrices, the user terminal sends to the<br>
A<br>
access point the correction vectors for the access point, kap(£), for all designated<br>
A<br>
subbands. If 12-bit complex values are used for each correction factor in kap(fc), then<br>
A<br>
the correction vectors kap(fc) for all designated subbands may be sent to the access point in 3-(^ -1) -Nstf bytes, where "3" is for the 24 total bits used for the I and Q<br>
A<br>
components and (N -1) results from the first element in each vector kap(£) being equal to unity and thus not needing to be sent. If the first element is set to 29 -1 = +511, then 12 dB of headroom is available (since the maximum positive 12-bit signed value is 2:I -1 = +2047), which would then allow gain mismatch of up to 12 dB between the downlink and uplink to be accommodated by 12-bit values. If the downlink and uplink match to within 12 dB and the first element is normalized to a value of 511, then the other elements should be no greater than 511-4 = 2044 in * absolute value and can be represented with 12 bits.<br><br>
[0057]	A pair of correction vectors kap(fc) and kut(it) is obtained for each designated<br>
subband. If the calibration is performed for fewer than all of the data subbands, then the correction factors for the "uncalibrated" subbands may be obtained by interpolating the correction factors obtained for the designated subbands.   The interpolation may be<br>
performed by the access point to obtain the correction vectors k^fc)., for keK.<br>
Similarly, the interpolation may be performed by the user terminal to obtain the<br>
correction vectors k ut (k), for k e K .<br>
[0058]	The access point and user terminal thereafter use their respective correction<br>
vectors kap(fc)  and kut(fe), or the corresponding correction matrices Kap(fc)  and<br>
Kut (fc), for k 6 K , to scale modulation symbols prior to transmission over the wireless channel, as described below. The effective downlink channel that the user terminal sees would then be Hcdn (*) = Hdn (*)Kap (*).<br>
[0059]	The calibration scheme described above, whereby a vector of correction factors<br>
is obtained for each of the access point and user terminal, allows "compatible" correction vectors to be derived for the access point when the calibration is performed by different user terminals. If the access point has already been calibrated (e.g., by one or more other user terminals), then the current correction vectors may be updated with the newly derived correction vectors.<br>
[0060]	For example, if two user terminals simultaneously perform the calibration<br>
procedure, then the calibration results from these user terminals may be averaged to improve performance. However, calibration is typically performed for one user terminal at a time. So the second user terminal observes the downlink with the correction vector for the first user terminal already applied. In this case, the product of the second correction vector with the old correction vector may be used as the new correction vector, or a "weighted averaging" (described below) may also be used. The access point typically uses a single correction vector for all user terminals, and not different ones for different user terminals (although this may also be implemented). Updates from multiple user terminals or sequential updates from one user terminal may be treated in the same manner. The updated vectors may be directly applied (by a product operation). Alternatively, if some averaging is desired to reduce measurement noise, then weighted averaging may be used as described below.<br><br>
[0061]	Thus, if the access point uses correction vectors kapl(fc) to transmit the MIMO<br>
pilot from which the user terminal determines new correction vectors kap2(fc), then the updated correction vectors kap3(&amp;) are the product of the current and new correction<br>
vectors.  The correction vectors kapl(fe) and kap2(&amp;) may be derived by the same or<br>
different user terminals.<br>
[0062]	In   one   embodiment,   the   updated   correction   vectors   are   defined   as<br>
A	A	A<br>
kap3(£) = kapl(fc)-kap2(A:), where the multiplication is element-by-element. In another embodiment,     the     updated     correction     vectors     may     be     redefined     as<br>
!iap3 W = Kapi W' kap2(&amp;), where a is a factor used to provide weighted averaging (e.g.,<br>
0 
better.  The updated correction vectors kap3(fc) may then be used by the access point<br>
until they are updated again.<br>
[0063]	As noted above, the calibration may be performed for fewer than all data<br>
subbands. For example, the calibration may be performed for every n-th subband, where n may be determined by the expected response of the transmit/receive chains (e.g., n may be 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on). The calibration may also be performed for non-uniformly distributed subbands. For example, since there may be more filter roll-off at the edges of the passband, which may create more mismatch in the transmit/receive chains, more subbands near the band edges may be calibrated. In general, any number and any distribution of subbands may be calibrated, and this is within the scope of the invention.<br>
[0064]	In the above description, the correction vectors kap(&amp;) and kut(&amp;), for keKare derived by the user terminal, and the vectors kap(Ar) are sent back to the access point. This scheme advantageously distributes the calibration processing among the user terminals for a multiple-access system.   However, the correction vectors kap(&amp;)<br>
and kut (k) may also be derived by the access point,-which would then send the vectors kul (k) back to the user terminal, and this is within the scope of the invention.<br><br>
[0065]	The calibration scheme described above allows each user terminal to calibrate<br>
its transmit/receive chains in real-time via over-the-air transmission. This allows user terminals with different frequency responses to achieve high performance without the need for tight frequency response specifications or to perform calibration at the factory. The access point may be calibrated by multiple user terminals to provide improved accuracy.<br>
D. Gain Considerations<br>
[0066]	The calibration may be performed based on "normalized" gains for the downlink<br>
and uplink channels, which are gains given relative to the noise floor at the receiver. The use of the normalized gains allows the characteristics of one link (including the channel gains and SNR per eigenmode) to be obtained based on gain measurements for the other link, after the downlink and uplink have been calibrated.<br>
[0067]	The access point and user terminal may initially balance their receiver input<br>
levels such that the noise levels on the receive paths for the access'point and user terminal are approximately the same. The balancing may be done by estimating the noise floor, that is, finding a section of a received TDD frame (i.e., a unit of downlink/uplink transmission) that has a minimum average power over a particular time duration (e.g., one or two symbol periods). Generally, the time just before the start of each TDD frame is clear of transmissions, since any uplink data needs to be received by the access point and then a receive/transmit turnaround time is necessary before the access point transmits on the downlink. Depending on the interference environment, the noise floor may be determined based on a number of TDD frames. The downlink and uplink channel responses are then measured relative to this noise floor. More specifically, the channel gain for a given subband of a given transmit/receive antenna pair may first be obtained, for example, as the ratio of the received pilot symbol over the transmitted pilot symbol for that subband of that transmit/receive antenna pair. The normalized gain is then the measured gain divided by the noise floor.<br>
[0068]	A large difference in the normalized gains for the access point and the<br>
normalized gains for the user terminal can result in the correction factors for the user terminal being greatly different from unity. The correction factors for the access point<br>
are close to unity because the first element of the matrix Kap is set to 1.<br><br>
[0069]	If the correction factors for the user terminal differ greatly from unity, then the<br>
user terminal may not be able to apply the computed correction factors. This is because the user terminal has a constraint on its maximum transmit power and may not be capable of increasing its transmit power for large correction factors. Moreover, a reduction in transmit power for small correction factors is generally not desirable, since this may reduce the achievable data rate.<br>
[0070]	Thus, the user terminal can transmit using a scaled version of the computed<br>
correction factors. The scaled calibration factors may be obtained by scaling the computed correction factors by a particular scaling value, which may be set equal to a gain delta (difference or ratio) between the downlink and uplink channel responses. This gain delta can be computed as an average of the differences (or deltas) between the normalized gains for the-downlink and uplink. The scaling value (or gain delta) used for the correction factors for the user terminal can be sent to the access point along with the computed correction factors for the access point.<br>
[0071]	With the correction factors and the scaling value or gain delta, the downlink<br>
channel characteristics may be determined from the measured uplink channel response, and vice versa. If the noise floor at either the access point or the user terminal changes, then the gain delta can be updated, and the updated gain delta may be sent in a message to the other entity.<br>
[0072]	In the above description, the calibration results in two sets (or vectors or<br>
matrices) of correction factors for each subband, with one set being used by the access point for downlink data transmission and the other set being used by the user terminal for uplink data transmission. The calibration may also be performed such that two sets of correction factors are provided for each subband, with one set being used by the access point for uplink data reception and the other set being used by the user terminal for downlink data reception. The calibration may also be performed such that one set of correction factors is obtained for each subband, and this set may be used at either the access point or the user terminal. In general, the calibration is performed such that the calibrated downlink and uplink channel responses are reciprocal, regardless of where correction factors are applied.<br><br>
2. MEV10 Pilot<br>
[0073]	For the calibration, a MIMO pilot is transmitted on the uplink by the user<br>
terminal to allow the access point to estimate the uplink channel response, and a MIMO pilot is transmitted on the downlink by the access point to allow the user terminal to estimate the downlink channel response. The same or different MIMO pilots may be used for the downlink and uplink, and the MIMO pilots used are known at both the access point and user terminal.<br>
[0074]	In an embodiment, the MIMO pilot comprises a specific OFDM symbol<br>
(denoted as "P") that is transmitted from each of the NT transmit antennas, where NT = N   for the downlink and NT = Nut for the uplink. For each transmit antenna, the<br>
same P OFDM symbol is transmitted in each symbol period designated for MIMO pilot transmission. However, the P OFDM symbols for each antenna are covered with a different JV-chip Walsh sequence assigned to that antenna, where NZNap for the<br>
downlink and iV &gt; Nut for the uplink.   The Walsh covering maintains orthogonality<br>
between the NT transmit antennas and allows the receiver to distinguish the individual<br>
transmit antennas.<br>
[0075]	The P OFDM symbol includes one modulation symbol for each of the Nsb<br>
designated subbands.  The P OFDM symbol thus comprises a specific "word" of N5b<br>
modulation symbols that may be selected to facilitate channel estimation by the<br>
receiver. This word may also be defined to minimize the peak-to-average variation in<br>
the transmitted MIMO pilot. This may then reduce the amount of distortion and non-<br>
linearity generated by the transmit/receive chains, which may then result in improved<br>
accuracy for the channel estimation.<br>
[0076]	For clarity, a specific MIMO pilot is described below for a specific MIMO-<br>
OFDM system. For this system, the access point and user terminal each has four transmit/receive antennas. The system bandwidth is partitioned into 64 orthogonal subbands (i.e., NF =64), which are assigned indices of +31 to -32. Of these 64 subbands, 48 subbands (e.g., with indices of ±{1, ..., 6, 8, ..., 20, 22,..., 26}) are used for data, 4 subbands (e.g., with indices of ±{7, 21}) are used for pilot and possibly "Signaling, the DC subband (with index of 0) is not used, and the remaining subbands are also not used and serve as guard subbands. This OFDM subband structure is described<br><br>
in farther detail in a document for IEEE Standard 802.11a and entitled "Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) specifications: High-speed Physical Layer in the 5 GHz Band," September 1999, which is publicly available and incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
where g is a gain for the pilot. The values within the {} bracket are given for subband indices -32 through -1 (for the first line) and 0 through +31 (for the second line). Thus, the first line for P(real) and P(imag) indicates that symbol (-1-;) is transmitted in<br>
subband -26, symbol (-1 + ;) is transmitted in subband -25, and so on. The second line<br>
for P(real) and P(imag) indicates that symbol (I-j) is transmitted in subband 1,<br>
symbol (-1-/) is transmitted in subband 2, and so on.   Other OFDM symbols may<br>
also be used for the MIMO pilot.<br>
[0078]	In an embodiment, the four transmit antennas are assigned Walsh sequences of<br>
W, =1111, W2 = 1010, W3 =1100, and W4 = 1001 for the MIMO pilot. For a given<br>
Walsh sequence, a value of "1" indicates that a P OFDM symbol is transmitted and a<br>
value of "0" indicates that a -P OFDM symbol is transmitted (i.e., each of the 52<br>
modulation symbols in P is inverted).<br>
[0079]	Table 1 lists the OFDM symbols transmitted from each of the four transmit<br>
antennas for a MIMO pilot transmission that spans four symbol periods.<br><br><br>
For longer MEMO pilot transmission, the Walsh sequence for each transmit antenna is<br>
simply repeated. For this set of Walsh sequences, the MIMO pilot transmission occurs<br>
in integer multiples of four symbol periods to ensure orthogonality among the four<br>
transmit antennas.<br>
[0080]	The receiver may derive an estimate of the channel response based on the<br>
received MIMO pilot by performing the complementary processing. In particular, to recover the pilot sent from transmit antenna i and received by receive antennaj, the pilot received by receive antenna j is first processed with the Walsh sequence assigned to transmit antenna i in a complementary manner to the Walsh covering performed at the transmitter. The decovered OFDM symbols for all Npi symbol periods for the MIMO<br>
pilot are then accumulated, where the accumulation is performed individually for each of the 52 subbands used to carry the MIMO pilot. The results of the accumulation is<br>
hifj(k), for k = ± (1,..., 26}, which is an estimate of the effective channel response from<br>
transmit antenna  i  to  receive  antenna ;  (i.e.,  including the responses for the<br>
transmit/receive chains) for the 52 data and pilot subbands.<br>
[0081]	The same processing may be performed to recover the pilot from each transmit<br>
antenna at each receive antenna. The pilot processing provides N   * N^ values that are<br>
the elements of the effective channel response estimate, Hup(£) or H^Ci), for each of<br>
the 52 subbands.<br>
[0082]	The channel estimation described above may be performed by both the access<br>
point and the user terminal during calibration to obtain the effective uplink channel<br>
response estimate   Hup(fc)   and the effective downlink channel response estimate<br>
fidn(*)» respectively, which are then used to derive the correction factors as described above.<br>
3. Spatial Processing<br>
0083]	The correlation between the downlink and uplink channel responses may be<br>
exploited to simplify the channel estimation and spatial processing at the access point and user terminal for TDD MIMO and MMO-OFDM systems. This simplification is<br><br><br><br>
[0087]	The singular value decomposition is described in further detail by Gilbert Strang<br>
entitled "Linear Algebra and Its Applications,'1 Second Edition, Academic Press, 1980.<br>
[0088]	The user terminal can estimate the calibrated downlink channel response based<br>
on a MIMO pilot sent by the access point. The user terminal may then perform the singular value decomposition of the calibrated downlink channel response estimate<br>
A	A,	a<br>
Hcdn(k), for k e K, to obtain the diagonal matrices £(k) and the matrices Vuk) of<br>
A		<br>
left eigenvectors of Hcdn(k).   This singular value decomposition may be given as<br>
Hcdn (k) = Yut WlWfiLpC*), where the hat (" A ") above each matrix indicates that it is<br>
an estimate of the actual matrix.<br>
[0089]	Similarly, the access point can estimate the calibrated uplink channel response<br>
based on a MIMO pilot sent by the user terminal. The aafesS point may then perform the singular value decomposition of the calibrated uplink channel response estimate<br>
Hcup(fc), for k e K , to obtain the diagonal matrices 2(i) and the matrices V^(k) of<br>
A<br>
left eigenvectors of H^i), for ke K.   This singular value decomposition may be<br>
given as Ec,P(k) = llap(k)i(k)\l(k).<br>
[0090]	Because of the reciprocal channel and the calibration, the singular value<br>
decomposition only need to be performed by either the user terminal or the access point<br>
A	A<br>
to obtain both matrices Vot(fc) and Uap(fc). If performed by the user terminal, then the matrices Vut(£) are used for spatial processing at the user terminal and the matrices<br>
A<br>
Uap(&amp;) may be sent back to the access point.<br>
[0091]	The access point may also be able to obtain the matrices Uap(fc) and Z(k) based<br>
on a steered reference sent by the user terminal. Similarly, the user terminal may also<br>
be able to obtain the matrices Vul(i) and 2(fc) based on a steered reference sent by the<br>
access point. The steered reference is described in detail in the aforementioned provisional U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 60/421,309.<br>
[0092]	The matrices Uap(&amp;)  and t(k)  may be used to transmit independent data<br>
streams on the Ns eigenmodes of the MIMO channel, where Ns 
 <br>
spatial processing to transmit multiple data streams on the downlink and uplink is described below.<br>
A.	Uplink Spatial Processing<br>
[0093]	The spatial processing by the user terminal for an uplink transmission may be<br>
expressed as:<br>
xup(i)4ji)Yul(i)sup(i)  ,for ke K,	Eq(24)<br>
where xup(£) the transmit vector for the uplink for the fc-th subband; and<br>
sup(&amp;) is a "data" vector with up to Ns non-zero entries for the modulation symbols to be transmitted on the Ns eigenmodes of the fc-th subband.<br>
[0094]	Additional processing may also be performed on the modulation symbols prior<br>
to transmission. For example, channel inversion may be applied across the data subbands (e.g., for each eigenmode) such that the received SNR is approximately equal for all data subbands. The spatial processing may then be expressed as:<br>
xupW = Kut(fe)Vut(fc)Wup(fc)sup(fc) ,for ke K,	Eq(25)<br>
where Wup (k) is a matrix with weights for the (optional) uplink channel inversion.<br>
[0095]	The channel inversion may also be performed by assigning transmit power to<br>
each subband before the modulation takes place, in which case the vector sup(fc)<br>
includes the channel inversion coefficients and the matrix Wup(fc) can be omitted from<br>
equation (25).   In the following description, the use of the matrix Wup(fc) in an<br>
equation indicates that the channel inversion coefficients are not incorporated into the vector sup(fc). The lack of the matrix W   (fc) in an equation can indicate either (1)<br>
channel inversion is not performed or (2) channel inversion is performed and incorporated into the vector s  (fc).<br>
[0096]	Channel inversion may be performed as described in the aforementioned<br>
provisional U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 60/421,309 and in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/229,209, entitled "Coded MIMO Systems with Selective Channel Inversion Applied Per Eigenmode," filed August 27, 2002, assigned to the assignee of the present application and incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
[0097]	The received uplink transmission at the access point may be expressed as:<br>
£uP(K)   =Hup(K)xupW + nW        JovkeK,	Eq(26)<br>
-Uap(k)i(*^(*) + n(K)<br>
where   rup(£) is the received vector for the uplink for the k-th subband;<br>
n(k) is additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) for the k-th subband; and<br>
xup(£) is as shown in equation (24).<br>
[0098]	The spatial processing (or matched filtering) at the access point for the received<br>
uplink transmission may be expressed as:<br>
M*)   =i~\k)]ll(k)rup(k)<br>
= i"\*)^(«(^(«S(*)SBp(*) + n(«)  JorkeK,      Eq(27)<br>
= Sup (*)+!(*)<br>
where sup(&amp;) is an estimate of the vector sup(fe) transmitted by the user terminal on the<br>
uplink, and n(k) is the post-processed noise. Equation (27) assumes that channel inversion was not performed at the transmitter and that the received vector rup(/:) is as shown in equation (26).<br>
B. Downlink Spatial Processing<br>
[0099]	The spatial processing by the access point for a downlink transmission may be<br>
expressed as:<br>
^(k)^p(k)Vap(k)s^(^ JorkeK,	Eq(28)<br>
where x^ (k) is the transmit vector and s^ (k) is the data vector for the downlink.<br>
[00100]	Again, additional processing (e.g., channel inversion) may also be performed on<br>
the modulation symbols prior to transmission. The spatial processing may then be expressed as:<br>
xdn (*) = Kap (k)£? (*) Wdn (k)sdn (k)  JorkeK,	Eq (29)<br>
where W^ (k) is a matrix with weights for the (optional) downlink channel inversion.<br>
[00101]	* The received downlink transmission at the user terminal may be expressed as:<br><br>
rdn (*)   = H^ (k)x* (k) + n(k)       , for k e K,	Eq (30)<br>
= Y;tWS(K)sdn(ft) + nW<br>
where Xdn(*) lS the transmit vector as shown in equation (28).<br>
[00102]	The spatial processing (or matched filtering) at the user terminal for the received<br>
downlink transmission may be expressed as:<br>
U*)   -t~\k)£l(k)rda(k)<br>
= £~\*)Y«(*)(Y^	JotkeK.   . Eq(31)<br>
Equation (31) assumes that channel inversion was not performed at the transmitter and that the received vector r^i) is as shown in equation (30).<br>
[00103]	Table 2 summarizes the spatial processing at the access point and user terminal<br>
for data transmission and reception. Table 2 assumes that the additional processing by W(K) is performed at the-transmitter.   However, if this additional processing is not<br>
performed, then W(£) can be regarded as the identify matrix.<br><br>
[00104]	In the above description and as shown in Table 2, the correction matrices<br>
Kap(K) and K.x(k) are used for the transmit spatial processing at the access point and<br>
user terminal, respectively.  This can simplify the overall spatial processing since the modulation symbols may need to be scaled anyway (e.g., for channel inversion) and the<br>
correction matrices Kap(&amp;) and Kut(K) may be combined with the weight matrices W^ (k)   and   Wup(k)   to   obtain   gain   matrices   G^ (k)   and   Gup(k),   where<br>
GJ*) = Wj*;Kap(*) and GupW = Wup(*)Kut(K).   The processing may also be<br><br>
performed such that the correction matrices are used for the receive spatial processing (instead of the transmit spatial processing).<br>
4 MIMO-OFDM System<br>
FIG. 5 is a block diagram of an embodiment of an access point 502 and a user terminal 504 within a TDD MIMO-OFDM system. For simplicity, the following description assumes that the access point and user terminal are each equipped with four transmit/receive antennas.<br>
On the downlink, at access point 502, a transmit (TX) data processor 510 receives traffic data (i.e., information bits) from a data source 508 and signaling and other information from a controller 530. TX data processor 510 formats, codes, interleaves, and modulates (i.e., symbol maps) the data to provide a stream of modulation symbols for each eigenmode used for data transmission. A TX spatial (or MIMO) processor 520 receives the modulation symbol streams from TX data processor 510 and performs spatial processing to provide four streams of transmit symbols, one stream for each antenna. TX spatial processor 520 also multiplexes in pilot symbols as appropriate (e.g., for calibration).<br>
Each modulator (MOD) 522 receives and processes a respective transmit symbol stream to provide a corresponding stream of OFDM symbols. Each OFDM symbol stream is further processed by a transmit chain within modulator 522 to provide a corresponding downlink modulated signal. The four downlink modulated signals from modulator 522a through 522d are then transmitted from four antennas 524a through 524d respectively.<br>
At user terminal 504, antennas 552 receive the transmitted downlink modulated signals, and each antenna provides a received signal to a respective demodulator (DEMOD) 554. Each demodulator 554 (which includes a receive chain) performs processing complementary to that performed at modulator 522 and provides received symbols. A receive (RX) spatial (or MIMO) processor 560 then performs spatial processing on the received symbols from all demodulators 554 to provide recovered symbols, which are estimates of the modulation symbols sent by the access point.  During calibration, RX spatial<br>
(or MIMO) processor 560 provides a calibrated downlink channel estimate,_//^„ (k)9 based<br>
on the MIMO pilot transmitted by the access point.<br>

[00109]	An RX data processor 570 processes (e.g., symbol demaps, deinterleaves, and<br>
decodes) the recovered symbols to provide decoded data. The decoded data may include recovered traffic data, signaling, and so on, which are provided to a data sink 572 for storage an&amp;'or a controller 580 for further processing. During calibration, RX<br>
data processor 570 provides the calibrated uplink channel estimate, Hcup(fe), which is<br>
derived by the access point and sent on the downlink.<br>
[00110]	Controllers 530 and 580 control the operation of various processing units at the<br>
access point and user terminal, respectively.   During calibration, controller 580 may<br>
A	A<br>
receive the channel response estimates Hcdll(£) and H   (K), derive the correction<br>
A	A	A	^^^<br>
matrices Kap(i) and Kol(t), provide the matrices Kut(&amp;) to a TX spatial processor<br>
A,	__<br>
592 for uplink transmission, and provide the matrices Kap(fe) to a TX data processor<br>
590 for transmission back to the access point. Memory units 532 and 582 store data and program codes used by controllers 530 and 580, respectively.<br>
[00111]	The processing for the uplink may be the same or different from the processing<br>
for the downlink. Data and signaling are processed (e.g., coded, interleaved, and modulated) by a TX data processor 590 and further spatially processed by TX spatial processor 592, which multiplexes in pilot symbols during calibration. The pilot and modulation symbols are further processed by modulators 554 to generate uplink modulated signals, which are then transmitted via antennas 552 to the access point.<br>
[00112]	At access point 110, the uplink modulated signals are received by antennas 524,<br>
demodulated by demodulators 522, and processed by an RX spatial processor 540 and an RX data processor 542 in a complementary to that performed at the user terminal. During calibration, RX spatial processor 560 also provides a calibrated uplink channel<br>
estimate, Hcup(Jt), based on the MIMO pilot transmitted by the user terminal.   The<br>
matrices Hcup (k) are received by controller 530 and then provided to TX data processor<br>
510 for transmission back to the user terminal.<br>
[00113]	FIG. 6 is a block diagram of a TX spatial processor 520a, which may be used<br>
for TX spatia] processors 520 and 592 in FIG. 5. For simplicity, the following description assumes that all four eigenmodes are selected for use.<br><br>
[00114]	Within processor 520a, a demultiplexer 632 receives four modulation symbol<br>
steams (denoted as sx(n) through sA(n)) to be transmitted on four eigenmodes, demultiplexes each stream into ND substreams for the ND data subbands, and provides four modulation symbol substreams for each data subband to a respective TX subband spatial processor 640. Each processor 640 performs the processing shown in equation (24), (25), (28), or (29) for one subband.<br>
[00115]	Within each TX subband spatial processor 640, the four modulation symbol<br>
substreams (denoted as s}(k) through sA{k)) are provided to four multipliers 642a through 642d, which also receive the gains g,(K), g2(k\ gz(k), and gA(k) for the four<br>
eigenmodes of the associated subband. For the downlink, the four gains for each data subband are the diagonal .elements of the corresponding matrix   G6a{k)t where<br>
Gdn(*0 = Kap(*) or Gdn(*) = W^WK^OK). For the uplink, the gains are the diagonal<br>
elements of the matrix Gup(*), where Gup(k) = KJk) or Gup(K) = Wup(*)Km(K).<br>
Each multiplier 642 scales its modulation symbols with its gain gm(k) to provide scaled<br>
modulation symbols.  Multipliers 642a through 642d provides four scaled modulation<br>
symbol substreams to four beam-formers 650a through 650d, respectively.<br>
[00116]	Each  beam-former 650  performs  beam-forming  to  transmit  one symbol<br>
substream on one eigenmode of one subband. Each beam-former 650 receives one scaled symbol substream sm(k)  and performs beam-forming using the eigenvector<br>
\_m(k) for the associated eigenmode. Within each beam-former 650, the scaled modulation symbols are provided to four multipliers 652a through 652d, which also receive four elements, vml(£), vMi2(*), vmZ(k\ and vmA(k), of the eigenvector \m(k)<br>
for the associated eigenmode. The eigenvector vOT(£) is the m~th column of the matrix<br>
Uap(&amp;) for the downlink and is the m-th column of the matrix Vut(£) for the uplink.<br>
Each multiplier 652 then multiplies the scaled modulation symbols with its eigenvector value vmj(k) to provide "beam-formed" symbols.   Multipliers 652a through 652d<br>
provide four beam-formed symbol substreams (which are to be transmitted from four antennas) to summers 660a through 660d, respectively.<br><br>
[00117]	Each summer 660 receives and sums four beam-formed symbols for the four<br>
eigenmodes for each symbol period to provide a preconditioned symbol for an associated transmit antenna. Summers 660a through 660d provides four substreams of preconditioned symbols for four transmit antennas to buffers/multiplexers 670a through 670d, respectively.<br>
[00118]	Each buffer/multiplexer 670 receives pilot symbols and the preconditioned<br>
symbols from TX subband spatial processors 640 for the ND data subbands.   Each<br>
buffer/multiplexer 670 then multiplexes pilot symbols, preconditioned symbols, and zeros for the pilot subbands, data subbands, and unused subbands, respectively, to form a sequence of NF transmit symbols for that symbol period. During calibration, pilot symbols are transmitted on the designated subbands. Multipliers 668a through 668d cover the pilot symbols for the four antennas with Walsh sequences Wx through W4, respectively, assigned to the four antennas, as described above and shown in Table 1. Each buffer/multiplexer 670 provides a stream of transmit symbols xt(n) for one transmit antenna, where the transmit symbol stream comprises concatenated sequences of NF transmit symbols.<br>
[00119]	The spatial processing and OFDM modulation is described in further detail in<br>
the aforementioned provisional U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 60/421,309.<br>
[00120]	In  various  embodiments of the invention  as  described herein, peer-peer<br>
communication between the various user terminals (UTs or STAs) in the same basic service set (BSS) or different BSSs can be implemented as described below. The UTs or STAs that calibrate with a single access point (AP) are members of a basic service set (BSS). The single access point is a common node to all UTs in the BSS. The calibration methods as described above facilitate the following types of communication:<br>
(i) A UT in the BSS can use TX steering to communicate directly with the AP on the uplink (UL) and the AP can use TX steering to communicate with the UTs on the downlink (DL).<br>
(ii) A UT in the BSS can communicate directly with another UT in the same BSS using steering. In this case, this peer-peer communication has to be bootstrapped because neither UT knows the channel-between them. In various embodiments, the bootstrap procedure works as follows:<br><br>
-	The initiator of the peer-peer link is the designate AP (DAP), and the other UT is the designated UT (DUT).<br>
-	The DAP sends MMO pilot to the DUT along with a request to establish link, which contains the BSS ID plus the DAP ID. The request needs to be sent in a common mode (i.e. Tx diversity).<br>
-	The DUT responds by sending back steered MMO pilot plus an<br>
acknowledgement which contains the DUT ID, its BSS ID, and some rate<br>
indicator for the DAP to use.<br>
-	The DAP can then use steering on the DL and the DUT can use steering on the<br>
UL. Rate control and tracking can be accommodated by breaking the<br>
transmissions into DL and UL segments with sufficient time between them to<br>
allow for processing.<br>
(iii) UTs that belong to one BSS (e.g., BSS1) can steer to UTs that belong to another BSS (e.g., BSS2), even though each has calibrated with a different AP. However, there will be a phase rotation ambiguity (per subband) in this case. This is because the calibration procedure as described above establishes a reference which is unique to the AP it has calibrated with. The reference is a complex constant,<br>
SAPRX (0) where k is the subband index and j is the AP index and 0 is the index of the reference antenna (e.g., antenna 0) used on the AP. In one embodiment, this constant is common to all UTs in a given BSS, but is independent for different BSSs.<br>
[001211	As a result, when a UT from BSS1 communicates with a UT in BSS2, steering<br>
without correction or compensation for this constant may result in a phase rotation and amplitude scaling of the entire eigensystem. The phase rotation can be determined through the use of pilot (steered and unsteered) and removed in the receivers of each respective UT. In one embodiment, the amplitude correction or compensation can simply be an SNR scaling and can be removed by estimation of the noise floor at each receiver, which may impact rate selection.<br>
[00122]	In various embodiments, the peer-peer exchange between UTs that belong to<br>
different BSSs may work as follows:<br>
-	The initiator of the peer-peer link (e.g., UT in BSS1) is the designate AP<br>
(DAP), and the other UT (e.g., UT in BSS2) is the designated UT (DUT).<br><br>
-	The DAP sends MIMO pilot to the DUT along with a request to establish link,<br>
which contains the respective BSS ED plus the DAP ID. The request needs to be sent in<br>
a common mode (i.e. Tx diversity).<br>
-	The DUT responds by sending back steered MIMO pilot plus an<br>
acknowledgement which contains DUT ID, its BSS ID, and some rate indicator for the<br>
DAP to use.<br>
-	The DAP receiver (Rx) can estimate the phase rotation on the uplink (UL) and<br>
apply the collection constant to each subband. The DAP can then use steering on the<br>
downlink (DL) but needs to include a preamble of steered reference on at least the first<br>
steered packet to allow the DOT receiver (Rx) to correct or compensate for the phase<br>
rotation on the DL for each subband. Subsequent DL transmissions may not require a<br>
steered reference preamble. Rate control and tracking can be accommodated by<br>
breaking the transmissions into DL and UL segments with sufficient time between them<br>
to allow for processing.<br>

means. For example, these techniques may be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof. For a hardware implementation, the techniques may be implemented at the access point and user terminal within one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), digital signal processors (DSPs), digital signal processing devices (DSPDs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), processors, controllers, micro-controllers, microprocessors, other electronic units designed to perform the functions described herein, or a combination thereof.<br>
