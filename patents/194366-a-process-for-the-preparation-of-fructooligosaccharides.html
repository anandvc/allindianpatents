				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of fructooligosaccharides. The process in particular uses the extracellular fructosyl transferase from Aspergillus oryzae FT.SGP.98, a new source hitherto unreported.<br>
Fructooligosaccharides are food ingredients that are important for their functional properties and their mild sweetness very similar to sucrose. They are non-cariogenic, have low calorific value and promote the proliferation of bifidobacteria in the colon. These properties make them suitable for use in beverages, infant milk powders, confectionery, bakery products, yoghurts and dairy desserts.<br>
Reference may be made to Y. D. Hang, E. E. Woodams and K. Y. Jang, Biotechnology Letters, 17 (3), 295-298, 1995, wherein fructooligosaccharides were produced from sucrose using extracellular fructosyl transferase (EC. 2.4.1.9) from Aspergillus foetidus NRRL 337. The organism was grown in a medium consisting of 50 g of apple pomace in solid state culture. After 120 h of growth at 30 °C, the pomace was blended with water, centrifuged and the supernatant was used as a source of enzyme. The production of FOS was carried out at 40 °C with 0.3 M sucrose and 0.01 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) in a total volume of 2 ml. T le maximum yield of FOS obtained was 224 g/L at the end of 59 h. This corresponded to a conversion yield of 47 % of the initial sucrose (476 g/L). The drawbacks of this process were the lower yields and longer reaction periods.<br><br>
Reference may be made to Xiao-Dong Wang and S. K. Rakshit, Process Biochemistry, 35, 771-775, 2000, wherein production of FOS by multiple forms of transferase enzymes from Aspergillus foetidus was reported. Aspergillus foetidus was grown on liquid medium containing 1 % maltose, 3 % corn steep liquor, 0.05 % MgS04, 0.2 % K2HPO4 and 0.7 % KH2PO4 with a pH of 6.0. A portion (1 ml) of this suspension was added to 100 ml of the cultivation medium in 500 ml flasks and incubated at 30 °C for 7 days with agitation (200 rpm). After incubation, cultures were filtered through Whatman No.1 filter paper to remove mycelia. Filtrates were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C and supernatants were used as enzyme source. The production of FOS was carried out using 30 % sucrose and pH 5.0 with 12-h incubation. The maximum yield obtained was 29 % of the total products. The drawbacks of this process are the low yield obtained and long hours of fermentation time needed to produce the enzyme.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the production of fructooligosaccharides, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of fructooligosaccharides using extracellular fructosyl transferase which comprises;<br>
(a) growing the culture from Aspergillus oryzae sp. in a medium consisting<br>
of 1 % sucrose and 0.2 % yeast extract at pH ranging between 5-6 , at a<br>
temperature ranging between 25 - 35 °C at about 250 rpm for 24- 120 hrs to<br>
develop the inoculum,<br>
(b)	transferring 5-15 % of the said inoculum to a medium consisting of 20 % sucrose, 0.5 % yeast extract, 0.05 % MgS04. 7H2O, 1 % NaNOa, 0.25 % K2 HPO4, 0.25 % KH2PO4, 0.25 % NaCI and 0.5 % NH4CI and growing for a period of ranging between 24-120 tirs at 250 rpm at 25-35°c,<br>
(c)	harvesting the entire culture broth,<br>
(d)	separating the pellets from culture both by known filtration method such as<br>
herein described to obtain culture fluid,<br>
(e)	Incubating the culture fluid with the substrate as herein described for 1-36 h at<br>
50-60 °C, pH 5 - 6,<br>
(f)	stopping the reaction by keeping reaction mixture as obtained in step e) in<br>
boiling water bath, isolating the product from reaction mixture by known<br>
methods such as herein described.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the inoculum used may be developed from 5 days old slant culture.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the inoculum may be grown for 24-48 h under agitation at 250 rpm.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the inoculum transferred to the femientation medium is preferably -10%.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the culture may be grown in a known manner for a period of 48-120 hrs.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the culture broth may be filtered to separate the pellets from the culture fluid.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the culture fluid may be incubated with sucrose as substrate in a concentration of 400 g/L to 800 g/L.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the incubation period may be from 1-36 h.<br>
In an another embodiment of the present invention the yield of fructooligosaccharides is up to 55 % of the initial sucrose concentration.<br>
The substrate solution (sucrose) was prepared by weighing sucrose (55 g or 80 g) and dissolving it slowly in 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 5.0) and making up the total volume to 100 ml using citrate buffer. The sucrose concentration was measured using a refractometer and found to be 46 ° brix for 550 g/L and 66 ° brix for 800 g/L respectively. Hence, the concentration as indicated by the refractometer was taken as the exact sucrose concentration to calculate the percentage FOS yield.<br>
