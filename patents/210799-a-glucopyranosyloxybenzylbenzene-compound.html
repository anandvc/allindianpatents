Technical FÂ±eld<br>
The present invention relates to glucopyranosyloxybenzylbenzene derivatives and pharmaceutieally acceptable salts thereof which are useful as medicaments, pharmaceutical .compositions comprising the same and intermediates thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
Diabetes is one of lifestyle-related diseases with the background of change of eating habit and lack of exercise. Hence, diet arid exercise therapies are performed in patients with diabetes. Furthermore, when its sufficient control and' continuous performance are difficult, drug treatment is simultaneously performed. Now, biguanides, sulfonylureas and agents for reducing insulin resistance have been employed, as antidiabetic agents. However, biguanides and sulfonylureas show occasionally adverse effects such as lactic acidosis and hypoglysemia, respectively.  In a case of using agents for reducing insulin resistance, adverse effects such as edema1 occasionally are observed, and it is also concerned for advancing obesity. Therefore, in order to solve these problems, it has been desired to develop antidiabetic agents having a new nechanism.<br><br>
In recent years, development of new, type antidiabetic agents has been progressing, which promote urinary glucose excretion and lower blood glucose level by preventing excess glucose reabsorption at the kidney (J. Clin. Invest., Vol.79, pp.1510-1515 (1987)). In addition, it is reported that SGltf^ (NaVglucose cotransporter 2) is present in the SI segment of the kidney's proximal tubule and participates mainly in reabsorption of glucose filtrated through glomerular (J. Clin Invest., Vol.93, pp.397-404 (1994)). Accordingly, inhibiting a human SGLT2 activity prevents reabsorption of excess glucose, at the kidney, subsequently promotes excreting excess glucose though the urine, and normalizes blood glucose level. Therefore, fast development of antidiabetic agents, which have a potent inhibitory activity in human SGLT2 and have a new mechanism, has been desired. Furthermore, since such agents promote the excretion of excess glucose though the urine and consequently the glucose accumulation in the body is decreased, they are also expected to have a preventing effect on obesity.<br>

Assay for inhibitory effect on human SGLT2 activity 1) Construction of the plasmid vector expressing human SGLT2 Preparation of the cDNA library for PCR amplification was performed by reverse transcription of a total RNA deprived from human kidney (Ori gene) with oligo dT as the primer, using SUPERSCRIPT Preamplification System (Gibco-BRL: LIFE TECHNOLOGIES). DNA fragment coding for human SGLT2 was amplified by the Pfu DNA Polymerase (Stratagene)-used PCR reaction, in which the human kidney cDNA library described above was used as the template and the following oligo nucleotides 0702F and 0712R, presented as Sequence Numbers 1 and 2 respectively, were used as the primers. The amplified DNA fragment was ligated into pCR-Blunt (Invitrogen) , a vector for cloning, according to standard method of the kit. The competent cell, Escherichia coll HB101 (Toyobo), was transformed<br><br>
according to usual method and then selection of the transformants was performed on the LB agar medium containing 50 Î¼g/mL of kanamycin. After plasmid DNA was extracted and purified from the one of the transformants, amplifying of the DNA fragment coding for human SGLT2 was performed by the Pfu DNA Polymerase (Stratagene)-used PCR reaction, in which the following oligo nucleotides 0714F and 0715R, presented as Sequence Numbers 3 and 4 respectively, were used as the primers. The amplified DNA fragment was digested with restriction enzymes, Xho I and Hind III, and then purified with Wizard Purification System (Promega) . This purified DNA fragment was inserted at the corresponding restriction enzyme sites of pcDNA3.1 (-) Myc/His-A (Invitrogen), a vector for expressing of fusion protein. The competent cell, Escherichia coli HB101 (Toyobo), was transformed according to usual method and then selection of the transformant was performed on the LB agar<br>
medium containing 100 |xg/mL of ampicillin. After the plasmid DNA was extracted and purified from this transformant, the sequence of the DNA fragment inserted at the multi-cloning sites of the vector, pcDNA3 .1 (-) Myc/His-A, was analyzed. This clone had a single base substitution (ATC which codes for the isoleucine-433 was substituted by GTC) compared with the human SGLT2 reported by Wells et al (Am. J. Physiol., Vol. 263, pp. 459-465 (1992)). Sequentially, a clone in which valine is substituted for isoleucine-433 was obtained.

3) Measurement of the inhibitory activity against the uptake of methyl-a-D-glucopyranoside<br>
After removal of the medium of the COS-7 cells expressing transiently human SGLT2 , to each well 200 ^L of the pretreatment buffer (a pH 7.4 buffer containing 140 mM choline chloride, 2 mM potassium chloride, 1 mM calcium chloride, 1 mM magnesium chloride, 10 mM 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethane sulfonic acid and 5 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane) was added and the cells were incubated 37C for 10 minutes. The pretreatment buffer was removed and 200 Î¼L of the same buffer was added again, and then the cells were incubated 37Â°C for 10 minutes. Seven \jiL of methyl-a-D-(U-14C)glucopyranoside (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to 525 ^L of the buffer for uptake containing test sample (a pH 7.4 buffer containing 140 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM potassium chloride, 1 mM calcium chloride, 1 mM magnesium chloride, 5 mM methyl-a-D-glucopyranoside, 10 mM 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethane sulfonic acid and 5 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane), and this mixture was mixed, and then the buffer for measurement of uptake was prepared. For the control, the buffer for measurement of uptake without test compound was prepared. For estimate of the basal uptake in the absence of test compound and sodium, the buffer for measurement of the basal uptake, which contains 140 mM choline chloride in place of sodium chloride, was prepared similarly. After the pretreatment buffer was removed, 75 Î¼L of the buffer for measurement of uptake was added to each well, the cells were incubated at 37"C for<br><br>
2 hours . After the buffer for measurement of uptake was removed, 200 ^L of the washing buffer (a pH 7.4 buffer containing 140 mM choline chloride, 2 mM potassium chloride, 1 mM calcium chloride, 1 mM magnesium chloride, 10 mM methyl-a-D-gluco-pyranoside, 10 mM 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethane sulfonic acid and 5 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane) was added to each well and immediately removed. After two additional washing, the cells were solubilized by addition of 75 jiL of 0.2 N sodium hydroxide to each well. After the cell lysates were transferred to the PicoPlate (Packard) and 150 \iL of MicroScint-40 (Packard) was added to each well, the radioactivity was measured with microplate scintillation counter TopCount (Packard). The difference in uptake was obtained as 100 % value by subtracting the radioactivity in the basal uptake from that in control and then the concentrations at which 50 % of uptake were inhibited (IC50 value) were calculated from the concentration-inhibition curve by least square method. The results are shown in the following Table [Table 1]<br>
