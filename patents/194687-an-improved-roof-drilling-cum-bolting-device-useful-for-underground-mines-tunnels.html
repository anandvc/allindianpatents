				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This  invention  relates to an improved  roof  drilling  cum bolting device.useful in underground mines/ funnele The device is useful in underground mines/tunne1s<br>
In underground mines/tunne1s roof supporting is an important factor for . the stability of tunne1s/roadways. the underground openings are supported passively by vertical supports of different kinds. The other ways of supporting the mine roofs presently . being adopted widely is the active support by roof bolting. By bolting the roofs with cemented bolts, the inherent strength of the rock i3 enhanced by the way of compacting the beam of stratified layers.<br>
Generally roof is drilled upto 1.5m or so, as per requirement. Then a steel rod or rope is induced inside the hole along-with cement slurry or like, such that the drill hole is compactly filled by the rod and cement. Thus roof bolting operation takes place.<br>
Now the problem is that though it is recommended widely to use this system of supporting with roof bolts, there is difficulty in drilling holes in the roofs by conventional drilling machines used in the mines, the main factors causing difficulty are:<br>
(1)  The drilling has  to be made at a height generally   2m  to 3.2  m  or more, where holding the drilling machine  manually  is<br>
very difficult to make vertically up holes. <br>
(2) The machine has to be strong enough to withstand the  impact<br>
of hard rock of drilling roof alongwith suitable   pushing force.<br><br>
The  drilling  operation by manual power  with  conventional machine is impossible, because it is very time taking: and unsafe. Therefore  some hydraulical1y operated machine  or  pneumatically operated  machines came into market but those are not  also  successful  because of following difficulty - 1) not  easily  transportable in the working areas, 2) efficiency of hydraulic machine deteriorates  rapidly with leakage and low pressure  problem,  3) pneumatic  machine  has  to have pressure Supply  line  from  the surface,  thus the working pressure reduces and above all,  pneumatic compressors are not- available is most of coal mines.  There is also restriction in using compressors in underground mines.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for a suitable drilling/bolting machine which has to be compact and easily transportable, effective in drilling' with availab1e power supply, operat ion and maintenance should be easy and above all, it must, be economically viable to the Indian mines.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an improved roof drilling cum bolting device useful for,; underground mines/tunne1s.<br>
Another object is to provide a roof drilling/bolting device which is compact, easily transportable, robust, adjustable to different height, simple in operation and maintenance as well as economically viable to the Indian mines.<br>
Figure 1 of the drawings accompanying this specification, shows the schematic diagram of the  equipment. The various compo-<br><br>
nents are (1) crown of the prop jack, (2) means to hold the drilling unit with the prop jack, (3) top tube of the prop jack, (4) bottom tube of the prop jack, (5) means to hold the drilling unit with the prop jack, (6,7,8,9) associate telescopic arrangement for holding the drilling unit at any position, (10) base of the prop jack, (11) pusher ram for drilling unit, (12) drilling unit (13) rotary control valve fro power pack, (14) electrical power plug for drilling unit, (15) drill rod, (16) control for electrical suppy to drilling unit, (17) power pack.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved roof drilling cum boiting device useful for underground mines / tunnels, which comprises a telescopic hydraulic prop jack (1&amp;3 &amp;4), rigidly mounted on a base frame (10), characterised in that another mechanical telescopic tube arrangement (6,7) being fixed with the said hydraulic prop jack at top and bottom by connectors (2 and 5), an electrically motorised drilling unit (12) fitted over a hydraulic pusher ram (11) being attached to the said mechanical telescopic tube arrangement (6,7) by connectors (8 and 9), the said drilling unit (12) having holder to mount a drill rod (15) over it, the said hydraulic prop jack (3,4) and the said hydraulic pusher ram (11) being connected by hydraulic hoses with a power pack (17) and the drilling unit being connected to an electrical power supply through power plug (14) &amp; control of electric power(16).<br>
the present invention will incorporate an improvement in the in the roof drilling and bolting process in underground mines/tunnels, which could significantly free the system from manual components, thereby increasing its efficiency, effectiveness and will be much safer working at the same time.<br><br>
The present invention is an equipment easily transportable by manual labour in underground mines as two different units_ Drilling unit and power pack unit, for a certain distance, the power pack does not need movement the local moments can be accommodated by the long connecting hydraulic hoses.<br>
The' drilling unit is brought to the site where the  bolting, is  to be done. Firstly, the power pack is run to lift the  telescopic prop jack upto the roof. When the crown (1) is fixed  with the roof with a certain setting load the valve is locked. At  the same time the associate telescopic tube is extended near to roof.<br>
The valve for supplying power to the hydraulic pusher ram (11) is open to lift the drilling unit upheld to the required height and this valve switch is kept on during; the drilling operation with a certain pressure controlled by automatic control switches (unloader valves).<br>
The drilling unit has a socket for electrical power supply (14) and it is operated through a control switch (16) at the hand of the operator. The operator may be near to the drilling unit or at a distance from the machine as the electrical control switch may be taken away at a safer distance like the power pack ( 17 ) .<br>
After the holes are made in the roof these are filled with cement slurry or by cement capsules and then bolts! are pushed in the holes. The roof bolting machine helps in pushing the bolts in the holes by means of its hydraulic pusher jack.<br><br>
The  main advantages of the equipment of the present  invention :<br>
1.	It can be easily transported in underground.<br>
2.	It improves the speed of drilling and bolting .<br>
3.	It provides support to the roof and increases safety of the workers.<br>
4.	It is easy to operate, running cost is less.<br>
5.	It is easily repairable and list cost for maintenance.<br>
6.	It is capable drill hole in hard rocks without manual hardship.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	An improved roof drilling cum boiting device useful for underground mines / tunnels, which comprises a telescopic hydraulic prop jack (1&amp;.3 &amp;4), rigidly mounted on a base frame (10), characterised in that another mechanical telescopic tube arrangement (6,7) being fixed with the said hydraulic prop jack at top and bottom by connectors (2 and 5), an electrically motorised drilling unit (12) fitted over a hydraulic pusher ram (11) being attached to the said mechanical telescopic tube arrangement (6,7) by connectors (8 and 9), the said drilling unit (12) having holder to mount a drill rod (15) over it, the said hydraulic prop jack; (3,4) and the said hydraulic pusher ram (11) being connected by hydraulic hoses with a power pack (17) and the drilling unit being connected to an electrical power supply through power plug (14) &amp; control of electric power(16).<br>
