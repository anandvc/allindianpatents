				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved multi - directional stand useful for a portable burner system. This invention particularly relates to improvement in the portable burner system which can be adjusted so as to produce flame along any direction, at any point, situated at any height, in any plane in space with precision and easily.<br>
The portable industrial burners are usually used to heat a particular portion of casting such that the axis of flame is perpendicular to the surface of casting to be heated. Otherwise heating rate will be lower with the same fuel consumption leading to fuel wastage.<br>
In the presently available portable industrial burners, (hereafter referred as conventional PI burners) vertical height of burner is adjusted by sliding the burner mounting pipe in side vertical pipe of tripod stand and then position of burner is fixed by thrusting the holding screw into holes provided in the mounting pipe and vertical pipe of tripod stand. The vertical height of burner can be varied in steps, each step equals to distance between two consecutive holes provided in vertical mounting pipe of burner. While thrusting the screw in the holes, there is a danger of burner mounting pipe falling, leading to accident. Thus the burner can not be raised or lowered accurately by any distance smaller than that between two consecutive holes.<br>
Change of burner in a particular horizontal plane can be brought about only by rotating the stand about its vertical axis, thereby disturbing the equilibrium of entire installation leading to accident involving safety hazards. In conventional PI burner, only one swivel mechanism is provided with the help of which burner can be rotated in a vertical plane only.Thus in one vertical plane, burner can be adjusted in one position only to get flame in a particular direction (say horizontal) where as while heating defective castings PI burner is required to produce flame in all possible directions depending upon geometry and location of surface to be heated.<br>
To the best of our knowledge, there is no multi - directional stand available which fulfills the need of portable industrial burners being used in for specialised applications such as precision localised heating.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved multi - directional stand useful for portable burner systems, which obviates the draw backs as mentioned above.<br>
Another object of the invention is to achieve proper heating of surface of castings and forgings by providing flame in suitable direction with respect to the surface to be heated.<br>
In fig. 1 of the drawing accompanying this specification a schematic diagram of the improved multi - directional stand of the present invention is depicted. The various parts are tripod stand 1, vertical raising system 2, horizontal swivel disc 3. vertical swivel disc 4, lever 6, second vertical swivel disc 5, burner 7 having oil inlet pipe 7 a and air inlet pipe 7b and second horizontal swivel disc 8.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved multi -directional stand useful for portable burner system which comprises, a<br>
1 supporting base stand having a vertical section (1), the said vertical section (1) having fixed to its top end a means (2) capable of providing vertical movement on the top end of the said vertical movement means (2) being provided one or more movably fixed horizontal swivel means (3), one or<br>
. more vertical movably fixed swivel means (4) being provided on to the top of the said horizontal swivel means (3), the said vertical swivel means (4) being provided at its top with a movably fixed lever (6), at one end of the said lever (6) being provided one or more means (8,5) capable of providing horizontal (8) and vertical (5) movements respectively, the said vertical swivel means (5) being provided with fixation means capable of supporting a burner (7)<br>
In a feature of the present invention, the vertical movement means used may be such as rack and penion system, hydraulic system, sliding pipe in pipe, screw jack.<br>
By fixing a industrial burner such as desired and claimed in our patent numbers 156126, GB 2161915 to the improved multi - directional stand of the present invention to obtain a portable burner system, we have observed that<br>
1.	If the flame is directed perpendicular to the surface to be heated, heat transfer rate is the highest.<br>
2.	Higher heat transfer rate from flame to the surface to be heated leads to higher thermal efficiency and thus fuel saving.<br>
3.	Higher thermal efficiency can be achieved by directing the flame suitably on the surface to be heated.<br>
4.	If a swivel mechanism is used in the horizontal plane it helps in setting the position of burner   in   any direction in the same horizontal plane.<br>
5.	More than one swivel mechanism helps to adjust the burner as to get the flame at any angle in the space.<br>
6.	If more than one swivel mechanisms in horizontal and vertical are employed, setting of burner in any direction at any point becomes easier and more accurate.<br>
7.	If combination of horizontal or vertical swivel mechanisms is used, setting of burner at any point in space, in any desired direction, becomes easier and reduces chances of falling of burner installation.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, if a burner with the improved stand is mounted on a trolley wheels, portability is enhanced and chances of falling and accident while shifting the burner system are eliminated completely.<br>
In other embodiments of the improved multi - directional stand of the present invention : a) In screw and jack arrangement, effort force required to lift a weight is given by expression W1/2D where 1 is lead of thread, D is distance between two parallel forces constituting a couple and being applied on the wheel at the center of which is located a threaded nut.<br>
b)	By selecting small lead/pitch and large arm of the applied couple in screw - jack arrangement, effort force required to lift a weight can be considerably reduced.<br>
c)	After the load is raised or lowered with the help of screw jack mechanism, the load remains in position and there are no chances of its falling of its own.<br>
d)	Raising of a weight with the help of hydraulicaliy operated mechanism is smoother than in mechanical system based upon screw jack or rack and pinion principle.<br>
e)	Foot operated hydraulic or pneumatic pumping system used in weight raising mechanism are more convenient and less tiresome than hand operated screw - jack or rack and pinion   mechanism.<br>
A burner     fitted  on to  the improved stand of the<br>
present invention may be operated as follows :<br>
The burner is lighted with the help of lighter oil and combustion air is admitted into it. The height of burner flame is adjusted by rotating the vertical threaded spindle in a threaded pipe. With the help of horizontal swivel disc the burner is rotated in horizontal position to bring it near the surface/article to be heated.<br>
Then with the help of vertical swivel disc, which is located on the horizontal swivel disc, the burner is rotated in vertical plane so as to bring the flame precisely quite near to the surface to be heated. In this position it is just possible that the flame axis may not be perpendicular to the plane of surface. With the help of second vertical swivel disc which is located very near the burner, the burner is rotated in vertical plane so as to bring the axis of flame perpendicular to the surface to be heated.<br>
The following are the advantages of the improved multi - directional stand used in conjuction with a burner as a portable burner system :<br>
1.	The PI burner system can very easily be shifted from one site to another by pulling the trolley.<br>
2.	Each of the burner setting height, rotation in horizontal plane, rotation in vertical plane and then adjustment of burner axis in a desired direction are possible to be achieved independently without disturbing    the other.<br>
3.	The force required to shift the burner system and to do positional adjustments is so small that even one person can shift, adjust and operate the burner. The force required to lift the new portable burner system is nearly one third that of conventional portable burner system.<br>
4.	Some adjustment in the position/direction of burner are possible to be done after the burner has been ignited.<br>
5.	Different  modes  of heating - slow, medium,   high   are   possible.<br>
6.	Burner setting with more precision is possible.<br>
7.	Leads to higher thermal efficiency and saving of fuel.<br>
8.	Chances of accidents by overturning during making adjustments have been eliminated.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim :<br>
1.
