COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10; rule 13)<br>
(1) TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
A METHOD FOR REDUCING COLOUR LOSS FROM HAIR TREATED WITH AN OXIDATIVE HAIR DYE<br>
(2) HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165-166 Backbay Reclamation, Murnbai 400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a method of reducing colour loss from hair, treated.with an oxidative composition, such as an oxidatives hair dye, using certain selected organic amino , compounds.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The most commonly used method of dyeing hair, particularly human hair, is oxidative dyeing in which a mixture of aromatic compounds, generally of the benzenoid series, which are themselves colourless, are converted by coupling reactions to a blend of coloured compounds within the hair fibers by oxidative processes. The colourless aromatic compounds, in a suitable base formulation, are normally mixed with hydrogen peroxide or other strong oxidizing agent shortly before use The coloured compounds or dyes are, typically, formed by oxidative -coupling between primary intermediates (usually diamine benzenes, or amino phenols) and. couplers which, are phenols or. related cyclic .compounds. Various shades are developed by using a mixture containing more than one of both the intermediate and the coupler.<br>
The intermediates and couplers because of their low<br>
molecular weights and water solubility diffuse easily into the hair where the coupling reaction takes place. The coloured products developed by oxidation, however, remain trapped in the hair by virtue of their higher molecular weights, relative insolubility in water and absorptive affinity to the internal hair surface.<br><br>
Although permanence-is the objective of such oxidative dyeing methods, in practice it is difficult to achieve. The colour tends to fade over time and a contributory factor in fading is lack of wash-fastness. This means that the colour tends to leach out of the hair after repeated washing. This leads to gradual fading or changing of the applied colour. The action of other factors such as ultraviolet light, combing and perspiration- also affects the colour.<br>
We. have now found that certain selected organic amino compounds:, in particular, arginine and urea, are effective for reducing colour loss from hair previously or subsequently treated with an oxidising agent such as an oxidative hair dye.<br>
US 3,861,868 describes an oxidation dye composition comprising arginine or a protein or polypeptide having a high arginine content, and theorises that the arginine or proteins enhance the penetration of the dye precursors into the hair shaft, thereby stabilizing the dye molecules formed by oxidation.<br>
In the above case the arginine or proteins are an integral component of the: dye composition itself. In contrast, the present invention provides a method in which the selected organic amino compounds are incorporated into a conventional hair treatment composition such as a shampoo or conditioner to be applied in a separate stage to the oxidative composition. Advantageously, such a shampoo or conditioner can be applied repeatedly to give a beneficial progressive build-up of. the colour protection effect, independently of the oxidative composition, for which repeated use would be damaging to the hair.<br><br>
Summary of the  Invention<br>
The present  invention provides a method for reducing colour loss from hair treated with an oxidative  composition,   such as an oxidative hair dye,   the method comprising  the step of contacting the hair,   either prior to or after treatment  of the hair with the  oxidative  composition,   with a  colour protective composition comprising an organic- amino' compound selected from: ',<br>
(i)   basic amino acids;<br>
(ii)   urea;<br>
(iii)   guanidine;<br>
(iv)   salts and/or derivatives  of  any of   (i)   to   (iii) ;<br>
(v)   mixtures  of   any of   (i)   to   (iv) .<br>
Detailed Description of  the  Invention<br>
According to the method of  the present  invention,   hair is contacted,with a  colour protective  composition comprising. certain selected  organic  amino  compounds  as   described  above, either prior to,   or after  treatment   of   the  hair with an oxidative  composition.<br>
Preferably the colour protective  composition  is  applied after treatment  of   the  hair  with   the   oxidative   composition.<br><br>
Oxidative Composition<br>
By "treatment with an oxidative composition" is meant contacting the hair with an oxidative composition such as an oxidative hair dye.<br>
The composition employed may be formed separately from the hair and'then appliedi It may also be formed' by mixing the-separate reactants as they are applied to the hair, for example by mixing the streams from separate aerosol<br>
containers as the streams, are. applied Co the hair. It may also be formed by contacting the reactants with the hair to be treated as the reactants are applied to the hair, either concurrently or successively.<br>
The term "oxidative dye" includes compounds and mixtures of compounds which can be oxidised under the treatment conditions described above to form hair colourants. It includes, for example, primary intermediates either alone or together with one or more couplers, autoxidative dyes, and melanin forming dyes such as DHI and its analogues. Hydrogen Deroxide is: the  usual oxidising agent employed in conjunction with oxidative dyes. Other oxidizing agents for use in this context include perborates, persulfates and perhalites, particularly periodates. These oxidising agents are generally employed as ammonium salts or as salts of alkali metals.<br>
Colour Protective Composition<br>
The colour protective composition comprises an organic amino compound selected from:<br>
(i) basic amino acids;<br><br>
(ii) urea;<br>
(iii) guanidine;<br>
(iv) salts and/or derivatives of any of (i) to (iii) ; (v) mixtures of any of (i) to (iv). Basic Amino Acids .<br>
Basic amino acids (i) may be selected from lysine, arginine<br>
and histidine and mixtures thereof- These amino acids are hydrophilic due to their polar side chains. Lysine and arginine are positively charged at neutral pH, whereas histidine can be uncharged or positively charged depending on its local environment.<br>
Arginine is the most preferred amino acid (i) in the method according to the invention.<br>
The basic amino acids having a basic amino acid content of 50%, or greater, are often isolated from natural sources in the form of salts and hydrosalts, which, are also, suitable for use according to the invention. Such salts and hydrosalts are formed by reaction with mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, carbonic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and the like, or the organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, lauric acid, chloroacetic acid and the like. A suitable example is arginine hydrochloride.<br>
An example of a suitable natural extract which is rich in arginine is aloe vera extract.<br><br>
Guanidine. (iii) may also be present as a salts or hydrosalts<br>
formed by reaction with mineral or organic acids as described above. A suitable example is guanidine hydrochloride.<br>
The most preferred organic amino compounds in the method according to the invention are arginine and urea and their respective salts and/or hydrosalts.<br>
Mixtures of any of'the above organic amino coinpounds may also be used.<br><br>
The total  amount  of  organic amino compound may suitably range from 0.01%  to 10% by weight based on total  weight of  the hair treatment  composition in which it  is employed.   Preferably, the amount of organic amino compound ranges  from 0.02  to 5% by weight based on total  weight,   and will  ideally range from 0.05%  to  2% by weight based on total weight.<br>
Product  Form <br>
Colour; protective compositions according to  the  invention may suitably take the  form of  shampoos.,   conditioners., sprays,   mousses,   gels,   cremes or lotions.   Preferred  forms are  shampoos and conditioners.<br>
Advantageously,   the  colour protective composition comprising an organic amino compound for use in the method according to the  invention can be  formulated as a shampoo  and will  then accordingly comprise  one  or more cleansing  surfactants which are  cosmetically  acceptable  and suitable   for  topical application to the hair.<br>
Suitable cleansing, surfactants:, which may be used singularly or in combination, are selected from anionic, amphoteric and zwitterionic surfactants,   and mixtures  thereof.<br>
Examples   of  anionic  surfactants  are  the  alkyl   sulphates, alkyl   ether sulphates,   alkaryl  sulphonates,   alkanoyl isethionates,   alkyl  succinates,   alkyl  sulphosuccinates,   N-alkyl   sarcosinates,   alkyl  phosphates,   alkyl  ether phosphates, alkyl  ether carboxylates,   and alpha-olefin sulphonates, especially their sodium,   magnesium,   ammonium and mono-,   di-and  triethanolamine  salts.     The alkyl   and  acyl   groups generally contain from 8   to  18 carbon atoms  and may be unsaturated.     The  alkyl   ether sulphates,   alkyl   ether<br><br>

Preferred amphoteric and zwitterionic surfactants include lauryl amine oxide, cocodimethyl sulphopropyl betaine and preferably lauryl betaine, cocamidopropyl betaine and sodium cocamphopropionate.<br>
The cleansing surfactant(s) may be present in shampoo compositions for use according to the invention in a total amount of from about 1 to about 4 0% by weight based on the total weight of the shampoo composition, preferably from about 2 to about 30% by weight, optimally from about 10% to 3 0% by weight.<br>
Shampoos for use according to the invention can also include nonionic surfactants to help impart aesthetic, physical or cleansing properties to the composition.  The nonionic<br><br>
surfactant can be  included in an amount  ranging from 0%  to about 5% by weight based on total  weight.<br>
For example,   representative nonionic  surfactants  include condensation products of aliphatic-  (C8   -  C18)   primary or secondary linear or branched chain alcohols or phenols with alkylene oxides,   usually ethylene  oxide  and generally having from 6 to 30  ethylene oxide groups.<br>
Other representative nonionics  include  mono-  or di-alkyl alkariolamides.'    Examples  include'coco mono-  or-di— ethanolamide  and  coco mono-isopropanolamide.<br>
Further nonionic  surfactants which  can be  included are  the alkylpolyglycosides   (APGs) .     Typically,   the APG  is  one which comprises an alkyl group connected   (optionally via a bridging group)   to a block of one or more glycosyl groups.     Preferred APGs  are defined by the  following  formula:<br>
RO   -    (G)n<br>
wherein R is  a branched" or  straight  chain alkyl  group which may be saturated 'or unsaturated and G  is  a  saccharide group.<br>
R may suitably represent  a mean alkyl  chain length of  from about  C5  to  about  C20.     Preferably  R  represents  a  mean  alkyl chain length of  from about  C8  to about  C12.     Most preferably the value of  R  lies between  about   9.5   and about   10.5.     G  may be selected  from C5 or C6 monosaccharide  residues,   and is preferably a glucoside.     G may be  selected from the group comprising glucose,   xylose,   lactose,   fructose,   mannose  and derivatives  thereof.     Preferably G   is  glucose.<br>
The  degree  of  polymerisation,   n,   may have  a value  of   from about  1  to about  10 or more.     Preferably,   the value of n  lies<br><br>
in the range of from about 1.1 to about 2.  Most preferably the value of. n.. lies -in the range of from about 1.3 to about<br>
1.5.<br>
Suitable alkyl polyglycosides are' commercially available and include for example those materials identified as:  Oramix NS10 ex Seppic; Plantaren 1200 and Plantaren 2000 ex Henkel.<br>
Likewise shampoos for use according to the invention can include other emulsifiers, conditioning agents, inorganic salts, humect.ants and similar; materials to provide the composition with desirable aesthetic or physical properties.<br>
Representative conditioning agents include silicones. Silicones are particularly preferred conditioning agents for hair.  Representative silicones include volatile and non¬volatile silicones, such as for example polyalkylsiloxanes (optionally end-capped with one or more hydroxyl groups), polyalkylaryl siloxanes, siloxane gums and resins, cyclomethicones, aminofunctional silicones, quaternary silicones and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferred silicones include- polydimethylsiloxanes (of CTFA designation dimethicone), siloxane gums, aminofunctional silicones (of CTFA designation amodimethicone) and hydroxylated polydimethylsiloxanes (of CTFA designation dimethiconol).<br>
Various methods of making emulsions of particles of<br>
silicones are available and are well known and documented in the art.<br>
Suitable silicone emulsions are commercially available in a pre-emulsified form. This is particularly preferred since<br><br>
the pre-formed emulsion can be incorporated into the shampoo composition by simple mixing.<br>
Examples of suitable pre-formed emulsions include emulsions DC2-1310, DC2-1865, DC2-1870, DC2-1766 and DC2-1784, available from Dow Corning. These are emulsions of dimethiconol. Siloxane gums are also available in a pre-emulsifaed form, which is advantageous for- ease, of formulation. A preferred example is the material available from Dow Corning as DC X2-1787, which is an emulsion of cross-linked dimethiconol, gum..<br>
The amount of silicone incorporated into compositions for use according to the invention depends on the level of conditioning desired and the material used.  A preferred amount is from 0.01 to about 10% by weight of the total composition although these limits are not absolute.  The lower limit is determined by the minimum level to achieve conditioning and the upper limit by the maximum level to avoid making the hair and/or skin unacceptably greasy.  We have found that an amount of silicone of from 0.5 to 1.5% by weight of the. total composition, is a particularly suitable level.<br>
A further preferred class of conditioning agents are per-alk(en)yl hydrocarbon materials, used to enhance the body, volume and stylability of hair.<br>
EP 567 326 and EP 498 119 describe suitable peralk(en)yl hydrocarbon materials for imparting stylability and enhanced body to hair. Preferred materials are polyisobutylene<br>
materials available from Presperse, Inc. under the PERMETKYL trade name.<br><br>
The amount of per-alk(en)yl hydrocarbon material incorporated into compositions for use according to the invention depends on the level of body and volume enhancement desired and the specific material used.  A preferred amount is from 0.01 to about 10% by weight of the total composition although these limits are not absolute. The lower limit is determined by the minimum level to achieve the body and volume enhancing effect and the; upper limit by the maximum level to avoid making the hair unacceptably stiff. We have found that an amount of per-alk(en)yl hydrocarbon material: of from. 0.5 to 2% by weight of the total composition is a particularly suitable level.<br>
Shampoo compositions for use according to the invention may also include a polymeric cationic conditioning compound that is substantive to the hair and imparts conditioning properties to the hair.<br>
The polymeric cationic conditioning compound will generally be present at levels of from 0.01 to 5%, preferably from about 0.05 to 1%, more preferably from about 0.08% to about 0.5% by weight.  Synthetic or naturally derived polymers having a quaternised nitrogen atom are useful.  The molecular weight of the polymer will generally be between 5 000 and 10 000 000, typically at least 10 000 and preferably in the range 100 000 to about 2 000 000.<br>
Representative synthetic quaternised polymers include, for example: cationic copolymers of 1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidine and 1-vinyl-3-methyl-imidazolium salt (e.g., Chloride salt) (referred to in the industry by the Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association, "CTFA". as Polyquaternium-16)  copolymers of 1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidine and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (referred to in the industry by CTFA as Polyquaternium-11); cationic diallyl quaternary ammonium-<br><br>
containing polymers including, for example,<br>
dimethyldiallylammonium chloride homopolymer (referred to in the industry (CTFA) as Polyguaternium 6) ; mineral acid salts of amino-alkyl esters of homo-and co-polymers of unsaturated carboxylic acids having from 3 to '5 carbon atoms, as described in U.S. Patent 4,009,256; and cationic polyacrylamides as described in W095/22311.<br>
Representative naturally-derived quaternised polymers include quaternised -cellulosic compounds and cationic guar gum derivatives, such as. guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride.. Examples are JAGUAR C-13S, JAGUAR C-15, and JAGUAR-C17, commercially available from Meyhall in their JAGUAR trademark series.<br>
Compositions for use in accordance with the invention may also be formulated as a hair conditioner for the treatment of hair (typically after shampooing) and subsequent rinsing.<br>
Such formulations will then accordingly comprise one or more conditioning surfactants which are cosmetically acceptable and suitable for topical application to the hair.<br>
Suitable conditioning-:surfactants are selected from cationic: surfactants, used singly or in admixture.  Examples include quaternary.ammonium hydroxides or salts thereof, e.g chlorides.<br>
Suitable cationic surfactants include cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, behenyltrimethylammonium chloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, tetramethylammonium chloride, tetraethyiammonium chloride, octyltrimethylammonium chloride,<br>
dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride, hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride, octyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride, decyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride, stearyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride,<br><br>
di dodecyl dime thy lammoni urn chloride,'<br>
dioctadecyldimethylammonium chloride,   tallowtrimethylammonium chloride,   cocotrimethylammonium chloride,   and the corresponding hydroxides  thereof.   Further suitable cationic surfactants  include  those materials having the CTFA designations Quaternium-5,   Quaternium-31  and Quaternium-18. Mixtures of  any of  the   foregoing materials may also be suitable.     A particularly'useful -cation-re- surfactant  for use in hair conditioners of  the  invention is<br>
cetyltrimethylammonium chloride,   available  commercially,   for example  as  GENAM1N CTAC,   ex Hoechst  Celanese.<br>
In- hair conditioners   for use  according  to  the  invention,   the level of cationic  surfactant   is preferably  from  0.01  to 10%, more preferably 0.05  to  5%,   most preferably 0.1   to 2% by weight of  the composition.<br>
Conditioners  for use according to the  invention<br>
advantageously incorporate  a  fatty alcohol  material.     The combined use  of  fatty alcohol  materials  and cationic surfactants  in conditioning  compositions  is  believed to be especially advantageous,   because  this  leads  to the  formation of  a lamellar phase,   in which the  cationic  surfactant  is dispersed.<br>
Representative  fatty alcohols  comprise  from 8   to  22  carbon atoms,   more preferably   16   to  20.     Examples  of  suitable  fatty<br>
alcohols   include   cetyl   alcohol,   stearyl   alcohol   and mixtures thereof.<br>
The  level  of  fatty alcohol  materials  is  conveniently from 0.01  to 10%,   preferably  from 0.1  to 5% by weight  of  the composition.     The weight  ratio of  cationic  surfactant  to fatty alcohol  is  suitably from 10:1  to  1:10,   preferably from 4:1  to  1:8,   optimally  from  1:1  to  1:4.<br><br>
Conditioners for use according to the invention can include other emulsifiers, conditioning agents, inorganic salts, humectants and similar materials to provide the composition with desirable aesthetic or physical properties.  Silicones, as described above for shampoo compositions, are particularly preferred conditioning agents for hair.<br>
As.further optional, components for inclusion- in shampoo or conditioner compositions for use according to the invention, in addition to water, may be mentioned the following<br>
conventional adjunct materials known for use in cosmetic compositions: suspending agents, thickeners, pearlescing agents, opacifiers, salts, perfumes, buffering agents, colouring agents, emollients, moisturisers, foam stabilisers, sunscreen materials, antimicrobial agents, preservatives, antioxidants, natural oils and extracts, propellants.<br>
The invention will now be further illustrated by the<br>
following, non-limiting Examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Examples 1. to 3.<br>
The following formulations were prepared. Examples 1 to 3 are Examples according to the invention. Comp.Ex. A and Comp.Ex. B are comparative examples.<br><br><br>
The above formulations were tested as follows. For each test formulation, a hair switch was split into two, and one half twice bleached. The other half was twice bleached and coloured permanently. LAB chroma values were measured on a Hunterlab and the difference in coloured AE was calculated between bleached and bleached and coloured half switches. The switches were washed for up to 3 0 minutes in the test formulation and the percentage of decrease of colour difference between the coloured half switch and non coloured half switch due to colour loss  was  calculated. Four replicates were used per test formulation.<br>
All of the test switches treated with the formulations of Examples 1 to 3 showed a perceptible decrease in colour loss after washing, compared with those treated with either of the Comp.Ex.A or Comp.Ex.B formulations.<br><br>
