				<td>ENZYME AND PHOTOBLEACH CONTAINING COMPOSITIONS<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION This invention relates to compositions comprising lipases and photobleaches and processes for making and using such products.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The appearance of lipase enzymes suitable for detergent applications gave the formulator a new approach to improve grease removal. Such enzymes catalyse the hydrolysis of triglycerides which form a major component of many commonly encountered fatty soils such as sebum, animal fats (e.g. lard, ghee, butter) and vegetable oils (e.g. olive oil, sunflower oil, peanut oil). However these enzymes typically showed weak performance in the first wash cycle and<br>
H<br>
typically came with a malodor arising, it is believed, from hydrolysis of fats present in dairy soils like milks, cream, butter and yogurt. While not being bound by theory, it is believed that such soils are prone to lipase-induced malodor generation as they contain triglycerides functionalized with short chain (e.g. C4) fatty acyl units which release malodorous volatile fatty acids after lipolysis. Even the when the performance of such enzymes was improved, the malodor issue remained. Thus, the use of this technology was severely limited.<br>
We have found that the combination of a photobleach with certain lipase variants gives rise to an improved cleaning performance benefit, while minimising unacceptable malodor. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the following mechanisms are likely to give rise to such benefits: improved stain removal of stains comprising carotenoid, anthocyanines, porphyrins, tannins and flavines materials, for example, curry, pepper sauce, tomato-based pasta sauces, coffee and tea, due to synergistic action between the lipase and photobleach; and the oxidation of the lipase enzyme, by the photobleach, post-wash, for example during the drying of the cleaned or treated situs thus leading to reduced malodor.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to compositions comprising lipases and photobleaches and processes for making and using such products.<br>

Enzyme Stabilizers - Enzymes for use in detergents can be stabilized by various techniques. The enzymes employed herein can be stabilized by the presence of water-soluble sources of calcium and/or magnesium ions in the finished compositions that provide such ions to the enzymes. In case of aqueous compositions comprising protease, a reversible protease inhibitor, such as a boron compound, can be added to further improve stability.<br>
Catalytic Metal Complexes — Applicants' cleaning compositions may include catalytic metal complexes. One type of metal-containing bleach catalyst is a catalyst system comprising a transition metal cation of defined bleach catalytic activity, such as copper, iron, titanium, ruthenium, tungsten, molybdenum, or manganese cations, an auxiliary metal cation having little<br>
or no bleach catalytic activity, such as zinc or aluminum cations, and a sequestrate having defined stability constants for the catalytic and auxiliary metal cations, particularly ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, ethylenediaminetetra(methylenephosphonic acid) and water-soluble salts thereof. Such catalysts are disclosed in U.S. 4,430,243.<br>
If desired, the compositions herein can be catalyzed by means of a manganese compound. Such compounds and levels of use are well known in the art and include, for example, the manganese-based catalysts disclosed in U.S. 5,576,282.<br>
Cobalt bleach catalysts useful herein are known, and are described, for example, in U.S. 5,597,936; U.S. 5,595,967. Such cobalt catalysts are readily prepared by known procedures, such as taught for example in U.S. 5,597,936, and U.S. 5,595,967.<br>
Compositions herein may also suitably include a transition metal complex of Iigands such as bispidones (WO 05/042532 Al) and/or macropolycyclic rigid Iigands - abbreviated as "MRLs". As a practical matter, and not by way of limitation, the compositions and processes herein can be adjusted to provide on the order of at least one part per hundred million of the active MRL species in the aqueous washing medium, and will typically provide from about 0.005 ppm to about 25 ppm, from about 0.05 ppm to about 10 ppm, or even from about 0.1 ppm to about 5 ppm, of the MRL in the wash liquor.<br>
Suitable transition-metals in the instant transition-metal bleach catalyst include, for example, manganese, iron and chromium. Suitable MRLs include 5,12-diethyl-l,5,8,12-tetraazabicyclo[6.6.2]hexadecane.<br>
Suitable transition metal MRLs are readily prepared by known procedures, such as taught for example in WO 00/32601, and U.S. 6,225,464.<br>
Solvents - Suitable solvents include water and other solvents such as lipophilic fluids. Examples of suitable lipophilic fluids include siloxanes, other silicones, hydrocarbons, glycol ethers, glycerine derivatives such as glycerine ethers,, perfluorinated amines, perfluorinated and hydrofluoroether solvents, low-volatility nonfluorinated organic solvents, diol solvents, other environmentally-friendly solvents and mixtures thereof.<br>

Method of Use<br>
The present invention includes a method for cleaning and /or treating a situs inter alia a surface or fabric. Such method includes the steps of contacting an embodiment of Applicants' cleaning composition, in neat form or diluted in a wash liquor, with at least a portion of a surface or fabric then optionally rinsing such surface or fabric. The surface or fabric may be subjected to a washing step prior to the aforementioned rinsing step. For purposes of the present invention, washing includes but is not limited to, scrubbing, and mechanical agitation. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the cleaning compositions of the present invention are ideally suited for use in laundry applications. Accordingly, the present invention includes a method for laundering a fabric. The method comprises the steps of contacting a fabric to be laundered with a said cleaning laundry solution comprising at least one embodiment of Applicants' cleaning composition, cleaning additive or mixture thereof. The fabric, may comprise most any fabric capable of being laundered in normal consumer use conditions. The solution preferably has a pH of from about 8 to about 10.5. The compositions may be employed at concentrations of from about 500 ppm to about 15,000 ppm in solution. The water temperatures typically range from about 5 °C to about 90 °C. The water to fabric, ratio is typically from about 1:1 to about 30:1.<br>
