				<td>DIPHOSPHINES, PREPARATION AND USES THEREOF<br>
The present invention relates to novel diphosphines especially in their optically active form, and also to the process for obtaining them.<br>
The invention is also directed toward their uses as bidentate ligands in the synthesis of transition metal-based catalysts for asymmetric catalysis.<br>
The invention is also directed toward their uses as intermediate products in the preparation of ligands in insoluble form. More particularly, the invention lies in an optically active polymer in which one of the polymer units consists of a chiral diphosphine. • The invention is also directed toward the use of said polymer as " a ligand in the preparation of metal complexes for asymmetric catalysis.<br>
The production of pure optically active compounds is a problem that arises in many technical fields, for instance pharmacy, agrochemistry, the food industry (food additives and flavorings) and also in the fragrance industry.<br>
This problem is expected to become increasingly important since it has been found more and more that, in a given application, only one of the stereoisomers has the desired property.<br>
Asymmetric catalysis has undergone considerable expansion in - recent years. It has the advantage of leading directly to the preparation of optically pure or optically enriched isomers by asymmetric induction without it being necessary to perform resolution of racemic mixtures.<br><br>
2, 2' -Bis (diphenylphosphino) -1,1' -binaphthyl (BINAP) is an example of a diphosphorus • Mgand commonly used for the preparation of metal complexes for the asymmetric catalysis of hydrogenation, carbonylation, hydrosilyla-tion and C-C bond forming reactions (such as allylic substitutions or Grignard cross-couplings) or even asymmetric isomerization reactions of allylamines.<br>
The complexes used are derivatives of palladium, ruthenium, rhodium and iridium salts.<br>
The development of novel chiral ligands is desirable for several reasons.<br>
Ligands that are capable of improving the enantio-selectivity of reactions are sought.<br>
There is also a need for ligands that are industrially readily accessible.<br>
Thus, document WO 00/49028 describes a diphosphine ' that is a BINAP derivative, the two naphthyl groups of which bear a substitution in position 6 and 6' . The agenr more specifically concerned is 6,6'-diaminomethylBINAP.<br>
However, the preparation of this phosphine is nor readily achievable industrially, since it includes numerous steps:<br><br><br>
In the pursuit of its research, the Applicant has found-that it is possible to prepare diphosphines that may be prepared much more readily on an industrial scale since they are derived from a commercial product, namely 2,2'-bis (diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl or BINAP.<br>
A first subject of the invention is diphosphines in which the naphthyl groups are substituted in the 5,5' position.<br>
Another subject of the invention is intermediate products that are diphosphines in dioxide form containing substituents in the 5,5' position.<br>
The invention is directed not only toward the racemic mixture but also toward the optically active forms of said diphosphines.<br><br>
Other subjects of the invention are the processes for preparing said disphosphines, and the uses thereof in asymmetric catalysis.<br>
The present invention thus provides a diphosphine that may be used as ligands in chiral catalysts, and corresponding to formula (I):<br><br>
in said formula:<br>
-	Rx and R2, which may be identical or different, represent a hydrogen atom or a substituent,<br>
-	Ari  and  Ar*-  independently  represent  an  alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or arylalkyl group,<br>

. a -CH2OH group, -. a group -CC-NH-Rb, . a group derived from the aminomethyl group such<br>
as :<br>
. a group -CK:-NH-CQ-Rb/<br>
. a group -CH:-NH-CO-NH-Rb,<br>
. a group -CH:-N=CH-Ra,<br>
. a -CH2-N=C=0 group,<br>

. a group -N=CH-Ra,<br>
. an -NH-NH2 group,<br>
• an -N=N+=N~ group,<br>
. an -N=C=0 group, . a magnesium or lithium atom,<br>
in the various formulae, Ra represents an alkyl, cycloalkyl, arylalkyl or phenyl group and Rb has the meaning given for Ra and also represents a naphthyl group.<br>
The present invention is also directed toward "he intermediate products, i.e. the diphosphine in dioxide form, in racer-ic form or in chiral form, and which corresponds to the following formula:<br><br><br>
in   said   formula    (II) ,    Ri,   R2,   Ar:/   Ar2,   Xi   and  X2   have the meaning  given  for  formula   (I) .<br>
Among the diphosphines corresponding to the general formula (I), one particularly advantageous group of diphosphines is that consisting of the diphosphines corresponding to formula (I' ) , which may be used as intermediate products for the preparation of .insoluble polymers   as  constituents   of  one  of  -he polymer  units:<br><br>

a group -C30Ra in which Ra represents an aikyl, cycloaikyi, arylalkyl or phenyl group, an -N=C~0 group, . a -CH2-N=C=0 group.<br>
The characteristic of the diphosphines of formula {!'} is that they bear two functional groups capable of ^ . reacting with one or more pclymerizable monomers leading to a polymer which, when it is obtained from a chiral diphosphine, is optically active and, is thus able to be used as a ligand in metal complexes used in asymmetric catalysis.<br>
The definition of certain terms used ~in the present text is recalled hereinbelow.<br>

It is desirable for the substituents not to interfere with the reactions performed in'"the preparation of the compounds (I) and (I') starting with the precursors from which they are derived. However, protection and deprotection steps may be envisioned, where appropriate. A person skilled in the art may refer to the following publication Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Greene T.W. and Wuts P.G.M., published by John Wiley and Sons, 1991, to perform the protection of particular organic functions.<br>

The' compounds of formula (I), (I') or (II) in which Ar: and Ar2 are identical and preferably represent a phenyl group are most particularly preferred.<br>
The carbocyclic groups Ar: and Ar2 may bear substituents which are such that they do not interfere with the reactions used in the process of the invention. These<br><br>
substituents are inert under the conditions used in the halogenation (step i) , cyanation (step ii) and reduction (steps iii and iv; reactions. Thus, the invention does not exclude the presence of substituents other chan R: and R2.<br>
The naphthyl groups may also bear a substituent represented by R: cr R:, which may be of the same nature as those that have just been mentioned.<br>
Preferably, the substituents are alkyl or alkoxy groups preferably containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
In formulae (I) , (I' ) and (II) , Rx and R2 preferably represent a hydrogen atom or one or more groups chosen from (C1-C4) alkyl and (Cx-C4) alkoxy.<br>
The preferred compounds (I), (I') and (II) do not bear a substituent, which means that Ri and R2 represent a hydrogen atom.<br>
As regards the preferred groups Xi and X2, Ra represents an alkyl group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a cyclohexyl group, a phenyl group and a benzyl group, and Rb has the meaning given for Ra and also represents a naphthyl group.<br>

-	Ri, R2, Ari and Ar2 have the meaning given above. The diphosphine in dioxide form of formula  (ill)  is known.  It  may  be  obtained  by  oxidation  of  the diphosphine of formula (IV) :<br><br><br>
in said formula:<br>
- Ri/ R2/ Ari anc* Ar2 have the meaning given above.<br>
The diphosphine in oxide form of formula (III) is obtained by oxidation using an agent for oxidizing the<br>
diphosphine of formula (IV).<br>
Although any type of oxidizing agent may be used, a<br>
chemical oxidizing agent, for example potassium permanganate  or  alternatively molecular  oxygen  or  a  gas -containing it, use is preferably made of hydrogen peroxide, preferably in the form_ of an aqueous solution.<br>
The concentration of the hydrogen-peroxide solution is advantageously between 10% and 25% by weight.<br>
The amount of oxidizing agent used may vary widely from the stoichiometric amount up tc a 100% excess relative to the stoichiometry.<br>
An organic solvent that dissolves the diphosphine is used. The solvent may be chosen from aliphatic, cyclcaliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, which may or may not be chlorinated. Examples that may be mentioned include di chl or orr.e thane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and 1,2-dichloroethane.<br>
The  concentration  cf  diphosphine  in  the  reaction<br><br>
solvent is preferably between 0.1 and 50 g/I.<br>
The diphosphine, generally dissolved in an adequate solvent, is thus placed in contact with the oxidizing agent.<br>
The reaction is advantageously performed at re on temperature, usually between -5°C and 25°C.<br>
The reaction time is generally between 30 minutes and 6 hours.<br>
The diphosphine is recovered in dioxide form in the organic phase.<br>
The aqueous and organic phases are separated.<br>
A standard work-up of the phases is performed.<br>
Thus, the organic phase is washed with sodium bisulfite, which removes from the aqueous phase the unreacted excess oxidizing agent (peroxide).<br>
A common drying operation is preferably performed, over a drying agent, for example sodium sulfate or magnesium sulfate.<br>
A diphosphine in dioxide form corresponding to formula (III) and denoted in the text hereinbelow as "diphosphine (PO)" is obtained.<br>
In accordance with the present"invention, the halogena-tion reaction of the naphthyl nucleus is performed, which is an electrophilic reaction performed via the action of a halogen, chlorine, bromine or iodine, on the diphosphine in dioxide form and in the presence of<br><br>
a catalyst.<br>
This reaction may be performed in the presence of an iron-based catalyse. Iron turnings or filings are preferably used.<br>
The amount of iron used is such that the ratio between the number of moles of iron and the number of moles of compound of formula (III) ranges between 15 and 30 and more particularly at about 20.<br>
According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, the halogenation takes place in an inert aprotic solvent.<br>
Said solvent should have a boiling point of greater than 60°C. Chlorinated or brominated halogenated hydrocarbons are most particularly used, preferably chloroform, carbon tetrachloride or 1,2-dichloroethane.<br>
A preferred solvent that may be mentioned is 1,2-dichloroethane.<br>
Preferably, the molar ratio of the halogenating agent to the diphosphine (PO) ranges between 15 and 30 and preferably at about 20.<br>
When the process, is performed in solution, the concentration of the reagents may vary very widely between 0.01  and  10  mcl/1,  for  example  between  0-05  and<br>
"  7~^l /l<br>
—   ILI\^ J~ /   _L .<br>
The halogenation reaction, preferably the bro~ination, is performed between 20°C and 100°C and advantageously in the absence of light so as to avoid spurious radical reactions.<br><br>
A dihalo  diphosphine  (PO)  corresponding  to  formula (Ilai) is thus obtained.<br>
It is recovered in a conventional manner: neutralization of the excess bromine with sodium disulfide, treatment with a base 'sodium carbonate or sodium hydrogen carbonate;, separation of the aqueous and organic phases and then recovery of the dihalo diphosphine (PC) from the organic solution, which is dried followed by removal of the organic solvent.<br>
In step (ii), the phosphorus atom in oxidized form {?0) is reduced to give the diphosphine of formula (lax).<br>
In a following step, reduction of the diphosphine in dioxide form is performed.<br>
This step consists in subjecting said diphosphine to a reduction performed using a hydrogenosilane.<br>
Said  hydrogenosilane  may  be  represented  by  the following formula:<br>
HSiRaRpR5 (Fa)<br>
in said formula:<br>
-	Raf Rp and R5, which may be identical or different, represent a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a phenyl group or a chlorine atom,<br>
-	at most two of the groups Ra, Rp and R5 represent a hydrogen atom.<br>
The preferred reducing agents correspond to formula Td) in which Ra, Rp. and R5 represent a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, a phenyl group or a chlorine atom.<br><br>
Examples of reducing agents that may be mentioned more particularly include:<br>
-	A1H3,<br>
-	PhSiH3,<br>
-	HSiCl3/<br><br>
-	(CH2)2HSiCl,<br>
-	CH3(HSiCl)<br>
-	PMHS or polymethylhydrosiloxane.<br>
The invention does not exclude any other type of organosilicon compound comprising an SiH group.<br>
The amount of reducing agent is usually a large stoichiometric excess.<br>
Thus, the ratio between the number of moles of reducing agent .and the number of moles of diphosphine  (PO) ranges between 10 and 70.<br>
Among the abovementioned reducing agents, a mixture of PhSiH3 (cr PMHS) and of HSiCl3 is used.<br>
In this case, the amount of PhSiH3 is such that the ratio between the number of moles of PhSiH3 and of moles of diphosphine (PC: ranges between 50 and 70.<br>
As regards the amount of HSiCls, the ratio between the number of moles cf HSiCl3 and the number of moles of diphosphine (PO) ranges between 1C and 4 0.<br>
The reduction reaction is performed at a temperature advantageously chosen between 80°C and 130CC.<br>
At the end of reaction, the medium is cooled to room temperature and the product is recovered in solid form<br><br>
after evaporation.<br>
The product may be washed one or more times using an organic solvent, preferably a halogenated or ncr.-halogenated aliphatic, cyclcaliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon. Preferred solvents that may be mentioned include pentane, hexane and cyciohexane.<br>
A diphosphine corresponding tc formula (lai) 'is obtained.<br>
The present invention also provides .the process for obtaining a diphosphine corresponding to formula (Ia2) :<br><br>
in which Ri, R2, Ari and Ar2 are as defined above.<br>
The process of the invention for obtaining the diphosphine of formula (Ia2) more specifically comprises the following steps:<br>
i) performing the substitution of the two halogen atoms, preferably bromine atoms, with cyano groups by reacting the diphosphine in dioxide and dihalo form in position 5,5' of formula (Ilai) :<br><br><br>
in said formula:<br>
-	X, Ri, R2, Ari and Ar2 have the meaning given above,<br>
using a suitable nucleophilic reagent so as to obtain<br>
the corresponding dicyano compound (IIa2) :<br><br>
in said formula:<br>
-	Rir   R&gt;2r   Ari ar.d Ar2 have the meaning given above,<br>
ii;  performing rhe reduction of "che diphosphine  in dioxide and dicyano form in position 5,5' of formula (Ilao) into the diphosphine of formula (Ia2) :<br><br><br>
in said formula:<br>
- R1, R2, Ar1 and Ar2 have the meaning given above.<br>
Starting with a diphosphine in dioxide and dihalo form of formula (Ilai), the next step is a cyanation reaction, which is a nucleophilic substitution. The two halogen atoms borne by the naphthyl nuclei are replaced with cyano groups via the action of a suitable nucleophilic agent.<br>
To perform this substitution, a person skilled in the art may use any of the methods known in the art.<br>
According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, the nucleophilic agent used is copper(I) or (II) cyanide.<br>
The molar ratio of the copper cyanide to the compound of formula (Ilai) is preferably greater than 2, advantageously between 2 and 4 and preferably between 2 and 3.<br>
The reaction is preferably performed in a solvent. Examples of solvents that may be mentioned include amides such as dimethylformamide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolid-<br><br>
inone and hexamethylphosphorylamide. Dimethyl formamide is markedly preferred.  Pyridine is also a suitable<br>
solvent.<br>
The reaction temperature is advantageously maintained between 50°C and 200°C and preferably between 100°C and 190°C.<br>
The concentration of reagents in the reaction medium generally varies between 0.1 and 10 raol/1, for example between 2 and 7 mcl/1.<br>
The isolation of the nitrile involves decomposition of the intermediate complex formed and trapping of the excess cyanide.<br>
The hydrolysis cf the intermediate complex may be performed either via the action of hydrated iron chloride or via the action of aqueous ethylenediamine.<br>
In the first case, the reaction medium is poured into an aqueous 50-r 3% (g/ml) . iron chloride solution containing concentrated hydrochloric acid. The resulting solution is heated to 40-80cC until the complex has completely decompcsed. The medium is then decanted and extracted in a conventional manner.<br>
In the second case, the reaction medium is poured into an aqueous ethylenediamine solution (ethylenediamine/-water: 1/5-1/1 (v v) , for example 1/3) and the mixture is then stirred vigorously. The medium is then decanted and extracted in a manner known per se.<br>

According to another aspect of the invention, the invention relates to the use of diphosphine in which the naphthyl groups are substituted in the 5,5' position with two identical functional groups capable of reacting with pclymerizable monomers, leading to a racemic or optically active polymer.<br>
The diphosphines used correspond to formula (I').<br>
In formula (I'), Xi represents an aminomethyl group -CK1-NK2, a hydrcxyl group -OH, a hydroxymethyl group -CHi-OH, a carboxylic or ester group -COORa (R£ represents a hydrogen atom or ar. alkyl, cycloalkyl, arylalkyl or phenyl group, more preferably a hydrogen atom or a C1-C2 alkyl group), an isocyanato group -N=C=3 or an isocyanatomethy1 group -CH:-K=C=0.<br>
Advantageously, they are diphosphines corresponding to formulae (la-) , ;ia3) , (Ia4) , (Ias) , (Ia6) , (Ian) and (Ia:e) .<br><br>
Another subject of the invention thus lies in optically active polymers comprising the chiral diphosphine of formula (I') as polymer units.<br>
Another subject of the invention consists of the use of the optically active polymer as a ligand in the preparation of metal complexes for asymmetric catalysis.<br>
The polymer of the invention consists of a sequence of two types of units.<br>
The first type of unit is the chiral diphosphine residue corresponding to formula (I' ) and bearing two identical polymerizable functional groups.<br>
The second type of unit is a monomer residue that is polymerizable with said functional groups, i.e. a monomer comprising at least two identical functional groups capable of reacting with the functional groups of the chiral diphosphine.<br>
The preferred monomer is di functional and may be represented by formula (X) below:<br><br>
in which:<br>
-	M represents a divalent hydrocarbon-based group of<br>
aliphatic, alicyclic and/or aromatic nature,<br>
-	Yi represents a functional  group,  preferably a<br>
■'carboxylic,  ester,  hydroxy!,  amino,  isocyanato,<br>
aldehyde or ketone group.<br>
The size of the group M will be adjusted by a person skilled in the art as a function of the final use of<br><br>
"Che ligand and especially as a function of the reaction that the metal complex formed from this polymer ligand is intended to catalyze.<br>
Preferred meanings will be given later for the reagents preferentially chosen.<br>

in which<br>
-	R-_ and R-,  which may be identical or different, represent a hydrogen atom or a substituent,<br>

. and of the group Y: chosen from carboxylic, ester, hydroxy1, amino, isocyanato, aldehyde and ketone groups,<br>
-	the degree of polymerization is preferably between<br>
2 and 100 and better still between 2 and 50".<br>
The choice of these functions, combined with the choice of the polymerizable monomers, determines the nature of the resulting polymer.<br>
Thus, Fi more particularly represents:<br>
-	a urea group (Ft) resulting from the reaction of an aminomethyl group (Xi) with an isocyanato group (Yi) or an isocyanato or isocyanatomethyl group (Xi) with an amino group (Yi) ,<br>
-	a urethane group (Fi) resulting from the reaction of an isocyanato or isocyanatomethyl group (Xi) with  a  hydroxy1  group  (Y:)  or  a  hydroxy1  or hydroxymethyl group (Xi) with an isocyanato group (Yi),<br>

-	an amide group (Fi) resulting from the reaction of a carboxylic group (Xi) with an amino group (Yi) or an aminomethyl group (Xi) with a carboxylic group (Yx),<br>
-	an imine group (Fi) resulting from the reaction of<br><br>
an aminomethyl group  (Xi)  with an  aldehyde  or ketone -group (Yi) .<br>
The present invention encompasses all types of polymers and especially linear, branched or crosslinked polymers. Mention may be made of polymers such as polyester, polyurethane, polyamide, polyurea, polyimine<br>
and polyimide.<br>
The preferred polymers are linear polymers, but the invention does not exclude crosslinked polymers obtained by using a polymerizable monomer comprising more than two functional groups, for example three groups.<br>
The choice of monomers placed in contact will be made as a function of their ease of access.<br>
Thus, the invention favors the chiral substance bearing in position 5,5' two aminomethyl groups.<br>
The compounds preferably used, corresponding to formula (la; \ in which Ar: and Ar2 are independently chosen from a 'Zi-Ci)alkyl croup or a phenyl group optionally substituted with methyl or tert-butyl; and (C5-Ce; -cycloalkyl optionally substituted with methyl or tert-<br>
Those of formula (Ia^) in which Ari and Ar2 are identical and represent a phenyl group are more preferably chosen.<br>
In accordance with the invention, one of the diphos-phines corresponding to one of the formulae (I') is reacted with a polymerizable monomer. It is preferentially ■ chosen to use only one polymerizable monomer.<br><br>
Classes of monomers that may esceciaxxy u~ nicu.i'juc-include diacids, diesters, diols, diisocyanates, dialdehydes and diketones.<br>
Although the invention is not intended to be specifically limited thereto, polyamides, pclyureas and polyimides will be described in further detail.<br>
The polyureas, polyamides and polyimides of the invention may be prepared starting with a chiral diphosphine* consisting of a chiral substance bearing, as functional groups, two aminomechyl groups, and which corresponds to the formulae (Ia3).<br>

When the targeted polymer is a	polyurea,  it may be<br>
synthesized by polymerization of	a diphosphine bearing<br>
two -CH2-NH2 groups with one or	more di- or poiyisc-<br>

The size of the group J will be adjusted by a person skilled in the art as a function of the final use of<br><br>
the ligand and especially as a function of the reaction that the metal complex formed from this polymer ligand is intended to catalyze.<br>
The catalytic sites of the polymer of the invention are located on the diphosphine-based units. The size of the group J thus determines the spacing of" the catalytic sites.<br>
The group J is, for example, a Ci-Cie and preferably Ci-C12 alkylene chain, optionally interrupted with one or more (preferably 1 to 4 and better still 1 to 2) hetero atoms chosen from 0, N and S, said chain optionally comprising one cr mere unsaturations (preferably 1 to 4 and better still 1 to 2); a croup - (CH2) &amp;-K- (CH2) b~ in which a and b are, independently, an integer from 0 to 6 and  K  represents   (C£-Ce) cyclcalkylene;   a  group<br>

When J contains an alkylene chain, it is linear cr branched and preferably contains 1 to 6 carbon atoms. When this alkylene chain comprises a nitrogen atom, it bears a (Ci~C6) alkyl group or a hydrogen atom.<br>
When J contains cyclcalkylene, J is preferably cyclc-hexylene.<br>

When J represents - (CH2) a~L- (CH2) --, - (CH2) a-K-(CH2) b- or - (CK?) a"V0- (CH2) b-r   s and b are preferably identical.<br>
The term "heteroarylene" means a divalent group corresponding to a heterocycle in which two hydrogen atoms have been replaced with two bonds.<br>
Heteroarylenes derived from the following heterocycles are preferred: fur an, thiopher.e, pyrrole, oxazcle, thiazole, imidazole, pyrazole, isoxazole, isorhiazcle, pyridine, pyridazine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, indolizine, indole, isoindole, benzofuran, benzothiophene, benzimidazole,, benzo thiazole, qui r.o line, isoquinolir e, cinnoline, phthalazine, quinazoline, naphthyridine and pteridine.

The condensation of the diisocyanate with the diphos-phine is performed under suitable conditions that are readily determined by a person skilled in the art.<br>
These polymerization conditions are preferably adjusted so as to obtain a polymer with a degree of polymerization of from 2 to 100, preferably from 5 to 100, for example from 2 to 50 and better still from 4 to 25.<br>
Polyureas with a degree of polymerization of from ..3 to 8 are particularly suitable for use.<br>
A person skilled in the art will select the degree cf polymerization such that the resulting polymer is insoluble in the solvent or mixture of solvents used in the asymmetric reaction that needs to be catalyzed.<br>
The choice of the polymerization method is not critical according to the invention.<br>
One particularly suitable method is solution polymerization.<br>
The solvent is generally a polar aprotic solvent chosen from an optionally halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon, for example methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride cr 1,2-dichlorcethane; an optionally halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon, for example chlorc-benzene or dichlorobenzene; an ether such as diethyl ether, diisoproryl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diethylene  glycol  dimethyl  ether  and  .glymes,  and<br><br>

The concentration cf reagents in the solution varies very widely as a function of the solubility of the reagents. It is generally between 0. 05 and 1 mol/1 ahd preferably between 0.01 and 1 mol/1, for example 0.1 mol/1.<br>
Preferably, the diisocyanate is used in slight excess relative to the diphosphine, although, strictly speaking, a stoichiometric ratio - of these two compounds may be suitable.<br>
Thus, the molar ratio cf the diisocyanate to the diphosphine is generally set at between 1 and 1.5, for example between 1 and 1.3.<br>
The temperature at which the polymerization is performed is determined as a function of the reactivity of the various reagents and of the desired degree of polymerization. As a guide, the temperature ranges between -20°C and 100°C, preferably between room temperature and 100°C, for example between 15 and 100°C and better still between 15 and 40°C. It is advantageously 20°C.<br>
The polymerization is performed conventionally by dissolving the reagents in the solvent, mixing, optionally heating the reaction medium, and then isolating the polymer, for example by filtration of the reaction medium. It will be noted that it may be necessary, before isolation of the polymer, to deactivate the ends<br><br>
of che polymer chain, and especially the unreacted iso-cya-nate functions, by addition of a Ci-Ce alkanol, for example propanol, isopropanol, methanol or ethanol, or even tert-butyl alcohol.<br>
An example of a polymer that is particularly preferred is a polymer containing as repeating unit:<br><br>

in which W is as defined for J above.<br>
The preferred meanings of J indicated above are also preferred meanings of W.<br>
The group W may be substituted wizh one or more haicgen atoms or oxo, (Ci-Cs) alkyl,- (C:-Cf; aikoxy or di (C:-C5) -alkylamino groups.<br>

The activated derivative of the dicarboxylic acid more generally denotes the dicarboxylic acid compound in which one or :wo of the carboxylic functions have been modified so as to increase their reactivity.<br>
Activated derivatives of dicarboxylic acid are obtained, for example, by formation of an anhydride bond cr of a group -COY in which Y is a halogen atom such as bromine cr chlorine.<br>
Other activated derivatives of dicarboxylic acids are chose bearing, instead of the carboxylic functions, groups -COT in which T denotes an azide, imidazoiide, p-nitrophenoxy, 1-benzotriazoie, N-O-succinimide, acyl-oxy (such as pivalcyloxy), (Ci-C: alkoxy)carbonyloxy, cr dialkyl- or dicycloalkyl-O-ureide group.<br>
The condensation of the diphosphine with the dicarboxylic acid or the activated derivative thereof is generally performed in a solvent.<br><br>
When the dicarbcxylic acid is used in unmodified form, it may be advantageous to perform the condensation in the presence of a catalyst, for example a strong acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, or alternatively in the presence of a coupling agent such as those commonly used in peptide synthesis.<br>
Among the known coupling agents that may be mentioned are N-hydroxylated derivatives such as N-hydroxy-succinimide and 1-hydroxybenzotriazoie; disulfides such as dipyridyl 2,2'-disulfide; succinic acid derivatives such as N,N' -disuccinimidyl carbonate;. phosphinic chlorides such as N,N'-bis(2-oxo-3-oxazolidinyl)phosphinic chloride; oxalates such as N,N'-disuccinimidyl oxalate (DSO), diphthalimide N,N'-oxalate (DPO), N,N'- * bis (norbornenylsuccinimidyl) oxalate (BNO), 1,1'-cis-(benzotriazolylL oxalate (BBTO), 1,1'-bis(6-chltro-benzotriazolyl) oxalate (BCTO) or 1, 1'-bis(6-trifluoro-methylbenzotriazolyl) oxalate (BTBO); triarylphosphines such as triphenylphosphine; a combination of a di (lower alkyl) azodicarboxylate and of a triarylphosphine, such as a combination of diethyl azodicarboxylate and of triphenylphosphine; N-(lower alkyl)-5-aryl-isoxazolium-3'-sulfonates such as N-ethyl-5-phenylisoxazolium-3' -sulfonate; carbodiimide derivatives, including N', N'-dicycloalkylcarbodiimides such as N' , N' -dicyclo-hexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or l-ethyl-3- (3-dimethylamino-propyl)carbodiimide (EDAPC); diheteroaryl diselenides such as di-2-pyridyl diselenide; arylsulfonyltri-azolides such as p-nitrobenzenesulfonyltriazolide; 2-halo-l-(lower alkyl)pyridinium .halides such as 2-chloro-l-methylpyridinium iodide; diarylphosphcryl-azides such as diphenylphosphorylazide (DPPA); imidazole derivatives such as 1,1'-oxalyldiimidazole or N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole; benzotriazole derivatives such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole  (HOBT);  and dicarcox-<br><br>
imide derivatives such as N~hydroxy-5-norbornene-2, 3-dicarboximide (H0N3). Among these, carbodiimide derivatives are preferred.<br>
The reaction may take place within a wide temperature<br>
range.<br>
According to the reactivity of the reagents used, the reaction temperature ranges between -20°C and 100°C.<br>
When the polymerization involves the reaction of an activated derivative of the dicarboxylic acid with a diphosphine, a relatively low temperature, preferably of between 0°C and 40°C, is sufficient.<br>
Conversely, when the dicarboxylic acid_ is used in unmodified form in the reaction, the temperature is preferably between 50 and 80°C.<br>
The concentration of reagents in the reaction medium is not a determining factor according to the invention. It may range between 0.05 and 1 mci/1.<br>
In general, the mciar ratio of "he dicarboxylic acid cr of the activated derivative thereof to the diphosphine ranges between 0.E and 1.5 and preferably between 0. r ano ..z.<br>
A typical procedure, illustrating the preparation of a polyamide starting with a carboxylic acid chloride, is as follows.<br>
3.75 mmol of "he carboxylic acid chloride are added to a solution of 4.16 mmol of diphosphine in 5 ml of N,N-dimethyiacetamide. The reaction mixture is stirred overnight at room temperature (18 to 30°C) . The poly-<br><br>
amide is then precipitated frorr. 150 ml of distilled water. The polymer is filtered off on a sinter funnel, and washed with water and then with isopropanol.<br>
The ■ general conditions for performing the polymerization and for isolating the polymer will be readily determined by a person skilled in the art, given that the preferred poiyamides of the invention have a degree of polymerization of between" 2 and 100,-for example between 5 and 100, preferably between 2 and 50 and better still between 4 and 25.<br>
A person skilled in the art will select the degree	of<br>
polymerization  such  that  the  resulting  polymer	is<br>
insoluble in the solvent or mixture of solvents used	in<br>
the asymmetric reaction that needs to be catalyzed.<br>

-	W has the meaning given for J,<br><br>
- the degree of polymerization is preferably between 2 and 100 and better still between 2 and 50.<br>
Polyimides<br>
When the polymer is a polyimide, it may be prepared by condensation of a diphosphine bearing two aminoethyl functions with one or more tetracarboxylic acids or tetracarboxylic acid dianhydrides.<br>
For the preparation of these polyimides, a person skilled in the art may take inspiration from D.C. Sherrington, Cherru Commun. , 1993, 2275-2286.<br>
Advantageously, the polyimides -are prepared in two steps.<br>
In a first step, a polyamide is formed. This step is performed, for example, at a temperature of between 15 and 50°C and preferably between 20 and 30°C, in a polar aprotic solvent (such as an amide such as formamide, dimethylacetamide" cr N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, preferably dimethyiacetamide).<br>
In a second step, the polyimide is formed. This second step may be performed by treatment with a mixture cf acetic anhydride and pyridine at a temperature cf between -1CCCC and 10°C and preferably between -7 8 CC and -50CC.<br>
According to another variant of the invention, the polymer may be a polyurethane.<br>
Polyurethanes<br>
—<br>
When the polymer is a polyurethane, it may be prepared<br><br>
by condensation of a chiral diphosphine bearing two hydroxyl or hydrcxymethyl groups with a monomer of the diisocyanate type.<br>
In this case, a catalysis with a cin salt is often necessary. Reference may be made especially to the article by M. Lemaire ez al. J. l-Iol. Cat. A. 2002, Vol. 182-183, 239-247.<br>

Similarly, the polymerizable monomers preferably used<br><br>
for this polymerization are those described above for the preparation of the optically active .polymers.<br>
The operating conditions for this polymerization will be readily determined by a person skilled in the art by analogy with those proposed for the polymerization reaction leading to the optically active polymer.<br>
The diphosphines obtained according to the processes of the invention and those that are insolubilized in the form of a polymer as described above may be used as<br>
iigands in the preparation of metal complexes for the asymmetric catalysis of the following reactions: hydro-genation, hydrosilylation, hydroboration of unsaturated compounds, epoxidation of allylie alcohols, vicinal hydroxylation, hydrovinylation, hydroformylation, cyclopropanation, olefin isomerization, propylene polymerization, addition of - organometallic compounds to aldehydes, allylic alkylation, reactions of aldol type, DieIs-Alder reactions and, in general, reactions for formation of C-C bonds (such as allylic substitutions or Grignard cross-couplings).<br>

The complexes comprising a ligand according to the invention and the transition metal may be prepared according to the known processes described in the literature.<br>
The complexes are generally prepared from a pre-catalyst, the nature of which varies according to the transition metal selected.<br><br>
In the case of rhodium complexes, the precatalyst is, for example, one of the following compounds: [RhI(CO)2Cl]2; [Rh1 (COD) CI] 2 in which COD denotes cyclo-octadiene; or Rh1(acac)(CO)2 in which acac denotes acetylacetonate.<br>
In the case of ruthenium complexes, precatalysts that are particularly suitable are bis(2-methylallyl)cyclo-octa-1, 5-dieneruthenium and [RuCl2 (benzene) ] 2. Mention may also be made of Ru(COD) (ri3-(CH2) 2CHCH3) 2.<br>

cycloocta-1, 5-dieneruthenium, a solution or suspension containing the metal precatalyst, a ligand and a fully degassed solvent such-as acetone (the ligand concentration of the solution or suspension ranging between 0.001 and 1 mol/1) is prepared, to which is added a methanol ic solution of hydrobromic acid. The ratio of the ruthenium to bromine advantageously ranges between 1:1 and 1:4 and preferably between 1:2 and 1:3. The molar ratio of the ligand to the transition metal is about' 1. It may be between 0.8 and 1.2.<br>
When the precatalyst is [RuCl2 (benzene) ] 2, the complex is prepared by mixing together the precatalyst, the ligand and an organic solvent and optionally maintaining at a temperature of between 15 and 150°C for 1 minute to 24 hours and preferably from 30 to 120CC for 10 minutes to 5 hours.<br>

As a variant, when the solvent is a mixture of an aromatic hydrocarbon (such as benzene) with an alcohol (such as ethanol) , the reaction medium is heated to a temperature of between 30 and 70°C.<br>
The catalyst is then recovered according to the standard techniques (filtration or crystallization) and is used in asymmetric reactions. However, the reaction that needs to be .catalyzed by the complex thus prepared may be performed without intermediate isolation of the catalyst complex.<br>
The case of hydrogenation is outlined in detail in the text hereinbelow.<br>

The exact operating conditions depend on the nature of the substrate that needs -to be hydrogenated. However, in the general case, a pressure of from 20 to 80 bar and preferably from 40 to 60 bar, and a temperature of from 30 to 70°C are particularly suitable.<br>
The reaction medium may. consist of the reaction medium<br><br>
in which the catalyst was obtained. The hydrogenation<br>
reaction is then performed in situ.	- -<br>
As a variant, the catalyst is isolated from the reaction medium in which it was obtained. In this case, the reaction medium of the hydrogenation reaction consists of one or more solvents, chosen especially from C1-C5 aliphatic alcohols, such as methanol or propanol, and an amide as defined above, preferably dimethylformamide, optionally as a mixture with benzene.<br>
When the hydrogenation reaction is performed in situ, it is desirable to add to the reaction medium one or more solvents chosen from these mentioned above and more particularly one or more aliphatic alcohols.<br>
According to one preferred embodiment, fully degassed methanol and the substrate are added to the reaction medium containing the complex. The amount of methanol, cr more generally of solvent, that may be added is such "hat the concentration of the substrate in the hydro-genation reaction medium is between 1 x 10 and 10 mol/1 and preferably between 0.01 and 1 mcl/1.<br>
The molar ratio of the substrate to the catalyst generally ranges from 1/100 to 1/lOC 000 and preferably from 1/20 to 1/2000. This ratio is, for example, 1/1000,<br>
Zhe removal of the catalyst from the reaction medium is facilitated when the ligand used is in the form of a polymer.<br>
The catalyst is separated from the reaction medium ry nanof i It rat ion or ultrafiltration..<br><br>
The technique of nanof iltraticn is more particularly suitable in the case of catalyses of polymer type. The application  of  this  technique  is  illustrated,  for example,  in Tetrahedron:  Asymmetry,  Vol.  8,  No 12, 1975-1977, 1997.<br>
