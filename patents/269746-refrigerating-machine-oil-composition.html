SpeC1fication<br>
Refrigerating Machine Oil Composition<br>
Technical Field [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a refrigerating machine oil composition and, more particularly, to a refrigerating machine oil composition which exhibits enhanced energy saving performance by virtue of its low viscosity, which has excellent sealing performance and load resistance, and which can be employed in various refrigeration fields, particularly suitably in a closed-type refrigerator. Background Art [0002]<br>
Generally, a compression-type refrigerator includes a compressor, a condenser, an expansion mechanism (e.g., expansion valves), an evaporator, and an optional drying apparatus, and a liquid mixture of refrigerant and lubricating oil (refrigerator oil) C1rculates in a closed system of the refrigerator.  In such a refrigerator, generally, the compressor is operated at high temperature, while the cooler is operated at low temperature, although the difference in temperature varies depending on the type of the refrigerator. Therefore, a refrigerant and a lubricating oil must C1rculate in the system without causing phase separation within a wide temperature range of high to low temperature.<br><br>
Generally, a mixture of refrigerant and lubricating oil has a phase separating region in a low-temperature range and in a high-temperature range.  The highest phase separation temperature in the low-temperature range is preferably -10°C or lower, particularly preferably -20°C or lower, whereas the lowest phase separation temperature in the high-temperature<br>
range is preferably 30°C or higher, particularly preferably 40°C or higher. When phase separation occurs during operation of a refrigerator, the service life and effiC1ency of the refrigerator are considerably impaired.  For example, when phase separation between refrigerant and lubricating oil occurs in a compressor, lubrication of a movable member is impaired, thereby causing seizure or a similar phenomenon, resulting in considerable shortening of the service life of the refrigerator. When phase separation occurs in an evaporator, a viscous lubricant remains, thereby lowering heat exchange effiC1ency. [0003]<br>
Hitherto, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), etc. have been often employed as refrigerants for refrigerators. However, since these compounds contain chlorine, causing an environmental problem, use of chlorine-free alternative refrigerants such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) has been investigated. However, since HFCs are substances that possibly contribute to global warming, natural refrigerants such as hydrocarbon, ammonia, and carbon dioxide have become of interest for use as<br><br>
environmental friendly refrigerants.<br>
Meanwhile, lubrication performance of a lubricating oil for refrigerators, which is employed for lubricating a movable member of a refrigerator, is an important property. Particularly when a lubricating oil works in a compressor at high temperature, the lubricating oil is required to exhibit such a viscosity that the oil provides a stable oil layer that attains suffiC1ent lubrication. Generally, the required viscosity varies depending on the type of the employed compressor and operational conditions. Before being mixed with a refrigerant, the lubricating oil preferably has a<br>
kinematic viscosity of 10 to 200 mm2/s at 40°C.  It has also been accepted in the art that, when the viscosity is lower than this range, the oil layer becomes thin to readily cause lubrication failure, whereas when it is higher than the mentioned range, heat exchange effiC1ency is impaired. [0004]<br>
There is disclosed a lubricating oil composition for use in a vapor-compressing refrigerating machine employing carbonate gas as a refrigerant, wherein the composition contains a lube base oil as a predominant ingredient, the lube base oil exhibiting a 10%-recovery temperature of 400°C or higher and a 80%-recovery temperature of 600°C or lower, as determined through simulated distillation by gas chromatography; a kinematic viscosity (at 100°C) of 2 to 30 mm2/s; and a viscosity index of 100 or higher (see, for example, Patent Document 1).<br><br>
The kinematic viscosity of the base oil contained in the lubrication oil composition is 17 to 70 mm2/s as determined at 40°C (see Examples in Patent Document 1).<br>
When a refrigerator oil having such a high viscosity is employed in a refrigerator, energy consumption of the refrigerator unavoidably increases. Thus, lowering viscosity of a refrigerator oil and improving friction characteristics during lubrication have been studied, for the purpose of saving energy of refrigerators.<br>
Taking a refrigerating machine for refrigerators as an example, the viscosity of the lubricating oil was previously lowered to VG32, 22, 15, or 10, whereby energy saving effect was improved. However, further lowering the viscosity poses problems such as lowering sealing performance and lubriC1ty. [0005]<br>

Effects of the Invention [0010]<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a refrigerating machine oil composition which exhibits enhanced energy saving performance by virtue of its low viscosity, which has excellent sealing performance and load resistance, and which can be employed in various refrigeration fields, particularly suitably in a closed-type refrigerator. Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention [0011]<br>
The refrigerating machine oil composition according to the present invention employs a mixed base oil composed of a low-viscosity base oil (A) and a high-viscosity base oil (B), each base oil being composed of a speC1fic base oil<br><br>
(compound).  The low-viscosity base oil (A) is required to<br>
have a kinematic viscosity at 40°C of 5 mm2/s or less, preferably 3.0 mm2/s or less, more preferably 2.8 ram2/s or less. When the low-viscosity base oil (A) has a kinematic<br>
viscosity at 40°C higher than 5 mm2/s, the kinematic viscosity of the mixed base oil is difficult to regulate to fall within a predetermined range, thereby failing to attain the object of the present invention; i.e., improvement of energy saving performance. Although no particular limitation is imposed on the lower limit of the kinematic viscosity at<br>
40°C of the low-viscosity base oil (A), the base oil (A) must be liquid at room temperature, from the viewpoint of handling. Furthermore, in order to ensure a required flash point, the kinematic viscosity is preferably 0.1 mm2/s or higher, more preferably 0.2 mm2/s or higher, still more preferably 0.5 mm2/s or higher.<br>
The low-viscosity base oil (A) preferably has a flash point of 0°C or higher, more preferably 20°C or higher, still more preferably 50°C or higher. The molecular weight distribution factor (weight average molecular weight/number average molecular weight) is 1.5 or less, preferably 1.2 or less. When the flash point and the molecular weight distribution factor satisfy the aforementioned requirements, decrease in sealing performance can be prevented. [0012]<br>
The high-viscosity base oil (B) is required to have a kinematic viscosity at 40°C of 20 mm2/s or higher, preferably<br><br>
30 mm2/s or higher, particularly preferably 32 mm2/s or higher. When the high-viscosity base oil (B) has a kinematic<br>
viscosity at 40°C of 20 mm2/s or higher, both sealing performance and lubriC1ty can be enhanced. The upper limit<br>
of the kinematic viscosity at 40°C of the high-viscosity base oil (B) is 400 mm2/s, preferably 200 mm2/s, more preferably 150 mm2/s. When the high-viscosity base oil (B) has a kinematic viscosity at 40°C of 400 mm2/s or less, the kinematic viscosity at 40°C of the mixed base oil can be maintained within a predetermined low viscosity range, and sealing performance and lubriC1ty can be enhanced. [0013]<br>
According to the present invention, the low-viscosity base oil (A) and the high-viscosity base oil (B) essentially satisfy the aforementioned conditions of the kinematic<br>
viscosity at 40°C, Each of these base oils is composed of at least one speC1es selected from among (1) a mineral oil, (2) a synthetic hydrocarbon compound, (3) an oxygen-containing compound, and (4) a sulfur-containing compound. [0014]<br>
Preferred speC1es of the low-viscosity base oil (A) employed in the present invention will next be described.<br>
One example of the mineral oil (1) is a refined fraction produced through subjecting a lube oil fraction which has been obtained through distillation of crude oil (e.g., paraffin, intermediate base, or naphthene) at ambient pressure or distillation of the residue under reduced<br><br>
pressure, to at least one treatment such as solvent deasphalting, solvent extraction, hydro-cracking, solvent dewaxing, or hydro-refining. Another example of the mineral base oil is a base oil produced through isomerization of mineral oil wax or isomerization of wax (gas-to-liquid wax) produced through, for example, the Fischer-Tropsch process.<br>
These mineral oils preferably have a sulfur content of 400 mass ppm or less, more preferably 100 mass ppm or less, particularly preferably 50 mass ppm or less, still more preferably 30 mass ppm or less. These mineral oils preferably have an aromatic content (%CA) of 5 or less, more preferably 3 or less, still more preferably 1 or less. When a mineral oil has a sulfur content of 400 mass ppm or less and an aromatic content (%CA) of 5 or less, excellent stability to oxidation can be attained.<br>
The low-viscosity base oil (A) may be selected from<br>
such mineral oils having a kinematic viscosity at 40°C of 5 mm2/s or lower.  Particularly, those having a sulfur content of 50 mass ppm or less are preferred, with those having a sulfur content of 30 mass ppm or less being more preferred. [0015]<br>
The synthetic hydrocarbon compound (2) may be any of a linear-chain hydrocarbon compound, a branched-chain hydrocarbon compound, an alicyclic hydrocarbon compound, and an aromatic hydrocarbon compound. Among them, those having 5 to 24 carbon atoms in total are preferred as the low-viscosity base oil (A), with those having 6 to 20 carbon<br><br>
atoms in total being more preferred.<br>
Examples of the linear-chain and branched-chain hydrocarbon compounds include C2 to C20 olefin homopolymers and copolymers and hydrogenation products thereof.  SpeC1fic examples include homopolymers of a C2 to C4 olefin (e.g., ethylene, propylene, butylene, or isobuten); ethylene-(C3-C20) a-olefin copolymers; hydrogenation products thereof; a-olefin oligomers produced from a C6 to C20 a-olefin; and hydrogenation products thereof.<br>
Notably, ethylene homopolymer and a hydrogenation product thereof are examples of the linear-chain hydrocarbon compound. [0016]<br>
Examples of the C6 to C20 a-olefin oligomer and hydrogenation products thereof include such oligomers generally produced in the presence of a BF3 catalyst or Ziegler catalyst, which is typically employed in polymerization, and hydrogenation products of the oligomers.<br>
Among them, a-olefin oligomers produced in the presence of the metallocene catalyst mentioned hereinbelow and hydrogenation products thereof are more preferred. Of these, hydrogenation products are particularly preferred.<br>
Examples of the C6 to C20 a-olefin include 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-decene, 1-dodecene, 1-tetradecene, 1-hexadecene, and 1-octadecene. Of these, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-decene, and 1-dodecene are preferred. These olefins may be used singly or in combination of two or more speC1es.<br><br>
[0017]<br>
One possible method for produC1ng a-olefin oligomer in the presence of the metallocene catalyst will next be described.<br>
Firstly, a-olefin is polymerized in the presence of a metallocene catalyst, to thereby produce an a-olefin oligomer. The metallocene catalyst used in the polymerization is preferably a combination of a complex having a conjugated 5-membered carbon ring holding a periodic table Group 4 element (i.e. a metallocene complex) and an oxygen-containing organic aluminum compound. [0018]<br>
Examples of the periodic table Group 4 element contained in the metallocene complex include titanium, zirconium, and hafnium. Of these, zirconium is particularly preferred. The complex having a conjugated 5-membered carbon ring employed in the invention generally has a substituted or unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl ligand.<br>
An appropriate metallocene complex may be selected from known metallocene compounds.<br>
Examples of the metallocene complex include bis(n-octadecylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride, bis(trimethylsilylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride, bis(tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium dichloride, bis[(t-butyldimethylsilyl)cyclopentadienyl]zirconium dichloride, bis(di-t-butylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride, (ethylidene-bisindenyl)zirconium dichloride.<br><br>
biscyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride,<br>
ethylidenebis(tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium dichloride, and<br>
bis[3, 3(2-methyl-benzindenyl)]dimethylsilanediylzirconium<br>
dichloride.  These complexes may be used singly or in<br>
combination of two or more speC1es.<br>
[0019]<br>
Examples of the oxygen-containing organic aluminum compound include methylalmoxane, ethylalmoxane, and isobutylalmoxane. These compounds may be used singly or in combination of two or more speC1es.<br>
Oligomerization requires no particular solvent, and may be performed in a suspension, monomer liquid, or inert solvent. When oligomerization is performed in a solvent, benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, etc. are employed. Preferably, oligomerization is performed in a medium in which monomer liquid is excessive.<br>
As a post-treatment of oligomerization, the catalyst is deactivated through a known method, speC1fically, addition of water or alcohol thereto, or treatment with halogen-free aC1d, to thereby terminate oligomerization.<br>
a-Olefin isomers which are formed as by-products during oligomerization may be removed through stripping after oligomerization reaction. Alternatively, these olefin isomers may be removed, without separating oligomerization products, after hydrogenation and distillation of hydrogenated oligomer. [0020]<br><br>
The thus-treated oligomerization products are washed with an aqueous alkaline solution or an alcoholic alkaline solution, whereby the catalyst component is removed.<br>
The thus-produced a-olefin oligomers include a dimer, a trimer, and a tetramer.<br>
The a-olefin oligomers produced in the presence of a metallocene catalyst each have a double bond particularly<br>
with high end vinylidene double bond content.  The a-olefin hydrogenation products of the present invention have a saturation structure where double bonds contained before hydrogenation have been hydrogenated.<br>
In hydrogenation, known catalysts such as Ni-based or Co-based catalysts and noble metal catalysts (e.g., Pd and Pt) are employed.  SpeC1fic examples of such catalysts include an Ni-on-diatomaceous earth catalyst, a cobalt tris(acetylacetonate)/organic aluminum catalyst, a palladium-on-activated carbon catalyst, and a platinum-on-alumina catalyst.<br>
Hydrogenation is generally performed at 200°C or less. When an Ni-based catalyst is employed, the hydrogenation<br>
temperature is about 150 to about 200°C, whereas when a noble metal catalyst (e.g., Pd or Pt) is employed, the temperature<br>
is about 50 to about 150°C. When a homogeneous reduC1ng agent such as a cobalt tris(acetylacetonate)/organic aluminum<br>
is employed, the temperature is about 20 to about 100°C. Hydrogen pressure is generally ambient pressure to about 20 MPa.<br><br>
The thus-produced hydrogenation product is distillated, whereby a fraction having a desired kinematic viscosity is recovered.  The fraction is employed as a base oil of the present invention.<br>
Among these a-olefin oligomers, 1-hexene dimer, 1-octene dimer, 1-decene dimer, 1-dodecene dimer, and a mixture thereof are preferred as the low-viscosity base oil (A). The corresponding hydrogenation products are more preferred. Such oligomers as produced in the presence of a metallocene catalyst are particularly preferred. [0021]<br>
Examples of the synthetic alicyclic hydrocarbon compound include compounds having one or more cyclohexyl groups. Among them, such compounds each having 6 to 24 carbon atoms in total may be employed as the low-viscosity base oil (A).<br>
SpeC1fic examples of the low-viscosity base oil composed of such a synthetic alicyclic hydrocarbon compound<br>
include cyclohexane (kinematic viscosity at 40°C: 0.7 mm2/s), octylcyclohexane (1.5 mm2/s), dodecylcyclohexane (2.7 mm2/s), dibutylcyclohexane (1.6 mm2/s), and dihexylcyclohexane (2.6 mm2/s) . [0022]<br>
Examples of the synthetic aromatic hydrocarbon compound include compounds each having a linear-chain or branched-chain alkyl group on an aromatic ring.  The aromatic group may have one or more linear-chain alkyl groups, which may be<br><br>
identical to or different from one another. Among them, such compounds each having 7 to 24 carbon atoms in total may be employed as the low-viscosity base oil (A) .<br>
SpeC1fic examples of the low-viscosity base oil composed of such a synthetic aromatic hydrocarbon compound<br>
include toluene (kinematic viscosity at 40°C: 0.8 mm2/s), octylbenzene (1.6 mm2/s), dodecylbenzene (2.8 mm2/s) , dibutylbenzene (1.7 mm2/s), and dihexylbenzene (2.7 mm2/s). [0023]<br>
The oxygen-containing compound (3) or the sulfur-containing compound (4) is preferably at least one compound selected from among an ether compound, a thioether compound, a ketone compound, an alcohol compound, and a thioalcohol compound.<br>
Examples of the ether compound include a monoether compound, an oxyalkylene glycol derivative, and polyvinyl ether. [0024]<br>
The monoether compound may be a compound represented by, for example, formula (I):<br>
R1-O-R2   •••(!) (wherein each of R1 and R2 represents a C1 to C20 monovalent hydrocarbon group).<br>
Examples of the C1 to C20 monovalent hydrocarbon group represented by R1 or R2 in formula (I) include C1 to C20 linear-chain, branched-chain, and cyclic alkyl groups and alkenyl groups, C6 to C20 aryl groups, and C7 to C20 aralkyl<br><br>
groups.  R1 and R2 may be identical to or different from each other.<br>
Among them, compounds represented by formula (I) each having 4 to 24 carbon atoms in total are preferably employed as the low-viscosity base oil (A). [0025]<br>

Both cases are not preferred. The refrigerating machine oil composition of the present invention can be employed in a variety of<br><br>
refrigerating machines and particularly preferably to a compression-refrigeration cycle in a compression-type refrigerator. [0051]<br>
The refrigerating machine to which the refrigerating machine oil composition of the present invention is applied employs a refrigeration cycle essentially including a compressor, a condenser, an expansion mechanism (e.g., expansion valves), an evaporator, or including a compressor, a condenser, an expansion mechanism, a drier, and an evaporator.

Preferably, the drier is filled with a desiccant composed of zeolite having a pore size of 0.33 nm or less. Examples of the zeolite include natural zeolite and synthetic zeolite.  Preferably, the zeolite has a CO2 gas absorption<br>

The refrigerating machine oil composition of the present invention contains, as a base oil, a mixed base oil composed of at least one speC1es selected from among a mineral oil, a synthetic hydrocarbon compound, an oxygen-containing compound, and a sulfur-containing compound, and having a predetermined viscosity. Thus, the refrigerating machine oil composition exhibits enhanced energy saving performance by virtue of its low viscosity, and has excellent sealing performance and load resistance.

the test sample had been maintained at 175°C for 30 days, the appearance of the oil and catalyst and sludge formation were observed, and the aC1d value was determined.<br>
(5)	Oil retention test<br>
An SPCC plate (80x60 mm) was immersed in a test oil so<br><br>
as to cover the surfaces of the plate with the oil. Subsequently, the plate was maintained in an upright posture for 24 hours at room temperature, and the amount (g) of oil remaining on the plate was measured. The larger the amount of oil, the more excellent the oil layer retention characteristics. (6) Comparison of sealing performance<br>
