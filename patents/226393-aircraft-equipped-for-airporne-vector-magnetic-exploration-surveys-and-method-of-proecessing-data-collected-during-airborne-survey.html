				<td>AIRCRAFT EQUIPPED FOR AIRBORNE VECTOR MAGNETIC EXPLORATION<br>
SURVEYS AND METHOD OF PROCESSING DATA COLLECTED DURING<br>
AIRBORNE SURVEY<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention concerns an aircraft equipped for airborne vector magnetic<br>
exploration surveys. It also concerns a method of processing vector magnetic data<br>
collected during a survey flight of the aircraft.<br>
Background Art<br>
Standard airborne magnetic surveys are performed with sensors that measure<br>
the total magnetic intensity (TMI) which is the magnitude of the total magnetic field<br>
vector. The total field is assumed to comprise the earth's field added to a local field<br>
dependent on the geology. Survey areas are sufficiently small that the earth's field may<br>
be assumed constant and so all variations are due to the geology. In practice one<br>
subtracts the magnitude of the earth's field from the measured values to obtain the local<br>
field.<br>
Of course, this practice is incorrect because it fails to allow for the fact that the<br>
magnetic field is a vector field. The simple subtraction of magnitudes is only correct<br>
when the two vectors (earth field and local field) are parallel. In general, remanence<br>
and anisotropy mean that parallelism is rarely achieved, however, for local fields that<br>
are small compared to the earth's field and close to parallel with it, the simple<br>
subtraction is a reasonable approximation.<br>
In situations wbere the remanent magnetic field is comparable in size to the<br>
earth's field and in a variety of directions, the assumption is unreliable. The<br>
breakdown of this assumption will also affect fields derived from the TMI such as the<br>
reduced-to-pole (RTP) and first vertical derivative (1VD) fields.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention is an aircraft equipped for airborne vector magnetic exploration surveys,<br>
comprising :<br>
a gravity gradiometer having an inertial navigation system comprising two rotation sensors<br>
mounted to measure the angular orientation of the aircraft ;<br>
three magnetometers orthogonally mounted to measure the components of the earth's vector<br>
magnetic field; and<br>
a recording system to record the measurements of the magnetometers and rotation sensors;<br>
whers<br>
the measured angular orientation is used to orientate the measured components of the earth's<br><br>
vector magnetic field, to derive true vector magnetic data from airborne surveys, that is vector aero-<br>
magnetic (VAM) data.<br>
In such a VAM system, the processing may be done in real time in the aircraft<br>
during a survey flight, or after the flight has taken place, in the laboratory.<br>
The three magnetometers may be flux-gate magnetometers, each measuring the<br>
component of the earth's vector magnetic field along its axis, so that the triad is able to<br>
measure all three orthogonal components.<br>
The rotation sensors may be gyroscopes which measure heading, bank and elevation.<br>
The attitude of the aircraft may be recorded to a precision which should allow<br>
the magnetic vector components to be corrected to better than 10 nT. This compares<br>
favourably with uncorrected data, where for instance, in the earth's field of about<br>
60 000 nT, an orientation change of 6 degrees can produce a magnetic vector<br>
component error of about 10% or 6 000 nT.<br>
In a further aspect the invention is a method of processing data collected during<br>
an airborne survey described above, comprising the following steps:<br>
collecting data describing the orientation (attitude) of the aircraft using one or<br>
more rotation sensors (gyroscopes mounted on a gravity gradiometer platform);<br>
collecting vector magnetic field data using a triad of magnetometers<br>
orthogonally mounted (flux-gate) in the aircraft; and<br>
using the aircraft attitude data provided by the rotation sensors to orient the<br>
magnetometer data; and<br>
then deriving true vector aero-magnetics.<br>
The method involves the rotation of the 3 magnetic field components from the aircraft<br>
reference frame to the earth's reference frame using a program called vectorMagTilt,<br>
and a heading correction using a program called VectorMagHeadingCorrection. The<br>
required parameters for the correction are computed using a program called<br>
vectorMagCalibrate on the calibration survey data. The residual noise in the data after<br>
the heading correction is still high, but the processed VAM data still provides a useful<br>
adjunct to the TMI data for mapping and interpretation in areas of strong remanence<br>
(for instance, over strongly magnetised geology such as banded iron formations).<br><br>
The method for processing for processing VAM data, may further comprise any<br>
one or more of the steps of:<br>
removing the permanent magnet effect of the aircraft from the magnetic data;<br>
removing the induced magnetic effect of the aircraft from the magnetic data;<br>
and<br>
removing the eddy-current magnetic effect of the aircraft from the magnetic<br>
data.<br>
The formulas for the permanent magnet effect, induced magnetic effect and<br>
eddy-current magnetic effect of the aircraft may be based on Leliak (1961)1.<br>
The technique may first involve ignoring the eddy-current effects and solving<br>
for the factors for the permanent magnet and induced magnetic dipole fields. The<br>
permanent magnet and induced magnetic fields may then be computed and removed<br>
from the survey data.<br>
The eddy-current factors may then be computed from a high-pass filtered<br>
version of the corrected data. Alternatively, the eddy-current factors may be derived<br>
line-by-line on the survey data by a regression process.<br>
Furthermore, the data after corrections of permanent magnet, induced magnetic<br>
and eddy-current effects may go through a residual angle effect correction by<br>
regression. The final corrected data are then written to the survey database.<br>
Use of this aspect of the invention provides a significant reduction of the noise<br>
in the VAM data. Data processing results show excellent performance of the new<br>
technique in noise reduction.<br>

subtracting a constant vector from the observed vector magnetic components. Whilst<br>
the inclination and the declination of the magnetic vector is typically confined to a<br>
narrow angular range, the residual magnetic vector typically has inclination and<br>
declination values covering the entire angular range.<br>

Best Modes of the Invention<br>
The aircraft 10 carries on board an airborne gravity gradiometer (AGG)<br>
platform 11, a TMI sensor 12 to measure the total magnetic intensity, a triad of<br>
orthogonally mounted flux-gate magnetometers 13 to provide vector magnetic field<br>
data, and gyroscopes 14 mounted on the AGG platform 11 to continuously monitor and<br>
record the orientation (attitude) of the aircraft. The attitude information is used to<br>
control the platform and for laser scanner processing and self-gradient corrections of<br>
the AGG data.<br>
The vector magnetic data has three components corresponding to the field<br>
magnitude in each of three orthogonal directions. This allows a wide variety of<br>
combinations to be formed and mapped. Examples include the components in each of<br>
the directions North, East and Down; the magnitude of the horizontal component; the<br>
inclination and declination angles; the TMI and the vector residual magnetic intensity<br>
(VRMI). The TMI should be the same as that measured by the TMI sensor and the<br>
difference can be taken as a measure of the vector noise. The VRMI is the magnitude<br>
of the vector formed by subtracting the earth's vector magnetic field, for example as<br>
specified by the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF), from the measured<br>
vector field. The VRMI is thus the intensity of the local field and should represent the<br>
magnitude of the magnetisation (remanent plus induced) of the local geological<br>
sources.<br>
Computer software is used to process VAM data. One computer program,<br>
vectorMagTilt, converts the VAM data from an LTV (Longitudinal, Transversal,<br>
Vertical) aircraft-based coordinate system to a NED (North, East, Down) world-based<br>
coordinate system. Another, vectorMagCalibrate, computes the heading correction<br><br>
coefficients for the NED vector magnetic components. Bank and elevation correction<br>
may be similarly provided. The coefficients are subsequently to be used by a third<br>
program, vectorMagHeadingCorrection, to correct the raw NED vector magnetic<br>
component data for aircraft heading effects, and thence to compute relevant vector<br>
magnetic: field attributes from the heading-corrected data, such as horizontal magnetic<br>
component H, inclination INC, and declination DEC. This program also computes<br>
residual magnetic properties by subtraction of a constant vector contribution.<br>
The algorithm reads the LTV magnetic components, along with aircraft attitude<br>
data (heading-angle, elevation-angle, and bank-angle), and converts the LTV aircraft-<br>
based reading to a NED world coordinate system, through the following transformation<br>
process:<br>
The vector magnetic flux gate sensors are located in the rear of the aircraft<br>
stinger, and record the magnetic field in three orthogonal directions: L (longitudinal), T<br>
(transversal), and V (vertical)<br>
The LTV directions are assumed fixed with respect to the aircraft and are<br>
defined as follows:<br>
The LTV directions are orthogonal and form a right-hand coordinate system.<br>
The L direction is pointing towards the aft of the aircraft.<br>
The T direction points M degrees upward towards starboard. M is assumed to<br>
be 45 degrees.<br>
The V direction points M degrees upward towards port. M is assumed to be 45<br>
degrees.<br>
The heading angle H is the aircraft heading in degrees positive clockwise from<br>
North. Fig. 2 depicts a northwesterly heading, and consequently a heading angle of<br>
approximately -45 or +315 degrees.<br>
The elevation angle E is the angle of the aircraft pitch with respect to horizontal.<br>
The elevation angle is defined as positive up and negative down. Fig. 2 depicts an<br>
upward pitch and thus a positive elevation angle.<br>
The bank angle B is the angle of the aircraft roll with respect to the starboard<br>
wing. The bank angle is defined as positive for a bank to starboard and negative for a<br>
bank to port. Fig. 2 depicts a bank to port, and thus a negative bank angle.<br>
The conversion of vector magnetic readings from an aircraft-based LTV<br>
coordinate system to a world-based NED coordinate system is achieved as follows:<br>
First, the contribution from each of the LTV components to the N component:<br><br>
The L component projected onto N is:<br>
cos(H +180) . cos(E) -L = - cos(H) • cos(£) • L<br>
The T component projected onto N is:<br>
cos(H + 180)- sin(E) • cos(90 -(M~B))•T + sin( H +180) • cos(M - B) • T<br>
= - cos(H) sin(E) • sin(M -B)•T- sin(H) cos(M -B)-T<br>
The V component projected onto N is:<br>
cos(H +180) • sin(E) • cos(M -B)•V + sin(H +180) • cos(90 + (M ~ B)) V<br>
= - cos(H) sin(E) • cos(M -B)V- sin(H) (-sin(M - B)) • V<br>
= -cos(H) • sin(E) • cos(M -B)•V + sin(H) • sin(M - B) • V<br>
Hence the total contribution of the LTV components in the N direction is:<br>
N = -cos(H) • {cos(E) • X + sin(E) • [sin(M -B)•T + cos(M - B) •V]}<br>
+ sin(H) • {- cos(M -B)T + sin(M -B)V}<br>
Then, the contribution from each of the LTV components to the E component:<br>
The L component projected onto E is:<br>
cos(H + 90) • cos(E) •L = - sin(H) • cos(E) • L<br>
The T component projected onto E is:<br>
cos( H + 90) • sin(E) • cos(90 -(M-B))•T + sin(H + 90) • cos(M - B) • T<br>
= - sin(H) • sin(E) • sin(M -B) • T + cos(H) • cos(M -B)•T<br>
The V component projected onto E is:<br>
cos(H + 90) • sin(E) • cos(M -B)V + sin(H + 90) • cos(90 + (M - B)) • V<br>
= -sin(H)sin(E)•cos(M -B)V + cos(H)(-sin(M -B)) V<br>
= - sin(H) • sin(E) • cos(M - B) • V - cos(H) • sin(M - B) • V<br><br>
Hence the total contribution of the LTV components in the E direction is:<br>
E = - sin(H) • {cos(E) • L + sin(E) • [sin(M- B) • T + cos(M -B)V]}<br>
+ cos(H){cos(M -B)•T- sin(M-B)•V)<br>
Then, the contribution from each of the LTV components to the D component<br>
The L component projected onto D is:<br>
sin(E)•L<br>
The T component projected onto D is:<br>
-cos(E)-sin(M-B)T<br>
The V component projected onto D is:<br>
-cos(E)cos(M-B)V<br>
Hence the total contribution of the LTV components in the D direction is:<br>
D = sin(E) • L- cos(E) -[sin(M-B)•T + cos(M- B) • V]<br>
This example is based on the assumption that the LTV coordinate system is<br>
perfectly aligned with the aircraft coordinate system. That is, that the L-axis aligns<br>
perfectly with the aircraft longitudinal axis, and not with the stinger longitudinal axis.<br>
(The stinger is mounted with a slight positive pitch with respect to aircraft axis). In<br>
practice, there will often be a small angular displacement between the LTV coordinate<br>
system defined by the three fluxgates and the aircraft coordinate system referenced by<br>
the heading, elevation and bank angles. The vectorMagTilt program therefore<br>
includes offset angles to correct for this angular displacement. The offset angles will<br>
vary between aircraft and vectorMagTilt allows for their adjustment as required.<br>
vectorMagCalibrate is used on vector magnetic calibration flights, which are<br>
performed at the start of each AGG campaign. The calibration flight consists of eight<br>
flight lines flown at high altitude (preferably more than 3000 ft above the ground). The<br>
lines are all flown at the same altitude The lines are flown in the eight headings 0°,<br>
45", 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, and 315°. The lines should each be at least 3 km long<br>
and they should all intersect at the same point, roughly at the halfway mark for each<br><br>
line. The survey essentially forms a star or a pizza with 4 pair-wise parallel flight lines<br>
(for example at headings 0° and 180°, 45° and 225°, 90° and 270°, 135° and 315°). The<br>
heading correction coefficients are output to screen at the end of the program<br>
execution.<br>
The program first determines all the intersections of the calibration lines. Once<br>
al the intersections have been determined the algorithm determines the average<br>
position of the intersections, and outputs the statistics on how well the pilots managed<br>
have all the calibration lines intersect at one central point.<br>
Having determined a central intersection point the program now extracts the<br>
attitude (heading-, elevation-, and bank-angle) and vector magnetic components (NED)<br>
from the database at the central intersection point for each of the calibration line.<br>
The extracted data may be used to verify the heading-angle dependency of the<br>
uncorrected NED data, or how well the subsequent sine-function fitting has performed.<br>
The algorithm now attempts to fit a scaled sine function of the heading angle to<br>
each of the NED components. The functions to fit are:<br>
NOBS ≈ CN,1 sin( head _ angle - CN,2) + CN,1<br>
EOBS ≈ CE,1 sin(head _ angle - CE,2) + CE,3<br>
DOBS ≈ CD,1 sin(head_ang!e-CD,2) + CD,3<br>
Note that currently no corrections are being applied for bank- and elevation-angle<br>
effects.<br>
Having established the coefficients CN,1, CN,2,CN,1, etc., we can at a later stage<br>
perform the heading correction as:<br>
NOBS,corr ≈ NOBS - CN,1 . sin(heod _ angle - CN,2 )<br>
EOBS,corr ≈EOBS -CE,1 .sin(head_angle-CE,2)<br>
DOBS,corr ≈ DOBS -CD,1 . sin(head_angle - CD,2)<br>
Once the algorithm has computed the correction coefficients the estimated main<br>
magnetic field strength, inclination and declination are output for checking purposes.<br>
The estimated main magnetic field inclination and declination values will usually be<br>
within 3 degrees of the associated IGRF values for the calibration site location.<br>
Having determined the correction coefficients the algorithm displays these on<br>
screen. The data is presented in a format that is appropriate for cut-and-paste insertion<br><br>
into the parameter file for vectorMagHeadingCorrection<br>
This example does not attempt to incorporate bank-angle or elevation-angle into<br>
the correction model. It only uses attitude and vector magnetic information from the<br>
central intersection point, as it is assumed that the magnetic value should remain<br>
unchanged over this given point irrespective of the aircraft heading.<br>
vectorMagHeadingCorrection is used to process VAM data<br>
The correction coefficients to be applied in the heading correction process are<br>
those computed and output by the program vectorMagCalibrate<br>
The heading correction is achieved by subtracting a scaled, phase-shifted sine<br>
function of the heading angle from the individual NED vector magnetic components<br>
NOBS,corr ≈ NOBS - CN,1 . sin(H - CN,2 )<br>
EOBS,corr ≈ EOBS - CE,1 . sin(H - CE,2 )<br>
DOBS,corr ≈ DOBS - CD,1 . sin(H - CD,2 )<br>
The correction coefficients CN,1, CN,2, CE,2, etc. are output by the program<br>
vectorMagCalibrate to screen, and must be specified in the parameter file for<br>
vectorMagHeadingCorrection. The screen output from vectorMagCalibrate is presented<br>
in a format that is appropriate for cut-and-paste insertion into the parameter file for<br>
vectorMagHeadingCorrection.<br>
The algorithm reads the raw NED vector magnetic component data, along with<br>
aircraft attitude data (heading-angle, elevation-angle, and bank-angle), and corrects the<br>
raw NED vector magnetic component data for aircraft heading effects by subtracting<br>
the scaled and phase-shifted sine-functions (above).<br>
Having completed the heading correction, vectorMagHeadingCorrection<br>
computes relevant vector magnetic field attributes from the heading-corrected data,<br>
such as horizontal magnetic component H, inclination INC, and declination DEC.<br>
Fig. 3 depicts the various vector magnetic components and attributes associated<br>
with a magnetic field M. From Fig. 3 we get that the horizontal magnetic vector<br>
component H is computed as:<br><br>
The magnetic inclination INC is computed as:<br><br><br>
The magnetic declination DEC is computed as:<br><br>
In addition to the "standard" vector magnetic attributes<br>
vectorMagHeadingCorrection also computes the residual magnetic attributes by first<br>
completing a subtraction of a constant vector contribution from the heading corrected<br>
NED vector magnetic components The option exists to subtract either the survey-wide<br>
averages of the NED vector magnetic components, or to subtract the NED vector<br>
magnetic components derived from the vector magnetic calibration flight.<br>
Surveys have been flown over a variety of formations. A comparison of the<br>
total magnetic intensity (TMI) data with the intensity of the residual vector magnetic<br>
(VRMI) data showed very similar results for weakly remanent formation but<br>
significantly different results for more strongly remanent formations. This<br>
demonstrated that the vector magnetic results are able to provide improved data for<br>
prospecting.<br>
There are also a variety of effects which cause varying magnetic fields from the<br>
aircraft itself In particular, ferro-magnetic parts of the aircraft will have a magnetic<br>
field induced from the earth's main field which will change as the orientation of those<br>
parts varies relative to the earth's field; electrical conductors will have eddy currents<br>
generated leading to the production of secondary fields; and remanently magnetised<br>
parts of the aircraft, producing constant magnetic field components in the aircraft-based<br>
LTV coordinate system, will generate changing magnetic fields in the NED coordinate<br>
system as the aircraft changes orientation.<br>
These particular effects which depend on aircraft orientation can be written as<br>
functions of the orientation angles heading, bank and elevation provided by our rotation<br>
sensors. In practice, poor knowledge of the physical properties of each relevant aircraft<br>
part, limited knowledge of their position and motion and the high complexity of the<br>
total system may make this impractical. However, it is possible to use linear regression<br>
of the measured VAM data against the angular variables to estimate the coefficients of<br>
the linear terms of these functions; vector aero-magnetic compensation.<br><br>
The main steps are:<br>
a)	identify the key regressors using data collected on a calibration flight;<br>
b)	estimate the regressor coefficients (the sensitivity of each component to<br>
each regressor) by standard linear regression; and<br>
c)	correct survey VAM data by subtraction of the effects calculated as the<br>
product of each coefficient against each regressor.<br>
An additional technique is based on the principle of removing the permanent<br>
magnet effect, induced magnetic effect and eddy-current magnetic effect of the aircraft<br>
from the magnetic data. This technique has been implemented in processing software<br>
using two computer programs, a modified vectorMagCalibrate program and a new code<br>
vectorMagCorrections. Only a single program vectorMagCorrections needs to be run to<br>
process vector magnetic data on a survey. Prior to processing vector magnetic data, the<br>
processing parameters will need to be computed by vectorMagCalibrate on calibration<br>
survey data.<br>
The derivation of formulas for removing the permanent magnet effect, induced<br>
magnetic effect and eddy-current magnetic effect of the aircraft is based on the model<br>
of Leliak (1961) and is given below.<br>
The measured magnetic field M is composed of the earth's field H (including<br>
ore-body effect), the permanent magnet field of the aircraft A, the induced magnetic<br>
field of the aircraft I, and the eddy-current magnetic field E. Hence<br>
M=H + A + I + E<br>
In the aircraft reference frame, these are three equations at each observation<br>
point for the three magnetic field components,<br>
ML = HL + AL + IL + EL	(1)<br>
MT = HT + AT+IT + ET	(2)<br>
MV = HV + AV + IV + EV	(3)<br>
At the interception point of the eight calibration lines, the earth's main field is<br>
known (the IGRF field or that calculated in vectorMagCalibrate) in the earth's NED<br>
reference frame. Thus, the LTV components HL, HT, and HV can be calculated by<br>
rotation with the known aircraft attitude information.<br><br>
The permanent magnet field components AL, AT, and AV are constants that are<br>
independent of aircraft attitude.<br>
The L component of the induced magnetic field of the aircraft at the sensor is<br>
IL = HL.LL+ HT.TL + Hv.VL	(4)<br>
where LL is the magnetic field in L direction due to induced magnetic dipoles in the L<br>
direction for an unit inducing field, TL is the magnetic field in L direction due to<br>
induced magnetic dipoles in the T direction for an unit inducing field, and VL is the<br>
magnetic field in L direction due to induced magnetic dipoles in the V direction for an<br>
unit inducing field.<br>
Similarly, the T component of the induced magnetic field of the aircraft at the<br>
sensor is<br>
IT = HL.LT+ HT.TT + Hv.VT	(5)<br>
and the V component of the induced magnetic field of the aircraft at the sensor is<br>
IV = HLLV+ HT.TV + Hv.VV	(6)<br>
Here, (LL, TL, VL, LT, TT, VT, LV, TV, W) are only dependent on the<br>
dimension, shape, and susceptibility of the parts of the aircraft body, but independent of<br>
the orientation of the aircraft.<br>
The eddy-current magnetic field is produced by eddy currents in the aircraft<br>
body. A change of magnetic flux through a conducting loop will generate a current<br>
proportional to the time derivative of the flux in the loop. This current will produce a<br>
secondary magnetic field opposing the change in the magnetic flux. As the aircraft hull<br>
effectively consists of conducting loops of aluminium, these loops will experience a<br>
change in magnetic flux as the aircraft changes direction in the earth's magnetic field.<br>
These current loops will generate a secondary magnetic field measurable as the eddy-<br>
cunent field at the sensor. The L component of the eddy-current field can be written as<br><br>
where 11 is the magnetic field in L direction due to eddy-current magnetic dipoles in the<br>
L direction for an unit inducing field, tl is the magnetic field in L direction due to eddy-<br><br>
current magnetic dipoles in the T direction for an unit inducing field, and VL is the<br>
magnetic field in L direction due to eddy-current magnetic dipoles in the V direction<br>
for an unit inducing field. Similarly,<br><br>
Here, (11, tl, vl, It, tt, vt, lv, tv, w) are only dependent on the dimension, shape,<br>
and electrical conductivities of the parts of the aircraft body forming the conductive<br>
loops, but independent of the orientation of the aircraft.<br>
Substituting equations (4)-(9) into equations (1), (2) and (3), we obtain<br><br>
Using Leliak's (1961) model as encapsulated in equations (10)-(12), we can<br>
solve for the 24 unknowns (AL, AT, AV), (LL, TL, VL, LT, TT, VT, LV, TV, W),<br>
and (11, tl, vl, It, tt, vt, lv, tv, w) from the calibration survey data as follows. At the<br>
intersection point of the calibration lines, we can set up the equations (10)-(12) for each<br>
line Since there are eight calibration lines, we have a total of 24 equations. In theory<br>
we should be able to solve for the 24 unknowns from these 24 equations. However,<br>
since the magnitude of eddy-current magnetic field is much smaller than the permanent<br>
magnetic and induced magnetic fields, direct solutions of equations (10)-(12) do not<br>
yield good solutions for (11, tl, vl, It, tt, vt, lv, tv, w). In practice, we first ignore the<br>
eddy-current terms and solve for the 12 (AL, AT, Av) and (LL, TL, VL, LT, TT, VT,<br>
LV, TV, W) factors for the permanent magnet and induced magnetic dipoles. The<br>
permanent magnet and induced magnetic fields are then computed and removed from<br>
the calibration survey data. The eddy-current factors are computed from high-pass<br>
. filtered versions of the corrected data. All the 24 factors are computed from a modified<br><br>
version of the vectorMagCalibrate program. VectorMagCalibrate also output corrected<br>
data to the calibration survey database.<br>
All these factors are input parameters to the vectorMagCorrections program. In<br>
the current implementation of vectorMagCorrections, the eddy-current factors derived<br>
by vectorMagCalibrate are not used. Instead, new eddy-current factors are derived line-<br>
oy-line on the survey data by a regression process. Furthermore, the data after<br>
corrections of permanent magnet, induced magnetic and eddy-current effects go<br>
through a residual angle effect correction by regression. The final corrected data are<br>
then written to the survey database.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a comparison of the data from vectorMagHeadingCorrection and<br>
ttie data from vectorMagCorrections on a line of survey data. A visual inspection<br>
suggests a noise reduction improvement of a factor between 3 to 10. The improvement<br>
using the new technique for vector magnetic data processing is obvious.<br>
Fig. 6a and 6b shows a comparison of the vectorMagneticResiduallntensity<br>
(VMRI) of data from vectorMagHeadingCorrection and vectorMagCorrections. The<br>
VMRI is the magnitude of the residual magnetic vector after subtracting the vector<br>
IGRF earth field from the data. The improvement using the new technique for vector<br>
magnetic data processing is obvious as shown in Fig. 6a and 6b.<br>
It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations<br>
and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific<br>
embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly<br>
described. The present embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects as<br>
illustrative and not restrictive.<br><br>
