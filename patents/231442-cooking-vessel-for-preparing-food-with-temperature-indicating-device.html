				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a food cooking vessel for preparing food with<br>
temperature indicating devices.<br>
In using pots, it would be useful, both during and after the cooking step, to<br>
indicate that the pot has achieved a set temperature, and that the portions<br>
thereof are hot thereby allowing the user to take precautions against burns<br>
Pots or frying pans having at a central position at their bottom, a<br>
thermochromatic pigment containing coating indicating, by a color change, that<br>
the bottom has achieved a set temperature, are already commercially known.<br>
However, this prior solution has the drawback that it indicates only and<br>
exclusively the temperature corresponding to the central region of the pot<br>
bottom, but not that of pot outer regions.<br>
Moreover, with the food arranged n the pot, this chromatic indication cannot be<br>
seen, since the food being cooked covers the thermochromatic pigment coating.<br>
Another prior art approach provides to use a thermosensitive liquid crystal<br>
device, the liquid crystals of which are embedded in the pot handle, which<br>
handle is for example made of a plastic material and projects from the pot body<br>
or vessel.<br>
This prior thermosensitive liquid crystal device provides a 	<br><br>
temperature indication, which, even in this case, is measured at the inner<br>
regions of the vessel. Such prior device, however, is very complex and<br>
expensive and moreover, is susceptible to be easily degraded in operation,<br>
because of the high temperature of the cooking regions or the moisture and heat<br>
present inside a dishwasher.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the aim of the present invention is to overcome the above<br>
mentioned drawbacks of the prior art and provide a food cooking vessel including<br>
an improved means for signaling the achieved temperature, said means being<br>
adapted to be arranged outside the vessel and applied, by unexpensive methods,<br>
on outer portions thereof.<br>
This aim is achieved by a food cooking vessel, characterized in that said food<br>
cooking vessel comprises constructional components, arranged outside said<br>
cooking vessel, said constructional components being coated by a coating layer<br>
containing thermochromatic pigments.<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings.<br>
Further characteristics of the inventon will become more apparent hereinafter<br>
from the following disclosure.<br>
The present invention will be disclosed and illustrated<br><br>
obviously comprise other cooking containers or vessels, such<br>
as, for example, fraying pans, stewpans and like containers or<br>
vessels.<br>
The outer constructional parts of the vessel 1 are provided<br>
with coating layers containing thermochromatic pigments<br>
having a variable thermal sensitivity.<br>
Such a coating will further comprise pigments which,<br>
depending on the achieved temperature, will change their<br>
colors, for example from a starting black color (as the vessel 1<br>
is at environment temperature) to a red or red-orange color, as<br>
the vessel is heated for example to the cooking temperature,<br>
which can vary from 150°C to 240°C.<br>
Thermochromatic pigment containing coatings are known in<br>
the prior art, and are made, for example, by the firm Keystone.<br>
Figure 1 shows different manners for detecting and indicating<br>
the temperature of the inside of the vessel 1.<br>
Thus, for example, the body of the fire stop tubular device 4<br>
can be coated, before assembling it by the plate 3, by a<br>
thermochromatic pigment holding coating layer 5.<br>
It would be also possible to arrange the thermochromatic<br>
pigment holding coating at any other technically suitable<br>
places.<br>
A further possibility would be to provide the handle 2 with a<br>
thermochromatic pigment holding coating 6 and, finally, it<br>
would be also possible to apply, by glueing it on the fire stop<br><br>
obviously comprise other cooking containers or vessels, such<br>
as, for example, fraying pans, stewpans and like containers or<br>
vessels.<br>

colors, for example from a starting black color (as the vessel 1<br>

which can vary from 150°C to 240°C.<br>
Thermochromatic pigment containing coatings are known in<br>
the prior art, and are made, for example, by the firm Keystone.<br>
Figure 1 shows different manners for detecting and indicating<br>
the temperature of the inside of the vessel 1.<br>
Thus, for example, the body of the fire stop tubular device 4<br>
can be coated, before assembling it by the plate 3, by a<br>
thermochromatic pigment holding coating layer 5.<br>
It would be also possible to arrange the thermochromatic<br>
pigment holding coating at any other technically suitable<br>
places.<br>
A further possibility would be to provide the handle 2 with a<br>
thermochromatic pigment holding coating 6 and, finally, it<br>
would be also possible to apply, by glueing it on the fire stop<br><br>
body 4, or on the handle 2, a label 7 coated by a<br>
thermochromatic pigment holding layer.<br>
Such a label 7 would provide the advantage that, after a given<br>
period of use of the vessel 1, and upon deteriorating the<br>
thermochromatic pigment, the label 7 could be removed and<br>
replaced by a new one.<br>
Moreover, said labels provide the advantage that they can be<br>
series made at a low cost and can be quickly and easily<br>
applied.<br>
Moreover, said thermochromatic pigment holding labels can<br>
have different patterns, for a better disposal of thereof. As<br>
shown in figure 2, the label 7 has a circular configuration,<br>
whereas a label 8 can have a square configuration and a label<br>
9, for example, a triangular configuration.<br>
The different configurations of said labels 7, 8 and 9 allow<br>
moreover to make and facilitate the use of different thermal<br>
sensitivity labels. Thus, for example, a label could comprise<br>
thermochromatic pigments changing their colors at<br>
temperatures of about 80-100°C.<br>
A further label can have a coating changing its color at a<br>
temperature of about 150°C and yet another label could hold<br>
therein a thermochromatic pigmentation changing its color<br>
starting from 180°C to 240°C, and this only to provide some<br>
examples.<br>
The great advantage provided by the present invention should<br><br>
be envisaged in the fact that the thermal indicating means are<br>
arranged inside the vessel. The indicating coating can be<br>
applied on different outer components of the vessel, for<br>
example on the projecting fire stop body, on the fire stop body<br>
mounting plate or directly on the handle, fitted in the tubular<br>
body of the fire stop body or device.<br>
It would also be possible to apply to adjoining regions said<br>
thermochromatic pigment holding coatings, which would be<br>
sensitive to different temperatures.<br>
In a particularly advantageous manner, the thermal indicating<br>
or signalling coating is applied by a spraying type of applying<br>
method.<br>
It would be furthermore advantageous to apply said<br>
thermochromatic pigment holding coating by a screen printing<br>
method.<br>
Moreover, it has been found as advantageous to apply the<br>
thermal signalling or indicating pigment holding layer by a<br>
buffering system and, finally, it would be also advantageous<br>
and possible to apply the thermochromatic pigment holding<br>
coating layer by using transfer printing methods.<br><br>
