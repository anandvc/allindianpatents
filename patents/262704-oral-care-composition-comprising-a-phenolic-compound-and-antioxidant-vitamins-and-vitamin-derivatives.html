				<td>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims the benefit of the prior filed United States Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/632,480, filed 2 December 2004, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]        Many phenolic compounds possess both antibacterial and antiinflammatory properties, and are known to be useful as antibacterial and/or antiinflammatory agents in oral care compositions such as mouthwashes and dentifrices. Examples of such phenolic compounds include carvacrol, eugenol (thoxyphenol), 4-hexylresorcinol (4-hexyl-l,3-dihydroxybenzene), bromochlorophene (2,2'-methylene bis(4-chloro-6-bromophenol)), thymol (2-isopropyl-5-methylphenol) and triclosan (5-chloro-2- (2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol).<br>
[0002]        Additionally, antioxidants have been proposed as ingredients of oral care compositions, for example as stabilizing agents operating by protecting readily oxidizable ingredients from oxidative degradation, and/or as agents to enhance oral and/or whole body health. Compounds disclosed as components of oral care compositions and described as antioxidants have included ascorbic acid (vitamin C), ß-carotene, folic acid, α-lipoic acid (thioctic acid), lycopene, lutein (xanthophyll), niacin (nicotinamide and/or nicotinic acid), retinol (vitamin A), riboflavin (vitamin B2), rutin, a-tocopherol or vitamin E, 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid, and ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10). Such antioxidants are not reported to have any effect on the anti-inflammatory properties of dentifrices containing phenolic compounds.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] There is now provided an oral care composition according to claim 1. Preferred features are defined in the dependent claims.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]     An "antibacterial phenolic compound" herein is a compound having a phenol moiety as part of its molecular structure, and exhibiting antibacterial activity when present in an oral care composition in an orally acceptable amount.<br>
[0005]     A "vitamin or vitamin derivative" herein is a compound that is a vitamin and/or has vitamin-like activity, including natural and synthetic vitamins as well as vitamin analogs, derivatives, precursors, esters, salts, isomers, racemates, enantiomers, tautomers and the like. A "source" of a vitamin herein can be the vitamin itself, a vitamin or vitamin derivative that upon administration to an oral surface generates or releases the vitamin on the oral surface and/or in an underlying tissue, or that otherwise exhibits vitamin activity characteristic of the vitamin. A "multivitamin or vitamin derivative complex" herein means a plurality of vitamin or vitamin derivatives.<br>
[0006]     Except where the context demands otherwise, the term "vitamin E" is used genetically herein to encompass any tocopherol or tocotriene compound, including any enantiomer or racemate thereof, and any mixture of such compounds, having vitamin E activity.<br>
[0007]     When a "total" amount in a composition of "at least one" component that is a member of a specified class {e.g., the class of antibacterial phenolic compounds or the class of antioxidant vitamin or vitamin derivatives) is recited herein, it will be understood that the amount referred to is the total of the individual amounts of all members of the class present in the composition. Concentrations of ingredients herein are expressed by weight except as may otherwise be indicated.<br>
[0008]     A step of "applying" a composition to an oral surface herein encompasses any procedure that results in the composition contacting the surface, including irrigating, rinsing, spraying, wiping, rubbing, brushing, painting, flossing, placement of a film or strip on the surface, implanting and chewing.<br>
[0009]     The term "inhibiting" herein with respect to a condition such as<br>
inflammation in an oral tissue encompasses prevention, suppression, reduction in extent or severity, or amelioration of the condition.<br>
[0010]      An oral care composition of the present invention can take any physical form suitable for application to an oral surface. In various illustrative embodiments the composition can be a liquid solution suitable for irrigating, rinsing or spraying; a dentifrice such as a powder, toothpaste or dental gel; a periodontal gel a liquid suitable for painting a dental surface (e.g., a liquid whitener); a chewing gum; a dissolvable, partially dissolvable or non-dissolvable film or strip (e.g., a whitening strip); a wafer; a wipe or towelette; an implant; a dental floss; etc. The composition can contain active and/or carrier ingredients additional to those recited above.<br>
[0011] In certain embodiments the composition is adapted for application to an oral surface of a small domestic animal, for example a cat or a dog. Such a composition is typically edible or chewable by the animal, and can take the form, for example, of a cat or dog food, treat or toy.<br>
[0012]      The present invention is in part derived from a finding that, upon addition of an antioxidant vitamin or vitamin derivative to an antibacterial phenolic compound having anti-inflammatory activity, in particular a halogenated diphenylether compound having such activity, the anti-inflammatory activity can be enhanced. For example, addition of antioxidant vitamin or vitamin derivatives to the antibacterial phenolic compound triclosan has been found to lower to a surprising degree the IC50 of triclosan in an IL-10 stimulated PGE2 production cell culture assay, an inflammation model. In this assay, ascorbic acid, vitamin E acetate and TROLOX® (a synthetic analogue of a-tocopherol) were found to be especially effective in enhancing the anti-inflammatory activity of triclosan. Ascorbyl palmitate and vitamin E exhibited less dramatic enhancement; it is believed without being bound by theory that solubility limitations may have reduced their efficacy in this assay.<br>
[0013]       Accordingly, in one embodiment of the invention, there is provided an oral care composition comprising at least one antibacterial halogenated diphenylether compound and an antioxidant component. In a composition of this embodiment the at least one halogenated diphenylether compound is present in an antibacterially effective total amount, and the antioxidant component comprises one to a plurality of vitamin or vitamin derivatives in a total vitamin or vitamin derivative amount effective to enhance the anti-<br>
inflammatory activity of the composition. Based on the finding summarized above, at least one vitamin or vitamin derivative in the antioxidant component should be ascorbic acid or an orally acceptable salt or ester thereof, or a 2-methyl-6-chromanol compound (for example vitamin E, vitamin E acetate or TROLOX®).<br>
[0014]       The at least one antibacterial halogenated diphenylether can be, for example, triclosan, triclosan monophosphate or 2,2'-dihydroxy-5,5'-dibromodiphenylether.<br>
[0015]       According to the present embodiment, the at least one halogenated diphenylether compound, e.g., triclosan, is typically present in the composition in a total amount of about 0.01% to about 10% by weight. The concentration depends in part on the form of the composition; for example, in a mouthwash or oral rinse a relatively low concentration, for example about 0.01% to about 0.5%, can be useful, whereas in a toothpaste or gel dentifrice a somewhat higher concentration, for example about 0.05% to about 5%, will generally be found satisfactory. Illustratively the total concentration of the at least one halogenated diphenylether compound in a toothpaste or gel dentifrice can be about 0.1% to about 2%, for example about 0.2% to about 1% or about 0.25% to about 0.5%.<br>
[0016]       Vitamins and vitamin derivatives useful herein can illustratively be selected from the following classes: (a) sources of vitamin C, including ascorbic acid; (b)2-methyl-6-chromanol compounds, including TROLOX®, tocol (2-methyl-2-(4,8,12-trimethyltridecyl)-6-chromanol), α-tocopherol ((+)-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-2-(4,8,12-trimethyltridecyl)-6-chromanol), ß-tocopherol ((+)-2,5,8-trimethyl-2-(4,8,12-trimethyltridecyl)-6-chromanof), -tocopherol ((+)-2,7,8-trimelhyl-2-(4,8,12-trimethyltridecyl)-6-chromanol), δ-tocopherol ((+)-8-methyl-2-(4,8,12-trimethyltridecyl)-6-chromanol), α-tocotrienol (2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-2-(4,8,12-trimethyl-3,7,l l-tridecatrienyl)-6-chromanol), ß-tocotrienol (2,5,8-trimethyl-2-(4,8,12-trimethyl-3,7,l 1-tridecatrienyl)-6-chromanol) and vitamin E (any one or a mixture of any two or more tocopherols and/or tocotrienols); (c)   carotenoids, including retinol (vitamin A), retinal, retinoic acid, α-carotene, ß-carotene, -carotene, δ-carotene, lutein, lycopene, lycophyll, lycoxanthin, rhodoxanthin, astaxanthin and cryptoxanthin; (d)     sources of B vitamins, including thiamine (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), nicotinamide and nicotinic acid (both referred to as niacin), pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pantothenol, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, folic acid, dihydrofolic acid, vitamin B12 and biotin; (e) bioflavonoids,<br>
including rutin, hesperetin, hesperidin, eriodictyol, quercetin, quercetagetin and quercetagitrin; (f) quinone-type enzyme cofactors, including ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10) and pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ); (g) sources of a-lipoic acid; (h) sources of vitamin D, including calciferol and cholecalciferol; and (i) orally acceptable salts, esters (including phosphate, acetate and long-chain, e.g.,, linoleate and palmitate, esters), isomers, enantiomers, racemates and tautomers of the above.<br>
[0017] Vitamins and vitamin derivatives useful herein can be natural or synthetic in origin and can be used in refined form or in crude form, for example as herbal preparations.<br>
[0018]     According to one aspect of the present embodiment, the antioxidant component comprises ascorbic acid and/or an orally acceptable salt or ester thereof. Illustrative salts include the sodium, calcium and zinc salts of ascorbic acid. An illustrative ester is ascorbyl palmitate. According to another aspect of the present embodiment, the antioxidant component comprises a 2-methyl-6-chromanol compound. Illustratively, the 2-methyl-6-chromanol compound can be TROLOX® or an orally acceptable salt thereof, or vitamin E or an orally acceptable ester thereof, for example vitamin E acetate.<br>
[0019]     According to yet another aspect of the present embodiment, the antioxidant component comprises (a) ascorbic acid and/or an orally acceptable salt or ester thereof, and (b) a 2-methyl-6-chromanol compound, for example as illustrated above.<br>
[0020]     The antioxidant component further comprises one or more vitamin or vitamin derivatives other than a vitamin C source or a 2-methyl-6-chromanol compound. Such a vitamin or vitamin derivative can be, for example, a source of a B vitamin such as thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B5, vitamin B6 or folic acid, a carotenoid such as p-carotene, lutein or lycopene, a bioflavonoid, a quinone-type enzyme cofactor or a source of a-lipoic acid.<br>
[0021]     The antioxidant component in a composition of the present embodiment is typically included in an amount providing a weight ratio of total antibacterial halogenated diphenylether compound(s) to total vitamin or vitamin derivative(s) of about 10:1 to about 1:100, for example about 5:1 to about 1:50, or about 2:1 to about 1:20, or about 1:1 to about 1:10.<br>
[0022]     Enhancement of anti-inflammatory activity is not the only advantage that<br>
can be gained by providing an oral care composition having one or more antibacterial phenolic compounds and one or more antioxidant vitamin or vitamin derivatives. For example, concurrent application of an antibacterial agent and an antioxidant to an oral surface can provide complementary benefits in oral health, especially in the periodontal area. Furthermore, the vitamin or vitamin-like activity of the vitamin or vitamin derivative component can provide oral and systemic health benefits above and beyond its antioxidant effect. In the case of vitamin E, it has been found desirable to include both an esterified and a non-esterified form of the vitamin. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that having both esterified and non-esterified forms enhances delivery and hence efficacy of the vitamin as an antioxidant For example, vitamin E can give a short-burst effect while vitamin E acetate provides longer-term benefit.<br>
[0023]       Accordingly, in another embodiment of the invention, there is provided an oral care composition comprising at least one antibacterial phenolic compound in an antibacterially effective amount, and a vitamin or vitamin derivative component that comprises vitamin E and vitamin E acetate. In a composition of this embodiment, the at least one phenolic compound and the vitamin or vitamin derivative component are present in a total weight ratio of about 10:1 to about 1:100.<br>
[0024]       Phenolic compounds useful herein illustratively include, subject to determination of oral acceptability, those identified as having anti-inflammatory activity by Dewhirst (1980), Prostaglandins 20(2), 209-222, but are not limited thereto. Examples of antibacterial phenolic compounds include 4-allylcatechol, p-hydroxybenzoic acid esters including benzylparaben, butylparaben, ethylparaben, methylparaben and propylparaben, 2-benzylphenol, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, capsaicin, carvacrol, creosol, eugenol, guaiacol, halogenated bisphenolics including hexachlorophene and bromochlorophene, 4-hexylresorcinol, 8-hydroxyquinoline and salts thereof, salicylic acid esters including menthyl salicylate, methyl salicylate and phenyl salicylate, phenol, pyrocatechol, salicylanilide, thymol, triclosan and triclosan monophosphate.<br>
[0025]       The at least one antibacterial phenolic compound is in one aspect a halogenated diphenylether, for example triclosan, triclosan monophosphate or 2,2'-dihydroxy-5,5'-dibromodiphenylether.<br>
[0026]       The at least one phenolic compound is present ir. a total amount of about<br><br>
0.01% to about 10% by weight. Illustratively the total concentration of the at least one phenolic compound in a toothpaste or gel dentifrice of the present embodiment can be about 0.05% to about 5%, for example about 0.1% to about 2%, about 0.2% to about 1% or about 0.25% to about 0.5%.<br>
[0027]       The vitamin or vitamin derivative component comprises vitamin E, for example in the form of α-tocopherol, and vitamin E acetate, for example in the form of α-tocopheryl acetate. The vitamin E and vitamin E acetate fractions can be in any suitable weight ratio, for example about 20:1 to about 1:10, or about 15:1 to about 1:5, or about 5:1 to about 1:1. Illustratively the total concentration of vitamin E and vitamin E acetate in a toothpaste or gel dentifrice can be about 0.05% to about 5%, for example about 0.1% to about 2.5% or about 0.2% to about 1%.<br>
[0028]       According to one aspect of the present embodiment, the vitamin or vitamin derivative component can further comprise one or more vitamin or vitamin derivatives other than vitamin E and vitamin E acetate. As one example, the composition optionally further comprises at least one source of vitamin C such as ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, calcium ascorbate, zinc ascorbate or ascorbyl palmitate.

As yet another example, the composition optionally further comprises at least one bioflavonoid such as rutin or a derivative thereof, for example rutin sulfuric acid ester, sodium salt. As yet another example, the composition optionally further comprises at least one quinone-type enzyme cofactor such as ubiquinone or PQQ. As yet another example, the composition further comprises at least one source of α-lipoic acid.<br>
[0029]       According to another aspect of the present embodiment, the vitamin or vitamin derivative component can be a multivitamin or vitamin derivative complex comprising, in addition to vitamin E and vitamin E acetate, a plurality of vitamin or vitamin derivatives selected from at least two of the following classes: (a) sources of vitamin C; (b) carotenoids; (c) sources of B vitamins; (d) bioflavonoids; (e) quinone-type enzyme cofactors; (f) sources of α-lipoic acid; and (g) sources of vitamin D.<br>

[0042]       A composition of the invention can comprise, in addition to the at least one antibacterial phenolic (for example halogenated diphenylether) compound and a vitamin or vitamin derivative or antioxidant component as defined above, one or more active agents ("actives").<br>
[0043]       Among uceful actives are those addressing, without limitation, appearance and structural changes to teeth, treatment and prevention of plaque, calculus, dental caries, cavities, abscesses, inflamed and/or bleeding gums, gingivitis, oral infective and/or inflammatory conditions in general, tooth sensitivity, halitosis and the like. Thus, a composition of the invention can contain one or more actives such as whitening agents, fluoride ion sources, antimicrobial agents additional to the at least one antibacterial phenolic (for example halogenated diphenylether) compound, desensitizing agents, anticalculus (tartar<br>
control) agents, stannous ion sources, zinc ion sources, sialagogues, breath-freshening agents, antiplaque agents, anti-inflammatory agents additional to any anti-inflammatory phenolic compound present, periodontal agents, analgesics and nutrients additional to the at least one vitamin or vitamin derivative. Actives should be selected for compatibility with each other and with other ingredients of the composition.<br>
[0044]       Actives useful herein are normally present in the composition in amounts selected to be safe and effective, i.e., amount sufficient to provide a desired benefit, for example a therapeutic, prophylactic, nutritive or cosmetic effect, when the composition is used repeatedly as described herein, without undue side effects such as toxicity, irritation or allergic reaction, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Such a safe and effective amount will usually, but not necessarily, fall within ranges approved by appropriate regulatory agencies. A safe and effective amount in a specific case depends on many factors, including the particular benefit desired or condition being treated or sought to be prevented, the particular subject using, or being administered, the composition, the frequency and duration of use, etc. Actives are typically present in a total amount of about 0.01% to about 80%, for example about 0.05% to about 60%, about 0.1% to about 50%, or about 0.5% to about 40%, by weight of the composition.<br>
[0045]       One or more actives, including the antibacterial agent and/or the vitamin or vitamin derivative component herein, can optionally be present in encapsulated form in the composition. For example, beads containing one or more actives can be adapted to rupture during brushing or chewing to release the active(s) to the oral surface. Additionally, the composition of the invention may include any of the components conventionally present or desirable in an oral care product. For example, the composition may include a whitening agent, such as peroxy compounds, chlorine dioxide, chlorites and hypochlorites, a polymer-peroxide complex, polyvinylpyrrolidone-hydrogen peroxide (PVP-H2O2) complex; a source of fluride ions (monofluorophosphate and fluorosilicate salts, antibacterial agents. Active agents such as antibacterial agents may be includes, including, for example, those listed in U.S. Patent No. 5,776.435 to Gaffar et al., the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The composition may further include a tooth anti-sensitivity agent, a sialagogue (saliva stimulating agent), a breath-freshening agent, an antiplaque or plaque disrupting agent.<br>
[0046]       Among useful carriers for optional inclusion in a composition of the invention are diluents, abrasives, bicarbonate salts, pH modifying agents, surfactants, foam modulators, thickening agents, viscosity modifiers, humectants, sweeteners, flavorants and colorants. One carrier material, or more than one carrier material of the same or different classes, can optionally be present. Water is a preferred diluent and in some compositions such as mouthwashes and whitening liquids may be accompanied by an additional solvent, such as an alcohol, e.g., ethanol.<br>
