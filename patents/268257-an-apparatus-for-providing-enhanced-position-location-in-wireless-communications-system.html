POSITION LOCATION IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Field<br>
[000l]	This disclosure relates generally to wireless communications. More specifically.<br>
embodiments disclosed herein relate to providing. improved time-of-arrival measurement and enhanced position location in wireless communication systems.<br>
Background<br>
[0002]	Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types<br>
of communications (such as voice and data) to multiple users. Such systems may be based on code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDM.A), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), or other multiple access techniques, A wireless communication system may be designed to implement one or more standards, such as 1S-95, cdma2000, 1S-856, W-CDMA, TJD-SCDMA, and other standards.<br>
[0003]	Presence detection and location-based services have long been sought alter in<br>
wireless communications. In addition to supporting emergency services (e.g., £911 calls), wireless operators are striving to provide a wide range of new applications targeted for the everyday consumer and enterprise user, such as child locators, tum-by-tum navigation, directory services, voice concierge, roadside assistance, and many others. A challenge hence lies in providing accurate and reliable position location to enable such applications.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0015]	Embodiments disclosed herein relate to methods and systems for providing<br>
enhanced position location in wireless communication systems.<br>
[0016]	An access point (AP) disclosed herein may include and/or implement functions<br>
of a base-station transceiver system (BTS), an access network transceiver (ANT), a modem pool transceiver (MPT), or a Node B (e.g.. in a W-CDMA type system)- etc. A. cell may refer to a coverage area serviced by an AP. A cell may further include one or more sectors. For simplicity and clarity, the term "sector" may be used herein to refer a cell, or a section of a cell, serviced by an AP. Further, an access network controller (ANC) may refer to the portion of a communication system configured to interface with a core network (e.g., a packet data network) and route data packets between access terminals (ATs) and the core network, perform various radio access and link maintenance functions (such as soft handoff), control radio transmitters and receivers, and so on.   An ANC may include and/or implement the functions of a base station<br>
controller (BSC), such as found in a 2" , 3", or 4 generation wireless network. An ANC and one or more APs may constitute part of an access network (AN).<br>
[0017]	An access terminal (AT) described herein may refer to various types of devices,<br>
including (but not limited to) a wireless phone, a cellular phone, a laptop computer, a multimedia wireless device, a wireless communication personal computer (PC) card, a personal digital assistant (PDA), an external or internal modem, etc. An AT may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel and/or through a wired channel (e.g.. by way of fiber optic or coaxial cables). An AT may have various names, such as access unit, access node, subscriber unit mobile station, mobile device, mobile unit, mobile phone, mobile, remote station, remote terminal, remote unit, user device, user equipment, handheld device, etc. Different ATs may be incorporated into a system. ATs may be mobile or stationary, and may be dispersed throughout a communication system. An AT may communicate with one or more APs on a forward link and/or a reverse link at a given moment. The forward link (or downlink) refers to transmission from an AP to an AT. The reverse link (or uplink) refers to transmission from the AT to the AP.<br>
[0018]	Locating a person or an object wireiessly may be achieved in a number of ways<br>
Time-of-arrival (TOA) measurement, which uses time it takes for a signal to travel as an indirect method of calculating distance, is commonly involved in a number of network-based methods. For example, in some wireless networks, position location services require TOA measurement, of the pilot signal (e.g., the earliest path of the pilot).<br>
[0019]	FIG. 1 illustrates a wireless communication system 100 configured to support a<br>
number of users, in which various disclosed embodiments and aspects may be implemented, as further described below. By way of example, system .100 provides communication for a number of cells 102, including cells 102a-I02g, with each cell being serviced by a corresponding AP 104 (such as APs 104a-104g). Each ceil may be further divided into one or more sectors. Various ATs 106, including ATs 106a- 106k, are dispersed throughout the system. Each AT 106 may communicate with one or more APs 104 on a. forward link and/or a reverse link at a given moment, depending upon whether the AT is active and whether it is in soft handoff, for example.<br>
[0020]	In FIG. 1, a solid line with an arrow may indicate information (e.g., data)<br>
transmission from an AP to an AT.  A broken line with an arrow may indicate that the<br>
AT is receiving the pilot and other signaling/reference signals, but no data transmission, from the AP, as further described below. For clarity and simplicity, the reverse link communication is not explicitly shown in FIG. 1.<br>
[0021]	In a high rate packet data (HRP.D) system (e.g.. as specified in "cdma2000 High<br>
Rate Packet Data Air Interface Specification/' 3GPP2 C.S0024-A, Version 2, July 2005. referred to as "IxEV-DCT (or "I.S-856") herein), for example, transmission on forward link is partitioned into a sequence of frames; each frame is further divided into time slots (e.g., 16 slots each with a duration of 1.667 msec); and each slot includes a plurality of ume-division-multipiexed channels.<br>
[0022]	By way of example, FIG. 2 illustrates an embodiment of a forward link slot<br>
structure 200, such as employed in a IxEV-DO type system. Time slot 200 is divided into two half-slots, with each half-slot having the following channel assignments', pilot channel 210, forward medium access control (MAC) channel 220, and forward traffic (or control) channel 230. Pilot channel 210 carries the pilot signal (also commonly termed as the pilot) used by an AT (such as AT 106 in FIG. 1) for initial acquisition, phase recovers', timing recovery, radio combining, as well as estimating the channel conditions on forward link (e.g., by way of the signal-to-noise-and-interfereiice (SINK) measurement). MAC channel 220 sets forth the procedures used to receive and transmit over the physical layer (which provides the channel structure, frequency, power output, modulation, encoding specifications for forward and reverse links). Traffic channel 230 may carry information or data (e.g., by way of physical layer packets), e.g., unicast data specific to a particular AT (or user), or broadcast'multicast data to a group of users (e.g., as specified in "cdma2000 High Rate Broadcast-Multicast Packet Data Air Interface Specification," 3GPP2 C.S0054-0, Version 2.0, July 2005, referred to as "BCMCS specification" herein). Traffic channel 230 may also be used to carry control messages. Further, pilot channel 210, MAC channel 220, and traffic channel 230 are thne-division-multipiexed within time slot 200. When there is no traffic on traffic channel 230, an idle slot including pilot channel 210 and MAC channel 220 may be sent. Transmission of idle slots serves to decrease interference to other ceils on forward link.<br>
[0023]	As illustrated in FIG. 2, pilot channel 210 is transmitted in discrete bursts (as<br>
opposed to being continuous in time), hence having limited power. In some systems, for example, pilot channel 2.10 may comprise 96 chips of a particular digital pattern<br>
 (e.g.. all zeros), MAC channel 220 may comprise 64 chips, and each half-slot may comprise 1024 chips. Thus, only a small fraction (e.g., 96/1024) of the available forward link power is allotted to the pilot channel in such systems. As a result, TOA .measurement based on such pilot channel may be susceptible to errors (e.g.. particularly when the forward fink channel conditions are poor), hence, compromising the accuracy and reliability of associated position location. A need therefore exists for a strong mid clear signal to assist position location.<br>
[0024]	Embodiments disclosed herein relate to methods arid systems for providing<br>
improved TOA measurement and enhanced position location in wireless communication systems,<br>
[0025]	hi   an embodiment,  an  AP  may  replace normal  information  (e.g.,  data)<br>
transmission by a "known" transmission (termed Reference transmission" herein) at a predetermined time known to ATs in sectors serviced by the AP. The ATs may use the received reference transmission to assist or facilitate position location (e.g.. TOA and. or other position-location measurements). The AP may also send a reference transmission on demand, e.g., in response lo a request from an AT (which may be in need for a location-based service).<br>
[0026]	In some embodiments, the reference transmission may include a time slot having<br>
a pilot signal and a reference signal in a time-division-multiplexed format. In other embodiments, the reference transmission may include a time slot having a pilot signal and a reference in a code-division-multiplexed format. The reference signal may be similar or substantially identical to the pilot, such that the entire time slot is nearly filled with the pilot, thereby providing a strong signal for TOA and other position-location measurements. The reference signal may also be different from the pilot, e.g., configured to assist the pilot in position location. The ensuing description provides further embodiments and examples.<br>
[0027]	The term "reference signal" disclosed herein may include any signal that is<br>
unmodulated (e.g., carrying no information, or data) and known to a receiving AT. For example, the reference signal may comprise a digital pattern (e.g., a sequence of symbols.) that is 'known" in advance to the receiving AT, whereby the AT does not need to decode the reference signal. The reference may carry- a unique sector ID (e.g., spread with a pseudorandom (PN) code with a unique offset specific to the sector). Tine<br>
reference signai may be transmitted at substantially the maximum power available to the sector (or '"full sector power"). In some embodiments, the reference signai may be a spread-spectrum or other wideband signal (e.g., to occupy  the entire traffic channel). A "reference transmission" disclosed herein may refer to a forward link transmission including a reference signal. Further, the term "'position-location measurement** may broadly refer to a measurement associated with position location, including (but not limited to) TOA, time difference of arrival (TDOA), angle of arrival (AOA), advanced forward link trilateraiion (A'FLT), enhanced observed time difference (EOTD). and others,<br>
[0028]	Various aspects, features, and embodiments are described in further detail<br>
below. .<br>
[0029]	FIG. 3 A illustrates an embodiment of a reference transmission including a time<br>
slot 300, which may be used to implement some disclosed embodiments. Time slot 300 is shown in two half-slots, each having pilot channel 310, MAC channel 320, and traffic channel 330 in a time-division-muUiplexed format. Pilot channel 310 carries the pilot Pilot channel 3.10 and MAC channel 320 may for example be substantially as described above with respect to the embodiment of FIG. 2. Traffic channel 330 carries a reference signal, in'lieu of data.<br>
[0030]	In some embodiments, the reference signal may be similar or substantially<br>
identical to the pilot, as time slot 350 of FIG. 3B illustrates. As a result, the entire slol 350 is nearly filled with the pilot, as graphically illustrated by the hatched area in the figure, and the full power of the entire sector may be substantially devoted to the pilot transmission during this time period. This strong pilot allows the receiving ATs to carry out more accurate and reliable TOA and other position-location .measurements. Tire timing and signaling for such "pilot slot*' may for example be according to the broadcast/multicast channel structure in a lxEV-DO type system (e.g., as specified in the BCMCS specification). Further, implementation of such '"pilot slot" imposes minimal changes to the existing network infrastructures and devices.<br>
[0031]	In other embodiments, the reference signal may be different from the pilot.   The<br>
tinting and signaling for the reference transmission may for example be according to the broadcast'multicast channel structure in a lxEV-DO type system (e.g., as specified in the BCMCS specification). In one embodiment, for example, the pilot may comprise a<br>
sequence of symbols having all zeros (0's), whereas the reference signal may comprise a sequence of symbols having ail ones (Ts). In another embodiment, the pilot may comprise the pilot symbols used in a ixEV-DO type system, whereas the reference signal may comprise the pilot symbols used in an IS-95 type system. In yet another embodiment, the pilot may comprise a particular sequence of symbols, while the reference signal may comprise the sequence configured in reverse. 'In an alternative embodiment, a known data packet ram- be transmitted as the reference signal, e.g., using the broadcast/multicast channel structure and signaling in a IxEV-DO type system (e.g., as specified in the BCMCS specification). A receiving AT may use this reference signal to search for the (weaker) pilot, estimate TOA (and/or perform other position-location measurements), and report back the measured information.<br>
[0032]	in an embodiment, the reference transmission may be carried out by an AP<br>
according to a predetermined schedule (e.g., on a regular or periodic basis), so that at known times, ATs in the corresponding sectors may be prepared to perform TOA and/or other position-location measurements, and report back the measured information.<br>
[0033]	In an embodiment, an AP may carry out the reference transmission on demand,<br>
e.g., upon receiving a request from an AT (which may be in need for a location-based service).<br>
[0034]	In an embodiment, an AP may make use of idle slots for reference transmission<br>
(e.g., filing an idle slot substantially with the pilot, such as described above with respect to the embodiment of Fl'G. 3B), so as to make efficient use of the network resources. For example, the signaling associated with such time slot may indicate to a receiving AT the reference signal carried by the traffic channel, so thai the AT may accordingly perform TOA and/or other position-location measurements.<br>
[0035]	FiGs. 3A-3.B provide some examples of traiismitting a reference signal along the<br>
pilot in a time-division-multipiexed format. In other systems (e.g., as specified in "Physical Layer Standard far cdma2000 Spectrum Systems," 3GPP2 C.S0002-D, Version 2.0, September 2005, referred to as "CDMA2000 1.x" herein, or as specified in "Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular Systems," ANSI/T1A/EIA-95-B-99, referred to as "IS-95" herein), a reference signal may be transmitted along with the pilot in a code-division-mulliplexed format, such as described below.<br>
[0036]	FIG. 4 A illustrates an embodiment of forward link structure in the form of sector<br>
power usage vs. time, such as in art IS-95 or CDMA2000 Ix type system. Forward link channels, including pilot channel 4.10, sync channel 420, paging channel 430, and traffic channels 440, are transmitted in a code-division-multiplexed format; each with a certain fraction of the total sector power. For example, pilot channel 410 may be allotted approximately 15-20% of the maximum sector power, denoted as Prx(max). To augment the pilot (e.g., for position location purposes), some or ail of the power allotted to traffic channels 440 may be used to transmit a reference signal (in lieu of information transmission) in a specific period of time, such as illustrated in FIG. 4B below.<br>
[0037]	For illustration and clarity. FiG. 4B depicts an embodiment in which the power<br>
allotted to traffic channels 440 may be substantially devoted to transmit a reference signal. 460 in a time slot 450. For example, such may occur in situations where an AP sends a reference transmission to the corresponding ATs according to a predetermined schedule (e.g., on a reguiai' or periodical basis), so that at known times, the ATs may be prepared to perform position-location measurements and. report back the measured information. In some embodiments, the reference signal may be similar or substantially identicaj to the pilot; as a result the entire time slot 450 may be nearly filled with the pilot, thereby providing a strong signal for position-location measurements. In other embodiments, the reference may also be different from the pilot such as described above.<br>
[0038}	in alternative embodiments, a fraction of the power allotted to traffic channels<br>
440 may be used to transmit reference signal 460 in time slot 450. For example, such may occur- in situations where an AP carries out a reference transmission on demand, e.g., in response to request(s) from one or more ATs in the corresponding sectors (which may be in need for position-location services).<br>
J0039]	In addition to replacing information transmission by a reference transmission<br>
according to a predetermined schedule or on demand (such as described above), a portion of the control channel (e.g., the preamble), or other existing (or known) signals, may be used to assist the pilot in position location. For example, in some systems, the control channel may be transmitted on a regular or periodic basis. The preamble of the control channel may be known to a receiving AT (e.g., after the initial set-up), and<br><br>
therefore, used to assist the pilot in position location (such as in a manner described above with respect to the reference signal).<br>
[0040}	FIG. 5 illustrates a flow diagram of a process 500. which may be used to<br>
implement some disclosed embodiments (such as described above). Step 510 generates a pilot signal and a reference signal, the reference signal comprising a sequence of symbols known to an access terminal. Step 520 transmits the pilot signal and the reference signal in a time slot.<br>
[0041]	in process 500, the pilot signal and the reference signal may be transmitted in a<br>
time-division-muHiplexed format or code-division-muitipiexed format, such as described above. In some embodiments, the reference signal may be similar or substantially identical to the pilot signal. In other embodiments, the reference signal may be different from the pilot signal, e.g., configured to assist the pilot signal in position location (e.g., TOA and other position-location measurements), such as described above. Further, in a multi-carrier wireless communication system, the time slot may be transmitted on a subset (e.g., some, all, or any combination) of carriers.<br>
['0042]	FIG. 6 illustrates a flow diagram of a process 600, which may be used to<br>
implement some disclosed embodiments (such as described above). Process 600 starts at step 610. Step 620 determines (e.g., based on a predetermined schedule) whether it is time for earning out a reference transmission to ATs in sectors serviced by an AP. If the outcome of step 620 is "YES," step 630 follows and generates a pilot signal and a reference signal. Step 640 transmits the pilot signal and the reference signal in a time slot (e.g., in a time-division-multiplexed or code-division-multiplexed format, such as described above). Subsequently., process 600 returns to step 620.<br>
[0043]	In process 600, if the outcome of step 620 is "NOstep 650 follows and<br>
determines if there is a request for a location-based service from an AT. If the outcome of step 650 is '"YES," process 600 returns to step 630. If the outcome of step 650 is "NO," step 660 follows and proceeds with information (e.g., data) transmission. Process 600 subsequently returns to step 620.<br>
[0044]	FIG. 7 illustrates a flow diagram of a process 700, which may be used io<br>
implement some disclosed embodiments. Step 710 receives a pilot signal and a reference signal in a time slot (e.g., in a time-division-multiplexed or code-division-<br><br>
multiplexed format, such as described above). Step 730 performs a position-location measurement based on the pilot signal and me reference signal.<br>
[0045]	Process 700 may further include searching for the pilot signal.    In some<br>
instances, the reference signal may be similar or substantially identical to the pilot signal, effectively providing a strong pilot for position-location measurements, in other instances, a receiving AT may use the reference signal to search for the (weaker) pilot, estimate TOA (and/or perform other position-location measurements), and report back the measured information,<br>
[0046]	FIG. 8 illustrates a flow diagram of a process 800, which may be used to<br>
implement some disclosed embodiments (such as described above). Process 800 starts at step 810. Step 820 receives a time slot having a pilot channel and a reference channel (e.g., in a time-division-multiplexed format such as described above), Ihe pilot channel carrying a pilot signal. Step 830 determines if the traffic channel carries a reference signal. If the outcome of step 830 is "YES," step 840 follows and performs a position-location (e.g., TOA) measurement based on the pilot signal and Ihe reference signal. Process 800 subsequently returns to step 820. If (he outcome of step 830 is "NO," slep 850 follows and proceeds with the traffic channel (e.g., decode the data packets carried by the traffic channel). Process 800 subsequently returns to step 820.<br>
[0047]	FIG. 9 shows a block diagram of an apparatus 900, which may be used to<br>
implement some disclosed embodiments (such as described above). By way of example, apparatus 900 may include a reference-generating unit (or module) 910 configured to generate a pilot signal and a reference signal, wherein the reference signal comprising a sequence of known symbols (e.g., to one or more receiving ATs); and a transmitting unit 930 configured to transmit the pilot signal and the reference signal in a time slot.
