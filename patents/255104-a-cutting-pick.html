ROTARY CUTTING BIT<br>
The present invention relates to cutting tools used for mining and excavation purposes. The present invention has been developed principally for use in the mining of coal and in that use, typically underground coal mining. It will therefore be convenient to describe the invention in relation to that use although it will be readily appreciated that the invention could be employed for any mining or excavation operation to which its function is suitable.<br>
Various different forms of equipment and machinery can be employed for mining and excavation operations, and typically it is the type of mining or excavation taking place, and the type of earth being mined or excavated, that dictates the type of equipment and machinery that is appropriate. The present invention is principally concerned with underground coal mining and one of the major safety difficulties in that type of mining relates to fires or explosions within the mine. These can occur due to the generation during mining of methane gas and coal dust (commonly known as mine dust), which can be trapped within the mine and is readily ignitable. Disadvantageous^, the equipment used in coal mining can generate incendive sparks and thus cause fires or explosion. Therefore, it is important that all appropriate steps be taken to minimise or eliminate the production of sparks.<br>
Equipment used to mine or excavate in hard earth can include rotary cutters, in which a rotating drum that carries a plurality of projecting cutting bits or picks, is brought into engagement with an earth face. The picks bite into the earth face as they rotate with the drum, to impact against and to dislodge or fragment earth from the face. This highly aggressive engagement between the picks and the earth face can result in spark production between them.<br>
Picks employed for the above purpose generally have a hard cemented tungsten carbide tip that is fixed, usually by brazing, to a steel shank. Picks of this kind are disclosed in various prior art, such as U.S. Patent No. 6,113,195, EP0274645 and DE4226976. The tip of the picks can be either of the insert or cap style.<br><br>
WO 2005/093214	PCT/SE2005/000431<br>
11996WO 2005-03-22	2<br>
The insert style is shown in DE4226976, in which a greater section of the axial length of the tip is anchored within a bore of the shank, than extends out of the bore. The cap style is shown in EP0274645, in which the tip has a broader base than the insert style tip and the base is located and brazed into a relatively shallow recess in the forward end of the shank. The present invention is applicable to either of these forms of pick.<br>
In picks of the above kind, sparks can be produced between the tungsten carbide tip and the earth face and also between the steel shank and the earth face, although there typically is greater likelihood of spark production between the shank and the earth face.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a cutting pick which has a reduced likelihood of producing a spark during mining or excavation operations, in particular underground coal mining.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a cutting pick comprising:<br>
an elongate shank;<br>
a cutting tip fixed to one end of the shank to project from that end and which is of a material that is harder than the material of the shank; and<br>
a composite sleeve formed of a plurality of annular sleeve portions which are attached about the shank adjacent the cutting tip and immediately adjacent to each other, the sleeve portions being of a material which is harder than the material of the shank and which has a lower propensity for incendive spark production during a cutting operation than the material of the shank.<br>
The present invention further provides a cutting pick comprising;<br>
an elongate steel shank;<br>
a cutting tip fixed to a cylindrical end section of the shank to project from that end axiaily wrth respect to the lengthwise axis of the shank and which is of a material that is harder than the material of the shank; and<br>
. a composite sleeve formed of a plurality of annular sleeve portions which are attached about the cylindrical end section in axiaily abutting relationship and which extend substantially the full height of that section and which are of a material that is harder than the material of the shank and which has a lower propensity for incendive spark production during a cutting operation than the steel of the shank.<br><br>
WO 2005/093214	PCT/SE2005/000431<br>
119S6WO 2005-03-22	3<br>
The present invention further provides a method of using a cutting pick for mining, the cutting pick comprising an elongate shank; a cutting tip fixed to one end of the shank to project from that end and which is of a material that is harder than the material of the shank; and a composite sleeve formed of a plurality of annular sleeve portions which are attached about the shank adjacent the cutting tip and immediately adjacent to each other, the sleeve portions being of a material which is harder than the material of the shank and which has a lower propensity for incendive spark production during a cutting operation than the material of the shank, the method comprising the step of mining in gas and/or mine dust containing environments.<br>
The present invention still further provides a method of using a cutting pick for mining, the cutting pick comprising;<br>
an elongate steel shank;<br>
a cutting tip fixed to a cylindrical end section of the shank to project from that end axially with respect to the lengthwise axis of the shank and which is of a material that is harder than the material of the shank; and<br>
a composite sleeve formed of a plurality of annular sleeve portions which are attached about the cylindrical end section in axially abutting relationship and which extend substantially the full height of that section and which are of a material that is harder than the material of the shank and which has a lower propensity for incendive spark production during a cutting operation than the steel of the shank, the method comprising the step of mining in gas and/or mine dust containing environments.<br>
Still further, the present invention provides a cutting pick comprising:<br>
an elongate shank;<br>
a cutting tip fixed to one end of the shank to project from that end and which is of a material that is harder than the material of the shank; and<br>
the elongate shank including a cylindrical section having a first end adjacent the cutting tip and a second end spaced axially away from the cutting tip and which terminates in a shoulder;<br>
an annular sleeve which is attached about the cylindrical section of the shank, the annular sleeve being supported at one axial end on the shoulder, while the other axial end extends towards but terminates prior to the first end of the cylindrical section so that a cylindrical portion of the cylindrical section<br><br>
WO 2005/093214	PCT/SE2005/000431<br>
11996WO 2005-03-22	4<br>
remains exposed, the sleeve being of a material which is harder than the material of the shank and which has a lower propensity for incendive spark production during a cutting operation than the material of the shank.<br>
Stilt further, the present invention provides a method of using a cutting pick for mining, the cutting pick comprising:<br>
an elongate shank;<br>
a cutting tip fixed to one end of the shank to project from that end and which is of a material that is harder than the material of the shank; and<br>
the elongate shank including a cylindrical section having a first end adjacent the cutting tip and a second end spaced axially away from the cutting tip and which terminates in a shoulder;<br>
an annular sleeve which is attached about the cylindrical section of the shank, the annular sleeve being supported at one axial end on the shoulder, while the other axial end extends towards but terminates prior to the first end of the cylindrical section so that a cylindrical portion of the cylindrical section remains exposed, the sleeve being of a material which is harder than the material of the shank and which has a lower propensity for incendive spark production during a cutting operation than the material of the shank the method comprising the step of mining in gas and/or mine dust containing environments.<br>
By the attachment of the sleeve about the shank, the portion of the shank in the immediate vicinity of the cutting tip, which typically is the most likely to contact either the earth face being cut, or the fragments of earth being dislodged from the face, and to therefore generate an incendive spark, is shielded against that contact by the spark resistant material. The propensity for spark production is therefore reduced.<br>
In a cutting pick according to the invention, the elongate shank can take any suitable form, such as known forms, for fixing to a rotary cutting drum. The shank would usually be releasably fixable to the drum so that worn cutting picks can be replaced as necessary and in some machinery, the shank is rotatably mounted so that the cutting pick can freely rotate about its lengthwise axis as it engages an earth face. The shank usually would be manufactured from steel.<br>
In a cutting pick according to the invention, the shank can be configured to receive either an insert style cutting tip or a cap style cutting tip.<br><br>
WO 2005/093214	PCT/SE2005/000431<br>
11996WO 2005-03-22	5<br>
In a cutting pick according to the invention, the cutting tip can be manufactured from any suitable material which is harder than the shank material, and the preferred cutting tip material is cemented tungsten carbide. The tip can also be diamond impregnated for increased hardness or can include cubic boron nitride for the same purpose. The cutting tip can have any suitable shape, which typically is dependent on whether the tip is of the insert or cap style. The cutting tip usually is brazed to the shank, although other arrangements for fixing the tip, such as by chemical adhesives, can be employed.<br>
The sleeve which is attached about the shank adjacent the cutting tip preferably is formed from the same material as the cutting tip and preferably that material is a cemented tungsten carbide. Alternatively the material could be or include SiC, AI203, TiN, SiC-D (silicon carbide diamond composite), cubic boron nitride, tool steel, or other like materials. These materials can be formed as a composite material with other suitable materials, or they may be provided as an outer layer or layers over a suitable base.<br>
In a typical size of cutting pick, the axial height of the sleeve could be in the region of about 10 mm to 15 mm, with the radial thickness of the sleeve between inner and outer diameter, about 3 mm to 5 mm. Production of a sleeve in these dimensions in tungsten carbide may present certain difficulties and therefore the invention provides that the sleeve can be produced as a composite sleeve in sleeve portions or rings of reduced height, such as about 4 mm in axial height. These portions can then be attached to the shank to form a composite sleeve of the required height. In the preferred arrangement, three sleeve portions are employed, although two sleeve portions, or four or more, may be employed as required. In a preferred arrangement, each sleeve portion has the same inside and outside diameters, and preferably the inner and outer surfaces are parallel, although the outer surface can include a chamfered edge or edges to reduce the likelihood of sharp edge breakage.<br>
The envisaged difficulty with a sleeve formed of one piece relates principally to the difference in the coefficient of expansion between the sleeve and the shank when the sleeve is attached to the shank, if the shank material is steel and the sleeve is tungsten carbide, the shank will expand as the steel is heated and the shank will thereafter shrink as the steel cool cools at a rate<br><br>
WO 2005/093214	PCT/SE2005/000431<br>
11996WO 2005-03-22	6<br>
which is about twice as fast as that of the sleeve. The difference in rate of shrinking can introduce stresses in the sleeve, which typically will be more brittle than the shank and if the stresses are sufficient, the sleeve can crack. If a plurality of shank portions in the form of rings is employed, then the contact area between the shank and the composite sleeve can be reduced by breaks between the rings. This is because the medium employed to fix the rings to the shank extends between the rings and the shank and between the rings themselves. That medium, which is, as later described, preferably braze, can absorb some of the induced stresses and therefore reduce the likelihood of the sleeve failing. This has the additional benefit that the composite sleeve can be tougher or stronger than a single-piece sleeve, so that the likelihood of wear or failure under operating loads is also reduced.<br>
In a preferred form of a cutting pick according to the invention, the shank defines a shoulder between a generally conical section and cylindrical section. The conical section converges towards the cylindrical section, while the cylindrical section defines a recess for receipt of a base portion of the cutting tip. That receipt can constitute either an insert or cap style cutting pick. In this arrangement, the sleeve is attached to the shank about the cylindrical section and is supported against the shoulder. Advantageously, this arrangement provides for accurate location of the sleeve on the shank and provides a surface against which the sleeve can react impact loads during a cutting operation.<br>
To reduce the likelihood of the annular sleeve fracturing during a cutting operation, the portion of the sleeve which is adjacent the base of the cutting tip can be positioned so that a cylindrical portion of the cylindrical section remains exposed. Preferably the extent of exposure, as measured axially, is in the region of 1 mm to 5mm, most preferably about 3 mm. The exposed portion therefore is relatively small and preferably also is of a diameter no greater than the outermost diameter of the cutting tip at the region of the base of the cutting tip. Because only a small portion of the cylindrical section is exposed, the likelihood of that section engaging a cutting surface during a cutting operation is very low. Rather, the exposed section is likely to be within the "wear shadow" of the cutting tip, which is a section of the cutting pick that suffers minimal or negligible wear due to its close proximity to the cutting tip. Wear of the pick is more likely to occur at a position further away from the cutting tip. Sections of<br><br>
WO 2005/093214	PCT/SE2005/000431<br>
1199SWO 2005-03-22	7<br>
the pick that are more likely to wear are those sections which have significant contact with the cutting surface and it is those sections which are more likely to spark when contact occurs.<br>
By positioning the annular sleeve further away from the cutting tip, the sleeve is positioned in a less destructive environment during a cutting operation in respect of impact loads that could cause the sleeve to fracture. On the other hand, by positioning the sleeve to overlie areas of the pick of significant cutting surface contact during a cutting operation, the incidence of spark production can be reduced, while the cylindrical section can also be protected against wear.<br>
In the preferred arrangement, in which the shank is formed of steel and the sleeve or sleeves is/are formed from tungsten carbide, the preferred form of attachment of the sleeve to the shank, is by brazing. In the embodiment in which the sleeve is comprised of a plurality of sleeve portions, it is preferred that each portion is individually brazed to the shank and to each other. Advantageously, the braze which is interposed between the sleeve portions and the shank can absorb stresses that occur during heating and cooling of the pick. During heating and cooling, the sleeve portions and the shank expand and shrink, but at different rates due to differences in the relative co-efficients of expansion. The braze can also provide a level of shock absorption during a cutting operation. It is to be noted that the braze is intended to be present between adjacent sleeve portions as well as between the sleeve portions and the shank, so that stress and shock absorption between adjacent sleeve portions also occurs.<br>
While tungsten carbide is the preferred material for the sleeve, other materials, such as those discussed above, may be equally appropriate. Likewise, the material can include additives which enhance either the resistance to incendive spark production or which increase the wear resisting capacity of the sleeve. In this latter respect, the sleeve for example, can be enhanced by the addition of diamond particles. Other additives of the above discussed kinds may be equally appropriate. Alternatively, the material may be a composite of a base, which has a suitable outer layer or layers applied to it, and for this titanium nitride is most preferred.<br><br>

It will be appreciated that the above discussion principally concerns the reduction or elimination of incendive spark production, during engagement of a cutting pick with an earth face. While that result is the primary objective of the invention, a secondary aspect of the invention, is to provide the shank with a resistance to wear. Shanks formed from steel, readily wear over time, and it is often the case that the steel shank wears more quickly than the harder cutting tip, so that the cutting pick must be replaced earlier than desirable i.e. before the cutting pick is sufficiently worn. In other words, wear of the shank can reduce the effective life of the cutting pick. Pick wear often occurs principally in the vicinity of the shank immediately adjacent the cutting tip. Accordingly, by suitable selection of sleeve material, the steel shank in that vicinity can be shielded against engagement with earth face or fragments, that would otherwise cause it to wear and therefore the life of the cutting pick can be improved. The selection of a sleeve material that is the same or effectively equivalent to the material of the cutting tip, can provide useful wear resistance for this purpose.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of using a cutting pick of any of the kinds described above, for mining in a gas and/or mine dust environment.<br>
Other objects, features, and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments and accompanying drawings, by way of non-limiting examples only, all of which form a part of the specification, wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding parts in the various figures.<br>
Figure 1 is a side view of the shank of a rotary cutting pick.<br>
Figure 2 is a side view of a tungsten carbide tip for attachment to the shank of Figure 1.<br>
Figure 3 is a side view of a cutting pick according to the invention.<br>
Figure 4 is a side view of an alternative embodiment of a cutting pick according to the invention.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 respectively show a shank 10 of a cutting pick, and a tungsten carbide tip 11 which is shaped for attachment to the shank 10. The shank 10 includes a body section 12, which includes a flange 13 at one end and a recess 14 remote from the flange 13, and whereby the flange 13 and the recess 14 cooperate with a rotary cutting drum for fixing of the cutting pick to<br><br>
WO 2005/093214	PCT/SE 2005/000431<br>
9<br>
the drum. The manner with which the shank 10 is fixed to the drum will be known to a person skilled in the art and therefore will not be further described or illustrated herein.<br>
The shank 10 further defies a substantially conical section 15, a cylindrical section 16 and a first shoulder 17. It will be appreciated that the first shoulder 17 is defined by a reduction in the diameter of the conical section 15 immediately adjacent the cylindrical section 16.<br>
The cylindrical section 16 includes a recess 18 for receiving a base portion of a cutting tip, such as of the kind shown in Figure 2. Referring to that figure, it will be appreciated that the cutting tip 11 is not shown to scale for attachment to the shank 10, but instead is shown larger to clearly show relevant detail. The cutting tip 11 includes a base portion 19 which extends to a maximum diameter ring 20 and it is the base portion 19 which is received within the recess 18 of the shank 10. The ring 20 rests against the upper edge 21 of the cylindrical section 16, when the cutting tip 11 is fixed to the cylindrical section 16. That fixing typically is achieved by brazing the cutting tip 11 within the recess 18. Figure 1 shows in broken outline, the cutting tip 11 fixed to the cylindrical section 16.<br>
It will be appreciated from Figure 1, that when the cutting tip 11 is fixed to the shank 10 each of the outer cylindrical surface 22, the first shoulder 17 and the outer surface of the conical section 15 remain exposed. Thus, these surfaces can come into contact with the earth face being cut, or with fragments that have been dislodged from the earth face. That engagement can result in incendive sparks being produced, with the obvious potential hazardous consequences. The likelihood of spark production is greatest in the sections of the shank 10 adjacent the cutting tip 11, while the likelihood reduces towards the opposite end of the shank 10.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates an embodiment of the invention, in which the likelihood of spark production is reduced. The cutting pick 30 of Figure 3 employs the shank 10 and cutting tip 11 of Figures 1 and 2 and therefore the same reference numerals as used in those figures are employed in Figure 3.<br>
In Figure 3, a composite sleeve 31, formed of three identical sleeve portions or rings 32, is disposed about the outer cylindrical surface 22 (Figure 1) of the cylindrical section 16. Each of the rings 32 is formed separately from one another, and is fitted about the cylindrical section 16 in a snug or slightly<br><br>
WO 2005/093214	PCT/SE 2005/000431<br>
10<br>
frictional fitting, and is brazed to the outer surface 22, and the most remote ring 32 from the cutting tip 11 is also brazed to the first shoulder 17. As shown, the rings 32 provide substantially complete protection for the outer surface 22 of the cylindrical section 16, with only a slight cylindrical portion of the cylindrical section 16 visible axially beyond the most immediately adjacent ring 32 to the cutting tip 11. That portion is identified by the reference numeral 33 and is the portion of the cylindrical section 16 to which the flange 20 of the cutting tip 11 is fixed. The cylindrical portion 33 provides some protection for the rings 32, particularly the uppermost ring 32, against the impact of earth fragments dislodged during a cutting operation so that the likelihood of the rings 32 fracturing is significantly reduced, particularly the uppermost ring. The axial height of the exposed cylindrical portion can be in the region of 1 mm to 5 mm, while most preferably it is about 3 mm.<br>
The sleeve 31 is produced in separate rings, simply for ease of sleeve production and attachment to the shank 10. Rings 32 of the dimensions shown in Figure 3 are more easily produced from tungsten carbide, than would be a single composite sleeve which has an axial dimension equal to the three axially adjacent rings. Also, by separately brazing each ring 32 in turn to the cylindrical section 16, a more firm attachment of the composite sleeve 31 to the shank 10 is achieved. Also, the use of rings 32 to form a composite sleeve allows the axial height of the sleeve to be increased or decreased relative to the axial extent of the cylindrical section 16. That is, sleeves of different axial dimensions need not be produced, it is simply necessary to choose the appropriate number of rings 32 for the axial sleeve height required.<br>
It will be seen from Figure 3, that each of the rings 32 has a chamfer applied to the leading axial edge thereof in the direction of the cutting tip 11.<br>
It will be further appreciated, that the axial length of the sleeve 31 could be extended in the direction towards the flange 13, and for this the conical section 15 of the shank 10_can be stepped to provide a further series of shoulders, or further sleeves could simply be attached to the outer surface of the conical section 15. The necessity for continuing the sleeve protection towards the flange 13 is dependent on the likelihood of incendive spark production further behind the first shoulder 17. Present thinking indicates that a substantial •reduction in the potential for incendive spark production is achieved by a sleeve<br><br>
WO 2005/093214	PCT/SE2005/000431<br>
11<br>
31 or 31' having the approximate dimensions shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively, relative to the remaining components of the cutting pick 30, 30'.<br>
It will be appreciated that by proper selection of the material of the sleeve' 31, that the sleeve 31 will also provide wear protection for the cylindrical section 16 of the shank 10. While wear protection is not its primary function, advantageously, this secondary function can significantly improve the life of the cutting pick. Moreover, the effect of the invention to reduce spark production can only occur while the sleeve remains intact. That is, if the sleeve wears away, the benefits of the invention will be lost. Accordingly, it is preferred that the sleeve resists wear for the anticipated life of the cutting pick.<br>
Referring now to Figure 4 an alternative embodiment of a cutting pick 30' according to the invention, in which the likelihood of spark production is reduced. The cutting pick 30' of Figure 4 employs the body section 12 and cutting tip 11 of Figure 3 and therefore the same reference numerals as used in those figures are employed in Figure 4.<br>
In Figure 4, a composite sleeve 31', formed of three sleeve portions or rings 32, 32' is disposed about the outer cylindrical surfaces of first 16 and second 16' cylindrical sections. Each of the rings 32, 32' is formed separately from one another, and is fitted about the cylindrical section 16, 16' in a snug or slightly frictional fitting, and is brazed to the outer surfaces. Two of the rings 32, the cylindrical section 16 and the first shoulder 17 are identical to the ones previously disclosed in Fig. 3. The most remote ring of the rings 32 from the cutting tip 11 is also brazed to the first shoulder 17. The additional third ring 32' is also brazed to a second shoulder 17'. The dimensions of the cylindrical section 16', the second shoulder 17' and the ring 32' are greater than the dimensions of the corresponding parts 16, 17 and 32. As shown, the rings 32, 32' provide substantially complete protection for the outer surfaces of the cylindrical sections 16,16'. Thus, the shank 10' of the above kind defines a second shoulder 17', which is axially spaced from the first shoulder 17 in a direction away from the cutting tip 11, and in this arrangement, a second sleeve 32' is attached about the shank to extend between the first 17 and second 1T shoulders. In this manner, a further portion of the shank can be protected against contact with the earth face and so further lessen the risk of incendive spark production.<br><br>

In the arrangement discussed above the annular sleeve could also be supported at one axial end on the first shoulder 17, while the other axial end extends towards but terminates prior to the first end of the cylindrical section 16 so that a cylindrical portion of the cylindrical section remains exposed.<br>
The arrangement discussed above in which a second shoulder is provided, can be repeated as required, to create a third shoulder and further shoulders as necessary. Accordingly, by this arrangement, an ever increasing axial length of the shank can be protected.<br>
In the arrangements discussed above, when more than a single shoulder is provided, it is preferable that the shank portions between the respective shoulders are cylindrical and that each portion increases in diameter in a direction away from the cutting tip.<br>
