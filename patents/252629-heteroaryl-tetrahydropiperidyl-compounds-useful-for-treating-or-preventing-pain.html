				<td>"Heteroaryl-Tetrahydropiperidyl Compounds Useful for Treating or<br>
Preventing Pain"<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application no. 60/489,516, filed July 24, 2003, the disclosure of the provisional application being incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to Tetrahydropyndyl Compounds, compositions comprising an effective amount of a Tetrahydropyridyl Compound and methods for treating or preventing a condition such as pain comprising administering to an animal in need thereof an effective amount of a Tetrahydropyridyl Compound.<br>
2. BACKGROUND OF TO INVENTION<br>
Pain is-the most common symptom for which patients seek medical advice and treatment. Pain can be acute or chronic. While acute pain is usually self-limited, chronic pain persists for 3 months or longer and can lead to significant changes in a patient's personality, lifesnle. functional ability and overall quality of life (K.M. Foley. Pain, in Cecil Textbook of Medicine 100-107 (J.C. Bennett and F. Plum eds.. 20th ed. 1996)).<br>
Moreover, chronic pain can be classified as either nociceptive or neuropathic. Nociceptive pain includes tissue injury-induced pain and inflammatory pain such as that associated w ith arthritis. Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to the peripheral or cental nervous system and is maintained by aberrant somatosensory processing. There is a large body of e\idence relating activity at both Group 1 mGluRs (mGluRl and mGluR5) (M.E. Fundytus. CNS Drugs 15:29-58 (2001)) and vanilloid receptors (VR1) (V.Di Marzo et al.. Current Opinion in Neurobiology 12:372 379 (2002)) to pain processing. Inhibiting mGluRl or mGluR5 reduces pain, as shown by in vivo treatment with antibodies selecti\e for either mGluRl or mGluR5. where neuropathic pain in rats was attenuated (M.E. Fundytus et al.. NeuroReporl 9:731-735 (1998)). It has also been shown that antisense oligonucleotide knockdown of mGluRl alleviates both neuropathic and jnllammaton pain (M.F. Fundytus et al.. British Journal of Pharmacology 132:354 367 (2001): M.F. Fundytus el al.. Pharmacology, Biochemsitn, &amp; Behavior 73:401-410 (2002)). Small molecule antagonists for mGluR5- attenuated pain in in vivo animal<br>
models are disclosed in, e.g., K. Walker et al, Neuropharmacology 40:1-9 (2000) and A. Dogrul et al., Neuroscience Letters 292:115-118 (2000)).<br>
Nociceptive pain has been traditionally managed by administering non-opioid analgesics, such as acetylsalicylic acid, choline magnesium trisalicylate, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, fenoprofen, diflusinal, and naproxen; or opioid analgesics, including morphine, hydromorphone, methadone, levorphanol, fentanyl, oxycodone, and oxymorphone. Id. In addition to the above-listed treatments, neuropathic pain, which can be difficult to treat, has also been treated with anti-epileptics (e.g. gabapentin, carbamazepine, valproic aeid, topiramate, phenytoin), NMDA antagonists (e.g. ketamine, dextromethorphan), topical lidocaine (for post-herpetic neuralgia), and tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline and amitriptyline).<br>

Urinary incontinence ("UF') is uncontrollable urination, generally caused by bladder-detrusor-muscle instability. UI affects people of all ages and levels of physical health, both in health care settings and in the community at large. Physiologic bladder contraction results in large part from acetylcholine-induced stimulation of postganglionic muscarinic-receptor sites on bladder smooth muscle. Treatments for UI include the administration of drugs having bladder-relaxant properties, which help to control bladder-detrusor-muscle overactivity. For example, anticholinergics such as propantheline bromide and glycopyrrolate, and combinations of smooth-muscle relaxants such as a combination of racemic oxybutynin and dicyclomine or an anticholinergic, have been used to treat UI {See, e.g., A.J. Wein, Urol. Clin. N. Am. 22:557-577 (1995); Levin et al., J. Urol. 128:396-398 (1982); Cooke et al, S. Afr. Med. J. 63:3 (1983); R.K. Mirakhur et al, Anaesthesia 38:1195-1204 (1983)). These drugs are not effective, however, in all patients having uninhibited bladder contractions. Administration of anticholinergic medications represent the mainstay of this type of treatment.<br>
None of the existing commercial drug treatments for UI has achieved complete success in all classes of UI patients, nor has treatment occurred without significant adverse side effects. For example, drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision.<br>
headaches, tachycardia, and cardiac arrhythmia, which are related to the anticholinergic activity of traditional anti-UI drugs, can occur frequently and adversely affect patient compliance. Yet despite the prevalence of unwanted anticholinergic effects in many patients, anticholinergic drugs are currently prescribed for patients having UI. The Merck Manual of Medical Information 631-634 (R. Berkow ed., 1997).<br>
Ulcers are sores occurring where the lining of the digestive tract has been eroded by stomach acids or digestive juices. The sores are typically well-defined round or oval lesions primarily occurring in the stomach and duodenum. About 1 in 10 people develop an ulcer. Ulcers develop as a result of an imbalance between acid-secretory factors, also known as "aggressive factors," such as stomach acid, pepsin, and Helicobacter pylori infection, and local mucosal-protective factors, such as secretion of bicarbonate, mucus, and prostaglandins.<br>
Treatment of ulcers typically involves reducing or inhibiting the aggressive factors. For example, antacids such as aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate, and calcium bicarbonate can be used to neutralize stomach acids. Antacids, however, can cause alkalosis, leading to nausea, headache, and weakness. Antacids can also interfere with the absorption of other drugs into the blood stream and cause diarrhea.<br>
H2 antagonists, such as cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, and nizatidine, are also used to treat ulcers. H2 antagonists promote ulcer healing by reducing gastric acid and digestive-enzyme secretion elicited by histamine and other H2 agonists in the stomach and duodenum. H2 antagonists, however, can cause breast enlargement and impotence in men, mental changes (especially in the elderly), headache, dizziness, nausea, myalgia, diarrhea, rash, and fever.<br>
H+, K+ - ATPase inhibitors such as omeprazole and lansoprazole are also used to treat ulcers. H+, K+ - ATPase inhibitors inhibit the production of enzymes used by the stomach to secrete acid. Side effects associated with H+, K+ - ATPase inhibitors include nausea, diarrhea, abdominal colic, headache, dizziness, somnolence, skin rashes, and transient elevations of plasma activities of aminotransferases.<br>
Sucraflate is also used to treat ulcers. Sucraflate adheres to epithelial cells and is believed to form a protective coating at the base of an ulcer to promote healing.<br>
Sucraflate, however, can cause constipation, dry mouth, and interfere with the absorption of other drugs.<br>
Antibiotics are used when Helicobacter pylori is the underlying cause of the ulcer. Often antibiotic therapy is coupled with the administration of bismuth compounds such as bismuth subsalicylate and colloidal bismuth citrate. The bismuth compounds are believed to enhance secretion of mucous and HCO3', inhibit pepsin activity, and act as an antibacterial against H. pylori. Ingestion of bismuth compounds, however, can lead to elevated plasma concentrations of Bi+3 and can interfere with the absorption of other drugs.<br>
Prostaglandin analogues, such as misoprostal, inhibit secretion of acid and stimulate the secretion of mucous and bicarbonate and are also used to treat ulcers, especially ulcers in patients who require nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Effective oral doses of prostaglandin analogues, however, can cause diarrhea and abdominal cramping. In addition, some prostaglandin analogues are abortifacients.<br>
Carbenoxolone, a mineral corticoid, can also be used to treat ulcers. Carbenoxolone appears to alter the composition and quantity of mucous, thereby enhancing the mucosal barrier. Carbenoxolone, however, can lead to Na+ and fluid retention, hypertension, hypokalemia, and impaired glucose tolerance.<br>
Muscarinic cholinergic antagonists such as pirenzapine and telenzapine can also be used to reduce acid secretion and treat ulcers. Side effects of muscarinic cholinergic antagonists include dry mouth, blurred vision, and constipation. The Merck Manual of Medical Information 496-500 (R. Berkow ed., 1997) and Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics 901-915 (J. Hardman and L. Limbird eds., 9th ed. 1996).<br>
Inflammatory-bowel disease ("IBD") is a chronic disorder in which the bowel becomes inflamed, often causing recurring abdominal cramps and diarrhea. The two types of IBD are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.<br>
Crohn's disease, which can include regional enteritis, granulomatous ileitis, and ileocolitis, is a chronic inflammation of the intestinal wall. Crohn's disease occurs equally in both sexes and is more common in Jews of eastern-European ancestry. Most cases of Crohn's disease begin before age 30 and the majority start between the ages of<br>
14 and 24. The disease typically affects the full thickness of the intestinal wall. Generally the disease affects the lowest portion of the small intestine (ileum) and the large intestine, but can occur in any part of the digestive tract.<br>
Early symptoms of Crohn's disease are chronic diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain, fever, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Complications associated with Crohn's disease include the development of intestinal obstructions, abnormal connecting channels (fistulas), and abscesses. The risk of cancer of the large intestine is increased in people who have Crohn's disease. Often Crohn's disease is associated with other disorders such as gallstones, inadequate absorption of nutrients, amyloidosis, arthritis, episcleritis, aphthous stomatitis, erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, ankylosing spondylitis, sacroilitis, uveitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. There is no known cure for Crohn's disease.<br>
Cramps and diarrhea, side effects associated with Crohn's disease, can be relieved by anticholinergic drugs, diphenoxylate, loperamide, deodorized opium tincture, or codeine. Generally, the drug is taken orally before a meal.<br>
Broad-spectrum antibiotics are often administered to treat the symptoms of Crohn's disease. The antibiotic metronidazole is often administered when the disease affects the large intestine or causes abscesses and fistulas around the anus. Long-term use of metronidazole, however, can damage nerves, resulting in pins-and-needles sensations in the arms and legs. Sulfasalazine and chemically related drugs can suppress mild inflammation, especially in the large intestine. These drugs, however, are less effective in sudden, severe flare-ups. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, reduce fever and diarrhea and relieve abdominal pain and tenderness. Long-term corticosteroid therapy, however, invariably results in serious side effects such as high blood-sugar levels, increased risk of infection, osteoporosis, water retention, and fragility of the skin. Drugs such as azathioprine and mercaptourine can compromise the immune system and are often effective for Crohn's disease in patients that do not respond to other drugs. These drugs, however, usually need 3 to 6 months before they produce benefits and can cause serious side effects such as allergy, pancreatitis, and low white-blood-cell count.<br>
When Crohn's disease causes the intestine to be obstructed or when abscesses or fistulas do not heal, surgery can be necessary to remove diseased sections of the intestine. Surgery, however, docs not cure the disease, and inflammation tends to recur<br>
where the intestine is rejoined. In almost half of the cases a second operation is needed. The Merck Manual of Medical Information 528-530 (R. Berkow ed., 1997;.<br>
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic disease in which the large intestine becomes inflamed and ulcerated, leading to episodes of bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever. Ulcerative colitis usually begins between ages 15 and 30; however, a small group of people have their first attack between ages 50 and 70. Unlike Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis never affects the small intestine and does not affect the full thickness of the intestine. The disease usually begins in the rectum and the sigmoid colon and eventually spreads partially or completely throughout the large intestine. The cause of ulcerative colitis is unknown.<br>
Treatment of ulcerative colitis is directed to controlling inflammation, reducing symptoms, and replacing lost fluids and nutrients. Anticholinergic drugs and low doses of diphenoxylate or loperamide are administered for treating mild diarrhea. For more intense diarrhea higher doses of diphenoxylate or loperamide, or deodorized opium tincture or codeine are administered. Sulfasalazine, olsalazine, prednisone, or mesalamine can be used to reduce inflammation. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine have been used to maintain remissions in ulcerative-colitis patients who would otherwise need long-term corticosteroid treatment. In severe cases of ulcerative colitis the patient is hospitalized and given corticosteroids intravenously. People with severe rectal bleeding can require transfusions and intravenous fluids. If toxic colitis develops and treatments fail, surgery to remove the large intestine can be necessary. Non-emergency surgery can be performed if cancer is diagnosed, precancerous lesions are detected, or unremitting chronic disease would otherwise make the person an invalid or dependent on high doses of corticosteroids. Complete removal of the large intestine and rectum permanently cures ulcerative colitis. The Merck Manual of Medical Information 530-532 (R. Berkow ed., 1997) and Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (J. Hardman and L. Limbird eds., 9th ed. 1996).<br>
Irritable-bowel syndrome ("IBS") is a disorder of motility of the entire gastrointestinal tract, causing abdominal pain, constipation, and/or diarrhea. IBS affects three-times more women than men. In IBS stimuli such as stress, diet, drugs, hormones, or irritants can cause the gastrointestinal tract to contract abnormally. During an episode of IBS. contractions of the gastrointestinal tract become stronger and more frequent.<br>
resulting in the rapid transit of food and feces through the small intestine, often leading to diarrhea. Cramps result from the strong contractions of the large intestine and increased sensitivity of pain receptors in the large intestine.<br>
There are two major types of IBS. The first type, spastic-colon type, is commonly triggered by eating, and usually produces periodic constipation and diarrhea with pain. Mucous often appears in the stool. The pain can come in bouts of continuous dull aching pain or cramps, usually in the lower abdomen. The person suffering from spastic-colon type IBS can also experience bloating, gas, nausea, headache, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating. The second type of IBS usually produces painless diarrhea or constipation. The diarrhea can begin suddenly and with extreme urgency. Often the diarrhea occurs soon after a meal and can sometimes occur immediately upen awakening.<br>
Treatment of IBS typically involves modification of an IBS-patient's diet. Often it is recommended that an IBS patient avoid beans, cabbage, sorbitol, and fructose. A low-fat, high-fiber diet can also help some IBS patients. Regular physical activity can also help keep the gastrointestinal tract functioning properly. Drugs such as propantheline that slow the function of the gastrointestinal tract are generally not effective for treating IBS. Antidiarrheal drugs, such as diphenoxylate and loperamide, help with diarrhea. The Merck Manual of Medical Information 525-526 (R. Berkow ed., 1997).<br>
Certain pharmaceutical agents have been administered for treating addiction. U.S. Patent No. 5,556,838 to Mayer et al. discloses the use of nontoxic NMDA-blocking agents co-administered with an addictive substance to prevent the development of tolerance or withdrawal symptoms. U.S. Patent No. 5,574,052 to Rose et al discloses co-administration of an addictive substance with an antagonist to partially block the pharmacological effects of the addictive substance. U.S. Patent No. 5,075,341 to Mendelson et al discloses the use of a mixed opiate agonist/antagonist to treat cocaine and opiate addiction. U.S. Patent No. 5,232,934 to Downs discloses administration of 3-phenoxypyridine to treat addiction. U.S. Patents No. 5,039,680 and 5,198,459 to Imperato et al disclose using a serotonin antagonist to treat chemical addiction. U.S. Patent No. 5.556.S37 to Nestlcr et. al. discloses infusing BDNF or NT-4 growth factors to inhibit or rezerse neurological adaptive changes that correlate with behavioral changes<br>
in an addicted individual. U.S. Patent. No. 5,762,925 to Sagan discloses implanting encapsulated adrenal medullary cells into an animal's central nervous system to inhibit the development of opioid intolerance. U.S. Patent No. 6,204,284 to Beer et al. discloses racemic (+)-l-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane for use in the prevention or relief of a withdrawal syndrome resulting from addiction to drugs and for the treatment of chemical dependencies.<br>
Without treatment, Parkinson's disease progresses to a rigid akinetic state in which patients are incapable of caring for themselves. Death frequently results from complications of immobility, including aspiration pneumonia or pulmonary embolism. Drugs commonly used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease include carbidopa/levodopa, pergolide, bromocriptine, selegiline, amantadine, and trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride. There remains, however, a need for drugs useful for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and having an improved therapeutic profile.<br>
Currently, benzodiazepines are the most commonly used anti-anxiety agents for generalized anxiety disorder. Benzodiazepines, however, carry the risk of producing impairment of cognition and skilled motor functions, particularly in the elderly, which can result in confusion, delerium, and falls with fractures. Sedatives are also commonly prescribed for treating anxiety. The azapirones, such as buspirone, are also used to treat moderate anxiety. The azapirones, however, are less useful for treating severe anxiety accompanied with panic attacks.<br>
Examples of drugs for treating a seizure and epilepsy include carbamazepine, ethosuximide. gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytom, primidone, valproic acid, trimethadione, benzodiazepines, -vinyl GABA, acetazolamide, and felbamate. Anti-seizure drugs, however, can have side effects such as drowsiness; hyperactivity: hallucinations; inability to concentrate; central and peripheral nervous system toxicity, such as nystagmus, ataxia, diplopia, and vertigo; gingival hyperplasia; gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, and anorexia; endocrine effects such as inhibition of antidiuretic hormone, hyperglycemia, glycosuria, osteomalacia; and hypersensitivity such as scarlatiniform rash, morbilliform rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic necrosis; and hematological reactions such as red-cell aplasia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia,<br>
and megaloblastic anemia. The Merck Manual of Medical Information 345-350 (R. Berkow ed., 1997).<br>
Symptoms of strokes vary depending on what part of the brain is affected. Symptoms include loss or abnormal sensations in an arm or leg or one side of the body, weakness or paralysis of an arm or leg or one side of the body, partial loss of vison or hearing, double vision, dizziness, slurred speech, difficulty in thinking of the appropriate word or saying it, inability to recognize parts of the body, unusual movements, loss of bladder control, imbalance, and falling, and fainting. The symptoms can be permanent and can be associated with coma or stupor. Examples of drugs for treating strokes include anticoagulants such as heparin, drugs that break up clots such as streptokinase or tissue plasminogen activator, and drugs that reduce swelling such as mannitol or corticosteroids. The Merck Manual of Medical Information 352-355 (R. Berkow ed., 1997).<br>
Pruritus is an unpleasant sensation that prompts scratching. Conventionally, pruritus is treated by phototherapy with ultraviolet B or PUVA or with therapeutic agents such as naltrexone, nalmefene, danazol, tricyclics, and antidepressants.<br>
Selective antagonists of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 ("mGluR5") have been shown to exert analgesic activity in in vivo animal models (K. Walker et al., Neuropharmacology 40:1-9 (2000) and A. Dogrul et al., Neuroscience Letters, 292(2): 115-118(2000)1.<br>
Selective antagonists of the mGluR5 receptor have also been shown to exert anxiolytic and anti-depressant activity in in vivo animal models (E. Tatarczynska et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. 132(7): 1423-1430 (2001) and PJ.M. Will et al, Trends in Pharmacological Sciences 22(7):331-37 (2001)).<br>
Selective antagonists of the mGluR5 receptor have also been shown to exert anti-Parkinson activity in vivo (K. J. Ossowska et al, Neuropharmacology 41(4):413-20 (2001) and P.J.M. Will et al., Trends in Pharmacological Sciences 22(7):331-37 (2001)).<br>
Selective antagonists of the mGluR5 receptor have also been shown to exert anti-dependence activity in vivo (C. Chiamulera et al, Nature Neuroscience 4(9):873-74 (2001)).<br>

4.6 THERAPEUTIC/PROPHYLACTIC ADMINISTRATION AND COMPOSITIONS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Due to their activity, the Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds are advantageously useful in veterinary and human medicine. As described above, the Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds are useful for treating or preventing a condition in an animal in need thereof.<br>
When administered to an animal, the Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds are administered as a component of a composition that comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. The present compositions, which comprise a Tetrahydropyridyl Compound, can be administered orally. The Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds of the invention can also be administered by any other convenient route, for example, by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or<br><br>
mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral, rectal, and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and can be administered together with another therapeutically active agent. Administration can be systemic or local. Various delivery systems are known, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, capsules, etc., and can be used to administer the Tetrahydropyridyl Compound.<br>
Methods of administration include, but are not limited to, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, oral, sublingual, intracerebral, intravaginal, transdermal, rectal, by inhalation, or topical, particularly to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin. The mode of administration is left to the discretion of the practitioner. In most instances, administration will result in the release of the Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds into the bloodstream.<br>
In specific embodiments, it can be desirable to administer the Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds locally. This can be achieved, for example, and not by way of limitation, by local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository or enema, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers.<br>
In certain embodiments, it can be desirable to introduce the Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds into the central nervous system or gastrointestinal tract by any suitable route, including intraventricular, intrathecal, and epidural injection, and enema. Intraventricular injection can be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir.<br>
Pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent, or via perfusion in a fluorocarbon or synthetic pulmonary surfactant. In certain embodiments, the Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and excipients such as triglycerides.<br>
In another embodiment, the Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990) and Treat et al., Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer 317-327 and 353-365 (1989)).<br>
In yet another embodiment, the Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds can be delivered in a controlled-release system or sustained- release system (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)). Other controlled-or sustained-release systems discussed in the review by Langer, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990) can be used. In one embodiment, a pump can be used (Langer, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990); Sefton, CRC Crit. Ref. Piomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987); Buchwald et a!., Surgery 18:507 (1980); and Saudek et al., N Engl. J. Med. 321:574 (1989)). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (see Medical Applications of Controlled Release (Langer and Wise eds., 1974); Controlled Drug Pioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance (Smolen and Ball eds., 1984); Ranger and Peppas, J. Macromod. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23:61 (1983); Levy et al., Science 228:190 (1985); luring et al., Ann. Neurol. 25:351 (1989); and Howard et al., J. Neurosurg. 71:105 (1989)). In yet another embodiment, a controlled- or sustainedrelease system can be placed in proximity of a target of the Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds, e.g., the spinal column, brain, or gastrointestinal tract, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose.<br>
The present compositions can optionally comprise a suitable amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient so as to provide the form for proper administration to the animal.<br>
Such pharmaceutical excipients can be liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. The pharmaceutical excipients can be saline, gum acacia, gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea and the like. In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating, and coloring agents can be used. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are sterile when administered to an animal. Water is a particularly useful excipient when the Tetrahydropyridyl Compound is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid excipients, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients also include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The present compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents.<br>
The present compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, pellets, capsules, capsules containing liquids, powders, sustained-release formulations, suppositories, emulsions, aerosols, sprays, suspensions, or any other form suitable for use. In one embodiment, the composition is in the form of a capsule (see e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,695,155). Other examples of suitable pharmaceutical excipients are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 1447-1676 (Alfonso R. Gennaro ed., 19th ed. 1995), incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In one embodiment, the Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds are formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a composition adapted for oral administration to human beings. Compositions for oral delivery can be in the form of tablets, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, granules, powders, emulsions, capsules, syrups, or elixirs, for example. Orally administered compositions can contain one or more agents, for example, sweetening agents such as fructose, aspartame or saccharin; flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry; coloring agents; and preserving agents, to provide a pharmaceutically palatable preparation. Moreover, where in tablet or pill form, the compositions can be coated to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving compound are also suitable for orally administered compositions. In these latter platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations. A time-delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol stearate can also be used. Oral compositions can include standard excipients such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, cellulose, and magnesium carbonate. In one embodiment, the excipients are of pharmaceutical grade.<br>
In another embodiment, the Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds can be formulated for intravenous administration. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration comprise sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the compositions can also include a solubilizing agent. Compositions for intravenous administration can optionally include a local anesthetic such as lidocaine to lessen pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage<br>
form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds are to be administered by infusion, they can be dispensed, for example, with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds are administered by injection, an ampule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients can be mixed prior to administration.<br>
The Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds can be administered by controlled- release or sustained-release means or by delivery devices that are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Patent Nos.: 3,845,770; 3, 916,899; 3, 536,809; 3,598,123; 4,008,719; 5,674,533; 5,059,595; 5,591, 767; 5,120,548; 5,073,543; 5,639,476; 5,354,556; and 5,733,566, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such dosage forms can be used to provide controlledor sustained-release of one or more active ingredients using, for example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes, microspheres, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled- or sustained-release formulations known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for use with the active ingredients of the invention. The invention thus encompasses single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled- or sustained-release.<br>
Controlled- or sustained-release pharmaceutical compositions can have a common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non- controlled or non-sustained counterparts. In one embodiment, a controlled- or sustained-release composition comprises a minimal amount of a Tetrahydropyridyl Compound to cure or control the condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled- or sustained-release compositions include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage frequency, and increased patient compliance. In addition, controlled- or sustainedrelease compositions can favorably affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the Tetrahydropyridyl Compound, and can thus reduce the occurrence of adverse side effects.<br>
Controlled- or sustained-release compositions can initially release an amount of a Tetrahydropyridyl Compound that promptly produces the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect, and gradually and continually release other amounts of the Tetrahydropyridyl Compound to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. To maintain a constant level of the Tetrahydropyridyl Compound in the body, the Tetrahydropyridyl Compound can be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of Tetrahydropyridyl Compound being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled- or sustained-release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by various conditions, including but not limited to, changes in pH, changes in temperature, concentration or availability of enzymes, concentration or availability of water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.<br>
The amount of the Tetrahydropyridyl Compound that is effective in the treatment or prevention of a condition can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro or in vivo assays can optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the Condition and can be decided according to the judgment of a practitioner and and/or each animal's circumstances. Suitable effective dosage amounts, however, range from about 0.01 mg/kg of body weight to about 2500 mg/kg of body weight, although they are typically about 100 mg/kg of body weight or less. In one embodiment, the effective dosage amount ranges from about 0.01 mg/kg of body weight to about 100 mg/kg of body weight of a Tetrahydropyridyl Compound, in another embodiment, about 0.02 mg/kg of body weight to about 50 mg/kg of body weight, and in another embodiment, about 0.025 mg/kg of body weight to about 20 mg/kg of body weight. In one embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 24 h until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 12 h until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 8 h until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 6 h until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 4 h until the Condition is abated. The effective dosage amounts described herein refer to total amounts administered; that is, if<br>
more than one Tetrahydropyridyl Compound is administered, the effective dosage amounts correspond to the total amount administered.<br>
Where a cell capable of expressing VR1, mGluR5 or mGluRl is contacted with a Tetrahydropyridyl Compound in vitro, the amount effective for inhibiting the VR1, mGluR5 or mGluRl receptor function in a cell will typically range from about 0.01 µg/L to about 5 mg/L, in one embodiment, from about 0.01 µg/L to about 2.5 mg/L, in another embodiment, from about 0.01 µg/L to about 0.5 mg/L, and in another embodiment, from about 0.01 &amp;lsqb;. µg/L to about 0.25 mg/L of a solution or suspension of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. In one embodiment, the volume of solution or suspension comprising the Tetrahydropyridyl Compound is from about 0.01 gL to about 1 mL. In another embodiment, the volume of solution or suspension is about 200 µL.<br>
Where a cell capable of expressing VR1, mGluR5, or mGluRl is contacted with a Tetrahydropyridyl.Compound in vivo, the amount effective for inhibiting the receptor function in a cell will typically range from about 0.01 mg/kg of body weight to about 2500 mg/kg of body weight, although it typically ranges from about 100 mg/kg of body weight or less. In one embodiment, the effective dosage amount ranges from about 0.01 mg/kg of body weight to about 100 mg/kg of body weight of a Tetrahydropyridyl<br>
Compound, in another embodiment, about 0.020 mg/kg of body weight to about 50 mg/kg of body weight, and in another embodiment, about 0.025 mg/kg of body weight to about 20 mg/kg of body weight. In one embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 24 h. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 12 h. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 8 h. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 6 h. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 4 h. The Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds can be assayed in vitro or in vivo for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity prior to use in humans. Animal model systems can be used to demonstrate safety and efficacy.<br>
The present methods for treating or preventing a Condition in an animal in need thereof can further comprise administering to the animal being administered a<br>
Tetrahydropyridyl Compound another therapeutic agent. In one embodiment, the other therapeutic agent is administered in an effective amount.<br>
The present methods for inhibiting VR1 function in a cell capable of expressing VR1 can further comprise contacting the cell with an effective amount of another therapeutic agent.<br>
The present methods for inhibiting mGluR5 function in a cell capable of expressing mGluR5 can further comprise contacting the cell with an effective amount of another therapeutic agent.<br>
The present methods for inhibiting mGluRl function in a cell capable of expressing mGluRl can further comprise contacting the cell with an effective amount of another therapeutic agent.<br>
Effective amounts of the other therapeutic agents are known to those skilled in the art. However, it is within the skilled artisan's purview to determine the other therapeutic agent's optimal effective- amount range. In one embodiment of the invention, where another therapeutic agent is administered to an animal, the effective amount of the Tetrahydropyridyl Compound is less than its effective amount would be where the other therapeutic agent is not administered. In this case, without being bound by theory, it is believed that the Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds and the other therapeutic agent act synergistically to treat or prevent a Condition.<br>

A solution of 4-ferf-butyl phenyl isocyanate 22 (2.45 g, 14 mmol) (commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO (www.sigma-aldrich.com)) in DCM (7 mL) was added to a solution of l,4-dioxa-8-azaspiro[4,5Jdecane 21 (2g, 14 mmol) (commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO (www.sigma-aldrich.com)) in DCM (7 mL) at about 25°C and the resulting reaction mixture was allowed to stir for 5 minutes. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to provide a compound of formula 23. The compound of formula 23 was dissolved in THF (20 mL) and 1N HC1 in acetic acid (30 mL) was added to the solution. The resulting reaction mixture was then heated at reflux temperature for about 3 h, cooled to about 25°C, and the solvent removed under reduced pressure to provide a residue. The resulting residue was dissolved in DCM, neutralized with saturated aqueous Na2CO3 solution, and the organic<br>
layer separated from the aqueous layer. The aqueous layer was then extracted three times with DCM and the DCM layers combined. The combined DCM layers were dried (MgSO4) and the DCM removed under reduced pressure to provide a compound of formula 24. The compound of formula 24 was purified by column chromatography using a silica gel column eluted with hexane/ethyl acetate (1:1). The compound of formula 24 was obtained as a white solid (1.6 g, 42% yield).<br>
The compound of formula 24 (1 g, 3.64 mmol) was dissolved in THF (100 mL) and the resulting solution cooled to about -78°C. To the cooled solution was then added a 1M solution of LiHMDS in THF (8.75 ml, 8.75 mmol) and the resulting reaction mixture was allowed to stir at about -78°C for about 2 h. After stirring for 2 n, of 2-[N,N-bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amino]-5-chloropyridine 5 (commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO (www.sigma-aldrich.com)) (1.43 g, 3.64 mmol), dissolved in about 5 mL of THF at -78°C, was added to the reaction mixture and the reaction mixture was allowed to stir at -78 C for another 2 h. The reaction mixture was then allowed to warm to about 25°C and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to provide a residue. The resulting residue was purified by column chromatography using a silica gel column eluted with hexane/ethyl acetate (5:1) to provide a compound of formula 25 as white solids (0.9 g, 62% yield).<br>
The compound of formula 25, (0.9 g, 2.21 mmol) and palladium tetrakistriphenylphosphine (Pd(PPh3)4) (128 mg, 0.11-1 mmol) were dissolved in THF (50ml) and 0.5 M solution of a compound of 3-methyl-2-pyridylzinc bromide 26 in THF (13.3 ml, 6.64 mmol) (commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO (www.sigma-aldrich.com)) was added to the reaction mixture.

5.6 EXAMPLE 6: BINDING OF TETRAHYYHROPIPERIDYL COMPOUNDS<br>
TO mGIuR5<br>
The following assay can be used to demonstrate that Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds bind to mG 1 uR5 and. accordingly, are useful for treating or preventing, e.g.. pain.<br>
Cell cultures: Primary glial cultures are prepared from cortices of SpragueDawley 18 days old embryos. The cortices are dissected and then dissociated by trituration. The resulting cell homogenate is plated onto poly-D-lysine precoated T175 flasks (BIOCOAT. commercially available from Becton Dickinson and Company. Inc. of Franklin Lakes, NJ) in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium ("DMEM," pH 7.4), buffered with 25 mM HEPES, and supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum ("FCS," commercially available from Hyclone Laboratories Inc. of Omaha, NE). and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO:. After 24 hours. FCS supplementation is reduced to 10%. On day six. oligodendrocytes and microglia are removed by strongly tapping the sides of the<br>
flasks. One day following this purification step, secondary astrocyte cultures are established by subplating onto 96 poly-D-lysine precoated T175 flasks (BIOCOAT) at a density of 65,000 cells/well in DMEM and 10% FCS. After 24 hours, the astrocytes are washed with serum free medium and then cultured in DMEM, without glutamate, supplemented with 0. 5% FCS, 20 mM HEPES, 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor ("EGF"), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and IX penicillin/streptomycin at pH 7.5 for 3 to 5 days at 37°C and 5% CO2. The procedure allows the expression of the mGluR5 receptor by astrocytes, as demonstrated by S. Miller et al., J. Neuroscience 15(9) :6103-6109 (1995).<br>
Assay Protocol: After 3-5 days incubation with EGF, the astrocytes are washed with 127 mM NaCl, 5 mM KC1, 2 MM M9C12, 700 mM NaH2PO4, 2mM CaCl2, 5mM NaHCO3, 8 mM HEPES, 10 mM Glucose at pH 7.4 ("Assay Buffer") and loaded with the dye Fluo-4 (commercially available from Molecular Probes Inc. of Eugene, OR) using 0.1 mL of Assay Buffer containing Fluo-4 (3 mM final). After 90 minutes of dye loading, the cells are then washed twice with 0.2 mL Assay Buffer and resuspended in 0.1 mL of Assay Buffer. The plates containing the astrocytes are then transferred to a Fluorometric Imaging Plate reader ("FLIPR," commercially available from Molecular Devices Corporation of Sunnyvale, CA) for the assessment of calcium mobilization flux in the presence of glutamate and in the presence or absence of antagonist. After monitoring fluorescence for 15 seconds to establish a baseline. DMSO solutions containing various concentrations of a Tetrahydropyridyl Compound diluted in Assay Buffer (0.05 mL of 4X dilutions for competition curves) are added to the cell plate and fluorescence is monitored for 2 minutes. 0.05 mL of a 4X glutamate solution (agonist) is then added to each well to provide a final glutamate concentration in each well of 10 mM. Plate fluorescence is then monitored for an additional 60 seconds after agonist addition. The final DMSO concentration in the assay is 1.0%. In each experiment, fluorescence is monitored as a function of time and the data analyzed using Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism. Dose-response curves are fit using a non-linear regression to determine the IC50 value. In each experiment, each data point is determined two times.<br>
5.7 EXAMPLE 7: IN VIVO ASSAYS FOR PREVENTION OR TREATMENT OF PAIN<br>
Test Animals: Each experiment uses rats weighing between 200-260 g at the start of the experiment. The rats are group-housed and have free access to food and water at all times, except prior to oral administration of a Tetrahydropyridyl Compound when food is removed for 16 hours before dosing. A control group acts as a comparison to rats treated with a Tetrahydropyridyl Compound. The control group is administered the carrier for the Tetrahydropyridyl Compound. The volume of carrier administered to the control group is the same as the volume of carrier and Tetrahydropyridyl Compound administered to the test group.<br>
Acute Pain: To assess the actions of the Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds for the treatment or prevention of acute pain the rat tail flick test can be used. Rats are gently restrained by hand and the tail exposed to a focused beam of radiant heat at a point 5 cm from the tip using a tail flick unit (Model 7360, commercially available from Ugo. Basile of Italy).<br>
Tail flick latencies are defined as the interval between the onset of the thermal stimulus and the flick of the tail. Animals not responding within 20 seconds are removed from the tail flick unit and assigned a withdrawal latency of 20 seconds. Tail flick latencies are measured immediately before (pre-treatment) and 1, 3. and 5 hours following administration of a Tetrahydropyridyl Compound. Data are expressed as tail flick latency(s) and the percentage of the maximal possible effect (%® MPE), i.e.. 20 seconds, is calculated as follows:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The rat tail flick test is described in F.E. D'Amour et al., "A Method for Determining Loss of Pain Sensation," J. Pharmacol. Exp. The?'. 72:7'4- 79 (1941).<br>
Acute pain can also be assessed by measuring the animal's response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining the paw withdrawal threshold ("PWT"). as described below.<br>
Inflammatory Pain: To assess the actions of the Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds for the treatment or prevention of inflammatory pain the Freund's complete adjuvant ("FCA") model of inflammatory pain is used. FCA-induced inflammation of the rat hind paw is associated with the development of persistent inflammatory mechanical hyperalgesia and provides reliable prediction of the anti-hyperalgesic action of clinically useful analgesic drugs (L. Bartho et al., "Involvement of Capsaicin-sensitive Neurones in Hyperalgesia and Enhanced Opioid Antinociception in Inflammation," Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacol. 342:666-670 (1990)). The left hind paw of each animal is administered a 50 µL intraplantar injection of 50% FCA. 24 hour post injection, the animal is assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining the PWT, as described below. Rats are then administered a single injection of 1, 3, 10 or 30 mg/Kg of either a Tetrahydropyridyl Compound; 30 mg/Kg of a control selected from Celebrex, indomethacin or naproxen; or carrier. Responses to noxious mechanical stimuli are then determined 1, 3. 5 and 24 hours post administration. Percentage reversal of hyperalgesia for each animal is defined as:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Neuropathic Pain: To assess the actions of the Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds for the treatment or prevention of neuropathic pain either the Seltzer model or the Chung model can be used.<br>
In the Seltzer model, the partial sciatic nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain is used to produce neuropathic hyperalgesia in rats (Z. Seltzer et al.. "A Novel Behavioral Model of Neuropathic Pain Disorders Produced in Rats by Partial Sciatic Nerve Injury," Pain 43:205-218 (1990)). Partial ligation of the left sciatic nerve is performed under isoflurane/O2 inhalation anaesthesia. Following induction of anesthesia, the left thigh of the rat is shaved and the sciatic nerve exposed at high thigh level through a small incision and is carefully cleared of surrounding connective tissues at a site near the trocanther just distal to the point at which the posterior biceps semitendinosus nerve branches off of the common sciatic nerve. A 7-0 silk suture is inserted into the nerve with a 3/8 curved, reversed-cutting mini-needle and tightly ligated<br><br>
so that the dorsal 1/3 to 1/2 of the nerve thickness is held within the ligature. The wound is closed with a single muscle suture (4-0 nylon (Vicryl)) and vetbond tissue glue. Following surgery, the wound area is dusted with antibiotic powder. Sham-treated rats undergo an identical surgical procedure except that the sciatic nerve is not manipulated. Following surgery, animals are weighed and placed on a warm pad until they recover from anesthesia. Animals are then returned to their home cages until behavioral testing begins. The animal is assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining PWT, as described below, prior to surgery (baseline), then immediately prior to and 1, 3, and 5 hours after drug administration for rear paw of the animal. Percentage reversal of neuropathic hyperalgesia is defined as:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In the Chung model, the spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain is used to produce mechanical hyperalgesia, thermal hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia in rats. Surgery is performed under isoflurane/O: inhalation anaesthesia. Following induction of anaesthesia a 3 cm incision is made and the left paraspinal muscles are separated from the spinous process at the L4-S2 levels. The L6 transverse process is carefully removed with a pair of small rongeurs to identify visually the I.4 - L6 spinal nerves. The left L5 (or L5 and L6) spinal nerve(s) is isolated and tightly ligated with silk thread. A complete hemostasis is confirmed and the wound is sutured using non-absorbable sutures, such as nylon sutures or stainless steel staples. Sham-treated rats undergo an identical surgical procedure except that the spinal nerve(s) is not manipulated. Following surgery animals are weighed, administered a subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of saline or ringers lactate, the wound area is dusted with antibiotic powder and they are kept on a warm pad until they recover from the anesthesia. Animals are then be returned to their home cages until behavioral testing begins. The animals are assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining PWT. as described below, prior to surgery (baseline), then immediately prior to and 1. 3. and 5 hours after being administered a Tetrahydropyridyl -<br>
Compound for the left rear paw of the animal. The animal can also be assessed for response to noxious thermal stimuli or for tactile allodynia, as described below. The Chung model for neuropathic pain is described in S.H. Kim, "An Experimental Model for Peripheral Neuropathy Produced by Segmental Spinal Nerve Ligation in the Rat," Pain 50(3):355-363 (1992).<br>
Response to Mechanical Stimuli as an Assessment of Mechanical Hyperalgesia; The paw pressure assay can be used to assess mechanical hyperalgesia. For this assay, hind paw withdrawal thresholds (PWT) to a noxious mechanical stimulus are determined using an analgesymeter (Model 7200, commercially available from Ugo Basile of Italy) as described in C. Stein, "Unilateral Inflammation of the Hindpaw in Rats as a Model of Prolonged Noxious Stimulation: Alterations in Behavior and Nociceptive Thresholds," Pharmacol. Biochem. and Behavior 31:451-455 (1988). The maximum weight that can be applied to the hind paw is set at 250 g and the end point is taken as complete withdrawal of the paw. PWT is determined once for each rat at each time point and only the affected (ipsilateral) paw is tested.<br>
Response to Thermal Stimuli as an Assessment of Thermal Hyperalgesia: The plantar test can be used to assess thermal hyperalgesia. For this test, hind paw withdrawal latencies to a noxious thermal stimulus are determined using a plantar test apparatus (commercially available from Ugo Basile of Italy) following the technique described by K. Hargreaves et al, "A New and Sensitive Method for Measuring Thermal Nociception in Cutaneous Hyperalgesia," Pain 32(l):77-88 (1988). The maximum exposure time is set at 32 seconds to avoid tissue damage and any directed paw withdrawal from the heat source is taken as the end point. Three latencies are determined at each time point and averaged. Only the affected (ipsilateral) paw is tested.<br>
Assessment of Tactile Allodynia: To assess tactile allodynia, rats are placed in clear, plexiglass compartments with a wire mesh floor and allowed to habituate for a period of at least 15 minutes. After habituation, a series of von Frey monofilaments are presented to the plantar surface of the left (operated) foot of each rat. The series of von Frey monofilaments consists of six monofilaments of increasing diameter, with the smallest diameter fiber presented first. Five trials are conducted with each filament with each trial separated by approximately 2 minutes. Each presentation lasts for a period of<br>
4-8 seconds or until a nociceptive withdrawal behavior is observed. Flinching, paw withdrawal or licking of the paw are considered nociceptive behavioral responses.<br>
5.8 EXAMPLE 8: IN VIVO ASSAYS FOR PREVENTION OR TREATMENT OF ANXIETY<br>
The elevated plus maze test or the shock-probe burying test can be used to assess the anxiolytic activity of Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds in rats or mice.<br>
The Elevated Plus Maze Test: The elevated plus maze consists of a platform with 4 arms, two open and two closed (50x10x5® cm enclosed with an open roof). Rats (or mice) are placed in the center of the platform, at the crossroad of the 4 arms, facing one of the closed arms. Time spent in the open arms vs the closed arms and number of open arm entries during the testing period are recorded. This test is conducted prior to drug administration and again after drug administration. Test results are expressed as the mean time spent in open arms and the mean number of entries into open arms. Known anxiolytic drugs increase both the time- spent in open arms and number of open arm entries. The elevated plus maze test is described in D. Treit, "Animal Models for the Study of Anti- anxiety Agents: A Review," Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews 9(2) :203- 222 (1985).<br>
The Shock-Probe Burying Test: For the shock-probe burying test the testing apparatus consists of a plexiglass box measuring 40x30x40 cm, evenly covered with approximately 5 cm of bedding material (odor absorbent kitty litter) with a small hole in one end through which a shock probe (6.5 cm long and 0.5 cm in diameter) is inserted. The plexiglass shock probe is helically wrapped with two copper wires through which an electric current is administered. The current is set at 2 mA. Rats are habituated to the testing apparatus for 30 min on 4 consecutive days without the shock probe in the box. On test day, rats are placed in one corner of the test chamber following drug administration. The probe is not electrified until the rat touches it with its snout or fore paws, at which point the rat receives a brief 2 mA shock. The 15 min testing period begins once the rat receives its first shock and the probe remains electrified for the remainder of the testing period. The shock elicits burying behavior by the rat. Following the first shock, the duration of time the rat spends spraying bedding material toward or over the probe with its snout or fore paws (burying behavior) is measured as well as the number of contact-induced shocks the rat receives from the probe. Known<br><br>
anxiolytic drugs reduce the amount of burying behavior. In addition, an index of the rat's reactivity to each shock is scored on a 4 point scale. The total time spent immobile during the 15 min testing period is used as an index of general activity. The shock-probe burying<br>
test is described in D. Treit, 1985, supra.<br>
5.9 EXAMPLE 9: IN VIVO ASSAYS FOR PREVENTION OR TREATMENT OF AN ADDICTIVE DISORDER<br>
The conditioned place preference test or drug self- administration test can be used to assess the ability of Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds to attenuate the rewarding properties of known drugs of abuse.<br>
The Conditioned Place Preference Test: The apparatus for the conditioned place preference test consists of two large compartments (45 x 45 x 30 cm) made of wood with a plexiglass front wall. These two large compartments are distinctly different. Doors at the back of each large compartment lead to a smaller box (36 x 18x20 cm) box made of wood, painted grey, with a ceiling of wire mesh. The two large compartments differ in terms of shading (white vs black), level of illumination (the plexiglass door of the white compartment is covered with aluminum foil except for a window of 7 x 7 cm), texture (the white compartment has a 3 cm thick floor board (40 x 40 cm) with nine equally spaced 5 cm diameter holes and the black has a wire mesh floor), and olfactory cues (saline in the white compartment and 1 mL of 10% acetic acid in the black compartment). On habituation and testing days, the doors to the small box remain open, giving the rat free access to both large compartments.<br>
The first session that a rat is placed in the apparatus is a habituation session and entrances to the smaller grey compartment remain open giving the rat free access to both large compartments. During habituation, rats generally show no preference for either compartment. Following habituation, rats are given 6 conditioning sessions. Rats are divided into 4 groups: carrier pre-treatment + carrier (control group), Tetrahydropyridyl Compound pre-treatment + carrier, carrier pre- treatment + morphine, Tetrahydropyridyl Compound pre-treatment + morphine. During each conditioning session the rat is injected with one of the drug combinations and confined to one compartment for 30 min. On the following day, the rat receives a carrier + carrier treatment and is confined to the other large compartment. Each rat receives three<br>
conditioning sessions consisting of 3 drug combination-compartment and 3 carriercompartment pairings. The order of injections and the drug/compartment pairings are counterbalanced within groups. On the test day, rats are injected prior to testing (30 min to 1 hour) with either morphine or carrier and the rat is placed in the apparatus, the doors to the grey compartment remain open and the rat is allowed to explore the entire apparatus for 20 min. The time spent in each compartment is recorded. Known drugs of abuse increase the time spent in the drug-paired compartment during the testing session. If the Tetrahydropyridyl Compound blocks the acquisition of morphine conditioned place preference (reward), there will be no difference in time spent in each side in rats pre-treated with a Tetrahydropyridyl Compound and the group will not be different from the group of rats that was given carrier + carrier in both compartments. Data will be analyzed as time spent in each compartment (drug combination-paired vs carrierpaired). Generally, the experiment is repeated with a minimum of 3 doses of a Tetrahydropyridyl Compound.<br>
The Drug Self-Administration Test: The apparatus for the drug selfadministration test is a standard commercially available operant conditioning chamber. Before drug trials begin rats are trained to press a lever for a food reward. After stable lever pressing behavior is acquired, rats are tested for acquisition of lever pressing for drug reward. Rats are implanted with chronically indwelling jugular catheters for i.v. administration of compounds and are allowed to recover for 7 days before training begins. Experimental sessions are conducted daily for 5 days in 3 hour sessions. Rats are trained to self-administer a known drug of abuse, such as morphine. Rats are then presented with two levers, an "active" lever and an "inactive" lever. Pressing of the active lever results in drug infusion on a fixed ratio 1 (FR1) schedule (i.e., one lever press gives an infusion) followed by a 20 second time out period (signaled by illumination of a light above the levers). Pressing of the inactive lever results in infusion of excipient. Training continues until the total number of morphine infusions stabilizes to within ± 10% per session. Trained rats are then used to evaluate the effect of Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds pre-treatment on drug self- administration. On test day, rats are pre-treated with a Tetrahydropyridyl Compound or excipient and then are allowed to self- administer drug as usual. If the Tetrahydropyridyl Compound blocks the rewarding effects of morphine, rats pre-treated with the Tetrahydropyridyl<br>
Compound will show a lower rate of responding compared to their previous rate of responding and compared to excipient pre-treated rats. Data is analyzed as the change in number of drug infusions per testing session (number of infusions during test session number of infusions during training session).<br>
5.10 EXAMPLE 10: FUNCTIONAL ASSAY FOR CHARACTERIZING mGluRI ANTAGONISTIC PROPERTIES<br>
Functional assays for the characterization of mGluR 1 antagonistic properties are known in the art. For example, the following procedure can be used.<br>
A CHO-rat mGluRI cell line is generated using cDNA encoding rat mGluRI receptor (M. Masu and S. Nakanishi, Nature 349:760-765 (1991)). The cDNA encoding rat mGluRI receptor can be obtained from, e.g., Prof. S. Nakanishi (Kyoto, Japan).<br>
40.000 CHO-rat mGluRI cells/well are plated into a COSTAR 3409, black, clear bottom, 96 well,- tissue culture treated plate (commercially available from Fisher Scientific of Chicago, IL) and are incubated in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, pH 7.4) supplemented with glutamine, 10% FBS, 1% Pen/Strep, and 500 µg/mL Geneticin for about 12h. The CHO-rat mGluRI cells are then washed and treated with OPTIMEM medium (commercially available from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and incubated for a time period ranging from 1 to 4 hours prior to loading the cells with the dye FLUO-4 (commercially available from Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). After incubation, the cell plates are washed with loading buffer (127 mM NaCl, 5 mM KC1, 2 mM MgCl2, 700 µM, NaH2PO4,2 mM CaCl2, 5 mMNaHCO3,8 mM HEPES, and 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4) and incubated with 3 µM FLUO-4 in 0.1 mL loading buffer for 90 min. The cells are then washed twice with 0.2 mL loading buffer, resuspended in 0.1 mL of loading buffer, and transferred to a FLIPR for measurement of calcium mobilization flux in the presence of glutamate and in the presence or absence of a Tetrahydropyridyl Compound.<br>
To measure calcium mobilization flux, fluoresence is monitored for about 15 s to establish a baseline and DMSO solutions containing various concentrations of a Tetrahydropyridyl Compound ranging from about 50 gM to about 0.8 nM diluted in loading buffer (0.05 mL of a 4X dilution) are added to the cell plate and fluoresence is monitored for about 2 min. 0. 05 mL of a 4X glutamate solution (agonist) is then added -<br>
to each well to provide a final glutamate concentration in each well of 10 tM and fluoresence is monitored for about 1 additional min. The final DMSO concentration in the assay is 1%. In each experiment fluoresence is monitored as a function of time and the data is analyzed using a non- linear regression to determine the IC50 value. In each experiment each data point is determined twice.<br>
5.11 EXAMPLE 11: BINDING OF TETRAHYDROPYRIDYL COMPOUNDS TO VR1<br>
Methods for assaying compounds capable of inhibiting VR1 are known to those skilled in the art, for example, those methods disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,239,267 to Duckworth et al.; U.S. Patent No. 6,406,908 to Mclntyre et al.; or U.S. Patent No. 6,335,180 to Julius et al. The results of these assays will demonstrate that Tetrahydropyridyl Compounds bind to and modulate the activity of VR1.<br>
Binding of Compound A 19(c) to VR1: Assay Protocol<br>
Human VR1 Cloning: Human spinal cord RNA (commercially available from Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used. Reverse transcription was conducted on 1.0 tg total RNA using Thermoscript Reverse Transcriptase (commercially available from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and oligo dT primers as detailed in its product description. Reverse transcription reactions were incubated at 55°C for 1 h, heat-inactivated at 85°C for 5 min, and RNase H-treated at 37°C for 20 min.<br>
Human VR1 cDNA sequence was obtained by comparison of the human genomic sequence, prior to annotation, to the published rat sequence. Intron sequences were removed and flanking exonic sequences were joined to generate the hypothetical human cDNA. Primers flanking the coding region of human VR1 were designed as follows: forward primer, GAAGATCTTCGCTGGTTGCACACTGGGCCACA; and reverse primer, GAAGATCTTCGGGGACAGTGACGGTTGGATGT.<br>
PCR of VR1 was performed on one tenth of the Reverse transcription reaction mixture using Expand Long Template Polymerase and Expand Buffer 2 in a final volume of 50 µL according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN). After denaturation at 94°C for 2 min PCR amplification was performed for 25 cycles at 94°C for 15 sec, 58°C for 30 sec, and 68°C for 3 min followed by a final incubation at 72°C for 7 min to complete the amplification. A PCR<br>
product of ~2.8 kb was gel-isolated using a 1.0% agarose, Tris-Acetate gel containing 1.6 µg/mL of crystal violet and purified with a S.N.A.P. UV-Free Gel Purification Kit (commercially available from Invitrogen). The VR1 PCR product was cloned into the pIND/V5-His-TOPO vector (commercially available from Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA preparations, restriction enzyme digestions, and preliminary DNA sequencing were performed according to standard protocols. Fulllength sequencing confirmed the identity of the human VR1.<br>
Generation of Inducible Cell Lines: Unless noted otherwise, cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies of Rockville, MD. HEK293- EcR cells expressing the ecdysone receptor (commercially available from Invitrogen) were cultured in Growth Medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (commercially available from HYCLONE, Logan, UT), lx penicillin/streptomycin, lx glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 400 µg/mL Zeocin (commercially available from Invitrogen)). The VRl-pIND constructs were transfected into the HEK293- EcR cell line using Fugene transfection reagent (commercially available from Roche Applied Sciences, Basel, Switzerland). After 48 h, cells were transferred to Selection Medium (Growth Medium containing 300 µg/mL G418 (commercially available from Invitrogen)). Approximately 3 weeks later individual Zeocin/G418 resistant colonies were isolated and expanded. To identify functional clones, multiple colonies were plated into 96-well plates and expression was induced for 48 h using Selection Medium supplemented with 5 tM ponasterone A ("PonA") (commercially available from Invitrogen). On the day of assay, cells were loaded with Fluo-4 (a calcium-sensitive dye that is commercially available from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and CAP-mediated calcium influx was measured using a FL1PR as i described below. Functional clones were re-assayed, expanded, and cryopreserved.<br>
pH-Based Assay: Two days prior to performing this assay, cells were seeded on poIy-D-lysine-coated 96-well clear-bottom black plates (commercially available from Becton-Dickinson) at 75,000 cells/well in growth media containing 5 µM PonA (commercially available from Invitrogen) to induce expression. On the day of the assay, the plates were washed with 0.2 mL lx Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (commercially available from Life Technologies) containing 1.6 mM CaCl2 and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 ("wash buffer"), and loaded using 0.1 mL of wash buffer containing Fluo-4 (3 µM final<br>
concentration, commercially available from Molecular Probes). After 1 h, the cells were washed twice with 0.2 mL wash buffer and resuspended in 0. 05 mL 1x Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (commercially available from Life Technologies) containing 3.5 mM CaC12 and 10 mM Citrate, pH 7.4 ("assay buffer"). Plates were then transferred to a FLIPR for assay. Compound A 19(c) was diluted in assay buffer, and 50 mL of the resultant solution were added to the cell plates and the solution monitored for two minutes. The final concentration of Compound A 19(c) ranged from about 50 pM to about 3 u.M. Agonist buffer (wash buffer titrated with 1N HC1 to provide a solution having a pH of 5.5 when mixed 1:1 with assay buffer) (0.1 mL) was then added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 1 additional minute. Data were collected over the entire time course and analyzed using Excel and Graph Pad Prism. Compound A 19(c) when assayed according to this protocol had an IC50 of 735 nM.<br>
Capsaicin-based Assay: Two days prior to performing this assay, cells were seeded in poly-D-lysine-coated 96-well clear-bottom black plates (50, 000 cells/well) in growth media containing 5 µM PonA (commercially available from Invitrogen) to induce expression. On the day of the assay, the plates were washed with 0.2 mL lx Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (commercially available from Life Technologies) containing 1 mM CaCl2 and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and cells were loaded using 0.1 mL of wash buffer containing Fluo-4 (3 µM final). After one hour, the cells were washed twice with 0.2 mL of wash buffer and resuspended in 0.1 mL of wash buffer. The plates were transferred to a FLIPR for assay. 50 µL of Compound A 19(c) diluted with assay buffer were added to the cell plates and incubated for 2 min. The final concentration of Compound A 19(c) ranged from about 50 pM to about 3 µM. Human VR1 was activated by the addition of 50 µL of capsaicin (400 nM), and the plates were incubated for an additional 3 min. Data were collected over the entire time course and analyzed using Excel and GraphPad Prism. Compound A 19(c) when assayed according to this protocol had an IC50 of 19 nM.<br>
The results of the pH-based assay and the capsaicin-based assay demonstrate that Compound A 19(c), an illustrative Tetrahydropyridyl Compound, binds to and modulates the activity of human VR1.<br>
