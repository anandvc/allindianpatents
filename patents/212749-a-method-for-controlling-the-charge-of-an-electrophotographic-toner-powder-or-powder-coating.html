				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention is described in the German priority application No. DE 19957245.3, filed 27.11.1999, which is hereby incorporated by reference as is fully disclosed herein.<br>
The present invention relates to the field of charge control agents in the sense of a component which selectively influences the electrostatic charging properties in a matrix.<br>
In electrophotographic recording processes a "latent charge image" is produced on a photoconductor. This "latent charge image" is developed by application of an electrostatically charged toner, which is then transferred, for example, to paper, textiles, films or plastic and is fixed, for example by means of pressure, radiation, heat or the action of solvents. Typical toners are one- of two-component powder toners (also called one- or two-component developers), and special toners, such as, for example, magnetic toners, liquid toners or polymerization toners, are furthermore also in use. Polymerization toners are to be understood as meaning those toners which are formed, for example, by suspension polymerization (condensation) or emulsion polymerization and lead to improved particle properties of the toner. The term furthermore also means those toners which in principle are produced in nonaqueous dispersions.<br>
A measure of the toner quality is its specific charging q/m (charge per unit weight). In addition to the symbol and level of the electrostatic charging, an important quality criterion is the rapid achievement of the desired level of charge, the constancy of this charge over a relatively long activation period and the insensitivity of the toner toward climatic influences, such as temperature and atmospheric humidity. Both positively and negatively chargeable toners are used in copiers and laser printers, depending on the type of process and apparatus..<br>
To obtain electrophotographic toners or developers with either positive or negative charging, charge control agents are frequently added. Since toner binders often show a marked dependency of the charging on the activation time, the task of a charge control agent is on the one hand to establish a<br><br>
2<br>
symbol and level of the toner charging and on the other hand to counteract the charging drift of the toner binder and ensure constancy of the toner charging. Moreover, it is important in practice for the charge control agent to have an adequate heat stability and a good dispersibility. Typical incorporation temperatures for charge control agents in the toner resins are between 100°C and 200°C using kneaders or extruders. A heat stability of 200°C is accordingly of great advantage. It is also important that the heat stability is guaranteed over a relatively long period of time (about 30 minutes) and in various binder systems.<br>
For a good dispersibility, it is advantageous that the charge control agent has no wax-like properties, no tackiness and a melting or softening point of &gt; 150°C, preferably &gt;200°C. Tackiness frequently leads to problems in metering into the toner formulation, and low melting or softening points can mean that no homogeneous distribution is achieved on dispersing in, since the material closes together in droplet form in the carrier material.<br>
Typical toner binders are polymerization, polyaddition and polycondensation resins, such as styrene, styrene/acrylate, styrene/butadiene, acrylate, polyester and phenol/epoxtde resins, as well as cycloolefin copolymers, individually or in combination, which can also comprise further constituents, for example coloring agents, such as dyestuffs and pigments, waxes or flow auxiliaries, or to which further constituents can also subsequently be added, such as finely divided silicas.<br>
Charge control agents can also be employed to improve the electrostatic charging of powders and coatings, in particular in powder coatings which can be sprayed triboelectrically or electrokinetically, such as are used for surface coating of objects made of, for example, metal, wood, plastic, glass, ceramic, concrete, textile material, paper or rubber. The powder coating or the powder in general acquires its electrostatic charging by one of the following two processes:<br>
In the corona process the powder coating or the powder is passed by a charged corona and charged as a result, and in the triboelectric or electrokinetic process use is made of the principle of frictional electricity. A combination of the two processes is also possible. In the spraying apparatus the powder coating or the powder acquires an electrostatic<br><br>
3<br>
charging which is opposite to the charge of the friction partner, in general a hose or spray tube, for example made of polytetrafluoroethylene.<br>
Epoxy resins, polyester resins containing carboxyl and hydroxyl groups and polyurethane and acrylic resins, together with the customary hardeners, are typically employed as powder coating resins. Combinations of resins are also used. Thus, for example, epoxy resins are frequently employed in combination with polyester resins containing carboxyl and hydroxyl groups.<br>
It has furthermore been found that charge control agents can considerably improve the charging and the charge stability properties of electret materials, in particular electret fibers (DE-A-43 21 289). Typical electret materials are based on polyolefins, halogenated polyolefins, polyacrylates, polyacrylonitriles, polystyrenes or fluorine polymers, such as, for example, polyethylene, polypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene and perfluorinated ethylene and propylene, or on polyesters, polycarbonates, polyamides, polyimides or polyether ketones, on polyarylene sulfides, in particular polyphenylenesulfides, or on polyacetals, cellulose esters or polyalkylene terephthalates, and mixtures thereof. Electret materials, in particular electret fibers, can be employed, for example, for (extra-fine) dust filtration. The electret materials can acquire their charge by corona charging or tribo-charging.<br>
Charge control agents can moreover be used in electrostatic separation operations, in particular in separation operations on polymers. For instance, Y. Higashiyama et al. (J. Electrostatics 30, pp 203 - 212 (1993)) describe how polymers can be separated from one another for recycling purposes by the example of the externally applied charge control agent trimethyl-phenyl-ammonium tetraphenylborate. Without charge control agents low density polyethylene (LDPE) and high density polyethylene (HDPE) charge substantially similarly by frictional electricity. After addition of charge control agents LDPE becomes highly positively charged and HDPE highly negatively charged and they can thus be easily separated. As well as external application of charge control agents, incorporation thereof into the polymer is also possible, for example in order to shift a polymer within the triboelectric voltage series and to obtain a corresponding separating effect. Other  polymers,   such   as,   for  example,   polypropylene   (PP)  and/or<br><br>
4<br>
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and/or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) can also be separated from one another in this manner.<br>
Salt minerals can also be separated if an agent which improves the substrate-specific electrostatic charging (surface conditioning) has been added to them beforehand (A. Singewald et al., Zeitschrift fur Physikal. Chem., Vol. 124, pp 223 - 248 (1981)).<br>
Charge control agents are furthermore employed as electroconductivity providing agents (ECPA) (JP-O5-163 449) in inks for ink-jet printers.<br>
A silica fine powder which has been treated with a specific polysiloxane is known from DE-A1-39 33 166 as a developer for image-producing processes. EP-A1-0 575 805 describes a charge control agent composition which is a solids mixture of a quaternary ammonium salt and an inorganic pigment, such as, for example, calcium sulfate or calcium silicate.<br>
The object of the present invention was to discover active and ecotoxicologically tolerated charge control agents which show, in particular, a high rapid charging. They should furthermore be readily dispersible without decomposition in various toner binders appropriate in practice, such as polyesters, polystyrene/acrylates or polystyrene-butadienes/epoxide resins as well as cycloolefin copolymers. Their action should furthermore be largely independent of the resin/carrier combination, in order to open up a broad application. They should also be readily dispersible without decomposition in the usual powder coating binders and electret materials, such as, for example, polyester (PES), epoxide, PES-epoxy hybrid, polyurethane, acrylic systems and polypropyienes.<br>
In respect of their electrostatic efficiency, the charge control agents should already be active at the lowest possible concentration (1% or less) and should not lose this efficiency in combination with carbon black or other coloring agents. It is known of coloring agents that in some cases they can influence the triboelectric charging of toners for a long time.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that salt-like structured silicates described below have advantageous charge control properties and high<br><br>
5<br>
heat stabilities, the charge control property being lost neither by combination with carbon black nor with other coloring agents. The compounds are moreover readily compatible with the customary toner, powder coating and electret binders and can easily be dispersed. The resin-carrier systems which usually have a negative control can furthermore also be effectively charged positively.<br>
The present invention relates to the use of salt-like structured silicates in which the cation is NH4 , H3O , an alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, earth metal or transition metal ion or a low molecular weight organic cation or a combination thereof and the anion is an island, cyclic, group, chain, ribbon, laminar or matrix silicate or a combination thereof as a charge control agent in electrophotographic toners and developers, in powder coatings and electret materials and in electrostatic separation processes.<br>
According to the customary definition, the structured silicates mentioned<br>
are based on the following empirical formulae:<br>
for island silicates [SiO4]   , for group silicates [Si2O7]6-   , for cyclic silicates<br>
[SiO3]n 2-  , for chain silicates [SiO3]m 2- , for ribbon silicates [Si4O11]m6-  , for<br>
2-	3-<br>
laminar silicates [Si2O5]m    and for matrix silicates [AlaSii-aO2]m  , in<br>
which n = 3, 4, 6 or 8, m is an integer and is &gt; 1 and 0 
Furthermore, in structured silicates some individual Si atoms can be replaced by other atoms, such as, for example, Al, B, P or Be ("aiuminostlicates", "borosilicates" and the like). Naturally occurring or synthetically prepared structured silicates are furthermore distinguished in that they comprise one or more different cations, which are often easily exchangeable, such as, for example, Na , K , Mg and Ca , and, for example, can be replaced by organic ions, whereupon their chemical and physical properties can change. The silicate changed in this way can be, for example, highly hydrophobized and therefore readily processable in non-polar media. In the case of laminar silicates, the individual silicate platelet is enveloped by the organic ions in this manner. These coated molecules can assemble together over their surfaces to give lamellae. If an<br><br>
6<br>
excess of organic ions is used, these can also additionally be embedded between the lamellae.<br>

In the case of a naturally occurring structured silicate, the geographical deposit can have an influence on the chemical and physical properties of the material. Ionic structured silicates, which in nature are often accompanied by other minerals or rocks (for example quartz), can be worked up by mechanical or chemical process steps, for example very finely ground, purified by or separated from other concomitant substances, pH-treated, dehydrated, pressure-treated, heat-treated or treated by oxidation or reduction or with chemical auxiliaries.<br>

The structured silicates containing a low molecular weight organic cation can be prepared by bringing together one or more naturally occurring or synthetic structured silicates with a salt containing the low molecular weight<br><br>
19<br>
organic cation, for example the corresponding chloride, bromide, iodide or methyl-sulfate, in aqueous suspension, expediently at a pH of between 0 and 14, preferably between 2 and 13, expediently at a temperature of 0 to 160°C, preferably 5 to 140"C, expediently under a pressure of 1 to 20 bar, in a molar ratio of organic cation : silicate of 1:100 to 10:1, preferably 1:20 to 3:1. It is advantageous to predisperse the structured silicate in water for between Vz and 48 hours, preferably between 1 and 24 hours, for example at a temperature of 5 to 100°C. It is furthermore advantageous to adjust the salt of the organic cation to a pH of between 5 and 10, before the reaction in an aqueous medium.<br>
A salt-like structured silicate in which the silicate is hectorite, betdellite, illite, muscovite, xantophyllite, margarite, sepiolite, saponite, mica, feldspar, nontronite, montmorillonite, smectite, bentonite, faujasite, zeolite A, X or Y, permutite, sasil or a combination thereof; and the cation is an ion of the formula (x) described above is novel and the present invention likewise relates to it. These novel compounds can be prepared as described above. These compounds can surprisingly show a charge assistant effect in the medium employed, in particular can achieve an assisting anti-offset action (better detachment of the toner from moving parts of the printing machinery which come into contact with the toner, for example photoconductors, deflection rollers).<br>
The salts, used according to the invention, of ionic structured silicates can be matched accurately to the particular resin/toner system. Another technical advantage of these compounds is that they are inert toward the various binder systems and can thus be employed for diverse uses, it being of particular importance that they are not dissolved in the polymer matrix but are present as small, very finely divided solids. They furthermore show high and usually constant charge control properties and good heat stabilities. The structured silicates employed according to the invention are furthermore free-flowing and have a good dispersibility.<br>
Dispersion means the distribution of one substance in another, in the sense of the invention the distribution of a charge control agent in the toner binder, powder coating binder or electret material.<br><br>
20<br>
It is known that crystalline substances in their coarsest form exist as agglomerates. To achieve a homogeneous distribution in the binder, these must be divided into smaller aggregates or ideally into primary particles by the dispersing operation. The charge control agent particles which exist after the dispersing in the binder should be smaller than 1 fim, preferably smaller than 0.5 nm, a narrow particle size distribution being of advantage. Action ranges which are optimum, depending on the substance, are found for the particle size, defined by the dso value. Thus, for example, coarse particles (1 mm) sometimes cannot even be dispersed at all or can be dispersed only with a considerable expenditure of time and energy, while very fine particles in the submicron range present an increased safety risk, such as the possibility of dust explosion.<br>
The particle size and shape is established and modified either by the synthesis and/or aftertreatment. The property required is often only possible by controlled aftertreatment, such as grinding and/or drying. Various grinding techniques are suitable for this. Air jet mills, cutting mills, hammer mills, bead mills and impact mills, for example, are advantageous.<br>
The binder systems mentioned in the present invention are typically hydrophobic materials. High water contents of the charge control agent can either oppose wetting or promote dispersing (flushing). The practicable moisture content is therefore substance-specific.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are characterized by the following chemical/physical properties:<br>
The water content, determined by the Karl-Fischer method, is between 0.001% and 30%, preferably between 0.01 and 25%, and particularly preferably between 0.1 and 15%, it being possible for the water to be adsorbed and/or bonded, and for the content thereof to be adjusted by the action of heat up to 200°C and vacuum down to 10" mmHg or by addition of water or storage under defined atmospheric humidity conditions. Surprisingly, the compounds according to the invention which contain one or more organic cations defined above show no particularly increased H2O content (Karl-Fischer method) after storage at 90% relative atmospheric humidity and 25°C in a climatic test cabinet for 48 hours, while the<br><br>
21<br>
analogous structured silicates with metal cations show significantly higher H2O contents, sometimes several times that before the climatic storage.<br>
The particle size, determined by means of light microscopy evaluation or laser light diffraction as defined by the dso value, is between 0.01 urn and 1000 (im, preferably between 0.1 and 500 ^m, and very particularly preferably between 0.5 and 400 ^m. It is particularly advantageous if a narrow particle size results from the grinding. A range A (dgs-dso) of less than 500 |im, in particular less than 400 ]im, is preferred.<br>
The conductivity of the 5% strength aqueous dispersion is between 0.001 and 2000 mS, preferably between 0.01 and 100 mS. The compounds according to the invention contain both crystalline and amorphous contents. The compounds used according to the invention, when incorporated into a toner binder, show a heat stability up to 200°C (no discoloration) in a thermal gradient test (Kofler test).<br>
In electrokinetic surface potential determination by means of SCD (streaming current detection), the compounds according to the invention with the organic cations defined above surprisingly show significantly lower surface potentials (positive or negative sign) than the corresponding structured silicates with metal cations. On titration of these compounds with corresponding surface-active reagents to the zero point of the surface potential {SCD monitoring of the titration), significantly more surface-active reagent is needed for the compounds with metal cations than for the corresponding structured silicates with organic cations. This indicates a high stability of the salt bond between the structured silicate and organic cation.<br>
The salts, employed according to the invention, of ionic structured silicates can also be combined with further charge control agents with a positive or negative control in order to achieve good charging possibilities in use, the total concentration of the charge control agents expediently being between 0.01 and 50% by weight, preferably between 0.05 and 20% by weight, particularly preferably between 0.1 and 5% by weight, based on the total weight of the electrophotographic toner, developer, powder or powder coating.<br><br>
