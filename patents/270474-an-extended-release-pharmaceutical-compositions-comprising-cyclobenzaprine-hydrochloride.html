The following specification describes the invention.<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to extended release pharmaceutical compositions for enhanced patient compliance comprising a skeletal muscle relaxant and process for producing the compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cyclobehzaprine Hydrochloride, a skeletal muscle relaxant is currently available as immediate release tablets containing 5mg or 10mg of the active. These tablets are recommended to be administered three times a day to achieve relief from muscle spasm. Administration of such tablet three times a day is a major compliance issue especially in<br>
elderly patients. To substantially enhance patient compliance, it is desirable to provide<br><br>
Cyclobehzaprine Hydrochloride in extended release dosage form for once a day administration.<br>
US Patent 7287793, US Patent Application 2008/0124398, US Patent Application 2008/0124399, US Patent Application 2009/0017126 and US Patent Application 2009/0017127 discloses multi-particulate pharmaceutical dosage form of a skeletal muscle relaxant for once a day administration. These compositions provide modified release profile comprising a population of extended release beads, wherein said extended<br>
release jbeads comprise an active-containing core particle comprising a skeletal muscle<br>
i<br>
relaxant selected from the group consisting of Cyclobenzaprine, pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts or derivatives thereof and mixtures thereof; and an extended release coating .comprising a water insoluble polymer membrane surrounding said core. These compositions when analyzed in-vitro in USP apparatus 2 (paddles @ 50 rpm) in 900 ml of 0.1N HGI at 37°C exhibits the following dissolution profile:<br>
•	not more than 40% of the total active is released at 2 hour;<br>
i<br>
•	from about 40-65% of the total active is released at 4 hour;<br>
•	from about 60-85% of the total active is released at 8 hour.<br>
i The dosage form in the prior art are essentially structured to have an active containing<br>
core particle coated with a polymer membrane which is prone to rupture thereby causing<br>
dose dumping.<br>
2<br><br>

If a batch of extended release pellets comprising Cyclobenzaprine HCI releases Cyclobenzaprine HCI too slowly to match with the desired in-vitro dissolution profile, a portion of drug core or extended release pellets comprising lower polymer levels may be added to comply with the desired dissolution profile. If the extended release pellets comprising Cyclobenzaprine HCI releases drug too fast to match the desired in-vitro dissolution profile, it may receive an additional coat or extended release pellets comprising higher polymer levels to achieve the desired in-vitro dissolution profile. Extended release pellets comprising Cyclobenzaprine HCI complying with the desired dissolution profile are filled in capsule or compressed into tablets using the process known in the art to deliver the therapeutic dose of Cyclobenzaprine HCI.<br>

30 g of Cyclobenzaprine HCI was dissolved in 100 g of purified water to obtain drug solution; 75 g of Eudragit L 100 was dissolved in 300 g of acetone and 30 g of water whereas 75 g of Eudragit RSPO was separately dissolved in 160 g of acetone and were added to the drug solution. The resulting solution was sprayed on 150 g of inert core (20 -25 mesh ASTM) in fluid bed bottom spray processor with inlet air temperature of about 20°C to.about 80°C, outlet air temperature of about 20°C to about 60°C, atomization air pressure of about 0.5 - 3.5 bars, fluidization flap open from about 10% to about 90% w/w to obtain extended release pellets. These extended release pellets so obtained were dried in fluid bed bottom spray processor to have moisture content of less than 5%, preferably less than 3% and more preferably less than 2%w/w.<br>
Example 2:<br>
Preparation of Tablets:<br>
7.5 g of Cyclobenzaprine HCI was mixed with 45 g of hydroxypropylmethylcelluiose K4M<br>
i<br>
and 40g of lactose in a planetary mixer to obtain drug mixture. The said drug mixture was<br>
i granulated with the mixture of isopropanol and water in the ratio of 80:20 to obtain wet<br>
mass. The wet mass was dried in fluid bed dryer, milled and sifted through 40 mesh<br>
12<br><br>
ASTM. The sifted granules were compressed into tablets using single rotary compression machine. These compressed tablets were filled into capsule of suitable size to deliver the dose of 15mg and 30mg of Cyclobenzaprine HCI.<br>
Example 3:<br>
30 g of Cyclobenzaprine HCI was dissolved in 340 g of purified water to obtain drug solution. 67.5 g of ethylcellulose (10cps) and 15 g of ethylcellufose (45cps) was added to the drug solution followed by addition of 1360 g of isopropanol. 4 g of diethylphthalate was added to the resulting solution and was sprayed on 123.5 g of inert core (40 - 60 mesh ASTM) in fluid bed bottom spray processor with inlet air temperature of about 20°C to about 80°C, outlet air temperature of about 20°C to about 60°C, atomization air pressure of about 0.5 - 3.5 bars, fluidization flap open from about 10% to about 90% w/w to obtain extended release pellets. These extended release pellets so obtained were dried in fluid bed bottom spray processor to have moisture content of less than 5%, preferably less<br><br>
than 3%<br><br>
and more preferably less than 2%w/w.<br><br>
The extended release pellets so obtained were filled in different sized capsules to deliver the dose of 15mg and 30mg.<br>
Extended release compositions comprising Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride when analyzed in-vitro in USP apparatus 2, in 0.1 N HCI (900ml) exhibits in-vitro dissolution profile of:<br>
•	at least 5% of Cyclobenzaprine HCI released at 1st hour;<br>
•	at' least 15% of Cyclobenzaprine HCI released at 2nd hour;<br>
•	at least 30% of Cyclobenzaprine HCI released at 4th hour;<br>
•	at least 70% of Cyclobenzaprine HCI released at 24lh hour.<br>
