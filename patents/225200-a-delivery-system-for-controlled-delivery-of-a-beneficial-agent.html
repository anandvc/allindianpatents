				<td>OSMOTIC IMPLANT WITH MEMBRANE AND MEMBRANE RETENTION MEANS<br>
[0001] This application claims the priority of U.S. Application Serial No.<br>
60/300,575 filed June 22, 2001, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to osmotically controlled implantable<br>
delivery devices, and more particularly to a delivery system having a membrane<br>
material that controls the delivery rate of a beneficial agent from the delivery<br>
system, in which the membrane material is cast, calendered or extruded then<br>
machined (i.e. stamped, die cut or otherwise cut to shape), and the membrane<br>
material is maintained within the delivery device by a retaining means.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
[0003] Controlled delivery of beneficial agents, such as drugs in the medical<br>
and veterinary fields, has been accomplished by a variety of methods, including<br>
implantable delivery devices such as implantable osmotic delivery devices and<br>
implantable diffusion controlled delivery systems. Osmotic delivery systems are<br>
very reliable in delivering a beneficial agent over an extended period of time<br>
called an administration period. In general, osmotic delivery systems operate by<br>
imbibing fluid from an outside environment and releasing corresponding amounts<br>
of beneficial agent from the delivery system.<br>
[0004] Representative examples of various types of delivery devices are<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos., 3,732,865; 3,987,790; 4,865,845; 5,059,423;<br>
5,112,614; 5,137,727; 5,213,809; 5,234,692; 5,234,693; 5,308.348; 5.413,572;<br>
5,540,665; 5,728,396; and 5,985,305, all of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference. All of the above-cited patents generally include some type of capsule<br>
having at least a portion of a wall that selectively passes water into the interior of<br>
the capsule containing a water-attracting agent (also called an osmotic agent, an<br>
osmopolymer or osmoagent). The absorption of water by the water-attracting<br>
agent within the capsule reservoir creates an osmotic pressure within the capsule<br>
which causes a beneficial agent within the capsule to be delivered. The water<br>
attracting agent may be the beneficial agent being delivered to the patient.<br>
However, in most cases, a separate agent is used specifically for its ability to<br>
draw water into the capsule.<br>
[0005] When a separate osmotic agent is used, the osmotic agent may be<br>
separated from the beneficial agent within the capsule by a movable dividing<br>
member such as a piston. The structure of the capsule is generally rigid such<br>
that as the osmotic agent takes in water and expands, the capsule does not<br>
expand. As the osmotic agent expands, the agent causes the movable dividing<br>
member to move, discharging the beneficial agent through an orifice or exit<br>
passage of the capsule. The beneficial agent is discharged through the exit<br>
passage at the same volumetric rate that water enters the osmotic agent through<br>
the semipermeable wall portion of the capsule.<br>
[0006] The rate at which the beneficial agent is discharged from the delivery<br>
device is determined by many factors, including the type of water-attracting agent<br>
or osmotic agent, the permeabiity of the semipermeabie membrane wall, and the<br>
size and shape of the exit passage. One manner in which the back diffusion of<br>
environmental fluid into the beneficial agent reservoir is controlled is by a flow<br>
moderator in the exit passage of the capsule, with the flow moderator generally<br>
consisting of a tubular passage having a particular cross-sectional area and<br>
length.<br>
[0007] In known osmotic delivery systems, an osmotic tablet, such as salt, is<br>
placed inside the capsule and a membrane plug is placed in an open end of the<br>
capsule to provide a semipermeable barrier. The membrane plug seals the<br>
interior of the capsule from the exterior environment, permitting only certain liquid<br>
molecules from the environment to permeate through the membrane plug and<br>
into the interior of the capsule. The membrane plug is impermeable to items<br>
within the capsule including the osmotic agent and the beneficial agent. The rate<br>
at which the liquid permeates the membrane plug and enters the capsule varies<br>
depending upon the type of membrane material and the size and shape of the<br>
membrane plug. Further, the rate at which the liquid passes through the<br>
membrane plug controls the rate at which the osmotic agent expands to thereby<br>
drive the beneficial agent from the delivery system through the exit passage.<br>
Accordingly, the rate of delivery of the beneficial agent from the osmotic delivery<br>
system is controllable by varying the permeability coefficient of the membrane<br>
plug and/or the size of the membrane plug.<br>
[0008] Some known osmotic delivery systems use injection molded<br>
membrane plugs featuring protruding circumferential sealing ribs that fit into<br>
matching circumferential grooves on the inside of the capsule (U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,113,938, which is incorporated herein by reference). The membrane plug is<br>
retained in the capsule by the sealing ribs, which usually requires the membrane<br>
to be inserted from the membrane end of the reservoir. Injection molded<br>
semipermeable membranes may be difficult to manufacture without internal<br>
stresses; thus performance may vary slightly from plug to plug. An additional<br>
drawback of known osmotic delivery systems is that the membrane plug itself is<br>
required to withstand the pressures created by the expansion of the osmotic<br>
engine. Other known osmotic delivery systems use membrane plugs with<br>
protruding circumferential sealing ribs but no matching circumferential grooves<br>
inside of the capsule. Still other known osmotic delivery systems use membrane<br>
plugs with no circumferential sealing ribs that fit into the capsule by friction fit.<br>
Still other known osmotic delivery systems use membrane plugs without any<br>
circumferential sealing ribs but with holes in the capsule into which the<br>
membrane plug can expand (WO 99/33446, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference). Known delivery systems preclude the use of a capsule having a pre-<br>
installed retaining feature covering or partially covering the membrane plug end<br>
of the capsule for keeping the membrane plug sealed in position. Consequently,<br>
in these systems, if a retaining feature other than the capsule grooves and<br>
matching ribs of the membrane plug is to be used, it must be assembled to the<br>
main capsule body, after the membrane plug is inserted. This requirement tends<br>
to increase the cost and complexity of a high pressure osmotic delivery system.<br>
[0009] Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a delivery device that provides<br>
improved consistency and performance of the membrane material and also<br>
provides a feature for retaining the membrane material within the capsule under<br>
high pressure.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00010] In accordance with the present invention, a delivery system for<br>
controlled delivery of a beneficial agent includes an implantable capsule having a<br>
beneficial agent delivery end and a fluid uptake end. The capsule also includes a<br>
beneficial agent reservoir positioned within the capsule for housing the beneficial<br>
agent. A membrane material is received in the fluid uptake end of the capsule<br>
and provides a fluid permeable barrier between an interior and an exterior of the<br>
capsule. A membrane material retaining means is positioned at the fluid uptake<br>
end of the capsule and includes at least one opening for allowing passage of<br>
fluid. The membrane material retaining means also prevents the membrane<br>
material from being ejected out of the fluid uptake end of the capsule.<br>
[00011] In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a delivery<br>
system for controlled delivery of a beneficial agent in which the membrane<br>
material retaining means includes a retention flange positioned along a proximal<br>
end of the fluid uptake end of the capsule.<br>
[00012] In accordance with another aspect, the present invention pertains<br>
to a delivery system, in which the membrane material retaining means includes a<br>
screen, a grate, a perforated disk, a frit, or a sintered powdered metal structure<br>
including porous capillaries. If the membrane material retaining means includes<br>
porous capillaries, the capillaries can have diameters between about 0.5 and<br>
about 10 microns. The membrane material retaining means can be flat or have a<br>
rounded or contoured surface on at least one surface thereof.<br>
[00013] In a further aspect, the present invention pertains to a delivery<br>
system for controlled delivery of a beneficial agent in which the membrane<br>
material has a generally smooth, cylindrical or disc shape.<br>
[00014] In yet another aspect, the present invention is directed to a delivery<br>
system for controlled delivery of a beneficial agent, in which the membrane<br>
material is extruded, cast, or calendered and then machined (i.e. die-cut,<br>
stamped, or otherwise cut into shape).<br>
[00015] In another aspect, the present invention pertains to a delivery<br>
system for controlled delivery of a beneficial agent, in which the capsule includes<br>
one or a plurality of inward protruding ridges and in which the inward protruding<br>
ridges securely grip an outer surface of the membrane material. Note that the<br>
word ridges as used herein can indicate one or more ridges. Additionally, the<br>
inwardly protruding ridge or plurality of inwardly protruding ridges are shaped to<br>
accommodate insertion of the membrane material from the beneficial agent<br>
delivery end of the capsule while inhibiting withdrawal of the membrane material<br>
from the beneficial agent delivery end of the capsule.<br>
[00016] In a further aspect, the present invention is directed to a delivery<br>
system for controlled delivery of a beneficial agent, in which an osmotic engine is<br>
positioned between the beneficial agent delivery end and the membrane<br>
material.<br>
[00017] In a further aspect, the present invention pertains to a delivery<br>
system for controlled delivery of a beneficial agent and includes a piston<br>
positioned between the beneficial delivery end and the osmotic engine for<br>
transmitting a pushing force created by the osmotic engine to the beneficial<br>
agent.<br>
[00018] According to a further aspect of the present invention, a method of<br>
forming a beneficial agent delivery device includes the steps of providing an<br>
implantable capsule having an open delivery end, an open fluid uptake end and a<br>
membrane material retaining means. A membrane material is inserted into the<br>
capsule from the open agent delivery end and positioned such that an end<br>
surface thereof is in contact with an inside surface of the membrane material<br>
retaining means. The osmotic agent is inserted into the capsule, followed by a<br>
movable dividing means or piston. The capsule is then filled with a beneficial<br>
agent, and the agent delivery end is closed while providing a controlled outlet for<br>
the beneficial agent to escape when sufficient pressure is applied to the<br>
beneficial agent.<br>
[00019] In a further aspect, the present invention pertains to an osmotic<br>
system for controlled delivery of a beneficial agent including an implantable<br>
capsule having a beneficial agent delivery end and a fluid uptake end. The<br>
capsule includes a beneficial agent reservoir positioned adjacent the beneficial<br>
agent delivery end for housing the beneficial agent. A piston is positioned<br>
between the beneficial agent reservoir and the fluid uptake end. An osmotic<br>
engine is positioned between the piston and the fluid uptake end. The osmotic<br>
engine is expandable at a controlled rate and when expanding, applies a pushing<br>
force against the piston which applies a pushing force against the beneficial<br>
agent, such that, the beneficial agent is released through the beneficial agent<br>
delivery end at a predetermined rate. A membrane material is received in the<br>
fluid uptake end and provides a fluid permeable barrier between an interior and<br>
an exterior of the capsule. A membrane material retaining means is positioned at<br>
the fluid uptake end, with the membrane material retaining means including at<br>
least one opening for allowing passage of fluid. The membrane material<br>
retaining means also prevents the membrane material from being ejected out of<br>
the fluid uptake end of the capsule by osmotic pressure.<br>
[00020] The present invention provides the advantage of consistent and<br>
predictable delivery rate of a beneficial agent by allowing the use of extruded,<br>
cast, or calendered and then machined (i.e. die cut, stamped or otherwise cut to<br>
shape) membrane materials, whose consistency is more homogeneous when<br>
produced on a highly controlled machining or extrusion line as compared to the<br>
part-to-part consistency of injection molded membrane plugs.<br>
[00021] The present invention also provides the advantage of allowing the<br>
sealing of a cast, calendered, or extruded membrane material that has been<br>
machined (i.e. die cut stamped or otherwise cut to shape) in place in an<br>
implantable osmotic delivery device while reducing the expulsion of the<br>
membrane from the implantable device under high pressure conditions (greater<br>
than 1,000 psi), such as those encountered in the case of a blocked exit<br>
passage.<br>
[00022] In addition, the present invention allows for the membrane retaining<br>
means to be formed integrally with the implantable capsule or attached thereto<br>
during assembly of the delivery device.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[00024] The present invention relates to an osmotic delivery system 10<br>
having a membrane material 30 for controlling a delivery rate of a beneficial<br>
agent from the osmotic delivery system.<br>
[00025] Definitions<br>
[00026] The term “active agent" or “beneficial agent" intends the active<br>
agent(s) optionally in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and<br>
optionally additional ingredients such as antioxidants, stabilizing agents,<br>
permeation enhancers, etc.<br>
[00027] The term “impermeable' intends that the material is sufficiently<br>
impermeable to environmental fluids as well as ingredients contained within the<br>
dispensing device such that the migration of such materials into or out of the<br>
device through the impermeable device is so low as to have substantially no<br>
adverse impact on the function of the device during the delivery period.<br>
[00028] The term "semipermeable" intends that the material is permeable to<br>
external fluids but substantially impermeable to other ingredients contained within<br>
the dispensing device and the environment of use.<br>
[00029] The term “membrane material" intends that the semipermeable<br>
membrane is in the form of a sheet or plug. The membrane material preferably<br>
has a diameter between about 0.040" and about 0.250” and preferably has a<br>
length or thickness between about 0.010” and about 0.350". The diameter and<br>
thickness of the membrane material are determined by such considerations as<br>
desired rate of delivery of the beneficial agent, desired duration of delivery of the<br>
beneficial agent, the device size, the material used for the semipermeable<br>
membrane, the retention means for the semipermeable membrane, the beneficial<br>
agent formulation, and/or the osmotic pressure generated during operation of the<br>
device.<br>
[00030] FIG. 1 shows that the osmotic delivery system 10 generally<br>
includes a first chamber 50 which contains a beneficial agent, a piston 54 and a<br>
second chamber 40 containing an osmotic agent, all of which are enclosed within<br>
-an elongated substantially cylindrical capsule 12.<br>
[00031] The capsule 12 must be sufficiently strong to ensure that it will not<br>
leak, crack, break or distort so as to expel its active agent contents under<br>
stresses it would be subjected to during use. In particular, it should be designed<br>
to withstand the maximum osmotic pressure that could be generated by the<br>
osmotic agent in chamber 40. Capsule 12 must also be chemically inert,<br>
biocompatible, and impermeable, that is, it must be non-reactive with the active<br>
agent formulation as well as the body and must isolate the beneficial agent<br>
during the delivery process. Suitable materials generally comprise a non-<br>
reactive polymer or a biocompatible metal or alloy. The polymers include<br>
acrylonitrile polymers such as acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene terpolymer, and the<br>
like; halogenated polymers such as polytetrafluorethylene, polychoiortrifluoro-<br>
ethylene, copolymer tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropytene; polyimide;<br>
polysulfone; polycarbonate; polyethylene; polypropylene; polyvinylchloride-acrylic<br>
copolymer; polycarbonate-acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene; polystyrene; polyether<br>
ether ketone (PEEK); liquid crystal polymer (LCP); and the like. The water vapor<br>
transmission rate through compositions useful for forming the reservoir are<br>
reported in J. Pharm. Sci., Vol 29, pp. 1634-37 (1970); Ind. Eng. Chem., Vol. 45,<br>
pp. 2296-2306 (1963); Materials Engineering, Vol 5, pp. 38-45 (1972); Ann. Book<br>
of ASTM Stds., Vol 8.02, pp 208-211 and pp. 584-587 (1984); and Ind. and Eng.<br>
Chem., Vol 49, pp. 1933-1936 (1957). Metallic materials useful in the invention<br>
include stainless steel, titanium, platinum, tantalum, gold and their alloys as well<br>
as gold-plated ferrous alloys, platinum-plated ferrous alloys, cobalt-chromium<br>
alloys and titanium nitride coated stainless steel. A reservoir made from titanium<br>
or a titanium alloy having greater than 60%, often greater than 85% titanium is<br>
particularly preferred.<br>
[00032] The capsule 12 has a delivery end 70 with an exit passage 72 in it<br>
at the beneficial agent delivery end 70 and an opening 62 at the fluid uptake end<br>
of the capsule 12. The exit passage 72 may take any convenient form such as<br>
straight circular, spiral,etc. The exit passage 72 is made of an inert and<br>
biocompatible material selected from but not limited to metals including but not<br>
limited to titaniium, stainless steel, platinum and their alloys and cobalt-chromium<br>
alloys and the like, and polymers including but not limited to polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene, polycarbonate and polymethyl-methacrylate and the like.<br>
[00033] The fluid uptake end 60 of the capsule 12 is closed by the<br>
membrane material 30. In FIG. 2 the membrane material is in the form of a plug.<br>
Materials from which the membrane materials are made are those that are<br>
semipermeable and that can conform to the shape of the capsule 12 upon<br>
wetting and sealing to the rigid surface of the capsule. The semipermeable<br>
membrane material expands as it hydrates when placed in a fluid environment so<br>
that a seal is generated between the mating surfaces of the membrane material<br>
and the capsule. The diameter of the membrane material is such that it will<br>
sealingly fit inside the reservoir prior to hydration as a result of sealing contact at<br>
one or more circumferential or axial zones and will expand in place upon wetting<br>
to form an even tighter seal with the capsule. The membrane material must be<br>
able to imbibe between about 0.1% and 200% by weight of water. The polymeric<br>
materials from which the semipermeable membrane material may be made vary<br>
based on the pumping rates and the device configuration requirements and<br>
include but are not limited to plasticized ceflulosic materials, enhanced<br>
polymethylmethacrylate such as hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA) and<br>
elastomeric materials such as polyurethanes and polyamides, polyether-<br>
polyamide copolymers, thermoplastic copolyesters and the like.<br>
[00034] The membrane material 30 closes the fluid uptake end 60 from the<br>
second chamber 40 containing the osmotic agent.<br>
[00035] The osmotic agent or osmotic engine may include, for example, a<br>
non-volatile water soluble osmoagent, an osmopolymer which swells on contact<br>
with water, or a mixture of the two. Osmotic agents, such as NaCI with<br>
appropriate tabletting agents (lubricants and binders) and viscosity modifying<br>
agents, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose or sodium polyacrylate are<br>
preferred water-swellable agents. Other osmotic agents useful as the water-<br>
swellable agent include osmopolymers and osmoagents and are described, for<br>
example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5.413,572, which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The water-swellable agent formulation can be a slurry, a tablet, a molded or<br>
extruded material or other form known in the art. A liquid or gel additive or filler<br>
may be added to chamber 40 to exclude air from spaces around the osmotic<br>
engine.<br>
[00036] Fluid passes through the membrane material 30 from an exterior of<br>
the capsule 12 and into the second chamber 40, while the membrane material 30<br>
prevents the compositions within the capsule from passing out of the capsule.<br>
[00037] As seen in FIG. 1, the first chamber 50, containing the beneficial<br>
agent, is separated from the second chamber 40, containing the osmotic agent,<br>
by a separating member, such as a movable piston 54. The movable piston 54 is<br>
a substantially cylindrical member configured to fit within the interior diameter of<br>
the capsule 12 in a sealing manner and to slide along a longitudinal axis inside<br>
the capsule. The piston 54 provides an impermeable barrier between the<br>
beneficial agent contained in the first chamber 50 and the osmotic agent<br>
contained in the second chamber 40. The materials from which the piston are<br>
made are preferably elastomeric materials that are impermeable and include but<br>
are not limited to polypropylene, rubbers such as EPDM, silicone rubber, butyl<br>
rubber, and the like, perfluoro-elastomers such as Kalrez® and Chemrez®,<br>
fluorocarbons such as Viton®, and thermoplastic elastomers such as plasticized<br>
polyvinylchloride, polyurethanes, Santoprene®, C-Flex® TPE, a styrene-<br>
ethylene-butylene-styrene copolymer (Consolidated Polymer Technologies Inc.),<br>
and the like.<br>
[00038] As seen in FIGS. 2 and 3, the capsule 12 includes a smooth,<br>
generally cylindrical shape having a hollow interior. The capsule 12 is provided<br>
with a membrane retaining means having a retention flange 20 positioned along<br>
an outer periphery of the fluid uptake end 60 and includes an opening 62 to allow<br>
for the passage of fluid into the capsule. The membrane retaining flange 20 can<br>
have a flat rounded, or contoured surface on the exterior side. The retention<br>
flange 20 of the membrane retaining means should be long enough to retain the<br>
membrane material under full osmotic pressure, yet the opening 62 needs to<br>
maximize the exposed surface of the membrane material. The capsule 12 also<br>
includes one or a plurality of inwardly protruding annular ribs or ridges 14 which<br>
provide fluid sealing between the interior surface of the capsule 12 and the outer<br>
surface of the membrane material 30 and prevent fluid from leaking around the<br>
membrane material. The ribs or ridges 14 are also formed to grippingly engage<br>
the outer surface of the membrane material 30 and prevent the membrane<br>
material 30 from moving in a lateral direction towards the beneficial agent<br>
delivery end 70. In this respect, the diameter of the membrane material 30 is<br>
substantially equal to the inner diameter of the capsule 12. Moreover, the<br>
diameter of the membrane material 30 is larger than the inner diameter of the<br>
ribs or ridges 14. The capsule may be provided with between about 1 to 8 ribs or<br>
ridges, but is preferably provided with about 1 to 4 ribs or ridges. Any reference<br>
to the word ribs is intended to include a single rib as well as a plurality of ribs.<br>
Any reference to the word ridge or ridges is intended to be a reference to the<br>
word rib or ribs, and vice versa.<br>
[00039] Although FIG. 2 depicts the retention flange 20 as being formed<br>
integrally with the capsule 12, it will be understood that the retention flange may<br>
alternatively be a separate member attached to the capsule. For example, the<br>
membrane retaining means flange 20 may be welded, pressed, screwed or the<br>
like to the end of the capsule 12.<br>
[00040] The opening 62 is sufficiently small that the membrane material 30<br>
cannot distort and pass through the opening under high operating pressures,<br>
such as about 5000 psi.<br>
[00041] The membrane material 30, as seen in FIGS. 4 and 5 includes a<br>
substantially smooth cylindrical body. As seen in FIGS. 4 and 5, the membrane<br>
material 30 is devoid of any protrusions, ribs, or abscesses. Thus, the<br>
membrane material 30 is simpler to manufacture than known membrane plugs.<br>
The membrane material 30 may be produced by casting, calendering, or<br>
extrusion, then machining (i.e. die-cutting, stamping or otherwise cutting to<br>
shape), thereby yielding a membrane of superior consistency compared with<br>
injection molded membrane materials of known systems. The membrane<br>
material 30 may be made of any suitable biocompatible membrane material.<br>
[00042] As seen in FIG. 10, the inwardly protruding ridges 14 include a<br>
sloped wall 16 and a vertical wall 18. The ridges 14 extend a distance from the<br>
inner wall 22 of the capsule 12, about the entire circumference of the inner wall.<br>
The height h of vertical wall 18 preferably is about 0.002" to about 0.020'. In<br>
addition, the sloped wall 16 is provided at an angle a from the inner wall 22. The<br>
angle of the sloped wall 16 can be chosen to be any suitable angle that allows for<br>
the membrane material 30 to be easily inserted over the ridges 14. The vertical<br>
wall 18 of the ridges 14 prevents the membrane material 30 from moving laterally<br>
towards the beneficial agent delivery end. In use the ridges 14 and the<br>
membrane retaining means flange 20 act together to restrict any lateral<br>
movement of the membrane material 30.<br>
[00043] Although FIG. 10 does not show any clearance between the<br>
membrane material 30 and the ridges 14, it is within the scope of the present<br>
invention that gaps may exist there between and between the inner wall 22 of the<br>
capsule 12 and the membrane material 30.<br>
[00044] FIGS. 6 and 7 show a portion of a second preferred embodiment of<br>
an osmotic delivery system 150. In this embodiment, the membrane material<br>
retaining means comprises a perforated disk 120. The perforated disk 120<br>
includes a plurality of openings 122 which allow fluid to pass therethrough and<br>
subsequently through the membrane material 30 and into the interior of the<br>
capsule. As can also be seen in FIG. 6, the perforated disk 120 acts together<br>
with the ridges 114 to restrict the lateral movement of the membrane material 30<br>
within the capsule 112. Thus, ridges 114 function in the same manner as the<br>
ridges 14 of the first embodiment. In this embodiment, the perforated disk 120 is<br>
affixed by welding, pressing, screwing or the tike, to the fluid uptake end of the<br>
capsule 112.<br>
[00045] FIGS. 8 and 9 illustrate a portion of a third preferred embodiment of<br>
an osmotic delivery device 250. In this embodiment, a screen or a grate 220<br>
having a plurality of openings 222 is affixed to the fluid uptake end 60 (see Fig. 2)<br>
of the capsule 212. As in the previous embodiment, the screen or grate 220 may<br>
be welded, pressed, screwed, or otherwise affixed to the fluid uptake end 60 (see<br>
Fig. 2) of the capsule 212. The screen or grate 220 may be affixed to the<br>
capsule 212 either before or after insertion of the membrane material 230.<br>
Although a screen or grate 220 has been illustrated, other structures that allow<br>
passage of water and prevent the membrane material 230 from being expelled<br>
may also be used.<br>
[00046] As also seen in FIG. 8, the capsule 212 is provided with a plurality<br>
of inward protruding, circumferentially extending, sealing ribs or ridges 214<br>
having a smaller inner diameter than the inner diameter of the capsule 212. The<br>
ridges 214 include sloped walls 16 and vertical walls 18 (see Fig. 10). The<br>
sloped walls 16 allow for the easy insertion of the membrane material 230 into<br>
the capsule 212 while the vertical walls 18 prevent the transverse movement of<br>
the membrane material 30 in the direction of the beneficial agent delivery end 70<br>
(see Fig. 1).<br>
[00047] FIG. 11 shows a portion of a fourth preferred embodiment of an<br>
osmotic delivery system 350. In this embodiment, the fluid uptake end 160<br>
comprises the membrane material retaining means 120 and a frit or sintered<br>
powdered metal structure 320. The frit 320 includes a plurality of capillaries<br>
having diameters between about 0.5 and 10 microns which allow fluid to pass<br>
therethrough and subsequently through the membrane material 30 into the<br>
interior of the capsule. In FIG. 11 the membrane material 30 is of sufficient<br>
length to include at least one rib or ridge 314. As can also be seen in FIG. 11,<br>
the frit 320 acts together with the ridges 314 to restrict the lateral movement of<br>
the membrane material 30 within the capsule 112. Thus, ridges 314 function in<br>
the same manner as the ridges 14 of the first embodiment In this embodiment,<br>
the frit 320 is affixed, by welding, pressing, screwing or the like, to the membrane<br>
material retaining means 120 of the capsule 112.<br>
[00048] FIG. 12 shows a portion of a fifth preferred embodiment of an<br>
osmotic delivery system 350. The embodiment is similar to the embodiment<br>
shown in FIG. 11 except that the membrane material 30 is located between the<br>
first rib or ridge 314 and the membrane material retaining means 120. Movement<br>
of the membrane material 30 is restricted within the capsule 112 by both the<br>
ridge 114 and the membrane material retaining means 120.<br>
[00049] The membrane material can be prepared by casting, calendering,<br>
or extrusion. Casting comprises pouring the membrane material onto a flat<br>
surface. Calendering comprises forming a sheet of membrane material by<br>
pressing or rolling. Extrusion comprises pushing the membrane material through<br>
a die form to form a rod shape. Once the sheet or rod is prepared the plug or<br>
disc shape is prepared by cutting or machining the sheet or rod. The cutting or<br>
machining can be accomplished for example by die-cutting or stamping the<br>
shape.<br>
[00050] The devices of the invention are useful to deliver a wide variety of<br>
active agents. These agents include but are not limited to pharmacologically<br>
active peptides and proteins, genes and gene products, other gene therapy<br>
agents, and other small molecules. The polypeptides may include but are not<br>
limited to growth hormone, somatotropin analogues, somatomedin-C,<br>
Gonadotropic releasing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing<br>
hormone, LHRH, LHRH analogues such as leuprolide, nafarelin and goserelin,<br>
LHRH agonists and antoagonists, growth hormone releasing factor, calcitonin,<br>
colchicine, gonadotropins such a chorionic gonadotropin, oxytocin, octreotide,<br>
somatotropin plus an amino acid, vasopressin, adrenocorticotriphic hormone,<br>
epidermal growth factor, prolactin, somatostatin, somatotropin plus a protein,<br>
cosyntropin, typressin, polypeptides such as thyrotropin releasing hormone,<br>
thyroid stimulation hormone, secretin, pancreozymin, enkephalin, glucagon,<br>
endocrine agents secreted internally and distributed by way of the bloodstream,<br>
and the like. Further agents that may be delivered include a1 antitrypsin, factor<br>
VIII, factor IX and other coagulation factors, insulin and other peptide hormones,<br>
adrenal cortical stimulating hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone and other<br>
pituitary hormones, interferon (for example, alpha, beta, gamma, and omega),<br>
erythropoietin, growth factors such as GCSF, GMCSF, insulin-like growth factor<br>
1, tissue plasminogen activator, CD4, dDAVP, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist,<br>
tumor necrosis factor, pancreatic enzymes, lactase, cytokines, interieukin-1<br>
receptor antagonist, interleukin-2, tumor necrosis factor receptor, tumor<br>
suppresser proteins, cytotoxic proteins, and recombinant antibodies and antibody<br>
fragments, and the like.<br>
[00051] The above agents are useful for the treatment of a variety of<br>
conditions including but not limited to hemophilia and other blood disorders,<br>
growth disorders, diabetes, leukemia, hepatitis, renal failure, HIV infection,<br>
hereditary diseases such as cerbrosidase deficiency and adenosine deaminase<br>
deficiency, hypertension, septic shock, autoimmune diseases such as multiple<br>
sclerosis, Graves disease, systemic lupus erythematosus and theumatoid<br>
arthritis, shock and wasting disorder, cystic fibrosis, lactose intolerance, Crohn's<br>
disease, inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal and other cancers.<br>
[00052] The active or beneficial agents may be anhydrous or aqueous<br>
solutions, suspensions or complexes with pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles<br>
or carriers such that a flowable formulation is produced that may be stored for<br>
long periods on the shelf or under refrigeration, as well as stored in an implanted<br>
delivery system. The formulations may include pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers and additional inert ingredients. The active agents may be in various<br>
forms, such as uncharged molecules, components of molecular complexes or<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salts. Also, simple derivatives of the agents (such<br>
as prodrugs, ethers, esters, amides, etc.) which are easily hydrolyzed by body<br>
pH, enzymes, etc. can be employed.<br>
[00053] It is to be understood that more than one active agent may be<br>
incorporated into the active agent formulation in a device of this invention and<br>
that the use of the term "agent" in no way excludes the use of two or more such<br>
agents. The dispensing devices of the invention find use, for example, in<br>
humans or other animals. The environment of use is a fluid environment and can<br>
comprise any subcutaneous position or body cavity, such as the peritoneum or<br>
uterus. Ultimate delivery may be systemic or targeted and may or may not be<br>
systemic delivery of the beneficial agent A single dispensing device or several<br>
dispensing devices can be administered to a subject during a therapeutic<br>
program. The devices are designed to remain implanted during a predetermined<br>
administration period. If the devices are not removed following the<br>
administration, they may be designed to withstand the maximum osmotic<br>
pressure of the water-swellable agent or they may be designed with a bypass to<br>
release the pressure generated within the device.<br>
[00054] The devices of the present invention are preferably rendered sterile<br>
prior to use, especially when such use is implantation. This may be<br>
accomplished by separately sterilizing each component, e.g., by gamma<br>
radiation, steam sterilization or sterile filtration, then aseptically assembling the<br>
final system. Alternatively, the devices may be assembled, then terminally<br>
sterilized using any appropriate method.<br>
[00055] The assembly of the osmotic delivery device will be described<br>
below with reference to the embodiment of FIGS. 1-3, however, it should be<br>
understood that the embodiments of FIGS. 6-9 and 11 and 12 may be assembled<br>
in a similar manner.<br>
[00056] According to a preferred embodiment, the capsule is assembled<br>
with the membrane retaining means flange 20 fixed to the capsule. The<br>
membrane material 30 is preferably inserted from the beneficial agent delivery<br>
end 70 of the capsule 12. The membrane material 30 is then slid through the<br>
length of the capsule 12, towards the direction of the fluid uptake end of the<br>
capsule until it abuts a membrane material retaining means 20. The membrane<br>
material 30 may be inserted by, for example, compressed gas. In addition, as<br>
seen in FIG. 1, after the membrane material 30 has been fully inserted, the<br>
osmotic engine or osmotic agent may then be inserted into chamber 40 from the<br>
beneficial agent delivery end 70. Once the osmotic engine has been inserted,<br>
the piston 54 may then be inserted into the capsule. After insertion of the piston<br>
54, the beneficial agent can be inserted into the beneficial agent reservoir 50.<br>
Finally, the exit passageway or diffusion moderator is inserted into the beneficial<br>
agent delivery end 70.<br>
[00057] Alternatively, the membrane retaining means 20 can be attached to<br>
the capsule after one or more of the membrane material 30, osmotic engine 42,<br>
piston 54, or beneficial agent has been inserted into the capsule 12.<br>
[00058] If a screen, grate, or frit is present in opening 62, such screen,<br>
grate, or frit can be attached to capsule 12 before or after the membrane material<br>
30 is placed in capsule 12.<br>
[00059] Once all of the components of the osmotic delivery system 10 have<br>
been assembled, the beneficial agent delivery end 70 can be closed in a known<br>
manner, such as providing a cap with a delivery passage 72. For example, the<br>
beneficial agent delivery end may be closed in the manner disclosed in<br>
commonly owned and assigned U.S. Patent No. 5,728,396, issued to Peery et<br>
al., which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[00060] Thus, the present invention provides a more consistent and<br>
predictable delivery rate of a beneficial agent by allowing for the use of cast,<br>
calendered or extruded membrane materials that are machined (i.e. die-cut,<br>
stamped or otherwise cut to shape), in which the permeability of the membrane<br>
materials are more homogeneous because they are produced on a highly<br>
controlled extrusion or machining line as compared to the part-to-part<br>
homogeneity of injection molded plugs.<br>
[00061] According to other embodiments of the present invention, the<br>
delivery system may take different forms. For example, the piston may be<br>
replaced with a flexible member such as a diaphragm, partition, pad, flat sheet,<br>
spheroid, or rigid metal alloy, and may be made of any number of other<br>
materials. Furthermore, the osmotic device may function without the piston,<br>
having simply an interface between the osmotic agent/fluid additive and the<br>
beneficial agent or having the osmotic agent incorporated in the beneficial agent.<br>
In addition, the capsule of the present invention may be provided with a more<br>
rounded shape along its edges in order to make insertion of the capsule within<br>
the patient simpler.<br>
[00062] The above-described exemplary embodiments are intended to be<br>
illustrative in all respects, rather than restrictive, of the present invention. Thus<br>
the present invention is capable of many variations and detailed implementation<br>
that can be derived from the description contained herein by a person skilled in<br>
the art. All such variations and modifications are considered to be within the<br>
