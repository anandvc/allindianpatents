				<td>ACYLOXYPYRROLIDINE DERIVATIVES, PREPARATION THEREOF AND APPLICATION THEREOF IN THERAPEUTICS<br>
The present invention relates to<br>
acyloxypyrrolidine derivatives, to the preparation thereof and to the application thereof in therapeutics.<br>
The compounds according to the present<br>
invention exhibit an affinity and a selectivity for ViD receptors, or for both-Vlb and Via receptors, for arginine-vasopressin <avp></avp>
AVP is a hormone known for its antidiuretic effect and its effect in the regulation of arterial pressure. It stimulates several types of receptor: Vi (Via, Vib) and V2. These receptors are located in particular in the liver, the vessels (coronary, renal, cerebral), the platelets, the kidney, the uterus, the adrenal glands, the pancreas, the central nervous system and the pituitary gland. AVP thus exerts cardiovascular, hepatic, pancreatic, antidiuretic and platelet-aggregating effects and effects on the central and peripheral nervous system and on the uterine sphere.<br>
The location of the various receptors is described in: .S. JARD et al., Vasopressin and oxytocin receptors: an overview, in Progress in Endocrinology. H. IMURA and K. SHIZURNE ed., Experta Medica, Amsterdam, 1988, 1183-1188, and also in the following<br><br>
2<br>
articles: J. Lab. Clin. Med., 1989, 114 (6), 617-632 and Pharmacol. Rev., 1991, 43 (1), 73-108.<br>
More particularly, Via receptors for AVP are located in, many peripheral organs and in the brain. They have been cloned, in particular in rats and humans, and they regulate most of the known effects of AVP: platelet aggregation; uterine contractions; vessel contractions; secretion of aldosterone, of cortisol, of CRF (for corticotropin-releasing factor) and of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH); hepatic glycogenolysis, cell proliferation and the main central effects of AVP (hypothermia, memory, etc.) .<br>
Vib receptors were initially identified in the adenohypophysis of various animal species (rats, pigs, bovines, sheep, etc), including in humans (S. JARD et al., Mol. Pharmacol., 1986, 30, 171-177; Y. ARSENIJEVIC et al., J. Endocrinol., 1994, 141, 383-391; J. SCHWARTZ et al., Endocrinology, 1991, 129_ (2), 1107-1109; Y. DE KEYSER et al., FEBS Letters, 1994, 356, 215-220), where they stimulate the release of adrenocorticotrophic hormone by AVP and potentiate the effects of CRF on the release of ACTH (G.E. GILLIES et al., Nature, 1982, 299, 355). In the hypothalamus, Vib receptors also  induce direct release of CRF (Neuroendocrinology, 1994, 60, 503-508) and are, in these various respects, involved in situations of stress.<br><br>
3<br>
These Vlb receptors have been cloned in rats, humans and mice (Y. DE KEYSER, FEBS, Letters, 1994, 356, 215-220; T. SUGIMOTO et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1994, 269 (43), 27088-27092; M. SAITO et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1995, 212 (3), 751-757; S.J. LOLAIT et al. , Neurobiology, 1996, S2_t 6783-6787; M.A. VENTURA et al., Journal of Molecular Endocrinology, 1999, 22, 251-260) and various studies {in situ hybridization, PCR (polymerase chain reaction), etc.) reveal a ubiquitous location for these receptors in various central tissues, (brain, hypothalamus and adenohypophysis, in particular) and peripheral tissues (kidney, pancreas, adrenals, heart, lungs, intestine, stomach, liver, mesentery, bladder, thymus, spleen, uterus, retina, thyroid, etc.) and in some tumours (hypophyseal, pulmonary, etc.), suggesting a widespread biological and/or pathological role to these receptors and a potential involvement in various diseases.<br>
By way of examples, in rats, studies have shown that AVP, via Vib receptors, regulates the endocrine pancreas by stimulating secretion of insulin and of glucagon (B. LEE et al., Am. J. Physiol. 269 (Endocrinal. Metab. 32): E1095-E1100, 1995) or the production of .catecholamines in the adrenal medulla, which is the site of local synthesis of AVP (E. GRAZZINI et al., Endocrinology, 1996, 137 (a), 3906-3914). Thus, in the latter tissue, AVP, via these<br><br>
4<br>
receptors, would have an essential role in certain types of adrenal pheochromocytomas which secrete AVP and, as a result, induce a large production of catecholamines, causing hypertension resistant to angiotensin II receptor antagonists and to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The adrenal cortex is also rich in Via receptors involved in the production of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids (aldosterone and cortisol). Via these receptors, AVP (circulating or locally synthesized) can induce aldosterone production with an efficiency comparable to that of angiotensin II (G. GUILLON et al., Endocrinology, 1995, 136 (3), 1285-1295). Cortisol is a powerful regulator of the production of ACTH, the stress hormone.<br>
Recent studies have also shown that the adrenal glands are capable of directly releasing CRF and/or ACTH via activation of the Vib and/or Via receptors carried by the cells of the medulla (G. MAZZOCCHI et al. , Peptides, 1997, 18, (2), 191-195; E. GRAZZINI et al., J. Clin. Endocrinal. Metab., 1999, 84 (6), 2195-2203).<br>
Vib receptors are also considered to be tumour markers. For example, ACTH-secreting tumours, namely certain pituitary tumours, and certain bronchial carcinomas (small cell lung cancers, SCLC), pancreatic carcinomas, adrenal carcinomas and thyroid carcinomas, inducing Cushing's syndrome in some cases (J. BERTHERAT<br><br>
5<br>
et al., Eur. J. Endocrinol., 1996, 135, 173; G.A. WITTERT et al. , Lancet, 1990, 335, 991-994; G. DICKSTEIN et al. , J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. , 1996, 81. (8), 2934-2941), overexpress Vib receptors. As regards Via receptors, they are more specific markers for small cell lung cancers (SCLC) (P.J. WOLL et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1989, 164 (1), 66-73). Thus, the compounds according to the present invention are obvious diagnostic tools and offer a novel therapeutic approach in the proliferation and detection of these tumours, even at an early stage (radiolabelling; SPECT, for Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography; PET Scan, for Positron Emission Tomography Scanner).<br>
The abundant presence of the Vib receptor messenger in the stomach and intestines suggests that AVP is involved, via this receptor, in the release of gastrointestinal hormones such as cholecystokinin, gastrin or secretin (T. SUGIMOTO et al., Molecular cloning and functional expression of Vib receptor gene, in Neurohypophysis: Recent Progress of Vasopressin and Oxytocin Research; T. SAITO, K. KUROKAWA and S. YOSHIDA ed., Elvesier Science, 1995, 409-413).<br>

(2S,4R)-1-[5-chloro-l-[(2,4-<br>
dimethoxyphenyl)sulphonyl]-3-(2-methoxyphenyl)-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-lH-indol-3-yl]-4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyl-2-pyrrolidinecarboxamide, the levorotatory isomer, of formula:<br><br><br>
11<br>
is reacted with a functional derivative of an acid of formula:<br><br>
in which Ri is as defined for a compound of formula (I)<br>
Optionally, the compound of formula (I) is converted into one of its addition salts with a base.<br>
As functional derivative of the acid of<br>
formula (II) , us,e may be made of the acid chloride, an anhydride or the free acid itself.<br>
When an acid chloride is used, the reaction is carried out in a solvent such as a chlorinated solvent, such as dichloromethane, dichloroethane or chloroform, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, or an amide such as N,N-dimethylformamide, in the presence of a base such as triethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, pyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine or N,N-diisopropylethylamine, and at a temperature of between -60°C and ambient temperature.<br>
When an anhydride is used, the reaction is carried out in the presence or absence of a base such as pyridine or 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine, in a solvent or in the absence of solvent, at a temperature between ambient temperature and the reflux temperature of the reaction medium. When a solvent is used, said solvent<br><br>
12<br>
can be chosen from a chlorinated solvent such as dichloromethane, and an aromatic solvent such as toluene.<br>
A compound of formula (I) in which R1<br>
represents a group -CH2CH2COOH can also be prepared by reacting the compound A with succinic anhydride, in the presence of a base such as pyridine, in a solvent or in the absence of solvent, and at a temperature of between ambient temperature and the reflux temperature of the reaction medium.<br>
When the acid itself is used, the reaction is carried out using a condensing agent such as a carbodiimide, for instance 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or 1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide, or an imidazol, for instance 1,1'-oxalyldiimidazol or N,N'-carbonyl-diimidazol. The reaction is carried out in the presence or absence of a base such as triethylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, 4-dimethylamino-pyridine or N-methylmorpholine, in a solvent such as a chlorinated solvent, for instance dichloromethane, dichloroethane or chloroform, an ester, for instance ethyl acetate, an ether, for instance diethyl ether, diisopropylether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, a nitrile, for instance acetonitrile, an amide, for instance N,N-dimethylformamide, or an aromatic, for instance toluene or xylene, and at a temperature of between -20°C and 80°C.<br><br>
13<br>
When the acid itself is used, the reaction can also be carried out in the presence of an acid catalyst such as an inorganic acid, for instance hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid or sulphuric acid, an organic acid, for instance acetic acid, formic acid, oxalic acid, or p-toluenesulphonic acid, or a Lewis acid, for instance boron trichloride, boron trifluoride or boron tribromide.

A compound of formula (I) in which Ri represents a hydrogen atom can also be prepared by reacting the compound A with formic acid, in the presence of acetic anhydride and of a base such as pyridine, at a temperature of between 0°C and ambient temperature.<br>
According to a variant of the method and when R1 represents -a group -NR2R3:<br>
a) the compound A is reacted, in the presence of a base, with phenyl chloroformate so as to obtain the compound B of formula:<br><br>
14<br><br>
b) the compound B is reacted with a compound of formula:<br>
HNR2R3     (III)<br>
in which R2 and R3 are as defined for a compound of formula (I), so as to obtain a compound of formula (I) in which R1 = NR2R3.<br>
In step a), the compound A is reacted with phenyl chlorofornate in the presence of a base such as pyridine or triethylamine, in a solvent such as dichloromethane or without solvent, and at a temperature of between 0°C and 100°C.<br>
In step b), the reaction of the compound B with the compound of the formula (III) is carried out in a solvent such as dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran or a mixture of these solvents, and at a temperature of<br><br>
15<br>
between -60°C and the reflux temperature of the solvent.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) thus obtained can be subsequently separated from the reaction medium and purified according to conventional methods, for example by crystallization or chromatography.<br>
The compound A is prepared according to the method described in application WO 01/55130.<br>
The functional derivatives of the acids of the formula (II) are commercially available, known, or prepared according to known methods.<br>

TABLE   I<br><br><br><br>
25<br><br>
The compounds according to the invention were the subject of biochemical studies.<br>
The affinity of the compounds of formula (I) according to the invention, for Vib receptors for arginine-vasopressin, was determined in vitro using the method described by Y. DE KEYSER et al., Febs Letters, 1994, 356, 215-220. This method consists in studying, in vitro, the displacement of triturated arginine-vasopressin ([3H]-AVP) to Vib receptors present on cellular or adenohypophyseal membrane preparations bearing rat or human Vib receptors. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the binding of the triturated arginine-vasopressin, of the compounds according to the invention, are generally less than 5.0Xl0-9M. For<br><br>
26<br>
example, the compound of Example 1 has an IC50 of 3.4xlO-9M for human Vlb receptors.<br>
The affinity of the compounds of formula (I) according to the invention, for Via receptors for arginine-vasopressin, was determined in vitro using the method described by M. THIBONNIER et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1994, 269, 3304-3310. This method consists in studying, in vitro, the displacement of triturated arginine-vasopressin { [3H]-AVP) to Via receptors present on cellular or membrane preparations bearing rat or human Via receptors. Some compounds of formula (I) also exhibit an affinity for Via receptors for arginine-vasopressin, with IC50 values of the order of 10-8M. For example, the compound of Example 1 has an IC50 of 8.4xlO-8M for human V1a receptors.<br>
The compound A of the prior art has an IC50 of 1.0xlO-8M for human Vlb receptors and an IC50 of 3.1xl0-7M for human Vla receptors.<br>
The affinity of the compounds of formula (I) according to the invention, for V2 receptors of vasopressin, was also studied (method described by M. Birnbaumer et al., Nature (Lond.), 1992, 357, 333-335). The compounds studied have little or no affinity for V2 receptors.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can therefore be used for preparing medicinal products, in particular medicinal products intended to prevent or<br><br>
27<br>
treat any pathological condition in which arginine-vasopressin and/or its V1b receptors, or both its Vib receptors and its Via receptors, are involved.<br>
Thus, according to another of its aspects, a subject of the invention is medicinal products which comprise a compound of formula (I), or an addition salt of the latter with a pharmaceutically acceptable base, or else a solvent or a hydrate of the compound of formula (I).<br>
Thus, the compounds according to the<br>
invention can be used, in humans or in animals, in the treatment or prevention of various vasopressin-dependent conditions, such as cardiovascular conditions, for example hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, cardiac insufficiency, myocardial infarction or coronary vasospasm, in particular in smokers, Raynaud's disease, and unstable angina and PTCA (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty), cardiac ischaemia or disturbances of haemostasis; conditions of the central nervous system, such as migraine, cerebral vasospasm, cerebral haemorrhage, cerebral oedema, depression, anxiety, stress, emotional disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic attacks, psychotic states or memory disorders, for example; conditions of the renal system, such as renal vasospasm, necrosis of the renal cortex or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus; conditions of the gastric system,<br><br>
28<br>
such as gastric vase-spasm, cirrhosis of the liver, ulcers or the pathology of vomiting, for example nausea, including nausea due to chemotherapy or travel sickness; or diabetic nephropathy. The compounds according to the invention can also be used in the treatment of disorders of sexual behaviour; in women, the compounds according to the invention can be used to treat dismenorrhoea or premature labour. The compounds according to the invention can also be used in the treatment of small cell lung cancers; hyponatremic encephalopathy; pulmonary syndromes; Meniere's disease; glaucoma, cataracts; obesity; type II diabetes; atherosclerosis; Cushing's syndrome; insulin resistance; or hypertriglyceridaemia; or in postoperative treatments, in particular after abdominal surgery.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can also be used in the treatment or prevention of any pathological conditions resulting from stress, such as fatigue and its syndromes, ACTH-dependent disorders, cardiac disorders, pain, modifications in gastric emptying, in faecal excretion (colitis, irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn's disease) or in acid secretion, hyperglycaemia, immunosuppression, inflammatory processes (rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis), multiple infections, cancers, asthma, psoriasis, allergies and various neuropsychiatric disorders, such<br><br>
29<br>
as anorexia nervosa, bulimia, mood disorders, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, states of panic, phobias, obsession, disorders of pain perception {fibromyalgia), neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease or Huntingdon's disease), drug addiction, haemorragic stress, muscle spasms or hypoglycaemia. The compounds according to the invention can also be used in the treatment or prevention of chronic stress conditions, such as immunodepression, fertility problems or dysfunctioning of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can also be used as psychostimulants, resulting in an increase- in alertness or emotional reactivity to the surroundings, and making adaptation easier.<br>
