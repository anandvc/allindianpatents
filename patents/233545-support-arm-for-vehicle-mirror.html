				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a support arm for a vehicle mirror especially commercial vehicles &amp; more particularly to a rear view mirror assembly.<br>
Heretofore, vehicle mirrors have been provided which encompass at least one mirror head having at least one mirror pane. This mirror pane can be installed in a mirror housing to be either fixed or adjustable or it can be secured directly in a frame. Furthermore, if need be, an adjusting mechanism to adjust the mirror pane relative to the housing, as opposed to the entire housing, can be included. In a simplified variant, the mirror housing is fastened to an essentially U-shaped metal tube bracket whose two ends are then fastened to bearing blocks mounted to the vehicle. For example, in the EP 0 090 909 A3, the adjusting mechanism is fixed to the tube bracket by clamping. In the EP 0 590 510 B1, the housing itself is attached to the tube bracket by clamping. The tubing can then be secured to the bearing blocks mounted to the vehicle. In addition, EP 0 697 311 B1 suggests fastening plastic bearing blocks to the metal tube bracket using a tooth/detent arrangement to enable an angular adjustment of the tube bracket. Although this design is very stable and simple, it has several disadvantages. First, the mirror pane is only installed torque free with friction. Secondly, the design is<br><br>
aerodynamically disadvantageous and increases the unfavorable affects of drive resistance and strain resulting from the force of the wind. Also, the tube bracket, which is completely metal for stability reasons, is also heavy. With the additional plastic bearing blocks, a multitude of individual parts are necessary. This makes the manufacture and the assembly complex and expensive. For this EP 1 024 051 A3 suggests a one-piece support arm with two holding arms and one connection piece connected between the holding arms. The mirror carrier plate can be fixed to the connection piece of the support arm (which is manufactured entirely of plastic) by means of complementary fixing assemblys. This design also has several disadvantages. The mirror housings that were designed for the above-described tube bracket versions cannot be fastened to the support arm requiring several housings to be on hand. Also, in the event of an "upgrade" to a plastic support arm (which is more aerodynamically favorable and lighter), the housing can no longer be used. On the other hand, mirror panes with frames cannot simply be attached to the support arm without a housing. Furthermore, the attachment of the support arm, which is completely manufactured of plastic, is reduced which leaves the attached mirror exposed to vibrations that are wind induced or transferred by the vehicle. A corresponding configured fastener is necessary for a stable attachment of the housing to the connection piece so that it is not possible by simple twisting to use the same support arm for right-hand and left-hand driven vehicles as is the case with the above described tube bracket version, for example. In the driving direction, the driver's mirror is the left external mirror in left-hand driven vehicles and thus is turned<br><br>
less around the vertical axis of the vehicle then the passenger side right-hand mirror. In the case of right-hand driven vehicles, this is exactly the opposite. Therefore, up to now it has been necessary to provide four variants, i.e. driver/passenger vehicle for right/left-hand driven.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a support arm for a vehicle mirror that has a greater stability and reduced vibrations.<br>
Another object is to provide a support arm for a vehicle mirror that can be used for both driver and passenger mirrors for both right and left-hand driven vehicles.<br>
Summary Of The Invention The above objectives are accomplished according to the present invention by providing a support arm for a vehicle mirror including at least one mirror head, an upper holding arm made of plastic having an upper attachment element for fasten to the vehicle, a lower holding arm made of plastic having a lower attachment element for fasting to the vehicle, and a one-piece base assembled with the upper and lower holding arms. The base includes a metal tube whose upper and lower ends are connected securely to the upper and lower holding arms.<br>
The metal tube is made integral with the holding arms providing a support arm having a high stability, especially when considering the wind load and the vibrations coming from the vehicle. Furthermore, it makes it possible to utilize mirror heads that were designed for traditional bracket tubes. Therefore, the same<br><br>
mirror heads can advantageously be utilized for both traditional tube brackets, as well as supporting arms.<br>
As opposed to the above described one-piece plastic support arm, the metal tube especially offers the possibility for better attachment because corresponding attachment elements are attached directly to the metal tube and not to softer plastic. Up until now, with all known attachment types (positive fit, plug connections, screwing, clamping), the stability of the mirror head-support arm connection decreases as a result of aging and deterioration of the plastic.<br>
As opposed to the familiar U-shaped .tubing that is completely made of metal, the support arm has the advantage of reduced weight and greater design freedom with respect to aerodynamics. However, because the metal tube can be advantageously shaped to be identical to the cross web, the same mirror heads can be utilized.<br>
To further strengthen the plastic holding arms, at least one of these arms can encompass one or several embedded parts, preferably of metal. In this way, it is advantageously possible to keep the wall thickness in especially stressed areas thin. This saves not only material costs, but also helps avoid an undesirable material depression in manufacturing.<br>
As mentioned in the introduction, in the present application "mirror head" is understood to be at least one mirror pane with its holding frame or housing, in which the mirror pane is assembled to be fixed or adjustable. This is referring especially to the publications named in the introduction.<br><br>
To be especially cost efficient, a support arm according to the invention, can be manufactured so that the metal tube is fastened at its end by injection to the upper and/or lower holding arm. The metal tube is inserted in the casting mold and plastic forming the holding arms is injected in such a way that it circumfluents the spot facing from within or outside and the support arm is integrally manufactured. The metal tube is extrusion coated from within with a plastic tube that is integrally formed with the upper and/or support arm. The water or, as the case may be, gas internal pressure procedure is suitable for the injection of the metal tube.<br>
Likewise, the metal tube can be attached to the upper and/or lower holding arm by means of form fit or friction fit. For example, the metal tube can form fit under pressure into bores provided for this in the upper or lower holding arms or have tooth systems such as spline shaft profiles or fit-in keys.<br>
Likewise, the metal tube can be secured to the upper and/or lower holding arms by adhesive. The types of fasteners explained above can be mixed to attach the metal tube to the holding arms. One method can be selected for attachment to the upper holding arm and another for attachment to the lower holding arm.<br>
Preferably, the metal tube and/or the upper (lower) holding arm has a tooth/ detent system for locking on at least one mirror head in an angular position. For example, this system can be placed in the middle of the metal tube; this enables a very secure lock when installing a mirror head with a corresponding<br><br>
complementary tooth system at a specific angle. Alternatively or additionally, the area on the upper and/or lower holding arm in which or to which the tube is connected can also have a corresponding tooth/detent system. In this application, tooth/detent system always means all devices for form fit rotary fixing, such as inner/outer tooth system, spline shaft profiles, fit-in keys, raster or the like.<br>
The upper and/or lower attachment elements can encompass a fixed angle raster for fixing the support arm to the vehicle. For this reference is made to European patent EP 0 697 311 B1 referenced in the introduction, for example. Because the attachment devices in the plastic holding arms are integrated, the additional manufacturing and attachment of separate attachment devices such as rasters or the like becomes advantageously unnecessary.<br>
According to a second embodiment of the present invention, a support arm for a vehicle mirror with at least one mirror head encompasses a base that is formed in the shape of a base plate. During manufacture the base has a removable positioning wedge for the anglular rotation of the mirror head(s). The positioning wedge is designed so that it fixes the mirror head(s), especially the mirror pane(s) in at a greater angle which corresponds to the natural position of a passenger side mirror in a left or right-hand driven vehicle. The positioning wedge is preferably made of plastic and contains rated break points to break off material. When the positioning wedge is removed and the mirror head(s), especially the mirror pane(s), is secured in a slightly rotated position, the corresponding natural position of a driver side vehicle in a left or right-hand driven vehicle is provided.<br><br>
According to the second embodiment, a base plate with a-positioning wedge is initially assembled during manufacture. For this, an injection molding procedure is advantageously suitable when the base plate is manufactured of plastic. Subsequently the positioning wedge is removed in the event that a mirror head should be fixed in only a slight angle position relative to the base plate. The positioning wedge can also be removed later, i.e. not just directly at manufacturing or the first assembly. However, in the event that the mirror head should be more sharply inclined in contrast to the base plate, the positioning wedge should not be removed.<br>
Advantageously, the first and second embodiments of the present invention can be combined in that the metal tube of the first design can carry the base plate with the positioning wedge of the second design.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided  a support arm for a vehicle<br>
mirror having at least one mirror head, said support arm comprising an upper<br>
holding arm of plastics having an upper attachment member for mounting on a<br>
vehicle;<br>
a lower holding arm of plastics having a lower attachment member for mounting<br>
on the vehicle; and<br>
a base formed integrally with said upper and lower holding arms;<br>
characterised in that<br>
said base includes a metal tube having upper and lower ends fixedly connected<br>
with said upper and lower holding arms, respectively.<br><br>
According to the present invention there is also provided a method for manufacturing a support arm according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the water or gas internal pressure process, in which water or gas is introduced into the plastics material during molding, is employed for producing plastics parts.<br>

Figure 6 is a schematic top view of a right-hand driven vehicle having driver side and passenger side mirror support arms according to the embodiment of the invention illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
Description Of A Preferred Embodiment<br>
Referring now to the drawings, the invention will now be described in more detail.<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 1 A, a mirror support arm assembly, designated generally as A, is illustrated which includes a plastic upper holding arm (1) aerodynamically designed having a conically shaped attachment element (2) mounted on an end for attaching to the vehicle. In a similar manner, support arm assembly A includes a plastic lower holding arm (3) having an attachment element (4) on its end for attaching to the vehicle: Attachment element 4 is preferably in the<br><br>
form of a horizontal toothed raster (4a) with a cylindrical guiding. The attachment element may be fastened to a vehicle by means of a conventional pre-stressed spring and axial clamping ring (not shown), and locked into certain angle position relative to the vehicle by the teeth of raster 4a.<br>
The assembly includes a base provided in the form of a tube (5). As can best be seen in Figure 1B, tube 5 is preferably a metal tube having a portion of its opposing ends prepared to provide spot faces 5b and 5c (not shown but identical) for securernent with holding arms 1, 3. Preferably, the tubes are secured by having spot faces 5b, 5c injection molded within the upper and/or tower holding arm.  For this purpose, outer circumferential surface 5d of the tube is encapsulated in part by plastic material, and an inner circumferential surface 5b of the tube is encapsulated over its entire length by plastic at 2a which also forms the upper and lower holding arms.  For this purpose, a neck 2b, 3b is formed on holding arms 2, 3, respectively, for receiving the molded ends of the tube. For cladding the inner surface 5b of the tube 5 and for integrally connecting this inner claddin.q with the upper an lower holding arms 1, 3.gas assisted or water assisted injection molding is used. In this way, the supporting arm is integrally manufactured. Metal tube 5 and/or upper and lower holding arms 1, 3 have a vertical toothed connector section (1a, 3a, 5a) by which a mirror head or housing, such as 6, may be fastened to the tube in a specific angular position. The mirror head can be fastened to the metal tube or, as the case may be, the holding arms by means of clamps, plugs, screws, and the like.<br>
Figure 2 shows a support arm B according to another embodiment of the present invention. This is assembled in a similar manner to the first embodiment and includes an upper and lower holding arm (1) and (3), as well as upper and lower<br><br>
attachment elements (2) and (4). However, other support arm configurations can also be utilized in which, for example, only one support arm is provided, or the base plate is secured to a tube bracket or a support arm made completely of plastic or even be integrally formed with this support arm. In the illustrated embodiment, a base is formed by a base plate, designated generally as (6), having attachment elements (6a,6b) in the form of molded openings, notches, protrusions, screw holes, and the like in order to facilitate attaching mirror adjusting units 11, mirror panes 8a, and/or housing 8.<br>
As is best seen in the top plan view of Figure 3B, base plate (6) includes a positioning wedge (7), at least at manufacture. A housing (8) and a mirror pane (8a) of the mirror head is secured to base plate 6 so that a passenger mirror (10) of a right-hand driven vehicle is provided (Figure 6).   For this purposes, adjusting unit 11, carrying mirror pane 8a, is attached to either a free base 7a or wedge 7b, which in turn is secured to mounting plate 9 of base 6. As illustrated, screw fasteners 13 secure adjustment plate 11a and base 6 together as well as the intermediary parts. If the positioning wedge is removed after manufacture, housing (8) and the mirror pane (8a) can be secured to the free base (7b), providing a more slightly inclined angle position and a driver mirror (12) for a left-hand driven vehicle (Figure 5). In an analogical manner, the driver and passenger mirrors for right and left-hand driven vehicles, respectively, can be provided.<br>
For example, for a right-hand driven vehicle, a driver mirror (12a) may be provided by flipping base plate (6) and housing (8) upside down and attaching the<br><br>
same to a support arm A on the right side of the vehicle as can best be seen in Figure 6. For a right-hand driven passenger mirror (10a), base (6) and housing (8) of mirror (10) may be flipped and attached to the left side of the vehicle as can best be seen in Figure 6.<br>
To secure the housing or the mirror pane to the positioning wedge (7) or, should this be removed, free base (7b), the half-shell gear box described in the international patent application numbered WO 2002072386,or a similar adjustment unit is especially suitable. Therefore, the registration covers the entire content<br>
Thus, it can be seen, according to the present invention, a support arm assembly can be manufactured that can be used for both a passenger mirror for a right-hand driven or left-hand driven vehicle, a driver mirror for left-hand driven or right-hand driven vehicles. For this purpose, a support arm with a base plate is manufactured, to which a positioning wedge (7) is fixed. The positioning wedge is such that one side (7a) is inclined relative to the base plate, i.e. turned around a vertical axis of the vehicle in the installation position of the mirror. If the mirror head should be secured at a greater inclined position for the passenger side, its mirror pane and, if need be, housing (8) can be secured either directly or by means of an adjustment unit to the positioning wedge whose side (7a) is more inclined relative to base plate (6). For this purpose, the positioning wedge 7 has corresponding attachments, at least on its inclined side (7a).<br>
In the event the mirror head needs to be set in the more slight driver-side angle position, the positioning wedge is removed and the mirror pane and the<br><br>
housing (8) are secured to the base plate (6), either directly or by means of an adjustment unit, without the positioning wedge. Advantageously, for this reason, the positioning wedge and the base plate have the same attachments for the mirror pane unit.<br>
