HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>

LAUNDRY COMPOSITIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
5  This invention relates to a laundry composition.  More particularly, the invention is directed to a softening in the wash laundry composition.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
0<br>
Textile fabrics, including clothes, have traditionally been cleaned with laundry detergents.  After cleaning, fabrics can often feel harsh and they will wear and lose colour over repeat wash cycles.  To prevent the drawbacks of fabrics<br>
5  feeling harsh after cleaning and those experienced by multiple wash cycles, technologies have been developed including rinse conditioners, softening detergents and anti-dye transfer agents.<br>
0  However, existing technologies still do not fully prevent such fabric cleaning drawbacks.  Thus, there is an ongoing need for products that will condition and protect fabrics from the effects of the washing process.<br>
5  US 2004/0152617 Al and US 2004/0152616 are directed to fabric and textile conditioning compounds containing particular combinations of cationic polymers and anionic surfactants.<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>
PCT7EP2007/058226<br><br>

US 2005/0124528 Al relates to fabric and textile conditioning compositions with improved particulate soil cleaning, containing particular combinations of cationic polymers and anionic surfactants in combination with a 5  polyvinylpyrrolidone/amphiphilic carboxy containing polymer anti-redeposition system.<br>
There still remains a need for softening laundry detergent compositions that include cationic polymers, and which 10  maintain or improve the softening benefit to fabrics whilst avoiding or otherwise limiting any fabric cleaning negatives especially in respect to the redeposition of soil.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
15<br>
In a first aspect, this invention is directed to a softening in the wash detergent composition comprising:-<br>
(a)	at least 1% by weight of a detersive surfactant<br>
20	other than soap, with a molecular weight below 1000<br>
Daltons;<br>
(b)	at least 1% by weight of a C6-C30 soap;<br>
(c)	0.005% to 5% by weight of a polymeric non-ionic surfactant having a molecular weight above 2200<br>
25	Daltons; and,<br>
(d)	0.001% to 15% by weight of one or more cationic<br>
polymers capable of forming a complex with (b).<br>
In a second aspect, this invention is directed to a method 30  for increasing the deposition of soap onto a textile, the process comprising the steps:<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/058226<br><br>
-   3   -<br>
(a)	provision of a softening in the wash laundry composition as described herein; and,<br>
(b)	contacting one or more textile articles with the composition at one or more points during the main<br>
5	wash of a laundering process; and,<br>
(c)	allowing the textile articles to dry or<br>
mechanically tumble-drying them.<br>
In a fourth aspect, the invention is directed to a method to 10  reduce the redeposition of soil onto a textile by<br>
(a)	provision of a softening in the wash laundry<br>
composition as described herein; and,<br>
(b)	contacting one or more textile articles with the<br>
15	composition at one or more points during the main<br>
wash of a laundering process; and,<br>
(c)	allowing the textile articles to dry or<br>
mechanically tumble-drying them.<br>
20  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As used herein, the term "comprising" means including, made up of, composed of, consisting and/or consisting essentially of.<br>
25  All percentages quoted are wt.% unless otherwise stated.<br>
Except in the operating and comparative examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts or ratios of material or conditions of 30  reaction, physical properties of materials and/or use are to be understood as modified by the word "about".<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/058226<br><br>
-   4   -<br>
As used herein, a formula shall be considered physically "stable" when after 1 week at 21 degrees Celsius it exhibits no signs of phase separation.<br>
5  The present invention is directed to laundry compositions containing soap, a cationic polymer, a polymeric non-ionic surfactant and another detersive surfactant other than soap. The composition delivers a high level of conditioning to fabrics and also provides fewer cleaning negatives 10  (especially in respect to the redeposition of soil) in<br>
comparison to the compositions disclosed in the background art.<br>
Conditioning Benefits<br>
15<br>
The compositions of this invention are intended to confer conditioning benefits to garments, home textiles, carpets and other fibrous or fibre-derived articles.  These formulations are not to be limited to just conditioning<br>
20  benefits, however, and will often be multi-functional.  As such, in addition to conditioning fibre-derived articles, they may also clean, fragrance or otherwise treat them.<br>
The primary conditioning benefit afforded by these products 25  is softening.  Softening includes, but is not limited to, an improvement in the handling of a garment treated with the compositions of this invention relative to that of an article laundered under identical conditions but without the use of this invention.  Consumers will often describe an 30  article that is softened as "silky" or "fluffy", and<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/058226<br><br>
-   5   -<br>
generally prefer the feel of treated garments to those that are unsoftened.<br>
The conditioning benefits of these compositions are not 5  limited to just softening, however.  They may, depending on the particular embodiment of the invention selected, also provide an antistatic benefit.  In addition to softening, the cationic polymer/anionic surfactant compositions of this invention are further believed to lubricate the fibres of<br>
10  textile articles, which can reduce wear, pilling and colour fading, and provide a shape-retention benefit.  This lubricating layer is also believed to provide a substrate on the fabric for retaining fragrances and other benefit agents.  Furthermore, it is envisaged that the cationic<br>
15 polymers inhibit the transfer, bleeding and loss of vagrant dyes from fabrics during the wash, preventing the reduction of colour brightness over time.<br>
The invention provides increased cleaning benefits, or 20  otherwise limits any negative cleaning effects of the<br>
softening system.  One expression of a cleaning benefit is in respect to reducing the redeposition of soil onto fabrics during the laundry process.  The anti-redeposition benefit may be characterised by a benefit in the reflectance of the 25  fabric laundered with a composition according to the<br>
invention, in comparison to a comparative formulation.<br>
Form of the Invention<br>
30  The present invention can take any of a number of forms that are included as main wash products.  It can take the form of<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/058226<br><br>
-   6   -<br>
a laundry treatment agent for the main wash, which may be dilutable or non-dilutable.  The laundry treatment agent may be an isotropic liquid, a surfactant-structured liquid, a granular, spray-dried or dry-blended powder, a tablet, a<br>
5  paste, a molded solid or any other laundry detergent form known to those skilled in the art.  A "dilutable laundry treatment agent" composition is defined, for the purposes of this disclosure, as a product intended to be used by being diluted with water or a non-aqueous solvent by a ratio of<br>
0  more than 100:1, to produce a liquor suitable for treating textiles and conferring to them one or more conditioning benefits.  Water soluble sheets or sachets, such as those described in US Pat. Appl. No. 20020187909, which is incorporated herein by reference, are also envisaged as a<br>
5  potential form of this invention.  These may be sold under a variety of names, and for a number of purposes.  As such, compositions intended to be used as combination detergent/softeners, along with fabric treatment agents sold for application at the beginning of a wash cycle are all<br>
0  considered within the scope of this invention.<br>
Particularly preferred forms of this invention include combination detergent/softener products, especially as a liquid or solid, for example a powder, and isotropic or 5  surfactant-structured liquid products intended for<br>
application as a fabric softener during the wash cycle.  The most preferred form of the invention is as a combination detergent/softener product to provide "softening in the wash".<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/058226<br><br>
-   7   -<br>
Softening in the Wash<br>
By the term "softening in the wash" is meant a composition which provides a fabric softening benefit as well as 5  providing cleaning to the laundered fabric.  Such a<br>
composition can be added as part of a rnain wash product, or as a separate product for use in combination with another. However, for the purposes of this disclosure, the composition is intended for use in the main wash cycle. 10  Preferably the softening in the wash composition of the<br>
invention is incorporated as part of a single product for use in the main wash.<br>
pH<br>
15<br>
The preferred pH range of the composition is 2-12.  Because many cationic polymers can decompose at high pH, especially when they contain amine or phosphine moieties, it is desirable to keep the pH of the composition below the pKa of<br>
20  the amine or phosphine group that is used to quaternise the selected polymer, below which the propensity for this to occur is greatly decreased.  This reaction can cause the product to lose effectiveness over time and create an undesirable product odour.  As such, a reasonable margin of<br>
25  safety, of 1-2 units of pH below the pKa should ideally be used in order to drive the equilibrium of this reaction to strongly favour polymer stability.  Although the preferred pH of the product will depend on the particular cationic polymer selected for formulation, typically these values<br>
30  should be below about 8.5 to 10.  Wash liquor pH, especially in the case of powdered softener, and combination<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/058226<br><br>
-   8   -<br>
detergent/softener products, can often be less important, as the kinetics of polymer decomposition are often slow, and the time of one wash cycle is typically not sufficient to allow for this reaction to have a significant impact on the 5  performance or odour of the product.  A lower pH can also aid in the formulation of higher-viscosity products.<br>
Conversely, as the product depends on the presence of soluble anionic surfactants to provide softening, its pH<br>
10  should preferably be above the pKa of the surfactant acids used to formulate it.  In addition, aqueous detergent products, which are a highly preferred embodiment of this invention, are nearly impossible to formulate below the pKa of the surfactant acids used, as these molecules are rather<br>
15  insoluble in water when in acid form.  Again, it is<br>
especially desirable to have the pH at least 1-2 units above the pKa of the surfactant acids, to ensure that the vast majority of anionic surfactant is present in salt form. Typically, this will suggest that the product pH should be<br>
20  above about 4, although in certain cases, such as when<br>
carboxylic acid salts, which often have a pKa around 4 or 5, are used, the pH of the product can need to be above about 7 or 8 to ensure effective softening.  It is desirable to buffer the formulation at whatever the target pH of the<br>
25  composition is.<br>
Method of Use<br>
The following details a method for softening textiles 30  comprising the steps, in no particular order of:<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/058226<br><br>
-   9   -<br>
a.	providing a laundry detergent or fabric softener<br>
composition as described herein, comprising soap,<br>
at least one cationic polymer, a polymeric no-<br>
ionic surfactant and a detersive surfactant other<br>
5	than soap, in a ratio and concentration to<br>
effectively soften and condition fabrics under predetermined laundering conditions;<br>
b.	contacting one or more articles with the<br>
composition at one or more points during the main<br>
10	wash of a laundering process; and<br>
c.	allowing the articles to dry or mechanically<br>
tumble-drying them,<br>
Amounts of composition used will generally range between 15  about 10 g and about 300 g total product per 3 kg of<br>
conditioned fibrous articles, depending on the particular embodiment chosen and other factors, such as consumer preferences, that influence product use behaviour.<br>
20  A consumer that would use the present invention could also be specifically instructed to contact the fabrics with the inventive composition with the purpose of simultaneously cleaning and softening the said fabrics.  This approach would be recommended when the composition takes the form of<br>
25  a softening detergent to be dosed at the beginning of the wash cycle.<br>
Insoluble Matter<br>
30  It is preferred that the compositions of this disclosure be formulated with low levels, if any at all, of any matter<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/058226<br><br>
- 10 -■<br>
that is substantially insoluble in the solvent intended to be used to dilute the product.  For the purposes of this disclosure, "substantially insoluble" shall mean that the material in question can individually be dissolved at a 5  level of less than 0.001% in the specified solvent. Examples of substantially insoluble matter in aqueous systems include, but are not limited to aluminosilicates, pigments, clays and the like.  Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that solvent-insoluble inorganic<br>
10  matter can be attracted and coordinated to the cationic polymers of this invention, which are believed to attach themselves to the articles being washed.  When this occurs, it is thought that these particles can create a rough effect on the fabric surface, which in turn reduces the perception<br>
15  of softness.<br>
In addition, as liquid compositions are a possible embodiment of this invention, and insoluble matter is often difficult to formulate into a liquid, it is further 20  desirable to minimise its level in the product.  It is therefore desirable to have the liquid compositions be substantially transparent for aesthetic reasons.<br>
Preferably, insoluble and substantially insoluble matter 25  will be limited to less than 10 wt.% of the composition,<br>
more preferably 5 wt.%.  Most preferably, especially in the case of liquid conditioning compositions, the composition will be essentially free of substantially insoluble matter.<br><br>

Composition Ingredients<br>
Polymeric non-ionic surfactant<br>
5  A polymeric non-ionic surfactant is included in compositions according to the invention.  This non-ionic surfactant is present at a level of 0.005 to 5%, preferably from 0.01 to 4, more preferably from 0.05 to 3.5%, most preferably from 0.075 to 2.5%, for example 0.1 to 2% by weight of total 10  composition.  The surfactant can be a single compound, or a mixture of two or more different polymeric non-ionic surfactants.<br>
The surfactant has a molecular weight above 2200 Daltons; 15  preferably it has a molecular weight of less than 13000 Daltons.<br>
The polymeric non-ionic surfactant is understood to be a surface active agent, though it need not be detersive (i.e. 20  perform a cleaning action).<br>
Preferably the polymeric non-ionic surfactant is a block polymer.  Preferably it comprises, more preferably consists of, ethylene oxide and propylene oxide blocks as described 25  hereinafter.<br><br>

wherein EO represents an ethylene oxide unit, PO represents a propylene oxide unit, and x and y are numbers detailing the average number of moles ethylene oxide and propylene<br>
10  oxide in each mole of product.  Such materials tend to have higher molecular weights than most non-ionic surfactants, and as such can range between 1000 and 30000 Daltons, although the molecular weight should be above 2200 and preferably below 13000 to be in accordance with the<br>
15  invention.  A preferred range for the molecular weight of the polymeric non-ionic surfactant is from 2400 to 11500 Daltons.  BASF (Mount Olive, N.J.) manufactures a suitable set of derivatives and markets them under the Pluronic trademarks.  Examples of these are Pluronic (trademark) F77,<br>
20  L62 and F88 which have the molecular weight of 6600, 2450 and 11400 Daltons respectively.  An especially preferred example of a useful polymeric non-ionic surfactant is Pluronic (trademark) F77.<br>
25  Soap<br>
The inventive compositions include soap, herein defined as an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt of a natural or synthetic fatty acid containing between 6 and 30 carbon 30  atoms.  Preferably the soap contains between C8-C26, more<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/058226<br><br>
-   13   -<br>
preferably C8-C24, still more preferably C3-C18 carbon atoms. The incorporation level of the soap is at least 1% by weight of the total composition, preferably from 1 to 25%, more preferably from 1 to 15%, still more preferably from 1.25 to 5  10%, most preferably from 1.5 to 8% for example from 2 to 6% by weight of the total composition.  Particularly preferred forms of soap are outlined below.<br>
Carboxylic Acid Salts<br>
10	RXCOOM<br>
where J? is a primary or secondary alkyl group of 5 to 29<br>
carbon atoms and M is a solubilising cation.  The alkyl<br>
group represented by R    may represent a mixture of chain<br>
15  lengths and may be saturated or unsaturated, although it is<br>
preferred that at least two thirds of the R    groups have a<br>
chain length of between 7 and 17 carbon atoms.  Non-limiting examples of suitable alkyl group sources include the fatty acids derived from coconut oil, tallow, tall oil and palm<br>
20  kernel oil.  For the purposes of minimising odour, however, it is often desirable to use primarily saturated carboxylic acids.  Such materials are well known to those skilled in the art, and are available from many commercial sources, such as Uniqema (Wilmington, Del.) and Twin Rivers<br>
25  Technologies (Quincy, Mass.).  The solubilising cation, M, may be any cation that confers water solubility to the product, although monovalent such moieties are generally preferred.  Examples of acceptable solubilising cations for use with this invention include alkali metals such as sodium<br>
30  and potassium, which are particularly preferred, and amines such as triethanolammonium, ammonium and morpholinium.<br><br>

PCT7EP2007/058226<br><br>
-   14   -<br>
Although, when used, the majority of the fatty acid should be incorporated into the formulation in neutralised salt form, it is often preferable to leave a small amount of free fatty acid in the formulation, as this can aid in the 5  maintenance of product viscosity.<br>
Detersive surfactant other than soap<br>
A detersive surfactant is herein described as a surfactant 10  (surface active agent) which also provides a detersive<br>
function for cleaning and is suitable for laundry products.<br>
The composition of the invention comprises at least 1% by weight of a non-soap detersive surfactant with a molecular<br>
15  weight of below 1000 Daltons.  The detersive surfactant may be a single surfactant or a mixture of surfactants.  The non-soap detersive surfactant is present at a level of from 1 to 90%, preferably from 1.5 to 85%, more preferably from 2 to 80%, most preferably 4 to 75%, for Example 5 to 70%, in<br>
20  particularly 7.5 to 50% and especially 8 to 35% by weight of total composition.  In addition to the non-soap detersive surfactant defined above, which is present in compositions of the invention, there may also be present other detersive surfactants, which may have characteristics falling outside<br>
25 the defined values for the non-soap detersive surfactants (i.e. especially other optional detersive surfactants may have a molecular weight above 1000 Daltons).<br>
Suitable surfactants are described "Surface Active Agents" 30  Vol. 1, by Schwartz &amp; Perry, Interscience 1949, Vol. 2 by Schwartz, Perry &amp; Berch, Interscience 1958, in the current<br><br>

However, it is preferred if the non-soap 5  detersive surfactant is chosen from non-ionic surfactant, anionic surfactant of mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferred non~ionic surfactants and anionic surfactants are outlined below. 10<br>
Anionic Surfactants<br>
The anionic surfactants used in this invention can be any water soluble anionic surfactant other than soap.  "Water 15  soluble" surfactants are, unless otherwise noted, here defined to include surfactants which are soluble or dispersible to at least the extent of 0.01% by weight in<br>
distilled water at 25 C.  "Anionic surfactants" are defined<br>
herein as amphiphilic molecules comprising one or more 20  functional groups that exhibit a net anionic charge when in aqueous solution at the normal wash pH of between 6 and 11.<br>
If anionic surfactant is used as whole or part of the detersive non-soap surfactant, then it is preferably present<br>
25  at a level of from 1 to 90%, preferably from 1.5 to 85%,<br>
more preferably from 2 to 80%, most preferably 4 to 75%, for example 5 to 70%, in particularly 7.5 to 50% and especially 8 to 35% by weight of total composition.  If the anionic surfactant is used as part of the detersive non-ionic<br>

It is highly preferred, and often necessary in the case of certain compositions, to formulate the products of this invention with the proper ratio of cationic polymer to anionic surfactant.  Relative to the surface area of the 5  textiles generally laundered, the preferred ratios are<br>
unexpectedly low.  If the ratio is too high, this can result in reduced softening, poor packing at the interface, unacceptable dissolution times and, in the case of liquid products, an excessively high viscosity which can render the<br>
10  product non-pourable, and thus unacceptable for consumer use.  The use of lower ratios of cationic polymer to surfactant also reduces the overall level of polymer necessary for the formulation, which is also preferable for cost and environmental reasons, and gives the formulator<br>
15  greater flexibility in making a stable product.  The<br>
preferred ratio of cationic polymer: total surfactant will be less than about 1:4, whereas the preferred ratio of cationic polymer: anionic surfactant will be less than about 1:5, and the preferred ratio of cationic polymer: non-ionic<br>
20  surfactant will be less than about 1:5.  More preferably, the ratios of cationic polymer: total surfactant, cationic polymer: anionic surfactant and cationic polymer: total surfactant will be less than about 1:10.  In terms of absolute fraction, this often means that the concentration<br>
25  of cationic polymer will generally be less than about 5%,<br>
preferably less than about 2% and most preferably less than about 1% of the total product mass.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that 30  the species responsible for providing a conditioning benefit in these formulations is a polymer/surfactant complex,<br><br>

Many of the aforementioned cationic polymers can be synthesised in, and are commercially available in, a number of different molecular weights.  In order to achieve optimal<br>

15  entrap soils and prevent them from being removed.  The use of cationic polymers with an average molecular weight of less than about 850,000 Daltons, and especially those with an average molecular weight of less than 500,000 Daltons can help to minimise this effect without significantly reducing<br>
20  the softening performance of properly formulated products.<br>
On the other hand, polymers with a molecular weight of about 10,000 Daltons or less are believed to be too small to give an effective softening benefit.<br>
25  In certain cases, especially when these polymers are to be used in a powdered detergent/softener or fabric softener formulation, lower molecular weight polymers can even improve the softening performance of the product.  This is believed to be due to dissolution kinetics; materials of too<br>
30  high a molecular weight can fail to dissolve fully during the wash cycle, rendering them unavailable for softening<br><br>

fabrics.  The preferred powdered compositions of this invention include materials that have a dissolution parameter of more than about 55.<br>
5  Cleaning performance can further be improved by selecting a polymer with an appropriate level of cationic moiety. Again, it is believed that polymers with excessive levels of cationic charge can contribute to soil deposition, hindering the cleaning performance of either the fully formulated 2-<br>
10  in-1 detergent/softener or any laundry detergent that is<br>
used in conjunction with the compositions of this invention if they are to be standalone fabric softeners.  Particularly appropriate materials are those that comprise less than about 2 % by weight, preferably less than about 1.8 % by<br>
15  weight of cationic nitrogen or phosphorus.<br>
Optional Ingredients<br>
In addition to the above-mentioned essential elements, the 20  formulation may include one or more optional ingredients. While it is not necessary for these elements to be present in order to practice this invention, the use of such materials is often very helpful in rendering the formulation acceptable for consumer use. 25<br>
Examples of optional components include, but are not limited to: additional nonionic and anionic surfactants, amphoteric and zwitterionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, hydrotropes, fluorescent whitening agents, photobleaches, 30  fibre lubricants, reducing agents, enzymes, enzyme<br>
stabilising agents, powder finishing agents, defearners,<br><br>

builders, bleaches, bleach catalysts, soil release agents, antiredeposition agents, dye transfer inhibitors, buffers, colorants, fragrances, pro-fragrances, rheology modifiers, anti-ashing polymers, preservatives, insect repellents, soil 5  repellents, water-resistance agents, suspending agents,<br>
aesthetic agents, structuring agents, sanitisers, solvents, fabric finishing agents, dye fixatives, wrinkle-reducing agents, fabric conditioning agents and deodorizers.<br>
10  Preserva tives<br>
Optionally, a soluble preservative may be added to this invention.  Contamination of the product by microorganisms, which can occur through both raw materials and consumer use,<br>
15  can have a number of undesirable effects.  These include phase separation, the formation of bacterial and fungal colonies, the emission of objectionable odours and the like. The use of a preservative is especially preferred when the composition of this invention is a liquid, as these products<br>
20  tend to be especially susceptible to microbial growth.<br>
The use of a broad-spectrum preservative, which controls the growth of bacteria and fungi is preferred. Limited-spectrum preservatives, which are only effective on a single group of<br>
25  microorganisms may also be used, either in combination with a broad-spectrum material or in a "package" of limited-spectrum preservatives with additive activities.  Depending on the circumstances of manufacturing and consumer use, it may also be desirable to use more than one broad-spectrum<br>
30  preservative to minimise the effects of any potential contamination.<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>
PCT7EP2007/058226<br><br>
-   36   -<br>
The use of both biocidal materials, i.e. substances that kill or destroy bacteria and fungi, and biostatic preservatives, i.e. substances that regulate or retard the growth of microorganisms, may be indicated for this 5  invention.<br>
In order to minimise environmental waste and allow for the maximum window of formulation stability, it is preferred that preservatives that are effective at low levels be used.<br>
10  Typically, they will be used only at an effective amount. For the purposes of this disclosure, the term "effective amount" means a level sufficient to control microbial growth in the product for a specified period of time, i.e., two weeks, such that the stability and physical properties of it<br>
15  are not negatively affected.  For most preservatives, an effective amount will be between about 0.00001% and about 0.5% of the total formula, based on weight.  Obviously, however, the effective level will vary based on the material used, and one skilled in the art should be able to select an<br>
20  appropriate preservative and use level.<br>
Preferred preservatives for the compositions of this invention include organic sulphur compounds, halogenated materials, cyclic organic nitrogen compounds, low molecular 25  weight aldehydes, quaternary ammonium materials,<br>
dehydroacetic acid, phenyl and phenoxy compounds and mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples of preferred preservatives for use in the 30  compositions of the present invention include: a mixture of about 77% 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one and about<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/058226<br><br>
-   37   -<br>
23% 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one, which is sold commercially as a 1.5% aqueous solution by Rohm &amp; Haas (Philadelphia, Pa.) under the trade name Kathon; 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one, which is sold commercially by Avecia 5  (Wilmington, Del.) as, for example, a 20% solution in<br>
dipropylene glycol sold under the trade name Proxel GXL; and a 95:5 mixture of 1,3 bis (hydroxymethyl)-5,5-dimethyl-2,4 imidazolidinedione and 3-butyl-2-iodopropynyl carbamate, which can be obtained, for example, as Glydant Plus from 10  Lonza (Fair Lawn, N.J.).<br>
The preservatives described above are generally only used at an effective amount to give product stability.  It is conceivable, however, that they could also be used at higher 15  levels in the compositions on this invention to provide a biostatic or antibacterial effect on the treated articles.<br>
Fluorescent   Whitening Agents<br>
20  Many fabrics, and cottons in particular, tend to lose their whiteness and adopt a yellowish tone after repeated washing. As such, it is customary and preferred to add a small amount of fluorescent whitening agent, which absorbs light in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum and re-emits it in the<br>
25  visible blue range, to the compositions of this invention, especially if they are combination detergent/fabric conditioner preparations.<br>
Suitable fluorescent whitening agents include derivatives of 30  diaminostilbenedisulphonic acid and their alkali metal salts.  Particularly, the salts of 4,4'-bis(2-anilino4-<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/058226<br><br>
-   38   -<br>
morpholino-1,3,5-triazinyl-6-amino)stilbene-2, 2'-disulphonic acid, and related compounds where the morpholino group is replaced by another nitrogen-comprising moiety, are preferred.  Also preferred are brighteners of the 4,4'-5  bis (2-sulphostyryl) biphenyl type, which may optionally be blended with other fluorescent whitening agents at the option of the formulator.  Typical fluorescent whitening agent levels in the preparations of this invention range between 0.001% and 1%, although a level between 0.1% and 10  0.3%, by mass, is normally used.  Commercial supplies of<br>
acceptable fluorescent whitening agents can be sourced from, for example, Ciba Specialty Chemicals (High Point, N.C.) and Bayer (Pittsburgh, Pa.).<br>
15 Builders<br>
Builders are often added to fabric cleaning compositions to complex and remove alkaline earth metal ions, which can interfere with the cleaning performance of a detergent by 20  combining with anionic surfactants and removing them from the wash liquor.  The preferred compositions of this invention, especially when used as a Combination detergent/softener, contain builders.<br>
25  Soluble builders, such as alkali metal carbonates and alkali metal citrates, are particularly preferred, especially for the liquid embodiment of this invention.  Other builders, as further detailed below, may also be used, however.  Often a mixture of builders, chosen from those described below and<br>
30  others known to those skilled in the art will be used.<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/058226<br><br>

Alkali  and Alkaline Earth Metal   Carbonates<br>
Alkali and alkaline earth metal carbonates, such as those detailed in German patent application 2,321,001, published 5  Nov. 15, 1973, are suitable for use as builders in the<br>
compositions of this invention.  They may be supplied and used either in anhydrous form, or including bound water. Particularly useful is sodium carbonate, or soda ash, which both is readily available on the commercial market and has 10  an excellent environmental profile.<br>
The sodium carbonate used in this invention may either be natural or synthetic, and, depending on the needs of the formula, may be used in either dense or light form.  Natural<br>
15  soda ash is generally mined as trona and further refined to a degree specified by the needs of the product it is used in.  Synthetic ash, on the other hand, is usually produced via the Solvay process or as a coproduct of other manufacturing operations, such as the synthesis of<br>
20  caprolactam.  It is sometimes further useful to include a small amount of calcium carbonate in the builder formulation, to seed crystal formation and increase building efficacy.<br>
25 Organic Builders<br>
Organic detergent builders can also be used as nonphosphate builders in the present invention.  Examples of organic builders include alkali metal citrates, succinates, 30  malonates, fatty acid sulphonates, fatty acid carboxylates, nitrilotriacetates, oxydisuccinates, alkyl and alkenyl<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>
PCTYEP2007/058226<br><br>
-   40   -<br>
disuccinates, oxydiacetates, carboxymethyloxy succinates, ethylenediamine tetraacetates, tartrate monosuccinates, tartrate disuccinates, tartrate monoacetates, tartrate diacetates, oxidized starches, oxidized heteropolymeric<br>
5  polysaccharides, polyhydroxysulphonates, polycarboxylates such as polyacrylates, polymaleates, polyacetates, polyhydroxyacrylates, polyacrylate/polymaleate and polyacrylate/polymethacrylate copolymers, acrylate/maleate/vinyl alcohol terpolymers,<br>
0  aminopolycarboxylates and polyacetal carboxylates, and<br>
polyaspartates and mixtures thereof.  Such carboxylates are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,144,226, 4,146,495 and 4,686,062.  Alkali metal citrates, nitrilotriacetates, oxydisuccinates, acrylate/maleate copolymers and<br>
5  acrylate/maleate/vinyl alcohol terpolymers are especially preferred nonphosphate builders.<br>
Phosphates<br>
0  The compositions of the present invention which utilise a water-soluble phosphate builder typically contain this builder at a level of from 1 to 90% by weight of the composition.  Specific examples of water-soluble phosphate builders are the alkali metal tripolyphosphates, sodium,<br>
5  potassium and ammonium pyrophosphate, sodium and potassium orthophosphate, sodium polymeta/phosphate in which the degree of polymerisation ranges from about 6 to 21, and salts of phytic acid.  Sodium or potassium tripolyphosphate is most preferred.<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/058226<br><br>
-   41   -<br>
Phosphates are, however, often difficult to formulate, especially into liquid products, and have been identified as potential agents that may contribute to the eutrophication of lakes and other waterways.  As such, the preferred 5  compositions of this invention comprise phosphates at a<br>
level of less than about 10% by weight, more preferably less than about 5% by weight.  The most preferred compositions of this invention are formulated to be substantially free of phosphate builders. 10<br>
Zeolites<br>
Zeolites may also be used as builders in the present invention.  A number of zeolites suitable for incorporation<br>
15  into the products of this disclosure are available to the formulator, including the common zeolite 4A.  In addition, zeolites of the MAP variety, such as those taught in European Patent Application EP-B-384,070, which are sold commercially by, for example, Ineos Silicas (UK), as Doucil<br>
20  A24, are also acceptable for incorporation.  MAP is defined as an alkali metal aluminosilicate of zeolite P type having a silicon to aluminium ratio not exceeding 1.33, preferably within the range of from 0.90 to 1.33, more preferably within the range of from 0.90 to 1.20.<br>
25<br>
Especially preferred is zeolite MAP having a silicon to aluminium ratio not exceeding 1.07, more preferably about 1.00.  The particle size of the zeolite is not critical. Zeolite A or zeolite MAP of any suitable particle size may<br>
30  be used.  In any event, as zeolites are insoluble matter, it is advantageous to minimise their level in the compositions<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/058226<br><br>
-   42   -<br>
of this invention.  As such, the preferred formulations contain less than about 10% of zeolite builder, while especially preferred compositions compress  less  than about 5% zeolite. 5<br>
Enzyme  Stabilisers<br>
When enzymes and especially proteases are used in liquid detergent formulations, it is often necessary to include a<br>
10  suitable quantity of enzyme stabiliser to temporarily<br>
deactivate it until it is used in the wash.  Examples of suitable enzyme stabilisers are well-known to those skilled in the art, and include, for example, borates and polyols such as propylene glycol.  Borates are especially suitable<br>
15  for use as enzyme stabilisers because in addition to this benefit, they can further buffer the pH of the detergent product over a wide range, thus providing excellent flexibility.<br>
20  If a borate-based enzyme stabilisation system is chosen,<br>
along with one or more cationic polymers that are at least partially comprised of carbohydrate moieties, stability problems can result if suitable co-stabilisers are not used. It is believed that this is the result of borates' natural<br>
25  affinity for hydroxyl groups, which can create an insoluble borate-polymer complex that precipitates from solution either over time or at cold temperatures.  Incorporating into the formulation a co-stabiliser, which is normally a diol or polyol, sugar or other molecule with a large number<br>
30  of hydroxyl groups, can ordinarily prevent this.  Especially preferred for use as a co-stabiliser is sorbitol, used at a<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/058226<br><br>
-   43   -<br>
level that is at least about 0.8 times the level of borate in the system, more preferably 1.0 times the level of borate in the system and most preferably more than 1.43 times the level of borate in the system, is sorbitol, which is 5  effective, inexpensive, biodegradable and readily available on the market.  Similar materials including sugars such as glucose and sucrose, and other polyols such as propylene glycol, glycerol, mannitol, maltitol and xylitol, should also be considered within the scope of this invention. 10<br>
Fibre Lubricants<br>
In order to enhance the conditioning, softening, wrinkle-reduction and protective effects of the compositions of this<br>
15  invention, it is often desirable to include one or more<br>
fibre lubricants in the formulation.  Such ingredients are well known to those skilled in the art, and are intended to reduce the coefficient of friction between the fibres and yarns in articles being treated, both during and after the<br>
20  wash process.  This effect can in turn improve the<br>
consumer's perception of softness, minimise the formation of wrinkles and prevent damage to textiles during the wash. For the purposes of this disclosure, "fibre lubricants" shall be considered non-cationic materials intended to<br>
25  lubricate fibres for the purpose of reducing the friction between fibres or yarns in an article comprising textiles which provide one or more wrinkle-reduction, fabric conditioning or protective benefit.<br>
30  Examples of suitable fibre lubricants include oily sugar derivatives, functionalised plant and animal-derived oils,<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>
PCTYEP2007/058226<br><br>
-   44   -<br>
silicones, mineral oils, natural and synthetic waxes and the like.  Such ingredients often have low HLB values, less than about 10, although exceeding this level is not outside of the scope of this invention. 5<br>
Oily sugar derivatives suitable for use in this invention are taught in WO 98/16538, which is incorporated herein by reference.  These are especially preferred as fibre lubricants, due to their ready availability and favorable<br>
10  environmental profile.  When used in the compositions of this invention, such materials are typically present at a level between about 1% and about 10% of the finished composition.  Another class of acceptable ingredients includes hydrophilically-modified plant and animal oils and<br>
15  synthetic triglycerides.  Suitable and preferred<br>
hydrophilically modified plant, animal and synthetic triglyceride oils and waxes have been identified as effective fibre lubricants.  Such suitable plant derived triglyceride materials include hydrophilically modified<br>
20  triglyceride oils, e.g. sulphated, sulphonated,<br>
carboxylated, alkoxylated, esterified, saccharide modified, and amide derivatised oils, tall oils and derivatives thereof, and the like.  Suitable animal derived triglyceride materials include hydrophilically modified fish oil, tallow,<br>
25  lard, and lanolin wax, and the like. An  especially<br>
preferred functionalised oil is sulphated castor oil, which is sold commercially as, for example, freedom SCO-75, available from Noveon (Cleveland, Ohio).<br>
30  Various levels of derivatisation may b^ used provided that the derivatisation level is sufficient for the oil or wax<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/058226<br><br>
-   45   -<br>
derivatives to become soluble or dispersible in the solvent it is used in so as to exert a fibre lubrication effect during laundering of fabrics with a detergent containing the oil or wax  derivative.<br>
5<br>
If this invention includes a functionalised oil of synthetic origin, preferably this oil is a silicone oil.  More preferably, it is either a silicone poly ether or amino-functional silicone.  If this invention incorporates a<br>
0  silicone polyether, it is preferably of one of the two general structures shown below:<br>
Structure A<br>
Me3SiO—(MesSiO^-CMeSiOJy-OSiMeB<br>
PE<br>
Structure B<br>
(MeSiV2<br>

Where PE represents: CH2—CH2—CH2—O—(EO)m—(PO)n—Z<br>
where Me represents methyl; EO represents ethylene oxide; PO 5  represents 1,2 propylene oxide; Z represents either a<br>
hydrogen or a lower alkyl radical; x, y, m, n are constants and can be varied to alter the properties of the functionalised silicone.<br>
0  A molecule of either structure can be used for the purposes of this invention.  Preferably, this molecule contains more than 30% silicone, more than 20% ethylene oxide and less than 30% propylene oxide by weight, and has a molecular<br><br>

5  Amino-functional silicones come in a wide variety of<br>
structures, which are well-known to those skilled in the art.  These are also useful in the context of this invention, although over time many of these materials can oxidize on fabrics, leading to yellowing.  As this is not a<br>
10  desirable property of a fabric care composition, if an amino-functional silicone is used, preferably it is a hindered amine light stabilised product, which exhibits a greatly reduced tendency to show this behavior.  A commercially available example of such a silicone is<br>
15  Hydrosoft, available from Rhodia - US (Cranbury, N.J.)<br>
When the use of a fibre lubricant is elected, it will generally be present as between 0.1% and 15% of the total composition weight. 20<br>
Bleach   Catalyst<br>
An effective amount of a bleach catalyst can also be present in the invention.  A number of organic catalysts are 25  available such as the sulphonimines as described in U.S. Patents 5,041,232; 5,047,163 and 5,463,115.<br>
Transition metal bleach catalysts are &amp;lso useful, especially those based on manganese, iron, cobalt, titanium, 30  molybdenum, nickel, chromium, copper, Ruthenium, tungsten and mixtures thereof.  These include simple water-soluble<br><br>

[bipy2Mn   (u-O)2MnIVbipy2]-(CIO4)3.<br>
Iron and manganese salts of aminocarboxylic acids in general 25  are useful herein including iron and manganese<br>
aminocarboxylate salts disclosed for bleaching in the photographic colour processing arts.  A particularly useful transition metal salt is derived from<br><br>

Another type of bleach catalyst, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. 5  5,114,606, is a water soluble complex of manganese (II),<br>
(III), and/or (IV) with a ligand which is a non-carboxylate polyhydroxy compound having at least three consecutive C-OH groups.  Preferred ligands include sorbitol, iditol, dulsitol, mannitol, xylitol, arabitol, adonitol, meso-10  erythritol, meso-inositol, lactose and mixtures thereof. Especially preferred is sorbitol.<br>
Other bleach catalysts are described, for example, in<br>

Co (III) complexes with ammonia and mono-, bi-, tri- and<br>
2 tetradentate ligands such as [Co (NH3) 5OAC] + with Cl , OAc ,<br>
5  PFe , SO4 , and BF4 anions.<br>
Certain transition-metal containing bleach catalysts can be prepared in the situ by the reaction of a transition-metal salt with a suitable chelating agent, for example, a mixture 10  of manganese sulphate and ethylenediaminedisuccinate.<br>
Highly  coiaared1 transition metai-containing bleach catalysts may be co-processed with zeolites to reduce the colour impact.<br>
15  When present, the bleach catalyst is typically incorporated at a level of about 0.0001 to about 10% by wt., preferably about 0.001 to about 5% by weight.<br>
Hydrotropes<br>
20<br>
In many liquid and powdered detergent compositions, it is customary to add a hydrotrope to modify product viscosity and prevent phase separation in liquid^, and ease dissolution in powders.<br>
25<br>
Two types of hydrotropes are typically used in detergent formulations and are applicable to this invention.  The first of these are short-chain functioiialised amphiphiles. Examples of short-chain amphiphiles include the alkali metal<br>
30  salts of xylenesulphonic acid, cumenesulphonic acid and<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/058226<br><br>

octyl sulphonic acid, and the like.  In addition, organic solvents and monohydric and polyhydric alcohols with a molecular weight of less than about 500, such as, for example, ethanol, isoporopanol, acetone, propylene glycol 5  and glycerol, may also be used as hydrotropes.<br>
Soil  Release Agents<br>
In order to prevent the resoiling of fabrics during and<br>
10  after the wash, one or more soil release agents may also be added to the products of this invention.  Many different types of soil release agents are known to those skilled in the art, depending on the formulation in use and the desired benefit.  The soil release agents useful in the context of<br>
15  this invention are typically either antiredeposition aids or stain-repelling finishes.  Examples of anti-redeposition agents include soil release polymers, such as those described in WO 99/03963, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>

In addition, the cationic polymers of this invention are particularly advantageous when used in conjunction with a stain-repelling finish.  Such materials are typically either fluoropolymers or fluorosurfactants, although the use of<br>
25  other amphiphilic materials with extremely hydrophobic lyophobes, such as silicone surfactants, is also conceivable.  Non-limiting examples of suitable anionic fluorosurfactants are taught in U.S. Patent No. 6,040,053, which is incorporated herein by reference.  Without wishing<br>
30  to be bound by theory, it is believed that the cationic<br>
polymers of this invention coordinate to the fabric surface<br><br>

Table 1 - Details of the three formulations<br>
5  A control formulation (formulated without cationic polymer) was prepared as well as comparative formulation A (formulated without the polymeric non-ionic surfactant) and formulation 1 according to the present invention.  The values in the table are weight percentages and the 10  formulations were in liquid form.<br>
Explanation of the Ingredients<br>
All ingredients are quoted as percentages by weight of total 15  formulation.<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>

F-77 is an ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block copolymer having an average molecular weight of 6600.  It is available under the Pluronic (Trademark) name from BASF.<br>
5  The cationic polymer used in the formulations is a cationic cellulosic polymer LR-400 from Dow Amerchol.<br>
Prifac 5908 is palmkernel fatty acid having an iodine value lower than 1.0. 10<br>
The non-soap detersive surfactants used in the above formulation are linear alkyl benzene sulphonate and alcohol ethoxylate - 7EO.<br>
15  Optional ingredients incorporated were dyes, perfume, opacifier (Acusol), optical brightener (Tinopal CBS-X), sequestrant (Dequest 2066), hydrotrope (propylene glycol), salt (NaCl) and neutraliser (MEA and NaOH).<br>
20  An anti-redeposition polymer (PVP-K15) was included in the control formulation and for formulation A.  As the anti-redeposition data shows, formulation 1 according to the invention (and which does not include the anti-redeposition polymer) shows a marked improvement in reducing redeposition<br>
25  of soil in comparison to formulation A, which is not according to the invention.<br>
The three formulations were tested for softening efficacy by an expert panel.  The formulations were also tested for cleaning, on three different fabric types, by running an<br>
30  anti-redeposition experiment.  Two other formulations were also tested for anti-redeposition on cotton fabric.  These<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/058226<br><br>
-   54   -<br>
differed from formulation 1 only in that polymeric non-ionic surfactants of differing molecular weights were used.<br>
Softness Evaluation<br>
5<br>
The softness evaluation used a panel of 10 trained assessors to assess the softness value of machine laundered cotton fabric articles by the three formulations.  The fabric articles were cotton swatches each being the same size (20<br>
0  cm by 20cm).  The softness scale used went upwards from 1, with 1 being not soft (so the higher the number the better). Each panellist assessed various items at random from the three washes and gave each laundered swatch a softness score.  The score stated in table 2 is the average (mean)<br>
5  value for softness recorded.<br>
The laundering process used was as follows and was the same for all three formulations;-<br>
0  Washing machine<br>
•	Computer controlled Miele (Trademark) FLA machines<br>
•	60°C, cotton wash<br>
•	26°FH -(French Degree of Water Hardness)<br>
•	2.5 kg load of cotton fabric swatches of the same size<br>
5    • Product introduced to wash via dosing ball - 120 gm per wash<br>
•	Monadic assessment, 10 assessors (expert panel).<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/058226<br><br>
-   55   -<br>
Table 2 records the average (mean) value for the softness of a fabric article laundered with each formulation.<br><br>
Formulation	Mean Score<br>
Control	2.8<br>
Formulation A	3.5<br>
Formulation 1	3.8<br>
5  Table 2 - Softness Values<br>
The results for both comparative formulation A and formulation 1 (according to the invention) show a significant benefit in comparison to the control formulation<br>
0  for softness.  Formulation 1 according to the invention even shows a greater softening value in comparison to formulation A.  As it is believed that it is a cationic polymer/soap complex that provides the softening benefit, then we can see that as  softness is increased in formulation 1 in comparison<br>
5  to formulation A, then we believe that deposition of soap is increased by adding the non-ionic block polymer surfactant according to the invention.<br>
Anti-redeposition Data<br>
0<br>
Redeposition of soil was quantified by using a change in reflectance of the fabric.  Such a technique is well known in the art.  The reflectance was expressed by measuring the initial reflectance at 460 nm, with contribution due to UV<br>
5  excluded, (hereafter referred to as R460*) of the swatches using a HunterLab (trademark) UltraScan (trademark) XE reflectometer.  Following washing the individual swatches<br><br>
WO 2008/034674<br><br>
PCTYEP2007/058226<br><br>
-   56   -<br>
were air-dried and the final reflectance values for the swatches at R460* determined.  The change in reflectance AR is determined by subtracting the initial reflectance from the final reflectance; the average change in reflectance for 5  the different fabric swatches laundered with the three different formulations is presented in table 3 below.<br><br>
Formulation	Cotton	Polycotton	Knitted polycotton<br>
	AR460* reading	AR460* reading	AR460*<br>
reading<br><br>
Control	-2.305	-0.865	0.1<br>
Formulation A	-2.95	-1.44	-1.295<br>
Formulation 1	-1.9525	-1.01	-0.8025<br>
10<br>
Table 3 - Anti-redeposition Data<br>
From table 3, it is clear that formulation 1 has a clear benefit in terms of increased anti-redeposition in 15  comparison to formulation A (which does not include the<br>
polymeric non-ionic surfactant), in that there has been a lower redeposition of soil onto the fabric as expressed by the AR460* value for reflectance.<br>
20  A further anti-redeposition	experiment was carried out using<br>
the method outlined above.	The formulations tested utilised<br>
the same ingredients as per	formulation 1, only this time<br>
the molecular weight of the	polymeric non-ionic surfactant<br>
used was varied.  The level	of incorporation was 1% by<br><br>

weight as before.  The three polymeric non-ionic surfactants were sourced from BASF under the Pluronic trademark.<br>
F-77 is an ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block copolymer 5  having an average molecular weight of 6600.  It is available under the Pluronic (Trademark) name from BASF.<br>

F-88 is an ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block copolymer having an average molecular weight of 11400.  It is available under the Pluronic (Trademark) name from BASF.<br>
15<br>
The tests were carried out on cotton fabric swatches.  The results are expressed in table 4 and show useful benefits for soil anti-redeposition for a range of polymeric non-ionic surfactants with molecular weights from -2400 to 11500<br>
