				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
<br>
The present invention relates to fuels.<br>
Particularly, the present invention relates to alternative fuels.<br>
<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION &amp; PRIOR ART<br>
<br>
The recent energy crisis has created havoc in the world. The demand for fuel for industrial and domestic purposes, automobiles and the like is increasing at an alarming rate. With limited resources at hand, meeting the demand at an affordable price seems to be next to impossible. At this crucial juncture, the need for finding alternative fuel is of utmost importance.<br>
<br>
Alternative fuels, also known as non-conventional fuels are substances that can be used as a fuel, other than conventional fuels. Conventional fuels include fossil fuels (petroleum (oil), coal, propane, and natural gas), and nuclear materials such as uranium.<br>
<br>
Some well known alternative fuels include biodiesel, bioalcohol (methanol, ethanol, butanol), chemically stored electricity (batteries and fuel cells), hydrogen, non-fossil methane, non-fossil natural gas, vegetable oil and other biomass sources.<br>
<br>
Waste rubber material is the most routine form of hydrocarbon-containing polymer materials. Used tyres of vehicles and, especially, metal-cord tyres are presently the principle	source of	waste	rubber	materials.<br>
<br>
It is generally known that waste rubber materials can serve as a source of valuable recycled resources. However, the recovery of valuable resources is generally impeded by high strength of chemical bonds in macromolecules of vulcanized rubber. Several efforts have been made in the prior art to harness the energy trapped in such waste materials.<br>
United States Patent 5,894,012 discloses a method and system for recovering marketable end products from waste rubber. The processing system pyrolyzes waste rubber to produce pyrolysis oil and carbon black and then purifies and refines these end products to broaden their commercial applications and to increase their market value.<br>
<br>
United States Patent 5,976,484 discloses an intermittent continuous method for recovery of refined activated carbon from waste tires and the like and the device therefor. The method involves a series of heating, dry distillation and splitting decomposition.<br>
<br>
United States Patent 6,743,746 discloses a catalyst for the low-temperature pyrolysis of hydrocarbon-containing polymer materials mainly intended for use in the recycling of rubber waste materials. The catalyst is prepared from a carbon-iron component in the form of microscopic carbon particles and ultra-dispersed iron particles. The catalyst further contains a metal-carbon component.<br>
<br>
United States Patent 6,538,166 discloses a process and apparatus for treatment of Waste rubber. The process includes heating a quantity of rubber in an atmosphere at a negative pressure and at a temperature between 340 Celsius and 510 degrees Celsius such that the rubber is vaporized and defines a vaporized rubber. The vaporized rubber has a plurality of hydrocarbon constituents therein. A venturi separator sprays the vaporized rubber with oil having a boiling temperature greater than 175 degrees Celsius. The oil binds to heavy oil in the hydrocarbon constituents. A remaining portion of the vaporized rubber is condensed such that light oils in the hydrocarbon constituents liquefy and are separated from hydrocarbon gases.<br>
<br>
United States Patent Application 20060265954 discloses a gasifier for the gasification of biomass and waste to produce combustible effluent, producing combustible gases for energy generation.<br>
<br>
United States Patent Application 20050023124 discloses a pyrolytic conversion process of scrap tires to carbon products. A char containing less than 5% volatile matter is produced by pryolyzing shredded scrap vehicle tires and other rubber scrap material in an externally heated retort until the rubber is completely decomposed and until the temperature of the gases produced by the pyrolysis process reaches at least 500 degree C.<br>
 <br>
United States Patent 5,744,668 discloses a process of producing gasoline, diesel and carbon black with waste rubbers and/or waste plastics. The process comprises pyrolysis, purifying, catalytic cracking, and fractionation.<br>
<br>
International Application No.: PCT/PL2004/000081 discloses a method and a device for continuous conversion of organic waste, in particular, highly contaminated waste plastics and worn out vehicle tyres.<br>
<br>
The methods and the devices disclosed in the prior art are tedious, labour-intensive and time consuming. Further, the disclosed methods are not cost-effective. In addition, most of the known methods and means for rubber destruction are dangerous because of the environmental contamination with sulfur compounds, carcinogenic carbon black and certain other toxic substances. Thus, an efficient, safe and economic method of conversion of waste rubber and tyres into fuel is the need of the hour.<br>

<br>

<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, said catalyst has a particle size ranging from about 0.1 mm to about 10 mm.<br>
<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, said catalyst is introduced at a concentration ranging from about 0.001 to about 10% of the total mass of reactants in the reactor, preferably about 1 - 4%.<br>
<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, heating of the waste rubber material is preferably carried out at a temperature ranging from about 350°C to about 450°C.<br>
<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, air is removed from the reactor to create vacuum at the start of reaction.<br>
<br>
Typically, a tyre comprises about 40% rubber, about 15% steel, about 5% textile fabrics, about 25% soot and about 15% chemical compounds.<br>
<br>
The present invention provides an effective and highly efficient process for the conversion of waste rubber material into fuel. <br>
<br>
Typically, the process is suitable for being carried out on a large scale. The special method, conducting the decomposition reactions catalytically in the presence of a novel and inexpensive catalyst provides a control over the temperature of the liquid fraction, and greatly improves the efficiency of the process and the quality of the final product.<br>
<br>
The catalyst is introduced at a ratio ranging from about 0.01:1 to about 0.10:1 of the total mass of reactants in the reactor. As the quantity of catalyst is increased with the proportion of the total mass, the total reaction time is reduced and the yield is more. <br>
<br>
As the temperature of the reaction is increased the yield percentage is more. Typically, 80% of the product is obtained at 390°C.<br>
<br>
The decomposition product, in the form of gaseous and liquid mixture of smaller hydrocarbons is suitable to be recycled as raw material for polymers or liquid fuels or other chemical industry processes or serves directly as fuel for combustion engines, e.g. electric generators boilers, raw material for petroleum industry, bunker fuel and the like. The solid product obtained in the reactor is coke which can be used as fuel for thermal power plants and metallurgical industries.<br>
<br>
As described in the figures 1-3, the present invention concerns also a device for conversion of waste rubber material into fuel, said device containing a housing (reactor), a heating system and a product collecting system. The charge of waste, say shredded tyre of about 20 mm size is introduced into the reactor having a hot bath whose temperature is maintained at about 300-500°C, preferably about 350-450°C. The catalysts are added at this stage to hasten the process of pyrolysis. The gaseous products of the decomposition are collected at the top and cooled by passing through pipes maintained at about 5-30°C. A reservoir maintained at 0°C stores the condensed product which is used as fuel.<br>
<br>
During the reaction, the molecules of rubber pieces penetrate the structure of the catalyst and absorb on the active areas to react. A catalyst of this type has the advantage of presenting a large reactive surface and it also provides better reaction selectivity. A large pore catalyst is used for catalytic cracking which allows the largest molecules access to the active areas. The catalyst also serves to increase the rate of forward reaction and minimize the temperature of the reaction.<br>
<br>
Typically, about 200 ml of heavy oil is added along with the catalyst.<br>
<br>
A typical catalyst composition in accordance with this invention along with the respective optimum temperatures for the conversion of waste rubber material including used tyres into fuel is provided in Table 1.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
A typical combination of the catalysts added at specific ratios to the waste rubber material and the yield of the fuel generally expected is tabulated in Table 2.<br>
 <br>
Table 2: Catalyst Ratio and the expected yield<br>
 <br>
Further, the novel construction of the housing as described in the present invention ensures right isolation and at the same time gives easy access to the interior of the device.<br>
 <br>
The novel construction of the heating system allows to fully utilize the heat energy and its supply to the whole volume of the reaction mixture. It provides a control over the temperature of the liquid fraction and prevents the reaction mass and impurities from entering into the cooling pipes which ensures long life of the bath.<br>
The method and the device according to the present invention have been realized on industrial scale. According to the present invention, the process of catalytic conversion takes place continuously. The thermo-catalytic reactions in the reaction vessel do not require high pressure or addition of hydrogen. The catalyst is cheap and the spent catalyst can be recycled 1 to 2 times. Only one heating source is used in the technological production line. The product is of high quality and the by-product is potentially useful as wax for starting material for candle production.<br>
<br>
The total time for the completion of reaction ranges from 1.5 to 3 hours, which is visibly indicated by stopping of liquids being collected in the receiver vessel.<br>
<br>
Typically, the yield of the products obtained in accordance with this invention is as follows:<br>
<br>
Liquid hydrocarbon: 40 - 60%; Solid coke: 40-50%; and Gas: 5 - 20%<br>
