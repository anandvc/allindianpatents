				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DISPLAYING HIERARCHICALLY<br>
 STRUCTURED DATA<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed toward a system and method for editing<br>
source code templates in a target language utilizing a graphical user interface.<br>
More particularly, the present invention is directed to a system and method in<br>
which a programmer parameterizes target source code with contextual meta-<br>
data provided by the application domain. He determines the repetitive and<br>
nesting structures of the code which is visually clear, easy to maintain and fully<br>
consistent.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is commonly said that object-oriented techniques help model the real<br>
world more closely than conventional techniques and it is mostly done using<br>
modeling tools. While building a complex system, software programmers and<br>
clients can easily establish their common vocabulary, which helps them refine<br>
system requirements effectively. Object-oriented techniques also help them<br>
build a system that is easily extensible, especially when frameworks are used.<br>
Modeling tools are used by programmers or analysts to depict the business<br>
purpose of an application in a logical way that is abstracted from the "physical<br>
implementation" of the specific programming language, operating system and the<br>
hardware that the application runs on.<br>
One of the reasons that object-oriented programming is becoming more<br>
popular is that software reuse is becoming more important. Developing new<br>
systems is expensive, and maintaining them is even more expensive. A recent<br>
study by Wilma Osborne of the National Bureau of Standards suggests that 60<br>
to 85 percent of the total cost of software is due to maintenance (Ware Meyers.<br>
Interview with Wilma Osborne. IEEE Software 5(3): 104-105, 1988).<br>
Programmers traditionally use "cut and paste" techniques to facilitate the<br>
implementation of repetitive and near-repetitive methods. A kind of template is a<br>
block of target source code annotated where the change is needed, saved in a<br>
common location and reused by a programmer with some manual interventions.<br>
The programmer who created that block of target source code or another<br>
programmer can then re-use these lines by copying and pasting the appropriate<br>
lines into the codes he is working on and making the appropriate changes for<br>
that particular usage. This method is error-prone and time-requiring since, in<br>
addition to copying the right lines of codes, sometimes repeatedly, the<br>
programmer has to replace all appropriate components" names by their<br>
appropriate equivalents. This is called coding with annotated source code<br>
template.<br>
Some generation software tools allow the programmer to use textual<br>
generation templates, which consist of parameterized lines of source code, to<br>
create new operations or components. These textual generation templates<br>
enable programmers to specify the selected components for which they want to<br>
generate code by using filter variables, as well as to define the complete<br>
specifications of the operation using target source code that is parameterized by<br>
context variables. Component and attribute filter variables are used by the code<br>
generator as selection criteria to filter information from the modeling tool and to<br>
populate its dynamic generation context. Context variables refer to a component<br>
or attribute property name that the code generator replaces with the actual<br>
property value associated with the current component or attribute found in its<br>
dynamic context.<br>
These code generators are used to deliver generation-time control and<br>
customization for integrating frameworks with components developed using<br>
today"s modeling tools and programming languages. Textual generation<br>
templates are created with programmer"s instructions that are given using a<br>
rigorous syntax and are used by the source code generator to replace any<br>
context variable in the provided parameterized source code. For example, a line<br>
of code could be: "persistenceSchema = new PersistenceSchema("%001"); with<br>
(&amp;class name)", in which "%001" is a parametric symbol representing where the<br>
value of the context variable would be put by the generator, for example, the<br>
context variable "<class name>". The programmer has to create textual<br>
generation templates using these symbols. A mental list of such symbols must<br>
be built up in order for the programmer to stay consistent in naming the<br>
components, especially when there is more than one parametric symbol from<br>
%001 up to %999 that needs to be respectively associated with a context<br>
variable. A parametric symbol can appear more than once in the parameterized<br>
source code since it is always associated with the same context variable. Such<br>
symbols are not user-friendly in the sense that they do not enable the<br>
programmer to type code, as he would normally do in a non-parameterized<br>
form. In addition, these symbols have to be defined within the lines of codes to<br>
ensure proper interpretation by the generator. In the previous example, the<br>
instruction "with (&amp;class name)" has to be added in order to instruct the<br>
generator that the parametric symbol "%1" would be replaced by the current<br>
value of the context variable associated with the current class found in the<br>
dynamic context of the generator. Also, when certain portions of the code have<br>
to be repeated more than once for attributes of a component that address the<br>
selection criteria provided by filter variables, an instruction of the kind<br>
"repeatForEach &amp;attribute private instance using (&amp;attribute name; &amp;attribute<br>
attributeClassName;" would have to be included to ensure the near-repetitive,<br>
operation. The code generator, in this case, will take the templates and<br>
transform then into source code using a model declaration for the system and<br>
filter variables that are defined in order to specify which templates are used for<br>
which components.<br>
Instead of using such a syntax relying on keywords (i.e. %001) and<br>
definitions of such keywords (i.e. repeatForEach...using...or with...), a<br>
programmer could decide to concatenate the parameterized code with the result<br>
of an instruction performed by an algorithm implemented in a given<br>
programming language. For example, like is taught in US patent no. 5,675,801<br>
to Lindsey, the software would solve the expression in parameterized form with<br>
the result of another operation. More specifically, in an example of the<br>
declaration source code template in the C language for data-oriented object<br>
known as the NumericDataltemObject and representing the C variable called<br>
"IdNumber", an instruction of the kind "int <self varname>;" could be used, in<br>
which "int" and ";" are the source code fragment portion of this source code<br>
template and the directive for the generator is "<self varname>". In this<br>
example, the "" are arbitrary delineators indicating the beginning and<br>
the end of a generator directive. In this case, the object identifier is the token<br>
"self, which refers to the object being asked to generate itself, namely<br>
"IdNurnber", its variable name. The message identifier is the token "varName" which<br>
will be the message sent to the object "self. This message tells the object "self to<br>
return the string representing itself when used in a variable declaration. In this example<br>
for Lindsey, the NumericDataltemObject, whose name is "ldNumber", will return the<br>
string "idNumber". The resulting target language source code fragment is "int<br>
idNumber;", which is a C language source code fragment.<br>
The use of colors and other display artifacts have been used in source code<br>
editors to increase the understanding of the procedural flow of an algorithm but never<br>
used to describe the structure of the Information provided, such as repetitive and/or<br>
nested Context Blocks. For example, an If-theh-else statement using different colors for<br>
its condition expression, its true-expression and its false-expression that have to be<br>
executed based on the result of the conditional expression. Display artifacts have never<br>
been used to illustrate the fact that the same if-then-else expression is repeated within<br>
a given component algorithm for every attribute meeting a set of selection criteria.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,603,018 teaches a system for program development with graphic<br>
editors which can represent specifications. hierarchically and with capabilities of<br>
conversion between representation formats of different graphic editors.<br>

visualization of the control information for humans. The second provides a deterministic<br>
transformation of this control information into a machine-understandable format.<br>
The first process provides a context sensitive editor, to create, modify and<br>
display hierarchically structured control information. The editor presents action choices<br>
appropriate to the immediately current context, thereby simplifying the manipulation<br>
protocol of the user. Because the editor understands the relationships and multiplicity<br>
between the contexts, its graphical user interface represents the repetition and<br>
conditionality of the blocks without resorting to a scripting language. The editor displays<br>
the control information according to the presentation rules of the associated context<br>
The presentation clearly differentiates between the bulk text, the structure in which the<br>
text resides, and parameterized elements. The editor effectively manipulates what is<br>
meta control information rn a way that displays it as information.<br>

filtering option for at least one block of the hierarchically structured data comprising at<br>
least one non-parametric element and one parametric element, associating a display<br>
characteristic with each the filtering option, displaying the hierarchically structured data<br>
identified using the display characteristic. <br>
The second process provides a method to systematically transform the control<br>
information into a machine-understandable format.<br>
According to -another preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
In order to facilitate the coding process for template programmers, a new<br>
hierarchical structured control information editor (hereafter referred to as "template<br>
editor") has been created. This template editor uses an editor to display the hierarchical<br>
structure and the parameterized code.<br>
 The main purpose of the hierarchical structured control Information editor is to<br>
allow the programmer to create and edit generation templates in a form visually close<br>
to the generation output, so that it is immediately evident what output will be generated <br>
for any given input to the generator. In order to make this possible, the template editor<br>
provides a graphical context editor (see FIG. 2) where the programmer can type text<br>
(24). insert context variables (25) or insert context blocks (23). The difference between<br>
the user-entered text and the various kinds of context variables (25) or context blocks<br>
(23) Is shown by various visual effects like text/background color, cursor/text behavior,<br>
and so on (see the Context Presentation Rules 31 of FIG. 1). The context variables<br>
(25) cannot be modified. They are read-only strings. The only actions possible on the<br>
context variables strings is to replace or delete them.<br>
Figure 1 shows a Unified Modeling Language (UML) model of the editor"s<br>
 implementation. The principle classes are Context Block 23, Context Variable 25, and<br>
Text String 24. The following text will describe their role in relation to both Graphical<br>
User Interface (GUI) editing and script language translating.<br>
Text strings 24 represent static data (i.e. a set of characters) in a context block<br>
23. Depending on the context block, the text"s appearance will vary. In addition, each<br>
character has its own set of edit routines. These routines are executed when the<br>
programmer attempts to change that character. Each character of the text string 24 will<br>
also have its own set of behavioral properties. Since the character"s behavioral<br>
properties tend to repeat themselves over runs of many continuous characters, a<br>
sparse representation Is used in order to save computer memory.<br>
A context variable 25 is linked to a model object by its context block 23 and can<br>
therefore represent the various characteristics of that object. In the template editor 20,<br>
each character of a Context Variable 25 has the same structure as that of a Text String<br>
24. The template editor 20 maintains the integrity of the context variables 25 by not<br>
permitting the representation to be edited.<br>
A context block 23 contains text strings 24, and/or context variables 25, and/or<br>
other nested context blocks 23. The role of a context block 23 is to repeatedly or<br>
conditionally produce its contents according to the conditions set upon it. For context<br>
blocks 23 that need to be repeated, the programmer has to provide the selection<br>
criteria (i.e. condition and filter variables) necessary to determine the number of<br>
repetitions. The programmer controls the sequencing of the context block 23 for each<br>
repetition through the use of criterias.<br>
When filter or condition criteria have been provided for a context block 23, the<br>
block will not be generated unless the requirements of its criteria are filled. The context<br>
block 23 will be instantiated for every object matching the selection criteria.<br>
Context blocks 23 have three formats: conditional (33), constant (23) and<br>
repetitive (32). A conditional context block(33) will be generated uniquely for each<br>
object that is captured by its filter (i.e. criteria). A constant context block(23) is like a<br>
conditional context block(33) having its conditions always true. Repetitive context<br>
blocks(32),r however, will generate repeatedly in the object for each item captured by<br>
the context block conditions (every target role in a class, for example). Repetitive<br>
Context Blocks (32) are also capable of inserting user defined delimiter text in between<br>
each repetition of the block, such as inserting a comma followed by a space.<br>
In the actual implementation developed in an Object Oriented language, the text<br>
(24) is composed of a String object and an Array object with the same size as the<br>
String. The Array object of the text represents the text"s Behavioral Property. For each<br>
character in the String object, there is an object at the corresponding Array position<br>
which contains the information for the graphical representation of the character such as<br>
color, font size, bold or italic properties. This Behavioral Property also stores the<br>
character"s type, be it Context Variable or Text String 24. These characteristics<br>
comprise the Behavioral Property, and links the text on the screen to the objects in the<br>
template editor class diagram.<br>
The translation of the generation template entered in the template editor into a<br>
script language format is now explained. As shown in the class diagram (Fig. 1), the<br>
generation template is a sequence of Context Blocks 23. A context block contains a<br>
sequence of Text strings 24, Context Variables 25, and Context Blocks 23.<br>
The Text String 24 represents static text which is represented as is in the script<br>
language format.<br>
The Context Variable is placed in the script language format at the position<br>
where it is displayed graphically the value for the variable. This is shown in the script<br>
language format by a number proceed with "%" (ex: %001). The value of ths Context<br>
Variable depends on the context where it is used.<br>
When translating to a script language format, a Context Block is written in the<br>
script language format "depending on a set of criteria. In the case of repetitive context<br>
blocks, the script language format is written to represent the block"s repetition.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
. An example will now be described to better illustrate a preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The example will show how to define a context hierarchy (see<br>
Fig. 1) and some presentation rules for each level of the hierarchy (see Table 1), use<br>
the control information data as defined in Table 2, define a template representing a<br>
Java method (FIG. 2). generate a template and obtaining a script (FIG. 3), execute this<br>
script using the system of published PCT patent application number WO 00/22517<br>
entitled "Source Code Template Generator Associated with Component Development"<br>
to obtain the Java source code (FIG. 4).<br>
The following Context Hierarchy describes the possible contexts used in Tables<br>
2 and 3 and FIG."s. 2, 3, 4. All objects used in the example belong to one of the levels<br>
of the hierarchy, and acquire the context properties associated with that level.<br>
The following table defines each context. For each context, it also defines the<br>
possible context variables, sub-contexts, and properties available to the object This<br>
definition allows the Template Editor (20) to display sub-menus, font and colors of the<br>
different Context Blocks (23).<br><br>
A template In the hierarchical structured control information editor is shown in<br>
FIG. 2. The example is instantiated on a per-class basis.<br>
The relation between the class diagram and the example is shown. One<br>
instance of the Generation Template corresponds to this template. This instance<br>
contains a Context Block which refers to a class Context. This Context Block contains:<br>
FIG. 2 will be more readily understood using the following notes:<br>
34. These blocks are instantiated on a per-class basis. All of the control<br>
information (bulk text, context variables or subordinate blocks) is instantiated<br>
once per class.<br>
35. These are context variables. In their uninstantiated form, they appear as the<br>
name of the property within "".<br>
36. This block is instantiated on a per-attribute basis. Since the containing block<br>
is instantiated on a per-class basis, this block can be repeated an arbitrary<br>
number of times in each class instantiation. Effectively this number can be any<br>
number greater or equal to zero. (If there are zero attributes in the class then<br>
this block is skipped).<br>
37. These context variables are instantiated once per attribute per class.<br>
The scripting code of FIG. 3 is generated by passing the control data<br>
described in Table 2 into the template displayed in FIG. 2.<br>
The template creation process occurs as follows (with reference to FIG. 2<br>
and FIG. 3):<br>
The instance of the Generation Template indicated the information<br>
known. This known information amounts to an introduction to the template. It<br>
provides the template name, the filter (in this case, the filter is "all classes") and<br>
the template characteristics (in this case, the template creates a Java operation)<br>
templateName^ IsetPropObjectData! definedAs^ ( Sclass )<br>
generate^ (<br>
operationv public^ instance^ (IsetPropObjectData!)<br>
definedAs^ (<br>
The scripting responsibility is then passed to the class Context Block of<br>
the template. In the script context, the Context Block is embedded in the<br>
following format:<br>
(! <block contents> !)<br>
Therefore, the block writes the script for its introduction :<br>
(!<br>
After this, the responsibility is passed to each of its children. The first<br>
child is a Text String. A Text String is generated as it appears in the script, and<br>
therefore the first Text String will write itself as:<br>
/**<br>
* Take Properties result set received from database, and populate<br>
*<br>
The next element is a Context Variable. In the script language, as<br>
explained previously, the Context Variable must write a reference to the object<br>
In the script, the parameters are referenced according to the order of<br>
appearance of the Context Variables. This order is determined by the Context<br>
Block which registers its list of Context Variables and orders them by attributing<br>
a number to each variable.<br>
In this case, we have the Context Variable for a Class name. The<br>
Context Variable performs a call to its Context Block to request its order of<br>
appearance.<br>
As it is the first Context Variable, the variable obtains its order and writes:<br>
%001<br>
This process will repeat similarly for all the elements of the block,<br>
resulting in the following script text:<br>
"s Data fields.<br>
* @param resultSet The data used in populating the %001"s Data fields<br>
*/<br>
public void setPropObjectData Gava.util.Properties resultSet) {<br>
The responsibility will be given to the Context Block, which understands<br>
that it must terminate itself with an exclamation mark (!). If the block is not<br>
repetitive and contains at least one context variable, it will write:<br>
! with^<br>
If it had been a Repetitive Context Block (as is the case for the attributes), it<br>
would have written :<br>
repeatForEach^ attributeOrTargetRoleFilterExpression^ Sattribute<br>
In this case there was no filter, but if the attribute had been private, we would<br>
have written "private" after &amp;attribute.<br>
Next, the Context Block requests that each Context Variable to write its<br>
initialization Behavioral Property. The block therefore writes:<br>
(<br>
and then each Context Variable takes its turn to write itself. The Class name<br>
Context Variable writes:<br>
&amp;class name^<br>
As the first block has no other Context Variables, the block closes the<br>
parentheses for the parameters and then the context block closes the<br>
parentheses for itself:<br>
The generation of the script continues iteratively for the additional block<br>
belonging to the current generation template until the template has fully been<br>
generated in the script language.<br>
In FIG. 3, the bold text is derived directly from the text found in the<br>
template of FIG. 2. The underlined text is related to the context variables and<br>
the other text is structural code related to the scripting language.<br>
The following points should be noted:<br>
75. The main block is instantiated on a per-class basis. All the control<br>
information — bulk text, context variables or subordinate blocks are instantiated<br>
once per class.<br>
The context variables 76 and 77 are replaced once per class<br>
76. The position to receive the replaced context variables<br>
77. The instructions that drive the context variable replacement<br>
78. This block is instantiated on a per-attribute basis. Since the containing block<br>
is instantiated on a per-class basis, this block can be repeated an arbitrary<br>
number of times in each class instantiation. Effectively this number can be any<br>
number greater or equal to zero. (If there are zero attributes in the class then<br>
this block is skipped).<br>
The context variables 79 and 80 are instantiated once per attribute per class.<br>
79. The position to receive the replaced context variables<br>
80. The instructions that drives the context variable replacement<br>
FIG. 4 contains the generated code in the target language, (in this case,<br>
Java). This code is only one instance of the code that could be generated from<br>
the template shown in FIG. 2. The user interface" shown in FIG. 2 implicitly<br>
manages all possibles instances.<br>
The following should be noted:<br>
81. Sections of code generated on a per class basis.<br>
82. Context Variable <class name> replaced by "cityinfo"<br>
83. Context Variables replaced by data from the instance; refer to Table 2 and<br>
FIG. 2 to see how the replacement was made.<br>

The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be<br>
described using the block diagram of FIG. 5 and the flow charts of FIG. 6 and<br>
FIG. 7<br>
FIG. 5 is a block diagram of the system for hierarchically structured data<br>
and the system for generating code generator script data. Editor 120 is used to<br>
enter and modify the template. The editor uses the context definer 121 to<br>
introduce context variables and parametric elements. In turn, the context definer<br>
121 uses the hierarchy information definer 122 to obtain information concerning<br>
the context of the template. This context can be obtained from a UML modeling<br>
tool for example. The editor 120 also uses a filter definer 123 to define filter<br>
options for the generation of source code. The context definer 121 also<br>
communicates with the context identifier 125 to assign a display characteristic<br>
124 to each context variable. Finally, the editor 120 sends the template to the<br>
display 126 for display. The display 126 uses the display characteristics 124 to<br>
display each parametric and non-parametric elements of the template.<br>
Optionally, the system also has a code generator script generator 127 which<br>
uses the template of the editor 120, the filter definer options 123 and the context<br>
parameters of the context definer 121 to generate code generator script data.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flow chart of the steps that occur in a method according to a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention. Hierarchy information is<br>
specified 130. A template is edited 131. Context parameters are specified 132.<br>
Filtering options are also specified 133. Display characteristics are associated<br>
with context parameters 134. Finally, the data is displayed to the user 135.<br>
FIG. 7 is a flow chart of another method according to a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Hierarchy information is specified 140. A<br>
template is edited 141. Context parameters are specified 142. Filtering options<br>
are also specified 143. Code generator script data is then generated 145 using<br>
the template, the context parameters and the filtering options.<br>
Although the code generator script data is understood, from the preferred<br>
embodiment, to be a single file which comprises all relevant information for the<br>
code generator and which enables the code generator to produce source code<br>
in a target language, it will be understood that the code generator script data<br>
could comprise more than one data file which, when used by the code<br>
generator, enable it to produce source code in a target language. For enable,<br>
the code generator script data could comprise a first file which is context-<br>
independent and contains the methods and classes to be generated and a<br>
second file which could contain the context-dependent information such as the<br>
details on the model. The code generator script data could also only comprise<br>
context-independent data and the code generator would rely on another source<br>
to provide context-dependent information.<br>
A specific example in which screen shots of a user interface created<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be<br>
shown.<br>
FIG. 8 shows the new operation signature tool 38. A template name 40<br>
has to be given together with the visibility of the operation 41, the inheritance 43<br>
and whether the operation is static 42. The return type has to be defined by its<br>
class name 44 and its package 45. The name of the operation is typed at 46.<br>
When the information is completed, the OK 39 button is pressed.<br>
FIG. 9 shows the Template Editor 50 with the signature 52 for the<br>
operation just created. This text cannot be modified directly since it is managed<br>
by the organizer. In order to make modifications, the string of the signature can<br>
be double-clicked and the Operation Signature tool will reappear. To show that<br>
this text is created from the signature tool, it appears with a different visual<br>
aspect. In the FIG"s, the color of the font and the color of the background are in<br>
shades of gray since the drawings are in black and white. However, any visual<br>
characteristic could be used to enhance the difference in nature of the text<br>
appearing in the template. For example, the signature could appear with a blue<br>
background meaning that only double-clicking will allow the programmer to<br>
change what is comprised in that string. The space 53 is available for coding<br>
the operation. It is represented by a differently colored background to show that<br>
it can be filled in by the programmer. If, for example, a programmer is visually<br>
impaired, the visual effects on the screen could be replaced by sounds. In fact,<br>
as long as there is an indication that some parts of the code have different<br>
characteristics, anything could be used. A class filter 51 is specified to<br>
determine which component or components this graphical generation template<br>
will be generated for. (these steps are not shown in the figures).<br>
FIG. 10 shows the creation of a comment 58 within the operation. As can<br>
be seen, a context variable 59, such as the attribute name 60, can be added to<br>
the comment. FIG. 11 shows the completion of the comment 65 and some<br>
target source code as typed by the programmer. As shown in FIG. 12, by using<br>
the process described in FIG. 10, a context variable, "attribute name", was<br>
added to the code 71 of the instruction.<br>
FIG. 13 illustrates the creation of the single name operation. Again, the<br>
signature 95 is represented with a different background color. There is a<br>
comment 96 and the operation is coded at 97. If a part of the code of the<br>
operation needs to be repeated for some or all attributes of a component, it is<br>
possible to enter the attribute level 98 and create a loop. FIG 14 shows , using a<br>
different background color 103 for the looped part of the code, a line of code<br>
104 that will be repeated for some attributes. Again, it is possible to insert a<br>
context variable 109 at the attribute level, such as, for example the attribute<br>
name 110. Finally, a template is fully created in FIG. 16. If this template were<br>
saved, a code generator, such as the one in the previously mentioned PCT<br>
publication WO 00/22517, would use the template and a model declaration to<br>
create source code.<br>
This invention could be used in different environments, some of which<br>
will be described herewith.<br>
One usage of this invention would be for hiding scripting language from<br>
the developer by creating the lines of codes of a template in order to generate<br>
code with a generation tool such as the one described in the commonly<br>
assigned and co-pending PCT patent application published under number<br>
WO 00/22517 and entitled "Source Code Template Generator Associated with<br>
Component Development". In that case, the template is used to generate near-<br>
repetitive and repetitive source code for components meeting the selection<br>
criteria of the generation template and found in the modeling tool or in the<br>
integrated development environment.<br>
When typing a context block which will be used for all classes of a<br>
system, the programmer only needs to type the method as he would like it to be<br>
when generated. Instead of writing the name of the class, he can right-mouse-<br>
click on the context editor at the point where he would like to write the class<br>
name and select from a list of all possible context variables, what he would like<br>
to appear. In this case, he would choose "<class name>". Referring to the<br>
example covered in the prior art section , the new line of code would be:<br>
"persistenceSchema = new PersistenceSchema("<class name>");"<br>
The context variable "<class name>" was introduced automatically by the<br>
editor once chosen in the menu appearing after the right-mouse-click.<br>
When some context block have to be repeated more than once within the<br>
same algorithm, a loop has to be created using the filter variables which<br>
determine the selection criteria for items participating in the loop like, for<br>
example, components, components subclass, superclass, or attribute<br>
properties. In the previous example, the programmer had to define the<br>
instructions for this loop in order to cover all attributes. In the new template<br>
editor, block context that will be so closely related for all attributes are identified<br>
by a visual characteristic.<br>
For example, the context block can be identified with a different<br>
background color. Then, the lines of code are typed in naturally, with context<br>
variables introduced by way of the right-mouse click. Since the editor knows that<br>
these lines will be reproduced for all attributes, the selection of context variables<br>
from the menu at the right-mouse-click will differ from the previous menu. These<br>
context variables will not all belong to the same categories of context variables,<br>
for example, the context variable "<class name>" will be available inside a<br>
repetitive context block that iterates at the attribute level of the current<br>
component or inside an inner context block that iterates on a given external<br>
property name associated to the current attribute of the current class found in<br>
the dynamic context of the generator. It is so because the generator will ask the<br>
outer level recursively up to the proper level to get the property value. Loops are<br>
always identified by a visual characteristic , which enhances this programming<br>
aspect. It is important to note that even when coding at the attribute level, it is<br>
possible to insert context variables that refer to the class, for example. This<br>
allows greater flexibility since the programmer can code all operations<br>
necessary at the attribute level using all context variables.<br>
In another environment, the editor could be used for a library of lines of<br>
re-use code. For example, the templates can be used to create a personal or a<br>
networked library of available lines of code for re-use. In that case, since the<br>
templates are already parameterized, the programmer does not need to modify<br>
anything inside the lines of code in order to use them with his or her project.<br>
This approach saves a good amount of work for the programmer.<br>
Another example of how these templates could be used is web-oriented.<br>
Until now, the HTML developers had to code web pages using pointers or<br>
tokens to the correct information. They would introduce the HTML codes that<br>
manage the presentation of the pages and include codes to access the proper<br>
information in the server"s databases. Again, the template editor, inserted within<br>
his web page editing tool, would allow this programmer to create all visual<br>
aspects of the web page without worrying about the codes needed to access<br>
the data from the databases. The programmer could code the web page using<br>
traditional HTML language and add context variables reflecting the description<br>
of the information needed from the database when there is a need for<br>
generating code specific to a particular page. For example, when creating<br>
pages to give customers access to their account balance, a programmer could<br>
create one HTML template using the template editor and use a parameterized<br>
component such as occount balance&gt; for the actual balance. When generating<br>
this code, the generator would replace the account balance with the right<br>
amount for all customers independently. The web pages would then appear to<br>
be exactly the same to the viewer except for the account balance with minimal<br>
programming on the programmer"s side. The present invention would provide a<br>
graphical user interface that could be used in this environment without<br>
modifying the essence of the invention.<br>
In the same manner, an improved version of the template editor would<br>
allow the programmer derive templates from the source code. The programmer<br>
would not need to write code with parameterized syntax. He would store his<br>
source code in a file. When realizing that this code could be reused, he could<br>
specify to the generation in which occasion this code was used, with which<br>
components, within which framework. The generator, knowing the relationships<br>
between all the components and the elements of the system then modeled,<br>
could extract information on how the code was developed. Knowing what are<br>
the names of the classes and the attributes from the model and recognizing<br>
almost-repetitive blocks of code, the editor could transform the original file into a<br>
parameterized source code for the template which could be either displayed to<br>
the programmer for approval or automatically generated and saved. The<br>
generator could then use this code and produce the generated code for the new<br>
application. The programmer would not need to write actual parameterized<br>
code.<br>
Also, the template editor embedded in a word processor application,<br>
could be used to produce templates in order to generate text files such as<br>
parameterized mailing lists with tokens for the name, the address and the<br>
account representative for a client.<br>
In fact, the template editor can be used to generate almost anything as<br>
long as the information on what it has to generate is available. An EXtensibe<br>
Markup Language (XML) template editor could be used. XML protocol could be<br>
used by the template editor to extract the information on what it has to generate.<br>
XML Document Type Definition (dtd) could be used to define the meta-data<br>
used by the template editor as context variable and the XML dtd tree structure<br>
definition could be used to know the different level of the parameterized source<br>
text (i.e. used to define the proper filter variable at each nested level of a XML<br>
document that is compatible.) Instead of a model declaration built using a<br>
modeling tool, a data time definition (dtd) file written in XML could be used. In<br>
that case, the XML dtd would replace the model declaration necessary for the<br>
generation of code since it describes the data to be treated. If two files are using<br>
the same dtd file, their data files can be exchanged because the organization of<br>
this data will be the same and the template editor will have the same behavior<br>
because of it.<br>
While the invention has been described with particular reference to the<br>
illustrated embodiment, it will be understood that numerous modifications<br>
thereto will appear to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, the above description<br>
and accompanying drawings should be taken as illustrative of the invention and<br>
not in a limiting sense.<br>
