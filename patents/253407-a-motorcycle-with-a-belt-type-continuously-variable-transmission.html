BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a motorcycle comprising a belt<br>
type continuously variable transmission.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Up to now, known has been a motorcycle comprising a belt<br>
type continuously variable transmission (refer to<br>
JP-B-61-40864 and JP-B-6-57547 mentioned below, for example) .<br>
A belt type continuously variable transmission<br>
comprises a primary sheave, a secondary sheave and a V-belt<br>
wound around the primary sheave and the secondary sheave. The<br>
belt type continuously variable transmission generates heat<br>
to rise in temperature due to friction and such between the<br>
V-belt and the respective sheaves in operation of the belt type<br>
continuously variable transmission. Accordingly, it is<br>
preferable to provide an intake path to supply the belt type<br>
continuously variable transmission with air for cooling<br>
through the intake path.<br>
In JP-B-61-40864, disclosed is a power unit comprising<br>
a two cycle type engine, a belt type continuously variable<br>
transmission and an intake path provided at a position lower<br>
than an upper end of a crank case of the engine for cooling<br>
the transmission.  In JP-B-6-57547, disclosed is a power unit<br>
1<br><br>
comprising a two cycle type engine, a belt type continuously<br>
variable transmission and an intake path extending to a<br>
position higher than a crank case of the engine for cooling<br>
the transmission.<br>
As a kind of motorcycle, known has been a so-called<br>
off-road vehicle capable of running on a bad road. Mounting<br>
a belt type continuously variable transmission is also<br>
convenient for a rider even in the case of an off-road vehicle<br>
since the belt type continuously variable transmission allows<br>
a troublesome clutch operation to be made unnecessary.<br>
In applying structures disclosed in JP-B-61-40864 and<br>
JP-B-6-57547 to an off-road vehicle, however, there are<br>
problems described below. Accordingly, a belt type<br>
continuously variable transmission including an intake path<br>
for cooling has not been applied to an off-road vehicle up to<br>
now.<br>
That is to say, in the case of providing an intake path<br>
at a position lower than an upper end of a crank case like the<br>
structure disclosed in JP-B-61-40864, water and dust rose from<br>
the ground easily enter into the intake path. Therefore, it<br>
is not preferable to apply the structure disclosed in<br>
JP-B-61-40864 without any device in an off-road vehicle often<br>
running on an unpaved road and the like.<br>
Further, in an off-road vehicle, a cylinder of an engine<br>
rises up and an angle between the cylinder and a horizontal<br>
2<br><br>
line is large. Moreover, in an off-road vehicle, a distance<br>
between a power unit and the ground, namely, the minimum height<br>
from the ground should be comparatively greatly secured. This<br>
causes a cylinder and an exhaust pipe to be provided<br>
collectively above the crank case of the engine. Accordingly,<br>
the exhaust pipe or the cylinder is obstructive in extending<br>
the intake path to a position higher than the crank case like<br>
the structure disclosed in JP-B-6-57547.<br>
As described above, it has been difficult to mount a belt<br>
type continuously variable transmission including a<br>
preferable intake path to an off-road vehicle or a motorcycle<br>
in the form equal to an off-road vehicle by simply applying<br>
a conventional technology as it is.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of the above, an object of the invention is to<br>
provide an off-road vehicle or a motorcycle equal to an off-road<br>
vehicle in which a belt type continuously variable<br>
transmission including a preferable intake path is mounted.<br>
A motorcycle in accordance with the invention is a<br>
motorcycle comprising: a four stroke type engine including a<br>
crank case and a cylinder extending upward or obliquely upward<br>
to the front side from the crank case; a belt type continuously<br>
variable transmission provided on one end of the crank case<br>
in a vehicle width direction; a transmission case covering at<br>
3<br><br>
least a part of the belt type continuously variable<br>
transmission and having a belt chamber formed inside thereof<br>
for housing the belt type continuously variable transmission;<br>
and an intake path, at least a part thereof extending upward<br>
or obliquely upward to the front side from a part of the<br>
transmission case, the latter part being in front of a rear<br>
end of the cylinder in side view, for leading air to the belt<br>
chamber.<br>
Another motorcycle in accordance with the invention is<br>
a motorcycle comprising: a four cycle type engine including<br>
a crank case and a cylinder extending upward from the crank<br>
case; a belt type continuously variable transmission provided<br>
on one end of the crank case in a vehicle width direction; a<br>
transmission case covering at least a part of the belt type<br>
continuously variable transmission and having a belt chamber<br>
formed inside thereof for housing the belt type continuously<br>
variable transmission; an intake path extending upward from<br>
the transmission case in side view for leading air to the belt<br>
chamber; and an exhaust pipe connected to the cylinder and<br>
crossing with the intake path above the transmission case in<br>
side view.<br>
In accordance with the invention, it is possible to<br>
provide in practice an off-road vehicle or a motorcycle equal<br>
to an off-road vehicle in which a belt type continuously<br>
variable transmission including a preferable intake path is<br>
4<br><br>
mounted.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The inventor of the application has found, as a result<br>
of diligent study, that applying a four cycle type engine<br>
5<br><br>
instead of a two cycle type engine allows an exhaust pipe to<br>
be thinned and that extending an intake path for cooling of<br>
a belt type continuously variable transmission upward from a<br>
transmission case allows the intake path to be compactly<br>
provided in a surplus space, which is created above the crank<br>
case by thinning the exhaust pipe, and thus, has conceived the<br>
invention.  Embodiments of the invention will be described<br>
hereinafter.<br><embodiment><br>&gt;<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 to 3, in a motorcycle 1 in accordance<br>
with Embodiment 1, an intake path 70 for cooling in a belt type<br>
continuously variable transmission 17 extends on an outer side<br>
of an exhaust pipe 41 in a vehicle width direction to the upper<br>
side.<br>&gt;<br>
The motorcycle 1 in Embodiment l is a so-called off-road<br>
type motorcycle. The motorcycle 1 comprises a body frame 2,<br>
a fuel tank 24 supported on the body frame 2 and a seat 3<br>
supported on the body frame 2 and provided behind the fuel tank<br>
24. In the specification, back-and-forth and lateral<br>
directions mean directions in view of a rider sitting on the<br>
seat 3.<br>
Further, "extending to the upper side" means a case of<br>
extending upward as a whole in the specification.  It is not<br>
6<br><br>
limited to a case of extending vertically but includes a case<br>
of extending obliquely upward. Similarly, a meaning of<br>
"rearward" is not limited to a direction to the rear side along<br>
a strictly back-and-forth direction but includes a direction<br>
to the rear side along a direction inclining perpendicularly<br>
or laterally to the back-and-forth direction. That is to say,<br>
the "rearward" in the specification includes a so-called<br>
obliquely rear side.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the body frame 2 includes a head pipe<br>
4, a down tube 5 extending downward from the head pipe 4, a<br>
main tube 6 extending rearward from the head pipe 4 above the<br>
down tube 5. A pair of right and left seat pillars 6a is divided<br>
downward from a middle part of the main tube 6. A seat rail<br>
7 extending rearward is connected to the seat pillar 6a. A<br>
middle part of the seat rail 7 is connected to a rear end of<br>
a backstay 8. A front end of the backstay 8 is connected to<br>
a lower end of the seat pillar 6a.<br>
A front fork 11 is inserted into the head pipe 4 as shown<br>
in Fig. 1. On a lower end of the front fork 11, supported is<br>
a front wheel 12. A pivot shaft 10 is inserted into the body<br>
frame 2. On the pivot shaft 10, supported is a front end of<br>
a rear arm 9 so as to be freely swingable. A rear wheel 13<br>
is supported on a rear end of the rear arm 9.<br>
A power unit 15 is supported on the body frame 2. The<br>
power unit 15 comprises an engine 16 and a belt type<br><br>
continuously variable transmission (referred to as a CVT,<br>
hereinafter) 17 although a detail thereof is described later<br>
(refer to Fig. 6).<br>
The engine 16 comprises a crank case 20 and a cylinder<br>
21	extending upward (more particularly, obliquely upward to<br>
the front side) from the crank case 20.  The cylinder 21<br>
includes a cylinder body 21a and a cylinder head 22, as shown<br>
in Fig. 2. As described above, the so-called cylinder head<br>
22	is assumed to be included in the cylinder 21 in the<br>
specification.<br>
In the motorcycle 1 in accordance with Embodiment 1, the<br>
cylinder 21 rises from the crank case 20 and slightly inclines<br>
forward with respect to the vertical direction. In other words,<br>
the cylinder 21 greatly inclines with respect to the horizontal<br>
line. Further, as described later, the CVT 17 comprises a<br>
primary sheave shaft 23a and a secondary sheave shaft 53. A<br>
line LI connecting an axial core 23b of the primary sheave shaft<br>
23a and an axial core 53b of the secondary sheave shaft 53<br>
substantially crosses at right angles with a center line L2<br>
of the cylinder 21 in side view. In Embodiment 1, the axial<br>
core 53b of the secondary sheave shaft 53 is provided at a<br>
position higher than the axial core 23b of the primary sheave<br>
shaft 23a.<br>
On the rear side of the cylinder 21, connected is an<br>
intake pipe 40.  The intake pipe 40 is provided with a<br>
8<br><br>
carburetor 40a. A rear end of the intake pipe 40 is connected<br>
to an air chamber 43 . The air chamber 43 is omitted from drawing<br>
in Fig. 1.<br>
An exhaust pipe 41 is connected on the front side of the<br>
cylinder 21. The exhaust pipe 41 projects forward from the<br>
cylinder 21 to curve or bend toward the rear side and extends<br>
above the transmission case 36 or the crank case 20 to the rear<br>
side (refer to Fig. 3, too). In side view, the exhaust pipe<br>
41 crosses with the later-described intake path 70 above the<br>
transmission case 36. As shown in Fig. 1, a rear end of the<br>
exhaust pipe 41 is connected to a muffler 42.<br>
Inside the transmission case 36, formed is a belt chamber<br>
38 housing the CVT 17 although that is described in detail later<br>
(refer to Fig. 6). As shown in Fig. 1, in front of a center<br>
place of the transmission case 36 in the back-and-f orth<br>
direction, connected is the intake path 70 for supplying the<br>
belt chamber 38 with air for cooling. In detail, the intake<br>
path 70 extends obliquely upward to the front side from a part<br>
of the transmission case 36, the part located in front of a<br>
rear end 21e of the cylinder 21, in side view. In Embodiment<br>
1, the intake path 70 comprises an intake duct 71 extending<br>
obliquely upward to the front side from the transmission case<br>
36 and an air box 96 connected to an upper end of the intake<br>
duct 71. The air box 96, however, is not necessarily provided.<br>
The intake path 70 may be formed only from the intake duct 71.<br>
9<br><br>
The air box 96 and the intake duct 71 may be formed into one<br>
body or separate bodies.<br>
The air box 96 is an air path forming member whose<br>
appearance is formed into the shape of a box. In the intake<br>
path 70 for cooling in the CVT 17, substantially no pulse of<br>
air is generated differently from the intake pipe 40 of the<br>
engine 16. Accordingly, the air box 96 may be not necessarily<br>
a so-called air chamber for temporarily storing air. The air<br>
box 96 may be one with a meander flow channel formed inside<br>
thereof, for example. The air box 96 may be an air chamber,<br>
of course.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, an air filter 95 is formed inside<br>
the air box 96. An intake pipe 96a is connected on an upper<br>
and rear side of the air box 96. An intake opening 96b opening<br>
rearward is formed in the intake pipe 96a.<br>
On sides of the fuel tank 24, provided is a pair of right<br>
and left covers 14 formed so as to widen in the vehicle direction<br>
toward the front side, as shown in Fig. 5. The air box 96 is<br>
provided on the inner side of the cover 14, as shown in Fig.<br>
1. The intake pipe 96a of the air box 96 is also provided on<br>
the inner side of the cover 14. In other words, the air box<br>
96 (including the intake pipe 96a) is covered with the cover<br>
14 in side view. The intake path 70 extends to the inner side<br>
of the cover 14 and a part of the intake pipe 70 is provided<br>
on the inner side of the cover 14, as described above.<br>
10<br><br>
In Embodiment 1, the exhaust pipe 41 and the intake duct<br>
71 are provided on the right side of the cylinder 21, as shown<br>
in Fig. 3. The intake duct 71 is adjacent to the cylinder 21<br>
in the vehicle width direction. In other words, the intake<br>
duct 71 and the cylinder 21 are overlapped in side view (refer<br>
to Fig. 1) . The exhaust pipe 41 extends rearward between the<br>
cylinder 21 and the intake duct 71.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, a rear cushion unit 30 is provided<br>
at the center part in the vehicle width direction. The rear<br>
cushion unit 30 is provided between the main tube 6 and the<br>
rear arm 9 to connect the main tube 6 and the rear arm 9, as<br>
shown in Fig. 2. The motorcycle 1 in accordance with<br>
Embodiment 1 includes only one rear cushion unit 30 and has<br>
a so-called mono-suspension structure. The rear cushion unit<br>
30 is not limited to one directly connected to the rear arm<br>
9 but may be one connected to the rear arm 9 through a link.<br>
Behind the rear cushion unit 30 and on the right side<br>
of the air chamber 43, provided is a battery 50 as shown in<br>
Fig. 3. The battery 50 is provided under the seat 3 (refer<br>
to Fig. 1) . As shown in Fig. 3, the air chamber 43 is connected<br>
to the intake pipe 43a opening rightward. A numeral 80 denotes<br>
a footstep.<br>
«Inner Structure of Power Unit»<br>
Now, described will be an inner structure of the power<br>
unit 15, made reference to Figs. 6 to 8.<br>
11<br><br>
Fig. 6 shows a cross section of the power unit 15. As<br>
shown in Fig. 5, the power unit 15 comprises the engine 16,<br>
the CVT 17, a centrifugal clutch 18 and a reduction mechanism<br>
19. The engine 16 is a four cycle type engine repeating a cycle<br>
formed from an intake process, a compression process, a<br>
combustion process and an exhaust process. In Embodiment 1,<br>
the engine 16 is a four cycle single cylinder engine.<br>
The engine 16 comprises the crank case 20, the cylinder<br>
body 21a connected to the crank case 20 and the cylinder head<br>
22 connected on the upper side of the cylinder body 21a. The<br>
cylinder body 21a and the cylinder head 22 form the cylinder<br>
21, as described before. The crank case 20 includes two<br>
divided case blocks, namely, a first case block 20a located<br>
on the left side and a second case block 20b located on the<br>
right side. The first case block 20a and the second case block<br>
20b are faced to each other along the vehicle width direction.<br>
In the crank case 20, housed is a crank shaft 23. The<br>
crank shaft 23 extends in the vehicle width direction and is<br>
provided horizontally. The crank shaft 23 is supported on the<br>
first case block 20a through a bearing 24a and on the second<br>
case block 20b through the bearing 24b.<br>
A piston 25 is slidably inserted into the cylinder 21.<br>
One end of a connecting rod 26 is connected to the piston 25.<br>
A crank pin 28 is provided between a left crank arm 27a and<br>
a right crank arm 27b of the crank shaft 23.  The other end<br>
12<br><br>
of the connecting rod 26 is connected to the crank pin 28.<br>
In the cylinder head 22, formed are a concave 22a and<br>
an intake port and an exhaust port, which are not shown and<br>
communicate with the concave 22a. An ignition plug 29 is<br>
inserted into the cylinder head 22. The intake port is<br>
connected to the above-mentioned intake pipe 40 (refer to Fig.<br>
1) . The exhaust port is connected to the exhaust pipe 41 (refer<br>
to Fig. 1).<br>
A generator case 35 for housing a generator 34 is mounted<br>
to the left side of a front half of the first case block 20a.<br>
A transmission case 36 for housing the CVT 17 is mounted to<br>
the right side of the second case block 20b. Further, on the<br>
right side of a rear half of the second case block 20b, formed<br>
is an opening, which is covered with a clutch cover 37.<br>
The transmission case 36 is formed independently from<br>
the crank case 20. The transmission case 36 is formed from<br>
an inner case 36a covering the inner side (the left side) of<br>
the CVT 17 in the vehicle width direction and an outer case<br>
36b covering the outer side (the right side) of the CVT 17 in<br>
the vehicle width direction. The inner case 36a is mounted<br>
on the right side of the crank case 20. The outer case 36b<br>
is mounted on the right side of the inner case 36a. Inside<br>
the inner case 36a and the outer case 36b, formed is the belt<br>
chamber 38 housing the CVT 17. An intake opening 78 is formed<br>
on an upper surface of the outer case 36b.  The intake opening<br>
13<br><br>
78 is connected to the above-mentioned intake duct 71 (refer<br>
to Fig. 1).<br>
A right end of the crank shaft 23 passes through the<br>
second case block 20b and the inner case 36a to extend to the<br>
belt chamber 38. A primary sheave 51 of the CVT 17 is fitted<br>
in the right end of the crank shaft 23. Accordingly, the<br>
primary sheave 51 rotates in accordance with rotation of the<br>
crank shaft 23. A right part of the crank shaft 23 (strictly,<br>
a part on the right side of the bearing 24b) forms the primary<br>
sheave shaft 23a.<br>
On the other hand, a left end of the crank shaft 23 passes<br>
through the first case block 20a to extend to the inner side<br>
of the generation case 35. The generator 34 is mounted to the<br>
left end of the crank shaft 23.<br>
In a rear half of the crank case 20, the secondary sheave<br>
shaft 53 in which a secondary sheave 52 is fitted is provided<br>
parallel to the crank shaft 23. A part on the right side of<br>
a center part of the secondary sheave shaft 53 is supported<br>
on the clutch cover 37 through a bearing 54a. A part on the<br>
left side of the secondary sheave shaft 53 is supported on a<br>
left end of the second case block 20b through a bearing 54b.<br>
The secondary sheave 52 is connected to a right end of the<br>
secondary sheave shaft 53.<br>
The CVT 17 comprises a V-belt 55 wound around the primary<br>
sheave 51 and the secondary sheave 52 in addition to the primary<br>
14<br><br>
sheave 51 and the secondary sheave 52.<br>
The primary sheave 51 comprises a fixed sheave body 51a<br>
located on the outer side in the vehicle width direction and<br>
a movable sheave body 51b located on the inner side in the<br>
vehicle width direction and faced to the fixed sheave body 51a.<br>
The fixed sheave body 51a is fixed to a right part of the primary<br>
sheave shaft 23a and rotates together with the primary sheave<br>
shaft 23a. The movable sheave body 51b is provided on the left<br>
side of the fixed sheave body 51a and mounted to the primary<br>
sheave shaft 23a so as to be freely slidable. Accordingly,<br>
the movable sheave body 51b rotates together with the primary<br>
sheave shaft 23a and is freely slidable in an axial direction<br>
of the primary sheave shaft 23a. Between the fixed sheave body<br>
51a and the movable sheave body 51b, formed is a belt groove<br>
51c. A cam surface 56 is formed in a part of the left side<br>
of the movable sheave body 51b. A cam plate 57 is provided<br>
on the left side of the cam surface 56. A roller weight 58<br>
is provided between the cam surface 56 of the movable sheave<br>
body 51b and the cam plate 57.<br>
The secondary sheave 52 comprises a fixed sheave body<br>
52a located on the inner side in the vehicle width direction<br>
and a movable sheave body 52b located on the outer side in the<br>
vehicle width direction and faced to the fixed sheave body 52a.<br>
The movable sheave body 52b is fixed to a right part of the<br>
secondary sheave shaft 53.  The movable sheave body 52b rotates<br>
15<br><br>
together with the secondary sheave shaft 53 and is freely<br>
slidable in an axial direction of the secondary sheave shaft<br>
53. On the right side of the secondary sheave 52, provided<br>
is a compression coil spring 59. The movable sheave body 52b<br>
receives leftward urging force from the compression coil<br>
spring 59. An axial core part of the fixed sheave body 52a<br>
is a cylindrical slide collar spline-fitted in the secondary<br>
sheave shaft 53. Between the fixed sheave body 52a and the<br>
movable sheave body 52b, formed is a V-shaped belt groove 52c.<br>
The V-belt 55 is a so-called resin block belt comprising<br>
plural resin blocks and a connection body for connecting the<br>
resin blocks.<br>
On the right side of the fixed sheave body 51a of the<br>
primary sheave 51, formed are plural vanes 60 for ventilation.<br>
The intake opening 78 formed on the upper surface of the<br>
transmission case 36 is connected to the intake duct 71 (refer<br>
to Fig. 1) , as described above. The intake opening 78 is formed<br>
in a front half of the transmission case 36 (above the primary<br>
sheave 51). Accordingly, the intake duct 71 is connected in<br>
front of a rear end of the primary sheave 51.<br>
When the fixed sheave body 51a rotates together with the<br>
primary sheave shaft 23a in such a structure, air is led into<br>
the belt chamber 38 through the intake opening 78 by means of<br>
the vanes 60 while air in the belt chamber 38 is exhausted to<br>
the outside.  In Embodiment 1, the vane 60 is formed so as to<br>
16<br><br>
extend spirally outward in the diameter direction from the<br>
center part of the fixed sheave body 51a in side view. A<br>
concrete shape of the vane 60, however, is not limited at all.<br>
The number of the vane 60 is also not limited at all. It may<br>
be possible to provide a vaned wheel or the like, which is formed<br>
separately from the fixed sheave body 51a, on the outer side<br>
of the fixed sheave body 51a.<br>
Fig. 7 is a perspective view of the second case block<br>
20b and the inner case 36a. As shown in Fig. 7, a front half<br>
66 of the inner case 36a is formed into the shape of a bowl<br>
projecting leftward while a rear half 67 of the inner case 36a<br>
is formed into the shape of a bowl projecting rightward. In<br>
the front half 66, formed is a hole 68 into which the primary<br>
sheave shaft 23a (refer to Fig. 6) of the CVT 17 is inserted.<br>
A hole 69 into which the secondary sheave shaft 53 (refer to<br>
Fig. 6) of the CVT 17 is inserted is formed in the rear half<br>
67. In Fig. 7, omitted from drawing is the clutch cover 37<br>
(refer to Fig. 6) existing between the inner case 36a and the<br>
second case block 20b.<br>
Vents 72 are provided in the inner case 36a. In<br>
Embodiment 1, the vent 72 is formed into a circular shape. The<br>
vent 72 is three in number and provided on an upper side of<br>
a center position of the inner case 36a in the perpendicular<br>
direction. The shape and number of the vent 72, however, are<br>
not limited at all.<br>
17<br><br>
In a lower part of a right part of the second case block<br>
20b, formed are plural vents 73. In detail, the second case<br>
block 20b includes a peripheral part 74 rising up rightward.<br>
The peripheral part 74 is in the shape corresponding to a shape<br>
of an outline of the transmission case 36. A lower part of<br>
the peripheral part 74 is formed into the shape of a slit so<br>
that a part of the lower part would be notched, to form a<br>
so-called comb shape. Accordingly, a space 75 sectioned by<br>
the second case block 20b and the inner case 36a communicates<br>
with the outside of the power unit 15 (refer to Fig. 6) through<br>
the vents 73. The space 75 is formed between the clutch cover<br>
37 and the inner case 36a in a rear half of the second case<br>
block 20b since the right side of the rear half of the second<br>
case block 20b is covered with the clutch cover 37 (refer to<br>
Fig. 6).<br>
In the comb-shaped part of the peripheral part 74,<br>
provided are reinforcement ribs 76. An oil pan 77 is provided<br>
under the vents 73.<br>
In accordance with such a structure, the air in the belt<br>
chamber 38 is led to the space 75 through the vents 72 of the<br>
inner case 36a to be exhausted toward the oil pan 77 through<br>
the vents 73 of the second case block 20b. As a result, the<br>
air is exhausted to the outside of the power unit 15.<br>
Fig. 8 is an enlarged view of a part shown in Fig. 6.<br>
As shown in Fig. 8, the centrifugal clutch 18 is mounted to<br>
18<br><br>
a left part of the secondary sheave shaft 53. The centrifugal<br>
clutch 18 is a wet type multi-plate clutch and comprises a<br>
substantially cylindrical clutch housing 81 and a clutch boss<br>
82. The clutch housing 81 is spline-fitted in the secondary<br>
sheave shaft 53 to rotate in a body with the secondary sheave<br>
shaft 53. A plural number of ring-shaped clutch plates 83 are<br>
mounted to the clutch housing 81.<br>
A cylindrical gear 85 is fitted through a bearing 84 in<br>
the periphery of the left part of the secondary sheave shaft<br>
53 so as to be freely rotatable. The clutch boss 82 is provided<br>
on the inner side in the diameter direction of the clutch plate<br>
83 and on the outer side in the diameter direction of the gear<br>
85	to engage with the gear 85.  This causes the gear 85 to rotate<br>
together with the clutch boss 82. On the outer side in the<br>
diameter direction of the clutch boss 82, mounted are a plural<br>
number of ring-shaped friction plates 86.  The friction plates<br>
86	are provided in line at intervals in an axial direction of<br>
the secondary sheave shaft 53.  Each of the friction plates<br>
86 is provided between the adjacent clutch plates 83 and 83.<br>
On the left side of the clutch housing 81, formed are<br>
plural cam surfaces 87 . A roller weight 88 is provided between<br>
the cam surface 87 and the most right clutch plate 83 faced<br>
to the cam surface 87.<br>
The centrifugal clutch 18 can be automatically switched<br>
between an in-clutch state (namely, a state of connection) and<br>
19<br><br>
an off-clutch state (namely, a state of disconnection) in<br>
accordance with a size of centrifugal force operating on the<br>
roller weight 88. In Fig. 8, a part lower than the secondary<br>
sheave shaft 53 shows the in-clutch state while a part upper<br>
than the secondary sheave shaft 53 shows the out-of-clutch<br>
state.<br>
The reduction mechanism 19 is provided between the<br>
centrifugal clutch 18 and an output shaft (not shown). The<br>
reduction mechanism 19 includes a transmission shaft 89<br>
provided parallel to the secondary sheave shaft 53. The<br>
transmission shaft 89 is supported on the first case block 20a<br>
through a bearing 90 so as to be freely rotatable. The<br>
transmission shaft 89 is also supported on the second case block<br>
20b through a bearing 91 so as to be freely rotatable.  On a<br>
right end of the transmission shaft 89, provided is a first<br>
transmission gear 92 engaging with the gear 85.<br>
In a center part of the transmission shaft 89, provided<br>
is a second transmission gear 93 having a diameter smaller than<br>
that of the first transmission gear 92. The second<br>
transmission gear 93 is arranged to engage with an output shaft<br>
not shown or a gear, which is not shown and provided to the<br>
output shaft.<br>
Such a structure allows the clutch boss 82 and the output<br>
shaft to be connected through the gear 85, the first<br>
transmission gear 92, the transmission shaft 89, the second<br>
20<br><br>
transmission gear 93 and such. Accordingly, the output shaft<br>
rotates in accordance with rotation of the clutch boss 82.<br>
Around the output shaft, wound is a power transmission<br>
mechanism for transmitting driving force of the output shaft<br>
to the rear wheel 13 (refer to Fig. 1) such as a chain although<br>
this is not shown in the drawings.<br>
The structure of the power unit 15 has been described<br>
above.  Now, described will be a cooling operation of the CVT<br>
17.<br>&gt;<br>
When the power unit 15 starts operating, the primary<br>
sheave shaft 23a of the CVT 17 rotates and the vanes 60 of the<br>
fixed sheave body 51a of the primary sheave 51 rotate in<br>
accordance with the rotation of the primary sheave shaft 23a.<br>
This results in generation of sucking force, which leads air<br>
from the intake duct 71 toward the belt chamber 38.<br>
Air is then sucked into the air box 96 through the intake<br>
opening 96b (refer to Fig. 4) and passes through the filter<br>
95 to be purified. After the above, the air is sucked into<br>
the belt chamber 38 through the intake duct 71. The air sucked<br>
into the belt chamber 38 flows in the periphery of the primary<br>
sheave 51, the secondary sheave 52 and the V-belt 55 to cool<br>
the primary sheave 51, the secondary sheave 52 and the V-belt<br>
55.<br>
The air having cooled the primary sheave 51, the<br>
21<br><br>
secondary sheave 52 and the V-belt 55 is exhausted from the<br>
belt chamber 38 through the vents 72 of the inner case 36a (refer<br>
to Fig. 7) to flow into the space 75 between the inner case<br>
36a and the second case block 20b. The air in the space 75<br>
is exhausted to the outside of the power unit 15 through the<br>
vents 73 formed in the lower part of the second case block 20b.<br>
Such a flow of air causes the CVT 17 to be continuously and<br>
regularly cooled.<br>
As described above, in accordance with the motorcycle<br>
according to Embodiment 1, the four cycle type engine 16 is<br>
used while the intake path 70 extending upward from a part of<br>
the transmission case 36, the part located in front of the rear<br>
end 21e of the cylinder 21, in side view (refer to Fig. 1) is<br>
provided for the purpose of supplying the CVT 17 with air for<br>
cooling.<br>
Thus, using the four cycle type engine 16 allows the<br>
exhaust pipe 41 to be narrowed, so that a surplus space can<br>
be secured above the crank case 20. Effectively using the<br>
surplus space as a space for providing the intake path 70 allows<br>
the intake path 70 to be provided upward without any obstruction<br>
by the cylinder 21 and the exhaust pipe 41. Accordingly, water<br>
and dust rose from the ground can be effectively prevented from<br>
entering, differently from a case of providing the whole of<br>
the intake path 70 at a position lower than the upper end of<br>
22<br><br>
the crank case 20, so that the intake path 70 can be preferably<br>
provided. Thus, in accordance with the motorcycle 1 according<br>
to Embodiment 1, the CVT 17 including the preferable intake<br>
path 70 can be mounted in spite of an off-road type vehicle.<br>
Further, in accordance with the motorcycle 1 according<br>
to Embodiment 1, the four cycle type engine 16 is used while<br>
the intake path 70 extending upward from the transmission case<br>
36 in side view (refer to Fig. 1) is provided for the purpose<br>
of supplying the CVT 17 with air for cooling, and furthermore,<br>
the exhaust pipe 41 is provided so as to cross with the intake<br>
path 70 above the transmission case 36 in side view.<br>
This also allows the intake path 70 to be provided upward<br>
without any obstruction by the cylinder 21 and the exhaust pipe<br>
41, so that the above-mentioned effect can be achieved.<br>
In Embodiment 1, the intake path 70 extends upward from<br>
a part of the transmission case 36, the part in front of the<br>
rear end 21e of the cylinder 21, in side view. Such a structure<br>
is more preferable. The intake path 70, however, may extend<br>
from a part located behind the rear end 21e of the cylinder<br>
21 so long as the exhaust pipe 41 crosses with the intake path<br>
70 above the transmission case 36 in side view.<br>
Especially, the intake path 70 is arranged to be provided<br>
adjacently to the cylinder 21 in the vehicle width direction<br>
in Embodiment 1. Further, the exhaust pipe 41 is arranged to<br>
extend between the cylinder 21 and the intake path 70.  These<br>
23<br><br>
allow the cylinder 21, the exhaust pipe 41 and the intake path<br>
70 to be provided at a higher density, so that the vehicle can<br>
be miniaturized.<br>
Moreover, in accordance with Embodiment 1, a sucking part<br>
of the intake path 70, namely, the intake pipe 96a is provided<br>
on an inner side of the cover 14. Accordingly, the cover 14<br>
effectively prevents mud or the like from entering the intake<br>
path 70. Further, there is a certain degree of space on the<br>
inner side of the cover 14. Effectively using the space as<br>
a space for providing a part of the intake path 70 (mainly the<br>
air box 96, in Embodiment 1) allows the whole vehicle to be<br>
made compact.<br>
In addition, the intake opening 96b of the intake pipe<br>
96a is open rearward in accordance with Embodiment 1. This<br>
causes mud or the like to be further prevented from entering<br>
the intake path 70. Further, rainwater can be effectively<br>
prevented from entering the intake path 70 even in the case<br>
of rain. Particularly, the intake opening 96b of the intake<br>
pipe 96a is faced to the inner surface of the cover 14 in<br>
Embodiment 1. Accordingly, mud or the like can be prevented<br>
more from entering through the intake opening 96b.<br>
As described above, in accordance with Embodiment 1, the<br>
air box 96 including the air filter 95 built in is provided<br>
on the inner side of the cover 14. The air filter 95 is<br>
comparatively large component.  Putting a comparatively large<br>
24<br><br>
space on the inner side of the cover 14 to practical use like<br>
Embodiment 1, however, allows the air filter 95 to be prevented<br>
from projecting to the outside, so that the air filter 95 can<br>
be provided compactly.<br><embodiment><br>
The motorcycle 1 in accordance with Embodiment 2 is one<br>
in which the exhaust pipe 41 in Embodiment 1 is changed in<br>
location, as shown in Figs. 9 and 10. In the following<br>
description, a component similar to that of Embodiment 1 is<br>
marked with the same reference signs and numerals and a part<br>
different from Embodiment 1 is only described.<br>
As shown in Figs. 9 and 10, the exhaust pipe 41 extends<br>
rearward on the left side of the cylinder 21 in Embodiment 2.<br>
That is to say, the exhaust pipe 41 extends rearward on a side<br>
opposite to a side of the intake path 70 of the cylinder 21.<br>
The air chamber 43 is provided on the right side of the<br>
rear cushion unit 30 and the battery 50, as shown in Fig. 10.<br>
In Embodiment 2, the intake pipe 43a of the air chamber 43 opens<br>
leftward.<br>
As described above, in accordance with Embodiment 2, the<br>
intake duct 71 of the intake path 70 is provided on the right<br>
side of the cylinder 21, the exhaust pipe 41 is provided on<br>
the left side of the cylinder 21 and the intake path 70 and<br>
the exhaust pipe 41 are provided on sides opposite to each other.<br>
Accordingly, the intake path 70 can extend upward from the<br>
25<br><br>
transmission case 36 without obstruction by the exhaust pipe<br>
41, so that a preferable intake path 70 can be achieved.<br>
Moreover, the exhaust pipe 41 does not project in the vehicle<br>
width direction even in the case that the exhaust pipe 41, the<br>
cylinder 21 and the intake path 70 are in line in the vehicle<br>
width direction since the engine 16 is a four cycle type engine<br>
and the exhaust pipe 41 is thin. This allows the intake path<br>
70 for cooling in the CVT 17 to be preferably provided without<br>
increasing the size of the vehicle.<br>&gt;<br>
The invention is not limited to the above-mentioned<br>
embodiments but can be carried out in practice in other various<br>
kinds of embodiments. In the above embodiments, the<br>
motorcycle 1 is an off-road vehicle. The off-road vehicle in<br>
the above context means a motorcycle suitable for running on<br>
a bad road. The off-road vehicle, however, may be one running<br>
on a paved road, of course. Further, the motorcycle in<br>
accordance with the invention may be a motorcycle of a type<br>
equal to an off-road vehicle. For example, the motorcycle in<br>
accordance with the invention may be a motorcycle unsuitable<br>
for running on a bad road in practice although it is an off-road<br>
type motorcycle in appearance.<br>
In the above embodiments, the whole of the intake path<br>
70 extends upward from a part located in front of the rear end<br>
21e of the cylinder 21.  The embodiments, however, are only<br>
26<br><br>
examples.  It may be possible that only a part of the intake<br>
path 70 extends from a part located in front of the rear end<br>
21e of the cylinder 21. Moreover, the whole of the air box<br>
96 including the sucking part 96a is provided on the inner side<br>
of the cover 14 in the embodiments.  It may be possible, however,<br>
that a part of the air box 96 or a part of the sucking part<br>
96a is only provided on the outer side of the cover 14.<br>&gt;<br>
As mentioned above, "extending upward" in the<br>
specification means a case of extending upward as a whole. It<br>
is not limited to a case of extending vertically upward but<br>
includes a case of extending obliquely upward. Accordingly,<br>
a case of extending obliquely upward to the front side or the<br>
like corresponds to the case of "extending upward" in the<br>
specification.<br>
Furthermore, "opening rearward" is not limited to a case<br>
of opening rearward along the back-and-forth direction, namely,<br>
a case of opening rearward in the strict sense of the word.<br>
"Opening rearward" in the specification also includes a case<br>
of opening rearward along a direction inclining<br>
perpendicularly or laterally to the back-and-f orth direction,<br>
namely, a case of opening toward the so-called obliquely rear<br>
side.<br>
As mentioned above, "a cylinder" in the specification<br>
includes not only a cylindrical member into which a piston is<br>
27<br><br>
inserted, namely, a cylinder body but also a so-called cylinder<br>
head.<br>
As described above, the invention is useful for a<br>
motorcycle.<br>
