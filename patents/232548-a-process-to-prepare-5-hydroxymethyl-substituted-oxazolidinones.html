				<td>PROCESS TO PREPARE OXAZOLIDINQNES<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to processes for producing 5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinone alcohols (III). Also disclosed is a process for transformation of the 5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinone alcohols (III) to the corresponding 5-aminomethyl substituted oxazolidinone amines (VII) which are useful in the production of oxazolidinone antibacterial pharmaceuticals (VIII).<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
US Patents 5,164,510, 5,182,403 and 5,225,565 disclose 5'-indolinyloxazolidinones, 3-(5'-indazolyl)oxazolidinones, 3-(fused-ring substituted)phenyloxazolidinones respectively useful as antibacterial agents.<br>
US Patents 5,231,188 and 5,247,090 disclose various tricyclic [6.5.5] and [6.6.5]-fused ring oxazolidinones useful as antibacterial agents.<br>
International Publication WO93/09103 discloses mono- and di-halo phenyl oxazolidinone anti-bacterials which are useful as pharmaceutical agents for their anti-bacterial action.<br>
US 4,150,029, 4,250,318, 4,476,136, 4,340,606 and 4,461,773 disclose the synthesis of 5-hydroxymethyloxazolidinones from amines (R-NHX1, where Xj is -H or p-toluenesulfonyl) and R,S-glycidol (C*H2-O-C*H-CH2-OH where the carbon atoms marked  are bonded together, cyclized to form an epoxide). The mixture of enantiomers produced by this process (represented by the formula R-NH-CH2-CHOH-CH2-OH) are separated by fractional crystallization of the mandelic acid salts. The enantiomerically pure R-diol is then converted into the corresponding 5R-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinones (III) by condensation with diethylcarbonate in the presence of sodium methoxide. These 5R-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinones are useful as synthetic precursors of pharmaceutically useful oxazolidinones. The large number of steps renders this process unattractive.<br>
J. Med, Chem., 32, 1673 (1989), Tetrahedron 45, 1323 (1989) and US Patent 4,948,801 disclose a method of producing oxazolidinones which comprises reacting an isocyanate (R-N=C=O) with (R)-glycidyl butyrate in the presence of a catalytic amount of lithium bromide - tributylphosphine oxide complex to produce the corresponding 5R-butyryloxymethyl substituted oxazolidinone. The process is<br><br>
performed at 135-145°. The butyrate ester is then hydrolyzed in a subsequent step to give the corresponding 5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinone. The relative high cost and/or availability of the isocyanate starting material and requirement of high temperature detract significantly from the attractiveness of this method.<br>

disclose the reaction of a carbamate with n-butyllithium, lithium diisopropylamide or lithium hexamethyldisilazide at -78° to -40° followed by glycidyl butyrate at -78° followed by warming to 20-25° to produce 5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinones (III) where the ester is cleaved during the reaction.<br>
US Patents 4,062,862 and 4,236,012 disclose a process to prepare oxazolidinones which comprises reacting an epoxide with a primary (lacking any substituent on the nitrogen atom) carbamate in the presence of a catalyst. The process "is preferably conducted at a temperature of from 100° to 150° for several hours."<br>
Canadian Patent 681,830 discloses a process to prepare oxazolidinones which comprises reacting an aryl ether of glycidol with a primary carbamate in the presence of an alkaline catalyst (preferably lithium amide or lithium hydroxide). The process was performed in the "preferred temperature range of 150° to 165°". The products are aryl ethers of 5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinones and the yields are poor (40-78%).<br><br>
J. Am Chem. Soc., 64, 1291 (1942) and US Patent 3,547,951 disclose a method for converting primary alcohols to amines that involves treatment with methane sulfonyl chloride to produce the mesylate followed by contacting the mesylate with anhydrous ammonia at ambient temperature in a sealed reaction vessel under high pressure.<br>
It is also known that the mesylates of primary alcohols react with aqueous ammonia to give the corresponding primary amines, but high temperature and high pressure (85 psig) are required. Normally this process cannot be used in ordinary general purpose reactors and must be run in special reactors rated for high pressure.<br>
International Publication WO95/07271 discloses the ammonolysis of oxazolidinone mesylates.<br>
US Patent 4,476,136 discloses a method of transforming 5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinones (III) to the corresponding 5(S)-aminomethyl substituted oxazolidinones (VII) that involves treatment with methane sulfonyl chloride followed by potassium phthalimide followed by hydrazine. This reaction sequence produces by-products which are difficult to separate from the desired product.<br>
J. Med. Chem., 32, 1673 (1989) and Tetrahedron 45, 1323 (1989) disclose a method for transforming 5-hydroxymethylsubstituted oxazolidinones into the corresponding 5S-acetamidomethyl substituted oxazolidinones that involves treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride or tosyl chloride, followed by sodium azide, followed by trimethylphosphite or platinum dioxide/hydrogen, followed by acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride to give the desired 5(S)-acetamidomethyl substituted oxazolidinone. It is known that sodium azide is an explosion hazard.<br>
US Patent 5,210,303 discloses the conversion of various substituted benzyl chlorides into the corresponding benzylamines by heating with aqueous ammonia in the presence of aromatic aldehydes to suppress dialkylation. The dialkylated impurity is generally difficult to remove, see Chem. Lett., 1057 (1978).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The process to produce the 5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinone alcohols (III) can use either the non-cyclic (S)-, (R)- dihydroxy compounds of formula (I) or any mixture thereof or (S)-, (R)- glycidol (IV) or any mixture to couple with the carbamate (IIA) or a trifluoroacetamide of formula (IIB).<br>
The 5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinone alcohols (III) are useful intermediates to produce 5-aminomethyl substituted oxazolidinone amines (VII) which can be acylated to prepare pharmaceutically useful 5-acylamidomethyl substituted oxazolidinone (VIII) antibacterial agents. Because of an enantiomeric center, 5(R)-, 5(S)-acylamidomethyl substituted oxazolidinones (VIII) and mixtures thereof can be produced. The 5-acylamidomethyl substituted oxazolidinone (VIII) (S)-enantiomer has antibacterial activity, the (R)-enantiomer does not. The 5(S)-aminomethyl substituted oxazolidinone amine (VII) enantiomer is produced from the 5(R)-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinone alcohol (III) enantiomer which is produced from the (S)-dihydroxy compound (I) or (S)-glycidol (IV). Therefore, the desired and preferred enantiomeric sequence is to use enantiomerically pure (8)-dihydroxy compound (I) or (S)-glycidol (IV) to give (R)-5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinone alcohol (III) which is used to give enantiomerically pure (S)-5-aminomethyl substituted oxazolidinone amine (VII) which is transformed to enantiomerically pure (S)-5-acylamidomethyl substituted oxazolidinone (VIII). However, it is readily apparent to one skilled in the art that one could easily perform the identical process steps with the opposite enantiomeric forms and at any point in the process invert an undesired enantiomeric configuration to the desired one. Therefore, using the chemistry of the claimed process with any of the enantiomeric forms is considered equivalent to the claimed processes.<br>
The dihydroxy compounds, M1-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-OH, of formula (I) and glycidol compounds, C H2-C H-CH2-OH, of formula (IV) where the carbon atoms designated by an   are each bonded to the same oxygen atom (-0-) to form a three member ring, are known to those skilled in the art or can be readily prepared from known compounds by methods known to those skilled in the art. It is preferred that the hydroxy starting material be the dihydroxy compound (I). It is preferred that the dihydroxy compound (I) and the glycidol (IV) be the (S)-enantiomer. It is<br>
preferred that M1 is C1-; it is preferred that the dihydroxy compound (I) be claim 5, which can be purchased commercially.<br>
The carbamates, RrNH-CO-0-M2, of formula (IIA) and the trifluoroacetamide, R1--NH-CO-CFg, of formula (IIB) are either known to those skilled in the art or can readily be prepared from known compounds by methods known to those skilled in the art. The nature of the leaving group M2 is not important since it is lost during the course of the reaction as is known to those skilled in the art. Operable M2 (leaving groups) are those where -0-M2 is a base whose acid has a pka of between about 8 and about 24. Preferred M2 includes<br>
C1-C20 alkyl,<br>
C3-C7 cycloalkyl,<br>
- optionally substituted with one or two C1-C8 alkyl or F-, C1-, Br-, I-,<br>
CH2=CH-CH2-,<br>
CH3-CH=CH-CH2-,<br>
(CHg)2C=CH-CH2-,<br>
CH2=CH-,<br>
-CH=CH-CH2-,<br>
-CH2- optionally substituted on - with one or two -Cl, C1-C4 alkyl, -N02, -CN, -CF3,<br>
9-fluorenylmethyl,<br>
(C1)3C-CH2-,<br>
2-trimethylsilylethyl,<br>
-CH2-CH2,<br>
1-adamantyl,<br>
()2CH-,<br>
CH=C-C(CH3)2-<br>
2-furanylmethyl,<br>
isobornyl, more preferred leaving groups are C1-C4 alkyl or benzyl. Any other leaving group which operates in a similar manner is considered equivalent to those identified above. The carbamate (IIA) and trifluoroacetamide (IIB) carry the aromatic/heteroaromatic group (R1-) of the 5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinone alcohol (III). It is preferred that R1 is phenyl substituted with one -F and one substituted amino group; it is more preferred that R1 is 3-fluoro-4-[4-(benzyloxycarbonyl)- l-piperazinyl]phenyl or 3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl. Depending on the particular substituents in R1 the groups may have to be protected<br>
as is known to those skilled in the art, by means known to those skilled in the art to prevent undesirable side reactions. For example, if the R1 substituent has a free primary or secondary hydroxy group, it is not necessary, but preferable to protect it with an alcohol protecting group in the formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinone alcohols (III). The unprotected alcohol will not in general interfere with the reaction of the dihydroxy compound (I) or glycidol (IV) with the carbamate (IIA) or trifluoroacetamide (IIB) to give the 5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinone alcohols (III). However, an unprotected alcohol will in general interfer with the conversion of the 5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinone alcohols (III) to the corresponding 5-aminomethyl substituted oxazolidinone amines (VII), because it is very difficult or impossible to selectively protect a primary or secondary alcohol on the R! functionality in the presence of another primary or secondary alcohol. Suitable alcohol protecting groups are well known to those skilled in the art, preferred are C1-C5 alkyl, -CH2-, CH3-0-CH2-, CH3-, CH3-S-CH2-,-CH2-0-CH2-, tetrahydropyranyl, CH3CH(-0-C2H5)-, p-methoxybenzyl, p-methoxyphenyl, p-nitrobenzyl, ()3C-, (CH3)3Si-, [CH3-CH(CH3)]3Si-, (CH3)2Si-. These protecting groups are removed by means known to those skilled in the art. For example, if R1 containes a hydroxy substituent, it must be protected during the transformation of the 5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinone alcohol (III) to the 5-aminomethyl substituted oxazolidinone amine (VII) or the 5-acylamidomethyl substituted oxazolidinone (VIII).  If the R1 substituent contains a free primary or secondary amino substituent it does not have to be protected during formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinone alcohols (III) but must be protected during transformation of he 5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinone alcohols (III) to the corresponding 5-aminomethyl substituted oxazolidinone amines (VII) and the 5-acylamidomethyl substituted oxazolidinones (VIII). The reason is that the amino group will in general undergo an undesired side reaction during one or more of the steps involved in the transformation of the 5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinone alcohols (III) to the corresponding 5-acylamidomethyl substituted oxazolidinones (VIII). Therefore, it is preferable to protect any free amino substituent in the R1 functionality prior to the reaction of the dihydroxy compound (I) or glycidol (IV) with the carbamate (IIA) or trifluoroacetamide (IIB).   Amino protecting groups are very well known to those skilled in the art. Preferred amino protecting groups include: (I) C1-C4 alkyl,<br>
(II)	<br>
(III)	3C-,<br>
(IV)	Ra-C0- where Ra is (A) H-, (B) C1-C4 alkyl, (C) C5-C7 cycloalkyl, (D) (Cr<br>
C5 alkyD-O-, (E) C13C-CH2-0-, (F) H2C=CH-CH2-0-, (G) -CH=CH-CH2-O-, (H) -<br>
CH2-O-, (I)p-methoxyphenyl-CH2-O-, (J) p-nitrophenyl-CH2-0-, (K) -0-, (L) CH3-<br>
CO-CH2-, (M) (CH3)3Si-0-,<br>
(V)	Rb-SO2- where Rb is: (A) (C1 alkyl)-, (B) -, (C) p-methylphenyl- and (D)<br>
-CH2-. A preferred amino protecting group is benzyloxycarbonyl which can be<br>
removed by catalytic hydrogenation as is known to those skilled in the art. There is<br>
nothing novel regarding the use of protecting groups in these reactions or the nature<br>
of the particular protecting groups. All this is well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The protecting groups can be removed after the last reaction in which the protected<br>
substituent would be affected or carried along and removed after subsequent<br>
reactions as is known to those skilled in the art. For example, it my be preferable to<br>
carry the protecting group along until the final acylation step is completed, before<br>
removal, as is known to those skilled in the art. Optionally the R^ substituent can<br>
be modified after the 5-acylamidomethyl substituted oxazolidinones (VIII) is<br>
produced depending on what chemical reactions are required as is known to those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
The reaction of either dihydroxy compounds (I) or glycidol (IV) with either the carbamates (IIA) or trifluoroacetamides (IIB) give the same 5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinone alcohols (III). The choice of whether to use a dihydroxy compound (I) or glycidol (IV) to produce a particular 5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinone alcohol (III) has to be made on a case by case basis. No starting material is preferred in all cases; there is no generally preferred way based on chemistry alone. The decision involves the commercial availability of the particular starting material, its chemical and enantiomeric purity, its cost, etc as is known to those skilled in the art.<br>
One process of the present invention is the reaction of the dihydroxy compound (I) or glycidol (IV) with the carbamate (IIA) or trifluoroacetamides (IIB) in the presence of lithium cation (Li+) and a base whose conjugate acid has a pKa of greater than about 8.<br>
The processes requires about one molar equivalent of either the dihydroxy compound (I) or glycidol (IV)equivalent of carbamate (IIA) or trifluoroacetamides (IIB). The reaction requires a base, the nature of which is not critical so long as it is strong enough to deprotonate the carbamate (II). Operable bases are those whose conjugate acid has a pKa of greater than about 8. Preferred bases include compounds selected from the group consisting of:<br>
alkoxy compounds of one thru seven carbon atoms,<br>
carbonate,<br>
methyl, sec-butyl and f-butyl carbanions,<br>
tri(alkyl)amines where the alkyl group is from 1 thru 4 carbon atoms,<br>
conjugate base of the carbamate (II),<br>
DBU,<br>
DBN,<br>
N-methyl-piperidine,<br>
N-methyl morpholine,<br>
2,2,2-trichloroethoxide and<br>
Cl3C-CH2-O"; most preferred bases are where the base is alkoxy of four or five carbon atoms. It is preferred that the four and five carbon alcohol bases be t-amylate or f-butoxide.  Sodium or potassium bases in combination with a lithium salt (such as lithium chloride or lithium bromide) can be used forming the lithium cation and base in situ.<br>
The nature of the solvent is not critical. Operable solvents include cyclic ethers such as THF, amides such as DMF and DMAC, amines such as triethylamine, acetonitrile, and alcohols such as f-amyl alcohol and t-butyl alcohol. The choice of solvent depends on the solubility of the carbamate (IIA) or trifluoroacetamide (IIB) as is known to those skilled in the art.<br>
When the starting material is the dihydroxy compounds (I) it can be beneficial to react the dihydroxy compound (I) with an cyclizing agent prior to contacting with the carbamate (IIA) or trifluoroacetamide (IIB). The term "cyclizing agent" refers to a base that cyclizes the dihydroxy compound (I) to glycidol (IV). Operable cyclizing agents include bases whose acid has a pka of greater than about 7; preferred cyclizing agents are sodium, potassium or lithium butoxide, sodium or potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, DBU, lithium, sodium and potassium amylate; most preferred is potassium f-butoxide. It is preferable to perform the reaction at 
the reaction can be run at higher temperature. As stated above, differentiation between primary alcohols and secondary alcohols is difficult. In the cyclization reaction, a simple alcohol is formed. For instance, benzyl alcohol is formed when a benzyl carbonate is subjected to the cyclization conditions. Removal of this alcohol is necessary to the success of the alcohol to amine conversion. This is accomplished by crystallization using ethyl acetate/heptane (1/2). The benzyl alcohol stays in solution and the desired oxazolidinone alcohol is isolated as a solid.<br>
CHART C discloses the processes of transforming the 5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinone alcohols (III) to the corresponding 5-aminomethyl substituted oxazolidinone amines (VII). The situation of protecting the alcohol and/or amino groups on the R^ functionality was discussed above. The 5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinone alcohols (III) are contacted with a sulfonylating agent (Va-Vd) of four types. These are M3-SO2-C6Hn3(N02)nlCln2 (Va), Ot-SO2C6Hn3NO2)Cl (Vb), 0(S02-F)2 (Vc) and O(SO2-CF3)2 (Vd). M3 is a leaving group which includes Cl- or Br-; it is preferred that M3 be C1-. The 5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinones (III) are contacted with a sulfonylating agent CVa-Vd) to form a oxazolidinone sulfonate (VIa-VId) intermediate.<br>
The sulfonation reaction of converting the 5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinones (III) to the corresponding oxazolidinone sulfonates (VI) is performed by contacting the 5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinones (III) with at least one molar equivalent of the sulfonylating agent (Va-Vd) in the presence of a base in an inert solvent at about 0°. Operable bases include triethylamine, tributylamine, diisopropylethylamine, DABCO, DBU, DBN, n-butyl lithium, ethyl magnesium chloride and the equivalents thereof; preferred is triethylamine. Inert solvents include most organic solvents such as methylene chloride, THF, DMA, DMF, ethyl acetate, and the equivalent thereof; preferred is methylene chloride.<br>
The ammonolysis reaction of the conversion of the oxazolidinone sulfonates (VI) to the corresponding 5-aminomethyl substituted oxazolidinone amines (VII) is performed under open or non-sealed conditions or under sealed conditions although it is preferred to be performed under sealed conditions.<br>
In either case the ammonolysis reaction is carried out by contacting the oxazolidinone sulfonates (VI) with ammonia (preferably aqueous) preferably with a solvent or mixture of solvnets. Preferred solvents are those that dissolve both the oxazolidinone sulfonates (VI) and the aqueous ammonia because by dissolving both contact between them is insured. However, the process is also operable with<br>
solvents that only partially dissolve the oxazolidinone sulfonates (VI), the disadvantage is that the reaction in general is slower. In the case of the the m-nitrobenenesulfonates, the preferred solvent is a mixture of acetonitrile/isopropanol or THF/isopropanol. The system is put under reduced pressure. The system is then closed or sealed, and the ammonia (preferably aqueous ammonia) is added and heated to less than 50°, preferably to less than 40°, preferably to about 38° (about 3 psig). At about 38-40° the pressure is about 0 to about 10 psig, which is well below the ceiling pressure rating of general purpose reactors. Under these conditions, at about 60°, the psig is about 20. It is preferred that the ammonolysis reaction be performed at a pressure of about 0 to about 20 psig, preferably at about 0 to about 5 psig and at about 60° or less. Alternatively, the reaction is performed in an open system at reflux. In this case the temperature will be slightly lower and the reaction will require slightly longer to reach completion. The ammonia can be either aqueous, alcoholic or anhydrous; however, aqueous ammonia is preferred.<br>
Alternatively, the contacting with aqueous ammonia can be performed in the presence of an aromatic aldehyde (IX, Ar-CHO), preferably salicylaldehyde. The 5-aminomethyl substituted oxazolidinone amines (VII) and the aldehyde (DC) form a Schiff base of the formula (oxazolidinone-N=CH-Ar) which is then hydrolyzed with aqueous acid, as is known to those skilled in the art, to give the desired 5-aminomethyl substituted oxazolidinone amines (VII). The aromatic aldehyde (DC) is useful in suppressing dimer formation.<br>
The 5-aminomethyl substituted oxazolidinone amines (VII) are acylated by known means such as acyl halides or acyl anhydrides to form the corresponding 5-acylamidomethyl substituted oxazolidinone (VIII), see CHART D. Any alcohol or amino protecting groups must be removed after the 5-acylamidomethyl substituted oxazolidinones (VIII) are produced. However, they can be removed earlier in the reaction sequence depending on the particular substituents in question as is known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The 5-acylamidomethyl substituted oxazolidinones (VIII) are known to be antibacterial pharmaceutical agents. R2 is selected from the group consisting of -H, C1-C12 optionally substituted with one or more halogens, (C3-C7)cyclo(C5-C9)alkyl or -O-R2a where R2a is C1-C6 alkyl. It is preferred that R2 is C1 alkyl.<br>
DEFINITIONS AND CONVENTIONS<br>
The definitions and explanations below are for the terms as used throughout this entire document including both the specification and the claims.<br>
I. CONVENTIONS FOR FORMULAS AND DEFINITIONS OF VARIABLES<br>
The chemical formulas representing various compounds or molecular fragments in the specification and claims may contain variable substituents in addition to expressly defined structural features. These variable substituents are identified by a letter or a letter followed by a numerical subscript, for example, "Zj" or "Rj" where "i" is an integer. These variable substituents are either monovalent or bivalent, that is, they represent a group attached to the formula by one or two chemical bonds. For example, a group Zj would represent a bivalent variable if attached to the formula CH3-C(=Z1)H. Groups Rj and Rj would represent monovalent variable substituents if attached to the formula CH3-CH2-C(R1))(Rj)-H. When chemical formulas are drawn in a linear fashion, such as those above, variable substituents contained in parentheses are bonded to the atom immediately to the left of the variable substituent enclosed in parenthesis. When two or more consecutive variable substituents are enclosed in parentheses, each of the consecutive variable substituents is bonded to the immediately preceding atom to the left which is not enclosed in parentheses. Thus, in the formula above, both Rj and Rj are bonded to the preceding carbon atom. Also, for any molecule with an established system of carbon atom numbering, such as steroids, these carbon atoms are designated as Cj, where "i" is the integer corresponding to the carbon atom number. For example, Cg represents the 6 position or carbon atom number in the steroid nucleus as traditionally designated by those skilled in the art of steroid chemistry. Likewise the term "R6" represents a variable substituent (either monovalent or bivalent) at the Cg position.<br>
Chemical formulas or portions thereof drawn in a linear fashion represent atoms in a linear chain. The symbol"-" in general represents a bond between two atoms in the chain. Thus CHg-O-CH2-CH(Rj)-CH3 represents a 2-substituted-l-methoxypropane compound. In a similar fashion, the symbol "=" represents a double bond, e.g., CH2=C(Ri)-0-CH3, and the symbol "s" represents a triple bond, e.g., HCsC-CH(Ri)-CH2-CH3.  Carbonyl groups are represented in either one of two ways: -CO- or -C(=0)-, with the former being preferred for simplicity.<br>
Chemical formulas of cyclic (ring) compounds or molecular fragments can be represented in a linear fashion. Thus, the compound 4-chloro-2-methylpyridine can be represented in linear fashion by N*=C(CH3)-CH=CC1-CH=C*H with the convention that the atoms marked with an asterisk (*) are bonded to each other resulting in the formation of a ring. Likewise, the cyclic molecular fragment, 4-<br>
,*.<br>
(ethyl)-1-piperazinyl can be represented by -N -(CH2)2-N(C2H5)-H5)-CH2-CH2.<br>
A rigid cyclic (ring) structure for any compounds herein defines an orientation with respect to the plane of the ring for substituents attached to each carbon atom of the rigid cyclic compound. For saturated compounds which have two substituents attached to a carbon atom which is part of a cyclic system, -C(X1)(X2))- the two substituents may be in either an axial or equatorial position relative to the ring and may change between axial/equatorial. However, the position of the two substituents relative to the ring and each other remains fixed. While either substituent at times may lie in the plane of the ring (equatorial) rather than above or below the plane (axial), one substituent is always above the other. In chemical structural formulas depicting such compounds, a substituent (X1) which is "below" another substituent (X2) will be identified as being in the alpha (a) configuration and is identified by a broken, dashed or dotted line attachment to the carbon atom, i.e., by the symbol"- --" or "...". The corresponding substituent attached "above" (X2) the other (X1) is identified as being in the beta (ß) configuration and is indicated by an unbroken line attachment to the carbon atom.<br>
When a variable substituent is bivalent, the valences may be taken together or separately or both in the definition of the variable. For example, a variable Ri attached to a carbon atom as -C(=Ri)- might be bivalent and be defined as oxo or keto (thus forming a carbonyl group (-CO-) or as two separately attached monovalent variable substituents α-Ri-j- and B-Ri-k. When a bivalent variable, Ri, is defined to consist of two monovalent variable substituents, the convention used to define the bivalent variable is of the form α-R-ß-Ri-k,." or some variant thereof. In such a case both α-Ri-k and B-Ri-k are attached to the carbon atom to give -C(α-Ri-j)(ß-Ri-k)-. For example, when the bivalent variable R6, -C(=Rg)- is defined to consist of two monovalent variable substituents, the two monovalent variable substituents are ct-<br>
R6-1:ß-R6-2.......α-R6-9:ß-R6-10, etc giving -C(α-R6-1)............C(α-R6-9)(ß-R6-10),<br>
etc. Likewise, for the bivalent variable R11, -C(=R11)-, two monovalent variable substituents are α-R11-1:ß-R11-2. For a ring substituent for which separate a and B orientations do not exist (e.g. due to the presence of a carbon carbon double bond in the ring), and for a substituent bonded to a carbon atom which is not part of a ring the above convention is still used, but the a and B designations are omitted.<br>
Just as a bivalent variable may be defined as two separate monovalent variable substituents, two separate monovalent variable substituents may be defined to be taken together to form a bivalent variable. For example, in the formula<br>
-C1(Ri)H-C2(Rj)H- (C1 and C2 define arbitrarily a first and second carbon atom, respectively) Rj and R may be defined to be taken together to form (1) a second bond between C1 and C2 or (2) a bivalent group such as oxa (-O-) and the formula thereby describes an epoxide. When Rj and R: are taken together to form a more complex entity, such as the group -X-Y-, then the orientation of the entity is such that C1 in the above formula is bonded to X and C2 is bonded to Y. Thus, by convention the designation "... Rj and R: are taken together to form -CH2-CH2-O-CO-..." means a lactone in which the carbonyl is bonded to C2. However, when designated "... Rj and Rj are taken together to form -CO-0-CH2-CH2-the convention means a lactone in which the carbonyl is bonded to Ci.<br>
The carbon atom content of variable substituents is indicated in one of two ways. The first method uses a prefix to the entire name of the variable such as "C1-C4", where both "1" and "4" are integers representing the minimum and maximum number of carbon atoms in the variable. The prefix is separated from the variable by a space. For example, "C1-C4 alkyl" represents alkyl of 1 through 4 carbon atoms, (including isomeric forms thereof unless an express indication to the contrary is given). Whenever this single prefix is given, the prefix indicates the entire carbon atom content of the variable being defined. Thus C2-C4 alkoxycarbonyl describes a group CH3-(CH2)n-O-CO- where n is zero, one or two. By the second method the carbon atom content of only each portion of the definition is indicated separately by enclosing the "Cj-Cj" designation in parentheses and placing it immediately (no intervening space) before the portion of the definition being defined. By this optional convention (C1-C3)alkoxycarbonyl has the same meaning as C2-C4 alkoxycarbonyl because the "C1-C3" refers only to the carbon atom content of the alkoxy group. Similarly while both C2-C6 alkoxyalkyl and (C1-C3)alkoxy(C1-C3)alkyl define alkoxyalkyl groups containing from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, the two definitions differ since the former definition allows either the alkoxy or alkyl portion alone to contain 4 or 5 carbon atoms while the latter definition limits either of these groups to 3 carbon atoms.<br>
When the claims contain a fairly complex (cyclic) substituent, at the end of the phrase naming/designating that particular substituent will be a notation in (parentheses) which will correspond to the same name/designation in one of the CHARTS which will also set forth the chemical structural formula of that particular substituent.<br>
