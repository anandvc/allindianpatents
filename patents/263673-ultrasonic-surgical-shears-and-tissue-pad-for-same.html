ULTRASONIC SURGICAL SHEARS AND TISSUE PAD FOR SAME<br>
[0001]    Reference to Related Applications<br>
[0002]   ;The present,application claims the priority benefit of U.S. provisional patent application serial no. 60/548,301, filed on February 27, 2004, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0003]    This application contains subject matter related to co-owned patent application no. 60/617,427, filed on October 8, 2004, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0004]    Field of the Invention<br>
[0005]    The present invention is related generally to surgical instruments, and more particularly to an ultrasonic surgical shears and to a tissue pad for an ultrasonic surgical shears.<br>
[0006]    Background of the Invention;<br>
[0007]    Ultrasonic surgical instruments are known which include an ultrasonic surgical shears having an ultrasonic surgical blade, a clamping arm operable to open and close toward the blade, and a polytetrafluoroethylene tissue pad which is attached to the clamping arm and which includes a clamping surface. The clamping arm exerts a clamping force on a blood vessel which is positioned between the clamping surface of the tissue pad and the blade. The result of the ultrasonically-vibrating ultrasonic surgical blade and the clamping force on the blood vessel is a coaptation of the blood vessel (a bringing together of the walls of the blood vessel), a transection (a cutting) of the coapted blood vessel and a coagulation (a sealing) of the coapted cut ends of the blood vessel. At the completion of a tissue transection, the ultrasonically-vibrating ultrasonic surgical blade contacts and cuts away<br><br>
PCT/US2005/006272<br>
2<br>
some of the polytetrafluoroethylene tissue pad because of the frictional abrasion and frictional heat generated by the blade vibrating against the tissue pad. Exemplary devices are described in U.S. Patent Serial Numbers 5,322,055 and 6,325;811, the 'contents of Which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0008] Still, scientists and engineers continue to seek improved ultrasonic surgical shears and improved tissue pads for ultrasonic surgical shears.<br>
[0009]    Summary of the Invention<br>
[0010]   A first embodiment of an ultrasonic-surgical-shears tissue pad of the invention includes an ultrasonic-surgical-shears tissue pad body having a base material and at least one filler material which is a different material from the base material.<br>
[0011]   A second embodiment of an ultrasonic-surgical-shears tissue pad of the invention includes an ultrasonic-surgical-shears tissue pad body having adjoining first and second regions, wherein the first region includes a first material and wherein the second region includes a second material which is a different material from the first material.<br>
[0012]    A first embodiment of an ultrasonic surgical shears of the invention includes an ultrasonic surgical blade and a clamping arm operable to open and close toward the blade and having a transversely and resiliency flexible distal tip.<br>
[0013]   A second embodiment of an ultrasonic surgi shears of the invention includes an ultrasonic surgical blade, a clamping arm operable to open and close toward the blade, and a tissue pad attached to the clamping arm and having a clamping surface. At leas a portion of the, tissue pad is resiliently flexible in a direction substantially perpendicular to the clamping surface.<br><br>
WO 2005/084250	PCT/US2005/006272<br>
3<br>
[0014]    Several benefits and advantages are obtained from one or more of the embodiments of the invention. Having a tissue pad with a base material and at-least-one filler material allows the base material and the at-least-one filler material to be chosen with a different hardness, stiffness, lubricity, dynamic coefficient of friction, heat transfer coefficient, abradability, heat deflection temperature, and/or melt temperature to improve the wearability of the tissue pad which is important when high clamping forces are employed because tissue pads wear faster at higher clamping forces than at lower clamping forces. Applicants found, in one experiment, that a 15% graphite-filled polytetrafluoroethylene tissue pad showed substantially the same wear with a 7 pound clampmg forca as a.100% polytetrafluoroethylene tissue pad showed with a 1.5 pound clamping force. Having a flexible clamping arm and/or a flexible tissue pad should also improve the wearability of the tissue pad due to the ability of the flexible member to more evenly distribute the load across the entire surface of the tissue pad.<br>
[0015]    The present invention has, without limitationf application in straight or curved ultrasonic surgical blades as disclosed in the patents incorporated by reference and further in hand-activated instruments as well as in robotic-assisted Instruments.- <br>

[0037]    Figure 2 illustrates a second embodiment,of an ultrasonic-surgical-shears tissuepad 18 of the invention. The ultrasonic-surgical-shears tissue pad 18 has an ultrasonic-surgical-shears tissue pad body 20 having adjoining first and second regions 24 and 26, wherein the first region 24 includes a first material 28 and wherein the second region 26 includes a second material 30 which is a different material from the first material 28.

9<br>
the tissue pad body 20 as shown in the figure. In another construction, not shown, the interface between the first and second regions is substantially parallel to the clamping surface (this can be visualized by rotating the tissue pad 18 in Figure 2 by ninety degrees. In an additional construction, hot shown, the interface is slanted with respect to the clamping surface at an angle between substantially 1 and 89 degrees, as can be appreciated by the artisan.<br>
[0039]    It is noted that the examples, illustrations, choices of materials, etc. described for the embodiment of the ultrasonic-surgical-shears tissue pad 10 of Figure 1 are equally applicable to the embodiment of the ultrasonic-surgical-shears tissue pad 18 of Figure 2 with the phrase "first material 28" replacing the phrase "base material 14" and with the phrase "second material 30" replacing the phrase "at-least-one filler material 16".<br>
[0040]    Figure,3 is an exterior side-elevational view of a tissue pad 118 which is a first alternate embodiment to the tissue pad 18 of Figure 2. Tissue pad 118 includes tissue pad body 120 having adjoining first and second regions 124 and 126 as shown in the figure. First region 124 includes a first material 128, and second region 126 includes a second material 130 which is a different material from the first material. In one variation/the clampingsurface 122 of the tissue pad body 120 consists essentially of the first material 128 which extends away from the clamping surface 122 toward the second regions 126. In one enablement, the material transversely between the second 'regions 126 is the first material 128 of the first region 124. In another enablement, not shown, a third region with a third material is disposed transversely between the second regions.<br>
[0041] Figure 4 is an exterior side-relevational view of a tissue pad 218 which is a second alternate embodiment to the tissue pad 18 of Figure 2. Tissue pad 218 includes tissue pad body 220 having adjoining first and<br><br>
WO 2005/084250	PCT/US2005/006272<br>
10<br>
second regions 224 and 226 as shown in the figure. First reqlon 224 includes a first material 228, and second region 226 includes a second material 230 which is a different material from the first material. In one variation, the clamping surface 222 of the tissue pad body 220 consists essentially of the first material 228 which extends away from the clamping surface 222 toward the second regions 226. In one enablement, the material transversely between the second regions 226 is the first material 228 of the first region 224. In another enablement, not shown, a third region with a third material is disposed transversely between the second regions.<br>
[0042]    Figure 5 is an exterior side-elevational view of a tissue pad 318 which is a third alternate embodiment to the tissue pad 18 of Figure 2. Tissue pad 318 includes tissue pad body 320 having adjoining first and second regions 324 and 326 as shown in the figure. First region 324 includes a first material 328, and second region 326 includes a second material 330 which is a different material from the first material. In one variation, the clamping surface 322 of the tissue pad body 320 consists essentially of the first material 328 which extends away from the clamping surface 322 toward the second regions 326. In one application, tissue pad 318 improves pad life by the first region 324 being sacrificial and being abraded or melted relatively quickly but having certain properties, such as lubricity, that are desirable. The ultrasonic surgical blade, not shown in Figure 5, moves through the first material 318 and then comes into contact with the second material 330. The second material 330 is selected for properties that make it abrade or melt less than the first material 318.<br>
[0043]    It is noted that the examples, illustrations, choices of materials, etc. described for the embodiment of the tissue pad 18 of Figure 2 are equally applicable to the embodiments of the tissue pad 118,218 and<br><br>

318 of Figures 3-5. Other alternate embodiments to the tissue pad 18 are left to the artisan.<br>
[0044]    Figure 6 illustrates a first embodiment of an ultrasonic surgical shears 32 of the invention. The ultrasonic-surgical-shears 32 includes an ultrasonic surgical blade 34 and a clamping arm 36 operable to open and close toward the blade 34 and having a transversely and resiliency flexible distal tip 38. By "resiliency flexible distal tip" is meant that the distal tip 38 resiliency flexes during clamping of the clamping arm 36 such as when the ultrasonic-surgical-shears 32 is used to transect and seal a blood vessel, disposed between the clamping surface 42 and the ultrasonic surgical blade 34, whose walls have been coapted by a clamping force applied via the clamping arm 36. In one implementation of the first expression, the ultrasonic surgical shears 32 also includes a tissue pad 40 attached to the clamping arm 36 and having a clamping surface 42, wherein the tissue pad 40 is resiliency flexible in a direction substantially perpendicular to the clamping surface 42. In one illustration of the embodiment of the ultrasonic-surgical-shears 32, the tissue pad 40 includes a base material and at least one filler material as previously described for the tissue pad 10 of Figure 1. In another illustration of the ultrasonic-surgical-shears 32, the tissue pad 40 includes a first material and a second material as previously described for the tissue pad 18,118,218 or 318 of Figures 2-5.<br>
[0045]    Figure 7 illustrates a second embodiment of an ultrasonic surgical shears 44 of the invention. The ultrasonic-surgical-shears 44 includes an ultrasonic surgical blade 46, aiclampjngajTn 48.operable to open and close toward the blade 46, and a tissue pad 50. The tissue pad 50 is attached to the clamping arm 48 and has a clamping surface 52. At least a portion of the tissue pad 50 is resiliently flexible in a ; direction substantially perpendicular to the clamping'surface 52. By : "resiliently flexible" is meant that the tissue pad 50 resiliently flexes<br><br>
WO 2005/084250	PCT/US2005/006272<br>
12<br>
during clamping of the clamping arm 48 such as when the ultrasonic-surgical-shears 44 is used to transect and seal a blood vessel, disposed between the clamping surface 52 and the ultrasonic surgical blade 46, whose walls have been coapted by a clamping force applied via the clamping arm 48. In one illustration of the embodiment of the ultrasonic-surgical-lshears 44, the tissue pad 50 includes a base material and at' least one filler material as previously described for the tissue pad 10 of Figure 1. In another illustration of the ultrasonic-surgical-shears 44, the tissue pad 40 includes a first material and a second material as previously described for the tissue pad 18,118; 218 or 318 of Figures 2-5.<br>
[0046]    Several benefits and advantages are obtained from one or more of the embodiments of the invention. Having a tissue pad with a base material and at-least-one filler material allows the base material and the at-least-one filler material to be chosen with a different hardness, stiffness, lubricity, dynamic coefficient of friction, heat transfer coefficient, abradability, heat deflection temperaturei(and/or melt temperature to improve the wearability of the tissue pad which is important when high clamping forces are employed because tissue pads wear faster at higher clamping forces than at lower clamping forces. Applicants found, in one experiment, that a 15% graphite-filled polytetrafluoroethylene tissue pad showed substantially the same wear with a 7 pound clamping force as a 100% polytetrafluoroethylene tissue pad showed with a 1.5 pound clamping force. Having a flexible clamping arm and/or a flexible tissue pad should also improve the wearability of the tissue pad due to the ability of the flexible member to more evenly distribute the load across the entire surface of the tissue pad,<br>
[0047]    While the present invention has been illustrated by a description of several embodiments, it is not the intention of the<br><br>
